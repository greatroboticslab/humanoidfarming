26
00:01:03,750 --> 00:01:09,390
collaborative you can see our panelists

27
00:01:07,350 --> 00:01:12,990
up here I'll introduce each when they

28
00:01:09,390 --> 00:01:15,210
come to speak I also want to have a huge

29
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:17,520
shout out and thank you to Eric Mellon

30
00:01:15,210 --> 00:01:19,830
and Foster Nye who are in the back

31
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,909
allowing this to be live streamed and

32
00:01:19,830 --> 00:01:26,220
also archived at UVM YouTube station and

33
00:01:23,909 --> 00:01:27,630
also jeremiah over here who works with

34
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,790
the Davis Center who's helped us with

35
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:33,000
all the IT so thank you everyone who

36
00:01:29,790 --> 00:01:34,920
made this possible the reason we decided

37
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,990
to have this panel is the staff at the

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:38,310
farmer training program we often get

39
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:39,960
questions of what's the difference

40
00:01:38,310 --> 00:01:41,909
between organic agriculture and

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,939
regenerative AG or what's the difference

42
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:46,590
between a gray ecology and permaculture

43
00:01:43,939 --> 00:01:48,750
we can answer those questions but this

44
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:50,280
panel can answer much better than we can

45
00:01:48,750 --> 00:01:52,229
so we wanted to bring everybody together

46
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:53,640
because I also as we can see here

47
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,890
there's a lot of other people in Vermont

48
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:58,640
that wants to know what the nuances are

49
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,780
between these different types of farming

50
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:03,360
and I think what we're going to learn is

51
00:02:00,780 --> 00:02:05,270
there's a lot of overlapping themes and

52
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,280
then we're also going to learn how these

53
00:02:05,270 --> 00:02:09,539
different agricultural practices diverge

54
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:11,580
and how they're different from each

55
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:13,980
other sometimes people talk

56
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:16,110
disparagingly about

57
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:17,700
one form of Agriculture over another and

58
00:02:16,110 --> 00:02:19,530
they don't actually understand the

59
00:02:17,700 --> 00:02:21,659
intricacies of these kinds of

60
00:02:19,530 --> 00:02:23,040
agricultural practices and what we're

61
00:02:21,659 --> 00:02:24,930
hoping to do here is with further

62
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,540
understanding about why farmers make

63
00:02:24,930 --> 00:02:30,530
certain decisions we can hopefully have

64
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:33,959
a broader understanding and awareness of

65
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:35,819
agricultural practices and why farmers

66
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,190
make decisions for what they do so

67
00:02:35,819 --> 00:02:40,410
that's why we have this panel here and I

68
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:43,079
hope you're going to enjoy it first

69
00:02:40,410 --> 00:02:45,569
we're gonna have Maddie Kempner she's

70
00:02:43,079 --> 00:02:47,220
been working at NOFA Vermont as policy

71
00:02:45,569 --> 00:02:49,769
advisor since 2014

72
00:02:47,220 --> 00:02:52,200
Maddie worked on commercial organic

73
00:02:49,769 --> 00:02:54,720
vegetable farm and educational garden in

74
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:58,980
Utah in Colorado which inspired her to

75
00:02:54,720 --> 00:03:01,319
engage in the way to change our food

76
00:02:58,980 --> 00:03:03,629
system how its produced in foreign

77
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:04,769
policy she also worked on the right to

78
00:03:03,629 --> 00:03:06,900
know

79
00:03:04,769 --> 00:03:09,690
GMOs coalition to help pass the

80
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:12,120
first-in-the-nation GMO labeling law she

81
00:03:09,690 --> 00:03:13,739
has a BA BS in environmental studies

82
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:15,390
from the UVM and a master's of

83
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:18,290
environmental law and policy from

84
00:03:15,390 --> 00:03:18,290
Vermont Law School

85
00:03:21,960 --> 00:03:25,960
[Applause]

86
00:04:27,990 --> 00:04:36,910
yeah it seems like what you did should

87
00:04:30,070 --> 00:04:40,470
have worked no worries thank you okay um

88
00:04:36,910 --> 00:04:43,540
can everybody hear me here awesome

89
00:04:40,470 --> 00:04:45,669
so as Sarah said my name is Maddie

90
00:04:43,540 --> 00:04:48,040
Kepner and I work as policy advisor for

91
00:04:45,669 --> 00:04:49,240
nofa Vermont which for those of you who

92
00:04:48,040 --> 00:04:51,940
aren't familiar it's the Northeast

93
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,949
organic farming Association and we are

94
00:04:51,940 --> 00:04:57,220
one of seven chapters throughout the

95
00:04:53,949 --> 00:04:59,889
Northeast doing similar kinds of work in

96
00:04:57,220 --> 00:05:01,570
the food system we also have a

97
00:04:59,889 --> 00:05:03,910
certification program called Vermont

98
00:05:01,570 --> 00:05:05,710
organic farmers maybe you've seen the

99
00:05:03,910 --> 00:05:07,780
logo on the lower right hand of that

100
00:05:05,710 --> 00:05:10,030
screen that's the logo of our

101
00:05:07,780 --> 00:05:11,590
certification program which you'll see

102
00:05:10,030 --> 00:05:14,979
on products all over the state and

103
00:05:11,590 --> 00:05:16,720
beyond and I see someone with a hat with

104
00:05:14,979 --> 00:05:20,110
that logo on it tonight so perhaps to

105
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:22,570
you hmm and also as I mentioned I'm

106
00:05:20,110 --> 00:05:25,210
gonna talk obviously about organic I

107
00:05:22,570 --> 00:05:27,639
will preface this with the fact that I

108
00:05:25,210 --> 00:05:30,810
guess what I'll give you is sort of a

109
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:33,910
fairly basic overview of kind of organic

110
00:05:30,810 --> 00:05:35,440
philosophy and practices in terms of you

111
00:05:33,910 --> 00:05:37,479
know what certification requires and the

112
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,610
process involved in certification there

113
00:05:37,479 --> 00:05:41,169
are at least a couple of other people in

114
00:05:39,610 --> 00:05:41,470
this room who know more about this than

115
00:05:41,169 --> 00:05:44,260
I do

116
00:05:41,470 --> 00:05:45,970
um so please know that there are the

117
00:05:44,260 --> 00:05:48,039
resources and I'm by no means the

118
00:05:45,970 --> 00:05:49,389
end-all expert but I will do my best to

119
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,050
give you a good idea of really what

120
00:05:49,389 --> 00:05:54,160
organic means so the organic philosophy

121
00:05:53,050 --> 00:05:55,960
I think it's really important to

122
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:57,789
understand beyond just understanding

123
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,099
organic certification and the specific

124
00:05:57,789 --> 00:06:05,080
practices that are required the

125
00:06:00,099 --> 00:06:06,610
philosophy really started out as one of

126
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:09,460
the foundational tenets of organic is

127
00:06:06,610 --> 00:06:11,650
feed the soil not the plant organic is

128
00:06:09,460 --> 00:06:14,650
really intended to be a holistic systems

129
00:06:11,650 --> 00:06:17,050
approach to farming we're biologically

130
00:06:14,650 --> 00:06:19,389
active soil serves as a foundation to

131
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:21,400
create as you can see in this little

132
00:06:19,389 --> 00:06:23,500
flowchart healthy plants healthy animals

133
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,539
and healthy people so the whole idea

134
00:06:23,500 --> 00:06:28,840
behind organic is that it's again a

135
00:06:25,539 --> 00:06:32,199
whole systems approach and it really I

136
00:06:28,840 --> 00:06:34,630
would say stands out from a more

137
00:06:32,199 --> 00:06:37,300
conventional approach to agriculture in

138
00:06:34,630 --> 00:06:39,820
that it's again based on this

139
00:06:37,300 --> 00:06:40,240
biologically active system rather than

140
00:06:39,820 --> 00:06:43,750
kind of

141
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,860
and puts in and puts out and along with

142
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:48,100
this I think it's really important to

143
00:06:44,860 --> 00:06:49,419
note that there's both what we know if n

144
00:06:48,100 --> 00:06:51,220
vof referred to as the negative

145
00:06:49,419 --> 00:06:53,380
definition of organic and the positive

146
00:06:51,220 --> 00:06:55,860
definition the negative definition of

147
00:06:53,380 --> 00:06:58,030
organic is what people often think of

148
00:06:55,860 --> 00:06:59,800
you know from a basic consumer

149
00:06:58,030 --> 00:07:02,800
perspective where they think there's you

150
00:06:59,800 --> 00:07:05,470
know no GMOs no sewage sludge

151
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,360
irradiation you know no synthetic

152
00:07:05,470 --> 00:07:09,910
fertilizers or toxic pesticides all

153
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:11,590
those things are true but we also like

154
00:07:09,910 --> 00:07:13,539
to emphasize the positive definition of

155
00:07:11,590 --> 00:07:15,310
organic which is which means that it

156
00:07:13,539 --> 00:07:17,800
requires that farmers go beyond those

157
00:07:15,310 --> 00:07:20,349
things and actively promote biodiversity

158
00:07:17,800 --> 00:07:22,660
on their farms for example and and

159
00:07:20,349 --> 00:07:25,389
develop by biologically active soil that

160
00:07:22,660 --> 00:07:27,940
feeds their plants and their animals on

161
00:07:25,389 --> 00:07:29,530
the farm so I think it's important to

162
00:07:27,940 --> 00:07:31,930
remember that organic doesn't just mean

163
00:07:29,530 --> 00:07:33,880
that certain things are absent but there

164
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:36,909
are really practices that farmers are

165
00:07:33,880 --> 00:07:39,520
required and encouraged to do that are

166
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,289
kind of proactively improving their

167
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:45,940
farming system and hopefully the

168
00:07:41,289 --> 00:07:48,490
environment so what are the organic

169
00:07:45,940 --> 00:07:50,080
standards in a very basic way a set of

170
00:07:48,490 --> 00:07:52,419
definitions and practices that encompass

171
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:53,740
organic farming and processing process

172
00:07:52,419 --> 00:07:56,349
products as you probably know are also

173
00:07:53,740 --> 00:07:57,909
allowed to be certified as organic and

174
00:07:56,349 --> 00:08:00,729
includes a national list of allowed and

175
00:07:57,909 --> 00:08:04,000
prohibited substances which is a dynamic

176
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:07,360
list of materials that are allowed in

177
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:09,009
organic farming and the idea also behind

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,930
the organic standards at the national

179
00:08:09,009 --> 00:08:12,580
level is that they're continuously

180
00:08:10,930 --> 00:08:14,469
improved with input from farmers

181
00:08:12,580 --> 00:08:17,320
consumers nonprofits and private

182
00:08:14,469 --> 00:08:19,840
businesses so there's just to give you a

183
00:08:17,320 --> 00:08:21,639
really brief overview I'm sorry if this

184
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:25,060
is too beginner level for you guys but

185
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:27,130
the National Organic Program is a part

186
00:08:25,060 --> 00:08:29,469
of the USDA that United States

187
00:08:27,130 --> 00:08:30,909
Department of Agriculture and along with

188
00:08:29,469 --> 00:08:32,829
the National Organic Program which is

189
00:08:30,909 --> 00:08:35,200
really the kind of federal regulatory

190
00:08:32,829 --> 00:08:36,550
arm of the organic program there's also

191
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,890
a board called the National Organic

192
00:08:36,550 --> 00:08:39,880
Standards Board that is a an advisory

193
00:08:38,890 --> 00:08:41,560
board to the NOP

194
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:43,959
so the National Organic Standards Board

195
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:45,550
is made up of you know folks from all of

196
00:08:43,959 --> 00:08:48,220
these different groups listed here that

197
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:50,110
gives recommendations to the NOP on what

198
00:08:48,220 --> 00:08:52,680
should and should not be allowed with an

199
00:08:50,110 --> 00:08:52,680
organic production

200
00:08:54,130 --> 00:08:58,690
so who can be organic only farmers and

201
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:00,730
processors certified by a USDA

202
00:08:58,690 --> 00:09:03,940
accredited certification body can use

203
00:09:00,730 --> 00:09:05,980
the term organic when the National

204
00:09:03,940 --> 00:09:09,250
Organic Program was established in 2002

205
00:09:05,980 --> 00:09:11,200
it basically meant that only people who

206
00:09:09,250 --> 00:09:13,900
are certified organic should be using

207
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:15,550
that term with this one exception that

208
00:09:13,900 --> 00:09:17,680
if an operation has gross agricultural

209
00:09:15,550 --> 00:09:20,200
income of five thousand dollars or less

210
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:22,120
they can use the term as long as they

211
00:09:20,200 --> 00:09:23,589
are still complying with the Organic

212
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:25,839
regulations and using the organic

213
00:09:23,589 --> 00:09:27,820
practices and I think this is an

214
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,750
important point in that it really shows

215
00:09:27,820 --> 00:09:34,300
that USDA recognizes and it's a certain

216
00:09:31,750 --> 00:09:36,670
way of recognizing more broadly that and

217
00:09:34,300 --> 00:09:38,140
and I will say also that NOFA and VOF

218
00:09:36,670 --> 00:09:41,470
recognize more broadly that there are

219
00:09:38,140 --> 00:09:44,230
lots of people who practice organically

220
00:09:41,470 --> 00:09:46,870
on their farms who may or may not be

221
00:09:44,230 --> 00:09:48,970
certified for a variety of reasons and I

222
00:09:46,870 --> 00:09:50,580
think you know in talking about organic

223
00:09:48,970 --> 00:09:53,050
it's really important to kind of

224
00:09:50,580 --> 00:09:55,660
understand that outside of organic

225
00:09:53,050 --> 00:09:57,640
certification the organic movement

226
00:09:55,660 --> 00:09:59,830
started long before the National Organic

227
00:09:57,640 --> 00:10:02,050
Program was established and there are

228
00:09:59,830 --> 00:10:05,470
still farmers who are really

229
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:07,300
foundational people within the organic

230
00:10:05,470 --> 00:10:12,460
community who choose not to be certified

231
00:10:07,300 --> 00:10:14,320
for a whole variety of reasons so in

232
00:10:12,460 --> 00:10:17,680
terms of kind of some more specifics of

233
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:19,660
what organic production entails organic

234
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,430
producers are required to feed the soil

235
00:10:19,660 --> 00:10:23,320
and some examples of that are through

236
00:10:21,430 --> 00:10:26,350
cover crops green manures compost and

237
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:28,150
animal manures farmers are required to

238
00:10:26,350 --> 00:10:30,400
rotate their crops which is a way of

239
00:10:28,150 --> 00:10:33,330
avoiding pests and disease problems that

240
00:10:30,400 --> 00:10:35,260
can build up in your soil over time and

241
00:10:33,330 --> 00:10:36,670
organic producers are not allowed to use

242
00:10:35,260 --> 00:10:39,640
toxic pesticides or synthetic

243
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:41,650
fertilizers and basically this goes back

244
00:10:39,640 --> 00:10:44,620
to the idea of the holistic system where

245
00:10:41,650 --> 00:10:48,280
the practices that organic farmers use

246
00:10:44,620 --> 00:10:50,980
are intended so that they don't need to

247
00:10:48,280 --> 00:10:52,980
use certain inputs in order to keep

248
00:10:50,980 --> 00:10:55,779
their plants and their animals healthy

249
00:10:52,980 --> 00:10:58,900
and then in terms of livestock there's

250
00:10:55,779 --> 00:11:01,120
you know similar different practices

251
00:10:58,900 --> 00:11:02,620
based on the same principles may have to

252
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:04,570
be fed organic feed without the use of

253
00:11:02,620 --> 00:11:05,920
hormones or antibiotics raised in a

254
00:11:04,570 --> 00:11:08,130
stress-free environment

255
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:10,360
allowed to exhibit natural behaviors

256
00:11:08,130 --> 00:11:11,890
healthcare treatments have to be natural

257
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,760
or an approved synthetic on the national

258
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:14,500
list

259
00:11:12,760 --> 00:11:17,110
they must have year-round outdoor access

260
00:11:14,500 --> 00:11:19,079
and they must be raised on pasture so

261
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:20,740
there are some fairly specific

262
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:25,029
requirements in terms of livestock

263
00:11:20,740 --> 00:11:27,339
production as well in terms of the

264
00:11:25,029 --> 00:11:29,620
process of certification farmers submit

265
00:11:27,339 --> 00:11:32,079
an organic systems plan on an organic

266
00:11:29,620 --> 00:11:34,540
system plan on an annual basis there is

267
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:37,240
an annual inspection and they pay a fee

268
00:11:34,540 --> 00:11:39,010
to the certification body and they have

269
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:41,290
to renew that application every year

270
00:11:39,010 --> 00:11:44,079
it's also important to note that we do

271
00:11:41,290 --> 00:11:46,630
unannounced inspections on 10% of our

272
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:53,110
operations annually and we do residue

273
00:11:46,630 --> 00:11:57,160
testing on 5% of our operations so this

274
00:11:53,110 --> 00:11:58,480
is a I guess the more more to the point

275
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,420
maybe of the conversation that we're

276
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,610
having tonight one of the prompts that

277
00:12:01,420 --> 00:12:06,130
sera gave us all and in preparing for

278
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:08,260
this discussion is what is we're going

279
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:11,890
to mean for agriculture at this moment

280
00:12:08,260 --> 00:12:13,329
in time this could be a very lengthy

281
00:12:11,890 --> 00:12:16,930
discussion and I hope we'll get a chance

282
00:12:13,329 --> 00:12:18,430
to get more into it but from you know my

283
00:12:16,930 --> 00:12:21,399
perspective and I think from NOAA and

284
00:12:18,430 --> 00:12:24,339
the u.s. perspective organic is really a

285
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:26,019
meaningful and clearly verified set of

286
00:12:24,339 --> 00:12:29,290
practices that benefits the environment

287
00:12:26,019 --> 00:12:33,190
and human health if practiced correctly

288
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,480
that's what they should be doing I think

289
00:12:33,190 --> 00:12:37,449
it's really interesting there was a

290
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:38,829
study that came out I think at least I

291
00:12:37,449 --> 00:12:41,199
saw it through the National Farmers

292
00:12:38,829 --> 00:12:43,209
coalition recently where young and

293
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:45,970
beginning farmers are saying that they

294
00:12:43,209 --> 00:12:47,649
are using organic practices but at least

295
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:49,240
anecdotally and I think probably

296
00:12:47,649 --> 00:12:51,490
empirically they're not getting

297
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,070
certified as often as their predecessors

298
00:12:51,490 --> 00:12:56,560
and I think that's a really important

299
00:12:54,070 --> 00:12:59,680
trend to notice and when I think about

300
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,360
that and you know you all young farmers

301
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:03,220
in the audience I'm sure would have a

302
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,800
lot to say about this but I wonder how

303
00:13:03,220 --> 00:13:08,079
much it is analogous to you know the

304
00:13:05,800 --> 00:13:10,180
feminist movement for example where for

305
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,089
people of my generation the feminist

306
00:13:10,180 --> 00:13:15,329
movement had already happened when I you

307
00:13:13,089 --> 00:13:17,500
know came up when I grew up and so

308
00:13:15,329 --> 00:13:19,720
there's a part of me that wonders

309
00:13:17,500 --> 00:13:21,760
whether young and beginning farmers

310
00:13:19,720 --> 00:13:24,100
aren't taking up the mantle of organic

311
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:25,510
agriculture in the way that the founding

312
00:13:24,100 --> 00:13:26,710
members of the organic movement did

313
00:13:25,510 --> 00:13:28,630
because it's already a really

314
00:13:26,710 --> 00:13:31,060
well-established set of practices and

315
00:13:28,630 --> 00:13:33,910
it's often referred to as an almost 50

316
00:13:31,060 --> 00:13:36,430
billion dollar industry so when you

317
00:13:33,910 --> 00:13:38,080
think of it in those terms it may not

318
00:13:36,430 --> 00:13:39,400
feel like a cause that young and

319
00:13:38,080 --> 00:13:42,100
beginning farmers really need to get

320
00:13:39,400 --> 00:13:44,080
behind but there's also lots of other

321
00:13:42,100 --> 00:13:46,990
reasons why young and beginning farmers

322
00:13:44,080 --> 00:13:48,520
may not be certified oftentimes if

323
00:13:46,990 --> 00:13:49,990
you're selling to direct markets and you

324
00:13:48,520 --> 00:13:52,240
really know your customer and they know

325
00:13:49,990 --> 00:13:53,170
you and your practices that may not be

326
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:55,570
something that you feel is right for

327
00:13:53,170 --> 00:13:58,000
your farm and I think that's really

328
00:13:55,570 --> 00:13:59,430
important to emphasize too sir I

329
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:02,410
mentioned earlier you know the

330
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:05,530
discussion around why farmers choose to

331
00:14:02,410 --> 00:14:07,450
practice in certain ways and while we at

332
00:14:05,530 --> 00:14:08,800
NOFA and view I believe really strongly

333
00:14:07,450 --> 00:14:12,070
in organic and I personally believe

334
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:15,010
really strongly in organic as a set of

335
00:14:12,070 --> 00:14:18,070
farming practices in an approach it's

336
00:14:15,010 --> 00:14:20,320
not been our role to tell farmers how

337
00:14:18,070 --> 00:14:21,400
they should practice or tell farmers

338
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:23,350
that they should or need to get

339
00:14:21,400 --> 00:14:26,400
certified it's that's really an

340
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:29,170
individual decision for every farmer and

341
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:32,170
you know whether or not it works for

342
00:14:29,170 --> 00:14:36,280
them and makes sense for them and so

343
00:14:32,170 --> 00:14:38,470
more kind of in terms of the order

344
00:14:36,280 --> 00:14:41,410
Grameen's at this moment in time I think

345
00:14:38,470 --> 00:14:43,360
that many of you may be aware that there

346
00:14:41,410 --> 00:14:45,490
have been some challenges with how

347
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,080
organic is enforced and implemented at

348
00:14:45,490 --> 00:14:50,890
the national level level through the

349
00:14:47,080 --> 00:14:52,330
National Organic Program it is intended

350
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:54,400
to be a process of continuous

351
00:14:52,330 --> 00:14:56,290
improvement but especially in recent

352
00:14:54,400 --> 00:14:58,270
years organic has run up against some

353
00:14:56,290 --> 00:15:00,540
walls in terms of the National Organic

354
00:14:58,270 --> 00:15:03,460
Program enforcing the regulations

355
00:15:00,540 --> 00:15:04,839
consistently or different certifiers

356
00:15:03,460 --> 00:15:08,380
across the country of which there I

357
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:10,839
believe 95 implementing the organic

358
00:15:08,380 --> 00:15:13,060
regulations in the same way across the

359
00:15:10,839 --> 00:15:14,620
board so that's definitely one of the

360
00:15:13,060 --> 00:15:17,680
challenges associated with this being

361
00:15:14,620 --> 00:15:20,200
now under the banner of USDA which I

362
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:22,210
would say is different from the

363
00:15:20,200 --> 00:15:23,260
challenges that existed when there were

364
00:15:22,210 --> 00:15:26,320
a bunch of different kind of

365
00:15:23,260 --> 00:15:28,410
state-by-state programs but I'm sure

366
00:15:26,320 --> 00:15:30,420
there were challenges with that as well

367
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:32,920
I think it's also really interesting

368
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:34,899
that organic has come to serve

369
00:15:32,920 --> 00:15:36,970
the foundation for a couple of add-on

370
00:15:34,899 --> 00:15:39,070
labels that are in development currently

371
00:15:36,970 --> 00:15:40,959
there is a group called a real organic

372
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,740
project that is developing a set of

373
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,870
standards currently that will be used to

374
00:15:44,740 --> 00:15:49,209
create and add on label not by that name

375
00:15:46,870 --> 00:15:52,570
but that will use organic as its kind of

376
00:15:49,209 --> 00:15:54,310
baseline and then build on top of it and

377
00:15:52,570 --> 00:15:55,660
the reason for that is some of the

378
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:56,980
stagnation that I mentioned with

379
00:15:55,660 --> 00:15:59,380
continuous improvement under the

380
00:15:56,980 --> 00:16:01,750
National Organic Program the goal of the

381
00:15:59,380 --> 00:16:03,730
real organic project is to address you

382
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:05,649
know shortcomings in terms of USDA

383
00:16:03,730 --> 00:16:06,430
Organic like the allowance of

384
00:16:05,649 --> 00:16:08,800
hydroponics

385
00:16:06,430 --> 00:16:12,010
which have been allowed to be certified

386
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,230
now as organic and some concerns about

387
00:16:12,010 --> 00:16:17,970
enforcement of things like the pasture

388
00:16:14,230 --> 00:16:20,380
rule and lack of implementation of

389
00:16:17,970 --> 00:16:21,970
higher animal welfare standards for

390
00:16:20,380 --> 00:16:23,949
organic called the organic livestock and

391
00:16:21,970 --> 00:16:25,630
poultry practices rule which was

392
00:16:23,949 --> 00:16:28,120
actually passed under the Obama

393
00:16:25,630 --> 00:16:30,370
administration but was withdrawn by the

394
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:33,820
Trump administration immediately

395
00:16:30,370 --> 00:16:35,079
thereafter and then there is another set

396
00:16:33,820 --> 00:16:37,480
of standards being developed called

397
00:16:35,079 --> 00:16:39,310
regenerative organic certification this

398
00:16:37,480 --> 00:16:42,220
was started by the Rodale Institute and

399
00:16:39,310 --> 00:16:43,870
it is a really similar project with

400
00:16:42,220 --> 00:16:46,570
similar goals I would say but a very

401
00:16:43,870 --> 00:16:48,730
different approach and the real organic

402
00:16:46,570 --> 00:16:50,260
project really was kind of started here

403
00:16:48,730 --> 00:16:52,690
in Vermont and has grown to be a

404
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:55,149
national effort and was it has always

405
00:16:52,690 --> 00:16:57,360
been very farmer driven and the

406
00:16:55,149 --> 00:17:01,779
regenerative organic certification was

407
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,419
seemingly less farmer driven but it also

408
00:17:01,779 --> 00:17:07,419
is a set of standards that are thought

409
00:17:04,419 --> 00:17:09,250
to be somewhat unattainable at least in

410
00:17:07,419 --> 00:17:10,360
their current form so it'll be real

411
00:17:09,250 --> 00:17:13,750
interesting to see what happens with

412
00:17:10,360 --> 00:17:14,919
those couple of efforts but organic USDA

413
00:17:13,750 --> 00:17:16,750
Organic certification will be a

414
00:17:14,919 --> 00:17:21,160
prerequisite requirement for both of

415
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:22,959
those that's pretty much all I have I

416
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:24,069
don't know if I can use my extra time to

417
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,530
take questions now or if I should just

418
00:17:24,069 --> 00:17:28,770
hold that for later okay yeah thanks

419
00:17:26,530 --> 00:17:28,770
Rick

420
00:17:36,190 --> 00:17:43,090
thanks so much Manny Terry Bradshaw will

421
00:17:39,190 --> 00:17:44,650
be our next speaker he he's a research

422
00:17:43,090 --> 00:17:46,240
assistant professor at UVM and has

423
00:17:44,650 --> 00:17:48,700
worked his entire life in various

424
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:50,679
sectors of Vermont agriculture the bulk

425
00:17:48,700 --> 00:17:52,750
of his research and outreach program

426
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,460
focuses on sustainable pest and

427
00:17:52,750 --> 00:17:56,820
horticultural management specifically in

428
00:17:54,460 --> 00:18:00,039
orchards mostly apples and vineyards and

429
00:17:56,820 --> 00:18:03,850
includes both organic and conventional

430
00:18:00,039 --> 00:18:06,399
practices he received his PhD in plant

431
00:18:03,850 --> 00:18:08,620
soil science from UVM in 2015

432
00:18:06,399 --> 00:18:10,659
shortly after founding Catamount

433
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:13,179
educational firm which where the farmer

434
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:15,460
training program is housed and he serves

435
00:18:13,179 --> 00:18:17,529
as the specialty crops research and

436
00:18:15,460 --> 00:18:21,880
teaching laboratory at the UVM Hort farm

437
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:24,760
and he's some of your professor out here

438
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:29,230
so good take good notes it's gonna be on

439
00:18:24,760 --> 00:18:31,480
the quiz guys if there's extra seats can

440
00:18:29,230 --> 00:18:32,860
you take backpacks off and maybe ari

441
00:18:31,480 --> 00:18:36,029
could you just bring these three seats

442
00:18:32,860 --> 00:18:36,029
so over here please Thanks

443
00:19:09,820 --> 00:19:16,929
oh you do I don't need to give you okay

444
00:19:11,769 --> 00:19:17,289
I need to give me anything good all

445
00:19:16,929 --> 00:19:19,299
right

446
00:19:17,289 --> 00:19:22,989
hi everyone thanks for coming out

447
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:25,359
tonight it's in I don't know how we

448
00:19:22,989 --> 00:19:29,409
chose the order was alphabetical or not

449
00:19:25,359 --> 00:19:32,080
but it's organic is a is a very clear

450
00:19:29,409 --> 00:19:34,809
box I say that as someone who's been

451
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,940
certified on parts of the farm for 12 or

452
00:19:34,809 --> 00:19:38,799
13 years conventional is everything

453
00:19:36,940 --> 00:19:43,139
outside the box and these guys are more

454
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:46,299
fuzzy boxes I'm done No

455
00:19:43,139 --> 00:19:48,940
so I want to just highlight a few things

456
00:19:46,299 --> 00:19:52,899
that I that I wanted to talk about one

457
00:19:48,940 --> 00:19:55,659
being the concept of Agriculture I

458
00:19:52,899 --> 00:19:57,729
I teach on multiple levels but one of

459
00:19:55,659 --> 00:20:01,059
the things that I often kind of focus on

460
00:19:57,729 --> 00:20:04,389
is production scale agriculture where

461
00:20:01,059 --> 00:20:06,789
the marketing and the the economic

462
00:20:04,389 --> 00:20:08,289
livelihood is a key part of this this

463
00:20:06,789 --> 00:20:11,590
piece and that's a lot of what I teach

464
00:20:08,289 --> 00:20:13,450
too and what I kind of direct my various

465
00:20:11,590 --> 00:20:16,389
programs to it so I want to put a little

466
00:20:13,450 --> 00:20:19,149
asterisk there in terms of sort of part

467
00:20:16,389 --> 00:20:21,279
of my focus one thing I wanted to

468
00:20:19,149 --> 00:20:22,509
highlight this I love this picture here

469
00:20:21,279 --> 00:20:24,519
I took this in an orchard last year

470
00:20:22,509 --> 00:20:26,349
anybody have a guess as to why what that

471
00:20:24,519 --> 00:20:28,840
represents not counting those who were

472
00:20:26,349 --> 00:20:32,710
in my class last spring those are the

473
00:20:28,840 --> 00:20:34,960
three primary crop three most valuable

474
00:20:32,710 --> 00:20:39,700
crops in Vermont milk although it's a

475
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:43,989
beef cow maple and apples all in one

476
00:20:39,700 --> 00:20:45,639
shot anyway side note one thing that I

477
00:20:43,989 --> 00:20:47,590
also want to highlight and this has been

478
00:20:45,639 --> 00:20:50,919
something that I sort of have to deal

479
00:20:47,590 --> 00:20:53,229
with to some degree or other in in my my

480
00:20:50,919 --> 00:20:54,849
life of having one foot in the

481
00:20:53,229 --> 00:20:56,470
conventional if you want to call it that

482
00:20:54,849 --> 00:20:59,729
bucket and one foot in the organic

483
00:20:56,470 --> 00:21:03,369
bucket is this sense of tribalism and

484
00:20:59,729 --> 00:21:05,979
over the years I've noticed that at

485
00:21:03,369 --> 00:21:07,479
times particularly with people who

486
00:21:05,979 --> 00:21:11,529
aren't don't actually have their hands

487
00:21:07,479 --> 00:21:13,119
in the soil we divide more distinctly

488
00:21:11,529 --> 00:21:14,379
into our tribes and there's actually

489
00:21:13,119 --> 00:21:17,049
been a lot of research particularly done

490
00:21:14,379 --> 00:21:19,179
in the 70s that find that actually when

491
00:21:17,049 --> 00:21:20,710
once people find a tribe whatever that

492
00:21:19,179 --> 00:21:22,450
tribe might be could be your knitting

493
00:21:20,710 --> 00:21:23,290
group could be your you know fly-tying

494
00:21:22,450 --> 00:21:25,780
buddies

495
00:21:23,290 --> 00:21:28,090
you tend to avoid information from

496
00:21:25,780 --> 00:21:30,820
outside of your tribe and so I welcome

497
00:21:28,090 --> 00:21:32,980
forums like this and I welcome

498
00:21:30,820 --> 00:21:35,790
continuing the discussion so I want to

499
00:21:32,980 --> 00:21:40,390
highlight that little piece so

500
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:41,800
conventional agriculture I I looked up I

501
00:21:40,390 --> 00:21:44,320
just googled you know conventional

502
00:21:41,800 --> 00:21:47,650
agriculture took the first two Google

503
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,570
images right and then I also looked at

504
00:21:47,650 --> 00:21:53,050
the at one of the initial definitions

505
00:21:49,570 --> 00:21:54,880
that came out and from a pro pedia I

506
00:21:53,050 --> 00:21:56,440
don't know who APRA pedia is but I

507
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,680
mentioned conventional farming is known

508
00:21:56,440 --> 00:22:01,750
as industrial agriculture refers to

509
00:21:59,680 --> 00:22:03,280
farming based on continual inputs

510
00:22:01,750 --> 00:22:05,350
genetically modified organisms

511
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,680
concentrated animal feeding operations

512
00:22:05,350 --> 00:22:10,990
irrigation intensive tillage --is

513
00:22:07,680 --> 00:22:13,180
monoculture and that was really kind of

514
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:15,220
the focus and that's the not the first

515
00:22:13,180 --> 00:22:17,080
thing that I think about and anybody

516
00:22:15,220 --> 00:22:20,800
who's familiar with some of my talk to

517
00:22:17,080 --> 00:22:23,620
you the the concept of Monsanto gas-mask

518
00:22:20,800 --> 00:22:26,590
man is not what I think of when I think

519
00:22:23,620 --> 00:22:29,020
of conventional agriculture but it is

520
00:22:26,590 --> 00:22:32,470
what's pretty popular in you know the

521
00:22:29,020 --> 00:22:34,000
first Google hits so sometimes we have

522
00:22:32,470 --> 00:22:35,830
to work against this and sort of dispels

523
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:38,080
dispel this and also recognize to

524
00:22:35,830 --> 00:22:40,840
embrace parts of this that we do deal

525
00:22:38,080 --> 00:22:42,220
with this picture does drive me crazy

526
00:22:40,840 --> 00:22:45,130
because whatever that chemical is was

527
00:22:42,220 --> 00:22:50,530
banned back in 1992 so it's not even

528
00:22:45,130 --> 00:22:54,040
very appropriate for the common for

529
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:55,990
contemporary discussion but we have

530
00:22:54,040 --> 00:22:58,000
parts of this that that do fit into

531
00:22:55,990 --> 00:22:59,740
conventional agriculture however if you

532
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,060
look into some dictionary definitions

533
00:22:59,740 --> 00:23:05,830
the idea of conventional has more to do

534
00:23:04,060 --> 00:23:08,430
with what is generally done what are

535
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:13,090
most people doing and are most people

536
00:23:08,430 --> 00:23:15,190
doing bad things to grow food and I

537
00:23:13,090 --> 00:23:17,530
would say that the vast vast majority of

538
00:23:15,190 --> 00:23:19,570
people aren't doing bad things to grow

539
00:23:17,530 --> 00:23:21,390
food so Maddie had a good point of

540
00:23:19,570 --> 00:23:23,800
talking about negative versus positive

541
00:23:21,390 --> 00:23:25,570
connotations around organics you can say

542
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,860
the same thing about conventional so

543
00:23:25,570 --> 00:23:29,920
conventional is what most the farmers

544
00:23:26,860 --> 00:23:33,640
are doing and one thing I think about in

545
00:23:29,920 --> 00:23:36,070
terms of conventional is organic is in a

546
00:23:33,640 --> 00:23:36,519
box there's there's a NLP list and

547
00:23:36,070 --> 00:23:39,399
there's certain

548
00:23:36,519 --> 00:23:43,359
things you do conventional is not in a

549
00:23:39,399 --> 00:23:45,789
box and so we are free to try new things

550
00:23:43,359 --> 00:23:48,749
the innovates and we can be a little

551
00:23:45,789 --> 00:23:51,549
more responsive I think two challenges

552
00:23:48,749 --> 00:23:55,629
two potential solutions to challenges

553
00:23:51,549 --> 00:23:57,459
and because we're on the the front of

554
00:23:55,629 --> 00:24:00,009
that sometimes we make mistakes without

555
00:23:57,459 --> 00:24:02,379
question but we're not bound to an

556
00:24:00,009 --> 00:24:06,219
ideology first we're bound to whatever

557
00:24:02,379 --> 00:24:07,419
our particular principles might be one

558
00:24:06,219 --> 00:24:09,339
of the things is important to note here

559
00:24:07,419 --> 00:24:11,649
is there's nothing mutually exclusive

560
00:24:09,339 --> 00:24:15,190
between organic and conventional I can

561
00:24:11,649 --> 00:24:17,109
use Connect practices and materials all

562
00:24:15,190 --> 00:24:19,839
day long in my conventional or tricked

563
00:24:17,109 --> 00:24:21,369
in fact we do so that's an important

564
00:24:19,839 --> 00:24:23,529
thing too it's it's not a black or white

565
00:24:21,369 --> 00:24:25,389
mutually exclusive kind of kind of thing

566
00:24:23,529 --> 00:24:28,539
and I think we'll see this across the

567
00:24:25,389 --> 00:24:30,039
board so really at the end of the day

568
00:24:28,539 --> 00:24:33,789
what are we absolutely limited to

569
00:24:30,039 --> 00:24:35,049
whatever the laws are so then we have to

570
00:24:33,789 --> 00:24:36,399
make sure that we have good policies and

571
00:24:35,049 --> 00:24:38,889
good checks and balances to make sure

572
00:24:36,399 --> 00:24:41,289
that as society we make policies that

573
00:24:38,889 --> 00:24:44,229
that protect you know the environment

574
00:24:41,289 --> 00:24:45,849
the food supply farm workers and farmers

575
00:24:44,229 --> 00:24:50,979
so that people can afford to live and we

576
00:24:45,849 --> 00:24:53,469
can all eat any one of us can talk about

577
00:24:50,979 --> 00:24:56,409
these problems anybody who is looking at

578
00:24:53,469 --> 00:24:58,209
farming at the food supply knows we have

579
00:24:56,409 --> 00:25:01,029
an increase in population we have a

580
00:24:58,209 --> 00:25:03,489
decreasing labor supply we don't have

581
00:25:01,029 --> 00:25:05,609
any more land to grow on and students

582
00:25:03,489 --> 00:25:08,879
who've heard me often hear me say that

583
00:25:05,609 --> 00:25:11,529
our most limiting resource in

584
00:25:08,879 --> 00:25:13,029
agriculture is land even when we figure

585
00:25:11,529 --> 00:25:14,799
out the nitrogen and phosphorus issues

586
00:25:13,029 --> 00:25:15,820
100 years from now we're not gonna have

587
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:18,659
any more lay in fact we'll have less

588
00:25:15,820 --> 00:25:20,739
land certainly environmental degradation

589
00:25:18,659 --> 00:25:22,059
and climate change is going to impact

590
00:25:20,739 --> 00:25:24,729
all of these so we've all got some

591
00:25:22,059 --> 00:25:26,049
really big issues to solve or at least

592
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:30,450
continue working around we're never

593
00:25:26,049 --> 00:25:33,999
going to solve them but one thing that

594
00:25:30,450 --> 00:25:36,399
we think about in this you know this is

595
00:25:33,999 --> 00:25:39,399
a concept that sort of always been on my

596
00:25:36,399 --> 00:25:41,619
mind is the idea that came about 200

597
00:25:39,399 --> 00:25:43,959
years ago that at some point we're gonna

598
00:25:41,619 --> 00:25:45,399
run out of things to feed the mouse that

599
00:25:43,959 --> 00:25:48,849
we have and so anybody who's familiar

600
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:50,470
with mullets Theory knows that there was

601
00:25:48,849 --> 00:25:52,750
there was a theory that says if

602
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:54,970
we population will increase at a

603
00:25:52,750 --> 00:25:56,500
logarithmic rate food supply will

604
00:25:54,970 --> 00:25:58,330
increase at a geometric rate and

605
00:25:56,500 --> 00:26:00,640
eventually we're gonna we're not gonna

606
00:25:58,330 --> 00:26:02,830
have enough food and this was a real

607
00:26:00,640 --> 00:26:05,350
concern prior to the Industrial

608
00:26:02,830 --> 00:26:07,840
Revolution and would have been a concern

609
00:26:05,350 --> 00:26:11,440
if we weren't innovating in making for

610
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:14,309
better agriculture thankfully innovation

611
00:26:11,440 --> 00:26:18,039
moved it moved beyond this particular

612
00:26:14,309 --> 00:26:19,270
situation and we've generally kept pace

613
00:26:18,039 --> 00:26:20,830
that does not mean there hasn't been

614
00:26:19,270 --> 00:26:23,289
shortage of food doesn't mean that there

615
00:26:20,830 --> 00:26:28,120
aren't certain regional issues but

616
00:26:23,289 --> 00:26:30,309
generally speaking the productivity of

617
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:31,929
agriculture worldwide and I don't mean

618
00:26:30,309 --> 00:26:34,450
conventional agriculture because this

619
00:26:31,929 --> 00:26:37,030
started well before chemical agriculture

620
00:26:34,450 --> 00:26:39,220
came in people started to breed better

621
00:26:37,030 --> 00:26:41,200
plants people started to realize better

622
00:26:39,220 --> 00:26:46,000
ways to tend to their soil and we have

623
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:49,210
kept kept pace sometimes just barely and

624
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:51,370
not always evenly across the board

625
00:26:49,210 --> 00:26:53,350
around the world but we've been able to

626
00:26:51,370 --> 00:26:57,130
continue to feed people if we were

627
00:26:53,350 --> 00:26:59,620
growing food at the at the at the

628
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:02,320
production levels we were 200 years ago

629
00:26:59,620 --> 00:27:08,880
we would have run out of land a very

630
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:12,159
very long time ago but what happened so

631
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:15,429
around 1900 we discovered a way to make

632
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:19,720
nitrogen synthetically so in organic

633
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:21,220
systems this is not allowed and you can

634
00:27:19,720 --> 00:27:23,470
pretty much track agricultural

635
00:27:21,220 --> 00:27:24,640
production and population growth and

636
00:27:23,470 --> 00:27:27,820
pretty much plot it with the amount of

637
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:29,980
synthetic nitrogen we've made that's

638
00:27:27,820 --> 00:27:31,990
been good in that we've continued to

639
00:27:29,980 --> 00:27:34,690
feed the mouths of the people that get

640
00:27:31,990 --> 00:27:36,880
born in the world that's also very

641
00:27:34,690 --> 00:27:39,460
likely contributed to overpopulation in

642
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:42,340
the world so we are on a treadmill we

643
00:27:39,460 --> 00:27:44,590
are stuck with this system to where if

644
00:27:42,340 --> 00:27:46,539
we were to remove haber-bosch or

645
00:27:44,590 --> 00:27:49,240
synthetic nitrogen from the system there

646
00:27:46,539 --> 00:27:51,309
would not be enough food for about half

647
00:27:49,240 --> 00:27:53,409
the people on the earth it's it's a very

648
00:27:51,309 --> 00:27:55,690
gross overstatement but we would be in

649
00:27:53,409 --> 00:27:59,559
for a major problem so we've got to find

650
00:27:55,690 --> 00:28:01,890
ways to use this stuff the most

651
00:27:59,559 --> 00:28:04,419
efficiently which we're not doing

652
00:28:01,890 --> 00:28:06,549
generally

653
00:28:04,419 --> 00:28:08,289
and also ways to try to find other

654
00:28:06,549 --> 00:28:10,539
systems that will be more resilient so

655
00:28:08,289 --> 00:28:12,279
that we're not tied to milking every bit

656
00:28:10,539 --> 00:28:14,499
of natural gas out of the earth to just

657
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:15,489
continue to produce nitrogen so this is

658
00:28:14,499 --> 00:28:17,320
the problem and this is something that

659
00:28:15,489 --> 00:28:18,899
people are going to need to solve for

660
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:22,419
decades to come

661
00:28:18,899 --> 00:28:23,919
so when I think about conventional

662
00:28:22,419 --> 00:28:26,109
agriculture I think about as an

663
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:27,879
undergrad the term was sustainable

664
00:28:26,109 --> 00:28:31,059
agriculture that's that's not in vogue

665
00:28:27,879 --> 00:28:35,830
anymore but I still use the term and I

666
00:28:31,059 --> 00:28:39,100
go to Maguire from Washington State who

667
00:28:35,830 --> 00:28:41,529
came up with four key elements to

668
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:44,889
maintaining sustainable agricultural

669
00:28:41,529 --> 00:28:46,989
production make sure my times on so

670
00:28:44,889 --> 00:28:50,109
protect the soil whether you're organic

671
00:28:46,989 --> 00:28:52,570
or not it is key the soil is absolutely

672
00:28:50,109 --> 00:28:55,539
what we need to manage and when we ran

673
00:28:52,570 --> 00:29:00,609
into Dust Bowl conditions 80 some years

674
00:28:55,539 --> 00:29:03,609
ago that was a logical extension of very

675
00:29:00,609 --> 00:29:05,980
poor soil management so no matter how

676
00:29:03,609 --> 00:29:09,369
you're managing your farm you need to

677
00:29:05,980 --> 00:29:11,350
protect the soil maintain soil fertility

678
00:29:09,369 --> 00:29:14,710
if we're gonna take a piece of lands and

679
00:29:11,350 --> 00:29:16,659
we're gonna pull it out of wild

680
00:29:14,710 --> 00:29:18,039
condition because every farm is not wild

681
00:29:16,659 --> 00:29:21,039
although Keith might talk a little bit

682
00:29:18,039 --> 00:29:22,600
differently the but we are taking this

683
00:29:21,039 --> 00:29:23,769
piece of ground and we're saying we're

684
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:24,669
gonna alter this we're gonna do

685
00:29:23,769 --> 00:29:27,279
something with this and we're gonna

686
00:29:24,669 --> 00:29:29,049
remove it from the natural system we

687
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:32,049
better make sure that we're using that

688
00:29:29,049 --> 00:29:33,669
land appropriately so that we are

689
00:29:32,049 --> 00:29:36,220
maintaining the fertility to get the

690
00:29:33,669 --> 00:29:37,830
crops that we need for the effort we put

691
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:41,109
in and for the mouths we need to feed

692
00:29:37,830 --> 00:29:42,730
and that we're also replacing the

693
00:29:41,109 --> 00:29:44,379
fertility that we're removing and that's

694
00:29:42,730 --> 00:29:46,269
a key thing to remember every time you

695
00:29:44,379 --> 00:29:47,919
pull a crop off the soil you're pulling

696
00:29:46,269 --> 00:29:52,539
nutrients out of the soil so we need to

697
00:29:47,919 --> 00:29:54,999
maintain that use water efficiently this

698
00:29:52,539 --> 00:29:57,129
is one of Andrews points I don't think

699
00:29:54,999 --> 00:29:58,539
any of us in Vermont have a most of us

700
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:00,999
don't have too many issues with water

701
00:29:58,539 --> 00:30:03,279
he's based out of Eastern Washington

702
00:30:00,999 --> 00:30:04,749
worked very dry but it's something we

703
00:30:03,279 --> 00:30:07,149
need to think about and we need to also

704
00:30:04,749 --> 00:30:09,340
remember that the world is not Vermont

705
00:30:07,149 --> 00:30:10,840
the world is not even North America so

706
00:30:09,340 --> 00:30:12,190
just because we are blessed with

707
00:30:10,840 --> 00:30:14,259
generally speaking abundant water

708
00:30:12,190 --> 00:30:16,840
resources although the climate change

709
00:30:14,259 --> 00:30:17,799
they're changing quite a bit we need to

710
00:30:16,840 --> 00:30:19,210
always be thinking about this

711
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,649
how to design systems that are more

712
00:30:19,210 --> 00:30:25,539
resilient so we can we can maintain

713
00:30:22,649 --> 00:30:29,320
reasonable production and the health of

714
00:30:25,539 --> 00:30:32,639
the environment and then protect the

715
00:30:29,320 --> 00:30:34,690
crop and this is a key part that I feel

716
00:30:32,639 --> 00:30:36,369
differentiates conventional if you want

717
00:30:34,690 --> 00:30:39,700
to call conventional from other systems

718
00:30:36,369 --> 00:30:42,279
where we recognize that there's a

719
00:30:39,700 --> 00:30:45,369
certain amount of energy inputs human

720
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:47,559
labour capital that has gone into this

721
00:30:45,369 --> 00:30:49,360
crop and we need to make sure that we

722
00:30:47,559 --> 00:30:50,619
respect that by protecting the crop so

723
00:30:49,360 --> 00:30:52,450
that could be something as simple as

724
00:30:50,619 --> 00:30:54,070
hand picking we've done this in the

725
00:30:52,450 --> 00:30:55,480
organic orchards for years hand picking

726
00:30:54,070 --> 00:30:59,080
and some of the people in this room got

727
00:30:55,480 --> 00:31:01,809
to hands in various fruit loops out of

728
00:30:59,080 --> 00:31:03,669
our orchard sometimes that means firing

729
00:31:01,809 --> 00:31:06,369
up a sprayer this is in the ordinary

730
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:10,659
quarters Organic porters do not are not

731
00:31:06,369 --> 00:31:14,409
spray free necessarily sometimes that

732
00:31:10,659 --> 00:31:16,539
might mean using other tactics and so

733
00:31:14,409 --> 00:31:18,070
this is the classic IPM integrated pest

734
00:31:16,539 --> 00:31:20,859
management pyramid which looks very

735
00:31:18,070 --> 00:31:24,789
similar to the period that you see in

736
00:31:20,859 --> 00:31:26,559
various organic management texts - the

737
00:31:24,789 --> 00:31:28,480
effective chemical use at the tip

738
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,779
although there are some chemicals that

739
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:36,429
are used in organics but the key to have

740
00:31:31,779 --> 00:31:38,499
a healthy resilient well-designed pest

741
00:31:36,429 --> 00:31:41,289
management system is to work on all the

742
00:31:38,499 --> 00:31:43,059
stuff at the bottom so that you minimize

743
00:31:41,289 --> 00:31:45,909
this stuff at the tip and that's what

744
00:31:43,059 --> 00:31:47,440
good conventional growers do and I would

745
00:31:45,909 --> 00:31:51,669
even say the bulk least the ones that I

746
00:31:47,440 --> 00:31:53,769
know then we have some issues this is a

747
00:31:51,669 --> 00:31:58,029
picture mine my old boss took on the but

748
00:31:53,769 --> 00:32:00,850
on the back of a deck of her car we use

749
00:31:58,029 --> 00:32:04,210
as much as possible resistant varieties

750
00:32:00,850 --> 00:32:05,710
to try to maintain to prevent disease

751
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:07,059
before we have it or prevent insects

752
00:32:05,710 --> 00:32:08,940
before we have it so this is a Liberty

753
00:32:07,059 --> 00:32:12,340
next to a Macintosh and either one got

754
00:32:08,940 --> 00:32:14,649
fungicides one got apple scab one didn't

755
00:32:12,340 --> 00:32:18,210
this is a conventionally bred

756
00:32:14,649 --> 00:32:22,720
resistant variety sometimes you can have

757
00:32:18,210 --> 00:32:26,289
yep transgenic resistant varieties so

758
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:28,629
this is a field of of BT Bowl root bull

759
00:32:26,289 --> 00:32:30,409
worm resistant cotton on the on the left

760
00:32:28,629 --> 00:32:33,230
on the right

761
00:32:30,409 --> 00:32:35,720
non born resistant cotton and you can

762
00:32:33,230 --> 00:32:37,279
see that there's a major issue there in

763
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:39,500
certain parts of the world it may take

764
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:42,980
over 20 applications and pretty hot

765
00:32:39,500 --> 00:32:45,679
pesticides to keep bollworms off of the

766
00:32:42,980 --> 00:32:47,990
right so this is a this is a tactic

767
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:51,980
that's used by conventional farmers and

768
00:32:47,990 --> 00:32:55,100
it can be a controversial one one that I

769
00:32:51,980 --> 00:32:56,779
see that is coming up that I think is

770
00:32:55,100 --> 00:32:59,330
going to bubble up to the surface what

771
00:32:56,779 --> 00:33:02,029
we call GMO 2.0 so there's a new group

772
00:32:59,330 --> 00:33:04,759
of genetically modified crops that are

773
00:33:02,029 --> 00:33:08,480
not transgenic something that might be

774
00:33:04,759 --> 00:33:10,070
where they call CRISPR edited where the

775
00:33:08,480 --> 00:33:12,139
genes do not leave the particular

776
00:33:10,070 --> 00:33:14,200
species so there's now late blight

777
00:33:12,139 --> 00:33:17,240
resistant potatoes developed in England

778
00:33:14,200 --> 00:33:19,909
there are some groups in England in

779
00:33:17,240 --> 00:33:21,470
their organic or I wouldn't say they're

780
00:33:19,909 --> 00:33:23,480
not they're not organic because they

781
00:33:21,470 --> 00:33:25,429
can't plant these but some people are

782
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:29,899
saying you know this is a system where

783
00:33:25,429 --> 00:33:32,179
we can really save on the management of

784
00:33:29,899 --> 00:33:34,490
a devastating disease

785
00:33:32,179 --> 00:33:37,190
I wrote the numbers down here somewhere

786
00:33:34,490 --> 00:33:40,539
annual worldwide cost to manage late

787
00:33:37,190 --> 00:33:44,480
blight is in the 3 to 5 billion dollar

788
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:47,720
range between the sprays that are

789
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:49,159
applied and the loss of crops this is an

790
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:50,450
area that we're gonna see more changes

791
00:33:49,159 --> 00:33:53,240
and I think we're gonna see some real

792
00:33:50,450 --> 00:33:56,269
soul-searching around this around the

793
00:33:53,240 --> 00:34:00,110
use of modern breeding to avoid having

794
00:33:56,269 --> 00:34:02,600
to spray for pests and then find a piece

795
00:34:00,110 --> 00:34:04,220
that I added and I don't know this is

796
00:34:02,600 --> 00:34:05,750
officially in any conventional

797
00:34:04,220 --> 00:34:09,139
agriculture world but it's a guy who

798
00:34:05,750 --> 00:34:11,389
grew up on a dairy farm and it's a guy

799
00:34:09,139 --> 00:34:13,550
who works in orchards in with farmers

800
00:34:11,389 --> 00:34:16,149
and sees people day to day sometimes

801
00:34:13,550 --> 00:34:18,290
making a living sometimes not any

802
00:34:16,149 --> 00:34:20,690
sustainable agriculture system has to

803
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:22,159
absolutely provide a sustainable living

804
00:34:20,690 --> 00:34:24,319
for the farmer in and for their

805
00:34:22,159 --> 00:34:27,950
communities and so we always have to

806
00:34:24,319 --> 00:34:31,490
keep that in mind so a few examples of

807
00:34:27,950 --> 00:34:32,899
some of the growers that I work with not

808
00:34:31,490 --> 00:34:37,399
undersell you'd work with all them but

809
00:34:32,899 --> 00:34:40,639
these are all non organic farmers that I

810
00:34:37,399 --> 00:34:45,490
would consider progressive you know

811
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:50,540
really good conventional growers

812
00:34:45,490 --> 00:34:52,429
and I think my last slide one thing

813
00:34:50,540 --> 00:34:53,780
that's very HD as we think about soil

814
00:34:52,429 --> 00:34:55,879
health in the talk particularly about

815
00:34:53,780 --> 00:34:57,230
regenerative agriculture when I first

816
00:34:55,879 --> 00:34:59,420
started hearing about regenerative

817
00:34:57,230 --> 00:35:03,530
agriculture in soil health was about

818
00:34:59,420 --> 00:35:05,000
2000 2002 and it was not coming from the

819
00:35:03,530 --> 00:35:07,570
organic world it actually came from

820
00:35:05,000 --> 00:35:09,710
Heather Darby who was working with this

821
00:35:07,570 --> 00:35:11,030
organic Apple project but she was

822
00:35:09,710 --> 00:35:13,250
bringing me papers from the Upper

823
00:35:11,030 --> 00:35:15,470
Midwest and the Great Plains saying look

824
00:35:13,250 --> 00:35:18,710
at the stuff that's going on out there

825
00:35:15,470 --> 00:35:21,740
these are farmers that were that took it

826
00:35:18,710 --> 00:35:23,000
upon themselves largely to really start

827
00:35:21,740 --> 00:35:26,060
a revolution in terms of paying

828
00:35:23,000 --> 00:35:27,800
attention to soil health number one in

829
00:35:26,060 --> 00:35:30,650
terms of managing and making for a

830
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,770
sustainable farm even if you're a

831
00:35:30,650 --> 00:35:35,690
conventional farmer particularly

832
00:35:32,770 --> 00:35:38,930
multi-generational farmers you know that

833
00:35:35,690 --> 00:35:41,120
the soil is what is going to provide for

834
00:35:38,930 --> 00:35:43,420
you for decades and generations to come

835
00:35:41,120 --> 00:35:46,790
so this really is a focus of

836
00:35:43,420 --> 00:35:48,560
conventional agriculture as well this is

837
00:35:46,790 --> 00:35:51,020
a really bad Venn diagram but I'm

838
00:35:48,560 --> 00:35:52,580
stopping on that I tried to make for my

839
00:35:51,020 --> 00:35:54,140
AG policy class tried to show where we

840
00:35:52,580 --> 00:35:56,210
all fit all these bubbles could move

841
00:35:54,140 --> 00:35:59,390
around and I think that's part of the

842
00:35:56,210 --> 00:36:00,560
point is how much overlap there is some

843
00:35:59,390 --> 00:36:02,840
of these I don't even know where they

844
00:36:00,560 --> 00:36:04,310
should fit and I think that's kind of

845
00:36:02,840 --> 00:36:05,840
the point of this panel is we've got all

846
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:07,310
these names and conventionalist just

847
00:36:05,840 --> 00:36:10,580
because there's more acreage I didn't

848
00:36:07,310 --> 00:36:11,930
show you the scale of the acreage and I

849
00:36:10,580 --> 00:36:13,610
baby will come out of this with some

850
00:36:11,930 --> 00:36:16,640
some sense for whether or not the

851
00:36:13,610 --> 00:36:18,440
bubbles all overlap they separates and I

852
00:36:16,640 --> 00:36:22,350
welcome any discussion around that so

853
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:29,429
with that I'm done thank you

854
00:36:22,350 --> 00:36:29,429
[Applause]

855
00:36:40,430 --> 00:36:47,219
so Thank You Terry Cory Pierce is our

856
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:49,469
next speaker gonna address regenerative

857
00:36:47,219 --> 00:36:51,119
AG she's the owner and operator of bread

858
00:36:49,469 --> 00:36:54,180
and butter farm located on the town line

859
00:36:51,119 --> 00:36:55,920
of Shelburne in South Burlington you

860
00:36:54,180 --> 00:36:58,499
still have some seats left for burger

861
00:36:55,920 --> 00:37:00,269
night this Friday no yes

862
00:36:58,499 --> 00:37:01,559
if you okay so if you want to go check

863
00:37:00,269 --> 00:37:02,910
that out

864
00:37:01,559 --> 00:37:05,910
Brendan better farm is a diversified

865
00:37:02,910 --> 00:37:08,239
regenitive agricultural farm focused on

866
00:37:05,910 --> 00:37:11,839
diversity collaboration and engaging

867
00:37:08,239 --> 00:37:15,239
community in many ways through food art

868
00:37:11,839 --> 00:37:17,339
experiences music care and care for the

869
00:37:15,239 --> 00:37:27,180
land animals plants and one another so

870
00:37:17,339 --> 00:37:30,469
thanks for being here Corey yeah thanks

871
00:37:27,180 --> 00:37:41,400
it's always fun to engage in these

872
00:37:30,469 --> 00:37:43,650
panels all right so let's see I asked me

873
00:37:41,400 --> 00:37:46,829
to talk about regenerative agriculture

874
00:37:43,650 --> 00:37:49,380
and I I'd say that that certainly is a

875
00:37:46,829 --> 00:37:55,109
term that we kick around as a way to

876
00:37:49,380 --> 00:37:57,839
describe what we're doing I I liked the

877
00:37:55,109 --> 00:38:00,180
reference that you made Terry about like

878
00:37:57,839 --> 00:38:01,769
these this kind of tribalism mentality

879
00:38:00,180 --> 00:38:03,180
and kind of latching onto something I

880
00:38:01,769 --> 00:38:06,390
think that's something we do as humans

881
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:08,190
to kind of feel good about and support

882
00:38:06,390 --> 00:38:10,549
decisions that we make and things like

883
00:38:08,190 --> 00:38:13,499
that so I get that I'd say that I've

884
00:38:10,549 --> 00:38:16,589
worked personally pretty hard to try not

885
00:38:13,499 --> 00:38:20,369
to do that and try to you know just

886
00:38:16,589 --> 00:38:22,769
follow follow what I I feel is working

887
00:38:20,369 --> 00:38:24,779
through observation through just

888
00:38:22,769 --> 00:38:27,930
experience through learning from others

889
00:38:24,779 --> 00:38:30,499
as much as I can and I'd say that owning

890
00:38:27,930 --> 00:38:33,839
and operating a farm it it's

891
00:38:30,499 --> 00:38:35,369
simultaneously almost some ways harder

892
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,309
to do that because you're so down and

893
00:38:35,369 --> 00:38:39,900
focused in your world and and in some

894
00:38:38,309 --> 00:38:42,180
ways easier because now you're fully

895
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,210
emerged in that world and you're and

896
00:38:42,180 --> 00:38:47,099
it's and you know so so it it benefits

897
00:38:45,210 --> 00:38:49,680
you to try to stay has it really

898
00:38:47,099 --> 00:38:51,839
open-minded as you can about what what

899
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,559
is going to be the best practices for

900
00:38:51,839 --> 00:38:54,509
for

901
00:38:52,559 --> 00:38:57,569
sell for for the future for the world

902
00:38:54,509 --> 00:39:00,410
for your children etc so when I thought

903
00:38:57,569 --> 00:39:06,390
about how to talk about this tonight

904
00:39:00,410 --> 00:39:09,239
really how I how I my journey in farming

905
00:39:06,390 --> 00:39:11,849
has has is really dictated kind of where

906
00:39:09,239 --> 00:39:14,219
I am now at age 44 and being an owner of

907
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:16,410
a farm and trying to make a go of it as

908
00:39:14,219 --> 00:39:17,130
a business so I thought I'd talk about

909
00:39:16,410 --> 00:39:19,680
that

910
00:39:17,130 --> 00:39:22,739
so initially for me I did not grow up in

911
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:24,869
a family farm I was a kid who spent a

912
00:39:22,739 --> 00:39:27,989
ton of time outdoors and just naturally

913
00:39:24,869 --> 00:39:32,039
loved that and then when it came time to

914
00:39:27,989 --> 00:39:33,989
to get a job I was sort of panicked

915
00:39:32,039 --> 00:39:36,749
about needing to stay inside in the

916
00:39:33,989 --> 00:39:38,489
summertime and luckily found an

917
00:39:36,749 --> 00:39:41,579
opportunity to work on a farm as a

918
00:39:38,489 --> 00:39:43,709
20-acre so conventional vegetable and

919
00:39:41,579 --> 00:39:46,859
fruit farm in my hometown in New

920
00:39:43,709 --> 00:39:49,739
Hampshire and I literally instantly got

921
00:39:46,859 --> 00:39:51,630
hooked and I I loved with the things

922
00:39:49,739 --> 00:39:53,910
that it just grabbed me

923
00:39:51,630 --> 00:39:57,959
we're being outside we're working with a

924
00:39:53,910 --> 00:40:00,299
team were working hard I I've always

925
00:39:57,959 --> 00:40:02,819
been like very physically driven like

926
00:40:00,299 --> 00:40:05,160
the physic like engaging physically is

927
00:40:02,819 --> 00:40:07,859
something that's always excited me and

928
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:10,489
then I you know very quickly saw the

929
00:40:07,859 --> 00:40:13,109
community that was built around that

930
00:40:10,489 --> 00:40:15,150
certainly learning how to grow food

931
00:40:13,109 --> 00:40:18,839
seeing foods that I had never never

932
00:40:15,150 --> 00:40:21,239
known about before eating the freshest

933
00:40:18,839 --> 00:40:23,880
possible food was really fun and

934
00:40:21,239 --> 00:40:25,769
exciting seeing these farmers and and

935
00:40:23,880 --> 00:40:27,719
how they interacted with us as their

936
00:40:25,769 --> 00:40:29,130
crew be like let's make this great one

937
00:40:27,719 --> 00:40:30,689
shouldn't go out right out to the field

938
00:40:29,130 --> 00:40:33,539
and gather a bunch of stuff and then and

939
00:40:30,689 --> 00:40:35,789
cook it up was was certainly like whoa

940
00:40:33,539 --> 00:40:38,660
this is awesome like this is great so

941
00:40:35,789 --> 00:40:40,799
all of those things really hooked me I

942
00:40:38,660 --> 00:40:45,059
worked on that farm all through high

943
00:40:40,799 --> 00:40:46,619
school and then into college and really

944
00:40:45,059 --> 00:40:48,509
quickly was like I want to have a farm

945
00:40:46,619 --> 00:40:50,969
when I grow up but I kind of have this

946
00:40:48,509 --> 00:40:53,039
like idea that like farming is you know

947
00:40:50,969 --> 00:40:56,160
not necessarily seen as like a really

948
00:40:53,039 --> 00:40:58,859
you know good job you know it's not

949
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:01,739
something that people go seek out this

950
00:40:58,859 --> 00:41:03,269
is so this is in the early 90s and we

951
00:41:01,739 --> 00:41:05,219
have certainly come a long way and

952
00:41:03,269 --> 00:41:06,329
especially in Vermont New England of

953
00:41:05,219 --> 00:41:09,809
thinking about for

954
00:41:06,329 --> 00:41:12,900
in a new way but I you know it was hard

955
00:41:09,809 --> 00:41:14,640
for me to to like sort of articulate

956
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:16,170
like his farming an option is it's

957
00:41:14,640 --> 00:41:18,390
something that you can go and say I'm

958
00:41:16,170 --> 00:41:20,519
gonna be a farmer I wanna do this my

959
00:41:18,390 --> 00:41:22,229
parents certainly thought otherwise and

960
00:41:20,519 --> 00:41:24,509
we were like oh God in farming or

961
00:41:22,229 --> 00:41:28,529
seriously like what you know how she

962
00:41:24,509 --> 00:41:30,179
gonna do this but that was in me and it

963
00:41:28,529 --> 00:41:32,749
was like stuck in me and I started

964
00:41:30,179 --> 00:41:35,459
mulling that over like how do we do that

965
00:41:32,749 --> 00:41:37,769
how do I do that and and so then I

966
00:41:35,459 --> 00:41:39,719
started learning about agriculture like

967
00:41:37,769 --> 00:41:42,239
my only experience was this one farm and

968
00:41:39,719 --> 00:41:44,939
I loved it I loved the people I loved

969
00:41:42,239 --> 00:41:46,579
what it represented in our community but

970
00:41:44,939 --> 00:41:48,869
then I started you know in college

971
00:41:46,579 --> 00:41:51,029
started learning about the bigger scope

972
00:41:48,869 --> 00:41:54,359
of Agriculture and what agriculture has

973
00:41:51,029 --> 00:41:56,369
meant to the human race I started

974
00:41:54,359 --> 00:41:58,079
learning about environmental issues that

975
00:41:56,369 --> 00:42:02,339
we were facing that Terry talked about

976
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,809
again but specific to two so I was

977
00:42:02,339 --> 00:42:05,549
learning it like about all these big

978
00:42:03,809 --> 00:42:09,089
environmental issues but I started

979
00:42:05,549 --> 00:42:11,699
learning specifics around farming the

980
00:42:09,089 --> 00:42:14,880
loss of topsoil the reliance on fossil

981
00:42:11,699 --> 00:42:16,859
fuels chemicals and and what we are

982
00:42:14,880 --> 00:42:19,769
finally figuring out chemicals were

983
00:42:16,859 --> 00:42:22,319
doing to ourselves to our to the world

984
00:42:19,769 --> 00:42:24,749
all around us that that other countries

985
00:42:22,319 --> 00:42:26,789
were banning things that we weren't just

986
00:42:24,749 --> 00:42:31,319
all these things right and how

987
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:33,269
short-term it felt like we were you know

988
00:42:31,319 --> 00:42:35,219
there is this race that again Terry

989
00:42:33,269 --> 00:42:37,920
talked about of like populations growing

990
00:42:35,219 --> 00:42:39,719
food needs to grow we need to we need to

991
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:41,069
make it all happen but it's sort of like

992
00:42:39,719 --> 00:42:43,799
what comes first the chicken or the egg

993
00:42:41,069 --> 00:42:46,049
there we are we making more and more and

994
00:42:43,799 --> 00:42:47,729
more food in there for populating more

995
00:42:46,049 --> 00:42:49,890
and more and more or we like what it was

996
00:42:47,729 --> 00:42:51,719
you know and I'm not gonna answer those

997
00:42:49,890 --> 00:42:55,170
questions that's not for me to answer

998
00:42:51,719 --> 00:42:56,729
but I started just noticing those and

999
00:42:55,170 --> 00:43:01,739
questioning those and then reading books

1000
00:42:56,729 --> 00:43:04,469
about how agriculture is potentially the

1001
00:43:01,739 --> 00:43:07,140
downfall of the human race that being

1002
00:43:04,469 --> 00:43:09,900
able to grow so much food in one spot

1003
00:43:07,140 --> 00:43:12,630
one farmer can grow food for thousands

1004
00:43:09,900 --> 00:43:15,209
of people with the help of all these

1005
00:43:12,630 --> 00:43:18,880
man-made things as you know maybe not

1006
00:43:15,209 --> 00:43:22,960
the best thing for us as a as a as a

1007
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:25,450
species then I had a whole other journey

1008
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:27,880
around my own health and my own you know

1009
00:43:25,450 --> 00:43:31,450
understanding nutrition and what makes

1010
00:43:27,880 --> 00:43:33,340
my body feel the best and what you know

1011
00:43:31,450 --> 00:43:35,530
specific health issues I was seeing

1012
00:43:33,340 --> 00:43:38,140
people I knew and loved have and how

1013
00:43:35,530 --> 00:43:40,150
Olson there's like very clear connection

1014
00:43:38,140 --> 00:43:42,760
to the food that people were eating and

1015
00:43:40,150 --> 00:43:47,140
then how they were feeling diseases they

1016
00:43:42,760 --> 00:43:48,700
were suddenly getting and you know so

1017
00:43:47,140 --> 00:43:50,560
there's there's that whole thing I'm not

1018
00:43:48,700 --> 00:43:53,200
going to get go into all of that but I

1019
00:43:50,560 --> 00:43:57,400
had a very real personal journey on that

1020
00:43:53,200 --> 00:44:00,310
front and then started to kind of make

1021
00:43:57,400 --> 00:44:02,770
connections about this shift something

1022
00:44:00,310 --> 00:44:06,310
something that I asked I started asking

1023
00:44:02,770 --> 00:44:10,330
as a little kid constantly was why are

1024
00:44:06,310 --> 00:44:12,040
humans why are we this only species in

1025
00:44:10,330 --> 00:44:14,650
my eyes that seem like we are just

1026
00:44:12,040 --> 00:44:17,410
outside of the rest of the natural world

1027
00:44:14,650 --> 00:44:20,950
like why do we need to kind of carve out

1028
00:44:17,410 --> 00:44:23,260
our our world why are we so reliant on

1029
00:44:20,950 --> 00:44:25,450
things that are not just part of the

1030
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:28,990
natural world why have we created and

1031
00:44:25,450 --> 00:44:32,740
rely and then become reliant on so many

1032
00:44:28,990 --> 00:44:35,050
man-made things when I see out in the

1033
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,290
natural world so you know every other

1034
00:44:35,050 --> 00:44:39,820
species is like just live in and and and

1035
00:44:38,290 --> 00:44:43,320
doing their thing and some boom-and-bust

1036
00:44:39,820 --> 00:44:48,040
some some crash so I'm going stink some

1037
00:44:43,320 --> 00:44:50,290
you know have been here from forever but

1038
00:44:48,040 --> 00:44:53,050
why are humans and and when were humans

1039
00:44:50,290 --> 00:44:55,780
ever really naturally part of the world

1040
00:44:53,050 --> 00:44:58,540
and part of the natural world in a way

1041
00:44:55,780 --> 00:45:01,660
that was not just like cavemen you know

1042
00:44:58,540 --> 00:45:04,120
whatever you know so I I that was a

1043
00:45:01,660 --> 00:45:06,160
really big question for me as a kid and

1044
00:45:04,120 --> 00:45:07,900
then when I as I got older and start

1045
00:45:06,160 --> 00:45:10,630
thinking about agriculture in a deeper

1046
00:45:07,900 --> 00:45:12,970
way I started thinking about though you

1047
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:15,190
know that question came up again and

1048
00:45:12,970 --> 00:45:18,850
then it came into that into the form of

1049
00:45:15,190 --> 00:45:21,370
Agriculture like why do we have to grow

1050
00:45:18,850 --> 00:45:24,490
food in a way that is so clearly in a

1051
00:45:21,370 --> 00:45:27,160
box here is a farm this is how you do it

1052
00:45:24,490 --> 00:45:28,810
you run these big huge machines that we

1053
00:45:27,160 --> 00:45:30,400
had to make and then we had to extract

1054
00:45:28,810 --> 00:45:32,650
all this fossil fuel from the earth to

1055
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:35,470
drive and then we have to spray all this

1056
00:45:32,650 --> 00:45:39,130
on it to make it work when I see then

1057
00:45:35,470 --> 00:45:42,279
out in the forest a thriving beautiful

1058
00:45:39,130 --> 00:45:44,589
highly diverse bountiful amazing

1059
00:45:42,279 --> 00:45:47,710
ecosystem that is supporting life of all

1060
00:45:44,589 --> 00:45:49,480
kinds and so that was really confusing

1061
00:45:47,710 --> 00:45:51,250
to me and I see all this work whether

1062
00:45:49,480 --> 00:45:53,410
it's like actual physical work by the

1063
00:45:51,250 --> 00:45:54,940
humans or whether it's like work that

1064
00:45:53,410 --> 00:45:57,609
were channeling through big huge

1065
00:45:54,940 --> 00:45:59,980
machines to get done to make this thing

1066
00:45:57,609 --> 00:46:02,200
there's one thing and then again compare

1067
00:45:59,980 --> 00:46:05,740
it to the forest and the the diversity

1068
00:46:02,200 --> 00:46:07,240
the beauty the health and it just does

1069
00:46:05,740 --> 00:46:10,690
this juxtaposition that was very

1070
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:13,180
challenging for me to understand then I

1071
00:46:10,690 --> 00:46:15,549
started noticing that that all that

1072
00:46:13,180 --> 00:46:18,400
stuff over here that we were killing

1073
00:46:15,549 --> 00:46:20,859
ourselves to do or killing the earth to

1074
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:23,710
do is making one crop and it's usually

1075
00:46:20,859 --> 00:46:26,319
annual crops so what's the deal with why

1076
00:46:23,710 --> 00:46:28,720
are we putting why we trying so hard to

1077
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:30,250
make these annual crops these crops that

1078
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:32,049
just come and go and die and then we

1079
00:46:30,250 --> 00:46:32,950
just start over the whole next year come

1080
00:46:32,049 --> 00:46:34,720
and go and die

1081
00:46:32,950 --> 00:46:37,299
start over the next year and some years

1082
00:46:34,720 --> 00:46:39,220
they totally crash because even with all

1083
00:46:37,299 --> 00:46:41,140
the protection in the world that we as

1084
00:46:39,220 --> 00:46:42,910
humans try to give them some kind of

1085
00:46:41,140 --> 00:46:44,799
infestation happens some kind of disease

1086
00:46:42,910 --> 00:46:48,130
wipes it out some kind of something and

1087
00:46:44,799 --> 00:46:51,700
it's all done and then we're we're done

1088
00:46:48,130 --> 00:46:53,289
right and and now those questions are

1089
00:46:51,700 --> 00:46:55,809
just like mind-blowing to me right and

1090
00:46:53,289 --> 00:46:59,920
I'm trying to figure all of this out so

1091
00:46:55,809 --> 00:47:04,059
I start I mean while my like desire and

1092
00:46:59,920 --> 00:47:06,130
love for all of those things that I was

1093
00:47:04,059 --> 00:47:08,920
so excited about farming when I first

1094
00:47:06,130 --> 00:47:11,020
started as a teenager before I was mired

1095
00:47:08,920 --> 00:47:14,380
in all the depressing parts of like the

1096
00:47:11,020 --> 00:47:16,329
human situation I still had in me and I

1097
00:47:14,380 --> 00:47:18,130
still wanted that and I still wanted to

1098
00:47:16,329 --> 00:47:21,730
like figure out how to do this in a way

1099
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:24,250
that wasn't then like gonna just

1100
00:47:21,730 --> 00:47:26,819
contribute to all of these other parts

1101
00:47:24,250 --> 00:47:29,680
of farming and agriculture and human

1102
00:47:26,819 --> 00:47:31,420
craziness that that I was seeing and so

1103
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:34,690
and so I've lived in California I've

1104
00:47:31,420 --> 00:47:36,549
lived in Michigan farming and I've grew

1105
00:47:34,690 --> 00:47:38,890
up in the Northeast and now farming in

1106
00:47:36,549 --> 00:47:41,559
the Northeast so I've been luckily been

1107
00:47:38,890 --> 00:47:43,630
able to go on to so many types of farms

1108
00:47:41,559 --> 00:47:46,390
and in so many different parts of the

1109
00:47:43,630 --> 00:47:49,840
world or this country particular

1110
00:47:46,390 --> 00:47:52,570
and and really you know gotten to know a

1111
00:47:49,840 --> 00:47:55,260
lot of farmers who are doing so many

1112
00:47:52,570 --> 00:48:00,750
hugely different things and and seeing

1113
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:03,070
just every possible type of scenario and

1114
00:48:00,750 --> 00:48:04,810
you know and there's still so much more

1115
00:48:03,070 --> 00:48:08,230
to see and learn but I feel like I have

1116
00:48:04,810 --> 00:48:10,960
been lucky in order to get somewhat of a

1117
00:48:08,230 --> 00:48:13,660
perspective there and it was it's been

1118
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:15,700
very you know eye opening and I feel

1119
00:48:13,660 --> 00:48:17,620
like my journey is just at the very tip

1120
00:48:15,700 --> 00:48:20,380
of the iceburg still and I have the rest

1121
00:48:17,620 --> 00:48:22,710
of you know my short life to try and

1122
00:48:20,380 --> 00:48:26,050
learn as much as I can and pass that on

1123
00:48:22,710 --> 00:48:30,610
so you know I big ace basically began to

1124
00:48:26,050 --> 00:48:34,120
ask myself okay is it possible to be an

1125
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:36,910
ecological player to be side-by-side to

1126
00:48:34,120 --> 00:48:40,210
the soil to the plants to the animals to

1127
00:48:36,910 --> 00:48:43,510
my fellow humans in my community in an

1128
00:48:40,210 --> 00:48:46,540
equal balanced way like you would you

1129
00:48:43,510 --> 00:48:49,390
know in a in a rich thriving forest

1130
00:48:46,540 --> 00:48:53,110
ecosystem is it possible is it possible

1131
00:48:49,390 --> 00:48:54,700
to do that as a farm is it is a farm and

1132
00:48:53,110 --> 00:48:57,370
what is the definition of a farm as

1133
00:48:54,700 --> 00:49:00,100
we've been already hearing it's hugely

1134
00:48:57,370 --> 00:49:03,130
variable but can and so what that what

1135
00:49:00,100 --> 00:49:06,670
that quickly mean meant to me was can I

1136
00:49:03,130 --> 00:49:08,620
somehow get land can I somehow have a

1137
00:49:06,670 --> 00:49:12,700
business that can support my family

1138
00:49:08,620 --> 00:49:15,400
myself some employees my community you

1139
00:49:12,700 --> 00:49:18,940
know my neighbors can it blend in enough

1140
00:49:15,400 --> 00:49:20,680
and can it can it sustain itself and and

1141
00:49:18,940 --> 00:49:24,280
again I like what Terry said in always

1142
00:49:20,680 --> 00:49:26,320
both as a ecosystem but then also

1143
00:49:24,280 --> 00:49:30,490
economically is it is it gonna be viable

1144
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:34,150
and and that's that's that's where I am

1145
00:49:30,490 --> 00:49:37,960
now so nine years into having a farm the

1146
00:49:34,150 --> 00:49:39,940
the term regenerative agriculture is or

1147
00:49:37,960 --> 00:49:42,370
and I brought a book by Mark Sheppard

1148
00:49:39,940 --> 00:49:44,260
called restoration agriculture which I

1149
00:49:42,370 --> 00:49:48,190
like that term too and I continue to

1150
00:49:44,260 --> 00:49:50,890
learn about really challenges me

1151
00:49:48,190 --> 00:49:53,980
challenges us to think about perennial

1152
00:49:50,890 --> 00:49:56,560
systems that have longevity that rely on

1153
00:49:53,980 --> 00:49:58,360
an intensive diversity and certainly all

1154
00:49:56,560 --> 00:49:59,320
the things that the other speakers have

1155
00:49:58,360 --> 00:50:02,530
said carrying

1156
00:49:59,320 --> 00:50:06,670
the soil first and foremost but trying

1157
00:50:02,530 --> 00:50:09,430
to figure out how to to bring humans

1158
00:50:06,670 --> 00:50:12,910
back into a on an equal playing field

1159
00:50:09,430 --> 00:50:14,860
with our natural ecosystem with the

1160
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:17,440
animals so you know we have beef cattle

1161
00:50:14,860 --> 00:50:20,140
on our farm we have pigs we have a few

1162
00:50:17,440 --> 00:50:22,510
chickens we have perennial plants and we

1163
00:50:20,140 --> 00:50:25,240
do have annual plants and how can we

1164
00:50:22,510 --> 00:50:27,880
have all of those things intermix

1165
00:50:25,240 --> 00:50:31,240
together so that we're not reliant on

1166
00:50:27,880 --> 00:50:33,520
one one only over the other and how can

1167
00:50:31,240 --> 00:50:39,220
we work alongside all of those players

1168
00:50:33,520 --> 00:50:41,560
down to the microbes as as all super

1169
00:50:39,220 --> 00:50:43,810
important players to make healthy a

1170
00:50:41,560 --> 00:50:45,760
healthy farm system and that's our

1171
00:50:43,810 --> 00:50:52,030
journey yeah I think I'm I think I'm

1172
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:54,040
done let's see yeah I think if you have

1173
00:50:52,030 --> 00:50:56,750
a few other notes but I think that's

1174
00:50:54,040 --> 00:51:05,429
what I'm gonna say that that's it

1175
00:50:56,750 --> 00:51:05,429
[Applause]

1176
00:51:08,880 --> 00:51:13,690
Thank You Cory Keith Morris is our next

1177
00:51:12,700 --> 00:51:16,599
speaker he's going to talk about

1178
00:51:13,690 --> 00:51:19,300
permaculture he's has been applying his

1179
00:51:16,599 --> 00:51:21,010
lifelong love of nature and culture and

1180
00:51:19,300 --> 00:51:23,440
experience as an activist to

1181
00:51:21,010 --> 00:51:26,740
permaculture an ecological design since

1182
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:28,359
1996 he's spent over 20 years developing

1183
00:51:26,740 --> 00:51:31,330
permaculture with farms and schools

1184
00:51:28,359 --> 00:51:33,220
towns the digitus people activists in

1185
00:51:31,330 --> 00:51:36,130
solidarity with exploited populations

1186
00:51:33,220 --> 00:51:38,230
will crossing farm which is his firm I

1187
00:51:36,130 --> 00:51:40,450
put it up there wrong sorry it used to

1188
00:51:38,230 --> 00:51:42,490
be called Pacific rock it's Willa

1189
00:51:40,450 --> 00:51:44,440
crossing is Vermont's longest running

1190
00:51:42,490 --> 00:51:46,960
permaculture and agroforestry research

1191
00:51:44,440 --> 00:51:49,300
firm he is also the co-founder of the

1192
00:51:46,960 --> 00:52:01,480
permaculture Association of the

1193
00:51:49,300 --> 00:52:06,480
Northeast thanks thanks to my

1194
00:52:01,480 --> 00:52:09,790
co-panelists it's an honor to be here so

1195
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,710
Terence mentioned kind of neat boxes and

1196
00:52:09,790 --> 00:52:13,839
some of us having maybe fuzzier boxes

1197
00:52:11,710 --> 00:52:17,290
permaculture is probably one of the

1198
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:20,920
fuzziest boxes and/or frankly just

1199
00:52:17,290 --> 00:52:23,560
straight outside of the box and probably

1200
00:52:20,920 --> 00:52:27,210
I probably have the most work to do to

1201
00:52:23,560 --> 00:52:30,190
dispel myths or at least misconceptions

1202
00:52:27,210 --> 00:52:32,619
with the field that I'm representing and

1203
00:52:30,190 --> 00:52:34,960
especially as its interpreted in the

1204
00:52:32,619 --> 00:52:36,609
agricultural community first and

1205
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:39,130
foremost maybe I just like to kind of

1206
00:52:36,609 --> 00:52:41,830
help define permaculture and maybe

1207
00:52:39,130 --> 00:52:44,440
clarify that in essence really

1208
00:52:41,830 --> 00:52:46,630
permaculture is primarily a design

1209
00:52:44,440 --> 00:52:50,080
system and it's a design system that

1210
00:52:46,630 --> 00:52:51,490
uses the study of ecology to inform the

1211
00:52:50,080 --> 00:52:53,770
ways that we create relationships

1212
00:52:51,490 --> 00:52:57,400
between people and the things that we

1213
00:52:53,770 --> 00:52:59,859
depend on food centrally but also of

1214
00:52:57,400 --> 00:53:02,830
course water shelter energy waste

1215
00:52:59,859 --> 00:53:06,550
management etc so permaculture is is

1216
00:53:02,830 --> 00:53:08,560
very holistic from the outset and I can

1217
00:53:06,550 --> 00:53:10,330
say for you know some of my own journey

1218
00:53:08,560 --> 00:53:12,609
as a farmer and it's really nice to

1219
00:53:10,330 --> 00:53:14,319
follow quarry and kind of her story and

1220
00:53:12,609 --> 00:53:17,140
kind of personal

1221
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:20,799
struggle for self identity or species

1222
00:53:17,140 --> 00:53:22,779
role that we we all question right what

1223
00:53:20,799 --> 00:53:25,119
what is the role of human beings in the

1224
00:53:22,779 --> 00:53:26,619
world and and and at this time in place

1225
00:53:25,119 --> 00:53:28,719
we certainly have every reason to

1226
00:53:26,619 --> 00:53:30,309
question and wonder you know who we are

1227
00:53:28,719 --> 00:53:31,839
what we're meant to be doing and

1228
00:53:30,309 --> 00:53:35,289
certainly you know what is our

1229
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:37,390
relationship to each ecology right so so

1230
00:53:35,289 --> 00:53:41,199
thanks for that and and I can say the

1231
00:53:37,390 --> 00:53:42,880
person I really came to farming from the

1232
00:53:41,199 --> 00:53:45,459
place of an environmental activist and

1233
00:53:42,880 --> 00:53:48,579
really looking at our intersection with

1234
00:53:45,459 --> 00:53:51,160
food as that most immediate intersection

1235
00:53:48,579 --> 00:53:52,630
with the life around us and recognizing

1236
00:53:51,160 --> 00:53:54,849
that I wanted personally to take more

1237
00:53:52,630 --> 00:53:56,949
responsibility to that and wanted to

1238
00:53:54,849 --> 00:53:59,259
build a deeper relationship to that both

1239
00:53:56,949 --> 00:54:01,779
in terms of species and places and the

1240
00:53:59,259 --> 00:54:06,069
other people who also contribute to to

1241
00:54:01,779 --> 00:54:09,309
feeding me and and us so one of the kind

1242
00:54:06,069 --> 00:54:11,469
of misconceptions which isn't it's easy

1243
00:54:09,309 --> 00:54:13,779
to understand why permaculture is often

1244
00:54:11,469 --> 00:54:17,589
associated almost entirely with things

1245
00:54:13,779 --> 00:54:19,900
like forest gardening and herb spirals

1246
00:54:17,589 --> 00:54:22,390
and chicken tractors and all these

1247
00:54:19,900 --> 00:54:24,579
things are pretty cool things but much

1248
00:54:22,390 --> 00:54:27,130
more importantly is the thinking behind

1249
00:54:24,579 --> 00:54:29,380
how we create relationships between the

1250
00:54:27,130 --> 00:54:31,599
parts of a system and looking in fact to

1251
00:54:29,380 --> 00:54:33,819
ecology as the model for how these

1252
00:54:31,599 --> 00:54:34,749
relationships are as mutually beneficial

1253
00:54:33,819 --> 00:54:37,569
as possible

1254
00:54:34,749 --> 00:54:40,719
so for instance again Terence mentioned

1255
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:42,640
like picking apples by hand out of an

1256
00:54:40,719 --> 00:54:45,489
orchard and so you have a really great

1257
00:54:42,640 --> 00:54:48,690
jump on getting any Pugh paiting pests

1258
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:51,999
out of the orchard system before they

1259
00:54:48,690 --> 00:54:54,489
reproduce and I've had that job and it's

1260
00:54:51,999 --> 00:54:57,219
you know better than other jobs but it

1261
00:54:54,489 --> 00:54:59,349
isn't my ecological niche it isn't I

1262
00:54:57,219 --> 00:55:02,249
don't thrive picking up wormy Apple

1263
00:54:59,349 --> 00:55:05,650
drops in the floor of the orchard and

1264
00:55:02,249 --> 00:55:07,900
chickens and pigs really do enjoy

1265
00:55:05,650 --> 00:55:08,709
picking apple drops out of the floor of

1266
00:55:07,900 --> 00:55:10,749
orchards

1267
00:55:08,709 --> 00:55:13,630
and so of course there's regulatory

1268
00:55:10,749 --> 00:55:16,809
issues about grazing and fruit

1269
00:55:13,630 --> 00:55:19,239
production so I'm not going to get into

1270
00:55:16,809 --> 00:55:20,650
that terrain but that is one example of

1271
00:55:19,239 --> 00:55:22,749
the types of relationships that we're

1272
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:24,509
looking to foster where trees are not

1273
00:55:22,749 --> 00:55:27,859
only having pest control and

1274
00:55:24,509 --> 00:55:30,499
fertilization and management but

1275
00:55:27,859 --> 00:55:34,160
also you know being met some of their

1276
00:55:30,499 --> 00:55:36,470
needs in terms of food so at its at its

1277
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,569
heart permaculture is a vision and

1278
00:55:36,470 --> 00:55:41,059
that's a vision of ecological

1279
00:55:38,569 --> 00:55:43,069
regeneration and you know regenerative

1280
00:55:41,059 --> 00:55:45,319
agriculture I would I would firmly place

1281
00:55:43,069 --> 00:55:47,420
within the umbrella of permaculture and

1282
00:55:45,319 --> 00:55:49,309
there's definitely people outside of it

1283
00:55:47,420 --> 00:55:50,809
I think that bubble diagram well you

1284
00:55:49,309 --> 00:55:52,849
know there's a lot of room to shift and

1285
00:55:50,809 --> 00:55:54,109
grow these bubbles I think it's really

1286
00:55:52,849 --> 00:55:56,480
interesting to look at where we see

1287
00:55:54,109 --> 00:55:59,299
these types of overlap and especially in

1288
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,700
the fashion as employed by Mark Sheppard

1289
00:55:59,299 --> 00:56:03,950
and this and this new term restoration

1290
00:56:01,700 --> 00:56:06,049
agriculture I mean that book is a

1291
00:56:03,950 --> 00:56:07,759
permaculture text and written by a

1292
00:56:06,049 --> 00:56:10,099
permaculture teacher and it is very

1293
00:56:07,759 --> 00:56:13,190
little other than permaculture in the

1294
00:56:10,099 --> 00:56:15,470
specific application to like Agri

1295
00:56:13,190 --> 00:56:19,789
forestry based grazing systems carbon

1296
00:56:15,470 --> 00:56:22,309
sequestration via agriculture and really

1297
00:56:19,789 --> 00:56:24,349
that that in the particular case of Mark

1298
00:56:22,309 --> 00:56:26,749
Sheppard kind of encouraging

1299
00:56:24,349 --> 00:56:28,670
permaculture minded folks to move out of

1300
00:56:26,749 --> 00:56:31,220
their yards and homesteads

1301
00:56:28,670 --> 00:56:33,739
into like co-op scale production with

1302
00:56:31,220 --> 00:56:35,660
tree crops and grazing systems and more

1303
00:56:33,739 --> 00:56:37,460
diversified agriculture and especially

1304
00:56:35,660 --> 00:56:41,259
in the case of Mark Sheppard and his

1305
00:56:37,460 --> 00:56:43,069
farm the earth work and water management

1306
00:56:41,259 --> 00:56:45,650
strategies that we learned from

1307
00:56:43,069 --> 00:56:47,420
permaculture and that's one of the

1308
00:56:45,650 --> 00:56:48,950
pieces that I guess I want to kind of

1309
00:56:47,420 --> 00:56:51,349
add to this conversation is I think

1310
00:56:48,950 --> 00:56:53,440
we're so popularly associated with

1311
00:56:51,349 --> 00:56:56,359
permaculture being really the

1312
00:56:53,440 --> 00:56:59,420
application of ecology so permaculture

1313
00:56:56,359 --> 00:57:01,759
as a as a as an academic pursuit really

1314
00:56:59,420 --> 00:57:03,739
comes from the school of ecology in part

1315
00:57:01,759 --> 00:57:05,359
and saying instead of a descriptive

1316
00:57:03,739 --> 00:57:07,519
science where we imagine ourselves

1317
00:57:05,359 --> 00:57:10,249
outside the natural world and talk about

1318
00:57:07,519 --> 00:57:13,069
what we see we recognize as Cory

1319
00:57:10,249 --> 00:57:15,109
mentioned like we are in the natural

1320
00:57:13,069 --> 00:57:16,630
world and have a place in the natural

1321
00:57:15,109 --> 00:57:19,489
world and have a very interesting

1322
00:57:16,630 --> 00:57:20,869
cultural dissociation at the moment

1323
00:57:19,489 --> 00:57:24,829
imagining ourselves as something other

1324
00:57:20,869 --> 00:57:27,109
than or different from and as we move

1325
00:57:24,829 --> 00:57:30,529
into that recognition that we are in

1326
00:57:27,109 --> 00:57:32,599
obligation relation to ecology we take

1327
00:57:30,529 --> 00:57:36,109
the text of ecology from being

1328
00:57:32,599 --> 00:57:38,839
descriptive text to being applied right

1329
00:57:36,109 --> 00:57:40,220
and we look at how ecology informs how

1330
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:40,730
do we go to the bathroom how do we take

1331
00:57:40,220 --> 00:57:41,349
a shower

1332
00:57:40,730 --> 00:57:43,420
what do we

1333
00:57:41,349 --> 00:57:46,569
how do we build our homes and of course

1334
00:57:43,420 --> 00:57:48,729
that always takes very place specific

1335
00:57:46,569 --> 00:57:50,470
shape and that is one of the most

1336
00:57:48,729 --> 00:57:52,299
beautiful things about permaculture that

1337
00:57:50,470 --> 00:57:54,630
I try to add to this conversation is

1338
00:57:52,299 --> 00:57:58,479
that in addition to applied ecology

1339
00:57:54,630 --> 00:58:01,960
really more so permaculture is frankly

1340
00:57:58,479 --> 00:58:06,460
applied anthropology or applied ethno

1341
00:58:01,960 --> 00:58:09,460
biology where we really study the best

1342
00:58:06,460 --> 00:58:11,220
practices that have emerged in all of

1343
00:58:09,460 --> 00:58:13,559
the communities all over the world

1344
00:58:11,220 --> 00:58:16,989
historically pre historically

1345
00:58:13,559 --> 00:58:19,960
archaeologically and with a specific nod

1346
00:58:16,989 --> 00:58:21,640
to the incredible sustainability of many

1347
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:24,789
indigenous cultures that certainly

1348
00:58:21,640 --> 00:58:27,849
explicitly expire inspired permaculture

1349
00:58:24,789 --> 00:58:30,369
design I mean in fact permaculture

1350
00:58:27,849 --> 00:58:33,819
really at its outset as a coined phrase

1351
00:58:30,369 --> 00:58:35,680
is an effort to heal the trauma between

1352
00:58:33,819 --> 00:58:38,979
colonists and indigenous peoples

1353
00:58:35,680 --> 00:58:43,210
in Australia and in fact to recognize

1354
00:58:38,979 --> 00:58:45,249
that that power imbalance is incredible

1355
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:47,200
and we have a lot to learn not only from

1356
00:58:45,249 --> 00:58:49,420
indigenous philosophy but indigenous

1357
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:50,769
practice and indigenous crops in

1358
00:58:49,420 --> 00:58:53,109
particular especially in the case of

1359
00:58:50,769 --> 00:58:54,819
Australia where literally European

1360
00:58:53,109 --> 00:58:56,049
Australia's arrived and they said there

1361
00:58:54,819 --> 00:58:58,989
is nothing to eat here

1362
00:58:56,049 --> 00:59:01,809
we cannot survive without importing the

1363
00:58:58,989 --> 00:59:04,539
combined cultivated diversity of the

1364
00:59:01,809 --> 00:59:07,019
world and bringing in animals and plants

1365
00:59:04,539 --> 00:59:10,239
and every other food stuff from other

1366
00:59:07,019 --> 00:59:11,979
ecosystems meanwhile Aboriginal

1367
00:59:10,239 --> 00:59:13,989
Australians of course were fermenting

1368
00:59:11,979 --> 00:59:16,329
poisonous plants into their nourishment

1369
00:59:13,989 --> 00:59:18,940
and building Weir's and elaborate traps

1370
00:59:16,329 --> 00:59:21,069
of tidal fish catch and really

1371
00:59:18,940 --> 00:59:23,469
ingeniously meeting their needs from

1372
00:59:21,069 --> 00:59:24,910
nothing other than that ecosystem but it

1373
00:59:23,469 --> 00:59:27,450
is very interesting that you know in the

1374
00:59:24,910 --> 00:59:30,190
world of agriculture in this now global

1375
00:59:27,450 --> 00:59:31,869
recombinant ecology that we have you

1376
00:59:30,190 --> 00:59:33,670
know Australia offers almost nothing to

1377
00:59:31,869 --> 00:59:36,279
our palette of plants you know we don't

1378
00:59:33,670 --> 00:59:39,609
we don't find much kangaroo meat on the

1379
00:59:36,279 --> 00:59:41,799
shelves right and so that's a big part

1380
00:59:39,609 --> 00:59:44,529
of where permaculture comes is saying ok

1381
00:59:41,799 --> 00:59:46,150
you know we have a lot to learn from

1382
00:59:44,529 --> 00:59:49,509
indigenous culture indigenous

1383
00:59:46,150 --> 00:59:52,119
perspective but also and explicitly from

1384
00:59:49,509 --> 00:59:54,289
its outset permaculture is looking to

1385
00:59:52,119 --> 00:59:56,660
this you know postmodern reality

1386
00:59:54,289 --> 00:59:58,849
which I bristle at the phrase personally

1387
00:59:56,660 --> 01:00:03,099
but so I need to qualify and what I mean

1388
00:59:58,849 --> 01:00:05,689
is explicitly recognizing soil erosion

1389
01:00:03,099 --> 01:00:08,509
explicitly recognizing toxicity

1390
01:00:05,689 --> 01:00:11,119
explicitly recognizing peak oil and

1391
01:00:08,509 --> 01:00:13,459
climate change and so for 40 years

1392
01:00:11,119 --> 01:00:15,319
permaculture has been explicitly

1393
01:00:13,459 --> 01:00:18,619
oriented in these directions and

1394
01:00:15,319 --> 01:00:20,719
essentially categorizing the human

1395
01:00:18,619 --> 01:00:22,789
endeavor in saying well we need to meet

1396
01:00:20,719 --> 01:00:24,769
our needs and we need to meet our needs

1397
01:00:22,789 --> 01:00:27,069
in ways that actually increase

1398
01:00:24,769 --> 01:00:30,369
ecological health and actually take

1399
01:00:27,069 --> 01:00:33,919
responsibility for our toxic legacy and

1400
01:00:30,369 --> 01:00:36,769
the problems of totalitarian agriculture

1401
01:00:33,919 --> 01:00:39,319
and clear cuts and recognizing that if

1402
01:00:36,769 --> 01:00:41,839
we go beyond you know certain

1403
01:00:39,319 --> 01:00:44,299
perspectives of history we can look

1404
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:46,699
deeply and recognize that when it comes

1405
01:00:44,299 --> 01:00:49,249
to major civilizations based on agro

1406
01:00:46,699 --> 01:00:52,939
annual agriculture they have never done

1407
01:00:49,249 --> 01:00:55,759
anything but destroy ecosystems create

1408
01:00:52,939 --> 01:00:57,489
deserts and eventually collapse and only

1409
01:00:55,759 --> 01:01:00,499
very recently with the aid of

1410
01:00:57,489 --> 01:01:03,799
essentially fossil fuels can we pretend

1411
01:01:00,499 --> 01:01:06,499
that that path of agriculture is going

1412
01:01:03,799 --> 01:01:08,299
to continue to feed us and while I think

1413
01:01:06,499 --> 01:01:10,449
we need to recognize you know this

1414
01:01:08,299 --> 01:01:12,319
incredible imbalance of power in

1415
01:01:10,449 --> 01:01:14,119
agriculture in the United States in

1416
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:18,650
particular I don't think we need to

1417
01:01:14,119 --> 01:01:20,779
judge or attack our IPM or conventional

1418
01:01:18,650 --> 01:01:23,539
agriculture neighbors and to be honest

1419
01:01:20,779 --> 01:01:25,759
as a permaculturist who is at you know

1420
01:01:23,539 --> 01:01:28,069
production scale with various components

1421
01:01:25,759 --> 01:01:30,140
of our farm I frankly have a lot more to

1422
01:01:28,069 --> 01:01:33,019
learn from folks who might identify in

1423
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:36,529
the conventional a global often and and

1424
01:01:33,019 --> 01:01:38,659
and then I think there's also something

1425
01:01:36,529 --> 01:01:40,369
to be said about organic coming

1426
01:01:38,659 --> 01:01:43,099
essentially from this act of resistance

1427
01:01:40,369 --> 01:01:46,369
also as permaculture did in this

1428
01:01:43,099 --> 01:01:48,679
solidarity that we find and when we have

1429
01:01:46,369 --> 01:01:51,140
for instance NOFA conferences you have

1430
01:01:48,679 --> 01:01:52,999
like full access open source I mean

1431
01:01:51,140 --> 01:01:56,419
basically everyone goes out every year

1432
01:01:52,999 --> 01:01:59,059
innovates finds ways to have better more

1433
01:01:56,419 --> 01:02:01,249
efficient production and then completely

1434
01:01:59,059 --> 01:02:03,499
shares the best develop secrets like

1435
01:02:01,249 --> 01:02:06,150
every winter here and you know recently

1436
01:02:03,499 --> 01:02:08,670
here at UVM every February

1437
01:02:06,150 --> 01:02:10,440
so you know all of this I think is a

1438
01:02:08,670 --> 01:02:11,940
part of the dialogue that permaculture

1439
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:14,310
wants to have with the agricultural

1440
01:02:11,940 --> 01:02:17,730
community and also recognizing that as a

1441
01:02:14,310 --> 01:02:20,160
design system we work with systems that

1442
01:02:17,730 --> 01:02:22,250
utilize tillage that you know utilize

1443
01:02:20,160 --> 01:02:25,020
conventional agriculture that utilize

1444
01:02:22,250 --> 01:02:27,330
spraying and other things and in part of

1445
01:02:25,020 --> 01:02:29,820
that you know ecosystem relationship

1446
01:02:27,330 --> 01:02:32,130
between the parts are work my work is is

1447
01:02:29,820 --> 01:02:34,230
often just figuring out like how in a

1448
01:02:32,130 --> 01:02:37,590
whole farm system you know is the

1449
01:02:34,230 --> 01:02:40,220
greenhouse best located or where would a

1450
01:02:37,590 --> 01:02:43,680
vineyard system or trellis system or

1451
01:02:40,220 --> 01:02:45,750
water catchment system go in relation

1452
01:02:43,680 --> 01:02:47,550
best relation to all the parts around it

1453
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:49,350
and I think there is a lot to be learned

1454
01:02:47,550 --> 01:02:51,450
from like our techniques that we are

1455
01:02:49,350 --> 01:02:53,940
popularly associated in terms of like

1456
01:02:51,450 --> 01:02:56,250
edible forest gardening and really most

1457
01:02:53,940 --> 01:02:57,780
recently kind of especially diving into

1458
01:02:56,250 --> 01:02:59,280
the some of nitty-gritty of carbon

1459
01:02:57,780 --> 01:03:02,280
farming and tree crops and agroforestry

1460
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:04,470
more generally but also you know these

1461
01:03:02,280 --> 01:03:07,170
probably Universal techniques at this

1462
01:03:04,470 --> 01:03:09,600
point like bioremediation right

1463
01:03:07,170 --> 01:03:12,240
addressing toxicity like carbon

1464
01:03:09,600 --> 01:03:14,730
sequestration like increasing the

1465
01:03:12,240 --> 01:03:16,770
diversity in our food system with an

1466
01:03:14,730 --> 01:03:19,080
intergenerational perspective and making

1467
01:03:16,770 --> 01:03:21,360
sure we not only have you know access to

1468
01:03:19,080 --> 01:03:24,270
incredible cultivated diversity of

1469
01:03:21,360 --> 01:03:26,760
normal vegetables and animals but like

1470
01:03:24,270 --> 01:03:28,620
rarer fruits and nuts some of which have

1471
01:03:26,760 --> 01:03:31,230
been cultivated cultivated in this area

1472
01:03:28,620 --> 01:03:35,100
for ten plus thousand years potentially

1473
01:03:31,230 --> 01:03:36,840
in a in a participatory ecology fashion

1474
01:03:35,100 --> 01:03:38,490
right especially when we look at nuts

1475
01:03:36,840 --> 01:03:41,190
and then we look at the distribution of

1476
01:03:38,490 --> 01:03:44,370
nuts and we recognize this isn't a

1477
01:03:41,190 --> 01:03:46,530
natural phenomenon the distribution of

1478
01:03:44,370 --> 01:03:49,320
nuts is the phenomenon of human beings

1479
01:03:46,530 --> 01:03:51,720
who were in large part not eaters

1480
01:03:49,320 --> 01:03:55,440
carrying boatloads of nuts through all

1481
01:03:51,720 --> 01:03:58,800
the river systems and lake ways and you

1482
01:03:55,440 --> 01:04:01,290
know creating an ecosystem via by and

1483
01:03:58,800 --> 01:04:03,840
which frankly we all do everyday

1484
01:04:01,290 --> 01:04:06,570
especially as eaters that is what we do

1485
01:04:03,840 --> 01:04:09,480
is we create ecosystems so the request

1486
01:04:06,570 --> 01:04:11,370
of permaculture is to bring the science

1487
01:04:09,480 --> 01:04:15,270
of ecology and evolution as well as

1488
01:04:11,370 --> 01:04:17,760
ethno biology and ethnobotany and ethnos

1489
01:04:15,270 --> 01:04:19,950
zoology and say how do we do this best

1490
01:04:17,760 --> 01:04:22,109
and how do we do this best

1491
01:04:19,950 --> 01:04:23,970
in this modern world where our food

1492
01:04:22,109 --> 01:04:26,660
plants and animals have come from all

1493
01:04:23,970 --> 01:04:29,700
over the world and we are by default

1494
01:04:26,660 --> 01:04:31,740
creating recombinant Ecology's and how

1495
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:34,319
do we create these recombinant Ecology's

1496
01:04:31,740 --> 01:04:36,470
as wisely as possible with our only hope

1497
01:04:34,319 --> 01:04:39,359
to know what's wise potentially being

1498
01:04:36,470 --> 01:04:43,079
looking intergenerationally and saying

1499
01:04:39,359 --> 01:04:44,670
how do we leave deeper soil more suited

1500
01:04:43,079 --> 01:04:47,579
to produce food in the future rather

1501
01:04:44,670 --> 01:04:50,010
than less right how do we leave cleaner

1502
01:04:47,579 --> 01:04:53,819
water and in this very specific moment

1503
01:04:50,010 --> 01:04:56,609
in time how do we leave this peak of our

1504
01:04:53,819 --> 01:04:58,530
access to energy in the best legacy

1505
01:04:56,609 --> 01:05:00,960
possible which i think we'd all agree

1506
01:04:58,530 --> 01:05:03,869
isn't more pavement more parking lots

1507
01:05:00,960 --> 01:05:05,790
more places where we can't grow food but

1508
01:05:03,869 --> 01:05:08,069
also we have this very unique moment in

1509
01:05:05,790 --> 01:05:09,930
history where we can use machines to

1510
01:05:08,069 --> 01:05:12,510
install appropriate water catchment

1511
01:05:09,930 --> 01:05:15,089
systems or terraced hillsides or create

1512
01:05:12,510 --> 01:05:18,450
really good food producing ponds that

1513
01:05:15,089 --> 01:05:22,349
keep nutrients out of our wild waterways

1514
01:05:18,450 --> 01:05:24,990
and also invest our energy at moment in

1515
01:05:22,349 --> 01:05:26,880
infrastructure like greenhouses and root

1516
01:05:24,990 --> 01:05:29,910
cellars and food processing facilities

1517
01:05:26,880 --> 01:05:31,799
that quite frankly only a generation or

1518
01:05:29,910 --> 01:05:33,569
two in the future most likely won't have

1519
01:05:31,799 --> 01:05:35,970
access to the same resources and

1520
01:05:33,569 --> 01:05:38,730
materials to do so how do we do this

1521
01:05:35,970 --> 01:05:40,799
with a very deep intergenerational

1522
01:05:38,730 --> 01:05:43,349
perspective which is which is you know

1523
01:05:40,799 --> 01:05:44,970
not to overly simplify all of the varied

1524
01:05:43,349 --> 01:05:46,829
wisdom that we learn from indigenous

1525
01:05:44,970 --> 01:05:48,450
cultures the world over but certainly

1526
01:05:46,829 --> 01:05:50,490
one thing that seems to be in common

1527
01:05:48,450 --> 01:05:53,280
from the most successful cultures on the

1528
01:05:50,490 --> 01:05:54,119
planet that is their intergenerational

1529
01:05:53,280 --> 01:05:57,030
responsibility and their

1530
01:05:54,119 --> 01:05:58,770
intergenerational perspective so in

1531
01:05:57,030 --> 01:06:01,170
closing the last thing I want to say is

1532
01:05:58,770 --> 01:06:03,569
really also where permaculture most

1533
01:06:01,170 --> 01:06:05,880
excitedly to me joins this conversation

1534
01:06:03,569 --> 01:06:08,040
is to look beyond our fields and

1535
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:10,680
certainly our farm systems you know

1536
01:06:08,040 --> 01:06:12,390
permaculture offers a lot to them but

1537
01:06:10,680 --> 01:06:14,369
really permaculture enters this dialogue

1538
01:06:12,390 --> 01:06:16,589
about like how do we feed growing

1539
01:06:14,369 --> 01:06:18,540
populations and all the arable land in

1540
01:06:16,589 --> 01:06:21,180
the world can only feed you know so many

1541
01:06:18,540 --> 01:06:22,890
people to say well forget all the arable

1542
01:06:21,180 --> 01:06:25,440
land in the world let's look to our

1543
01:06:22,890 --> 01:06:27,720
yards let's look to our cities let's

1544
01:06:25,440 --> 01:06:30,480
look to our rooftops let's look to

1545
01:06:27,720 --> 01:06:32,309
create ecosystems very intentionally in

1546
01:06:30,480 --> 01:06:33,170
the places we live that are as

1547
01:06:32,309 --> 01:06:38,450
productive

1548
01:06:33,170 --> 01:06:48,440
and resilient as possible thank you

1549
01:06:38,450 --> 01:06:50,789
[Applause]

1550
01:06:48,440 --> 01:06:52,349
thanks Keith

1551
01:06:50,789 --> 01:06:55,289
our last speaker but definitely not

1552
01:06:52,349 --> 01:06:57,329
least is Ernesto Mendez he's professor

1553
01:06:55,289 --> 01:06:57,900
of Agriculture here at the University of

1554
01:06:57,329 --> 01:07:00,210
Vermont

1555
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:02,250
he shares his time in the Environmental

1556
01:07:00,210 --> 01:07:04,769
Studies Program and in the department of

1557
01:07:02,250 --> 01:07:06,240
plant soil science where he heads the

1558
01:07:04,769 --> 01:07:10,170
Agri ecology and livelihoods

1559
01:07:06,240 --> 01:07:11,369
collaborative he also didn't put this in

1560
01:07:10,170 --> 01:07:12,660
his bio but I'm going to announce it

1561
01:07:11,369 --> 01:07:14,220
he's going to be the chair of the plant

1562
01:07:12,660 --> 01:07:18,539
soil science department starting in four

1563
01:07:14,220 --> 01:07:24,180
days same day marijuana's legalised go

1564
01:07:18,539 --> 01:07:26,730
down goes down in Vermont ok ok

1565
01:07:24,180 --> 01:07:28,650
his research and teaching focused on a

1566
01:07:26,730 --> 01:07:31,170
gray ecology agri-food systems

1567
01:07:28,650 --> 01:07:34,170
participate action research and

1568
01:07:31,170 --> 01:07:36,690
transducin player a transdisciplinary

1569
01:07:34,170 --> 01:07:39,539
research approaches that UVM is an

1570
01:07:36,690 --> 01:07:41,190
active member of the food systems

1571
01:07:39,539 --> 01:07:42,420
initiative and a fellow at the gund

1572
01:07:41,190 --> 01:07:45,960
Institute for the environment

1573
01:07:42,420 --> 01:07:49,829
most recently he is the lead editor of a

1574
01:07:45,960 --> 01:07:51,480
book our ecology a transdisciplinary and

1575
01:07:49,829 --> 01:07:53,490
participatory and action oriented

1576
01:07:51,480 --> 01:07:55,529
approach which is the latest Agri

1577
01:07:53,490 --> 01:07:57,779
ecology textbook out there and it's

1578
01:07:55,529 --> 01:07:59,579
great Ernesto was born and raised in El

1579
01:07:57,779 --> 01:08:02,130
Salvador and he has worked extensively

1580
01:07:59,579 --> 01:08:03,779
in Latin America the US and Spain and

1581
01:08:02,130 --> 01:08:06,359
I'll also say it was my privilege to

1582
01:08:03,779 --> 01:08:09,890
study under him to do my graduate

1583
01:08:06,359 --> 01:08:13,040
research so Thank You Ernesto

1584
01:08:09,890 --> 01:08:13,040
[Applause]

1585
01:08:41,960 --> 01:08:47,390
so good afternoon everyone Sahra thank

1586
01:08:45,590 --> 01:08:52,700
you for organizing and for everybody who

1587
01:08:47,390 --> 01:08:55,550
came my fellow panelists it's been great

1588
01:08:52,700 --> 01:08:57,080
to hear your some of your stories so I'm

1589
01:08:55,550 --> 01:09:00,020
gonna add a little bit of my own stories

1590
01:08:57,080 --> 01:09:00,950
but at UVM I lead this group called the

1591
01:09:00,020 --> 01:09:03,140
Agri ecology and livelihoods

1592
01:09:00,950 --> 01:09:06,110
collaborative we like to say that we're

1593
01:09:03,140 --> 01:09:09,250
a community of practice it's very

1594
01:09:06,110 --> 01:09:11,540
diverse there are faculty students staff

1595
01:09:09,250 --> 01:09:14,840
collaborators including farmers and

1596
01:09:11,540 --> 01:09:17,240
other members of the community and we

1597
01:09:14,840 --> 01:09:23,750
use a participatory action research like

1598
01:09:17,240 --> 01:09:27,170
sirasa to to work in agriculture par as

1599
01:09:23,750 --> 01:09:30,200
the acronym really tries to do research

1600
01:09:27,170 --> 01:09:31,870
went with and for communities so when we

1601
01:09:30,200 --> 01:09:35,210
work with farmers we'd like to establish

1602
01:09:31,870 --> 01:09:37,790
the research agenda with them moving

1603
01:09:35,210 --> 01:09:40,370
forward in fact I work with Cory we're

1604
01:09:37,790 --> 01:09:41,930
starting to work with them more and we

1605
01:09:40,370 --> 01:09:46,400
do quite a bit of teaching and training

1606
01:09:41,930 --> 01:09:49,460
at different levels our group is very

1607
01:09:46,400 --> 01:09:51,050
collaborative so I've put some of the

1608
01:09:49,460 --> 01:09:54,410
logos here of the people we collaborate

1609
01:09:51,050 --> 01:09:56,390
with it's a it's a value we hold that

1610
01:09:54,410 --> 01:09:58,700
some of the issues that have been coming

1611
01:09:56,390 --> 01:10:00,260
up related to agriculture are not going

1612
01:09:58,700 --> 01:10:04,670
to be solved if we don't work together

1613
01:10:00,260 --> 01:10:06,740
in one way or another so this was one of

1614
01:10:04,670 --> 01:10:08,900
the questions that Sarah gave the

1615
01:10:06,740 --> 01:10:11,660
panelists to answer what you know what

1616
01:10:08,900 --> 01:10:15,350
is whatever you do to you

1617
01:10:11,660 --> 01:10:17,630
and and I want to say that my training

1618
01:10:15,350 --> 01:10:20,690
my undergraduate degree was in

1619
01:10:17,630 --> 01:10:22,640
conventional agronomy and and that the

1620
01:10:20,690 --> 01:10:25,520
reason following with the life stories

1621
01:10:22,640 --> 01:10:27,850
that people have been sharing I came to

1622
01:10:25,520 --> 01:10:32,000
agriculture it was somewhat different

1623
01:10:27,850 --> 01:10:33,860
being from El Salvador country where

1624
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:35,840
there's a lot of inequality and a lot of

1625
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:38,630
inequality in land when I was growing up

1626
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:42,920
so two percent of the population owned

1627
01:10:38,630 --> 01:10:44,480
80% of the land at one time and so this

1628
01:10:42,920 --> 01:10:47,660
is something that I really wanted to

1629
01:10:44,480 --> 01:10:49,160
work with or do something about and I

1630
01:10:47,660 --> 01:10:50,900
was fortunate enough to be able to come

1631
01:10:49,160 --> 01:10:53,560
and study in the US so I did my grana

1632
01:10:50,900 --> 01:10:56,050
meet the Green in California

1633
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,540
and it was a very conventional approach

1634
01:10:56,050 --> 01:11:04,240
very production oriented and an

1635
01:10:58,540 --> 01:11:07,030
industrial AG grapes and vegetables in

1636
01:11:04,240 --> 01:11:09,250
California and when I was thinking about

1637
01:11:07,030 --> 01:11:11,470
going back to work in El Salvador to try

1638
01:11:09,250 --> 01:11:14,200
to solve some of the issues that I was

1639
01:11:11,470 --> 01:11:17,020
concerned about industrialized

1640
01:11:14,200 --> 01:11:18,460
agriculture didn't seem to be what was

1641
01:11:17,020 --> 01:11:21,250
going to help resolve those things

1642
01:11:18,460 --> 01:11:24,730
because it was very prescient in El

1643
01:11:21,250 --> 01:11:26,620
Salvador already and being used by by

1644
01:11:24,730 --> 01:11:29,170
very large land holders that had a lot

1645
01:11:26,620 --> 01:11:30,820
of capital and a lot of resources but a

1646
01:11:29,170 --> 01:11:32,020
lot of the small holder farmers that

1647
01:11:30,820 --> 01:11:34,240
were working there just didn't have

1648
01:11:32,020 --> 01:11:37,030
access to that so I agree ecology I

1649
01:11:34,240 --> 01:11:40,900
found that in the 90s more than twenty

1650
01:11:37,030 --> 01:11:44,770
years ago and it was an inspiration and

1651
01:11:40,900 --> 01:11:48,030
I just I saw it as as an approach as a

1652
01:11:44,770 --> 01:11:50,080
way to really take into account

1653
01:11:48,030 --> 01:11:52,060
agriculture and farming that would be

1654
01:11:50,080 --> 01:11:57,220
environmentally sound socially just and

1655
01:11:52,060 --> 01:12:00,550
economically viable so I like to say

1656
01:11:57,220 --> 01:12:03,760
that Agri college is an approach I'm a

1657
01:12:00,550 --> 01:12:06,700
researcher I'm a scientist and I really

1658
01:12:03,760 --> 01:12:08,500
like doing research but I like to do

1659
01:12:06,700 --> 01:12:10,210
research that has an impact and that's

1660
01:12:08,500 --> 01:12:12,970
why I like to do research with farmers

1661
01:12:10,210 --> 01:12:15,970
so that whatever we do together actually

1662
01:12:12,970 --> 01:12:19,630
has some meaning to their farms or or

1663
01:12:15,970 --> 01:12:21,340
rural communities and I found that if if

1664
01:12:19,630 --> 01:12:25,450
it was gonna be useful it couldn't just

1665
01:12:21,340 --> 01:12:28,030
be one discipline so ecology is here as

1666
01:12:25,450 --> 01:12:30,520
a tenant of Agri ecology just does this

1667
01:12:28,030 --> 01:12:32,140
in permaculture but that's just not

1668
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:34,630
enough when you think about the El

1669
01:12:32,140 --> 01:12:37,600
Salvador issue ecology is not gonna

1670
01:12:34,630 --> 01:12:41,020
resolve some very deep-rooted social and

1671
01:12:37,600 --> 01:12:42,550
issues of inequality the other thing

1672
01:12:41,020 --> 01:12:43,890
that resonates with what some of the

1673
01:12:42,550 --> 01:12:47,020
people here have said is that

1674
01:12:43,890 --> 01:12:49,210
agriculture really values different

1675
01:12:47,020 --> 01:12:51,460
knowledge systems so even though I do

1676
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:54,160
believe we have our roots in science and

1677
01:12:51,460 --> 01:12:56,940
in the Academy we really reach out and

1678
01:12:54,160 --> 01:12:59,050
and have horizontal dialogue with

1679
01:12:56,940 --> 01:13:02,950
practical knowledge indigenous knowledge

1680
01:12:59,050 --> 01:13:06,130
that can span all these different you

1681
01:13:02,950 --> 01:13:07,179
know cosmovision culture we really think

1682
01:13:06,130 --> 01:13:09,790
that is important

1683
01:13:07,179 --> 01:13:11,560
in our work and and finally and this

1684
01:13:09,790 --> 01:13:13,690
might be more personal than other

1685
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:14,770
Agriculture's for me is that I really

1686
01:13:13,690 --> 01:13:18,610
want to do something that's

1687
01:13:14,770 --> 01:13:22,060
action-oriented and transformative very

1688
01:13:18,610 --> 01:13:24,370
recently or not too recently but has

1689
01:13:22,060 --> 01:13:27,880
been very recently accepted as that Agri

1690
01:13:24,370 --> 01:13:32,070
ecology can be seen in expressions of

1691
01:13:27,880 --> 01:13:35,320
science social movement and practice and

1692
01:13:32,070 --> 01:13:37,570
that's this has this resonates a lot

1693
01:13:35,320 --> 01:13:41,679
with me because I think that some of the

1694
01:13:37,570 --> 01:13:44,620
issues that prompted the development of

1695
01:13:41,679 --> 01:13:46,540
alternative agriculture I I agree that

1696
01:13:44,620 --> 01:13:48,670
there's tribalism but I would also say

1697
01:13:46,540 --> 01:13:50,710
that a lot of organic permaculture and

1698
01:13:48,670 --> 01:13:53,530
agriculture our response to

1699
01:13:50,710 --> 01:13:55,360
industrialized farming so they came up

1700
01:13:53,530 --> 01:13:57,070
because people were concerned about some

1701
01:13:55,360 --> 01:13:59,679
of the impacts of industrialized farming

1702
01:13:57,070 --> 01:14:02,440
there is overlap absolutely but there

1703
01:13:59,679 --> 01:14:07,420
but there's also you know a division

1704
01:14:02,440 --> 01:14:11,850
somewhere so for me what we really need

1705
01:14:07,420 --> 01:14:14,890
to engage these three dimensions

1706
01:14:11,850 --> 01:14:17,020
research in science social movements and

1707
01:14:14,890 --> 01:14:20,260
practice so hopefully that'll be a

1708
01:14:17,020 --> 01:14:23,650
little more clear at the end what I see

1709
01:14:20,260 --> 01:14:26,710
I see a lot of overlaps between or among

1710
01:14:23,650 --> 01:14:29,890
all of the alternative agriculture

1711
01:14:26,710 --> 01:14:32,340
models so but again I see them as very

1712
01:14:29,890 --> 01:14:36,310
separate from the industrial Akmal and

1713
01:14:32,340 --> 01:14:38,739
we have heard Keith's youth use ecology

1714
01:14:36,310 --> 01:14:40,449
I think we might have set it to an

1715
01:14:38,739 --> 01:14:44,469
environment and which is at the core of

1716
01:14:40,449 --> 01:14:46,330
Agri ecology organics started as a

1717
01:14:44,469 --> 01:14:51,520
social movement and there's definitely

1718
01:14:46,330 --> 01:14:52,870
the practical side and with conventional

1719
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,850
agriculture so there are a lot of

1720
01:14:52,870 --> 01:14:59,110
similarities I think the main difference

1721
01:14:54,850 --> 01:15:00,699
with industrialized AG is that a lot of

1722
01:14:59,110 --> 01:15:03,550
these other perspectives really have

1723
01:15:00,699 --> 01:15:07,510
social and ecological stewardship as as

1724
01:15:03,550 --> 01:15:09,190
a guiding frame whereas I think and what

1725
01:15:07,510 --> 01:15:11,140
I remember from being a conventional and

1726
01:15:09,190 --> 01:15:14,620
gharana mist that we were really being

1727
01:15:11,140 --> 01:15:16,840
trained to produce and make money and

1728
01:15:14,620 --> 01:15:19,330
most farmers be it that their organic

1729
01:15:16,840 --> 01:15:20,929
agriculture want to produce and make

1730
01:15:19,330 --> 01:15:23,150
money the question is

1731
01:15:20,929 --> 01:15:28,639
you do it at the expense of the

1732
01:15:23,150 --> 01:15:30,679
environment and in social issues so all

1733
01:15:28,639 --> 01:15:32,170
again you know I'm an academic and I

1734
01:15:30,679 --> 01:15:34,280
think it's really important to say that

1735
01:15:32,170 --> 01:15:36,170
where we come from and where we're

1736
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:38,510
positioned so I'll give you a bit of an

1737
01:15:36,170 --> 01:15:41,659
academic history of agroecology as a

1738
01:15:38,510 --> 01:15:50,059
concept so in in and what I call wave

1739
01:15:41,659 --> 01:15:54,380
one which is is that working over there

1740
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:57,349
in the 70s and 90s it was basically the

1741
01:15:54,380 --> 01:15:59,809
field sort of like very strongly wanted

1742
01:15:57,349 --> 01:16:02,199
to apply ecology to agriculture this was

1743
01:15:59,809 --> 01:16:04,420
not happening so again I went to

1744
01:16:02,199 --> 01:16:07,429
California Polytechnic State University

1745
01:16:04,420 --> 01:16:09,409
majored in crop science can somebody

1746
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:14,300
want to guess how many ecology classes I

1747
01:16:09,409 --> 01:16:17,719
took to get my BS anybody okay Eric wins

1748
01:16:14,300 --> 01:16:21,889
zero so that wasn't really a part of

1749
01:16:17,719 --> 01:16:24,019
conventional agronomy so a lot of the

1750
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:25,369
people in the 70s and 90's that came up

1751
01:16:24,019 --> 01:16:26,869
with a great ecology we're saying we

1752
01:16:25,369 --> 01:16:29,510
need to bring in ecology into

1753
01:16:26,869 --> 01:16:33,139
agriculture but then wave to in the

1754
01:16:29,510 --> 01:16:35,150
early 2000s they realized that ecology

1755
01:16:33,139 --> 01:16:37,340
was just not enough and part of it was

1756
01:16:35,150 --> 01:16:39,800
if we really want to help farmers it's

1757
01:16:37,340 --> 01:16:41,150
not just about farming practices there's

1758
01:16:39,800 --> 01:16:42,679
political issues through land

1759
01:16:41,150 --> 01:16:45,499
distribution issues there's social

1760
01:16:42,679 --> 01:16:47,780
issues there's inequality very complex

1761
01:16:45,499 --> 01:16:52,489
issues and honestly as an agronomist I

1762
01:16:47,780 --> 01:16:55,189
was a little bit afraid of moving into

1763
01:16:52,489 --> 01:16:57,260
that those dimensions but I started

1764
01:16:55,189 --> 01:17:00,349
working with small holder farmers and

1765
01:16:57,260 --> 01:17:04,489
I've been lucky to work almost in most

1766
01:17:00,349 --> 01:17:07,150
parts of the world except Asia maybe and

1767
01:17:04,489 --> 01:17:09,530
and it's true in a lot of these places

1768
01:17:07,150 --> 01:17:11,119
technology and just farming better to

1769
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:13,789
produce more is not enough there are

1770
01:17:11,119 --> 01:17:15,320
some really deep rooted issues but if

1771
01:17:13,789 --> 01:17:17,449
you really want to solve the problems in

1772
01:17:15,320 --> 01:17:20,599
the long term you'll have to address at

1773
01:17:17,449 --> 01:17:22,579
some point in 2009 what I call wave

1774
01:17:20,599 --> 01:17:24,829
three was this proposition that a greek

1775
01:17:22,579 --> 01:17:27,650
ology was a science and movement in a

1776
01:17:24,829 --> 01:17:30,050
practice and it had some debates at that

1777
01:17:27,650 --> 01:17:33,949
point but right now I can safely say

1778
01:17:30,050 --> 01:17:34,880
that most people accept it that this is

1779
01:17:33,949 --> 01:17:38,840
how it is

1780
01:17:34,880 --> 01:17:41,719
and wave 4 where I've participated the

1781
01:17:38,840 --> 01:17:44,510
most is really taking it more explicitly

1782
01:17:41,719 --> 01:17:46,639
into this inclusive entrance formative

1783
01:17:44,510 --> 01:17:49,330
approach so we want to change food

1784
01:17:46,639 --> 01:17:52,639
systems I'm doing it from my research

1785
01:17:49,330 --> 01:17:54,320
position in different ways and we want

1786
01:17:52,639 --> 01:17:56,060
to be inclusive we want to hear other

1787
01:17:54,320 --> 01:17:59,239
voices we don't want to say that just

1788
01:17:56,060 --> 01:18:01,639
science is the voice that has to be

1789
01:17:59,239 --> 01:18:03,170
predominantly there we have to take into

1790
01:18:01,639 --> 01:18:07,040
account the issues that Keith brought up

1791
01:18:03,170 --> 01:18:09,469
colonization a lot of people that reach

1792
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:12,230
out to Agri ecology are groups that have

1793
01:18:09,469 --> 01:18:13,670
been oppressed in one way or another and

1794
01:18:12,230 --> 01:18:16,400
that's because they see at just this

1795
01:18:13,670 --> 01:18:19,400
perspective I had a conversation with

1796
01:18:16,400 --> 01:18:22,070
some Cuban permaculturist and we we had

1797
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:23,420
a whole discussion about similarities

1798
01:18:22,070 --> 01:18:24,920
and differences and they kind of said

1799
01:18:23,420 --> 01:18:27,469
well permaculture seems to have more

1800
01:18:24,920 --> 01:18:31,219
ethics and I agree ecology more justice

1801
01:18:27,469 --> 01:18:32,389
we should talk about thank you so one

1802
01:18:31,219 --> 01:18:35,150
really interesting thing about the

1803
01:18:32,389 --> 01:18:37,219
social movement piece is that la Via

1804
01:18:35,150 --> 01:18:40,520
Campesina which is a international

1805
01:18:37,219 --> 01:18:43,760
person organization 182 organization

1806
01:18:40,520 --> 01:18:46,520
members 81 countries an estimated 200

1807
01:18:43,760 --> 01:18:49,670
million smallholder farmers so here's

1808
01:18:46,520 --> 01:18:53,210
where a friendly challenge to Terry yes

1809
01:18:49,670 --> 01:18:54,949
so I would say that maybe more land is

1810
01:18:53,210 --> 01:18:57,199
being cultivated under conventional

1811
01:18:54,949 --> 01:19:02,020
agriculture but there's probably more

1812
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:05,449
non conventional farmers yeah thank you

1813
01:19:02,020 --> 01:19:06,739
so so what you see which is really

1814
01:19:05,449 --> 01:19:08,420
interesting is that these social

1815
01:19:06,739 --> 01:19:11,690
movements have really embraced our

1816
01:19:08,420 --> 01:19:13,900
ecology as the way that they want the

1817
01:19:11,690 --> 01:19:16,159
farmers that they work with to farm and

1818
01:19:13,900 --> 01:19:19,400
part of the reason is because they see

1819
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:23,150
this opening but it's not a science that

1820
01:19:19,400 --> 01:19:25,310
rejects the political economic issues a

1821
01:19:23,150 --> 01:19:26,989
lot of my scientist colleagues really

1822
01:19:25,310 --> 01:19:30,260
cringe at this you know don't talk

1823
01:19:26,989 --> 01:19:32,570
politics we don't talk politics in Agri

1824
01:19:30,260 --> 01:19:34,040
ecology we kind of have to engage it

1825
01:19:32,570 --> 01:19:36,830
because we believe that some of the

1826
01:19:34,040 --> 01:19:38,659
issues we face our political economic so

1827
01:19:36,830 --> 01:19:41,030
that doesn't mean that I have to be the

1828
01:19:38,659 --> 01:19:43,250
activist and the Advocate all the time

1829
01:19:41,030 --> 01:19:45,199
maybe my role is more doing this

1830
01:19:43,250 --> 01:19:47,929
research with farmers and with community

1831
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:48,290
members but I acknowledge the fact that

1832
01:19:47,929 --> 01:19:50,860
the

1833
01:19:48,290 --> 01:19:53,240
issue is there and that it is important

1834
01:19:50,860 --> 01:19:55,880
so there's a lot of these movements all

1835
01:19:53,240 --> 01:19:59,750
over the world less so in the US

1836
01:19:55,880 --> 01:20:01,730
although growing I think another thing

1837
01:19:59,750 --> 01:20:05,090
that I wanted to say is Agri ecology has

1838
01:20:01,730 --> 01:20:07,220
has emerged and and taken a seat in

1839
01:20:05,090 --> 01:20:08,840
international policy when I started

1840
01:20:07,220 --> 01:20:10,940
working in a great ecology it was really

1841
01:20:08,840 --> 01:20:13,310
at the fringe and it was it was

1842
01:20:10,940 --> 01:20:16,090
considered or taken seriously by a lot

1843
01:20:13,310 --> 01:20:19,070
of scientists or policymakers we have

1844
01:20:16,090 --> 01:20:20,300
now are in the radar of the Food and

1845
01:20:19,070 --> 01:20:22,820
Agriculture Organization of the United

1846
01:20:20,300 --> 01:20:24,800
Nations which is not that important in

1847
01:20:22,820 --> 01:20:27,800
the US but pretty much very important

1848
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:30,460
everywhere else because it's the UN arm

1849
01:20:27,800 --> 01:20:33,530
of Agriculture and in Central America

1850
01:20:30,460 --> 01:20:35,450
the Ministry of Agriculture listens to

1851
01:20:33,530 --> 01:20:37,670
the FAO and in a lot of different

1852
01:20:35,450 --> 01:20:39,530
countries so it's been huge that the FAO

1853
01:20:37,670 --> 01:20:41,720
has kind of like embraced Agri ecology

1854
01:20:39,530 --> 01:20:44,150
they have an agriculture knowledge hub

1855
01:20:41,720 --> 01:20:46,340
and they just had the second sim global

1856
01:20:44,150 --> 01:20:50,270
symposium this year

1857
01:20:46,340 --> 01:20:52,820
IPE s food is the equivalent of the IPCC

1858
01:20:50,270 --> 01:20:54,050
the climate change panel so I invite you

1859
01:20:52,820 --> 01:20:58,280
to look it up if you want it they just

1860
01:20:54,050 --> 01:21:01,160
published a report on from uniformity to

1861
01:20:58,280 --> 01:21:03,950
diversity it's a lot of really great

1862
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:06,800
people Olivia the shooter is the leading

1863
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:10,460
director and he was the UN Rapporteur

1864
01:21:06,800 --> 01:21:11,690
for the right to food so in the US there

1865
01:21:10,460 --> 01:21:13,220
are some organizations that are

1866
01:21:11,690 --> 01:21:15,290
affiliated with Agri ecology and

1867
01:21:13,220 --> 01:21:17,750
advocating the u.s. food sovereignty

1868
01:21:15,290 --> 01:21:20,900
Alliance food First Union of Concerned

1869
01:21:17,750 --> 01:21:23,390
Scientists it's been interesting for me

1870
01:21:20,900 --> 01:21:25,550
I've been in at UVM for 11 years looking

1871
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:28,970
at who is engaging in Agri ecology in

1872
01:21:25,550 --> 01:21:32,690
the US a lot of them are Native American

1873
01:21:28,970 --> 01:21:35,000
groups African Americans people of color

1874
01:21:32,690 --> 01:21:37,910
that are doing agriculture so this sort

1875
01:21:35,000 --> 01:21:40,030
of like again groups that have some kind

1876
01:21:37,910 --> 01:21:43,280
of marginalization or oppression are

1877
01:21:40,030 --> 01:21:44,840
reaching out to this approach to do that

1878
01:21:43,280 --> 01:21:46,580
we are starting to work more with

1879
01:21:44,840 --> 01:21:50,180
whyhunger they have reached out to us

1880
01:21:46,580 --> 01:21:53,960
recently and you know this dialogue that

1881
01:21:50,180 --> 01:21:57,350
came up among the tribes is also very

1882
01:21:53,960 --> 01:21:59,840
difficult between scientists advocates

1883
01:21:57,350 --> 01:22:01,580
and practical farmers right sometimes we

1884
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:02,360
don't speak to each other that well so

1885
01:22:01,580 --> 01:22:04,070
that's part of what

1886
01:22:02,360 --> 01:22:07,969
I really like to do is how do we break

1887
01:22:04,070 --> 01:22:10,340
those barriers in terms of practices

1888
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:12,679
since this was a farming practices in

1889
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:15,260
Agri ecology as in permaculture we use

1890
01:22:12,679 --> 01:22:17,150
principles and one of a lot of what I

1891
01:22:15,260 --> 01:22:19,880
like to do is this how do these

1892
01:22:17,150 --> 01:22:21,920
principles hold all over the world so

1893
01:22:19,880 --> 01:22:24,260
soil health is is a principle that's

1894
01:22:21,920 --> 01:22:27,800
been coming up for me everywhere I work

1895
01:22:24,260 --> 01:22:29,510
we did work with on on climate change

1896
01:22:27,800 --> 01:22:32,090
resilience in Haiti Nicaragua and

1897
01:22:29,510 --> 01:22:33,590
Honduras and people concluded that those

1898
01:22:32,090 --> 01:22:35,630
farmers were like we need to take care

1899
01:22:33,590 --> 01:22:36,739
of the soil when you look at some of the

1900
01:22:35,630 --> 01:22:38,360
work I've done here in Vermont

1901
01:22:36,739 --> 01:22:40,250
everybody's talking about so help so

1902
01:22:38,360 --> 01:22:42,380
it's a principle that seems to hold

1903
01:22:40,250 --> 01:22:44,929
regardless of where you are and then

1904
01:22:42,380 --> 01:22:48,050
your practices would adapt to your

1905
01:22:44,929 --> 01:22:49,790
context so maybe to maintain soil health

1906
01:22:48,050 --> 01:22:51,110
in the tropics agroforestry is really

1907
01:22:49,790 --> 01:22:54,469
good although I'm hearing Keith saying

1908
01:22:51,110 --> 01:22:57,139
that here too great but here in the US

1909
01:22:54,469 --> 01:22:58,630
I'm more used to hearing cover cropping

1910
01:22:57,139 --> 01:23:00,949
it's a really good practice for

1911
01:22:58,630 --> 01:23:04,610
maintaining so health which is not that

1912
01:23:00,949 --> 01:23:07,699
great in a tropical environment but

1913
01:23:04,610 --> 01:23:11,840
maybe could be tweaked so there are also

1914
01:23:07,699 --> 01:23:14,989
other Agri ecology associations around

1915
01:23:11,840 --> 01:23:16,760
the world again kind of getting really

1916
01:23:14,989 --> 01:23:19,040
strong in other places and less so in

1917
01:23:16,760 --> 01:23:20,659
the US but we're really working hard to

1918
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:24,800
change that

1919
01:23:20,659 --> 01:23:27,739
and I wanted to end just by bring to

1920
01:23:24,800 --> 01:23:30,310
your attention this opinion piece in The

1921
01:23:27,739 --> 01:23:34,100
New York Times that came out today that

1922
01:23:30,310 --> 01:23:36,139
discusses agroecology and gives you a

1923
01:23:34,100 --> 01:23:38,869
good summary of the things that are

1924
01:23:36,139 --> 01:23:41,929
happening globally so I have this very

1925
01:23:38,869 --> 01:23:44,510
global vision I can't help it given Who

1926
01:23:41,929 --> 01:23:46,040
I am and where I come from and even

1927
01:23:44,510 --> 01:23:49,880
though I love to work in Vermont I'm

1928
01:23:46,040 --> 01:23:51,350
always keeping this sense of what it you

1929
01:23:49,880 --> 01:23:53,119
know it's important to contribute I

1930
01:23:51,350 --> 01:23:54,860
think Vermont has a lot to contribute to

1931
01:23:53,119 --> 01:23:57,290
the world all of the things that are

1932
01:23:54,860 --> 01:24:00,710
happening here and sometimes we don't

1933
01:23:57,290 --> 01:24:03,310
bring it out enough I guess I'll leave

1934
01:24:00,710 --> 01:24:03,310
it there

1935
01:24:03,710 --> 01:24:11,100
[Applause]

1936
01:24:24,300 --> 01:24:30,390
thank you to all the panelists it was

1937
01:24:27,700 --> 01:24:33,540
great to hear all of your stories and

1938
01:24:30,390 --> 01:24:35,950
it's time for you guys to participate so

1939
01:24:33,540 --> 01:24:38,560
we have two mics so you can come up to

1940
01:24:35,950 --> 01:24:40,360
the mic if you have a question we ask

1941
01:24:38,560 --> 01:24:42,220
you know it's time for a question and

1942
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:44,650
comments if you have a specific question

1943
01:24:42,220 --> 01:24:46,930
for a panelists please address it to

1944
01:24:44,650 --> 01:24:48,310
them so that all five panelists have to

1945
01:24:46,930 --> 01:24:50,830
answer every single question obviously

1946
01:24:48,310 --> 01:24:52,870
you're allowed to chime in but we just

1947
01:24:50,830 --> 01:24:57,280
want to have the most time for you guys

1948
01:24:52,870 --> 01:25:02,550
to give comments yeah so anybody have

1949
01:24:57,280 --> 01:25:08,890
any questions can you go up to the mic

1950
01:25:02,550 --> 01:25:12,070
yeah thanks hi everybody thanks for

1951
01:25:08,890 --> 01:25:15,100
being here tonight and engaging with all

1952
01:25:12,070 --> 01:25:18,070
of us I heard some of you talked about

1953
01:25:15,100 --> 01:25:20,500
like a global food shortage and rising

1954
01:25:18,070 --> 01:25:24,310
populations and some of you not address

1955
01:25:20,500 --> 01:25:25,840
this topic and I just wanted and I was

1956
01:25:24,310 --> 01:25:29,430
wondering if you could all speak about

1957
01:25:25,840 --> 01:25:32,920
how your respective disciplines think of

1958
01:25:29,430 --> 01:25:37,570
is there a global food shortage is there

1959
01:25:32,920 --> 01:25:39,010
not and yeah just a little bit about the

1960
01:25:37,570 --> 01:25:41,460
discussion within your respective

1961
01:25:39,010 --> 01:25:41,460
disciplines

1962
01:25:46,530 --> 01:25:53,180
so a great college II has a very strong

1963
01:25:49,470 --> 01:25:56,160
position and this and it's mostly that

1964
01:25:53,180 --> 01:25:58,760
we are producing enough food already

1965
01:25:56,160 --> 01:26:01,980
that the issue that we're facing is that

1966
01:25:58,760 --> 01:26:04,080
its distribution right and and the other

1967
01:26:01,980 --> 01:26:07,580
issue is what are we producing so we

1968
01:26:04,080 --> 01:26:12,140
have for example millions of acres of

1969
01:26:07,580 --> 01:26:14,580
soy in in South America and in Argentina

1970
01:26:12,140 --> 01:26:17,160
so that's quite a lot of production but

1971
01:26:14,580 --> 01:26:22,050
it's all going to animal feed or some to

1972
01:26:17,160 --> 01:26:24,500
biofuels so we contest the notion that

1973
01:26:22,050 --> 01:26:27,150
we need to produce more to feed people

1974
01:26:24,500 --> 01:26:30,090
again it seems to be this more political

1975
01:26:27,150 --> 01:26:31,830
economic issue of who's producing for

1976
01:26:30,090 --> 01:26:38,340
what are they producing and who's

1977
01:26:31,830 --> 01:26:39,600
getting the who has access to thanks

1978
01:26:38,340 --> 01:26:42,660
yeah that's a great question

1979
01:26:39,600 --> 01:26:45,360
and I would say personally and then

1980
01:26:42,660 --> 01:26:47,670
there's by no means consensus within the

1981
01:26:45,360 --> 01:26:50,670
permaculture community but generally you

1982
01:26:47,670 --> 01:26:52,170
know we work against this scarcity

1983
01:26:50,670 --> 01:26:54,450
mentality where the problem is there's

1984
01:26:52,170 --> 01:26:56,160
not enough to go around and the reality

1985
01:26:54,450 --> 01:26:58,530
is you know even historically when we

1986
01:26:56,160 --> 01:27:00,690
look to the Irish potato famine there

1987
01:26:58,530 --> 01:27:02,670
were record-breaking wheat exports

1988
01:27:00,690 --> 01:27:04,680
happening at the time of the Irish

1989
01:27:02,670 --> 01:27:06,810
potato famine and the people who lived

1990
01:27:04,680 --> 01:27:10,620
on potatoes were the only people who

1991
01:27:06,810 --> 01:27:12,720
were in famine and I think it's a really

1992
01:27:10,620 --> 01:27:14,490
interesting problem in our economic

1993
01:27:12,720 --> 01:27:16,020
system and I think that's certainly

1994
01:27:14,490 --> 01:27:17,790
where we have much better leverage

1995
01:27:16,020 --> 01:27:20,340
because the reality is there is food

1996
01:27:17,790 --> 01:27:22,560
held under lock and key for purposes of

1997
01:27:20,340 --> 01:27:25,490
stabilizing prices the reality in the

1998
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:27,210
United States especially is that vast

1999
01:27:25,490 --> 01:27:29,520
embarrassing portion

2000
01:27:27,210 --> 01:27:31,290
I won't quite say majority but an

2001
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:34,800
embarrassing bortion of the food that we

2002
01:27:31,290 --> 01:27:37,710
produced never reaches plates much less

2003
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:40,290
even after reaching plates is is fully

2004
01:27:37,710 --> 01:27:43,800
nourishing people and we are in fact

2005
01:27:40,290 --> 01:27:45,900
over producing tremendously relative to

2006
01:27:43,800 --> 01:27:47,930
the eaters needs on the planet at

2007
01:27:45,900 --> 01:27:51,990
present and only driving ourselves

2008
01:27:47,930 --> 01:27:56,790
deeper when we're over producing in like

2009
01:27:51,990 --> 01:27:59,890
soil eroding agricultural systems so the

2010
01:27:56,790 --> 01:28:02,650
answers are easier or harder to

2011
01:27:59,890 --> 01:28:04,300
to come up with but I think it's a very

2012
01:28:02,650 --> 01:28:06,250
important question because as we enter

2013
01:28:04,300 --> 01:28:08,680
the dialogue for instance with genetic

2014
01:28:06,250 --> 01:28:10,570
engineers and things like Golden Rice

2015
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:13,750
and these you know they say hey we're

2016
01:28:10,570 --> 01:28:15,430
going to end world hunger well the

2017
01:28:13,750 --> 01:28:17,920
reality is of course genetic engineers

2018
01:28:15,430 --> 01:28:20,410
at present are primarily herbicide

2019
01:28:17,920 --> 01:28:23,140
manufacturers and primarily genetically

2020
01:28:20,410 --> 01:28:25,090
engineered herbicide resistant plants so

2021
01:28:23,140 --> 01:28:26,950
that they can increase herbicide sales

2022
01:28:25,090 --> 01:28:29,620
and I think we have a very important

2023
01:28:26,950 --> 01:28:32,020
conversation to have about you know for

2024
01:28:29,620 --> 01:28:34,270
instance scarcity versus abundance and

2025
01:28:32,020 --> 01:28:36,370
also really addressing a kind of

2026
01:28:34,270 --> 01:28:39,430
import/export commodity oriented

2027
01:28:36,370 --> 01:28:42,310
agriculture which might make sense from

2028
01:28:39,430 --> 01:28:44,770
an investment perspective and perhaps in

2029
01:28:42,310 --> 01:28:46,090
some cases from a GDP perspective but

2030
01:28:44,770 --> 01:28:48,430
that is something where you know

2031
01:28:46,090 --> 01:28:50,110
permaculture has has the reason

2032
01:28:48,430 --> 01:28:52,090
permaculture became a global movement

2033
01:28:50,110 --> 01:28:54,730
essentially was to go to these places

2034
01:28:52,090 --> 01:28:56,950
which were engaged in export

2035
01:28:54,730 --> 01:28:58,660
monocultures and if there was ever

2036
01:28:56,950 --> 01:29:01,330
economic you know if there was price

2037
01:28:58,660 --> 01:29:03,490
fluctuation with those crops these

2038
01:29:01,330 --> 01:29:06,100
communities would be in tragedy if there

2039
01:29:03,490 --> 01:29:08,050
was pest or disease issues with these

2040
01:29:06,100 --> 01:29:11,830
crops these communities would be in

2041
01:29:08,050 --> 01:29:14,410
tragedy and to encourage a incredibly

2042
01:29:11,830 --> 01:29:16,870
diverse agriculture system that meets

2043
01:29:14,410 --> 01:29:19,480
first immediate needs which isn't to say

2044
01:29:16,870 --> 01:29:22,710
it doesn't engage in any export or or

2045
01:29:19,480 --> 01:29:22,710
production for sale

2046
01:29:27,500 --> 01:29:35,550
I'll just add that I I just wonder I

2047
01:29:32,010 --> 01:29:40,350
think so yeah how long we can keep up

2048
01:29:35,550 --> 01:29:42,719
what we're doing and you know a point of

2049
01:29:40,350 --> 01:29:45,060
discussion for me and as someone who

2050
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:48,449
raises animals in a way that is not the

2051
01:29:45,060 --> 01:29:51,150
way that when we talk about animal like

2052
01:29:48,449 --> 01:29:53,250
food growing the crops being raised to

2053
01:29:51,150 --> 01:29:56,219
feed animals that's a totally different

2054
01:29:53,250 --> 01:29:58,890
way to work with animals on a landscape

2055
01:29:56,219 --> 01:30:02,850
and so that's like the product the end

2056
01:29:58,890 --> 01:30:04,680
result of raising meat for human

2057
01:30:02,850 --> 01:30:06,870
consumption there's two very different

2058
01:30:04,680 --> 01:30:08,790
ways to do that that is part of this

2059
01:30:06,870 --> 01:30:10,620
whole discussion as well but I just

2060
01:30:08,790 --> 01:30:15,719
wonder how long we can do it in a way

2061
01:30:10,620 --> 01:30:17,310
that is you know currently happening but

2062
01:30:15,719 --> 01:30:20,520
I agree with everything that you just

2063
01:30:17,310 --> 01:30:23,550
said the overproduction right now for a

2064
01:30:20,520 --> 01:30:30,810
very short term human scale short-term

2065
01:30:23,550 --> 01:30:32,100
gain well I had those graphs so so what

2066
01:30:30,810 --> 01:30:35,670
I would say is no we don't have a

2067
01:30:32,100 --> 01:30:39,570
shortage in and I don't see there's a

2068
01:30:35,670 --> 01:30:42,150
couple things that I see as promising

2069
01:30:39,570 --> 01:30:44,160
one is that we are expecting the human

2070
01:30:42,150 --> 01:30:46,280
population to level off at about 10 or

2071
01:30:44,160 --> 01:30:48,540
11 million and to finally reach

2072
01:30:46,280 --> 01:30:51,030
replacement population so as long as we

2073
01:30:48,540 --> 01:30:53,910
can find a system by then to feed that

2074
01:30:51,030 --> 01:30:57,960
many people in theory we can go on long

2075
01:30:53,910 --> 01:30:59,670
as our resources don't run out the those

2076
01:30:57,960 --> 01:31:01,350
graphs you know chicken or egg you know

2077
01:30:59,670 --> 01:31:03,150
do we have more people because we had

2078
01:31:01,350 --> 01:31:04,860
more food or do we have did we make more

2079
01:31:03,150 --> 01:31:06,480
food for more people I think we probably

2080
01:31:04,860 --> 01:31:08,010
have more people because we had we

2081
01:31:06,480 --> 01:31:11,040
produced more food and allowed people to

2082
01:31:08,010 --> 01:31:13,170
breed more was that a good thing or bad

2083
01:31:11,040 --> 01:31:15,030
thing that well we can argue that all

2084
01:31:13,170 --> 01:31:19,230
day long but we're all here and we all

2085
01:31:15,030 --> 01:31:21,449
have to eat I think two parts that I

2086
01:31:19,230 --> 01:31:26,430
want to mention one that I like that

2087
01:31:21,449 --> 01:31:29,730
Corey mentioned we animals animals are

2088
01:31:26,430 --> 01:31:32,550
fabulous creatures for converting

2089
01:31:29,730 --> 01:31:35,160
non-digestible plant proteins into

2090
01:31:32,550 --> 01:31:38,650
proteins digestible by humans that's

2091
01:31:35,160 --> 01:31:41,739
what we when we bred animals domestic

2092
01:31:38,650 --> 01:31:43,869
animals you know over millennia we

2093
01:31:41,739 --> 01:31:45,489
created these creatures that could

2094
01:31:43,869 --> 01:31:47,400
convert food that we can't efficiently

2095
01:31:45,489 --> 01:31:49,900
eat mostly grasses we can eat soybeans

2096
01:31:47,400 --> 01:31:51,489
into food that we can eat in store I

2097
01:31:49,900 --> 01:31:53,619
mean they stood they you don't have to

2098
01:31:51,489 --> 01:31:59,050
refrigerate a living cow until you cut

2099
01:31:53,619 --> 01:32:02,699
it up the butts and what I see is the

2100
01:31:59,050 --> 01:32:07,059
biggest problem is our Western diets is

2101
01:32:02,699 --> 01:32:09,190
far too dependent upon you know fossil

2102
01:32:07,059 --> 01:32:10,449
fuel dependent nitrogen dependent crops

2103
01:32:09,190 --> 01:32:13,659
to feed all the animals we eat too much

2104
01:32:10,449 --> 01:32:15,429
meat and more concerning is that the

2105
01:32:13,659 --> 01:32:16,449
rest of the world's we don't want to

2106
01:32:15,429 --> 01:32:18,429
just have it all but the rest of the

2107
01:32:16,449 --> 01:32:21,090
world is catching up to us and then we

2108
01:32:18,429 --> 01:32:23,409
see a lot of the issues with

2109
01:32:21,090 --> 01:32:25,239
particularly say the soy tariffs that

2110
01:32:23,409 --> 01:32:27,309
are happening right now that are

2111
01:32:25,239 --> 01:32:29,860
probably gonna decimate a la lleve a

2112
01:32:27,309 --> 01:32:31,599
more more ghost towns in the Midwest

2113
01:32:29,860 --> 01:32:33,969
those soybeans are being grown to ship

2114
01:32:31,599 --> 01:32:37,829
to China to feed the pigs to feed a

2115
01:32:33,969 --> 01:32:40,380
Western diet so we eat too much meat

2116
01:32:37,829 --> 01:32:43,440
without question we need to address that

2117
01:32:40,380 --> 01:32:45,960
there the last thing I like to point out

2118
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:48,960
there was a piece of New York Times

2119
01:32:45,960 --> 01:32:52,210
November of last year I think it was

2120
01:32:48,960 --> 01:32:53,920
looking at the food waste issue and one

2121
01:32:52,210 --> 01:32:56,829
really important thing to think about

2122
01:32:53,920 --> 01:32:58,869
with this is that of the food that's

2123
01:32:56,829 --> 01:33:01,420
wasted yes we produce enough calories

2124
01:32:58,869 --> 01:33:04,780
worldwide and then and significantly

2125
01:33:01,420 --> 01:33:07,690
more to feed everyone between 60 and 96

2126
01:33:04,780 --> 01:33:10,809
percent of that waste is pre consumer

2127
01:33:07,690 --> 01:33:12,849
before it hits the plate so we need to

2128
01:33:10,809 --> 01:33:16,090
again protect the crops and design a

2129
01:33:12,849 --> 01:33:18,280
system where we can move those crops to

2130
01:33:16,090 --> 01:33:19,929
people during that chain that don't get

2131
01:33:18,280 --> 01:33:21,670
wasted there's a whole lot of societal

2132
01:33:19,929 --> 01:33:24,849
implications we need to come up with to

2133
01:33:21,670 --> 01:33:27,130
do that we're not perfect human

2134
01:33:24,849 --> 01:33:30,099
necessity to make sure we're all fed has

2135
01:33:27,130 --> 01:33:32,440
been a great driver of innovation but as

2136
01:33:30,099 --> 01:33:34,389
resources start to shrink we're gonna

2137
01:33:32,440 --> 01:33:37,449
need to have different drivers which is

2138
01:33:34,389 --> 01:33:39,780
how do we do this in a more sustainable

2139
01:33:37,449 --> 01:33:39,780
way

2140
01:33:41,860 --> 01:33:46,150
I want to add too much but I will say

2141
01:33:43,240 --> 01:33:47,950
that generally speaking I would

2142
01:33:46,150 --> 01:33:49,540
definitely grow at the what Ernesto said

2143
01:33:47,950 --> 01:33:51,760
that the problem is not production or

2144
01:33:49,540 --> 01:33:53,860
food scarcity but access much more so

2145
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:56,590
which is a much more complex problem to

2146
01:33:53,860 --> 01:33:58,180
solve and in terms of I guess addressing

2147
01:33:56,590 --> 01:34:01,930
specifically organic and how I think

2148
01:33:58,180 --> 01:34:05,080
organic views this issue there's a lot

2149
01:34:01,930 --> 01:34:06,970
of discussion kind of outside the

2150
01:34:05,080 --> 01:34:08,680
organic community about feeding the

2151
01:34:06,970 --> 01:34:11,050
world and whether organic can really

2152
01:34:08,680 --> 01:34:13,390
ever accomplish that I would say that

2153
01:34:11,050 --> 01:34:14,590
the 200 million smallholder farmers that

2154
01:34:13,390 --> 01:34:17,020
Ernesto mentioned are probably

2155
01:34:14,590 --> 01:34:18,760
practicing a lot closer to can organic

2156
01:34:17,020 --> 01:34:21,820
than conventional industrial farming

2157
01:34:18,760 --> 01:34:23,620
practices and they are feeding a huge

2158
01:34:21,820 --> 01:34:26,110
portion of the world as it is right now

2159
01:34:23,620 --> 01:34:28,480
and used to feed a larger percentage of

2160
01:34:26,110 --> 01:34:29,920
the world and then kind of within the

2161
01:34:28,480 --> 01:34:31,540
organic community and I think this is

2162
01:34:29,920 --> 01:34:35,350
fairly minimal but I have had

2163
01:34:31,540 --> 01:34:36,880
conversations with people who are part

2164
01:34:35,350 --> 01:34:38,580
of I would say the organic industry not

2165
01:34:36,880 --> 01:34:42,430
necessarily the organic farming movement

2166
01:34:38,580 --> 01:34:44,620
who are concerned or or share this

2167
01:34:42,430 --> 01:34:47,170
mentality of food scarcity and feel that

2168
01:34:44,620 --> 01:34:49,030
we need to kind of loosen up the

2169
01:34:47,170 --> 01:34:51,520
regulations are on organic in order to

2170
01:34:49,030 --> 01:34:53,050
allow organic to feed more people and I

2171
01:34:51,520 --> 01:34:54,880
push back really strongly against that

2172
01:34:53,050 --> 01:34:57,100
because if we loosen up the meaning of

2173
01:34:54,880 --> 01:34:59,860
organic too much it's not going to mean

2174
01:34:57,100 --> 01:35:01,150
organic anymore and I don't necessarily

2175
01:34:59,860 --> 01:35:03,070
think that that's what needs to happen

2176
01:35:01,150 --> 01:35:04,870
in order to feed our population we need

2177
01:35:03,070 --> 01:35:08,890
to address the issues of distribution

2178
01:35:04,870 --> 01:35:10,330
and access yeah thank you and there's

2179
01:35:08,890 --> 01:35:12,370
lots of research out there that does

2180
01:35:10,330 --> 01:35:14,920
show small-scale organic agriculture

2181
01:35:12,370 --> 01:35:16,510
kenfield the world if we put our focus

2182
01:35:14,920 --> 01:35:19,450
on that Badgley article was an article

2183
01:35:16,510 --> 01:35:22,090
that came out in 2014 or 12 I can't

2184
01:35:19,450 --> 01:35:23,470
remember four four seven all right it

2185
01:35:22,090 --> 01:35:24,970
was when I was in graduate anyways look

2186
01:35:23,470 --> 01:35:28,240
that up and there's lots more research

2187
01:35:24,970 --> 01:35:30,010
out there but we don't to focus you

2188
01:35:28,240 --> 01:35:32,980
don't want me to start giving my opinion

2189
01:35:30,010 --> 01:35:42,210
here I'll never stop ok so Dave misko

2190
01:35:32,980 --> 01:35:42,210
please step to me since

2191
01:35:42,830 --> 01:35:50,730
1973 and it's really really exciting to

2192
01:35:48,120 --> 01:35:55,980
see that you young people you know you

2193
01:35:50,730 --> 01:36:00,180
are it what we've started you need to

2194
01:35:55,980 --> 01:36:03,360
really go with I'm along with Dave

2195
01:36:00,180 --> 01:36:05,970
Chapman and he's set for Vermont we

2196
01:36:03,360 --> 01:36:08,280
started an organization called keep the

2197
01:36:05,970 --> 01:36:12,870
soil and organic about six years ago to

2198
01:36:08,280 --> 01:36:16,320
fight the USDA illegal certification of

2199
01:36:12,870 --> 01:36:21,420
hydroponic farms as we were doing that

2200
01:36:16,320 --> 01:36:25,110
we found more and more that the the

2201
01:36:21,420 --> 01:36:28,320
industrial organic industry was not

2202
01:36:25,110 --> 01:36:32,370
following the rules of the organic

2203
01:36:28,320 --> 01:36:36,620
regulations whether it was the

2204
01:36:32,370 --> 01:36:36,620
hydroponic or whether it was the CAFO

2205
01:36:37,130 --> 01:36:43,350
chicken operations the CAFO dairy

2206
01:36:39,990 --> 01:36:46,560
operations which are group very quickly

2207
01:36:43,350 --> 01:36:49,650
for they putting out of business the

2208
01:36:46,560 --> 01:36:53,730
real organic dairies in Vermont and

2209
01:36:49,650 --> 01:36:56,760
elsewhere the family farms we're in a

2210
01:36:53,730 --> 01:36:59,700
crisis situation with with the dairy

2211
01:36:56,760 --> 01:37:02,790
yeah organic dairy industry throughout

2212
01:36:59,700 --> 01:37:07,050
the United States we're becoming a

2213
01:37:02,790 --> 01:37:09,930
crisis situation with the hydroponic

2214
01:37:07,050 --> 01:37:12,210
greenhouses taking over the markets

2215
01:37:09,930 --> 01:37:14,070
whether it's here in Burlington at City

2216
01:37:12,210 --> 01:37:15,870
Market or whether it's in the

2217
01:37:14,070 --> 01:37:23,480
supermarket's whether it's in the Whole

2218
01:37:15,870 --> 01:37:26,450
Foods and so we thought that we lost as

2219
01:37:23,480 --> 01:37:29,970
USDA National Organic Program

2220
01:37:26,450 --> 01:37:32,310
illegaly is allowing the hydroponics as

2221
01:37:29,970 --> 01:37:35,520
we're doing that we found that there

2222
01:37:32,310 --> 01:37:38,170
were a lot of other instances where the

2223
01:37:35,520 --> 01:37:41,880
rules weren't being followed

2224
01:37:38,170 --> 01:37:45,370
the senator leahy was the originator and

2225
01:37:41,880 --> 01:37:47,560
to push the National Organic Program and

2226
01:37:45,370 --> 01:37:51,870
the standards and they're not being

2227
01:37:47,560 --> 01:37:54,730
followed we have groups like NOFA and

2228
01:37:51,870 --> 01:37:58,630
Vermont and around the New England who

2229
01:37:54,730 --> 01:38:01,239
are following the rules I'm certified by

2230
01:37:58,630 --> 01:38:03,699
the Vermont organic farmers I did along

2231
01:38:01,239 --> 01:38:05,679
with a number of other small group of

2232
01:38:03,699 --> 01:38:09,130
organic farmers in Vermont we started

2233
01:38:05,679 --> 01:38:14,260
Vermont organic farmers and the

2234
01:38:09,130 --> 01:38:18,250
difficulty now is that the nofa's and

2235
01:38:14,260 --> 01:38:21,370
the true certification organizations the

2236
01:38:18,250 --> 01:38:25,600
United States have to follow the rules

2237
01:38:21,370 --> 01:38:28,120
of the the National Organic Program and

2238
01:38:25,600 --> 01:38:31,770
yet those rules are shaky because other

2239
01:38:28,120 --> 01:38:35,739
certification organizations like

2240
01:38:31,770 --> 01:38:37,739
California organic farmers and a number

2241
01:38:35,739 --> 01:38:40,929
of other ones aren't following the rules

2242
01:38:37,739 --> 01:38:43,060
so you go into the city market you go

2243
01:38:40,929 --> 01:38:46,660
into the supermarkets and you see the

2244
01:38:43,060 --> 01:38:50,040
USDA label that USDA label does not mean

2245
01:38:46,660 --> 01:38:53,280
the same throughout the United States

2246
01:38:50,040 --> 01:38:56,530
about 80 to 90 percent of the

2247
01:38:53,280 --> 01:38:59,350
certification farms in the United States

2248
01:38:56,530 --> 01:39:00,850
are following the rules and the bigger

2249
01:38:59,350 --> 01:39:05,170
and the bigger and the bigger ones

2250
01:39:00,850 --> 01:39:08,410
aren't yet you go into these stores you

2251
01:39:05,170 --> 01:39:11,770
don't know the difference so when we

2252
01:39:08,410 --> 01:39:16,030
lost we all we start an organization

2253
01:39:11,770 --> 01:39:19,600
which Maddy mentioned the real organic

2254
01:39:16,030 --> 01:39:25,120
project and what that is meant to do is

2255
01:39:19,600 --> 01:39:27,460
it's meant to really look at where what

2256
01:39:25,120 --> 01:39:28,890
the rules are and how to make them

2257
01:39:27,460 --> 01:39:33,870
better

2258
01:39:28,890 --> 01:39:38,160
and to give something higher than what

2259
01:39:33,870 --> 01:39:41,100
the USDA standards say and but even more

2260
01:39:38,160 --> 01:39:45,890
important on how the USDA standards are

2261
01:39:41,100 --> 01:39:50,030
being certified throughout this country

2262
01:39:45,890 --> 01:39:54,240
so our focus is two things one thing is

2263
01:39:50,030 --> 01:39:57,330
to have the standards which we've we met

2264
01:39:54,240 --> 01:40:01,320
together in the end of March and with a

2265
01:39:57,330 --> 01:40:03,720
group of farmers and organic advocates

2266
01:40:01,320 --> 01:40:07,140
from all around the country and sort of

2267
01:40:03,720 --> 01:40:12,870
improved on what the USDA standards say

2268
01:40:07,140 --> 01:40:15,360
and we're doing a pilot project with 50

2269
01:40:12,870 --> 01:40:18,290
farms around the United States to see

2270
01:40:15,360 --> 01:40:21,930
how what these how these standards work

2271
01:40:18,290 --> 01:40:24,150
within the within some of the top farms

2272
01:40:21,930 --> 01:40:27,450
in the United States the other thing is

2273
01:40:24,150 --> 01:40:29,430
is we're doing a just ask campaign where

2274
01:40:27,450 --> 01:40:32,070
you go into the stores and you go to

2275
01:40:29,430 --> 01:40:34,800
City Market and you see Driscoll's

2276
01:40:32,070 --> 01:40:37,790
Barry's Driscoll's is the biggest

2277
01:40:34,800 --> 01:40:41,040
producer of organic berries in the world

2278
01:40:37,790 --> 01:40:44,790
almost all of them are hydroponic they

2279
01:40:41,040 --> 01:40:48,060
never say that on the label so to ask

2280
01:40:44,790 --> 01:40:52,040
people in the stores is that hydroponic

2281
01:40:48,060 --> 01:40:59,340
is that organic most of them don't know

2282
01:40:52,040 --> 01:41:01,770
so the the push is to have something

2283
01:40:59,340 --> 01:41:05,070
that really means organic as you people

2284
01:41:01,770 --> 01:41:08,820
here are wanting to become organic and

2285
01:41:05,070 --> 01:41:12,160
become organic farmers I'm just about

2286
01:41:08,820 --> 01:41:15,790
done my farming

2287
01:41:12,160 --> 01:41:18,610
but if I don't leave the legacy that we

2288
01:41:15,790 --> 01:41:21,970
and other ones don't leave a legacy that

2289
01:41:18,610 --> 01:41:24,640
organic means something you won't have a

2290
01:41:21,970 --> 01:41:26,440
market and you and your what you're

2291
01:41:24,640 --> 01:41:29,950
trying to do with the good things with

2292
01:41:26,440 --> 01:41:32,890
with your organic farms you're the

2293
01:41:29,950 --> 01:41:36,250
industrial organic agriculture will have

2294
01:41:32,890 --> 01:41:54,390
the markets so thanks do you have a

2295
01:41:36,250 --> 01:41:54,390
question for anyone else have a question

2296
01:42:05,800 --> 01:42:11,050
Braham from rural Vermont thank you

2297
01:42:08,579 --> 01:42:12,159
thank you all that really appreciated

2298
01:42:11,050 --> 01:42:15,790
everything y'all had to say in this

2299
01:42:12,159 --> 01:42:17,590
discussion here tonight so I do work for

2300
01:42:15,790 --> 01:42:19,270
morover Mott but I'm also a small farmer

2301
01:42:17,590 --> 01:42:21,070
and such Vermont and work as an educator

2302
01:42:19,270 --> 01:42:22,960
as well my business partners over here

2303
01:42:21,070 --> 01:42:25,119
and it's really like I said great to

2304
01:42:22,960 --> 01:42:27,329
have you all speak but also to see

2305
01:42:25,119 --> 01:42:29,949
everybody here it's really inspiring and

2306
01:42:27,329 --> 01:42:33,280
one of the questions that comes up for

2307
01:42:29,949 --> 01:42:34,690
me both my personal relationship to this

2308
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:37,480
work but also my professional

2309
01:42:34,690 --> 01:42:39,639
relationship and I think Dave really

2310
01:42:37,480 --> 01:42:44,639
gets to part of the point here is what

2311
01:42:39,639 --> 01:42:49,260
do you all see as the role of policy in

2312
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:52,210
trance in shaping the future of farming

2313
01:42:49,260 --> 01:42:59,500
of agroecology of our food systems of

2314
01:42:52,210 --> 01:43:01,119
our agro ecosystems and maybe is the

2315
01:42:59,500 --> 01:43:03,099
second layer to that question which hits

2316
01:43:01,119 --> 01:43:05,949
a little more home and something that I

2317
01:43:03,099 --> 01:43:07,030
think a lot of a lot of people these a

2318
01:43:05,949 --> 01:43:10,690
few of these people at the table here

2319
01:43:07,030 --> 01:43:12,520
are dealing with directly is and which

2320
01:43:10,690 --> 01:43:16,869
is a partially a consequence of policy

2321
01:43:12,520 --> 01:43:20,530
is you know how do you see a just

2322
01:43:16,869 --> 01:43:23,770
transition from some of these systems of

2323
01:43:20,530 --> 01:43:25,360
management but also as Keith mentioned

2324
01:43:23,770 --> 01:43:27,670
the larger economic and political

2325
01:43:25,360 --> 01:43:30,119
systems and social systems that are

2326
01:43:27,670 --> 01:43:33,000
meshed within it

2327
01:43:30,119 --> 01:43:35,139
accounting for sure ecological impacts

2328
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:36,760
but also the history and current

2329
01:43:35,139 --> 01:43:38,230
situation of Industry and policy

2330
01:43:36,760 --> 01:43:39,880
pressure that made these farms where

2331
01:43:38,230 --> 01:43:41,320
they are and specific I would say the

2332
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:43,449
dairy industry whether it's called

2333
01:43:41,320 --> 01:43:46,750
conventional or whether it's it's called

2334
01:43:43,449 --> 01:43:48,760
sustainable or and organic is now you

2335
01:43:46,750 --> 01:43:51,300
know it's still part of this commodity

2336
01:43:48,760 --> 01:43:55,510
system and we're seeing

2337
01:43:51,300 --> 01:43:57,280
organic dairy producers also at the fate

2338
01:43:55,510 --> 01:43:59,800
of that system so I'm curious what just

2339
01:43:57,280 --> 01:44:01,090
transition looks like to you accounting

2340
01:43:59,800 --> 01:44:03,190
both for ecological impacts but also

2341
01:44:01,090 --> 01:44:04,480
socio-economic well-being in history

2342
01:44:03,190 --> 01:44:06,880
that's a part of all of this and where

2343
01:44:04,480 --> 01:44:09,579
these farmers find themselves in the

2344
01:44:06,880 --> 01:44:12,050
role of policy in your work or movement

2345
01:44:09,579 --> 01:44:15,179
building or other methods of change

2346
01:44:12,050 --> 01:44:20,400
thanks Graham does anybody want to take

2347
01:44:15,179 --> 01:44:22,289
that up to answer whoever wants to

2348
01:44:20,400 --> 01:44:25,429
answer so we can get more questions in

2349
01:44:22,289 --> 01:44:27,989
if we yeah it's it's a really hard

2350
01:44:25,429 --> 01:44:30,630
question to answer for me in a succinct

2351
01:44:27,989 --> 01:44:34,289
way but that's what my job I hope is all

2352
01:44:30,630 --> 01:44:37,139
about and in response to your specific

2353
01:44:34,289 --> 01:44:39,119
point about kind of a just transition we

2354
01:44:37,139 --> 01:44:42,510
recently I know if I did a survey of our

2355
01:44:39,119 --> 01:44:44,190
members and we asked them you know what

2356
01:44:42,510 --> 01:44:46,710
they want us to work on in our strategic

2357
01:44:44,190 --> 01:44:48,300
plan over the next five years what they

2358
01:44:46,710 --> 01:44:50,699
think our goal should be for that plan

2359
01:44:48,300 --> 01:44:52,050
and a lot of them mentioned exactly what

2360
01:44:50,699 --> 01:44:54,119
you're talking about

2361
01:44:52,050 --> 01:44:56,659
a transition for Vermont agriculture

2362
01:44:54,119 --> 01:44:59,480
away from sort of the commodity based

2363
01:44:56,659 --> 01:45:03,210
dairy model via conventional or organic

2364
01:44:59,480 --> 01:45:05,429
to a more diversified type of you know

2365
01:45:03,210 --> 01:45:07,530
maybe smaller family scale or mid scale

2366
01:45:05,429 --> 01:45:11,250
agriculture and I think that that's

2367
01:45:07,530 --> 01:45:14,010
really been our vision and of course we

2368
01:45:11,250 --> 01:45:16,860
do want to support organic dairies and

2369
01:45:14,010 --> 01:45:21,059
and also other types of family scale

2370
01:45:16,860 --> 01:45:24,030
farms that are succeeding economically

2371
01:45:21,059 --> 01:45:26,280
and ecologically our mission is to build

2372
01:45:24,030 --> 01:45:30,659
an ecologically sound an economically

2373
01:45:26,280 --> 01:45:34,050
viable food system in Vermont and so I

2374
01:45:30,659 --> 01:45:36,780
think in terms of policy there's so many

2375
01:45:34,050 --> 01:45:39,360
ways it's really hard to again

2376
01:45:36,780 --> 01:45:41,099
succinctly answer that question but just

2377
01:45:39,360 --> 01:45:43,650
today I actually was looking at an

2378
01:45:41,099 --> 01:45:47,400
amendment that's being proposed by

2379
01:45:43,650 --> 01:45:50,099
senator Sanders on changes to the way

2380
01:45:47,400 --> 01:45:52,500
that dairy is regulated in the farm bill

2381
01:45:50,099 --> 01:45:54,210
under the farm bill and there's a lot of

2382
01:45:52,500 --> 01:45:57,270
kind of small tweaks that you could make

2383
01:45:54,210 --> 01:45:59,190
that may help farmers in this time of

2384
01:45:57,270 --> 01:46:01,289
crisis and that's sort of you know a

2385
01:45:59,190 --> 01:46:02,730
stopgap measure but I think the larger

2386
01:46:01,289 --> 01:46:06,270
question of how do we transition away

2387
01:46:02,730 --> 01:46:07,949
from these systems that that may not be

2388
01:46:06,270 --> 01:46:09,900
sustainable in the long run is a much

2389
01:46:07,949 --> 01:46:12,889
larger one and I think it's going to

2390
01:46:09,900 --> 01:46:15,750
take really concerted and collaborative

2391
01:46:12,889 --> 01:46:17,639
long-term effort across lots of

2392
01:46:15,750 --> 01:46:20,369
different types of Agriculture and lots

2393
01:46:17,639 --> 01:46:22,349
of different organizations to work on

2394
01:46:20,369 --> 01:46:24,059
policy that will accomplish that it's

2395
01:46:22,349 --> 01:46:24,780
sort of a non-answer but it's a really

2396
01:46:24,059 --> 01:46:30,020
complicated

2397
01:46:24,780 --> 01:46:33,239
question I got something I'll bet you so

2398
01:46:30,020 --> 01:46:35,219
yeah without questions since the farm

2399
01:46:33,239 --> 01:46:37,559
bill came about even a little bit before

2400
01:46:35,219 --> 01:46:39,900
that there has been a false advantage

2401
01:46:37,559 --> 01:46:42,869
given to field crops corn and soy corn

2402
01:46:39,900 --> 01:46:44,670
is a is a incredible plant in terms of

2403
01:46:42,869 --> 01:46:46,110
productivity if you feed it it'll just

2404
01:46:44,670 --> 01:46:49,320
keep producing especially how we've bred

2405
01:46:46,110 --> 01:46:51,360
it but the policies and the subsidies

2406
01:46:49,320 --> 01:46:52,500
have given it a false advantage and

2407
01:46:51,360 --> 01:46:55,289
therefore we've been able to build up

2408
01:46:52,500 --> 01:46:57,469
systems whether they be however you

2409
01:46:55,289 --> 01:47:01,770
convert that protein into milk or meat

2410
01:46:57,469 --> 01:47:03,239
that take advantage of corn and soy this

2411
01:47:01,770 --> 01:47:05,219
is a little Liron dear to my heart I

2412
01:47:03,239 --> 01:47:07,650
grew up on a dairy farm and what would

2413
01:47:05,219 --> 01:47:08,940
be considered for the idealized small

2414
01:47:07,650 --> 01:47:10,289
dairy farm when we moved back to the

2415
01:47:08,940 --> 01:47:12,630
farm I was three years old my

2416
01:47:10,289 --> 01:47:16,650
grandfather had I think 26 head of cows

2417
01:47:12,630 --> 01:47:18,989
in the classic Red Barn when I was a kid

2418
01:47:16,650 --> 01:47:20,909
four or five years olds we had two

2419
01:47:18,989 --> 01:47:23,159
milkman we had the guy who picked up the

2420
01:47:20,909 --> 01:47:26,670
milk and we had the WIC guy who brought

2421
01:47:23,159 --> 01:47:29,250
our food systems allotment because you

2422
01:47:26,670 --> 01:47:31,139
could not make money at that scale and

2423
01:47:29,250 --> 01:47:33,980
there was a real transition at that time

2424
01:47:31,139 --> 01:47:36,329
so as a fundamental problem with dairy

2425
01:47:33,980 --> 01:47:37,800
there's a price disconnect between

2426
01:47:36,329 --> 01:47:40,920
there's a disconnect between the price

2427
01:47:37,800 --> 01:47:42,630
signal when the price goes up you make

2428
01:47:40,920 --> 01:47:44,550
more milk when the price goes down you

2429
01:47:42,630 --> 01:47:45,929
make more milk until enough people go

2430
01:47:44,550 --> 01:47:47,190
out of business you know the price keeps

2431
01:47:45,929 --> 01:47:51,000
going down people go out of business it

2432
01:47:47,190 --> 01:47:55,409
crashes and that's how we supply how we

2433
01:47:51,000 --> 01:47:57,599
affect our milk prices what we need what

2434
01:47:55,409 --> 01:47:59,340
I feel we need and I go back to papers I

2435
01:47:57,599 --> 01:48:02,190
wrote in this class I now teach an Ag

2436
01:47:59,340 --> 01:48:04,079
policy that my father thought this was

2437
01:48:02,190 --> 01:48:06,989
crazy that I was proposing this and I

2438
01:48:04,079 --> 01:48:10,260
wasn't proposing it's not a new idea

2439
01:48:06,989 --> 01:48:14,070
the problem with dairy in particular as

2440
01:48:10,260 --> 01:48:17,400
well as some other commodities is that

2441
01:48:14,070 --> 01:48:19,739
it is a supply driven system not of man

2442
01:48:17,400 --> 01:48:21,480
driven system so where dairy has worked

2443
01:48:19,739 --> 01:48:24,590
particularly we looked to the north is

2444
01:48:21,480 --> 01:48:26,760
when there's a supply management system

2445
01:48:24,590 --> 01:48:28,380
organic dairy I have cousins that are

2446
01:48:26,760 --> 01:48:30,300
that are in the organic dairy business

2447
01:48:28,380 --> 01:48:33,110
farming on a farm that looks exactly

2448
01:48:30,300 --> 01:48:37,500
like my farm when we've sold the cows in

2449
01:48:33,110 --> 01:48:39,420
2004 they were doing well feeding three

2450
01:48:37,500 --> 01:48:41,670
generations of the fam

2451
01:48:39,420 --> 01:48:44,969
they're struggling right now and at that

2452
01:48:41,670 --> 01:48:47,639
time in Central Vermont where we had 35

2453
01:48:44,969 --> 01:48:49,889
to 60 head dairy farms organic was the

2454
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:51,599
only way to make it work and that was a

2455
01:48:49,889 --> 01:48:54,119
bubble for a short period until we

2456
01:48:51,599 --> 01:48:56,070
figure out it's not that there's too

2457
01:48:54,119 --> 01:48:58,619
much conventional milk there's just too

2458
01:48:56,070 --> 01:49:01,079
much milk and until we find out a way to

2459
01:48:58,619 --> 01:49:03,540
balance the supply with the demand we're

2460
01:49:01,079 --> 01:49:05,730
gonna keep running into that no I don't

2461
01:49:03,540 --> 01:49:06,809
have any great answers aside from trying

2462
01:49:05,730 --> 01:49:08,670
to figure out I think that's the

2463
01:49:06,809 --> 01:49:11,670
fundamental policy issue we need to get

2464
01:49:08,670 --> 01:49:13,829
to stop subsidizing field crops as much

2465
01:49:11,670 --> 01:49:16,579
and come up with some way to balance

2466
01:49:13,829 --> 01:49:16,579
supply with mint

2467
01:49:23,130 --> 01:49:30,630
I don't know and and I'd say that the

2468
01:49:28,020 --> 01:49:35,449
the strategy that we're working on is

2469
01:49:30,630 --> 01:49:38,369
just trying to come up with structural

2470
01:49:35,449 --> 01:49:40,710
for our own business like a legal

2471
01:49:38,369 --> 01:49:43,650
structure that that can protect us as

2472
01:49:40,710 --> 01:49:46,770
best as possible and that takes a lot of

2473
01:49:43,650 --> 01:49:50,130
time and resources and energy to figure

2474
01:49:46,770 --> 01:49:54,329
out and and I don't know if that's the

2475
01:49:50,130 --> 01:49:56,670
answer but I think we have to be super

2476
01:49:54,329 --> 01:50:00,179
creative and I want nothing to do with

2477
01:49:56,670 --> 01:50:02,760
the commodity world on that front

2478
01:50:00,179 --> 01:50:05,400
because how you know with all already

2479
01:50:02,760 --> 01:50:08,579
all the unknowns about farming then to

2480
01:50:05,400 --> 01:50:10,679
add that unknown to seems really scary

2481
01:50:08,579 --> 01:50:12,780
to me so that's that's just our approach

2482
01:50:10,679 --> 01:50:15,090
is like really digging into the legal

2483
01:50:12,780 --> 01:50:17,280
structures and try to find all the

2484
01:50:15,090 --> 01:50:21,480
different type of protection mechanisms

2485
01:50:17,280 --> 01:50:23,909
we can thanks yeah thanks for an

2486
01:50:21,480 --> 01:50:26,159
important question and I think we are in

2487
01:50:23,909 --> 01:50:28,050
a very unique position in Vermont when

2488
01:50:26,159 --> 01:50:31,260
it comes to these questions because I'd

2489
01:50:28,050 --> 01:50:33,389
like to think that we have more folks

2490
01:50:31,260 --> 01:50:36,750
able to hear me but I'd like to think

2491
01:50:33,389 --> 01:50:38,550
that we have more than elsewhere a more

2492
01:50:36,750 --> 01:50:40,559
direct democracy or more participatory

2493
01:50:38,550 --> 01:50:42,960
democracy or at least greater access to

2494
01:50:40,559 --> 01:50:45,809
our representatives here in the state I

2495
01:50:42,960 --> 01:50:47,639
think we have the tradition of Town

2496
01:50:45,809 --> 01:50:50,190
Meeting and we have you know generally

2497
01:50:47,639 --> 01:50:53,030
people who you see at the store or

2498
01:50:50,190 --> 01:50:55,980
school or have town-hall type meeting

2499
01:50:53,030 --> 01:50:58,590
where hopefully policy can be a little

2500
01:50:55,980 --> 01:51:01,080
bit more responsive and and respond

2501
01:50:58,590 --> 01:51:03,060
quicker to our demands and I think you

2502
01:51:01,080 --> 01:51:05,250
know we have a really interesting

2503
01:51:03,060 --> 01:51:06,989
dilemma here because I don't think you

2504
01:51:05,250 --> 01:51:12,030
know generally any farmers want more

2505
01:51:06,989 --> 01:51:13,350
regulations and at the same time you

2506
01:51:12,030 --> 01:51:15,630
know we believe everybody may be

2507
01:51:13,350 --> 01:51:17,489
benefits from more transparency except

2508
01:51:15,630 --> 01:51:19,680
for those with something to hide right

2509
01:51:17,489 --> 01:51:21,060
so I think it's really interesting when

2510
01:51:19,680 --> 01:51:23,370
we look to other states where the laws

2511
01:51:21,060 --> 01:51:25,710
are passed for instance if you wear a

2512
01:51:23,370 --> 01:51:27,989
camera into an animal production

2513
01:51:25,710 --> 01:51:30,150
facility you are charged with criminal

2514
01:51:27,989 --> 01:51:31,710
trespass even if you were hired and

2515
01:51:30,150 --> 01:51:33,510
that's the law that they pass and and

2516
01:51:31,710 --> 01:51:36,120
say you know all right now we've

2517
01:51:33,510 --> 01:51:38,130
protected farms right and it's really

2518
01:51:36,120 --> 01:51:39,690
interesting I guess I want to weigh in

2519
01:51:38,130 --> 01:51:43,050
on this with a little bit of you know

2520
01:51:39,690 --> 01:51:45,000
personal background and in the case of

2521
01:51:43,050 --> 01:51:46,890
my farm with frankly what I think we

2522
01:51:45,000 --> 01:51:49,230
will face most significantly in the

2523
01:51:46,890 --> 01:51:51,989
immediate future here in Vermont which

2524
01:51:49,230 --> 01:51:55,350
is is cannabis so we we are a cannabis

2525
01:51:51,989 --> 01:51:58,500
farm we produce organic CBD hemp which

2526
01:51:55,350 --> 01:52:01,680
is medical hemp it's directly from the

2527
01:51:58,500 --> 01:52:04,739
branches of it we don't grow fiber hemp

2528
01:52:01,680 --> 01:52:07,110
or seed hemp we grow you know sinsemilla

2529
01:52:04,739 --> 01:52:09,690
we grow seedless flowers female flowers

2530
01:52:07,110 --> 01:52:13,199
for medicinal purposes and right now

2531
01:52:09,690 --> 01:52:15,510
that entire game is indirect dance with

2532
01:52:13,199 --> 01:52:18,420
every little tenth of a percentage point

2533
01:52:15,510 --> 01:52:21,810
shift with our breeding with our

2534
01:52:18,420 --> 01:52:25,170
extraction with our cultivar selection

2535
01:52:21,810 --> 01:52:27,180
and we're in the responsive position

2536
01:52:25,170 --> 01:52:30,210
where we basically adjust as the law

2537
01:52:27,180 --> 01:52:33,360
change and I think what what we as a

2538
01:52:30,210 --> 01:52:35,520
farm and group of people are trying to

2539
01:52:33,360 --> 01:52:38,100
do is be much more proactive rather than

2540
01:52:35,520 --> 01:52:41,790
responsive and if we take our cues from

2541
01:52:38,100 --> 01:52:43,260
corporate agribusiness and say well

2542
01:52:41,790 --> 01:52:46,110
here's what we can and cannot do and

2543
01:52:43,260 --> 01:52:48,090
what's isn't isn't legal they show up

2544
01:52:46,110 --> 01:52:50,790
and they whine and time the legislators

2545
01:52:48,090 --> 01:52:52,140
and hand over like pre-written bills and

2546
01:52:50,790 --> 01:52:54,120
say this is the one that we need cite

2547
01:52:52,140 --> 01:52:55,290
thank you very much and that's not

2548
01:52:54,120 --> 01:52:57,090
necessarily I don't think we should

2549
01:52:55,290 --> 01:52:59,360
adopt that model entirely but I

2550
01:52:57,090 --> 01:53:02,310
definitely think we need to be much more

2551
01:52:59,360 --> 01:53:03,349
proactive and vocal with a positive

2552
01:53:02,310 --> 01:53:05,780
vision

2553
01:53:03,349 --> 01:53:08,030
and and use that vision to drive what we

2554
01:53:05,780 --> 01:53:10,880
see the need what policy limits and what

2555
01:53:08,030 --> 01:53:12,679
policy supports and in the case of

2556
01:53:10,880 --> 01:53:14,750
cannabis I don't want to weigh in on

2557
01:53:12,679 --> 01:53:16,400
where policy should be but it's really

2558
01:53:14,750 --> 01:53:17,840
interesting and we particularly find

2559
01:53:16,400 --> 01:53:19,489
ourselves at this month so at this very

2560
01:53:17,840 --> 01:53:22,369
moment we're hosting a residential

2561
01:53:19,489 --> 01:53:24,010
intensive cannabis culture course where

2562
01:53:22,369 --> 01:53:27,020
people are learning to grow cannabis

2563
01:53:24,010 --> 01:53:29,300
ideally in as ecologically regenerative

2564
01:53:27,020 --> 01:53:31,099
ways as possible and specifically I

2565
01:53:29,300 --> 01:53:33,500
think this is an opportunity for us to

2566
01:53:31,099 --> 01:53:35,480
be proactive and pre-emptive in a

2567
01:53:33,500 --> 01:53:38,210
business with incredible financial

2568
01:53:35,480 --> 01:53:40,460
interest with which the tides will turn

2569
01:53:38,210 --> 01:53:43,369
very quickly I mean right now we see the

2570
01:53:40,460 --> 01:53:46,310
greatest opposition to legal cannabis

2571
01:53:43,369 --> 01:53:48,050
coming from essentially the biggest

2572
01:53:46,310 --> 01:53:51,320
breweries and pharmaceutical companies

2573
01:53:48,050 --> 01:53:54,889
in the country and they are also at the

2574
01:53:51,320 --> 01:53:58,010
same time ready to invest and become the

2575
01:53:54,889 --> 01:54:01,190
primary means of distribution of this of

2576
01:53:58,010 --> 01:54:02,900
this crop or this product and I think we

2577
01:54:01,190 --> 01:54:04,280
in Vermont have this very unique

2578
01:54:02,900 --> 01:54:06,170
position just like we did when we

2579
01:54:04,280 --> 01:54:08,770
decriminalized raw milk thank you we're

2580
01:54:06,170 --> 01:54:11,150
all Vermont and created more immediate

2581
01:54:08,770 --> 01:54:12,980
liberalization of like the ability to

2582
01:54:11,150 --> 01:54:14,750
process animals on farm and serve them

2583
01:54:12,980 --> 01:54:16,280
publicly in a restaurant without like

2584
01:54:14,750 --> 01:54:17,750
the Clark brothers the chicken who

2585
01:54:16,280 --> 01:54:19,369
couldn't which couldn't cross the street

2586
01:54:17,750 --> 01:54:21,619
if you're familiar with the story one

2587
01:54:19,369 --> 01:54:24,230
was a caterer the other was a farmer and

2588
01:54:21,619 --> 01:54:26,270
they were on the same farm and they

2589
01:54:24,230 --> 01:54:28,310
couldn't sell the chicken from the farm

2590
01:54:26,270 --> 01:54:30,860
to the caterer without like going all

2591
01:54:28,310 --> 01:54:33,139
around the state and that was a part of

2592
01:54:30,860 --> 01:54:35,119
how we created policy was was but with

2593
01:54:33,139 --> 01:54:37,159
that kind of as an example of how what

2594
01:54:35,119 --> 01:54:38,780
we wanted as a community we wanted to go

2595
01:54:37,159 --> 01:54:41,900
to a farm that like had the chickens

2596
01:54:38,780 --> 01:54:44,030
grown and if they were serving meals in

2597
01:54:41,900 --> 01:54:45,440
a restaurant fashion like know that that

2598
01:54:44,030 --> 01:54:47,420
chicken was actually the same chicken

2599
01:54:45,440 --> 01:54:51,260
and not necessarily like miss tagged

2600
01:54:47,420 --> 01:54:52,849
from a major facility so I'm sorry to

2601
01:54:51,260 --> 01:54:54,800
take as much time with this as I have

2602
01:54:52,849 --> 01:54:56,139
but I think especially in the case of

2603
01:54:54,800 --> 01:54:59,000
cannabis we see this incredible

2604
01:54:56,139 --> 01:55:03,110
dissonance between federal policy and

2605
01:54:59,000 --> 01:55:06,079
state policy and need to lie and rely on

2606
01:55:03,110 --> 01:55:09,239
our directly participatory democracy

2607
01:55:06,079 --> 01:55:13,350
broken as it may be and

2608
01:55:09,239 --> 01:55:15,239
and and vocally have a voice for what we

2609
01:55:13,350 --> 01:55:17,489
want which in the case of cannabis I

2610
01:55:15,239 --> 01:55:20,370
would hope is a part of a diversified

2611
01:55:17,489 --> 01:55:23,010
family farm a part of ideally organic

2612
01:55:20,370 --> 01:55:25,410
agriculture a part of our tradition of

2613
01:55:23,010 --> 01:55:27,840
direct marketing and direct added value

2614
01:55:25,410 --> 01:55:30,180
and right now we have the opportunity to

2615
01:55:27,840 --> 01:55:33,960
shape that law because I guarantee you

2616
01:55:30,180 --> 01:55:36,560
that law will be rushed through the next

2617
01:55:33,960 --> 01:55:39,510
legislative session as we simultaneously

2618
01:55:36,560 --> 01:55:41,820
see legalization in Canada and

2619
01:55:39,510 --> 01:55:43,650
Massachusetts and literally millions

2620
01:55:41,820 --> 01:55:45,989
dozens of millions of dollars just

2621
01:55:43,650 --> 01:55:48,750
leaving the state to engage in a legal

2622
01:55:45,989 --> 01:55:51,360
market on both sides of our borders so I

2623
01:55:48,750 --> 01:55:52,830
don't want to make this about that but I

2624
01:55:51,360 --> 01:55:55,400
think it's you know a very interesting

2625
01:55:52,830 --> 01:55:58,170
part of where we have to shape policy

2626
01:55:55,400 --> 01:55:59,550
proactively rather than respond to

2627
01:55:58,170 --> 01:56:04,200
policy and determining our farming

2628
01:55:59,550 --> 01:56:06,870
practices I'll be very brief I think

2629
01:56:04,200 --> 01:56:09,140
this is really important and I want to

2630
01:56:06,870 --> 01:56:12,300
agree with everything that's been said

2631
01:56:09,140 --> 01:56:14,940
policy engaging in policy and and

2632
01:56:12,300 --> 01:56:17,940
advocacy's is hard we all have jobs and

2633
01:56:14,940 --> 01:56:19,770
families and adding one more layer it's

2634
01:56:17,940 --> 01:56:22,440
hard but I think that it's very

2635
01:56:19,770 --> 01:56:25,020
important that we do it and because if

2636
01:56:22,440 --> 01:56:26,580
we look at the policies if we believe in

2637
01:56:25,020 --> 01:56:29,640
a broad umbrella of sustainable

2638
01:56:26,580 --> 01:56:31,410
agriculture in food systems that's not

2639
01:56:29,640 --> 01:56:33,570
where the current policies are taking us

2640
01:56:31,410 --> 01:56:37,140
so if we want to make a change we have

2641
01:56:33,570 --> 01:56:41,130
to engage however we can I know that for

2642
01:56:37,140 --> 01:56:42,960
me I'm I'm opening up more to engaging

2643
01:56:41,130 --> 01:56:44,489
with social movement organizations that

2644
01:56:42,960 --> 01:56:47,310
are interested in Agoura ecology they're

2645
01:56:44,489 --> 01:56:51,150
asking for data they're asking for talks

2646
01:56:47,310 --> 01:56:53,940
it took educating some of their their

2647
01:56:51,150 --> 01:56:56,580
staff so that's one way that I've been

2648
01:56:53,940 --> 01:57:00,239
able to engage and and I think it's

2649
01:56:56,580 --> 01:57:02,310
really important as someone who hasn't

2650
01:57:00,239 --> 01:57:04,440
done it that much but I'm convinced that

2651
01:57:02,310 --> 01:57:06,770
we have to do it we have to change it at

2652
01:57:04,440 --> 01:57:06,770
that level

2653
01:57:07,250 --> 01:57:12,020
thank you so much to the panelists into

2654
01:57:10,100 --> 01:57:14,989
the audience and I just want to remind

2655
01:57:12,020 --> 01:57:17,570

2656
01:57:14,989 --> 01:57:18,920

2657
01:57:17,570 --> 01:57:21,530
other people would want to hear this
