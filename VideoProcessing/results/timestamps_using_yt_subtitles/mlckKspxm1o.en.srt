3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,359
my name is Arrow Rella and we're at

4
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,359
nessen kig Farm in Lichfield New

5
00:00:26,359 --> 00:00:32,279
Hampshire Southern New Hampshire this is

6
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:35,120
a mixed vegetable farm uh 35 to 40 acres

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,239
of uh vegetable crops and it's a

8
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:40,280
certified organic farm and I've been

9
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:43,440
here 17 years so the vegetables uh that

10
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:46,520
I grow here primarily uh direct sales to

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,680
restaurants and uh specially food

12
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,719
purveyors that sell to restaurants and

13
00:00:48,680 --> 00:00:54,359
hotels a lot of culinary herbs salad

14
00:00:51,719 --> 00:00:57,239
greens uh more exotic things uh relate

15
00:00:54,359 --> 00:01:00,960
to uh Asian crops because most of my

16
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,559
workers are are Southeast Asian

17
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,159
basically cover crops are the foundation

18
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:08,119
of the farm an organic system one of the

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,400
ideas is to feed the soil that if you

20
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,240
take care of your soil then you're going

21
00:01:09,400 --> 00:01:13,600
to have healthy plants that are going to

22
00:01:11,240 --> 00:01:16,360
come from that here where this Farm is

23
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:19,520
in Southern New Hampshire uh found that

24
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:21,520
the best way for me to add biomass

25
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:23,520
organic matter into my soil to feed my

26
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,680
soil comes from utilizing green manure

27
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,680
crops we don't have access to animal

28
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,680
manur in this part of the state I'm

29
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,680
using two different

30
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:36,280
uh GRE manure crops and and uh they're

31
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,399
used a little

32
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,680
differently um start out in the Spring

33
00:01:39,399 --> 00:01:43,600
areas that either I have bare soil or

34
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,360
it's winterkill crops from the previous

35
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,799
year I couldn't get into a fall seated

36
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,880
cover crop I put in peas and oats and

37
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,640
and peas and oats is is quick growing

38
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:58,560
cover crop for the current growing

39
00:01:53,640 --> 00:02:01,479
season and um and then starting in

40
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520
August and September as I take pieces

41
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,079
out of production and vegetables that

42
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:11,759
were seeded that year then I'll seed

43
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,759
fields to uh uh winter rye and hary

44
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:27,360
vetch as soon as I can get on the ground

45
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:30,080
I'll seed uh fuel peas and oats spin it

46
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,840
on and then lightly Harrow it in and one

47
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,800
of the things I really like about it is

48
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,239
that also brings in early income my

49
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:39,120
earliest income in the spring because uh

50
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:42,040
the young peash shoots are very popular

51
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:45,400
with the restaurant trade and also with

52
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:48,319
uh Southeast Asian our Asian Chefs and

53
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:50,159
usually within about four to six weeks

54
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:52,879
of seating I have something I can start

55
00:02:50,159 --> 00:02:53,879
to harvest that's a really good starter

56
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,959
for the

57
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,720
springtime the P tendrils or PE shoots P

58
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,480
tips different names for it it's not

59
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,400
something you can sell tons T and tons

60
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:03,400
per acre I have tons of it in fact

61
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:05,159
that's one one of the reason I'm growing

62
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,360
it for is the biomass of the nitrogen

63
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:10,040
that the peas are fixing that so that's

64
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:13,319
but um on a normal year I probably can

65
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:16,640
realize grow sales between uh say8 and

66
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,959
$110,000 on uh five to 7 Acres that

67
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,959
might be seated to fuel peas and oats

68
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:39,879
so what we have here is a strip that I

69
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:43,920
started uh it was a strip of Harry Veet

70
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:46,439
and Rye I started turning over probably

71
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:47,640
uh mid April and everything was broken

72
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:50,120
down enough that I was able to

73
00:03:47,640 --> 00:03:53,319
transplant my tomato plants probably

74
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:55,920
about the third week in May and um

75
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:58,079
meanwhile the Ryan vetch on the beds

76
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,840
next to it we're continuing to uh to

77
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,400
grow

78
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:04,840
just about at this stage is the point

79
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,200
where you want to knock it down what I'm

80
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,280
looking for is for the vet to start to

81
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:12,159
go to flower or the the ride to be a

82
00:04:10,280 --> 00:04:14,599
pollen stage and what I like to do

83
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,519
ideally is to culate once with my

84
00:04:14,599 --> 00:04:20,959
tractor and then I'll knock it down with

85
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:24,400
with the mower and then once it's down

86
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,160
we'll use the straw as a mulch for the

87
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,759
tomato plants and then we'll bring in

88
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:30,720
some uh some steaks and do a basket weed

89
00:04:28,759 --> 00:04:33,400
system to bring uh you know trellising

90
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,280
for the tomatoes up out of the mulch I'm

91
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,199
utilizing the uh Straw from the strips

92
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:41,560
to start with the mulching process but I

93
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:44,240
try to have a block of of uh Ryan vet

94
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,520
nearby as you can see behind here and

95
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,680
I'll mow that down as I start to mulch

96
00:04:46,520 --> 00:04:51,840
these I'll have a good uh a good close

97
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:53,199
by area where I can bring in more mulch

98
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,320
without taking a lot of Labor removing

99
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,080
mulch from one area another area of the

100
00:04:55,320 --> 00:05:00,120
farm I look at the cover crops as as

101
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:02,400
biomass I mean two things that are very

102
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,160
important for the farm is nitrogen from

103
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,000
the fixing of nitrogen and the legum

104
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:07,680
that's part of the GRE manure and

105
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,919
biomass is very important so I want to

106
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:13,120
maximize my biomass which is bring it to

107
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,800
full maturity strip system was Harry V

108
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:18,080
and Ry overwintered and then cutting

109
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:21,120
strips in the in the springtime I use it

110
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:22,520
for wide space crops or crops that I

111
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,880
choose to grow in a wide space and that

112
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:26,440
may not traditionally be grown wide

113
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:29,319
spacing but uh pumpkins and winter

114
00:05:26,440 --> 00:05:31,639
squash easy to plant and 10-ft centers

115
00:05:29,319 --> 00:05:35,960
that work works very well and so I can

116
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:39,160
have 5ft wide beds with uh the adjacent

117
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:41,080
5ft wide strip of the Harry Veet and Rye

118
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:45,319
Tomatoes I have wide spacing so I can

119
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:45,319
get a good air flow for uh for

120
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:00,560
disease what we're doing here with green

121
00:05:57,800 --> 00:06:03,600
manure cover crops is I'm using them to

122
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:07,800
uh confuse Colorado potato beetles I cut

123
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:10,360
strips plant the potatoes I try to do my

124
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,039
uh weed cultivation and healing so that

125
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:14,759
the potato plants are are well

126
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,759
established and then at that stage I

127
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:19,800
knock down the Ryan vet and usually by

128
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,560
then it's late June early July and

129
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,880
that's the first the potato beetles even

130
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:26,520
come into the field I don't need to have

131
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:28,280
a big Mulch on the ground like I would

132
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,319
put on the tomatoes I just want to have

133
00:06:28,280 --> 00:06:34,240
some contact with the straw on the

134
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:36,759
potato plants with this

135
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:39,759
method uh I've never had to spray more

136
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:42,840
than twice and uh for potato

137
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,680
beetles and and and at best it's a spot

138
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:46,080
spraying I don't spray the whole field

139
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:47,919
because good portions of the field there

140
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,639
won't be any potato beetles at all it's

141
00:06:47,919 --> 00:06:52,039
usually on an edge of where they'll come

142
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:53,800
in to the end of the rows or an edge of

143
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:55,280
where a field of Sol acious crops were

144
00:06:53,800 --> 00:06:59,240
the preceding year and they'll find a

145
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,240
few a few rows

146
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,879
this is my sper which is the uh primary

147
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,879
tillage tool on the farm I use it for

148
00:07:15,879 --> 00:07:20,840
incorporating pretty much all of my

149
00:07:17,879 --> 00:07:23,120
cover crops it uh needs to operate at

150
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,879
slow speed and so that's you know one

151
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,800
disadvantage is that when you're

152
00:07:24,879 --> 00:07:29,560
bringing that organic matter in the soil

153
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:31,360
and that I can't move very fast because

154
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,960
it's a lot of biomasses chopping in

155
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:36,319
there but once it's in the ground and

156
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:39,360
I've made a couple of passes then I can

157
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:42,800
go in with a Fiel culator and do a very

158
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,240
rapid pass make a nice smooth seed bed

159
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,680
and then I'm ready to

160
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,440
go it's like a number of shovels and

161
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:52,080
just cuts clouds does a good job of of

162
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,120
chopping the straw into the soil but you

163
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,639
get nice clouds in that and and then

164
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,039
over time that they can break down

165
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,639
slowly so it's much gentler on your soil

166
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:01,800
structure and doesn't oxidize all that

167
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:03,759
organic matter you're trying to bring

168
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:05,159
into the soil when I first came here

169
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,360
there was a rototiller so that's what I

170
00:08:05,159 --> 00:08:09,800
learned on for primary tillage but uh I

171
00:08:08,360 --> 00:08:11,000
really didn't like what it did the soil

172
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:14,440
really beat the soil up like an egg

173
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:17,759
beater and I and I heard about uh spers

174
00:08:14,440 --> 00:08:19,759
being much better for soil structure and

175
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,800
better at incorporating biomass not

176
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:26,199
oxidizing it so this seemed to be a much

177
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,759
better Implement for improving my soil

178
00:08:26,199 --> 00:08:30,080
quality and that's really you know

179
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:33,680
important for me is is uh doing the best

180
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,680
I can for my soil
