  "text": "hey it's Matt from McGee farms and got into the winter time now had a pretty good first year with the garden here but I think we're going to revamp a few things we made a few mistakes that uh I think I'm going to try to try to fix but also uh in the winter time we're going to try some uh cold weather vegetables broccoli carrots lettuce uh some of that and with doing that I've got some PVC pipes that I'm going to cut down and I have these brackets right here that uh I'm going to use and I'm going to make some hoops for these and with making the Hoops we're going to put some uh clear plastic over it too and just keep it a little bit warmer because this is a pretty you know colder colder climate here in northeastern Missouri and uh we'll see how the Winter Garden go so uh first off I'm going to mount these on the sides and and then I'm going to cut these uh this/ in schedule 40 pipe down and make some make some hoops so I got the first one in and mounted and this is uh 31 in wide and I cut it at 6t and I think I probably probably would have been okay at 5T I think with the if I do the other bed I'm going to go at 5T just because the PVC is 10t and that way I can use uh two sections for each pipe rather than having to waste 4T of it but I've got got that in it really wasn't too bad bending and getting it in especially being chilly out here I was afraid the cold might make it a little hard to get in so I'm going to get the rest of them going to do another I think I'm going to try three on here see how that works I might have to come back and do to four per 8T bed and uh of course the lovely thing putting these brackets in I just uh cleaned out the horse stall and brought the uh leftovers down here so uh now I'm getting to work in that but you know it is what it is it's a good free fertilizer so I can't complain so I'm going to start putting the rest of these brackets in and get the rest of the Hoops done so I've got a couple of the hoop Loops up right now it's an 8T section I'm going to try with three see if that's strong enough I may have to come back and put a fourth one in as well uh went ahead and I planted some winter vegetables in here I've got some carrots I've got some lettuce I've got some broccoli green onions uh I think that's all I got in right now the winter vegetables that's about the only ones we we really eat I mean we don't eat kale we don't eat cabbage so uh so figure we'll try it I bought some uh plastic at a Home Depot I don't know if how it's going to hold up or not it's a 3.5 mil just clear uh plastic sheeting for like a painter's drop cloth so I'm getting ready to put it on I'm just going to staple it down to the uh top boards see if that's going to hold it or if uh the wind's just going to rip that off and I'm going to have to put some little T some little boards on top of it so we'll see I'm getting ready to do that now and I'll show you the finished product here in just a couple of minutes meanwhile enjoy some goats all right so I've got it down in there and what I uh kind of did I'm going to work on a little more is on the sides where I have the uh these trellises that I made out of the cattle panels I'm kind of working them in there to kind of Hope help hold them down in there and I took a staple gun I went around on this side and just stapled it down really good over here I uh I kind of bunched it up and tied it all together uh probably going to have to tie it down just a little bit better but uh I got thinking I'm like and I did stay pull it down in there but when I got over here I got thinking I'm going to have to get in there some way to harvest them and then plant more so what I did is I found a 1 by two that I had that have been sitting in the barn forever and I wrapped the plastic sheeting up with the 1 by two and uh and rolled it up till it got to about where the edges and then I use the staple gun to kind of staple it down as well and by doing that that should hopefully hold it it's going to sit on there and uh hopefully that'll keep it from going up and then whenever I want in there I can I can get in there a little bit I'm going to have to adjust it a little bit but we're going to try this out see how it goes I've got the uh other one over there that I'm going to do the same thing with and uh I've got on the end down here we're going to expand it out I've got some 10 put 2x4s uh we're going to go down a little more put some more arches uh trellises whatever you want to call them uh put a few more of these and because it worked really good we just didn't have enough space and so I'm getting ready to start in on that so it's Matt from mgee farms hope you enjoy the uh gardening videos as much as I do and the other stuff around the farm that we do if you like the videos give us thumbs up subscribe to the channel share it with your friends it helps the channel grow and it's always appreciated till next time have a great day",
