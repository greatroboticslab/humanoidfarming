1
00:00:05,540 --> 00:00:11,160
I grew up thinking of farms as places

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:13,259
with red barns cows and gray-haired men

3
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,480
with overalls I never thought about

4
00:00:13,259 --> 00:00:16,980
where the vegetables fit in or what

5
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:19,560
would happen when the gray-haired men

6
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:21,900
turned grayer as I and everyone around

7
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,840
me continued to grow up and depend on

8
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:27,960
farms for food I also grew up thinking

9
00:00:24,840 --> 00:00:29,699
that I might become an artist a model

10
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:34,559
a violinist

11
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:38,719
a comedian or even a fairy princess

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,719
anything but a farmer

13
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:42,020
until now

14
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,040
there have been incredible advances in

15
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,899
technology over the past Century some of

16
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,000
which are growing population could not

17
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,340
live without but some of these are

18
00:00:51,000 --> 00:00:55,800
asking our bodies and the environment to

19
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:58,020
compromise more than they can through

20
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,780
farming I have learned that we all have

21
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:03,780
choices when it comes to our food our

22
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:07,339
bodies and our environment things do not

23
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:07,339
have to be the way that they are

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:11,939
research has proven that people are

25
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:13,619
their happiest when they are part of a

26
00:01:11,939 --> 00:01:15,840
strong community and when they help

27
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,420
other people I have seen this happen

28
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:21,420
time and again in multiple farming

29
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:23,460
contexts and with every age group Rising

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:26,040
with the sun working with whatever

31
00:01:23,460 --> 00:01:28,320
weather has been dealt eating food that

32
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:30,659
has been grown with such care such

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,820
passion and hard work and doing this

34
00:01:30,659 --> 00:01:36,119
with other people creates a sense of

35
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:38,659
purpose a sense of connection a sense of

36
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:38,659
happiness

37
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:45,960
in so many ways this seems small a

38
00:01:43,020 --> 00:01:47,700
little farm in a little town somewhere

39
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:50,759
in Canada

40
00:01:47,700 --> 00:01:52,380
but it's not small it's big

41
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:55,320
have you ever heard of the butterfly

42
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,600
effect basically it's about how small

43
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:00,000
things can impart big change and

44
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,880
unimaginable and unpredictable ways

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,340
these large-scale implications of a

46
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,940
small farm are not always so Apparent at

47
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,800
first it starts with the small lessons

48
00:02:07,940 --> 00:02:14,420
Tomatoes aren't always red some are

49
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,580
green purple yellow and orange too

50
00:02:14,420 --> 00:02:19,379
cauliflower can be purple and corn

51
00:02:17,580 --> 00:02:21,720
leaves make beautiful music when the

52
00:02:19,379 --> 00:02:24,540
wind blows through them winter squash

53
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,420
grows in the summer

54
00:02:24,540 --> 00:02:29,580
from here we not only learn to look far

55
00:02:27,420 --> 00:02:31,739
enough into the future to anticipate the

56
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,720
Harvest of a ripe fruit but to the

57
00:02:31,739 --> 00:02:37,580
Harvest of healthier communities and

58
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:37,580
localized Food Systems as well

59
00:02:39,319 --> 00:02:44,760
so why this video

60
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:46,560
I am asking for your support this may

61
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:49,379
not be the most conventional way to

62
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,840
fundraise but as an organic farmer I can

63
00:02:49,379 --> 00:02:53,819
be a bit unconventional

64
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:56,040
for more information about the farm

65
00:02:53,819 --> 00:02:58,800
about where exactly your money would go

66
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:02,400
or to view additional resources please

67
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,500
visit my page on indiegogo.com if you

68
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,500
believe in the butterfly effect in being

69
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,760
a part of strengthening small businesses

70
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:11,040
empowering Youth and supporting

71
00:03:08,760 --> 00:03:14,099
Community then consider making a

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,379
donation no matter how small trust that

73
00:03:14,099 --> 00:03:18,780
a single donation like the flap of a

74
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,940
butterfly's wing can create meaningful

75
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,780
change

76
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:23,780
thank you

77
00:03:43,580 --> 00:03:46,580
thank you
