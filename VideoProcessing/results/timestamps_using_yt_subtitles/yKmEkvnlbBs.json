  "text": "hello my name is brian parman i'm the ag finance specialist in the department of ag business and applied economics i work in for extension and today as you can see from the title slide i'm going to be talking about backgrounding budgets and profits this particular talk we're going to be looking at steers and heifers running looking at several scenarios in terms of average daily rates of gain um as as so different feed rations as well as fattening or growing them up to different weights for both heifers and steers using current feed costs and prices as well as current market prices and so as i go through this uh obviously keep in mind that um what we're trying to do here is is see both a if there's some money to be made fattening or or background in calves as well as what is the sort of the optimal scenario and that's kind of what i'm what i'm hoping to hit on uh and again this is a lot of these are projections so when i go through the prices here we're taking today's prices and just kind of projecting with no real expectation of of price movement too much one way or another all right so compared to last year and i gave this a similar talk uh last year on backgrounding budgets and did some different scenarios but the the feeds the feed price situation is a bit different this year for one thing fall crop prices are much higher this year than they were last fall we had a situation here in north dakota last fall where we had a lot of low quality wheat that our our farmers weren't really sure what to do with and you might have been able to purchase some of that and feed it uh at a relatively low cost hay prices are are slightly elevated for for like grass hay a little bit lower for alfalfa hay and i'll show you that in a minute trucking and shipping costs and yardage costs uh in these scenarios uh remain mostly the same as last year not a lot of movement in those those costs and then cattle prices for feeder cattle are a bit higher than last year but not dramatically uh we're kind of you know if you'd uh looked at prices last spring you know we might have been thinking that feeder calves were going to be fairly cheap but prices rebounded uh quite a bit and so this fall we're kind of we're in a similar situation where we were last fall around this time in terms of the price of feeder calves so when you're thinking about backgrounding obviously whether you keep your own or you're going in and purchasing them we charge ourselves the market price for whatever 500 or 600 weight calf that we're we're retaining because obviously you could have if they were your own you could have taken them down the road and sold them and and received whatever whatever the market price was so you got to obviously charge yourself that so this is the corn pr price of corn i was talking about and i just wanted to show a chart of corn prices uh and this is on a continuous contract basis over the last three years and this fall you know if you see here on the right um is not not uh not the peak the peak was uh there in 2019 uh especially the early part of 2019 where we had that 4.54.80 corn for a for a period of time we're not nearly that high obviously the beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit for covid uh corn prices went down to nearly three dollars but here this fall we're seeing in over four bucks so and then if you compare it to last fall it was more like 380 so corn prices are elevated uh relative to last year that's that's for sure so this is this here is the 2020 alfalfa prices from usda uh this they just they collect average prices for uh and then they rate it premium good fare what we would typically what you'd probably typically feed beef cattle is going to be in that good or fair range um so our near our nearest neighbors south dakota for good hay 128 to 180 bucks a ton and then for fair a lower protein content maybe closer to uh 16 percent or or 14 protein 103 to 113 dollars per ton um for alfalfa and then we also have montana here uh similar uh maybe about the same as as what you're gonna see in south dakota so i'd use those as a proxy for for hay prices across north dakota is these uh these montana and south dakota prices which are tracked here and and again i'm going to show you on the next slide but how alfalfa price is down perhaps a little bit uh over last year and here it is 2019 versus 2020 alfalfa hay prices here's november 12 2019 we had uh montana at you know 110 to 180 and then 80 to 150 on this end so again it's a range but they're not dramatically different and then if we look uh here and then also south dakota 175 to 225 and then this year 128 to 180 so alfalfa is is lower especially the south dakota market than than what was seen last year so if you're thinking about feeding obviously feed costs are a big deal they're extremely important so we have a higher price of corn this year and a lower price in alfalfa and then grass hay grass hay prices are similar to last year's prices but again they're slightly elevated for whatever reason alfalfa is a bit cheaper than last year grass type hay is a bit more expensive than last year but not dramatically so pretty much your your hay costs i would expect them to be roughly if you did any background in last year roughly what they were uh the year before corn on the other hand not so much with with corn prices being as elevated as they are so here's my cost price assumptions as i'm as i go through this is i've got grass hay at 75 bucks a ton we're going to be using you know the high-end affair to good uh alfalfa hay prices here's corn silage corn grain at 380 a bushel um that would be if you know if you're growing it and you're looking at cash prices yes i know spot was closer to 420 but cash you're not going to get that not up here so 380 ddgs 160 a ton limestone bag salt and then some pre-mix yardage we're charging 35 cents a day that's what they charge at carrington we have this budget online that i'm going to be going through and you can change the yardage if you want to and and you you may see other budgets that have much higher or much lower yardage fees it really depends on how they break out the cost i've seen some instances where feed costs are included in the yardage so you'll see this really high yardage cost of maybe a dollar fifty a day or something like that well if you throw the lump the feed in there then that makes sense trump trucking at about 75 cents a hundred weight and then you got your vet costs and i'm just going to use a shrink and death loss of three percent and one percent respectively as we go through here so six different scenarios uh three steer scenarios and three heifer i'm gonna do the the first deer one is a 1.8 pounds 80 average daily gain and we're feeding from a 500 weight and to an 800 weight and then 2.8 pounds on a steer from 525 weight to 805 and then this one we're basically finishing going all the way from a calf to 1270 pounds at a really high rate of gain of 3.6 pounds and then heifers uh we're running two scenarios at 1.8 pound uh adg and that's from 450 to 750 and then 550 to 850. okay so that's 1.8 pound and then a higher rate of gain uh 2.8 pounds from 525 to 805 on the heifers so i'm going to go through these six scenarios and we're going to look at the profitability uh under each case so we'll start with steers we'll just run through the the steer feeding scenarios first and then and then again we'll go through the the heifer scenarios all right so the prices that i'm using are from the uh usda auction summary for north dakota so here's the average across the state a summary ending november 13th so when you're thinking about okay so what am i going to put in for my cost of a 500 weight steer i'm going to put them at 167 dollars a piece that was the average so if i'm going to background the steer my upfront cost is going to be 167 dollars per hundred weight and then when i go to put in the actual prices or the the revenue expectation let's say we're going to uh 850 pounds roughly i'm going to use this 139 uh dollar range now if i'm going to 800 weight now maybe one i'm going to use this 128. so if i'm going to 800 pounds i'd use this 128 at uh 850 800 plus or 850 plus this 139 and then for the finished one uh the the last scenario where they get really where we feed them up to 1270 pounds i'm gonna use this hundred and twenty seven dollars per hundred weight right here i had to cut this off and and attach it because the there isn't a ton of these sales so i'm not sure how strong this 127 dollars is but uh you know we could look around if we really wanted to get more detailed but again we're projecting because that animal is going to be on feed for a while so you could go through with your own budget there and play with that number that 127 and move it down say seven bucks or up ten bucks and and it would really uh make a difference in your bottom line but for this presentation since we're already doing multiple scenarios i didn't run that so that would be an interesting thing to do is once you decide maybe after you watch this and you do some thinking on your own operation you decide okay i'm gonna uh background 525 up to 850 pound steers uh i would go in there and play with the expected sale price uh per 100 weight there at the end and move that around once you decide on which scenario suits you best and see exactly how how much prices can move one way or another and you still make a profit or or how much the the loss would actually be so here's the 525 to 850 pound scenario uh a 1.8 pound average daily gain see it here and this is the ration um that was put forth and and i have to thank carl hoppy for putting these uh ration scenarios together for me based on what i what i needed him to do and so he had it uh we've got 10 pounds per head per day in grass hay 17 and silage two and a half pounds of ddgs and then a little bit of salt and then this comes out to about 88 cents a day for this for this scenario okay so then when i put it into the budget spreadsheet and there's a lot of stuff when you look at this budget there's a lot of stuff below this return to labor is management risk i cut all that off because what it adds up to are these these prices in here anyway so i just this way it fit on the slide better and you can see it but i used that projected selling price of 139. my beginning value was 167 as you'll recall and then we got the shrink shrinking death loss down here so weaned at 525 and we're feeding them up to 850 pounds that animal is going to be on feed for 180 days to achieve that at a 1.8 pound average daily gain and we basically get a profit of 13.28 so that's that's pretty pretty slim margin there on backgrounding under this scenario here this 1.8 pound average daily gain all right so our next scenario is this 500 pound to 800 pound steer and we're gonna feed them to uh achieve a 2.8 pounds average daily gain and we see here that they're gonna again i have this uh grass legume hay silage corn corn grain ddgs and then some salt for about 35 pounds total of feed 35.071 if you include the salt and obviously it's going to be more expensive to feed this animal per day at a dollar and six cents estimated cost to achieve this 2.8 pounds and we're going from 500 to 800 weight and then what you have here okay is so we're starting at this 500 weaning weight uh the cost is still about 167 dollars that's roughly what it was for those 500 to 550s for just same projected selling price because we're talking about that 800 plus range feed cost of a dollar six here's my yardage i always have it highlighted but that's where it is at that 35 cents so in this case we're making 72 dollars per head um by by getting that 2.8 pounds on there and while we're selling at similar weights and we're purchasing at the similar price uh putting on all that weight faster essentially we get a lower yardage cost not not in uh cents per day but in total cost because you see this animal is only on feed for for a 108 days versus that other one that was on feed for 180 days right so then that that yardage fee just keeps adding up i mean it's 80 percent longer that you're feeding that animal and the labor and everything that goes into it so what this is showing is that relative to like yardage costs and other things feed costs even though corn is higher are not all that high they're not prohibitively high so putting on the weight here is fa faster actually pays quite a bit more and you're looking at 72 dollars ahead and again some some of the stuff i'm putting in here for costs is conservative you might be able to do better um uh pay uh given what you're going to have to pay this year we we try to be realistic but a little conservative with some of this so again seventy two dollars and three cents okay so this is the the finisher uh scenario where we're going for a predicted date average daily gain of 3.6 pounds um this animal we're going from a 575 way to 1270 and that animal is going to average 34.4 pounds per day and the dollar per head per day obviously is quite a bit higher at a dollar 53 a day so this this critter is going to be on feed for quite a while to get there and it's going to be a fairly um strong ration to be able to achieve 3.6 pounds per day and here it is uh broken out on on the spreadsheet and so this projected selling price changes to 127 dollars per hundred weight so less than the others because because he's heavier the beginning value is a little bit lower because it's in the 575 you're getting close to the 600 weight category so that's 127 dollars right now this animal is going to be on feed for 193 days to achieve 1270 to go from 575 to 12 70 193 days but the profit on this is almost 250 dollars ahead so it the animal is on feed for a long time this steer is but you're putting on a lot of weight and so this is this is again showing that being able to put the weight on right now is definitely profitable and you're talking about two hundred and fifty dollars ahead uh profit uh by by feeding this animal all the way out to 1270 pounds at a very hot ration now i don't i don't have this scenario run but i can guarantee you if you drop this 3.6 to a lower value 2.8 or 1.8 or something like that and then he has to stay on feed a whole lot longer this profit will go down quite a bit so right now it's showing definitely that it pays to to put the weight on as quickly as possible so then the next three scenarios we're going to go through and and again i'm gonna at the end i have a table that i'm gonna show that compares all six scenarios so we can look at them side by side as i go through this but in this uh the next three are going to be a heifer backgrounding scenarios that uh carl hoppy also put the put the feed ration together for me uh and and i'm gonna go through the same budgetary budgetary discussion with this so media i use that same usda auction prices for the week ending november 13th in north dakota this is what i have nothing really over 766 weights so i have to finish it out there i'll use that price and then for the um the values or the costs of retaining the animal or going and buying them that obviously comes in here quite a bit cheaper than steers right now the price slide for heifers was pretty pretty severe this fall with you know almost 30 40 difference between heifers and steers per hundred weight right now so our first scenario were heifers from 450 to 750 pounds at a 1.8 pounds per day uh 28 pounds of feed comes out to about 83 cents per head per day in feed cost so putting on 300 pounds 1.8 pound per day at about 83 cents in feed costs and so here's that heifer scenario and what we wind up with we're beginning value at 126. i'm using the same shrink and the same death loss finished out at 750 and then headed down the road sale price at 113 dollars per hundredweight and we wind up with a profit of about 28 bucks per head in this case so profitable definitely uh always always better when this is above zero than below it but not terribly lucrative in this case where you're talking about barely thirty dollars per head but again it's kind of a theme that we're that that i'm showing in this in this scenario that uh it it's lower but it's similar to the steers this these lower average daily gain rates tend not to be as profitable as the higher ones as you'll see moving forward but they're putting on and then you know this animal's on feed for 165 days and again that's where that yardage of 35 cents really starts to add up um so then our next scenario is 525 pounds to 800 pounds so in this case we're putting on 275 pounds at that same 1.8 pounds average daily gain animals a little bigger when we get it so our our cost per day are higher right out of the gate at 90 cents per day and then the ration of 32 and a half pounds of feed today with uh with this breakout so here it is with the the the the numbers that were plugged in there and this is actually showing a loss and the big reason for that is that we're only we're making money putting on the weight and putting on 275 pounds for this long just isn't enough to pay out and that's what this is showing here and i i think i have this scenario uh toward the end of the presentation that i'm going to show uh where we where we make some adjustments real quick to it but beginning value is about the same similar projected sale price is about the same feed cost a little bit higher a lot cost the same and 155 days on feed that gets us a loss of two bucks so we we really aren't putting on enough weight in this scenario fast enough to actually pay off is is what this is showing and then our final heifer scenario is 550 to 850 pounds back to uh 300 pounds that we're putting on the animal at a 2.8 pounds uh per day so quite uh higher than the 1.8 before this is more expensive again per day at a dollar eight which which should be obvious because we're putting on more weight and here's the pounds of feed per day and the breakout there a lot of silage uh for this in this particular scenario again put together by uh carl hoppy for for this uh for this talk but this is our uh final heifer scenario there and then here is the breakout of the heifer scenario here and what we got 550 pounds to 850 this animal's only in the in the yard there for 107 days a lot a lot shorter period of time than the other two uh projected selling price roughly the same beginning value they didn't change much between 450 weights and 550 weights really and 126 feed costs at a hundred a dollar eight per day and we get down here and the profit is about sixty two dollars per head okay so quite a bit higher profit and getting to that 850 pounds and the explanation is again this yardage fee total cost on yardage is much lower because we're only at 107 days instead of 150 or 160 and and that's achieved by this higher average daily rate of gain so if you're seeing a theme here feed costs relative to the value of the pounds that are being put on is still relatively low and enabling us to to make a profit i'm not even messing with prices of fed cattle or anything like that this is just straight up showing that that putting on the weight uh that right now despite higher corn prices it's it pays to put weight on these animals so as i said there's a i was going to put together a profit loss breakdown that kind of compared them all side by side and so here's our three steer examples 1.8 2.8 3.6 average daily gains the the varying days on feed and then you kind of look here to this column the profit and loss and uh the more weight we put on or the faster we put it on the more valuable uh and the more profit we make so you see like this this uh fed out steer here from 575 to 1270 you we're profiting a dollar 29 per day per head uh doing that on the 500 to 800 weight at 2.8 pounds per day we're making 67 cents uh per head per day profit uh putting the weight on so that that's pretty solid and then this 1.8 pounds is is likely that's almost a break-even proposition it's just they're the the animals in the yard too long the yardage fees are starting to add up too fast and we're just not putting on enough weight um so then we come down here to the heifer scenarios and you see a similar theme with the exception of you know the the first scenarios is barely a kind of a break even proposition the second scenario for all intents and purposes i know it shows a negative two bucks but that's when you're doing estimates it's pretty close to zero so these two scenarios really don't help us out a lot it's not until we start putting on two three pounds a day or more that we start really seeing a profit and that's this 550 to 850 weight example putting on almost three pounds per day we're netting 58 cents to go up to 850 pounds okay so i think you guys are probably by now getting the theme of all of this which is that putting on weight as fast as you can pays now obviously you do you can't you there's only so much you can do but right now that that's that's the theme through all of the scenarios that i ran whether it's steers or heifers there it that it pays to put on weight not not go cheap or anything like that you know put the weight on pack on the pounds and get them out the door as quickly as possible that's what this is showing here so that we keep those yardage and overhead costs that you got to deal with labor and whatever else lower and as i said i had some scenarios so uh to kind of re emphasize that point and if we say all else equal what happens if i keep the 500 weight steer with 2.8 average daily gain to 850 pounds uh before that we we we had them down to eight hundred and look what it does it actually increases our profit pretty considerably to a hundred and eight dollars and uh and instead of what we showed before which i think was what 67 or something like that 70. so putting adding adding another 50 pounds onto the animal uh makes sense and the reason is because this 2.8 pounds average daily gain we're making money every quite a bit of money every day that that animal is in the yard at 2.8 pound average daily gain it's sort of a balancing act you're trying to figure out okay how much is it costing me to have this critter here in veterinary and labor and my own time and everything else and versus what about uh putting in the feed and feed costs and being able to to achieve these higher average daily gains and what this shows is that 2.8 pounds you're making money keeping them in the lot and putting weight on and and the other example that made quite a bit more with putting on 3.6 really pays because you're more than covering overhead and variable costs and every day that they're sitting there in the yard getting bigger you're making money alright so let's do the same thing with the heifer uh if we have all else equal what happens if i keep the 512 25 weight heifer with a 1.8 pound average daily gain to 850 and i i believe it went from a negative two dollars to 15.82 so what this kind of shows is 1.8 pounds is uh fairly close to a break even proposition on heifers we need to get a we need to have a higher average daily gain than that in order to really make a profit yes 1.8 pounds adg is is is above break even but just barely i mean and we're not we're that's the margin is too slim in my opinion to go with that so i would definitely be looking at trying to get to that three pounds per day or better on all my steers and heifers if i'm looking to background them and put some weight on and right now all the all the cost data and everything else and the market data is showing that that uh uh buyers uh are willing to to pay for weight that that's that's what they're willing to do and feed costs are low enough that we can put it on and make a profit as things stand right now so some key points to this presentation uh i'll reiterate it again it pays to put on weight so the purchase costs for 500 to 575 way steers are high but feed costs remain lower or low relatively low compared to what our market prices are for eight 800 uh weight animals all the way up to 12 1200 so what that says is you know it that there's money to be made doing this and then as i as i said it in the last few slides putting on weight faster is better because it reduces your yardage costs as well as the number of days the animal has to be managed for every pound gained okay so that's that's kind of the theme here is put on as much weight as reasonably possible as fast as possible uh and and you stand to make as much uh the most amount of money from from any kind of uh feeding enterprise so the other key points is you need to put on at least 300 pounds on heifers otherwise there just isn't enough enough there to really make it worth it so you're gonna want to if they're 500 pounds feed them up to eight eight fifty four hundred fifty pounds up to seven fifty eight hundred and again you're gonna wanna do it as fast as possible at least that 2.8 pound let's call it three pounds average daily gain i should definitely be your target so we're talking about 300 pounds per animal on the heifer side at three pounds per day that's that that should be our target and if we can achieve that all else holds equal where we stand to make a decent profit on on everything we retain and put weight on so that's kind of that's good news and and it's a similar story to what we were seeing last year that the last couple of years had they have paid for for producers to to put weight on these animals and and we're seeing that now as well so with that i'd like to thank everyone who watched i have my email address here i didn't put my phone number because i've been in and out of the office quite quite often with the stuff going on with covet and everything else a lot of working from home hence the reason we're doing this virtual versus last year where we did it in person but thanks to everyone who watched if there's any questions you can shoot me an email as shown here and i'll try to get to it as a in a timely manner otherwise i appreciate it and hopefully next year or here in the somewhat near future i can start doing some of this stuff face to face so thank you everyone and have a good week",
