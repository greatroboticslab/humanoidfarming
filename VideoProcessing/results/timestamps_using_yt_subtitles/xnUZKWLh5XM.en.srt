1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
well folks there's some things I'm just

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:07,620
not very good at and I still show you

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,599
anyways because uh I can stand to learn

4
00:00:07,620 --> 00:00:11,040
a thing or two and I don't know probably

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,360
some of you guys can too and then the

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
folks that know how to do it out there

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:16,740
can give us some pointers and hopefully

8
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,359
improve but today I'm doing something

9
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:20,760
I've never done before and that is

10
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:22,980
actually plowing a field now I've tilled

11
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:24,900
many a field I have discs Fields never

12
00:00:22,980 --> 00:00:27,300
plowed never turned soil like this

13
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:28,920
before and uh when you see the farmers

14
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:30,840
doing it they're doing big old tractors

15
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,840
but we've got a single bottom plow here

16
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,840
doing it on a little tractor just to see

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:39,660
how it does and it is a learning curve

18
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,219
and I think we did four rows and I think

19
00:00:39,660 --> 00:00:44,460
by the fourth row

20
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:47,700
I was getting better at it

21
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:49,440
not great but um you got to listen to

22
00:00:47,700 --> 00:00:51,539
your tractor first of all I mean there's

23
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,640
a lot of strain going on when you're

24
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,559
using a ground engaging tool like this

25
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,199
one here I was going too deep I wanted

26
00:00:55,559 --> 00:01:00,180
to take a full depth pass with it but

27
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:02,820
it's just it's just not going to happen

28
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:04,680
with a small tractor like this just

29
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,659
doesn't quite have enough oomph and so I

30
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,720
was trying to find a sweet spot there

31
00:01:06,659 --> 00:01:11,460
with it raised up a little bit and you

32
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,619
know trying to make sure the

33
00:01:11,460 --> 00:01:15,000
it was level front to back and I tweaked

34
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:16,439
that with the hydraulic top link a

35
00:01:15,000 --> 00:01:18,420
little bit here and there

36
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:20,880
and I could tell that when I was going

37
00:01:18,420 --> 00:01:22,439
faster it was really letting that the

38
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,140
side and the soil kind of spill out and

39
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,880
roll over like I think you wanted to do

40
00:01:25,140 --> 00:01:29,040
but there were times when it bogged out

41
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,580
and it was it was challenging to keep it

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,280
going that constant pace

43
00:01:31,580 --> 00:01:37,380
which I think is pretty visible in the

44
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,180
video now this patch of grass here is

45
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:41,880
what we're going to turn into a food

46
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:44,400
plot or a part of a food plot here later

47
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,140
this summer for the deer we had Jeff

48
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:47,280
Sturgis out with Whitetail habitat

49
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:49,079
Solutions and we've been talking about

50
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,420
him a bit and that's a lot of what we're

51
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,159
doing is putting his plan into place out

52
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,860
here with the intent of making it better

53
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,479
deer hunting and that it's not for

54
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:59,579
everybody but that's one of the reasons

55
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:00,899
I bought the property and it's um it's a

56
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:03,659
lot of fun to kind of do this stuff and

57
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:06,240
so while my results today are probably

58
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:09,179
not ideal keep in mind it's my first

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,039
time doing it only four passes and each

60
00:02:09,179 --> 00:02:12,900
pass is getting better and I think it's

61
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,580
going to make good results in the end

62
00:02:12,900 --> 00:02:17,040
here turn the soil over I don't know if

63
00:02:14,580 --> 00:02:18,900
it's ever been turned before this was a

64
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,420
pasture for cattle

65
00:02:18,900 --> 00:02:23,879
previously with the prior owner that

66
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,860
lived here and um

67
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:29,099
it's a good chance to try out a new tool

68
00:02:25,860 --> 00:02:30,300
with the summit tx25 tractor iron craft

69
00:02:29,099 --> 00:02:32,819
we've been talking about them lately

70
00:02:30,300 --> 00:02:34,379
they're a new partner and manufacturer

71
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:35,700
that we're working with where you see

72
00:02:34,379 --> 00:02:37,020
something on their website you can buy

73
00:02:35,700 --> 00:02:38,160
it through us

74
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,300
we're going to have it shipped right out

75
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:41,220
to you

76
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,959
and this single bottom plow here really

77
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,940
caught my eye get a decent amount of

78
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,140
requests for a tool like this for

79
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,080
smaller tractors they make a double

80
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,700
bottom or a two bottom pile as well

81
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,260
and so I was really curious to see how

82
00:02:50,700 --> 00:02:54,780
it worked a few things about this iron

83
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:57,180
craft plow one of the

84
00:02:54,780 --> 00:02:59,280
the first things that I was looking for

85
00:02:57,180 --> 00:03:00,420
a feature when I looked for anything is

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:02,280
going to be if it's quick it's

87
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:04,500
compatible and this was not quick hitch

88
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:06,239
compatible but the reason for that

89
00:03:04,500 --> 00:03:08,099
was legitimate and so the reason it's

90
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,660
not quick hitch compatible is that well

91
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:10,980
that first row you're on level ground

92
00:03:09,660 --> 00:03:12,480
you know both the left and the right

93
00:03:10,980 --> 00:03:14,159
side you're on level ground that's just

94
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,680
fine but after that you're putting your

95
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,780
right tires down in that Furrow that you

96
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:21,720
had just plowed out and so the tractor

97
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:23,519
is leaning and just the geometry of

98
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:26,640
everything you need to be able to

99
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,739
offset and use your side lengths to

100
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,140
rotate everything

101
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:32,879
and get the plow level even though the

102
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,500
tractor's out of level it's kind of an

103
00:03:32,879 --> 00:03:36,360
awkward thing but it makes sense once

104
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:37,560
you visually see it happening and so

105
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:39,420
that's the reason it's not quick hitch

106
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,980
compatible there it is sheer bolt

107
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:42,480
protected so if you whack something you

108
00:03:40,980 --> 00:03:44,099
know a big root or a big rock or

109
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,019
something on the ground it does have

110
00:03:44,099 --> 00:03:47,879
that shear bolt protection on there so

111
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:49,080
that will break right off and protect

112
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:50,519
the rest of the three-point hits the

113
00:03:49,080 --> 00:03:52,620
rest of the tractor from something

114
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,599
catastrophic happening to it we didn't

115
00:03:52,620 --> 00:03:56,400
have that happen here yet I would be

116
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:57,720
surprised if it does happen we have

117
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,180
pretty good soil that we're working with

118
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:01,860
in our area in Southwest Michigan and so

119
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:03,299
it is rated for tractors in this

120
00:04:01,860 --> 00:04:05,040
horsepower range you know the 25

121
00:04:03,299 --> 00:04:06,959
horsepower range that we're using on the

122
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,280
summit but it is near the low end of

123
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,500
that and

124
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:13,379
I think it's suitable for it as long as

125
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:15,239
you're not taking a full depth

126
00:04:13,379 --> 00:04:16,799
pass with it that's going to be where

127
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:18,900
you're struggling down is becoming

128
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:22,139
really unusable at that point they do

129
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,120
make deeper plows as well in both the

130
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:25,620
single bottom and the two bottom uh plow

131
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:27,540
on there too so you can get different

132
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:29,520
setups for different size machines out

133
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:31,680
there to suit your needs but you can see

134
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:34,220
similar to a long time ago when we used

135
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:37,080
a dirt dog subsoiler

136
00:04:34,220 --> 00:04:39,020
these these tools that go down to the

137
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,880
ground they require a lot of horsepower

138
00:04:39,020 --> 00:04:43,860
not just that but then the weight to get

139
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,020
the traction to the ground as well and

140
00:04:43,860 --> 00:04:47,340
even for that big 70 some horsepower

141
00:04:46,020 --> 00:04:50,220
tractor that we had pulling the two

142
00:04:47,340 --> 00:04:51,479
bottom sub soiler it was just about

143
00:04:50,220 --> 00:04:53,280
everything I had to pull that thing

144
00:04:51,479 --> 00:04:55,800
along and so it's it's not really a

145
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:57,960
knock on the tractors whether it's a

146
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:59,340
bigger a small one it's just that it's

147
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:01,380
just what you're asking it to do that's

148
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:02,880
a big job for it and a more extreme

149
00:05:01,380 --> 00:05:06,300
scenario now we're going to be shooting

150
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:09,000
this area here into uh into some greens

151
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:10,680
some some brassicas and some buckwheat

152
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:12,300
and some radishes and all that kind of

153
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,800
stuff and making a big old food plot to

154
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:15,840
draw the deer into the center of our

155
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:17,880
property and then kind of hunt the

156
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,500
oh the travel corridors that kind of

157
00:05:17,880 --> 00:05:21,720
come in from all the the bordering

158
00:05:19,500 --> 00:05:23,220
properties around there and you know I

159
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,720
could have just sprayed this off and

160
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:26,340
disc and tilt it but I wanted to try

161
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,780
something new and see how it went and

162
00:05:26,340 --> 00:05:29,220
I'm learning something different and

163
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:32,039
then someday the hope is to be able to

164
00:05:29,220 --> 00:05:34,620
master this tool which is some tools are

165
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:36,479
easier to use than others and

166
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,419
this one is it's tough it was tough to

167
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,979
keep in a straight line when I on the

168
00:05:39,419 --> 00:05:43,380
first pass when there wasn't anything to

169
00:05:40,979 --> 00:05:45,539
follow along uh the whole tractor kind

170
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:46,560
of one almost turned sideways or angle a

171
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,780
little bit

172
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,400
the subsequent passes were easier to

173
00:05:48,780 --> 00:05:53,639
follow that line because you're you're

174
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:56,639
right down in that row following along

175
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,440
but man it's not uh

176
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:00,060
it wasn't for the faint of heart but it

177
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:03,060
was a satisfying thing to do nonetheless

178
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:05,580
so I read somewhere online because I

179
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:07,320
don't know what I'm doing that you

180
00:06:05,580 --> 00:06:09,300
should start in the middle of the area

181
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:10,680
you want to plow up and then kind of

182
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:12,960
work your way out from there just around

183
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,240
around the circle and so

184
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:17,039
I was like all right I'll go down in the

185
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:18,720
middle of this and then do that I'll

186
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:21,060
just go around in a circle and work my

187
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:22,199
way out from the center but as soon as I

188
00:06:21,060 --> 00:06:23,460
got done with the first pass I was like

189
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:26,880
this doesn't make any sense because I'd

190
00:06:23,460 --> 00:06:29,160
have to go over that huge mound in that

191
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:30,539
whole row there that has plowed and so

192
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:33,240
in hindsight I think I should have

193
00:06:30,539 --> 00:06:35,160
started on on the outside

194
00:06:33,240 --> 00:06:38,280
and then just worked my way over from I

195
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:40,680
guess what the right to the left but I I

196
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,240
think in my mind

197
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:44,759
you have to always come back and start

198
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,740
at the other end unless you just started

199
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:48,660
well you can work your way outside in I

200
00:06:46,740 --> 00:06:50,400
suppose couldn't you you work your way

201
00:06:48,660 --> 00:06:52,259
outside here and just keep going outside

202
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,960
and inside and to the inside of the

203
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:56,460
inside yeah I don't know some things my

204
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,620
brain's not working

205
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:00,479
right now but maybe that's a possibility

206
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:01,860
too anyways I'm sure you guys will fill

207
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:02,639
me in you won't let me off the hook

208
00:07:01,860 --> 00:07:05,039
there

209
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,900
and that's okay because uh

210
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:09,419
I'm sitting in my tractor

211
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,280
having fun in the summer

212
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:13,259
playing with a new tool I'm not

213
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:14,580
complaining anyway so I got more work to

214
00:07:13,259 --> 00:07:16,020
do more learning to do so I'm going to

215
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:17,340
