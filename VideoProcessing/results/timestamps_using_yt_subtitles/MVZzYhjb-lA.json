  "text": "to feed the future Innovation Lab for small-scale irrigation otherwise known as the hill C project has been responding to the major challenges relating to agriculture nutrition and health across Africa for the last three years through research and leveraging agricultural innovations the project is uplifting lives of smallholder farmers across Ghana Tanzania and Ethiopia and also demonstrating potential for scaling up from individual farms to a national level and even further afield across the African contact [Music] in Ethiopia the work of the lab uses a combination of research training and innovative technology for use in the field to improve food production enhance nutrition and transform the economic standing of small-scale farming households across the country [Music] adequate and sustainable water delivery is the core component that will ultimately allow the Ethiopian farmer to grow and prosper the water lifting and delivery systems used in the field and supported by the LC project ranged from manual water lifting such as rope pulley and tanker based implements to motorized these or pumps and now an instrument that can be directly sourced from one of Africa's most ubiquitous resources the Sun solar power pumps provide cost-effective power sourcing and a reliable method for farmers in remote areas the solar panel has proved very useful before we used a lot water manually and put it in the hand now with the new solar pump the water goes straight into the tanker and I'm able to other the high steps this new method has saved me quite a lot of time energy and money and I will recommend this type of working technique to all other farmers to make the best use of the system I learned that it is important to save and conserve water and we now store all the water from the winter season in tankers this method has also allowed us to increase our yields we are now able to produce meat up to three times a year so I definitely suggest that solar technology be made more widely available the majority of the components for the SSI innovations can be made and more crucially to be maintained locally allowing cost effective and productive usage of all the primary irrigation tools a one of the tool that helps them to manage their water resources is the wetting front detector so this tool is our indicator of when to stop the derogation when the yellow flag within this wetting front detector pops up and we also installed some instruments that measures the soil moisture status of their their plot so that you know when to irrigate and when to stop the irrigation the all of the Innovation Lab is to define the most effective irrigation systems and practices from water lifting distribution and monitoring methods that will enhance the Lawrences of smallholder farmers like Girma Johanna and his family in Ethiopia and present the opportunity to transform the lives of the next generation of farmers [Music] [Music]",
