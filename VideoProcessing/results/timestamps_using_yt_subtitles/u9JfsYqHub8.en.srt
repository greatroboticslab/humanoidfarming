1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,799
soy beans or edamame are one of the

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:05,839
tastiest beans you can grow in your

3
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:07,600
garden

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,240
in today's episode we will show you

5
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,559
everything from planting soybeans and

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:16,200
harvesting them as well as a delicious

7
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,200
edamame recipe

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:23,600
so there are two ways to start soybeans

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,039
you can get seed packets from home depot

10
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,880
or loaves

11
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:29,199
and sow the seeds when the weather is

12
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,760
warm enough for soybeans to grow

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,040
spring summer and fall are the best

14
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:34,800
times

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:38,880
soybeans can grow very well in the

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:38,880
summer heat here in southern california

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,520
when starting from seeds you can sow six

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:46,879
to eight seeds in one whiskey barrel

19
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,879
container like you see here

20
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:53,199
the soil we have is a mix of compost

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,120
peat moss and perlite

22
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,120
after sowing the seeds make sure you

23
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,680
water well and now you're done sowing

24
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:02,320
the seeds the other way to grow soy

25
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,479
beans is to grow it from transplants you

26
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,560
can buy six-pack starter plants at your

27
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,119
local nurseries like the one you see

28
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,680
here and then plant them

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,960
buying transplants for soybean saves you

30
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,479
a lot of time growing it from seeds

31
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,400
once again we are growing this in a

32
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,520
whiskey barrel container and we are

33
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:24,400
planting six plants in one barrel

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:25,759
this container is 22 inches wide and 15

35
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:27,680
inches tall

36
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,200
holds about two and a half cubic feet of

37
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,280
soil

38
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:33,759
our planting mix already has a good mix

39
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:36,240
of organic nutrients in the soil we will

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,880
be using an organic liquid fertilizer

41
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,560
every two weeks as the plant grows as

42
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,159
well as some worm tea

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,799
links to all these products will be

44
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,200
provided in the video description

45
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,560
once planted water well so that the

46
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:53,280
roots can settle into their new home

47
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,920
soybeans grow best in temperatures of 75

48
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,159
to 85 degrees fahrenheit

49
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,280
in a few weeks from planting you can see

50
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,680
two things

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:05,040
the plant has problems with both insects

52
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:07,439
and diseases caterpillars spider mites

53
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,520
they all love the soybean plant making

54
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,959
growing soybeans a challenging project

55
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,800
in your garden

56
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,280
and here you can see a fungal disease

57
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
called rust which the soybean plant is

58
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:18,879
very prone to

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
it's a brown powder like fungal disease

60
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,360
on the plant you can also see spider

61
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
mite damage on the soybean plant in a

62
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
very short span of time

63
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,599
so what do you do

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:31,840
well it's neem oil to the rescue

65
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:35,440
neem oil is an insecticide to kill

66
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:37,760
insects it's a fungicide to stop rust

67
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:39,680
and it's also a miticide which means it

68
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,000
can stop spider mites

69
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,560
so a generous drenching of diluted neem

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,560
oil will give some respite to these

71
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:49,200
soybean plants

72
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:51,440
spray both under and over the leaves

73
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,040
and drench the plant completely

74
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:54,879
repeat this weekly

75
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,040
till you don't see any signs of insects

76
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,440
or diseases

77
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,080
and as you can see even after the weekly

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,720
neem oil applications the rust and the

79
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,480
spider mites have emerged stronger

80
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:07,360
the plant still has some damage due to

81
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:08,959
these

82
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:11,920
however does this really affect

83
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,480
production well we'll soon find out

84
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:16,720
soybeans grow in full sun so choose a

85
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,599
nice sunny spot with at least 6 to 8

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,519
hours of sunlight for your soybeans

87
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,519
we are transplanting six more soybean

88
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,920
plants into this raised bed

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,599
which receives a lot of sunlight

90
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,080
and here you can see the progress after

91
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,480
a few days you can see that the rust and

92
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,080
spider mites are still an issue here

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,519
with these soybean plants growing on the

94
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,519
raised bed

95
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
so it's been about two months since we

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,920
transplanted our seedlings and now you

97
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
can see the soybeans forming pods

98
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:46,480
and within these pods are the actual

99
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:47,920
soybeans or edamame so it's the time to

100
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:51,280
harvest

101
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:53,840
when harvesting remove the entire pods

102
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,239
and this is how soybeans look like they

103
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:58,560
look pretty good and i really wish these

104
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,959
plants were a little rust resistant

105
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,599
but overall for the size of the plants

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:05,200
we are getting a decent harvest

107
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:07,840
so what's the biggest advantage of

108
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,159
growing soybeans at home well they are

109
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,879
non-gmo they are much better for your

110
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,959
health than commercially grown soybeans

111
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,519
and they are very delicious as well

112
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,359
to get a good harvest of soy beans

113
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:21,120
remember to fertilize your soybean

114
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,240
plants with a good organic liquid

115
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:25,759
fertilizer as well as worm tea for good

116
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,520
results

117
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,919
and here is a harvest

118
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:32,080
as you can see we got a lot of soybeans

119
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,160
for the size of the plants we had so i'm

120
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,840
quite happy with the results if i had

121
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
grown more plants i would have gotten

122
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:39,280
more soybeans

123
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,360
the soybean plants growing in our raised

124
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:46,400
beds also gave us some soybeans

125
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,520
but you can see the plant had no vigor

126
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,280
despite us providing all the nutrients

127
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,440
as well as protection from insects and

128
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:55,840
diseases

129
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:57,680
let's open up these soybean pods to show

130
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:59,199
you how the soybean looks like inside

131
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,120
the pods

132
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:03,440
and these are the soy beans

133
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,440
that you can eat raw or steamed or

134
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,199
cooked

135
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:09,440
once the plants have completed producing

136
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,120
their pods for harvest you can go ahead

137
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,759
and remove the plants

138
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:16,400
what i wanted to show you here

139
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,320
is to pay attention to the roots

140
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,720
the soybean plant has roots that are

141
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,720
relatively shallow which means that you

142
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,479
can grow them in shallower containers as

143
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,280
well like the one smaller than the

144
00:05:24,479 --> 00:05:30,000
whiskey barrel containers shown here

145
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,680
soybean plants fix nitrogen in the soil

146
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,840
they have bacteria in their roots that

147
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:36,080
fix nitrogen from the air and make it

148
00:05:33,840 --> 00:05:38,000
available for the plant to use

149
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,560
since these plants had fungal diseases

150
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,639
like rust i will not be composting these

151
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,639
plants but rather they will go into the

152
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:46,560
yard waste bin

153
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,520
and now let's look at a delicious recipe

154
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:52,560
for our harvested soy beans or edamame

155
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:55,039
we are preparing air fried edamame first

156
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:57,120
we take the soy beans whole with the

157
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:59,360
pods in a bowl

158
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:02,400
then we add in some salt

159
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:04,400
i usually use himalayan salt but this

160
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,080
time i had sea salt so that's what we'll

161
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,000
be using

162
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:10,000
add in a little bit of oil

163
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,880
remember that very little of this oil

164
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:15,120
will be actually absorbed by the edamame

165
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,560
but adding oil gives a very nice flavor

166
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,840
to the pods when you're eating the

167
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:22,000
edamame and that is quite

168
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,160
amazing the oil also helps the salt to

169
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,919
stick to the pods more evenly

170
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:26,639
you can skip the oil if you do not want

171
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
it

172
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:30,720
you can preheat your air fryer if needed

173
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,039
i did not

174
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,319
add the soy bean pods or edamame to the

175
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
airfryer

176
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:39,600
set the airfryer to 375 degrees

177
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:41,360
fahrenheit and cook for about 15-20

178
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:45,600
minutes

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,600
tossing them around the halfway mark

180
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,240
soybean dishes are actually called

181
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,960
edamame because in japanese the term

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,960
edamame means stem beans or the

183
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,240
preparation where beans are still

184
00:06:54,960 --> 00:07:00,160
attached to the pod when cooking

185
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:02,720
as you can see here the pods protect the

186
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:04,880
soy beans from overcooking

187
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,479
and these home grown soybeans will be

188
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:09,039
one of the best tasting soy beans you

189
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,120
will ever eat

190
