1
00:00:03,200 --> 00:00:07,600
well welcome everyone uh thank you for

2
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,960
joining us and

3
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:11,360
we have

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,800
we so this is the i think the third of

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:13,840
the series i think there's one more

6
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:15,040
after this

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,800
and today we're going to be talking

8
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:18,160
about grain drying storage and farm

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,880
safety

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,640
so i'm sam markell i'm the interim anr

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,640
director co-interim anr director for a

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,840
probably pretty defined short period of

13
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,000
time here since we're interviewing two

14
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:33,920
candidates um we have two people with us

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,399
ken hellevang is a professor and

16
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:37,600
extension agricultural engineer

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,559
so ken

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,320
has been a specialist for 42 years so

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:46,480
he's got a lot of experience he also

20
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,960
took one for the team as uh as a

21
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,879
department head for three years and a

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,440
few months as an anr director before

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:54,719
muhammad and i so he's done a lot of

24
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:56,239
service work in there we really

25
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,239
appreciate that

26
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,399
he also for those of you at big iron the

27
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:03,840
what was they can the best small indoor

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,640
exhibit award i think that's right yeah

29
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:06,320
so

30
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:08,560
ken was involved with that angie was

31
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,360
there the whole time too so so ken will

32
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:13,600
talk first and he's going to talk about

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,080
some harvesting and drying for maybe 20

34
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,560
25 minutes we'll have a q a and then

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,320
we'll switch to angie and angie was a

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:21,920
county agent for seven years and now

37
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:24,000
she's the ranch

38
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,960
farm and ranch safety coordinator did i

39
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,799
get that right angie yeah so then she'll

40
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,640
talk about some of the safety issues

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,560
that we face again maybe you know 20

42
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:34,240
more minutes or so and have another q a

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:37,840
so that's that's what today will be done

44
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:39,520
we we will at 11 15 we'll stop promptly

45
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:41,600
or shortly before depending on the

46
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:43,360
questions so

47
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:44,880
ken if you wanna and scott swanson's

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,560
with us so if you have any technical

49
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
issues scott's your guy

50
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,439
so ken why don't you go ahead and take

51
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,040
it away

52
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:51,920
okay

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
well

54
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:58,560
good morning everyone and

55
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,719
as hopefully you can see my slides i've

56
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,520
been a good extension person i say that

57
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,280
i can't talk without slides

58
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:08,080
so we're going to focus

59
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,000
on kind of the harvest and drying

60
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:14,640
situation

61
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,840
for corn soybeans and sunflower

62
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:20,239
and

63
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:22,400
i've titled it october of 2022

64
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,800
i frequently will tell farmers and

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,599
others that when i'm doing presentations

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,920
that i like to cover the fundamentals

67
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:31,680
because each year is different

68
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,680
each year gives us

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:36,560
challenges and so

70
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:38,800
if we look at

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,160
this year

72
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:44,640
as of

73
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:47,280
the crop and report yesterday

74
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,120
things are moving along

75
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,879
i always watch the

76
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,959
crop report

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,120
as we go through the growing

78
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,760
season because i try to

79
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,840
use that then to give me a signal of

80
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:03,200
what i need to be covering

81
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:05,760
for harvest and drying and storage

82
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:09,920
and then it gives me

83
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:12,959
an idea of where we're at particularly

84
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,239
this year with our late

85
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,720
planting

86
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,280
but because of the warm temperatures we

87
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,159
pretty much caught up

88
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:22,640
so

89
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,840
what i've got on the slide is

90
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,959
this year's september 2022 versus the

91
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:29,200
five-year

92
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,560
average and when we look at corn

93
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,159
maturity

94
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:36,159
we're about 26 percent uh

95
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,280
pretty close to normal

96
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,120
soybean leaf drop 57

97
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:44,000
versus 72

98
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:47,200
for a five year average

99
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:50,319
but soybeans will will change quickly

100
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,959
uh and then if we look at sunflower

101
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:56,480
uh we're at about 30

102
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:58,239
versus 34 so again pretty typical

103
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:01,040
conditions

104
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:04,000
but i always

105
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,560
say that reaching maturity is is just

106
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:11,599
the first step in the process

107
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:14,159
uh corn for example has about a 35

108
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:15,360
moisture content once it reaches

109
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,880
maturity

110
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:20,079
and of course we don't want to be

111
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:22,160
harvesting 35 percent moisture

112
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:24,479
and so then we start thinking about what

113
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:27,120
is the dry down

114
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
and for soybeans that's not as big of an

115
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,479
issue typically

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:34,400
because they drive fairly rapidly

117
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,880
as long as we have decent drying

118
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,080
conditions actually

119
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:44,240
there's potential for it to get too dry

120
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,240
and we'll talk some about that

121
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,600
so what's

122
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,960
what are we looking at uh i always look

123
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:56,080
at the

124
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:58,000
weather forecasts uh trying to look at

125
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:01,600
what what are we going to

126
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:04,320
be dealing with is it a dry harvest is

127
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:08,240
it a wet harvest and it can start out

128
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:10,479
wet and get dry or vice versa

129
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,360
the 8 to 14 day

130
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,560
temperature outlook is in the top left

131
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,600
corner

132
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:19,680
uh up in this area here

133
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:22,160
and it looks like we're going to be

134
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
above normal temps and even if you look

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:24,880
at the

136
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,000
the

137
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:29,440
10-day forecast that the weather service

138
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:31,039
and other places

139
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,520
put out

140
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,919
looks like we'll have no trouble

141
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,039
reaching maturity

142
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:39,759
as we

143
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:42,639
finish off this growing season

144
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,960
but when we look at october

145
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:48,240
we're continuing to be

146
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,800
it says potentially above normal

147
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:53,759
temperatures

148
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:56,080
the central part of the country is got a

149
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,160
much higher probability

150
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,280
but

151
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:03,440
probably but their guess as of

152
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:05,039
right now is that october is going to

153
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,840
continue the trend

154
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:07,840
that we've had

155
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:13,039
when you start looking beyond that then

156
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:15,680
we get equal chance of

157
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:17,120
above normal normal

158
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:19,039
conditions

159
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:21,360
and so

160
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:24,560
that always worries me a little bit that

161
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,039
as we get to november

162
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,639
that things might be turning the other

163
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:33,039
way and that's why we start seeing

164
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,199
a change in that pattern

165
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,440
if we look at precipitation we're going

166
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:39,440
to continue to be dry

167
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,400
for the 8 to 14

168
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,919
but as we start looking into

169
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,880
october

170
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:49,840
then we're at equal chance of being

171
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:51,919
above or below which i say ends up

172
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:56,240
putting us pretty much at

173
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:59,599
a normal probability and that means that

174
00:06:56,240 --> 00:07:00,240
we could be wet we could be dry

175
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:01,120
and

176
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,479
that's

177
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:07,599
the challenge and if we start looking at

178
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:11,440
even the the seasonal which is october

179
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:14,400
november december we're trending to that

180
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,800
equal chance again

181
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:18,400
and so even though temperatures are

182
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:20,639
looking pretty good

183
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:23,280
uh precipitation

184
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,800
as we start getting into october

185
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
is less certain

186
00:07:29,280 --> 00:07:34,880
okay if we get normal temperatures and

187
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:38,160
conditions uh

188
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:41,919
how rapidly will will the grain dry down

189
00:07:38,160 --> 00:07:43,599
and we'll focus first on corn

190
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:44,400
uh and this

191
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:47,280
table

192
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:50,319
uh includes a number of different

193
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
factors related to that dry down

194
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:54,560
uh we'll skip september and just look at

195
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
october

196
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:59,840
if we're looking at

197
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,120
the first column here uh it says

198
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:04,400
16 moisture so that's the moisture

199
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
content

200
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:09,680
uh that would be

201
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:12,960
potentially the the ending moisture

202
00:08:09,680 --> 00:08:15,520
content if we had good drying conditions

203
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,680
so that's favorable

204
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:19,000
number of

205
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,599
primarily

206
00:08:19,000 --> 00:08:24,879
agronomy-focused people look at growing

207
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:27,520
degree days and try to make a prediction

208
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:31,039
off of that i just was on and

209
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:33,680
looked at a pioneer for example

210
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,839
they have where they say it takes about

211
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:38,240
30 to 45

212
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:39,440
growing degree days to take off a point

213
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:42,240
of moisture

214
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:44,720
if you look at that predictor

215
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:47,519
that would only say we would drive four

216
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:51,600
to five percent during the month of

217
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:54,399
october and that's not reality and so

218
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:56,720
i've if you hear people talking about

219
00:08:54,399 --> 00:09:00,560
growing degree days and how it

220
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:04,080
correlates with with dry down

221
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:07,120
i wouldn't listen too intently to that

222
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:08,720
iowa state university has put together a

223
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:10,320
calculator

224
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:12,800
that's on the web

225
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,440
you just do a search for

226
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,800
iowa state university dry down

227
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,760
calculator

228
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,760
and it

229
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:25,440
has you put in

230
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,640
the moisture existing moisture content

231
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,600
and the

232
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:30,560
date

233
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,519
and it'll calculate a prediction based

234
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:32,720
on

235
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,240
weather

236
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,680
conditions

237
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,800
over historically weather conditions

238
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,760
and if we

239
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,720
use that model it'll show that we would

240
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,839
expect

241
00:09:42,720 --> 00:09:48,240
maybe about a 14 moisture reduction

242
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,720
during the month of october

243
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:53,399
so if we're starting out at 35 that

244
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,959
would say that we would be at about

245
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:58,959
21

246
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:02,160
moisture at the end of october

247
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,320
i've used a prediction where i go to the

248
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:06,399
north dakota agricultural weather

249
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,440
network and look at potential

250
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,240
evapotransportation

251
00:10:08,440 --> 00:10:12,640
transpiration

252
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,560
which is what we use to calculate

253
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:18,399
irrigation needs in the summertime

254
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,560
it takes into consideration

255
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:24,959
temperature wind

256
00:10:20,560 --> 00:10:28,160
solar radiation relative humidity etc

257
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,440
i think it's a good way of making a

258
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,200
prediction

259
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:33,680
and depending on

260
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,760
year and where you're at in the state

261
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:40,000
we're probably looking at

262
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:43,600
about three inches of water removal

263
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:46,720
based on that p-e-t

264
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:50,000
that would then translate into drying of

265
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:53,120
about 11 to 12 percent not quite as

266
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,440
optimistic as the iowa state one

267
00:10:53,120 --> 00:10:57,920
and i'll say we're looking at maybe two

268
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:02,079
and a half or at most three

269
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:04,640
percentage points of moisture removal

270
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,760
during the month of october

271
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,720
so

272
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,560
likely unless we're harvesting very high

273
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,880
moisture corn

274
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:15,600
a lot of corn is going to need the whole

275
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:19,839
month of october to dry

276
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:21,839
as we shift to november unfortunately

277
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,959
we look at the equilibrium moisture

278
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,040
content or that field moisture

279
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:30,640
increasing

280
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:31,600
the amount of moisture removal is almost

281
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,320
nil

282
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:36,560
we'll maybe pick up a point a week

283
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:39,040
and so

284
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,600
my typical recommendation is that we

285
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:44,399
need to be planning to harvest

286
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:47,200
corn the latter part of october early

287
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:50,320
november as pretty much the drying is

288
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,320
done at that point

289
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:58,079
if we look at

290
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:00,640
following that moisture content we're

291
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,079
going to be using a moisture meter

292
00:12:00,640 --> 00:12:05,279
to

293
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:07,920
measure that grain moisture content

294
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,320
keep in mind though that the meters are

295
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:13,200
calibrated for 15

296
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:15,360
moisture corn and as the

297
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:17,120
moisture gets higher

298
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,880
it's more in air

299
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,000
so if you're checking 25 moisture corn

300
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:26,720
uh it's probably

301
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:27,920
as much as a point or more off at that

302
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,160
point

303
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
also we need to be adjusting for

304
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,399
temperature

305
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,399
we start harvesting corn in november

306
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:37,519
when we have temperatures

307
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,760
that are

308
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:41,760
below 40 degrees

309
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,839
most of the meters are not going to

310
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:44,720
allow you to take a reading

311
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:46,800
or

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,200
will give you an inaccurate reading

313
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,399
below 40 degrees

314
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:54,959
also they are sensitive to moisture

315
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:57,760
variations across the kernel

316
00:12:54,959 --> 00:12:58,720
so i really encourage people to take and

317
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:01,279
and

318
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,240
do that initial moisture measurement put

319
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:05,440
the

320
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,120
corn in a sealed container like a ziploc

321
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,720
bag or something

322
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:12,959
give it 6 to 12 hours to equilibrate to

323
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:16,320
room temperature

324
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:18,480
and then recheck that moisture content

325
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:21,839
just to make sure that we're getting an

326
00:13:18,480 --> 00:13:21,839
accurate reading

327
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:26,959
i don't anticipate a lot of use of bags

328
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:30,160
this year

329
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:34,320
but if if some are using

330
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:37,120
the poly bags for corn storage

331
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,560
that corn needs to be dry if we're in

332
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:42,639
the 25

333
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:44,240
to 35 percent moisture range that corn

334
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:47,600
will go through the

335
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,079
the in sylene silage making process

336
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,760
which we don't want for most of our our

337
00:13:50,079 --> 00:13:57,040
corn

338
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:59,760
in the 15 to 24 percent moisture range

339
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,399
we're gonna have heating and spoilage

340
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:03,440
uh unless we're at winter temperatures

341
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
if we

342
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:09,839
can consistently stay below 30 degrees

343
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,519
then we may get by at those higher

344
00:14:09,839 --> 00:14:15,040
moisture contents

345
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:16,399
but essentially the corn or grain needs

346
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,320
to be dry

347
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,790
going into the bag if we're going to be

348
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:22,830
safely using a bag

349
00:14:19,790 --> 00:14:22,830
[Music]

350
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,680
in addition to moisture content

351
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:33,360
sometimes we'll get people thinking well

352
00:14:30,880 --> 00:14:36,079
it's a sealed container and so

353
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,880
that will prevent mold growth

354
00:14:36,079 --> 00:14:39,199
or

355
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,839
prevent insect activity

356
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,639
both of those are false

357
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:46,399
we recommend running the bags north and

358
00:14:44,639 --> 00:14:47,760
south so that we get

359
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:50,880
even solar

360
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:51,760
heating on the two sides

361
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,480
and

362
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,279
keep in mind the

363
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,040
the

364
00:14:55,279 --> 00:14:59,600
temperature of the grain will be

365
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,560
whatever the average outdoor temperature

366
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:04,880
is

367
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:07,519
so the bags work well for winter storage

368
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:10,800
but if we're storing into spring it

369
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,800
really needs to be dry

370
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:16,079
there's

371
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,480
lots of variations or options for

372
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:21,199
high temperature drying

373
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:23,519
and i've just included a

374
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:25,760
collection of different dryers

375
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:28,880
on the slide

376
00:15:25,760 --> 00:15:31,839
there is a presentation on my website on

377
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:34,800
the different types of dryers and i

378
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:39,040
could if someone has an interest

379
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:41,360
i could do an hour presentation just on

380
00:15:39,040 --> 00:15:45,120
the different characteristics of the

381
00:15:41,360 --> 00:15:45,120
different high temperature dryers

382
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:51,680
one of the things though that that

383
00:15:47,760 --> 00:15:53,519
frequently comes up is what is the

384
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,519
cost to dry

385
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:58,000
and if we're strictly looking at the

386
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:58,000
energy

387
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:02,560
most of our dryers high temperature

388
00:16:00,399 --> 00:16:04,399
dryers drying corn

389
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:06,800
we'll be looking at

390
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,920
about 2500

391
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:11,759
btus of heat required to evaporate a

392
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,639
pound of water

393
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,279
and

394
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,360
we can then use that information

395
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:19,519
to calculate

396
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:20,800
what that cost would be

397
00:16:19,519 --> 00:16:24,079
we take

398
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:27,120
the multiplier of .022

399
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,320
times whatever the propane price is

400
00:16:27,120 --> 00:16:33,519
and that gives us the cost

401
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:35,360
per bushel point of moisture removal

402
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:37,839
some of the newer

403
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,880
dryers that include

404
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:45,120
the more energy efficiency features

405
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:49,519
might be down closer to 2000 btus

406
00:16:45,120 --> 00:16:52,720
and then that conversion factor is .018

407
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:55,920
but for example if we had a dollar per

408
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,720
gallon propane we take that times

409
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:00,880
point zero two is kind of an in-between

410
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,839
number between the two

411
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:05,839
uh and that shows us about two cents per

412
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,039
bushel per point

413
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,839
and it's a straight linear relationship

414
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:13,199
so

415
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:15,600
if propane is two dollars a gallon

416
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:18,400
uh we'd be looking at four cents per

417
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:20,880
bushel per point of moisture removed now

418
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:23,760
that's strictly just the

419
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:24,720
the cost of the propane it doesn't

420
00:17:23,760 --> 00:17:27,520
include

421
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:30,000
all the other associated costs that are

422
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:30,000
involved

423
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:36,160
if we look at

424
00:17:33,039 --> 00:17:39,280
trying to calculate how much propane is

425
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,760
actually being used

426
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,280
there's a fairly simple formula for that

427
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,880
as well

428
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:47,919
again .02 times the bushels that we're

429
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,039
drying

430
00:17:47,919 --> 00:17:53,360
times the point of moisture removal

431
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,440
so if we're drying a thousand bushels

432
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:56,799
and we're taking off 10 points of

433
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:59,600
moisture

434
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:01,360
that amounts to about 200 gallons of

435
00:17:59,600 --> 00:18:03,039
propane

436
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:05,679
so one of the things they've been

437
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:08,960
talking about for this fall

438
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:11,200
is that you make sure that you have

439
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:13,120
your propane

440
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:15,520
contracted or

441
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,120
available so that when it comes time to

442
00:18:15,520 --> 00:18:18,799
do the drying

443
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,440
maybe in in

444
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,480
late october early november

445
00:18:21,440 --> 00:18:24,880
that

446
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:28,840
we know how much propane that we're

447
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,840
likely going to be using

448
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:35,919
particularly in some of the newer

449
00:18:32,559 --> 00:18:39,039
areas where they're growing corn for

450
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,039
the first times

451
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:44,400
guys will try to get by with using

452
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:47,039
natural air drying where we're just

453
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:49,440
moving the air through the bin

454
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:52,320
if we're doing that the maximum moisture

455
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,080
that we can handle is about 21

456
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,880
moisture

457
00:18:54,080 --> 00:19:00,080
we need an air flow rate of at least one

458
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,720
cubic foot per minute per bushel

459
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:06,240
uh and i'll show you on the next slide

460
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:07,600
that that works okay in october but not

461
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:10,320
november

462
00:19:07,600 --> 00:19:11,520
so typically what we're doing is cooling

463
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,480
the corn

464
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:17,039
and holding it wet over winter and then

465
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:18,320
doing the drying in the spring

466
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,640
and we'll

467
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:21,919
normally recommend when outside

468
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:24,880
temperatures

469
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,200
are averaging above 40 degrees

470
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,600
is when we start that

471
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:32,080
natural air dry

472
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,280
lots of numbers on this

473
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:36,799
table

474
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:39,200
what i want to focus on is your the the

475
00:19:36,799 --> 00:19:40,640
november

476
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,000
roll

477
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:45,120
that

478
00:19:42,000 --> 00:19:47,840
because of the cooler temperatures

479
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:50,640
we start looking at very little moisture

480
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:54,320
holding capacity in the air

481
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:56,400
and we're looking at 70 days of fan time

482
00:19:54,320 --> 00:19:59,760
to do the drying

483
00:19:56,400 --> 00:20:02,480
uh and even if we start adding heat a

484
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:06,080
lot of guys think well i'll just go out

485
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:09,120
and buy a heater and warm the air

486
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,679
and if we heat the air 10 degrees

487
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:13,200
it does shorten that drying time a

488
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:16,640
little bit

489
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:18,400
but we also end up over drying the corn

490
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:20,559
we're now down at

491
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:24,799
12 and a half percent moisture and it's

492
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:28,320
still taking 51 days of drying time

493
00:20:24,799 --> 00:20:31,679
so pretty much i say that

494
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:34,679
natural air drying just does not work in

495
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,679
november

496
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,480
spring drying works very well again like

497
00:20:37,919 --> 00:20:41,760
i said starting when temperatures are

498
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,960
averaging

499
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:47,360
uh 40 degrees and warmer

500
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:50,320
we're still looking at

501
00:20:47,360 --> 00:20:52,960
40 to 50 days of fan time

502
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:55,120
but it will dry that corn down

503
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,559
as long as we're starting at that

504
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:59,600
20 21

505
00:20:56,559 --> 00:20:59,600
percent moisture

506
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:05,600
every year uh we have a few bin roofs

507
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:07,280
that

508
00:21:05,600 --> 00:21:09,919
they are damaged

509
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:12,240
because as the air goes through the

510
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:14,080
grain it picks up moisture

511
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:16,799
if the temperature

512
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:20,799
is at or below freezing

513
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:24,240
it'll ice those uh gooseneck vents open

514
00:21:20,799 --> 00:21:25,919
over the screens and those just uh

515
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,919
seal up tight

516
00:21:25,919 --> 00:21:30,559
so anytime we're running fans at

517
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:33,280
temperatures near below freezing i

518
00:21:30,559 --> 00:21:34,080
recommend leaving the fill and axis door

519
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,880
open

520
00:21:34,080 --> 00:21:40,080
as a pressure relief valve otherwise

521
00:21:36,880 --> 00:21:44,120
it's just going to pop that bin roof up

522
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:44,120
and damage it

523
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:49,200
let's shift gears and talk briefly on

524
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,559
soybeans

525
00:21:49,200 --> 00:21:53,760
optimum moisture is about 13

526
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:56,080
moisture

527
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:58,799
one of the characteristics of soybeans

528
00:21:56,080 --> 00:22:00,080
is that they change moisture very

529
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,080
rapidly

530
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:04,320
and so

531
00:22:02,080 --> 00:22:07,840
everyone is familiar with

532
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:10,080
it might be 15 moisture

533
00:22:07,840 --> 00:22:13,200
in the morning and by

534
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:14,880
a warm dry afternoon we might be down to

535
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:17,360
11

536
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:19,440
and the amount of breakage that occurs

537
00:22:17,360 --> 00:22:22,720
the damage to the beans

538
00:22:19,440 --> 00:22:25,600
and the field loss shelling in the field

539
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:28,559
uh go up as we start getting moisture

540
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:29,760
contents below 13.

541
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:33,039
so

542
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,440
the farmers really need to be

543
00:22:33,039 --> 00:22:37,039
doing whatever they can to harvest as

544
00:22:35,440 --> 00:22:41,600
much as they can

545
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:44,720
at that 13 moisture

546
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:48,240
if we get into a situation where

547
00:22:44,720 --> 00:22:51,039
we get rain showers coming through

548
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:51,840
some years it it's very difficult to get

549
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:54,640
the

550
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,159
soybeans dry out in the field

551
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,039
we can run them through a high

552
00:22:56,159 --> 00:23:01,200
temperature dryer but we have to limit

553
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:03,200
the drying temperature

554
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:06,320
and we're still going to end up with

555
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:08,159
some breakage and damage going through

556
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:11,440
the dryer

557
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,520
the other characteristic of soybeans

558
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:17,360
are that we have a

559
00:23:13,520 --> 00:23:19,120
significant fire hazard because the pods

560
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:20,960
and other trash

561
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:23,600
that it goes through

562
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:25,280
the dryer tends to become lodged and

563
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,080
then over dried

564
00:23:25,280 --> 00:23:30,240
and becomes tender

565
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,559
and so

566
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:34,799
they need to keep the grain flowing we

567
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,360
need to keep the dryer clean

568
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:40,559
we may need to be

569
00:23:37,360 --> 00:23:42,159
monitoring that dryer continuously

570
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:45,840
and cleaning it

571
00:23:42,159 --> 00:23:45,840
maybe a couple times a day

572
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:52,559
those that are familiar with sunflower

573
00:23:48,960 --> 00:23:55,919
know that the sunflower fires are

574
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:58,159
part of drying sunflower

575
00:23:55,919 --> 00:24:01,120
too many times though people think it's

576
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:04,159
related to the drying temperature

577
00:24:01,120 --> 00:24:06,880
again it's a housekeeping issue

578
00:24:04,159 --> 00:24:10,880
it's dependent on the

579
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:13,840
cleanliness of the dryer

580
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:14,559
and so maybe with sunflower we need to

581
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,960
be

582
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,679
cleaning that dryer

583
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:22,080
two and even three times a day

584
00:24:19,679 --> 00:24:22,880
we need to be monitoring it to make sure

585
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,360
that

586
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:26,480
that the flowers are continuing to flow

587
00:24:25,360 --> 00:24:30,559
through

588
00:24:26,480 --> 00:24:33,360
if a fire does start shut the fan off

589
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,320
use an extinguisher to

590
00:24:33,360 --> 00:24:37,360
attack where the the fire is

591
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:40,159
and then

592
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:43,200
empty the dryer to make sure that

593
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,240
any of the embers that might still be

594
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:47,120
glowing

595
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:47,919
uh are removed we got to keep in mind

596
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:51,520
that

597
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:52,320
sunflowers are an oil product and both

598
00:24:51,520 --> 00:24:55,600
with

599
00:24:52,320 --> 00:25:00,120
soybeans and particularly with sunflower

600
00:24:55,600 --> 00:25:00,120
we end up with an oil fire

601
00:25:00,159 --> 00:25:06,480
some again try to use natural air drying

602
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:07,600
i really discourage anything over 15

603
00:25:06,480 --> 00:25:09,440
percent

604
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,240
moisture

605
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:17,200
and again it works well in october as

606
00:25:12,240 --> 00:25:17,200
long as we have adequate airflow

607
00:25:17,360 --> 00:25:21,039
and this comes out of my

608
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:24,000
publication

609
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,320
natural air low temperature grain drying

610
00:25:24,000 --> 00:25:29,279
and you can see

611
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:33,840
different air flow rates and drying

612
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:36,480
times required to get it done in october

613
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:39,760
but as we look at november

614
00:25:36,480 --> 00:25:42,880
same kind of table as before

615
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:45,360
we shift into november and all of and

616
00:25:42,880 --> 00:25:48,880
our drying times become very

617
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:48,880
excessive and

618
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,360
we with sunflower

619
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:58,320
with just a little bit of heat we can

620
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:00,400
successfully dry in about a month

621
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
as long as we have

622
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,000
adequate air flow and so

623
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:07,279
a little more optimistic

624
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,520
conditions

625
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:10,520
for sunflower

626
00:26:12,080 --> 00:26:16,960
well getting it dry is just part of it

627
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,679
then we have to manage it

628
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:21,120
and the types of things that that we

629
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:24,159
need to do

630
00:26:21,120 --> 00:26:25,760
our monitor temperature moisture insects

631
00:26:24,159 --> 00:26:28,960
mold

632
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:30,960
i recommend at least every two weeks

633
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:34,480
except during

634
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,440
the extreme cold of winter

635
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:38,159
and

636
00:26:35,440 --> 00:26:39,200
manage means to direct with a degree of

637
00:26:38,159 --> 00:26:42,480
skill

638
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,240
so we need to have some expertise on how

639
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:46,000
to manage the bin

640
00:26:44,240 --> 00:26:47,279
we need to be

641
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:52,120
controlling

642
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,120
temperature moisture and insects

643
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,200
many years ago i put this visual

644
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,480
together to

645
00:26:57,200 --> 00:26:59,840
show

646
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:02,559
the

647
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:06,080
temperature bands for insects

648
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:08,080
the curved line is the

649
00:27:06,080 --> 00:27:09,360
average monthly temperature in north

650
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:12,240
dakota

651
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:13,679
we recommend aerating the grain whenever

652
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:16,880
it's uh

653
00:27:13,679 --> 00:27:18,320
10 to 15 degrees cooler outside

654
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:19,600
and then

655
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,120
we

656
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,520
end up

657
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:26,320
trying to keep it cool as we go through

658
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:28,960
the summary if somebody has questions

659
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:30,400
or wants some of these i still have some

660
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,840
of them on

661
00:27:30,400 --> 00:27:34,320
and

662
00:27:31,840 --> 00:27:36,000
lots of technology available to help us

663
00:27:34,320 --> 00:27:37,279
manage that grain

664
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,559
but it

665
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:41,039
is a tool

666
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:43,600
that we don't want to replace

667
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:46,400
going in and checking the grain

668
00:27:43,600 --> 00:27:49,279
there are lots of hazards associated

669
00:27:46,400 --> 00:27:51,760
with the grain

670
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,799
this is kind of a lead-in to angie's

671
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:55,520
portion

672
00:27:52,799 --> 00:27:59,120
the one that i will touch on a little

673
00:27:55,520 --> 00:27:59,120
bit on the moldy grain

674
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:04,559
for years i was telling people you need

675
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,159
a mask that has two

676
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:07,840
straps

677
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,559
as a way to really

678
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:12,480
indicate the n95 mask

679
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:16,240
one of the things with covid is

680
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:17,919
everybody knows now what an n95 mask is

681
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,640
but that's

682
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:23,919
excuse me that's what we need for

683
00:28:20,640 --> 00:28:26,399
for keeping those mold spores out of us

684
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:28,960
like everybody else just do a search for

685
00:28:26,399 --> 00:28:32,320
ndsu grain drying and storage

686
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:34,960
and you'll find my information

687
00:28:32,320 --> 00:28:37,039
and i think it's yours angie

688
00:28:34,960 --> 00:28:40,399
awesome thank you so much ken you had a

689
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,080
great uh great segue into

690
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,120
i mean our work goes hand in hand

691
00:28:42,080 --> 00:28:45,679
together

692
00:28:43,120 --> 00:28:47,279
in terms of

693
00:28:45,679 --> 00:28:49,760
the

694
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,279
the safety precautions that that we need

695
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:52,960
to consider when we're looking at

696
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,360
working

697
00:28:52,960 --> 00:28:57,760
around grain handling equipment and so

698
00:28:55,360 --> 00:29:00,080
for those of you on the call

699
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,279
my name is angie johnson as

700
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:05,279
sam shared i am the ndsu extension farm

701
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:07,360
and ranch safety coordinator i've been

702
00:29:05,279 --> 00:29:08,320
in this role for just about a year now

703
00:29:07,360 --> 00:29:09,360
and so

704
00:29:08,320 --> 00:29:12,240
um

705
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:15,200
i have one year under my belt but still

706
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:17,440
so many um so many more opportunities

707
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,039
and much more knowledge to gain and so

708
00:29:17,440 --> 00:29:21,440
it's been great to

709
00:29:19,039 --> 00:29:24,240
to work with ken and and learn a lot

710
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,880
more and understanding of of what farm

711
00:29:24,240 --> 00:29:29,120
safety positions look like across the

712
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:31,440
extension service system in in the

713
00:29:29,120 --> 00:29:33,520
united states and so it's been it's been

714
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:35,679
a really good opportunity and i thank

715
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,000
you all for your support and your time

716
00:29:35,679 --> 00:29:39,039
this morning to learn a little bit more

717
00:29:38,000 --> 00:29:40,480
um

718
00:29:39,039 --> 00:29:44,080
i'm going to go ahead and just get

719
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:45,679
started some of you may have

720
00:29:44,080 --> 00:29:48,799
seen bits and pieces of this

721
00:29:45,679 --> 00:29:49,919
presentation i've i've done a recording

722
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,799
or two

723
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,880
for you to have available during

724
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:57,440
pesticide training season

725
00:29:54,880 --> 00:30:00,399
as part of a component

726
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:02,080
within your training materials but also

727
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,840
for fumigation

728
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,679
working with andrew thostenson our

729
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:10,240
pesticide specialist here at ndsu and

730
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,399
focusing on on how we

731
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:14,480
work safely around grain bins when

732
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:15,840
applying a fumigate product

733
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,200
and so

734
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:20,799
any time

735
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:23,679
i i give a presentation or i work with

736
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:26,159
with staff it's really important to take

737
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:27,360
a just take a moment to step back

738
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,120
because

739
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:32,640
the topics that i get to talk about are

740
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:34,320
they're not easy

741
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:35,200
they're really hard conversations to

742
00:30:34,320 --> 00:30:37,440
have

743
00:30:35,200 --> 00:30:39,679
nobody likes to be told that they're

744
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:41,760
unsafe not that that's what i do at all

745
00:30:39,679 --> 00:30:43,520
right i that's that's not our goal we're

746
00:30:41,760 --> 00:30:45,440
not we're not enforcement we're

747
00:30:43,520 --> 00:30:48,159
prevention and education

748
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:49,919
but the reality is is taking safety

749
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:51,760
seriously

750
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,919
can be a challenge and it's not that

751
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,559
people don't want to be safe or aren't

752
00:30:53,919 --> 00:30:59,120
acting safe it's just we become so

753
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:02,000
comfortable with what we're doing that

754
00:30:59,120 --> 00:31:04,320
we take for granted the seriousness and

755
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:06,720
honestly the hazardous conditions that

756
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:09,840
we do work in and so it's really

757
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,080
important to just take a step back and

758
00:31:09,840 --> 00:31:15,200
for any of you out there

759
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:18,399
um i i can only imagine that that some

760
00:31:15,200 --> 00:31:20,240
of you have been touched in your life by

761
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:22,559
someone that's been involved in some

762
00:31:20,240 --> 00:31:26,000
type of farmer ranch-related incident

763
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:29,840
and so i always encourage growers or or

764
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,679
any any audience members out there that

765
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,919
need to take a step back because of this

766
00:31:31,679 --> 00:31:35,440
heavy subject to please feel comfortable

767
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:37,519
to do so

768
00:31:35,440 --> 00:31:40,640
because taking care of yourself is

769
00:31:37,519 --> 00:31:44,000
priority number one

770
00:31:40,640 --> 00:31:46,720
i like to start off with showing this

771
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:48,320
humorous little clip or meme whatever

772
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:50,960
you want to call it because i think it

773
00:31:48,320 --> 00:31:53,600
gets all of us to start thinking and

774
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:57,120
being realistic with ourselves that

775
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:58,240
for for those that i mean

776
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,640
you can just

777
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,960
go to the local elevator or during

778
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,679
harvest time you can see the long line

779
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:06,480
of semis uh that are at the elevator and

780
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,240
so

781
00:32:06,480 --> 00:32:10,480
um you know i don't always wait in line

782
00:32:08,240 --> 00:32:12,720
at the green elevator but man when i do

783
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:14,320
it makes me want to build one more bin

784
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,240
and and many of our growers have

785
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:18,640
experienced that and

786
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,799
um my point being is that the grain

787
00:32:18,640 --> 00:32:23,120
industry has

788
00:32:20,799 --> 00:32:26,000
has changed we're not just dealing with

789
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,120
5000 bushel bins anymore we're dealing

790
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:31,200
with you know commercial facilities that

791
00:32:29,120 --> 00:32:33,360
have over a million bushel storage

792
00:32:31,200 --> 00:32:35,600
capacity whether that's

793
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:37,600
not just grain bins but other confined

794
00:32:35,600 --> 00:32:39,360
spaces that they're using structured

795
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:41,120
domes and whatnot

796
00:32:39,360 --> 00:32:43,440
but our handling equipment you know

797
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:44,480
we're using semis semi trailers pup

798
00:32:43,440 --> 00:32:46,799
trailers

799
00:32:44,480 --> 00:32:49,440
um you know we can hold a

800
00:32:46,799 --> 00:32:52,720
a semi can hold a grain cart load or

801
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:55,519
more and versus the single axle trucks

802
00:32:52,720 --> 00:32:58,000
of of yesteryear and so just keeping in

803
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,480
mind about how the grain industry has

804
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,960
really has really changed and how

805
00:33:00,480 --> 00:33:05,440
farmers are handling their storage

806
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:07,600
and with that change comes comes

807
00:33:05,440 --> 00:33:08,720
problems right unintended

808
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,399
um

809
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:13,279
unintended

810
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,279
issues that

811
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,880
we need to address but but it's a

812
00:33:15,279 --> 00:33:19,200
challenge and so

813
00:33:16,880 --> 00:33:21,519
one of the the reality is

814
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:23,519
and why we're all here is to understand

815
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:25,760
a little bit more about the problems

816
00:33:23,519 --> 00:33:28,240
that that come with working in confined

817
00:33:25,760 --> 00:33:30,559
spaces such as grain bins and one of the

818
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:32,799
biggest questions that i get asked and

819
00:33:30,559 --> 00:33:33,840
asked often especially by the media is

820
00:33:32,799 --> 00:33:36,640
well

821
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:39,120
what what's our number one

822
00:33:36,640 --> 00:33:42,240
you know farm-related injury or or

823
00:33:39,120 --> 00:33:44,720
fatality and and the reality is folks is

824
00:33:42,240 --> 00:33:47,039
that it's it's not that simple there is

825
00:33:44,720 --> 00:33:48,399
no formal reporting

826
00:33:47,039 --> 00:33:50,559
um

827
00:33:48,399 --> 00:33:52,480
you do not have to report if if you have

828
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:55,279
a farm injury or incident on your

829
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:57,760
operation there's no federal mandate

830
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,120
that requires you to to report that

831
00:33:57,760 --> 00:34:00,000
injury

832
00:33:59,120 --> 00:34:02,320
and

833
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:04,720
what that means is that we don't have a

834
00:34:02,320 --> 00:34:06,559
great database or and we don't have a

835
00:34:04,720 --> 00:34:07,919
great understanding in terms of what

836
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,240
we're actually seeing out in the

837
00:34:07,919 --> 00:34:13,119
countryside commercial facilities

838
00:34:10,240 --> 00:34:16,079
absolutely 10 or more employees they

839
00:34:13,119 --> 00:34:17,520
have to follow osha regulations the

840
00:34:16,079 --> 00:34:20,480
occupational safety and health

841
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,599
administration so any time there's a a

842
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:25,280
near miss incident i mean it has to be

843
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:28,159
legally reported

844
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:31,040
and some of the best information that we

845
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:33,280
can get is is from purdue university dr

846
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,839
my colleague dr bill field

847
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:38,240
he has been

848
00:34:35,839 --> 00:34:41,359
working with a grant for for many many

849
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:43,839
years that really focuses on

850
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:46,079
trying to understand and get an idea in

851
00:34:43,839 --> 00:34:48,960
terms of what's going on with confined

852
00:34:46,079 --> 00:34:50,879
spaces out in the agricultural workspace

853
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:52,480
and

854
00:34:50,879 --> 00:34:55,599
they have been collecting this data

855
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:58,160
since 1962 and so it's a very very large

856
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,760
data set and i just i'm not going to go

857
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,440
through the details of these numbers

858
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,200
with you but i think it's important to

859
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:06,560
put into perspective

860
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:09,119
that grain storage facilities are are a

861
00:35:06,560 --> 00:35:11,040
big big problem when it comes to

862
00:35:09,119 --> 00:35:13,520
injuries and fatalities

863
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,640
um and and what his report does is it

864
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:18,560
looks at both commercial and on farms

865
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:21,520
and you might be wondering well

866
00:35:18,560 --> 00:35:22,960
angie you just told me that we can't you

867
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,960
know there is no

868
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:26,720
reporting system we can't monitor

869
00:35:24,960 --> 00:35:29,200
farm-related injuries

870
00:35:26,720 --> 00:35:31,200
and the reality is is

871
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:33,200
what our

872
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,079
industry isn't the right word but what

873
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:37,280
our

874
00:35:34,079 --> 00:35:40,320
what our team does is really look at

875
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:41,200
news releases media reports social media

876
00:35:40,320 --> 00:35:43,680
posts

877
00:35:41,200 --> 00:35:45,440
um there are a couple networks out there

878
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:46,720
that that is literally what they do is

879
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:48,800
they scour

880
00:35:46,720 --> 00:35:50,720
and keyword search

881
00:35:48,800 --> 00:35:53,520
different terms in order to kind of get

882
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:55,760
an idea of what accidents or excuse me

883
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,160
incidences are happening based on what

884
00:35:55,760 --> 00:36:00,400
the media is reporting and i think all

885
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,400
of us on this call realized that well

886
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:03,599
just because a farm injury doesn't make

887
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:04,880
the news

888
00:36:03,599 --> 00:36:06,560
um

889
00:36:04,880 --> 00:36:08,880
doesn't mean it's not serious because

890
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:10,720
not all farm-related incidences make the

891
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:11,680
news you know typically

892
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:12,960
if

893
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:15,680
if it's a

894
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,760
fall or if if there's survivors it may

895
00:36:15,680 --> 00:36:20,079
not even make the news it usually has to

896
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:22,480
be a very tragic scene in order to make

897
00:36:20,079 --> 00:36:25,040
local media and so just to kind of give

898
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:27,200
you some framework of the reality of

899
00:36:25,040 --> 00:36:29,599
what we're dealing with we're

900
00:36:27,200 --> 00:36:32,400
we have a really really good

901
00:36:29,599 --> 00:36:35,119
estimate and and some data but it's not

902
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:36,560
concrete and it's not solid

903
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:38,480
and i've been talking a lot about a

904
00:36:36,560 --> 00:36:40,560
confined space and and i don't want to

905
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:42,320
make the assumption that we all know

906
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:43,920
what a confined space is that's that's

907
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,760
not fair and because there's many

908
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,720
different types of confined spaces when

909
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:51,440
you get out into our our large feedlot

910
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:54,320
operations whether that's cattle or hogs

911
00:36:51,440 --> 00:36:56,560
or or whatever a find space working with

912
00:36:54,320 --> 00:36:58,560
livestock we've got manure pits as well

913
00:36:56,560 --> 00:37:01,200
and and they classify as the confined

914
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:02,079
space and so just setting this narrative

915
00:37:01,200 --> 00:37:04,000
that

916
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:05,920
when we're dealing with a confined space

917
00:37:04,000 --> 00:37:08,480
we're dealing with a space that's not

918
00:37:05,920 --> 00:37:11,119
designed as a regular workspace

919
00:37:08,480 --> 00:37:12,880
like a grain bin is not a shop you know

920
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:15,440
this isn't a place where you can go in

921
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:16,880
and grab your welder and or or get out

922
00:37:15,440 --> 00:37:18,960
of the rain i mean if this is not

923
00:37:16,880 --> 00:37:20,079
designed as that type of structure to be

924
00:37:18,960 --> 00:37:23,520
working in

925
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:25,359
um a confined space also is very limited

926
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,280
there's there's not a lot of exit or

927
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:28,320
entry points and as you'll notice in

928
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:30,960
this photo

929
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:33,359
they are small okay it's it's not meant

930
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:36,079
for quick access it's not meant for

931
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:37,920
quick escape it's it's very very small

932
00:37:36,079 --> 00:37:41,119
it's meant to serve the purpose of

933
00:37:37,920 --> 00:37:43,040
storage of storing grain

934
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:45,520
and then a confined space also really

935
00:37:43,040 --> 00:37:47,839
looks at the physical and toxic hazards

936
00:37:45,520 --> 00:37:50,640
right and so ken was talking a little

937
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,240
bit about molds earlier okay

938
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:55,520
we can also have fume issues

939
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:57,200
in terms of

940
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,440
when those molds are happening they

941
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:01,200
produce toxins that that get into the

942
00:37:59,440 --> 00:38:03,440
air and you breathe in

943
00:38:01,200 --> 00:38:05,760
and can cause some serious health issues

944
00:38:03,440 --> 00:38:07,200
later on and so just kind of giving you

945
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:08,800
a background of

946
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,280
you know what this is what we're dealing

947
00:38:08,800 --> 00:38:13,119
with in a confined space and for most of

948
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:17,119
us here in north dakota our confined

949
00:38:13,119 --> 00:38:19,359
space is is related to grain bins

950
00:38:17,119 --> 00:38:22,000
uh this is just going into the deep

951
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:24,560
nitty gritty to give you a even deeper

952
00:38:22,000 --> 00:38:26,800
view of of what a confined space is and

953
00:38:24,560 --> 00:38:28,880
and really looking at i just wanted to

954
00:38:26,800 --> 00:38:31,359
showcase this to get deeper into the

955
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:34,320
hazards because most producers don't

956
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:36,560
think about oxygen content when they're

957
00:38:34,320 --> 00:38:39,760
working with grain bins i mean oxygen

958
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:42,320
can be a huge limiting factor and a

959
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:45,040
problem right anytime we're dealing with

960
00:38:42,320 --> 00:38:47,520
with too low or too much we we've like

961
00:38:45,040 --> 00:38:50,720
ken talked about earlier with dryer

962
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:53,760
fires we can actually have green

963
00:38:50,720 --> 00:38:57,040
excessively heat up within a bin and get

964
00:38:53,760 --> 00:39:00,560
so hot that it'll it'll combust it can

965
00:38:57,040 --> 00:39:02,800
start on fire and so just looking at the

966
00:39:00,560 --> 00:39:05,520
different the different true dangers

967
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:07,200
that i think we take for granted um and

968
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,960
and don't always get an opportunity to

969
00:39:07,200 --> 00:39:10,800
shed a light on because we just work

970
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:14,000
with grain bins so much we're around

971
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:16,079
them so much that we don't realize you

972
00:39:14,000 --> 00:39:19,200
know in most cases we think of

973
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:21,440
engulfments but really um

974
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:24,160
some people can be overwhelmed with the

975
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:28,079
air quality once they make that choice

976
00:39:24,160 --> 00:39:30,320
to to enter a grain bin

977
00:39:28,079 --> 00:39:32,240
this is looking deeper into the weeds

978
00:39:30,320 --> 00:39:35,599
because i think it's really important as

979
00:39:32,240 --> 00:39:38,320
as agents i know i loved seeing

980
00:39:35,599 --> 00:39:40,000
um some numbers and i it really hit home

981
00:39:38,320 --> 00:39:41,680
to me when i could see a little bit more

982
00:39:40,000 --> 00:39:45,200
about north dakota you know where does

983
00:39:41,680 --> 00:39:48,000
my home rank and this is just looking at

984
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,440
confined spaces from that purdue report

985
00:39:48,000 --> 00:39:51,440
and if anyone's interested it's

986
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,400
available online or i can certainly send

987
00:39:51,440 --> 00:39:54,560
it to you

988
00:39:52,400 --> 00:39:57,200
but i always i like to showcase this

989
00:39:54,560 --> 00:39:59,359
2020 report and for some you're going to

990
00:39:57,200 --> 00:40:01,280
say angie that's so outdated but just

991
00:39:59,359 --> 00:40:03,119
hang on with me bear with me

992
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:06,560
so in 2020

993
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:08,880
there were 64 total cases of confined

994
00:40:06,560 --> 00:40:10,400
space incidences okay

995
00:40:08,880 --> 00:40:12,560
of those 64

996
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:14,720
confined space incidences

997
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:16,880
35 of them were grain entrapments

998
00:40:14,720 --> 00:40:19,200
because remember grain bins are not the

999
00:40:16,880 --> 00:40:21,040
only source or are not the only type of

1000
00:40:19,200 --> 00:40:23,839
confined space so there are a lot of

1001
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:25,839
other mostly manure handling facilities

1002
00:40:23,839 --> 00:40:29,119
our other confined space

1003
00:40:25,839 --> 00:40:31,599
but just kind of giving you an idea

1004
00:40:29,119 --> 00:40:33,359
of some of those detailed numbers

1005
00:40:31,599 --> 00:40:35,520
and i want to ask you

1006
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,040
where did north dakota rank

1007
00:40:35,520 --> 00:40:38,800
so when you look at this map you're

1008
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:40,560
going to see

1009
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:42,800
the map of united states of course but

1010
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:45,119
then you're going to see boxes within

1011
00:40:42,800 --> 00:40:47,280
each state you're going to see a gray

1012
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:50,320
box and that box is going to have a

1013
00:40:47,280 --> 00:40:52,720
number that lists the total number of

1014
00:40:50,320 --> 00:40:54,560
confined space incidences

1015
00:40:52,720 --> 00:40:57,119
that they have been able to report and

1016
00:40:54,560 --> 00:40:59,520
record since about

1017
00:40:57,119 --> 00:41:01,680
1962.

1018
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:03,920
that white box right next to that gray

1019
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:06,800
box is going to be the total number of

1020
00:41:03,920 --> 00:41:09,280
20 incidences that occurred in 2020

1021
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:11,599
within each of those states so when you

1022
00:41:09,280 --> 00:41:13,599
look at that white box you're actually

1023
00:41:11,599 --> 00:41:16,560
going to see that north dakota and

1024
00:41:13,599 --> 00:41:19,839
minnesota tied for second in the amount

1025
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:22,079
of confined space incidences in

1026
00:41:19,839 --> 00:41:23,920
okay keep that in the back of your mind

1027
00:41:22,079 --> 00:41:25,920
i promise i'll i'll dive into it a

1028
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:28,640
little deeper

1029
00:41:25,920 --> 00:41:30,319
and and this is a this is a serious deal

1030
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,079
and and that's why you're all here today

1031
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:33,760
to to learn a little bit more and i want

1032
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,160
to give you some confidence to be able

1033
00:41:33,760 --> 00:41:38,319
to talk about grain bin safety when

1034
00:41:36,160 --> 00:41:41,440
you're working with your clientele and

1035
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:44,640
so i get this really cool

1036
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:48,960
opportunity to work with the stanford

1037
00:41:44,640 --> 00:41:51,280
health trauma center here in fargo um

1038
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,280
many people don't know this but the

1039
00:41:51,280 --> 00:41:56,319
trauma center in fargo

1040
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,839
is the only level one trauma center

1041
00:41:56,319 --> 00:42:02,000
between minneapolis seattle denver and

1042
00:41:59,839 --> 00:42:04,640
omaha nebraska

1043
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:06,400
that's a that's a that scares me and and

1044
00:42:04,640 --> 00:42:09,200
it should scare all of us because the

1045
00:42:06,400 --> 00:42:11,280
reality is is if we

1046
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:14,319
need trauma-related care we need

1047
00:42:11,280 --> 00:42:16,160
critical uh our our individuals are in

1048
00:42:14,319 --> 00:42:18,960
critical care they need help now

1049
00:42:16,160 --> 00:42:20,960
emergency surgeries um these are the

1050
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:24,079
only level one hospitals that they're

1051
00:42:20,960 --> 00:42:26,400
that are able to handle that and so i've

1052
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:30,400
gotten the opportunity to look at

1053
00:42:26,400 --> 00:42:32,960
agricultural related farm incidences

1054
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:36,520
from some of the data from stanford and

1055
00:42:32,960 --> 00:42:39,119
between 2010 and 2020 there have been

1056
00:42:36,520 --> 00:42:42,800
292 farm injuries

1057
00:42:39,119 --> 00:42:44,800
okay and of those 17 of them were

1058
00:42:42,800 --> 00:42:45,680
related to grain bins

1059
00:42:44,800 --> 00:42:48,720
okay

1060
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,960
and 10 of those occurred between 2019

1061
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,839
and 2020 alone

1062
00:42:50,960 --> 00:42:56,960
that just for for me in in this field

1063
00:42:53,839 --> 00:42:58,960
that blows my mind and is is a jaw

1064
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:01,680
dropper for me and

1065
00:42:58,960 --> 00:43:03,040
the reason why i keep bringing up 2020

1066
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,480
and showing that

1067
00:43:03,040 --> 00:43:07,359
is how many of you remember that harvest

1068
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,160
okay

1069
00:43:07,359 --> 00:43:12,319
if you go back and look at end on data

1070
00:43:10,160 --> 00:43:13,920
that was an or if you have good

1071
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:16,800
long-term memory

1072
00:43:13,920 --> 00:43:19,040
that was a really really really wet fall

1073
00:43:16,800 --> 00:43:20,160
and that caused a lot of harvest

1074
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:22,960
challenges

1075
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:25,200
and this is why ken went first in the

1076
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:26,960
presentation because

1077
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:29,599
we want to talk about if we want to

1078
00:43:26,960 --> 00:43:32,400
prevent grain bin related incidences and

1079
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:34,720
fatalities it starts with the condition

1080
00:43:32,400 --> 00:43:37,359
of the grain going into the bin for

1081
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:40,960
storage and so during that harvest

1082
00:43:37,359 --> 00:43:42,480
period with that excess um

1083
00:43:40,960 --> 00:43:44,640
plant moisture

1084
00:43:42,480 --> 00:43:46,240
within those within the kernels of

1085
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,560
whatever crop it didn't matter whether

1086
00:43:46,240 --> 00:43:51,119
it was corn or whatnot

1087
00:43:48,560 --> 00:43:54,319
it caused some serious storage issues

1088
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:56,400
moving forward and so hence when we had

1089
00:43:54,319 --> 00:43:59,599
storage problems

1090
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:01,359
there was more need to end up going into

1091
00:43:59,599 --> 00:44:02,160
the bin

1092
00:44:01,359 --> 00:44:04,880
and

1093
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,640
digging deeper into that data

1094
00:44:04,880 --> 00:44:08,240
something that i think gets taken for

1095
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:10,319
granted and i've talked to ken a little

1096
00:44:08,240 --> 00:44:13,599
bit about this and we featured this

1097
00:44:10,319 --> 00:44:15,119
topic at big iron is talking about slips

1098
00:44:13,599 --> 00:44:17,920
trips and falls

1099
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:20,640
and so a lot of times media reports only

1100
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:22,640
look at or talk about grain engulfments

1101
00:44:20,640 --> 00:44:26,720
that's what makes the news and and

1102
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:29,119
rightfully so it's a tragic tragic event

1103
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:31,440
and extremely serious

1104
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:34,079
but but we take for granted slip trip

1105
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:36,319
slips trips and falls are just as

1106
00:44:34,079 --> 00:44:38,000
serious you know we're talking about

1107
00:44:36,319 --> 00:44:39,440
platforms that

1108
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:42,000
are

1109
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:45,119
my goodness

1110
00:44:42,000 --> 00:44:48,319
20 plus feet you know over and so

1111
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,319
it's it's very very serious and and can

1112
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:52,160
have life-altering effects and also

1113
00:44:50,319 --> 00:44:55,359
cause fatalities

1114
00:44:52,160 --> 00:44:58,160
and so of that data from our our staff

1115
00:44:55,359 --> 00:44:59,200
samford trauma center 13 of those were

1116
00:44:58,160 --> 00:45:02,480
related

1117
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:05,119
uh 13 of those injuries were related

1118
00:45:02,480 --> 00:45:07,200
from falls either falling from the bin

1119
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:09,839
into the bin or

1120
00:45:07,200 --> 00:45:11,040
falling inside the bin and this is just

1121
00:45:09,839 --> 00:45:12,400
i'm not going to go through all these

1122
00:45:11,040 --> 00:45:14,960
numbers but just to give you the

1123
00:45:12,400 --> 00:45:16,720
severity of what happened and i think

1124
00:45:14,960 --> 00:45:19,280
it's really important to note that this

1125
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,880
data i don't want to say it's limited

1126
00:45:19,280 --> 00:45:23,280
but you'll probably notice there's a

1127
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:26,000
piece missing is that this does not talk

1128
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,960
about fatalities our stanford data only

1129
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:31,359
really looks at those that made it to

1130
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:33,280
the hospital and were able to survive so

1131
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:34,319
this does not include those that didn't

1132
00:45:33,280 --> 00:45:36,160
make it

1133
00:45:34,319 --> 00:45:39,440
and again just giving you some more

1134
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,520
demographics that it's not just one age

1135
00:45:39,440 --> 00:45:44,240
that's targeted we had

1136
00:45:41,520 --> 00:45:46,800
any individuals from 18 all the way to

1137
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:49,599
81 years of age and so

1138
00:45:46,800 --> 00:45:52,319
um it's you're not people are not immune

1139
00:45:49,599 --> 00:45:55,119
to it age age doesn't matter it's it's

1140
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:56,880
impacting the all of the producers as an

1141
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:58,800
industry

1142
00:45:56,880 --> 00:46:00,880
and so now that i've got you thinking a

1143
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:02,480
little bit about slips trips and falls

1144
00:46:00,880 --> 00:46:04,480
because it is something that we don't

1145
00:46:02,480 --> 00:46:06,160
hear in the news we we don't hear of

1146
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,280
those reports often but they're

1147
00:46:06,160 --> 00:46:09,520
happening

1148
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:13,599
more and more than we realize

1149
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,560
um what can we do to prevent that and um

1150
00:46:13,599 --> 00:46:16,640
one of

1151
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,960
one of my favorite ways to do this and

1152
00:46:16,640 --> 00:46:21,280
and ken and i can go back and forth on

1153
00:46:18,960 --> 00:46:23,920
this i'm okay with that but utilizing

1154
00:46:21,280 --> 00:46:26,800
ground opening lids uh being able to

1155
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:30,160
open that bin directly from the ground

1156
00:46:26,800 --> 00:46:32,720
is is huge i've got a hopper bin system

1157
00:46:30,160 --> 00:46:35,119
that this is this is the platform that i

1158
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:37,119
have installed on all of them because

1159
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,599
i do not feel comfortable climbing that

1160
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,880
high nor should i expect my

1161
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,880
father

1162
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:45,280
to have to take on that endeavor if i

1163
00:46:42,880 --> 00:46:46,880
don't want to do it and so using ground

1164
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,800
opening lids

1165
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:51,119
has been a huge

1166
00:46:48,800 --> 00:46:53,520
has been a lifesaver literally for for

1167
00:46:51,119 --> 00:46:55,760
us in our operation do they solve

1168
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:57,760
everything absolutely not because as ken

1169
00:46:55,760 --> 00:47:00,560
mentioned earlier you still have to

1170
00:46:57,760 --> 00:47:03,680
manage you still really need to be

1171
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:05,599
able to take a peek inside those bins um

1172
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:07,599
but this gives you an opportunity that

1173
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,079
when you're climbing the bins the lid is

1174
00:47:07,599 --> 00:47:12,240
already open you don't have to try and

1175
00:47:10,079 --> 00:47:16,079
hang on to your fixed ladder and also

1176
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:18,400
open that bin hatch at the same time

1177
00:47:16,079 --> 00:47:20,160
this is the piece of safety equipment

1178
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:22,079
that we featured at big iron i

1179
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:24,880
absolutely love it love it love it

1180
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:25,760
because it it it helps growers

1181
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,160
um

1182
00:47:25,760 --> 00:47:30,560
actually have a safety mechanism in

1183
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:33,760
place to be able to climb a fixed ladder

1184
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:35,920
system so a fixed ladder is just like i

1185
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:38,960
just like it's now uh pronounced is that

1186
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:41,359
this ladder is bolted it is fixed onto

1187
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:44,079
the side of that green bin and this

1188
00:47:41,359 --> 00:47:47,280
allows a cable and pulley system to be

1189
00:47:44,079 --> 00:47:49,440
attached to a class 3 harness and and

1190
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:51,359
lifeline a fall protection so you're

1191
00:47:49,440 --> 00:47:54,160
able to climb that bin

1192
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:56,240
and for some reason if it's

1193
00:47:54,160 --> 00:47:58,480
if not that you should be climbing a bin

1194
00:47:56,240 --> 00:48:00,560
on a frosty morning but we all know

1195
00:47:58,480 --> 00:48:03,520
frosty mornings they can have that frost

1196
00:48:00,560 --> 00:48:06,400
layer on steps which is extremely

1197
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:09,520
slippery and so if you're make make that

1198
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:11,440
choice to climb and you slip and fall

1199
00:48:09,520 --> 00:48:13,680
you are only going to fall as far as

1200
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:15,839
that fall protection will

1201
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,400
the length of that fall protection so

1202
00:48:15,839 --> 00:48:19,760
this is a really really cool

1203
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:22,319
um

1204
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:26,079
design that that folks can have

1205
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:28,079
installed on their bins in order to

1206
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:32,240
actually have some safety protection in

1207
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,240
place when when making those bin climbs

1208
00:48:32,559 --> 00:48:37,440
stairs i get a lot of conversation about

1209
00:48:35,200 --> 00:48:39,599
stairs which i think are fantastic but

1210
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:42,400
the problem is is that stairs do not

1211
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:43,920
come equipped on all grain bins okay

1212
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,880
usually they are

1213
00:48:43,920 --> 00:48:49,040
um an additional add-on purchase and we

1214
00:48:46,880 --> 00:48:50,960
all know with inflation and and the

1215
00:48:49,040 --> 00:48:53,119
lovely situation our world is in right

1216
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:56,640
now that

1217
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:58,880
especially any any metal iron you know

1218
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:01,680
in this case uh what we're dealing with

1219
00:48:58,880 --> 00:49:04,079
with bins it's gonna cost more and so

1220
00:49:01,680 --> 00:49:05,839
that will be a deterrent for people to

1221
00:49:04,079 --> 00:49:08,319
install stairs is just because of the

1222
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,960
sheer cost to add it on

1223
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,200
and you'll also notice uh in in the

1224
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:15,680
photo on the right

1225
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:17,680
so the stair takes us up to to the roof

1226
00:49:15,680 --> 00:49:20,400
of the grain bin but how do we get to

1227
00:49:17,680 --> 00:49:22,400
the top okay you still have to climb a

1228
00:49:20,400 --> 00:49:24,800
fixed ladder to get to the very tippy

1229
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:26,079
top and so that's again where you could

1230
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:28,640
have a

1231
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:31,520
a ground opening lid installed at that

1232
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,680
point so you're able to open up that lid

1233
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:36,319
um right at the the top of that

1234
00:49:33,680 --> 00:49:38,480
staircase there and you could also have

1235
00:49:36,319 --> 00:49:41,520
some fixed ladder fall protection

1236
00:49:38,480 --> 00:49:43,440
installed as well again the down play is

1237
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:44,400
everything costs money but at the end of

1238
00:49:43,440 --> 00:49:46,559
the day

1239
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,400
putting a price on on your safety in

1240
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:50,720
your life it shouldn't even be a

1241
00:49:48,400 --> 00:49:54,800
question but i realize

1242
00:49:50,720 --> 00:49:56,559
um it it it gets it gets expensive

1243
00:49:54,800 --> 00:49:58,079
the other piece that we featured at big

1244
00:49:56,559 --> 00:50:00,079
iron and this is something that i would

1245
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:02,480
like to work with with agents more

1246
00:50:00,079 --> 00:50:05,520
because i think it's a very very

1247
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:07,920
simple but such an effective program is

1248
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,760
utilizing lockout tag out

1249
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:12,960
lockout takeout

1250
00:50:09,760 --> 00:50:15,599
is it does not have to be complex so

1251
00:50:12,960 --> 00:50:18,240
basically um i know i've got a really

1252
00:50:15,599 --> 00:50:21,040
busy photo on on the left side so so

1253
00:50:18,240 --> 00:50:23,599
just bear with it but the goal is is

1254
00:50:21,040 --> 00:50:25,920
to really shut down all of your power

1255
00:50:23,599 --> 00:50:29,280
sources before you start doing any

1256
00:50:25,920 --> 00:50:32,000
maintenance or or working on your grain

1257
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:34,319
handling system like ken mentioned a lot

1258
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:36,640
of there's tons of dryer options out

1259
00:50:34,319 --> 00:50:40,559
there and there's also so many different

1260
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:42,800
auger system grain legs sumps bin sweeps

1261
00:50:40,559 --> 00:50:45,119
a lot of them are mostly powered by

1262
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:47,520
electrical controls and so

1263
00:50:45,119 --> 00:50:49,520
taking the time to

1264
00:50:47,520 --> 00:50:51,760
completely shut it down get to that

1265
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:54,800
breaker box power it down

1266
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:56,000
use that lockout clasp in the middle of

1267
00:50:54,800 --> 00:50:58,640
your screen

1268
00:50:56,000 --> 00:50:59,520
to to go through the loop of the breaker

1269
00:50:58,640 --> 00:51:02,480
box

1270
00:50:59,520 --> 00:51:05,520
uh on and off switch and then actually

1271
00:51:02,480 --> 00:51:07,359
taking a lock a physical lock or a

1272
00:51:05,520 --> 00:51:09,440
physical little tag

1273
00:51:07,359 --> 00:51:11,200
that has you can write your name on it

1274
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,040
your employee's name on it whatever it

1275
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:15,839
is and

1276
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,880
and lock it or zip tie it in that clasp

1277
00:51:15,839 --> 00:51:21,200
and what that locker or tag represents

1278
00:51:18,880 --> 00:51:23,520
is you it represents you as an

1279
00:51:21,200 --> 00:51:27,520
individual that has taken the time to

1280
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:30,400
power down that equipment and nobody can

1281
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:32,960
unlock that lock except you when you are

1282
00:51:30,400 --> 00:51:35,280
ready to turn on and re-power that

1283
00:51:32,960 --> 00:51:37,440
equipment so it's to help prevent

1284
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,280
someone from unintentionally coming over

1285
00:51:37,440 --> 00:51:41,920
and say geez no wonder why this doesn't

1286
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:43,920
work it's off and then somebody turning

1287
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,800
it on while the other person is working

1288
00:51:43,920 --> 00:51:47,040
on it

1289
00:51:44,800 --> 00:51:49,280
and um

1290
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:51,520
it's something that what i like talking

1291
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:52,319
about lockout tag out because it's not

1292
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:54,800
just

1293
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:57,920
a farmer ranch related piece this can be

1294
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:59,920
used for for homeowners in in houses and

1295
00:51:57,920 --> 00:52:01,359
and especially with young children

1296
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:04,240
around not that they should be around

1297
00:52:01,359 --> 00:52:07,040
breaker boxes to begin with but you just

1298
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:09,520
you just never know where where kids and

1299
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:11,440
children can find themselves and so

1300
00:52:09,520 --> 00:52:14,319
lockout tag out i think is a really

1301
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:17,119
really good tool that we can do a better

1302
00:52:14,319 --> 00:52:19,280
job helping producers be able to use

1303
00:52:17,119 --> 00:52:21,119
that tool

1304
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:23,839
and this is just an example when i was

1305
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:26,640
in the county i had a producer that they

1306
00:52:23,839 --> 00:52:29,280
utilized lockout tag out when it came to

1307
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:30,640
maintenance of their equipment so that

1308
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:32,559
tractor

1309
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,720
you'll notice there's the the

1310
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:36,400
the tag that is attached to the door

1311
00:52:34,720 --> 00:52:39,119
handle of the tractor

1312
00:52:36,400 --> 00:52:41,200
that tag cannot be removed by any other

1313
00:52:39,119 --> 00:52:43,119
person than than

1314
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:45,520
who's listed on that board and in this

1315
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:48,319
example would be trevor or scott they

1316
00:52:45,520 --> 00:52:50,400
have drain there's no hydraulic oil

1317
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,559
because they're fixing the axle seal and

1318
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:54,319
so if someone were to didn't know that

1319
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,760
and where to hop into that tractor and

1320
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,160
start it you're going to have some

1321
00:52:55,760 --> 00:53:00,960
serious mechanical issues moving forward

1322
00:52:58,160 --> 00:53:02,720
and so they practice the lockout tag out

1323
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,720
system

1324
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,960
to protect their equipment so somebody

1325
00:53:04,720 --> 00:53:09,440
doesn't unintentionally go in

1326
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:10,400
and operate that machine and so if

1327
00:53:09,440 --> 00:53:12,000
you're if

1328
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,720
i think about it this way if you're not

1329
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:17,920
going to do it to protect yourself start

1330
00:53:14,720 --> 00:53:19,599
out by thinking about that equipment and

1331
00:53:17,920 --> 00:53:21,520
and keeping that safe i think it's a

1332
00:53:19,599 --> 00:53:24,720
really good way to

1333
00:53:21,520 --> 00:53:27,280
to ease into it and to you to see and

1334
00:53:24,720 --> 00:53:29,680
showcase the benefits of using it even

1335
00:53:27,280 --> 00:53:31,680
if you're working by yourself

1336
00:53:29,680 --> 00:53:33,760
we always don't remember to pull the

1337
00:53:31,680 --> 00:53:35,760
keys if we've changed the oil but if i

1338
00:53:33,760 --> 00:53:38,079
take time to tag out and put a tag on

1339
00:53:35,760 --> 00:53:40,319
that cab i'm going to remember instantly

1340
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:42,559
when i see it that yep that's right i

1341
00:53:40,319 --> 00:53:45,359
can't drive this i need to i haven't put

1342
00:53:42,559 --> 00:53:45,359
oil back in

1343
00:53:46,480 --> 00:53:52,880
shifting gears a little bit um and just

1344
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:54,720
being cognizant of time here

1345
00:53:52,880 --> 00:53:58,400
i always

1346
00:53:54,720 --> 00:54:00,319
this role has been interesting because

1347
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,960
i've always said this and i will stand

1348
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:06,640
firmly behind it in the fact that my job

1349
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:09,200
is not regulatory like i am not here to

1350
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:10,400
hammer down rules on you to tell you

1351
00:54:09,200 --> 00:54:11,359
what to do

1352
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:13,520
um

1353
00:54:11,359 --> 00:54:15,599
and and so people get really really

1354
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:17,359
really really anxious and i can see the

1355
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,200
hair stand up on the back of their neck

1356
00:54:17,359 --> 00:54:21,440
when i say the word permit

1357
00:54:19,200 --> 00:54:23,280
and the only reason i i bring this up

1358
00:54:21,440 --> 00:54:25,280
because

1359
00:54:23,280 --> 00:54:27,760
i feel that and i might not explain

1360
00:54:25,280 --> 00:54:29,359
myself in the best way so bear with me

1361
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:32,559
but i feel that

1362
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:34,880
there are already amazing

1363
00:54:32,559 --> 00:54:36,960
tips tricks fact sheets whatever you

1364
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:40,319
want to call it there's you call it

1365
00:54:36,960 --> 00:54:43,920
regulations there's these amazing

1366
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:45,760
resources out there that really outline

1367
00:54:43,920 --> 00:54:47,359
the hazards that are

1368
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,839
that are present when working with grain

1369
00:54:47,359 --> 00:54:52,400
bins so how can we help producers

1370
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:53,839
utilize the checklists the fact sheets

1371
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:55,440
that are already there and i'm not

1372
00:54:53,839 --> 00:54:58,880
saying physical paper that's not my

1373
00:54:55,440 --> 00:55:01,440
point but just being able to go through

1374
00:54:58,880 --> 00:55:03,440
and realize like oh my gosh

1375
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:05,680
these are things that i never ever

1376
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:07,440
thought of because how many how many

1377
00:55:05,680 --> 00:55:09,599
people are ever taught

1378
00:55:07,440 --> 00:55:11,599
on grain bin management you know you go

1379
00:55:09,599 --> 00:55:13,359
to your grain bin manufacturer they come

1380
00:55:11,599 --> 00:55:15,599
and install it and then it's your job to

1381
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:17,760
put grain in into it you know there's

1382
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:20,480
there's there's no training so you you

1383
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:22,559
learn by doing i mean a lot of people

1384
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:24,559
they've they've worked with ken and

1385
00:55:22,559 --> 00:55:26,640
really setting up their system and and

1386
00:55:24,559 --> 00:55:29,119
so nobody's ever been taught and i think

1387
00:55:26,640 --> 00:55:31,040
just bringing awareness to those hazards

1388
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:34,800
and talking about them so then we can

1389
00:55:31,040 --> 00:55:36,400
help people mitigate that risk and so

1390
00:55:34,800 --> 00:55:37,200
you know having that mindset you know

1391
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:39,760
what

1392
00:55:37,200 --> 00:55:42,720
i'm not gonna make a green bin entry

1393
00:55:39,760 --> 00:55:44,640
decision without really going through my

1394
00:55:42,720 --> 00:55:46,800
my checklist now that i know what these

1395
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:49,680
hazards are have i locked out all the

1396
00:55:46,800 --> 00:55:52,000
energy sources do i know what's going on

1397
00:55:49,680 --> 00:55:53,839
with the air quality in the bin

1398
00:55:52,000 --> 00:55:55,680
do i have a safety harness and a

1399
00:55:53,839 --> 00:55:56,960
lifeline and i've put an asterisk by

1400
00:55:55,680 --> 00:55:59,040
that because

1401
00:55:56,960 --> 00:56:01,200
there's there's two it's two separate

1402
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:03,839
issues having a safety harness versus

1403
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:05,680
knowing how to use it are two completely

1404
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:07,440
different issues

1405
00:56:05,680 --> 00:56:09,599
and and i could have a conversation on

1406
00:56:07,440 --> 00:56:11,520
that all day

1407
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:13,200
but the other thing is is you know what

1408
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,480
type of lighting do we have because

1409
00:56:13,200 --> 00:56:16,480
remember

1410
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,440
i hope this is familiar but these are

1411
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:18,640
all

1412
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:20,160
signs

1413
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,319
pointing to we're dealing with a

1414
00:56:20,160 --> 00:56:23,680
confined space okay

1415
00:56:22,319 --> 00:56:26,079
um and

1416
00:56:23,680 --> 00:56:27,119
uh the part at the bottom talking about

1417
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:29,040
having

1418
00:56:27,119 --> 00:56:30,799
basically having that what i call a

1419
00:56:29,040 --> 00:56:32,960
buddy system

1420
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:34,720
and guys will think well jeepers i have

1421
00:56:32,960 --> 00:56:36,880
i have a buddy with me

1422
00:56:34,720 --> 00:56:38,720
they'll be able to pull me out

1423
00:56:36,880 --> 00:56:40,640
and for all of you out there on zoom

1424
00:56:38,720 --> 00:56:42,160
land the reality is and and this is

1425
00:56:40,640 --> 00:56:44,559
gonna sound harsh

1426
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:46,960
but the reality is is that buddy is not

1427
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:50,400
there to pull you out that buddy is

1428
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,480
there to call 9-1-1 and and because

1429
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:53,680
you will not be able to react fast

1430
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:55,599
enough to

1431
00:56:53,680 --> 00:56:58,799
to grab a hold of somebody that's

1432
00:56:55,599 --> 00:57:01,520
becoming engulfed in green um and what

1433
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:04,079
ends up happening is that second person

1434
00:57:01,520 --> 00:57:06,000
try ends up becoming the victim as well

1435
00:57:04,079 --> 00:57:08,880
because they try and go in and and

1436
00:57:06,000 --> 00:57:10,240
rescue that first person and so as cruel

1437
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,160
as it sounds

1438
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,920
that buddy system you need to have it

1439
00:57:12,160 --> 00:57:15,520
but the reality is is they're there

1440
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,119
because they need to be ready to call

1441
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:18,000
9-1-1

1442
00:57:17,119 --> 00:57:19,920
if

1443
00:57:18,000 --> 00:57:23,280
i shouldn't say if it happens it's it's

1444
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:23,280
when it happens okay

1445
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:28,559
um and going back just just talking

1446
00:57:26,640 --> 00:57:30,960
about grain bin entry this is just

1447
00:57:28,559 --> 00:57:33,359
specifically looking at entrapments now

1448
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:36,720
earlier we looked at all total confined

1449
00:57:33,359 --> 00:57:38,720
spaces this map is is again from my

1450
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:41,359
colleagues at purdue university really

1451
00:57:38,720 --> 00:57:43,760
looking at the number of entrapments in

1452
00:57:41,359 --> 00:57:45,839
2022 and again

1453
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:48,160
north dakota ranked second

1454
00:57:45,839 --> 00:57:50,480
and really contributing to that that

1455
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:54,160
high moisture crop that was going into

1456
00:57:50,480 --> 00:57:57,200
the bin um during that really awful wet

1457
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,119
wet fall um and again not going to do

1458
00:57:57,200 --> 00:58:02,720
detail but just showing you some some

1459
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:02,720
different demographics of that

1460
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:07,920
a lot of times i'll get questions all

1461
00:58:05,280 --> 00:58:09,599
right angie like it's just corn right i

1462
00:58:07,920 --> 00:58:12,640
mean i don't have to worry about it i

1463
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,559
raise you know i raise flax or whatever

1464
00:58:12,640 --> 00:58:16,559
it's not my problem right

1465
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:19,440
and let's be real here

1466
00:58:16,559 --> 00:58:21,040
grain entrapments can happen with any of

1467
00:58:19,440 --> 00:58:23,119
the crops that we're dealing with

1468
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,720
whether it's corn soybeans i mean any

1469
00:58:23,119 --> 00:58:26,799
any of the crops that you see on your

1470
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:29,680
screen it can happen

1471
00:58:26,799 --> 00:58:32,480
and the truth is of of the documented

1472
00:58:29,680 --> 00:58:33,920
cases that we have remember documented

1473
00:58:32,480 --> 00:58:36,640
there's a lot of cases out there it's

1474
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:40,319
estimated about 30 percent of of

1475
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:42,400
farm-related cases are not reported

1476
00:58:40,319 --> 00:58:44,799
over 50 percent of those documented

1477
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:47,280
cases have involved corn and that's

1478
00:58:44,799 --> 00:58:49,200
because it's been out of condition as as

1479
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:51,440
ken had talked a little bit about

1480
00:58:49,200 --> 00:58:53,440
earlier those those pieces that lead to

1481
00:58:51,440 --> 00:58:55,040
that so i think it's really important

1482
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:56,160
when you're working with your growers

1483
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,920
that

1484
00:58:56,160 --> 00:58:59,280
sometimes it's

1485
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:01,680
it's i don't want to use the word

1486
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:03,680
oblivious but just realizing like it

1487
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:04,799
happens more than

1488
00:59:03,680 --> 00:59:06,799
than

1489
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:09,680
than just a cor people that are storing

1490
00:59:06,799 --> 00:59:09,680
corn and bins

1491
00:59:10,000 --> 00:59:13,440
these are the different types of

1492
00:59:11,359 --> 00:59:15,520
entrapments again this could be a whole

1493
00:59:13,440 --> 00:59:17,760
powerpoint on itself so i don't want to

1494
00:59:15,520 --> 00:59:19,359
get caught into the weeds of this some

1495
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:21,440
of you have

1496
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:23,200
have heard me talk about these before

1497
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,200
and if for those of you that would like

1498
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,799
to learn more i'd love to sit down with

1499
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:28,319
you and we can talk through these but

1500
00:59:26,799 --> 00:59:32,000
just wanted to go through some of these

1501
00:59:28,319 --> 00:59:34,640
pieces and i added to this list storage

1502
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:36,400
bags um i know a few years ago in kitter

1503
00:59:34,640 --> 00:59:39,760
county i believe as ketter county there

1504
00:59:36,400 --> 00:59:41,920
was a very very uh dangerous

1505
00:59:39,760 --> 00:59:44,559
incident that happened with the the

1506
00:59:41,920 --> 00:59:47,599
suction power of that that poly grain

1507
00:59:44,559 --> 00:59:49,680
bag those storage bags and so

1508
00:59:47,599 --> 00:59:53,359
ken mentioned them earlier as well but

1509
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:55,280
but they are definitely a risk for

1510
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:58,079
some entrapment situations that can

1511
00:59:55,280 --> 01:00:00,400
occur as well

1512
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:02,720
this is just briefly going through

1513
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:05,119
you know looking at a flowing grain

1514
01:00:02,720 --> 01:00:07,440
scenario and i hope when all of you see

1515
01:00:05,119 --> 01:00:10,240
that picture i hope deep down inside you

1516
01:00:07,440 --> 01:00:13,119
got really or a little bit angry because

1517
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:15,359
that person is making a horrible

1518
01:00:13,119 --> 01:00:16,799
horrible horrible decision in in doing

1519
01:00:15,359 --> 01:00:19,200
what he's doing there's no fall

1520
01:00:16,799 --> 01:00:21,920
protection you can see clearly see the

1521
01:00:19,200 --> 01:00:25,200
funnel cone shape of grain that's going

1522
01:00:21,920 --> 01:00:27,520
down and um and and and that grain is

1523
01:00:25,200 --> 01:00:28,400
horrible i mean you it is in sheets and

1524
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:30,880
so

1525
01:00:28,400 --> 01:00:33,040
um any of the

1526
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:35,040
any different collapses or there could

1527
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:37,200
still be some open

1528
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:39,920
hollows or caverns underneath because of

1529
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:42,960
that crusting we just have a serious

1530
01:00:39,920 --> 01:00:46,240
itch situation on our hands and so with

1531
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:48,880
flowing grain i talk a lot about how

1532
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:51,760
the there's a suction action right and

1533
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:54,240
and that ac that suction is so strong

1534
01:00:51,760 --> 01:00:56,160
that you physically cannot swim out of

1535
01:00:54,240 --> 01:00:58,799
it you know swim your way out of it to

1536
01:00:56,160 --> 01:01:01,119
try and pull yourself up um and you

1537
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,880
can't you can't walk or climb yourself

1538
01:01:01,119 --> 01:01:05,599
out

1539
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:07,920
and these are just some clips from

1540
01:01:05,599 --> 01:01:10,079
from ken's publication on don't get

1541
01:01:07,920 --> 01:01:12,000
caught in the green just showcasing the

1542
01:01:10,079 --> 01:01:14,720
reality of how many seconds it can take

1543
01:01:12,000 --> 01:01:18,079
to become engulfed and fully buried and

1544
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:20,880
so that deals a lot with um

1545
01:01:18,079 --> 01:01:23,760
the the grain demo that we got to make

1546
01:01:20,880 --> 01:01:25,359
at fall conference last year and so if

1547
01:01:23,760 --> 01:01:27,119
agents are on this call that are

1548
01:01:25,359 --> 01:01:29,280
interested in learning more about making

1549
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:30,960
your own demo talk to me i've got some

1550
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:33,920
supplies left over

1551
01:01:30,960 --> 01:01:36,559
and this is just looking at um

1552
01:01:33,920 --> 01:01:38,960
the the sheer amount of force you know

1553
01:01:36,559 --> 01:01:42,160
gravity takes hold in those engulfment

1554
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:44,160
situations and so when you're buried at

1555
01:01:42,160 --> 01:01:46,559
certain levels at certain depths within

1556
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,960
the grain this is showcasing how many

1557
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,839
pounds of force it would take to be able

1558
01:01:48,960 --> 01:01:55,200
to pull that person out and and i know

1559
01:01:51,839 --> 01:01:58,640
how strong sam markell is but there's no

1560
01:01:55,200 --> 01:02:02,079
way sam would even be able to pull um a

1561
01:01:58,640 --> 01:02:03,839
person you know using over 1500 pounds

1562
01:02:02,079 --> 01:02:06,079
of force if they're buried that deep

1563
01:02:03,839 --> 01:02:08,480
into the grain so just kind of a really

1564
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,480
good picture to help

1565
01:02:08,480 --> 01:02:12,319
reiterate the fact that that second

1566
01:02:10,480 --> 01:02:14,480
person that's on scene

1567
01:02:12,319 --> 01:02:16,960
can become a victim really quickly if

1568
01:02:14,480 --> 01:02:18,720
they try and and pull that other person

1569
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,640
out

1570
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:23,200
this is just looking at bridge grain

1571
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,760
where we have that crusting on the top

1572
01:02:23,200 --> 01:02:28,079
and and that hollow center and we try

1573
01:02:25,760 --> 01:02:30,880
and break that crust and once it breaks

1574
01:02:28,079 --> 01:02:32,960
we can easily become entrapped into the

1575
01:02:30,880 --> 01:02:34,960
remaining flowing grain that's taking

1576
01:02:32,960 --> 01:02:37,440
place

1577
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:39,520
sidewall collapse i usually think about

1578
01:02:37,440 --> 01:02:41,440
this like an avalanche

1579
01:02:39,520 --> 01:02:43,520
actually at big iron last week we had

1580
01:02:41,440 --> 01:02:45,520
some students come through and they they

1581
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:48,000
claim to me that there is no way that

1582
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:50,480
can happen in a bin and i said yes

1583
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:52,799
absolutely this can happen in a bin it's

1584
01:02:50,480 --> 01:02:57,440
because you get really really high

1585
01:02:52,799 --> 01:03:00,240
moisture moldy corn that's starting to

1586
01:02:57,440 --> 01:03:02,240
solidify essentially into this wall but

1587
01:03:00,240 --> 01:03:04,400
you'll still have free-flowing pieces

1588
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:06,480
that once you break that crust layer it

1589
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,760
can quickly avalanche

1590
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:09,599
and now you're going to see a scene out

1591
01:03:07,760 --> 01:03:12,319
of a playground i'm getting close to

1592
01:03:09,599 --> 01:03:15,520
wrapping up here i promise but

1593
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:18,400
you know it's all about perspective okay

1594
01:03:15,520 --> 01:03:20,480
i show this slide because to all of us

1595
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:22,319
looking at it it's a pretty innocent

1596
01:03:20,480 --> 01:03:25,119
slide right it's a pretty innocent

1597
01:03:22,319 --> 01:03:27,280
ladder um we take kiddos to the park all

1598
01:03:25,119 --> 01:03:29,440
the time and a lot of times these these

1599
01:03:27,280 --> 01:03:32,000
are the different pieces of equipment

1600
01:03:29,440 --> 01:03:34,720
that kids get to play on so to to a

1601
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:37,520
child this is this is a playground but

1602
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:40,079
then i ask you well what about this how

1603
01:03:37,520 --> 01:03:42,799
is this different and so it's all about

1604
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:45,359
perspective and making sure that not

1605
01:03:42,799 --> 01:03:47,760
only are we concerned about people going

1606
01:03:45,359 --> 01:03:50,400
into the bin but then also what are

1607
01:03:47,760 --> 01:03:52,960
those hazards um

1608
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:55,119
when when we have kids on the farm

1609
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:57,280
because a lot of times

1610
01:03:55,119 --> 01:03:59,440
our our farm yards are not separated

1611
01:03:57,280 --> 01:04:01,920
from the house it's it's all or nothing

1612
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:03,839
it's a whole entire yard and so taking

1613
01:04:01,920 --> 01:04:05,039
the time to not only

1614
01:04:03,839 --> 01:04:07,440
um

1615
01:04:05,039 --> 01:04:09,839
you know not go in the bin but to help

1616
01:04:07,440 --> 01:04:11,520
put aids together such as on the right

1617
01:04:09,839 --> 01:04:14,000
side you're gonna see this panel door

1618
01:04:11,520 --> 01:04:16,240
which simply is just you know a piece of

1619
01:04:14,000 --> 01:04:17,839
sheet metal or a piece of tin that that

1620
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:19,680
they've locked in front of that ladder

1621
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:21,839
to prevent people from

1622
01:04:19,680 --> 01:04:22,799
and even kiddos from climbing and going

1623
01:04:21,839 --> 01:04:24,880
in

1624
01:04:22,799 --> 01:04:26,480
and so just to kind of

1625
01:04:24,880 --> 01:04:29,200
give a quick summary

1626
01:04:26,480 --> 01:04:31,760
you know really like 10 ken talked about

1627
01:04:29,200 --> 01:04:34,400
and i talk about all the time it starts

1628
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:36,319
with really good grain going in the bin

1629
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:39,280
um if you have poor grain going in the

1630
01:04:36,319 --> 01:04:42,559
bin that doesn't get dried properly or

1631
01:04:39,280 --> 01:04:44,799
has issues to start with it's not going

1632
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:46,720
to get better over time that's a huge

1633
01:04:44,799 --> 01:04:49,119
misconception is that oh if i leave it

1634
01:04:46,720 --> 01:04:51,520
in there it'll work itself out it's

1635
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,480
that's not true

1636
01:04:51,520 --> 01:04:55,440
i always say have a plan in place

1637
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,200
and

1638
01:04:55,440 --> 01:04:58,960
you know ultimately

1639
01:04:57,200 --> 01:05:01,359
i don't want any i don't want i don't

1640
01:04:58,960 --> 01:05:04,160
want producers in the bin but i realize

1641
01:05:01,359 --> 01:05:06,160
that's easier said than done um and and

1642
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:09,200
that's why having a plan in place and

1643
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:11,760
and talking with you as agents it is

1644
01:05:09,200 --> 01:05:13,760
really important to hash that out and

1645
01:05:11,760 --> 01:05:16,960
figure out what that looks like

1646
01:05:13,760 --> 01:05:17,680
um and then making sure that

1647
01:05:16,960 --> 01:05:20,079
you

1648
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:22,079
you're ready to go that fall protection

1649
01:05:20,079 --> 01:05:25,599
is ready your observer observers ready

1650
01:05:22,079 --> 01:05:28,240
lockout tag out and then realizing that

1651
01:05:25,599 --> 01:05:30,400
if you make that choice to go in

1652
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:32,880
every action you choose has a

1653
01:05:30,400 --> 01:05:33,760
consequence to it all bets are off the

1654
01:05:32,880 --> 01:05:36,079
table

1655
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:39,359
the minute you make that choice and so

1656
01:05:36,079 --> 01:05:42,000
to to finally uh follow up i i guess i

1657
01:05:39,359 --> 01:05:43,520
ask you and i ask this to the producers

1658
01:05:42,000 --> 01:05:45,920
you know what's what's your biggest

1659
01:05:43,520 --> 01:05:48,079
asset on your farm and what's it worth

1660
01:05:45,920 --> 01:05:50,559
you know is it that beautiful shiny john

1661
01:05:48,079 --> 01:05:52,799
deere combine if you're a green fan

1662
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,799
how about any quad track fans out there

1663
01:05:52,799 --> 01:05:56,400
that that piece of equipment's pretty

1664
01:05:54,799 --> 01:05:58,480
awesome

1665
01:05:56,400 --> 01:05:59,200
for those that are loving livestock like

1666
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:02,160
me

1667
01:05:59,200 --> 01:06:04,160
you got this million dollar bull that

1668
01:06:02,160 --> 01:06:06,480
sold a few years ago that's a pretty big

1669
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,440
asset to own i think i'd be scared to

1670
01:06:06,480 --> 01:06:09,440
own that

1671
01:06:07,440 --> 01:06:12,240
and then for any of you or if it's just

1672
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:14,240
me out there uh sheet producers you know

1673
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:16,720
a couple years ago we had a seven

1674
01:06:14,240 --> 01:06:18,960
thousand dollar ram sell at the hedinger

1675
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:21,440
ram sale and so we've got some pretty

1676
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:24,240
big assets and and a lot of our farm

1677
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:26,799
yards they have entire

1678
01:06:24,240 --> 01:06:29,200
commercial elevator systems now it's

1679
01:06:26,799 --> 01:06:31,839
it's not the days where your local

1680
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:34,640
elevator was the only elevator most most

1681
01:06:31,839 --> 01:06:36,720
farm systems now have an entire elevator

1682
01:06:34,640 --> 01:06:38,319
themselves and so we're looking at

1683
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:41,520
millions and millions of dollars of

1684
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:43,520
equipment here but the reality is uh the

1685
01:06:41,520 --> 01:06:45,280
correct answer is the biggest asset on

1686
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,599
your farm is is you

1687
01:06:45,280 --> 01:06:49,520
you're the one um

1688
01:06:47,599 --> 01:06:51,200
that that needs to come home safely

1689
01:06:49,520 --> 01:06:53,680
every night and there is no amount of

1690
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:55,440
equipment or livestock in this world

1691
01:06:53,680 --> 01:06:57,280
that is worth more than you and your

1692
01:06:55,440 --> 01:06:59,200
family

1693
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,039
and and how are you going to protect it

1694
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:02,000
and and that means taking some time to

1695
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,240
plan

1696
01:07:02,000 --> 01:07:07,440
invest in safety

1697
01:07:04,240 --> 01:07:09,680
and so with that um i will stop and and

1698
01:07:07,440 --> 01:07:12,160
take on any questions or comments from

1699
01:07:09,680 --> 01:07:12,160
the crowd

1700
01:07:12,240 --> 01:07:18,000
what people are thinking i'll just add

1701
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:20,799
that not only can that avalanche

1702
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:23,200
of grain cover you in the bin

1703
01:07:20,799 --> 01:07:24,319
uh we have had one fatality in north

1704
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:26,960
dakota

1705
01:07:24,319 --> 01:07:29,359
where the farmer was standing outside of

1706
01:07:26,960 --> 01:07:31,119
the door

1707
01:07:29,359 --> 01:07:33,760
and the corn

1708
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:36,079
come rushing out the door and covered

1709
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,039
him up knocked him down and covered them

1710
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:37,839
up

1711
01:07:37,039 --> 01:07:40,079
so

1712
01:07:37,839 --> 01:07:43,359
surprisingly

1713
01:07:40,079 --> 01:07:45,599
you're not even safe outside the bed

1714
01:07:43,359 --> 01:07:47,760
yeah and i mean it's just realizing the

1715
01:07:45,599 --> 01:07:50,720
the hazards that are there i mean we

1716
01:07:47,760 --> 01:07:51,599
unfortunately it takes it takes a

1717
01:07:50,720 --> 01:07:54,319
casual

1718
01:07:51,599 --> 01:07:56,079
a bad situation for us to learn and that

1719
01:07:54,319 --> 01:07:58,160
can totally be prevented with more

1720
01:07:56,079 --> 01:08:00,720
awareness and education

1721
01:07:58,160 --> 01:08:02,880
so folks if you have questions please

1722
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:04,640

1723
