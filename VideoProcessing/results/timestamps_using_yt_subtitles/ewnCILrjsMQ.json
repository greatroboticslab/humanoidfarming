  "text": "[Music] European and American farmers employ Advanced agriculture technology in modern farming methods to cultivate and harvest premium grape varieties transforming them into Exquisite wine from meticulously grafting grafted grape Vines to utilizing Cutting Edge harvesting machines the process combines tradition with innovation this captivating sty Farm documentary explores every step of grape cultivation showcasing the dedication and expertise behind the creation of worldclass [Music] wines the process of cultivating and caring for grap Vines requires Advanced Techniques and dedication Farmers typically start by selecting highquality grape varieties and Performing B grafting of grape Vines onto well prepared rooted graphs after planting The Vines are nurtured in quing grape Gardens using all modern agricultural technology to optimize onam cultivation and ensure the best growth o pruning grape vine is a critical stage in this process removing unnecessary branches shaping the plants and focusing Nutri nutrients on the fruit this technique not only boosts yield but also enhances grape quality especially in Japanese grape Farms or high-end Vineyards in Europe the combination of AI modern technology and traditional expertise creates a distinct advantage in grape production and harvesting expensive grapes [Music] harvesting grapes is one of the most crucial stages in modern farming and agricultural production this process can be carried out manually or using Modern Machinery depending on the scale and purpose of the Basham Farm in h when manual harvesting farmers use specialized pruning shears to carefully cut each grape cluster from the qu grafted grape Vines this technique is especially suitable for plin Japanese grape Farms or premium or grape Gardens where grapes are meticulously selected to ensure the highest quality it is a common method in high-end grape production to preserve the Integrity of the fruit catering to products like premium wine or expensive fresh grapes a expensive grape Harvest [Music] on the other hand for larger scale operations requiring High productivity harvesting machines are widely used these machines utilize all modern agricultural technology to separate grapes from The Vines without damaging the fruit some devices are equipped with regenerative agriculture techn ology to protect the plants and soil after harvesting this process is often featured in on documentaries about Martian modern agriculture showcasing the seamless integration of Advanced Techniques with practical demands whether harvested manually or with Machinery this stage is vital in preparing for subsequent steps such as transportation to Pon processing factories or direct processing into grape based products [Applause] [Music] the process of turning freshly harvested a grapes into wine is a meticulous combination of a tradition and calm modern agricultural technology it begins with transporting the grapes from the farm to the ha processing Factory where they are carefully sorted and prepared for fermentation both while manually harvesting grapes and those collected with harvesting machines undergo this transformation once at the facility the grapes are crushed to extract juice while separating the skins and seeds this step often features Advanced we machines to ensure efficiency and maintain quality especially for non find expensive grape harvests the extracted juice is transferred to fermentation tanks where it interacts with natural or added yeasts to begin the process of turning sugars into alcohol this stage highlights the role of Ori modern technology in maintaining precise control over temperature and timing after fermentation the wine is aged in barrels or tanks depending on the desired flavor profile throughout Innovations in farming technology and regenerative agriculture practices ensure the grapes retain their full potential making each bottle a reflection of the king grape cultivation qu process the final product is bottled labeled and distributed completing a journey often celebrated in farm documentaries showcasing the art of wine [Music] making now let's head to Japan to explore how Japanese Farmers produce the most expensive Bunches of grapes in the world Japan is famous for producing the world's most expensive grape varieties thanks to the Y unique combination of high-tech Agriculture and traditional techniques Japanese grape Farms are a model of meticulous agricultural practices where each bunch of grapes is carefully tended from the time they are grafted seedlings Farmers apply Advanced Techniques such as grafting and growing plants in green houses along with modern technology systems to control light and temperature the harvesting of these expensive grapes is done entirely by hand to ensure each fruit reaches the highest quality a agricultural documentaries often capture images of beautiful vineyards where every step of care is marked by precision and Artistry Advanced Technologies and regenerative agriculture not only improve yields but also preserve the sustainability of these rare grape varieties after the expense of grape Harvest Japanese Farmers meticulously prune the grape Vines and clean the grape Garden to prepare for the next cycle of cultivation using modern agriculture technology they carefully remove small or underdeveloped grapes from the grafted grape Vines ensuring only the best grapes grow to maturity grape seedlings are nurtured with precision and rooted grafted Vines are mon monitored closely Farmers then bag individual grape clusters to protect them from pests and weather a Hallmark of modern agricultural practices these steps often featured in farming documentaries highlight the dedication and advanced farming technology employed in Japanese grape farms for premium grape cultivation in Japanese grape Farms grape harvesting is done entirely by hand to ensure the high highest quality for every fruit farmers carefully select and pick each grape a process that requires precision and skill afterward the grapes are meticulously packed in protective packaging ready for transport this process often highlighted in farming documentaries showcases the advanced agriculture farming techniques in dedication to Grape cultivation in modern Japanese agriculture through this journey we've explored the Artistry and dedication behind European and American wine production and the meticulous care that goes into the expensive grape Harvest of Japanese Farmers these stories of modern Agriculture and farming technology highlight the passion and Innovation driving grape cultivation across the globe see you next time",
