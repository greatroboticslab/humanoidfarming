[Music]

4
00:00:13,340 --> 00:00:18,359
stewardship program is based on an

5
00:00:16,440 --> 00:00:20,220
agreement on sustainable agricultural

6
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,100
practices on the one side of the

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:24,900
agreement the Farms commit to adopting a

8
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:26,820
series of agricultural practices that

9
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:29,220
benefit the environment on the other

10
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,019
side in recognition of this commitment

11
00:00:29,220 --> 00:00:33,360
that benefits society as a whole

12
00:00:31,019 --> 00:00:35,880
government Orca helps these Farms

13
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,160
through different ways one way is taking

14
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,100
action on farms by providing services

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:43,920
and materials ultimately what is sought

16
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,960
is to help and accompany the farmer in

17
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:48,360
their Journey towards sustainable

18
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,399
agriculture production it is a way of

19
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,680
giving a final push to make the changes

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,739
they want but for one reason or another

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,899
they are unable to be due to economic

22
00:00:55,739 --> 00:01:00,660
reasons or lack of time

23
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:03,000
we take action in many areas in relation

24
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:04,559
to the farm but we could group them into

25
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,420
five main blocks

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,939
the first block is improving soil

27
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:10,619
fertility soil fertility is the basis of

28
00:01:08,939 --> 00:01:12,720
soil productivity and has huge

29
00:01:10,619 --> 00:01:15,240
repercussions in relation to the Farm's

30
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,340
economic viability in this area we

31
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,380
provide soil analysis soil management

32
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,540
recommendations and we also accompany

33
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:23,700
the farmers in implementing new directed

34
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,479
grazing practices and the materials

35
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:26,479
needed for this

36
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:33,000
the second block is improving water

37
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:35,640
management practices

38
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,439
in this case we aim to reduce as much as

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,600
possible the extraction of fresh water

40
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,100
from the aquifer because it is over

41
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,259
exploited

42
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,659
we also want to help maintain humidity

43
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,880
in the soil to improve soil fertility

44
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:50,100
what we do essentially is to restore

45
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,380
rainwater harvesting systems that are no

46
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:54,600
longer working or are abandoned for

47
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:57,000
example traditional Canal systems or

48
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:59,159
traditional systems called all jobs and

49
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:00,420
then we innovate them with solar power

50
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,420
pumps

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:05,700
also we ate soil water retention through

52
00:02:03,420 --> 00:02:08,039
keyline Landscaping techniques rainwater

53
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,979
canals and swales or installing covers

54
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:13,319
to protect from the Sun and Heat

55
00:02:10,979 --> 00:02:16,080
we have a third book of action which is

56
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:18,000
focused on biodiversity conservation so

57
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,160
as an environmental organization we have

58
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,560
an intrinsic interest in conservation

59
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,420
but there's also numerous benefits of

60
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:27,260
farmers too such as increased crop

61
00:02:24,420 --> 00:02:28,980
resilience and biological Pest Control

62
00:02:27,260 --> 00:02:30,959
[Music]

63
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:32,640
in this case we carry out annual

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,800
bio-indicator monitoring of certain

65
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,200
species and this is done through citizen

66
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:39,420
science project and it's carried out by

67
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:41,340
volunteers

68
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:44,099
we also create water sources for

69
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:46,140
wildlife and install nesting boxes to

70
00:02:44,099 --> 00:02:48,959
encourage natural predators and these

71
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,120
control pests and diseases on the farm

72
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,700
the fourth block of action is linked to

73
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,099
Habitat conservation for example we

74
00:02:53,700 --> 00:02:58,379
carry out a natural value inventory of

75
00:02:56,099 --> 00:03:00,780
each farm and this helps us detect areas

76
00:02:58,379 --> 00:03:02,040
to acts upon and it better helps us

77
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:03,360
better understand the land that we're

78
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:05,160
protecting

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:06,720
then what we do is collaborate in

80
00:03:05,160 --> 00:03:09,540
habitat maintenance and restoration

81
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,819
actions so especially for forested areas

82
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,040
these are of Interest so that cattle can

83
00:03:11,819 --> 00:03:16,019
Refuge from the Heat and also wild

84
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:18,000
pasture lands because these offer

85
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,940
quality food for livestock at a near

86
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,659
zero cost while they're also cataloged

87
00:03:20,940 --> 00:03:26,400
as priority habitats at a European level

88
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:28,260
and we generally carry out this work

89
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,400
through volunteering sessions that are

90
00:03:28,260 --> 00:03:31,400
run one Sunday a month

91
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:36,959
finally the fifth block consists of

92
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,060
restoring Landscapes so the Mosaic

93
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,860
landscape is characteristic of monoka

94
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:44,220
and it includes a patchwork of dry stone

95
00:03:40,860 --> 00:03:46,200
walls fields and forested areas and this

96
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:48,480
landscape also includes ethnological

97
00:03:46,200 --> 00:03:50,519
elements that are important parts of the

98
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,019
Island's identity and at the end of the

99
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,519
day this is what we all see in our

100
00:03:52,019 --> 00:03:56,340
surrounding and we think this is really

101
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:58,319
important so we offer waste removal

102
00:03:56,340 --> 00:04:00,780
services for Farms we install

103
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,420
traditional Wild Olive Tree Gates

104
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:05,340
we also help restore structures that are

105
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:07,319
made from traditional dry stone walls

106
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,959
that help protect fruit trees within

107
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,939
pasture lands

108
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:14,099
this would be a summary of ways in which

109
00:04:11,939 --> 00:04:16,320
we take action and invest in the Farms

110
00:04:14,099 --> 00:04:18,359
that are part of custody agraria but we

111
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:20,100
also carry out other activities such as

112
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:21,840
Product Promotion training and

113
00:04:20,100 --> 00:04:23,580
Consulting and working with the general

114
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,440
public through volunteering and

115
00:04:23,580 --> 00:04:28,080
Environmental Education and we will

116
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:30,620
explain these in the other videos

117
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,160
[Music]

118
00:04:30,620 --> 00:04:34,160
thank you
