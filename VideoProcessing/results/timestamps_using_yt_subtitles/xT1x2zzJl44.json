  "text": "today I'm going to be talking about budgeting for strawberry production my name is Jesse Rowan I'm on the farm and agribusiness team as well as the commercial Horticulture team so I work primarily with fruit and vegetable Growers um in the central part of the state and so today I'm going to talk about I'm going to talk about the budget that we have available online through the extension website and then I'm going to kind of break it down by the different input costs within that budget and the different input costs related to Strawberry production and then I'm going to touch on how you can budget for your farm for your own form all right so to start with the budget we have online it looks a lot like this it's just that first summary page and it's actually um it's from 2019. we are in the process of getting an updated version put online but um if you can't tell a lot of things have changed in the past few years a lot of prices have gone up but this budget still really provides a good list a good summary of the expected cost uh just the expected expenses you would have on one acre of strawberries some of the assumptions within this Enterprise budget that's already online um or that we use six foot spacing that all these strawberries are sold for The Fresh Market that plastic mulch is used um and within this budget they also account for Harvest labor it's not a U-Pick operation this is if you were to hire crop workers to harvest your entire crop of strawberries and also within this budget they account for cover crops which is great that's something chip really looks as big on and he could touch on it more if anyone had questions about it but also within this budget this online already so the first page of it is and is that summary that I just showed you on the first page the second third and fourth page it kind of it lists out the field operations and it looks a little intimidating if you're looking at this and you see a lot of numbers and a lot of decimals but really it's really good to look at to see the operation you know what activity you might be doing like a soil test you know applying fertilizer apply in line or plant in your cover crops and it also shows you in what month you could do that and this there's a little give and take for you know people growing strawberries in north or south Alabama but it's a really good guide a good estimate to look at to kind of just show you the activities when you can expect to do them um and kind of in the order of which you should do things like they have soil tests and then later on in the season I think it's in March they have um they want you to do a plant tissue sample so it really just gives you the optimal optimal time in which to do these activities um and it also gives a good estimate of about how many Harvest hours you could expect you know um a lot of labor hour estimates that are really that would be really beneficial to someone planning on starting a strawberry operation so I wanted to talk next about the input cost uh so since his budget is made uh since it's from 2019 you would expect a lot of things have gone up since then you know covet has occurred since then and then all the supply chain issues that occurred then and have still kind of hung around some so that's going to be things like fertilizer that's going to be something that you can look at this budget you can look at this budget summary but know that the prices are going to be a lot higher for things like fertilizer chemicals plants labor and fuel I mean you can look at the price of diesel fuel in this 2019 budget and see there's 270 a gallon that's not where we're at today as lovely as that would be and you can also see they accounted for 11 an hour for a lot of their labor that's it's really it's really going to be tough to come by any labor nowadays uh where you're paying them 11 an hour um and then some of the obvious things are like fertilizer chemicals and plants those have gone up over the past couple years especially fertilizer and chemicals have gone up with the fuel fuel cost increases um just as energy goes up in price those are going to correlate right along with it oh sorry I went back a couple of slides so first I'm going to talk about fertilizer the it's right on the nose everyone knows that the price of fertilizer has gone up drastically in the past couple years so in that older budget they estimated that you'd spend about 665 dollars on an acre of strawberries yes no longer the case I can't give exact numbers for y'all today because that's going to depend on your soil test and you know what kind of fertilizer what you need for your farm what you need for your land but the USDA economic research service they estimated and this is just around nitrogen fertilizers but they estimated that all three kinds of nitrogen fertilizer are going to go up you know over 100 percent you can see in this graph this graph is just showing how urea prices have changed over the past two years so you see that purple line is 20 20. you know pretty steady a little up and down but pretty pretty bag unsteady the green line 2021 you see around September the end the last quarter of last year it skyrocketed and then you see the red line is 2022. continues to go up it starts at 920 an acre uh I mean 920 a ton for urea and then you can see it's just angling up so it's really it's just going to get higher um and that's really just something to take into consideration when you're planning for your strawberry operation or really any kind of operation and something that extension really encourages is testing your stool that way you're accurately applying the correct amount of fertilizer you're not spending money on fertilizer that you don't need that's not going to be absorbed well in your soil and so a soil sample that is really just going to give you a really good idea of what you need to put in your soil and also a couple times a year with a strawberry operation you could have a tissue sample sent off and test for the nutrients in that exact tissue sample um so the cost for a soil sample is around seven dollars that's pretty inexpensive to me to know exactly what my land needs and especially as the prices of fertilizer just continue to go up paying seven dollars to know exactly what you need to spend on fertilizer is a pretty good deal um that way you're not spending money on it extra fertilizer that you're not going to need um so really this just kind of goes to show that when you're trying to budget for any kind of fruit or vegetable production you know and prices are going up in all these different input sections the more the more accurate and the more tailored you can make those costs to your farm the better the more efficient you can be the better because really at the end of the day that's all you can do you can control what you can control you can't control the fertilizer process you can't make them go down can't make the price of fuel go down but all you can do is use just what you need not spending money on things you don't need and just having as efficiently run operation as you can um and I also just wanted to throw in that you can spend anywhere between ten or eighty dollars for a tissue sample and that can give you a really good idea of the nutrients your plants themselves are taking up so the next thing I wanted to touch on um the next input cost that's gone up has been labor and this graph you don't have to look at all the numbers per se but really just focusing on the fact that that green line is the number of crop workers that have been uh oh sorry the green line is the dollars per hour that those uh that crop workers are being paid you can see it in 2015 it was pretty low it was around 11 an hour um at the tail end of 2021 the wage for those workers was around 15 an hour you can look at that blue one that just shows the number of workers has stayed pretty steady it dips down and this is really related to fruit and vegetable production so the number of crop workers is going to get down around January December of every year because that's just when we don't have as many crop workers in the U.S a lot of them come through on a program that's around 10 months long so um they may go back to their home for a couple months a year but the top of those Peaks that's going to show that's a really good representation of the number of crop workers just hired in the U.S and you can see the top of this Peaks it stayed pretty steady it goes It goes across pretty well it was a little lower in 2020 because covet threw off everything but you can see that the number of workers has stayed pretty steady yet the price that we're paying those workers continues to go up it does not dip down much just steadily increasing um and another just another segment of that budget that has increased along with everything else row cover this may not be as drastic of a price increase as some of the other objects um it was priced around a thousand dollars a roll in 2019 I've looked up similar roles in 2022 I seen some for around 1200 1400 um and you have that initial investment but it is something that you can reuse so it's not something that you might have to buy every year or a couple times a year or something you can get a lot of uses out of um but also something specific to Strawberry production so you have a lot of labor involved in using a row cover and a row cover is necessary in Strawberry production whenever it gets below freezing temperatures you have to cover up the strawberry so they're not damaged by any of the frogs um or any of the cold temperatures and so it's really important to have Labor um even if you were to have a you pick operation and you didn't have a hired crew of people to pick your crops you still need to have enough people to lay this row row cover over your strawberries um and you're going to need access to that crew um at really specific at really key time so it's not something that's labor intensive all the time but around January and February it's going to be really labor intensive at Key times and it's going to be really important that you have enough labor to put that over your crops in a timely manner foreign I can't skim over this when I'm talking about strawberry production something that I've heard from Growers uh from colleagues is that you cannot spare fungicides that's something we really don't want you to skimp on anything um you don't need to skimp on IPM or fungicides but I've been told that especially fungicides that something that's really important in Strawberry production in keeping those berries and keeping those plants healthy looking so it's something that's really crucial to the operation so chemical prices have gone up over the past couple years um just as some of these supply chain issues continue um and so a piece of advice I usually give Farmers if they're worried about the process some of their chemicals going up um or even sometimes of a certain chemical being available when they need it I just tell them to buy it when they can even if it's January and it's something that you don't need for four months if you see it at the store and you know you're going to use it um you know you're going to need it go ahead and buy it because you don't necessarily want to rely on this uh supply chain you know all these chemicals that are imported you don't want to have to rely on that um and then not be able to get something when you need it foreign and also so rotation of strawberries is important um it's something I know that not every Farm does this but if sufficient land is available it's something that can really benefit you and so before going into a strawberry growing operation um this is really something that you would like to have planned out a lot of people they like to leave your land without strawberries for a couple of years but some people just rotate every other year but just some kind of rotation is really beneficial to kind of relieves some of that disease pressure insect pressure and it can lead to better productivity I mean there are ways to still increase your productivity if you can't rotate but it's just something that's generally encouraged and also plastic culture this is another part of strawberry production that is an investment every year um so just the capital investment in the plastic mulch you know the labor investment of shaping the beds laying it down um that's something that's really it's really uh just gonna be a cost you need to be prepared for have it planned in your budget um so I've got the prices for a couple of years ago that may not help you now and I know there's so many different places you can get plastic culture I've seen some online I've seen some uh 2400 foot rolls I think it was four foot wide for around 130 dollars that I've used in some other budgets when I'm including the price of uh of plastic mulch but also some farmers will plant another crop into that plastic mold which after the strawberries to kind of just spread the cost of it onto another crop anytime you can do that it's just instead of attributing the whole cost of this plastic mulch for strawberries you can spread it over strawberries or onions strawberries and whatever the other crop may be and it just kind of spreads out that investment of something that it's not something that can be reused the next year is something that's just good for one year all right and so the cost of plants that's going to be your biggest investment I believe when it comes to Strawberry production that's something um so I have a range on here listed I've I've seen them this year for around 45 to 50 cents a plan I've seen them lower than that seeing them around 30 cents 35 cents per plant um but that's really just to show that in the older budget from 2019 I think they were selling for I think it was 24 or 23 cents per plant and just to show that in some places the price of plants have doubled um and these are something that's typically purchased locally if you want to get organic plugs that usually is done they usually have to be brought in from somewhere outside of Alabama and so you're going to be planting I did a little math on here not to scare anyone but so if you're planting around 1400 plugs per acre I mean 14 000 plugs per acre and say they're 50 cents each you're spending around seven thousand dollars just on your plants um that is just a huge investment in terms of money spent on Plants I can't think of a whole lot of other uh fruit and vegetable production where you're spending that kind of money on just the plant itself just you know the plug um so it's really it's a major investment um that you really need to I say to plan around it but this would kind of be the basis of your plan um and you would need to plan everything else around this to make sure that you're managing everything as well as you can to take care of these plants that are your major investment and so another thing that is a really a really big cost in Strawberry production would be labor so nobody's denying that strawberry strawberry production is a really uh it's a it's a crop that Demands a lot of investment initial investment so we covered the investment of the plants and you know and then everything else that goes along with that production system but also you have a lot of labor involved in pre-harvest and can have a lot of Labor in the post-harvest section of your farm so pre-harvest you're going to have you know land prep like you do with anything planting is going to be pretty labor intensive because you have to have someone personally putting each plug into those holes I I guess you could have a planter but it's typically done by hand um scouting spraying other management involved so irrigation would fall under that Scouting For pests Scouting For diseases um just anything involved in the management that's going to be a lot of labor involved and then also like I mentioned previously Frost protection so having you're just having those periods of time where you have to get a crew of people to roll out these row covers and put sandbags or put anything down you know to hold it in place there's going to be a good bit of Labor in that and I mean that can change year to year depending on how many freezes you have I mean how many you have late into the year that could really damage your uh your plants but that's just it it's labor it can't be overlooked that you're gonna need to have Labor accounted for you know all of these tasks and post Harvest you can or you cannot have a lot of uh labor yourself in the operation so like in the budget I mentioned at the beginning of this presentation they accounted for Harvest labor um and I think they accounted for it was about 30 hours a week harvesting uh yeah 30 hours per week in the months of April and May and so that can kind of be gone around if you were to have a U-Pick operation um it can't go around it completely because even with the U-Pick operation you're going to need a you're gonna want to have some of them picked um or at least gleaned after by some of the people on your farm a lot of you pick operations will offer you pick and then also some pre-picked buckets um so it's not like you can depend just on consumers to come out there and pick the berries for themselves but that can decrease that can take away so much of the labor that you need um if you were to have a you pick operation and that can actually I mean that can save you money um you know save you from hiring more people to harvest all those berries because you know they're time sensitive dairies don't have a super long shelf life it's something they need to be peaked when they need to be peaked um and it's a lot of intense production in April and May and so you know having a you pick operation just can save you a lot of money on hiring a uh you know a harvesting crew but you're still going to need some labor to glean you know to offer some pre-picked buckets most likely and then to clean up afterwards that's just something that can be avoided and so this next slide I took a little inspiration from Chip East um Chip's always talking about people Farmers getting the retail dollar and that's really that's how you can get the most bang for your book as a strawberry producer so the retail prices are going to be higher than processed or wholesale prices that's kind of a given that's that's uh usually the case in a lot and a lot of fruits you know if you're selling direct to a consumer you can charge a higher price um and they can also be used for value-added products if you were to have some that didn't sell which I don't often hear I hear about a lot of strawberry Farmers selling out um or at least that's how it's been the past couple weeks but if you had some or if you just wanted to use some for a value-added product to sell later in the year um or to sell you know alongside your fresh strawberries that's something they could be used for and like I mentioned before um a U-Pick operation that can save on harvest labor and it can also save on marketing costs because if you were to have a you pick operation consumers are driving to your farm they're picking the berries they're paying for that gallon bucket however much of strawberries and then they're leaving um and while you have you know something extra for that would be you know you have extra people on your farm that you wouldn't normally have but you're also from the farmer's point of view you're not having to go out um and drive to a farmer's market you're not having to drive to a store and deliver your berries um you're not really having to go much of anywhere I mean you're still probably going to spend some money on signs maybe some advertisements but it you could save a lot on marketing costs as well as harvest labor so that's just something to consider um especially if you if you want to have a strawberry operation um and you know you know that you can't uh you don't have access to as much labor as you would need to harvest them all that's just a direction you could turn your operation in um and save money on a couple of things and so I'm going to skip the next slide just because I'm a little short on time and I wanted to talk about how you can budget for your farm and so um this screenshot that I have up here right now that's how most of our Horticultural budgets typically look um the ones that we've gone through and redone they all look like this and this isn't all of it I just took a grab of you know the top half of it so that you can see how it's laid out that you have receipts at the top you have all your variable costs and then below this you would have your fixed cost listed and so uh we should have a strawberry budget out like this uh in a couple months or so but um it's something if you were to already have an operation you wouldn't even necessarily have to have this to keep track or to keep a budget for your farm you could keep track of it in a similar manner on uh you know on your farm computer and so this one is set up because uh the two columns in blue you can change you can change the numbers change quantity the cost per unit of certain items and then get a different cost per acre but if you were to do this on your own Farm you could keep track of so I would start out I would keep track of the strawberries you sell either you pick um it would be helpful to keep track of how many you sell that are actually you pick and how many you sell that are pre-picked buckets that way you know you can just keep an eye on how consumers are buying um and then you can list all of your own costs under this um but something like this these budgets that we provide online they provide you a good list of your variable cost and what you should be keeping track of some of them are even listed at zero they're listed on there just so you can go through yourself and say like a land rent if you're not renting a land then you could just leave that zero across that whole line but if you are renting the land that's where you would need to input that cost but it's really helpful just to provide a list of what you need to create a budget but you can do this yourself for your own Farm by keeping track of just how much you spend on soil tests your plants uh you know any other tests you may do like a soil uh like a tissue analysis and then how much you spend on fertilizer lime um especially if someone if you were to keep track of it this year you can look at it next year see if things have gone up or if they've gone back down or if things have have gotten even crazier but it's just it's really good to keep track of these kind of things you can look at them year after year um really the Enterprise budget is really beneficial for someone planning the one that we have online is really good for someone planning to get into strawberry production but if you already have a farm if you started and then a couple years into it it's really going to help you to keep this budget to keep this type of budget for your own operation the numbers that we put in it are all estimates because every Farm is different every Farmer's different everyone has different assets different strengths um and just different costs you know some farmer may may need a ton of fertilizer may need to amend their soil so much say it's been uh it's it's been empty for a few years and they're having you know completely amended from scratch and to say someone has lended they have taken care of and amended for five or ten years um you know your costs are just going to be different based on your land the farmer himself you know and his management practices and how he wants to go about things um but keeping track of those things can really help you budget for the next year and that's essentially uh what you want to do you want to keep track of your expenses year after year and then use them when you're planning for the next year um it really it can help you notice changes year to year noticing Trends and it helps you better plan out your expenses for the following year and that's that's what we all want we all want to have a better idea of what we're going to spend so we can have a better idea of what we can earn from it all right that's that's the end of my presentation I hope I didn't go too long um but I have my contact information listed up here if you have any questions feel free to reach out to me",
