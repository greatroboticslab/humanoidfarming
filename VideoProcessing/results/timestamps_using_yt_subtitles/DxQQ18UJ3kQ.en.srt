00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
good day uh my name is dawn tipping i'm

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:06,240
here at

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,000
siskiyou seeds in our propagation

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,759
greenhouse and i wanted to share

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:13,440
a few uh tips for guidance on what you

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:14,960
could be planting right now we're in a

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:18,880
bit of a transition time

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:22,320
in between the spring cool season crops

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:23,600
of the greens and the roots and the warm

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,279
season crops where

11
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:28,560
here in oregon it's too cold still to be

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:31,679
planting things like

13
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,520
corn and melons and squash outside

14
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,600
but you could be starting some of them

15
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
inside so we've been getting a few

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:38,399
questions through email and at the

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,200
market and stuff

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:43,280
of people planting cucumbers outside and

19
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,920
they're saying my seeds aren't coming up

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,039
and i wanted to share this idea of soil

21
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,879
temperature so for

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
all the cool season crops they can

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,760
germinate in cool soils

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,920
down to about 40 degrees fahrenheit they

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,559
can still grow in warmer soils

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,079
lettuce would be an exception of about

27
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,000
70 degrees

28
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,400
lettuce is not going to germinate very

29
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:06,799
well so all your greens

30
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,680
they like growing in the cooler weather

31
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,880
so lettuce

32
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,479
cabbage arugula spinach swiss chard

33
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:14,000
chinese cabbage there's a bunch of other

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,400
ones broccoli

35
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:17,600
cauliflower that type of thing kale and

36
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:19,680
your root crops

37
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,040
they like to grow in the cool weather of

38
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:22,960
the spring

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,200
or in the fall is when you get the best

40
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,479
quality on your root crops they will

41
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:28,000
grow through the summer

42
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,920
but they're going to do better if you

43
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,400
start them in the spring and then

44
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:34,479
peas would be a fruiting crop that you

45
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,280
can plant in the spring or the fall but

46
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,920
they don't really

47
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:39,920
do well in the heat of the summer so

48
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,640
moving on to the warm season crops these

49
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,240
are crops

50
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:46,640
that are they can frost

51
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
if you plant them outside so not only

52
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:50,240
will

53
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,439
they do they need warm temperatures to

54
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
sprout

55
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,880
they also need warm temperatures to grow

56
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,159
because for instance

57
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,119
corn and squash for that matter these

58
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,840
are crops that

59
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,399
originated in mesoamerica so they're

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:07,600
used to a subtropical climate

61
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,879
so they want to sprout and keep growing

62
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,280
in warm weather

63
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,239
so here in the temperate latitudes like

64
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,680
here we're at 42 degrees north latitude

65
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:19,760
and we have to wait

66
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,280
until the soil and the air temperatures

67
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,120
warmed up and obviously the air

68
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:24,560
temperature influences the soil

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,879
temperature so consider

70
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,720
like today is a nice balmy day it's

71
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,959
probably 70 degrees outside

72
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:32,720
but at night it gets down to the high

73
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,959
30s or around 40.

74
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,200
so if you average those out 12 hours of

75
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
each your soil temperature is not going

76
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,319
to be anywhere near

77
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,879
warm enough to sprout these things so

78
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,920
you want to think about that a quick a

79
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,000
hack that you can

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,120
employ let's say you really want to get

81
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,200
a jump start on things

82
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,480
and you can look over here this is a

83
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:54,879
little trick we use

84
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,160
is we'll start corn this is early

85
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:57,760
planting of sweet corn

86
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,519
in soil blocks and you can see it's

87
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,680
already sprouting we didn't

88
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,560
have any supplemental heat other than

89
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,599
the sun

90
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,879
to get these to sprout another one would

91
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,560
be this basil

92
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:11,360
you know so we're growing starch of the

93
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,120
basil here inside because it's a little

94
00:03:11,360 --> 00:03:14,800
warmer here and it protects them from

95
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,400
frust for us

96
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,480
we want to wait until after late

97
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,480
may to be planting any of the frost

98
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,000
hardy crops either in the ground or

99
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,480
transplanting outside

100
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,599
and that is pretty much over most of the

101
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,560
northern

102
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,840
parts of the united states and you gotta

103
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:33,840
check your local climate

104
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:38,799
memorial day weekend is a bit of the the

105
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:39,760
green light time for when you can get

106
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:42,000
your garden in

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,599
so check around with your neighbors the

108
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,879
experienced gardeners and find out what

109
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,599
the local planting date is for your area

110
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,360
but i notice that we get warm days and a

111
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,120
lot of novice gardeners are just ready

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,319
to plant everything and then they're

113
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:56,799
frustrated

114
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,080
at their their poor results and they'll

115
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,680
blame the seed

116
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:03,680
or something they'll say slugs got my um

117
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:06,000
my plants or my seeds when the the

118
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,760
actuality of it all was that the soil

119
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,120
temperature was too cool and their seeds

120
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,680
rotted in the ground

121
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,200
so hopefully that helps you out and

122
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:14,000
you're able to be more successful with

123
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:20,000
growing more your own

124
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:20,000
food thanks
