13
00:00:31,710 --> 00:00:36,210
factors you should consider before

so this workshop is broken up into three

22
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:59,460
sections section one will be a personal

23
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,710
evaluation things that you need to ask

24
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,830
yourself personally before borrowing for

25
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:08,310
a poultry farm section two will cover an

26
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,750
introduction to FSA loan programs so

27
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:12,840
we'll just talk about eligibility in

28
00:01:09,750 --> 00:01:15,180
general types of loans types of FSA

29
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:16,619
lenders things like that and then

30
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:19,200
section 3 will be the application

31
00:01:16,619 --> 00:01:21,360
process where we go through applying for

32
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,970
a loan approval and denial of a loan

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:27,689
repealing alone and then restructuring

34
00:01:23,970 --> 00:01:29,670
alone so the first thing you need to do

35
00:01:27,689 --> 00:01:32,610
before borrowing to financial culture

36
00:01:29,670 --> 00:01:34,920
operations are to set your goals and to

37
00:01:32,610 --> 00:01:36,840
ask your big questions so as a family

38
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,420
sit down and write out your goals

39
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,909
discuss them make sure that everyone is

40
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:42,740
voicing their opinions prioritize your

41
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:45,210
goals

42
00:01:42,740 --> 00:01:47,579
remember that overall this is a family

43
00:01:45,210 --> 00:01:48,810
farm or family operation so you're the

44
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:52,470
well-being of your family is the most

45
00:01:48,810 --> 00:01:54,810
important thing think about is this

46
00:01:52,470 --> 00:01:58,409
business a good time good use of your

47
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,180
time and resources do you have the money

48
00:01:58,409 --> 00:02:03,869
time knowledge to make this business

49
00:02:00,180 --> 00:02:07,759
work and does this specific financing

50
00:02:03,869 --> 00:02:10,229
package work for you the price of the

51
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,270
mortgage note your payment that you're

52
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,680
going to have to make the terms the

53
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,560
interest rate everything like

54
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:18,090
so just remember that you're responsible

55
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,610
for considering all these questions

56
00:02:18,090 --> 00:02:25,709
before you apply for any type of

57
00:02:20,610 --> 00:02:27,810
financing so as an introduction to farm

58
00:02:25,709 --> 00:02:30,180
loans we have two basic types of loans

59
00:02:27,810 --> 00:02:32,040
we have an operating loan and an

60
00:02:30,180 --> 00:02:33,810
ownership loan now there are other types

61
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:34,980
of loans but we're just going to kind of

62
00:02:33,810 --> 00:02:37,680
talk about these because these are the

63
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:39,870
primary types of loans that most farmers

64
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,180
need an operating loan is a short-term

65
00:02:39,870 --> 00:02:44,280
loan to persist inputs necessary to

66
00:02:42,180 --> 00:02:46,799
operate your farm while an ownership

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,810
loan is a longer-term loan make for the

68
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,319
purchase of major farming assets like

69
00:02:48,810 --> 00:02:54,750
farmland poultry houses or equipment

70
00:02:51,319 --> 00:02:57,120
within FSA you have two types of loans

71
00:02:54,750 --> 00:03:00,239
you have a direct loan that's a loan

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,760
made by FSA to farmers where FSA is the

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,099
lender and also services the loan and

74
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,629
then you have a guaranteed loan now

75
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,609
that's a loan made by a financial

76
00:03:06,629 --> 00:03:11,730
institution like a bank or something of

77
00:03:08,609 --> 00:03:14,159
that nature which is backed by FSA so in

78
00:03:11,730 --> 00:03:17,459
that scenario your lending institution

79
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,720
is the one servicing the loan typically

80
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:22,290
that'll be someone like the Farm Credit

81
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:26,599
for example whereas FSA will financially

82
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,599
guarantee the loan up to ninety percent

83
00:03:27,079 --> 00:03:32,340
so just to understand the risk that's

84
00:03:30,060 --> 00:03:34,949
very important to do so before you apply

85
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:39,000
for a loan and understanding the steps

86
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:40,590
of evaluation are good because the

87
00:03:39,000 --> 00:03:42,299
process by which your loan will be

88
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:44,129
evaluated is different from what you

89
00:03:42,299 --> 00:03:46,949
need to do personally so in a loan

90
00:03:44,129 --> 00:03:49,560
evaluation they'll look at eligibility

91
00:03:46,949 --> 00:03:52,349
do you qualify for the loan they'll look

92
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,810
at feasibility does your loan repayment

93
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:56,940
plan makes sense will that farm loan

94
00:03:54,810 --> 00:03:59,280
cash flow and then they look at your

95
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:01,590
collateral how much collateral you have

96
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,659
how much you are offering your

97
00:04:01,590 --> 00:04:05,729
collateral can be real estate farms

98
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:07,530
equipment things of that nature

99
00:04:05,729 --> 00:04:09,389
you know but they'll look at the total

100
00:04:07,530 --> 00:04:11,159
package that you're bringing in but

101
00:04:09,389 --> 00:04:13,409
things that you need to ask yourself are

102
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,449
how well do you really know the poultry

103
00:04:13,409 --> 00:04:17,909
business have you talked to any current

104
00:04:15,449 --> 00:04:19,799
or former poultry farmers what will

105
00:04:17,909 --> 00:04:23,159
happen if you can't make that loan

106
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:26,340
payment how consistent is your pay as a

107
00:04:23,159 --> 00:04:27,510
grower and then does your contract the

108
00:04:26,340 --> 00:04:30,570
contract with your into

109
00:04:27,510 --> 00:04:33,330
traitor have any type of language that

110
00:04:30,570 --> 00:04:35,490
you really need to be aware of because

111
00:04:33,330 --> 00:04:37,380
your mortgage is a binding contract so

112
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:42,030
you want to ensure to look at the

113
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:43,800
contract from your integrator as well so

114
00:04:42,030 --> 00:04:45,530
we'll talk about collateral first and

115
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:48,540
what happens is if you default

116
00:04:45,530 --> 00:04:50,250
collateral we define as an asset offered

117
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:52,920
as security for the repayment of a loan

118
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,460
to be forfeited in the event of a

119
00:04:52,920 --> 00:04:56,220
default

120
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:59,060
so typically collateral use for farm

121
00:04:56,220 --> 00:05:03,510
loans include farms farming equipment

122
00:04:59,060 --> 00:05:05,700
vehicles land or your personal home so

123
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:09,000
in this scenario a default is a failure

124
00:05:05,700 --> 00:05:11,220
to fulfill a loan obligation especially

125
00:05:09,000 --> 00:05:13,890
to repay a loan that's something known

126
00:05:11,220 --> 00:05:15,900
as a monetary obligation and therefore

127
00:05:13,890 --> 00:05:19,080
if you do not repay your loan you're in

128
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:21,690
monetary default now you can be in

129
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:23,730
non-monetary default and that is where

130
00:05:21,690 --> 00:05:25,530
you fail to comply with a provision of

131
00:05:23,730 --> 00:05:28,830
the loan that is not relate to repayment

132
00:05:25,530 --> 00:05:31,860
such as paying your taxes on the loan

133
00:05:28,830 --> 00:05:34,530
keeping up with farm insurance on the

134
00:05:31,860 --> 00:05:36,210
property things of that nature so when

135
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,310
you borrow money to fund your poultry

136
00:05:36,210 --> 00:05:40,440
farm you're tying the collateral that

137
00:05:38,310 --> 00:05:42,750
you offer up to the financial health of

138
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,480
your poultry farm and your collateral is

139
00:05:42,750 --> 00:05:47,880
at risk to the financial problems of

140
00:05:45,480 --> 00:05:50,490
your poultry farm so for example we

141
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:52,890
talked about personal homes may be used

142
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:55,590
as collateral so you would be tying your

143
00:05:52,890 --> 00:05:59,550
personal home to your poaching farm and

144
00:05:55,590 --> 00:06:01,650
if you default on your poultry loan you

145
00:05:59,550 --> 00:06:03,810
may be required to forfeit your personal

146
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:05,910
home so that's something very important

147
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:10,530
to consider before offering them your

148
00:06:05,910 --> 00:06:12,210
personal homeless collateral okay so

149
00:06:10,530 --> 00:06:14,340
it's important that you know your

150
00:06:12,210 --> 00:06:15,660
contract before you borrow for it now

151
00:06:14,340 --> 00:06:17,400
this is your contract with your

152
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:18,930
integrator your poultry contract and

153
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:21,330
here are some questions that you should

154
00:06:18,930 --> 00:06:23,850
ask about your contract before borrowing

155
00:06:21,330 --> 00:06:27,060
money against it what is the length of

156
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:29,070
your contract is it flock to flock so

157
00:06:27,060 --> 00:06:31,740
for example do you have a three-year

158
00:06:29,070 --> 00:06:33,510
flock to flock contract what does that

159
00:06:31,740 --> 00:06:35,700
mean does that mean that you're only

160
00:06:33,510 --> 00:06:38,040
going to receive you're only guaranteed

161
00:06:35,700 --> 00:06:40,470
to receive birds on a flock to flock

162
00:06:38,040 --> 00:06:41,370
basis meaning that they can terminate

163
00:06:40,470 --> 00:06:43,320
your contract

164
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:45,630
anytime within three years or you

165
00:06:43,320 --> 00:06:47,340
guaranteed to receive X number of flocks

166
00:06:45,630 --> 00:06:49,169
for a year within that three years

167
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:53,520
that's all going to be contained in your

168
00:06:49,169 --> 00:06:55,290
contract also what are the rights with

169
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:57,780
your company if your determine if your

170
00:06:55,290 --> 00:06:59,370
contract is terminated what are the

171
00:06:57,780 --> 00:07:02,100
reasons that your contract could be

172
00:06:59,370 --> 00:07:05,010
terminated often there will be language

173
00:07:02,100 --> 00:07:08,250
in there contracted outlines how and why

174
00:07:05,010 --> 00:07:11,070
your contract may be terminated how does

175
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:14,070
your company handle housing upgrades our

176
00:07:11,070 --> 00:07:16,190
disputes handled by your company those

177
00:07:14,070 --> 00:07:18,840
should all be included in there

178
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:23,630
typically speaking contracts may include

179
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:27,330
language that says upgrades can be

180
00:07:23,630 --> 00:07:30,000
required kind of at will by the company

181
00:07:27,330 --> 00:07:32,789
so they make the determination when an

182
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,340
upgrade is required it's important that

183
00:07:32,789 --> 00:07:38,100
you understand how you're paid do you

184
00:07:35,340 --> 00:07:41,090
does your contract including guaranteed

185
00:07:38,100 --> 00:07:45,750
pay are you ranked in a tournament and

186
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:48,120
then is your density your flock numbers

187
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:50,220
your target weight everything related to

188
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,070
your flock of birds guaranteed in your

189
00:07:50,220 --> 00:07:54,810
contract does the company have the

190
00:07:53,070 --> 00:07:58,440
ability to change your density or change

191
00:07:54,810 --> 00:08:00,930
your target weight without notifying you

192
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:03,840
or do they have to notify you how much

193
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:06,300
time do they are they required to notify

194
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:10,440
you by questions like this and many more

195
00:08:06,300 --> 00:08:15,349
gonna be found in our copy of the FSA

196
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:16,530
guide and that's gonna be in Appendix C

197
00:08:15,349 --> 00:08:18,479
all right

198
00:08:16,530 --> 00:08:20,099
so tournament pay in your mortgage

199
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,050
payment so just so that everyone

200
00:08:20,099 --> 00:08:24,120
understands tournament pay is an

201
00:08:22,050 --> 00:08:26,430
incentive that's used by integrators to

202
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:28,740
encourage peak performance amongst their

203
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:32,279
contract farmers and how it works is

204
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:34,200
that under this model farms would flock

205
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:36,479
being processed during the same week of

206
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:38,789
ranks amongst each other according to

207
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:41,459
integrator cost per pound and that

208
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:43,740
becomes your tournament once your

209
00:08:41,459 --> 00:08:46,770
tournament is established farmers

210
00:08:43,740 --> 00:08:49,280
performance are rated above or below the

211
00:08:46,770 --> 00:08:52,470
average and that determines their in pay

212
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:54,830
so farmers that are underperforming the

213
00:08:52,470 --> 00:08:58,130
average will have their pay reduced mean

214
00:08:54,830 --> 00:09:01,160
farmers who have a higher cost to the

215
00:08:58,130 --> 00:09:03,140
company will be lower ranked ranked

216
00:09:01,160 --> 00:09:06,100
below the average and will have their

217
00:09:03,140 --> 00:09:08,630
pay reduced while farmers that produce

218
00:09:06,100 --> 00:09:11,209
cheaper than the company average will be

219
00:09:08,630 --> 00:09:14,029
ranked higher and will have a bonus

220
00:09:11,209 --> 00:09:16,160
added to their pay this means that your

221
00:09:14,029 --> 00:09:18,399
pay can fluctuate greatly from one flock

222
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,720
to the next where is your cost

223
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,660
specifically your mortgage payment your

224
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,430
loan payment will remain the same

225
00:09:22,660 --> 00:09:26,899
regardless of what you're being paid so

226
00:09:25,430 --> 00:09:29,450
it's essential to consider that the

227
00:09:26,899 --> 00:09:31,610
average pay estimate may not be

228
00:09:29,450 --> 00:09:34,160
representative of what your actual pay

229
00:09:31,610 --> 00:09:40,910
will be you could earn higher but you

230
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:43,519
could also earn lower so it's always

231
00:09:40,910 --> 00:09:45,620
good to estimate your cash flow and be

232
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:49,190
very realistic on how you estimate your

233
00:09:45,620 --> 00:09:52,010
cash flow here in this slide you'll see

234
00:09:49,190 --> 00:09:54,200
that we have some company estimates

235
00:09:52,010 --> 00:09:56,720
listed on the right and some farmer

236
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:58,490
estimates listed on the left so you'll

237
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:02,870
notice that the estimated cost of

238
00:09:58,490 --> 00:10:03,709
building four houses is the same 966

239
00:10:02,870 --> 00:10:06,430
thousand dollars

240
00:10:03,709 --> 00:10:08,600
the estimated gross income is the same

241
00:10:06,430 --> 00:10:11,420
roughly a hundred sixty four thousand

242
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:13,910
dollars the estimated loan payment is

243
00:10:11,420 --> 00:10:16,310
the same about ninety four thousand

244
00:10:13,910 --> 00:10:18,500
dollars in change whereas the estimated

245
00:10:16,310 --> 00:10:20,420
farmer costs are much different the

246
00:10:18,500 --> 00:10:22,190
company estimates thirty six thousand

247
00:10:20,420 --> 00:10:24,470
dollars whereas farmers that we

248
00:10:22,190 --> 00:10:26,420
consulted with and our current poultry

249
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:29,540
farmers estimate closer to eighty

250
00:10:26,420 --> 00:10:30,950
thousand dollars so how is this

251
00:10:29,540 --> 00:10:35,240
different and why is it different

252
00:10:30,950 --> 00:10:38,000
well the expenses that the company lists

253
00:10:35,240 --> 00:10:39,680
are listed on the left in the expenses

254
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,320
that our farmers have included are

255
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:45,079
listed on the right now just so that

256
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:49,520
everyone understands every cost that the

257
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:51,320
company estimates here farmers also do

258
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:52,910
include but there are additional cost

259
00:10:51,320 --> 00:10:55,070
that the farmers have include that they

260
00:10:52,910 --> 00:10:58,220
know they have to pay based on their own

261
00:10:55,070 --> 00:11:00,980
experience and all of these figures can

262
00:10:58,220 --> 00:11:04,790
be found in our guide as well you can

263
00:11:00,980 --> 00:11:06,649
refer to section C for many more cash

264
00:11:04,790 --> 00:11:08,149
flow estimates just to give you a better

265
00:11:06,649 --> 00:11:09,649
eye

266
00:11:08,149 --> 00:11:12,079
but you'll notice that we've included

267
00:11:09,649 --> 00:11:13,819
the electric bill the insurance bill the

268
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,769
bill for cleaning out the bill for

269
00:11:13,819 --> 00:11:17,990
pressed out through property taxes and

270
00:11:15,769 --> 00:11:20,389
that totals down to thirty six thousand

271
00:11:17,990 --> 00:11:22,399
four hundred dollars but in that there's

272
00:11:20,389 --> 00:11:24,499
additional costs for example heating

273
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:26,809
fuel the cost to fill your house with

274
00:11:24,499 --> 00:11:28,610
shavings especially if this is a new

275
00:11:26,809 --> 00:11:32,600
poultry operation or you've had to do a

276
00:11:28,610 --> 00:11:35,480
clean-out down to the bare ground

277
00:11:32,600 --> 00:11:38,360
you also have equipment fuel for fueling

278
00:11:35,480 --> 00:11:39,499
your generators or maybe your digesters

279
00:11:38,360 --> 00:11:42,470
or something like that that you have

280
00:11:39,499 --> 00:11:45,110
around the property equipment repairs

281
00:11:42,470 --> 00:11:47,059
this could be to any of your equipment

282
00:11:45,110 --> 00:11:48,679
necessary to run the operation like a

283
00:11:47,059 --> 00:11:50,990
cake out machine or something like that

284
00:11:48,679 --> 00:11:53,240
and then you also have hired labor in

285
00:11:50,990 --> 00:11:57,160
there most farmers that we talk to do

286
00:11:53,240 --> 00:11:59,600
have at least one hired person on hand

287
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,579
to help them with their operation and

288
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,499
that's where the difference is and so

289
00:12:01,579 --> 00:12:12,350
you can you know compare and contrast

290
00:12:03,499 --> 00:12:15,740
these two different cost analysis okay

291
00:12:12,350 --> 00:12:18,230
so now we're going to discuss basic FSA

292
00:12:15,740 --> 00:12:20,360
loan eligibility so these are the steps

293
00:12:18,230 --> 00:12:22,730
to do before you've applied so before

294
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:25,279
applying you need to seek financing with

295
00:12:22,730 --> 00:12:27,470
traditional lenders the FSA eligibility

296
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,939
process starts with exploring financing

297
00:12:27,470 --> 00:12:33,170
option with traditional lenders like

298
00:12:28,939 --> 00:12:36,439
Farm Credit Bank are crazy if you are

299
00:12:33,170 --> 00:12:38,899
unable to secure financing at reasonable

300
00:12:36,439 --> 00:12:42,799
rates and terms then you may be eligible

301
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:44,540
for an FSA loan so of course you have to

302
00:12:42,799 --> 00:12:48,470
start by first applying to Farm Credit

303
00:12:44,540 --> 00:12:50,779
before applying directly to FSA now to

304
00:12:48,470 --> 00:12:53,449
get started with an FSA application you

305
00:12:50,779 --> 00:12:55,549
need to first have your farm number so

306
00:12:53,449 --> 00:12:56,839
to be considered for a loan you must

307
00:12:55,549 --> 00:12:59,269
demonstrate you are authorized to

308
00:12:56,839 --> 00:13:01,189
operate your farm where it is located so

309
00:12:59,269 --> 00:13:03,319
you would visit your local FSA office

310
00:13:01,189 --> 00:13:05,809
with a copy of your lease your rental

311
00:13:03,319 --> 00:13:07,699
agreement or proof of ownership and then

312
00:13:05,809 --> 00:13:10,970
they would assist you in registering and

313
00:13:07,699 --> 00:13:12,709
receiving your FSA farm number there are

314
00:13:10,970 --> 00:13:14,929
a couple of conditions with this for

315
00:13:12,709 --> 00:13:16,549
certain FSA loans your loan officer may

316
00:13:14,929 --> 00:13:19,339
require that you complete a borrower

317
00:13:16,549 --> 00:13:20,360
training course within two years of

318
00:13:19,339 --> 00:13:23,000
closing the loan

319
00:13:20,360 --> 00:13:26,120
your loan funds must be used within the

320
00:13:23,000 --> 00:13:28,730
United States and then certain loan

321
00:13:26,120 --> 00:13:31,910
requirements may exceed the lending

322
00:13:28,730 --> 00:13:33,649
limits of FSA in that case you the

323
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:35,420
borrower must be able to secure the

324
00:13:33,649 --> 00:13:39,019
remaining financing from another source

325
00:13:35,420 --> 00:13:41,779
so for example if the FSA loan limit on

326
00:13:39,019 --> 00:13:44,540
a particular program is 300,000 and you

327
00:13:41,779 --> 00:13:47,120
need $400,000 you would need to secure

328
00:13:44,540 --> 00:13:53,029
the additional $100,000 from a separate

329
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:56,209
lender not FSA okay so here are some

330
00:13:53,029 --> 00:13:58,730
different notes on FSA loans one is the

331
00:13:56,209 --> 00:14:01,970
hundred and fifty percent rule so on all

332
00:13:58,730 --> 00:14:03,170
direct FSA loans have a security

333
00:14:01,970 --> 00:14:04,670
requirement of at least one hundred

334
00:14:03,170 --> 00:14:08,029
percent of the loan amount

335
00:14:04,670 --> 00:14:11,269
however FSA will require applicants to

336
00:14:08,029 --> 00:14:14,510
provide collateral up to 150% of the

337
00:14:11,269 --> 00:14:16,760
loan amount if it is available in this

338
00:14:14,510 --> 00:14:20,510
loan this rule specifically applies to

339
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:22,519
FSA Direct Loans only so for example if

340
00:14:20,510 --> 00:14:25,390
you're borrowing $300,000 to upgrade

341
00:14:22,519 --> 00:14:28,010
your poultry farm you may be required to

342
00:14:25,390 --> 00:14:30,560
offer an additional hundred and fifty

343
00:14:28,010 --> 00:14:32,149
thousand dollars in collateral meaning

344
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:35,029
your poultry farm and other collateral

345
00:14:32,149 --> 00:14:38,149
like equipment of personal home could be

346
00:14:35,029 --> 00:14:39,470
required as collateral there are some

347
00:14:38,149 --> 00:14:41,690
exceptions to the hundred and fifty

348
00:14:39,470 --> 00:14:44,089
percent rule for example if the asset

349
00:14:41,690 --> 00:14:47,899
necessary like your tractor other

350
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:49,940
equipment shadow-like other type of

351
00:14:47,899 --> 00:14:52,220
breeding stock or cattle something like

352
00:14:49,940 --> 00:14:54,230
that if those are necessary to secure

353
00:14:52,220 --> 00:14:57,199
credit elsewhere for farming operations

354
00:14:54,230 --> 00:14:59,269
they may be accepted also your personal

355
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,250
home your household contents your

356
00:14:59,269 --> 00:15:03,019
personal vehicles they can also be

357
00:15:01,250 --> 00:15:04,940
exempt from the hundred fifty percent

358
00:15:03,019 --> 00:15:07,940
rule however your home must be on a

359
00:15:04,940 --> 00:15:10,880
separate parcel land so if your home is

360
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:14,300
on the exact same parcel as your farm

361
00:15:10,880 --> 00:15:16,160
then it may not be exempt also working

362
00:15:14,300 --> 00:15:18,949
capital accounts like your bank account

363
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:22,370
and retirement accounts like your 401k

364
00:15:18,949 --> 00:15:24,890
pensions those mounts will be exempt for

365
00:15:22,370 --> 00:15:26,600
guaranteed loans the FSA reviews the

366
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:29,089
collateral proposed and available and

367
00:15:26,600 --> 00:15:31,100
requires the lenders to secure the lawn

368
00:15:29,089 --> 00:15:33,399
to the satisfaction of both FSA and the

369
00:15:31,100 --> 00:15:33,399
lender

370
00:15:33,559 --> 00:15:37,470
Benni would you like to speak on that a

371
00:15:35,790 --> 00:15:39,509
little bit more does that mean that they

372
00:15:37,470 --> 00:15:41,639
have a little more flexibility with how

373
00:15:39,509 --> 00:15:45,300
much collateral is required for a

374
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:51,509
guaranteed loan the lender is the lender

375
00:15:45,300 --> 00:15:54,600
is advised and able to use what they

376
00:15:51,509 --> 00:15:57,839
would do to another applicant that is

377
00:15:54,600 --> 00:16:02,389
not here to mean so that sometimes goes

378
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:02,389
beyond what FSA's requirements are

379
00:16:03,559 --> 00:16:09,480
excellent so in that particular case as

380
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:11,069
Benny said your individual lender may

381
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:13,429
have additional flexibility so that's

382
00:16:11,069 --> 00:16:16,829
just something to keep in mind as well

383
00:16:13,429 --> 00:16:18,959
okay so here are some basic types of

384
00:16:16,829 --> 00:16:21,449
farm loans that are available from FSA

385
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:22,679
there are other type of loans but we're

386
00:16:21,449 --> 00:16:24,569
only going to discuss these three

387
00:16:22,679 --> 00:16:26,670
because these are the three primary ones

388
00:16:24,569 --> 00:16:28,790
that most people use again you have a

389
00:16:26,670 --> 00:16:31,829
farm ownership loan like we discussed

390
00:16:28,790 --> 00:16:34,050
those may only be used to buy or enlarge

391
00:16:31,829 --> 00:16:36,329
a farm make a down payment on a farm

392
00:16:34,050 --> 00:16:38,279
make structure improvements on a farm

393
00:16:36,329 --> 00:16:40,019
like building a building or structure

394
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:42,600
something of that nature or other

395
00:16:40,019 --> 00:16:45,660
brick-and-mortar projects now you have

396
00:16:42,600 --> 00:16:47,699
an operating loan and that's a loan to

397
00:16:45,660 --> 00:16:49,970
cover necessary expenses associated with

398
00:16:47,699 --> 00:16:52,290
improving the profitability of your farm

399
00:16:49,970 --> 00:16:54,360
according to the FSA description an

400
00:16:52,290 --> 00:16:56,339
operating loan will help you purchase

401
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,410
livestock and equipment and pay for

402
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:01,410
minor real estate repairs and annual

403
00:16:58,410 --> 00:17:04,049
operating expenses you also have an

404
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:06,809
emergency loan and that according to the

405
00:17:04,049 --> 00:17:08,760
FSA description is a loan that will help

406
00:17:06,809 --> 00:17:10,829
you if you suffered a qualifying loss

407
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:12,020
caused by a natural disaster that

408
00:17:10,829 --> 00:17:15,720
damaged your farming or ranching

409
00:17:12,020 --> 00:17:18,809
operation you can find more details on

410
00:17:15,720 --> 00:17:21,270
these three most common types of loan in

411
00:17:18,809 --> 00:17:23,189
included in the FSA guide or you're

412
00:17:21,270 --> 00:17:26,520
welcome to contact your local FSA office

413
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:29,039
also there's also conservation loans

414
00:17:26,520 --> 00:17:32,010
micro loans and other types of loans but

415
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:33,570
again it's best to contact your local

416
00:17:32,010 --> 00:17:37,590
FSA office if you have additional

417
00:17:33,570 --> 00:17:39,990
questions about those types of loans all

418
00:17:37,590 --> 00:17:43,049
right so we're going to discuss

419
00:17:39,990 --> 00:17:45,419
eligibility for Direct Loans so

420
00:17:43,049 --> 00:17:47,190
under direct loan you have a farm

421
00:17:45,419 --> 00:17:49,619
ownership loan you have an operating

422
00:17:47,190 --> 00:17:51,179
loan you have a emergency one all three

423
00:17:49,619 --> 00:17:54,110
of the types of loans we discussed

424
00:17:51,179 --> 00:17:56,639
previously but your loan limit is

425
00:17:54,110 --> 00:17:58,919
$300,000 and if we remember from earlier

426
00:17:56,639 --> 00:18:01,590
this is the type of loan where FSA is

427
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,749
the one directly loaning you $300,000

428
00:18:01,590 --> 00:18:06,960
and they're also the one that will be

429
00:18:03,749 --> 00:18:09,830
servicing that $3,000 so your general

430
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:12,269
general eligibility requirements are

431
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,340
have the training education or

432
00:18:12,269 --> 00:18:17,070
experience to effectively manage a farm

433
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:19,559
or ranch you must be a US citizen a

434
00:18:17,070 --> 00:18:22,139
nonsense and national or qualified alien

435
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,269
you must possess the legal capacity to

436
00:18:22,139 --> 00:18:25,919
obtain a loan you must not have a

437
00:18:24,269 --> 00:18:26,549
conviction related to a controlled

438
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:29,369
substance

439
00:18:26,549 --> 00:18:31,289
you must be unable to obtain credit

440
00:18:29,369 --> 00:18:34,259
elsewhere at reasonable rates and Terms

441
00:18:31,289 --> 00:18:35,700
if you remember a few slides back we

442
00:18:34,259 --> 00:18:39,389
mentioned that you first need to start

443
00:18:35,700 --> 00:18:41,700
by applying for financing with a non FSA

444
00:18:39,389 --> 00:18:43,259
lender and then if you're unable to find

445
00:18:41,700 --> 00:18:45,179
those reasonable rates and terms that's

446
00:18:43,259 --> 00:18:46,700
when you would turn the FSA so that's

447
00:18:45,179 --> 00:18:49,049
what that eligibility requirement means

448
00:18:46,700 --> 00:18:51,690
also you must be able to demonstrate

449
00:18:49,049 --> 00:18:54,090
good credit history or if you're unable

450
00:18:51,690 --> 00:18:55,830
to demonstrate good credit history you

451
00:18:54,090 --> 00:18:57,840
need to show that that that the

452
00:18:55,830 --> 00:18:59,609
incidences were beyond were due to

453
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:01,859
circumstances beyond your control

454
00:18:59,609 --> 00:19:05,429
they were infrequent or they were not

455
00:19:01,859 --> 00:19:08,369
recent you must not have had a recent

456
00:19:05,429 --> 00:19:10,019
foreclosure or business failure you must

457
00:19:08,369 --> 00:19:12,450
be able to show that your farm is a

458
00:19:10,019 --> 00:19:14,519
family farm or ranch and the majority of

459
00:19:12,450 --> 00:19:16,950
the physical labor and management is

460
00:19:14,519 --> 00:19:20,759
provided by you a family member or

461
00:19:16,950 --> 00:19:23,309
another entity member you must not have

462
00:19:20,759 --> 00:19:26,609
received debt forgiveness on another FSA

463
00:19:23,309 --> 00:19:28,200
direct or guaranteed loan and you must

464
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:30,239
not be behind on any debt to the

465
00:19:28,200 --> 00:19:33,570
government when the long closes with

466
00:19:30,239 --> 00:19:35,580
certain exceptions if you have questions

467
00:19:33,570 --> 00:19:41,850
about those exceptions please contact

468
00:19:35,580 --> 00:19:43,200
your local FSA agent okay so now we're

469
00:19:41,850 --> 00:19:45,450
going to discuss eligibility for

470
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,850
guaranteed loans so under a guaranteed

471
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,230
loan we have farm ownership loans we

472
00:19:47,850 --> 00:19:52,080
have operating loans we have

473
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,090
conservation loans and the loan limit

474
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,600
for that is generally 1 million three

475
00:19:54,090 --> 00:19:57,809
hundred

476
00:19:54,600 --> 00:20:00,870
9,000 that's adjusted annually so for

477
00:19:57,809 --> 00:20:03,510
example it went up from 2016 but it may

478
00:20:00,870 --> 00:20:04,710
be adjusted you know down in 2018 so

479
00:20:03,510 --> 00:20:08,280
that's always something to check out

480
00:20:04,710 --> 00:20:09,480
with your local FSA age so the

481
00:20:08,280 --> 00:20:11,460
eligibility requirements for a

482
00:20:09,480 --> 00:20:13,740
guaranteed loan are that you're a US

483
00:20:11,460 --> 00:20:16,500
citizen a non sis and national or

484
00:20:13,740 --> 00:20:19,020
qualify datum you must possess the legal

485
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:21,450
capacity to obtain a loan you are unable

486
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:24,270
to find a lender willing to approve your

487
00:20:21,450 --> 00:20:27,360
loan with reasonable terms and rates

488
00:20:24,270 --> 00:20:29,820
without a guarantee you must not have

489
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:32,700
received debt forgiveness on another FSA

490
00:20:29,820 --> 00:20:34,500
direct or guaranteed loan you must be

491
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:36,419
able to show that your farm is a family

492
00:20:34,500 --> 00:20:38,480
farm or ranch and the majority of the

493
00:20:36,419 --> 00:20:40,980
physical labor and management is

494
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:44,039
provided by you a family member or

495
00:20:40,980 --> 00:20:46,169
another entity member and you must not

496
00:20:44,039 --> 00:20:49,980
be behind on any debt owed to the US

497
00:20:46,169 --> 00:20:53,120
government after the loan closes there's

498
00:20:49,980 --> 00:20:56,520
also some additional security

499
00:20:53,120 --> 00:21:00,690
requirements on FSA guaranteed loans so

500
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:02,610
in some cases if you use chattel as the

501
00:21:00,690 --> 00:21:05,549
security on more than one loan for a

502
00:21:02,610 --> 00:21:08,070
guaranteed loan you may be able to do so

503
00:21:05,549 --> 00:21:10,140
for a guaranteed loan but you would need

504
00:21:08,070 --> 00:21:14,030
to consult your individual lender if

505
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:17,340
that's an option for you so for example

506
00:21:14,030 --> 00:21:19,440
you may be able to use breeding stock or

507
00:21:17,340 --> 00:21:22,590
equipment across as collateral across

508
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:24,150
two different loans Benny can you think

509
00:21:22,590 --> 00:21:27,860
of a situation where that may apply sir

510
00:21:24,150 --> 00:21:27,860
that would apply if your

511
00:21:33,990 --> 00:21:42,119
agree this you can use your channels can

512
00:21:38,789 --> 00:21:45,419
be if you are getting two loans you

513
00:21:42,119 --> 00:21:48,119
needed a operating loan and you needed

514
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:51,259
another loan your channel actually can

515
00:21:48,119 --> 00:21:52,529
be used as collateral in both instances

516
00:21:51,259 --> 00:21:58,470
okay

517
00:21:52,529 --> 00:22:00,690
excellent let's see so we want you to

518
00:21:58,470 --> 00:22:02,070
understand your loan terms in order to

519
00:22:00,690 --> 00:22:05,009
do that you need to understand the

520
00:22:02,070 --> 00:22:07,230
terminology used in loans so for example

521
00:22:05,009 --> 00:22:09,860
when we say loan terms we mean the

522
00:22:07,230 --> 00:22:12,119
number of payments the interest rate and

523
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:14,639
obligations stipulated by your loan

524
00:22:12,119 --> 00:22:16,740
agreement your interest rate is the

525
00:22:14,639 --> 00:22:19,379
proportion of a loan charge as interest

526
00:22:16,740 --> 00:22:21,779
to you the borrower the interest is the

527
00:22:19,379 --> 00:22:24,269
money paid regularly at a particular

528
00:22:21,779 --> 00:22:26,610
rate for money lent or for delaying the

529
00:22:24,269 --> 00:22:30,269
repayment of debt and this may be fixed

530
00:22:26,610 --> 00:22:31,649
or floating a fixed interest rate is an

531
00:22:30,269 --> 00:22:34,049
interest rate that remains the same

532
00:22:31,649 --> 00:22:37,139
throughout the life of the loan whereas

533
00:22:34,049 --> 00:22:39,029
a floating interest rate is an interest

534
00:22:37,139 --> 00:22:40,860
rate that is subject to change over the

535
00:22:39,029 --> 00:22:42,990
life of the loan and that's also known

536
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:45,690
as a variable interest rate so most of

537
00:22:42,990 --> 00:22:47,429
you have probably heard of fixed

538
00:22:45,690 --> 00:22:49,980
interest rates and variable interest

539
00:22:47,429 --> 00:22:52,950
rates now a floating interest rate may

540
00:22:49,980 --> 00:22:55,289
be initially lower than a fixed rate but

541
00:22:52,950 --> 00:22:57,480
could increase over time and that could

542
00:22:55,289 --> 00:23:00,570
have significant consequences for you

543
00:22:57,480 --> 00:23:03,570
repaying your loan ie a much higher loan

544
00:23:00,570 --> 00:23:06,029
payment in the future a longer term will

545
00:23:03,570 --> 00:23:08,309
lower your monthly payment amount but

546
00:23:06,029 --> 00:23:11,490
they will result in more interest being

547
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:14,340
paid over the life of the law so while

548
00:23:11,490 --> 00:23:16,619
having longer terms will increase your

549
00:23:14,340 --> 00:23:18,749
ability to pay on a monthly basis by

550
00:23:16,619 --> 00:23:21,809
having a lower term lower payment amount

551
00:23:18,749 --> 00:23:23,580
you will overall end up repaying more

552
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:26,249
for that loan because you've stretched

553
00:23:23,580 --> 00:23:28,200
your terms out over a longer time it's

554
00:23:26,249 --> 00:23:30,389
critically important that you discuss

555
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,789
these loan terms and rates with your FSA

556
00:23:30,389 --> 00:23:35,220
or your loan officer to select the

557
00:23:32,789 --> 00:23:37,139
option that works best for you and you

558
00:23:35,220 --> 00:23:40,519
should consider how your loan terms will

559
00:23:37,139 --> 00:23:43,200
affect your ability to repay your loan

560
00:23:40,519 --> 00:23:45,980
as well as affect what's your monthly

561
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:45,980
loan payment will be

562
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:54,790
so loan terms and lenders which are best

563
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:56,620
for you so we I want to discuss balloon

564
00:23:54,790 --> 00:23:58,240
loans and payments because a lot of

565
00:23:56,620 --> 00:24:01,660
times those come into play with poultry

566
00:23:58,240 --> 00:24:03,280
loans so in a balloon loan your initial

567
00:24:01,660 --> 00:24:05,830
terms for the loan typically the first

568
00:24:03,280 --> 00:24:09,910
four years have a relatively manageable

569
00:24:05,830 --> 00:24:12,250
payment in fixed interest rate however

570
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:14,220
after the initial three period the loan

571
00:24:12,250 --> 00:24:18,100
will become due in one very large

572
00:24:14,220 --> 00:24:20,200
balloon payment hence the name for you

573
00:24:18,100 --> 00:24:21,970
know this type of loan if you're unable

574
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:24,490
to make the balloon payment then your

575
00:24:21,970 --> 00:24:26,920
lender may renew your loan for another

576
00:24:24,490 --> 00:24:30,070
balloon mode which would reset your loan

577
00:24:26,920 --> 00:24:32,380
terms with a new interest rate and will

578
00:24:30,070 --> 00:24:34,330
include some fees however there is no

579
00:24:32,380 --> 00:24:36,700
guarantee that your lender will renew

580
00:24:34,330 --> 00:24:39,700
your loan after the balloon payment is

581
00:24:36,700 --> 00:24:43,320
due balloon loans are riskier or a

582
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:45,760
riskier repayment option so just because

583
00:24:43,320 --> 00:24:48,580
you know they have renewed your loan

584
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:50,410
once or twice before does not mean that

585
00:24:48,580 --> 00:24:52,840
they will renew it a third time and

586
00:24:50,410 --> 00:24:55,900
there's no obligation for them to renew

587
00:24:52,840 --> 00:24:57,550
that loan there's no obligation for them

588
00:24:55,900 --> 00:25:00,430
to give you the same terms as in your

589
00:24:57,550 --> 00:25:01,840
previous balloon note so just keep that

590
00:25:00,430 --> 00:25:03,420
in mind when you're considering whether

591
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:08,500
or not you want to take a balloon loan

592
00:25:03,420 --> 00:25:11,380
out on your poultry farm now for FSA for

593
00:25:08,500 --> 00:25:13,330
guaranteed loans the lenders FSA ranking

594
00:25:11,380 --> 00:25:17,620
will influence their application process

595
00:25:13,330 --> 00:25:19,390
so under the FSA Lindner rankings you

596
00:25:17,620 --> 00:25:22,570
have three different rankings a

597
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:25,090
preferred lender is the highest FSA

598
00:25:22,570 --> 00:25:27,150
ranked lender and therefore has the most

599
00:25:25,090 --> 00:25:30,720
flexibility in their application process

600
00:25:27,150 --> 00:25:35,980
this means they may not require you to

601
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:38,080
go through some of the initial

602
00:25:35,980 --> 00:25:41,050
application stages that other lenders

603
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:42,820
would have you be required to do so so a

604
00:25:41,050 --> 00:25:45,850
certified lender is the second highest

605
00:25:42,820 --> 00:25:48,100
FSA ranked lender and has more

606
00:25:45,850 --> 00:25:50,740
flexibility in their application process

607
00:25:48,100 --> 00:25:52,990
than a standard lender but less than a

608
00:25:50,740 --> 00:25:55,660
preferred them and then standard is the

609
00:25:52,990 --> 00:25:58,730
basic FSA ranking and has the least Lex

610
00:25:55,660 --> 00:26:01,309
ability in their application process

611
00:25:58,730 --> 00:26:05,150
again your local FSA office can come

612
00:26:01,309 --> 00:26:12,409
provide a complete list of lenders as

613
00:26:05,150 --> 00:26:15,529
well as their FSA lender ranking so the

614
00:26:12,409 --> 00:26:17,090
FSA loan application process the

615
00:26:15,529 --> 00:26:20,120
application process we've broken down

616
00:26:17,090 --> 00:26:22,190
into ten general steps the first one

617
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:25,490
would be to obtain a contract or letter

618
00:26:22,190 --> 00:26:28,240
of intent from your integrator if you're

619
00:26:25,490 --> 00:26:30,230
not going to you're not going to get a

620
00:26:28,240 --> 00:26:32,750
contract from your company there's no

621
00:26:30,230 --> 00:26:34,429
reason to apply for financing you then

622
00:26:32,750 --> 00:26:36,919
need to consult your company for the

623
00:26:34,429 --> 00:26:39,470
proposed housing layout generally your

624
00:26:36,919 --> 00:26:41,179
company knows where they want houses to

625
00:26:39,470 --> 00:26:43,669
be laid out on your land and they have a

626
00:26:41,179 --> 00:26:46,010
very specific idea of it and they'll

627
00:26:43,669 --> 00:26:47,720
tell you right away that's important for

628
00:26:46,010 --> 00:26:50,240
your environmental pre-screen or

629
00:26:47,720 --> 00:26:52,070
assessment so depending on where your

630
00:26:50,240 --> 00:26:54,649
houses are going that's going to affect

631
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:56,299
if you need to do a pre-screen or an

632
00:26:54,649 --> 00:26:58,190
assessment it's also going to affect

633
00:26:56,299 --> 00:27:00,200
whether you need to do in a historic

634
00:26:58,190 --> 00:27:02,779
preservation pre-screen or assessment

635
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:06,350
and then whether or not you need to do

636
00:27:02,779 --> 00:27:08,090
fish and wildlife review or not now all

637
00:27:06,350 --> 00:27:11,419
poultry farmers will be required to

638
00:27:08,090 --> 00:27:13,309
submit a concert comprehensive nutrient

639
00:27:11,419 --> 00:27:16,669
management plan otherwise known as a

640
00:27:13,309 --> 00:27:18,740
waste management plan you're also going

641
00:27:16,669 --> 00:27:20,149
to need to submit a plan for your

642
00:27:18,740 --> 00:27:23,240
repayment ability and your farm

643
00:27:20,149 --> 00:27:25,399
operating plan that's essentially your

644
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:27,350
farm business plan demonstrating how

645
00:27:25,399 --> 00:27:31,070
you're going to repay the proposed

646
00:27:27,350 --> 00:27:33,470
amounts that you are refunding you also

647
00:27:31,070 --> 00:27:35,330
need to submit your security requirement

648
00:27:33,470 --> 00:27:38,000
so that's going to be what your

649
00:27:35,330 --> 00:27:40,159
collateral be worth and what collateral

650
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:42,710
you are submitting so generally speaking

651
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:44,929
that would be a property assessment

652
00:27:42,710 --> 00:27:46,789
something like that and then you'll go

653
00:27:44,929 --> 00:27:48,770
through the approval process that's once

654
00:27:46,789 --> 00:27:51,140
all your applications have been

655
00:27:48,770 --> 00:27:52,880
submitted all documentation now FSA has

656
00:27:51,140 --> 00:27:55,340
your complete application and they'll

657
00:27:52,880 --> 00:27:57,080
review it and we're going to go on next

658
00:27:55,340 --> 00:28:04,130
to what you do if your application is

659
00:27:57,080 --> 00:28:05,840
denied or change okay so first we'll

660
00:28:04,130 --> 00:28:07,730
cover what to do if your loan is denied

661
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:09,409
or chained because if your loan is

662
00:28:07,730 --> 00:28:10,909
approved you move forward with

663
00:28:09,409 --> 00:28:11,680
construction and getting into poultry

664
00:28:10,909 --> 00:28:13,570
that

665
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:15,670
is pretty straightforward now if your

666
00:28:13,570 --> 00:28:18,720
loan is denied you may appeal the

667
00:28:15,670 --> 00:28:21,610
decision it's important to note that

668
00:28:18,720 --> 00:28:24,250
decisions may be appealed but not

669
00:28:21,610 --> 00:28:26,920
regulations Benny do you want to talk

670
00:28:24,250 --> 00:28:29,050
and talk speak on that sir and

671
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:31,180
distinguish what does it mean when we

672
00:28:29,050 --> 00:28:33,100
say that your decision may not be

673
00:28:31,180 --> 00:28:36,550
appealed or your decision may be

674
00:28:33,100 --> 00:28:39,040
appealed but not the regulations what

675
00:28:36,550 --> 00:28:42,280
the what the rules say is that any

676
00:28:39,040 --> 00:28:46,090
adverse decision is appealed and even

677
00:28:42,280 --> 00:28:49,480
the FSA said may send you a little bit

678
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:52,360
since it's not a people that is an

679
00:28:49,480 --> 00:28:55,960
adverse decision and he self is appeal

680
00:28:52,360 --> 00:29:00,160
but in the appeals process you have to

681
00:28:55,960 --> 00:29:03,100
argue from what the rules say you can't

682
00:29:00,160 --> 00:29:05,620
argue that it rules along and when we

683
00:29:03,100 --> 00:29:08,110
say the rules we're specifically saying

684
00:29:05,620 --> 00:29:11,670
rule from the Federal Register order

685
00:29:08,110 --> 00:29:16,510
statute there are interpretations from

686
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:18,870
their own the agency of interpretation

687
00:29:16,510 --> 00:29:22,360
of what the rule says what we have not

688
00:29:18,870 --> 00:29:23,590
so let's discuss just an eligibility

689
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:26,320
requirement that was pretty

690
00:29:23,590 --> 00:29:29,110
straightforward that may kind of sum

691
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:31,870
this up for example if you put in an in

692
00:29:29,110 --> 00:29:34,990
FSA application and you were denied

693
00:29:31,870 --> 00:29:37,300
because you are not a US citizen and you

694
00:29:34,990 --> 00:29:38,890
are not a legal resident you're here on

695
00:29:37,300 --> 00:29:40,690
a visa something of that nature

696
00:29:38,890 --> 00:29:43,090
therefore you are ineligible to receive

697
00:29:40,690 --> 00:29:45,640
this financing now you would not be able

698
00:29:43,090 --> 00:29:48,760
to appeal that decision because the

699
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:51,280
regular the regulation states that you

700
00:29:48,760 --> 00:29:55,000
are ineligible is that that that is

701
00:29:51,280 --> 00:29:58,360
correct and what you run into that is

702
00:29:55,000 --> 00:30:00,070
most of the time that to me is that you

703
00:29:58,360 --> 00:30:02,410
would argue were trying to argue that

704
00:30:00,070 --> 00:30:04,570
you didn't every decision will have a

705
00:30:02,410 --> 00:30:09,570
time specification or that's going to

706
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:14,820
reply in fits just 30 days that's from a

707
00:30:09,570 --> 00:30:18,250
regulation hmm and missing that

708
00:30:14,820 --> 00:30:20,980
terminates your eligibility and that's

709
00:30:18,250 --> 00:30:23,590
into the rules so you

710
00:30:20,980 --> 00:30:26,289
that's a regulation you can't

711
00:30:23,590 --> 00:30:28,799
they can't change that I'm glad you

712
00:30:26,289 --> 00:30:30,789
brought that up Betty because that

713
00:30:28,799 --> 00:30:32,980
segues to what we were going to talk

714
00:30:30,789 --> 00:30:35,470
about next is what are the steps if you

715
00:30:32,980 --> 00:30:37,960
want to appeal your decision and as

716
00:30:35,470 --> 00:30:40,179
Benny Ari mentioned those will be time

717
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:41,980
bound so the first one is you may

718
00:30:40,179 --> 00:30:44,520
request a reconsideration meeting

719
00:30:41,980 --> 00:30:46,960
however you have to make that request

720
00:30:44,520 --> 00:30:49,630
within 30 days of receiving your

721
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,970
decision letter now at a reconsideration

722
00:30:49,630 --> 00:30:54,940
meeting they will look at the decision

723
00:30:51,970 --> 00:30:58,059
again and possibly reconsider it in sits

724
00:30:54,940 --> 00:30:59,860
a reconsideration meeting here you would

725
00:30:58,059 --> 00:31:02,880
present information to explain why you

726
00:30:59,860 --> 00:31:07,559
believe the decision was made in error

727
00:31:02,880 --> 00:31:09,970
to our earlier example if for example

728
00:31:07,559 --> 00:31:13,330
you know you were denied because you're

729
00:31:09,970 --> 00:31:17,140
not a US citizen but you are a legal

730
00:31:13,330 --> 00:31:19,539
u.s. alien well you can appeal that you

731
00:31:17,140 --> 00:31:22,000
can say well I thought that I should be

732
00:31:19,539 --> 00:31:25,210
eligible because I am a legal u.s. alien

733
00:31:22,000 --> 00:31:29,140
and it says that I am eligible for the

734
00:31:25,210 --> 00:31:31,270
loan and then the denying loan officer

735
00:31:29,140 --> 00:31:33,850
would you know argue their case on why

736
00:31:31,270 --> 00:31:35,950
they denied the file so you can present

737
00:31:33,850 --> 00:31:38,830
information as to while something was

738
00:31:35,950 --> 00:31:42,399
made in error correct and that goes back

739
00:31:38,830 --> 00:31:45,190
to the 30 days also the point the

740
00:31:42,399 --> 00:31:48,850
appeals man was the natural fear of

741
00:31:45,190 --> 00:31:52,960
division is the agency that handles our

742
00:31:48,850 --> 00:31:56,770
Appeals if they will consider the letter

743
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:59,590
will say when you receive they will they

744
00:31:56,770 --> 00:32:03,370
will all allow up to seven days normally

745
00:31:59,590 --> 00:32:06,039
for May and so you know but you have to

746
00:32:03,370 --> 00:32:08,799
when you appeal you have to put the date

747
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:12,130
that you received it they calculate the

748
00:32:08,799 --> 00:32:15,360
days from that you know for that 30 days

749
00:32:12,130 --> 00:32:17,980
and that's where it becomes regulatory

750
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:21,010
so it's very important that you ensure

751
00:32:17,980 --> 00:32:24,220
that you're moving on a any type of

752
00:32:21,010 --> 00:32:26,950
denial appeal in a very timely manner

753
00:32:24,220 --> 00:32:29,409
and that you also keep track of when

754
00:32:26,950 --> 00:32:31,090
mailings were received and when mailing

755
00:32:29,409 --> 00:32:33,580
or sent off or when you applied for

756
00:32:31,090 --> 00:32:35,650
things so if your decision at your

757
00:32:33,580 --> 00:32:39,160
reconsideration mean does not

758
00:32:35,650 --> 00:32:42,250
then you have an additional 30 days to

759
00:32:39,160 --> 00:32:45,220
request either mediation or to appeal

760
00:32:42,250 --> 00:32:48,250
the FSA decision you may only request

761
00:32:45,220 --> 00:32:52,060
mediation or appeal the decision not

762
00:32:48,250 --> 00:32:54,550
both and you only have 30 days so if you

763
00:32:52,060 --> 00:32:56,320
request mediation a neutral mediator

764
00:32:54,550 --> 00:32:59,140
will help the two parties review the

765
00:32:56,320 --> 00:33:01,150
options and agree on a solution now if

766
00:32:59,140 --> 00:33:03,490
you appeal your decision that is where

767
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:06,040
you will appeal to nan the national

768
00:33:03,490 --> 00:33:08,170
appeal Division as Benny mentioned and

769
00:33:06,040 --> 00:33:10,420
your appeal must be postmarked no later

770
00:33:08,170 --> 00:33:12,940
than 30 days following your decision

771
00:33:10,420 --> 00:33:15,220
letter so that is your decision letter

772
00:33:12,940 --> 00:33:18,310
from your reconsideration meeting not

773
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:20,320
your original decision letter that

774
00:33:18,310 --> 00:33:22,180
appeal would be mailed off to national

775
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,510

776
00:33:22,180 --> 00:33:28,060

clocks

782
00:33:36,670 --> 00:33:42,610
fuck-you 30-day clock stops when you

783
00:33:39,280 --> 00:33:45,910
apply for the mediation but it

784
00:33:42,610 --> 00:33:48,670
immediately kicks in when that mediation

785
00:33:45,910 --> 00:33:51,670
concludes so you don't have an

786
00:33:48,670 --> 00:33:54,700
additional 30 days after mediation it's

787
00:33:51,670 --> 00:33:57,700

788
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:01,840

799
00:34:30,390 --> 00:34:36,270
so an important part of your loan is

800
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,120
fulfilling your loan obligations this

801
00:34:36,270 --> 00:34:40,350
entire time we've been talking about

802
00:34:38,120 --> 00:34:41,730
doing personal assessment before

803
00:34:40,350 --> 00:34:44,400
applying and what the application

804
00:34:41,730 --> 00:34:46,350
process is like but for most of you

805
00:34:44,400 --> 00:34:49,380
you're going to be spending most of your

806
00:34:46,350 --> 00:34:52,290
loan life in refilling sorry fulfilling

807
00:34:49,380 --> 00:34:54,180
your loan obligations this means that

808
00:34:52,290 --> 00:34:57,060
you have been approved for financing you

809
00:34:54,180 --> 00:34:59,660
receive the loan now it's time to repay

810
00:34:57,060 --> 00:35:01,440
it so depending on the type of loan

811
00:34:59,660 --> 00:35:03,210
you're gonna have different

812
00:35:01,440 --> 00:35:05,100
responsibilities during the life of that

813
00:35:03,210 --> 00:35:06,990
loan of course you have to make sure

814
00:35:05,100 --> 00:35:09,000
that you're still making your payments

815
00:35:06,990 --> 00:35:12,480
on time and that you're making them in

816
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:14,580
the specified amount but failing to

817
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:16,920
fulfill a loan obligation could lead to

818
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:19,050
a defaulter either monetary or

819
00:35:16,920 --> 00:35:21,750
non-monetary and that could result in

820
00:35:19,050 --> 00:35:24,810
foreclosure or FSA repossessing the loan

821
00:35:21,750 --> 00:35:27,300
collateral so some of the core common

822
00:35:24,810 --> 00:35:30,080
borrower obligations are paying any fees

823
00:35:27,300 --> 00:35:32,970
required by FSA for a lien search

824
00:35:30,080 --> 00:35:34,770
executing loan documents filing or

825
00:35:32,970 --> 00:35:37,100
recording financial statements credit

826
00:35:34,770 --> 00:35:39,180
checks any other kind of fees

827
00:35:37,100 --> 00:35:41,640
maintaining and protecting your

828
00:35:39,180 --> 00:35:43,590
collateral this is an important one for

829
00:35:41,640 --> 00:35:46,260
poultry farmers because your poultry

830
00:35:43,590 --> 00:35:48,360
houses are your collateral a lot of

831
00:35:46,260 --> 00:35:51,150
times farmers may think while for

832
00:35:48,360 --> 00:35:52,740
poultry houses I'd like to close down to

833
00:35:51,150 --> 00:35:56,040
three where it's more manageable and

834
00:35:52,740 --> 00:35:59,190
then I will sell off the fourth one for

835
00:35:56,040 --> 00:36:02,430
scrap metal if you do that if you change

836
00:35:59,190 --> 00:36:04,770
or alter your collateral without prior

837
00:36:02,430 --> 00:36:07,020
authorization from FSA or your lender

838
00:36:04,770 --> 00:36:09,990
you could be found in non-monetary

839
00:36:07,020 --> 00:36:11,820
default that also includes if your your

840
00:36:09,990 --> 00:36:14,490
farm is used as collateral and there is

841
00:36:11,820 --> 00:36:17,130
timber on your farm cutting the timber

842
00:36:14,490 --> 00:36:19,860
without receiving prioritization could

843
00:36:17,130 --> 00:36:21,990
lead to a month non-monetary default so

844
00:36:19,860 --> 00:36:24,030
make sure that you review your loan

845
00:36:21,990 --> 00:36:26,490
documents review your collateral

846
00:36:24,030 --> 00:36:29,790
agreement and consult your loan officer

847
00:36:26,490 --> 00:36:31,320
before you do anything like that another

848
00:36:29,790 --> 00:36:34,260
issue that we see lots of farmers

849
00:36:31,320 --> 00:36:36,210
running into paying any and all taxes on

850
00:36:34,260 --> 00:36:38,799
your property or so

851
00:36:36,210 --> 00:36:41,109
sometimes some guys will let the taxes

852
00:36:38,799 --> 00:36:43,450
slide for a little bit and come back and

853
00:36:41,109 --> 00:36:45,940
try and pay em but if you don't pay your

854
00:36:43,450 --> 00:36:48,670
taxes you may be in non-monetary default

855
00:36:45,940 --> 00:36:51,460
and they may be able to foreclose on

856
00:36:48,670 --> 00:36:55,150
your farm as a result on another issue

857
00:36:51,460 --> 00:36:58,269
is maintaining insurance company on as

858
00:36:55,150 --> 00:36:59,469
specified in your FSA loan agreement so

859
00:36:58,269 --> 00:37:01,450
you may be required to maintain

860
00:36:59,469 --> 00:37:04,569
insurance on your farm your poultry

861
00:37:01,450 --> 00:37:06,609
houses farming equipment that may be a

862
00:37:04,569 --> 00:37:09,640
certain type of insurance which means

863
00:37:06,609 --> 00:37:12,880
their specifications or any of their

864
00:37:09,640 --> 00:37:15,700
requirements yeah that's good because

865
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,279
they it says you would you would insure

866
00:37:15,700 --> 00:37:20,799
it at the collateral they put your

867
00:37:18,279 --> 00:37:23,049
particular dangers protecting the

868
00:37:20,799 --> 00:37:26,019
collateral so the requirement is that

869
00:37:23,049 --> 00:37:29,200
you made any insurers that would place

870
00:37:26,019 --> 00:37:31,930
the value of that crap and so a good

871
00:37:29,200 --> 00:37:35,499
example of that is a maintaining

872
00:37:31,930 --> 00:37:37,420
insurance on your poultry houses we have

873
00:37:35,499 --> 00:37:39,579
seen poultry houses burned down before

874
00:37:37,420 --> 00:37:42,099
due to electrical fires or lightning any

875
00:37:39,579 --> 00:37:44,410
number of reasons and so if you don't

876
00:37:42,099 --> 00:37:46,359
have insurance that will ensure that

877
00:37:44,410 --> 00:37:49,239
poultry house to the collateral value

878
00:37:46,359 --> 00:37:50,349
then you may be nom nom monetary default

879
00:37:49,239 --> 00:37:52,210
because you're going to be under

880
00:37:50,349 --> 00:37:56,049
collateralized on that long going

881
00:37:52,210 --> 00:37:57,940
forward so just keep in mind it is your

882
00:37:56,049 --> 00:38:00,099
responsibility to fulfill the loan

883
00:37:57,940 --> 00:38:03,339
obligations it's also your

884
00:38:00,099 --> 00:38:05,559
responsibility to you know maintain all

885
00:38:03,339 --> 00:38:08,619
the other obligations within the loan

886
00:38:05,559 --> 00:38:11,380
such as any chickens site inspection or

887
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:14,710
providing any required documentation if

888
00:38:11,380 --> 00:38:17,259
your loan for example states that you

889
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,589
are required to provide documentation

890
00:38:17,259 --> 00:38:22,989
proving your insurance but you haven't

891
00:38:20,589 --> 00:38:25,599
done so you could be a non-monetary

892
00:38:22,989 --> 00:38:27,579
default even if you have insurance and

893
00:38:25,599 --> 00:38:29,410
that's because you did not follow

894
00:38:27,579 --> 00:38:32,619
through and provide the insurance as you

895
00:38:29,410 --> 00:38:35,349
were required to do so again your loan

896
00:38:32,619 --> 00:38:37,059
officer or your FSA age and can answer

897
00:38:35,349 --> 00:38:39,400
additional questions about this if you

898
00:38:37,059 --> 00:38:40,859
have any and please feel free to ask

899
00:38:39,400 --> 00:38:44,039

900
00:38:40,859 --> 00:38:46,839
okay so trouble repaying your loan

901
00:38:44,039 --> 00:38:48,369
restructuring none of us ever want to

902
00:38:46,839 --> 00:38:49,150
get to this point but we know what

903
00:38:48,369 --> 00:38:51,010
happens

904
00:38:49,150 --> 00:38:53,410
no one happens in farming especially in

905
00:38:51,010 --> 00:38:55,900
poultry farm sometimes you're not able

906
00:38:53,410 --> 00:38:58,779
to meet your financial obligations so

907
00:38:55,900 --> 00:39:01,390
what do you do if you know that you

908
00:38:58,779 --> 00:39:03,549
can't make your mortgage payment first

909
00:39:01,390 --> 00:39:06,329
if you're having trouble meeting all of

910
00:39:03,549 --> 00:39:08,440
your financial obligations that includes

911
00:39:06,329 --> 00:39:10,539
everything not just your poultry loan

912
00:39:08,440 --> 00:39:13,359
but your poultry loan your personal

913
00:39:10,539 --> 00:39:14,849
loans your home mortgage your vehicle

914
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:18,400
loans that kind of thing

915
00:39:14,849 --> 00:39:20,799
cons consult your FSA office as soon as

916
00:39:18,400 --> 00:39:22,779
possible to seek counseling it's best to

917
00:39:20,799 --> 00:39:24,940
do it before you have missed any

918
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:27,579
payments because you will have many more

919
00:39:24,940 --> 00:39:29,680
options available to you then after you

920
00:39:27,579 --> 00:39:31,869
have missed a payment and if you cannot

921
00:39:29,680 --> 00:39:33,730
fulfill all of your debt obligations

922
00:39:31,869 --> 00:39:36,880
then you want to go ahead and start

923
00:39:33,730 --> 00:39:40,599
contacting those creditors but for farm

924
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:42,700
and personal debts so to check your

925
00:39:40,599 --> 00:39:44,529
eligibility for loan restructuring or

926
00:39:42,700 --> 00:39:46,900
more restructuring details you would

927
00:39:44,529 --> 00:39:49,240
