1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
I was sick and tired of having all of my

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,339
tractor tools stored in the weeds grass

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
growing up through them you couldn't mow

4
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:09,780
around it they're just buried in a pain

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,120
to get to I put 300 linear foot of

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:14,880
parking pad storage for all my tractor

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:17,460
attachments 10 foot wide it took three

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:19,199
rolls of fabric 100 foot rolls of uh

9
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:22,320
like the under driveway geotextile

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,720
fabric 40 yards of 21 double A I've got

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,100
2 000 bucks into it about a dollar and a

12
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,779
half foot I'm sure there's a lot of

13
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:31,080
other ways to do it but this way worked

14
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:32,640
for me keeps the weeds at Bay nice high

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:34,260
and dry above everything else so that

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,520
kind of pool up in water I'd love to

17
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:37,079
have covered storage for them all but

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,200
this is a big Improvement what do you

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,200
think
