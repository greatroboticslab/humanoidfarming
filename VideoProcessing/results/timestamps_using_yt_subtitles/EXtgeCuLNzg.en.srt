00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,880
how air pollution threatens natural pest

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:08,280
control methods in sustainable farming

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,500
few individuals are aware of the dangers

4
00:00:08,280 --> 00:00:12,420
that air pollution poses to both people

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:14,820
and the environment

6
00:00:12,420 --> 00:00:17,699
humans who breathe polluted air are more

7
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:19,680
likely to get cancer heart disease and

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:21,900
even birth defects

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,820
Additionally the disruption of the

10
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:25,140
natural ecosystem caused by air

11
00:00:23,820 --> 00:00:26,880
pollution from different human

12
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,640
activities such as industrial

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,399
manufacturing car emissions and power

14
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:34,320
plants reduces biodiversity by altering

15
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,620
the migratory patterns of plants and

16
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,079
animals and affects wildlife habitats

17
00:00:37,620 --> 00:00:42,660
this could jeopardize Farmers usage of

18
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:44,579
non-toxic non-GMO natural Pest

19
00:00:42,660 --> 00:00:46,860
management techniques genetically

20
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:48,960
modified organisms

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,300
here is how air pollution endangers

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,700
organic pest management techniques used

23
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,340
in sustainable agriculture

24
00:00:53,700 --> 00:00:58,079
air pollution has been recognized as an

25
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:01,320
increasingly major Hazard to the

26
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:03,480
environment in recent years for instance

27
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,760
a research reported in the journal

28
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:07,979
science indicated that both indoor and

29
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,920
outdoor air pollution contribute to up

30
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,979
to 8 million premature deaths annually

31
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,200
both natural and man-made sources such

32
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,600
as car emissions and Industrial Waste

33
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,400
gases directly release pollutants into

34
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,799
the air outside

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,939
air pollution's effects on organic

36
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:26,460
farming

37
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:28,799
natural Pest Management strategies in

38
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:30,420
sustainable agriculture are under danger

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,799
due to the growing issue of air

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,960
pollution

41
00:01:31,799 --> 00:01:35,880
the health of plants is impacted by

42
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,700
higher levels of pollutants including

43
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,920
ozone particulate matter and nitrogen

44
00:01:38,700 --> 00:01:43,320
dioxide because they cause premature

45
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:44,700
fruit ripening which can reduce yields

46
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,100
and quality

47
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,500
due to decreased pest defenses when

48
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:52,560
crops are stressed by air pollution they

49
00:01:49,500 --> 00:01:55,200
are also more prone to bug infestation

50
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,780
this may lead to lower crop yields and a

51
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,820
higher need for insecticides

52
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:01,500
the danger of organic pest control

53
00:01:59,820 --> 00:02:03,600
techniques

54
00:02:01,500 --> 00:02:05,700
one of the most environmentally friendly

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,280
ways to care for crops is through

56
00:02:05,700 --> 00:02:10,860
natural pest control methods

57
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:13,560
however a recent study indicates that

58
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:15,780
the pollution from factories farms and

59
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:18,140
Autos may be endangering these organic

60
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:20,580
Pest Management strategies

61
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,319
researchers discovered that ladybugs

62
00:02:20,580 --> 00:02:24,780
struggled to locate their meal when

63
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:27,000
there is a lot of air pollution around

64
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,860
additionally it prevents them from

65
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,660
having offspring

66
00:02:28,860 --> 00:02:33,300
a healthy environment depends on

67
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:35,459
ladybugs which also help keep insect

68
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:37,500
populations in checked and potentially

69
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,300
safe Farmers a lot of money on

70
00:02:37,500 --> 00:02:42,420
pesticides

71
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:44,459
future of sustainable agriculture

72
00:02:42,420 --> 00:02:46,620
sustainable farming is gaining

73
00:02:44,459 --> 00:02:48,780
popularity as a means of feeding a

74
00:02:46,620 --> 00:02:50,400
rising population well while preserving

75
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,379
the environment

76
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:55,080
the use of natural Pest management

77
00:02:52,379 --> 00:02:57,540
techniques such as crop rotation or

78
00:02:55,080 --> 00:03:00,060
chemical free fertilizers as opposed to

79
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:02,220
pesticides is one of the main benefits

80
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:04,440
of sustainable farming

81
00:03:02,220 --> 00:03:06,239
Recent research has revealed that air

82
00:03:04,440 --> 00:03:09,000
pollution may be endangering these

83
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:12,360
organic pest management techniques
