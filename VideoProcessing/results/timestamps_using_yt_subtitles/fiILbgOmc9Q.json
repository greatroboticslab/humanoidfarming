  "text": "good morning everybody thanks for being here this is another seminars and quite a series that we have been organizing and actually I want to take the opportunity to thank Issa Bell for following up on the seminars if you have any idea for your own to present or any speaker you think should come and give a seminar you can always float the idea today we invited Luke don dava ludendorff is a very esteemed colleague with whom we have been working over the past years in a very fruitful collaboration between CIMMYT and simba stuff when you see some of the numbers about publications coming out of the long term trial infrastructure the long term trials we have here in in Mexico part of those publications come from student collaborations that we have been doing together with Simba stuff and Luke's research team what I always say is the uniqueness is Luke has a lot of nice ideas nice research tools that we don't have and we have the long term trials that can actually be the background or the can generate a story to buy through using those that those insights that are way more upstream than what we are doing Luke is a very long and recognized career he started its its work at university university of lurvin dan was quite some time active in Rotom step and finally landed in Mexico in Simla stuff where he's still leading one of the most important research teams on carbon nitrogen cycling and recently micro organism processes but I'm sure he will explain that way better than I can do so thank you and let's give a round of applause [Applause] good morning good morning and thanks for coming I try relations but okay to give certain characteristics to bacteria I don't know if soap actress or important in that it might be competition it might be predictors are not collaboration between friend institutes some younger researchers working we already it's rather a good collaboration I'm quite proud of it we have now 31 published peer-reviewed manuscripts we've got seven hundred forty-five citations some Morpher these citations come from some very important papers of Braun Road we have an index of 14 so I'm quite pleased with this collaboration we have quite a lot of other papers ready to submit okay we know that agriculture practices affect yields so characteristics we studied some of these Elberton and Obregon but I focus mostly pitfall in Elberton so in sole characteristics abdominal pattern I mentioned it immediately I got to replicated plots so if you do an analysis statistical analysis you get problems because the variation is rather great so often you see clear-cut effects that they are not significant so yeah some of the problem that's one of the commands of the last paper that we submit doesn't even know it is to accept it but this is a command I often receive we know but I'm a bit worried about because it returns and returns that's why obreg\u00f3n is that if we want to get some soul samples and extract DNA time becomes difficult and if we want to expect Aaron aid and it's even more okay but these differences especially which have a large effect on carbon nitrogen mineralization this is a very simple representation of the AI robic incubation we do who got some soul which are carbon dioxide and we measure in the soil mineral M and now recently we saw to extract a DNA to see what is happening there another command that I was not really aware but if you start to work with bacteria then you have non-parametric data I've never well did a lot of research on soul characteristics parametric but bacteria if you count they're nonparametric and again if you try to do some analysis than yeah significant difference is rather difficult to obtain because nonparametric or more stringent if I can say it all that okay so I said I would mention the problems really these are some results of carbon and nitrogen mineralization you see not a lot of differences between your treatments although you have a difference in carbon content and I compare that with ballpark and Rothamsted where after how long as it's more than hundred and sixty years you really have a big difference in in carbon carbon content is extremely different I just want to mention you know that maybe Jenkins have published a paper on micro biomass carbon there's no replicator broad book so if you look at the data on his original paper then there's no replicates there additionally he includes soil and you look at the line so but anyway I think a very important paper but I have some questions anyway we didn't detect a big difference in carbon nitrogen mineralization we did some measurements also in the field we did that quite a while ago and that was one of the problems we faced when separate his paper on carbon carbon dioxide emission tonight\u00eds outside the mission the median emissions that reviews pointing out you only have two replicants okay conservation agriculture possession but okay you have these data you have these differences so what is the effect of these different on microbial populations and this is a principal component analysis and it's a you try to get all your data on bacterial groups you try to correlate them or whatever so a separation between permanent vets between conventional birds and what do you get in in conventional vets you get copy of drops fresh organic material consumed it that they're graded them in ER allows it to organisms that neutral depleted its might be questionable as a word because normally it has more to do with nutrients down the foreground epithelial but Auto for organic material so if there is a microbiologist followed up using that because some people are very yep Fermi could the agriculture practices do you affect our markable populations as I meant to permanent bats they favor these groups which are only go trough stat prefer nothing this is the opposite they prefer our nutrient rich this should be reversed but anyway and then we have conventional bats where we get these organisms that prefer organic rich environments why because if you have conventional bets then you deal on top ok sampling in 2012 2014 we'll get the same results permanent bats preferred by oligotrophic preferred they are favored and if you go to conventional practices conventional um I always have questions is this for real do you have changes over time or my results correct because your was a problem often and what do I mean by technique the when we did these first analysis we had clones we had about 150 sequences of DNA and then we went to a biro which is about a hundred thousand sequences and now we go to Illumina and we can talk about whatever you want 400 million two hundred so the question is always there's an evolution okay now so what we start experiment is here trying salt samples over the year and we want to look at population we try to look at certain processes also because it's one of the critiques you can have on this work it's very descriptive descriptive what this is all about what you're really doing what is the importance of all this and I will say we try to start with getting the techniques right and then we can start to focus on some questions we have so I'll mention some some questions at the end of my talk but we want to focus on on or nitrification and functionality functionality are all RNA from a soul is very difficult if you look at literature you will find some papers on it but very little problem is solo conditions and we are very lucky that Obregon we succeed in extracting Parana in Elberton forget about it so you check the literature it's the same week I mentioned bacteria because extract or amplifying DNA from fungi Ryota is not so easy RK are we can do it but it's a borderline so look at the literature you will see some papers but if you try to compare because NL in we published a paper on fungi in Sonora and microscopic eukaryota there's nothing to compare it really somewhere it's okay you have some but microscopic areata very little okay if we have the question about copier tropes and not of Stan my idea was we got organic material if we got organic me too available we'll get some copy at Rose the writers is normally organic carbon so what we're trying to do all of these two behaving in fear there's a lot of organic comedy correct environments and also we apply organic material crop residue to the soil who is going to degrade eat an organic material okay this is still a recent and I haven't gone into all the details but we did we met pollution vegetative flowering gratefully so the Pope's whole versus free this dynamics a bit and then again they saw a lot of rolling track development I with sass and people convinced me that error it's much better it is a magnificent tool but it takes some time first to adjust to it because sass is very straightforward errors it's strange if you're not used to it another problem see with I can do this dis graph so well the results were obtained in our eye and then put it in Excel because I don't like the graphs but you have about six or set packages that can do this and it's I get lost sometimes that's easy it's straightforward towards the same but to edit it's all these biological techniques they don't exist and in error you've got all these updates well daily I think so my advice is people really want to want to work in bio informatics go to arrow or fight them I don't know fight them because they're trying to convince me also to start working in frightened I don't know pursue me I will end up doing it but anyway but then we get we get some clear changes again in population in the rhizosphere so are they holds more or less it's there in in error sure if it will all give better results but and this is also very recent although I think the program of this was they started to write it when we were in Oakridge they mentioned it this is where you've got your bacteria identified with ribosome al DNA sorry and then you try to link these populations to functions and that is very interesting because although as you go six hundred or thousand species lobby hell what are they doing okay I know Posse lose and I know so don't wanna know akise and I know that but this becomes interesting now I think that Bala ping it because Aaron R is not so easy to extract but I hope we can link this with Erina ah this is he I think of Tillich but I said it's just I did it two days ago and then this is another experiment - from these are Cubase over time so if you see these seven and fourteen normally we have about 260 250 data points and then you see here we are added being material and this is on the mend it and then you see that the beam the population is a shift in pollution the story is I apply organic material and there's a shift in my population okay as I said we can confirm Earth as always once you get some answers they define certain groups as being oligo troughs and certain groups being copy of troughs and then you you compare RT no bacteria this group what is it micro focus area and then you've got here Gail Alessia and then you see these are favored by organic material you apply and the others not so yeah you so I think it would be rather difficult to say that one bacterial group has these characteristics I have to mention when we go to species in bacteria then we talk about 97% of similitude similarly to dia we differ from chimpanzees I think zero three percent so what are we talking about really okay but we are aware of this problem but we should sometimes not forget it okay as I mentioned these groups are very easy to isolate so they are well described but in a soil they are normally not that important only three percent of them and we got the other bacillus of five percent so what is all the rest do we one of the other problems when we write these papers than normally we mentioned about 15 groups at the maximum and normally you found between 500 and thousand sinners so what all the rest is doing we don't know and we don't even want to talk about it because we would go the pit get a paper off I don't know how many pages but anyway so would you the question was would sort characteristics affect our behavior of groups when we apply ionic materials who we apply organic material in one system permanent pets so we would hope that this group which is acido bacteria ie this is a very important group but we don't know actually what it is doing and then you see in employment that's when you apply beam material their relative abundance increases when you apply it to a conventional but it's an effect or so characteristic so we wanted to have some sort of a bit more diverse to see how different bacterias group respond to and this we used to janaba and we used to take Coco and now this is quite nice so you get a complete separation of your different groups oh yeah one of the problems I have is with economical correlations when I do a principal component analysis it's very nice I go to canonical and it's not so nice so my explanation is there is a factor of defining this that I can't or I don't measure it or is it that it's important or its interaction between my populations in the given environment but I mean I said I would mention the problems I see but okay I think we can on this system and the different ecosystems now you have the chinampa barton Texcoco i Tyrael how are these groups respond Tyrael and then you see Tillett it's increasing why it gives the organic material that's very well known but then you start to see these groups like oh think I missed that one this which is rather well known and normally it is a copy of drove however and this system index KOCO one outlaw organic material it participates in the degradation of the organic material and when our look hotel our tongue not at all so conclusion these groups adapt themselves or they add them at a bullet metabolic capacity but the environment the competition with other groups defines how they respond yeah so what we made a little which organisms fit along a gradient so we apply here some organic material and we measured populations they want they freely 7 14 28 256 and then you see the groups that were favored their relative abundance increase Allah - and they've a good button down we see it in normal basileus and some step two misses so long yeah but you see there are different groups it or faith or okay I think I remember if I remember correctly teacher said that theory and soil normally keep genetic capacity they don't shed so much of the capacity as you will see in the reactor or in my stomach genes in so this is again three systems in material they get a shift in your population okay as I mentioned very well very nice you got beautiful bcoz you say oh we've got a shift but can we learn for all this first of all I think cooking techniques to specific questions are one of the specific questions we were trying to address now is in Obregon it's a problem with sewing that my nation plant emerges and plan to stand decreased on the dry sowing but not in wet conditions so we retreat them with four pesticides or herbicides or whatever insecticides fungicides done so we assume it is a problem there with so I think with all these techniques we now have we try to look if it's really a biological problem or facing ok well that's not that difficult but this is not that easy so conditions there are some people extracting method anomic sore where you pay a lot extract all the DNA and then you'll know is everything yeah it's rather cost costs a bit but then you need and I'll mention that later on when you need to computer power and your knowledge to all these species of 300 or 100 DNA spares to link them that's not that easy neither but anyway were working on as I mentioned as and then another study we started this to look at our populations why do we look at different years were related to trace gas emission greenhouse gas emission nitrous oxide why do we focus on like two fires and not on the United occasion and all that many so we try to focus on something that is Raleigh's study additionally the genes or the yeah the proteins involved in the process or rather limited however for instance mor which mon IAM mono oxygenase on or i thought there was one now they're already three different types so if you want to look at these things these processes you have to consider all the possible genes so we're looking at we are looking at permanent as conventional burnt and then we have minus and plus we want to measure this this is a first preliminary experiment with ammonium to these different sites and what we when applied in the field that then you see that a lot of oxidation of ammonium so you have a rather vivid or active notifier population which is not that yeah okay we want to measure we've measured that we want to measure these gases we want to measure biomass we go for microbial structure nitrifiers this is not that complicated as I mentioned you already have three of them I don't know how many I have of these but then we want to if you can 90% of the activity is normal activity of the organisms it's not related to the process you're studying got a bit of a needle and not think so it's too evident so we're trying to work on that um one of the things I haven't mentioned yet but I think with all the changes in techniques we have what I mentioned it we start 150 clones then we went to a hundred thousand and now I don't know how many to two hundred million you need a bit of computer power and we only starting so we will start now since yesterday I think finally after two years of negotiating we can have a new option within the department which will focus on bioinformatics statistics and supercomputing one of the problems I see in statistics personally if time series I mean if you have a change over time how do you compare this population what we normally do what Richard Webster always told me you just take them in and you compare the mean and there will be enough and forget about all the rest but I think we need it some some just that supercomputers simply to get your make the genome meet a genome together bioinformatics yeah there's a lot of dispute about the systems you've got your secrets and then you have different system verify or check identify the organisms it belonged to and so you have sir NAL's that say we want that system Europeans normally go for the European system America the American system and but anyway that's another of the questions we have and then another thing we will try to do is we did a lot of these experiments organic material copier troughs oligotrophic you want to get it all together it's about 20 experiments we want to compare and see if all these data we have some bitty bit of meta data mining see we can get something out okay that's or at the moment I must admit as you can see this is not my work cover a lot of people and I haven't mentioned them all but would like to fight them one of the advantages I think with the Mexico we have a lot of people that's for sure a lot of very enthusiastic people very capable people funding is not always that easy but ok we get along and we have no access is to booster sophisticated equipment but ok these sequences we Santa Marta micro gent Korea about the German group who now extract DNA from soil from our ancestors and have you read about that that now they can extract DNA from so because lbn a doesn't agree date and so so you it is preserved so we if you look at the under talus where they walked yeah we can find traces of this DNA only mention it the amount of soil you meet to do this is not 20 grams like you do in the bottom but a huge amount and what these sorry these Germans have they developed a robot so you can assess so process an enormous amount of what we have the people they have the robot we have been 20th time robot will be cheap all the rest will be rather expensive Belen I would be very - for the field experiment I think what Brom mentioned is is true it's a unique yeah a unique experiment when I answer these question two replicates I always say it's the only field experiment in the tropics that I have access to okay there - replicates but well maintained experiments for more than 25 years correct bro don't find them so if you will study these things okay it might be useless I'm not sure then you need something you can rely on it's well done because if you go into the field and we compare whatever little bot done what we compare forests the variation is huge you know if you don't know what they did so I am grateful it and also when the money thought they were more than willing to help me I am in depth to see this stuff for the infrastructure and of course corners it was very generous with funding us I think that's it yep [Applause] things look and even that I was involved in in the work I still got some new ideas by seeing it presented like that so as always you keep us on our toes any questions from the from the audience please use the microphones because we have over I don't know how many people but several connected via the webinar so if you can use the microphone even I look hi very interesting I I think I might have missed when you collect your soil samples to do your extractions what depth or from what part of the soil are those soils we normally we normally work on the topsoil layer why we do that is because we hope with the biggest diversity I know there are papers published that you have to be careful with the proof well I I'm well aware of that but it's it all has to do with where do you want to focus on if I said 200 samples to analyze if I would go into profiles tonight I get lost it's a little always trying to 0 to 20 0 to 15 C to 10 to 20 it depends it depends a bit yeah but nobody's here written I don't know you could go back to the soil tests of the three different locations yeah I don't know if I thought this KOCO with a pH is it to acetic acidic pH 9 is not here at this station right what this oh no no no oh sorry oh yes okay I have to explain this because you you have this differences in in air bottom we see a difference and so we see an effect of what we do on our population so to to stress to to go in an excess of variation we were too Sol's in the area it's a chinampa it's in Xochimilco Texcoco you you got nine point four which is not a lot because in texcoco we have ten point five but we do not do go to be too extreme yeah it's a tech school it's it like yeah yeah and and you have a huge salinity also the lot of studies of context Coco that's why I sorry say yeah yeah sorry one last question no no what's your view on these bio fertilizers that are dealing with these bacteria well this is not my well it's personal but I'm not the only one who would say that I remember David Jenkinson say and I remember Martin Alexander saying that I agree completely I think it would be very difficult to there that there are two reasons first of all you have an equilibrium you have a system in equilibrium you apply something organisms second if you have a soil you apply it how are you going to apply it where you need it I can imagine you fertilize a seat and then you hope we did some experiments we did an experiment bath serum and it was fantastic it was the best we had an effect for one month on the roots and that was it I'm actually doing experiment with mace one of the farmers who has this brilliant system of bio fertilizer and and we sterilized is consortium and in the beginning the sterilized consortium gave better results than the consortium there's another reason why I'm very skeptical for this experiment we took the literature check the literature and it tells you quite a lot where was it published which journals was published I get very doubtful I remember in Berlin Berlin but it was cut off flocek with also superior in brazil and i had a positive result so they published it and it could never repeat it so I am but the expendable doing is we using these techniques we have now to look more at survived so we have this consortium will characterize it will see what is happening problem is always okay I'm working in green house because if I do it in a field and again you know the problems in the field people do thinks he don't know one of the other that's the reason why I prefer to work with cement we started to work with somebody yeah in route to correct our room I don't remember the name typically be bugged Apache I don't remember the village and and you try to collaborate and then they call you and they say only we fertilized yeah do you have sample so you can't and that's also one of the questions of reviews why did you do it in a greenhouse yeah can't say I can't work in this because it's not like Europe remember we measured some trace gases in Chiapas and su Chiapas and we we left our PVC tubes in the field they stole them and we were communicating constantly with local people I yeah it's one of the reasons also why I think field experiments are similar brilliant and that we do some some field some lab experiments it's very difficult to justify to review says yeah ok yeah just a comment we actually also have a field trial that's been going on for 20 years and San Luis Potosi haha at any flop station so might be interesting also to do some investigation there also evaluate conservation agriculture minimal village and conventional system and two replications okay okay what what kind of soil is it so it's if we can extract that or an A then that , meter because it's rather copper notes no no no no it's it's it's not it's not even no sorry this is this it's not even to do with the type of soil it is it is at random we had in the beginning for instance in in Elberton we sampled or you said you're trying to extract DNA you got 9 replicate where you've got treatments and all of sudden once all you can't extract it whatever you do now we optimize that on blah blah blah but it's it's you you you if you go to conferences or congresses that was one at Broadway last year in December where and then you hear the scene the same questions DNA nor the problem RNA proteins that people huge map what kind of money dedicated to extract proteins because that's the final solution I mean DNA RNA and proteins puppets and they got money you know Europe it's 1 million euros but you know what I mean it's these techniques are not yet what they should be but I think they're brilliant I love it I think Simon for your comment and actually slowly are going to be ready to be put in in this kind of this kind of networks and taking advantage of off of thinking all the PhD students that actually have been connected to the work and that I think that's something we have to reactivate also in the in the team to see how can we can they be a PhD student working on to see or so definitely nila is working on that Yvonne is working on attracting more students so I think that's how we can keep this kind of work going any more questions question over there somebody else know somebody online somebody online has a question now that I was recently following a seminar online I know how frustrated it is you want to say something and nobody remembers that you're actually hanging on your computer no one time two times last time no question Luke you other question was a specific question you I'm not I'm willing to investigate it but the descriptive I think no because we've done it I think we should we should start using these techniques to really I have a problem here can I can I answer with my molecular biology I think so so if you have questions more number yep okay thank you very much look and I think this is a clear example of research research are in fact true partnerships when I'm asked what is the value of the long term drugs I just show Luke's first slide with I don't know I don't even remember more than 30 share joint publications and 18 decks of 14 and that usually helps to convince them more academically or oriented donors so look thank you very much it has been a brilliant partnership and there's more to come in future [Applause] [Applause] you",
