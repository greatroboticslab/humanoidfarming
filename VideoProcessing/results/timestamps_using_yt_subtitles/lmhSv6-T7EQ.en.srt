00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,800
microbiological agar is an important

3
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,760
material used in cultivation and

4
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,079
isolation of microbes this video will

5
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,000
show you how to prepare potato dextrose

6
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:40,320
agar or pdm

7
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,640
pda is a microbiological media used for

8
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:44,879
wide variety of fungi

9
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:46,879
pda can be prepared using ready-made

10
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,879
dehydrated media

11
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,640
or also can be prepared using fresh

12
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,640
potatoes

13
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,800
thanks to the helping hand miss aubry my

14
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:58,800
postgraduate student for assisting me in

15
00:00:54,800 --> 00:01:03,120
preparation of this video

16
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,120
this is already met dehydrated pda

17
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:06,560
the media consists of 200 grams of

18
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,439
potatoes

19
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,439
20 grams of the extra sugar and 15 grams

20
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,360
of agar

21
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,920
we will resemble the composition for

22
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:18,960
preparation of pdf from fresh potatoes

23
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:23,520
as mentioned earlier the pdf consists of

24
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,520
potato dextrose and agar

25
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,000
for preparation of one liter of the

26
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,520
media we need

27
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:36,000
200 grams of fresh potatoes 20 grams of

28
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:38,400
dextrose or sugar and 15 grams of agar

29
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
however we increase the agar from 15

30
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,079
gram per liter to 20 gram per liter for

31
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:46,159
more solid agar media

32
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,399
for the purpose of this video we will

33
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,640
prepare 250 milliliter

34
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:53,439
therefore we need 50 grams of fresh

35
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:55,840
potatoes 5 gram of dextrose and 5 gram

36
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:55,840
of agar

44

after that the media need to be

45
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,360
sterilized using an autoclave

46
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:29,840
miss aubry will demonstrate how to use

47
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:29,840
