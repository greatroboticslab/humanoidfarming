1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,799
Good agricultural practices or GAP. It's

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,519
a concept which been developed by the

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:13,679
United Nations Food and Agriculture

4
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:15,920
Organization FAO. And the aim for GAP is

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,279
for looking at agricultural commodities

6
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,680
and developing a safe and healthy

7
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:25,439
product at the end of the whole supply

8
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:28,320
chain. Now to do that one has to then

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:31,199
develop what is the best agricultural

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,680
practices both pre and post-h harvest

11
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,880
for a particular commodity.

12
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:40,160
The GAP approach has been used quite

13
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:42,079
successfully in horiculture but now it's

14
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,760
being applied to commodities such as

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:49,840
rice. Now one of the challenges is that

16
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:53,280
to develop a uh approach which is

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:56,480
ratified at a national level so that

18
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:58,239
farmers can get accreditation but also

19
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,320
to have that approach so it's ratified

20
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,640
at an international level and meets

21
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:03,520
international guidelines um and there

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,000
are quite a number of different

23
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:09,119
guidelines for example the international

24
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,320
um compliance for plant protection. So

25
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:15,040
we're looking at a process which is

26
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,200
providing a product which is not only

27
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:19,040
safe but also consistent with something

28
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,439
which is sustainable in environmental

29
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,920
context. So we're looking at sustainable

30
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:28,240
resource management.

31
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:31,280
So in currently there is rice GAP being

32
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:33,200
developed in Vietnam and also in

33
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
Thailand and there's a lot of other

34
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:38,560
interest in Southeast Asia in developing

35
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,680
rice GAP but we're still at the early

36
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:43,360
stages. In Vietnam at the moment,

37
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,560
there's about a 100 farmers that have

38
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:49,360
been ratified, usually as groups and

39
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,159
they are ratified at by a a national

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:56,079
committee and those farmers are able to

41
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,600
get a 20% premium on the rice that they

42
00:01:56,079 --> 00:01:59,439
produce.

43
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,600
But whether that can be sustained

44
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:04,719
because if you have lots of farmers who

45
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,399
become ratified then maybe might be

46
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:09,280
difficult to maintain that economic

47
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,200
incentive. But more importantly is if

48
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,319
you're an exporting nation such as

49
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,599
Vietnam and Thailand

50
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:22,480
to certain markets such as Europe then

51
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,560
is expected that the exporting nation as

52
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:29,520
is providing a product which is ratified

53
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:31,440
as being consistent with GAP. So that is

54
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:34,000
an expectation which is going to develop

55
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:37,599
even more so particularly in Europe

56
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:44,000
European Union there any product that's

57
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:46,400
imported has to be certified to be GP.

58
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,480
So that is the incentives and the need.

59
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:51,360
So it's an incentive at a farmer level

60
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,800
but also at a national level. But with

61
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:54,879
countries like the Philippines which

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,879
don't export but import, it's still

63
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:02,879
important to have GP because the GOP

64
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:06,720
also is an indication of society demands

65
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:08,720
and society is now demanding more and

66
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:12,239
more particularly from the cities that

67
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,800
they have a product which is safe and

68
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,239
safe and nutritious for them and their

69
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:20,159
families. So if you're a farmer in the

70
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,879
Philippines that's producing rice for a

71
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:28,159
domestic market, then there's also going

72
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:31,200
to be as time develops uh an a need an

73
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,519
essential need to develop rice under GAP

74
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:37,360
practices.

75
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:39,760
In Vietnam, we have a study site in

76
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,440
Anjiang in the province in the Mikong

77
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:49,760
Delta. And that province is seen as

78
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:52,560
being a um it's a model province for

79
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:55,840
good agricultural practice for rice. And

80
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,799
so part of that JP is developing best

81
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,159
practice both pre and post-h harvest. So

82
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:01,760
we're working very closely with the

83
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:04,239
Vietnamese government and the provincial

84
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,920
government in Anjiang as a model where

85
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,080
we're bringing in our natural resource

86
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,640
management technologies from the

87
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,879
irrigated rice research consortium and

88
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,760
helping them to develop the best

89
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,680
practice for pre and post harvest. And

90
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
so now we've been rolling it out um

91
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,120
since the beginning of 2009

92
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,800
and now it has been labeled under a five

93
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:31,600
reductions one must do initiative and

94
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:33,680
that is now taking um place in Anjiang.

95
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,000
It's generated lots of support from the

96
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,520
provincial government and now the local

97
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:41,120
the national government is looking how

98
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,440
that can be diffused to other provinces

99
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,440
in the Mikong.
