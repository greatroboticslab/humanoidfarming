1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,760
so there's gonna be five simple steps to

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:05,760
raising mealworms

3
00:00:06,670 --> 00:00:10,160
[Music]

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
hello and welcome to wholesome roots

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:15,639
today i'm gonna talk to you about

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:15,639
mealworms 101

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:20,720
mealworms are an easy to grow

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:22,560
high-protein treat for many different

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
types of animals we raise them for our

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,800
chicken quail and other poultry some

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,279
people use them for their lizard or

12
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,880
other reptiles so first off you need to

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:34,239
know the life cycle

14
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:37,520
of the meal worm so the egg will hatch

15
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,800
out into a teeny tiny little worm or

16
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,200
otherwise known as larva that worm will

17
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,360
grow and shed its skin

18
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,920
and grow some more and shed its skin

19
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,879
multiple times in this portion of its

20
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:54,000
leg then when it reaches a full size it

21
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,000
will turn into a pupa in this stage

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,199
a lot of transformation takes place it's

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,280
kind of like the chrysalis of a

24
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:02,079
butterfly once the transformation is

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,159
complete inside of the pupa and that

26
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:08,159
larva has turned into a beetle

27
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:11,040
internally it will shed its exoskeleton

28
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,600
again one more time and turn into a

29
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:16,159
beetle this beetle will then

30
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:17,759
continue the life cycle by breeding and

31
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:19,439
laying more eggs

32
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,439
lots of different people who raise

33
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,000
mealworms keep them in separate

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:26,080
containers they'll keep the larva in one

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,720
the pupa in another and the beetle in

36
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,840
the other the reason why they do this is

37
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,159
because

38
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:34,479
some people find it easier that way

39
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,479
because it's easier to harvest the worms

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,320
when they're at full size and some

41
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,119
people are concerned that the beetles

42
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:43,520
will eat some of the larva but i have

43
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,759
found that it's a much simpler way to

44
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,320
keep all three stages of the life cycle

45
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,720
together as long as it's managed well

46
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,119
and you harvest your worms and don't

47
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:55,759
allow the beetles to become too high in

48
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:57,840
numbers you'll be fine and the nice

49
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,240
thing is is my chickens actually will

50
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,960
eat the beetles too so when my beetle

51
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,719
numbers become too high i will harvest

52
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,560
some of them and feed them to the

53
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:10,160
chickens as well so there's going to be

54
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:12,720
five simple steps to raising mealworms

55
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,200
one you want a container

56
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:17,360
we use this old fish tank just because

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,280
it's what we have we like to use things

58
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:20,879
around the homestead that are things

59
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,760
that we already have

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:26,319
it also can just be a rubbermaid tote

61
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,800
this i like because i can see through it

62
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,959
easily and check on the colony without

63
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,160
removing any lids or anything

64
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:36,959
so i do keep a screen lid on top once i

65
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,280
have the colonies established in

66
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:41,040
the tank i do want to protect it from

67
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
anything getting in

68
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,599
so make sure that your container is

69
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:48,080
clean and sanitized we sanitize with

70
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,920
vinegar wipe it clean make sure it's

71
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:51,840
super dry before you add any of the

72
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,360
bedding or the mealworm then you're

73
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,360
going to want to add a food source

74
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:02,080
we have this food source right here it's

75
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:04,640
bedding and food and it's just

76
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:07,519
wheat bran so something i like to think

77
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:10,959
about as a analogy for the mealworm

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,680
feeding and bedding is soil layers so i

79
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,159
do this as my foundation

80
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
layer it's at the bottom and i pour it

81
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:19,280
in

82
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:22,319
and then i add my mulch

83
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:27,159
i put oatmeal over the top then

84
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,159
i add slices of potatoes

85
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:34,000
[Music]

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,440
so the food

87
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,000
brand cereal

88
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:40,799
is fine oatmeal is fine

89
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,280
i've even had to feed them layer pellets

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:46,640
or quail food when i was in a pinch and

91
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:49,519
it worked great we add slices of carrots

92
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,200
potatoes apples but you have to make

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,400
sure that you keep an eye on these

94
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,239
slices that they don't get moldy

95
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,319
or you will have to definitely remove

96
00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:00,480
them another thing to keep in mind that

97
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,519
it's extremely important with your feed

98
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:02,319
that you give

99
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
the

100
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:08,879
mealworm colony is that if you get wheat

101
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:10,959
bran or oatmeal from anywhere no matter

102
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,200
what the source you will want to put it

103
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:15,680
into your freezer for 48 hours before

104
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:16,720
you feed it to them to kill any

105
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:20,239
active

106
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:22,880
mites or moths mites and moths are quite

107
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:25,759
commonly found in these food products

108
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:28,080
that are sold in the store for people so

109
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:30,240
it is a good idea to make sure that you

110
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:31,840
freeze off any of those pests that might

111
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,199
be already in

112
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,040
these containers

113
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,440
so other pests that you want to look out

114
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:39,759
for is going to be any kind of crawling

115
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,360
critters that might get in here i've had

116
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,320
spiders take over and sometimes that's

117
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:46,880
good

118
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:49,440
because it keeps anything else out but i

119
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:52,160
have found beetles in the spider

120
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,240
webs in the past so i try to keep those

121
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,280
pests out of my tank

122
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,440
now a lid with a wire top is not going

123
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,440
to completely keep them out so you will

124
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,759
have to keep an eye out for it and you

125
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:06,000
will want to provide a top for your

126
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,199
colony because you don't want any other

127
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,520
critters

128
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,840
or rodents getting in there and trying

129
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,960
to eat your colony getting a great

130
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:16,560
healthy colony is our third step of

131
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,880
success and

132
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:21,120
making sure that you start out with some

133
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:22,160
really nice mealworms now some people

134
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:23,440
will

135
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:26,400
sell you

136
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:28,639
the all three stages but that is not

137
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:30,960
necessary and if you have a friend who

138
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,919
lives nearby that is raising mealworms

139
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,160
they are very likely to provide you with

140
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,240
all three stages no problem if you just

141
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
have when you purchase a container of

142
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:44,320
mealworms online they are going to

143
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,320
arrive in the mail here's ours

144
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,479
oh yeah

145
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,479
they definitely arrived alive

146
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,840
give you a little snack

147
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,880
fresh out of the mailbox i want to make

148
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:00,880
sure that they're

149
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:03,199
i have enough hydration give them a

150
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,280
little slice of potato

151
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:07,600
i'll leave a link down below to the

152
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,479
amazon purchase that this was made from

153
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:13,440
so if you just have the larva stage they

154
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:16,080
are going to continue on their journey

155
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,840
and pupate those pupa will turn into

156
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:21,199
beetles and the life cycle will be

157
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,800
re-made for you

158
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,759
so it's been a couple of weeks since we

159
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,319
received our order and we already have

160
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:31,199
all three stages when they arrived they

161
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:34,880
came in this small container with holes

162
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:36,880
on top i poured them into this container

163
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:41,280
so that i could give them more food and

164
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:43,520
room to begin their process of growing

165
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:47,440
as you can see

166
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:47,440
we already have plenty of pupa

167
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,360
and the beetles

168
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:53,199
are in here too

169
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:56,400
i have a couple of them

170
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:58,000
that have pupated out into beetles so

171
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,639
don't feel like you have to spend the

172
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,400
extra money on all three stages when you

173
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:05,759
can just get the larva and have great

174
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,720
success as well when handling your

175
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:10,000
mealworm and their colony once they're

176
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:13,199
getting established there's going to be

177
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:15,520
a lot of feces in this material and it's

178
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
going to be very dusty so you will want

179
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,840
to use gloves

180
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:22,319
and a mask if you're sensitive

181
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,919
so step number four is monitor your

182
00:07:22,319 --> 00:07:25,599
colony you're going to want to

183
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,840
constantly check those potatoes and

184
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,000
apples for any silent mold and remove it

185
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
right away along with any bedding that

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,240
becomes moldy from touching it you're

187
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:36,880
going to want to watch and see if your

188
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:39,039
ratio of beetles becomes too high and

189
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:41,199
they do start to consume larvae that is

190
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,039
something that you will have to address

191
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,280
you can remove the beetles and feed

192
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,199
those to chickens if you have chickens

193
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,560
that will eat the beetles that works out

194
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,280
really well for me

195
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:54,000
or you can freeze them in your freezer

196
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:55,680
for a humane way of disposing of them

197
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,560
you'll also want to be watching out for

198
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:00,479
any signs of pests the most common pests

199
00:07:58,560 --> 00:08:02,240
with these guys is going to be grain

200
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,160
mites which are itty bitty tiny

201
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,599
creatures that you can hardly see but

202
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,120
you'll know when they're there because

203
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,800
they will start crawling up the side of

204
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,240
the container

205
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,360
trust me

206
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,120
i know from experience and then the next

207
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,520
biggest pest that you're going to see in

208
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,440
there is going to be pantry moths

209
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,199
and that is something that you don't

210
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,199
want getting in your

211
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,879
pantry stores so you definitely want to

212
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:27,759
keep on top of it you'll see little

213
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,919
moths flying so then it comes to our

214
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,840
fifth and final step and that is

215
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:35,279
harvesting your mealworms

216
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,800
one of my favorite methods is to feed

217
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,560
them so

218
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,959
they love the potatoes apples and

219
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:44,080
carrots even though their primary food

220
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,399
is their cereal or oatmeal at the bottom

221
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,160
they do really love their potatoes

222
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,640
carrots and apples

223
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,040
and will probably be located right

224
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:55,440
underneath that potato when you go to

225
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,240
pick it up so what i'll do is i'll

226
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,040
remove all the potato and apple slices

227
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,360
out of the container for a day or two

228
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
and then i will add them in on the day

229
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,279
that i'm planning on harvesting some

230
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
mealworm

231
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:12,240
and i'll put them in in the morning and

232
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:15,040
that afternoon when i pick up the potato

233
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:18,000
i find a whole colony of crawling little

234
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:20,480
wormies ready for harvest so i just

235
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,800
knock those into a separate container

236
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,200
and voila i can feed them to the

237
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,320
chickens the quail and any of our other

238
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:27,839
poultry

239
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,480
this is a

240
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:33,120
low-cost high-protein way to supplement

241
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:36,080
your animal's feed we love watching them

242
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:38,560
grow and transform and my kids have made

243
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:41,120
this one of their favorite projects they

244
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,440
love to feed them the apple slices they

245
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,519
love to harvest them they love to feed

246
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:48,800
them to the chickens so it's a great

247
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,600
project for a homesteading family to

248
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:53,760
get this colony started and start having

249
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:55,920
a more affordable supplement for your

250
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,279
chicken treats thank you for watching

251
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,600
we'll see you next time on wholesome

252
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,600
roots
