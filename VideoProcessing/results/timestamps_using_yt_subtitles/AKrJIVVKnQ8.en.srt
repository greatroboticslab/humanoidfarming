in two villages in Zimbabwe school

00:00:09,180 --> 00:00:13,590
attendance in recent years has been

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,680
steadily improving thanks to an IAEA FAO

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:18,660
project drought made it difficult for

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,000
farmers to generate enough income to

8
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,680
send their children to school for about

9
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:27,119
three consecutive years we get the poor

10
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:28,969
rains and do poor harvests so the

11
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,279
impoverished parents could not afford

12
00:00:28,969 --> 00:00:34,950
school fees quite some time to support

13
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:36,840
farmers the IAEA helped the government

14
00:00:34,950 --> 00:00:39,030
introduced a drip irrigation pilot

15
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,970
project that reduces water use by half

16
00:00:39,030 --> 00:00:44,190
using isotopic techniques scientists

17
00:00:41,970 --> 00:00:46,590
calculated the exact amount of water and

18
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,350
fertilizer needed for tomatoes and other

19
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,460
vegetables this allows farmers to save

20
00:00:49,350 --> 00:00:55,739
both of these precious resources in a

21
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:59,370
routine or says result or film from tank

grinding is separation de pombal drip

25
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:11,880
irrigation is also more efficient

26
00:01:08,759 --> 00:01:14,219
leading to more crops adding fertilizer

27
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,549
to the soil also increases the harvest

28
00:01:14,219 --> 00:01:18,630
the situation with food security is

29
00:01:16,549 --> 00:01:21,990
quite greatly improved

30
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:26,670
like for instance where the farmers used

31
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:30,060
to have a yield of says 5 tonnes per

32
00:01:26,670 --> 00:01:31,829
hectare or a 6 tonnes per hectare now it

33
00:01:30,060 --> 00:01:33,990
is almost trebled

34
00:01:31,829 --> 00:01:37,020
that means more food for the children

35
00:01:33,990 --> 00:01:40,170
and more money for their school I can

36
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:43,319
now manage to pay the school fees of my

37
00:01:40,170 --> 00:01:45,209
children from the money I got from the

38
00:01:43,319 --> 00:01:49,349
drip irrigation system

39
00:01:45,209 --> 00:01:52,649
I also improved my my household and I

40
00:01:49,349 --> 00:01:56,159
can also now buy food for my children I

41
00:01:52,649 --> 00:02:00,119
feel happy because my parents bought

42
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:03,679
complete school uniform and stationery

43
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:05,510
for me and I expect to pass with flying

44
00:02:03,679 --> 00:02:08,300
colours at

45
00:02:05,510 --> 00:02:10,760
the end of the a with more crop per drop

46
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:13,940
the education of children in these areas

47
00:02:10,760 --> 00:02:15,800
is safe for now this is a supported

48
00:02:13,940 --> 00:02:17,490
project is also helping farmers

49
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:25,220
elsewhere in Africa
