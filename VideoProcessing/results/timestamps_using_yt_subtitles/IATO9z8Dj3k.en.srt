00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,080
welcome to the ndsu carrington research

3
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,040
extension

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,639
center's organic tour we are standing on

5
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:13,840
the organic ground this is one of two

6
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:16,160
fields we have

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,480
um and this field has been certified

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:20,400
organic since uh

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:22,720
2007 excuse me 16.

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,600
anyway we're we're standing in front of

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:24,960
the wheat flax

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,640
inter crop trial and that's what i want

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:28,160
to talk to you about today now

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,160
intercropping is something that's become

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,679
very popular in most recent years and

16
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,120
particularly the last few

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,040
it's not a new concept although

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,719
intercropping has been done for years

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:39,040
it's been it's being done all around the

20
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,399
world particularly in many nations where

21
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,840
they where farmers are

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,760
not using a lot of inputs and so

23
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:47,039
in particular to also wheat flax

24
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,559
intercropping there's

25
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,199
there's information that goes back to

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,079
the 20s that show farmers in the dakotas

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,320
we're doing this

28
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,079
so it's not new we're not reinventing

29
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:57,760
the wheel but we're learning how to use

30
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:01,280
new technology and new tricks

31
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,079
to make it better intercropping wheat

32
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:04,640
flax

33
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:06,240
ironically as reported in our annual

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:07,840
report in 1991

35
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,360
was looked at in this research center

36
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:12,880
under conventional

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:14,640
plat ground from 1989 to 1991 by dr pat

38
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
carr

39
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,119
this this data showed in the early years

40
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:22,400
in the first couple years we looked at

41
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,640
uh at varying the rates of of

42
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:26,159
and excuse me varying the the role

43
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,479
arrangements and how it was

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,520
seated broadcast and stuff basically the

45
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:31,920
data showed

46
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,720
that it through economic analysis and

47
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,040
other factors

48
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,079
that it didn't pay and there was no

49
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,360
yield advantage

50
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,040
then a couple years later from 90 to 91

51
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,640
it was remodified and it was looked at

52
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:45,439
it from the standpoint of

53
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,520
of varying the seeding rates still not

54
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,960
concise of research although it did show

55
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,240
that in the

56
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,439
in that we in 1990 the flax yielded two

57
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,840
bushels to the acre

58
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,840
and and in 1991 we were getting seven

59
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,920
bushels to acre now that's significant

60
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,520
with showing a very little drop in yield

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,040
on the wheat

62
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:06,159
let's go to 2020. we're very we're

63
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:07,920
revising it again

64
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:09,360
but we're going into using it under

65
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,760
organic production

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,520
now organic flax is one of the crops

67
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:14,160
that we have found in our research out

68
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:16,239
here

69
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,680
that competes very poorly when we

70
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,080
compare it to conventional

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
plot yields many of the other crops such

72
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,760
as wheat and oats and barley

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,319
the yields are fairly comparable

74
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,959
particularly under years that are not

75
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,520
race horse years when conditions are not

76
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,959
as good

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,800
that is one thing that's been proven

78
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:34,400
when conditions are not as good

79
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,319
when we don't have perfect growing

80
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:38,400
conditions organic will be

81
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,160
much more comparable to conventional

82
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,680
plot yields our data shows us that here

83
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,760
from this research center

84
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:45,519
so why why are we looking at that we're

85
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:49,040
revising on the organic loan because

86
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:51,120
organic flax fetches a very high premium

87
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,120
for the organic farmer sometimes up to

88
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,680
30 dollars per bushel

89
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,800
but again as i mentioned we don't get

90
00:02:55,680 --> 00:03:02,319
good yields under our flax

91
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:04,480
and so with that i thought

92
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,080
let's look at it with wheat and have

93
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:06,640
another crop there maybe the weeds will

94
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,319
be

95
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:09,760
will be better so this is where we're at

96
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,560
now um we

97
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:14,480
very simple design this year we have two

98
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,720
varieties in here

99
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,080
fbc dillon a variety that was developed

100
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:20,080
by the farm breeder club from northern

101
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,920
plains sustainable ag society

102
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,280
developed and released that was

103
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,080
developed under organic management

104
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,519
conditions

105
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:30,480
and glenn wheat an ndsu variety that has

106
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,319
been on high quality wheat for a number

107
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,480
of years now it's been replaced by np

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
vit vit pro as terms of the quality

109
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,480
check but still many farmer organic

110
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,640
farmers are planting this variety

111
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,599
then we went to omega flax which is our

112
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,080
yellow flax

113
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,519
which again organic farmers and

114
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:47,200
conventional of course too

115
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:48,560
are growing and getting a premium from

116
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:49,680
but particularly in the organic market

117
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:51,440
that is the variety that

118
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,519
organic farmers like to grow and then

119
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,599
our newest release nd hammond

120
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:56,879
named after dr jim hammond our previous

121
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:59,920
flax breeder

122
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,640
thank you jim for all your hard work so

123
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,159
we have

124
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:06,000
sole of each one of these the wheat is

125
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:06,720
seated as the seeding rate i use on

126
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:10,959
these plots

127
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:13,360
at 1.6 million pure live seed per acre

128
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,959
which it comes to about 110 to 120

129
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,479
pounds or two bushels

130
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:21,840
our flax here is seeded at

131
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,520
60 pounds to the acre and which is the

132
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,000
rate we use in organic production

133
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,120
organic production tends to use higher

134
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:29,280
seeding rates

135
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,720
than conventional doesn't mean that

136
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,080
conventional farming doesn't but we tend

137
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:33,600
to use higher seeding rates because we

138
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:34,639
need more plants for the competition

139
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:36,080
since we're not using

140
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:38,320
synthetic herbicides to control our

141
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:40,400
weeds we're using crop rotation

142
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,520
management and in factors like that to

143
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:43,520
control our weeds

144
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:45,680
now the other treatments we have here

145
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,440
we've we took now again this is fbc dill

146
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,680
and wheat on these two and we used

147
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,360
we used fbc dill and wheat at two thirds

148
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:51,919
of the rate and that flax at two thirds

149
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,840
of the rate

150
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,960
so that means we're at a million plants

151
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:59,280
per acre on the dillon and the flax is

152
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,800
at 43 pounds per acre ironically that's

153
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,080
about the same rates when i look in the

154
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,400
annual report

155
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:06,240
they use the first year they used 65

156
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:07,600
pounds to the acre and 32 pounds regular

157
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:09,199
very very close

158
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
and now again we have the same treatment

159
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,919
with glenn again with

160
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:15,520
the the lower rates two-thirds rates of

161
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,840
each one of the crops

162
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,280
um specifically after this year we'll

163
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,960
we'll fine-tune it

164
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,240
and and then start varying rates and

165
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:24,240
stuff like that but this is our first

166
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,520
proof-of-concept year

167
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,280
now ironically this year as you we look

168
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,400
in this plot here with with the dill and

169
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,880
wheat and the flax

170
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,639
you can hardly see the wheat the flax is

171
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
going to far out favor so the results

172
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,880
are not going to be the same

173
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:40,720
this can be this is due partially to the

174
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,560
drought the very dry conditions we're in

175
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:45,120
but it can also be to confound the issue

176
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:46,960
it can be our previous cover crop here

177
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,479
now we couldn't terminate the cover crop

178
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,840
because it was a rye

179
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,720
mixture with rye turnips um crimson

180
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,600
clover

181
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:57,440
and radishes that was the cover crop

182
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:58,240
because we were so wet last fall with

183
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:00,400
the

184
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:01,840
the the big rainfall and and we could

185
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,440
not terminate the crop so it had to be

186
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:05,520
terminated this spring

187
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:07,039
that can be confounding the issue with

188
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,720
the wheat the cereal crop

189
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:10,479
and that could be why the flax looks so

190
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,360
great if you take a shot and look at

191
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:13,120
this flax

192
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:15,840
this is a plot that has not been

193
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,160
harrowed we can't herald flax anyway

194
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:18,960
and it has not been hand weeded or

195
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:20,880
anything

196
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,479
i think any organic farmer would love to

197
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,479
have a field like this this goes against

198
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
everything i told you where i can't

199
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,560
weeds out compete me but it's it's going

200
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:29,520
to be a very exciting year to see what

201
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,680
happens here

202
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,039
and you know again not a new concept

203
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,720
that's been done forever we're just

204
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,960
revisiting it and trying to find new

205
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:39,360
tools and new varieties how to do this

206
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:40,639
and i ironically i want to read just a

207
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,039
quick verb from

208
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,319
the report that dr pat carr in 1991

209
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,039
annual report

210
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,680
his closing statement he says since it

211
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,800
remains

212
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,800
unclear how wheat flax inner cop inter

213
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,759
crops respond to plant population

214
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:56,720
changes additional research is planned

215
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:58,560
to determine how

216
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,080
inter-crop performance is influenced by

217
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:02,560
lower seeding rates

218
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,560
well dr pat carr you're a visionary just

219
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,720
like dr john gardner was

220
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:07,680
and so we're going to revisit this and

221
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,280
see what happens

222
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,039
we're going to find out ways that we can

223
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:14,160
make it better for your farm

224
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:16,720
so that you can get good returns on your

225
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:18,720
flax and have cleaner flax

226
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,080
and get better profit that's what we're

227
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:27,440
about here at the research area thank

228
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:27,440
you very much
