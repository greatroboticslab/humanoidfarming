  "text": "[Music] do [Music] [Music] good morning my name's scott johnson from the low technology institute and this is part one of a two-part series on home scale grain production and today i need to prepare the soil and plant oats and barley as you can see we've got a field here that was more or less fallow last year so we need to at least knock down this weed load and then plant seeds in it i have tried no-till i haven't had good luck with it the weeds seem to out-compete the the grains i tried to grow so what i do is basically disk the top i use a tiller with going in just an inch or two knocking all this vegetation down planting the seeds in and the seeds then have a good a good head start and are able to over top the weeds so i don't have to use a lot of herbicides or anything like that i am going to fertilize a little bit in this field using horse manure if i'm growing other things i don't i'll talk about each plant a little bit as we go but for now let's get let's get tilling [Music] let's talk real briefly about fertilizer generally speaking uh different types of grain and different types of applications need different amounts of fertilizer for example rye grows really well with almost no fertilizer so i'm growing rye where i grew corn last year without a problem wheat for me i don't fertilize and i grow on a little bit of a restricted diet so to speak because i want really good woody growth for the stems because i use it for thatch you could fertilize a bit more and maybe get a little more yearly i'm not that i don't care that much about that because this was used for wheat last year i'm actually going to put some horse manure on it some well-rotted composted harvest manure i've already tilled it once i'll spread out the horse manure and then i'll till it again and then i'll be ready for seeding i'm going to do the same for my barley and i'm going to do the same for my barley i'm also going to be tilling and putting in field peas which are soup peas or a dried pea that you can then cook into soup because they are a legume they fix nitrogen in the soil so i actually don't have to fertilize them at all and they're not really a grain but i'm talking about them because this is the time that i would plant them this is spring and you might say spring is too late for a wheat and you're right winter wheat is planted in the fall as is rye depends where you live it's different time so you'll want to check with your local extension or your local state agencies for that timing but you definitely want to get it in at least like a month before the first frost so that it has a good time to start growing it's frost hearty but it's nice to get a little bit of time oats barley spring wheat get planted in the spring and so right now this will be oats and so i'm telling this up uh in the spring we're still getting frosts but that's not a big deal or a hindrance i could have tilled this up in the fall and applied my fertilizer that probably would have been preferable and then maybe i would have given little light disking to take down any weeds that had started now when it comes to seeding there's a couple different options um you can broadcast seed broadcast seeding is the traditional way um and what one can do is take a sack or an apron and have their seed in and what you do your seeding rate is driven by your foot steps so for some seating rates you would take a step and throw and then one and step and throw and one and step and throw if you want a denser seating rate then you could throw throw throw throw on each step or even every third step whatever i don't know what a seeding rate would be you would have to experiment on your own to figure that out what i do for laying down my seed is i put down rows and because i do not have a large mechanical cedar i have to use a single row cedar a garden an earthway cedar if you have a multiple cedar good for you i don't and so what i do is i make eight inch rows and so i've got a measuring tape down here and i'm putting down these white poles every eight inches and then i'm going to run the cedar between them and when i look down the the field i see the rest of them i see this exact same setup on the other side and so what's going to happen is i will just take the cedar and run straight down to its partner and that will give me a nice row the reason being rows let me weed a little better because i can differentiate between what is seeded for for grain and what is weeds this is especially important if you're coming off of grass there was grass here before and so this is something i'm gonna have to fight with i find that to be my best um spacing you can experiment and find what works best for you now as far as seeding rate goes i'll talk about that when i get my cedar out here in a minute okay let's talk cedars i don't have a big cedar uh like that goes behind a tractor and has 20 40 60 drills i have this walk behind garden seeder which is not designed for grain so i have to modify it slightly and uh this seeder basically what happens is it turns uh this wheel as you walk this disc in here turns and pulls up seeds and dumps them out down the chute into this drill that's uh plowing its way through the soil and as we'll see in the video coming up but i need to drop about 10 seeds for each foot one revolution of this of this wheel is three feet so basically i need to find one of these discs that's gonna pick up and drop 30 wheat kernels for over three feet over one rotation of this and so basically what i do to figure this out and i already know the answer but um i'm going to do this so you can find for whatever grain you're planting and whatever seeding rate you want so i'm first going to start with the beats okra chard disc this slots right in now i'm going to open up my these are streaker or hulless oats i'm doing hull this out so i don't have to take the hull off which i don't have equipment for we'll talk about that in video number two [Applause] so here we have our oats i'm just gonna drop a handful in here [Applause] okay now now what i do is i set this over a bowl and once it starts dropping i rotate one full rotation so okay so there we go so from the top so that would represent three feet of walking [Music] [Applause] now i take the oats out and i count them approximately 10 20 30 40 50 60 78. that's more than twice as much of what i need almost three times what i need um and so one option i would have and i dump all these seeds out one option i would have to modify this would be to take tape and go right over every other one of these and you push it down right nice and tight and then tear it off so it's not on the back otherwise it gums up the system i would cut that clean and that would reduce my seeding rate by half and i would do that here here uh here and here and then right that would reduce the seeding rate and it would spread them out a little bit that's one option or i can try another one so this is um cabbage onions endive turnips discs you can also buy blank discs and then use a heated metal probe to create your own dishes little little dish cups to catch this and maybe someday i will do that since i do do a lot of grain make my life a little easier all right let's see how many this does [Music] foot it's doing almost none i can see them dropping in there it's almost none because this disc is too small so that doesn't work right so it's basically trial and error so let's talk seeding rates when you look on an agricultural extension or some website about growing wheat it's going to tell you how much seed they put in the big machines they sew at something like 80 to 120 pounds per acre i'm not doing acres how many pounds right so i don't use that what i use is um per square foot how many seeds or because i do eight inch spacing of all of my rows um i just do it by how many seeds per foot i know for wheat i like about 10 seeds purse per linear foot on eight inch spacing that gives me like 14 seeds per per square foot and what that does is it's like a quarter or a half of the recommended tilling rate uh seeding rate for industrial wheat because what i want is tillering so usually an industrial wheat you have one seed you have one plant well tillering that one plant senses that has space around it so it sends up multiple plants so from one seed i get multiple heads it's more seeds i get more return on the seeds i invest and also it works well in my application i'm not sewing as densely i'm not fertilizing so it's nice to have that one larger stronger plant rather than a whole bunch of small plants so right now i'm seeing oats i could still till at a similar rate but i think i'm actually going to over seed because i have a little more oat seed than i do space so i might actually just use this one another another modification you can do is take a piece of tape and go right here so the cup is still open but it's reduced and if i do that that will somewhat reduce the seeding rate and i'll have to test it to figure out what that is but play with tape and play with your seeding discs and you can usually find something that is close to the seeding rate you want and if you don't know what your seeding rate should be do that's what i did my first year i grew some at the industrial seeding rate at the suggested rate i did some at half that i did some at a quarter of that and i did some at double that and what worked best for me was half the industrial rate so i just did it by experimentation i highly recommend that approach when we're dealing with small scale because the people who knew how to do small scale wheat growing are either dead or there's actually a lot of people around the world who still grow wheat this way but they probably broadcast i don't know how many small scale farmers in less developed parts of the world actually use a cedar i imagine most of them just use a broadcast method which is a little easier now i'm going to do is line up with my cedar in this first space and walk down uh to its partner down at the far end and then and when i'm walking i focus far away from me i focus on the far end of the field and that lets me keep a straight line i'm planting these at a depth of about three quarters of an inch to an inch if you notice as i walk i drag the forward in this case my right foot and and deposit a little soil over the line that i've just sewn that helps bury the grain a little bit so the birds don't get it all and then when i finish a route i take out the post so that it's easy for me to see that i'm just headed for the next one that's available and i don't mind trampling the ground because that would be done often after seeding in like ancient egypt they would run their sheep or cows over to trample the soil in that's no problem after each pass i refill and here you can see the result of this type of seeding here's last year's rye and here's last year's wheat you can see there is some uh some competing weeds coming up here but because these are spaced at eight inch intervals i can walk my high wheel hoe down them and knock all this down once and then this is gonna grow up to be this high it'll blot out all other weeds and this was prepared just the same way i planted the oats so you can see the nice the nice results this this has well thanks so much for watching part one part two we'll cover harvesting and threshing i think we're actually gonna do a part three on grinding because that deserves its own episode that won't come out till later this summer so if you want to be sure to see it hit the subscribe button below if you want to do a little more hands-on if you'd like some hands-on experience doing this we will offer classes this summer on harvesting and processing your own wheat so check out our website lowtechinstitute.org events and you can see when those classes come up you can also sign up to our listserv to make sure that you are alerted when we have new classes up we'd love to put these things out for free and we're going to continue to do that but it does take time and resources from our staff to put them together so if you're in a position to join the community of people supporting us please consider going over to patreon.com low tech institute to find out more we have membership starting at as low as three dollars a month and not only does that help us out financially but also psychologically to have have folks helping us out so if you're in a position please do consider supporting us we really appreciate it um and we're already looking forward to parts two and three of this video so thanks for watching and take care of yourselves [Music] [Music] [Music] you",
