  "text": "Garlic is widely cultivated in California, especially in the Gilroy region. Known as the garlic capital of the world with its dry climate, fertile soil, and advanced farming practices, California has become the largest garlic producing state in the US. Garlic is not only an essential culinary ingredient, but also a high-v value agricultural product, contributing hundreds of millions of dollars to the US economy each year through both domestic consumption and export. Despite advances in agricultural technology, garlic harvesting is still primarily done by hand. Immigrant laborers with swift and resilient hands bend under the scorching sun to pull each bulb from the ground, clean it, and sort it on site. These skilled workers are an indispensable part of the agricultural supply chain, playing a vital role in maintaining the quality and volume of garlic production across the United States. [Music] Planting garlic using modern machinery has significantly improved efficiency and reduced manual labor. Across the vast fields of California, specialized garlic planters are used to evenly distribute garlic cloves into wellprepared soil beds. These machines precisely control the spacing and depth of each clove, ensuring optimal conditions for growth. Thanks to this technology, multiple hectares of garlic can be planted within just a few hours, saving both time and labor costs while maintaining consistency and productivity in large-scale farming operations. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Under the scorching sun of California's central valley, known as the garlic capital of America, thousands of immigrant workers bend over rows of soil, skillfully pulling garlic bulbs from the [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] earth. While some large farms have adopted mechanized harvesting systems, most small and medium farms still rely heavily on hand harvesting. Garlic is a delicate crop that can be easily damaged if not handled carefully, making manual labor [Music] [Music] essential. These farm workers are primarily immigrants from countries like Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and Honduras. Many have fled poverty and hardship, crossing borders in search of a better life. Most lack legal documentation or work temporarily under the H2A agricultural visa program. They often live in crowded makeshift housing and save every penny to send back to their families. [Music] Harvesting garlic by hand is grueling work. Laborers start at dawn and work until evening, constantly bending, pulling garlic from the soil, brushing off dirt, trimming roots and leaves, and placing the bulbs into large crates. It demands stamina, speed, and precision. Wages typically range from $14 to $18 per hour, DAR, depending on the state and the farm's policies. Skilled and fast workers can earn up to $20 $20 per hour, but at the cost of physical exhaustion, back pain, and blistered hands. [Music] Despite modest wages, after deducting housing, transportation, health care, and remittances, little is left for savings. Their lives are quiet, resilient, and filled with sacrifice. Each garlic bulb they harvest represents not just a crop, but a drop of sweat, a dream, and a hope for a better future. Though rarely featured in headlines, these laborers are the silent heroes of American agriculture. Nameless hands that cultivate and gather the land's finest fruits. [Music] Heat. Heat. [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
