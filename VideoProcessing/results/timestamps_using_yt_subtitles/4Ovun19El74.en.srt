1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,760
plant friends if you are looking for

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:05,759
plenty book recommendations

3
00:00:03,760 --> 00:00:07,759
i've got you covered on today's video

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:10,480
blue pengrow

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,920
youtube show planned friends i have read

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,960
so many good

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,800
planty books in 2020 uh

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,199
for a combination of reasons some of

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,720
them being me wanting to continue my

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,800
education and research

11
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,560
and some of them being that i have

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,320
needed an escape more than ever and i've

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,720
needed to feel connected to

14
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,000
nature and plants more than ever um and

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,760
i've found some really great books that

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,840
i wanted to share with you

17
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:36,000
so i'm gonna break down eight books that

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:37,760
i've read in 2020 that have had a really

19
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,200
significant impact on me

20
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:40,640
if you like this type of video let me

21
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:42,239
know in the comments because i've

22
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,079
certainly read more than eight books but

23
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,760
i'm just kind of starting with

24
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,120
the creme de la creme of my reading and

25
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,879
i was thinking maybe i could break them

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,879
down in different genres

27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
but speaking of genres this collection

28
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,680
of eight books really spans

29
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,520
a variety of genres and styles of book

30
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:59,280
so i really hope that within the eight

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
there's a little something for everyone

32
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:01,600
to help everyone keep blooming and

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:05,600
growing

34
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,720
okay book number one the overstory by

35
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
richard powers

36
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,560
this book might be the best book i've

37
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,799
ever read in my whole life

38
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
and it doesn't make any sense because i

39
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,640
never read fiction i'm a huge self-help

40
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,439
reader i'm a huge educational book

41
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,400
reader

42
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,960
and this book like captured my heart and

43
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,720
spirit

44
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,600
and soul in such a way so richard powers

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,880
he won

46
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,880
the pulitzer prize for it

47
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:32,400
and this came out several years ago i'm

48
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
totally late to the game

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,439
um but there was like a span of a week

50
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,960
where

51
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
like three different people recommended

52
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,040
it to me and so i finally picked it up

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,960
it's

54
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,360
an investment of a read plant friends

55
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:46,159
but i can't suggest it enough

56
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,600
it's a fictional book that intertwines

57
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:48,960
five or six different stories of

58
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,799
different people who are completely

59
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,799
unrelated and

60
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,079
they're all about plants every person

61
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,520
comes from a different background

62
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:58,000
a different experience but they're all

63
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,240
tied spiritually to plants in some way

64
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:02,240
and the way that richard powers

65
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,560
orchestrates this book

66
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:06,960
the inter the intertwining of the

67
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,679
different characters and the deep

68
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:11,599
commitment and um connection that all of

69
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
the characters have

70
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:16,239
i felt so seen as a reader like i could

71
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,400
not put this book down

72
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:20,239
and the way that the book is organized

73
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:21,840
is the beginning the chapters are much

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,520
longer and then towards the end the

75
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,520
chapters get shorter and shorter and the

76
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,040
style of the book kind of changes

77
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,840
um i would read a chapter a morning

78
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:32,720
so this was the way i woke up um every

79
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,480
morning i read

80
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,000
only one chapter and sometimes you want

81
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:38,319
to read more but it was just kind of how

82
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,239
i did it i let myself just read

83
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:44,239
and that was successful for the first

84
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:45,920
half of the book which is the more like

85
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,680
traditional form book and then as the

86
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,440
book kind of takes off

87
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:50,959
i couldn't put the book down i have

88
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:53,040
never experienced this reading a book

89
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,200
before but i would be in my bed

90
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,239
late at night billy would be asleep next

91
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:58,000
to me with

92
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:59,680
my cell phone flashlight reading the

93
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:00,640
book because i literally couldn't put it

94
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,280
down

95
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:04,239
so i really like this book and if you

96
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:05,920
like plants

97
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,440
if you feel connected to nature

98
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,040
especially trees

99
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:10,560
especially if you have ever seen

100
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:11,680
redwoods before or if you have a

101
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,879
curiosity around

102
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:17,280
redwoods oh my gosh try this book i know

103
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:20,000
it's an investment of a read it's

104
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,360
a big book i am not a reader i do not

105
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:23,360
read big books like this but

106
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,879
really it's totally worth it so i hope

107
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,319
you try it and enjoy it

108
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,640
number two catalog of unabashed

109
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,640
gratitude unabashed right yeah unabashed

110
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:35,120
gratitude by ross gay

111
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,879
i found ross gay um during the black

112
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:37,200
lives matter movement because he wrote

113
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,280
this

114
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,799
unbelievably beautiful poem about eric

115
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,200
garner and

116
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,720
his time in the horticultural department

117
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:46,640
if you listened to

118
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,400
the episode i did called growing

119
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,280
together i read the poem at the end of

120
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,760
it

121
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,680
so i was so taken by this poem and i'm

122
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,959
i've never bought a book of poetry

123
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,799
before

124
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,799
but i was so taken by this poem that i

125
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:02,159
started researching ross gay and

126
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:05,519
he actually is this gardener and poet

127
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,760
beautiful prolific poet and he's got a

128
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,319
bunch of poems that are all about plants

129
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,120
and so

130
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:14,720
i ordered this book um a catalog of

131
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:17,840
unabashed gratitude it has

132
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,280
20 or more poems in it and once again

133
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,840
just like the overstory

134
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:23,360
lately i've been starting every morning

135
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,800
with my cup of coffee

136
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,759
my plants and a poem by ross gay so i

137
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,240
just like say

138
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:32,320
a poem a day by ross gay keeps the blues

139
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:35,759
away

140
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:39,759
um he writes with such whimsy

141
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:41,759
and depth and he makes me like poetry

142
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,520
and i'm not a poetry girl you know he

143
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:47,199
brings like a smile to my face

144
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:49,600
the ode to unbuttoning my shirt and um

145
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:50,960
i particularly really liked the poem to

146
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,520
the mulberry tree

147
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,600
um and obviously the title poem of the

148
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,080
book catalog of unabashed gratitude had

149
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,400
me

150
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,520
a little weepy and with in my morning

151
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,560
cup of coffee

152
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,680
he's so real but also there's like so

153
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,720
much hope in his

154
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:08,720
writing and um also he's just a gardener

155
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:10,639
and nature and plants show up in his

156
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,720
poems in really beautiful ways so

157
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
i can't recommend this enough moving on

158
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:17,360
to number three

159
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,160
the nature fix this was recommended to

160
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,800
me by

161
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:21,919
my teacher um in my new york botanical

162
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:25,039
garden

163
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:26,560
horticultural therapy class this book

164
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,880
has been the answer to my prayers

165
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:31,919
because i in 2020

166
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,479
am starting to realize like how screen

167
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,400
addicted

168
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,240
our generation and society is and it's

169
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:37,120
really starting to freak me out and i

170
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:39,120
think

171
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:40,160
my mission on in this world is to like

172
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:42,160
help people connect

173
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:43,919
to plants because also they need to

174
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,400
disconnect from screens and that's like

175
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,759
a big

176
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:49,039
mission for bloom and grow and as i like

177
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,880
really start to understand this on a

178
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,479
deeper level i start getting more

179
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:55,680
curious about

180
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:58,560
about the science behind why

181
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,319
we feel so connected to plants and why

182
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,400
plants do make people happy

183
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:04,080
and this book is it so this woman

184
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,160
florence williams

185
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,280
she spent two years researching the

186
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:08,960
people plant connection

187
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,560
and she meets with all i mean all of

188
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,639
these studies that i'm reading she meets

189
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,840
with like all of the scientists

190
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,039
and breaks down studies and

191
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:20,240
and really um captures a lot of the

192
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,639
struggle of

193
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:24,639
american but i think international um

194
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:25,039
the international struggle of like go go

195
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,759
go

196
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:29,199
and being stuck with uh stuck in like a

197
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,720
really crazy schedule

198
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,479
the biggest thing for me with this book

199
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,080
is actually not learning about plants

200
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:37,280
but learning about sound

201
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:40,960
she has a whole chapter on understanding

202
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:43,919
how sounds affect us and how little um

203
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,400
preserved nature sounds there are in the

204
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,840
world

205
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,759
because streets are gonna interfere with

206
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,520
sound so there are only a few places in

207
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:55,039
the states that still you can go

208
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,039
and not hear a plane or a um

209
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:01,280
car or have um light come in you know so

210
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,639
that has made me really think about

211
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:05,759
sound differently

212
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:08,240
and my eyes are like way more open

213
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,280
to like what i hear that's artificial

214
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,039
and that's natural

215
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,039
and i appreciate the crickets outside a

216
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,240
lot more so highly recommend the nature

217
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:16,639
fix

218
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:18,400
next up speaking of the nature fix

219
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,919
forest bathing so this was

220
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:21,919
one of the first books i read in the

221
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:24,319
quarantine i was feeling super

222
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,599
disconnected to nature super anxious

223
00:07:24,319 --> 00:07:27,759
obviously i was um

224
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,560
quarantining in new york city in like

225
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,240
the epicenter of the pandemic

226
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,000
and i was googling the concept of forest

227
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,440
bathing because i noticed that whenever

228
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,039
i would come to phila farm

229
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,199
i would go for a walk in the forest with

230
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:40,960
my mom and it was just the most amazing

231
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,720
experience

232
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,160
i heard this concept of forest bathing i

233
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:45,440
started googling it and i found this

234
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:47,919
book so it's by dr

235
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,199
king lee who is a forest medicine

236
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,160
researcher in japan

237
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:53,840
and in japan forest bathing or shinrin

238
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:56,080
yoku is the practice

239
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,879
it's a medicinal practice that the

240
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,199
japanese

241
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:00,319
culture has been practicing for a while

242
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,560
and there are like

243
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:03,759
hospital and government approved forest

244
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,639
medicine centers

245
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,960
in forests so anyway he goes over not

246
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:12,800
only his studies behind

247
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,960
he's taken like subjects and

248
00:08:12,800 --> 00:08:16,479
put them through this forest bathing and

249
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,319
it like lowers their blood pressure and

250
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:20,000
their stress and their hormones and it

251
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,800
increases like your ability to

252
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:24,720
fight cancer it's crazy um but he also

253
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,080
makes really practical ways to do forest

254
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,800
bathing even if you're not by

255
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,240
forest so for me i've started we've left

256
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:31,360
the city i've started walking in the

257
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,120
forest every day

258
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,880
but also like he talks about diffusing

259
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,159
essential oils and so i've started

260
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:40,320
diffusing

261
00:08:36,159 --> 00:08:42,640
um tree oils in my house uh

262
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,040
hinoki and basically everything he

263
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:47,519
suggests in this book i bought

264
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:49,600
so um if you're interested in getting

265
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:52,959

266
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:56,640

275
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,240
i think was the first time we met she

276
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:17,680

277
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:19,519

it's got so much of her in it she's got

286
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,440
a really cool illustration style

287
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:39,440

288
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,839
their plants and all the illustrations

289
00:09:39,440 --> 00:09:42,959

291
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,120
opportunity to get off your screen

and color so if you're interested i

293
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,399

suggest coloring with aisha i'm so proud

295
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,000

297
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:56,240
that you've been in the plant space for

298
00:09:55,120 --> 00:09:58,000
a while it's fun to see

299
00:09:56,240 --> 00:09:59,600
how everyone's blooming and growing so

300
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,720
very proud of aisha

301
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,519
next up farming while black by leah

302
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,839
penniman

303
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:07,200
this was recommended to me by cola b

304
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:09,600
talking when she came on

305
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,959
the blooming girl radio podcast to talk

306
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,640
about historic black

307
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,160
plant parents basically we had an

308
00:10:12,640 --> 00:10:16,160
amazing conversation

309
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,160
she recommended this book leah pennamon

310
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,640
founded soul fire farm

311
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,480
and this book is all about the black

312
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:24,800
experience being connected and

313
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,560
disconnected to cultivating land

314
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:32,240
and farming land um and it's actually

315
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:35,839
kind of a book about how to farm land

316
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:38,720
but for me it was extremely informative

317
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:41,920
and in my journey to examine my

318
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:44,160
privilege and try and understand

319
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,120
the black experience more and just open

320
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:47,839
my eyes

321
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,040
to more which i need to do and need to

322
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:50,640
do the work for

323
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,480
this was really helpful and i highly

324
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:53,920
recommend even if you're not a farmer

325
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:54,720
just getting the book and reading the

326
00:10:53,920 --> 00:10:57,760
intro

327
00:10:54,720 --> 00:11:00,079
leah pennamon is so smart

328
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,880
and writes so interestingly and

329
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,000
listening to her

330
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:07,120
say you know food deserts

331
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:10,880
can be called a food apart apartheid

332
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,720
um that really like struck and

333
00:11:10,880 --> 00:11:15,120
has caused me to like really want to

334
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,959
examine that and food deserts and

335
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:19,040
and food injustice and the systemic

336
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:19,360
issue we've got going on in our country

337
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,440
so

338
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,760
if you're interested in learning more

339
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:24,880
check this book out

340
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,839
two more books and then we're going to

341
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,480
be done another planned friend of mine

342
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,800
danae

343
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:33,920
horst from folia collective launched

344
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,519
house plants for all in the pandemic so

345
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,120
a lot of influencers and a lot of my

346
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,360
plant friends have house plant care

347
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,760
books out on the market but what i love

348
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:42,959
about this book house plants for all is

349
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,440
it's more of a book about

350
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:47,120
styling and danae breaks down different

351
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,760
environment profiles

352
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,519
if you have a sunny room a humid room a

353
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,200
dark room and then she shows you the

354
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,200
different plants that you should

355
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:56,880
put in those rooms and how to style them

356
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,680
and gives you care advice

357
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,040
for those specific rooms so it's a style

358
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:02,720
of book that i feel like isn't on the

359
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,600
market these days and it's super

360
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:06,079
creative

361
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,120
i'm so proud of danae um and also the

362
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:09,360
cool thing about it

363
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,360
it's it's like kind of small it's a

364
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:13,600
perfect coffee table type book and it's

365
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,440
laid out it's a super easy read

366
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:18,160
um so i think it's really giftable for

367
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:21,760
the holiday season so check that out

368
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:22,639
and last but not least a family guide to

369
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,240
terrariums

370
00:12:22,639 --> 00:12:26,079
i'm surprised that i'm recommending this

371
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,800
but i came across this book

372
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:30,399
um because of a recent episode of the

373
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,360
bloom and girl radio podcast

374
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,279
indoor plant projects for kids and the

375
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:37,760
podcast episode is all about the fact

376
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,320
that kids are indoors more than ever

377
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:41,760
parents are becoming teachers teachers

378
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,519
are having to teach virtually

379
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,920
it's this crazy time classrooms look

380
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,320
different so how can we

381
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:49,760
set up kids for success by incorporating

382
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,240
indoor garden projects with them

383
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,600
to learn science and also just like

384
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:55,440
disconnect from screens

385
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,040
it was a great episode if you have a kid

386
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,320
that's home virtually learning but

387
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,160
anyway patricia

388
00:12:58,320 --> 00:13:02,800
bouzou launched this book a family guide

389
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:05,200
to terrariums and it's freaking awesome

390
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,560
so if you have a kid i would suggest

391
00:13:05,200 --> 00:13:09,360
checking this out

392
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:10,959

393
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,560

394
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,079
that you can make with kids of like all

395
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,959
different sizes and like levels of

396
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:17,440
difficulty

397
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:19,360
but the beginning of the book like is

398
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:21,839

399
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,519
all the different components of soil um

400
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:25,360
when she tells you about

401
00:13:23,519 --> 00:13:27,279
water in your terrarium she talks about

402
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,880

00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:52,920
bookstore.com

416
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,120

417
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:56,000
bookstore.com is a way for you to buy

418
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,160

so they um support local bookshops

422
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:05,279
through the sales of the books

423
00:14:03,440 --> 00:14:06,720
it's a really interesting business i

424
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,040
think it's still in its beta

425
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,639

426
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:12,000

434
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:27,199
notes and you buy the book a portion of

that purchase goes directly to bloom

436
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:29,920

00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,760
um support bloom and grow as long as
