1
00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,160
hello today we are going to look in on

2
00:00:03,300 --> 00:00:07,379
the African night crawlers and I'm going

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:11,400
to discuss the 10 things that I learned

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:14,040
last year that uh probably I will not

5
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,139
repeat in the future

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:17,580
so as we're going through here you can

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,600
see I've got a

8
00:00:17,580 --> 00:00:24,500
nice crop of really nice huge African

9
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,500
night crawlers here

10
00:00:24,539 --> 00:00:27,539
um who don't want to be cute for the

11
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:29,039
camera

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:30,539
but what we're going to do is we're

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,300
going to kind of go through things here

14
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,960
and uh while I'm talking I'll just you

15
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:39,840
know Yammer on so I would say the number

16
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,040
one thing that I learned this year is

17
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:42,899
that

18
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,239
um too many worm bins

19
00:00:42,899 --> 00:00:48,840
at one point in time I think I had

20
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:52,980
something like 23 worm bins

21
00:00:48,840 --> 00:00:54,719
and quite honestly that is too much I uh

22
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:57,239
that's you know more than I can

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,539
comfortably take care of

24
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:01,860
um in a week or what have you so you may

25
00:01:00,539 --> 00:01:06,299
have noticed that I have started

26
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:07,979
limiting my bins and that I am slowly

27
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,580
you know getting things down these are

28
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:13,500
not worms these are pieces of bonsai

29
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:15,060
um slowly started reducing the number of

30
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:16,920
bins

31
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:19,740
uh just to make it a little bit easier

32
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,320
for myself it was getting just a little

33
00:01:19,740 --> 00:01:24,479
bit too crazy

34
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,400
so I have been coming in and adding

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,200
about a gallon of water a week

36
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:30,299
and um

37
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,939
it still looks like it could totally use

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,500
some more so we will add more at the end

39
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:36,119
here

40
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,460
just going to keep going through to see

41
00:01:36,119 --> 00:01:41,340
if there's any food or Bedding left and

42
00:01:38,460 --> 00:01:43,320
it looks like they've taken you know and

43
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:45,000
eaten everything that I've given them

44
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:47,820
it's a little hard to tell if they've

45
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:51,840
eaten the um

46
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:53,939
manure but uh from the looks of it

47
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,560
uh yeah I can't tell

48
00:01:53,939 --> 00:01:58,320
if anybody knows how to tell the

49
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,420
difference between worm castings and uh

50
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:05,340
manure let me know

51
00:02:00,420 --> 00:02:07,320
so I would say the second thing is that

52
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:10,619
um worms can eat meat and that was not

53
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:15,420
in this bin it was in a mixed species

54
00:02:10,619 --> 00:02:18,180
bin worms can eat meat however

55
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,520
uh in the process of eating all that

56
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:23,220
meat they did attract a crap ton of

57
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,640
flies I will put an insert of pictures

58
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,920
and I would say after two months of not

59
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,959
feeding meat to that bin I am still

60
00:02:28,920 --> 00:02:33,420
struggling to get all of the flies out

61
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,940
of the basement and if I was to ever do

62
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,980
it again I'm telling you I would only do

63
00:02:35,940 --> 00:02:41,819
it in a super deep bin

64
00:02:37,980 --> 00:02:43,860
and I would bury that meat very very

65
00:02:41,819 --> 00:02:44,519
deep

66
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:48,840
um

67
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:50,160
yeah so I I have proof of concept but

68
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:52,620
I'm not going to say that that is

69
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:54,900
something that I would do

70
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,120
um frequently

71
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,360
you know at all

72
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,940
all right so number three

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:05,700
um I think I've gone out of my way to

74
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:09,060
not spend a lot of money on my worm bin

75
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:11,400
but then I go back and I spend money on

76
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:14,519
the garden in the way of coconut choir

77
00:03:11,400 --> 00:03:16,440
perlite soil amendments

78
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,860
and it just hit me if you saw my most

79
00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,879
recent video about uh ways to help your

80
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,220
garden

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,659
um I will link that video at the end but

82
00:03:23,220 --> 00:03:26,280
basically what I've started doing is

83
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:27,780
I've started adding some of my soil

84
00:03:26,280 --> 00:03:29,340
amendments that are organic that are

85
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:30,300
going to take months and months to break

86
00:03:29,340 --> 00:03:32,940
down

87
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:35,819
and I'm adding them to the worm bedding

88
00:03:32,940 --> 00:03:40,799
and that way the worm bends

89
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:42,840
can uh work over all of that stuff and

90
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:45,840
then it'll actually be ready by the time

91
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:47,519
my garden needs it you know three or

92
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:50,519
four months from now

93
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:53,700
so I am spending more money on the worms

94
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:56,879
than I used to I'm still you know

95
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:59,819
recycling all of my shipping boxes by

96
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,659
feeding them to the worms but I have

97
00:03:59,819 --> 00:04:05,459
started adding you know some more things

98
00:04:02,659 --> 00:04:08,580
that I don't normally do in the way of

99
00:04:05,459 --> 00:04:10,140
like azomite and things like that but if

100
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:11,760
you add them to the worm bin then you

101
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,239
don't need to really add as much to the

102
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:18,780
Garden later so I am spending more money

103
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:20,340
but hopefully saving money later so

104
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:21,900
number four

105
00:04:20,340 --> 00:04:23,160
um one of the only bins that was

106
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,759
actually

107
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:29,580
uh impacted by my my trip my faded trip

108
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:32,040
was that these African night crawlers

109
00:04:29,580 --> 00:04:34,020
and I purchased more because I lost you

110
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:36,900
know most of my African night crawlers

111
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:39,300
and what I've discovered is that worms

112
00:04:36,900 --> 00:04:43,020
can go a very long time without having

113
00:04:39,300 --> 00:04:46,919
new food but what they cannot do without

114
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:49,020
is moisture and uh our house sitter you

115
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:51,540
know was kind of on the bubble as to

116
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,940
whether or not they wanted to

117
00:04:51,540 --> 00:04:55,620
you know manage any worms so I was like

118
00:04:53,940 --> 00:04:56,460
no no no you don't have to mess with the

119
00:04:55,620 --> 00:04:57,360
worms

120
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,639
um

121
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,199
so that was part of the deal and then

122
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,300
when we got stuck over there there

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,300
wasn't anybody to come in and actually

124
00:05:03,300 --> 00:05:08,340
take care of the African night crawlers

125
00:05:05,300 --> 00:05:11,040
uh when they needed moisture and so I

126
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:13,800
did have quite the die off so they can

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:16,080
go without food no problem moisture

128
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,540
that's the deal breaker that they cannot

129
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,280
do without

130
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:22,680
so now that we've gone through all of

131
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,060
this I'm gonna looks like we might have

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:26,520
to harvest this the next time we're

133
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:29,400
getting pretty full

134
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,220
yeah there's really nothing left

135
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:34,800
okay so the sixth thing is that slow

136
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:37,500
food fast food might actually have more

137
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,180
to do with the chemical makeup of the

138
00:05:37,500 --> 00:05:42,600
food than it has to do with the Frozen

139
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:45,180
not frozen fibrous not fibrous and

140
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,460
things like that in my bin I have

141
00:05:45,180 --> 00:05:49,620
experienced the slowest food it was

142
00:05:47,460 --> 00:05:53,280
being cranberries which you would think

143
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:57,240
are soft and Squishy nope uh 10 months

144
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:59,880
Ginger even pre-frozen nine months

145
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,740
pineapple even though it was frozen it

146
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,780
took six months and then of course

147
00:06:01,740 --> 00:06:06,720
apples something that everybody feeds

148
00:06:03,780 --> 00:06:08,400
their bin take about four months even if

149
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:10,500
they're frozen for the worms to eat them

150
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,360
all

151
00:06:10,500 --> 00:06:13,500
okay I'm gonna give them some paper

152
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,479
bedding

153
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:17,100
this is my normal prepared bedding

154
00:06:15,479 --> 00:06:19,340
that's been sitting here for a couple of

155
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:19,340
months

156
00:06:26,340 --> 00:06:31,919
um then I'm going to add some of the

157
00:06:29,100 --> 00:06:34,979
manure here the seventh thing that

158
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:38,220
basically I found out grit may not be

159
00:06:34,979 --> 00:06:40,919
necessary but it might just slow down

160
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:43,620
how fast the worms are able to consume

161
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,199
the food the bin that I had no grit in

162
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:50,160
seemed to thrive quite well but I didn't

163
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:54,120
have a twin bin and so maybe it could

164
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:57,300
have done better I don't know but uh the

165
00:06:54,120 --> 00:07:00,240
no grit worked but you know was it the

166
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:03,479
best choice not really because I do add

167
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:07,620
grit to the rest of my worm bins

168
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:10,199
okay so that's about a gallon of the uh

169
00:07:07,620 --> 00:07:12,060
composted cow manure

170
00:07:10,199 --> 00:07:14,300
I'm gonna put that over here on this

171
00:07:12,060 --> 00:07:14,300
side

172
00:07:16,020 --> 00:07:20,460
and uh for the eighth thing that I

173
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,860
really kind of came to the conclusion is

174
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:25,860
that me having a worm channel has made

175
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,500
me a better worm farmer everybody who

176
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:31,080
watches is not newbies I have a lot of

177
00:07:28,500 --> 00:07:32,940
people who have maybe even three four

178
00:07:31,080 --> 00:07:34,620
five times more experience with worms

179
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:37,380
than I do

180
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:40,620
and I just have this channel to kind of

181
00:07:37,380 --> 00:07:42,539
document my process in becoming a worm

182
00:07:40,620 --> 00:07:45,300
farmer and it's really really helpful

183
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,400
that people do comment and give me ideas

184
00:07:45,300 --> 00:07:49,919
like hey maybe this is your problem or

185
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,259
maybe you could do this or I've had good

186
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:54,660
luck with this and honestly it's made me

187
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:56,880
a much better worm farmer with you know

188
00:07:54,660 --> 00:07:57,599
without that feedback I probably would

189
00:07:56,880 --> 00:07:59,819
be

190
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,800
not as good as I am today

191
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:04,340
okay next we're gonna get some of my

192
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:04,340
worm Chow

193
00:08:07,139 --> 00:08:10,380
I'm probably gonna give them about two

194
00:08:09,060 --> 00:08:13,139
cups here

195
00:08:10,380 --> 00:08:14,940
kind of scruff it in with the

196
00:08:13,139 --> 00:08:18,500
the top of the

197
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,500
the bedding the paper bedding here

198
00:08:19,740 --> 00:08:24,620
I can put up on the screen what this is

199
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:24,620
made out of

200
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:28,680
and one of the other things that I've

201
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:31,440
discovered number nine is that there's

202
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:34,680
not just one way to be successful in

203
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:36,479
your worm farming there are no absolutes

204
00:08:34,680 --> 00:08:39,360
um there are too many variables for you

205
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,000
to say absolutely this has to happen my

206
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:44,219
African night crawlers have to be in a

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,440
vermi bag or a urban worm bag or

208
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:48,480
something similar because they escape I

209
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:51,660
live on a busy road the vibrations drive

210
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:53,160
them a bit nuts and so without that my

211
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,160
African night crawlers would be all over

212
00:08:53,160 --> 00:08:58,740
the floor and would be worm jerky we

213
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,200
know people that are on my Channel or

214
00:08:58,740 --> 00:09:03,959
have other channels that just have uh

215
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,339
African nightcrawlers in open bins and

216
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:06,420
they're perfectly fine they don't try

217
00:09:05,339 --> 00:09:08,279
and Escape

218
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:10,680
uh you know I think it's the vibrations

219
00:09:08,279 --> 00:09:14,640
that are doing it in my case but there's

220
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,320
no perfect way to do a worm bin and so I

221
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,899
have learned that there are many ways to

222
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:21,240
be successful and there are also many

223
00:09:18,899 --> 00:09:23,640
ways to fail

224
00:09:21,240 --> 00:09:25,320
okay so let's get them a little bit of

225
00:09:23,640 --> 00:09:27,540
water

226
00:09:25,320 --> 00:09:29,100
I'm gonna put that right along the edge

227
00:09:27,540 --> 00:09:32,100
where the

228
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:34,800
um heating pad is it seems that I'm

229
00:09:32,100 --> 00:09:36,180
holding moisture really well every place

230
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,440
else in the bin

231
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,440
except for there

232
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,080
but I am going to give them a little bit

233
00:09:42,420 --> 00:09:45,080
all the way around

234
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:50,519
we're kind of having a warm spell again

235
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:54,060
so you never know what's going to happen

236
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,440
okay and so then oops

237
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:57,000
I'm also going to give them some

238
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,399
vegetables

239
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:00,600
they haven't had any in a while and you

240
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:02,459
know

241
00:10:00,600 --> 00:10:06,360
variety is the spice of life I wouldn't

242
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:08,519
want them to uh get bored

243
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:12,380
my potatoes are starting to chit already

244
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:15,600
I might have a problem there

245
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:18,180
but there's you know

246
00:10:15,600 --> 00:10:20,220
probably five pounds of African night

247
00:10:18,180 --> 00:10:23,519
crawlers in here and I look in on this

248
00:10:20,220 --> 00:10:26,160
bin and feed them actual food

249
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,380
about once a month even though I do come

250
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,899
in here and uh

251
00:10:28,380 --> 00:10:34,200
give them

252
00:10:30,899 --> 00:10:37,140
worm Chow every single week and then the

253
00:10:34,200 --> 00:10:39,779
10th thing that I have learned is that

254
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:42,120
having a full-time job and a channel is

255
00:10:39,779 --> 00:10:44,820
very hard but it is totally worth it

256
00:10:42,120 --> 00:10:46,140
when my day job is driving me nuts and

257
00:10:44,820 --> 00:10:49,079
it does

258
00:10:46,140 --> 00:10:51,899
um I can come home change gears and hang

259
00:10:49,079 --> 00:10:54,120
out with you guys and my worms and

260
00:10:51,899 --> 00:10:56,100
everything seems a little bit brighter

261
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,920
and a little bit better

262
00:10:56,100 --> 00:11:00,480
so if you liked the video about my

263
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:02,640
African nightcrawlers I have a playlist

264
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,920
for all of the African nightcrawlers

265
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,540
right over here and if you've seen that

266
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:08,459
YouTube thinks you're gonna like this

267
00:11:06,540 --> 00:11:10,380
video over here so if you like the video

268
00:11:08,459 --> 00:11:12,180
give it a muddy thumbs up if you're not

269
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:13,680
a member of my worm family click that

270
00:11:12,180 --> 00:11:15,240
subscribe button and if you want to know

271
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,100
what I'm doing when I'm doing it ring

00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:18,360
that Bell icon alright guys thanks for

273
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,560
hanging out with me and my worms and

274
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:21,560
