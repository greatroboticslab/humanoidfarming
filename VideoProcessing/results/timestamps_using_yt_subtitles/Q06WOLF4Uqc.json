  "text": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hi I'm Mark Hall with the Alabama Cooperative Extension system with me today is Brad Durham Brad is our uh natural resources advisor for the uh for Al University and he's located here at to Tennesse Valley research and Extension Center and we're going to be talking about linear irrigation today linear irrigation Brad that that don't suit everybody but in some places it's it's what folks need tell us about linear linear is just it goes down and bite down and bite don't Circle it looks like uh it's the same above ground but tell us about linear irrigation uh it's a real good system for any rectangle or square Fields you have whereas the center pivots you know goes around in circles and some of the edges don't get irrigated don't get irrigation we got a hose drag system here and you can get a ditch fed or a hose drag system and they're very very efficient uh on a square field and you can cover you know quite a bit of of acreage so you can set it up so that you you're irrigating every square foot every row of that field is irrigated if it fits in a linear that's correct where it can go down and back which a lot of fields do uh what are the uh uh disadvantages uh of it compared to say drip or Center pivot uh a center pivot you know you can pretty much hit the button and go a uh linear move system is more labor intensive we've got to swap hoses every 500 ft we have to swap hoses which you know you have to have either a tractor or a truck and drag a hose to the next hydrant hook it up um you just have to look after it more cuz you really don't want to pull one of those hydrants out of the ground yeah it's they're in the ground about 4T and they're very very hard to dig up and in your place how long will those hoses last to me it look like that would be a weakness of the system getting Dr along the ground well the hoses this is our second set of hoses here and the the irrigation system has been in for about 20 years I believe um so they last a good 8 to 10 years I would say on average for water usage would the water usage for a linear system be the same per acre as a a center pivot yes sir same per acre same per acre but crop wise talk about crops will just a minute Brad would it make any difference whether you're growing uh we've got corn corn and soybeans and cotton under this year but strawberries uh high value vegetable crops would it work just the same on any of them I would assume it would uh I don't have very much of a horiculture background I would think it would work along the same lines you know we got the drop nozzles you know that're closer can you get closer to the ground you know where you don't have a lot more you know in the hotter parts of the summer you got a lot of evaporation um from overhead irrigation so anything else I I just drug him out of the field and said come here and talk to me about our linear irrigation system and I appreciate you doing that Brad any other thoughts on this cuz you're you seem to be the go-to guy and I see out there working on that thing all the time when when it's going when it's hot weather irrigation is a job that's correct you know the only other labor intensive part of the machine is uh the furah you know we have to keep a fur dug to guide the system you dig a furah you know we got GPS Auto Steer tractors can dig a precise furra and run that machine the irrigation machine right in a very precise location you know I I would think if you didn't have rtk you know systems that might be a little bit of a burden you know it could get out of line and it's got these little sensors on the uh the furah got it fur Wheels you know if it gets out of line it'll cut itself off and cut the water off all that so it's it's really good system say a little bit more about that in line I tell you the truth I hadn't even thought about that that it's just it's just a linear it's like a board it's like a 2x4 going over but it's got all these wheels so if one of them gets off man it could get twisted around that's correct um now the newer systems are they have some GPS driven systems now would that be on every wheel or just one the those I believe are just on one station um you know our ours is in the middle of the field our F in the middle of the field most of them are on the inside right next to the cart as you know most people call the cart it's where the motor where all the operation uh operations are for the machine thank you Brad I appreciate your your sharing knowledge with us today folks if you'd like to look at our other irrigation videos here's a website that they're all on there or any other a or or 4 or homet kind of videos how to how to skin a catfish all kind of interesting videos right here at this link thank you for watching",
