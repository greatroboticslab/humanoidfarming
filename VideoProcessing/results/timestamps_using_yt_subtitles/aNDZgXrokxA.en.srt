[Music]

2
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:12,570
afternoon everybody so I'm going to talk

3
00:00:10,889 --> 00:00:14,759
to you a little bit more about some of

4
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,279
the components that you can find in more

5
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,050
detail in the report I'm going to try to

6
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,689
be quick here we have a lot to cover and

7
00:00:19,050 --> 00:00:23,519
Tucker in a moment we'll cover one of

8
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:24,720
the impact categories of pathogen so I

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,420
want to leave them some time

10
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,710
the first thing usually we like to talk

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,380
about when we've been talking about this

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:34,079
is that manure irrigation is just a

13
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:35,969
component of a mature system right and

14
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,530
it's the land application component and

15
00:00:35,969 --> 00:00:39,510
and one of the things that we try to

16
00:00:37,530 --> 00:00:41,489
remind everybody that we talked to this

17
00:00:39,510 --> 00:00:44,430
about is manure irrigation is a

18
00:00:41,489 --> 00:00:47,039
selection of practice and it's going to

19
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,600
be compared to other manure application

20
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,340
practices so a lot of times we try to

21
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:52,620
keep that in mind in our discussion and

22
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:54,750
that this wasn't manure irrigation or

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:56,610
Nothing right typically all of these

24
00:00:54,750 --> 00:00:58,320
fields that were talking about in what

25
00:00:56,610 --> 00:01:00,660
continent has irrigation equipment if

26
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:02,910
they didn't get irrigated with manure

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,750
they get traditional or other types of

28
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:09,330
manure application applied to them so we

29
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,799
try to really frame this as you're

30
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:12,450
trying to compare this to other

31
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,030
technologies and see what the benefits

32
00:01:12,450 --> 00:01:17,189
or drawbacks are um the other thing that

33
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,799
is important to notice to note is that

34
00:01:17,189 --> 00:01:21,990
it's part of the system and one of the

35
00:01:19,799 --> 00:01:23,700
things is manure irrigation you can't

36
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,979
really accomplish manure arrogation

37
00:01:23,700 --> 00:01:28,799
without doing at least some minor

38
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,380
processing typically it requires some

39
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,939
solid removal you can accomplish that

40
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:38,369
with some complex systems processing

41
00:01:35,939 --> 00:01:40,049
systems botanical systems or we've seen

42
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:42,869
a few people achieve it through multi

43
00:01:40,049 --> 00:01:44,700
stage storages so there's a few options

44
00:01:42,869 --> 00:01:47,130
and how you do that but the majority of

45
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:50,939
a manure irrigation system can't handle

46
00:01:47,130 --> 00:01:54,390
solid at the content level that are that

47
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,560
is traditionally found as a treated or

48
00:01:54,390 --> 00:02:00,240
even as it's diluted in manure storages

49
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,520
there are lots of things that a system

50
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:10,500
can control that you can control in a

51
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:12,480
system um oh there we go um so one of

52
00:02:10,500 --> 00:02:13,770
the things we told people we're tried to

53
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,380
get them to understand there's a lot of

54
00:02:13,770 --> 00:02:16,840
pieces

55
00:02:14,380 --> 00:02:18,580
a lot of management to each system as we

56
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:20,050
discussed a lot of this stuff so I want

57
00:02:18,580 --> 00:02:22,990
you to become a little familiar with

58
00:02:20,050 --> 00:02:24,730
some of these things that not all

59
00:02:22,990 --> 00:02:28,150
systems are the same and that there's a

60
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:29,800
lot of pieces that may impact the types

61
00:02:28,150 --> 00:02:32,500
of things we're talking about like odor

62
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:34,510
or runoff or other things so one of the

63
00:02:32,500 --> 00:02:36,850
things we try to remind people you can

64
00:02:34,510 --> 00:02:38,950
control the rate of application you can

65
00:02:36,850 --> 00:02:41,230
change the pressure and the nozzle type

66
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:44,110
right the nozzle types used for manure

67
00:02:41,230 --> 00:02:46,900
are much larger on the traveling gun

68
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:50,140
that can handle maybe for maybe up to 5%

69
00:02:46,900 --> 00:02:52,240
total solids on the manure irrigation

70
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,070
the center pivot system the types of

71
00:02:52,240 --> 00:02:56,290
nozzles sometimes are called trash

72
00:02:54,070 --> 00:02:58,030
nozzles or other things that are used

73
00:02:56,290 --> 00:03:00,280
for manure are very different than what

74
00:02:58,030 --> 00:03:02,860
you use for water irrigation right and

75
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,990
they produce profits that are much

76
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:07,570
different than what you would see in

77
00:03:04,990 --> 00:03:10,030
traditional application systems that

78
00:03:07,570 --> 00:03:12,940
apply water or maybe apply some kind of

79
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,530
chemical right so it's the conditions

80
00:03:12,940 --> 00:03:16,690
that might apply for those systems might

81
00:03:14,530 --> 00:03:19,000
be very different than the ones that

82
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:20,860
apply here also there's an end gun on

83
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:23,500
the system so we talked a lot about that

84
00:03:20,860 --> 00:03:25,510
you can turn that on or off and that

85
00:03:23,500 --> 00:03:27,700
there are really computerized systems

86
00:03:25,510 --> 00:03:30,870
that are out there that can help you

87
00:03:27,700 --> 00:03:34,560
detect wind speed automatic shutoff

88
00:03:30,870 --> 00:03:37,900
turning off certain components for

89
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,640
working over waterways etc so here's

90
00:03:37,900 --> 00:03:41,500
just a few images this is what we have

91
00:03:39,640 --> 00:03:44,650
drop-down nozzles right these were a

92
00:03:41,500 --> 00:03:47,200
really big discussion point and that the

93
00:03:44,650 --> 00:03:50,230
lower you could get your drop nozzles

94
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,270
closer to the crop would be beneficial

95
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:54,970
again in a lot of these Center pivots

96
00:03:52,270 --> 00:03:57,010
you can get nozzles drop nozzles that go

97
00:03:54,970 --> 00:03:58,630
all the way to the ground um in this

98
00:03:57,010 --> 00:04:00,940
case you can see these are higher up

99
00:03:58,630 --> 00:04:03,310
because they grew corn in this field and

100
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:04,870
later in the season they didn't want to

101
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:06,970
have to change out the position but it's

102
00:04:04,870 --> 00:04:08,590
really important that you understand

103
00:04:06,970 --> 00:04:10,930
that all of the systems are not the same

104
00:04:08,590 --> 00:04:13,390
and that the impact from where you have

105
00:04:10,930 --> 00:04:16,720
dropped nozzles your release height is

106
00:04:13,390 --> 00:04:18,580
quite important so here's a picture of

107
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:21,250
one of the nozzles playing manure again

108
00:04:18,580 --> 00:04:23,710
this is a specialized nozzle and the

109
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:25,000
pressures that we run under pivot

110
00:04:23,710 --> 00:04:27,100
systems with when you are on are much

111
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:27,700
lower and we typically run them with

112
00:04:27,100 --> 00:04:30,100
water

113
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:32,500
so in general the nozzles and the

114
00:04:30,100 --> 00:04:35,260
pressures are designed to have larger

115
00:04:32,500 --> 00:04:36,970
droplet sizes and in a moment I'll talk

116
00:04:35,260 --> 00:04:42,010
about some impact categories and why

117
00:04:36,970 --> 00:04:44,590
that's important next I think my

118
00:04:42,010 --> 00:04:51,190
computer seems to want to move forward

119
00:04:44,590 --> 00:04:54,100
here there we go um is that you can have

120
00:04:51,190 --> 00:04:56,830
some control system right there really

121
00:04:54,100 --> 00:04:59,500
advanced control system so this so that

122
00:04:56,830 --> 00:05:03,430
you can shut off even like a pie slice

123
00:04:59,500 --> 00:05:05,440
or you can shut off very small zones in

124
00:05:03,430 --> 00:05:08,410
these very irate irrigation application

125
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,040
so we had a lot of discussions about oh

126
00:05:08,410 --> 00:05:13,630
well I want I how am I supposed to I

127
00:05:11,040 --> 00:05:15,550
need to operate through a waterway and

128
00:05:13,630 --> 00:05:17,770
we were saying no there are technologies

129
00:05:15,550 --> 00:05:19,960
to avoid things like operating through a

130
00:05:17,770 --> 00:05:22,150
waterway and shutting off and trying to

131
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,880
protect certain resources when you're

132
00:05:22,150 --> 00:05:26,290
using it - all right when we were

133
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,810
talking about the practice there are a

134
00:05:26,290 --> 00:05:33,870
lot of things we centered our discussion

135
00:05:28,810 --> 00:05:36,700
around which include when we apply

136
00:05:33,870 --> 00:05:39,790
manure you with an irrigation system how

137
00:05:36,700 --> 00:05:43,420
does that change or a droplet movement

138
00:05:39,790 --> 00:05:45,820
how does that disperse when it disperses

139
00:05:43,420 --> 00:05:47,950
when we're talking about pathogens we

140
00:05:45,820 --> 00:05:50,140
have some microbial and activation from

141
00:05:47,950 --> 00:05:52,840
the sunlight how this temperature how

142
00:05:50,140 --> 00:05:56,680
this humidity affects that microbial

143
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:58,540
inactivation how a lot of times we got

144
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,550
to talking about setback distances how

145
00:05:58,540 --> 00:06:05,050
far should I be from a house where well

146
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:08,080
or surface water is this practice have

147
00:06:05,050 --> 00:06:09,700
advantages or is it this advantageous to

148
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,830
use in comparison to other practices in

149
00:06:09,700 --> 00:06:13,470
terms of groundwater penetration we do

150
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:16,570
have some areas with like karst

151
00:06:13,470 --> 00:06:20,170
fractured bedrock in Wisconsin and so it

152
00:06:16,570 --> 00:06:22,300
was a big discussion of whether whether

153
00:06:20,170 --> 00:06:26,590
we would see benefits or drawbacks from

154
00:06:22,300 --> 00:06:29,980
this system compared to exhibition okay

155
00:06:26,590 --> 00:06:32,020
so what we did it we kind of in the

156
00:06:29,980 --> 00:06:33,520
report there's a lot more detail about

157
00:06:32,020 --> 00:06:36,550
each of these if you want more but we

158
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:39,640
kind of broke down the impact factors

159
00:06:36,550 --> 00:06:40,610
into five areas one was drips odor water

160
00:06:39,640 --> 00:06:43,669
quality air

161
00:06:40,610 --> 00:06:45,919
quality and pathogen so in the drift

162
00:06:43,669 --> 00:06:48,530
area we heard a lot of people talking

163
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:50,180
about risk some talking about spraying

164
00:06:48,530 --> 00:06:52,639
onto their house or spraying onto the

165
00:06:50,180 --> 00:06:54,740
sidewalk and really this drift to us

166
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,169
means the aerial movement of liquid

167
00:06:54,740 --> 00:06:59,539
outside the intended application area

168
00:06:57,169 --> 00:07:01,460
and that's different from overspray

169
00:06:59,539 --> 00:07:04,909
right we called overspray when you hit a

170
00:07:01,460 --> 00:07:06,919
house or a sidewalk we define that as

171
00:07:04,909 --> 00:07:09,319
overspray and we always agree that that

172
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,419
was not a practice that we would ever

173
00:07:09,319 --> 00:07:13,189
support and that that should always be

174
00:07:11,419 --> 00:07:16,039
avoided and you should be able to

175
00:07:13,189 --> 00:07:18,229
control that with understanding your

176
00:07:16,039 --> 00:07:22,060
irrigation system and using information

177
00:07:18,229 --> 00:07:25,219
like wind information and other things

178
00:07:22,060 --> 00:07:26,659
so drift is that movement typically

179
00:07:25,219 --> 00:07:29,210
caused by wind so you're going to get a

180
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,800
little movement off of the intended area

181
00:07:29,210 --> 00:07:34,069
and you need to be a little more careful

182
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:37,550
when you're applying near school right

183
00:07:34,069 --> 00:07:41,000
so application a location becomes really

184
00:07:37,550 --> 00:07:42,319
important in a lot of these we talked

185
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:44,990
about how there were not a lot of

186
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:48,529
regulations for other manure application

187
00:07:44,990 --> 00:07:49,940
methods that drift was not important in

188
00:07:48,529 --> 00:07:51,740
there but that we realize we really

189
00:07:49,940 --> 00:07:57,139
needed to think about it more especially

190
00:07:51,740 --> 00:07:58,969
if we had higher relief pipe or irrigate

191
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:02,539
for manure irrigation particularly with

192
00:07:58,969 --> 00:08:04,339
center pivots and the traveling guns so

193
00:08:02,539 --> 00:08:06,710
what the things we determined if you

194
00:08:04,339 --> 00:08:08,779
wanted to use min irrigation it was

195
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:11,000
important to maximize your droplet size

196
00:08:08,779 --> 00:08:13,610
and ASAE has a standard so we're talking

197
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,199
about medium to coarse and again the

198
00:08:13,610 --> 00:08:17,509
type of systems were using here

199
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,699
generally produce larger droplet sizes

200
00:08:17,509 --> 00:08:22,430
so you would want to select equipment

201
00:08:19,699 --> 00:08:24,860
that and pressures that achieve that

202
00:08:22,430 --> 00:08:27,919
droplet size that's in the medium to

203
00:08:24,860 --> 00:08:30,589
coarse or higher range you want to

204
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,029
minimize your release height and then

205
00:08:30,589 --> 00:08:33,890
you have to you know we really

206
00:08:32,029 --> 00:08:35,630
recommended that you needed to keep an

207
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:37,760
eye on wind speed automatic shutoff

208
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:40,070
things that when the wind gets too high

209
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:42,260
you can see in that top picture that was

210
00:08:40,070 --> 00:08:44,480
on a really windy day compared to the

211
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:46,399
bottom picture on a not very when you

212
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:48,110
say you can see the difference in the

213
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,360
drift that you see so the conditions are

214
00:08:48,110 --> 00:08:51,649
really important and then also using

215
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,949
barriers and other things are really

216
00:08:51,649 --> 00:08:56,899
important in order to minimize that

217
00:08:54,949 --> 00:08:58,639
one of the thing one of the biggest

218
00:08:56,899 --> 00:09:01,999
concerns without about manure irrigation

219
00:08:58,639 --> 00:09:03,860
was odor and there really is odor is

220
00:09:01,999 --> 00:09:05,899
going to be a bigger concern with manure

221
00:09:03,860 --> 00:09:09,889
irrigation than almost any other manure

222
00:09:05,899 --> 00:09:13,100
application method so the perception and

223
00:09:09,889 --> 00:09:15,800
variable there are so it's a greatest

224
00:09:13,100 --> 00:09:17,929
citizen concern um was first some of the

225
00:09:15,800 --> 00:09:22,279
odors produced they had a lot of concern

226
00:09:17,929 --> 00:09:24,829
for like being outside having repeated

227
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:28,040
applications that the odor was really

228
00:09:24,829 --> 00:09:29,569
impacting their life so generally always

229
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:32,720
greater there are ways to mitigate

230
00:09:29,569 --> 00:09:34,749
though in this case higher winds greater

231
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:37,399
than five miles an hour increases

232
00:09:34,749 --> 00:09:40,670
dispersion so again now you're trying to

233
00:09:37,399 --> 00:09:42,769
fail in the odor versus the drift and

234
00:09:40,670 --> 00:09:45,649
kind of operating we recommended in this

235
00:09:42,769 --> 00:09:48,079
five to ten mile an hour range you

236
00:09:45,649 --> 00:09:50,839
wanted to be filled barrett barriers you

237
00:09:48,079 --> 00:09:52,490
want to think about where are people you

238
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,110
know there are some cases in our state

239
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:55,910
where there were folks who had a

240
00:09:54,110 --> 00:09:58,100
irrigation system that was nowhere near

241
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,439
anybody else they owned all the

242
00:09:58,100 --> 00:10:01,939
surrounding fields and so drift and odor

243
00:10:00,439 --> 00:10:04,160
were not really that big of a deal

244
00:10:01,939 --> 00:10:06,319
there's other who are trying to operate

245
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:09,319
irrigation systems where their

246
00:10:06,319 --> 00:10:10,879
boundaries were with that had houses

247
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:12,259
near them and if you're looking to put

248
00:10:10,879 --> 00:10:14,240
an irrigation system in and you already

249
00:10:12,259 --> 00:10:16,790
have it in those selection of those

250
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,439
fields is really a mistake and also we

251
00:10:16,790 --> 00:10:20,059
talked about how manure processing could

252
00:10:18,439 --> 00:10:22,610
really reduce some of the odors like

253
00:10:20,059 --> 00:10:24,860
using a digest for a number of the

254
00:10:22,610 --> 00:10:25,699
facilities that had irrigation has

255
00:10:24,860 --> 00:10:27,800
digesters

256
00:10:25,699 --> 00:10:29,420
again you can mitigate some of these

257
00:10:27,800 --> 00:10:31,879
odors but comparatively to other

258
00:10:29,420 --> 00:10:35,569
practices the newer irrigation order

259
00:10:31,879 --> 00:10:37,189
will be greater water quality we talked

260
00:10:35,569 --> 00:10:39,439
a little bit about this really we

261
00:10:37,189 --> 00:10:41,949
started to think about that so long as

262
00:10:39,439 --> 00:10:44,360
you would avoid application rates that

263
00:10:41,949 --> 00:10:47,240
resulted in runoff that we may actually

264
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:49,699
with multiple applications be able to

265
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:52,309
see some of the impacts of leaching and

266
00:10:49,699 --> 00:10:56,839
that we would have less penetration into

267
00:10:52,309 --> 00:10:59,720
the into the soil surface and downward

268
00:10:56,839 --> 00:11:02,240
with multiple applications instead of

269
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:05,149
one application in the fall or spring as

270
00:11:02,240 --> 00:11:06,950
we do with traditional applications so

271
00:11:05,149 --> 00:11:08,810
we saw this as a benefit

272
00:11:06,950 --> 00:11:11,540
some ways but there really isn't any

273
00:11:08,810 --> 00:11:13,580
direct information on manure we were

274
00:11:11,540 --> 00:11:17,180
taking information and applying it from

275
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:19,640
other research and again we really

276
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:21,320
targeted that you can't use the

277
00:11:19,640 --> 00:11:22,940
irrigation system through a waterway

278
00:11:21,320 --> 00:11:25,640
right you have to use those more

279
00:11:22,940 --> 00:11:29,450
controlled system to avoid that kind of

280
00:11:25,640 --> 00:11:31,310
situation air quality we talked about

281
00:11:29,450 --> 00:11:33,110
particulate matter greenhouse gas

282
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:36,530
emissions hazard hazardous air

283
00:11:33,110 --> 00:11:38,540
pollutants we use OSHA occupational

284
00:11:36,530 --> 00:11:41,900
standards and Wisconsin ambient air

285
00:11:38,540 --> 00:11:45,080
standards to kind of look at where we

286
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:47,420
were falling when we use manure

287
00:11:45,080 --> 00:11:49,250
irrigation now there's not a lot of data

288
00:11:47,420 --> 00:11:52,970
from manure irrigation systems

289
00:11:49,250 --> 00:11:54,800
particular particulate matter not very

290
00:11:52,970 --> 00:11:57,080
much on greenhouse gas emission for that

291
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:59,750
particular land application but we just

292
00:11:57,080 --> 00:12:02,690
talked about the mechanisms that may

293
00:11:59,750 --> 00:12:05,150
increase or decrease in the report these

294
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,910
particular components obviously in a lot

295
00:12:05,150 --> 00:12:10,640
of cases this type of application system

296
00:12:07,910 --> 00:12:12,230
would increase some of these hazardous

297
00:12:10,640 --> 00:12:14,000
air pollutants particularly hydrogen

298
00:12:12,230 --> 00:12:17,030
sulfide people had some concerns about

299
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:19,040
we did have this state folks that the

300
00:12:17,030 --> 00:12:21,040
public health had measured a number of

301
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,450
times around these systems and never

302
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,480
have really had a hydrogen sulfide

303
00:12:23,450 --> 00:12:28,550
reading on that that they could document

304
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:33,110
as being close to anything near the

305
00:12:28,550 --> 00:12:35,750
ocean occupational um again there are

306
00:12:33,110 --> 00:12:39,710
similar mitigation techniques to the

307
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:42,440
other odor as using edge of field

308
00:12:39,710 --> 00:12:44,290
barriers keeping larger droplets and

309
00:12:42,440 --> 00:12:46,850
having a low reach in these height

310
00:12:44,290 --> 00:12:49,040
there's one more impact category with

311
00:12:46,850 --> 00:12:50,390
his pathogens and conkers going to talk

312
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,030
about that in a moment so I'm going to

313
00:12:50,390 --> 00:12:55,460
leave that to him to cover um but I do

314
00:12:53,030 --> 00:12:57,620
want to talk about just two additional

315
00:12:55,460 --> 00:12:59,750
things before I let him take over one is

316
00:12:57,620 --> 00:13:02,930
that we really talked a lot about

317
00:12:59,750 --> 00:13:05,000
application tiny right and that we are

318
00:13:02,930 --> 00:13:06,800
really we heard from producers a lot

319
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:11,510
that they're really running into these

320
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:13,280
scenarios where they cannot they don't

321
00:13:11,510 --> 00:13:15,410
have enough time in the spring and fall

322
00:13:13,280 --> 00:13:17,000
to apply their manure right it's

323
00:13:15,410 --> 00:13:20,510
particularly those who are not allowed

324
00:13:17,000 --> 00:13:22,370
to apply during a frozen ground and so

325
00:13:20,510 --> 00:13:24,620
put kind of this imaging up just to give

326
00:13:22,370 --> 00:13:28,100
an idea for people when you have

327
00:13:24,620 --> 00:13:30,650
rainstorm or you have precipitation or

328
00:13:28,100 --> 00:13:33,320
melting events you're really limiting

329
00:13:30,650 --> 00:13:35,630
and you're not allowed to apply in the

330
00:13:33,320 --> 00:13:38,000
winter you really have tight window some

331
00:13:35,630 --> 00:13:40,220
years when you can get when you are out

332
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:42,710
in the field and so what we found was

333
00:13:40,220 --> 00:13:46,610
irrigation is that that really expands

334
00:13:42,710 --> 00:13:48,710
your windows and can reduce not not only

335
00:13:46,610 --> 00:13:51,260
can you do multiple applications which

336
00:13:48,710 --> 00:13:53,540
can be more tailored to the timing of

337
00:13:51,260 --> 00:13:58,030
the plant so you might get better

338
00:13:53,540 --> 00:14:01,220
nutrient use efficiency that you also

339
00:13:58,030 --> 00:14:03,710
can avoid some of the issues that happen

340
00:14:01,220 --> 00:14:05,450
you know what people apply during times

341
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:08,090
they shouldn't be applying because

342
00:14:05,450 --> 00:14:09,680
they're facing a tight window or other

343
00:14:08,090 --> 00:14:11,900
similar things to that you know it

344
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,580
issues with tons of road traffic at the

345
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:16,130
same time so we did think that there are

346
00:14:13,580 --> 00:14:19,400
some significant benefits to be noted

347
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:21,110
with applications and then we have a few

348
00:14:19,400 --> 00:14:22,670
scenarios and if you look at the report

349
00:14:21,110 --> 00:14:25,190
you can see some other information we

350
00:14:22,670 --> 00:14:28,430
are really trying to lay out what does

351
00:14:25,190 --> 00:14:30,800
it mean if you switch from a more

352
00:14:28,430 --> 00:14:33,920
conventional application system using

353
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:36,380
maybe tankers on the road to trying a

354
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:38,000
field with a manure irrigation right so

355
00:14:36,380 --> 00:14:39,980
we said well you know there's a lot of

356
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,560
scenario to think about here but for a

357
00:14:39,980 --> 00:14:44,420
certain size farm you kind of map this

358
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:47,750
out and say they had a bunch of fields

359
00:14:44,420 --> 00:14:49,760
and this farm had 250 tanker loads a

360
00:14:47,750 --> 00:14:52,670
year right and maybe they did one or two

361
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:55,160
applications or here on each skills now

362
00:14:52,670 --> 00:14:57,530
that if they switch to having some

363
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,780
manure irrigation maybe they're tanker

364
00:14:57,530 --> 00:15:01,580
loads reduced by almost half so you see

365
00:14:59,780 --> 00:15:03,770
if you live near there you might be less

366
00:15:01,580 --> 00:15:05,360
traffic but then if you live close to

367
00:15:03,770 --> 00:15:07,850
the fields with manure irrigation you

368
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,590
may have more instances of application

369
00:15:07,850 --> 00:15:11,840
and I think one of the important things

370
00:15:09,590 --> 00:15:15,320
we talked about was setting some rules

371
00:15:11,840 --> 00:15:18,500
on how many times you know we really had

372

377
00:15:27,830 --> 00:15:32,720
a maximum or not and also a little bit

378
00:15:30,740 --> 00:15:35,860

379
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,860
