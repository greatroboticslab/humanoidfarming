1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,679
contrary to popular belief the peanut is

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:05,759
not a nut

3
00:00:03,679 --> 00:00:06,960
it's actually a vegetable belonging to

4
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:09,519
the legume family

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,440
which includes peas and beans these

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,240
tropical natives of south america

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,920
require about 120 days to mature

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,800
but fortunately the peanut plant can

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:21,199
withstand light spring and fall frosts

10
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,800
jumbo virginia is a productive variety

11
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,640
for home gardens

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,240
although the peanut plant is generally

13
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,160
considered a southern crop

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,760
northern gardeners can also grow them

15
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,679
successfully if they choose early

16
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:33,600
cultivars such as early spanish and

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:36,960
start plants indoors

18
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,960
planting peanuts peanuts need full sun

19
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
if you have heavy soil ensure good

20
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,360
drainage by working in enough organic

21
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,120
matter to make it loose and friable

22
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,440
peanut seeds come in their shells and

23
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,360
can be planted hulled or unheld

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
if you do shell them don't remove the

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,520
thin pinkish brown seed coverings or the

26
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,520
seed won't germinate

27
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,360
northern growers should start a peanut

28
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,600
plant indoors in a large peat pot a

29
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,840
month before the last frost

30
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,879
sow seeds one inch deep place in the

31
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:07,119
sunniest spot possible and water weekly

32
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,439
transplant peanut plant seedlings to the

33
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,280
garden when the soil warms to between 60

34
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,920
and 70 degrees

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,720
space transplants 10 inches apart being

36
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,720
careful not to damage or bury the crown

37
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,360
in the south plant outdoors around the

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,840
date of the last expected frost

39
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,560
space seeds 2 inches deep and 5 inches

40
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:29,439
apart in rows 2 to 3 feet apart

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:31,360
firm the soil and water well thin plants

42
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,159
to 10 inches apart

43
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,600
growing peanut plants when a peanut

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:37,119
plant is about a foot tall

45
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:38,640
hill the earth around the base of the

46
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,439
peanut plant

47
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:43,360
long pointed pegs also called peduncles

48
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,360
grow from faded flowers and then push

49
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,880
one to three inches down into the soil

50
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,720
beside the plant

51
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,040
a peanut will form on the end of each

52
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,200
peg lay down a light mulch

53
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,079
such as straw or grass clippings to

54
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:55,920
prevent the soil

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
surface from crusting so that the pegs

56
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:58,880
will have no difficulty penetrating the

57
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,880
soil

58
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,399
one inch of water a week is plenty a

59
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,640
peanut plant

60
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,439
being legumes peanuts supply their own

61
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:07,920
nitrogen

62
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:10,479
so avoid nitrogen-rich fertilizers which

63
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,560
encourage foliage rather than fruits

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,640
well-prepared soil will provide all the

65
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,599
nutrients the plants need

66
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,520
harvesting peanuts the crop is ready to

67
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:21,440
harvest when leaves turn yellow and the

68
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:23,360
peanuts inner shells have gold marked

69
00:02:21,440 --> 00:02:25,280
veins which you can check periodically

70
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,640
by pulling out a few nuts from the soil

71
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,480
and shelling them

72
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,319
if you wait too long the pegs will

73
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:31,280
become brittle and the pods will break

74
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,000
off in the ground

75
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,920
making harvesting more difficult pull or

76
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,120
dig the plants and roots when the soil

77
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:39,519
is moist

78
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,519
shake off the excess soil and let plants

79
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,560
dry in an airy place until the leaves

80
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,680
become crumbly

81
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:47,760
then remove the pods unshelled peanuts

82
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:51,200
stored in airtight containers can keep

83
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,200
for up to a year
