00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:09,599
hello everybody uh Dylan here and

3
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:12,240
uh with Nathan SCH sales reps here with

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:14,400
green cover talking a little bit about

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,680
uh when is the best time to start

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
planting our spring mixes I know

7
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:20,000
everybody's getting itchy to to get into

8
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:21,760
the ground whether that be moisture

9
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,039
whether that be it seems like Springs

10
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:26,679
here um so just kind of want to discuss

11
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:28,519
with you guys what our approach is um to

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,840
to going about that so Nathan what you

13
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,480
know when a customer asks you hey I'm

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:35,800
ready to plant you know when when's the

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,719
ideal time what do you kind of generally

16
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,039
recommend yeah so this is definitely a

17
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,960
really common question right now you

18
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:45,399
know the main thing is soil temperature

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,280
for germination and then air temperature

20
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:49,600
uh to avoid any winter kill so most of

21
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,600
your cool Sean species are going to

22
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,960
germinate around 40 degrees and so as

23
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,640
long as our our longterm average and our

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,280
current soil temperatures are at that 42

25
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,800
sorry that 40 degrees um and that's

26
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,240
probably that probably needs to be taken

27
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:08,159
at uh a 2in soil depth and early in the

28
00:01:05,240 --> 00:01:10,240
morning um if if we're at that point and

29
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,200
then we we just need to be past any

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,240
concern of a hard freeze you know cool

31
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:16,600
season species can tolerate some Frost

32
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:17,759
it's when you get those hard freezes

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:20,159
down in the 20s that we're going to

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,560
start seeing some winter kill um of

35
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,520
course there are a lot of other factors

36
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,960
that go into uh you know when is the

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:27,079
time to plant so maybe you want to get

38
00:01:25,960 --> 00:01:29,400
into the weeds a little bit more on

39
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:31,880
those yeah so I definitely agree with

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:33,079
with those parameters we cannot

41
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,399
physically be out there measuring the

42
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:38,280
soil temp you know so you know any any

43
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,200
kind of you know any kind of thermometer

44
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,000
works that has any kind of probe so even

45
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:43,880
just a you know just any kind of like a

46
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,840
food thermometer Works to to measure

47
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:49,840
those those temperatures um I I usually

48
00:01:46,840 --> 00:01:51,680
refer to greencast um and with greencast

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,200
you can put your ZIP code in there you

50
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:54,840
can see roughly current soil

51
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:57,240
temperatures you can see five and 10

52
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,159
year average so I kind of combined the

53
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:01,680
two the three of those um you know to

54
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,439
get to that 40° temp and then I also

55
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,600
kind of incorporate the the 10day

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,719
forecast for the ambient temp to see

57
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,560
okay do we have any hard freezes you

58
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:11,560
know coming up or what do the what do

59
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:14,200
the 10day for what do the 10day forecast

60
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:16,000
look like um and you know that that

61
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,000
freezing temp you know really kind of

62
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,800
coincides with it I believe it has to be

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,480
around you know 4 hours at that

64
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:24,560
temperature you know kind of that's when

65
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,560
you start to get um that's when you

66
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:29,480
start to get those those killing frosts

67
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,360
for some of those cool season um species

68
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:32,120
so

69
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:34,360
uh you know keeping that in mind um

70
00:02:32,120 --> 00:02:35,840
another another thing you can do if you

71
00:02:34,360 --> 00:02:38,400
have if you're planting just something

72
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:40,959
simple like peas and oats planting it a

73
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,920
little bit deeper um it can you can get

74
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,480
it in the ground while you have moisture

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:46,800
get it sprouted and it's going to stay

76
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,040
in the ground a little bit longer so we

77
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:51,200
can maybe avoid if there are some of

78
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,040
those hard freezes here you know in the

79
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,760
next couple weeks um but that that at

80
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,440
least allows you to to get it in get it

81
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:59,440
up and and hopefully get a good good

82
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,360
Forge going with some more moisture but

83
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,400
those are really the parameters I try to

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
try to stick to and yeah it's the

85
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
biggest thing is going out there and

86
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:11,560
measuring it yourself too to get good

87
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:12,760
good hard data on on your area yeah

88
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,920
because there's G be a lot of factors

89
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:16,959
that affect that soil temp you know how

90
00:03:14,920 --> 00:03:18,480
biologically active soils are what sort

91
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,319
what's our residue situation what's our

92
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:22,760
moisture situation so yeah tools like

93
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:25,080
that greencast website are great for

94
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:27,640
getting ideas um but the results are

95
00:03:25,080 --> 00:03:29,239
going to vary on the farm so and I

96
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:30,879
definitely agree with that thought of

97
00:03:29,239 --> 00:03:33,519
hey I have a really nice planting window

98
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,360
right now we plant now plant a little

99
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,400
deeper like those oats and peas those

100
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
cereals that can go a little deeper and

101
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:41,640
then we'll delay that emergence you know

102
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
by a couple weeks um it'll be a couple

103
00:03:41,640 --> 00:03:45,519
weeks before those plants are up where

104
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,840
they're actually susceptible to being um

105
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:50,280
damaged and so that's how we can kind of

106
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:52,560
take advantage of early Springs like

107
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,840
what we seem to be having this year um

108
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,680
and and get our seeds in the ground so

109
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:58,599
you know it can be as simple as comp or

110
00:03:56,680 --> 00:04:01,680
as complicated as we want it to be but

111
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:03,280
at the end of the day 40° soil temps and

112
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:05,720
past the hard freezes and and we should

113
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:05,720
be good to

114
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:10,480
go
