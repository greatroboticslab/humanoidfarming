  "text": "hello folks and welcome to today's webinar on Farm composting fundamentals with Dr Robert rink I'm Linda bson brolis of the institute for local self-reliance composting for Community initiative and will be your hosts for this com uh webinar series a quick shout out to a couple of my issr colleagues who are helping with the series uh Sophia Jones will be providing technical support throughout this webinar and libertelli is a talented artist who is creating beautiful graphics for a composting initiative including this image so thank you for both thank you both for your help uh for those of you that aren't familiar with our work issrs composting for Community initiative is advancing composting to reduce waste enhance local soils create Community Development opportunities and protect the climate our focus is to catalyze distributed food waste composting options that include home community and on Farm scales we work to promote locally based composting in a number of different ways we convene a national Community composter Coalition and host networking and knowledge sharing opportunities such as our cultivating Community composting forums we work one-on-one with communities through technical assistance and policy support we produce reports and infographics we host regular webinars and a podcast as well as a map that showcases initiatives around the country and policies and programs that are advancing composting at this scale we also offer Technical Training through our neighborhood soil Rebuilders composter training program and for anyone that's interested in more training we'll be releasing a self-paced online community composting 101 101 course later this fall this course covers composting fundamentals and the ins and outs of starting a community-based composing initiative so stay stay tuned you can find all of these resources and more on our website if you go to il.org composting you'll see a composting resources drop- down menu on the right hand side of the screen and from there you can select reports podcasts webinars and more so back to this webinar series uh this series is being brought to you through our involvement with the million acre challenge which you'll be hearing more about in a moment uh but our belief is that we can only achieve a regenerative food system if the nutrients from our food scraps and other organic materials are cycled back into our soils and farmers and other folks that care for the soil are ideal stewards of this process there are many other benefits of composting and compost use which is exactly what the series will explore as you can see here this is the first of the series in which Dr Robert rink will cover the variety of methods and key considerations for establishing accomplishing site on a farm next up on September 14th we'll hear from Ellen polishuk who was a farmer at pic Vegetable Farms in Virginia for 25 years she'll discuss integrating composting into your farming business and how to use it as a tool for profit and growth check out the rest of the lineup here and on our website but now let's get to know each other a little bit with some interactive polls so you'll be able to participate in the poll by going to the goto webinar control panel should be on your screen so first question where are you participating from Northeastern us Southern us Midwestern us Western us or outside of the US give you all just a few more seconds all right let's see the results so primarily Northeastern us but a pretty good spr even a few folks from outside of the US so thanks for joining us next question are you composting yes you're already composting no but you're interested in starting no you're interested in supporting others in composting or other all right just a couple more seconds seconds so large majority are already composting awesome welcome uh hopefully we'll be providing you some great info to improve your composting and for those of you that have not started yet uh hopefully we'll be giving you some inspiration to do so last question for now what best describes your affiliation and I'm sorry they only give you five options so I had to condense some of the options but are you a farmer a composter a farm service provider and then either a researcher government or nonprofit uh person and then other business or other right just a couple more seconds all right let's check out the results so a good chunk are farmers welcome but there's also a lot of either researcher government or nonprofit and a few other composters and other business so welcome to everyone head back to my presentation all righty okay so uh at this point I would love to hand things over to my colleague at the million acre challenge Amanda Cather who is the Project Director of the million acre challenge so am Amanda if you're on the line you can unmute yourself okay can you hear me yes we can okay thank you Linda very much um yes as Linda said my name is Amanda cther and I'm the Project Director for the million acre challenge we are uh a collaborative project of five six founding partners and many more collaborators and Farmers working to bring 1 million Acres of healthy soils to the ches Peak region and to help catalyze the national movement towards regenerative agriculture and we are very grateful to be able to help sponsor this Workshop series with ilsr who is one of those six founding partners uh we at the million acre challenge work towards regenerative agriculture using a combination of five levers which are represented in our five working groups and you can see them here on this slide um farmer engagement scientific research creating of business case for regeneration working on State and local policy and also participating in U National discussions about state and local policy and creating consumer demand for regenerative agriculture via public Outreach so and of course as all of you know because you're here today on Farm composting is deeply important and woven through all of these layers um and these working groups with the potential to increase Farm profitability provide significant ecosystem services including potentially reductions in greenhouse gas emissions and contribute to farm resilience in the face of a changing climate which we feel every single day at least on my farm um so as you all know composting this is our mission uh and our vision for the million acre Challenge and composting is both critically important to this mission and vision and also scientifically and technically complex which is why the million acre challenge partners are so excited to be a part of the series bringing together Regional and National experts on on Farm composting um I would encourage you to find out more about the million-acre challenge on the web at million-acre challenge.org or on our social media feeds we'd love to connect with all of you um but for now I think we should get on with what you came for oh this these are our team our six founding partners and we're grateful to all of them for their support today and always and yeah let's get on with the webinar awesome thanks Amanda all right so uh before we begin our Feature Presentation just a few house housekeeping notes um everyone is in listen only mode um we should have about 20 or so minutes at the end of the webinar for questions but go ahead and enter your questions as they come up into the go-to webinar control panel box on your screen we'll be monitoring them there um this webinar is being recorded and a copy will be sent to you as a registrant of the webinar um there's also a handout of the presentation available um as an attachment um if you are a farmer who was not who could not the uh discount code and end up ended up paying for the webinar please let us know either in the chat here or by emailing us and we will uh get you refunded so just let us know but without further Ado um it is my pleasure to introduce our speaker uh Dr Robert rink has been researching and teaching about processing of agricultural and other organic materials for over 30 years he's an internationally renowned expert who has authored numerous Publications including the original on Farm composting handbook and its pending sequel the composting handbook he is an agricultural engineer and is a regular instructor for composting training schools and workshops both nationally and internationally so without further Ado take it away Dr rank oh thank you Linda uh let me share my webcam briefly know you don't want to look at me the whole time but that's what I look like I just wanted to show you that I'm here I'm not a robot or chicken or Linda changing her voice um and I'm very happy to be here um I appreciate the opportunity to uh talk about on Farm composting because I think it's important so let me get rid of myself and start showing you my slides which are great deal more interesting okay get started everybody see that and hear me didn't that y looks good sounds good okay great thanks so um I'm going to talk about the fundamentals of on composting and composting generally um we have an hour that's not a lot of time to cover the Waterfront so I'm going to do this uh more or less best as I can um I took a look at your questions that you put in ahead of time I think that will ask I will answer a bunch of those um and some I will only touch upon and then others uh you'll have to wait for the other webinar speakers who will address them in a bit more detail but uh I'll be glad to answer questions at the end to get into more detail as needed okay so uh what am I going to be talking about today uh why on Farm composting matters I'll give a brief overview of the process and mostly by example of what uh other Farms have done show you the methods and equipments involved in composting again it's just a sampling given the time we have um we'll talk about site requirements and en environmental factors but here's where the more or less comes in I'll be spending more time on the the methods and Equipment then I will be on site requirements and environmental factors okay what I won't be talking about in much depth at all is composting farmw test ities for vermac composting on Farm uh Community Based composting and the compost how to use it um how to make the quality you want how to sell it and won't be getting much into economics but again I'll be glad to answer questions at the end and in general details and specifics will be missing because of the time but if you're interested in at least three of those topics uh composting animal mortality Community scale composting and Verma composting there are some great references out there for you to gain more information um the one on the upper leftand side is available from the online from the cor Cornell Waste Management Institute I think it's free and the other two are books uh well worth the investment and you'll be hearing from James mcqueeny later on in the program and then of course this has been my big project is taking the on for composing handbook expand in it and updating it and um creating a new handbook and this is just about done uh the chapters are with the publisher they think they could get it out by the end of the year let's have our fingers crossed um especially Before Christmas I'm sure would make a great Christmas um and that's the introduction so what does composting do in a nutshell basic basically composting takes Raw Feed stocks like this and many other types of feed stocks these happen to be called potatoes from um a farm in um Central Washington and turns it into this from something that's difficult to handle doesn't have an immediate use to something that's a lot more that's easier to handle and does have a good use so this compost being spread here was made from these very same well not the very same but made from cold potatoes also and other Packing Shed PS uh along with dairy minor to become an input for this particular farm so why does on Farm composting matter well basically because composting and compost matter they play important roles not only in agriculture but in society General and composting and compost on farms um Farms are an exellent place for both so if we can take do a lot of the composting on farms and Farms can accept a lot of the compost that's made um we are solving a great number of problems so on Farm composting matters a lot because compost and compost uh the first reason the probably the most important reason that composting matters is that is the compost which can greatly improve soils and improve plant Health again you're going to get a another uh womin RC U presentation on this so I'm not going go in any depth but in a picture this is what composting does for the soil and in words from the same um from Dr Gan um these are some of the benefits of compost to soils and plants particularly on farms composting also has a place in manure management increasingly um Farmers have uh some difficulty handling manur as animal numbers increase and land doesn't necessarily increase along with it um it's easy to get in a situation where there's too many nutrients for the farm uh manure can be difficult to handle um it has more volume more weight more water than compost and that could equate to more trips to distant fields to apply it uh in an agronomic manner um whereas compost stores well it doesn't have to be applied right away uh and it's exportable and it's exportable because it handles easily and therefore more people want it or more people willing to take it from the farm and even people willing to pay for it so potentially depending upon the farm situation um compost can can be a benefit to minor man okay and then there's the potential for added Revenue to the mar Revenue can come from uh making compost by selling the compost that's made or by being paid to take uh waste and residu from off the farm so this picture shows both this is not a farm this is a company that takes advantage of both of those revenue streams they sell compost they charge for bring in inred in farm situations that could be difficult um in some jurisdictions if you do either of these on the farm that is sell compost made from waste from off the form or sell compost at all or taking off Farm waste uh that jurisdiction may say well you're no longer Farm that's not always the case depends upon the state in particular in some cases you could do both and still retain uh your your farm classification in other cases uh you could do one or the other better not both and that's usually the common case so you can sell compost um from feed stocks that you collect on the farm or even off farm feed stocks and you're still Farm or you can bring in green waste but not sell the compost um and you'd be still a farm usually it's the bringing in off Farm materials that's a little more allowed and where the revenues U are more easily captured in this case it takes a pretty good effort sometimes to Sol um and bringing in off Farm waste um there were a lot of people who might be looking for a home for their waste and residues uh and farms are a good place to bring it it just brings some cautions and we'll talk about that one of the reasons that route is a little easier is because um we recognize that it's not so easy to get rid of waste anymore particularly organic waste don't want to put them in Nill and a good number of states the slides from my colleague Matt cotton good number of states uh starting 40 years ago started Banning art trimmings from lfi that's when we had a landfill crisis and more recently um a number states are beginning to ban uh Food wids they'll call it or Organics generally New York State being the most recent to um to implement a Statewide ban uh for food and that presents opportunities uh for Farm to Tak in these materials and pay get paid to do that um so you know food is the new trend and it's because of its impact on climate change so when food is brought to the landfill even with a landfill with a a um methane collection system it still makes methane and that methane escapes and that's because food breaks down so quickly at the landfill face um it it emits its methane before methane clutch system has a effect has chance to to start collecting and methane is a poent greenhouse and thirdly there's better options for food than than throwing it l first being um try to make use of it uh as food for people and then food the animals and then finally can be composted or sent an analytic digestion but all of those are better than land so the push to start taking food waste out of the landfill though is mostly due to climate change and then compost has some benefits as far as uh cration sticking to the climate change theme um this slide is from uh Jeff Greek I think I saw Jeff's name on on the list um so this is where compost have been used on rangeland or pasture in uh Marin County in California and uh the researcher has shown some pretty good benefits so here's just an example um oh let me go back that's the previous Slide the squares indicate where cows are grazing on this land that they receive compost and they seem to be preferentially grazing on those plots where composts was uh used versus um the rest of the pasture lamb where was no compos um but more directly this is a slide of the soil organic matter uh several years after a single application of compost was made so the red bars are are the plots that had compost and you can see they generally show pyur oranic matter compared to control plots which didn't receive compost but the big story here is that this is not an annual application of compost that that the soil organic matter is responding to but a single application that happened in two 2008 so that one application has many years of impact and this project is still going on uh so sticking with the climate change theme um another colleague of mine uh Jane Gilbert led a team that looked that tried to put a number on the V carbon sequestration value of compost alone it's available in this publication from the iswa again I think that's free uh and they placed a value on it just for carbon sequestration of $59 per fresh ton of compost that's of the compost and not of the waste meaning it's not a Dr kind of compost that's there's some value there so all good great unfund composting will great what's the downside well it takes work it takes work it takes time you got to put money into it you need space to do it investment in equipment investment in land maybe investment in controls um so it's not free and the hope is that it'll pay for itself either in uh the value of the compost or the service you provide um but it does take an effort and then there also the hassles related to mostly odors okay um so this is a sign I came across uh where a compost was trying to expand a farm composter uh into new land and there was lots of neighborhood opposition to that mostly because there had been odor issues before um so composting isn't welcome by everyone it's generally welcom by everyone until it get comes to your neighborhood and then there's an issue these things are controllable um I shouldn't say controllable these things can be made better by a number of practices that composters can do including um becoming more active participating in the neighborhood um but this is one of the things that any composter May face even on a farm but the sign's wrong sign should say this say yes composting and it is farming it's very compatible with farming it's consistent with farming in fact I would even argue that composting is inherently farming um by its nature because you're you're using natural processes to produce a product um that and you're husbanding microorganisms to do that and um it's a radical idea but I would suggest yes if you're composting you're automatically F so um that's the why let's look at the how the composting process Le part of the house I'm going to go through this fairly quickly uh because a lot of you are composters already I know much of this uh these are the ins and outs of the composting process the direction of the Arrow show whether it's an in or out basically what we put in are feed stocks the microorganisms are there although some people add special microorganisms to do that the oxygen comes in on its own um although again in some cases they have to make an effort to do that and the water is well and the outputs are water vapor carbon dioxide and heat all good things and then there are some bad things odors and other gases that people might object check to but the main output is complex which is a value added product of the feed stocks that go and here's the trend of a compost uh a composting process okay many of you have seen this graph or something like it temperature tells a story of what's going on during compost and temperature does that by by the fact that it's a direct result of the decomposition that's taking place of the microbes action so as heat is released from decomposition temperature goes up and uh accumulates and heats up the pile and it it basically reflects how much heat is being generated okay so there's several stages there's this accelerating stage in the begin beginning when temperature heats up quickly this long stage um hot hot and Rapid composting where we spend most of our time um and then a final stage where compost cures and matures and and that's reflected by the lower temperatures going on there's a few other temperatures to uh take note of one is the the the point at which a mesophilic process turns into a thermophilic process this is not a very important point it's just an academic matter really and it's not it's not a fixed Point anyway the microorganism cell don't see this line and don't know where it happens uh it's just that thermophilic microorganisms can um withstand higher temperatures and they do most of the work through most of the composting process and mesophilic micro don't they can play different roles um so mesophilic for example mesophilic microorganisms uh are more active in that curing and maturing stage and they're mesophilic some mesophilic organisms are the ones that turn ammonia into nitrite and nitrate so that transformation happens basically we're in a thermic for the w a more important line is this one and that's the pathogen threshold um or at least that's the pathogen the standard pathogen thres regulations often dictate that pathogens and wheat seeds have to be killed depending upon the feed stocks and the situation you have to make sure you've followed pathogen reduction process and in the US we call that uh process to further process to further reduce pathogens PP uh outside of the us we may just call it sanitization or or or homogeneization um but it generally happens it's generally defined at this 55 degre Celsius or 100 which is 101 degrees fahren at this point so normally the regulations say when they apply is that have to hold the composting materials above that temperature for a certain amount of time for static processes and processes that are contained in the vessel that's 55 degrees C uh for three days uh for windr which are smaller have a more a larger surface area and they get turned it's actually 15 degrees and it has to be turned five times within that time span within that 15 degre times or it has to be turned five times and uh and during the five times it stays above 55 de now outside of the us some regulations require have raised this passage threshold to 60 degrees and even 65 degrees in some places which can be a challenge depending upon the but basically is 505 so that's an important one and that's also where we see are killed actually most wheat seeds are killed below well below 55 um 131 even at at 120 degrees Fahrenheits Mo most wheat seeds can die um but if you want to be sure um the higher the temperature the better and and keeping the pile moist during those hot temperatures also helps to destroy some seeds okay just as a clarification those dips on this curve really you're to represent one one pile maybe turned or water it's an immediate loss temperature but it recovers okay and then there's a curing stage at the end where uh the process continues it's de decomposition is still going on but it's at a much slower pace so this curing pile doesn't require the same attention um or effort as the active composting stage it's an important stage a lot of things happen in curing temperatures lower again those mesophilic organisms fungi begin to come back uh in greater numbers during curing and continue turning this partially composted material into compx so it's an important stage but it's requires less attention and actually less time as so here are some of the key factors that determine how well composting occurs um it needs to be moist the organisms live in in the moisture within the compost pile and the 50 to 60% moisture content um seems to be uh the optimal it has to have a good mix of nutrients particularly carbon and nitrogen I recommend higher carbon nitrogen ratios um than most people do if go by the book we're talking about 25 to one or slightly larger I like to say more because the more higher the carbon nitrogen ratio is the better that a p windro tends to aate and also this it slows down a process bit as the carbon nitrogen ratio raises above 25 to one process slows down um if you're in a hurry that's not good but if you're not in a hurry and um want a little more leeway to manage the process properly having a higher C ratio isn't bad um however the downside of high seeden ratio is that carries over into the compost making compost High ratio and that that does have some bulk density refers to um the weight per unit volume um but is turns out the bulk density is a pretty good indicator of the processed conditions generally both the moisture um condition and how well how much for space there is open for space there is and so um it's a good indicator of how well a pile will aate whether you're using fans or passive variation and should stay below 100 th a thousand pounds cub and and temperatures um again try to stay in that ideal range above where the pass Hill but below where the microorgan being seem to suffer and that seems to be about 160 okay there's some other parameters that are important but um they're not as important in terms of control what we do oxygen is clearly important but in most cases composters do not spend a lot of time measuring it they use temperature as an indirect gauge instead so let's take a look a little bit more at each one of these again uh there's there's a range where moist where there moisture content is just right you get a little higher it's too wet materials get heavy pors get fill with water it can't aate and then a point where the process slows down because there's n enough water for the microorganisms to inhabit uh so that sweet sweet spot is is above 50 below 65 you get below 35 it's way too dry and nothing will happen and it's thir stu um so the challenge in composting is depending upon where you're composting where you are is keeping it moist in ARR regions this is a constant strugle because it's not easy to add moisture evenly uh throughout a pile a good way to do it is to add moisture while you're turning um but that means you've got to carry water with with with along with you as you're doing the turn so keeping it moist is important um keeping it dry keeping from getting too moist is also important so here's pictures of these fabric covers that are used to keep out precipitation this is not necessarily the only way but it's a good picture of um of an attempt to keep it from uh getting too moist really the best way or the most common way is to uh turn it to try to drive off some of that moisture especially on the sunny day um but in some places keeping it from getting too dry is the challenge in other places keeping it from getting too moist oxygen really is the key to composting you know that's what the we want aerobic oxygen rich conditions in the pile because we want aerobic microorganisms to do the work because those are the ones who do it most quickly most completely and with the least amount of odors um 5% is considered a minimum that's a big bare minimum but generally the goal is to try to keep it above that and normally we don't monitor from oxygen um again we let temperature tell the story um and then we just array as best we can um and oxygen is delivered to the to the pile by Iration and there's two primary ways of eration uh windr and passive piles aate by passive aration basically what's happening is inside the pile it's a little warmer than it is in the environment around and that warm air uh leaves the pile uh and then it creates a vacuum and cool air cool oxygen rich air replaces it uh diffusion is another way that oxygen gets in and CO2 gets out of the pile but defusion is a very slow process relying on that doesn't provide nearly as much air and oxygen as these passive air movements and these passive air movements are very dependent on first of all generating temperatures inside warmer temperatures inside but also uh how easy the air can move in and out and that has to do with the airspace within the P both density uh we can air with more certainty by putting a fan and some duct workor within the pile um using pressure to blow air into the middle of it and then hopefully it's distributed evenly and the cool fresh oxygen rich air goes in the middle cools the pile keeps it from getting too hot and also brings in oxygen the primary way of using Forest Iration especially on Farm on farms it's a method called the air rated static pile method this would be a diagram of that rated static piles do not get turned on a regular basis um they may get turned occasionally um once or twice and the Iration system has to be um taken out disassembled and reassembled when when returning uh or it's built into a floor and you can turn on top of that um but this is a picture of the AA sta could also suck air out of the pile change the direction of these arrows um that would be used when we a little bit more concerned about odors um because you concentrate the exhaust from the pile at one point and that can be directed to an odor treatment system like pile but positive pressure uh systems like the one showing here um are generally easier to handle they use less energy and um they are the most common I'll show you some pictures of these later okay so I haven't talked about turning yet in regard to ation so what does turning do well doesn't really aate it at least not in the long term here are the functions that turning it does charge the pile with fresh air and oxygen that oxygen is lasts only briefly an hour maybe two hours at Best the Turning is not really does not really provide irration what it does is it releases the gases that are crapped inside mixes things up so it redistributes nutrients and moisture it breaks up air channels improves consistency in some cases it does fluff so it reduces the density of the material in the wind drill uh making it easier for air to flow in and and out by passive variation but in other cases it doesn't in other cases it shreds particles apart and after turning you end up with a a windo that's less dense than so it depends on the situation and turning brakes apart comes so that's primarily what it does and because of that generally invigorates the process always see a burst of activity after part of it that oxygen that it builds in for a short time but a lot of it are those other you mixing and churning um I kind of compare it to making a stir fry on the stove and you're actually doing the stirring to distribute things around the pan a little bit more and make things more even that's the turning point you can Envision what's going on within the composting pile at a microscopic level and it might look something like this um you've got these particles of biodegradable organic materials um they're breaking down and this moisture film kind of clings to the edge of it and that's where the microorganisms are in that moisture film and they're breaking down the particle from its surfaces outward and the nutrients tend to dissolve into that moisture film and the microorganisms um gain the nutrients and the moisture um where's the oxygen well immediately most of the oxygen in those core spaces that you're seeing on the left and it has the oxygen has to used into the moisture film to get to the microorganism um so it's important to remain to maintain pile that has those four spaces we call them free air spaces because they're not filled with motion um so that the oxy can first get into the interior Pile in order to fuse into the liquid film we want to avoid the situation on the right as much as possible where particles are clumped together there's no free a space um and no and it's more difficult for oxygen to fuse into that moisture so we want to we want to encourage the left hand side of this diagram rather than and what determines that in part is the bulk density bulk density reflects whether we have these particles all packed together uh without free air space and a lot of moisture or whether it's fluffier and so uh we shoot for a bulk density in that's 700 to 1,000 pounds per cubic and it's pretty easy to measure bu density all you need is a pale on the scale there's a standard method of doing this by filling a pale certain amount dropping it from a certain height keep filling the pil and keep dropping it until you get to a certain point and then you weigh it and You' got the weight for a 5 gallon pale and you can convert that to pounds go it's easy to do the reason I show this slide is because bulk density is an easy and and very general measure to determine um the conditions in the p and it's a good one pile height it's often the question uh what's the right height for a pile I like to measure um pile Heights in Calvin this is Calvin you see in the picture this pile is maybe two Calvin High the reason I measuring Calvin is because to me feet is a bit too impris we're talking about p height what's the difference between a three foot high or four foot high pile or even six and eight foot high pile not much so I like to refer to pile Heights and Calin um and so in general maybe three Calin is a Max and if you want to do the conversion Calvin's about six foot tall that's the point we don't need to be to% size uh as one of my colleagues says there's really no decimal points in compx um but in regard to windro size maybe the best rule of thumb to go by is you have to drive onto a pile um to get it to the top to stack it then it's too big but generally the pile sizes are determined by the equipment you're going to be used to making cont you're using wind Turner the wind returners are going to dictate the power but if you're using loaders you can go a lot higher and so this rule of thumb of not driving on the pile to determine the pile the way to go next factor is feed stocks feed stock all brings all of its character to the compost pile and basically feed stocks are what determine how the composting process is going to go how it's going to behave and feed stocks primarily determine the character of the compos itself so if you have nutrient Rich feed stocks you'll make nutrient Rich comp you have nutrient poor feed stocks you'll make nutrient poor comp uh Woody feed stocks make Woody comp you get it and feed stocks with contaminants will make comp you can do things to improve that really it's the feed stops that determ sometimes you get feet stocks that are adequately balanced or compost without doing anything like these y triming on the right sometimes not like this manure in the bottom left um that needs some amending before it'll compost that and so what we do is we mix ingredients together ingredients that don't have enough nitrogen with Medi ingredients have too much nitrogen ingredients that are wet in with ingredients that are dry to try to get get these conditions I talked about early and russan leaves and grass and food are good examples in uh in the backyard composting world we talk about these low nitrogen materials as Browns and these high nitrogen materials as greens and the high nitrogen materials most often are wet not always but most often are wet and the the low nitrogen materials most often are dry so combining them together with the right sedan ratio also tends to improve the moisture that here's an example of a composting recipe um on a farm using fish waste James mwe is going to talk about this a lot more so I'm not going to go into it there's examples of nitrogen Rich feet stocks poultry manure fish waste food grass and you want to combine those with nitrogen poor feet stops like fall leaves straw uh horse beding brush things of that nature I cross out carbon and put in nitrogen po because uh we often refer to things as as carbon sources but really carbons in everything even in the nitrogen High nitrogen materials everything all organic material has roughly the same amount of carbon it's the nitrogen that determines whether it's a carbon Source or not really okay the next factor is temperature talked a lot about that already um there's temperature range that's ideal for composting it tends to be between 120 and uh um 140 degrees fahit but at 160 it doesn't suffer much above 160 start to suffer more but we want to get to that 130 level to kill pathogens and wheat seeds Okay the thing about temperature the most important thing about temperature the composting process is that you can consider temperature composting Soma talked about this already the release of heat is direct result of the process so watching the temperature reflects the release the Heat and the microbial activ so it's the most important parameter to monitor to tell us what's going on and then time is the last thing it takes some time you can't really Rush the microorganism too much usually we need at least about a month to make stable compost for General use um more often it takes two to six months and if you relaxed about it or have tough Fe stocks it could take a year or more and it depends on the beat stocks how you intend to use the compost and how stability stable it needs to be when you're using it the methods and it's really the management once you determine it's it's the management more so than the method that determines what you not and then you watch all these things to make sure it's gone and the sensory OB ation includes OD okay let's move on to equipment and methods I'm going to use examples to go over different Farm scale composting so the most common is turned windr and that's what you'll see the most pictures of and that's probably what you have in your mind when you think about comp a long narrow pile of material that gets turned and churned every now and then the main advantage of Windrose is that it's simple it's easily started and managed anybody can do it anybody almost build a window in their backyard Pile in their backyard and start composting or in their back 40 really don't need any special equipment and that's the reason most people so here's an example of a farm who compost de cattle manure with some waste from grocery stores and and some from food processing facility or all vegetables in that case and they simply make window RS with um a skid steel loader that has an oversized bucket um makes the windows and turn every now and then okay fairly simple when the turn that's really a a a composter specific situation uh and preference um but it doesn't require much more than a skid steer in this case um there are some involve probably to move materials around the farm but so this is all involves here's another example this is a horse farm um that's using it adding its horse minority yard trimmings um that it was getting from the municipalities I don't think this operation I think it's closed down years ago but basically just to show you how they manage it they use an excavator as their primary uh turning device just every now and then move piles with the bucket on an excavator and I also use that to build piles their their main objective here was to compost the yard trimers um the horse farm is basically just an excuse to have an off farm when you're composting your trimmings um you're going to need to grind them up if you're taking any brush and then because there'll be a lot of wood still in it when you're done composting you'll need to screen out the oversized materials and in this case they use the traal screen that probably hired out both sides of that they hired in the grinder and hired out screen time uh here's another example of a windro u turned operation on in this case the farm compost manure with the AR jimes and also some food processing waste um and and they turn they build their windows with a loader and turn them with this tractor power Turner like tractor uh Powers the Turner both by pulling it um it's used for travel and also through the the PTO uh it drives the Turner itself and you can see they have fairly wide aisles between wind grows to accommodate the traffic on both sides although um you could actually stack two windows closer together you don't need an aisle for the tractor on both sides this is still that same form um they do make an effort to water their windr their windro Turner has nozzles on it so they can add water while they're turning and they have a tank wagon that they pull behind the Turner um which feeds the nozzles on the front because they're handling our trimmings this uh Farm also does some screening they own the satellite screen they use to make Dr rink yes just wanted to flag we have about 20 minutes left 20 minutes 20 minutes for my part for the presentation before okay to leave to leave time for Q&A okay thank you Linda um again this is another example of a farm that uses a window Turner trctor assisted windro Turner in this case it's uh uh sparms and Idaho so their Dairy manure is from the outside lots and it tends to be dry um they add some bedding to it to improve the the composting situation and they have a their Turner has needs a tractor for travel but it has its own engine to power Turner itself um they have a a to mounted Manor spreader um that they build the piles with with um and because it's an Idaho because the material starts out dry and they get very little precipitation um they add water regularly and they use a tractor toi to do that right after they do this it will come through with the Turner and mix that water into the window okay so those are turn systems um the other is areast static P diagram that um atic piles more reliably keep um the contents of the pile eroded because we're forcing air into there it also provides a level of temperature control using that air um to cool down the pot so you get more process control with area St pot another important advantage of it is you taking all these material that might have been in a windro and pulling them all together into a wider higher pile so we have a lower area reir that means if you need to cover it it's more easily done than and these advantages particularly the low area requirement um have driven the conversion of a lot of windr composting facilities on farms included or a static piles because it hasn't but with a static piles you have to add some um energy and Engineering so it's still pretty simple you have a a pipe which serves as an air duct hooked to a blower with some control mechanisms that Force air into the pile these photos are from a wastewater treatment plant that composted biosolids but I could have told you this from the farm and it would have looked realistic this just could be inside of a barn so it's still simple enough we on our f um this particular uh composter has very simple controls it's an on and off timer so the timer spends it some time on to aate the wind dra and cool it off and some time off to let it rest and do its thing and uh the timer settings would be adjusted uh manually based upon the temperatures for the operator same there are more compc Control Systems where uh the blower might come on and off based upon temperature feedback there's on there's a temperature sensor in the pile that sends a signal to the controls and turns the blowers on and off it's still fairly simple and then they're very sophisticated controls where the the fan runs continuously and the temperature sensor turns the the air flow rate up and down and this is that same application so the the equipment they use are that blower and um this loader to build piles and take piles apart and then they have a mixer which mixes in the biosolids and the wood chip amendment that they use to create the right Iration conditions the right free air space and bulk density for that prod and this is just an an an augur based Turner like many uh Turners on Farm like many mixers excuse me this is an augur based mixer like many on Farm mixers that are used to mix feed RS here's a a different version of an AR static pile before we saw individual piles this is called an extended piles where each batch of material is built on the side of another to extend the pile and each batch is called cell and the cell may have its own a irration pipe and you can see here um one blower is feeding numerous cells through a manifold um so this is on a farm this is a farm that used to compost by Windrose and found the the advantages of an area stat P will to converge this Farm uses um a fairly durable pipe it's highdensity polyethylene pipe um as the duck work um to avoid damaging the pipe when breaking down the piles they actually pull the pipe out using a tractor and chain this is this is the most common way of of running areas that a piles map is with durable pipe that gets pulled out before the piles get broken down the other option is to have a loader operator who's really good and can avoid pipe as much as possible um but more and more people are doing this pipe BL me okay here's another area static pile uh again this is Farm they're composting dewatered Dairy Manor solids and they decided to build a building to house the composting system and compost U the solids in these bunkers uh the bunkers have a positive variation system in the floor uh I don't recall whether the it has pipes on the playing on the floor or narration system that built into the floor um but uh nevertheless it's positive airation system air blowing up from the floor these materials here's a picture of the Iration systems on the bottom left the blowers and the pipe that are feeding each of these uh bunkers and each bunker has their own system um that person shining back in the light um he's not an angel although to me he has his name is Peter Moon he designed this system um Peter is uh a very good fellow know he he specializes in irated sta systems and he do does a lot of his work on farms helping Farms to uh make an area static pile system fit into their farming operation he's put a lot of systems on farms um all over the country and even outside the country in fact this is is a Peter Moon uh design system uh this is a farm that uh compost the yard trimmings from the community and its own Farm waste and it also gets some waste from a hotel that it's associated with um it's not a lot it's not a large scale system um they do this uh under cover in these bunkers uh in this building each of these uh bins holds batch uh there are bins on both sides of the building and so they have one two three they have about uh 8 to 10 um of these base which to work with uh when they're done in the base U piles sit out and the material sits in passive piles to cure so a fairly simple system their arated system looks like this um so you can see the plum on the bottom left um so the the air gets gets delivered into this Plum it's covered with the slatted boards um air moves up through this the um spacing between the boards and up into the floor the floor is covered with a layer of wood chip to keep Vines out of the irration system and to help distribute the air from the irration plum pop through the materials and on the right you see up um the shed the blower shed uh where the pipes are directly to the various uh um base and also the control system yeah fairly simple controls uh here's another example of an aerated static pile this one has a little different twist uh for one thing this is a negative variation system um so this is continuous bed of dairy cattle manure mostly from heers and calves so it's fairly highly beded it doesn't need need to be mixed with a lot of amendment to have the right quality composing and they just build these in strips okay and then start ating them the air gets pulled down through the bed and this is what it looks like underneath okay the aration systems in the floor the floor is covered with uh with wooden planks that have poles drilled in it beneath the wooden planks in is a trench the narration pipe that occas occasionally delivers or sucks air down through the wooden planks and into U manifold what's interesting about this system is they use it for heat recovery so here's the part we've seen at least uh in the composting building air moves down through the compost and then there's a manifold that's the blowers on the other side of the manifold that's what's sucking the air through the compost and then the blower Del the air to this heat exchange um this is a a bolt tank on one end and just a a large conduit maybe a foot long of PVC pipe on the other uh the hotar goes in the one end where the conduit is as a gas there's heat pipes in the middle heat pipe has refrigerant in it that the refrigerant evaporates on the hot end and then um condenses in the bulk tank where it gets cooled down and heats the water in the bulk tank and then that water is delivered to uh floor for facility heating um one Farm have you have used this to heat floors on their calf beds and you can pull off some hot water out of this um several Farms are doing this there's a a company called agrolab Technologies based in Vermont that is doing a lot of the Some Farms in New England um they have since moved away from this uh heat pipe type of heat exchanger and develop others some that you that they're starting to mount on these skits that can be move from Farm to farm so uh an interesting and intriguing twist to compost just another reason to compost is to recover that heat not being done a lot but in some places uh why not so the next method of composting would be within this giant category called contained or in vessel composting systems where the composting environment is closed within a container or vessel some of these are being done on farms by far uh it's mostly window RS and are static piles but there are places for these on certain farms under certain conditions okay almost all of these are require a second stage of composting that is the vessel is only first part of composting where it's most important to have that inment and almost all are situation where company's selling this vessel to you and they also support it but there's at least one example and probably more where it's homemade so this is a farm build in closed arated box might it might be called a tunnel or box composting system in other places and in this case it's handling dairy cattle and you can see a picture of the inside on the right there's positive varation in the floor uh the air taken out the headspace is Rec recirculated a bit fed in with some fresh air what this does give you is a just a little bit more control both of odors and the process I'm not sure on a farm this is Justus um but this farmer um felt that he could pull it off by building it himself and he also wanted to recover the heat so there's some heat tubes in the top of this vessel in the top of this tunnel that are just circulating air through the composting space circulating water through the composting space and picking up some heat and using it to u to feed this uh radiator that blows warm air into their shop across the way so just another example um this is less than an example and just a point that these types of invest systems are called agitated Bays they're like windr only they have solid walls and there's an automatic Turner that runs through um without an operator that turn the material in these bays and also move it along doesn't just turn the material in place tends to pick it up and shift it so there's a material handling advantages here here most of these when they're on farms are um used for poultry minor because um poul is a little more difficult to compost because of the odor and high nitrogen content um and many cases it's not mended with with low nitrogen so some a lot of this is targeted here's a commercial system um okay it's called an earth system by the Green Mountain Technologies company um this is a small scale could call an agitated Bay or an agitated vessel but um it's one of its Target uses is on hor Stables who have um hor Bing that they want to turn into compost and this can be done on site drums uh drums are another type of invest system uh key thing about drums it's a very short compost most drums handle material from 3 to six days and then it goes out and the advantage of the drum is it gets the process going quickly and it contains the material when it's most odorous okay so here's four examples all but the one on the upper right hand side are on farms the one on the upper right hand side is at a college but again it could be a farm uh and so they put the materials through quickly and then stack them in windr or piles or area static piles to finish the composting except the one on the bottom left really is just recycling manure beded manure to recover the bedding and re so these drums are used in a lot of cases for that but there're another legitimate invest system for CLS how am I doing on time now Lind um we've got like six minutes left six minutes okay let's talk quickly about the site um the characteristics of a site so here's a farm the farmsteads up top that that hypothetical situation is looking to um to compost on site and they're kind of identified this piece of land as a potential compost area so what do we need to know to see if this is a a a legitimate site a feasible site or not well we've got to look at a couple things about the site is the land slope uh which way does water flow uh when it falls on the site in this case there's sort of compound slope down in in each of these directions right so it' be straight down diagonally um other features of the site that you need to identify which direction is the prevailing wind I don't I don't put too much importance in prevailing wind direction in most cases because the wind changes so much in almost every site it glows from every direction um often enough that prevailing wind isn't a good predictor where odors are going to go most of the time but still it's good to know there's a creek near the site that's important because we can't be too close to that residences very important because that might be uh oder impacts there and we want to know the distances from these things there are regulations that determine how far at a minimum you need to be from these things I can tell you those minimum separation distances between a composting site and residence they're not enough to um prevent odor impacts to those resen you need to have good management as well but these are some of the things you need to identify where's the water which way is the lands slope where are the residences and other other people that might be impacted where's the wind so this particular Creek is about 300 ft from the edge of the composting site that's not bad most regulations would say that's within limits it would be buildable um there's a gravel road access to a composing site is important in this case there's a gravel road that connects the comple site to The Farmstead which is where the materials going to come from Mostly Manor so that's another important feature of the site um so when you identify where you going to do the things on your site based upon this uh I might mention on this particular site um I might discourage this composter from from choosing this site largely because not how far the residences are from the site but because few of them are directly downhill so on on a cold clear night where you get a temperature inversion and not much wind um you get the condition where air from a composing site that might that might be on a hill or Plateau as this one is would drain down downhill um and collect in low areas and cause odor that way this particular site is susceptible to that because of where the residents are uh and the the cold perhaps odorous air could collect in that uh in that stream gra so then you can look a little closer and decide what you can do and where you can put things uh and then from these Circle diagrams which is our way to start you can start doing a more detailed design maybe to scale but those are the features of the site again water is going to be important um increasingly important because water that runs off the working areas is fairly heavily polluted um it has a lot of solids in it that um and so runoff carries a lot of organic matter has a high bod level and could um become odorous over time so what you want to do is first of all you want to keep clean runoff that would tend to run onto the site from running onto the site you want to divert it around the site and that's what these features circled in blue are they're dkes or BMS and channels that are are intercepting the run on in this case in diverting it around the site and then you want to keep the water that does fall on the site on the site by collecting it and then concentrating it or treating it if NE necessary and so you would put it in a pond or an infiltration area never directly into a stream because it's fairly strong in organic so you need to capture it contain it treat it if necessary reuse it that's the best way to do it um but need to control water on the site as I said earlier most of the strength of the water is in its um is in a sediment that it carries so an easy way to improve the quality of the runoff water is to get sediment out and that's fairly easy you can use compul filter socks that are shown in uper right hand corner or filter BMS of compost or wood chips uh or actually a constructed sediment basin to do that but it's better to keep that if you're storing water in a pond it's better to to take out the the siment before it goes to the pond so the pond does itself doesn't get motus uh common question is you need a paveed site and I would say really for for sure only if the regulations require it that's rarely required Farm situations but it might be some cases and if regulations don't require it then probably you don't need PVE site but it's an advantage to have one um so even though it might be costly uh it can be worthwhile for instance in this picture this is you know what happens in in the spring when the snow melts around the site at least on a day like today um this operation could work they have an an asphalt path okay odor odor is going to be a problem there's a lot of things that can do um when composting generates odors because materials decompose the composting SE it's it's inherent connection decomposition odors are going to but you don't necessarily have an odor problem you don't have an odor problem till the odors are emitted um and then they travel to someone who's G to to OBC so there are several stages in an odor in the atomy of an odor problem where composting facility can intervene um to lessen that odor and make it acceptable to the neighborhood and Community um and one of those is befriending the community and others are more um operational on the compost side okay so here are some odor management uh practices I'll call it the greatest hits isolated site is the best thing you can have keep from overloading the site with the organic materials because the more organic the more materials there are on the site that can generate odor the stronger the going to be contain or enclose odor sources if necessary but then there are there are simpler U measures like prompt handling of feed stocks follow good composting practices maintain grocy um CDN ratio moisture Contour where there should be and air a few more Ely turning watch when you turn not just how often but turn only when needed because when turning is done it's a quick intense release of odors uh one of my favorite oor control measures uh certainly uh well Su to F is you use a bio cover okay the bio cover is nothing other than a layer on top of a pile or window that's generating odors it's a layer of material uh mostly compost or pre compost before it's screen that still has some Woody material in it and you just put it on top and it's simple containment and what happens is the air moving up through the top of the pile is it is absorbed and water is condensed in this layer and much of the odor is contained not all of it and broken down in this layer so a very simple uh underused method of Odor Control so I know I went through all that kind of fast um six minutes is probably up if you want more information uh The Institute for local self reliance is having uh it's webinar and I believe they also have an online course that you can take to learn more about it I teach um with uh my partner Matt cotton of foundations of Composting class it's a one-day class we teach this at the beginning of the US composting Council conference every year uh this year it's in Austin um and I'm sure we'll be teaching on January fourth that mass man there is Matt um teaching if you want even more training um there were a number of multi-day Hands-On training programs around uh Maine has had one for a long time I don't know when they're starting theirs up again but the US compost or excuse me the compost research and Education Foundation runs a five-day course um around different parts of the country um and it's been fairly popular here's an idea of the curriculum um for you to get some Hands-On training if you'd like uh the composting facility tours are particularly good that's why I highlighted okay I think I made it within time so thank you very much I apologize for rushing through this um but that's the time we have and hopefully I can answer unanswered questions for you now yes exactly that is what we are going to do so thank you Dr rink for a great presentation um we have been collecting some questions as they've been coming in um so starting with a um clarification on the hot stage of composting the graph that you showed uh indicated it might take 1 to n months for the active composting phase um but the person usually hears two to three weeks during that phase before before it moves into finishing or curing any comments on that if if you have an A A A close to ideal process um you can do that in two to three weeks um you can you can make compost that is ready to move into the curing phase with an ideal process and suitable feed stocks but in my experience uh in order to get Most Feed stocks to the point where it can go to a curing pile and should be piled without turning takes a lot longer than three excuse me three weeks more like two months at a minimum again it depends upon the feed stocks slowly composting feed stocks feed stocks that may have gone through some decom some uh stabilization already it could work for example um the standard method for composting biosolids um which was developed by the USDA at the Belville research station sometimes it's called the Bel aat static pile method typically recommended composting under ation for three weeks and then go to curing for a month bio first of all biosolids has already been through aerobic digestion process so it's partially stab but even then I don't think biosolids can be stabilized in three weeks I think it needs longer that's my personal feeling I think if you're going for three weeks you're rushing it but if you're doing that you need an ideal process certainly for a station uh uh a fairly large amount of bulking agent that allows the Iration to be uh evenly distributed um and um the right seat end ratio and so on I think three weeks push that's great and that actually leads into another question how do you recommend getting good free airspace um the best way to get free air space is to mix the materials to a bulk density uh of less than a th000 pounds per cubic yard by adding dry bulking materials wood chips would be um the best is usually the best choice because they're chunky they have good structure they stand up in a pile um they don't compress they don't glose or structure as they decompose um in fact they go through the composting process almost unchanged and if you're not using them for mulch um you would end up screening them out wi chips are the best amendment of pick to mix with other materials to get that three a space don't have wood chips you can do it with other bulky materials like corn cops would be great peanut hols would be great um chop straw um even sawdust but if if you use sawdust you're going have to use a lot of it and probably dry the material out too much more and then add water back um the chunk of your material about which of stand uh there's a question about whether you can make good compost using a large static pile that doesn't get turned much um and is also not actively arated yes you can make good compost in a large static pile um some people make good compost in very large static piles um I use the term massive passive for those um so what you have to do in that case is weight um the key to making compost when the conditions aren't good so like in a large pile that isn't AED much um is a weit for time to do its work so I I showed that picture where uh passively irrated piles heat up inside and that's the main way to aate well in large piles if there's not a great deal of air flow through that thermal effect then you're relying on diffusion and it's going to take diffusion a while for that oxygen to creep into the the pile and uh and the organisms to uh decompose the material so yeah you can use a large pile um and you just have to take longer to do it that in itself is not a problem the problem with large piles and waiting for them is that it um greatly increases the risk of spontaneous combustion occurring in the pile for that reason I don't recommend it um but I can pretty much say that if you have a large pile of actively decomposing material and you leave it in place without moving it in within a month or two um you're going to get fire and that could be serious so although yes you can make compost in large piles without Force variation um you're increasing the risk of fire great okay and then uh question about the Biol layer and whether six in say something like six inches of wet straw would work as a Biol layer or any other recommendations for easily removable materials to use as a biolayer well once you're making compost you'll have compost at your disposal to use as a biolayer and that's the best one um it's better if the compost has some paracity to it that will allow the the passive air movement that is already curring to to to continue on through the biolayer um but just finished compost will work and a 6 inch six four to six inch layer will do of that um if you if you have a screen and Screen overs will work pretty well um my next suggestion would be a mixture of compost and wood chips um next after that would be just wood chips uh straw would work the problem with straw is is it t it becomes matted down when it gets wet and it can become a barrier irration um so that would be the problem with straw but I think as a containment me mechanism it would it would contain odors it would just um make the Iration condition within the pile chop straw with be better than UNS awesome thank you for all those options uh and the last question that I'm going to ask before we do some final polling and close things up uh I think is an important one it's about uh curing is always discussed um as an important phase of composting but what's the actual downside if any of spreading a pile of on the field that is not completely cured um the downside of spreading material that is not completely C is that um it has it still has um some compounds the compost still has some compounds um that are phytotoxic that that would hurt hurt the plants but if you're merely spreading compost on top of a of a um a field let's say during the fall or winter or um onto a fow field uh it shouldn't be a problem so so um that's where I said the intended use of the C post is important in fact if you're spreading compost on the field um Navy stability is not that important all and you can cut it short you don't even have to cure it uh depends entirely on its use if you're putting compost into a potting media it has to be very stable if you're incorporating compost into a garden it has to be fairly stable but spreading it on a field especially when um the field is not growing anything at the moment fine go ahead and do it saving yourself time and money awesome so I'm gonna call it there with the questions but thank you all for submitting them and um I hope that some of the other ones that you all submitted will be answered in F future sessions uh but before we go uh just a few more quick polls first one being as an overview of the fundamentals of on Farm composting this webinar had too much information the right amount of information or not enough information giveing you all just a few more seconds all righty it's always good to see this that a vast majority say the right amount of information so thank you Dr rink for doing that um next question uh are there any questions that this presentation that were not answered by this presentation any questions you had about on Farm composting fundamentals I realized that it often take some time to digest this information before you realize what questions you still have so hopefully um yall will get some answered in future sessions as well okay couple more seconds so we're pretty e pretty split um but majority says no great uh we are considering doing like a live Q&A at some point um if that's of Interest let us know and invited back some of the presenters from the series so let us know if that's of Interest final question um do you plan to participate in any of the other webinars in this series yes no maybe just a couple more seconds all right vast majority says yes say yes that's fa fabulous for us to know and we're so glad uh the series is designed to sort of build over time um and hopefully we'll get to answer all of those questions the burning questions you have about on Farm composting and compost use so thank you so much Dr rink uh for your great presentation and thank you all for participating and we'll look forward to seeing you at the next webinar okay thank you all",
