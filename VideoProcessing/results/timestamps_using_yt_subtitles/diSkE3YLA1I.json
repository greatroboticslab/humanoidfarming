  "text": "hello everybody keith burns and davis bailey here with green cover seed we're going to give you a quick plot tour uh we call these this our overwintering plots davis tell us a little bit about how the plots were set up and when they were planted these plots were planted september 30th it was we wanted to focus mostly on the cereals and the legumes that we use in over wintering mixes we tried a few brassicas mixed in with some clovers and we didn't see exceptional sand there just a little bit too late but again we have the overwintering cereals and grasses the legumes here right now we're in the clovers and we've got four clovers here we've got fixation blanca clover kentucky pride crimson clover right here i'm standing in the yellow clover and then we've got the big red clover a newer variety for us so several things that we're really going to stress and point out as we work our way through this number one this was probably planted later than what we would want if we wanted to try to establish clovers and you'll see that the clovers aren't the greatest thing that we have out here uh but it's it's a you know in a september beginning of october is a realistic time for when uh we would plant a lot of cover crops in a typical fall uh the second thing is we got to record cold levels this winter i know my thermometer said 34 below zero one morning so we were extraordinarily cold but you cannot tell that from these plots we had some of the best overwintering that we've ever had and that goes to show you how powerful of an insulator snow is because when we got that cold we had probably 12 to 16 inches of snow really laid nicely across all these plots and we had extraordinary overwintering ability in fact this crimson clover that i'm standing in this happens to be kentucky pride crimson clover this is probably one of the nicest stands of crimson clover we've ever had over winter and i would say i've probably only seen crimson over winter here maybe three out of the last 12 years and and that tells you how good that snow was at insulating things because we would not see this even in a relatively mild winter with no snow cover so the so the crimson clover is obviously the fastest growing clover uh it's it's the biggest so far it's got a really good stand kentucky pride is an improved version of a dixie type crimson clover so i'm excited to see how this looks and how this works the bellonsa clover next to it here and this is not surprising balance is a kind of a slow starter it's it's going to look slow but once it starts growing and kicking in it's really going to grow fast and it will overtake this crimson clover and the amount of biomass produced this spring we will be out here to give periodic updates and show how this is growing and which one is kind of catching up uh the yellow blossom too late for it to really establish so i'm not surprised that uh there's not a lot out there there's there's some it's sporadic it's not the greatest stand but again for yellow blossom we would want to probably establish that uh the end of august would really be more ideal on that and then the red clover a perennial type clover so it's going to come on it'll probably fill in but again a poor stand again just far far too late to really get it established right so you know sometimes when we do these plots we want to demonstrate things that we don't recommend and and this is why we wouldn't recommend putting these clovers in this late because you're just not going to have the best chance of success on those right yeah when we came out here beginning of march it's april 15th right now so about a month ago i was surprised to see that the only clover that was visible at that time was the crimson clover as you think about it it's not quite as surprising because if it is the fastest growing clover which it is since we had that nice blanket of snow it over wintered exceptionally well and so it makes sense that we see it with the best stand right here right now like you said i think we expect that fixation to kick in a little bit later we'll come back in a couple weeks and give you an update on this okay these next set of plots are winter peas which again are not the most reliable overwintering legume for us but again with the snow that we had these are some of the nicest winter peas that we've had as well davis tell us what we got planted here we have three strips here two of the strips these first two are austrian winter peas the first strip is planted at one and a half inches deep the second strip where keith is standing is two and a half inches deep and then where i'm standing here are our new wyo winter peas and what depth were those planted at they were planted at two and a half inches and a half also and one of the reasons that we wanted to plant them deeper is that typically to get a winter peat over winter the deeper you plant it the better it is because you got to keep the growing point under the ground to keep it from freezing off and so we would have expected in a normal winter for these deeper planted ones to look better than the shallow planted ones at an inch and a half but they look fine but again that's because we had we had the snow cover and so you know there's there's maybe some subtle differences i i think the wild winters maybe look a little bit nicer a little more even stand and what the wild winters are it is a fairly new variety developed by the university of wyoming thus the name uh it is a selection out of austrian winter peas so they're not going to look a lot different but they've been selected to overwinter uh in cold dry winters they were you know developed there in laramie wyoming on the high plains and so we think that it's going to be a better pea our growers of these really like them they like them better than the regular austrians they have overwintered consistently now for three years up in northern nebraska where one of our growers are at and so we're pretty excited about them we think that it's going to be our winter pea of the future you know again for right now if you look davis you can see there's a number of these plants that have some some burning on on the down at the base i'm guessing that some of the early growth that was out here probably got cold enough to where it froze off part of that but again a win a peak and freeze everything above the ground off as long as the growing point under the ground has not frozen it will keep growing new shoots out and so i'm guessing that what we're seeing is some of the early growth that kind of got singed a little bit with some cold weather but they've grown out of it just fine and i think they're going to continue to to grow and and we've actually behind these trees over here we have a few acres that we may let grow out and see if we can harvest some of these wild winter peas as well yeah even where you see the frost damage you see new shoots like keith is talking about but you also see out of that same chute actually significant growth even though we've got the brown leaves below it so right next to the winter peas we have winter lentils these are morton winter lentils it's actually the only variety that i'm aware of that is a true winter lentil lentils are in the same family as peas and vetch they are kind of the less aggressive cousin i guess i would say to vetch we've actually seen pretty good consistent winter hardiness out of these winter lentils and again this year is no exception pretty good stand lentils are never going to take over a plot they don't vine like a vetch does they kind of stay a little bit more contained within themselves but they're a really good companion crop you're not going to get great weed control from lentils by themselves so we would never unless you're trying to grow them for seed we would never want to see you put lentils in alone but they're a nice companion crop to other mixes that you would do so we sell more spring lentils and winter lentils but these winter lentils did really well this year yeah certainly something to put in a mix because you can see it establishes beautifully but if you're wanting to plant a cover crop primarily for weed suppression i certainly wouldn't count on lentils alone all right davis now we come to hairy vetch cherryvatch know we touted as the most reliable overwintering of all legumes and and again we had good snow cover so a lot of it did over winter uh but we've got we've got some interesting things to look at here in the harry vetches so go ahead and and tell us what we've got planted here right next to the cereals there we've got woolly pod vetch oftentimes we would consider that here in nebraska more of a spring vetch really good drought resistance and we use it in a lot of places in the country a lot of different times of the year i think next to it is spanish vetch and i'll let you talk more about that one but then as we get into the true hairy vetches here we have a you merit i'm standing in the montana hairy vetch then next to me is the winter king and next to that in between the winter king and the lentils is purple bounty yeah so i'll just kind of compare and contrast these a little bit so starting over uh with the woolly pod like like davis said it it's it's actually not a true winter annual it's a very cold tolerant spring annual again some of the best overwintering wooly pod veg that we've seen if you're going to plant a vetch in the springtime it's one of the most aggressive fastest growing biggest biomass vetches you can plant in the spring the spanish fetch frankly is a little disappointing to me this is hairy vetch that we brought in from spain we knew that it probably doesn't have as good a cold tolerance and we're seeing that even you know it has less cold tolerance evidently than even wooly pod i think it's going to be a good batch as long as we keep it further south to where the winters are going to be more mild it's definitely a less expensive one so we're going to just keep it in the south the two nicest ones out here by far as we look at the plots are they are the au merit in what we call our montana vetch and and the montana vetch is obviously grown in montana au merit is a is a fairly new hairy vetch uh it in the previous plots that we've had it's the best hairy vetch that i've ever seen uh we'll see how it does this year i i say it in the montana are looking pretty similar right now we are doing some seed production on au merit this year we got licensed to be able to do some of that so we've never had very good supply of it so i'm excited to have better supply of both of these vetches they're both very aggressive growing they both have overwintered quite well eu merit looks a little better right here in this area but as i look down uh through the strips i'd say you know they're they're very similar the montana bench maybe is even a little better right now down that way so we'll we'll really monitor this keep an eye on it and then we'll definitely be collecting biomass samples of a lot of these as well to see what kind of nitrogen fixation production we've gotten in biomass accumulation the winter king winter king is a variety that was developed more for eastern wet winters where they don't get as cold but they're going to have more freeze thaw cycles that's a little bit different type of overwintering mechanism needed i will see if it fills in it it doesn't look as good as these others right now there's a stand there it just doesn't have quite as much growth and then the purple bounty one over here uh it's touted as being the earliest hairy vetch on the market uh i would predict that we'll see it bloom earlier than all these others but we want to keep a really close eye on that and we'll make good notes of when we see each one of these bloom to verify that that really is one of the earliest maturing vetches on the market the winter king last year we had it in our plots and it looked about the same here in comparison to the other vetches but it actually came on these next few weeks a little bit quicker than some of the others and so i expect that one too even though it looks the furthest behind out of these four um i'm excited to see that in a couple weeks yeah that'll be good to see how they how they doing over the next several weeks all right now we come to the king of all cover crops and that's cereal rye cereal rye is the most widely used cover crop both within green cover seed and also within the cover crop industry as a whole mostly because you it's so cold tolerant it's so aggressive growing this time of year in the spring it just can't be beat when it comes to that now we've told many of you many times that there's a big difference between l albon rye which is where i'm standing and all other types of rye and this is going to be a great video to show that we're not just blowing smoke when we say that it's actually true this albon ride again all planted at the same time right at the very end of september this elbon right here is you know 18 to 20 inches tall what we have over here is ryman rye which is a would be considered a northern canadian dakota type rye it is about 12 to 14 inches at the most and then where davis is standing here is our yankee rye which again is more of that northern type and it's it's about i would say it's similar to the rhyme and maybe just slightly taller but just elbon was bred for oklahoma it was bred for maximum fall growth and very very fast spring growth and you can definitely see that if you want something that's going to give you the most growth the fastest in the spring elbon is your go-to rye davis what's your observations here yeah if you're wanting quick growth as soon as possible maybe you're grazing cattle early in the spring elbon is a man amongst boys when it comes to ryze and all other all other forage options really but i think we talked too about how it's not necessarily just about early growth or biggest growth maybe maybe some of these uh shorter stature options right now um fit better in a in a roller crimping situation for hitting a different window yeah yeah if you're if you're not planting corn until the middle of may this stuff may be too far ahead for you you may need to go with either a northern rye or even a triticale which we'll look at here next this can get out too far ahead of you but again for the cattle guy that wants grazing as soon as possible man you just can't beat albon for that and and again it's you know it's winter hardiness is proven uh you know could you take it up to canada and have overwintering every year i don't know uh but you know certainly for nebraska and south and and we're growing it in south dakota we've got growers growing albon forests up in the dakotas so we know it moves north but it's just hard to beat when it comes to that early fast aggressive growth and this will be the first one that will be to a stage where it can reliably roll down as well so again we'll continue to monitor this and we'll see what the differences are here in a couple of weeks one other note on these ryes you have to look pretty hard in these rows to find a weed whereas in some of the other rows uh the weeds even from the camera are probably a little bit more visible um here there's just a big difference and it's not just a matter of this being taller and you can't see them um it's just significantly better at weed suppressing all right now we're in the triticale plots and i think we've got five different types of triticale here so davis go ahead and set the table on what we've got planted here next to keith there we have forage fx 1001 right here is thor triticale i'm standing in the fridge next to me here is the 813 and then we have surge as the last of these five so i'll just tell you a little bit of the background on on all these first of all they all they'll look great uh they all came through the winter really well uh they're they're obviously smaller shorter less growth than the rye uh not surprising it's what we would expect you know we're only looking at uh you know 8 to 10 inches of growth right now but we know that that's just how triticale is so the forage fx 1001 is one of the nicest triticales i've seen especially as you go from where we are here in nebraska and you go north this this thing was bred in montana and it's a real workhorse it's it's truly a beardless triticale it's going to be a really beautiful smooth looking crop when it heads out and very good growth and and tonnage it you know again they all overwintered great because we had that snow cover had we had more of an open uh ground when it got so cold i would have expected this one to look the best it's going to have the best cold hardiness of any of these triticales in my opinion uh the thor thor is a brand new one from trical which we we grow a lot of tri-cal products thor is a new one that is fully facultative and what facultative means is that it can act as a spring type or it can act as a winter type so it can vernalize go dormant and come back in the spring like it's done here but we could be planting we're selling thor to people and they're planting it right now it does not have to vernalize in order to give you all the growth potential that it has so it's a very versatile one we're pretty excited about it it's going to be a replacement for the surge they look fairly similar it's a newer type triticale though so it's got better disease resistances bred into it so we anticipate this one being a really good replacement for the surge that we've had this is fridge fridge is just kind of the old school standby it's a public variety so you know you may see more people selling it typically what we see with fridge is it's always kind of there but it's never going to yield or have the performance and i think you can even see that here it just it's not as robust it's not as green it's not as tall as these other newer type varieties but if you're not looking to maximize your forage and you're just looking for a little bit less expensive triticale the fridge is not a bad way to go and then we come to 813 813 has has been our top selling triticale over the last four or five years it's kind of been one of the flagship products in the tri-cal lineup we grow and sell lots of 813. 813 is partially facultative so when you plant it in the spring it's not going to be as good as thor or surge but it's going to be better than fridge or any of the cereal rise for sure as you move this south it has because it's partially facultative it will have more fall growth in the south and it will get going in the spring a little quicker than a true winter type uh like the like the forage fx i wouldn't take that one south uh as far as what i would take 813 or the thor so again excited to see what this is going to look like as we grow out a little bit more and then of course the surge surge has been our facultative or spring treated cayley for a number of years now we're going to be phasing that out because we're replacing it with the thor all right davis now we're standing in in the wheat plots and typically we don't think of wheat as being as much of a forage crop as what rye or triticale but these first two are our forage wheats they've been specially bred to have a lot of forage so tell us the difference in the types of wheats that we have here tell us what we got planted right there is the t173 wheat and then here is the willow creek this may be the later maturing one so the t-173 is a little bit taller right now but i think the willow creek might actually be tillered just a little bit more as from a distance you see it more as a carpet rather than being able to see the defined rows with the t-173 and then over here we've got gore wheat and hard red wheat yeah so just real briefly davis is you're exactly right this is a fairly new wheat the t173 a forage wheat and actually a lot of people are growing this one for grain too it's it's done pretty well uh these forage wheats especially this willow creek right where i'm standing the the place where we would use willow creek is when we want a a winter cereal like this and we want to have grazing as deep into the late spring early summer as possible this is the longest maturing of all of the cereals in this plot and when we come out here several weeks later you're just going to see that this one is going to look a little slower it's just because it's got a longer growing season it will eventually probably be as big as many of the ryes and triticales it's just going to take longer to get there and so the reason you'd want to do that is if you're staging your grazing you would have a willow creek field to go to last that would be the main advantage of it the t173 is definitely going to be a better fit from nebraska and south the willow creek may be a better fit from nebraska and north kind of kind of yet to be seen willow creek has montana genetics the t-173 i think is coming from this either kansas or oklahoma i'm not 100 sure gore is probably one of the most widely used uh beardless and by the way these are all beardless except for this just regular hard red winter wheat gore is probably the most widely used beardless and it's actually a soft red winter wheat used in oklahoma and south we put it in our plots up here not necessarily expecting a lot because a lot of years we would see significant winter kill damage on it but again with the snow cover we're not seeing that this year so it'll be interesting to see how it grows out and it compares a very good grazing weed it's widely used across the state of oklahoma for grazing and then of course just regular hard red winter wheat that you know guys would plant this would be more of a grain type and not a forage type so as these grow we'll be able to kind of compare growth stages and biomass accumulations all right winter oats davis these aren't supposed to overwinter here in nebraska we kind of we put them in every year just to show people that you shouldn't plant them this far north if you want them to overwinter and again the snow cover is proving us wrong so we didn't have a great test of winter hardiness but it goes to show you if you have snow cover temperature really doesn't matter we've got the cossack black oats here which are very popular especially in the south it's more of a forage type oat than a regular white oat we wouldn't plant these generally in the spring we would be planting these in the late summer and letting them grow deeper into the winter excellent forage oat is probably going to give you more biomass and tonnage than a white spring oat overall when planted in you know that august type time frame and then bob winter oats is just kind of an old standby uh winter white oat they both look really pretty good um you know i you know we'll see how they grow the one thing that i have noticed right here and if you're looking not nearly as good a weed control as what we saw over in the rye plots you just want to make a few comments on that yeah i mean maybe it's a little bit of the allopathic effect maybe it's a little bit i would say mostly just because it's not as full it's not as tall so it's simply not suppressing the weeds as well from that standpoint i think the cossack oats are just a little bit fuller filling the road gaps just a little bit more than we have here in the bob oats but like you said last year we had these in the plots and we had pretty much nothing winter barley davis tell us what we've got here keith is standing in the valor barley and i'm here in the 919 barley the 919 is probably the one that we use more of right now but what do you see for differences in genetics yeah you know they look fairly similar right now it's a little hard to tell the valor maybe looks like it has a bit of an edge but you know we'll see as they go along valor is a fairly new one we don't know a lot about it yet we've had some production done down in oklahoma on it it looks pretty promising 919 has kind of been our stand by winter barley but it's kind of susceptible to smut in in the springtime as it grows and matures so we're looking for something that maybe has a little better disease resistance we don't know valor is that 919 comes out of the university of nebraska winter barley breeding program and i know that they've got some coming that are going to be replacements for this there's lots of winter barleys on the market out there the thing that make these two unique is that they're beardless they're beardless barleys and if you've ever seen winter barley that's not beardless i mean you're talking about a beard those things have you know five six eight inch long beards would be very dangerous to graze them be would not make very good hay because of those long beards and so the only barleys that we want to offer are going to be the beardless barleys because a lot of what we sell goes into grazing and forage type mixes so we're only looking at those there's like say there's lots of other barleys out there but the beardless ones there's not that many of all right and and finally we have annual ryegrass this is a winterhawk annual ryegrass which is a example of a diploid type which are the most winter hardy of all annual rye grasses but annual ryegrasses as a family just are not going to be nearly as winter hardy as the rest of the cereals and you can see that i mean this actually looks pretty good for being planted at the end of september one of the keys to getting annual rye grass over winter is getting it established unlike rye which you can throw out there in december and it's going to be fine this time of year annual ryegrass has to get some root system established in order to survive through the winter and so planted the end of september is not as good of time as if you could get it planted early september in having good rye grass establishment so you know for for all things considered this isn't bad and it will fill in it's it's going to grow pretty aggressively here once it warms up it's just not a it's not as popular especially in drier areas because a lot of annual ryegrass has flown on in the eastern corn belt because the rains that they get they can get it coming up before they harvest the corn then they can get that earlier establishment and they have a better overwintering success so what are you seeing here davis yeah last year again when we didn't have the winter cover the snowfall that we had this year we didn't see much of this winter hawk again that's probably mostly timing as opposed to the plant itself but pretty decent right here probably one that we would put more so in a mix with some other grasses and some other options rather than counting on it alone we really like it for compaction breaking though and we put it in many compaction breaking mixes uh both the diploid and the tetraploid options yeah it's got a very deep root system so even though it's even when we come back out here later it's going to be the shortest of all of these it may still have just as deeper roots as any of them it's very deep rooting and that's one of its uh most attractive features all right so now we have three different combinations of albon rye and harry vetch and i'm assuming this is probably the montana hairy vetch it's what we probably most commonly use here uh and and we're not going to go into a lot of detail in this episode we're evaluating uh what kind of nitrogen production what kind of weed suppression and what kind of biomass we're going to get from different rates of l bond rye and hairy vet so we've got a strip here strip here and a strip over here and you know as i'm looking at this rye you know it's it's 18 to 20 inches tall i i actually i was measuring the other l but i think it's a little taller than the other l bond that's over there and the vetch is significantly bigger and taller than the monoculture vetch davis what's your your initial thoughts on this yeah we've got the three rates like he said we've got 20 pounds hairy vetch 20 pounds rye 15 vetch i believe 30 rye and then we've got 50 rye 10 vetch yeah it's amazing just seeing the difference of the vetch when it's able to have something to climb it at least looks a lot taller we'll see if we actually have a different amount of biomass we'll do some biomass cuttings of these and test the carbon nitrogen ratio we really liked last year how the hairy vetch and rye crimped together and so we'll see what the results show in a couple months again very good stands a little really looking forward to what we see as these grow out at the end of every plot we have to have what we call the vacuum cleaner mix so davis explain what we've got going on here as we're planting these plots we planted all the grasses first and the legumes what we do as we're vacuuming out the drill that the reservoir is filling up with all the seeds we mix that up at the end and then we plant it and we've got it around the back side of the strips as well and it's a great way to just showcase what happens when we plant things in diversity because here we've got all the different kinds of cereals i see rye grass in here we have hairy vetch and peas which again like we maybe saw in the mixes or the rye and veg combinations it's just climbing it has something to climb so it's it appears taller it fills in really nicely we even have winter lentils and the clovers in here just a little bit so it's just beautiful and i think it provides a lot of good grazing maybe a little bit more balanced ration and this i mean as you look down the road too it's just exceptional growth and i think this one would be good to take some samples on a little bit later yeah i mean there's just such great power and diversity and again as we as davis said we'll take the samples i wish there was a better way we could sample the roots and the root exudates and the biology that's surrounding that rhizosphere i don't know that we have the the technology to to really do that effectively yet it's coming i think but we just we know that this is doing great things for the soil because of all this diversity [Music] you",
