series we're excited to be back here for

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,000
the spring

7
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,679
horse grazing management series with

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,600
ndsu extension

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,119
my name is mary kina i'm the livestock

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,359
environmental management specialist at

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
the carrington research extension center

12
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,279
and you'll be hearing from me uh next

13
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,760
week and in a couple weeks

14
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,359
so today we have with us kevin sedevick

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,119
who's our range specialist

16
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,640
for ndsu extension he's also the

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,399
director of the central grasslands

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,000
research extension center

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,840
so kevin's going to go over horse

20
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,200
grazing management with us today

21
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,120
we also have rachel wald she's our

22
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
egg and natural resource extension agent

23
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
in mchenry county

24
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,840
and paige bruhmann who is our egg and

25
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,239
natural resource extension agent

26
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,600
in ward county and so those two are

27
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:53,199
going to supplement some of the things

28
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
that kevin's talking about

29
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,559
with some more boots on the ground kind

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,680
of action that you can take

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,359
and with that we will get rolling i'm

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:03,840
going to turn it over to kevin and

33
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:06,080
and we'll go ahead well thank you mary

34
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:09,119
and it is nice to be back

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,400
on this equine series um it's been a i

36
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:11,840
want to say it's been a nice day here at

37
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:13,040
central grasslands which were near

38
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:14,479
street or north dakota

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
because we had a quarter inch of rain

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
this morning and so that in itself is a

41
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:20,080
celebration of the day so

42
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,080
um we're gonna talk about grazing

43
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,920
management as it relates to horses and

44
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,360
the truth is it doesn't matter what

45
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:26,080
species you're grazing grazing

46
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:28,400
management

47
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:30,159
is a is an encompassing concept that

48
00:01:28,400 --> 00:01:30,880
fits whether it's horses or cattle or

49
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:32,880
sheep or

50
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,479
or whatever for animals that the

51
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
difference is you know horses tend to

52
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:37,680
graze a little bit differently

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,680
um but we'll kind of cover some concepts

54
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:40,000
here and and we'll get into um some

55
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,240
different

56
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,759
topic areas as well some of the topics

57
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,119
we've covered today is obviously

58
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:47,040
a little bit on grazing management but

59
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,880
we'll also cover um some of the key

60
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,240
species that you may find

61
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,920
um on your on your pastures and you know

62
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,240
when it comes to horses we almost

63
00:01:53,920 --> 00:01:57,600
typically see common types of grasses

64
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,439
in these horse pastures and so we'll

65
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,159
talk about some of those grasses to give

66
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,680
you a feel

67
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,360
for nutritional quality um palatability

68
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,640
and how they may fit into your grazing

69
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:07,920
program then we're going to hit some

70
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:08,959
topics on management that relates to

71
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:11,680
fertilizing

72
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,120
we'll hit some of the toxic plants um

73
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:14,239
just so you get a feel for if you have

74
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,400
these in your areas

75
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,440
to look for and what to do in case you

76
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,200
do have them

77
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,120
if you're looking to seed down a pasture

78
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,760
we'll talk about some seed mixes

79
00:02:21,120 --> 00:02:24,239
where you can get that seed from and

80
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,520
then we'll

81
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:29,680
and on on this side of the story on on

82
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:32,000
on that that how to manage those

83
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,000
grasslands once you see them

84
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,440
all right so let's talk about types of

85
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,879
grasses

86
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,000
next and we'll and

87
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:41,519
we'll kind of cover these we talked a

88
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,959
little bit about fertilizing potential

89
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,040
toxic plants and where to plant these

90
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,280
grasses

91
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:48,879
next rachel so let me start with

92
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,160
probably the most common grass that we

93
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,800
see in a lot of our pastures in north

94
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,720
dakota

95
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:54,640
especially horse pastures is smooth

96
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:56,720
brome grass um some of you may actually

97
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,400
have metal grown grass in your mixes

98
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,319
um the brome grasses are my favorite

99
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:00,959
mixes to put in for horses because

100
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:03,040
horses

101
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,800
really like brown grass it stays

102
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,879
palatable for them much of the season

103
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,239
it's high quality and it's a nice grass

104
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:09,120
that you can use whether you're grazing

105
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,200
geldings

106
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,800
mares even even mares the falls on their

107
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:13,599
side and so it's commonly you'll see

108
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:15,840
these bastards

109
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:17,760
it's also a common grass that we'll see

110
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
in our ditches so if you're putting up

111
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,480
a ditch haze this also fits very well

112
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:25,200
next

113
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,959
and this just shows you a picture of of

114
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,519
a mature brome grass to your right and

115
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:29,440
so may

116
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:31,200
those of you you'll see these blowing in

117
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:32,000
in the wind in the ditches or in your

118
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,159
pastures it's

119
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,440
a very broad-headed plant um when it

120
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:36,080
gets to this phase it tends to be a

121
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:38,720
little less

122
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,159
less palatable and lower in quality and

123
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,200
so if you are putting up hay at these

124
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,040
stages

125
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,319
especially if you have a lactating mare

126
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,000
or you have some sugar horses that

127
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,519
you're actually using quite a bit

128
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:50,720
you may need to supplement some protein

129
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,400
with these feeds next

130
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,959
the other one we see common throughout

131
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,159
north dakota is kentucky bluegrass this

132
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,159
is true whether you're in north dakota

133
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,319
south dakota minnesota

134
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,640
whether it's was planted in a mix or

135
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,400
it's invaded your bromen grass fields

136
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:07,200
it's now become common in most of our

137
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:09,360
pastures it's a much lower growing plant

138
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:10,959
um but it is very palatable horses

139
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:12,560
really do like bluegrass

140
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:14,879
especially when it's green and lush and

141
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
in the immature stage

142
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,560
in the ecology business we tend to look

143
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,840
at this grass as an invader

144
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:21,919
because it tends to invade our native

145
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:23,840
prairies but in terms of horses this is

146
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,520
a really good feed for horses

147
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:27,360
um like brome grass when it becomes

148
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,160
mature it becomes a little less

149
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:30,000
palatable

150
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,440
and also loses the quality and so

151
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,199
protein tends to be

152
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,560
an issue when this grass starts to

153
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:37,520
mature out

154
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,000
next and the third one i'm going to talk

155
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:39,680
about

156
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:41,199
is crested wheatgrass and this is more

157
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,520
of a grass we see

158
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,120
in the western dakotas eastern montana

159
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,440
eastern wyoming

160
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,720
very common in horse pastures when i

161
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:51,520
call west river

162
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,600
um it it does well in the drier climates

163
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:55,440
so if you're in a precip zone

164
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,600
of 14 inches or less we tend to go with

165
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,840
the crested over the bromes

166
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:00,960
uh horses do like it when it's in the

167
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,720
immature stage

168
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,400
they do not like it when it's in the

169
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:07,199
stage we see in this picture here

170
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,560
starts to head out and so in this phase

171
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:09,199
we tend to see a lot of it put up for

172
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,280
hay

173
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,720
versus grazing and almost almost always

174
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:14,320
is used in cattle feed

175
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:15,840
and so we call it a wolf plant at this

176
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,000
stage and it's just because it has a

177
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,520
poor palatability for horses

178
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:24,000
next so the last one i have here

179
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:25,680
is is quack grass and i did lump um

180
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,759
intermediate wheatgrass in this mix

181
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:29,280
we'll call them the wheat grasses on the

182
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,880
average horses

183
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:35,600
um like wheatgrass but they don't really

184
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,960
you know prefer it over a brome grass or

185
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,720
over a bluegrass

186
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,880
most of our wheat grasses are typically

187
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
seen in hay mixes

188
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,199
especially if you do a crp mix or you're

189
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:46,800
doing a cd mix for horses you'll see the

190
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,720
intermediate wheatgrass and slender

191
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,400
wheatgrass put in this mix

192
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:52,160
where you have invaded pastures if you

193
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:52,720
have a bromograss field or a bluegrass

194
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:54,960
field

195
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,880
that's a little bit salty they tend to

196
00:05:54,960 --> 00:05:58,800
get invaded with quackgrass which i have

197
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:01,039
in this picture here is quackgrass

198
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,080
horses absolutely love quackgrass in

199
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,160
this phase

200
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,919
and it's a very good high quality feed

201
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
and once it matures out it tends to

202
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,120
become less palatable

203
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,880
and you'll get you'll get some issues in

204
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,840
the next slider rachel

205
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:15,759
you'll see the picture here um of quack

206
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,280
where it can get a little bit coarse

207
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,039
so the last one we really have and

208
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,360
you'll see this more in in

209
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,479
the western half of the dakotas is

210
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,720
native pasture

211
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:26,080
when we get east most of our pastures

212
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,520
have been seeded for horses

213
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,360
so if you're in eastern dakota's

214
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:30,720
minnesota iowa

215
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:32,639
you almost always will see a seated

216
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,240
pasture in the western part of the state

217
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:35,919
so we'll see native pasture used for

218
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,240
horses it's a very good

219
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:38,960
high quality feed it provides year-round

220
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:40,880
grazing

221
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
because of the mixes of species in an

222
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,600
inner grass mix

223
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,960
and they're also very palatable they

224
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:46,240
tend to be a little bit lower in

225
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:49,039
production

226
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:50,319
compared to what i call an introduced or

227
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,919
improved species

228
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:54,160
like a metal brome or an intermediate

229
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:56,639
wheat grass but they tend to retain

230
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,240
quality better later in the season and

231
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,120
you can put these in about any different

232
00:06:58,240 --> 00:07:01,680
soil type

233
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:04,000
and get your mixes to fit very well next

234
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,680
slide please

235
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,120
the nice thing about native range is it

236
00:07:05,680 --> 00:07:08,880
is actually the most ecstatic

237
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,160
aesthetic value whenever you see the

238
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:11,680
pictures of horses

239
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,440
um you're riding a horse across

240
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
rangelands it's always a very

241
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,800
scenic area and i know one of our

242
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,080
speakers today paige has some beautiful

243
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,360
country up north of minot

244
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,199
where she gets a chance to ride and

245
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:22,800
she's actually on rangeland so it gives

246
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,160
you this aesthetic value that you can

247
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,400
use to enjoy your horse

248
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:28,560
on rangelands besides just a feed base

249
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,560
so next

250
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:32,639
so one of the management scenarios you

251
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,520
can do to improve the tonnage

252
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,479
of your forages on those pastures um is

253
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,000
fertilizing

254
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,919
and so whether you have a crested or a

255
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:40,560
brome field or even an orchard grass

256
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:41,840
field

257
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:44,000
if you're calling from iowa and you got

258
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,560
a timothy field they will always

259
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,879
be deficient of fertility once they get

260
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,639
to be about three to five years of age

261
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:52,000
and so we highly recommend fertilizing

262
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,160
these stands to one

263
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,919
keep them healthy and vigorous but to

264
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,400
also increase the tonnage

265
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,680
on these stands this is a picture of a

266
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,160
typical bluegrass

267
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,840
stand that's fertilized in the top

268
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,720
unfertilized in the bottom

269
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:06,400
and you can see there's quite a

270
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:08,400
difference there's not only greenness

271
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:10,800
but you'll see a difference in color

272
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:12,479
you'll also see a difference in quality

273
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
when you fertilize these fields

274
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:16,400
they tend to be higher in quality as

275
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,160
well next slide

276
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,400
and so this is actually a bromograss

277
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,160
field taken in south dakota

278
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:23,840
you can see the strips this test strip

279
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:25,919
on the right is fertilized

280
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
the control is not fertilized so you can

281
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:29,440
see how it grows much more aggressively

282
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,680
after a fertilizer program

283
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,360
you get a greener color and so on the

284
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:35,120
average we tend to produce about 50

285
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,519
percent more biomass

286
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,440
when you fertilize versus not fertilize

287
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,519
and if you haven't fertilized in

288
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,959
over five years or more you can tend to

289
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:44,640
double your production by the second

290
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:45,440
year of fertilizing so it's just a great

291
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,959
practice

292
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:48,800
to increase your your quality and

293
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,920
tonnage on that hate field around that

294
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:53,920
grazing field next

295
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,680
so when we look at fertilizing these are

296
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,560
some examples rod put fertilizer down

297
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:58,160
it's brome

298
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,959
crested wheatgrass intermediate wheat

299
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:03,760
grass timothy orchard grass

300
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,800
any pasture that's been seeded will not

301
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,480
have that

302
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,240
symbiotic relationship as we say with

303
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,640
the soil microbes and

304
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:11,519
lack what's called a fast nutrient salt

305
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,080
flow

306
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,080
do not fertilize native pastures native

307
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,760
pastures do not become

308
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:19,120
deficient of nitrogen because of the

309
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,000
microbial population with the native

310
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,080
pastures

311
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:23,920
if you fertilize native pastures they

312
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,440
will change and shift to

313
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,680
mainly in our country of bluegrass

314
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,640
pasture so only on these improved

315
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:31,360
pastures

316
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
uh so and so you can see where the

317
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,839
benefit will be in terms of production

318
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,560
and quality

319
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,959
next so

320
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:40,080
what what to fertilize with and you can

321
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,560
go next rachel's so

322
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:43,600
the most common fertilizer will use is

323
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920
nitrogen

324
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,440
um if you go to a sales person and they

325
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,640
and you tell you want to buy fertilizer

326
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,680
for your pasture

327
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,760
they're going to try and sell you

328
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:54,800
nitrogen phosphorous

329
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,920
and potassium the only one that actually

330
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:59,120
adds

331
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,200
tonnage or production is nitrogen and so

332
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,480
it is the only one that i ever recommend

333
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,440
on domestic pastures you could add some

334
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,040
p and k

335
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,200
you won't be able to pay for it in terms

336
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,079
of tonnage but you might pay for it in

337
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,839
terms of

338
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,839
of different mineral contents within the

339
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:14,800
grasses but for me nitrogen's your

340
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:16,959
limiting factor

341
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:18,079
in the western half of the dakotas even

342
00:10:16,959 --> 00:10:20,800
in montana wyoming

343
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:22,079
we do about 40 to 60 pounds per acre of

344
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,839
actual nitrogen

345
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,839
and after you do it back to back years

346
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:27,680
we do it every other year

347
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:29,279
in the eastern dakotas and in minnesota

348
00:10:27,680 --> 00:10:31,279
and iowa we go about

349
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:32,560
60 to 80 pounds of nitrogen that's

350
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:35,440
actual nitrogen

351
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,120
um every for the first two years and

352
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,240
once you get into a program it's every

353
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:41,519
other year

354
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,200
next and so when do you fertilize

355
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,519
we're really reaching probably what i

356
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,680
call the end time of fertilizing

357
00:10:45,519 --> 00:10:48,640
in the northern plains so late april to

358
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,640
mid may

359
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:51,839
is preferred and if you give if i gave

360
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:54,320
you the option i would tell you to

361
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,760
fertilize as early as possible

362
00:10:54,320 --> 00:10:57,600
so you can do it during the cooler

363
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,959
climates and when the moisture is there

364
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:00,800
to give it that benefit

365
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:05,120
the most common fertilizer we use is

366
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:07,920
urea it is straight nitrogen so it's 46

367
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,399
nitrogen so 100 pounds of urea will have

368
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,880
46 pounds of nitrogen

369
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,399
and we typically will top dress this on

370
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:15,200
a pasture so the picture you'll see to

371
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:17,440
your right

372
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,040
just shows you a a spreader that's

373
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,200
spreading fertilizer and you can see the

374
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:23,200
white little

375
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
molecule or parts of that fertilizer on

376
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,079
the ground

377
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,000
and these need about a quarter inch of

378
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,560
moisture to get them to dissolve

379
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:31,680
and put into the soil once you're in the

380
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:33,519
soil

381
00:11:31,680 --> 00:11:36,320
you start to see the activity from that

382
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,320
benefit next

383
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,720
um and it is important to talk about the

384
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:44,160
timing so if you do fertilize

385
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,399
now let's say we get in the mid mining

386
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:48,560
and fertilize and it's above 70 degrees

387
00:11:46,399 --> 00:11:49,440
it will volatilize out so you want to

388
00:11:48,560 --> 00:11:51,440
reduce

389
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,880
that impact of vocalization so try and

390
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:56,399
do it when it's cooler climates

391
00:11:52,880 --> 00:11:59,040
thanks next so let's talk about weeds

392
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,480
and and i it's rarely i get a chance to

393
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,600
go into a horse pasture where there's

394
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:04,320
not some

395
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,440
weeds in those pastures and so one of

396
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,440
the more common ones you'll see

397
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,120
throughout the dakotas in minnesota

398
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,480
is horse sweet and this is an annual

399
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:12,480
weed that we'll see

400
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:14,160
and annuals tend to be a problem when

401
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,839
you over graze your pastures

402
00:12:14,160 --> 00:12:19,040
next this is a common

403
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,279
i don't i didn't give you the flower

404
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,120
here but this is dandelion and we see

405
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,240
dandelion common in a lot of our horse

406
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,760
pastures

407
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,680
especially in the eastern half of the

408
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,440
dakotas in minnesota

409
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,760
on the average i don't worry about it

410
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,839
until it becomes a a visually

411
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,639
you know a quarter quarter of the stand

412
00:12:33,839 --> 00:12:35,680
and then i'm going to look at a

413
00:12:34,639 --> 00:12:39,040
herbicide treatment

414
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:41,519
to control the dandelions next

415
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,800
so this is a very young canada thistle

416
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
and i'll give the next picture too

417
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:45,440
rachel

418
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,639
um counter-thistle is common in a lot of

419
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,160
our horse pastures

420
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,480
another one you'll see is absent

421
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,760
wormwood whenever you see noxious weeds

422
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:53,279
like these coming in

423
00:12:51,760 --> 00:12:55,760
that tells me that the pasture's

424
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,519
probably been a history of over grazing

425
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,600
so that niche is now there in the soil

426
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
profile to capture those seeds and to

427
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,920
get some invasion

428
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,320
from these weeds next i'm going to talk

429
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:06,160
about

430
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,560
toxic weeds and i'm going to focus

431
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:11,920
primarily on the trees today

432
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:14,480
next and so

433
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:16,320
i did a story on toxic toxicity in

434
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:18,160
horses on tree and trees about

435
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,959
three months ago and probably the most

436
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:23,120
common one we see are the maple trees

437
00:13:20,959 --> 00:13:26,800
whether it's a box elder tree an actual

438
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:29,279
maple the leaves are toxic to horses

439
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,720
they have to consume a fair amount of it

440
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:32,399
to have issues

441
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,240
but it takes about three pounds of

442
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,639
ingestion per thousand pounds of weight

443
00:13:34,240 --> 00:13:38,880
can be deadly in horses so if you do

444
00:13:36,639 --> 00:13:40,880
have trees that border your fences

445
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,079
or border your pastures um it's

446
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:43,279
something you need to think about when

447
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:44,800
these trees start to when these leaves

448
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:46,079
start to fall off the leaves

449
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,079
or if you're getting too many in there

450
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:49,680
and other horses consuming it

451
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:51,360
on the average they will not eat many

452
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,920
leaves if there's plenty of grass

453
00:13:51,360 --> 00:13:54,720
in those pastures you tend to see severe

454
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,320
anemia

455
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:58,160
depression and increased breathing with

456
00:13:56,320 --> 00:13:59,600
maple toxicity

457
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,519
in my career i've seen two of this

458
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:02,000
happen where the horses actually died

459
00:14:01,519 --> 00:14:05,680
from

460
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,680
maple tree toxicity next slide

461
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,000
and so another one we'll see especially

462
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,279
if you have uh trees within your area

463
00:14:10,000 --> 00:14:14,160
like a tree grove

464
00:14:11,279 --> 00:14:15,440
is choked cherries um we all like to go

465
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,800
get choked cherries and mix some chopped

466
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,480
cherry jam

467
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:20,399
but tocate choke cherries can be very

468
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:21,920
toxic to horses in the class

469
00:14:20,399 --> 00:14:23,760
fact they're toxic to almost all classes

470
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:25,360
of livestock especially when the leaves

471
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:27,199
are stressed or wilted

472
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:28,480
the bark can be somewhat toxic but it's

473
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:30,000
primarily the leaves

474
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:31,519
and what you have here is cyanide

475
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:34,720
toxicity

476
00:14:31,519 --> 00:14:35,760
which is very deadly to any uh animal as

477
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,639
well as humans

478
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:39,440
next slide so this is a picture of the

479
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,639
flowers

480
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:44,399
of chokecherry next and then

481
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:46,560
some of the symptoms you'll look at uh

482
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:48,320
with death before death usually occurs

483
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:51,040
is flared nostrils so you'll see them

484
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:52,800
they'll be breathing hard um almost like

485
00:14:51,040 --> 00:14:54,959
if you're familiar with um

486
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,560
heaves and horses you'll see similar

487
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:59,600
that flaring of the nostrils

488
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,320
um with toxicity so they're labored in

489
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:01,920
breathing

490
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:03,839
lack of coordination and then trembling

491
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:04,480
and agitation so this is something to

492
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,240
look for

493
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,760
they need to get them off these if these

494
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:09,920
are problems

495
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,000
other toxic plants that we'll see that

496
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:13,839
are not palatable to horses

497
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,440
but you you'll hear incidents where

498
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:17,839
horses become

499
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:19,839
sick from these plants so horsetail uh

500
00:15:17,839 --> 00:15:22,959
rachel will show horsetail first

501
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,959
um and then we'll look at

502
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:26,160
probably one that gets the most talk

503
00:15:24,959 --> 00:15:31,360
about is locoweed

504
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:34,240
next well there's no pictures

505
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,680
so um local weed is one that uh get it

506
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:38,320
it's one of the

507
00:15:35,680 --> 00:15:40,320
broad leaves that horses tend to you

508
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:41,839
have individuals that will pick it out

509
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,759
and they call it local weed because it

510
00:15:41,839 --> 00:15:45,680
affects the nerve system

511
00:15:43,759 --> 00:15:47,279
that's a tie attached to their eyes and

512
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:48,800
so everything looks big to them so they

513
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:50,720
tend to tend to run around

514
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:52,000
and they'll go to locals that's a common

515
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:53,440
one we'll see

516
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:55,600
milkweeds are very common in the

517
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:57,120
northern plains and you'll see horses

518
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,759
pick on the leaves on this one

519
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,360
but normally they won't eat it if you're

520
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,680
in the western dakotas

521
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,920
even in minnesota we have oak trees both

522
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:08,240
the acorns and the leaves can be toxic

523
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,519
late in the season if the grass is not

524
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:10,240
short you typically will not have a

525
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:12,720
problem

526
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:13,759
and then poison hemlock and ragworts are

527
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:16,240
also can be common

528
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:16,880
very deadly but oftentimes rarely ever

529
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:19,920
consumed

530
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:20,880
next and so we also have nitrate

531
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:22,399
accumulators

532
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:24,160
and these are basically plants that have

533
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,680
nitrates in them that have horses

534
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:28,079
consume it

535
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:28,720
can have an effect on nitric toxicity

536
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:31,440
levels

537
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,320
horses tend to not die from nitrate

538
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:34,480
toxicity

539
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:35,440
but they'll run a very high fever and

540
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:37,040
then you've got to gotta

541
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:39,120
get hold of the vet and take care of

542
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
that situation before they do diet i've

543
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:42,240
i've seen metrotucks have seen horses a

544
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:44,560
couple times

545
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:46,639
they almost always run a high fever um

546
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,800
death can follow but it is pretty rare

547
00:16:46,639 --> 00:16:50,000
and so common plants uh that you'll see

548
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,639
is kosher

549
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:54,639
russian thistle in lamb's quarter these

550
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,600
are common in pastures that tend to be

551
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:57,040
overgrazed

552
00:16:55,600 --> 00:16:59,839
and you can see the story i'm coming

553
00:16:57,040 --> 00:17:02,079
with here keep your pastures healthy

554
00:16:59,839 --> 00:17:03,279
and usually annuals and toxic plants are

555
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:04,559
not an issue

556
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,799
if you start to get areas of over

557
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:09,839
grazing these annuals will come in

558
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:11,760
and then you have the issues next

559
00:17:09,839 --> 00:17:13,600
and so the last thing i want to talk

560
00:17:11,760 --> 00:17:15,360
about and obviously will be here for

561
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:17,439
questions but is you're looking to seed

562
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:18,959
a new pasture or let's say you have a

563
00:17:17,439 --> 00:17:20,400
pasture that's that's got some bare

564
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:21,439
ground in it and you want to overseed

565
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,039
that pasture

566
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,520
um there are some options you can look

567
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,959
at where do you get seed you know for me

568
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,120
in north dakota in particular i usually

569
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,320
call my local dealer i'll call into the

570
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:32,400
local town if i'm

571
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:34,000
living near new rockford i'll call my my

572
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,960
dealer in new rockford or i could call

573
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:36,559
anywhere you want

574
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:38,559
that sells seed and they'll find most of

575
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:39,520
these seeds for you there's also larger

576
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,000
seed companies

577
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,360
in the dakotas south dakota my example

578
00:17:42,000 --> 00:17:44,880
here is just again cc but

579
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:46,559
there's a number of companies that have

580
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:47,280
access to buy seeds let's go to the next

581
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:49,440
slide

582
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,200
and we'll talk about what i call are my

583
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,760
favorite mixes for horses

584
00:17:51,200 --> 00:17:55,600
um probably my my favorite grass

585
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,600
especially in north dakota

586
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:59,520
is is metal brome grass and especially

587
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,960
metal brome with a little bit of alfalfa

588
00:17:59,520 --> 00:18:02,720
on that stand which then keeps the

589
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,280
nitrogen flowing in that plant

590
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,960
is a very nice quality feed for horses

591
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:08,960
whether you graze it or hate it

592
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:10,160
as we get in the south part of the state

593
00:18:08,960 --> 00:18:12,320
into minnesota

594
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:13,760
you'll see orchard grass also commonly

595
00:18:12,320 --> 00:18:15,760
used um

596
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:17,200
i don't recommend orchard grass in most

597
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:17,760
of north dakota because it winter kills

598
00:18:17,200 --> 00:18:19,039
out

599
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:20,480
but if you're in south dakota or

600
00:18:19,039 --> 00:18:21,039
minnesota especially inside the other

601
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:22,880
half

602
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,640
orchard grass can replace metal broom

603
00:18:22,880 --> 00:18:26,640
the beauty of both those species

604
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,880
is they regrow really well so in a

605
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:30,799
grazing system where you rotate

606
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:32,880
you can get good grazing use get

607
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,160
regrowth and come back and graze that

608
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:35,679
plant

609
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,840
my second choice is the intermediate

610
00:18:35,679 --> 00:18:38,480
wheat grasses or pubescent wheat grass

611
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,559
mixes

612
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:41,520
they're not quite as palatable as the

613
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,520
metal brome

614
00:18:41,520 --> 00:18:45,200
but they do very well in our climate

615
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:47,120
even in their drier climates

616
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,400
um and they put up right when you get to

617
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:50,640
that boot stage

618
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,400
they also make really good hay the trick

619
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:52,960
is you got to get it up before you go to

620
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:54,880
seed

621
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,320
or the quota or the palatability really

622
00:18:54,880 --> 00:18:57,120
drops and that's true if you're grazing

623
00:18:56,320 --> 00:18:58,000
it as well

624
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:00,000
and the last one if you're in the

625
00:18:58,000 --> 00:19:02,480
western dakotas and into montana you

626
00:19:00,000 --> 00:19:04,880
know a crest your wheatgrass alfalfa mix

627
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:06,559
is a really good option for horses and i

628
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,640
do like alfalfa because

629
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:10,320
for the most part horses don't blow but

630
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:12,000
if you had about 10 to 20 percent of the

631
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,679
stand alfalfa

632
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,280
and like getting the other animals they

633
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:16,880
almost always pick the grass over the

634
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,160
alfalfa when they're grazing

635
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,760
it gives you a way to keep nitrogen

636
00:19:18,160 --> 00:19:20,559
flowing in that system and so it's a

637
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,600
nice mix

638
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:25,440
for horses next

639
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:27,280
and so the best time to see these these

640
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,679
mixes is is right now

641
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:31,440
if you need to do any kind of seating um

642
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:33,520
early april to late may

643
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:35,120
is that window of opportunity i like to

644
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:37,360
put my my seat in

645
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:38,240
by right about now or end of april early

646
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,080
may

647
00:19:38,240 --> 00:19:42,080
i know this year's been pretty dry so

648
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,000
timing will be more critical in hitting

649
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,600
the rains when you put it in

650
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:47,039
so you can time that with with the

651
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,039
future rain events

652
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:50,480
to do that the second best time period

653
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:51,360
is a dormant seating or we call it

654
00:19:50,480 --> 00:19:54,080
dormant seating

655
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,679
and that's mid-october to early november

656
00:19:54,080 --> 00:19:57,280
you basically want to seed it

657
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,120
but you don't want it to germinate in

658
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,640
the fall and you want to germinate the

659
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:01,760
following spring that's why it's called

660
00:20:00,640 --> 00:20:04,080
a dormant seeding

661
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:05,120
these are very successful and almost as

662
00:20:04,080 --> 00:20:07,200
good as the

663
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,480
as the spring seatings um it's just a

664
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:11,520
matter when you can get it in

665
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:13,280
next and so um

666
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,360
let's talk about this over seeding and

667
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:16,080
and we i even i've done this in my

668
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:18,799
pastures

669
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:20,080
as i've overseeded when i get my sta my

670
00:20:18,799 --> 00:20:22,480
pastures are about 25

671
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:23,600
years of age so i'm seeing some age

672
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:25,679
issue with my

673
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,200
grasses and so i'll actually go in there

674
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,120
on the bare spots

675
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:30,960
and and broadcast it in and then i'll

676
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,760
drag it in um if you get drilled

677
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:34,559
it's even better but it's an option you

678
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:36,640
can do to kind of

679
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:38,640
get more production out of it if over

680
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:40,559
grazing is your primary reason

681
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:41,919
you're going to have to still drop back

682
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:43,039
on that grazing pressure especially if

683
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:45,200
you want to seed it

684
00:20:43,039 --> 00:20:46,400
and get some growth before those before

685
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:49,120
you put the horses in

686
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,720
and we typically need about you know i

687
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:51,600
would say about four months of growth

688
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:53,840
for that graph

689
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:55,520
growth for that grass get enough root

690
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:56,799
structure so it can withstand the

691
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:58,799
grazing pressure

692
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,320
and depending on your pastures i like to

693
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:02,480
see that like species

694
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,720
so if you have a bromograss field seed

695
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:06,880
with brown if you have a crested field

696
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,480
seed with crested you don't want to see

697
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:09,760
the brome in the crested

698
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,679
because the horses are going to always

699
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,919
pick the brome and the crest it'll get

700
00:21:11,679 --> 00:21:14,799
wolfie on you so drill so seed what's in

701
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:16,640
that mix

702
00:21:14,799 --> 00:21:19,120
and the preferred technique is drilling

703
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:21,200
it in versus broadcasting if you do have

704
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:21,679
access to broadcast and you can drag it

705
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:23,200
in

706
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:24,960
that is another option especially when

707
00:21:23,200 --> 00:21:28,720
it comes to overseeding

708
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:29,600
next slide um that's the end of my talk

709
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,960
and so i think i think we're going to

710
00:21:29,600 --> 00:21:32,960
turn it over to i believe it's

711
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,000
not sure it's rachel or page but i'll be

712
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:35,520
on for the rest of the

713
00:21:34,000 --> 00:21:37,600
of the session and we take any questions

714
00:21:35,520 --> 00:21:39,679
at the end thanks kevin

715
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:40,799
uh a lot of what kevin talked about

716
00:21:39,679 --> 00:21:43,039
actually

717
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:44,720
coincides with the grading strategies

718
00:21:43,039 --> 00:21:46,799
and grazing ideas

719
00:21:44,720 --> 00:21:47,840
um so with the season that we have this

720
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:51,600
year we're actually

721
00:21:47,840 --> 00:21:53,440
not um you know we're looking more into

722
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:55,440
the the limiting term out time or

723
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:57,120
rotational grazing instead of continuous

724
00:21:55,440 --> 00:21:58,159
grazing because of the fact that we're

725
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,440
so short on moisture

726
00:21:58,159 --> 00:22:03,520
that that the the ability of those

727
00:22:01,440 --> 00:22:05,919
blocks or those pastures to come back

728
00:22:03,520 --> 00:22:07,360
after after some pretty hard continuous

729
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:08,799
grazing is going to be a lot harder

730
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,520
because we don't have

731
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,000
the moisture to bring back those grasses

732
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:15,120
um

733
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:16,480
we also noticed just a slight discussion

734
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:18,320
on this because we're going to talk

735
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,240
about drought next week but we did also

736
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,360
notice that there are some delay

737
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,960
in these grasses as well um so we

738
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,960
really want to watch that before we turn

739
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:29,280
on to pasture and again we'll

740
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:30,320
we'll talk more on that next week but

741
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:33,520
this is a good

742
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,280
um picture to show so that you

743
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,799
you know you have a sacrifice area with

744
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,080
water or shelter

745
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:42,240
a place that you can feed um your grains

746
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:45,280
or supplements or dry hay

747
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:46,960
and then hopefully be able to rotate

748
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:47,919
them through the pastures so that you

749
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:50,000
can't

750
00:22:47,919 --> 00:22:51,679
you're able to keep pressure off of one

751
00:22:50,000 --> 00:22:53,520
area more than the other

752
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:55,280
um so this is just kind of a good idea

753
00:22:53,520 --> 00:22:56,880
for grazing strategy so again that

754
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:58,880
rotational grazing meaning

755
00:22:56,880 --> 00:23:01,039
um that you'll go from pasture one to

756
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:02,640
pasture two to pasture three to pasture

757
00:23:01,039 --> 00:23:05,120
four throughout the season

758
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,080
or limiting turnout time um to your

759
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:08,159
critters maybe

760
00:23:06,080 --> 00:23:10,159
uh keeping them in at night after

761
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:13,280
they've they've had

762
00:23:10,159 --> 00:23:15,280
a little bit of supplemental grain or or

763
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,480
possibly a little bit extra hay

764
00:23:15,280 --> 00:23:23,840
to make sure that they're not putting

765
00:23:16,480 --> 00:23:23,840
too much pressure on that pasture

766
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:30,159
so with the rotational grazing uh you

767
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:31,919
want to take into

768
00:23:30,159 --> 00:23:33,600
thought the number of paddocks that you

769
00:23:31,919 --> 00:23:36,640
have available to you

770
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,159
um and how many days with

771
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:39,760
how many horses you're going to be

772
00:23:38,159 --> 00:23:40,720
putting in there so those are some

773
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,640
things i

774
00:23:40,720 --> 00:23:45,120
we really want you to look at especially

775
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,159
with on the situation that we're in this

776
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,679
year

777
00:23:46,159 --> 00:23:49,679
grass is going to be a hot commodity

778
00:23:47,679 --> 00:23:50,000
this year so if you're able or you have

779
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:52,559
any

780
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:54,000
or you're able to graze um this is one

781
00:23:52,559 --> 00:23:55,760
thing to really watch to make sure that

782
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,159
you do not over graze those

783
00:23:55,760 --> 00:24:00,799
those paddocks or or different locks

784
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:02,559
that you have set up for your horses

785
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:04,640
this is just kind of a rule of thumb so

786
00:24:02,559 --> 00:24:07,840
if you have two paddocks

787
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:11,039
um in the spring you turn out to

788
00:24:07,840 --> 00:24:13,679
one that's that's appropriately um

789
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:15,200
the appropriate height for grazing then

790
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,240
you're looking at maybe

791
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,159
14 days of grazing with 14 days of rest

792
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,440
so and then it changes throughout the

793
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,799
summer because

794
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
in the spring you're going to have your

795
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:26,080
cool season grasses that are that are

796
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:28,159
coming up and that's what

797
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
your horses are going to graze on in the

798
00:24:28,159 --> 00:24:32,240
summer you're getting your warm seasons

799
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:34,400
or your later spring a year later cool

800
00:24:32,240 --> 00:24:35,840
into your warm season grasses and then

801
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:36,559
in the fall it is your warm season

802
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,559
grasses

803
00:24:36,559 --> 00:24:40,960
too so making sure that these are able

804
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:42,640
to come back for fall grazing or

805
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,480
you know keeping that pasture available

806
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:45,760
so that fall grazing is a possibility

807
00:24:44,480 --> 00:24:47,919
for you

808
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:49,440
so it all just depends on how many how

809
00:24:47,919 --> 00:24:50,960
many pastures you have available

810
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,960
how many horses are going to be going

811
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,840
into that so this is all

812
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:59,039
part of what what you'll need to watch

813
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:00,799
for rotational grazing this summer

814
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,880
i'm gonna just lightly touch on some of

815
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,679
the weed management for pastures

816
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,320
uh kevin did talk about you know how a

817
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:08,080
lot of

818
00:25:06,320 --> 00:25:10,000
a lot of pastures that are overgrazed

819
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:12,159
you're gonna see more weeds in them

820
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:14,400
and this is this is something that that

821
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,440
is really needs to be watched as well as

822
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:19,039
is weed management is basically whole

823
00:25:17,440 --> 00:25:22,559
pasture management

824
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:24,159
um so starting with whole pasture

825
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:26,799
management is going to help with

826
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:27,200
any weeds that you get um and then

827
00:25:26,799 --> 00:25:29,120
there's

828
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,720
there's several ways to control them the

829
00:25:29,120 --> 00:25:31,200
three main ways that we're going to talk

830
00:25:30,720 --> 00:25:34,640
about is

831
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:38,799
is cultural chemical or mechanical

832
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:42,080
um so there's not not a ton of

833
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:45,039
cultural methods but um chemical or

834
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,080
spraying is is one of them and then

835
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,440
mechanical

836
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,520
um is the other so mowing them down

837
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:52,799
instead of spraying them could be an

838
00:25:51,520 --> 00:25:54,559
option for you especially if you have

839
00:25:52,799 --> 00:25:57,440
smaller pastures or

840
00:25:54,559 --> 00:25:57,760
maybe don't want to spray because you're

841
00:25:57,440 --> 00:25:59,760
not

842
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,200
able to if they're the horses are in

843
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:03,279
there we don't recommend spraying while

844
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,440
any animals are in there

845
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,679
and then also following the label on any

846
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:09,200
chemical that you utilize

847
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,520
on the first thing you want to do to

848
00:26:09,200 --> 00:26:14,080
make sure that you get uh proper control

849
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:16,159
of any weeds is to id those weeds so

850
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,760
knowing what you're you're up against

851
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:20,320
knowing what you're handling

852
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:22,159
is going to help and it go a long way

853
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:24,000
when you're talking about possibly

854
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:25,440
either chemical control or mechanical

855
00:26:24,000 --> 00:26:27,039
control because

856
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,600
then you know you know when the best

857
00:26:27,039 --> 00:26:32,080
time to mow is when the seed head comes

858
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,039
um when the best time to spray is and

859
00:26:32,080 --> 00:26:34,559
when you're going to get the best

860
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,159
control for it

861
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:38,320
so those are the things that we really

862
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,520
want um

863
00:26:38,320 --> 00:26:43,120
want to look at because when you have

864
00:26:41,520 --> 00:26:45,840
kind of an overall control

865
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:45,840
or overall

866
00:26:46,559 --> 00:26:51,360
management of your pasture your grass is

867
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:52,000
going to grow well enough to out-compete

868
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:53,600
those weeds

869
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,200
so making sure that you're taking care

870
00:26:53,600 --> 00:26:57,520
of the weeds that you have

871
00:26:55,200 --> 00:26:58,880
so that your grass can you know help you

872
00:26:57,520 --> 00:26:59,520
with the control of those weeds in the

873
00:26:58,880 --> 00:27:01,760
future

874
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:05,440
so making sure you know weed management

875
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,440
starts with pasture management

876
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,520
and then kevin also talked about uh

877
00:27:08,799 --> 00:27:12,640
fertilizing your pastures we did want to

878
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:14,000
mention a little bit there is a

879
00:27:12,640 --> 00:27:15,919
possibility of

880
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:17,200
you know you can do some soil testing on

881
00:27:15,919 --> 00:27:19,360
that posture to see

882
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:20,559
how much nitrogen you may want to put

883
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:22,480
down um

884
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:23,760
and then he also mentioned you know you

885
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,440
don't usually

886
00:27:23,760 --> 00:27:27,279
want to put down any phosphorus for

887
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:28,559
potassium but when you're doing soil

888
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:31,440
testing

889
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:32,799
we then can see how much is there which

890
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,799
is good like he said for

891
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:36,080
the nutrients in the plant or the the

892
00:27:34,799 --> 00:27:39,360
minerals in the plant

893
00:27:36,080 --> 00:27:41,120
so that's good to know as well um ph

894
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:42,640
and organic matter is also good to know

895
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,960
especially if you're needing to over

896
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:46,720
seed on anything you're able to know

897
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:48,080
kind of what seeds would be able to be

898
00:27:46,720 --> 00:27:50,480
put down

899
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:51,200
with the ph levels that you have there

900
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,440
usually

901
00:27:51,200 --> 00:27:54,960
when you soil test you go to a depth of

902
00:27:53,440 --> 00:27:56,960
six inches

903
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,320
um and you don't want to just test in

904
00:27:56,960 --> 00:28:00,480
one spot you wanna

905
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,640
you wanna test the whole field and you

906
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:03,440
can collect samples kind of in a zigzag

907
00:28:02,640 --> 00:28:06,720
pattern

908
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:08,240
using a spade um and adding you know six

909
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:10,880
inches of dirt into the buck

910
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:12,480
into a bucket mixing it all up and then

911
00:28:10,880 --> 00:28:15,360
putting it into a bag

912
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:18,080
um like there is on the right hand side

913
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:21,039
i do have one right here too

914
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:22,320
um and we do send that off to the ndsu

915
00:28:21,039 --> 00:28:24,240
soils lab

916
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:25,679
so that's that's normally what you get

917
00:28:24,240 --> 00:28:27,919
back is the nitrogen phosphorus

918
00:28:25,679 --> 00:28:31,360
potassium ph and organic matter

919
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:32,880
um usually you can can do soil testing

920
00:28:31,360 --> 00:28:35,760
about every three years

921
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,559
so it's not an every year sort of thing

922
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:38,240
um and

923
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,399
kevin had mentioned too you know you're

924
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:41,760
not gonna fertilize every year

925
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:43,279
once you get into it it's gonna be

926
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:44,080
either every other year or every two

927
00:28:43,279 --> 00:28:47,600
years

928
00:28:44,080 --> 00:28:48,960
or every every third year sorry um so

929
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:50,080
you just want to make sure that that's

930
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,919
kind of

931
00:28:50,080 --> 00:28:53,440
kind of how you're going if you do have

932
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:55,760
um different

933
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,200
areas of a pasture so a high area and

934
00:28:55,760 --> 00:29:00,159
maybe a low area

935
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:02,159
i would suggest soil sampling those

936
00:29:00,159 --> 00:29:02,880
separately so your low area and your

937
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:04,720
high area

938
00:29:02,880 --> 00:29:06,080
would be two different samples so you'd

939
00:29:04,720 --> 00:29:08,640
end up putting in

940
00:29:06,080 --> 00:29:10,320
um two different areas so that you know

941
00:29:08,640 --> 00:29:13,200
you know kind of what's going into both

942
00:29:10,320 --> 00:29:15,039
of those

943
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:17,679
and next i'm going to actually turn it

944
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:17,679
over to paige

945
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:21,360
all right so let's talk about when to

946
00:29:19,440 --> 00:29:23,039
initiate and cease grazing

947
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:24,480
a lot of people decide when to turn out

948
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:26,320
just based on the calendar

949
00:29:24,480 --> 00:29:27,840
and that's not the best method as it's

950
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:29,679
going to vary year to year

951
00:29:27,840 --> 00:29:31,120
depending upon the weather conditions

952
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:31,600
and then also what part of the state

953
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:32,880
you're at

954
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:35,600
and what species you have in your

955
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:36,320
pasture one of the recommended ways to

956
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:38,640
determine

957
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,720
when to start grazing is by leaf growth

958
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:42,240
stage it's the most accurate for most of

959
00:29:40,720 --> 00:29:44,320
our species

960
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:45,600
and and the majority of them you know as

961
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:47,360
a general rule of thumb we're going to

962
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:49,120
say three to three and a half lease

963
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:51,840
stages when you want to start

964
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,799
so this picture on the left we have one

965
00:29:51,840 --> 00:29:54,880
full leaf two

966
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:56,720
full leaf three full leaves so this

967
00:29:54,880 --> 00:29:57,679
picture on the left is a three leaf

968
00:29:56,720 --> 00:29:59,600
stage

969
00:29:57,679 --> 00:30:01,600
the one on the right is at three and a

970
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:02,480
half leaves three full leaves and then

971
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:06,159
this

972
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,159
fourth one is just about halfway out so

973
00:30:06,159 --> 00:30:10,159
that would be the recommendation that

974
00:30:08,159 --> 00:30:12,159
you can use in your own pastures

975
00:30:10,159 --> 00:30:13,919
some people really like to go by height

976
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,919
of the pasture as well and that doesn't

977
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,520
consider species differences

978
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:19,520
so there are some recommendations that

979
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:21,279
you'll find out there from different

980
00:30:19,520 --> 00:30:22,880
universities and grazing management

981
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:24,480
publications that'll say

982
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,720
you know start when grazing when the

983
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:28,720
grass is six to eight inches tall

984
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,159
if you're in an area where you have a

985
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,159
majority of grass species in your

986
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:34,159
pasture that don't ever get that tall

987
00:30:32,159 --> 00:30:35,760
even in a high moisture year that's not

988
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,279
going to work for you

989
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,200
so you really kind of need to know what

990
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:40,960
what species you're dealing with

991
00:30:39,200 --> 00:30:42,559
but if you're going by the the height

992
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,559
method and that's a lot of our cool

993
00:30:42,559 --> 00:30:46,399
season grasses that follow

994
00:30:44,559 --> 00:30:48,320
those recommendations in some

995
00:30:46,399 --> 00:30:49,840
publications you'll want to stop when

996
00:30:48,320 --> 00:30:51,279
the majority of your grasses are about

997
00:30:49,840 --> 00:30:53,440
four inches tall

998
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,480
that's also an issue too when we hear

999
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:56,559
people say

1000
00:30:54,480 --> 00:30:58,640
take half and leave half and that is a

1001
00:30:56,559 --> 00:31:00,799
good recommendation but we want to think

1002
00:30:58,640 --> 00:31:02,320
of that by the volume of the plant or

1003
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:04,559
the weight of the plant

1004
00:31:02,320 --> 00:31:05,919
and not just the height because again

1005
00:31:04,559 --> 00:31:08,240
some of our grass species

1006
00:31:05,919 --> 00:31:10,640
don't get very tall but they may have a

1007
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,480
lot of leaves at the base of the plant

1008
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:14,640
so the idea is is that you're taking

1009
00:31:12,480 --> 00:31:16,640
half of the plant and leaving half

1010
00:31:14,640 --> 00:31:19,279
we do have more information on that in

1011
00:31:16,640 --> 00:31:21,679
another publication

1012
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:22,880
um so the detriments of grazing too

1013
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:25,120
early is that you're gonna

1014
00:31:22,880 --> 00:31:27,200
reduce plant bigger it reduces the

1015
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:27,679
amount of plant leaf surface or leaf

1016
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,600
tissue

1017
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:31,360
area that's needed for photosynthesis

1018
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,240
and growth so you're gonna end up with

1019
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,480
weaker plants

1020
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,919
thinner stands lower total forage

1021
00:31:34,480 --> 00:31:38,240
production and increased

1022
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,760
risk of those disease pressures or weed

1023
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,000
pressure along with disease and

1024
00:31:39,760 --> 00:31:43,760
and potentially some insects so that all

1025
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:46,000
comes back to what rachel's talking

1026
00:31:43,760 --> 00:31:48,559
about for grazing management

1027
00:31:46,000 --> 00:31:50,640
grazing too early and overgrazing a

1028
00:31:48,559 --> 00:31:52,399
result in these issues

1029
00:31:50,640 --> 00:31:53,679
and it can take several years to regain

1030
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:55,600
productivity

1031
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:57,279
on the flip side of this you can also

1032
00:31:55,600 --> 00:31:58,720
graze too late kevin mentioned

1033
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:00,640
especially on plants that are

1034
00:31:58,720 --> 00:32:03,039
unpalatable once they head out and reach

1035
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:05,519
maturity like crested wheatgrass

1036
00:32:03,039 --> 00:32:06,960
if you wait until the plant is headed

1037
00:32:05,519 --> 00:32:08,000
out the horses aren't going to eat them

1038
00:32:06,960 --> 00:32:15,279
and they're going to end up

1039
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:17,360
wasting that grass

1040
00:32:15,279 --> 00:32:18,880
so here's a visual for over grazing when

1041
00:32:17,360 --> 00:32:21,120
we say take half and leave

1042
00:32:18,880 --> 00:32:22,720
half let's look at what that could mean

1043
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:25,679
so if we remove

1044
00:32:22,720 --> 00:32:26,960
50 percent of the volume of the leaf the

1045
00:32:25,679 --> 00:32:28,960
percent of growth

1046
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:30,640
growth stoppage is two to four percent

1047
00:32:28,960 --> 00:32:33,279
so just a small amount

1048
00:32:30,640 --> 00:32:34,000
but as we increase removing seventy

1049
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,720
percent

1050
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:38,799
of the volume of the leaves you re you

1051
00:32:36,720 --> 00:32:41,840
stop or reduce that root growth by

1052
00:32:38,799 --> 00:32:45,440
almost eighty percent if we remove

1053
00:32:41,840 --> 00:32:48,559
eighty percent of the leaf volume

1054
00:32:45,440 --> 00:32:50,640
you completely stop root growth

1055
00:32:48,559 --> 00:32:52,080
okay so that's some of the underground

1056
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:52,799
things so sometimes we just look at

1057
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,559
what's growing

1058
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:56,399
above ground and what's happening with

1059
00:32:54,559 --> 00:32:58,000
the forage production that way

1060
00:32:56,399 --> 00:32:59,679
we have to keep in mind that the root

1061
00:32:58,000 --> 00:33:02,320
growth is also very important for your

1062
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:02,320
plant figure

1063
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:08,559
next thing we're going to talk about is

1064
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:11,120
transitioning your horses to spring

1065
00:33:08,559 --> 00:33:14,000
grasses we have an issue

1066
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:15,679
with some horses and sometimes we forget

1067
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:16,240
that this can be an issue when they go

1068
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:18,799
from

1069
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,679
eating a dry forage that is maybe a

1070
00:33:18,799 --> 00:33:22,399
little bit

1071
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:24,000
lower in non-structural carburete

1072
00:33:22,399 --> 00:33:26,480
carbohydrate production

1073
00:33:24,000 --> 00:33:27,120
and we suddenly turn them out onto a

1074
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:29,120
lush

1075
00:33:27,120 --> 00:33:30,240
green grass pasture like we have in the

1076
00:33:29,120 --> 00:33:33,200
picture here

1077
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:34,880
that sudden change can cause pine gut

1078
00:33:33,200 --> 00:33:36,880
disruption meaning that

1079
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,399
normally the nutrients that are absorbed

1080
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:40,559
in the small intestine

1081
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:42,080
get bypassed into the cecum and can

1082
00:33:40,559 --> 00:33:44,399
cause some issues

1083
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:46,399
in horses primarily they'll start with

1084
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:48,240
symptoms that are similar to colic maybe

1085
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:51,120
some diarrhea and gas

1086
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:52,640
and if we don't manage that or back them

1087
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:55,679
off of this

1088
00:33:52,640 --> 00:33:58,080
new change in diet and higher levels of

1089
00:33:55,679 --> 00:33:59,760
our non-structural carbohydrates it can

1090
00:33:58,080 --> 00:34:02,399
continue to cause issues

1091
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:03,279
drop the ph and result in some laminitis

1092
00:34:02,399 --> 00:34:05,440
problems

1093
00:34:03,279 --> 00:34:07,679
so the key thing to remember here is to

1094
00:34:05,440 --> 00:34:10,639
adapt your horses to spring grass

1095
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,679
slowly so say right now if they're on a

1096
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:13,359
full hay diet

1097
00:34:11,679 --> 00:34:15,520
in a dry lot while you're letting your

1098
00:34:13,359 --> 00:34:17,599
pastures grow and reach the appropriate

1099
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:19,760
stage before you turn them out

1100
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,040
when the grass is ready to graze start

1101
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:23,679
by letting them graze that

1102
00:34:21,040 --> 00:34:25,440
15 to 30 minutes a day at a time and

1103
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:27,359
increase that each day

1104
00:34:25,440 --> 00:34:29,040
until they're grazing and out on grass

1105
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:30,879
for more than four hours a day

1106
00:34:29,040 --> 00:34:33,280
at that time you're usually safe to

1107
00:34:30,879 --> 00:34:35,359
consider or safe to let them

1108
00:34:33,280 --> 00:34:36,879
graze the entire time or stay out on

1109
00:34:35,359 --> 00:34:39,919
pasture the entire time

1110
00:34:36,879 --> 00:34:42,079
that allows the microbes to adapt

1111
00:34:39,919 --> 00:34:43,599
you want to monitor your horses closely

1112
00:34:42,079 --> 00:34:44,480
if they have any of the symptoms that we

1113
00:34:43,599 --> 00:34:47,119
talked about

1114
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,720
and remove them from grass and certainly

1115
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:51,679
consult with your veterinarian if the

1116
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:51,679
symptoms are severe

1117
00:34:54,800 --> 00:34:58,640
here's a couple methods for managing

1118
00:34:56,960 --> 00:35:00,640
higher risk horses so our

1119
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,400
are insulin resistant horses horses that

1120
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,400
have been diagnosed with cushing's or

1121
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:05,599
horses that are obese you can use

1122
00:35:04,400 --> 00:35:08,240
grazing muzzles

1123
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:09,760
try to avoid grazing in sunny afternoons

1124
00:35:08,240 --> 00:35:11,599
you can consider turning them

1125
00:35:09,760 --> 00:35:12,880
out just overnight after they've been

1126
00:35:11,599 --> 00:35:16,160
adapted to that spring

1127
00:35:12,880 --> 00:35:18,320
grass even at the lowest non-structural

1128
00:35:16,160 --> 00:35:19,040
carbohydrate levels in the early morning

1129
00:35:18,320 --> 00:35:21,280
hours

1130
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,520
can still exceed the recommended intake

1131
00:35:21,280 --> 00:35:24,880
for some of these at-risk courses

1132
00:35:23,520 --> 00:35:26,640
so again you want to work with your

1133
00:35:24,880 --> 00:35:29,200
veterinarian to come up with a

1134
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:30,000
good strategy and realize that all

1135
00:35:29,200 --> 00:35:32,320
horses are at

1136
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:34,320
risk but some of our horses are even

1137
00:35:32,320 --> 00:35:36,400
more at risk

1138
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:37,920
so that's all i have for you today i'm

1139
00:35:36,400 --> 00:35:40,000
going to go ahead and turn the floor

1140
00:35:37,920 --> 00:35:43,440
back over to mary and she's going to

1141
00:35:40,000 --> 00:35:43,440
finish out the webinar

1142
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:50,000
okay so um are there questions this is

1143
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:53,359
the time when you guys can unmute

1144
00:35:50,000 --> 00:35:55,200
and um ask questions and we can actually

1145
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:57,119
rachel if you want to send it back to

1146
00:35:55,200 --> 00:35:59,680
just the gallery view

1147
00:35:57,119 --> 00:36:01,040
then people can go ahead and unmute and

1148
00:35:59,680 --> 00:36:03,119
ask some questions we did have some

1149
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:05,280
stuff rolling through the chat

1150
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:07,119
so while you're thinking your question

1151
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:10,160
um veronica had

1152
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:11,119
asked about horses being treated after

1153
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:14,000
eating

1154
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:16,400
red maple tree or other toxic plants and

1155
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:19,040
kevin just went ahead and answered that

1156
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:19,839
if if that is a potential to call your

1157
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,760
vet

1158
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:24,800
they can possibly treat with activated

1159
00:36:21,760 --> 00:36:27,040
charcoal or mineral via stomach tube

1160
00:36:24,800 --> 00:36:30,240
and so calling the vet in a case of

1161
00:36:27,040 --> 00:36:33,680
emergency is always good

1162
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:33,680
other thoughts or questions

1163
00:36:33,839 --> 00:36:37,280
okay mindy says can we fertilize with

1164
00:36:36,320 --> 00:36:40,800
manure

1165
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:43,440
that is one or two years old

1166
00:36:40,800 --> 00:36:44,160
um if so when's the best time to do that

1167
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,079
so i

1168
00:36:44,160 --> 00:36:48,480
am going to see what kevin has to say

1169
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:50,800
about this just from a grass standpoint

1170
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:51,839
um even though i'm the manure person so

1171
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:53,839
i'm gonna let kevin

1172
00:36:51,839 --> 00:36:54,960
um take a shot at this and then i will

1173
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,200
follow up

1174
00:36:54,960 --> 00:36:59,680
well i'll say you know spreading manure

1175
00:36:57,200 --> 00:37:02,800
on tam grass pastures

1176
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:04,640
is a is a technique to add fertility

1177
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:06,079
and and mary will tell the details on

1178
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:06,800
this but it does add nitrogen into the

1179
00:37:06,079 --> 00:37:09,119
profile

1180
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:10,480
as well as p and k and so it is one of

1181
00:37:09,119 --> 00:37:13,119
those that you can use and you can

1182
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:14,800
you can really spread fertilizer any any

1183
00:37:13,119 --> 00:37:15,599
time but the best time and i'll let mary

1184
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:17,440
cover that

1185
00:37:15,599 --> 00:37:21,200
is you do get a benefit from that manure

1186
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,400
now mary can tell you when and how much

1187
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,119
so um yeah we we like to

1188
00:37:24,400 --> 00:37:27,760
uh soil sample um to tell us the how

1189
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:30,079
much

1190
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:32,000
and the when i i would just say so kevin

1191
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:33,040
had talked about you know using urea or

1192
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:35,920
using a

1193
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,280
nitrogen um that's gonna be really

1194
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,560
readily available

1195
00:37:37,280 --> 00:37:42,560
um ner is less readily available it

1196
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:43,440
takes a little more time especially a

1197
00:37:42,560 --> 00:37:46,560
horsepower

1198
00:37:43,440 --> 00:37:49,680
horsepower is very neutral in how

1199
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:51,920
the the nutrients um are mineralized

1200
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:52,720
so it's not so there's like a liquid

1201
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,440
manure

1202
00:37:52,720 --> 00:37:56,079
would have more of the properties of uh

1203
00:37:55,440 --> 00:37:59,119
right now

1204
00:37:56,079 --> 00:38:00,480
nitrogen whereas horsemanner um it just

1205
00:37:59,119 --> 00:38:02,720
takes a little more time

1206
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:04,720
and so that is i i wouldn't recommend it

1207
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:06,000
if you're going to say we want to spread

1208
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:08,880
it right now and have

1209
00:38:06,000 --> 00:38:10,400
beautiful green pastures um probably

1210
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:11,119
going to go with kevin's recommendations

1211
00:38:10,400 --> 00:38:12,880
from earlier

1212
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,560
but if you're thinking i have all this

1213
00:38:12,880 --> 00:38:16,160
manure and i want to spread it i

1214
00:38:14,560 --> 00:38:16,560
composted it on spread i want to spread

1215
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:19,280
it raw

1216
00:38:16,560 --> 00:38:20,960
absolutely spread it it is for fertility

1217
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:21,920
just um keeping in mind when you're

1218
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:24,000
going to do that

1219
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,440
and so probably i would recommend doing

1220
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:27,520
it in the fall so it has time to

1221
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,480
mineralize and then by spring

1222
00:38:27,520 --> 00:38:31,839
we should see some benefits from that so

1223
00:38:30,480 --> 00:38:33,040
a great question up there and i don't

1224
00:38:31,839 --> 00:38:35,599
know the answer to this but maybe

1225
00:38:33,040 --> 00:38:37,359
page does obviously horse manure can

1226
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:39,200
carry parasites

1227
00:38:37,359 --> 00:38:42,240
um is there a time period when that when

1228
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:46,000
you get less live parasites in terms of

1229
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:47,920
age of manure well this one back at mary

1230
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,680
too and making sure that if you're

1231
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,800
applying manure that it's correctly

1232
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,000
composted

1233
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,599
and heated to the appropriate levels to

1234
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:58,000
interrupt the life cycle of those

1235
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:59,760
parasites

1236
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:01,200
what was the follow-up question i'm

1237
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:03,599
sorry

1238
00:39:01,200 --> 00:39:04,400
i don't know if you had any specifics on

1239
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:06,400
um

1240
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:07,839
you know what temperature the pile needs

1241
00:39:06,400 --> 00:39:09,040
to reach in order to make sure that

1242
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:11,760
we're killing those

1243
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:12,640
parasites through all of its life stages

1244
00:39:11,760 --> 00:39:15,680
okay

1245
00:39:12,640 --> 00:39:18,160
yep so we want it between 130 and 150 um

1246
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:19,200
is a really good uh good place to have

1247
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:20,880
that so

1248
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,400
we're gonna be killing weed seeds

1249
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,680
pathogens um

1250
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:25,680
all of that stuff between those

1251
00:39:23,680 --> 00:39:27,119
temperatures we're still having some

1252
00:39:25,680 --> 00:39:30,480
composting action happen

1253
00:39:27,119 --> 00:39:31,839
under that 1 30 um i mean if you stick

1254
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:33,520
your hand in there you're like wow this

1255
00:39:31,839 --> 00:39:35,440
is pretty warm so there is some action

1256
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,839
happening but if you want that actual

1257
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:39,599
pathogen and weed seed kill we're going

1258
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:42,640
to want to make sure that we

1259
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:43,440
um are under the are between the 130 and

1260
00:39:42,640 --> 00:39:45,040
150.

1261
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:47,040
we don't necessarily want to go over

1262
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:47,599
that either uh because that's where we

1263
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,359
then

1264
00:39:47,599 --> 00:39:51,599
kind of kill everything we just killed

1265
00:39:49,359 --> 00:39:53,440
the entire process uh and so that's more

1266
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:56,000
of what happens in stockpiling we have

1267
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:59,200
one really great heat cycle

1268
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:02,960
and then it stops so that is

1269
00:39:59,200 --> 00:40:04,880
what i say there and

1270
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:07,040
it looks like brooks has a question are

1271
00:40:04,880 --> 00:40:07,760
there any forages that are better for a

1272
00:40:07,040 --> 00:40:11,839
horse

1273
00:40:07,760 --> 00:40:11,839
um that have foundered

1274
00:40:14,000 --> 00:40:18,319
from a grass standpoint i think this is

1275
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:21,599
hard uh hard to manage

1276
00:40:18,319 --> 00:40:23,520
um because the nutritional values of

1277
00:40:21,599 --> 00:40:24,079
grasses change so quickly throughout the

1278
00:40:23,520 --> 00:40:27,599
grazing

1279
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:28,000
season that i believe the recommendation

1280
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,079
for

1281
00:40:28,000 --> 00:40:31,839
horses that have foundered or at high

1282
00:40:30,079 --> 00:40:33,680
risk for foundering again is to manage

1283
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:37,119
their diet a little bit more closely

1284
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:40,160
with forages that have been tested um

1285
00:40:37,119 --> 00:40:42,240
so you know i would definitely work with

1286
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:44,640
the vet because it's going to depend on

1287
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:46,319
the risk level of that particular horse

1288
00:40:44,640 --> 00:40:48,640
you do see some horses that have just a

1289
00:40:46,319 --> 00:40:50,079
mild wrist uh foundering or mild

1290
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:51,839
laminated case

1291
00:40:50,079 --> 00:40:54,240
that you know they can graze for a short

1292
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,359
period of time with a grazing muzzle

1293
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,520
and um they're fulfilling their

1294
00:40:55,359 --> 00:41:00,800
nutritional needs with a balanced

1295
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:01,839
dry forage on the other hours of the day

1296
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:04,480
so it's going to really be an

1297
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,960
individualized case

1298
00:41:04,480 --> 00:41:08,640
and if anybody's wondering why rachel uh

1299
00:41:06,960 --> 00:41:10,240
is sharing this again i just asked her

1300
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:11,920
to this is a new

1301
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:13,920
uh reporting that we have to do and so

1302
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:15,359
if you want to scan that qr code or i

1303
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:17,359
put the link in the chat if you want to

1304
00:41:15,359 --> 00:41:20,240

management which is a

1327
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:04,960
very pertinent and timely topic for the

1328
00:42:01,920 --> 00:42:06,880
entire state of north dakota this year

1329
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:08,240

1330
00:42:06,880 --> 00:42:10,400
about um

1331
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:12,160
feeding during the drought and grazing

1332
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:14,160
during the drought

1333
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:16,319
a little bit of dry lotting and winter

1334
00:42:14,160 --> 00:42:18,319
