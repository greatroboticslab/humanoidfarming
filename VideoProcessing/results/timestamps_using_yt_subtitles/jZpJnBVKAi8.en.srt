00:00:07,570 --> 00:00:12,240
our buildings consume about 40% of our

00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,679
energy

3
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,360
and with our emissions threatening to

4
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:19,720
permanently change our climate

5
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:23,169
we need more efficient better greener

6
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,720
cities we can start by being smart with

7
00:00:23,169 --> 00:00:28,679
what we have passive solar buildings

00:00:25,720 --> 00:00:34,360

identity living and Tillie working but

10
00:00:34,360 --> 00:00:37,930
our food production is still a long way

11
00:00:35,890 --> 00:00:40,390
from most of the people who live in the

12
00:00:37,930 --> 00:00:42,940
cities built on the best arable land

13
00:00:40,390 --> 00:00:45,760
vertical farming could turn this on its

14
00:00:42,940 --> 00:00:47,920
head or at least its side it would bring

15
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,079
together a host of emerging technologies

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,539
by putting food production on the

17
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:55,300
building's we live and work in to reduce

18
00:00:52,539 --> 00:00:58,859
land use pull our urban heat sinks and

19
00:00:55,300 --> 00:01:02,140
drastically reduce food transport costs

20
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:04,210
modern agriculture uses 70% of the

21
00:01:02,140 --> 00:01:06,580
world's available fresh water but

22
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:09,670
vertical farms could be fitted with nano

23
00:01:06,580 --> 00:01:12,009
films and boost condensation and Nano

24
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:15,759
membranes would filter and clean

00:01:12,009 --> 00:01:19,149
recycled water better water quality less

26
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,280
waste crop effectiveness will be boosted

27
00:01:19,149 --> 00:01:22,720
by genetic engineering to select the

28
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:25,720
best genetic variants for the

29
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,739
environment fiber optics might provide

30
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,259
light with incredible energy efficiency

one square block farm 30 stories high

32
00:01:32,259 --> 00:01:39,819
could yield as much food as 10 square

33

kilometres outdoors there are of course

34
00:01:39,819 --> 00:01:44,140
hurdles the crops best suited to

35
00:01:42,310 --> 00:01:47,080
vertical farming may require us to

36
00:01:44,140 --> 00:01:50,050
adjust our diets but would farmers and

37
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:51,489
agribusiness take this lying down or is

38
00:01:50,050 --> 00:01:54,250
it simply that our dollars are best

39
00:01:51,489 --> 00:01:56,920

00:01:54,250 --> 00:01:59,759
