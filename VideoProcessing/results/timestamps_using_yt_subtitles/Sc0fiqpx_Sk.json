after the deluge the little waters have run away taking\nsoil seed fertility fortunately there are effective defenses against runoff\ndamming one of the simplest is contour farming tilling and planting across the\nslope instead of up and down for the best view go into the skies this is\nconservation farming round farming in square country contouring will prevent serious runoff\nin the ordinary rain a shovel mark a wheel track row of grain level across\nthe slope hold the water until it seeps into the soil where the slopes are long\nor steep or on land that absorbs water slowly contouring alone may not be\nenough strip dropping another bulwark of soil depends can be added here you have\nit feels contour strip against erosion that this is the principle working to\nperfection each strip of field in the established\ncrop rotation alternating bands of small grain row crops and grass legume hay\nfields spreads squarely across the path of runoff water in these fields you see\ntwo vegetated water outlets the natural depressions and drainage ways paved with\ngrass against the gully in effect of excess runoff that otherwise will\ninevitably occur a third line of defense against soil erosion is the terrace in\nthis field you see how effectively terraces trap the surplus water most\nterrace systems are the so called drainage type each Terrace constructed\nwith a gentle gradient thus water caught in its downward race moved slowly and\nsafely out of the terrace and into a protected outlet as with the terrace\nsystem itself the outlet should be designed with the help of a soil\nconservationist your county agent an experienced farmer or anyone qualified\nto do the job we have seen three of the main mechanical defenses against erosion\nwith all three of them simple contouring strip cropping and terracing tillage is\non the contour railways use the contour principle\ntrains run as nearly on the level as possible contour farming is like that\non the level to lighten the load save fuel and time and money farming up and\ndown slope is about as illogical as running a train over the hills first up\nwith a hard pull then coasting down easy wasteful of time\nand fuel and energy if your farm is even gently rolling the\nchances are you can profitably use contouring strip cropping or terracing\nperhaps all free but you may ask will I need special equipment to practice soil\nconservation the answer is definitely no you can do it with your present\nequipment but many farms that are adopting a conservation plan must be\nconditioned for it Gulley's like this wasteful and costly\nto farm around can be filled quickly and inexpensively with the disk tiller or\nthe moldboard plow the operator cuts the first slice with the tiller away from\nthe gulley bank on successive rounds he sweeps the loose soil in toward the\ngully round and round cut and sweep take a new\nbite and sweep it in actually that's all there is to this job\nhowever avoid driving your outfit too closely to ditch banks at the start but\nthat is not only dangerous but also unnecessary instead you roll the soil up\nto the gully edge repeat the process until the soil falls into the ditch this\njob can be hurried along by setting the tiller or plough shallow if necessary in\norder to drive faster and throw the soil farther when the gully is nearly full the\noperator can work his outfit in closer as the accident hazard is lessen whether\nthe gully filling job requires a round or two as with a small wash or a dozen\nrounds or more as in this instance the principle of earth-moving is the same in\nlittle more than an hour's time this ditch was filled ready for grassing or\nfor cropping establishing waterways is one of the initial steps in a\nconservation plan because terraces concentrate water thus giving it cutting\npower outlet should be well established before the terraces are constructed the initial step in building terraces is\nsurveying and staking the terrace lines again a job for someone who has had\nprevious experience or training with guide stakes set a helper leads the\noperator on his first round where you start the cuts the order in which you\nmake them varies widely follow the approved method in your\nlocality the return trip of the first round on\nthe lower side of guts takes the first complete round establishes the island usually the ridge is built by moving\nsoil down from above and up from below you want a farmable channel on the\nupside a down slope that is equally adapted to the use of modern power\nequipment the terrace is taking shape this is an earthmoving job the disk\ntiller is ideally suited to it if operated at the proper speed on this\ntrip the ridge is being built by throwing the soil up from below the\ntiller gives even this loosened soil a noticeable throw number of rounds\nnecessary will vary with soil type steepness of slope and other conditions\nit will vary with soil that's wet or dry Saudi or loose ordinarily 20 to 35\nrounds will do the job up one side and back on the other around and around\nuntil channel terrace and back slope meet the desired standard the last wave moves up to the ridge\nwhere the guide steaks were originally set now we've built a terrace having a\nchannel as well as upper and lower slopes that are tillable ears prove that\nthis terrace will catch hold and carry away excess water ridge height and\nchannel cross-section exceed requirements many farmers construct\nterraces with the moldboard plow the principle is the same survey and\nstakeout the terrace Ridgeline establish the island then move the soil in to form\nthe ridge speed counts here too the faster you move the better your plow\nthrows the soil this is terras construction as\naccomplished by an experienced farmer a past winner of terracing contests he\nknows just where and how to drive for best results on each round taking a slice on the lower side he loses no time on turns with modern\npower equipment he lifts and lowers the bottoms without even looking around down\none side and up the other sweeping soil in to make the rig any farmer can easily\nlearn to do this job cutting a slice on the outside the downslope here the plow\nmust throw soil uphill and back again on the inside\nhe's throwing soil down slope but upward against the upper slope of the terrace nearing the end of the job the terrace\nis almost finished and ready to prepare for Planet this is a terrace as built by a champion\nthat's what an experienced farmer can do with the moldboard plow unless\nestablished terraces are painstakingly maintained watched constantly for minor\nbreaks channel water may overtop them wash through as it has done in this\nminor break the tiller and the plow are good maintenance tools the return trip\non the upper side the operation here is maintenance plowing of the terrace\ncombined with normal tillage operations on the balance of the field the\noperation shown here parallels the original terraced construction simply\nthrowing soil to the ridge from above and below rebuilding it replacing the\nsoil that has worked down from the ridge if the terrorists area is in normal\ncropping maintenance of this sort is usually done each year now the break the over top place in the\nridge is almost completely refilled but that loose soil will settle with the\nrains the careful conservation farmer will watch this danger area keeping the\nlow spot field to prevent another breakthrough\nTara's maintenance plowing with the tiller is customary in the south also the job is combined with flat breaking\nof the entire field common practice in many sections is to cut stocks into the\nsoil with the stock cutter and disk Errol this view is on southern\nterrorists land and farmers in the deep south using\npower equipment more and more find the better planner well adapted to the broad\nbase terrace the lister works equally well tractor and better find no\ndifficulty following contours or working over the terrace ridges even in loose\nsoil listing on the contour is an additional aid in holding water until it\nseeps into the soil regardless of the type of planting equipment you have it\ncan be used on terraced land in the Corn Belt farmers are adopting soil saving\nmethods to hold their rich soil on this completely terraced and contoured farm\nthe operator plants his terraced fields easily with the to road drawn planter\nhow it works on terraces may be judged from the fact that the height of this\nTerrace is 26 inches at least 6 inches higher than ordinary in this territory cultivating corn is always a job\nrequiring accurate work the outfit must stay precisely on the roll and move the\nproper amount of soil into the roll this modern outfit does that and does it\non the tightly curving contours and even on the sharply sloping terrace ridges\nwhen you see it done you know it can be done and it gets the weeds and grass\nparticularly that troublesome small grass in the corn row in the south to\nfarmers do this ticklish job on sharply bending terraced slopes cultivating\ncotton peanuts and other crops they do it clean fast and right conservation farming often means more\nhay bigger harvests the hey chopper simplifies the hay making job saves\nlabor and cuts costs to the minimum there is no heavy pitching with an\noutfit like this on the job it picks up all the hay around the curves and on the\nslopes remember the strip crop fields the bands\nof small grain around the heels they are no problem to the light combine farmers\nfind it equally maneuverable inside those narrow strips or on the short\nabrupt slopes of terraces where this combine is working or creeping through\ndown grain winding its way along the terrace grasp waterways vital in conservation\ntillage must be protected not ripped up you need quick positive action on your\ndisc harrow gang modern equipment gives that action in crossing the waterway a\ntouch of the hand on the control lever straightens the game's angles them again\ninstantly on the other side raising planters misters and other\nseeding equipment also is necessary to protect the grass waterway it is easily\ndone with modern equipment here you see a mounted planter which is especially\nadapted to contoured field that's where your equipment maker has joined hands\nwith conservation for many of these improvements were designed for\nconvenience in conservation farming this is a two row cultivator operating in a\ncontoured cornfield the row crop cultivators would be especially damaging\nif they were not raised in crossing the grass watercourses power lifts provide\ninstant raising and lowering to permit feather edging both sides of the\nvegetated outlet in soil maintenance the manure spreader is almost indispensable\nor no conservation farmer deserves the name if barnyard manure is wasted on his\nplace likewise long used fuse demand ground limestone basic slag or other\nsoil sweeteners having applied the line to his pasture land this farmer now\ncultivates it in adding fertilizers if necessary these are the important\npractices in pasture maintenance and pasture renovation the legumes those\nmarvelous nitrogen makers are important in soil maintenance they too belong in\nconservation farming what you get out of your soil and how long you can continue\nprofitable farming depends upon how you manage your land your county agent and\nyour local soil conservationist can help you farm the conservation way a plan can\nbe fitted to your land too and once the plan is established your soil will be\nfortified against exhaustion the land is your heritage preserve it",
