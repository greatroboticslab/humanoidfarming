1
00:00:00,179 --> 00:00:07,080
good afternoon everybody

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,360
my name is Eric sale I am a small fruit

3
00:00:07,080 --> 00:00:11,880
entomologist

4
00:00:08,360 --> 00:00:14,340
at University of Georgia and today I am

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:18,840
going to talk about insect management

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:23,900
for a commercial strawberry production

7
00:00:18,840 --> 00:00:23,900
in today's talk we will

8
00:00:23,960 --> 00:00:30,420
discuss season at the glass tests which

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,719
pests occur what kind of the a year for

10
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,600
strawberries then their management again

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:40,200
will take a season at a glance look at

12
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:43,680
their management options that we have

13
00:00:40,200 --> 00:00:46,320
then I will get discuss a few select

14
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:48,539
tests in detail in terms of their

15
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:52,379
biology and management

16
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:54,420
at the end I will cover some aspects of

17
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:57,000
pollinator management which obviously

18
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:59,100
are important in Strawberry production

19
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,699
systems

20
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:04,799
so take when we look at a sort of a

21
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,140
season at a glance the pests of

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,640
strawberries starting with the

23
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,640
transplant

24
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:14,520
cut worms and aphids are important here

25
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:17,220
at this stage of strawberries and when

26
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,520
you will look at this season at a glass

27
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:22,759
Slide the leaf green leaf shows that

28
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,159
they are they feed on leaves

29
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:30,119
strawberry shows they feed on fruit or

30
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:32,759
flowers and this these sticks will show

31
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,340
that they feed on stems or branches of

32
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:39,420
strawberries so cut worms of course feed

33
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:41,880
on on stems as well as foliage if it's

34
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:47,400
they are sucking pests and they suck

35
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:50,159
primarily on the leaves going moving on

36
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:52,320
into winter it's sort of later part of

37
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,939
winter two spots spider mite they start

38
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,380
they all go all the way through

39
00:01:53,939 --> 00:02:02,340
flowering into Fruit growth period

40
00:01:57,380 --> 00:02:05,159
lead on on foliate of the strawberries

41
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:08,580
then trips also they feed on flowers for

42
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:11,280
the most part during flowering until uh

43
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:14,099
fruit initial fruit growth period as

44
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,580
well strawberry Clipper again feeds on

45
00:02:14,099 --> 00:02:19,700
flowers and

46
00:02:16,580 --> 00:02:22,800
sometimes smaller fruits

47
00:02:19,700 --> 00:02:26,700
also if it's again are important this

48
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:31,080
time of the blueberry growing season

49
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:33,300
then we as we move on lady ligus bugs on

50
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:36,300
especially on their neutral strawberries

51
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:39,060
come into play at early through starting

52
00:02:36,300 --> 00:02:41,580
with early fruit growth stage going all

53
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:44,819
the way to harvest then we during the

54
00:02:41,580 --> 00:02:46,260
Harvest we have serious issues including

55
00:02:44,819 --> 00:02:49,739
sap beetles

56
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:52,200
go on earworms and spotted ring

57
00:02:49,739 --> 00:02:54,540
desophila spotted Wing discipla has

58
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:57,959
become more important for strawberries

59
00:02:54,540 --> 00:02:59,760
recently than it has been in the past as

60
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,819
compared to some other Berry crops where

61
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:06,540
it has been key test ever since it was

62
00:03:02,819 --> 00:03:09,060
detected in the mainland U.S

63
00:03:06,540 --> 00:03:12,060
so now we when we look at a management

64
00:03:09,060 --> 00:03:13,800
of those pests instead of a season at a

65
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:16,920
glance look

66
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:20,220
when we look at post planting fall to

67
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,560
early to midwinter crickets are

68
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,560
important we do have a couple options to

69
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,360
spray cut worms

70
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,580
recyclomine mites are important we do

71
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:32,280
have some miter side options fire ants

72
00:03:29,580 --> 00:03:35,940
obviously we can use those baits that

73
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:38,099
are available here at this screen that I

74
00:03:35,940 --> 00:03:41,599
am showing you now it comes directly

75
00:03:38,099 --> 00:03:44,040
from South East small fruit Consortium

76
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:46,920
strawberry IPM guide

77
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,319
and a number of researchers from the

78
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:51,780
region that get together every year to

79
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,299
update this guide so this is one of the

80
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,159
best resources for you to learn about

81
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:58,319
Pest and disease management for

82
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:00,720
strawberries I highly recommend I'll

83
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:04,620
share I'll show you the main screen and

84
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:07,140
link to access that in the end

85
00:04:04,620 --> 00:04:09,599
so and then two spider mites obviously

86
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:13,319
we have number of my decide options then

87
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:15,620
we move on to pre-harvest or Bloom time

88
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:19,560
late winter to early spring

89
00:04:15,620 --> 00:04:22,440
aphids fire ants floor trips slugs and

90
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:25,440
the snails strawberry Clippers two

91
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:28,979
spotted spider mics these are major pest

92
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:31,520
insect pests or other pest issues of

93
00:04:28,979 --> 00:04:35,580
strawberries and this slide does list

94
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:38,040
options that we have to control them

95
00:04:35,580 --> 00:04:40,860
then we moved into the Harvest period

96
00:04:38,040 --> 00:04:44,580
fire ants obviously still become uh

97
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:46,860
issue set beetles slugs and snails have

98
00:04:44,580 --> 00:04:49,020
become serious issues if we don't manage

99
00:04:46,860 --> 00:04:51,600
the moisture in the fields spotted

100
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:55,500
during the sofa obviously is is one of

101
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:57,960
the key pests tarnish plant bugs and

102
00:04:55,500 --> 00:05:02,639
mites they are still mites can be

103
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:06,120
problem year round for strawberries

104
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:08,520
now I will get into you know this gives

105
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:11,820
you a season at a glass look but I will

106
00:05:08,520 --> 00:05:13,320
show you a share with you a little bit

107
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:17,460
of

108
00:05:13,320 --> 00:05:19,560
and details and some of the select tests

109
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,220
so one thing before we get into annual

110
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:24,840
plastic culture practices do limit many

111
00:05:23,220 --> 00:05:28,740
pests of strawberries for example

112
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:32,400
strawberry root Vivo cyclamen mites they

113
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:35,180
do this particular system does help

114
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:38,460
minimize impact of those

115
00:05:35,180 --> 00:05:41,360
those pests and also root nibbling

116
00:05:38,460 --> 00:05:41,360
diseases

117
00:05:41,400 --> 00:05:47,160
starting with the two-spotted spider

118
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:50,160
mite two spotted spider mites they're

119
00:05:47,160 --> 00:05:54,060
it's very small little sort of difficult

120
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:57,720
to see without hand lens adults are

121
00:05:54,060 --> 00:06:00,180
translucent greenish yellow to Rusty

122
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,479
brown or orange red in color they're

123
00:06:00,180 --> 00:06:06,120
about a half millimeter long oval bodies

124
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:08,580
of those mites have two distinct dark

125
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,000
spots on E1 on each side

126
00:06:08,580 --> 00:06:14,180
and which are which is sort of a

127
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:16,800
distinguished distinguishing feature to

128
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,380
separate these mites from other groups

129
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,500
this is actually accumulation of waste

130
00:06:19,380 --> 00:06:24,780
products within the body that is visible

131
00:06:22,500 --> 00:06:28,440
through their body wall

132
00:06:24,780 --> 00:06:31,319
eggs are clear white and spherical newly

133
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,360
had larvae have only six legs compared

134
00:06:31,319 --> 00:06:36,720
to the eight legs as they grow into

135
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:40,880
older nymphs and adults they develop all

136
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,880
uh four pairs of legs

137
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:49,500
uh two spider spider mites the rate of

138
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:52,440
development is highly variable and it is

139
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,560
uh dependent on temperature ranging from

140
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,319
5 to 20 days to complete their cycle

141
00:06:55,560 --> 00:07:01,080
from egg to adult

142
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:03,180
so females basically they have about two

143
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,520
to four weeks lifespan and each female

144
00:07:03,180 --> 00:07:08,940
can lay several hundred eggs during that

145
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:12,780
time which are enclosed in a fine silk

146
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:16,080
webbing eggs hatch in about three days

147
00:07:12,780 --> 00:07:18,560
and then six-legged larvae emerge and

148
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:22,500
undergo through two more things

149
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:24,000
two modes to achieve than two nymphal

150
00:07:22,500 --> 00:07:27,919
stages

151
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:30,900
and then adults emerge after the second

152
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:34,199
stage and then adults they obviously

153
00:07:30,900 --> 00:07:36,479
restart the the whole process that whole

154
00:07:34,199 --> 00:07:39,419
process can be completed within five to

155
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:41,400
twenty days depending on temperature and

156
00:07:39,419 --> 00:07:44,580
other conditions

157
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:47,160
spider mite feeding on the the primarily

158
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,560
feed on undersides of the leaves and

159
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:52,740
sometimes the stems also they cause

160
00:07:49,560 --> 00:07:55,740
initial stippling which is shown in the

161
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:58,139
picture on the bottom left on the screen

162
00:07:55,740 --> 00:08:00,060
a set of a white spots

163
00:07:58,139 --> 00:08:01,520
and eventually lead to chlorotic

164
00:08:00,060 --> 00:08:05,039
yellowing

165
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,800
or some times it's called bronzing or

166
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:10,759
graying of the leaves and in severe

167
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:14,099
cases necrotic and the defoliation

168
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,860
necrosis and defoliation can occur when

169
00:08:14,099 --> 00:08:20,039
populations are not controlled

170
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,039
Leaf deformities stunted growth Peril

171
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:26,240
Browning built and reduce the fluid

172
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,879
quality quantity and yield

173
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,520
quantity and quality are obviously the

174
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:35,159
outcomes these mites produce silky

175
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:38,039
webbing and leave behind skin castings

176
00:08:35,159 --> 00:08:43,700
and feces that reduce plants as static

177
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,700
value and ability to for the synthesize

178
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:51,480
monitoring is is relatively easy in a

179
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:54,180
part that is up to 10 acre in in size

180
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:57,720
you need to collect only 10 mid-tier

181
00:08:54,180 --> 00:09:01,680
leaflets per acre

182
00:08:57,720 --> 00:09:04,920
and observe them under 10x hand lens if

183
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:07,620
the field is larger than 10 acres then

184
00:09:04,920 --> 00:09:08,940
only five leaflets per acre would

185
00:09:07,620 --> 00:09:11,940
suffice

186
00:09:08,940 --> 00:09:14,220
the thresholds is if you have uh five

187
00:09:11,940 --> 00:09:17,519
miles per leaflet early in the season

188
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,160
that maybe that may warrant application

189
00:09:17,519 --> 00:09:23,220
of Mighty sides or if you have 10 mites

190
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,800
per leaflet during fruit and season then

191
00:09:23,220 --> 00:09:29,100
that is when you need to make spray

192
00:09:25,800 --> 00:09:30,959
applications to control them

193
00:09:29,100 --> 00:09:32,640
there are a number of options that I

194
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,420
showed you in the season at a glass

195
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:38,339
slide as well acromide with the land

196
00:09:35,420 --> 00:09:41,220
cane Mite nyalta these are effective

197
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,680
against all stages of Baron Savvy Zeal

198
00:09:41,220 --> 00:09:45,839
they are effective against eggs and

199
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:48,480
juveniles

200
00:09:45,839 --> 00:09:51,899
portal agreement again juveniles and

201
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:54,959
adults MP Horticultural oils these are

202
00:09:51,899 --> 00:09:58,620
organic organically approved products

203
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,380
which can be used for organic production

204
00:09:58,620 --> 00:10:03,839
and the predatory mites obviously are

205
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:06,300
the buyer control option if if you want

206
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,640
to go that route

207
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:11,279
the next pest the group that I will

208
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:14,100
discuss today is sat beetles

209
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,360
set me the speed on overripe fruit and

210
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:19,820
are attracted to the alcohol produced by

211
00:10:18,360 --> 00:10:22,500
micro

212
00:10:19,820 --> 00:10:25,320
microorganisms feeding on this rotten

213
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:28,019
fruit it can be problematic in Peach

214
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,660
Plum and apple production systems as

215
00:10:28,019 --> 00:10:33,779
well at least three species of ripe

216
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:37,220
fruit feeding beetles are pests of

217
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:40,680
Southeastern strawberries

218
00:10:37,220 --> 00:10:42,980
there are no thresholds developed for

219
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:45,899
set beetles in strawberries

220
00:10:42,980 --> 00:10:48,120
at this point observe ripe fruit when

221
00:10:45,899 --> 00:10:52,380
it's picking surface damage and

222
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:55,740
tunneling if a harvest is anticipated to

223
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,079
run long or if Beetle damage is

224
00:10:55,740 --> 00:10:59,579
suspected bait buckets placed at the

225
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,100
edge of the field will attract small

226
00:10:59,579 --> 00:11:04,620
adults adult beetles so that's that's

227
00:11:02,100 --> 00:11:06,600
one way to control that and cultural

228
00:11:04,620 --> 00:11:08,660
control is highly recommended for set

229
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:12,240
beetles

230
00:11:08,660 --> 00:11:13,880
because there are registered chemicals

231
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:19,860
but those

232
00:11:13,880 --> 00:11:22,140
chemicals can cause issues with the

233
00:11:19,860 --> 00:11:24,180
during the Harvest we don't want to

234
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:25,980
leave too much residues in there we're

235
00:11:24,180 --> 00:11:28,380
going to minimize the pesticide

236
00:11:25,980 --> 00:11:31,440
application during that Harvest Time me

237
00:11:28,380 --> 00:11:34,079
at buckets can also obviously serve as a

238
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:37,680
one cultural control strategy

239
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:41,000
trips now trips is another pest that has

240
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:44,220
recently been problematic in

241
00:11:41,000 --> 00:11:47,100
some situations especially these chili

242
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:49,500
trips they are serious pests in Florida

243
00:11:47,100 --> 00:11:52,740
and have been detected in Georgia as

244
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:55,620
well I'm not sure the status of Chile

245
00:11:52,740 --> 00:11:58,680
trips in Alabama

246
00:11:55,620 --> 00:12:01,440
but they are they have emerged as a

247
00:11:58,680 --> 00:12:04,620
serious issues though both Larry and

248
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:07,500
adults feed on on strawberries Underside

249
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:10,019
the leaves they have piercing and second

250
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,959
pest uh mouth Parts they are originally

251
00:12:10,019 --> 00:12:15,420
from Southeast Asia they have been

252
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:18,000
several times intercepted in at the

253
00:12:15,420 --> 00:12:20,760
ports in in Florida

254
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:24,240
and have been established in Florida

255
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:28,440
since 2005 and in strawberries they have

256
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:30,959
become serious issue since 2015 and now

257
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:33,620
this is one of the key pests or one of

258
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,040
the major pests in Strawberry

259
00:12:33,620 --> 00:12:37,040
systems in Florida

260
00:12:37,680 --> 00:12:43,139
agility trips

261
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:46,139
they as I mentioned they have a piercing

262
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:48,660
sucking mouth bars and they feed on

263
00:12:46,139 --> 00:12:51,300
underside of the leaves to some Jews and

264
00:12:48,660 --> 00:12:53,220
that leads to darkening of the leaflet

265
00:12:51,300 --> 00:12:55,920
and midriff as you see in this picture

266
00:12:53,220 --> 00:13:00,380
on the left side of the screen

267
00:12:55,920 --> 00:13:03,899
that can lead to Leaf curdling of the

268
00:13:00,380 --> 00:13:07,459
strawberries and the image in the middle

269
00:13:03,899 --> 00:13:12,300
shows that severe case scenarios

270
00:13:07,459 --> 00:13:15,540
of just chili traps symptoms

271
00:13:12,300 --> 00:13:17,579
and sometimes it also leads to bronzing

272
00:13:15,540 --> 00:13:20,420
and cracking up the fruit and it's

273
00:13:17,579 --> 00:13:20,420
extreme situation

274
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:27,360
several studies have been done in

275
00:13:24,899 --> 00:13:30,660
Florida as I mentioned this issue in

276
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:32,399
particular is predominant in Florida so

277
00:13:30,660 --> 00:13:34,920
lots of work has been done in Florida

278
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:40,390
and they have developed Management

279
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:43,429
Programs based on products here

280
00:13:40,390 --> 00:13:43,429
[Music]

281
00:13:45,200 --> 00:13:51,899
which is delegate a sale and ciazepir or

282
00:13:50,820 --> 00:13:54,120
axel

283
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,100
these are effective products for for

284
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:58,560
management obviously broad spectrum

285
00:13:56,100 --> 00:14:00,600
insecticides these are all three of

286
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,540
these products are reduced risk products

287
00:14:00,600 --> 00:14:05,700
which is a better option to choose if if

288
00:14:03,540 --> 00:14:09,060
there is a choice but they'll be

289
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:10,440
slightly more expensive likely then you

290
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:13,440
have broad spectrum choices like

291
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:14,399
bifantrin which will be

292
00:14:13,440 --> 00:14:17,880
um

293
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:20,279
a relatively less effective but can be

294
00:14:17,880 --> 00:14:23,160
used in some situations and there will

295
00:14:20,279 --> 00:14:25,680
be less expensive option if you want to

296
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:28,639
go that route

297
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:32,220
then we also have some biorational

298
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:36,120
options that can be used for organic or

299
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:40,440
other reduced risk type systems

300
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:42,740
which include Azera and my control and

301
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:45,120
interestingly these and thermopathogenic

302
00:14:42,740 --> 00:14:49,079
nematodes when they were applied two

303
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:53,220
times they provided really good results

304
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:57,120
so these options are also available for

305
00:14:53,220 --> 00:15:00,899
organic Growers and also other systems

306
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:03,600
where reduced risk option is a desired

307
00:15:00,899 --> 00:15:06,540
now let's get into spotted Wing discipla

308
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:08,820
which is a key pest in most of the berry

309
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:12,899
crops and is becoming increasingly

310
00:15:08,820 --> 00:15:14,639
important for strawberry systems not

311
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:16,620
only in the Southeast but across the

312
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,260
country even in California it has

313
00:15:16,620 --> 00:15:21,060
recently become serious issue in

314
00:15:19,260 --> 00:15:22,560
Strawberry systems as well it was

315
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:28,260
originally discovered in stock

316
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:31,019
strawberries in California in 2008

317
00:15:28,260 --> 00:15:33,720
to 2009 as you see on this screen sort

318
00:15:31,019 --> 00:15:36,779
of an increase the spread of this in

319
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:39,779
invasive pest across the mainland U.S

320
00:15:36,779 --> 00:15:42,120
2009 all West Coast in Florida

321
00:15:39,779 --> 00:15:44,339
and then from that front on it just

322
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:46,320
quickly spread across the country in

323
00:15:44,339 --> 00:15:50,160
2015 we just stopped monitoring it

324
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:51,899
because it was everywhere you looked

325
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:54,779
and spotted when the name comes from

326
00:15:51,899 --> 00:15:58,139
these two dark spots on the uh exterior

327
00:15:54,779 --> 00:16:00,660
margins of the male wings that's why

328
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:03,600
where the spotted Wing name comes from

329
00:16:00,660 --> 00:16:06,600
and males can also be identified using

330
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,160
these two black columns as a feature on

331
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:11,420
the front legs

332
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:14,420
females of this species are uniquely

333
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:17,699
blessed with this very

334
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:20,100
sclerotized and serrated over Pastor

335
00:16:17,699 --> 00:16:22,920
that they use to lay eggs in otherwise

336
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,000
healthy fruit larvae develop inside the

337
00:16:22,920 --> 00:16:26,339
fruit

338
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:28,680
and start feeding

339
00:16:26,339 --> 00:16:31,260
into the whole generation from larvae

340
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:33,839
from egg laying to adult emergence can

341
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:35,579
be completed in eight to ten days at 25

342
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,560
degrees Centigrade

343
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:40,259
which can happen faster if the

344
00:16:37,560 --> 00:16:43,139
temperature is higher so this kind of

345
00:16:40,259 --> 00:16:45,899
tells that this fly can go to several

346
00:16:43,139 --> 00:16:48,839
Generations in one field season

347
00:16:45,899 --> 00:16:52,079
over here is just images using

348
00:16:48,839 --> 00:16:55,199
blueberries we generated this image of

349
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:57,420
how the fruit damage progresses starting

350
00:16:55,199 --> 00:17:00,240
from over position to basically

351
00:16:57,420 --> 00:17:02,339
broadening of the complete unmarketable

352
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,559
fruit is it takes about three to four

353
00:17:02,339 --> 00:17:05,880
days beyond that is fruit is not

354
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:10,439
marketable

355
00:17:05,880 --> 00:17:14,339
overall impact of this fly was estimated

356
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:18,059
to be 718 million dollars in the U.S it

357
00:17:14,339 --> 00:17:21,299
was estimated in 2014 Plus in additional

358
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:24,360
management costs included about 120

359
00:17:21,299 --> 00:17:26,640
million 129 million dollars which means

360
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,280
it's approximately a billion dollar pest

361
00:17:26,640 --> 00:17:30,780
when you look at take all the crops into

362
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:33,179
account

363
00:17:30,780 --> 00:17:35,580
starting with the monitoring initially

364
00:17:33,179 --> 00:17:38,460
we have used these 32 ohms plastic cups

365
00:17:35,580 --> 00:17:41,280
weighted with the yeast sugar slurry

366
00:17:38,460 --> 00:17:43,679
which is a kind of a messy if you leave

367
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,660
it for a week it's become stinky and

368
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:48,419
more than that it becomes really stinky

369
00:17:45,660 --> 00:17:49,980
and not easy to manage recently several

370
00:17:48,419 --> 00:17:50,820
states were participated in these

371
00:17:49,980 --> 00:17:53,640
studies

372
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:55,860
to develop these dry traps which is a

373
00:17:53,640 --> 00:17:58,080
red sticky card embedded with these

374
00:17:55,860 --> 00:18:00,059
commercially available lures and they

375
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:02,400
provided comfortable results and we are

376
00:18:00,059 --> 00:18:06,600
recommending this now for monitoring of

377
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:08,299
swd these sticky red sticky card based

378
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,039
traps

379
00:18:08,299 --> 00:18:13,440
we did monitoring for several years in

380
00:18:11,039 --> 00:18:15,360
in Georgia blueberries and what we

381
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,100
noticed is that flies were active year

382
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:19,640
round they don't sleep during the winter

383
00:18:17,100 --> 00:18:22,980
or slow down they just stick around

384
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:25,679
and what more interestingly but but you

385
00:18:22,980 --> 00:18:28,080
can see in this slide is that numbers

386
00:18:25,679 --> 00:18:31,200
were higher in the wooded areas nearby

387
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:32,700
than the field themselves for the most

388
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,220
part of the year

389
00:18:32,700 --> 00:18:38,100
so it means there is a obviously

390
00:18:35,220 --> 00:18:40,980
alternative host to plants that occur in

391
00:18:38,100 --> 00:18:44,220
the wooded areas as you see in this

392
00:18:40,980 --> 00:18:45,960
picture we have Carl Pines that are

393
00:18:44,220 --> 00:18:48,419
mostly around the blueberry Orchards

394
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,700
here are other carbs including

395
00:18:48,419 --> 00:18:52,919
strawberries but the understory is

396
00:18:50,700 --> 00:18:54,900
filled with several other species and

397
00:18:52,919 --> 00:18:58,679
when we looked within those

398
00:18:54,900 --> 00:19:02,220
several species were identified where

399
00:18:58,679 --> 00:19:04,620
swd females were able to lay eggs and

400
00:19:02,220 --> 00:19:07,020
complete development in many of those

401
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:10,679
plants in the world so there's something

402
00:19:07,020 --> 00:19:13,200
that we need to do to eliminate those to

403
00:19:10,679 --> 00:19:15,539
those alternative hosts which will help

404
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:19,260
in the long term but

405
00:19:15,539 --> 00:19:21,780
for now management is includes

406
00:19:19,260 --> 00:19:23,900
biological control chemical control

407
00:19:21,780 --> 00:19:26,039
behavioral and cultural control

408
00:19:23,900 --> 00:19:27,539
biological control this being an

409
00:19:26,039 --> 00:19:29,760
invasive species

410
00:19:27,539 --> 00:19:32,220
biological control is is very

411
00:19:29,760 --> 00:19:35,460
complicated a lot of work has been done

412
00:19:32,220 --> 00:19:36,780
on classical bio control by large teams

413
00:19:35,460 --> 00:19:39,840
of researchers from multiple

414
00:19:36,780 --> 00:19:42,600
institutions after eight to ten years of

415
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:45,539
work finally we were able to get permits

416
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:48,179
of to release those exotic parastors

417
00:19:45,539 --> 00:19:51,419
that we imported from native regions of

418
00:19:48,179 --> 00:19:53,580
swd China and South Korea

419
00:19:51,419 --> 00:19:56,880
and several states are now building up

420
00:19:53,580 --> 00:19:58,980
the colonies to test to release those in

421
00:19:56,880 --> 00:20:01,860
the field and see how they will help

422
00:19:58,980 --> 00:20:04,200
control swd currently there is no bio

423
00:20:01,860 --> 00:20:06,120
control in the field based on our native

424
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:08,580
Paris stones

425
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:10,679
all right so chemical control is the

426
00:20:08,580 --> 00:20:13,559
primary means to control it I'm just

427
00:20:10,679 --> 00:20:16,140
showing you this one slide which was the

428
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:19,640
first attempt to control swd back in

429
00:20:16,140 --> 00:20:21,720
2012. you see very few options primarily

430
00:20:19,640 --> 00:20:23,940
organophosphorus and pythroids with

431
00:20:21,720 --> 00:20:27,000
spinosins

432
00:20:23,940 --> 00:20:29,340
now look at this this is where we stand

433
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,340
right now we have lots of options

434
00:20:29,340 --> 00:20:34,380
chemical options to control swd they

435
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:36,840
belong to several chemical classes which

436
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:38,880
means we have the option to do really

437
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:40,740
nice resistance management which is

438
00:20:38,880 --> 00:20:43,820
highly recommended because resistance

439
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:48,179
has become a major issue in California

440
00:20:43,820 --> 00:20:49,679
uh in in many cropping systems there we

441
00:20:48,179 --> 00:20:52,200
haven't seen resistance in other states

442
00:20:49,679 --> 00:20:54,120
yet but some states have started to show

443
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:57,140
initial signs of it so highly

444
00:20:54,120 --> 00:20:59,340
recommended that Growers Implement

445
00:20:57,140 --> 00:21:03,480
resistance management by rotating

446
00:20:59,340 --> 00:21:05,039
products from one class to another

447
00:21:03,480 --> 00:21:06,960
when you look at organic management

448
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,080
that's where we are in trouble because

449
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:13,200
entrust is the only one that has if good

450
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:16,140
efficacy but even that doesn't touch the

451
00:21:13,200 --> 00:21:20,299
line of threshold of being good so it

452
00:21:16,140 --> 00:21:23,340
means we need to add additional

453
00:21:20,299 --> 00:21:25,799
non-chemical components to make sure we

454
00:21:23,340 --> 00:21:28,260
are able to control a stability in

455
00:21:25,799 --> 00:21:30,320
organic systems

456
00:21:28,260 --> 00:21:32,940
here are some sample management

457
00:21:30,320 --> 00:21:36,840
season-long management programs again

458
00:21:32,940 --> 00:21:38,760
these are just a set of samples now we

459
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:41,820
have several chemical options that can

460
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:44,100
be included and in General weekly

461
00:21:41,820 --> 00:21:47,820
applications are recommended in organic

462
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:49,799
systems we have to make some chemicals

463
00:21:47,820 --> 00:21:52,559
don't have week-long residues we need to

464
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:56,280
go back after three days to make sure we

465
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,820
protect the fruit against this fly

466
00:21:56,280 --> 00:22:02,220
when we have a sort of a decisions to

467
00:21:59,820 --> 00:22:04,440
make for the whole season it is highly

468
00:22:02,220 --> 00:22:06,840
recommended that you start with the

469
00:22:04,440 --> 00:22:09,780
highest heaviest chemicals which means

470
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:11,159
the most effective chemicals as you see

471
00:22:09,780 --> 00:22:13,679
here

472
00:22:11,159 --> 00:22:15,360
infest light the intervention in the

473
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:17,900
second slide we started with low

474
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,120
efficacy product and still fly

475
00:22:17,900 --> 00:22:23,700
populations sustained they did not

476
00:22:21,120 --> 00:22:26,520
disappear however in the third picture

477
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:28,740
when you see here that a highly

478
00:22:26,520 --> 00:22:31,260
effective product was used it knocked

479
00:22:28,740 --> 00:22:33,299
the fly populations down and then you

480
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:35,220
can use low efficacy in mid-efficacy

481
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:37,500
product for the rest of the season to

482
00:22:35,220 --> 00:22:41,900
maintain that low level of populations

483
00:22:37,500 --> 00:22:41,900
which will not cause economic damage

484
00:22:41,940 --> 00:22:45,659
all of the products obviously when we

485
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:48,840
talk about insecticides they do have

486
00:22:45,659 --> 00:22:51,840
harmful effects against beneficial

487
00:22:48,840 --> 00:22:55,020
insects so we need to keep that in mind

488
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:58,440
even organic products do have negative

489
00:22:55,020 --> 00:23:01,320
effects on beneficial insects so we need

490
00:22:58,440 --> 00:23:04,320
to always keep that in mind one thing we

491
00:23:01,320 --> 00:23:07,620
can do to minimize the non-target

492
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:08,940
effects of those insecticides is to

493
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:12,720
spray

494
00:23:08,940 --> 00:23:15,419
in the Dawn and dusk times when flies

495
00:23:12,720 --> 00:23:18,240
ought active in the field themselves and

496
00:23:15,419 --> 00:23:20,700
we can basically expose flies to direct

497
00:23:18,240 --> 00:23:22,860
spray residues rather than spraying

498
00:23:20,700 --> 00:23:24,960
other times of the day when they are not

499
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:26,940
active and then relying on their

500
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:31,080
exposure to the residues which may not

501
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:33,659
be as strong and may not be as effective

502
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:37,440
so recommending it is recommended to

503
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:40,140
spray during the Dawn and Dusk and the

504
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:43,140
other benefit is that less beneficials

505
00:23:40,140 --> 00:23:46,559
are active during that time of the day

506
00:23:43,140 --> 00:23:49,200
so that helps in in many ways

507
00:23:46,559 --> 00:23:52,679
now moving on to behavioral control we

508
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:55,260
have tested uh several behavioral

509
00:23:52,679 --> 00:23:57,600
control strategies the goal is to

510
00:23:55,260 --> 00:23:59,340
develop attract and kill approach where

511
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:01,620
we have an attractant that can attract

512
00:23:59,340 --> 00:24:04,020
flies away from the fruit and then we

513
00:24:01,620 --> 00:24:06,900
have a toxic and mixed in it to kill

514
00:24:04,020 --> 00:24:08,700
them by the residues

515
00:24:06,900 --> 00:24:10,460
so this one technology that was

516
00:24:08,700 --> 00:24:12,720
developed by iska

517
00:24:10,460 --> 00:24:15,419
Technologies company based in California

518
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:19,020
we tested several years ago

519
00:24:15,419 --> 00:24:24,600
and it did show some promise as you see

520
00:24:19,020 --> 00:24:28,980
it reduced this it was 87 less fruit

521
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,140
infestation in than when this particular

522
00:24:28,980 --> 00:24:34,679
product was applied which has an

523
00:24:31,140 --> 00:24:38,039
attractive mix with insecticide and in

524
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:40,740
this case insecticide was spinocid

525
00:24:38,039 --> 00:24:42,780
now the same company is developing these

526
00:24:40,740 --> 00:24:45,299
new formulations which are even more

527
00:24:42,780 --> 00:24:48,260
attractive however the difference is

528
00:24:45,299 --> 00:24:51,539
that these new Farm TD formulation and

529
00:24:48,260 --> 00:24:53,760
or formulations TD in particular is the

530
00:24:51,539 --> 00:24:56,520
most effective and this is just by

531
00:24:53,760 --> 00:24:57,780
itself attracted by itself is stored as

532
00:24:56,520 --> 00:24:59,880
adjuvant

533
00:24:57,780 --> 00:25:01,559
it is currently in EPA for a

534
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:03,120
constitution to be commercially

535
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:05,820
available hopefully this will be

536
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:07,880
available later this season or next year

537
00:25:05,820 --> 00:25:11,100
this is sold as

538
00:25:07,880 --> 00:25:14,240
ajimand itself and farmers will need to

539
00:25:11,100 --> 00:25:18,140
mix insecticide of their choice with it

540
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:20,640
to use this as a check and kill too

541
00:25:18,140 --> 00:25:22,919
other chemicals can be protect was

542
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:25,380
developed in Europe and several Labs we

543
00:25:22,919 --> 00:25:27,360
tested it last year here in the U.S and

544
00:25:25,380 --> 00:25:30,440
we found that even half weight of

545
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:35,100
interest can give us just as much

546
00:25:30,440 --> 00:25:37,500
activity as Fuller rate of interest so

547
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:40,799
or even more in slightly more in some

548
00:25:37,500 --> 00:25:43,740
cases so this is really good product

549
00:25:40,799 --> 00:25:47,520
again currently in EPA to be considered

550
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:50,580
for registration as agile and hopefully

551
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:53,340
this will be available later this season

552
00:25:50,580 --> 00:25:56,120
or next year

553
00:25:53,340 --> 00:25:59,400
cultural controls again these are really

554
00:25:56,120 --> 00:26:01,559
important the goal here is to modify the

555
00:25:59,400 --> 00:26:04,860
environment to make the environment less

556
00:26:01,559 --> 00:26:07,380
attractive for uh stability

557
00:26:04,860 --> 00:26:10,860
swd flies are very sensitive to

558
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,980
temperature and humidity they don't like

559
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:16,799
high temperatures and they don't like

560
00:26:12,980 --> 00:26:20,059
dry conditions so what can we do to

561
00:26:16,799 --> 00:26:20,059
change modify the environment

562
00:26:22,320 --> 00:26:27,840
so yes

563
00:26:24,840 --> 00:26:30,779
in this case we can do okay so let me go

564
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:32,820
through one by one by one first starting

565
00:26:30,779 --> 00:26:35,700
with exclusion that's one cultural

566
00:26:32,820 --> 00:26:38,279
practice or a strategy that you can use

567
00:26:35,700 --> 00:26:41,700
to cover the fruit production area or

568
00:26:38,279 --> 00:26:44,279
berries themselves keep the flies out

569
00:26:41,700 --> 00:26:48,179
this is one foolproof technology that

570
00:26:44,279 --> 00:26:52,320
can use but it is expensive so uh

571
00:26:48,179 --> 00:26:54,659
however some Farmers I have just talked

572
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,659
to they have repurposed their currently

573
00:26:54,659 --> 00:26:59,220
used materials in part and in part they

574
00:26:57,659 --> 00:27:02,580
got new materials to make it more

575
00:26:59,220 --> 00:27:05,760
economically feasible but once you have

576
00:27:02,580 --> 00:27:08,700
it installed it does work as a foolproof

577
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:11,460
technology to control swd to keep the

578
00:27:08,700 --> 00:27:13,919
flies away

579
00:27:11,460 --> 00:27:16,260
irrigation is you know most of the fruit

580
00:27:13,919 --> 00:27:19,400
production does need the irrigation

581
00:27:16,260 --> 00:27:21,960
system if you have the option use uh

582
00:27:19,400 --> 00:27:24,299
drip irrigation as compared to the

583
00:27:21,960 --> 00:27:26,940
overhead irrigation because drip

584
00:27:24,299 --> 00:27:31,140
irrigation creates less humidity in the

585
00:27:26,940 --> 00:27:34,080
canopy zones and that is that helps keep

586
00:27:31,140 --> 00:27:36,179
the stability populations lower in the

587
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:40,320
fruiting Zone

588
00:27:36,179 --> 00:27:43,440
mulching is another way to control swd

589
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,659
the principle here is that when flies

590
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,240
larvae are fully fed inside the fruit

591
00:27:45,659 --> 00:27:51,720
they come out of the fruit and drop to

592
00:27:48,240 --> 00:27:55,620
the ground to pupate if we have a black

593
00:27:51,720 --> 00:27:57,600
beet mat or some Mulch on the ground to

594
00:27:55,620 --> 00:27:59,340
prevent a lottery from getting into the

595
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:03,360
ground to prepare it they will get

596
00:27:59,340 --> 00:28:06,620
toasted and killed on the surface that

597
00:28:03,360 --> 00:28:10,500
again has been very useful

598
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:12,659
way to control the stability flies in

599
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:16,320
high pressure situations

600
00:28:12,659 --> 00:28:19,559
pruning is is the other way to change

601
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:22,440
the canopy environment when you we do

602
00:28:19,559 --> 00:28:24,000
heavy pruning but it does it allows more

603
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:26,159
light through the canopy into the

604
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:28,620
fruiting Zone where flies are likely to

605
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,240
you know spend most of the time to

606
00:28:28,620 --> 00:28:32,520
infest food

607
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:34,799
and it does reduce humidity a little bit

608
00:28:32,520 --> 00:28:38,340
so that slight increase in temperature

609
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:42,419
and decrease in humidity does lower fly

610
00:28:38,340 --> 00:28:44,520
population in that zone to help with swd

611
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:47,159
control

612
00:28:44,520 --> 00:28:49,260
Harvest frequency is again important if

613
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:51,539
you leave ripe fruit out in the field

614
00:28:49,260 --> 00:28:53,460
for too long that is very attractive to

615
00:28:51,539 --> 00:28:57,419
flies and flies will have more

616
00:28:53,460 --> 00:28:59,880
opportunity to infest so remove the ripe

617
00:28:57,419 --> 00:29:02,640
fruit as frequently as possible that

618
00:28:59,880 --> 00:29:06,419
will minimize the risk of fruit

619
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:08,779
infestation by swd

620
00:29:06,419 --> 00:29:12,000
sanitation is again extremely important

621
00:29:08,779 --> 00:29:14,760
because ripe rotten fruit on the ground

622
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,559
is attractive for flies they will be

623
00:29:14,760 --> 00:29:19,380
attracted from others surroundings into

624
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:23,039
the field if they have more of that

625
00:29:19,380 --> 00:29:26,039
rotten fruit so keep the field clean any

626
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:29,159
ripe over ripe rotten fruit it must be

627
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,380
removed as soon as possible and you can

628
00:29:29,159 --> 00:29:32,360
do deal with it two ways number one is

629
00:29:31,380 --> 00:29:35,580
either

630
00:29:32,360 --> 00:29:37,200
seal them in the plastic bags and leave

631
00:29:35,580 --> 00:29:40,799
them for two to three days indirect Sun

632
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:43,559
that will kill all flies or you can bury

633
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:46,440
them at least two feet in in the ground

634
00:29:43,559 --> 00:29:49,260
to make sure that larvae or pupils or

635
00:29:46,440 --> 00:29:51,600
our flies don't come out again to become

636
00:29:49,260 --> 00:29:54,840
source of infestation

637
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:57,120
last part is the post Harvest once you

638
00:29:54,840 --> 00:30:00,559
have harvested fruit and you suspect

639
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:03,840
there may be infestation is always

640
00:30:00,559 --> 00:30:06,299
possible to to control that or kill

641
00:30:03,840 --> 00:30:09,440
those larvae if you can store the fruit

642
00:30:06,299 --> 00:30:13,320
at 36 degrees

643
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:15,779
Fahrenheit for up to three days this

644
00:30:13,320 --> 00:30:19,679
will allow more time

645
00:30:15,779 --> 00:30:22,039
for you to market the fruit and also it

646
00:30:19,679 --> 00:30:25,580
will kill majority of the Larry inside

647
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:25,580
inside the fruit

648
00:30:25,860 --> 00:30:30,000
all right so when we talk about

649
00:30:27,659 --> 00:30:32,640
strawberries pollinators are extremely

650
00:30:30,000 --> 00:30:36,539
important and there is a very little

651
00:30:32,640 --> 00:30:38,940
information about uh wild pollinators in

652
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:42,840
particular which are extremely important

653
00:30:38,940 --> 00:30:44,100
for pollination in strawberries

654
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:47,220
so

655
00:30:44,100 --> 00:30:50,159
let's double yield of course and quality

656
00:30:47,220 --> 00:30:51,659
is increased with insect pollination

657
00:30:50,159 --> 00:30:54,299
and what do you mean by pollinator

658
00:30:51,659 --> 00:30:57,659
Health in in this system which is

659
00:30:54,299 --> 00:30:59,700
currently one of the major issues and we

660
00:30:57,659 --> 00:31:02,520
need to take care of it

661
00:30:59,700 --> 00:31:05,520
couple things that can be you know part

662
00:31:02,520 --> 00:31:07,679
of this whole concept of you know how do

663
00:31:05,520 --> 00:31:09,659
we look at pollinator Health pesticide

664
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:13,919
use of course can negatively affect

665
00:31:09,659 --> 00:31:15,659
pollinator Health if B densities do how

666
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,140
many bees do we have in the field and

667
00:31:15,659 --> 00:31:23,279
Landscape what other sources uh these

668
00:31:19,140 --> 00:31:26,760
bees can feed off of and then that

669
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:29,399
contributes to overall population and

670
00:31:26,760 --> 00:31:30,840
their activity in the field that leads

671
00:31:29,399 --> 00:31:34,860
to pollination

672
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:36,899
these are the key or general pollinators

673
00:31:34,860 --> 00:31:38,760
that we anticipate the first one is

674
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:42,080
enemies of course and the other ones are

675
00:31:38,760 --> 00:31:45,960
wild bees that play the key role in

676
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:50,220
pollination and Southeastern systems

677
00:31:45,960 --> 00:31:53,640
so what we look for what uh is this kind

678
00:31:50,220 --> 00:31:57,779
of a diagram shows you the red more red

679
00:31:53,640 --> 00:32:01,140
means more negative for uh pesticide if

680
00:31:57,779 --> 00:32:03,299
you know more negative for bees in

681
00:32:01,140 --> 00:32:06,419
lighter color means better system so

682
00:32:03,299 --> 00:32:09,720
first on the top left corner is you know

683
00:32:06,419 --> 00:32:12,360
more pesticides and the top down lower

684
00:32:09,720 --> 00:32:14,640
right corner is the least amount of

685
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:17,940
pesticides so that is the best one for

686
00:32:14,640 --> 00:32:20,820
for bees bottom line

687
00:32:17,940 --> 00:32:23,399
uh when you know they see an IPM is all

688
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:25,020
about making decisions and when to take

689
00:32:23,399 --> 00:32:27,720
management action is based on

690
00:32:25,020 --> 00:32:29,880
understanding of which pests are present

691
00:32:27,720 --> 00:32:33,059
and if we need to identify those pests

692
00:32:29,880 --> 00:32:35,640
how many of those pests are there what

693
00:32:33,059 --> 00:32:38,100
type of injury are they causing and how

694
00:32:35,640 --> 00:32:41,100
that injury translates into yield loss

695
00:32:38,100 --> 00:32:43,620
we need to know that by active sampling

696
00:32:41,100 --> 00:32:46,020
active monitoring of those pests and

697
00:32:43,620 --> 00:32:50,039
once we know that then we can get into

698
00:32:46,020 --> 00:32:53,120
making that management decisions

699
00:32:50,039 --> 00:32:57,179
then what management tools are available

700
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:59,820
and what we can select to make sure that

701
00:32:57,179 --> 00:33:02,820
we will control the past but also we

702
00:32:59,820 --> 00:33:05,580
will not harm the beneficial insects or

703
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:08,820
other beneficial organisms in the field

704
00:33:05,580 --> 00:33:10,740
that is extremely important component of

705
00:33:08,820 --> 00:33:13,260
Pest Management

706
00:33:10,740 --> 00:33:15,480
so now when it comes to management there

707
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,260
is a really important resource that I

708
00:33:15,480 --> 00:33:21,559
mentioned earlier is the southeast

709
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:24,600
smallfield Consortium guide that is

710
00:33:21,559 --> 00:33:27,360
developed and updated every year

711
00:33:24,600 --> 00:33:29,299
for the whole region

712
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,360
it's available at

713
00:33:29,299 --> 00:33:35,580
smallfruit.org if you go online

714
00:33:32,360 --> 00:33:39,480
smallfruit.org you can find this guide

715
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:42,659
and and other small fruit guides as well

716
00:33:39,480 --> 00:33:45,240
this is just the last excuse me this is

717
00:33:42,659 --> 00:33:48,860
the last page of that guide which shows

718
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:51,779
you know in a one

719
00:33:48,860 --> 00:33:54,480
page all chemicals that are available

720
00:33:51,779 --> 00:33:56,820
and which pests they are effective and

721
00:33:54,480 --> 00:33:59,760
what is the level of efficacy here you

722
00:33:56,820 --> 00:34:03,600
know AE shows Excellence BG very good G

723
00:33:59,760 --> 00:34:06,140
good and and those things are denoted

724
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:06,140
foreign

725
00:34:06,260 --> 00:34:12,960
of the last a few of last pages at the

726
00:34:10,859 --> 00:34:16,399
end of the guide so I highly recommend

727
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:19,500
you using this guide as a resource for

728
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:21,960
strawberry Pest Management it has really

729
00:34:19,500 --> 00:34:24,300
valuable information another resource

730
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:27,359
that was recently relatively recently

731
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:30,480
created is in my IPM app it does have

732
00:34:27,359 --> 00:34:33,300
information about strawberry diseases

733
00:34:30,480 --> 00:34:36,560
and pests as well so you can download

734
00:34:33,300 --> 00:34:40,320
that available for both

735
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:42,359
both apple and other devices Android

736
00:34:40,320 --> 00:34:44,839
devices

737
00:34:42,359 --> 00:34:44,839
foreign

738
00:34:49,099 --> 00:34:54,179
Don Johnson and say uncle Lahiri Who

739
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:57,839
provided some of the slides that I

740
00:34:54,179 --> 00:35:00,960
shared and also my lab my team and

741
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,839
sponsors that has sponsored our research

742
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:06,560
with that I'll take any questions if we

743
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,560
have some time
