  "text": "hi everyone and good morning I'm gonna be showing you two immune boosting garlic ferments today so Patrick and I were talking just before we started rolling about all different kinds of things that we do for immune boosting purposes and we started to write a list but the list was like this big so rather than just I tell you all the things we do I thought that I would just start by telling you what we've done today what was what we've done so far um first thing we did well it started last night but then I could go on and on but I'll just stop it last night we went to bed as early as we could after we'd had dinner we went to put the goats to bed he went for a walk and back to stop hunting skills and then read stories and then set the fire the mornings so we tried to go to bed as early as we could we tried to wake up with the Sun which we did so we woke up just before dawn so that's part of it just sort of being in in the circadian rhythm to align that with the Sun we set we lit the fire so that was we chopped the wood we were thankful for the wood so we started with some gratefulness we hopped on that Patrick and I hopped on our bikes we don't have a car so being on our bikes and being Hardy to the cold which it is now here in central Victoria it started to get very cold with these autumnal mornings and nights and days to vote on our bikes down to the local lake we stripped off and to be naked first thing out in the world he's a beautiful thing we went swimming for five to ten minutes or so and then what freezing and it was glorious and then we danced on the deck on the jetty and then put our clothes back on and then rode home sat by the fire had tea fed the chickens for breakfast we had fermented pancakes with it some way and some from our cheese making some raw way some and eggs from our chickens I'm saying I'm a lot it's early still some a cornmeal some spelt flour and some buckwheat flour and then we had it with our honey and some gifted blackberry jam and some yogurt and now we're ready to talk about our some of our ferments that we you're gonna mention the argument oh yeah we had an argument which is also part of immune boosting especially when we wake up and we're filled with oxytocin and all the good stuff but also having our voices heard and being able to express that in a safe environment is part of yes feeling confident and feeling loved and valued even in the more challenging moments so I love you passionately so we try to eat something fermented with every meal and especially this time of year we really focus on other building up our medicine chests what can we grow what can we gather what can we ferment what can we preserve what can we prepare that is going to see us out through the cold and flu season so my go to my person will go to Patrick has other ones and I'll talk about that in a minute but my person will go to is garlic I really like it's like antiviral antibiotic properties and I always feel much better after I've got a tickle I feeling a little bit vulnerable then I like to go for garlic but I do find if I have it in its raw form then I do get a bit of an upset tummy so I'd like to ferment it which helps break down the sugars in it and make it much more as predigested when it's cemented to make it much more palatable and easy to digest and easy to ingest so when we're sitting by the fire before our argument we had some are we certain we've peel some of our homegrown Dalek so ferments I'm going to show you this morning one is a sweet one one is a savory one and they both take about six months to ferment so we do have some from previous years so we have very long cold winter seasons here so even if what we ferment today is going to last us well into the cold season so the first one I'm going to show you is a honey garlic ferment so just have a regular-sized wrap and some peels clothes and just going to put some in a jar like this and maybe a few less cuz I need a few more for the next one I'm simply going to you've got some of our honey from our bees here so I'm simply going to cover the cloves with honey and you can put as much as you want in as long as all of the clothes are covered with the honey so we eat try to eat a lot of fermented foods for a number of reasons the first one is because they taste really good the second one is because it preserves and increases the longevity of the food that we grow we do it because of the the now what indigenous people have known you know in every culture what they've known for thousands and thousands of years is that fermented foods are good for our well-being you know what we know about the gut brain access and how great it is to eat fermented foods that it's good for our gut microbiome but it's also yeah it's just good for whole body health so people who eat a lot of fermented foods I think can attest to the benefits so I might give this to my assistant woody would you like to take the spoon thank you and the gut regulates the immune system so that's a big one so as I said in our doing lots of things with apples video that the aliens so leek and garlic and onions and chives are full of prebiotics which is what the probiotics in our guts ate so to have this this is the garlic is the prebiotic and it'll turn into a probiotic once that starts once the honey will draw the liquid out of the garlic and it will become quite runny so at the moment you can see there that's gonna take a long time this is raw honey and yeah just to note about a couple of things a few step backs a few steps back that in terms of sterilizing I just use very hot soapy water I don't need to sterilize this job because we're courting life and so if I was preserving for a long time I sat out or fruit stood fruit then I were to sterilize my jars but here I don't need to sew just hot soapy water when it's dry then you can put your ingredients in and in terms of honey we're very fortunate that we have our own bees that we harvest honey from but if you don't have that then if you can just try to get local honey is really good because it's got all the properties that you need for your local bio region and also the cold extracted is good not heat extracted okay so we have our garlic and honey so what I'm gonna do when I finish up with you guys here is that I'm gonna make sure the lid is on really tired I'm gonna stick it in a cupboard and I'm gonna just turn it on its lid like this and then tomorrow I'm going to turn it back this way in the cupboard and then keep doing this until the garlic the honey starts to get really runny and then when it does it's then you know that it's starting to ferment and so I'm going to keep doing that for the next two weeks just keep turning it because the garlic is going it's got the it's got oxygen in it and it's going to want to pop to the top of the honey and as it starts to ferment everyday I'm going to so in a couple of days I'll start doing this so I'm going to just make sure all the honey is tripped down and I'm just going to open the lid like that in fermenting language that's called burping where you release the carbon dioxide make sure the lids on really tight and then stick it back in the cupboard like that the next day like that open it up release carbon dioxide lid back on until it's really really runny and then I'm just going to keep it in the cupboard for six months and then in six month time I've got a couple here this is from 2018 so two years ago eight for 2018 and you can see how runny geez that's not going to take very long for this honey that we've just made today to get that runny and also you can see that it's gone dark and so this was the same color honey to begin with and you can see the change in color and consistency and so now what happens through the magic of fermentation is that the honey and the garlic swap properties so the garlic becomes honey the honey becomes garlic garlicky and so now whenever I've got a tickle or feeling a bit rundown then I will take a clove and just munch on it and it doesn't have that sting of a raw clove of garlic and all the honey that's left over so this is what I give to woody to have so he just has that on a tea spoon if he doesn't want the garlic or I'll use some of the the honey to braise meat or what I usually do is just use it in a salad dressing and here's one that I've got from last year for 2019 and you can see that these cloves are a little bit bigger because they haven't been all of the the liquid in the garlic hasn't been drawn out yet so the reason that we put it in the cupboard is because it doesn't want doesn't like to be in the light it's just a ferment that likes to it's a private ferment let's just put it that way like this lays that what are they called there's light a lava lamp a garlic lava lamp okay and when I finished you I'm also gonna put a label on it just so I can I know what what year it is so in two years time you can say I know remember that day right so the next cement I'm going to show you is a fermented garlic paste so I think I'll show you the end product first so this is what you can see I've had my fingers in there so this is a garlic kraut which is just like a garlic paste so it's two ingredients garlic and salt and through the magic of fermentation you can see the colour has gone from this to this dark color so I'll just show you how to make that this is amazing and anything that you're cooking and you think Oh what does it kind of need it means necessary little something garlic rat these are always your answer definitely my go-to and I can't make enough of it put my garlic cloves into my food processor and I haven't actually tried to do these with a mortar and pestle if you give it a go and it works or doesn't work please let me know so I'm just gonna guess with the salt a couple of sprinkles I'd say and when I've taught this in the past people have wondered about botulism I've never had an issue with it so I can't talk to that I'm going to grind it up make it into a paste skis nose [Music] scoop it into a jar so I recommend using non-iodized salt for safe implementation that's best we get our salt from the pink leg up Needham baller and this was brought back by our neighbor Bob so thanks Bob okay so scoop that into my jar so if you'd like to know a little bit more about fermentation Patrick wrote a book a couple of years ago called reefer minting culture if you'd like a copy of that as a PDF then just message us and we'll send you a copy just looking at the history and as well as the health benefits of fermentation in the context of terrain theory which is really how we live our lives so making sure we not making sure but just being open and not fearful to handling moss and rocks and wood and honey and soil and just be part of life so again this will need to be burped I'm just gonna set this on my fermenting table you can have the lid screwed on you can have it not screwed on this is really an amazing ferment to make and to have your kids watch you watch part of the process because it changes colors so profoundly and so miraculously I've had these um I've done these ferments before and it's gone bright blue I've had it go green the last time I made it with this one here I filled the jar up so that was a lot garlic clove peeling and it lifted the lid was just sitting there and it lifted the lid up like this and it went a kind of green and this was just sitting on it and then the next day it went back down again and then slowly over time it went from this beautiful greeny blue color to this now brown color it was really amazing so yeah so this is about a year old but after six months it was ready and it takes on this kind of caramely lemony garlicky salty flavor and the thing that I use this for most often is for rubbing on meat that we have on roast but you can also just have it on toast having them toast with a bit of honey is also really delicious yeah okay I'm just going to show you some other ferments that I do exactly the same way as this garlic cement so I've got here's some grated ginger so you can see how liquidy this is and at first it took a long time like the garlic did to turn over and so yeah this is really delicious just to have a teaspoon of it and in Chinese medicine they call ginger the messenger because it's so good for our circulation and it helps all the different foods and all the different parts of our blood to get to where it need the components of our blood to get to where it needs to go in the body here I've got a the last little remnants of a tumeric ginger ferment also just grated turmeric and then cover with honey the turmeric one I love ginger that the turmeric one is probably my favorite which is where there's not much of a left at this here is some bloodlines and that a food co-op cut in and to eat them by themselves is really like candy they're really delicious and also sometimes cut little pieces of it up and stick it in our fruit loaf or you can just sort of eat it by yourself it's just magical this one here is orange peel chili and black peppercorns and again highly medicinal and delicious I've got here that our friend Rosie made thanks Rosie with our hops it's just the last little bit of our hops in last one here this is ginger tumeric lemon orange peel and peppercorns and again medicinal and the peel just goes candied and it was just fresh peel that we chopped up and put in the honey so these are just a couple of the natural flu shot ferments that we make every year if you have any questions please send us a message or leave it in the comments we have been overwhelmed by people sending us questions and messages so we will get back to all of you might just take a while okay Viva",
