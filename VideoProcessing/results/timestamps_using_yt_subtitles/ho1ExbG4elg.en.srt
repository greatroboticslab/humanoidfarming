wisdom Money Matters Channel where today

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,679
we're diving into topic of Agriculture

5
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,240
trends that the world watches as Farms

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,759
transform no longer places of simple

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,840
tools and timeworn tradition they are

8
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:20,240
now hubs of Cutting Edge technology this

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,160
is the era of smart agriculture it's a

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,599
revolution driven by the need to feed a

11
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,960
growing population we need to produce

12
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:29,679
more food more efficiently and all while

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:32,079
caring for our planet smart agriculture

14
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:33,960
power by technology is rising to the

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:36,040
challenge this is not just about better

16
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:38,760
yields but about a smarter more

17
00:00:36,040 --> 00:00:41,920
sustainable future for farming the

18
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,960
numbers speak for themselves the global

00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,039
smart agriculture Market is booming

20
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:49,559
predicted to reach a staggering 33

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,879
billion by 2027 farmers are embracing

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:54,399
technology like never before eager to

23
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:56,359
harness its power from sensors that

00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:01,920
is here

27
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,600
imagine a world where your farm tells

28
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:09,040
you what it needs even before the first

29
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,840

Trove of data but raw data is useless

93
00:03:39,319 --> 00:03:44,799
unless we can understand it that's where

94
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,120
data analytics comes in by crunching

95
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:49,760

analytics unlocks the secrets hidden

97
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,760
within the data farmers can see Trends

98
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:56,400
in their yields identify factors

99
00:03:54,760 --> 00:03:58,280
affecting crop health and make
