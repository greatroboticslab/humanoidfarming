00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,280
This video focuses on general safety

2
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:14,080
practices for operating farm loaders and

3
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,320
skid steer loaders. Tractor rollovers

4
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:18,640
are the primary cause of farm accidental

5
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,000
deaths and many of the rollovers occur

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,279
when operating tractors with loader

7
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,439
attachments. Rollovers can occur when

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,480
the bucket strikes an obstruction such

9
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,560
as a truck box or embankment. Operating

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,200
loaders with the bucket up also

11
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,559
increases the risk of

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,559
rollovers. The most important way to

13
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,120
prevent serious accidents with loaders

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:43,360
and skid steer loaders is to equip them

15
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,120
with rollover protection devices or ROS

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,360
and make sure you don't exceed the

17
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:50,320
maximum load limits as described in

18
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:52,559
operator's manuals. Be sure the tire

19
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,760
spacing and rear ballast is correct

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,760
before using a loader. Always wear a

21
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:01,199
seat belt when operating a tractor and

22
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:01,199
loader or skid steer

23
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:06,560
loader. Loaders overturn easier if the

24
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:09,080
bucket is raised too high when loaded,

25
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,360
especially when turning or on uneven

26
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,439
surfaces. Understand that the center of

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,920
gravity with the load changes with the

28
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,920
load in different positions. The center

29
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,400
of gravity of a load lifted high

30
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:22,560
increases the likelihood of a rollover.

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:25,200
A topheavy condition can lead to a

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,280
backward or side overturn. The

33
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,759
likelihood of rollovers or tipping

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:33,439
increases if you raise and lower loads

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,520
too fast and or change the lifting rate.

36
00:01:33,439 --> 00:01:37,240
Always stop loaders gradually when

37
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,759
raising or lowering

38
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:42,240
loads. Be particularly careful when

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,400
lifting loads around people. Loads

40
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,040
falling on people are common causes of

41
00:01:44,400 --> 00:01:49,360
accidents with loaders. If you must move

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:53,040
loads around people, be sure to fasten

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,360
the loads with ropes, chains, or cables.

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,280
Turning uphill on a slope increases the

45
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,000
risk of overturns because the center of

46
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:01,360
gravity moves to the rear of the

47
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:03,600
implement. Turning too fast on a

48
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,680
downward slope may also cause an

49
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:08,640
overturn because the center of gravity

50
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,800
is transferred forward. While driving a

51
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
tractor and loader on public roads,

52
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,200
carry the loads close to the ground to

53
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:17,000
aid visibility and to keep the center of

54
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,200
gravity closer to the

55
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,000
ground. Allow for the additional

56
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
equipment length while

57
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:25,760
turning. Be careful to balance load so

58
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:28,560
the weight is evenly distributed and the

59
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,720
load is stable. Avoid carrying loads

60
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,560
wider than the tractor.

61
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,720
Use flashing warning lights and

62
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,760
slowmoving vehicle emblems on loader

63
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,360
tractors whenever operating on public

64
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:42,720
roads. And never operate a tractor with

65
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,879
a loader on public roads after dark. Do

66
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,879
not handle large round bales unless the

67
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,959
loader is equipped with an approved bail

68
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,400
handling

69
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:52,800
attachment. Using a regular front-end

70
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:54,560
loader to move bales poses a problem

71
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,120
because the bail can roll out of the

72
00:02:54,560 --> 00:03:00,000
bucket and down the loader arms onto the

73
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,920
operator. Do not lift round bales with

74
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,879
the standard loader unless you have

75
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:06,400
proper bail restraining

76
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,319
devices. Tractor rollover protective

77
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:11,440
structures are not intended to protect

78
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:13,959
against falling bales. Remember to keep

79
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,800
the bail as low as possible while

80
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:19,599
moving. Always engage the parking brake

81
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:21,760
or place the transmission in park. Lower

82
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,920
the loader to the ground. Shut off the

83
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:27,280
engine and remove the ignition key

84
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:29,760
before servicing loaders. Know and avoid

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,640
the pinch points and rotating parts

86
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:35,040
before doing maintenance on loaders. Do

87
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,360
not walk or perform any service under a

88
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,680
raised loader, bucket, or attachment

89
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:43,680
unless it is securely blocked or held in

90
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:47,120
position. Escaping hydraulic fluid can

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:49,519
penetrate skin causing serious injury.

92
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,280
Avoid the hazard of high-pressure fluids

93
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,920
by relieving pressure before

94
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,080
disconnecting hydraulic lines.

95
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,480
Tighten all connections before applying

96
00:03:56,080 --> 00:03:59,879
pressure. Search for leaks with a piece

97
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,560
of

98
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:04,959
cardboard. Following safety precautions

99
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:10,040
does take a little more time, but being

100
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,040
safe is your number one commodity.
