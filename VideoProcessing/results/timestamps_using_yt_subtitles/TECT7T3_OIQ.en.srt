1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:04,200
cilantro is a fantastic addition to your

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,359
garden but it can be a real challenge to

3
00:00:04,200 --> 00:00:08,679
grow I find Cilantro is a bit of a

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,040
contradiction it's a shortlived annual

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:13,599
herb that prefers colder temperatures

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,400
but it really is best in the kitchen in

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,160
the summer when it goes so well with all

8
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,880
the hot season crops it can be hard to

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:21,840
get plants established it's a bit

10
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:23,640
finicky and when the tomatoes are

11
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,039
finally ripe enough to make salsa the

12
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:29,119
cilantro is often all bolted and bitter

13
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,439
it's also best used fresh and it's hard

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:32,040
to preserve a surface plus if you

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,120
planted too much although I do have some

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,440
ideas for processing at the end of this

17
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:38,360
video so I'm going to talk about how we

18
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,440
plan ahead to have fresh plantable

19
00:00:38,360 --> 00:00:42,239
cilantro all year round including in the

20
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:43,559
winter and if you want to see more of

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,719
what we're doing in the restaurant

22
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:49,480
culinary Garden hit subscribe so first

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,480
things first the seed the cilantro seed

24
00:00:49,480 --> 00:00:53,399
is actually coriander seed which you

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,239
would recognize from your kitchen both

26
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:57,719
cilantro and coriander are used in

27
00:00:55,239 --> 00:00:59,399
Cuisines from all over the world but

28
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,600
they both have really different taste

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,960
profiles and flavors so we're just

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,720
talking about growing cilantro for the

31
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:07,280
leaves in this video so there's a lot of

32
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,600
different varieties of cilantro that you

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:12,080
might see when you're buying seed uh a

34
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,880
lot of them have to do with their bolt

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:17,360
tolerance so how slow bolting you'll see

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,720
listed on some of the labels um some of

37
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,840
it might have to do with the height or

38
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:24,119
the growth habit or The Taste uh but

39
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:26,479
really there's a few types I often have

40
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,720
planted Calypso which is slow to bolt

41
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,520
I've also just planted cilantro seeds

42
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,040
from the Shelf in my kitchen

43
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,960
it had pretty low germination rates but

44
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:37,040
it did work cilantro is definitely best

45
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:38,840
grown by direct seating it has a tap

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,720
rout so it really doesn't like being

47
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:42,920
transplanted and it'll undergo

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:44,640
transplant shock so that means when you

49
00:01:42,920 --> 00:01:47,360
put it into the ground it will just

50
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:50,119
basically stop growing or grow very very

51
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:53,680
very slowly last year I grew some in

52
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,000
soil blocks uh early on in the spring uh

53
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,880
this is the cilantro here so two rows of

54
00:01:56,000 --> 00:02:01,079
cilantro and every second Bunch this

55
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,960
Bunch was when I trans planted and then

56
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,399
this is what I seeded so at the same

57
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:09,000
time as I did this I also seeded little

58
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:11,520
clumps of cilantro and it's interesting

59
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:13,239
because this has hardly done anything

60
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,560
here's a transplanted Bunch here's a

61
00:02:13,239 --> 00:02:18,440
seated Bunch here's a transplanted Bunch

62
00:02:15,560 --> 00:02:20,519
so I would say uh transplanting them out

63
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:23,160
in early April which is like almost two

64
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,480
months ago now really made no difference

65
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,920
and waiting for them to come up from

66
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,400
seed probably would have been a better

67
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,319
bet so it wasn't really worth the extra

68
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,640
effort of growing the transplants and

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,400
then putting them in the garden it would

70
00:02:33,640 --> 00:02:36,959
have been better off just direct seeding

71
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:38,879
so that's what I'm going to do this year

72
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:42,200
you can plant cilantro in rows or in

73
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,599
clumps the seeds can be about 1 cmet

74
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:45,959
apart and they need to be lightly

75
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,200
covered because they need dark to

76
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,720
germinate but just lightly covered uh

77
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:51,920
you want to keep it well watered until

78
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:54,959
it germinates in a week or more and the

79
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:59,360
ideal germination temp is around 18 to

80
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,599
21° C so 65 to 70 fhe so you want to

81
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,080
start seating them around your last

82
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,879
frost State when the soil temps have

83
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,400
warmed up if you want to get a head

84
00:03:03,879 --> 00:03:08,200
start you could warm up the soil in a

85
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:10,120
bed by putting a piece of plastic over

86
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,319
it or some row cover even though

87
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,799
cilantro plants are cold hearty to get

88
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:17,360
the seeds to germinate it really wants a

89
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:19,560
fairly warm temperature soil that's

90
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:22,239
light well drained not wet pretty

91
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,840
standard for any herb or vegetable plant

92
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,239
uh and now the hard part is don't plant

93
00:03:24,840 --> 00:03:29,319
too many seeds at once this is a mistake

94
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,159
I've made year after year if if you're

95
00:03:29,319 --> 00:03:33,040
planting a rows maybe just think about

96
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:35,680
planting a quarter or a half of the row

97
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,519
space now and then plant another section

98
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:39,239
later so the reason you don't want to

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,000
plant all your cilantro at once is

100
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:43,280
because it's considered a short-lived

101
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:46,080
plant so it's going to bolt it's going

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,720
to produce flowers and then seeds and

103
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,720
then it's going to die when the days

104
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:52,079
start to get long in the summer and when

105
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,879
the temperatures are warm in the summer

106
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:55,360
this is programmed into the plant and

107
00:03:53,879 --> 00:03:57,079
once it starts to bolt there isn't

108
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:58,560
really anything you can do to change it

109
00:03:57,079 --> 00:04:00,560
the leaves really start to change

110
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,360
texture they go from sort of a thick

111
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:06,439
typical cilantro looking Leaf to sort of

112
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:08,560
thin and fern like and they often become

113
00:04:06,439 --> 00:04:12,319
bitter and there's not as much of it to

114
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:14,239
harvest either so if we look at a chart

115
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:15,959
to make sure that there's cilantro all

116
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:18,199
year so I'm going to start with the

117
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,239
seeding dates and then I'm going to

118
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:22,479
harvest around 6 weeks after planting

119
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:24,560
and then I'm going to expect to harvest

120
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,000
from these plants for about a month

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,280
before it bolts and I pull it out so you

122
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:32,560
can see if I decide to plant on May 1st

123
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:34,320
I'm going to harvest June 15th 6 weeks

124
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,320
away and then I'm going to pull it out

125
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:37,360
July

126
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,240
15th but then I've got my second

127
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,479
sucession coming so I've got some that I

128
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:43,560
planted June 1st I'm going to harvest

129
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:46,400
that July 15th which is when I'm pulling

130
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,479
the previous cilantro bed and then I've

131
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:51,120
got that till August 15th and then you

132
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:52,960
can see if I do it July 1st August 1st

133
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:55,440
I've got cilantro going right until the

134
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:56,880
frost and that's sort of an estimation

135
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,880
but it gives you an idea of the kind of

136
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:00,560
thing you can do uh I'm probably going

137
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,400
to plant cilantro actually every two

138
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,680
weeks instead of every month like is

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,880
demonstrated here but it gives you an

140
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:09,120
idea of um what kind of timing you want

141
00:05:07,880 --> 00:05:11,000
and where you want to put it in your

142
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:12,840
garden and you can put this in the same

143
00:05:11,000 --> 00:05:14,520
bed you can actually plant seeds among

144
00:05:12,840 --> 00:05:16,440
the plants that are already there that

145
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:17,840
you know you're going to pull out or you

146
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:19,880
can plant them in a different spot in

147
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,759
your garden what are other ways we can

148
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:24,440
keep cilantro plants happy and healthy

149
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,639
in the summer so one is pick where you

150
00:05:24,440 --> 00:05:29,039
plant them using the sunny beds in

151
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,919
Spring and then Shady in the summer so

152
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,919
early on I'm going to plant in the first

153
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,080
places that warm up where my heat leming

154
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,440
crops aren't ready to go yet cilantro is

155
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,639
great in the under story of taller

156
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:41,199
summer crops like beans or tomatoes or

157
00:05:39,639 --> 00:05:43,039
cucumbers that you might have growing up

158
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:44,560
vertical support so then you have some

159
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:47,120
bare soil underneath and you can put

160
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,720
clumps of cilantro we also seated this

161
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,840
cilantro it came up and it was growing

162
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:53,479
uh and I actually pulled out all the

163
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:55,000
spinach around it and left it here and

164
00:05:53,479 --> 00:05:56,919
planted the tomatoes among it because it

165
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:59,360
doesn't take up too much space Also

166
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,520
keeping the cilantro plants well watered

167
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:03,560
and mulch can keep the soil temperature

168
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,720
down and really the soil temperature is

169
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:07,880
as important as the air temperature so

170
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:09,319
if you can cool your soil then then that

171
00:06:07,880 --> 00:06:12,280
helps keep it from

172
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,240
bolting and cilantro will go right until

173
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:16,800
the end of the season it's Frost hearty

174
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:19,360
to below zero so I've had cilantro

175
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,560
plants that are frozen in the garden um

176
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:25,800
come back to life when the sun comes out

177
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,199
and light frosts um Can are fine for it

178
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,919
especially if it's covered with row

179
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,680
cover and another thing you can do about

180
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:33,840
bolting is can just leave some plants to

181
00:06:30,680 --> 00:06:36,080
bolt uh it's a beautiful flower that

182
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,080
attracts all kinds of beneficial insects

183
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,639
you can let the seeds go until they're

184
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,479
ready to harvest which will take

185
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:44,319
probably another month and then I

186
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,639
harvest the plant when about half the

187
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,360
seeds are dry pull it out of the garden

188
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:51,000
uh put it in a paper bag let it dry

189
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:53,120
completely I find it's hard to save

190
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:54,560
cilantro seeds because as you're letting

191
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:56,720
it dry on the plant they're dropping it

192
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:59,639
all over the garden and so you end up

193
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,520
with self-seed cilantro as well in the

194
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,680
the past we've had a lot of cilantro

195
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:06,560
self-seeding and it's always a good

196
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:08,840
indication of when it's ready to uh

197
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,720
germinate when the soil is warm enough

198
00:07:08,840 --> 00:07:12,199
when it's at its Optimum temperature so

199
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,800
you can let these volunteer seedlings

200
00:07:12,199 --> 00:07:15,560
come up they might not come up in the

201
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,479
right place but they'll come up at the

202
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:20,840
right time so maybe that's a signal for

203
00:07:17,479 --> 00:07:23,440
you to plant cilantro seeds or maybe

204
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,919
it's just uh a couple of cilantro plants

205
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:27,319
somewhere on the margins that you can

206
00:07:24,919 --> 00:07:29,360
just let go and harvest from I find it's

207
00:07:27,319 --> 00:07:31,680
not worth it to try and move Cilantros

208
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:33,120
that that are self-seeded in the garden

209
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:35,800
they don't like being transplanted like

210
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:37,160
I said so at that stage um either let

211
00:07:35,800 --> 00:07:39,160
them grow where they are or just pull

212
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:41,039
them up like weeds so when you're

213
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:42,800
harvesting you can cut the leaves you

214
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,800
can either just chop the whole plant

215
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,599
right to the ground uh and then let it

216
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
regrow it takes about two weeks to do

217
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:51,000
that you can also just selectively pick

218
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,360
leaves off of the plants if you have a

219
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,960
big clump of them that works really well

220
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:57,599
and and cilantro is best when it's a

221
00:07:55,960 --> 00:07:59,680
little bit bigger than this um and you

222
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,159
can harvest the leaves really easily and

223
00:07:59,680 --> 00:08:03,000
often I'll just pull it straight out of

224
00:08:01,159 --> 00:08:05,039
the ground and then keep that in the

225
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:07,199
fridge so that's an easier way than

226
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,879
cutting it I find it lasts longer

227
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,520
because it has this nice Tap Root on it

228
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,960
if you put that on like a piece of

229
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:16,120
moistened paper towel it'll actually um

230
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:18,400
stay perky and stay uh straight for a

231
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,440
couple days it'll maintain some of that

232
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:22,159
water or and when using in cooking you

233
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:23,599
can also use the stems they have the

234
00:08:22,159 --> 00:08:26,120
same flavor and they're pretty tender

235
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:29,240
and juicy so uh just chop the whole

236
00:08:26,120 --> 00:08:32,000
thing up and to preserve it it's a tough

237
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,519
one drying does not preserve the flavor

238
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:36,279
and I don't really find that freezing

239
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,959
does that well either um the best bet

240
00:08:36,279 --> 00:08:40,800
that we found is to blend it into salsa

241
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,039
verde or other sauces that can be Jarred

242
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:46,519
or Frozen uh flavors are integrated into

243
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,839
the sauces when they're made and then

244
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:52,040
it's in a form where it can stay tasty

245
00:08:48,839 --> 00:08:54,440
and delicious for many months so we make

246
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,200
uh salsa ver that we put in the freezer

247
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:59,279
we make salsa that we put in jars that

248
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,440
does take more processing time up front

249
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,800
and and it doesn't fill the Gap in the

250
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,839
one beautiful cilantro sprig that's

251
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,120
placed on a dish for garnish but that's

252
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:10,680
what micro greens are for so the other

253
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:14,079
thing that we do is we grow micr greine

254
00:09:10,680 --> 00:09:16,120
cilantro over the winter so I'm using a

255
00:09:14,079 --> 00:09:18,200
1020 tray here a shallow one for micro

256
00:09:16,120 --> 00:09:20,680
greens filling it with just a promix

257
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:23,920
potting soil uh and then I'm putting in

258
00:09:20,680 --> 00:09:26,320
this case it was 30 gram of cilantro

259
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,720
seed into a container soaked for 24

260
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:32,560
hours so then I spread those out on the

261
00:09:28,720 --> 00:09:34,079
promix and I cover it with a container

262
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,720
just another one just to exclude the

263
00:09:34,079 --> 00:09:37,880
light until it's germinated so I'm going

264
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:39,560
to check on this every day or so then

265
00:09:37,880 --> 00:09:40,959
once that done I'm going to pull it off

266
00:09:39,560 --> 00:09:42,920
and I'm going to put it under the lights

267
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,959
and you want to put it right up close to

268
00:09:42,920 --> 00:09:48,360
the lights that you have um maybe

269
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:50,519
propped up with another uh Bin and then

270
00:09:48,360 --> 00:09:52,720
let it grow I find it's not the fastest

271
00:09:50,519 --> 00:09:55,519
growing micr green compared to radishes

272
00:09:52,720 --> 00:09:57,880
or peas shs but uh it is delicious it

273
00:09:55,519 --> 00:10:00,640
has all of the cilantro flavor and all

274
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:03,040
of that beautiful cilantro look that is

275
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,680
um just really like iconic and really

276
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:08,680
nice on a chili or a noodle bowl that we

277
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:11,040
have on the menu so so thanks for
