1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,360
guys i'm confused third function

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,839
diverter

3
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,919
rear remote grapple-ready okay these are

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,480
common terms that kind of all apply

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,599
to the same type of remote that we're

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:13,040
going to talk about today

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:14,559
that's where the confusion lies right

8
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:16,160
there's so many names there's very

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:17,440
little standardization i'm going to give

10
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,119
you my take on it

11
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:20,800
it might not be your take but it's how

12
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:21,680
i'm going to explain it to you if we

13
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:23,600
have a conversation

14
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,439
i did a video recently about 15

15
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:27,519
attachments for a third function

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,880
several of the comments in that video

17
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:29,599
said i got it wrong and what a third

18
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:31,279
function is

19
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,760
and that's what i want to discuss today

20
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,840
is how do we interpret a third function

21
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:37,680
is there a standardized system or do we

22
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,600
kind of have to read between the lines

23
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:41,200
maybe visually see the machine that

24
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:42,719
we're looking to buy figure out what we

25
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,480
need to set up our equipment

26
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,000
and the position of it on the front in

27
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:47,920
the middle or the back

28
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,520
does any of it really even matter i'd

29
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:51,199
love to get your feedback so leave a

30
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:52,399
comment down below we can all help each

31
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:54,160
other and learn a little bit more

32
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,440
the goal is to get smarter every day so

33
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:56,399
if you like what you see here i'd love

on over to goodworxtractors.com

43
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,840
all right let's get to it

44
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:23,119
let's dissect this a little bit we are

45
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,320
talking about a function all right not

46
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:25,920
the third it could be the first

47
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,759
second the fourth to fifth but a

48
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,320
function in general on a hydraulic

49
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,159
system

50
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,240
could be called a circuit as well pretty

51
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,240
much any modern air attractor that has a

52
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,159
front-end loader is going to have

53
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,920
two hydraulic circuits so you'll have

54
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:39,600
two hoses down here with

55
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,040
corresponding outlets that are on your

56
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:42,799
machine that is going to be one

57
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720
hydraulic circuit it allows the flow to

58
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:45,119
go this way and maybe raise your loader

59
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:47,040
up

60
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,240
and then it allows the flow to come back

61
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,439
through the other hose the other

62
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,360
direction so that you can

63
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:53,280
lower your loader as well now if we work

64
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,079
our way up this next set of hoses is

65
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,159
going to be the second

66
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,759
function or the second hydraulic circuit

67
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,520
so if the flow goes

68
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
through the hose this way it's going to

69
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,960
allow you to curl the bucket back

70
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,479
if the flow comes back this direction

71
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:06,479
it's going to allow you to dump the

72
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,800
bucket now what you see here on top

73
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:11,120
is going to be that additional function

74
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:13,040
or this additional hydraulic circuit

75
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,599
so what that allows you to do is

76
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,160
maintain the first two circuits

77
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,680
add on a third function so if you have a

78
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:20,239
grapple connected to your front end

79
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
loader

80
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,920
not only can you raise and lower you can

81
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,120
curl and roll

82
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:29,440
you can also open and close and again

83
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,160
that's controlled by hydraulic flow

84
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,920
going

85
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:33,760
one direction or another direction

86
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:35,360
through those hoses so two hoses

87
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,200
kind of makes a circle or a loop and

88
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
allows that functionality to be complete

89
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,959
that circuit to be complete going both

90
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:43,120
directions so now that we have a basic

91
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,879
understanding of what a third hydraulic

92
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,480
circuit is let's explain the different

93
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,879
variations of what that is

94
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,800
primarily a third function versus a

95
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:51,360
diverter kit they're going to both give

96
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
you a

97
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,519
additional hydraulic circuit that third

98
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:56,400
circuit that you need to run something

99
00:02:55,519 --> 00:02:57,680
like a grapple

100
00:02:56,400 --> 00:02:59,920
however they're going to function

101
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:01,120
differently let's dive into that now now

102
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,120
i don't want you to pay too much

103
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,959
attention to the location

104
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,599
of these hoses the location of these

105
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:09,599
couplers the location of this third

106
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,319
circuit more importantly i want you to

107
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:14,720
understand that what's found on my 4066r

108
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:15,840
for example is going to be a third

109
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,159
function control

110
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,159
so this is a factory option you can get

111
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:22,080
after-market third functions as well

112
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,319
but this is going to be plumbed into

113
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,879
your traktor's hydraulic system in a way

114
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,360
that allows you to control not just the

115
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,920
first

116
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,360
and the second but the first second and

117
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,599
third hydraulic functions

118
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,760
all at the exact same time so you can

119
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,840
run hydraulic flow from your tractor

120
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:38,799
through all of those hoses all three of

121
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:40,799
those circuits

122
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:41,920
to raise and lower at the same time as

123
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:43,519
you curl and roll

124
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:45,440
and at the same time as you open and

125
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,799
close the grapple for example third

126
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:47,599
functions can be used for other

127
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,200
attachments

128
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:50,799
i'm not focusing on that we're just

129
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,439
focusing on functionality

130
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,519
now the other primary variation of that

131
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,319
third hydraulic circuit is known as a

132
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,239
diverter kit or a diverter valve so

133
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,840
instead of being able to use the first

134
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:04,159
circuit that second circuit

135
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,360
and the third circuit at the same time

136
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:07,439
you're going to t

137
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,040
in to those hoses into the fittings that

138
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:10,799
are part of that curl roll

139
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,400
function so you're going to tap into

140
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,319
that second hydraulic circuit

141
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:16,560
you're going to put in a diverter hence

142
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,280
the name which is essentially going to

143
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,359
have

144
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:20,560
a solenoid or a little valve on it so

145
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,680
it's going to send a

146
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,040
a signal to the solenoid solenoid

147
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:26,720
chris gives me garbage for that all the

148
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
time the point being you're going to get

149
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:30,160
an electrical circuit it's going to

150
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:32,320
divert the flow from your

151
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,440
curl roll function and as long as you

152
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,759
have that

153
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,280
redirection going on it's going to send

154
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,759
that hydraulic flow to

155
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:40,479
your third circuit to instead of curling

156
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,880
and rolling

157
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,199
you can then open and close so you are

158
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,160
diverting the flow from that second curl

159
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,919
roll function

160
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,080
to the third function of opening and

161
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:52,160
closing the grapple so as you can see

162
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:53,680
a diverter kit is a way to get that

163
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,000
third additional that third

164
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:56,800
hydraulic circuit however you just can't

165
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,280
use all

166
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,400
three circuits at the same time okay so

167
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:02,240
if you've made it this far

168
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,440
let's see if this next part confuses you

169
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:10,400
is a third function

170
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:11,840
and a rear remote the same thing

171
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,360
well i'm going to make the case that it

172
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,479
does not matter if it's on the front or

173
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,400
the back of your tractor

174
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
now before we get to that i need to

175
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,720
explain what we have going on here

176
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,720
because

177
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,880
if three functions just isn't enough for

178
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,240
you well get yourself 10 functions like

179
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:25,759
what i have right here

180
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:26,800
it might be a little bit overkill but i

181
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:27,280
want to go through it really quick

182
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:29,360
because

183
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,639
it gets kind of confusing and

184
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:31,919
intimidating now we're not going to

185
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:33,600
count the two functions that are up

186
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,440
front for the front end loader besides

187
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,199
that there's eight additional hydraulic

188
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:38,479
circuits that we could have back here

189
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,400
so right here you're gonna have your

190
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:42,240
third function these lines are actually

191
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,520
plumbed up with some soft hoses

192
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,520
going all the way up front to run the

193
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,759
grapple then you're gonna have

194
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,080
a fourth function down here and then

195
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:52,160
we've sacrificed our fifth function

196
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:53,919
and plugged it into this hydraulic

197
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:56,000
multiplier you see up top

198
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,840
this is going to give us six additional

199
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,639
functions you can see there's a couple

200
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:00,400
extra

201
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,080
circuits here or functions that are not

202
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:03,280
being used right now but we have the

203
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:05,039
ability to do so

204
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:06,319
if we should ever need it remember just

205
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
like the third function

206
00:06:06,319 --> 00:06:09,759
you need two quick couplers to complete

207
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:11,440
a hydraulic circuit

208
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,520
or a function whether it's the third

209
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:15,520
fourth fifth sixth seventh eighth

210
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,520
ninth or tenth i don't want you to think

211
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:18,639
that you can run ten hydraulic circuits

212
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:20,639
at one time because

213
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,400
compact tractors simply can't do that

214
00:06:20,639 --> 00:06:23,919
there's not that much hydraulic capacity

215
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,840
or flow rate to do so

216
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,680
and in fact controlling just two

217
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,120
functions like raising and lowering

218
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,039
and maybe curling and rolling at the

219
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,199
same time can be challenging enough

220
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,080
even for a semi experienced operator

221
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:36,240
like myself

222
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,759
trying to throw on a third function such

223
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:40,720
as opening and closing a grapple

224
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:41,680
while controlling those other two i'm

225
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:43,520
not very good at that

226
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:44,720
but just because you can't use six or

227
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:46,560
seven at the same time

228
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,240
doesn't mean that you don't need to have

229
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,240
six or seven or eight

230
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,919
circuits hooked up in my case and i'll

231
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:52,880
give you the quick rundown as i have it

232
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:54,560
set up right now

233
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,479
i have eight total functions connected

234
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,639
right now the first function will raise

235
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,319
and lower the front end loader

236
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,560
the second function will curl and roll a

237
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:04,160
bucket or a grapple in this case

238
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,759
the third function is going to open and

239
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,880
close the jaws of the grapple now the

240
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:09,039
fourth and the fifth are going to

241
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:10,800
control the top and tilt kit that i have

242
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,400
while the sixth seventh and eighth

243
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,080
function are going to control

244
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,560
the hydraulic chute rotation the

245
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,280
hydraulic deflector and the hydraulic

246
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:19,120
back drag

247
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:20,800
now fortunately i don't have to use all

248
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,720
of those circuits at the same time

249
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:25,840
because i don't have enough arms and i

250
00:07:22,720 --> 00:07:25,840
don't have enough brain power

251
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,880
most of these functions here are just

252
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:32,560
momentary knees but nobody wants to be

253
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,840
hopping on and off a tractor connecting

254
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:35,520
or disconnecting hoses

255
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:37,360
from one circuit to another circuit and

256
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:39,440
vice versa every time you need to do it

257
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,280
very inefficient so to control that big

258
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,199
shiny multiplier back there

259
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:45,120
i simply use this little switch panel

260
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,080
right here to select the circuit i want

261
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,720
to turn on

262
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:49,919
flip that button and then actuate it

263
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:51,280
with a lever

264
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,039
and then turn it back off so if you're

265
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:54,879
looking for an affordable way to add on

266
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:55,520
additional hydraulic capability to your

267
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:56,960
tractor

268
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,720
you need to check out these hydraulic

269
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,479
multipliers from summit hydraulics now

270
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:01,919
if this wasn't sweet enough by itself

271
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:03,759
it gets even sweeter when you can get

272
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:05,759
five percent off with code gwt

273
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,120
at summit hydraulics so a couple folks

274
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,120
took issue with a statement

275
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,599
or a general theme of a recent video i

276
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,000
did on 15 attachments that proved the

277
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:13,840
value

278
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:15,120
of the third function because i included

279
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:16,560
attachments that were mounted on the

280
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:18,240
back side of a tractor

281
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,840
not just mounted to your loader it was

282
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,560
their interpretation that a third

283
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:22,479
function

284
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:23,599
was ran right up front and something

285
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:25,680
connected up there

286
00:08:23,599 --> 00:08:27,199
and operated that way nothing to do with

287
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:28,720
the back side if you have this

288
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:29,520
additional function on the back side of

289
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:30,960
your tractor

290
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:32,719
that's called a rear remote and so

291
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:34,800
that's why this is so confusing because

292
00:08:32,719 --> 00:08:37,680
this john deere 4066r

293
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:39,360
i purchased it with a rear remote and a

294
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:41,599
third function which are the same exact

295
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,680
thing and in fact even inside the cab

296
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,200
right underneath the third function

297
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,040
control which is just a push button

298
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:48,880
right on my loader joystick

299
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:51,200
it's got a little roman numeral for

300
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
three right and when i received this

301
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:54,000
tractor

302
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,240
that third function terminated on the

303
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
back side of the machine right back here

304
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,279
it did not have these hoses plugged into

305
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,959
it and running up front

306
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
that's something i added on after the

307
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,480
fact but it was identified by john deere

308
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:06,480
as a third function

309
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,240
and the outlets terminated on the back

310
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,680
side of the tractor so if you're new to

311
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
the tractor world

312
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,440
welcome to the confusion you know i

313
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,120
think you just need to have a good

314
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:16,800
understanding of what that third

315
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,800
function capability can do

316
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:19,839
and realize there's a way to route that

317
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,680
functionality

318
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:22,880
towards the front of the tractor or on

319
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,959
the back side

320
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,880
but having that additional hydraulic

321
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:29,519
circuit that's the important part

322
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,680
so similar to the factory third function

323
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:34,560
that's on the 4066r

324
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,000
a diverter kit that's giving you that

325
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:38,320
third function or that third

326
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:39,920
circuit could be mounted up front it

327
00:09:38,320 --> 00:09:41,839
could also be mounted on the back side

328
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,440
the tractor does not care either way

329
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,920
because wherever you need

330
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,279
that additional hydraulic circuit you're

331
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:48,560
going to care about that so if you have

332
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:50,000
something mounted on the back side of

333
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,360
your tractor like a snow blower

334
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,440
that needs to have a hydraulic shoot

335
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,080
rotation that's where you want the third

336
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,680
function

337
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:57,760
or if you need it mounted up front to

338
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,680
have that third circuit up here

339
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,200
to control the grapple that's important

340
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,800
to you as the operator but a third

341
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,880
function in my opinion can be mounted on

342
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:06,240
the front can be mounted on the back

343
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,720
it doesn't really matter so part of a

344
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:11,360
diverter kit besides the hoses and the

345
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,959
solenoid and the lines that go up front

346
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:15,519
or maybe to the back is going to be

347
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,800
a new joystick that you get to control

348
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,720
that entire operation

349
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:20,800
so this new joystick is going to include

350
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,200
controls to operate that third function

351
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:23,040
or

352
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:24,640
in this case a diverter kit let's talk

353
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,320
about price you know you want to get

354
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:28,160
that additional hydraulic circuit on

355
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:29,360
your tractor on the front or the back

356
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,519
but you don't want to spend a lot of

357
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,320
money well a diverter kit might be the

358
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:33,760
way to go

359
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,360
typically you're going to spend 500 or

360
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:37,360
600 bucks maybe somewhere in that

361
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,040
ballpark to get a diverter kit

362
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
and get that additional circuit mounted

363
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:42,399
on your tractor however if you want to

364
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:44,320
get a factory third function like what

365
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,120
you see on my 4066r

366
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:48,800
you could spend possibly 2 000 maybe

367
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:50,560
even 2 500

368
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,000
if you get those grapple lines that run

369
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:53,680
all the way up front as well

370
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:55,360
so if you want to get the functionality

371
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:57,360
of the third circuit but you don't want

372
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:59,440
to spend thousands of dollars

373
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:00,640
on completing that process maybe a

374
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:02,880
summit diverter kit

375
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:04,560
could be the solution for you and like

376
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,399
that hydraulic multiplier you can get

377
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,480
five percent off with code gwt

378
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,000
you just go to summit hydraulics.com

379
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:11,760
there's a link right down below

380
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:13,839
do some shopping on there find the right

381
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,839
kit for you we've done a video on how to

382
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:17,519
install this kit we've also done a field

383
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,200
video of this as well so you can see it

384
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,640
in action out there picking up brush and

385
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:22,320
logs and other debris

386
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:23,600
with the work saver mini grapple this is

387
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:25,760
a really great combination for a

388
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
subcompact or smaller compacts as well

389
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,600
so my interpretation if i'm listing a

390
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,560
tractor for sale having a conversation

391
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:32,720
with the customer

392
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:34,079
i'm going to identify if it's a diverter

393
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:34,880
or if it's a third function i'm going to

394
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:37,360
let them know

395
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:38,240
but that does not mean that it's ran all

396
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,399
the way up front and

397
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,920
ready to plumb in a grapple right at the

398
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,920
end of the loader arms but if you do

399
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,200
have hoses or lines ran all the way up

400
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:47,519
front to the very

401
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:49,120
business end of your front end loader i

402
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:50,320
am going to go a step further and call

403
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,399
that grapple-ready

404
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:54,160
because you don't have to invest the

405
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:56,320
cost to run lines from the back of the

406
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,760
tractor all the way up front okay or

407
00:11:56,320 --> 00:11:59,440
from the midpoint all the way up front

408
00:11:57,760 --> 00:12:00,880
you already have those lines there so

409
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:02,720
that's an extra cost that you don't have

410
00:12:00,880 --> 00:12:03,040
to consider or worry about it's already

411
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:04,959
done

412
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:06,639
but if your third function your third

413
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:08,240
circuit your diverter

414
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:10,320
terminates on the back side of your

415
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,000
tractor all you need to do is just get

416
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:14,399
some soft hoses made up

417
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:16,160
plug them in back there route them all

418
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:17,680
the way up front to your loader

419
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,200
and you're ready to go the important

420
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:21,200
part is having that third

421
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:22,800
circuit on your tractor so maybe that

422
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:24,880
helps you maybe it doesn't

423
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,399
but for me when i'm looking for tractors

424
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:27,839
because that's what i do i buy used

425
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,839
tractors and i resell them

426
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:31,839
if i see something has that third

427
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,240
additional circuit whether it's a true

428
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:34,959
factory third function or a diverter kit

429
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:37,279
to me

430
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,240
in my opinion having that third circuit

431
00:12:37,279 --> 00:12:40,320
of some kind

432
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:42,000
on your tractor that's the valuable part

433
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:43,680
that's going to open up the versatility

434
00:12:42,000 --> 00:12:45,519
and make it more appealing to future

435
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:47,200
customers like yourself and really the

436
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,760
other big takeaway for me

437
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:51,440
is the fact that with compact tractors

438
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,000
in general they have a pretty limited

439
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:54,079
flow rate

440
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,519
for hydraulics so it's really

441
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,360
challenging to run

442
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:59,279
three functions at one time let alone

443
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:01,680
two functions at one time because

444
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:04,079
there's simply not the hydraulic flow

445
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,680
and the mental capacity at least for me

446
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,519
to operate all those smoothly and

447
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:09,120
succinctly so investing that money into

448
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:11,360
a cheaper diverter kit

449
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,320
still allows me to get the job done but

450
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,160
at a lower cost

451
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,600
so i've given you my interpretation of

452
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,360
what a third function is

453
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:18,720
but now it's time to hear yours so leave
