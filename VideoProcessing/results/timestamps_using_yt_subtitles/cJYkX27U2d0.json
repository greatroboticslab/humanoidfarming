  "text": "[Music] hey it's Matt from McGee farms and got a couple Amazon packages in this week and was going to open them up kind of uh show them off a little bit and then as we get them set up kind of show you how they work out uh ordered these the other day you know we've got our new pfal pin that we're setting up and also we got our chicken house and I was looking in to try to get some kind of a solar lighting set up and uh I'd seen these a buddy of mine actually got these and I'll put a link to them uh on the on the notes for the description for the for this video but uh they're small solar lights they've got a little thing to hang a buddy of mine uses these in his tent sometimes and he's had real good luck with them they're cheap so I figure well why not try them out so opening them up looking through like I said the lights look pretty uh pretty nice kind of impressed with them the only thing I'm not overly crazy about is the solar panel doesn't really have a way to mount it it looks like uh I don't know if this is like a sticky thing where you just kind of peel and stick I don't know how well you know that's really going to hold up over time but again these were super cheap so you know if if they don't work out I'm not out that much money but you just have a small solar panel hook up with a uh uh looks like a c connector maybe uh like a phone C connector and it came as a two pack so I ended up with with two of them two of these and two little remote controls I don't know how uh how much I'm going to be using the remote controls I've got some other solar lights at the house with the remote control and I don't think I've ever put batteries in it but I don't know maybe this might be nice for uh you know setting them up and if I want to turn them on or off from the house it does have a setting on here though for where it'll be super bright for 30 minutes not quite so bright for 2 hours all the way out to like an 8 hour setting and my thinking is uh twofold one as far as uh leaving some lights on it'll maybe help them uh you know if we have Predator problems I'm working on the Predator problems right now uh and hopefully uh by the time they become a problem next spring they won't be a problem but also as we get into where they're not laying as many eggs because of the uh the less daylight you know this might be a way if uh we're wanting more eggs we can do that so I'm going to get these set up today and I will uh make a video once we get them in there and kind of show you how they're working and then after I'm sure it's going to take all day to charge them but if they're working at night we'll go out and take a look at how they're working tonight it's Matt with McGee farms hope you enjoyed this video hope you enjoy all the videos if you like it please consider giving us a thumbs up down there at the bottom leaving some comments or subscribing to the channel it's always appreciated and it helps Channel till next time have a great day",
