  "text": "I'm Mike MC from coltech energy uh our company has been involved in developing gasification projects since uh 2000 uh in 2003 we installed our first system um and since then have gone through a almost a continual upgrade of Technologies uh probably the most in most widely known system that we've installed was in 2007 at fry poultry uh if anyone has seen Dr Layman's video aise of biochar or read his book that unit is is shown in in both of those uh both of those articles um what you see on the screen is the latest of our of our systems U this is kind of a generation four the first three units or the first three systems were were wood based biochars I mean they were developed gas fires they were developed to process wood and we modified them to to handle manur or more difficult fuels um after coming to the conclusion that that biochar was a was an important piece of the economics of of any project going forward uh we set out and and designed a system that was specifically designed to handle manures and some of the more difficult fuels and also produce a consistent quality biochar uh this unit pictured was installed in late 2012 in Ohio it's on a farm that houses approximately 4,500 cows and this unit can process approximately 50 tons a day of calor um at that facility they are they're bringing manure and a combination of manure and bedding uh into a dedicated manure Barn between 35 and 50,000 tons a year uh we are taking that material and drying it in a rotary dryer to produce both animal bedding and produce fuel for the gasifier and then we are putting Cal or dried to 20 to 25% moisture into the system producing the energy to to operate the dryer and producing a consistent quality biochar now gasification is a thermal process reacting carbon based fuels in an oxygen starved environment typically the sh gas produced in the gasifier is then combusted in a thermal oxidizer um you know there are there are systems out there that are taking S gas and firing it directly in a reciprocating engine but they're operating with um processed wood they're operating with a more consistent fuel manure manure is not a consistent fuel the composition varies and so the S gas varies so it becomes very problematic to try to to utilize the S gas directly um we just add add enough air and combust it in a thermal oxidizer and then utilize the Heat the product of gasification is is heat and biochar unlike paralysis paralysis they also produce an oil and and we do not we just we just produce a hot air product and and a solid solid product form of biochar our unit is a fixed bed gasifier we do not have a fluidized bed the material sits flat on the on the floor of the unit we inter ruce a controlled amount of air in a controlled Zone inside the gasifier to provide the oxygen star environment typically we are producing mostly carbon monoxide inside the gas fire and it's when we add air in the in the thermal oxidizer then we're converting carbon monoxide to carbon dioxide and inside the gas viral our temperatures in in the air inside the gasar typically range between a th000 and 1500 degrees F the the feed rates and the biochar removal rates inside the gas fire are controlled through variable frequency drives so that allows us to control not only the the input and so control the throughput of the material but because the the feed of the of the the feed rate of the raw material is independent from the feed of the bio Char coming out of the machine so it gives us the ability to control the retention time of the biochar so we can impact the biochar quality as well as in as control the throughput and the energy output we also have the our air fans are on fre variable frequency drives so they also can be modulated to VAR the frut and energy output and you know the one of the the keys to being able to control the amount of air in addition to uh starving it for oxygen the minimal amount of air inside the gas fire also allows us to control particulate carryover so it it gives us a cleaner emission stream biochar is the carbon Rich product obtained when biomass is heated in in a closed container either oxygen starred or oxygen free either gasification or paralysis gasification produces a mineral that a material that contains mineral ash from the feed stock as well as the the fixed carbon and which will be in the form of a carbon Char and then this this carbon is transformed into a very absorbent material that has charged particles which attracts nutrients and moisture and the the ability of this carbon changes dramatically with the different minerals that are that are as they part of the the biochar itself um biomass materials contain carbon two forms it's either in in the form of fixed carbon or B of matter and what we do is we react the carbon in the volatile matter which creates the energy and then try to leave as much of the fixed carbon behind in a biochar um typically volatiles start acting at around 400\u00b0 and fixed carbon is usually closer to to 1,400 so it's a i it's a very temperature driven process due to the high temperatures and retention time biochar from Maneuvers are free from pathogen ecoli growth hormones and residues for medication so it it provides an outlet for for a processed product coming out of manur that that otherwise Farmers don't have have the outlet for typically wood has between 2 to 5% mineral asash and 20 to 25% fixed carbon so when you're producing biochar from wood uh you're going to have a very high carbon content if if you retain all the fixed carbon you're going to be as high as 80 90% of carbon in the biochar but wood has relatively few Nutri so you you have little nutrients in the biochar it is predominantly just Carbon on the other hand when we gasify manures typically the manures will be anywhere between 15 to 30% mineral Ash and between six to 18% fixed carbon so our biochar will be about a 20 to 25% carbon product but the rest of that the the the mineral Ash that's contained in that biochar contains an array of of beneficial nutrients it's nitrogen phosphorus potassium calcium magnesium and and a lot of trace minerals that are that are beneficial both in soils and in feeds the composition of of manure biochar varies with the animal type and diet and the levels of the various nutrients change but their benefits do not um for example poultry biochar will have a high percentage of calcium nitrogen phosphorus and potassium egg layer biochar will be extremely high in calcium due to the amount of calcium they feed the birds to produce strong eggshells calet or biochar will have a higher level of of magnesium and we're doing a lot of work with um solid separation systems with both swine and calor uh to try to retain more of those nutrients in the solid fraction so we're even increasing the level of those nutrients when we're producing biochar from those products but but these nutrients all provide different benefits uh whether it's in the soil whether it's uh heavy metal capture um the different nutrients all have different reactions so there's they provide different benefits so they provide different applications for the biochar and for biochars made from specific SE seed stocks based on those nutrients um was one of the slides that that Kurt had earlier there was mentioned designer biochar if you are producing biocharge from different manur or even manur and wood or agricultural debris uh you will have different qualities of biocharge just because of the feed stocks and it allows you to be able to to blend those biochars and and create designer biochars for specific needs the vast majority of biochars if you read through Publications and research are have been produced from wood um quite frankly because Wood's a very simple material to to gasify or pize mans can can present problems so most Technologies are designed for wood um biochar made mother fuels such as manur not only have a value as a biochar but also provide an environmental value as they provide a method of disposing materials that are creating issues um you know last year city of Toledo had green water for four days um you know the ches Bay has dead zones the Gulf of Mexico has dead zones and agriculture is not the only Factor but it it's a contrib ruting factor to to the algae blooms in all those areas and finding a an outlet for those manur other than land application gives us an opportunity to not only produce biochars which are beneficial environmentally but but eliminate some of the disposal issues that are creating environmental problems um you biochar has has applications in a wide array of uses whether it's so Amendment speed s complements water filtration soil remediation odor moisture control I mean it's it's amazing the the different characteristics it has and the different benefits it has in in in a variety of uses and then when you on top of that if you produce biochar from different feed stocks and end up with a different array of nutrients and different results then you even increase the range of opportunities and and effectiveness in my opinion in order to make a significant impact in the world biot must be produced in large volumes and and our relief is producing it with feed stock such as manur is a has a higher likelihood of success um because those feed stocks exist in large volumes and typically they're concentrated in in in specific regions um egg layers are in a certain area and daes are in certain areas and so they they have a a very high concentration of manures in those areas and so disposal is is a bigger and bigger issue every day um but from a project developers point of view biochar provides an even different value and that's economics waste energy projects have been developed for years and most of them are in the field somewhere rusting down uh they fail miserably or they have subsidies to to allow them to survive um because they are developed for the energy component alone the key to making these projects successful is multiple revenue streams just a very few and and we've seen a few but a very few can survive on single stream um biochar can provide a significant Revenue stream um not always can it carry a project by itself but as a as one of a one of a multiple of revenue streams it can make the economic strong enough to make a project profitable from a technical standpoint we don't believe developing these projects is is extremely difficult but raising the is uh and education and biochar is extremely critical because having a having the established value for biochar opens up a lot of funding opportunities and and getting sales getting sale prices uh is a is a key component to to making these projects successful um typical projects the unit that was pictured in the first slide that is our standard operating unit operating 247 it'll process between 15 and 20,000 tons of manure a year at an input moisture somewhere between 20 and 30% poultry uh groer manure bro litter turkey litter coming out of the barns they are in that moisture range so they can be directly input into the gas fire cow manure and Swine or require some drying um either as we're doing in Ohio just through a rotary dryer or the the very high moisture contents require some solid separation prior to drying systems handling w calure we can process 60 to 70,000 tons per year with a single gasifier so it gives you an idea of the the size of of those systems and and just rough numbers that equates to about a 5,000 Cal Dairy um biochar production with these systems will be between three and 5,000 tons a year um and that depends on the composition of the manure how how much Ash is in it and and how fresh it is and there's several variables but it will be in that range um and the use for the energy can vary anywhere from using the Heat to dry to heating buildings to producing steam producing power absorption chillers uh I mean we are producing hot air and virtually every energy application that's used starts off with a full of hot air so I mean there are readily available equipment that can be bed on the back end for for the energy application um you know in our experience almost every project is unique each customer has unique needs and conditions and but this system is very flexible and and when we develop projects they are tailored to the individual needs of the customer whether that's on the front end on their needs of getting rid of material or or processing material or on the back end for what they can use the energy for or or the biochar or additional byproducts such as such as animal betting um you know being able to produce a solid product like a biochar versus having a raw manure to handle or or even a digestate has huge environmental and economic benefits",
