my name is mr. butcher I teach

2
00:00:10,470 --> 00:00:15,210
agricultural practices here at kirinda

3
00:00:13,020 --> 00:00:17,040
State High School we are very lucky to

4
00:00:15,210 --> 00:00:19,170
be one of the few schools in Brisbane

5
00:00:17,040 --> 00:00:21,360
that has a working school agricultural

6
00:00:19,170 --> 00:00:23,460
section as well as having access to a

7
00:00:21,360 --> 00:00:25,800
large area of common land adjacent to

8
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,200
the school agricultural practices is a

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,350
very hands-on subject that touches on

10
00:00:28,200 --> 00:00:33,329
many areas of food and fiber production

11
00:00:30,350 --> 00:00:36,270
this includes beef cattle sheep goats

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:38,070
cropping and bees all the course does

13
00:00:36,270 --> 00:00:40,769
have a focus on the management practices

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:43,079
of these many different industries there

15
00:00:40,769 --> 00:00:45,269
are components of transferable skills

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:47,670
practical skills such as machinery

17
00:00:45,269 --> 00:00:49,739
operation and fencing construction that

18
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:52,199
are very useful in many different

19
00:00:49,739 --> 00:00:54,780
occupations the farm setting also comes

20
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:57,239
with its own unique challenges and

21
00:00:54,780 --> 00:00:59,940
agricultural practices is a great place

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:02,909
to learn 21st century problem-solving

23
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:05,280
skills in a real world context the last

24
00:01:02,909 --> 00:01:07,229
point I would make is that this subject

25
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,930
will provide you with fun and exciting

26
00:01:07,229 --> 00:01:12,750
opportunities to experience the real

27
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,880
Australia every week we work outside

28
00:01:12,750 --> 00:01:17,610
with our cattle at Oxley Creek common

29
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,640
which is our own little patch of the

30
00:01:17,610 --> 00:01:23,450
Australian bush in the city what a great

31
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,450
place to learn
