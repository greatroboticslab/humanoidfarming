you folks today we have just\ncompleted a blue-ribbon conference in Sioux City Iowa this conference\nrepresented businessmen civic leaders educators economists and research\nanalysts from 12 central Midwestern states the key States to the of the\nagricultural league economy for the United States it's my privilege today to\nhave the opportunity to interview some of the panelists and also a gentleman\nwho was an observer and a participant at this conference I'd like to introduce\nour guests at this time on my right is Walter Bowers retired economist from\nWashington DC who served in government from 1929 through 1944 he worked for the\nDepartment of Commerce the Department of Agriculture the Treasury Department the\nWar Department and he also has I believe degrees as a lawyer as an economist he's\nalso a geologist and he's now a Rasher and an abstract and runs an abstract\noffice in Yates Center Kansas and it's our privilege to have you with us today\nMr. Bowers sitting next to Mr. Bowers is correlates Wilken research analysts from\nWashington DC who was one of the featured speakers at the seminar\nmy extreme left is Mr. Harry Rash a banker from Thayer Kansas and also a\nmember of the agricultural committee of the independent Bankers Association of\nAmerica and were also with us today is Ray\nDykeman who was an income tax consultant and an independent insurance agent from\nGregory South Dakota at this time I would like to turn our attention to Mr.\nBowers Mr. Bowers also participated on the seminar he's been an acquaintance of\nmine now for the past two years and he brought out something at our conference\nthat I think should be brought to the attention of almost every American and\nMr. Bowers I wonder if you'd tell the folks at this time about their red\nschool houses and the little white churches well at this conference someone\nbrought up the point that no one had ever made a study any research study of\nthe importance of the single family unit on a small farm to the economy of\nAmerica talking about dropping the small family unit off of farms going to big\nfarms now what was the value of this small family unit well I say that there\nhas been a research project in progress in this particular agricultural area for\nthe last 100 years we had a group of people start moving into this rich\nMississippi Valley a hundred years ago and all it distinguished these people\nfrom any other people on earth was the fact that they were bringing with them\nlittle white churches and little red school houses a million of them settled\nin Nebraska before 1900 two million are settled in Kansas and half a million in\nNorth Dakota and half a million in South Dakota and Iowa and Missouri\nand Minnesota and the other states of this rich Mississippi Valley and they\nall had distinguished them from people of other parts of the earth was that\nthey had a certain devotion symbolized by little white churches and little red\nschool houses to the principles of the freedom that we have in our private\nenterprise system in the United States that has not followed anywhere else on\nearth and what happened we had an explosion in this Mississippi Valley\nthat are just as astounding as an explosion of an atom bomb in a hundred\nyears in this Mississippi Valley we have built the greatest breadbasket of all\nhistory the greatest corn belt the greatest wheat belt the greatest cattle\nbelt the greatest cotton belt of the entire earth right here in this\nMississippi Valley and not only on top of that we have produced some of the most\nbrilliant scientists of the entire earth there are more Nobel Prize winners great\nscientists have compliments agricultural States any other single spot on earth\nfrom the little red school houses little red school houses and little\nwhite churches they started from that background in other words that's been in\nyour estimation the key to the fantastic growth of the American society in our\neconomy it is demonstrated to the world what individual human personalities can\ndo with a proper individual education and with the proper spiritual values in\ntheir hearts and minds well thank you I'm sure we'll be back to you before the\nprogram is over at this time I'd like to turn to the other end of the table an\ninterview Mr. Harry Rash who has been very much concerned for a number of\nyears in agriculture and also the economy of estate in Kansas and the\nnation as well Mr. Rash you've spent considerable time\nand research you've also worked with the agricultural committee for the\nindependent bankers I'd like to have you briefly tell about your research and\nmake whatever statement or observations on our conference at this time well first I'd like to make a statement\nregarding the economy of Kansas in 1965 the farm production in Kansas had a\nvalue of a billion and a half dollars which was the third greatest on record\nstill they realize cash net income was a decrease from the previous year the\nrealized net cash income the proposition of trying to make people realize the\ndependence of the welfare of the entire economy of the state and the nation on\nthe price and production of agricultural products seems to be one of the hardest\ntasks that I ever ever saw kind accomplished at this conference it was\nbrought out the relationship of the agricultural production and price to the\nnational economy in Kansas for jobs out of ten are dependent upon agriculture I come from southeast Kansas a little\ntown of fair where I've lived all my life Neosho County I'm at present a\nmember of the southeast Kansas Regional Planning Commission appointed by\ngovernor of Kansas to make forecast for the future of our area I happen to be on\nthe Agricultural Commission because of my interest the forecasts of population\ntrends the records on the population in Kansas show that we've had a greater as\ngreat an out migration as we have of the new births in Kansas the a the age of\nthe farm population has- is over the 50 mark the rest of the nation I believe they\nsay the average age is 25 Harry can ask one question most industries the\nstrength from the growth of most industries is based on the number of\nyoung people that enter this specific business or industry and as a banker now\nwhat's the future of young people entering agriculture with the present\nprice structure from your observation they required investment is such that\nthe young person cannot enter agriculture that is a sad part\nthe farmers are actually telling their own sons that you shouldn't be entering\nagriculture that you have no future that you will be underpaid and overworked do\nyou think that the trends that were drifting towards is going to be the\nanswer the solution to agriculture in America a large type farm of the\ncorporate type form the the large type farm the corporate farm\ncannot answer the problem we have a need for more agricultural production in this\ncountry than we actually are producing the day of the so called surplus that's\na myth and a fantasy we are dependent upon meat imports now to sustain our\nneed for meat well Harry I'll get back to you again in\na minute at this time I'd like to call on a good friend from South Dakota Ray\nDykeman you've attended our conference here as an observer and you've also had\nan opportunity to participate I'd like to have you make whatever general\nstatements you have on mind and relationship to agriculture in South\nDakota and where South Dakota is headed unless we restore farm prices to balance\nwith wages and interest well I became interested in the agricultural program\nand the decline of rural America while I was attending the University of South\nDakota in college in 1958 and since that time I have been trying to discover what\nare some of the answers to the farm problem why did we not have enough farm\nincome to support the level of farming that they had when I was a boy because\nin the area that I grew up in south central South Dakota near Gregory South\nDakota there were a lot more farms when I was a boy than there are today so I\nwas trying to discover what the answers to this problem are and by attending\nthis conference I got a lot of the answers to why we've had this decline in\nrural America and what it will really mean if it continues take the period of\n1946 to 1950 70% of South Dakota's earned income- income came from agriculture\nso to the fact that underpayment of agriculture between 1951 the difference\nbetween 1951 and 1965 South Dakota lost one-nearly 1 billion dollars of earned\nincome and this is what I'm concerned about the amount of earned income South\nDakota is losing because agriculture is being underpaid today well now you had\nan opportunity to associate yourself with many of the other people who\nattended this conference from your observation what was their reaction to\nthe discussion that took place and tracing out of the balance sheet and the\nloss of income for the various states and also the condition of our national\neconomy what what did the other people think what was their observations in\nyour estimation the people that were in attendance at that seminar yes I think\nwe can just about say that there was 100% agreement that they all agreed that\nagriculture was being grossly underpaid and due to this underpayment we were not\nonly undermining agriculture but we are undermining the whole economic system in\nthe United States did it shock many of them to learn the\ncondition of our not only the state economy of their own state economy but\nthe national economy yes it did there was a much concern written on many of\nthe faces of the people there they knew there was a problem but they didn't know\nit was as bad as it is today well now one of the things that we did during\nthis seminar is we had the representatives of each state figure out\nthe actual loss of total- total personal income in 1965 and you mentioned that\nSouth Dakota lost approximately 1 billion dollars some of the other states\nMinnesota for instance lost two billion two hundred and seventy five million\nKansas I believe Harry was short approximately three billion was that\nright a little over three billion it was under that it was not a million three\nyeah about a billion three hundred and seventy five million Iowa's lost was roughly four billion\ndollars and the reason that the people in all these states were unaware of this\nloss of personal income is because they've never prepared a balance sheet\non their own state economy so they don't know where they've been\nwhere they're headed or whether at and at this time I'd like to turn our\nattention to Mr. Carl Wilken research analysts from Washington DC we call the\nfather of the balance sheet because he's been keeping these records on the\nnational economy for for many years and Mr. Wilken when did you first meet just\none minute be sure to make this point that this loss that we're talking about\nwas just for the year 1966 one year the loss in South Dakota was one nearly 1\nbillion dollars for the year 1965 the 1965 I think we better drive that one\nhome thank you for reminding me Carl when did you first when did you prepare\nyour first balance sheet and what induced you to make such a study and\nwhat's going to happen if the American people don't wake up and analyze the\nrecords of our economy well briefly in 1929 I was operating a farm about 80\nmiles southeast of Sioux City and The Economist said we were never going to\nhave a another depression 1932 I was selling corn for 10 cents a bushel\nwell they triple-a program didn't correct it so I was one of three men who\nsigned the Articles of Incorporation setting up the raw materials National\nCouncil and the that originated here in Sioux City correct and it's still\nincorporated right in Sioux City and when Barry County in 1941 I prepared my\nfirst balance sheet and as a result the city is the birthplace as we push the\nbalance sheet this is ever prepared and I've kept a balance sheet ever since\nthat time and as you know what the seminar I presented\nthat balance sheet 48-50 as a base and the 15 years which followed funded out\nthe audience how they could compute it and haven't checked well now I know that\nwhen the group worked out the lots of income for private enterprise for\nagriculture for the corporations and so forth yesterday they were stunned from\nmemory could you could you call it the the loss of national income and the loss\nto corporations and private enterprise during the past which ever period you'd\ncare to select well briefly in the 15 years following 48-50 we underpaid\nagriculture in terms of gross realized farm income three hundred and seventy\nand a half billion dollars now we have a trade turn of seven times the initial\ndollar farm income so what happened we lost seven times this ended payment or\nnewly earn dollars to operate our economy rough set be lost\nwe added eight hundred and eighty four billion dollars to the gross debt from\nstate local and private but in spite of this injection of 884 billion dollars in\nthe fifteen year period we were still short six hundred and twenty seven\nbillion dollars of national income over forty billion a year the balance with\nwages interest now then the question is who lost it well they down the chief\nproves it a private enterprise terms of net farm small business brought the\nprofits after taxes I'm sorry I didn't 97 billion the vet shortage of income\nthey a principal to 0 farm operator who were short two hundred and twenty two\nbillion the next principle losses are corporate profits was short 221\n211 billion after taxes comply me the small businessman was short 162 billion\nand I would like to point out that a large part of this loss that is a\ngreater proportional of it took place in our rural communities because the business\nsmall businessman in our urban areas they had the benefit of the terrific\nincrease in the payrolls that took place Carl I hope I have time to come back to\nyou but I'd like to ask Mr. Bowers another question\nI read your balance sheet on agriculture but yours is from a different aspect\nyou've written or prepared a balance sheet on production and I'd like to have\nyou comment on that what's your attitude about the large type commercial farms\nand so forth and is in your opinion is that going to work well agriculture has\na better balance sheet and we'll say the Iowa Public Service Company has for\nbetter balance sheet and the Missouri Pacific or the Illinois Central or\nNorthwestern railroads the the farmer has less debts and more assets than any\nother segment of our whole economic system but that isn't true on his\noperating statement his income and expense statement the farmer is not\nkidding as large return on his investment as the Interstate Commerce\nCommission allows the railroads and allows the utility power and light\ncompanies and so forth and as a result the farmer is working in the red so to\nspeak and the only way he shows in the black is the government subsidies that\nhe's getting from Washington the farmer before the average farm in America\nbefore his salary and before his taxes and before his new equipment and before\nhis paying his debts is only averaging three hundred and fifty dollars a month\nand the average farmer probably has an investment of $100,000 four or five\ntimes that of a service station manager and he should be earning six thousand a\nyear minimum after taxes well the farmers got the best balance\nsheet of the four basic segments of private enterprise the poorest the\noperating statement the poorest operating statement and I wasn't making\nenough money to hold on he's not making enough to support his family he's really\nin a depressed area so far this personal income the scripts right well now here\nis a bankers viewpoint you've heard Mr. Bowers say that agriculture has got the\nthe best balance sheet of any segment of our economy but would you agree that\neven so that the only way that agriculture can liquidate its depth is\nby liquidating itself for selling out that's what has been happening that is\nbeen done now we talks about we haven't had many farmers go bankrupt because\nthey see the handwriting on the wall and they've taken the step of voluntary\nliquidation to make the change but now this is a condition of agriculture and\nthey've got the best balance sheet better than the corporations or the\nsmall business and so forth as a banker what's your observation of the rest of\nthe economy then well of course we've been encouraged in deficit financing\nwe've been told that that is the way they get customers we've had the\nKeynesian theory that we increase our debts thereby we do more business\nand so we as we owe this debt to ourself it doesn't matter and we become\nprosperous it doesn't disappear does it no the debt doesn't disappear in other\nwords and the farmer has been staying in business by increasing his that though\nhe's been has been this inflation which has caused a markup in the real estate\nvalues which has enabled him to borrow more money on the basis of that\nso-called increase in real estate value and as a result of this this is what's\nbeen keeping our rural communities alive been keeping 'em going\nhas been this increasing bit Mr. Paulson in other words what were the point we're\ngetting at here that agriculture has a better balance but actually small\nbusiness in rural America is in worse shape than agriculture\nabsolutely absolutely that's the point I wanted to bring out and Carl you heard\nMr Bowers make the statement on the balance sheet of agriculture and I think\nwe'll agree that they've got a better financial statement than the\ncorporations and small business why don't you point out the seriousness of-\nthe seriousness of this well the simple facts are that agriculture in terms of\ngross farm income is receiving a 49 percent of what they call parity of\nincome but on the net basis and that farm income is only thirty three percent\nof a very uncommon for the farmer now the farmer if he didn't work long hours\nand work his family just couldn't stay on the farm he'd have to get up that's\nhow one of the things that has made it possible for him to stay there well that\nwe credited much of the efficiency in agriculture to the fact that they have\nthat they've been producing for half the income they should what do you mean by that \nwell in other words they say that the reason that agriculture doesn't deserve\na price anymore like they did back in the 30s is because they've become much\nmore efficient and they've increased their production through technology well\nthat's that's why they don't need the price\nwell that is what's been told to the American people but here's the fact in\n1946 they had a net income of fifteen billion dollars in 1966 it was sixteen\nbillion what in 1966 their operating costs were three billion dollars more\nthan all their income in 1946 Mr. Bowers in your estimation what is the biggest\nproblem in agriculture today well the biggest problem today is how to get farm\nincome to the same level on a parody was what\nthe farmer has to pay in consumer prices he's a buyer as well as a seller and\nwhile how does he restore his parity of income with a parity of income with\nother segments of the economy and my feeling is my little town it has a sales\nvolume of 5 million a year should have a sales volume of 10 million a year if\nthey could restore the income of the farmer to a parity of the people who\nproduce the goods that he buys what's going to happen if we don't restore the\nparity income of it well our little towns gonna disappear and that's why I\ncame to this conference I want to know how what we're gonna have to do to keep\nour in town from going out of the existence well what effect is this going to have\non the national economy if we don't restore well it means there'll be vast\nopen areas of agricultural country in this United States that will not be any\nlonger operated by this small individual family unit well thank you very much Mr.\nBowers I see we're running short on time would you agree Carl with what Mr. Bowers\nsaid what's the number one problem in agriculture today one of the number one\nproblem the only problem there's been in the history of United States and that's\nprice so what's the answer you should demand that Congress immediately restore\nthe 90% price support with an accurate clarity formula based on the consumer\nprice level and the record proves from 43 that 52 that this program works\neffectively and efficiently and the source of this information can be found\nin the 1962 economic report to Congress by President John F. Kennedy I want to\nmake a point that that needs to be based on the consumer price level that's the\ngoverning factor that tells the story of like preparing why don't you repeat he\nstatement once more Mr. Rash that we need 90 percent support prices based on\na parity price level governed by the consumer price level under the 1960\nunder the 1960 report the president's 1960 economic report would you agree\nwith these other two gentlemen that the biggest problem in agriculture today are\nthe only problem is price yes sir how about you\nRay well I certainly agree with this to Arnold\nbecause when farmers are being only paid half what they should get their only\nspending half of what they could spend in rural America and this is why my town\nif things aren't changed it's going to go down the drain just like Mr. Bowers'\ntown in well thank you gentlemen this is what we've been discussing at the\nBlue-Ribbon conference in Sioux City Iowa this past weekend and it was the\nunanimous agreement of all those that attended that the only problem that we\nhave in agriculture today is the price structure and that all of rural America\nis completely dependent on the gross income of Agriculture and if the farmers\ndon't get their proper share of the national income it's going to starve the\nrural communities and one way that we could restore prices to agriculture is\nthrough legislation such as Mr. Wilken and Mr. Bowers and the rest of the panel\nagreed however we've been trying this now for 15 years and it seems like\nCongress has lost sight of Agriculture and so this is what the National Farmers\nOrganization is attempting to do merely one thing to restore the proper price\nlevel to agriculture through collective bargaining thank you [music] us farm report has presented a look at\nagriculture and its effect on the economy with some of the nation's\noutstanding leaders members of the national farmers organization invites\nyou to tune in again next week at this time for more facts on agriculture and\nrural America which is the gear wheel in our economy that produces the majority\nof our nation's new wealth the farm income pattern sets the nation's\nprosperity and the national farmers organization represents new thinking and\na new generation of farmers [music]",
