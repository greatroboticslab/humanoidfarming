00:00:15,929 --> 00:00:21,570
things I'd like to do is thank all our

give them all welcome

25
00:01:35,060 --> 00:01:39,510
so Ruth said you've got just a little

26
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,370
bit of time to talk about a lot a lot of

27
00:01:39,510 --> 00:01:43,890
things we're gonna hit a few things real

28
00:01:41,370 --> 00:01:46,860
lightly today Dakota Lakes research

29
00:01:43,890 --> 00:01:49,800
farmers you probably know should know by

30
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:52,290
now is located east appear along

31
00:01:49,800 --> 00:01:54,810
Missouri River we have both irrigated

32
00:01:52,290 --> 00:01:57,180
and dryland stuff I went back through

33
00:01:54,810 --> 00:02:00,509
all the talks that I've done over the

34
00:01:57,180 --> 00:02:03,200
years here and and kind of looked at

35
00:02:00,509 --> 00:02:06,420
those and and I summarized those real

36
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:09,720
neatly if you're in this part of the

37
00:02:06,420 --> 00:02:11,730
world you want to take the eeet eeet is

38
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,760
of Apple transpiration you want all the

39
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:16,860
water to go through plants and and

40
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,500
there's every one of the speakers so far

41
00:02:16,860 --> 00:02:20,850
today has talked about the idea is to

42
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:23,880
get plants growing roots in the ground

43
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:27,690
those kind of things we want to match my

44
00:02:23,880 --> 00:02:29,000
snow catch that's one of the things we

45
00:02:27,690 --> 00:02:32,510
want to do we want to get some vertical

46
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:37,010
architecture up there you got to decide

47
00:02:32,510 --> 00:02:39,360
which information sources you can trust

48
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:40,950
there's a lot of people try to tell you

49
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:43,140
a lot of things especially when it comes

50
00:02:40,950 --> 00:02:44,430
to cover crops and stuff some of them

51
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,430
don't really know what they're talking

52
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:49,170
about so decide which one of those that

53
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:51,510
you can trust and this are listening to

54
00:02:49,170 --> 00:02:55,320
them address the problem stead of

55
00:02:51,510 --> 00:02:57,870
treating the symptom you know we we

56
00:02:55,320 --> 00:03:01,200
talked about water hemp John bee I'd

57
00:02:57,870 --> 00:03:02,760
just shortly go or the reason they got a

58
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,079
hot water hemp in the eastern part of

59
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,269
the United States they don't have enough

60
00:03:04,079 --> 00:03:08,280
diversity and they don't have enough

61
00:03:06,269 --> 00:03:09,930
cover and whatever so they have water

62
00:03:08,280 --> 00:03:12,420
hemp they have resistant weeds let's go

63
00:03:09,930 --> 00:03:14,700
back and fix it I always like to pick on

64
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:18,030
NRCS because they had you guys building

65
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,190
a lot of terraces terraces don't make

66
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,950
the water go in the ground so that water

67
00:03:20,190 --> 00:03:24,450
infiltration kit that they're handing

68
00:03:22,950 --> 00:03:25,890
out here that would have told you water

69
00:03:24,450 --> 00:03:27,450
doesn't go in the ground just putting a

70
00:03:25,890 --> 00:03:28,590
ditch up there to keep from running out

71
00:03:27,450 --> 00:03:31,140
of the field doesn't really make the

72
00:03:28,590 --> 00:03:32,640
crop grow better ideas make the water go

73
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:34,410
in the ground and no-till does that

74
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:37,650
cover crops can help us do that to a

75
00:03:34,410 --> 00:03:40,199
certain extent mother nature's an

76
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:42,030
opportunist if you have a problem you've

77
00:03:40,199 --> 00:03:44,370
created the opportunity

78
00:03:42,030 --> 00:03:46,890
so if you've got a weed or disease or an

79
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:48,420
insect or anything happening someplace

80
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:50,550
in the way you designed your system

81
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:52,770
you've created that opportunity because

82
00:03:50,550 --> 00:03:56,730
Mother Nature will come in and and fill

83
00:03:52,770 --> 00:03:58,530
that in I see Darrell's here so Darrell

84
00:03:56,730 --> 00:04:00,450
Dennehy is sitting back there but years

85
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:03,300
and years ago we were when they first

86
00:04:00,450 --> 00:04:05,340
came out with at that kind of time they

87
00:04:03,300 --> 00:04:08,220
called it Emmy corn pursuit tolerant

88
00:04:05,340 --> 00:04:09,510
corn and I had a young producer in Sioux

89
00:04:08,220 --> 00:04:11,820
Falls tell me don't have to worry about

90
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:13,530
crop rotation because I got pursuit corn

91
00:04:11,820 --> 00:04:15,380
and pursuit beans and I can just use

92
00:04:13,530 --> 00:04:17,820
pursuit and I won't have any reason any

93
00:04:15,380 --> 00:04:20,519
any problems and I said well you're

94
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:22,500
gonna have resistant weeds in Cyanamid

95
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:24,320
at the time took umbrage with me saying

96
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:26,610
that because there was no proof that

97
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:28,110
there was going to be resistant weeds I

98
00:04:26,610 --> 00:04:31,440
think also said they'd be cross

99
00:04:28,110 --> 00:04:33,540
resistance other ALS herbicides and they

100
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,280
wanted to retraction and all we did is

101
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:36,870
Leon and Darryl come out and put in a

102
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,240
trial for me and I went up to my

103
00:04:36,870 --> 00:04:41,160
neighbors and found some I don't know if

104
00:04:39,240 --> 00:04:44,070
you knew I went and done that found some

105
00:04:41,160 --> 00:04:46,650
found some glean tolerant kocha weeds

106
00:04:44,070 --> 00:04:52,050
and shook it around overtop of that

107
00:04:46,650 --> 00:04:54,030
trial and voila we had our proof stripes

108
00:04:52,050 --> 00:04:57,060
Bruce a crop which is healthy not a crop

109
00:04:54,030 --> 00:04:59,040
that does not get sick so remember that

110
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,620
too we we spent a lot of time trying to

111
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:03,630
treat things that are getting sick land

112
00:05:01,620 --> 00:05:06,030
we should really just be trying to make

113
00:05:03,630 --> 00:05:07,770
sure we we keep it healthy so that

114
00:05:06,030 --> 00:05:10,260
really takes a whole system and you guys

115
00:05:07,770 --> 00:05:11,820
have all seen that if you can oh and the

116
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,800
only one thing about a soil what

117
00:05:11,820 --> 00:05:16,229
parameter would you want to know and J

118
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,419
furie hit this a bit today I'm going to

119
00:05:16,229 --> 00:05:20,400
hit it harder within all textural groups

120
00:05:18,419 --> 00:05:21,960
as organic matter increased from one to

121
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:26,610
three percent available water holding

122
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:28,410
capacity doubled on organic matter

123
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,330
content increase to four percent have

124
00:05:28,410 --> 00:05:32,070
been accounted for more than 60% of

125
00:05:30,330 --> 00:05:33,120
available water holding capacity in the

126
00:05:32,070 --> 00:05:35,460
Red River Valley

127
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,200
they have salinity and water logging

128
00:05:35,460 --> 00:05:39,750
problems because their water doesn't

129
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:42,570
hold as much soil doesn't hold as much

130
00:05:39,750 --> 00:05:46,020
water as it should we have the same

131
00:05:42,570 --> 00:05:47,669
problem here our soils no longer hold as

132
00:05:46,020 --> 00:05:48,979
much water they used to hold this much

133
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:51,720
water

134
00:05:48,979 --> 00:05:53,849
now they'll hold this much water so when

135
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,660
we get a little bit of rain they're

136
00:05:53,849 --> 00:05:57,640
waterlogged then we get saline

137
00:05:55,660 --> 00:06:01,420
seats will get waterlogging whatever if

138
00:05:57,640 --> 00:06:04,420
we had deeper soils in terms of water

139
00:06:01,420 --> 00:06:09,040
holding capacity then we could hold more

140
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:12,730
water we wouldn't get wet waterlogged

141
00:06:09,040 --> 00:06:14,740
early we wouldn't get dry late and we

142
00:06:12,730 --> 00:06:17,860
wouldn't have as much problem with

143
00:06:14,740 --> 00:06:19,510
salinity when organic matter contents

144
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:21,220
increased four percent and then

145
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:24,490
accounted for more than 60% of the

146
00:06:21,220 --> 00:06:26,770
available water holding capacity when

147
00:06:24,490 --> 00:06:28,630
soil water storage capacity is low much

148
00:06:26,770 --> 00:06:31,290
of the rain that falls during extended

149
00:06:28,630 --> 00:06:33,810
periods of precipitation is lost in

150
00:06:31,290 --> 00:06:36,340
contrast highest water storage capacity

151
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:38,860
combined with effective capture of rain

152
00:06:36,340 --> 00:06:40,450
by making the water go on the ground and

153
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:42,520
snowmelt over the fall winter and spring

154
00:06:40,450 --> 00:06:46,030
can support a crop to extend the dry

155
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:48,160
periods and what we're trying to do with

156
00:06:46,030 --> 00:06:51,280
cover crops and they don't have as big a

157
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,870
fit here as they do in Illinois where

158
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:55,680
they have in Indiana where they have

159
00:06:52,870 --> 00:06:58,060
longer growing seasons and more rain but

160
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:01,060
we have opportunities here what we're

161
00:06:58,060 --> 00:07:02,650
trying to do is take these cool periods

162
00:07:01,060 --> 00:07:05,110
of these of the year or these odd

163
00:07:02,650 --> 00:07:07,510
periods of the year and build organic

164
00:07:05,110 --> 00:07:09,490
matter and suppress weeds and do some of

165
00:07:07,510 --> 00:07:12,100
those things and and we only do that

166
00:07:09,490 --> 00:07:13,960
when we have the opportunity short term

167
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:16,870
studies are not accurate and evaluating

168
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:18,610
treatments I was impressed that John was

169
00:07:16,870 --> 00:07:21,550
showing us 20-some years of treatments

170
00:07:18,610 --> 00:07:23,080
that's very very rare anymore and we do

171
00:07:21,550 --> 00:07:23,890
that at Dakota lakes but not very many

172
00:07:23,080 --> 00:07:27,669
people do that

173
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:29,440
a farmer manages ecosystems you take

174
00:07:27,669 --> 00:07:32,040
sunlight water and carbon dioxide and

175
00:07:29,440 --> 00:07:35,860
make them into products to be sold

176
00:07:32,040 --> 00:07:38,260
that's your business you're capturing

177
00:07:35,860 --> 00:07:39,940
sunlight and if you're only growing corn

178
00:07:38,260 --> 00:07:41,820
and soybeans you're capturing just a

179
00:07:39,940 --> 00:07:46,030
very small percentage of the sunlight

180
00:07:41,820 --> 00:07:48,040
every year let's capture more sunlight

181
00:07:46,030 --> 00:07:51,730
because what the energy from the

182
00:07:48,040 --> 00:07:53,560
sunlight that goes into the soil or

183
00:07:51,730 --> 00:07:56,770
whatever that's the stuff that drives

184
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:59,169
that whole ecosystem crop rotations

185
00:07:56,770 --> 00:08:01,600
allow for time for natural enemies to

186
00:07:59,169 --> 00:08:04,150
destroy the pathogen the one crop well

187
00:08:01,600 --> 00:08:05,680
unrelated crops are growing and we spend

188
00:08:04,150 --> 00:08:08,410
our whole career working on crop

189
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:09,220
rotation proper intensity adequate

190
00:08:08,410 --> 00:08:11,620
diversity

191
00:08:09,220 --> 00:08:14,110
and then we're stable in proper

192
00:08:11,620 --> 00:08:17,260
intensity is is matching that natural

193
00:08:14,110 --> 00:08:20,380
water cycle native vegetation is the

194
00:08:17,260 --> 00:08:22,090
best way to tell what you can do as I

195
00:08:20,380 --> 00:08:25,090
travel around the world the first thing

196
00:08:22,090 --> 00:08:29,050
I do is look at the native vegetation

197
00:08:25,090 --> 00:08:30,220
and Jake can tell you that that's one of

198
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:31,690
the things he does too

199
00:08:30,220 --> 00:08:36,330
right you look at the native vegetation

200
00:08:31,690 --> 00:08:39,789
that integrates the soil characteristics

201
00:08:36,330 --> 00:08:41,229
the climate including rainfall and

202
00:08:39,789 --> 00:08:42,729
temperatures and those kind of things

203
00:08:41,229 --> 00:08:46,030
that integrates them all into one

204
00:08:42,729 --> 00:08:50,070
package people weigh how much rainfall

205
00:08:46,030 --> 00:08:53,050
you get it's air out it's relative

206
00:08:50,070 --> 00:08:54,880
Amarillo Texas Pierre South Dakota and

207
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:58,240
Brandon Manitoba get exactly the same

208
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:01,750
rainfall Amarillo Texas is a desert

209
00:08:58,240 --> 00:09:03,580
Pierre South Dakota is a Prairie Brandon

210
00:09:01,750 --> 00:09:05,850
Manitoba is what they call a parkland

211
00:09:03,580 --> 00:09:08,520
which is trees and tall grass prairie

212
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:13,050
same amount of rainfall different

213
00:09:08,520 --> 00:09:17,320
temperatures different amounts of heat

214
00:09:13,050 --> 00:09:18,880
organic matter is important when we take

215
00:09:17,320 --> 00:09:20,380
off stuff somebody start talking about

216
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,360
hey today and that was about ready to go

217
00:09:20,380 --> 00:09:26,620
crazy in the back of the room if you

218
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:30,370
take off a 75 bushel a cur wheat crop or

219
00:09:26,620 --> 00:09:33,580
half of a 150 bushel acre corn crop you

220
00:09:30,370 --> 00:09:36,400
take off 100 pounds again I mean 50

221
00:09:33,580 --> 00:09:40,650
pounds and five pounds of P 100 pounds

222
00:09:36,400 --> 00:09:40,650
of K and three thousand pounds of carbon

223
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:52,030
your mining one unit train of soybeans

224
00:09:47,250 --> 00:09:55,240
these nice circle tracts 110 cars one

225
00:09:52,030 --> 00:09:59,350
unit training the soybeans has four

226
00:09:55,240 --> 00:10:02,410
hundred thousand pounds of phosphorus if

227
00:09:59,350 --> 00:10:05,170
we keep shipping that stuff out we're

228
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:09,940
mining because the Chinese aren't

229
00:10:05,170 --> 00:10:12,880
sending it back okay so in what happened

230
00:10:09,940 --> 00:10:15,640
do we do that for a hundred years we

231
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,230
won't have any soils left and JRE told

232
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,170
you and they don't have any soils left

233
00:10:17,230 --> 00:10:21,610
in the Red River Valley so they're

234
00:10:20,170 --> 00:10:23,119
putting in drain tile to get rid of that

235
00:10:21,610 --> 00:10:26,089
excess water so we can get

236
00:10:23,119 --> 00:10:32,179
Lake Winnipeg and screw-up Lake Winnipeg

237
00:10:26,089 --> 00:10:34,999
right matching water used to the climate

238
00:10:32,179 --> 00:10:39,469
and soils is imperative okay

239
00:10:34,999 --> 00:10:40,969
matching water use to what you have most

240
00:10:39,469 --> 00:10:42,799
of the plant growth problems blamed with

241
00:10:40,969 --> 00:10:45,649
no tillers other than adequate diversity

242
00:10:42,799 --> 00:10:48,619
and proper intensity or errors in

243
00:10:45,649 --> 00:10:49,969
technique no reason for errors in

244
00:10:48,619 --> 00:10:52,789
technique anymore we've got good

245
00:10:49,969 --> 00:10:55,849
equipment so let's get our diversity

246
00:10:52,789 --> 00:10:57,469
intensity rate in you an environment

247
00:10:55,849 --> 00:10:59,359
Sawgrass Prairie or wetter the goal

248
00:10:57,469 --> 00:11:02,379
should be to have something growing at

249
00:10:59,359 --> 00:11:04,519
all times that's this area in East

250
00:11:02,379 --> 00:11:08,329
should have something growing at all

251
00:11:04,519 --> 00:11:10,369
times that's going to require the use of

252
00:11:08,329 --> 00:11:12,529
cover crops or forage double crops

253
00:11:10,369 --> 00:11:15,639
because you can't really do two grain

254
00:11:12,529 --> 00:11:19,279
crops in a year there's not enough time

255
00:11:15,639 --> 00:11:21,469
okay subhuman semi-arid Pierre South

256
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:22,999
Dakota arid environments cover crops can

257
00:11:21,469 --> 00:11:24,769
be utilized to increase organic matter

258
00:11:22,999 --> 00:11:27,139
and biological activity we're going to

259
00:11:24,769 --> 00:11:31,099
use them less frequently because we

260
00:11:27,139 --> 00:11:33,049
don't have the moisture cover crops are

261
00:11:31,099 --> 00:11:34,879
like tillage in wet environments more

262
00:11:33,049 --> 00:11:38,119
and longer covered forage periods are

263
00:11:34,879 --> 00:11:40,759
needed in drier environments residue

264
00:11:38,119 --> 00:11:43,549
loss can be an issue if the wrong

265
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:46,209
species are chosen lots of emphasis on

266
00:11:43,549 --> 00:11:49,639
some people using radishes turnips and

267
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:52,549
and and rapeseed and those kind of

268
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,979
things those are brassicas they get rid

269
00:11:52,549 --> 00:11:57,949
of residue you're going to be to bear to

270
00:11:54,979 --> 00:12:00,589
fast as you get drier you got to really

271
00:11:57,949 --> 00:12:04,009
limit how many of those you put in there

272
00:12:00,589 --> 00:12:07,279
okay number one decide what you want to

273
00:12:04,009 --> 00:12:10,009
do before trying to choose a cover crop

274
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:13,339
John said this you know he said it

275
00:12:10,009 --> 00:12:15,499
several times guy right for me I wanted

276
00:12:13,339 --> 00:12:19,219
I want to tell you that John Pike seed

277
00:12:15,499 --> 00:12:19,509
company that family seed company went

278
00:12:19,219 --> 00:12:22,099
away

279
00:12:19,509 --> 00:12:24,549
the back seed company he mentioned is

280
00:12:22,099 --> 00:12:24,549
still there

281
00:12:26,249 --> 00:12:30,369
no damn relatives of mine mine all got

282
00:12:28,929 --> 00:12:33,389
hung for horse Steven but I thought I

283
00:12:30,369 --> 00:12:33,389
should throw that in there

284
00:12:35,399 --> 00:12:39,910
think of your cover crop of just another

285
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:42,579
component of your rotation it's not

286
00:12:39,910 --> 00:12:45,489
separate you got to know what you're

287
00:12:42,579 --> 00:12:47,079
gonna do right using a mixture of cover

288
00:12:45,489 --> 00:12:50,410
crops allows meeting several goals

289
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:52,269
simultaneously mixers add more diversity

290
00:12:50,410 --> 00:12:54,910
grow at different times better compete

291
00:12:52,269 --> 00:13:00,009
with weeds optimize nutrient cycling etc

292
00:12:54,910 --> 00:13:03,879
but be careful not to bridge diseases or

293
00:13:00,009 --> 00:13:06,579
insects choose your mix carefully got a

294
00:13:03,879 --> 00:13:08,589
call from a major cover crop seed

295
00:13:06,579 --> 00:13:12,249
suppliers and one of my growers said

296
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:13,839
that his soybeans behind cover crop did

297
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,179
not yield as good as his soybeans where

298
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,600
he didn't have a cover crop because he

299
00:13:16,179 --> 00:13:21,459
had fight tatra I said what did you have

300
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,399
in the cover crop map so who have just

301
00:13:21,459 --> 00:13:28,869
our normal 12 Way mix as well give me

302
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:33,759
here's a list soybeans we're in that

303
00:13:28,869 --> 00:13:37,350
list ah don't do that but now in the old

304
00:13:33,759 --> 00:13:40,720
days the Jim River Valley here in north

305
00:13:37,350 --> 00:13:45,459
when when guys were gonna grow soybeans

306
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:49,299
for the first time 25 30 years ago 25

307
00:13:45,459 --> 00:13:52,660
years ago or more I'd say okay go after

308
00:13:49,299 --> 00:13:55,720
wheat and plant some soybeans as a cover

309
00:13:52,660 --> 00:13:57,879
crop after the wheat before you put the

310
00:13:55,720 --> 00:14:01,829
soybeans in the next spring because you

311
00:13:57,879 --> 00:14:04,449
need to prime that right so be a pump

312
00:14:01,829 --> 00:14:06,610
get some rhizobian ocula out there

313
00:14:04,449 --> 00:14:08,759
otherwise you'll never be as good that's

314
00:14:06,610 --> 00:14:11,110
first time don't do that again for again

315
00:14:08,759 --> 00:14:15,069
okay so think about what you're trying

316
00:14:11,110 --> 00:14:18,639
to do creating conditions beneficial for

317
00:14:15,069 --> 00:14:21,189
the next crop is one of the goals water

318
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:24,220
and nutrient management another primary

319
00:14:21,189 --> 00:14:25,839
goal water use by a cover crop during

320
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:27,100
the nine crop period can often be

321
00:14:25,839 --> 00:14:29,980
regained during the growing season

322
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:32,860
because of better infiltration reduce

323
00:14:29,980 --> 00:14:35,939
runoff improve water relations more

324
00:14:32,860 --> 00:14:38,510
cover more cover if you do it right

325
00:14:35,939 --> 00:14:40,850
remember I talked about the brass

326
00:14:38,510 --> 00:14:44,720
here's the thing that Jason Miller and I

327
00:14:40,850 --> 00:14:46,820
did I had a this is back in 2008 I had a

328
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,820
winter wheat cornfield P rotation

329
00:14:46,820 --> 00:14:53,480
there's a wheat stubble no cover crop

330
00:14:48,820 --> 00:14:58,640
this is on the 9th of July we still had

331
00:14:53,480 --> 00:15:08,630
this total cover to stop the e from the

332
00:14:58,640 --> 00:15:09,230
soil back up back up here's right next

333
00:15:08,630 --> 00:15:11,510
to it

334
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,540
we had a rotation had actually more

335
00:15:11,510 --> 00:15:16,850
cover spring lee winter wheat corn but

336
00:15:14,540 --> 00:15:20,960
we put a Braska cover crop in there

337
00:15:16,850 --> 00:15:24,980
it's almost bare I think it was about 20

338
00:15:20,960 --> 00:15:32,300
bushel difference because we lost the

339
00:15:24,980 --> 00:15:35,060
residue ok understand your rainfall

340
00:15:32,300 --> 00:15:37,910
patterns for your area and the water

341
00:15:35,060 --> 00:15:39,890
holding capacity of your soils in order

342
00:15:37,910 --> 00:15:43,100
to plan how you're going to do this and

343
00:15:39,890 --> 00:15:49,040
use web soil survey here's one of my

344
00:15:43,100 --> 00:15:51,010
soils we farmed some West River stuff we

345
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:54,590
got Jim Finley used to be one of my

346
00:15:51,010 --> 00:16:00,530
board guys he can tell you about that we

347
00:15:54,590 --> 00:16:03,350
if I take a web soil survey there is my

348
00:16:00,530 --> 00:16:06,050
north unit ok this is five miles north

349
00:16:03,350 --> 00:16:08,390
of the farm this is a promised soil in

350
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:11,420
opal soil the glacier went around here

351
00:16:08,390 --> 00:16:14,570
this is the old ocean bottom this is a

352
00:16:11,420 --> 00:16:18,350
West River pure shale derived soil that

353
00:16:14,570 --> 00:16:21,920
field right here is Jimmy corals bucking

354
00:16:18,350 --> 00:16:24,230
horse pasture you really never have

355
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:24,800
lived until you have a rodeo contractor

356
00:16:24,230 --> 00:16:31,190
as a neighbor

357
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:34,810
ok comes Cadillac windows down goes see

358
00:16:31,190 --> 00:16:37,080
any horses yep

359
00:16:34,810 --> 00:16:41,100
how many

360
00:16:37,080 --> 00:16:44,190
about 120 how long ago

361
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:47,269
Oh about an hour-and-a-half hmm weird to

362
00:16:44,190 --> 00:16:47,269
go that way

363
00:16:48,170 --> 00:16:56,670
Thanks so what this means is this you

364
00:16:54,990 --> 00:16:58,290
can get all kinds of stuff off web soil

365
00:16:56,670 --> 00:17:00,870
survey and if you don't know how to use

366
00:16:58,290 --> 00:17:02,550
that you need to get it and get an app

367
00:17:00,870 --> 00:17:04,110
on your phone I can tell you what's oil

368
00:17:02,550 --> 00:17:08,370
used to be here before they built a

369
00:17:04,110 --> 00:17:11,360
building talk to your NRCS people what

370
00:17:08,370 --> 00:17:14,250
this says is this somewhere between five

371
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:18,780
no three and six and a half inches of

372
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:21,569
total available water on this spot that

373
00:17:18,780 --> 00:17:25,470
heavy soil does not hold very much

374
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:27,420
available water I manage that soil is

375
00:17:25,470 --> 00:17:29,309
very heavy clay I manage that much

376
00:17:27,420 --> 00:17:31,800
different than I do

377
00:17:29,309 --> 00:17:33,870
my main farm here's a little gate

378
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:36,620
glacial tongue that comes out there okay

379
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:40,860
that one holds about seven inches okay

380
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:44,100
these opals up in here hold less than

381
00:17:40,860 --> 00:17:49,380
three because they're only about this

382
00:17:44,100 --> 00:17:51,360
deep to shave here's the main farm

383
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:53,520
here's my good Lowery's right those are

384
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:54,960
more like you guys have you can see I

385
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:57,840
got some of the red ones and those and

386
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:02,130
whatever but these will hold about ten

387
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:05,730
inches a lot I managed that differently

388
00:18:02,130 --> 00:18:08,610
than something that holds five so once I

389
00:18:05,730 --> 00:18:12,360
know how much my bucket holds then I go

390
00:18:08,610 --> 00:18:16,290
get my rainfall this is Mitchell and

391
00:18:12,360 --> 00:18:17,910
I've got a I've got a I've got an Excel

392
00:18:16,290 --> 00:18:20,490
spreadsheet that'll do this for you got

393
00:18:17,910 --> 00:18:21,990
every rainfall from every station in the

394
00:18:20,490 --> 00:18:24,630
state of South Dakota and you can do

395
00:18:21,990 --> 00:18:26,309
this type of thing for you so I start

396
00:18:24,630 --> 00:18:28,860
from October to October and you'll

397
00:18:26,309 --> 00:18:32,790
precip Mitchell twenty two point zero

398
00:18:28,860 --> 00:18:34,320
six or eight six this is from a few

399
00:18:32,790 --> 00:18:36,750
years ago so now everybody's going well

400
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,440
we get more rainfall now okay well

401
00:18:36,750 --> 00:18:39,000
that's fine

402
00:18:37,440 --> 00:18:41,090
so we're going to look at what happens

403
00:18:39,000 --> 00:18:44,790
when you didn't get as much rainfall

404
00:18:41,090 --> 00:18:47,010
take the out of thee T from July to June

405
00:18:44,790 --> 00:18:49,970
from when you would harvest wheat until

406
00:18:47,010 --> 00:18:52,970
you would need water for your core

407
00:18:49,970 --> 00:18:57,340
corn defusing water before June you get

408
00:18:52,970 --> 00:18:57,340
nineteen point three four inches of rain

409
00:18:57,909 --> 00:19:08,600
how much is the soil hold seven ten

410
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,740
maybe twelve if it was totally dry when

411
00:19:08,600 --> 00:19:11,450
you harvested the wheat which it

412
00:19:09,740 --> 00:19:15,049
normally isn't totally dried to four

413
00:19:11,450 --> 00:19:16,879
feet when you harvested the wheat you

414
00:19:15,049 --> 00:19:18,740
hold ten or twelve you got trying to put

415
00:19:16,879 --> 00:19:21,620
19 inches of water in there and guys say

416
00:19:18,740 --> 00:19:24,559
I don't want a no-till hit too damn wet

417
00:19:21,620 --> 00:19:27,860
in the spring what a wonderful problem

418
00:19:24,559 --> 00:19:30,799
to have if you live in South Dakota hey

419
00:19:27,860 --> 00:19:35,330
come on so let's turn that into an

420
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:39,139
opportunity and that's where you have a

421
00:19:35,330 --> 00:19:42,710
chance to do something if you go wheat

422
00:19:39,139 --> 00:19:45,289
to sunflowers it's 22 inches but that's

423
00:19:42,710 --> 00:19:49,190
the type of you plant peas and grow

424
00:19:45,289 --> 00:19:52,279
wheat that yeah at 22 inches if I'm

425
00:19:49,190 --> 00:19:54,799
backing up one if you get half a normal

426
00:19:52,279 --> 00:19:58,519
which we seldom do it's still 9 inches

427
00:19:54,799 --> 00:20:00,500
almost 10 inches if you get half a

428
00:19:58,519 --> 00:20:02,090
normal and you keep taking the EIT 80

429
00:20:00,500 --> 00:20:03,590
and have it done tillage and you make

430
00:20:02,090 --> 00:20:04,669
the water go in the ground and do all

431
00:20:03,590 --> 00:20:07,639
those things you're supposed to do

432
00:20:04,669 --> 00:20:10,700
you're going to fill a soil up at half

433
00:20:07,639 --> 00:20:11,330
of normal so you're always going to be

434
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:15,350
too wet

435
00:20:11,330 --> 00:20:18,289
okay that's why you grow good weed after

436
00:20:15,350 --> 00:20:20,509
peas okay

437
00:20:18,289 --> 00:20:23,779
and from October to June 1st of October

438
00:20:20,509 --> 00:20:27,399
1st of June from corn to sunflowers 12.1

439
00:20:23,779 --> 00:20:27,399
you're still going to fill the soil up

440
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:37,220
if you've got good cover take the out

441
00:20:30,620 --> 00:20:39,529
eet that kind of stuff right so 1/2 a

442
00:20:37,220 --> 00:20:41,360
normal six point zero six when we first

443
00:20:39,529 --> 00:20:43,009
told guys at Gettysburg and Pierre they

444
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:47,539
should put their sunflowers into corn

445
00:20:43,009 --> 00:20:49,669
they thought it was stark raving mad now

446
00:20:47,539 --> 00:20:51,559
if you drive from Blount to Gettysburg

447
00:20:49,669 --> 00:20:54,789
they're all got their sunflowers in the

448
00:20:51,559 --> 00:20:58,279
corn because you got to do the numbers

449
00:20:54,789 --> 00:21:02,119
July to November this is your

450
00:20:58,279 --> 00:21:05,529
opportunity fall cover crop July to

451
00:21:02,119 --> 00:21:05,529
November 8.34

452
00:21:06,200 --> 00:21:16,200
that other one was 19 if you use that 8

453
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:19,200
you're still going to have enough to

454
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:21,330
fill that soil by the time corn needs it

455
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,630
if you're doing all the things we talked

456
00:21:21,330 --> 00:21:26,310
about and you keep the cover and you do

457
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:29,190
that kind of stuff right

458
00:21:26,310 --> 00:21:29,880
even in half a normal yet four that's

459
00:21:29,190 --> 00:21:31,800
enough

460
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:34,260
you can use that you'll see you're going

461
00:21:31,800 --> 00:21:37,170
to have enough to get your corn started

462
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:39,090
the next year July to September when you

463
00:21:37,170 --> 00:21:42,030
harvest your wheat to when you appease

464
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:44,190
it to where you do winter wheat there's

465
00:21:42,030 --> 00:21:47,460
not enough time there not enough water

466
00:21:44,190 --> 00:21:51,060
to try to do a cover crop on dry land we

467
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,970
will do this with irrigation the old

468
00:21:51,060 --> 00:21:59,640
long fallow you guys all look at me I

469
00:21:53,970 --> 00:22:01,710
grew up 60 miles from here we did long

470
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,770
fallow on a half section of ground

471
00:22:01,710 --> 00:22:08,700
because the landlord wanted that wheat

472
00:22:04,770 --> 00:22:12,330
Milo long fallow we had saline seeps

473
00:22:08,700 --> 00:22:16,200
god-awful mess in there and I had no

474
00:22:12,330 --> 00:22:18,210
idea when I got older and got a little

475
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:22,650
more educated I goat cheese thought it's

476
00:22:18,210 --> 00:22:24,090
stupid damn thing to do right now they

477
00:22:22,650 --> 00:22:27,720
farm it the way they should and they

478
00:22:24,090 --> 00:22:29,760
don't have the Saline seat problem cover

479
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:32,580
crop seeds need to be in expensive in

480
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:35,040
terms of cost per acre small seeds means

481
00:22:32,580 --> 00:22:38,190
less volume you know we we look on our

482
00:22:35,040 --> 00:22:40,350
shed but be careful to not do peas as

483
00:22:38,190 --> 00:22:42,000
cover crops of you doing peas someplace

484
00:22:40,350 --> 00:22:44,760
in the rotation you'd like to have about

485
00:22:42,000 --> 00:22:47,190
a six year break between pea crops to

486
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:48,270
not get root diseases or lentils some of

487
00:22:47,190 --> 00:22:50,970
these crops you've got to be careful

488
00:22:48,270 --> 00:22:54,300
with small seeds grow better on the

489
00:22:50,970 --> 00:22:56,280
surface and larger seeds large seeds

490
00:22:54,300 --> 00:22:58,680
emerge better through a matter residue

491
00:22:56,280 --> 00:23:01,230
mixing large and small seeds in the same

492
00:22:58,680 --> 00:23:04,200
trench helps the large seeds help the

493
00:23:01,230 --> 00:23:07,400
small seeds emerge better they kind of

494
00:23:04,200 --> 00:23:10,050
break the path using harrows to improve

495
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:13,040
the stand of surface pride cast seed

496
00:23:10,050 --> 00:23:16,140
improves the stand of weeds as well and

497
00:23:13,040 --> 00:23:17,910
it makes your residue go away right

498
00:23:16,140 --> 00:23:20,610
not not one of the things you like to do

499
00:23:17,910 --> 00:23:22,410
one important goal is to use it the

500
00:23:20,610 --> 00:23:24,780
cover crop to balance the diet of the

501
00:23:22,410 --> 00:23:28,410
soil organisms run elverson was asking

502
00:23:24,780 --> 00:23:29,880
some questions before about how do I you

503
00:23:28,410 --> 00:23:31,590
know shouldn't I add more carbon and

504
00:23:29,880 --> 00:23:33,960
whatever and I'm sitting back there with

505
00:23:31,590 --> 00:23:36,060
him saying well Ron maybe that's put

506
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:41,100
some cover crops in and up up your

507
00:23:36,060 --> 00:23:43,200
nitrogen and carbon but have a higher

508
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,900
proportion and if you want to get more

509
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:48,090
in in the system to balance your high

510
00:23:45,900 --> 00:23:50,280
carbon so that's kind of what you do

511
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:53,880
with that thing it's kind of like

512
00:23:50,280 --> 00:23:55,680
feeding cows is you want you don't feed

513
00:23:53,880 --> 00:24:00,750
a cow straight straw she needs to have

514
00:23:55,680 --> 00:24:02,130
some protein the trouble with feeding

515
00:24:00,750 --> 00:24:04,380
the cows straight straw it's you just

516
00:24:02,130 --> 00:24:09,300
can't eat enough of it because you can't

517
00:24:04,380 --> 00:24:10,710
digest it hey it's not good food for so

518
00:24:09,300 --> 00:24:12,090
you got to give her a little protein and

519
00:24:10,710 --> 00:24:15,810
then that makes it good food

520
00:24:12,090 --> 00:24:18,000
so that's thing managing cover crops is

521
00:24:15,810 --> 00:24:19,710
more of an art than a science at this

522
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:25,370
point if anybody tells you they know how

523
00:24:19,710 --> 00:24:29,670
to do it they're a liar I mean it's just

524
00:24:25,370 --> 00:24:31,590
really more of an art if at least some

525
00:24:29,670 --> 00:24:33,690
component of a rotation to not feeling

526
00:24:31,590 --> 00:24:37,710
excessively dry year John was talking

527
00:24:33,690 --> 00:24:40,590
about 2012 if you didn't fail in 2012

528
00:24:37,710 --> 00:24:42,360
with some of your components we

529
00:24:40,590 --> 00:24:48,150
harvested really good winter wheat in

530
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:51,840
2012 but the corn sucked okay but if

531
00:24:48,150 --> 00:24:54,090
some of those components don't fail then

532
00:24:51,840 --> 00:24:56,220
you don't have enough intensity nobody

533
00:24:54,090 --> 00:24:59,880
everybody wants to have a rotation that

534
00:24:56,220 --> 00:25:01,470
doesn't fail when it's dry but if you

535
00:24:59,880 --> 00:25:04,710
don't fail when it's really dry like

536
00:25:01,470 --> 00:25:07,380
that you haven't taken full advantage of

537
00:25:04,710 --> 00:25:09,120
a normal year and you will fail badly in

538
00:25:07,380 --> 00:25:12,380
wet years and this is what's happened to

539
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:16,620
a lot of people they've been overly

540
00:25:12,380 --> 00:25:19,470
cautious and then they failed because

541
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:21,360
it's too wet if you look at a guy that

542
00:25:19,470 --> 00:25:23,790
still does wheat summer fallows in

543
00:25:21,360 --> 00:25:26,640
Montana couple weeks ago they still do

544
00:25:23,790 --> 00:25:29,750
we thumb fallow there

545
00:25:26,640 --> 00:25:32,640
for hey boo do ya

546
00:25:29,750 --> 00:25:34,830
pH is a five because they're leaching

547
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,360
all the lime out the limes at 3 foot and

548
00:25:34,830 --> 00:25:37,650
then they're telling put lime on the top

549
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:39,690
because they put all their lying down

550
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:41,370
below I mean like get some roots out

551
00:25:39,690 --> 00:25:45,090
there bring the stuff from pool back to

552
00:25:41,370 --> 00:25:47,910
the surface we're blonde but I just said

553
00:25:45,090 --> 00:25:51,090
to them guys 9 years out of town you

554
00:25:47,910 --> 00:25:52,230
fail because you followed that ground

555
00:25:51,090 --> 00:25:57,030
and you could have done something with

556
00:25:52,230 --> 00:25:59,490
it you've failed 9 years out of 10 when

557
00:25:57,030 --> 00:26:01,200
gets Homer fella so take about water

558
00:25:59,490 --> 00:26:04,980
cycle energy flow mineral cycle

559
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:06,720
community dynamics ok mineral cycler the

560
00:26:04,980 --> 00:26:08,280
nutrients available for plant use or

561
00:26:06,720 --> 00:26:11,299
have they been leached eroded or

562
00:26:08,280 --> 00:26:13,380
transported from the landscape

563
00:26:11,299 --> 00:26:17,100
ecosystems the leak nutrients become

564
00:26:13,380 --> 00:26:19,980
deserts one of those nutrients is carbon

565
00:26:17,100 --> 00:26:21,809
k talked about losing carbon gaining

566
00:26:19,980 --> 00:26:23,160
carbon losing carbon gaining carbon if

567
00:26:21,809 --> 00:26:28,110
we keep losing carbon we're going to

568
00:26:23,160 --> 00:26:31,460
turn into a desert as these e good good

569
00:26:28,110 --> 00:26:36,540
students saline seeps indicate leakage

570
00:26:31,460 --> 00:26:38,790
decreasing pH indicates leaking one unit

571
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,940
rain soybeans almost half a million

572
00:26:38,790 --> 00:26:44,700
pounds so saline seep brain here goes

573
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:47,070
here we've got to get this cycle fix

574
00:26:44,700 --> 00:26:49,950
here truly a water cycling issue

575
00:26:47,070 --> 00:26:57,660
I call this catch and release nutrients

576
00:26:49,950 --> 00:27:00,750
what's in the saline sea salt I used to

577
00:26:57,660 --> 00:27:03,240
teach chemistry there's lots of salts

578
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:07,130
right every to take an acid the base to

579
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:09,720
make a salt so salt isn't an answer

580
00:27:07,130 --> 00:27:15,419
number one thing that's in the saline

581
00:27:09,720 --> 00:27:16,650
seep is nitrate that's fertilizer number

582
00:27:15,419 --> 00:27:18,900
two thing that's in there's calcium

583
00:27:16,650 --> 00:27:21,360
sulfate that's gypsum that's a

584
00:27:18,900 --> 00:27:24,419
fertilizer number three thing that's in

585
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:26,400
there is calcium carbonate that's lime

586
00:27:24,419 --> 00:27:27,919
that's a fertilizer so when I asked you

587
00:27:26,400 --> 00:27:33,059
that question you're supposed to say

588
00:27:27,919 --> 00:27:34,919
fertilizer okay so all the kids from

589
00:27:33,059 --> 00:27:36,090
SCSU and all the kids from water tell

590
00:27:34,919 --> 00:27:37,679
them to come and visit I got two

591
00:27:36,090 --> 00:27:40,679
instructors trained then I asked those

592
00:27:37,679 --> 00:27:42,730
kids that class and they'll go

593
00:27:40,679 --> 00:27:46,389
because if they don't say that then I

594
00:27:42,730 --> 00:27:47,919
yell at the instructor if you get

595
00:27:46,389 --> 00:27:49,570
stranded in the rain the back forty

596
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:55,480
drive home across the tilled field or

597
00:27:49,570 --> 00:27:57,190
the pastor pastor people say oh I get

598
00:27:55,480 --> 00:27:58,929
you know by no-till is too wet and I get

599
00:27:57,190 --> 00:28:00,519
stuck it's not no tills fault you

600
00:27:58,929 --> 00:28:02,799
haven't got the soil structure there yet

601
00:28:00,519 --> 00:28:06,960
and you haven't got your water cycle

602
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:09,429
fixed organic matter makes a difference

603
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:13,929
we've been running some rotations that

604
00:28:09,429 --> 00:28:16,179
read at Pier 4 since 1990 here's some

605
00:28:13,929 --> 00:28:19,360
winter wheat 2006 it doesn't look very

606
00:28:16,179 --> 00:28:23,919
good right across the road it looks like

607
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:26,169
this what's the difference well if I

608
00:28:23,919 --> 00:28:26,590
look at those two fields this is a good

609
00:28:26,169 --> 00:28:29,169
one

610
00:28:26,590 --> 00:28:31,960
this is a bad one both of them are

611
00:28:29,169 --> 00:28:35,429
winter wheat that followed peas that

612
00:28:31,960 --> 00:28:39,429
followed corn this rotation is identical

613
00:28:35,429 --> 00:28:40,230
except I've got an extra soybean in

614
00:28:39,429 --> 00:28:42,580
there

615
00:28:40,230 --> 00:28:44,139
soybeans are low and carbon peas are low

616
00:28:42,580 --> 00:28:47,200
in carbon wheat and corn or high in

617
00:28:44,139 --> 00:28:48,700
carbon so one of those I got two-thirds

618
00:28:47,200 --> 00:28:50,860
high carbon one third low and the other

619
00:28:48,700 --> 00:28:52,269
ones half-and-half corn soybeans

620
00:28:50,860 --> 00:28:56,769
half-and-half you don't have enough

621
00:28:52,269 --> 00:28:58,960
carbon unless you add some carbons from

622
00:28:56,769 --> 00:29:01,149
other place so what's that mean for

623
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,690
yields with seven point nine inches of

624
00:29:01,149 --> 00:29:07,059
rain or total coal preset between when

625
00:29:04,690 --> 00:29:10,090
the peas harvested and the wheat was

626
00:29:07,059 --> 00:29:13,299
harvested and seven point nine inches in

627
00:29:10,090 --> 00:29:16,809
2006 sixty versus twenty nine twenty

628
00:29:13,299 --> 00:29:20,139
three point seven in 2005 92 versus

629
00:29:16,809 --> 00:29:22,179
fifty-seven six point four and two two

630
00:29:20,139 --> 00:29:28,749
thousand two fifty six verses twenty

631
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:31,269
eight organic matter makes a difference

632
00:29:28,749 --> 00:29:35,440
but you kind of had to be there for a

633
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:37,450
few years and we John showed that - hey

634
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:39,190
takes a little while to restore those

635
00:29:37,450 --> 00:29:40,799
soils because they've been degraded it

636
00:29:39,190 --> 00:29:46,419
wasn't our fault

637
00:29:40,799 --> 00:29:48,850
but we're fixing them if you if you get

638
00:29:46,419 --> 00:29:52,659
a chance watch the Cronin farms video

639
00:29:48,850 --> 00:29:56,649
Leopold video mics as well

640
00:29:52,659 --> 00:30:00,009
grandpa broke this land and my dad mind

641
00:29:56,649 --> 00:30:02,639
the land and it's up to Monty and I fix

642
00:30:00,009 --> 00:30:06,399
it right

643
00:30:02,639 --> 00:30:07,590
okay that's it's up to us to fix it this

644
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:12,399
year

645
00:30:07,590 --> 00:30:15,129
okay here's that two-thirds high residue

646
00:30:12,399 --> 00:30:18,519
ninety-five bushel thirteen four here's

647
00:30:15,129 --> 00:30:23,340
that half eighty here's another half

648
00:30:18,519 --> 00:30:27,489
with Cara nada instead of piece sixty

649
00:30:23,340 --> 00:30:29,409
here's where I got even higher carbon

650
00:30:27,489 --> 00:30:32,979
count content ninety-five and

651
00:30:29,409 --> 00:30:38,379
eighty-seven organic matter makes a

652
00:30:32,979 --> 00:30:41,590
difference alternate year week this is

653
00:30:38,379 --> 00:30:44,320
old data from 1990s every other year

654
00:30:41,590 --> 00:30:46,960
wheat half high residue half low residue

655
00:30:44,320 --> 00:30:49,570
forty six bushel two years high and one

656
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,549
year at old fifty-three here I got two

657
00:30:49,570 --> 00:30:55,419
years a wheat one your corn forty eight

658
00:30:51,549 --> 00:30:59,710
four but that's organic matter makes a

659
00:30:55,419 --> 00:31:02,259
difference here's what it cost me in

660
00:30:59,710 --> 00:31:05,080
1990s to grow this here's a fallow thing

661
00:31:02,259 --> 00:31:07,799
wheat corn fallow wheat corn P it cost

662
00:31:05,080 --> 00:31:11,619
me four sixty that would do weak fallow

663
00:31:07,799 --> 00:31:14,139
379 two wheat corn fallow to forty five

664
00:31:11,619 --> 00:31:16,710
to do wheat corn P people used to ask me

665
00:31:14,139 --> 00:31:19,599
do you make any money on them dang peez

666
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:21,369
and I said don't make me to make money

667
00:31:19,599 --> 00:31:27,789
on peas I just have to lose less money

668
00:31:21,369 --> 00:31:32,049
than it cost me to summer fell hey I

669
00:31:27,789 --> 00:31:36,039
used to love doing that to people we ran

670
00:31:32,049 --> 00:31:38,529
that study out in Lyman County for

671
00:31:36,039 --> 00:31:40,479
twelve years and in the thirteenth year

672
00:31:38,529 --> 00:31:42,669
I put the whole thing in the spring

673
00:31:40,479 --> 00:31:44,169
wheat and I've shown a lot of over the

674
00:31:42,669 --> 00:31:46,359
years showing a lot of weed things from

675
00:31:44,169 --> 00:31:50,080
there I've never shown you this yield

676
00:31:46,359 --> 00:31:51,940
2002 really dry year right where we

677
00:31:50,080 --> 00:31:54,159
where we did week can all this all went

678
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:58,179
to spring wheat so where we done wheat

679
00:31:54,159 --> 00:31:59,769
canola for twelve years and then planted

680
00:31:58,179 --> 00:32:01,899
spring wheat there fifteen point four

681
00:31:59,769 --> 00:32:03,489
where did wheat fallow we got twenty

682
00:32:01,899 --> 00:32:04,169
point seven that was on fallow ground

683
00:32:03,489 --> 00:32:07,320
we're just

684
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:09,179
doing the measured the ones were wheat

685
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:12,720
would have normally gone wheat corn

686
00:32:09,179 --> 00:32:14,460
fallow 23-7 wheat corn pea 25/8

687
00:32:12,720 --> 00:32:16,859
the interesting thing there this is a

688
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:21,600
really dry year why is this wheat better

689
00:32:16,859 --> 00:32:23,700
than this week organic matter 12 years

690
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:25,289
of organic matter we had that one year

691
00:32:23,700 --> 00:32:29,129
when we were producing at least peas

692
00:32:25,289 --> 00:32:34,499
instead of a zero it's an organic matter

693
00:32:29,129 --> 00:32:38,279
thing who says going to talk about

694
00:32:34,499 --> 00:32:40,859
grazing I took this picture at

695
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:44,159
Lloydminster Saskatchewan how many

696
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:47,730
people have been to Lloydminster less

697
00:32:44,159 --> 00:32:49,049
people in the bend of Chicago even John

698
00:32:47,730 --> 00:32:50,999
we really don't know where the hell

699
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:54,840
anything is in Illinois Indiana it's

700
00:32:50,999 --> 00:32:58,499
just over east right we don't have a

701
00:32:54,840 --> 00:33:00,119
clue or any of them things are but you

702
00:32:58,499 --> 00:33:00,659
talk about these towns there we don't

703
00:33:00,119 --> 00:33:03,499
know where they're at

704
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:06,419
that Lloydminster sits right on the

705
00:33:03,499 --> 00:33:10,440
border of alberta and saskatchewan east

706
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:13,739
of edmonton which is about five or six

707
00:33:10,440 --> 00:33:17,090
or seven hours north of the border long

708
00:33:13,739 --> 00:33:20,639
ways north grow a lot of corn there and

709
00:33:17,090 --> 00:33:24,809
they graze it in the wintertime so I

710
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:26,820
took this like in January there's a cow

711
00:33:24,809 --> 00:33:28,320
there in case you guys really can't see

712
00:33:26,820 --> 00:33:31,039
there's a cow hiding and this guy's over

713
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:33,570
here can't see it that cows hard to see

714
00:33:31,039 --> 00:33:36,690
that's one of the best things you can do

715
00:33:33,570 --> 00:33:38,489
is in Canada is they can't really grow

716
00:33:36,690 --> 00:33:39,090
corn for corn but they can grow it as a

717
00:33:38,489 --> 00:33:41,399
grazer

718
00:33:39,090 --> 00:33:47,820
and they had to do a lot of grazing

719
00:33:41,399 --> 00:33:49,350
because of BSE mad cow and I don't know

720
00:33:47,820 --> 00:33:51,539
how many years ago it was maybe ten

721
00:33:49,350 --> 00:33:54,059
years ago I didn't meet a whole swing up

722
00:33:51,539 --> 00:33:57,029
through northern Canada or north central

723
00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,359
Canada Saskatchewan Alberta and I'm

724
00:33:57,029 --> 00:34:04,580
listening to the radio and old cow was

725
00:34:00,359 --> 00:34:06,749
worth seven cents or eight cents a pound

726
00:34:04,580 --> 00:34:09,659
because you couldn't do anything with

727
00:34:06,749 --> 00:34:12,270
them other than make them into dog food

728
00:34:09,659 --> 00:34:15,750
they had to take a bunch of money out of

729
00:34:12,270 --> 00:34:16,730
their cow raising system and they did it

730
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:21,520
by

731
00:34:16,730 --> 00:34:23,780
quittin hey you know quitting doing

732
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,369
hauling stuff and feeding the college

733
00:34:23,780 --> 00:34:27,350
they put him put them out these are

734
00:34:25,369 --> 00:34:32,200
Canadian cows okay and I'm going to give

735
00:34:27,350 --> 00:34:36,050
you a link later on but if you miss it

736
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:39,080
just google Alberta swath grazing

737
00:34:36,050 --> 00:34:40,850
Alberta Bale grazing and get all these

738
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:42,679
videos and these guys talk about how

739
00:34:40,850 --> 00:34:44,619
they do their different different things

740
00:34:42,679 --> 00:34:47,750
it's really interesting

741
00:34:44,619 --> 00:34:50,830
why are we doing this and Jay talked

742
00:34:47,750 --> 00:34:55,520
about a little bit in so did Lance and

743
00:34:50,830 --> 00:34:58,070
dry or brittle environments and soil

744
00:34:55,520 --> 00:35:00,410
biology slows during times of low soil

745
00:34:58,070 --> 00:35:02,480
moisture that would be western central

746
00:35:00,410 --> 00:35:05,660
and western South Dakota the rumen of

747
00:35:02,480 --> 00:35:07,820
grazing animals remains moist continuing

748
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:12,100
the biological process when it normally

749
00:35:07,820 --> 00:35:15,350
would stop similarly in cold climates

750
00:35:12,100 --> 00:35:17,390
soil biology slows during times of low

751
00:35:15,350 --> 00:35:19,880
soil temperatures and Lance brought that

752
00:35:17,390 --> 00:35:21,350
up talked about the tundra that you

753
00:35:19,880 --> 00:35:26,090
realize the tundra is a hundred miles

754
00:35:21,350 --> 00:35:28,190
north of here right Bruce grew up in

755
00:35:26,090 --> 00:35:29,450
Winnipeg which is several hundred miles

756
00:35:28,190 --> 00:35:31,310
north in here and I didn't see any

757
00:35:29,450 --> 00:35:33,530
Tundra still looking for the polar bears

758
00:35:31,310 --> 00:35:35,869
when we go up to visit the family but

759
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:38,660
the rumen of grazing animals remains

760
00:35:35,869 --> 00:35:42,230
warm during these times so that's why

761
00:35:38,660 --> 00:35:44,540
this winter grazing thing like Jay said

762
00:35:42,230 --> 00:35:46,250
is is really probably a pretty good

763
00:35:44,540 --> 00:35:49,160
thing so here some of our cover crop

764
00:35:46,250 --> 00:35:56,390
that's of X votes and peas and if in a

765
00:35:49,160 --> 00:36:00,650
little bit of rapeseed growing after we

766
00:35:56,390 --> 00:36:05,119
harvest going to corn okay this is our

767
00:36:00,650 --> 00:36:08,980
mix it's not real fancy we just swap it

768
00:36:05,119 --> 00:36:12,950
we swath it because if you don't swap it

769
00:36:08,980 --> 00:36:14,570
it gets too mature your weight tell us

770
00:36:12,950 --> 00:36:17,270
about right and your swath it otherwise

771
00:36:14,570 --> 00:36:20,390
it goes to hell in terms of all quantity

772
00:36:17,270 --> 00:36:22,880
and quality okay and there it is it

773
00:36:20,390 --> 00:36:26,420
looks like that nice big swath right

774
00:36:22,880 --> 00:36:29,300
there it look nice and green

775
00:36:26,420 --> 00:36:32,870
if you don't swap it on time

776
00:36:29,300 --> 00:36:34,730
you get less stuff and less quality to

777
00:36:32,870 --> 00:36:37,340
sloth on time that where we did it right

778
00:36:34,730 --> 00:36:42,020
we had for a little over 4 tons of stuff

779
00:36:37,340 --> 00:36:44,780
20% protein very good feed oats peas and

780
00:36:42,020 --> 00:36:49,150
rape where we're going to go from weak

781
00:36:44,780 --> 00:36:51,590
to soybeans then we use a mix of oats

782
00:36:49,150 --> 00:36:54,260
German millet and brown midrib for

783
00:36:51,590 --> 00:36:56,720
exordium Sudan and it doesn't grow late

784
00:36:54,260 --> 00:36:59,030
in the fall so didn't yield us as much

785
00:36:56,720 --> 00:37:01,070
in terms of tons or it's not as good of

786
00:36:59,030 --> 00:37:04,910
quality either but it's not opportunity

787
00:37:01,070 --> 00:37:07,700
and then we use a moving fence now you

788
00:37:04,910 --> 00:37:09,170
move it by hand and there's lots of

789
00:37:07,700 --> 00:37:11,690
people know how to do that and that's

790
00:37:09,170 --> 00:37:14,840
fine we decided to do that most of us we

791
00:37:11,690 --> 00:37:17,690
did on our irrigated ground we use our

792
00:37:14,840 --> 00:37:19,460
irrigator to move the fence so that's a

793
00:37:17,690 --> 00:37:21,080
rope hanging down from the irrigator

794
00:37:19,460 --> 00:37:23,810
we've got three of them for span there's

795
00:37:21,080 --> 00:37:26,480
a post and a wire up here and a wire

796
00:37:23,810 --> 00:37:29,810
down here and a bucket to keep things

797
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:31,340
from blowing around and I do have videos

798
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:33,490
of this but I'm not going to show it cuz

799
00:37:31,340 --> 00:37:36,860
I don't have time but we just move it

800
00:37:33,490 --> 00:37:38,990
every day or two and then the cows

801
00:37:36,860 --> 00:37:41,510
follow right behind in the movie it

802
00:37:38,990 --> 00:37:42,920
shows them running at a dead run as soon

803
00:37:41,510 --> 00:37:46,100
as they hear the irrigator going they

804
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:48,320
just come there's a goat dad's moving

805
00:37:46,100 --> 00:37:53,390
the irrigator right so there they line

806
00:37:48,320 --> 00:37:55,520
up and they graze here the day before

807
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:57,800
and that was a day before that you can

808
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:59,650
see behind this but they clean up those

809
00:37:57,800 --> 00:38:02,300
swaths all the way down to the ground

810
00:37:59,650 --> 00:38:04,820
but it's nice and uniform see there's

811
00:38:02,300 --> 00:38:06,320
that fence and the irrigator it's a

812
00:38:04,820 --> 00:38:09,380
whole lot nicer to go out when it's 20

813
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:11,330
below zero and push a button then it is

814
00:38:09,380 --> 00:38:13,130
to go you know drilling holes and doing

815
00:38:11,330 --> 00:38:14,540
whatever so not even when it's cold it's

816
00:38:13,130 --> 00:38:16,400
you know the irrigator doesn't like it

817
00:38:14,540 --> 00:38:18,830
sometimes those contactors are kind of a

818
00:38:16,400 --> 00:38:21,710
little hard to get them to kick in and

819
00:38:18,830 --> 00:38:24,380
stuff but if you do it right the manures

820
00:38:21,710 --> 00:38:26,960
nice you know that 100 and some bushel

821
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,690
wheat that we had is right there is that

822
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,570
straw they never touched that and then

823
00:38:29,690 --> 00:38:35,840
this is the oats stuff now we were

824
00:38:32,570 --> 00:38:38,330
drilling most of this we had had it so

825
00:38:35,840 --> 00:38:40,790
we we also do in corn stocks at the same

826
00:38:38,330 --> 00:38:42,000
time so we could balance their diet with

827
00:38:40,790 --> 00:38:45,359
moving the core

828
00:38:42,000 --> 00:38:48,859
pivot and the oats pivot so they got a

829
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:52,619
nice balanced diet there's a hay millet

830
00:38:48,859 --> 00:38:55,349
stuff and then we swath that it doesn't

831
00:38:52,619 --> 00:38:57,240
look as good but it's okay the nice

832
00:38:55,349 --> 00:38:59,609
thing about swath grazing if you just

833
00:38:57,240 --> 00:39:02,010
leave the cover crop stand there and

834
00:38:59,609 --> 00:39:05,700
gets jumped full of snow they can't eat

835
00:39:02,010 --> 00:39:07,590
it but if you get it in a swath like

836
00:39:05,700 --> 00:39:10,290
that they will eat it if you go to that

837
00:39:07,590 --> 00:39:12,990
Alberta thing they'll talk about that

838
00:39:10,290 --> 00:39:15,030
mean they got them out and stuff this

839
00:39:12,990 --> 00:39:17,970
deep and the college is going oh there's

840
00:39:15,030 --> 00:39:19,109
a swath under here right but if it's

841
00:39:17,970 --> 00:39:21,690
just they're trying to have to stick

842
00:39:19,109 --> 00:39:23,040
their nose through it all the time but

843
00:39:21,690 --> 00:39:24,599
if they can get their nose on the end of

844
00:39:23,040 --> 00:39:26,520
that sloth they just keep pushing it

845
00:39:24,599 --> 00:39:28,349
with their head and going ahead it's

846
00:39:26,520 --> 00:39:31,560
kind of interesting watch and see here

847
00:39:28,349 --> 00:39:33,030
this is this is them eating through the

848
00:39:31,560 --> 00:39:34,980
snow because we had quite a bit of snow

849
00:39:33,030 --> 00:39:36,810
at time this year there's a fence right

850
00:39:34,980 --> 00:39:38,970
across here this wasn't an irrigator is

851
00:39:36,810 --> 00:39:41,310
actually a fence you can see where the

852
00:39:38,970 --> 00:39:42,840
fence is and right there it's you know

853
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:45,960
the swath and they know that the swath

854
00:39:42,840 --> 00:39:48,030
goes on goes on ahead they're the

855
00:39:45,960 --> 00:39:51,710
buckets worked better than five gallon

856
00:39:48,030 --> 00:39:55,020
buckets worked better than then the

857
00:39:51,710 --> 00:39:57,030
little tubs but now here we're doing a

858
00:39:55,020 --> 00:40:00,540
thing what we we want to do is plant

859
00:39:57,030 --> 00:40:02,460
earlier so we're working with the thing

860
00:40:00,540 --> 00:40:03,930
with the buffett you know Howard Buffett

861
00:40:02,460 --> 00:40:06,030
gave us some money and told us do

862
00:40:03,930 --> 00:40:08,430
whatever we want to do with it which is

863
00:40:06,030 --> 00:40:11,640
kind of nice you know but but we're

864
00:40:08,430 --> 00:40:14,400
trying to if we can get that cover crop

865
00:40:11,640 --> 00:40:17,609
to start consistently before we harvest

866
00:40:14,400 --> 00:40:20,490
the present crop then it's a win because

867
00:40:17,609 --> 00:40:22,740
we pick up time and and and we don't

868
00:40:20,490 --> 00:40:25,109
have the weed problems and we get extra

869
00:40:22,740 --> 00:40:27,359
time and and so we're looking at at at

870
00:40:25,109 --> 00:40:29,700
seed coatings and we we flew at

871
00:40:27,359 --> 00:40:32,490
Gettysburg we flew in this area

872
00:40:29,700 --> 00:40:35,790
John O'Connell from Letcher flew a bunch

873
00:40:32,490 --> 00:40:38,040
of stuff in this area around Mitchell

874
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:41,280
and I've got a lot of pictures from from

875
00:40:38,040 --> 00:40:44,940
Gettysburg but not from from John but

876
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:46,980
here we're flying at Gettysburg there's

877
00:40:44,940 --> 00:40:50,070
a seed the coated seed on the ground we

878
00:40:46,980 --> 00:40:51,720
looked at seed with with just a coating

879
00:40:50,070 --> 00:40:53,420
on it none of this had peat or anything

880
00:40:51,720 --> 00:40:55,750
which I think we're going to need to do

881
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:58,010
it's just a limestone coating with

882
00:40:55,750 --> 00:40:59,839
absorbent or without absorbent but you

883
00:40:58,010 --> 00:41:02,290
can see the seed the seed grew better

884
00:40:59,839 --> 00:41:06,559
when it was on where it had residue

885
00:41:02,290 --> 00:41:09,349
there so just run through a few this is

886
00:41:06,559 --> 00:41:11,329
field one there seed with with nothing

887
00:41:09,349 --> 00:41:13,940
what we had out there is Indian Head

888
00:41:11,329 --> 00:41:15,770
lentils forage peas and flax so if you

889
00:41:13,940 --> 00:41:18,230
see grass there it doesn't count

890
00:41:15,770 --> 00:41:22,520
so there's bear seed there's where we

891
00:41:18,230 --> 00:41:28,099
had 50% coating with no absorbent on it

892
00:41:22,520 --> 00:41:30,470
and there's more there with absorbent

893
00:41:28,099 --> 00:41:32,569
there's even more it's kind of hard to

894
00:41:30,470 --> 00:41:34,130
tell there but if you take a picture

895
00:41:32,569 --> 00:41:37,819
like that that's what that looked like

896
00:41:34,130 --> 00:41:44,750
and and that's the bare seat equivalent

897
00:41:37,819 --> 00:41:48,470
there was was half 50% so b7 half pounds

898
00:41:44,750 --> 00:41:51,920
of lentils 14 pounds of peas and and 6

899
00:41:48,470 --> 00:41:53,720
pounds of flax ok so the same as the

900
00:41:51,920 --> 00:41:56,530
same seeding rate and all of them and

901
00:41:53,720 --> 00:41:59,750
then we did a thing that we called

902
00:41:56,530 --> 00:42:02,900
winter that was a spring this is winter

903
00:41:59,750 --> 00:42:06,069
levels winter piece and flax versus not

904
00:42:02,900 --> 00:42:08,359
winter flax but the same this is 50%

905
00:42:06,069 --> 00:42:11,270
again saying was that bear seed

906
00:42:08,359 --> 00:42:13,280
basically but it's using winter species

907
00:42:11,270 --> 00:42:17,240
so again the seven and a half and

908
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:19,339
fourteen and and six and the winters

909
00:42:17,240 --> 00:42:21,049
don't take off as fast as the springs

910
00:42:19,339 --> 00:42:23,270
because they're going well it's going to

911
00:42:21,049 --> 00:42:24,770
be winter and then I'll rest and then

912
00:42:23,270 --> 00:42:27,290
I'll come back next spring right it's

913
00:42:24,770 --> 00:42:29,690
like winter wheat versus oats winter

914
00:42:27,290 --> 00:42:30,619
wheat it'll just lay there and kind of

915
00:42:29,690 --> 00:42:32,329
go oh okay

916
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:35,780
and then take off the next frame whereas

917
00:42:32,329 --> 00:42:37,099
oats goes it's spring even though it

918
00:42:35,780 --> 00:42:40,819
doesn't know it's August it goes it's

919
00:42:37,099 --> 00:42:43,819
bringing in the dissin and way it goes

920
00:42:40,819 --> 00:42:48,380
and the heads out and okay so there's

921
00:42:43,819 --> 00:42:50,900
that looking down the row okay and then

922
00:42:48,380 --> 00:42:53,960
we we say we we do a winter it's the

923
00:42:50,900 --> 00:42:57,109
same winter things plus we added a few

924
00:42:53,960 --> 00:42:58,880
extra seeing rapeseed and oats so we put

925
00:42:57,109 --> 00:43:00,559
the winter lentil winter pea flax

926
00:42:58,880 --> 00:43:03,049
rapeseed notes these are all going to go

927
00:43:00,559 --> 00:43:04,400
to to two-week to spring so we didn't

928
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:06,380
want any winter wheat or anything like

929
00:43:04,400 --> 00:43:08,180
in there and that's a bit better because

930
00:43:06,380 --> 00:43:11,960
you got the oats and things trying to do

931
00:43:08,180 --> 00:43:15,349
some things for you and that's what it

932
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:17,990
looks like down the road okay and that's

933
00:43:15,349 --> 00:43:21,349
just that's just the 50 percent with no

934
00:43:17,990 --> 00:43:24,319
absorbent here's the 50 percent with

935
00:43:21,349 --> 00:43:27,589
absorbent looking down the road that's a

936
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:29,569
bit thicker now not all the time has the

937
00:43:27,589 --> 00:43:34,039
absorbent helped us sometimes it doesn't

938
00:43:29,569 --> 00:43:37,190
help but in this case it helped us and

939
00:43:34,039 --> 00:43:39,710
there there's another one with absorbent

940
00:43:37,190 --> 00:43:47,980
and then here we go

941
00:43:39,710 --> 00:43:54,589
70% 70% coating with no absorbent wasn't

942
00:43:47,980 --> 00:43:55,849
all that flash and then filled one I

943
00:43:54,589 --> 00:43:58,599
showed you this picture before

944
00:43:55,849 --> 00:44:02,599
here's field one there's a 50 percent

945
00:43:58,599 --> 00:44:03,980
zero and then filled for 50 percent zero

946
00:44:02,599 --> 00:44:08,109
this is a different field that one

947
00:44:03,980 --> 00:44:08,109
didn't they were about three miles apart

948
00:44:08,890 --> 00:44:16,339
okay so it's not consistent enough and

949
00:44:11,950 --> 00:44:19,759
then again field one with the absorbent

950
00:44:16,339 --> 00:44:21,650
on it field for with absorbent again

951
00:44:19,759 --> 00:44:22,970
it's a little better but it will see the

952
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:27,920
spring what it looks like

953
00:44:22,970 --> 00:44:31,670
here's that thing I told you about but

954
00:44:27,920 --> 00:44:34,220
just Google Alberta swath grazing

955
00:44:31,670 --> 00:44:35,569
whatever more cows more goats more sheep

956
00:44:34,220 --> 00:44:37,279
that's how we're going to feed all these

957
00:44:35,569 --> 00:44:42,650
people a number one meat eat and in the

958
00:44:37,279 --> 00:44:48,170
world is goat okay just so all you

959
00:44:42,650 --> 00:44:52,430
Cowboys get get humbled a bit 100%

960
00:44:48,170 --> 00:44:56,329
grass-fed ground beef this is done in

961
00:44:52,430 --> 00:44:58,849
Aberdeen a guy buys cattle from Montana

962
00:44:56,329 --> 00:45:01,910
coal cows puts him on cover crops at

963
00:44:58,849 --> 00:45:04,210
Aberdeen and he has them as certified

964
00:45:01,910 --> 00:45:07,609
grass-fed somebody bought off on that

965
00:45:04,210 --> 00:45:09,680
okay use a perennial sequence or

966
00:45:07,609 --> 00:45:11,390
perennial cover crops will probably be

967
00:45:09,680 --> 00:45:13,339
necessary we're not going to fix the

968
00:45:11,390 --> 00:45:15,670
salinity thing without perennials and I

969
00:45:13,339 --> 00:45:18,130
think Jay talked about that right day

970
00:45:15,670 --> 00:45:20,650
I'm sound good thing Jay took care

971
00:45:18,130 --> 00:45:23,289
easy work so I just put in one slide yet

972
00:45:20,650 --> 00:45:24,700
all tillage tools destroy soil structure

973
00:45:23,289 --> 00:45:26,589
all til he still has decreased water

974
00:45:24,700 --> 00:45:28,029
infiltration all tillage tools reduce

975
00:45:26,589 --> 00:45:34,660
organic matter and all till these twos

976
00:45:28,029 --> 00:45:35,980
increase weeks right and all these years

977
00:45:34,660 --> 00:45:38,890
that I've come here showed you every one

978
00:45:35,980 --> 00:45:41,109
of those sinks all the data behind it so

979
00:45:38,890 --> 00:45:42,730
I just put that in so you don't get

980
00:45:41,109 --> 00:45:45,839
confused as you drive back by the

981
00:45:42,730 --> 00:45:48,250
machinery dealership when you leave

982
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:51,539
bureaucracies got reminds corporations

983
00:45:48,250 --> 00:45:56,009
are operated by people of limited tenure

984
00:45:51,539 --> 00:45:56,009
some are more limited than others right

985
00:45:57,809 --> 00:46:03,490
but they're not going to be here long

986
00:46:01,470 --> 00:46:06,549
society and landowners and farmers

987
00:46:03,490 --> 00:46:08,170
deserve to have long term research so it

988
00:46:06,549 --> 00:46:10,150
Dakota Lakes does farmers and ranchers

989
00:46:08,170 --> 00:46:11,880
harvest sunlight carbon dioxide and

990
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:16,390
water produce products they can sell

991
00:46:11,880 --> 00:46:18,400
some of this is human food we need to be

992
00:46:16,390 --> 00:46:20,319
aware of nutrition issues and off-site

993
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:24,250
impact so if we want to eat meat maybe

994
00:46:20,319 --> 00:46:25,720
we should contrary in producing meat we

995
00:46:24,250 --> 00:46:29,140
have a new director the West River AG

996
00:46:25,720 --> 00:46:32,259
Center Rapid City you know that's where

997
00:46:29,140 --> 00:46:34,390
we kind of house all the cowboys and

998
00:46:32,259 --> 00:46:36,400
stuff for the West River thing and when

999
00:46:34,390 --> 00:46:38,829
we were interviewing the candidates I

1000
00:46:36,400 --> 00:46:43,839
asked the question do you think there'll

1001
00:46:38,829 --> 00:46:45,970
be feed Lots in 40 years do you think

1002
00:46:43,839 --> 00:46:47,769
about that with all the energy it takes

1003
00:46:45,970 --> 00:46:49,930
and all the problems with biological

1004
00:46:47,769 --> 00:46:52,119
resistance and all the issues with

1005
00:46:49,930 --> 00:46:56,380
nutrient cycling and all these issues

1006
00:46:52,119 --> 00:47:01,839
and one of the candidates answered no

1007
00:46:56,380 --> 00:47:06,430
the other one went probably not so how

1008
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:08,349
do we start preparing for that tillage

1009
00:47:06,430 --> 00:47:12,789
is agriculture where fracking is -

1010
00:47:08,349 --> 00:47:14,170
petroleum tying in with Jays thing this

1011
00:47:12,789 --> 00:47:16,180
morning

1012
00:47:14,170 --> 00:47:18,009
they both increase the speed and extent

1013
00:47:16,180 --> 00:47:20,559
of nutrient removal from a resource

1014
00:47:18,009 --> 00:47:22,900
leaving the resource degraded in mining

1015
00:47:20,559 --> 00:47:26,230
that's what we want to do that's what

1016
00:47:22,900 --> 00:47:30,160
grandfather did we can't do that anymore

1017
00:47:26,230 --> 00:47:31,930
so we need to quit frackie our soils and

1018
00:47:30,160 --> 00:47:33,610
start building our soils

1019
00:47:31,930 --> 00:47:35,410
tenuous low disturbance no-till in

1020
00:47:33,610 --> 00:47:37,420
combination with diverse rotations and

1021
00:47:35,410 --> 00:47:40,150
cover crops is a biological answer to a

1022
00:47:37,420 --> 00:47:42,070
biological problem doing the right thing

1023
00:47:40,150 --> 00:47:44,260
environmentally is almost always a crack

1024
00:47:42,070 --> 00:47:48,310
to have economic approach in the long

1025
00:47:44,260 --> 00:47:51,690
run take the out of e tea and the tea

1026
00:47:48,310 --> 00:47:51,690
out of cat thank you

1027
00:47:55,390 --> 00:48:00,389
[Applause]

1028
00:48:05,420 --> 00:48:07,480
you
