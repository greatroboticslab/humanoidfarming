  "text": "welcome to the field the world of the most Advanced Technologies where you can witness the operation of gigantic agricultural machines some Farmers have been experimenting with the parsley Harvester developed by MCO in agricultural company from North Brent in the Netherlands one of the standout features of this machine is its ability to cleanly cut off any remaining leaves allowing the plants to regenerate quickly and optimizing their growth cycle after harvest The Parsley Harvester is equipped with sharp cutting blades as the machine moves through the parsley rows the blades cut the parsley at a predetermined height after the parsley is cut it is either conveyed upward by a belt or vacuums through a tube using a vacuum system this system operates like a high-powered vacuum cleaner sucking The Parsley into a collection area at the rear of the machine this giant machine is commonly used in herb crop farming regions particularly in the Netherlands or other European countries with a width of 6.5 M it can Harvest dozens of tons of herbs each day this significantly increases output when compared to other manual methods ensuring uniform cutting and reducing the need for labor as a result it helps Farmers to save costs and increase profits the soil tiller is an advanced agricultural device that enhances the efficiency of soil preparation for crops with its deep soil processing capability this machine breaks up the stubborn clumps of soil making the soil loose and easy to form into Row the tilled soil becomes suitable for sewing and creates better conditions for plant growth the tiller also helps form loose mounds of soil which serve as a stable foundation for the growth of root crops this allows the roots to grow without disruption or interference from hard soil furthermore the machine features a modular design offering multiple Technical Solutions to suit different farming conditions with large wheels that roll easily on moist ground and the ability to work at a depth of up to 10 in the tiller can handle six crop rows at once farmers can easily install and replace the tiller's components the machine system is also designed to be erosion resistant helping to protect the soil environment one of the standout features of the soil tiller is its flexibility allowing the working width to be adjusted with a few simple manual operations additionally farmers can combine it with a planting machine enabling both tilling and sewing to be done in a single pass saving time and effort farmers use peanut Harvesters to save labor and effectively reduce work intensity tasks that would normally take several days or even weeks with manual labor can now be completed in just a few hours to too begin the Harvest farmers use a peanut Digger that moves through each row it's equipped with a blade to cut the roots from the underside of the plants rotating time on the machine dig deep into the soil flipping the plants over so that they are laid out in rows on the ground with the peanut pods facing one side the Harvester then passes through quickly removing the peenuts to the rear using rollers preventing them from sinking into the soil a vibrating C is designed to remove impurities as the peanuts are gathered into the machine the peanut Harvester can operate smoothly even in wet Fields adapting to various field conditions the peanut Harvester combines digging lifting and flipping into a seamless process additionally picking efficiency reaches 98% which saves considerable time labor and energy most commercial Harvesters use either spindle or Vine shaking mechanisms to remove the fruit from the vine the primary impact comes from a flexible horizont onal double rod that strikes the canopy and shakes it to release the grapes in some regions machine harvesting can reduce labor costs by up to 75% these machines move through the vine rows shaking The Vines so that the grapes fall onto a conveyor belt after being collected impurities are removed through a series of screens the Harvester grapes are immediately transferred to trucks for Trans port to the processing facility this method of machine harvesting is exclusively used for wine grape production it is estimated that a machine can Harvest 1 hectare in around 5 hours Harvesters can also run continuously for 24 hours a day machine harvesting is typically more cost effective and well suited for large Vineyards located on flat terrain with machine harvesting grapes can be chilled faster than with handpicking these machines are equipped with lights to assist in nighttime harvesting helping Farmers to shorten the harvesting period especially during peak times grapes that are left on The Vines for too long after ripening will quickly deteriorate and perish these massive machines can collect up to 300 kg of produce in just a few minutes significantly reducing labor and harvest time while providing flexibility to meet the demands of modern agriculture this tarp system can extend from 9 M to 11 M and is automatically operated to optimize harvesting processes it is commonly used to harvest fruits such as olives almonds cherries and oranges the Shaker is capable of adjusting the shaking sequence to effectively detach all the fruit thanks to its easy to operate design the the operator can use this equipment in any intensive farming system the Harvester is equipped with an automatic ground tarp rolling system increasing the Harvest speed by up to 75% of the fruit on the tree the cabin is integrated with a 7in color screen to control the entire machine along with an automatic brightness adjusting camera system this Machinery ensures continuous and efficient harvesting the automatic transplanter operates in the field with the modern and highly efficient planting process to operate the machine Farmers must first prepare the soil to ensure proper moisture and looseness seedling trays are then loaded into the machine the transplanter is Compact and easy to use operators can precisely set parameters such as the distance between plants and the planting depth during operation ation the machine uses a mechanical or hydraulic system to lift each seedling from the tray and plant it into the soil the robotic arms move rhythmically ensuring each seedling is planted in the correct position when the temperature is cooler and the fruit is less likely to get damaged farmers use a pole with a net to pick the mangoes ensuring that they don't fall and Bruise they leave a bit of stem on the fruit which helps it to stay fresh for longer mango trees can grow between 30 to 40 ft tall making harvesting tricky farmers use ladders or equipment to reach the fruit at the very top of the tree each mango is picked by hand and placed in Trace all the harvested mangoes are kept in the shade under trees while waiting for transport next Farmers load mangoes onto trucks and take them to the packing area at the packing facility mangoes are cooled to remove field heat and lower their temperature to the desired level helping to extend their shelf life sorting is done using various tools like mango grading machines categorize the fruit by size and other color sensors that measure ripeness packing and transporting the mangoes are critical stages requiring careful handling to avoid reducing the fruit's market value stored at a temperature of 9 to 10\u00b0 C mangoes can maintain their quality for up to 21 days mangoes are a rich source of vitamins minerals antioxidants and fiber this valuable fruit is widely exported to International markets giving Farmers the chance to tap into the global trade opportunities in 2023 Global grape production reached 28.4 m million tons with China and the US leading the world California is famous for its wine and the excitement that comes with harvest season the warm Autumn months bring ideal weather for grape harvesting by August the grapes begin to ripen the most noticeable sign is the color change across the vineyard green grapes turn yellow sometimes even red while red grapes shift to a deep purple at this stage The Grapes also increase in size and become softer grape Harvest typically begins 30 to 70 days after the fruit is set during this period we see an increase in sugar content and a decrease in acidity within the fruit harvesting begins early in the morning with workers picking row by row most wine grapes are best harvested around 22 to 24 bricks hand picking can often yield better results skilled workers carefully cut each cluster and place them into containers while removing any sunburned or rotten grapes Vineyards that opt for hand picking usually priori as quality over quantity at the winery the grapes are separated from the stems and leaves to prevent any bitterness during fermentation next comes the crushing process using the mechanical presses the grapes are then left to rest and fermentation begins within 6 to 12 hours converting all the sugar into alcohol in regions with particularly hot climates Farmers often Harvest grapes at night in the cooler conditions Pickers can ensure that all the grapes are at the same temperature wine makers in warmer areas typically pick grapes at night to preserve their Aroma and prevent spontaneous fermentation high quality grapes harvested this way lead to better wine lower energy costs and higher efficiency Farmers start sewing eggplant seeds indoors around 10 weeks before the last frost date the seedlings will grow when the soil temperature reaches 60\u00b0 F Farmers plant them with a maximum spacing of 24 in between plants and 2 to 3 ft between rows eggplants thrive in nutrient rich well- drained soil mulching can help eggplants grow strong in the spring adding bright colored straw mulch in the summer helps to reduce heat buildup eggplants prefer soil with a pH of 6.5 and need one to 2 in of water each week eggplants can be harvested around 70 days after sewing they can quickly become overripe and bitter so check them every 1 to 2 days to see if they're ready overall the best time to harvest eggplants is from Midsummer onwards around July to September when the skin of the eggplant is shiny and smooth they are ready for Harvest Farmers cut a section of the fruit stem it's important to handle the eggplants gently during Harvest as they can be easily bruised careful selection is crucial to ensure that only the best eggplants move on to the next stage once the baskets are full workers transport them to the Sorting area here the eggplants are carefully arranged and sorted harvesting eggplants can take several days to a few weeks and regular harvesting helps increase yield like cucumbers eggplants are very sensitive to temperature when temperatures drop below 50\u00b0 Fahrenheit it can damage their texture and flavor eggplants can typically be stored for 1 to 2 weeks after harvest as long as they are kept properly at processing facilities eggplants are turned into delicious products they are cut into bite-sized pieces seasoned fried and combined with sauces to create rich flavors watermelon Vines spread 6 to 8 ft within 30 days after 2 months the first watermelons will appear finally the crop is ready for Harvest within around 3 months due to varying pollination times not all watermelons ripen at the same time as a result Farmers often need to harvest the same field multiple times one team of workers goes ahead to cut the Watermelons from The Vines then turns them over to indicate that they are ready a second team of workers then collects the cut watermelons from behind they form a watermelon conveyor line and load the melons onto trucks for packing Farmers must be extremely careful not to scratch or damage the fruit to avoid skin abrasions and rot harvesting is done only in dry weather after harvesting Farmers place the Watermelons with the bottom side down to prevent sunburn they are carefully placed in trucks lined with soft fabric and dry grass or straw at the bottom temperature control between 10 to 16\u00b0 C helps keep the watermelons in the best conditions and extends their shelf life sugarcane farming provides over 19,000 jobs and nearly $4.7 billion annually to the economy in southeast Asian countries sugar cane is grown by local farmers on small plots of land and harvested using traditional methods farmers use hand knives or cutting blades for manual harvesting this requires skilled labor improper harvesting can lead to a reduced sugar yield and problems during the Milling process typically farmers will harvest a crop every 3 to 5 years after harvesting the sugar cane is bundled together the farmers then transport the bundles to the train once the train is fully loaded it departs for the sugar processing plant sugar cane is chopped into smaller pieces before being crushed then put in large roller mills to extract the juice the juice is processed to remove impurities through coagulation and sedimentation this process produces raw sugar by separating sugar crystals from the surrounding Molasses for every 100 tons of sugar cane produced about 12 tons of sugar are produced however most of the sugar is produced from from mechanical harvesting about 50% of the sugar cane in the US comes from Florida the Florida sugar industry has an annual income of over $800 million with a total economic value of over 2 billion mature sugar cane can grow up to 10 ft tall farmers use mechanical Harvesters to collect the cane from September until January mechanical harvesting reduces the average harvesting time from 32 hours to just 6 to 12 this increased efficiency leads to higher yields and greater profits for Farms",
