1
00:00:06,320 --> 00:00:09,470
Whether you contact your local Extension
Office for a problem in your yard or

2
00:00:09,470 --> 00:00:13,700
garden or you're working with a new
landscaper on a landscape project, one

3
00:00:13,700 --> 00:00:17,090
of the first recommendations is going to
be to have a soil test done.

4
00:00:17,090 --> 00:00:21,200
Once you've taken the samples they'll
send back description of what they find

5
00:00:21,200 --> 00:00:26,029
in those soil tests. Those soil tests will
give you your basic pH, the electrical

6
00:00:26,029 --> 00:00:31,490
conductivity, whether you have lime in
your soils, soil texture, and give you

7
00:00:31,490 --> 00:00:35,600
some basic information about nutrients
and organic matter.

8
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,559
One of the things that your soil test
will tell you is that you have high

9
00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,230
salts or electrical conductivity in your
soil, and in Wyoming most of our pH tends

10
00:00:45,230 --> 00:00:47,629
to be high in the alkaline range.

11
00:00:47,629 --> 00:00:51,289
The organic matter is something that you
do have a lot of control in and if your

12
00:00:51,289 --> 00:00:56,329
organic matter is low we would recommend
that you use compost manure, anything

13
00:00:56,329 --> 00:01:00,140
that was plant material to amend your
soil. And then it will give you

14
00:01:00,140 --> 00:01:05,330
information on the nutrient levels in
your soil. Nitrate is really important

15
00:01:05,330 --> 00:01:06,500
for plant growth

16
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:09,920
Phosphorus is important for root growth.
Potassium is going to be really

17
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,220
important for the overall health of the
plants in your garden.

18
00:01:13,759 --> 00:01:18,799
If you need help in determining what
those soil sample results mean you can

19
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,479
have a copy sent to your local Extension
office for details on your soil sample.
