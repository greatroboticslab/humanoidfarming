00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:06,279
hello welcome to little Garden on the

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:08,800
Prairies and welcome to my beautiful

3
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,920
Green Yard this is one of those Springs

4
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,280
where we've been getting lots of rain

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:16,039
which is great cuz we haven't had one of

6
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,520
those for a few years as you can see the

7
00:00:16,039 --> 00:00:19,720
grass is super green Dand lines are

8
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,240
coming along

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:25,160
nicely and with this rainy weather comes

10
00:00:23,240 --> 00:00:27,439
a lot of cool temperatures so we're

11
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:29,199
having a really cool spring and the

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,960
nighttime temperatures are still pretty

13
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:34,040
cold so because of that I've been really

14
00:00:31,960 --> 00:00:37,000
careful as to what I'm going to be

15
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,680
planting out and when and in this video

16
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:42,879
I'll just go through how you should just

17
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,280
be careful in a cold climate like mine

18
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,160
here when you plant out your stuff you

19
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:49,239
really got to watch those temperatures

20
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,719
so let me show you what I got going on

21
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:54,039
in the Garden

22
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,719
today so all of my winter sewing jugs

23
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:58,120
are still intact here I'll let you see

24
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:01,320
if I can

25
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:04,360
see we got some angula coming in here

26
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:07,400
really good the sweet peas are almost

27
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,479
growing through the top got some green

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,200
onion and

29
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,080
chamomile uh basil and parsley so

30
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,720
everything's coming good except for mint

31
00:01:15,080 --> 00:01:19,600
I'm not sure it's not going to come or

32
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:22,200
if it's just super

33
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,320
slow but these will be safe from the

34
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:26,000
cold they're in the best place ever they

35
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:28,920
got their little mini green houses

36
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,079
keeping them warm and then here are all

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:34,439
my bedding plants it still need to go

38
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:36,159
into pots and into the garden and I'm

39
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:39,079
just going to wait you can see I got

40
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,640
tons of col Aces that are so beautiful

41
00:01:39,079 --> 00:01:43,439
and they're getting so big but they are

42
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:45,680
one of those plants that are very

43
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,640
sensitive to cold I've already had some

44
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,560
of them freeze that I set out in some

45
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,920
pots about a week ago a little bit too

46
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:56,479
early we had a cold night and they froze

47
00:01:52,920 --> 00:01:59,159
and died so but my tomatoes are looking

48
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:01,360
super healthy the green peppers are

49
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:02,960
doing great

50
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,159
so everything's going to be fine I'm

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,039
just leaving them in here they'll be

52
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:09,759
fine for another week until our

53
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,599
nighttime temperatures get better I've

54
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,760
left this door open for the last few

55
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:15,200
nights but because we're going to hit

56
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,440
that

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,920
1° pretty sure it's going to freeze here

58
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,879
in our yard so I'm just going to shut

59
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
this door for the night and then reopen

60
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:25,120
it in the

61
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,440
morning so when the weather was warm a

62
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,840
week ago I started potting up my flowers

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,000
into my pots here and now I'm having to

64
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:35,400
bring them in at night so I'm going to

65
00:02:33,000 --> 00:02:37,360
be just putting them in the garage until

66
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:39,519
those nighttime temperatures stabilize

67
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
and stay warm this is what I'm going to

68
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,959
have to do for

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,519
now so when I got up this morning the

70
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,760
temperature on my phone said it was only

71
00:02:46,519 --> 00:02:51,760
0° so I knew that we must have got frost

72
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,440
and you can see here in the shade on the

73
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,480
grass there is a hint of frost still on

74
00:02:54,440 --> 00:03:00,640
there so I'm happy that I had put away

75
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:03,159
all my pots and covered everything and

76
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,720
saved it from frost so here is where I

77
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:08,440
got my peas planted and my onions

78
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,440
planted and they're pretty cool tolerant

79
00:03:08,440 --> 00:03:13,120
plants I can see

80
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,080
that I have a couple peas starting to

81
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:17,519
pop through but I think they will be

82
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,720
fine they can handle a little bit of

83
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:22,040
light frost this was something that I

84
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:24,519
had to cover it's a ground cherry that I

85
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:28,840
started from seed and it already got

86
00:03:24,519 --> 00:03:30,200
burnt once by a frost here last week and

87
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:31,360
a couple of these plants are still

88
00:03:30,200 --> 00:03:33,840
hanging in there they're looking a

89
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:36,360
little weak but I think they should be

90
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,400
okay kept them covered last night so

91
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:40,000
they are

92
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,280
fine and these are all my onions that I

93
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:45,000
had planted up they were ones I started

94
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:47,239
from seed so they were not too

95
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:49,959
established into the soil here but I

96
00:03:47,239 --> 00:03:52,799
didn't cover them and they seem to be

97
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:54,840
fine like I said they are pretty cool

98
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:57,280
tolerant and can handle a little bit of

99
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:59,400
frost so these should be okay the

100
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:00,280
potatoes of course under straw are just

101
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:02,319
fine

102
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,959
they will be okay they just got planted

103
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:07,360
a week ago so cool nights are not going

104
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,319
to affect them they should be fine I got

105
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,879
some luses started here in my containers

106
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,840
that are also haven't sprouted yet so

107
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:19,320
they should be okay and my area

108
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:23,400
designated for cucumbers tomatoes

109
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:25,960
peppers is still um unplanted and

110
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,320
looking pretty uh rough right now I need

111
00:04:25,960 --> 00:04:31,000
to do a major cleanup and get these

112
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:33,360
ready but as I said it's going to be a

113
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:35,520
good week or so before they need to get

114
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:38,520
planted so I got some time to work in my

115
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:41,360
garden this week so I always like to

116
00:04:38,520 --> 00:04:43,800
check my weather and look ahead you know

117
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,680
14 days just to see what the trend is

118
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:49,479
looking like as you can see here coming

119
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,120
up on this week we still have two

120
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:54,039
evenings where the nighttime low is only

121
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,600
going to be 2°

122
00:04:54,039 --> 00:05:01,360
Celsius and then again coming up like 5

123
00:04:57,600 --> 00:05:04,400
days from now the 24 of May 2° at night

124
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,560
so those are pretty cold temperatures

125
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,520
and in my yard you know when it hits

126
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:12,240
that 2 1° there's a good chance I'm

127
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:15,280
going to get Frost so just looking at

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:18,600
this I'm going to be holding off on

129
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,600
doing any planting of tomatoes peppers

130
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:22,680
probably right till the end of May here

131
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:25,440
when we start to see those nighttime

132
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:29,039
temperatures are moving up to some

133
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,880
warmer evenings and probably um our

134
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,800
daytime highes are going to get into the

135
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:36,240
20s which is great so so even though

136
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,680
it's really tempting to get plants out

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,120
in the garden when you have those

138
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,479
beautiful warm sunny days it's really

139
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,160
the nighttime temperatures you got to

140
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:46,800
keep an eye on and um make sure that

141
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:49,160
you're not going to be planting your

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,720
plants out in cold weather and end up

143
00:05:49,160 --> 00:05:53,479
losing them and having to start over are

144
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,319
good for

145
00:05:53,479 --> 00:06:01,639
yeah they're good for okay put some more

146
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:01,639
we need lots more yeah oh my walk

147
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,479
so there's always lots of things to do

148
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:08,639
while we wait for those temperatures to

149
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:10,720
warm up and today my grandson and I are

150
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,720
doing some picking of Dand lines we want

151
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,840
to do an oil infusion so we can make

152
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,360
some

153
00:06:14,840 --> 00:06:19,319
svvs so you really need to be patient

154
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,360
when you live in a cold climate like I

155
00:06:19,319 --> 00:06:23,120
do the weather is so unpredictable in

156
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,880
the spring and you just have to wait

157
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,960
until Mother Nature has set everything

158
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,440
right and then it's time to get all your

159
00:06:27,960 --> 00:06:32,520
garden planted so please hit that like

160
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:35,039
button leave a comment and we will see

161
00:06:32,520 --> 00:06:38,039
