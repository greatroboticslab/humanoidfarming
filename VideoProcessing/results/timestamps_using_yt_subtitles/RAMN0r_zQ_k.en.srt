00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,680
I just kind of grew up rotating pastures

2
00:00:02,440 --> 00:00:06,839
when they said and just learning how to

3
00:00:04,680 --> 00:00:09,960
read the grass and kind of a take half

4
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:12,719
leave half mentality and we try to

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:16,480
rotate every 2 to 6 days depending on

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,840
pasture size and herd sizes but it's

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,439
still important to get that rest and

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,279
that rotation going those cows love to

9
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,320
get to that fresh pasture and love that

10
00:00:22,279 --> 00:00:31,769
grass and they get pretty used to rotate
