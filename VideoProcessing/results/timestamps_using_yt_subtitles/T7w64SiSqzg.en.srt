1
00:00:06,680 --> 00:00:12,570
my name is dawn Nicholson along with my

2
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,599
wife Trista and three boys Aiden Gavin

3
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,850
and Ian we farm and ranch in Frederick

4
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,710
South Dakota and one things we're trying

5
00:00:17,850 --> 00:00:24,210
to do is incorporate our livestock more

6
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:26,279
into our crop ground where we live in

7
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:29,160
Frederick here the climate and the

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,340
rainfall is very east and west they

9
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:35,100
cross 281 that just starts drying up

10
00:00:32,340 --> 00:00:37,200
more so we have kind of farming in two

11
00:00:35,100 --> 00:00:40,350
different areas where the stuff east of

12
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,629
281 we have generally more rainfall as

13
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:44,160
we go further west it starts falling off

14
00:00:42,629 --> 00:00:47,660
and it lends itself more to the

15
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:50,850
livestock side of the operation

16
00:00:47,660 --> 00:00:53,760
initially I started in a no-till after

17
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:56,550
college I came back to the farm it was

18
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,460
just me and my stepfather at farming so

19
00:00:56,550 --> 00:01:02,370
labor was and it seemed like an easier

20
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:04,799
Avenue to go you know less tillage less

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:07,110
work so it started out as a labor saving

22
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,600
and then I started seeing you know

23
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:11,909
benefits to the to the soil and doing

24
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,970
less work and still keeping up yield

25
00:01:11,909 --> 00:01:16,710
wise with neighbors you know we've

26
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:20,610
always had livestock and we've always

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:23,130
had crap ground focusing on the cattle

28
00:01:20,610 --> 00:01:26,009
in the fields longer start seeing the

29
00:01:23,130 --> 00:01:29,280
benefits of the soil health the crops we

30
00:01:26,009 --> 00:01:32,670
grow here are corn soybeans

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:35,820
triticale alfalfa and starting to do a

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,370
little bit more in the cover crops the

33
00:01:35,820 --> 00:01:40,890
alfalfa I think has been key for me to

34
00:01:38,370 --> 00:01:43,470
start identifying areas of the field

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:45,630
that are not as productive and allows me

36
00:01:43,470 --> 00:01:47,880
different time of the season to be able

37
00:01:45,630 --> 00:01:51,810
to get into those areas if it's fixing

38
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:54,630
saline area spots in our area it's also

39
00:01:51,810 --> 00:01:57,870
there are a lot of potholes so with

40
00:01:54,630 --> 00:02:00,470
excessive water ponding and ditch effect

41
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:03,240
saline areas start popping up and

42
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:04,920
expanding you know if they aren't cared

43
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,369
for or treated differently than the rest

44
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:11,220
of you your crops might use a lot of

45
00:02:08,369 --> 00:02:14,040
precision stuff in my cash crops so I

46
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:16,800
started using that to identify the poor

47
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:20,090
producing areas and then zeroing in on

48
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,220
what those spots need and how to do it

49
00:02:20,090 --> 00:02:28,700
the best way to do that and my operation

50
00:02:23,220 --> 00:02:28,700
is through the cattle and Bale grazing

51
00:02:29,390 --> 00:02:33,930
some of the effects that I've seen in

52
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:36,030
the areas of where I have been Bale

53
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:38,700
grazing after doing it the first year

54
00:02:36,030 --> 00:02:41,940
you know you get the cover which I

55
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:44,519
believe the cover helps eliminate some

56
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:46,320
of that evaporation it keeps the soil

57
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,850
moisture rather than drying out and

58
00:02:46,320 --> 00:02:50,940
bring in all those salts to the top and

59
00:02:47,850 --> 00:02:54,570
then wicking moisture from other areas

60
00:02:50,940 --> 00:02:56,730
and pulling up more salts it's part of

61
00:02:54,570 --> 00:02:58,380
the healing process it might not look

62
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,380
the prettiest at times but it's a rut in

63
00:02:58,380 --> 00:03:04,530
the ground it's something that's growing

64
00:03:00,380 --> 00:03:06,380
also on our pastures I have been

65
00:03:04,530 --> 00:03:08,610
rotational grazing for quite some time

66
00:03:06,380 --> 00:03:10,040
golfers say play the course don't let

67
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,530
the course play you we got a

68
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:14,000
look at how the ground is and what kind

69
00:03:12,530 --> 00:03:15,829
of grasses are there and what you can do

70
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,280
with it each area is managed differently

71
00:03:15,829 --> 00:03:23,359
just like in my crop ground each zone is

72
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,890
is managed differently so there's

73
00:03:23,359 --> 00:03:26,870
challenges every year and every year is

74
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:29,959
a different challenge and what I have

75
00:03:26,870 --> 00:03:31,579
found in my soils you know building the

76
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,769
organic matter having better soil health

77
00:03:31,579 --> 00:03:39,349
allows me to weather through whichever

78
00:03:33,769 --> 00:03:42,370
weather storm I faced with I wasn't born

79
00:03:39,349 --> 00:03:45,650
into farming but from a very early age

80
00:03:42,370 --> 00:03:48,019
since I was probably nine ten years old

81
00:03:45,650 --> 00:03:51,349
I was been exposed to to farming and

82
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:54,079
then got a great opportunity and a lot

83
00:03:51,349 --> 00:03:56,419
of freedom to try different things

84
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,549
my stepfather gave me a lot of a lot of

85
00:03:56,419 --> 00:04:01,129
freedom that way and and that's helped

86
00:03:58,549 --> 00:04:02,780
me going forward I remember him always

87
00:04:01,129 --> 00:04:05,540
telling me you know do what you think's

88
00:04:02,780 --> 00:04:07,750
best and you know that's what I hope to

89
00:04:05,540 --> 00:04:10,400
pass along to my my son's you know

90
00:04:07,750 --> 00:04:12,170
whatever they're doing is and do what

91
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,190
they thinks best

92
00:04:12,170 --> 00:04:16,190
[Music]

93
