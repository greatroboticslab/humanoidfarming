1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,620
good morning modern standards this

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,379
morning's video is going to be all about

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:09,840
starting our tomatoes and growing our

4
00:00:07,379 --> 00:00:11,730
tomato plants in soil blocks in the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,759
house we've been getting a ton of

6
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:16,650
specific questions about our growing

7
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:19,410
system and how we're doing it so I'm

8
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:22,140
excited I am encouraged to share how

9
00:00:19,410 --> 00:00:24,000
many people are growing their own or

10
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:25,590
getting ready to start their own inside

11
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,380
that's very encouraging and exciting

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:31,199
we'll be eating BLTs with a lot of

13
00:00:28,380 --> 00:00:32,969
modern stutters the summer so let's dive

14
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:34,980
in and let's talk a little bit more

15
00:00:32,969 --> 00:00:37,710
about our Tomatoes and how we're growing

16
00:00:34,980 --> 00:00:41,219
them there's been a lot of people making

17
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:43,800
comments about our lights being too low

18
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,350
they weren't lower but I was leaving

19
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,399
them low to let the little guys catch up

20
00:00:46,350 --> 00:00:54,690
a few of them here and here yesterday I

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,940
raised the lights up believe it or not 2

22
00:00:54,690 --> 00:01:01,109
to 3 inches and there was room between

23
00:00:56,940 --> 00:01:04,290
the light and the plants and they have

24
00:01:01,109 --> 00:01:07,400
grown immensely what I'm gonna do is I'm

25
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:12,210
gonna raise our lights up to links

26
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:14,310
Believe It or Not yesterday and the

27
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:22,350
plants are already touching the lights

28
00:01:14,310 --> 00:01:23,939
again mister Figueroa you're making too

29
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:29,700
much noise with the chickens over here

30
00:01:23,939 --> 00:01:32,250
it's hard for us to hear the grow light

31
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:34,860
that we're using here on these tomato

32
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:37,740
plants is a regular fluorescent shop

33
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:42,450
light setup with t12

34
00:01:37,740 --> 00:01:48,149
grow light bulbs and over here we have

35
00:01:42,450 --> 00:01:50,340
our LED strip lights I have not been

36
00:01:48,149 --> 00:01:52,259
sitting my plants right away what I do

37
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,840
is I let them grow up a little bit and

38
00:01:52,259 --> 00:01:56,610
when I find one plant that's better than

39
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:59,430
the other like this ones growing nice

40
00:01:56,610 --> 00:02:01,619
and straight and the base on this one

41
00:01:59,430 --> 00:02:02,840
doesn't look as nice so we're gonna get

42
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:07,770
rid of that one

43
00:02:02,840 --> 00:02:10,410
over here it's kind of a 50/50 it's not

44
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:13,580
a lot healthier but it is I think by

45
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:13,580
pulling this one out now

46
00:02:14,120 --> 00:02:18,019
that one's going to grow a lot faster

47
00:02:18,650 --> 00:02:27,769
but I hate thinning I'm too soon just in

48
00:02:22,980 --> 00:02:27,769
case one of the other doesn't make it

49
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:48,060
the grow light setup that we have is not

50
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:50,190
the most expensive setup it's just the

51
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,500
most affordable setup that I can find I

52
00:02:50,190 --> 00:02:54,359
know that stronger lights out there but

53
00:02:52,500 --> 00:02:56,730
I don't want to focus our plants on

54
00:02:54,359 --> 00:02:58,680
growing up inside the grow lights are

55
00:02:56,730 --> 00:03:00,480
just to give them a good start and that

56
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,019
way we can have a good healthy plant

57
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:05,970
started inside so I'm not gonna you can

58
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:08,430
go out and you can spend hundreds of

59
00:03:05,970 --> 00:03:11,040
hundreds of dollars on good high-quality

60
00:03:08,430 --> 00:03:13,379
lights if you want these are not them

61
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,859
these are strong enough lights to do the

62
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,930
job that we need them to do let's talk

63
00:03:15,859 --> 00:03:20,459
transplanting these seed start we're not

64
00:03:18,930 --> 00:03:22,530
gonna be putting these seed stocks

65
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:25,470
directly into our garden from these soil

66
00:03:22,530 --> 00:03:30,030
blocks you can do either one or two

67
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:32,910
things last year we bought these bigger

68
00:03:30,030 --> 00:03:34,709
pots on Amazon see if I can find the

69
00:03:32,910 --> 00:03:38,489
link farm if I can I'll put them in our

70
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:41,489
store on Amazon then we put the soil

71
00:03:38,489 --> 00:03:44,669
blocks in here and added more soil and

72
00:03:41,489 --> 00:03:47,699
they had all this area to grow and our

73
00:03:44,669 --> 00:03:49,709
plants wish I had pictures of them this

74
00:03:47,699 --> 00:03:51,209
year I need to get better with taking

75
00:03:49,709 --> 00:03:53,190
pictures of things and saving the

76
00:03:51,209 --> 00:03:57,989
pictures I'm gonna say our plants were

77
00:03:53,190 --> 00:04:02,129
is good 12 to 24 inches tall when I use

78
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:04,109
thick stalk the pots works good when we

79
00:04:02,129 --> 00:04:06,030
took him out of the pots they were brute

80
00:04:04,109 --> 00:04:08,699
bombs they could have believe it or not

81
00:04:06,030 --> 00:04:11,400
used to have gone to a bigger pot so

82
00:04:08,699 --> 00:04:13,199
this year what we're gonna do this

83
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:15,510
winter I made this large soil block

84
00:04:13,199 --> 00:04:17,010
maker you want to watch that video see

85
00:04:15,510 --> 00:04:19,530
how to make when you sell I'll put a

86
00:04:17,010 --> 00:04:21,840
link for that video right here but what

87
00:04:19,530 --> 00:04:25,650
we're gonna do is we're gonna transplant

88
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,190
our medium soil blocks into a larger

89
00:04:25,650 --> 00:04:28,950
soil

90
00:04:26,190 --> 00:04:30,780
that we're gonna be making but a lot of

91
00:04:28,950 --> 00:04:33,510
people been asking how do you know when

92
00:04:30,780 --> 00:04:36,150
your plants are ready to go into the

93
00:04:33,510 --> 00:04:38,940
next size container a soil block so the

94
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:42,870
way I determine if my plants are ready

95
00:04:38,940 --> 00:04:45,570
to go to the next soil block what's

96
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:48,720
these ones are believe it or not see all

97
00:04:45,570 --> 00:04:52,710
these little root fibers that's all the

98
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,040
roots growing out of your soil block so

99
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:59,640
this is telling me all right the plant

100
00:04:55,040 --> 00:05:01,590
has used up the space inside of this

101
00:04:59,640 --> 00:05:03,870
soil block and it's time to go to the

102
00:05:01,590 --> 00:05:05,580
next one the other really cool thing

103
00:05:03,870 --> 00:05:10,080
about the soil blocks and seeing the

104
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:12,630
roots like this is now our plant is

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,880
ready to go to another soil block or go

106
00:05:12,630 --> 00:05:16,650
to the garden and get directly planted

107
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:18,120
and whatever we're planting it in and

108
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:20,880
these roots are going to just keep

109
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:25,320
growing where if they're in a pot like

110
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:29,400
this the roots get stuck when they hit

111
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:31,890
the wall of the container they turn back

112
00:05:29,400 --> 00:05:33,930
around and they get roof on they call if

113
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:35,370
you look it's almost like a ball they

114
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:39,560
get balled up and they'll grow into a

115
00:05:35,370 --> 00:05:41,760
circle so the roots don't grow out

116
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,560
easier and when you that's what you have

117
00:05:41,760 --> 00:05:46,530
sometimes you have the transplant shock

118
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:48,030
is the plants are in new soil but they

119
00:05:46,530 --> 00:05:51,120
don't know hey my roots can grow they're

120
00:05:48,030 --> 00:05:53,580
still bound up where the soil block let

121
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,290
ends come to the end and they grow out

122
00:05:53,580 --> 00:05:56,790
and sometimes they'll grow into the

123
00:05:55,290 --> 00:05:59,100
other soil block sometimes they'll just

124
00:05:56,790 --> 00:06:01,890
grow into the tray but that's good so

125
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:03,630
when we go to transplant them they're

126
00:06:01,890 --> 00:06:05,790
gonna have to be ready to take that new

127
00:06:03,630 --> 00:06:10,169
soil on the new nutrients from the new

128
00:06:05,790 --> 00:06:11,760
soil and they just grow amazingly I'm

129
00:06:10,169 --> 00:06:13,169
gonna need to transplant our tomato

130
00:06:11,760 --> 00:06:15,360
plants I'm not gonna do it in today's

131
00:06:13,169 --> 00:06:17,430
video sometime this coming week we're

132
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:19,230
gonna be transplanting these and finally

133
00:06:17,430 --> 00:06:21,600
being able to use the large soil block

134
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:23,280
maker so I'm excited for that so keep

135
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,380
your eye out for that video rather to

136
00:06:23,280 --> 00:06:28,770
show you one other trick to encourage

137
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,720
your roots to grow down let's go over

138
00:06:28,770 --> 00:06:32,610
here and I'll show you now this is one

139
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,350
of the reasons we use the plastic trays

140
00:06:32,610 --> 00:06:39,419
without holes as we can flood the tray I

141
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:39,830
know you normally when I'm watering you

142
00:06:39,419 --> 00:06:41,900
see me what

143
00:06:39,830 --> 00:06:43,880
sprayer somewhere spraying the top of

144
00:06:41,900 --> 00:06:46,040
them that's when they're small and when

145
00:06:43,880 --> 00:06:48,770
they're just starting to turn into

146
00:06:46,040 --> 00:06:55,760
plants once they get bigger if we flood

147
00:06:48,770 --> 00:07:03,680
the tray Colton's flooded and I mean

148
00:06:55,760 --> 00:07:04,460
flood the tray that water in a matter of

149
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:09,160
minutes

150
00:07:04,460 --> 00:07:11,930
is gonna be Swick up by our soil blocks

151
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,150
you can see it's basically just in the

152
00:07:11,930 --> 00:07:17,450
grooves when I flooded it there's about

153
00:07:14,150 --> 00:07:22,040
a half inch of water in there same with

154
00:07:17,450 --> 00:07:24,050
this one what that does is it makes the

155
00:07:22,040 --> 00:07:25,880
soil blocks wick the water up from the

156
00:07:24,050 --> 00:07:27,800
bottom so the pot that's gonna have the

157
00:07:25,880 --> 00:07:29,990
most water is the bottom and that

158
00:07:27,800 --> 00:07:33,620
encourages the plants roots to grow

159
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:36,020
deeper you want that for a few reasons

160
00:07:33,620 --> 00:07:38,330
you want to have good deep roots and if

161
00:07:36,020 --> 00:07:40,670
you're just missing the plant the water

162
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:42,200
staying up high mostly something's gonna

163
00:07:40,670 --> 00:07:44,060
seep down low but the majority of the

164
00:07:42,200 --> 00:07:45,830
water and the wetness is gonna be up

165
00:07:44,060 --> 00:07:48,350
high so it's not going to encourage

166
00:07:45,830 --> 00:07:51,680
those roots to grow them deep it's gonna

167
00:07:48,350 --> 00:07:53,570
encourage surface roots which is it a

168
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:57,680
good thing especially if you garden with

169
00:07:53,570 --> 00:07:59,930
a deep mulch back to eating garden you

170
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:02,690
want to encourage deep root growth and

171
00:07:59,930 --> 00:08:05,420
there's few reasons for that one is it

172
00:08:02,690 --> 00:08:07,750
makes a stronger plant the second is it

173
00:08:05,420 --> 00:08:11,000
makes the roots grow down deeper it

174
00:08:07,750 --> 00:08:13,190
encourages a better growing plant but

175
00:08:11,000 --> 00:08:15,230
less watering and you don't want to

176
00:08:13,190 --> 00:08:17,120
water your plants the more you water

177
00:08:15,230 --> 00:08:19,670
your plants the more the roots are gonna

178
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,470
stay up high you might be watering your

179
00:08:19,670 --> 00:08:23,510
plants May but might be looking good and

180
00:08:21,470 --> 00:08:25,940
healthy but you're not encouraging the

181
00:08:23,510 --> 00:08:28,850
roots to grow deep and the deeper the

182
00:08:25,940 --> 00:08:30,650
roots go the more nutrients those plants

183
00:08:28,850 --> 00:08:32,900
are gonna have because they go in deep

184
00:08:30,650 --> 00:08:35,300
down to the soil going down to the

185
00:08:32,900 --> 00:08:37,970
resources and pulling up what your soil

186
00:08:35,300 --> 00:08:40,460
has down there for and then sucking it

187
00:08:37,970 --> 00:08:42,140
up putting it into the fruit whatever

188
00:08:40,460 --> 00:08:45,010
the pot is that you're gonna eat and

189
00:08:42,140 --> 00:08:48,200
then in return giving us more nutrients

190
00:08:45,010 --> 00:08:51,050
so if you do deep bedding back to eating

191
00:08:48,200 --> 00:08:53,089
garden or just mulch your garden you're

192
00:08:51,050 --> 00:08:55,699
gonna get that and you're not gonna need

193
00:08:53,089 --> 00:08:57,079
to water your garden what's just amazing

194
00:08:55,699 --> 00:08:58,819
so if you have a drought you don't have

195
00:08:57,079 --> 00:09:01,430
to worry about it you might look at the

196
00:08:58,819 --> 00:09:04,670
dirt and go oh it's dry but deep down

197
00:09:01,430 --> 00:09:05,990
it's damp there's moisture down there

198
00:09:04,670 --> 00:09:08,660
and your plants are gonna grow

199
00:09:05,990 --> 00:09:11,389
so like starting our plants this way and

200
00:09:08,660 --> 00:09:13,550
teaching the roots to grow down and

201
00:09:11,389 --> 00:09:15,110
encouraging that from the beginning it

202
00:09:13,550 --> 00:09:18,410
gives you a better plant and a better

203
00:09:15,110 --> 00:09:21,350
garden and more nutrient-dense food it's

204
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,300
just amazing I'm gonna talk more

205
00:09:21,350 --> 00:09:24,589
upcoming videos of how we're gonna plant

206
00:09:23,300 --> 00:09:26,029
them but I'm gonna touch on it real

207
00:09:24,589 --> 00:09:28,459
quick so I know there's a lot of people

208
00:09:26,029 --> 00:09:30,350
that are in a growing zone that they can

209
00:09:28,459 --> 00:09:33,620
be planning their garden sooner than we

210
00:09:30,350 --> 00:09:36,589
are so two more things I want to touch

211
00:09:33,620 --> 00:09:39,259
on before we end the video one is you

212
00:09:36,589 --> 00:09:40,790
want to plant calcium in with your

213
00:09:39,259 --> 00:09:43,129
Tomatoes when you plant them in the

214
00:09:40,790 --> 00:09:45,170
garden so if you have a good source of

215
00:09:43,129 --> 00:09:47,569
quality eggshells you can start saving

216
00:09:45,170 --> 00:09:49,670
up your eggshells and baking them in the

217
00:09:47,569 --> 00:09:52,490
oven to dry them out then you can put

218
00:09:49,670 --> 00:09:53,990
some eggshells in each hole where you

219
00:09:52,490 --> 00:09:56,149
plant them in your garden and they'll

220
00:09:53,990 --> 00:09:57,920
have a good source of calcium while

221
00:09:56,149 --> 00:10:00,889
they're growing you could also do

222
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:02,569
oysters shells that's another good one

223
00:10:00,889 --> 00:10:05,540
so just be thinking about that how am I

224
00:10:02,569 --> 00:10:09,860
gonna get calcium to my tomato plants if

225
00:10:05,540 --> 00:10:11,569
you have tomato and rot or blight most

226
00:10:09,860 --> 00:10:14,029
of the time that's due from an

227
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:16,550
insufficient source of calcium so if you

228
00:10:14,029 --> 00:10:18,769
can start the whole off with calcium the

229
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:20,929
plant should have the calcium while

230
00:10:18,769 --> 00:10:22,790
they're growing and then you'll have

231
00:10:20,929 --> 00:10:25,009
less battles you're fighting throughout

232
00:10:22,790 --> 00:10:27,350
the growing season the other thing you

233
00:10:25,009 --> 00:10:30,199
bring you in close hopefully I can get

234
00:10:27,350 --> 00:10:33,800
the camera to focus but you have these

235
00:10:30,199 --> 00:10:35,870
little knobs on your tomato plants when

236
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:38,240
you plant your tomato plant you should

237
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,759
plant them so you bury the first Leafs

238
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:44,389
or right up to the first leaves all

239
00:10:40,759 --> 00:10:46,279
those little nubs will grow roots and by

240
00:10:44,389 --> 00:10:47,660
planting your tomato plants deeper in

241
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:50,209
the ground they're gonna have more roots

242
00:10:47,660 --> 00:10:52,490
the plants gonna get stockier and harder

243
00:10:50,209 --> 00:10:54,319
so the winds blowing it's not gonna blow

244
00:10:52,490 --> 00:10:56,480
the tomato plant over I'm just gonna

245
00:10:54,319 --> 00:10:57,100
make for a stronger plant right from

246
00:10:56,480 --> 00:10:59,320
beginning

247
00:10:57,100 --> 00:11:02,020
I hope the chicks haven't been too noisy

248
00:10:59,320 --> 00:11:03,790
boy yeah in the video right over there

249
00:11:02,020 --> 00:11:06,850
fingers crossed we'll be getting those

250
00:11:03,790 --> 00:11:09,450
outside this coming week exciting times
