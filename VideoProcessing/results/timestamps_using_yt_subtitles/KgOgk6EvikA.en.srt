5
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,120
let us start uh this lecture with a

6
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,879
thought

7
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:41,600
process that all of we are here to learn

8
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:44,520
right learning is a

9
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,399
process and uh we should have love for

10
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:50,360
learning so I always feel that love for

11
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,520
learning lessons the labor pains of

12
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,160
learning today learning is a very

13
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:57,559
difficult process for all of you

14
00:00:55,160 --> 00:01:00,359
right because you people are occupied

15
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:02,359
with several other things

16
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,839
and therefore it is very important you

17
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:07,080
should develop a love for it and and

18
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:09,880
learning is a part and parcel of human

19
00:01:07,080 --> 00:01:13,320
life uh let us recall what we learned in

20
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:18,200
the last lecture we basically looked at

21
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:22,840
that why we need to go for uh

22
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:27,880
agriculture as a basis for our growth

23
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:30,439
right and why because uh you know like

24
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,439
we are having a naturally Endor with the

25
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,159
resources which are very

26
00:01:32,439 --> 00:01:38,119
conducive and uh you know for the

27
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:39,960
agriculture or the farming and later on

28
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:42,960
we looked at like uh what are the

29
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:45,680
processes involved in

30
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,799
agriculture and how this modern

31
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:53,560
agriculture being implemented as of

32
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:56,039
now right and today we'll be looking at

33
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:59,280
what are the problems we are facing with

34
00:01:56,039 --> 00:02:04,039
the modern farming and you know like uh

35
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:06,200
in 19 uh 50s or the 60s you know like we

36
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:09,319
are having Green Revolution people are

37
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:12,160
very much where Gaga about it and today

38
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,440
also some of the you know intellectuals

39
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,319
are very saying that we need to go for

40
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,360
second Green

41
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:23,120
Revolution is it really Revolution or

42
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:27,040
not that we'll see and I will I will put

43
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:29,560
forward or I'll show you uh some data to

44
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,040
it but let us before that let us look at

45
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:35,560
what the problem in the modern

46
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,480
agriculture we use more fertilizers and

47
00:02:35,560 --> 00:02:40,680
more pesticide for

48
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,440
what because more fertilizers we give

49
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:44,760
the growth will be better and then you

50
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,360
know production of the crop will be

51
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,440
higher and more pesticide we have to

52
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,560
give because the pest are the are more

53
00:02:50,440 --> 00:02:56,159
increasing at a

54
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:59,239
number because uh as a result that we

55
00:02:56,159 --> 00:03:00,720
are more profit Maniac you know we are

56
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:03,959
want to have

57
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:07,799
more greedy greed greediness has come to

58
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:10,200
our mind too much right and there's a

59
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:13,319
whole world not only in India across

60
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,799
because of this is what you call

61
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:19,760
materialism like as I told earlier

62
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,599
Market materialism makes a man Maniac so

63
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:25,280
we became Maniac you know like for

64
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:28,280
profit man for grabbing all those things

65
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:31,599
are going on in our mind that is a what

66
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:34,439
we call uh Det of mind power to think

67
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,480
which is right which is wrong getting s

68
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:39,239
away so therefore that is the problem

69
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:42,200
and then it is thrust upon us and we are

70
00:03:39,239 --> 00:03:45,239
just not thinking about what and paste

71
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:48,400
and diseases are part and parcel of

72
00:03:45,239 --> 00:03:51,040
nature keep in mind that because one

73
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
person will be relying on other right

74
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,879
and they

75
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,760
balance and so also disease is the thing

76
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,439
to Decay and then you will be going so

77
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,480
this is the part of nature in ide

78
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:06,239
system Natural Balance between predators

79
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:07,640
and past are to be maintained so that

80
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,560
you know each are connected with each

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:13,439
other these are all philosophy what are

82
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,360
embedded in our uh you know uh

83
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:16,600
traditional knowledge system in our

84
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,600
ancient

85
00:04:16,600 --> 00:04:21,880
wisdom and which we need to understand

86
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,360
basic things what we are talking about

87
00:04:21,880 --> 00:04:28,000
here you need to understand the basic

88
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:31,199
laws of nature and then work accordingly

89
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:33,120
not going against and you know uh

90
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
imbalancing or doing something that

91
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:38,680
balance will be broken balance is

92
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:41,199
important because we cannot really look

93
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:43,639
at only small micromanagement the whole

94
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,960
big picture we need to look at it and

95
00:04:43,639 --> 00:04:47,639
big picture are very order and then it

96
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,039
may be looking like a disorder but

97
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:53,720
actually as I told that our civilization

98
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,080
order in disorder and that is natural so

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,000
that has to be looked

100
00:04:55,080 --> 00:05:00,639
at so chemical control that's why we

101
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:03,800
want to have a control over this

102
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,600
uh diseases and also the past so that

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,240
last 40 years you know insecti use have

104
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:10,720
increased

105
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:14,120
10-fold while the crop losses from the

106
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:16,160
past damage have double losses are

107
00:05:14,120 --> 00:05:20,520
increasing and you are increasing that

108
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:23,360
also right insect so one has to look at

109
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,280
that why it is so and as a result the

110
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:29,080
safety of the

111
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,199
people 1 million cases of poisoning by

112
00:05:29,080 --> 00:05:37,240
pesticide each year around the world and

113
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:39,720
up to uh 20,000 of these results in debt

114
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:42,360
this poisoning because of and this

115
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:44,720
number may be more I mean like you know

116
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:47,880
and dates occur in tropical countries

117
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:50,360
where chemical piz which are banned in

118
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:56,440
Europe and other Western countries like

119
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:58,080
USA are still being used in India right

120
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,720
I mean there are several examples I am

121
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,039
not going to look at it and you can see

122
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,039
your for example DDD and then some other

123
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:09,759
thing even Ura people are not but we are

124
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:14,199
using it here in this country so uh and

125
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:18,080
cost of farming increasing at alarming

126
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:21,240
rate and as a result food prices are

127
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:26,280
also being increased very much around

128
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:28,759
300% in last 10 years and if look at we

129
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:31,440
are having a people who are hands to

130
00:06:28,759 --> 00:06:35,000
mouth living like hands to mouth

131
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:37,880
laborers and where they will get the

132
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:40,240
food because the food price are now is

133
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:42,680
comparable to the global global market

134
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:44,800
and earlier days food was very cheaper

135
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:46,800
in this country whenever I visit other

136
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,800
country I feel oh we are safe we are

137
00:06:46,800 --> 00:06:52,160
having at least food a common person can

138
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,280
get today it is not because of

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,440
globalization and you know right and

140
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,120
problem with the industrial agricultural

141
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,720
practice I have already discussed me

142
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:05,039
just uh highlight some of the points

143
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,759
I'll be highlighting more again because

144
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560
I want that some of the things will be

145
00:07:06,759 --> 00:07:10,599
repeative in nature but keep in mind

146
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:12,680
these are important we need to

147
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,560
understand that then only we can take

148
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:17,120
characteristic as I told that

149
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:20,759
monocultures basically the single kind

150
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,560
of crop they use and that erods the

151
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:26,400
biodiversity among both plants and

152
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,800
animals it is not only with the plants

153
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,039
only because all are connected so

154
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:31,840
therefore that is

155
00:07:30,039 --> 00:07:35,280
creating

156
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:38,280
and uh if you look at the nature is

157
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:40,039
always multi layer or you know various

158
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,440
things it's not heterogeneous it's not

159
00:07:40,039 --> 00:07:44,319
homogeneous we trying to make it

160
00:07:42,440 --> 00:07:47,280
homogeneous because in engineering we do

161
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:49,960
that you know but that is not that is a

162
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,919
wrong it is not easier to handle the

163
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:54,000
heten thing you make it homogeneous

164
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,560
therefore you say that no it nature is

165
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,879
other way around it is your limitation

166
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,759
that you are trying to push forward or

167
00:07:58,879 --> 00:08:02,599
the you know thrust upon the people but

168
00:08:00,759 --> 00:08:05,360
you must understand that nature is not

169
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:08,919
like that and there is a strength in

170
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:10,280
that synthetic chemical fertilizers are

171
00:08:08,919 --> 00:08:12,560
being used

172
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:16,960
blatently which

173
00:08:12,560 --> 00:08:19,400
pollute the soil not only the soil water

174
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,759
and air all whatever the environment we

175
00:08:19,400 --> 00:08:24,199
are getting spoiled because of this

176
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:27,440
blatent use of chemical fertiles I'll be

177
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:29,560
showing how it is so and both

178
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:32,479
environment and although not only the

179
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:35,279
human health but also the animal health

180
00:08:32,479 --> 00:08:42,159
plant Health all are being

181
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:48,040
connected so soil which is the soul

182
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:50,839
of infinite lives right and that is

183
00:08:48,040 --> 00:08:53,560
getting uh spoiled you know much faster

184
00:08:50,839 --> 00:08:53,560
than it can be

185
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,360
replen and taking with its land's

186
00:08:56,440 --> 00:09:00,959
fertility the whatever the fertility

187
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:02,720
nutrients the land land the soil is

188
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,640
having it is going

189
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,040
away and which are very important this

190
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:11,399
fertility and nutrients are very

191
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,200
important for the growth of the plants

192
00:09:11,399 --> 00:09:17,240
and those things we eat as a food but

193
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:19,160
those are been getting away you know

194
00:09:17,240 --> 00:09:21,920
I'll be showing you later on like what

195
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:25,760
are the things and I'll also give you

196
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:27,160
data how this most of the civilization

197
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:30,959
got

198
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:34,000
extinguished got spoiled because of soil

199
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,279
quality is going down at that time we

200
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:38,959
need to keep that and maybe in the next

201
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:41,920
class I'll will show you some data and

202
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,839
water is consumed at unsustainable rates

203
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:48,920
in many agricultural areas because water

204
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:53,000
being used too much and it is also uh

205
00:09:48,920 --> 00:09:54,959
helping to take away or leeching out the

206
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:59,440
what do you call this fertility and

207
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:01,880
nutrients which you are adding to the

208
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,839
soil artificially and also the natural

209
00:10:01,880 --> 00:10:06,279
one all are going away so you know you

210
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:09,079
are using because of too much use of

211
00:10:06,279 --> 00:10:11,279
water so effect of pesticides on

212
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:15,640
environment if you look at chemical P

213
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:18,040
can kill useful insects there's a lot of

214
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:20,000
you know microorganism insects are very

215
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,600
useful pollination for pollination we

216
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:24,279
need but they are not you know and if

217
00:10:22,600 --> 00:10:26,360
pollination won't be there then you

218
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:29,000
can't have a food production you may

219
00:10:26,360 --> 00:10:31,120
have very big plants but you don't have

220
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,040
now in Western country people are using

221
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,079
artificial pollination you know like why

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,880
you will do that and cost is in will be

223
00:10:35,079 --> 00:10:40,000
increasing which at the past leading to

224
00:10:37,880 --> 00:10:42,200
the imbalance in nature whole mother

225
00:10:40,000 --> 00:10:44,959
nature is in imbalance you are cutting

226
00:10:42,200 --> 00:10:47,160
the limbs of and you know fingers or you

227
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:51,120
know if look at a body my fingers are

228
00:10:47,160 --> 00:10:52,600
being cut my you know hand being removed

229
00:10:51,120 --> 00:10:55,399
from the mother nature you know Mother

230
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,800
Nature if you considered as a body that

231
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,120
is not the way so therefore you need to

232
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:03,440
look at it

233
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:06,040
and uh as I told earlier artificial

234
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:10,160
chemical can stay in environment in the

235
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:12,160
bodies for a number of years right even

236
00:11:10,160 --> 00:11:15,720
if you won't use it will stay for in

237
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:18,560
your thing for Generation to generation

238
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:20,839
and you cannot really afford to do that

239
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,880
and causing problem for many years it is

240
00:11:20,839 --> 00:11:26,200
not for your generation it is for the

241
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,880
next maybe 5 10 generation will have to

242
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:29,680
suffer because of you have used the

243
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:33,040
chemical fertilizers and which are not

244
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:36,320
good for the health so therefore we need

245
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,839
to understand insect past are very

246
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,680
quickly or over a fear of breeding

247
00:11:38,839 --> 00:11:44,440
Cycles they become resistant to

248
00:11:40,680 --> 00:11:47,040
artificial products they also try to

249
00:11:44,440 --> 00:11:49,120
resist the thing and develop a hormones

250
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:50,680
and other things so that they can

251
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:52,320
because that is the nature nature is

252
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,040
intelligent you know they are working to

253
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,800
go suppose somebody will try to hit you

254
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,560
you will have to protect yourself right

255
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,160
find out ways and means use your mind

256
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,760
use your body use your resources use

257
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,160
your power to do that they are also

258
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:07,519
doing that way okay and are no longer

259
00:12:05,160 --> 00:12:09,800
controlled by the label of chemicals

260
00:12:07,519 --> 00:12:13,000
what we we were using earlier days I'll

261
00:12:09,800 --> 00:12:15,040
be showing you some data as well so if

262
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:16,920
you look at fertilizer consumptions you

263
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,639
look at this in

264
00:12:16,920 --> 00:12:21,639
1960s we are having fertilizer

265
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:25,040
consumption is very very low if you look

266
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:27,240
at this is the color orange color that

267
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:29,600
bound is very very low million tons

268
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:32,639
maybe you know like one or two million

269
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,880
tons and it is goes on increasing and so

270
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,760
also China and then we are because we

271
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:37,560
want to grow at a faster rate than the

272
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,360
other

273
00:12:37,560 --> 00:12:42,680
people and that is the bigger problem

274
00:12:40,360 --> 00:12:45,240
but if you look at America which is a

275
00:12:42,680 --> 00:12:47,399
very intelligent people you know like

276
00:12:45,240 --> 00:12:50,680
they have grown this a higher increase

277
00:12:47,399 --> 00:12:52,920
from 1960 to maybe 80s they realize

278
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:55,240
these are not good and they are almost

279
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:58,040
remaining constant and sometimes going

280
00:12:55,240 --> 00:13:00,120
negative and I do not know the data last

281
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:02,000
maybe 6 seven years

282
00:13:00,120 --> 00:13:05,839
but I'm sure that they might have

283
00:13:02,000 --> 00:13:07,880
decreased it so if you look at we need

284
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,279
to do that we'll have to cut off and

285
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:11,959
then the whole business you know they

286
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:15,279
are sending their multi company to here

287
00:13:11,959 --> 00:13:17,079
to Swindle us and users and then spoiled

288
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,320
we will be intelligent and we should

289
00:13:17,079 --> 00:13:23,160
understand this and then do that so uh

290
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,440
and if you look at we are as we are

291
00:13:23,160 --> 00:13:27,560
using more fertilizers and more

292
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,600
pesticides and other things we are

293
00:13:27,560 --> 00:13:32,480
spoiling also the groundw

294
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:34,199
I was told of course this may not be the

295
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:36,000
correct but you please check don't go by

296
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:39,760
any data I'm giving please correct it

297
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:42,639
check it and then accept it uh in some

298
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,480
newspaper this thing I learned that 60%

299
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:49,560
of groundw in China are not drinkable in

300
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,920
India you think about it my guess is

301
00:13:49,560 --> 00:13:54,480
around maybe 20 to 25% of the at least

302
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,759
in kpur I know there is some area where

303
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:59,600
the water has gone ground water has gone

304
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,959
bad deadly bad

305
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,959
so therefore we need to and uh worry

306
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,759
about that because that sustains the

307
00:14:03,959 --> 00:14:09,000
life and if we spoil the ground letter

308
00:14:06,759 --> 00:14:12,839
and which are interconnected how we are

309
00:14:09,000 --> 00:14:17,920
going to uh what you call correct it or

310
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:20,040
how we are going to um huh replenish how

311
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,399
you do that can you take it out by the

312
00:14:20,040 --> 00:14:25,959
pump and again put it is it possible all

313
00:14:23,399 --> 00:14:29,720
are connected you know like

314
00:14:25,959 --> 00:14:32,199
interconnected right so how will uh you

315
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:34,440
know uh take care of that polluted water

316
00:14:32,199 --> 00:14:37,199
so therefore we'll have to worry about

317
00:14:34,440 --> 00:14:39,399
and if you look at the fertilizer

318
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:42,560
conception I know nitrogen is there is a

319
00:14:39,399 --> 00:14:45,519
phosphatic type and potass potassic type

320
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:48,399
it is all are increasing know in 1991

321
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:51,880
where something 80 in lxs tons you know

322
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:55,440
this is in lcks of tons 80 LHS tons now

323
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:58,560
one in 2007 166 and today maybe it will

324
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,880
be something 175 or maybe 80 I do not

325
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:03,320
know okay okay you please look at it all

326
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,360
are increasing we should decrease it we

327
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:07,240
should at least stabilize it you know

328
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:09,000
because we know it is they are harmful

329
00:15:07,240 --> 00:15:12,000
but still because our people are

330
00:15:09,000 --> 00:15:14,160
illiterate and then so also the thing

331
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:16,880
and the people are using advertisement

332
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:20,000
and other thing to uh what you call Le

333
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:24,480
them for this for the more production

334
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:27,480
and more profit as a tool to em them you

335
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:29,959
know right lure them but all our we are

336
00:15:27,480 --> 00:15:32,399
spoiling the health let us look at how

337
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:36,160
is the food production related to F

338
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:38,959
fertilizer consumptions right so uh if

339
00:15:36,160 --> 00:15:42,639
you look at that this is I've taken the

340
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:45,160
data from 70 to 2002 it's a little old

341
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:48,120
data but let us look at the trend this

342
00:15:45,160 --> 00:15:51,040
blue color is fertilizer consumption

343
00:15:48,120 --> 00:15:53,720
rate it is going up sometimes in 75 it

344
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,360
is gone up above the red line that is

345
00:15:53,720 --> 00:15:58,759
corresponding to the million terms of

346
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:01,560
food production and then if you look at

347
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:05,440
it is uh food production is lower down

348
00:16:01,560 --> 00:16:06,759
at least 95 onwards and the fertilizer

349
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:09,120
consumption is

350
00:16:06,759 --> 00:16:13,680
increasing and let me tell you last year

351
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:17,360
I had gone to some nearby Village in uh

352
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:19,639
kpur where people are you know and then

353
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:21,600
I inquired with the farmers I told what

354
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:24,480
are the consumption they're saying that

355
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:27,800
we are using almost double the

356
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:30,800
fertilizers what we are using 10 years

357
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:34,519
back for get getting the same you know

358
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:36,880
tonage for acre kind of air crop see

359
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:39,160
look at what we are doing that means the

360
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:41,920
soil fertility has gone down and you are

361
00:16:39,160 --> 00:16:45,839
adding more and more and then it will be

362
00:16:41,920 --> 00:16:47,639
spoiling right so therefore the farmer

363
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:50,199
committing suicide because the cost of

364
00:16:47,639 --> 00:16:53,560
farming is increasing at an alarming

365
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:57,600
rate than the what price they can get in

366
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:00,319
in the you know uh what you call

367
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:02,959
Market as a result you know they are in

368
00:17:00,319 --> 00:17:07,679
debt therefore government of India is

369
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:09,919
you know uh what you call uh um taking

370
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:12,039
away their dat in the sense giving the

371
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:16,240
what you call subsidies no not subsidy

372
00:17:12,039 --> 00:17:19,439
it is M like loans waving waving of the

373
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:21,559
loans they waving of the loans but that

374
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:24,000
is not the solution solution has to be

375
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,760
found out looking at what are the causes

376
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,919
of it and then look at fundamentally and

377
00:17:26,760 --> 00:17:31,919
solve the problem and there all of you

378
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:33,440
uh who are listening to these lectures

379
00:17:31,919 --> 00:17:35,160
and then you'll have to come into

380
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:37,720
picture and educate them and also

381
00:17:35,160 --> 00:17:41,799
educate the government about these wrong

382
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:44,000
policies of using these Concepts because

383
00:17:41,799 --> 00:17:47,840
you know we are democracy we should do

384
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:50,160
that and uh the growth is I mean we are

385
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,799
all talking about Green revolutions and

386
00:17:50,160 --> 00:17:53,160
other thing we want to have another

387
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:55,280
Green Revolution people are talking

388
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:59,280
about genetically modified crops and I'm

389
00:17:55,280 --> 00:18:00,600
afraid one should not venture to that

390
00:17:59,280 --> 00:18:02,720
of course there are several reason I'll

391
00:18:00,600 --> 00:18:04,799
be not talking about why you need to but

392
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,480
you'll have to if you are interested get

393
00:18:04,799 --> 00:18:10,320
into that and find it out yourself so

394
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:13,240
the growth rate of the crop production

395
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:16,919
let us look at what happened in our uh

396
00:18:13,240 --> 00:18:20,880
the green reol let us look at that uh

397
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:23,360
this 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 in this diagram for

398
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:26,360
the wi we are talking about preg Green

399
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:29,799
Revolution something 1951 to

400
00:18:26,360 --> 00:18:34,280
1968 we are having something 7 you know

401
00:18:29,799 --> 00:18:37,559
is the tons of this so uh this I have

402
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:40,440
taken the data from the draft of 12 plan

403
00:18:37,559 --> 00:18:43,360
document Delhi Planning Commission and

404
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,320
2013 right so let's say this is the

405
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:47,080
percentage you know what you were having

406
00:18:45,320 --> 00:18:50,840
then it has been decreased in the Green

407
00:18:47,080 --> 00:18:52,600
Revolution period 69 to 81 okay and then

408
00:18:50,840 --> 00:18:54,679
it is again little bit increase up and

409
00:18:52,600 --> 00:18:56,960
then going down and then down again this

410
00:18:54,679 --> 00:18:59,360
thing then again people are increasing

411
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,080
because of in the seventh plan and that

412
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:03,960
is true with if you look at this point

413
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:07,200
you know for the rice for the wheat and

414
00:19:03,960 --> 00:19:10,400
then pulses for oil seeds of course oil

415
00:19:07,200 --> 00:19:14,159
seed has a little bit gone up I mean

416
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:17,520
corresponding to this 1951 and uh the in

417
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:21,440
the today kind today means 11 and

418
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:24,400
12 but uh wheat and rice and pulses you

419
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:27,919
know it is lower than that what it was

420
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:30,120
there in Pre this thing so therefore you

421
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:33,880
can judge from yourself and this data I

422
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:36,360
have taken from this thing that look

423
00:19:33,880 --> 00:19:39,760
this is is a myth that we are having a

424
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,039
Green Revolution okay because the crop

425
00:19:39,760 --> 00:19:44,200
we are putting lot of pesticide lot of

426
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,799
fertilizer and this thing but we are not

427
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,440
growing I of course there is a various

428
00:19:45,799 --> 00:19:50,919
fluctuation depending upon your what we

429
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:53,240
call your uh climates and there

430
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,720
depending upon other parameters you know

431
00:19:53,240 --> 00:19:59,000
that is there so one has to look at data

432
00:19:55,720 --> 00:20:01,280
and analyze it and then only we can say

433
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:04,559
that look there is a green and beside

434
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,799
this we are paying price for the what

435
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,200
for this use of this chemicals

436
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:10,400
fertilizer pesticide spoiling soil air

437
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,159
and everything we'll be talking about

438
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:14,480
what are the problems of chemical

439
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:17,400
fertilizer let us understand

440
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:20,000
that and there is a

441
00:20:17,400 --> 00:20:22,799
micronutrient imbalance because of

442
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:25,039
utilizing the chemical

443
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:28,000
fertilizers because we know that

444
00:20:25,039 --> 00:20:29,799
chemical fertilizers contain nitrogen

445
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:31,000
phosphorus potassium which are

446
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:34,159
micronutrients these are the

447
00:20:31,000 --> 00:20:37,360
micronutrients you know you can think of

448
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:40,200
and excess use of

449
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:43,600
fertilizers during the farming causes

450
00:20:40,200 --> 00:20:45,600
micronutrient imbalance because the soil

451
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,480
you are giving artificial if we giving

452
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:49,080
artificial you know soil will be

453
00:20:47,480 --> 00:20:51,440
imbalanced maybe you are adding more

454
00:20:49,080 --> 00:20:53,720
than what is required so excess of

455
00:20:51,440 --> 00:20:56,520
anything is bad right you need to know

456
00:20:53,720 --> 00:20:59,120
that what are the things and there will

457
00:20:56,520 --> 00:21:01,240
be also imbalance because of

458
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:02,960
root will be taking and then it will be

459
00:21:01,240 --> 00:21:05,679
not taking all the thing it will be

460
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:09,080
remaining I'll be talking about later on

461
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:11,520
about you know like uh root how they

462
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:13,880
take and what will be the size of roots

463
00:21:11,520 --> 00:21:16,320
if we use chemical fertilizer if you use

464
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:17,880
natural farming all those things I'll be

465
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,919
talking about a little bit later on

466
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:23,440
particularly when I'll go to the Natural

467
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:25,840
farming excess isop part affect the soil

468
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:28,200
fertility adversely and also the

469
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:30,039
productivity as I told just now that

470
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:33,039
which my own experience talking with the

471
00:21:30,039 --> 00:21:35,120
farmers nearby the Cano area they're

472
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:36,960
saying they're using large number of you

473
00:21:35,120 --> 00:21:39,360
know large amount of fertilizer for the

474
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:42,679
same amount of crop production in the

475
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:44,440
same land right over the years and that

476
00:21:42,679 --> 00:21:46,400
is true that you can see I mean you can

477
00:21:44,440 --> 00:21:48,880
ask anybody and you are having also data

478
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:50,640
nowadays internet you can get the data

479
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:52,840
and uh maybe from reliable source

480
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:55,240
because internet one has to be careful

481
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:56,799
about data right you can go to the

482
00:21:55,240 --> 00:21:58,000
government sources some other things

483
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:59,279
then you can find it out what are the

484
00:21:58,000 --> 00:22:01,679
conceptions you know I have shown you

485
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:03,799
already that so there is a nitrate

486
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,559
pollution like excess nitrogen

487
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:08,640
nitrogenous fertilizers Lee deep into

488
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:10,799
the soil because you are using a lot of

489
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:13,200
water also irrigation you know like and

490
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:16,440
there is a groundwater you are using

491
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:18,960
using the pump you know power right

492
00:22:16,440 --> 00:22:21,919
electricity and then Diesel and the lift

493
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,919
irrigation system has now come up right

494
00:22:21,919 --> 00:22:27,039
and you just press a button and then

495
00:22:23,919 --> 00:22:29,440
water will be spread over this thing so

496
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:31,720
and it is sometimes I have seen at least

497
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,480
in the nearby kpur area that is they use

498
00:22:31,720 --> 00:22:36,960
a lot of water unne and that can

499
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:38,919
contaminate the ground water also and

500
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:41,360
that is happening in lot of areas and

501
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:44,279
other water bodies nearby is being

502
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,200
spoiled by the in know nitris fertilizer

503
00:22:44,279 --> 00:22:49,240
and if the concentration of nitrate in

504
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:53,279
the drinking water exceed 25 mgam per

505
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:55,919
lit it affects mortality rate and the

506
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:59,120
low weight of the newborn babies which

507
00:22:55,919 --> 00:23:02,720
is basically these uh you know low

508
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,840
weight and thing known as a blue baby

509
00:23:02,720 --> 00:23:08,360
syndromes right and which is showing

510
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:12,120
I'll show you a diagram maybe uh next

511
00:23:08,360 --> 00:23:15,960
slides that um and blue baby syndrome

512
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:18,799
refers to at least two situation one is

513
00:23:15,960 --> 00:23:21,159
Coptic heart means you know there will

514
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,279
be heart arteries which will be you know

515
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:26,400
big thicker and then will be thinner

516
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:28,919
that problem will be there and this memo

517
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:31,640
glob Mia that means like an you know

518
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,120
like blood will be less and then now it

519
00:23:31,640 --> 00:23:36,039
will be little bit different than that

520
00:23:34,120 --> 00:23:39,279
so this causes a problem in the blood

521
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,559
itself so you can look at this term I'm

522
00:23:39,279 --> 00:23:44,559
not uh you know sure about that but you

523
00:23:41,559 --> 00:23:46,440
look at that so what is that I mean this

524
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:48,360
is causing problem which will be with

525
00:23:46,440 --> 00:23:51,240
the baby itself you know then where

526
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:53,200
you'll go right so these are very

527
00:23:51,240 --> 00:23:55,640
serious problem of the blue baby

528
00:23:53,200 --> 00:23:56,960
syndromes and there is another problem

529
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:59,559
which come

530
00:23:56,960 --> 00:24:01,320
eutrophication utopic app basically when

531
00:23:59,559 --> 00:24:03,760
you use excess

532
00:24:01,320 --> 00:24:08,440
fertilizer that can pass to the nearby

533
00:24:03,760 --> 00:24:11,320
water bod bodies okay and as a result

534
00:24:08,440 --> 00:24:14,760
this there will be over nourishments in

535
00:24:11,320 --> 00:24:17,600
this uh pond water bodies and which is

536
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:19,720
known as UT

537
00:24:17,600 --> 00:24:21,400
tropication because the over Nish if

538
00:24:19,720 --> 00:24:25,120
overnourishment will be there then what

539
00:24:21,400 --> 00:24:27,039
will happen that the algae you know

540
00:24:25,120 --> 00:24:30,279
there will be lot of growth in algae at

541
00:24:27,039 --> 00:24:31,200
the faster rate and then they will grow

542
00:24:30,279 --> 00:24:33,520
very

543
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,520
rapidly right and then again they will

544
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:40,320
die and then as a result because their

545
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:42,360
life is sought and they die and pollute

546
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:44,600
the water affecting the Aquatic Life

547
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:47,360
adversely that you might have seen that

548
00:24:44,600 --> 00:24:49,799
in your you know observation if you are

549
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,360
having good observation see the cause is

550
00:24:49,799 --> 00:24:53,520
this one so therefore these causes and

551
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:55,960
that is the

552
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,480
problem if you look at this pesticide

553
00:24:55,960 --> 00:25:01,320
there are two kinds of pesticide people

554
00:24:57,480 --> 00:25:04,000
use First genertion pesticide use sulfur

555
00:25:01,320 --> 00:25:06,080
arsenic lead and mercury to kill pest

556
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:08,480
look at these are all you know dangerous

557
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:10,320
you elements on should have it but we

558
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:13,360
are using the second generation of

559
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:17,520
course the DDT what is dor dile Tri

560
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:21,559
chloro ethen used to kill pasts and

561
00:25:17,520 --> 00:25:24,559
these P organic nature of course but uh

562
00:25:21,559 --> 00:25:26,720
P protect our C from severe losses due

563
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:28,399
to pest but they have several side

564
00:25:26,720 --> 00:25:30,320
effects you know you can think of there

565
00:25:28,399 --> 00:25:33,720
several side effect it should not be

566
00:25:30,320 --> 00:25:37,880
used as such and side effects of pite as

567
00:25:33,720 --> 00:25:40,440
I told that basically that of non-target

568
00:25:37,880 --> 00:25:42,600
organisms suppose you want to kill X but

569
00:25:40,440 --> 00:25:45,039
now you'll be killing y j and you know

570
00:25:42,600 --> 00:25:47,120
other things and which are beneficial so

571
00:25:45,039 --> 00:25:49,440
several insect kill not only the target

572
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,159
space but also the several

573
00:25:49,440 --> 00:25:56,559
beneficial and organism which are not of

574
00:25:53,159 --> 00:25:59,640
Target and as I told that after you know

575
00:25:56,559 --> 00:26:01,760
use this P past several time the people

576
00:25:59,640 --> 00:26:04,640
the those are also living organism they

577
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:07,039
try to resist and certain Pest of course

578
00:26:04,640 --> 00:26:09,320
certain things may not resist properly

579
00:26:07,039 --> 00:26:12,600
but certain pests that could manage to

580
00:26:09,320 --> 00:26:14,440
survive became highly resistant to all

581
00:26:12,600 --> 00:26:17,159
kinds of pesticides you know and though

582
00:26:14,440 --> 00:26:19,559
these past are called as super pest like

583
00:26:17,159 --> 00:26:23,520
super man you know they become super

584
00:26:19,559 --> 00:26:25,840
past so and biomagnifications is another

585
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,640
thing most P

586
00:26:25,840 --> 00:26:30,440
nonbiodegradable right it's not it

587
00:26:27,640 --> 00:26:32,679
cannot be deg ated by the soil or other

588
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:34,600
things so get into food chain which is

589
00:26:32,679 --> 00:26:35,760
known as bio accumulation it will

590
00:26:34,600 --> 00:26:38,880
getting

591
00:26:35,760 --> 00:26:40,960
accumulated and these pesticides in BIO

592
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:42,760
accumulation form are harmful to the

593
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:45,080
human beings and as I told it will

594
00:26:42,760 --> 00:26:47,279
remain for your body chain you know

595
00:26:45,080 --> 00:26:50,039
chain chain food chain for several time

596
00:26:47,279 --> 00:26:52,200
also in your own body right and it will

597
00:26:50,039 --> 00:26:54,720
be transmitted you know various forms

598
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:56,919
and surface and groundwater pollution uh

599
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:59,320
you know like toxicity to Aquatic

600
00:26:56,919 --> 00:27:02,240
wildlife and human through drinking

601
00:26:59,320 --> 00:27:04,919
Waters right all those things risk of

602
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:07,200
cancers like uh pesticide enhances the

603
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:10,440
risk of getting cancer in two way it

604
00:27:07,200 --> 00:27:12,960
acts as a carcinogen also and it

605
00:27:10,440 --> 00:27:14,880
indirectly spoil the immune system you

606
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:17,279
might be aware that is a train known as

607
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,880
cancer train which is originated from

608
00:27:17,279 --> 00:27:21,520
Punjab you are aware all of you there's

609
00:27:19,880 --> 00:27:23,440
a train all cancer patient will be

610
00:27:21,520 --> 00:27:26,520
coming you know that's why people call

611
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:28,640
it cancer because in Punjab Arana region

612
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:31,520
they're using this pesticide and

613
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:33,640
fertilizer to larger extent they can say

614
00:27:31,520 --> 00:27:36,320
the rice what we call wheat bow or the

615
00:27:33,640 --> 00:27:38,520
food bowel of India but they are really

616
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,159
spoiling their own health and giving us

617
00:27:38,520 --> 00:27:42,760
food and that is also not of good

618
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,000
quality so I'll will stop over here and

619
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:48,440
we'll be looking at

620
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:51,840
the uh what you call disadvantages or

621
00:27:48,440 --> 00:27:54,200
the of the using this modern uh farming

622
00:27:51,840 --> 00:27:56,080
in the next lecture and later on I will

623
00:27:54,200 --> 00:27:58,880
tell about like what is the quality of

624
00:27:56,080 --> 00:28:01,799
food we are using

625
00:27:58,880 --> 00:28:04,360
and then we'll be looking at basically

626
00:28:01,799 --> 00:28:06,840
why we need to go for the ancient

627
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,110
technology for the agriculture thank you

628
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:19,270
very much
