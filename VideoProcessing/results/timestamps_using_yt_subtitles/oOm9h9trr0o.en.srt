1
00:00:00,840 --> 00:00:06,200
hey it's Matt from McGee farms and got

2
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,880
into the winter time now had a pretty

3
00:00:06,200 --> 00:00:10,599
good first year with the garden here but

4
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:13,719
I think we're going to revamp a few

5
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,760
things we made a few mistakes that uh I

6
00:00:13,719 --> 00:00:19,920
think I'm going to try to try to fix but

7
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:23,279
also uh in the winter time we're going

8
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:27,359
to try some uh cold weather vegetables

9
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,920
broccoli carrots lettuce uh some of that

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,759
and with doing that I've got some PVC

11
00:00:30,920 --> 00:00:36,239
pipes that I'm going to cut down and I

12
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:37,640
have these brackets right here that uh

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,239
I'm going to use and I'm going to make

14
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:42,680
some hoops for these and with making the

15
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,440
Hoops we're going to put some uh clear

16
00:00:42,680 --> 00:00:47,800
plastic over it too and just keep it a

17
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:49,960
little bit warmer because this is a

18
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,920
pretty you know colder colder climate

19
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:55,840
here in northeastern Missouri and uh

20
00:00:52,920 --> 00:00:59,000
we'll see how the Winter Garden go so uh

21
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,840
first off I'm going to mount these on

22
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:05,000
the sides and and then I'm going to cut

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:09,040
these uh this/ in schedule 40 pipe down

24
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:09,040
and make some make some

25
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:18,040
hoops so I got the first one in and

26
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:23,200
mounted and this is uh 31 in

27
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:25,040
wide and I cut it at 6t and I think I

28
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:29,200
probably probably would have been okay

29
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:31,759
at 5T I think with the if I do the other

30
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:35,600
bed I'm going to go at 5T just because

31
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:37,880
the PVC is 10t and that way I can use uh

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:42,439
two sections for each pipe rather than

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:44,960
having to waste 4T of it but I've got

34
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:46,680
got that in it really wasn't too bad

35
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,840
bending and getting it in especially

36
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:50,479
being chilly out here I was afraid the

37
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,439
cold might make it a little hard to get

38
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,560
in so I'm going to get the rest of them

39
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:56,600
going to do

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,560
another I think I'm going to try three

41
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:03,759
on here see how that works I might have

42
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:06,039
to come back and do to four per 8T bed

43
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:10,319
and uh of course the lovely thing

44
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,319
putting these brackets in I just uh

45
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:16,040
cleaned out the horse stall and brought

46
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:18,680
the uh leftovers down here so uh now I'm

47
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:20,640
getting to work in that but you know it

48
00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:23,800
is what it is it's a good free

49
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,840
fertilizer so I can't complain so I'm

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:26,680
going to start putting the rest of these

51
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:27,800
brackets in and get the rest of the

52
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:29,800
Hoops

53
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:33,120
done so I've got a couple of the hoop

54
00:02:29,800 --> 00:02:35,040
Loops up right now it's an 8T section

55
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,640
I'm going to try with three see if

56
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:40,159
that's strong enough I may have to come

57
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,760
back and put a fourth one in as well uh

58
00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,400
went ahead and I planted some winter

59
00:02:42,760 --> 00:02:46,920
vegetables in here I've got some carrots

60
00:02:45,400 --> 00:02:49,360
I've got some lettuce I've got some

61
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:52,680
broccoli green

62
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,080
onions uh I think that's all I got in

63
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:57,000
right now the winter vegetables that's

64
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,640
about the only ones we we really eat I

65
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,519
mean we don't eat kale we don't eat

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,159
cabbage so uh so figure we'll try it I

67
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:08,959
bought some

68
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:11,000
uh plastic at a Home

69
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:15,720
Depot I don't know if how it's going to

70
00:03:11,000 --> 00:03:17,760
hold up or not it's a 3.5 mil just clear

71
00:03:15,720 --> 00:03:20,360
uh plastic sheeting for like a painter's

72
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:22,239
drop cloth so I'm getting ready to put

73
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:25,000
it on I'm just going to staple it down

74
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,760
to the uh top boards see if that's going

75
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:31,159
to hold it

76
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,000
or if uh the wind's just going to rip

77
00:03:31,159 --> 00:03:34,840
that off and I'm going to have to put

78
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,200
some little T some little boards on top

79
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:39,200
of it so we'll see I'm getting ready to

80
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,120
do that now and I'll show you the

81
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:41,840
finished product here in just a couple

82
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:45,959
of

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,959
minutes meanwhile enjoy some

84
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,319
goats all right so I've got it down in

85
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:54,599
there and what I uh kind of did I'm

86
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,200
going to work on a little more is on the

87
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,079
sides where I have the uh these

88
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,840
trellises that I made out of the cattle

89
00:03:59,079 --> 00:04:05,519
panels I'm kind of working them in there

90
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:09,040
to kind of Hope help hold them down in

91
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:12,120
there and I took a staple gun I went

92
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:15,919
around on this side and just stapled it

93
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:19,519
down really good over

94
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:21,000
here I uh I kind of bunched it up and

95
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,080
tied it all

96
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:25,680
together uh probably going to have to

97
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,800
tie it down just a little bit

98
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,240
better but uh I got thinking I'm like

99
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,759
and I did stay pull it down in there but

100
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:35,199
when I got over here I got thinking I'm

101
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,360
going to have to get in there some way

102
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:41,440
to harvest them and then plant more so

103
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:43,680
what I did is I found a 1 by two that I

104
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:46,720
had that have been sitting in the barn

105
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:51,600
forever and I wrapped the plastic

106
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,320
sheeting up with the 1 by two and uh and

107
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,600
rolled it up till it got to about where

108
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:58,960
the edges and then I use the staple gun

109
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
to kind of staple it down as well and by

110
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,919
doing that that should hopefully hold it

111
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,520
it's going to sit on there and uh

112
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:08,400
hopefully that'll keep it from going up

113
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:11,800
and then whenever I want in

114
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,160
there I can I can get in there a little

115
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,639
bit I'm going to have to adjust it a

116
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:19,160
little bit but we're going to try this

117
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:21,479
out see how it goes I've got the uh

118
00:05:19,160 --> 00:05:25,440
other one over there that I'm going to

119
00:05:21,479 --> 00:05:27,960
do the same thing with and uh I've got

120
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,319
on the end down here we're going to

121
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:32,240
expand it out I've got some 10 put

122
00:05:30,319 --> 00:05:35,479
2x4s uh we're going to go down a little

123
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,520
more put some more arches uh trellises

124
00:05:35,479 --> 00:05:39,080
whatever you want to call them uh put a

125
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:40,919
few more of these and because it worked

126
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:43,240
really good we just didn't have enough

127
00:05:40,919 --> 00:05:46,680
space and so I'm getting ready to start

128
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,960
