1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
about 3 years ago I bought the paperpot

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:07,120
transplanter system to use in my no till

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,400
deep compost mulch Market Garden the

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:10,280
first time I used a paper pot

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,080
transplanter it was for beets and I

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:13,480
threw the tray in the trees back there I

7
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:16,240
was pissed I couldn't believe I spent

8
00:00:13,480 --> 00:00:18,640
$3,000 on this thing and the first time

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:21,000
I used it wasn't burying them the the

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,160
plants were getting twisted around each

11
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:25,560
other basically it was Beats so like as

12
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,519
the Paper Pot transplanter unraveled

13
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:29,480
they were a little bit leggy and it just

14
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:31,080
tore the plants apart it was a complete

15
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,480
disaster but my friend Paul from

16
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,399
Mountain Roots Farm has been a good

17
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:36,920
Mentor to me over the years called him

18
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:38,640
talked to him about it I was like man

19
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,879
this thing sucks like what the heck and

20
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
he's like ah yeah man you just got to

21
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:45,520
keep practicing right like it's a tool

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,280
and it takes system there has to be some

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
sort of soil work to get the tool to

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,440
work properly I I suppose everybody's

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,239
going to have different soil conditions

26
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,039
but in this video I'm going to show you

27
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:58,800
the exact system that I use to use the

28
00:00:56,039 --> 00:01:01,079
Paper Pot transplanter in a no till deep

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,160
compost mulch system so in my last video

30
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:05,239
I showed you guys how I start seedlings

31
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,320
in my basement under grow lights using

32
00:01:05,239 --> 00:01:09,759
the quick click drop seeder into the

33
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:11,400
paper pot transplanter system so these

34
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,320
are the same seedlings it's a couple

35
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,439
weeks later now and today we're going to

36
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:17,479
transplant these into my noil garden and

37
00:01:16,439 --> 00:01:19,240
I'm just going to show you the whole

38
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,000
process and how it works in my system

39
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,159
they've been sitting out here for about

40
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,280
2 weeks now leaving them sit out here

41
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:28,079
for a couple of weeks before I actually

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,560
plant them into the garden helps them to

43
00:01:28,079 --> 00:01:32,240
harden off so that

44
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:34,720
they'll survive when I plant them it has

45
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,680
to be soaking wet or else when you like

46
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:38,600
start to use the transplanter and pull

47
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:40,759
it these paper chains are just going to

48
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:43,680
rip so you want to saturate the whole

49
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:45,079
tray in water before you plant it and

50
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,960
that's something that like nobody ever

51
00:01:45,079 --> 00:01:48,680
told me before I used it the first time

52
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,320
I used the Paper Pot transplanter I just

53
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:52,799
took my tray and then I tried to

54
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,920
transplant it and they just kept ripping

55
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,960
the whole way down and I couldn't find

56
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:58,600
any good resources to tell me why but I

57
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:00,439
learned that that's why you have to

58
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:02,320
saturate the whole TR

59
00:02:00,439 --> 00:02:06,320
in water and the way that I do that this

60
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:08,280
is like a 18x 26 in uh commercial cookie

61
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,800
sheet basically but it just happens to

62
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,480
fit these Paper Pot trays perfectly so I

63
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,239
just sit the trays in that and then I

64
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,599
fill it up with water and then I just

65
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
let them bottom water and soak all that

66
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,040
water up and it doesn't take long these

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,480
things soak the water up super fast and

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,319
so I'll just let that sit there and soak

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,400
up the water while I get everything set

70
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,879
up with the transplanter to plant and

71
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:30,000
then we'll come back and grab that in a

72
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:31,760
minute so then the typical bed flip

73
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,879
method that I'm using is we clean out

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:35,720
the previous crop I String up the beds

75
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,200
to keep the beds straight and looking

76
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,720
nice we broad for the beds so we put

77
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:42,519
about three wheelbarrows of compost on

78
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,360
every bed flip that we're going to use

79
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:46,800
the pap poot transplanter next on and

80
00:02:44,360 --> 00:02:50,280
then I used the never syn icono class

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,400
tilter to smooth out that top layer of

82
00:02:50,280 --> 00:02:55,159
compost so it's never actually like

83
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,720
tilling the soil at all it just like

84
00:02:55,159 --> 00:02:59,280
gets all the chunks out of the compost

85
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:01,239
sometimes it's chunky and those chunks

86
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,159
will get like jammed up in the furrow

87
00:03:01,239 --> 00:03:05,040
the Paper Pot transplant so you need to

88
00:03:03,159 --> 00:03:07,000
make sure that your compost is nice

89
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,560
broken down and fine or it's going to

90
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:10,599
cause you problems you can't have rocks

91
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,280
in there and then after we tilt it then

92
00:03:10,599 --> 00:03:14,480
we come through with just a regular like

93
00:03:12,280 --> 00:03:17,319
garden rake that you would use to rake

94
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:19,560
your garden with leaves and we make it

95
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:22,799
nice and smooth so we make kind of a

96
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:25,480
raised nice smooth planting bed at a

97
00:03:22,799 --> 00:03:27,920
compost while never actually tilling the

98
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:29,920
soil and we use a broad Fork to just

99
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:32,319
make sure that the soil is not compacted

100
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,840
I find that the broad Fork uh just kind

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,799
of helps the furrow get through the

102
00:03:34,840 --> 00:03:41,000
compost and be able to just kind of

103
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:42,519
barely dig into the actual native soil

104
00:03:41,000 --> 00:03:44,319
so that the roots are getting into the

105
00:03:42,519 --> 00:03:46,519
soil but then the actual plants are just

106
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,720
like kind of planted through the compost

107
00:03:46,519 --> 00:03:50,640
and then it grows down through the

108
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,760
compost into the native soil and the

109
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,640
compost basically just a mulch on top of

110
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,239
the soil and then generally after we'll

111
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,319
Harvest a bed like that like these were

112
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,920
Paper Pot transplanted right right and

113
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:04,959
then we've got two rows of Salen NOA

114
00:04:02,920 --> 00:04:07,280
lettuce on the sides of tomatoes once

115
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,640
these beds are terminated we'll just uh

116
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,519
not broad fork or anything and just

117
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:13,680
plant arugula probably we'll just direct

118
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:16,359
seed arugula and then so that's kind of

119
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:18,600
like the bed prep system we broad fork

120
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:19,880
and apply new compost whenever we're

121
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:22,079
going to be using the paper pot

122
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:23,759
transplanter and then those beds are are

123
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:25,759
good because the next crops we're not

124
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,240
going to be planting salanova lettuce

125
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,000
over and over in the same beds we're

126
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:32,440
going to be doing like a rugula or

127
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,400
spinach or tomatoes or whatever the next

128
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:35,960
crop is it doesn't require the Paper Pot

129
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:37,960
transplanter so we're really only broad

130
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:39,520
forking if we're using the paperpot

131
00:04:37,960 --> 00:04:41,199
transplanter just kind of make sure that

132
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:43,199
we're breaking up the compaction because

133
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:45,199
I just find if I don't then I regret it

134
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,000
you just need to do the proper bed prep

135
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,560
basically but then you have to have your

136
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,759
plants or your seedlings like exactly

137
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,120
the right size there's a perfect size so

138
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:55,560
for me I start my trays of salanova

139
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,360
lettuce and that's basically the only

140
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,880
crop I'm using a paper pot transplanter

141
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,639
for I don't really find it to be

142
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,400
profitable for a lot of other things cuz

143
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:04,000
there's a huge cost you don't want to

144
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:06,240
use a Pap poot transplanter if they're

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:08,160
too small wheels like bury the furrow it

146
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:10,400
like will bury the plant but then if

147
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:12,759
they're too big the bottom sides of the

148
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,919
tray The Roots will get tangled with

149
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:18,280
each other so when you drag it the roots

150
00:05:14,919 --> 00:05:20,280
are not letting it unravel correctly so

151
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:22,600
while it does transplant well like that

152
00:05:20,280 --> 00:05:24,759
because the furrow can close the

153
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:27,240
overgrown seedling in a little bit it

154
00:05:24,759 --> 00:05:29,280
won't unravel well so it pops up out so

155
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:31,720
all I do is just kind of you have to

156
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,479
like them apart and like kind of stage

157
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,000
them and then I can pull it and then

158
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:37,160
it's not really a big deal and it goes

159
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,160
pretty fast like that but it's like it

160
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:40,520
took me some time to learn that and

161
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:43,120
that's something that nobody really

162
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:44,720
talks about on YouTube videos I just was

163
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,600
left to kind of learn these things by

164
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,880
myself and observation and there's

165
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:51,319
adjustments on the tool to adjust it up

166
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,560
and down you can adjust the the wheels

167
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:56,000
you have to fool with the adjustments on

168
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:59,160
like the depth of how deep you're

169
00:05:56,000 --> 00:06:00,919
planting it how it berries the seedlings

170
00:05:59,160 --> 00:06:02,479
after they're transplanted into the

171
00:06:00,919 --> 00:06:04,160
furrow and that's going to be different

172
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:05,919
for everybody's soil conditions I have

173
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,360
mine set up so I just leave it the same

174
00:06:05,919 --> 00:06:09,520
I don't fool with it but it took a lot

175
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,360
of fooling with to get it just right I

176
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:14,199
had a bed of cilantro which had been

177
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:15,759
Paper Pot transplanted so I just went

178
00:06:14,199 --> 00:06:18,000
and like cleaned out the whole bed of

179
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,800
cilantro I left like the roots and

180
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:21,800
everything right in the ground so I just

181
00:06:19,800 --> 00:06:23,880
like cut the bottoms off cleared out the

182
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,440
bed I didn't put any additional compost

183
00:06:23,880 --> 00:06:27,199
or anything and I just tried to drag the

184
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,680
paperpot transplanter through but it

185
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,680
didn't work very good because it get

186
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:33,560
caught on the roof RO system of the

187
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,520
cilantro to use the paper pot

188
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:38,440
transplanter after a crop like cilantro

189
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:40,319
didn't work very good for me cilantro

190
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,520
just has like a really big root system

191
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:44,520
but for me to like use the paper pot

192
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:49,280
transplanter after I harvest the bed of

193
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,280
carrots like that's ideal right
