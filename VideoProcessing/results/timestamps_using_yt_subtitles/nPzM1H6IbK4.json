  "text": "[Music] hello and welcome to wholesome roots today I'm going to tell you my five reasons why quail are better than chickens on the homestead reason number one they're super easy these quail cages are designed for comfort and ease for both the birds and the bird handlers they are perfectly constructed so that you don't have to move them every day and like I have to do with the chicken tractors or if you're free-ranging letting them out every day putting them back in every day and you hear that that's a quail crow and I find it much more pleasing than a rooster crow reason number two it is much cleaner and neater with quail they mainly go in the bowl and eat all of it out from inside the bowl occasionally some will splash out my but my Ducks make quick work of that and the beauty of it is they don't leave any behind and waste it like chickens do it's also a much smaller volume of food to feed quail than it is to feed chickens those things will keep eating forever and ever-- sometimes and they always seem like they're starving the quail seem content with a small scoop of food every morning then there's the cleanup being able to consolidate all of the manure in one place and it's a dry manure it's not wet and soupy like chicken manure is so it's very easy to shovel this add it to your compost or use it for your garden remember always age and compost your manure before using it in your garden for vegetables with chickens you'll end up with coop almost anywhere especially if they're free-range on your porch on your sidewalk in between your toes when you walk barefoot I'm not a fan of that but with the quail it's easy simple and ready to be made into compost for my garden fourth is speed the speed in which it takes to hatch out the eggs is some of the fastest there are only three weeks to hatch whereas chicken and ducks and turkey could be much longer 21 to 28 days for them but with quail you have new babies in three weeks then when during the brooding process of raising these chicks they are full-grown at six weeks you can stretch them at six weeks old they begin laying eggs at six weeks old it is the fastest turnaround for meat in eggs than any animal that I know of for homestead use and at ten to twelve weeks they're ready to harvest whereas chickens you have to wait six months or more sometimes for the heritage breeds I find it a much easier circumstances to have these quick turnaround easy food in our kitchen so number five is the easy one sustainability sustainability is very important to us on our homestead and quail are far more superior sustainable resource they don't waste as much they don't take as much time out of our day to take care of they hardly have any work that we need to do outside of feed water and gathering the eggs it makes it quite easy for us to have a sustainable meat source and egg source on our homestead that right there that's my bonus reason why quail are better than chickens granted you don't have to have a rooster but if you're planning on hatching out fertile eggs having a rooster is a necessity and the rooster crow for quail is much more pleasant and soft that can get on your nerves so tell me what are your reasons for keeping quail how do you find them to be superior to other poultry and if you haven't started keeping quail why not what are you waiting for I hope that this video gives you some insight in hope and gives you an idea of how easy it is to take care of quail and how sustainable they are for your homestead [Music] [Music]",
