1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:09,400
This list of mistakes is prepared when analyzing the statistics of questions on social networks, when an amateur asks us for help

2
00:00:09,400 --> 00:00:14,303
From year to year, the top five is constant and does not change.

3
00:00:14,303 --> 00:00:18,000
The first mistake: planting a cactus whenever you want.

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:24,620
80% of cacti and other succulents are bought in autumn, winter, and spring.

5
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,380
Usually, the seller can simultaneously sell you a pot and a soil mixture.

6
00:00:30,380 --> 00:00:37,490
And then most of us almost immediately run to transplant the plant, not paying attention to the season of the year.

7
00:00:37,490 --> 00:00:46,671
If the transplanting is carried out during the time period from October to February, then there is a very high probability that the plant will die.

8
00:00:46,671 --> 00:00:55,716
This period in the temperate zone is characterized by insufficient intensity of illumination and a short duration of daylight hours.

9
00:00:55,716 --> 00:01:02,760
In such conditions, the roots will not be able to develop and absorb water from the soil mixture.

10
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,340
In consequence, the plant will suffer from the so-called "wet-feet" effect.

11
00:01:08,340 --> 00:01:14,900
As a result, the roots will rot, and over time, the above-ground part of the plant will be affected.

12
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:20,320
The 2nd mistake: planting the cactus in a container that is too large.

13
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,380
The majority of plants are grown and subsequently sold in technical pots -

14
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:28,300
containers with brown or black color.

15
00:01:28,300 --> 00:01:33,640
In most cases, the pot for transplanting is selected based on design features

16
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:35,940
or from what is available on the market.

17
00:01:36,380 --> 00:01:40,220
The size of the pot is usually chosen by amateurs like this

18
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,140
They say: "The main thing is to get roots into the pot"

19
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:52,020
As a result, you look at the so-called comp. and you see a huge pot of soil and a small plant, which is lost in it

20
00:01:52,620 --> 00:01:57,480
The properly sized pot is the same as the one in which the plant grows

21
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,000
or 10-15% more volume than previous one.

22
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,180
Follow the rule: as a result we should enjoy the beauty of the plant and not a pot with the soil mixture.

23
00:02:09,620 --> 00:02:14,340
The next mistake: using wrong soil mixtures for planting a cactus

24
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:18,460
"soil mix under the tree, based on peat" and so on

25
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:26,040
All soil mixtures should be sterilized before planting a cactus into them, very few people do it in practice.

26
00:02:26,300 --> 00:02:32,700
Even a peat mixture, which theoretically should have no pests and diseases, has both of them.

27
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:37,500
A probability of having something harmful to the plant exists everywhere

28
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,660
For example, in turf ground, sand, mineral curbs, moss and so on.

29
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:48,380
If the mixture has a strong deviation of acidity from the recommended

30
00:02:48,380 --> 00:02:53,460
the plant will immediately begin to suffer after planting it in such a mixture.

31
00:02:53,740 --> 00:03:00,740
Properly made mixture is a guarantee of good development of cacti for several years without transplanting.

32
00:03:01,140 --> 00:03:06,680
The mixture that we offer has all the properties that are necessary for cacti.

33
00:03:06,780 --> 00:03:12,460
It is sterilized and has a lot of nutrients. It does not require additional drainage.

34
00:03:12,460 --> 00:03:18,620
You can learn more information about making it from our video. The link is in the description below.

35
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,840
The next mistake: watering a cactus whenever you want

36
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:29,020
A lot of amateurs think that regular watering is the main rule for the care of the plant.

37
00:03:29,220 --> 00:03:33,800
As a result, such plant often dies after a couple of weeks.

38
00:03:33,940 --> 00:03:37,780
Many of succulents need to be watered once a month at most.

39
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:41,980
The frequency of watering varies depending on the season of the year.

40
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:46,720
When you buy a plant, it is preferable to learn its specific features.

41
00:03:46,840 --> 00:03:50,840
Even if you don't know what kind or family it belongs to

42
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:54,960
you can place its photo in a social network in an appropriate group

43
00:03:55,020 --> 00:04:00,460
and you will be given a piece of advice on how the plant is called and how to water it.

44
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,220
And the final mistake is: "The more light and higher temp. - the better it is for the plant"

45
00:04:07,520 --> 00:04:11,280
"Cactus comes from a desert, so the sun doesn't scare it"

46
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,380
It is a common misconception among the amateurs.

47
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:17,900
That's true! Most cacti come from deserts

48
00:04:17,900 --> 00:04:21,780
but in natural conditions cactus grows on the slope of the rock

49
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:25,940
and it hides in shadow ofthe rock in the hottest time of the day.

50
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,000
Or, for example, it can grow among thorns that also scatter sunlight.

51
00:04:31,300 --> 00:04:37,860
Moreover, in natural habitat the sky is covered with clouds that reduce lighting in the daytime.

52
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:40,380
And what the conditions are we creating?

53
00:04:40,380 --> 00:04:43,720
We put the pot with the plant on sthe southern window

54
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:51,020
and as a result, the midday heat combined with the strongest radiation puts our cactus into a state of shock.

55
00:04:51,020 --> 00:04:55,920
In addition to this, direct sunlight overheats the pot and the roots in it.

56
00:04:56,020 --> 00:05:00,500
The subsequent frequent watering makes the situation even worse.

57
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:04,700
Roots under stress conditions are not capable of absorbing water

58
00:05:04,700 --> 00:05:07,280
Ss they will rot in wet soil mixture.

59
00:05:07,640 --> 00:05:15,440
Almost all succulents develop vegetatively at the temperature range from +15-30 C.

60
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,160
All values that go beyond this range, put the plant under stress.
