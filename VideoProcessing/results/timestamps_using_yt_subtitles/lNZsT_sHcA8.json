  "text": "welcome back to Modern Agri machines today we're diving into the fascinating world of onion farming from planting to harvest and finally to processing let's see how onions make their way from the field to your plate let's get started onions are grown worldwide with the largest producers being China India and the United States these countries cultivate millions of tons annually providing iding a massive contribution to the global economy not only are onions crucial for flavor and cooking but they are also packed with essential nutrients like vitamins B and C in fact onions bring immense economic value to Farmers generating billions in Revenue they're also a nutritional Powerhouse known to reduce the risk of heart disease and improve immune function the process of growing onions begins with selecting seeds nurturing seedlings and taking care of young plants before they are transplanted into the fields for large scale cultivation the seeds need to be treated to enhance their germination rate and resistance to pests before sewing the seeds are typically soaked in warm water for 12 to 24 hours to stimulate germination after treatment the seeds are sewn in seed trays or directly into Nursery soil onions grow best in loose well- drained soil that is rich in organic matter after preparing the soil Farmers plant the seeds or onion bulbs in carefully arranged rows watering is a crucial factor for healthy onion growth drip irrigation is commonly used to conserve water and ensure optimal plant development once onions are growing they need constant care Farmers regularly weed the fields to prevent competition for nutrients and use organic fertilizers to enhance growth onions are also vulnerable to pests like onion thrips in diseases such as Downey mildew many farmers adopt organic or chemical-free PES control methods to ensure healthy safe crops after 90 to 150 days onions reach maturity when the tops of the onions fall over it's time to harvest Farmers carefully pull or lift onions from the ground to prevent damage in smaller Farms harvesting is done by hand but for larger operations specialized machines make the process quicker and more efficient [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] once harvested onions are sorted by size and quality in modern processing plants conveyors and automatic sorters are used to speed up the process after sorting they are cleaned and packaged ready to be shipped to markets worldwide thanks to modern technology the entire process is more efficient ensuring the freshest onions for consumers from large scale Farms to your local grocery store onions play a huge role in the economy and our daily diets they affordability and health benefits make them a staple food around the world that's all for today's video on onion farming from growing and caring for the crops to harvesting and processing we've covered every step if you found this video helpful don't forget to like subscribe and hit the notification Bell for more insights in into modern agricultural practices thanks for watching modern Agro machines we'll see you in the next one [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music]",
