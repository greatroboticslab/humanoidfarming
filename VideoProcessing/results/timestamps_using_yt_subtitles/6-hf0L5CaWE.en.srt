1
00:00:00,260 --> 00:00:10,800
looks like we got a problem Houston my

2
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:15,150
wheel fell off it didn't even realize it

3
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,949
till it fell off reason being the

4
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,480
bearings disintegrated because I drove

5
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:20,220
it in the pond a couple times last year

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,070
to rescue some stuff cars and trucks

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:26,580
well as I mentioned before water and

8
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:28,560
wheel bearings kills them so I've got

9
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,140
the axle shaft on the spindle all

10
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:33,570
cleaned off got the bearing hole cleaned

11
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:35,880
out on both sides and grease and broken

12
00:00:33,570 --> 00:00:38,850
bearing bits out now I have to show you

13
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:40,680
how to get a wheel bearing off are the

14
00:00:38,850 --> 00:00:43,620
pieces this is the same as you do it for

15
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:45,360
like for example the rear of a car or if

16
00:00:43,620 --> 00:00:46,770
it's a rear-wheel drive car how to get

17
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,899
the wheel bearings out of the front

18
00:00:46,770 --> 00:00:51,030
rotors luckily for me when you have a

19
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,370
tractor it has the option of lifting up

20
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,340
any wheel you want to you know so you

21
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:57,750
don't have to use a jack cool so first

22
00:00:56,340 --> 00:00:59,309
thing you notice we're now looking at

23
00:00:57,750 --> 00:01:03,149
the back side of the wheel the big

24
00:00:59,309 --> 00:01:07,560
bearing has a notch in the hub on both

25
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:10,439
sides that's your removal notch I'll

26
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,990
show you how that works you get a steel

27
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:18,350
bar or a big bolt with a flat end on one

28
00:01:12,990 --> 00:01:18,350
end and you flip your wheel or tire over

29
00:01:18,860 --> 00:01:24,240
so that the bearing hub is facing

30
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:28,100
towards the ground now you use your big

31
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,689
hammer steel bar drop it down each notch

32
00:01:28,100 --> 00:01:32,310
give a few taps on one side and a few

33
00:01:30,689 --> 00:01:33,689
taps neither side and keep tapping back

34
00:01:32,310 --> 00:01:36,600
and forth with your hammer until you

35
00:01:33,689 --> 00:01:38,220
knock the bearing out save the old piece

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,009
of bearing you need it to reinstall the

37
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:43,950
new one so you hold your steel bar and

38
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,920
angle like that and start whacking if I

39
00:01:43,950 --> 00:01:50,939
only took about eight wax and my bearing

40
00:01:46,920 --> 00:01:53,430
piece is out oh there it is now put that

41
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:57,840
aside for reinstallation to put the new

42
00:01:53,430 --> 00:02:01,860
one in there's your new part the new

43
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:08,009
piece we got to press in new bearing hub

44
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:10,179
and race and XL dust seal

45
00:02:08,009 --> 00:02:12,190
so just make sure there's a bit of

46
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:14,500
grease around the surface and set that

47
00:02:12,190 --> 00:02:19,780
in the hole with the widest portion

48
00:02:14,500 --> 00:02:23,650
always facing out then you set the wheel

49
00:02:19,780 --> 00:02:26,770
flat on the ground clean up this piece

50
00:02:23,650 --> 00:02:29,709
of and you use this to reinstall

51
00:02:26,770 --> 00:02:31,720
the bearing and you also put it in with

52
00:02:29,709 --> 00:02:34,420
the widest peace and peace facing

53
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,090
outwards then you put a block of flats

54
00:02:34,420 --> 00:02:39,430
teal or something on it and tap it in

55
00:02:37,090 --> 00:02:45,880
with the hammer now I have a perfect

56
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:48,790
installation tool set that on there may

57
00:02:45,880 --> 00:02:52,180
be that way works better and start

58
00:02:48,790 --> 00:03:07,930
whacking have to tap it evenly get it

59
00:02:52,180 --> 00:03:09,910
down square perfect got to love it now

60
00:03:07,930 --> 00:03:12,400
at the same method on the other side use

61
00:03:09,910 --> 00:03:14,950
your flattened n steel bar catch the

62
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:25,200
ridge of the other bearing and knock it

63
00:03:14,950 --> 00:03:28,780
out packed a sucker with locks of grease

64
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:31,269
and with your hands pack that with lots

65
00:03:28,780 --> 00:03:33,250
of grease 2 of course it's got a big

66
00:03:31,269 --> 00:03:35,829
calves Ian Ayre to hold grease and

67
00:03:33,250 --> 00:03:37,500
you're all set for installation the

68
00:03:35,829 --> 00:03:40,510
inner part of the bearing is in the hole

69
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:44,739
now pre grease the rubber part of the

70
00:03:40,510 --> 00:03:49,600
new seal and install it and tap it on

71
00:03:44,739 --> 00:03:50,739
square 20 got the other part of the

72
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:52,980
bearing packed and ready for

73
00:03:50,739 --> 00:03:52,980
installation

74
00:03:57,690 --> 00:04:10,090
put wash your on and your big called a

75
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:16,419
castellated nut castellated part always

76
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:18,280
goes outwards then the first setting you

77
00:04:16,419 --> 00:04:21,480
make it is a little bit tight then you

78
00:04:18,280 --> 00:04:24,160
rotate the wheel a few times set it off

79
00:04:21,480 --> 00:04:26,260
then I back the bearing off to make it

80
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,330
looser to the first Cotter key hole

81
00:04:26,260 --> 00:04:30,160
lines up I put the car turkey in than

82
00:04:28,330 --> 00:04:33,130
the end and that's how you set the wheel

83
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,590
bearing have the right amount of play

84
00:04:33,130 --> 00:04:37,780
which is almost no play but you never

85
00:04:35,590 --> 00:04:39,940
run it with a tight wheel bearing or

86
00:04:37,780 --> 00:04:41,940
it'll get hot when you burn it out so

87
00:04:39,940 --> 00:04:45,300
now trying to put the dust cap on and

88
00:04:41,940 --> 00:04:45,300
we're all done
