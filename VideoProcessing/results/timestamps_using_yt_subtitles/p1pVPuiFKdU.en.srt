requires meticulous care and skill from

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:54,159
Farmers first the soil is cleared

39
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:56,320
loosened and enriched with organic

40
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:59,320
fertilizer to provide essential

all cloves are planted evenly and

53
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:31,280
correctly after planting the soil is

00:03:16,440 --> 00:03:20,959
with nutrients the garlic planting

maintain consistent spacing between

76
00:03:30,120 --> 00:03:36,680
cloves typically 10 to 15 cm ensuring
