00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,600
hi i'm wayne this is emily and we're

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,520
just going to show you how to milk a cow

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,160
we've been out here about seven years

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:07,600
and

5
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,280
we're really bad when we started we're

6
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:10,320
not experts so i'd love it if you know

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:11,280
more than us you could put in the

8
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:13,599
comments

9
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,839
some tips on how to milk but basically

10
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,199
we're gonna give it a go we've got some

11
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:19,760
green clover here because she loves that

12
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:22,400
as a treat and a bit of loosen for after

13
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,400
we're finished

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:29,679
so

15
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:30,640
we'll give her a little treat before she

16
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,719
starts

17
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
just to make sure she comes up and is

18
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:36,480
ready for the milking so we don't have

19
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,480
to go and get her

20
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,760
hello jet fighter how are you today hey

21
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:48,079
how are you

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,600
i just put this rope around her neck

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:51,840
as a way of saying

24
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:54,800
boy

25
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:58,920
sit swampy sit phoebe

26
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,920
not good having the dogs too close

27
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,559
swampy back

28
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,559
go back sit good boy sit

29
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,200
so this rope is just the way of saying

30
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
to her when you got this rope around

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:17,200
your neck stands still don't move i'm

32
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:18,720
trying to train her can you move back a

33
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,400
bit lauren because she's interested in

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,400
you that's better

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,080
beautiful what's this camera

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,080
you you like the camera do you jet

37
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,080
fighter

38
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:35,280
so the first little bit's just relaxing

39
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:36,960
us so

40
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,079
give a little scratch and

41
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:40,400
um

42
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,759
rub down with a brush but the dogs got

43
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:43,520
our brush a couple of days ago so we

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,360
don't have it

45
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,000
and you you want a milk or holder you

46
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:48,000
hold it today

47
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:54,399
in the past i've tied this to a star

48
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
post

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
and that keeps her still

50
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,840
but i'm trying to train jet fighter to

51
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,360
stand still with no post so that we can

52
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,479
just milk her

53
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,000
without tying her up so

54
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,800
she hasn't learned it yet but that's the

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,080
aim

56
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:11,440
when you're giving her a rub down it's

57
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,040
good to give her a rub under her tummy

58
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:14,319
and down near her utter just so that she

59
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,879
starts getting

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:16,879
used to it

61
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:23,120
so she had her first car just there

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,680
about two weeks ago so

63
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:28,640
she hasn't been milked before two weeks

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,640
so she's still learning

65
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,840
when you first start to milk her

66
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,959
um don't just go and grab the teeth

67
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,239
because i think they're a little bit

68
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:41,760
ticklish so if i just go and grab the

69
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,280
teeth from nowhere

70
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,000
oh she's not going to do it she might

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:47,760
kick so don't just do that sort of work

72
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,120
your way around make it feel comfortable

73
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,319
and then down to it

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
is a better way when you're starting

75
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:56,800
we don't let her eat at all from the

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,720
grass while we're melting just as a way

77
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,959
of um

78
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,840
so she doesn't move around

79
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:07,599
and she loves a big scratch around her

80
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,599
ears and on a hairy bit

81
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,280
all this is just part of relaxing ara

82
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:12,720
and

83
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,920
if she gets the point of chewing a cud

84
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:15,920
she's really relaxed that's good

85
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,159
okay jet fighter i'm gonna milk you now

86
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,519
thank you

87
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,440
so

88
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,680
first thing is this is

89
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,799
fairly warm water

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:31,799
actually this is a bit too warm today

91
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:39,640
just gonna wipe her uttering teeth clean

92
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,640
thank you jet fighter

93
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:51,920
this is just in case there's any dirt

94
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,680
she's been sleeping on it oh hey

95
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:55,280
that fighter see how she flicked me

96
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,879
before she

97
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:58,480
kicks with her foot

98
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:00,560
that's just the flicks the way of saying

99
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,599
hey i don't like that i've got to listen

100
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:03,599
to her tail flicks

101
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,200
see how there's just a bit of

102
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,439
a bit of gut comes off there

103
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
i like to give it a good

104
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,439
a good clean because

105
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:16,880
we don't pass dry some milk we just

106
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:20,320
drink it raw

107
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,320
so you want this all nice and clean

108
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:25,199
so no hit bits of hair and things fall

109
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,199
in

110
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,000
great

111
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,000
good girl

112
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:35,440
next thing

113
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,800
so dry it off

114
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,600
draw my hands

115
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,600
it's with another old nappy

116
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,280
good girl jet fighter

117
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,880
right now

118
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,440
people use various things on the teats

119
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,919
to moisturize them

120
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,919
we use some

121
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,520
coconut oil

122
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,720
so the coconut oil has been sitting in

123
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,320
the hot water

124
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,840
that that melts it

125
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,880
and

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:19,360
i just put a bit on each teat

127
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,360
so coconut oil is also a mild

128
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:23,680
antifungal antibacterial kind of thing

129
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:25,840
so

130
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,120
it does stop infections a little bit so

131
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,600
it's

132
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,560
really good

133
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,479
also

134
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,639
the first thing and i do it now before i

135
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:36,240
get the bucket is that first bit of milk

136
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:38,320
in each tea you just squirt out onto the

137
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,560
ground

138
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,039
because if there are any

139
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,160
bits of bacteria or yucky

140
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:49,120
sitting in the end of the teat

141
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:49,120
you don't want that in your milk

142
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:53,800
so a couple of squirts from each tape

143
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,360
i'm a bit of a

144
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,680
i like to do this too i do a couple of

145
00:05:57,360 --> 00:06:01,520
squirts in the bucket

146
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:03,120
give it a little rinse out

147
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:04,319
don't have to do that

148
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,199
this bucket's been sterilized with

149
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,160
boiling water and then we start milking

150
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,639
so

151
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,440
bucket there what she may do

152
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
is

153
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
try and put this foot forward and if she

154
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,880
does it'll kick that bucket so i'm ready

155
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,639
to grab the bucket and hold her foot if

156
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,120
she does do that

157
00:06:18,639 --> 00:06:22,720
and emily's gonna sing because

158
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:24,319
she loves singing all the cows love

159
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,240
singing and they

160
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,960
relax more so

161
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:29,960
you're gonna sing there emily

162
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:37,360
beautiful

163
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
and so

164
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
there's two ways of milking one is you

165
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
grab the top

166
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,479
and then squeeze it out

167
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:46,319
like you grab the top and then squeeze

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,960
it out like that

169
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,400
but i the other way is just stripping it

170
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,840
and because her teeth are short i think

171
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,000
stripping's better

172
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:54,000
so

173
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:01,440
so

174
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,720
what you don't want is the milk from

175
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:04,800
here getting pushed back up into the

176
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,960
udder so the worst thing is just

177
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:08,639
squeezing it because if you squeeze it

178
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,120
you might be actually pushing the

179
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:13,120
milk up way through a one-way valve and

180
00:07:11,120 --> 00:07:14,720
plus if there's any bacteria

181
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:16,160
in the right in the end of the teat you

182
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,400
might be pushing that up into the really

183
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,160
clean udder so you always go down that's

184
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:22,240
why when you're starting stripping it's

185
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,840
almost impossible to go

186
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
backwards when you're stripping whereas

187
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,199
if you're doing this way if you ex if

188
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,759
you haven't gripped it

189
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,000
hard enough there and then you squeeze

190
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:35,199
this one it might squeeze it back up so

191
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:37,039
if you're starting the stripping is good

192
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,599
as i'm starting i'm just like i'll do

193
00:07:37,039 --> 00:07:41,199
the front two teats i'll try the back

194
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:43,360
teeth there

195
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:45,759
and the other back teeth

196
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:48,240
right so i'm feeling that

197
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,840
these front two feel

198
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,599
fairly empty so they're the ones the

199
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:53,520
calf probably drank off

200
00:07:51,599 --> 00:07:54,400
this back one's really full

201
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,759
so i'm going to make sure that i'm

202
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,400
always milking from that back one

203
00:07:55,759 --> 00:07:59,400
because it's going to

204
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,720
right and then you just

205
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:04,720
milk

206
00:08:07,680 --> 00:08:13,120
how's she going up there emily

207
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,680
she's chewing a card not yet

208
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:17,440
but she's um getting there

209
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,039
some little tips i think they like it

210
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,280
with if you go in with your head like

211
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:25,879
this and

212
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,879
just rest on them don't know why

213
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,599
i find the most comfortable way to sit

214
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:37,399
is just crouching like this actually but

215
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:37,399
some people like a stool

216
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
um

217
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,399
a little craft over there having a

218
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,399
nibble on the listen

219
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:36,240
oh

220
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:39,040
the teats don't all squirt down so if i

221
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,959
just squirt this one it sort of goes

222
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,640
back so that means i have to sort of

223
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:44,560
point it down so

224
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:46,720
if i pull it this way it'll point down

225
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,720
this this teat

226
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:51,200
it does pretty right direction

227
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,279
this back teeth

228
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:54,959
it's going to squirt way out there so i

229
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:57,040
have to pull it this way as i'm milking

230
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:58,880
so that it goes into the bucket so you

231
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,120
just sort of if the teeth are squirting

232
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,079
that way you milk it this way see so the

233
00:10:01,120 --> 00:10:06,000
bottom's

234
00:10:02,079 --> 00:10:09,600
facing the right way you work that out

235
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,600
now if you have little tips for me

236
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:15,640
i'd love it because we've only learnt

237
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:15,640
out of books and from youtube

238
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:27,880
so

239
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,440
uh

240
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:08,120
so

241
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:23,240
there you go i'm jet fighter

242
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,240
this is lovely today

243
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:52,959
hello

244
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,560
how you doing

245
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,839
how are you today jet fighter this is

246
00:11:54,560 --> 00:11:57,839
lovely milk

247
00:12:04,079 --> 00:12:07,279
she's staying pretty still today

248
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:08,480
sometimes you can feel her weight shift

249
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,839
forward which means she's going to take

250
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:11,440
a step which isn't good and you've got

251
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:15,240
to sort of

252
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,240
be ready to move the bucket

253
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,040
see that there how i had to move the

254
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,519
bucket away and keep her leg back

255
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:35,079
no jet fighter that's not very nice okay

256
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:35,079
no kicking please

257
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,360
when she does kick i try and go back to

258
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:47,040
milking in exactly the same way that i

259
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:48,639
was on the same teats

260
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,160
just so that she learns if she kicks she

261
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:51,200
doesn't get any change

262
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:53,120
otherwise

263
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,279
she'll get trained to kick

264
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,320
to teach me to move

265
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:58,880
so

266
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,800
whatever i was doing when she kicked

267
00:12:58,880 --> 00:13:05,079
unless it was particularly hurting her

268
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:05,079
i'd go straight back to doing it

269
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:27,440
what's that flip about

270
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:35,680
so see the milk there that's about oh

271
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:38,320
what are you doing there jet fighter no

272
00:13:35,680 --> 00:13:38,320
clicking please

273
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,920
about a quarter of a bucket so far so

274
00:13:40,399 --> 00:13:45,160
we're a quarter of the

275
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:45,160
way through

276
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,079
so

277
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:22,920
so

278
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,519
that's

279
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:50,199
there you go emily

280
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:02,519
um

281
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:47,000
so

282
00:15:55,920 --> 00:16:00,160
hey jet fighter

283
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,920
was that about jet fighter

284
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:05,160
it's not very good

285
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,160
thank you

286
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,279
i've had a few squirts here where i've

287
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,639
got milk on my finger like that

288
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,399
see

289
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:24,000
what i hold your finger up

290
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:26,240
if your fingers down you get milk on it

291
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,839
now because i've got milk on it some of

292
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:30,240
the oils wiped off

293
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,120
it's actually getting a bit dry up here

294
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:35,240
so

295
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,240
i'm gonna put a bit more oil on

296
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:49,800
hello getting a bit more oil

297
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:56,920
um

298
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,280
this teat's got a bit of a cut

299
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
on the exact other side of it

300
00:17:13,280 --> 00:17:16,559
so when you've got a cut you sort of got

301
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:19,520
to try and get it so that

302
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:21,520
you're not squeezing on the cut

303
00:17:19,520 --> 00:17:24,880
what's happening jet fighter

304
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:26,400

305
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,559

309
00:17:56,320 --> 00:18:01,160
you got a bit of a boogie in your nose

310
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:01,160
today

311
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:35,720
so

312
00:18:53,760 --> 00:18:56,760

00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:08,729
hey

314
00:19:05,630 --> 00:19:08,729
[Music]

315
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:17,400
so

316
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:32,679
so

317
00:19:39,039 --> 00:19:42,039
oh

318
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:03,880
[Music]

319
00:20:04,320 --> 00:20:07,320
me

320
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,039
um

321
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,360
good morning

322
00:20:39,990 --> 00:20:43,360
[Music]

323
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,600
head back emily

324
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,600
thank you

325
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:58,159
just hold her head

326
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,480
we're basically trying to train her to

327
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:03,840
sit there patiently and not eat and not

328
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:03,840
move so

329
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,960
the reason we have two people is because

330
00:21:06,880 --> 00:21:11,039
um she's only been milking two weeks so

331
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:12,400
she's not trained i would like to get to

332
00:21:11,039 --> 00:21:14,000
the point where i come down and milk her

333
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:16,559
without emily or emily milton without me

334
00:21:14,000 --> 00:21:20,120
and she just stands there don't know if

335
00:21:16,559 --> 00:21:20,120
that'll work but

336
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,679
so

337
00:21:48,559 --> 00:21:51,559
so

338
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:05,720
so

339
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:23,159
what's that about i don't know thank you

340
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:36,919
so

341
00:22:43,200 --> 00:22:46,200
so

342
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,400
mmm

343
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:15,400
so

344
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:29,000
so

345
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:41,880
so

346
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,720
so

347
00:24:14,159 --> 00:24:17,159
emily

348
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:47,840
foreign

349
00:24:48,540 --> 00:24:51,589
[Music]

350
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:43,640
my

351
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:56,679
there's only two warning kicks there and

352
00:25:53,679 --> 00:25:56,679
then

353
00:26:00,420 --> 00:26:03,499
[Music]

354
00:26:21,520 --> 00:26:26,320
this front teeth

355
00:26:23,200 --> 00:26:26,320
it's just about running out

356
00:26:28,480 --> 00:26:31,279
very central

357
00:26:32,480 --> 00:26:38,520
see how it's getting thinner

358
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:38,520
so that others nearly empty

359
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:43,120
there it's got none left

360
00:26:40,720 --> 00:26:44,559
see that

361
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:46,640
so you're good it's good to strip it dry

362
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:49,039
like that

363
00:26:46,640 --> 00:26:49,039
so that

364
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,880
well it's not so important when there's

365
00:26:51,440 --> 00:26:54,159
a calf on but

366
00:26:52,880 --> 00:26:56,159
especially if there's no calf and you

367
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,840
want to get them all dry like that so

368
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,480
there's no milk left so that there's

369
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:03,039
less chance of mastitis that other front

370
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,039
ones nearly

371
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:07,840
finished too

372
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:07,840
yeah it's finished

373
00:27:12,960 --> 00:27:16,799
so that one's finished not much there if

374
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,760
you rub that other you might get a

375
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,760
little bit more milk down

376
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:22,080
not much

377
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,039
great

378
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:25,039
now it's just the back two

379
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,960
oh

380
00:27:28,880 --> 00:27:35,559
that was flickers because i'm

381
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,559
back on this sore one with the cut on it

382
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:40,000
now this is just milking this back one

383
00:27:41,120 --> 00:27:44,600
