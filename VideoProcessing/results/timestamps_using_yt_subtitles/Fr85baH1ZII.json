  "text": "welcome all we are going to divide the session in two first we are going to have main presentations of our cases and then we are we will like to open a space of discussion with our panelists so I would like to introduce you to have it Clemens Harry Clemens is a program officer of carbon finance in evils the humanist Institute of development cooperation Harry so I'll start then maybe you can start the slides here so I will talk about well I will give one presentation on one of the cases about the relationship between agriculture and climate change with also incorporating climate finance that's the case of the bio slurry by a flurry which is used as fertilizer in connection with with biogas domestic biogas so the next the first slide yeah so here you can see the basic design of the bio digester we have programs of biogas and by lorry in several countries of Africa Asia and Latin America and the basic it's a household level so these are small digesters the basic design is a fixed dome design of we have in between four cubic and thirteen cubic meter and so you can see on the picture that on the left side there's the the wet organic waste that's the inflow so usually it's a livestock manure and also human equity so you need to put the the manure the left side it flows into the digester there it is the process of the digesting so after yeah after some 20 to 30 days it starts producing the gas the cost goes up and by the cost sure the the digester slurry gets on the pressure and they'll be put out to the right so that the effluent that is the bios slurry that will automatically go out and that's the fertilizer that we will be talking about so the design is that we manage usually in the he force and S&T programs it's the fixed dome design coach on the ground you have other models but this is a model that is quite quite solid so it is a usual lifetime of it 20 years or longer so but the investment cost is not so low but it varies between countries in general Asia is much cheaper than Africa and also then Latin America now so the construction cost would be in between three hundred and fifteen eight hundred dollars in Asia and between 600 and 1,000 dollars in Africa and also in Latin America so it has basically two products no the biogas for cooking and lighting and also the by slurry is volcanic fertilizer so the next light please yeah so here you can see the the well the two products are the the bio castes in the in the Vice slurry but there are multiple benefits so it decided the programs they create local employment now at the the the gas which is a clean cooking fuel so it has yeah the cooking which is convenient fast healthy and there's also the lighting option or well better to say the aggregate for those households that don't have electricity the lighting is also a nice benefit and then there's the fertilizer so next like this so the bios slurry there's a yes I mentioned the supreme fertilizer it can be applied in three different forms now it can be applied directly in a liquid form that has added the digester slurry is beneficial because it's readily available the nutrients so the liquid form can be absorbed by the and used by the plant directly the disadvantages that yet a heavy and it's not so convenient to do transport so when when the farmer uses it for longer distances they often dry it and then the third alternative is to compost it and that would be the best form but well that depends on the niche no so the most common or the most popular model is six cubic metre and that is sufficient for one fertilizing one hectare on average and if you compost it with organic waste you can yeah you can use product you have fertilizer for about three hectares of course all this variable it's depends on the crop and the specific needs and that also is for the for the revenues and the yield increases so actually we have made a document with all the yeah the different results in in practice how yields are increasing in different crops so I brought some copies of that that will be at the SNP booth here in the yeah in the in the one of those buffers so there you can see in more detail the benefits of the slurry but on average is 25 percent revenue increase compared to the the the raw manure so next slide please okay so at those programs that we have in society in Africa Asia and Latin America well in Africa does the African biogas partnership program that's in five countries we have an Indonesia and Cambodia so now we have carbon projects registered for biogas in four countries and in validation for the other countries we will focus now on the Kenya and Indonesia because that's where we are working also on the by slurry part on the energy part hence it is already registered in Kenyan Indonesia Kenya case by the CDM is a renewable energy project so they're what you quantify is the replacement of of firewood now and also but that's more in Indonesia and in Cambodia there's also the manual management because there's no methane emissions in the raw menu so Indonesia domestic biogas project is registered in the voluntary code standard in 2013 and on average we are all variable but on average it's Fortin co2 per household so there's four carbon credits per household that's for the energy part so that is the part that is fitting into the the current called standard and CDM method approve methodologies but it does not recognize the part for the bios slurry so now we are working with the gold standard as the gold standard launched maybe you have seen it launched this week the the gold standard agriculture standard and was last Wednesday and so and now we can work on the methodologies to be approved to to quantify the impact on carbon sequestration and fertilizer replacement by the by the base salary and we are working on that it's yeah the depends on where you use it many different crops and and how you use it in liquid form or in the dried form on the composite form so that makes we are different situations here maybe the next lighting yeah okay so do we we are working there for the soil and more no that's a specialized company so they have produced the methodology white paper so an initial methodology for the for the measurement of the carbon impact of bio celery we have done by celery use the surface in Kenya and Indonesia and we have now also the feasibility study for Indonesia based on that to use a surface so we have made a baseline scenario project basic scenario probably plus scenario and that's basically because it's so different in the different types of applications so most people now use it in the liquid or right form and only small percentage in the composite form there and so the initial calculations is that with the project basic scenario with that mix of applications it's 2.4 tonne per hectare that if we if up to 70% of the users would make composite and it would go up to 5 points written the hectare and then well on average the farmers they have 0.6 hectares those that are in the in the survey so that's more or less see we dedicated the case description just still one more slide ok yeah so it's a kind of a landscape plus I would say because it has the bio khasimbai story in combination it really has all three elements of the landscape the reduced deforestation or because of the substitutes the replacement of of the firewood it has the improved agriculture and it is also reinforcing the integrated livestock and crops system and it has the energy system so and besides that it also is let's say the plus because it's about lively oats it's about food security there's a very strong health benefit that there's the time savings because especially important for the women because they in many places are to collect the wood and there's the income generation both by the users and by the constructor so baby yeah I've not mentioned yet that it's a market-based approach we train construct Mason's they form small enterprises and so there's also the local employment economy part so that's yeah let's say netscape's plus thank you I kindly ask you all do to maintain your questions to the end and I want to introduce now to Francisco Fonseca a senior researcher and adviser of zydeco yes it works well I work for saveco which is an NGO based in Costa Rica we work in some other countries in Latin America Sudoku is needed a sport for about 30 years you know sustainable agriculture and we also have developed methodology named cambio dos which is proper for measuring carbon sequestration from sustainable practice in just a lot of farming the I'm going to present you some of the results we already have after somehow like one and a half years working together with the gold standard this is one of the six projects selected to implement agriculture methodologies that may be used for the new standard of the gold standard this whole process is being sponsored by he was from from the Netherlands next one so pacifying is the name of the project it stands for sustained agree culture in coffee plantations in Nicaragua in Spanish of course we are working with a quite important organization a cooperative second level cooperative named por el de Kaap the it is cooperative covers around 38 different cups and we picked three two cooperatives from two different departments in in the northern part of Nicola over there placed were most of the high quality coffee comes from Nicaragua one co-operative was conventional plus for trade under the co-operative implement organic practice certified as well plus portray from them we picked 45 farms to implement the computers methodology in the film what some key aspects to be remind from these cooperatives are that they are a great system our forces systems that means that they have already established four trees into the coffee plantations for Shailene and our expect to be remind important is that they apply almost nothing very low to nothing fertilizers so they have very low yields and because of the under Nernst condition of the plants they are affected thoroughly severely for the coffee leave rust and other diseases so that's something that we want to tackle next one please so in an eventual project with carbon credits satisfied by the gold standard we would expect to be these carbon credits to be invested in a composting facility to improve yields and to have a better way to manage the the sanitary aspects of the plants and we already said that they are real trees in the in the systems so the carbon will come from the aerial biomass that they said the leaves and parts of the trees that comes to falsehood into the ground and add to carbon to the soil and soil carbon biomass and avoided emissions that comes from the substitution from chemical fertilizers and now using compost or organic fertilizers so in a twenty years period this trail will be added from the trees and from adding applying composing in the field that will add carbon to the soil and will avoid emissions to the to the to the Earth's atmosphere nice so these one pre-action we have made some model with ROTC model we have done this prediction calculating to satisfy the 60% of nitrogen for the coffee plant for them to increase yields that something that they cannot achieve currently and so this is the forecast an example the forecast accumulation rate per year per hectare in 20 years that will be used for for the carbon credits estimation in the future the next one here we have two variables is one is yields expected yields and emissions so we have organic on the top and bottom and the bulk of conventional farmers on the top we see with the purple bars there is the situation where there is no project so in the organic farms Jews will remain about the same you can see in the red line that emissions will be about the same emissions of greenhouse gases but having the project we may expect these yields to increase by year six to almost double but we can see it in the blue line that emissions will go up as well I'm going to that later you know sly for conventional farmers the spectators will be that you can see again in the purple bars they will have more similar yields it depends on coffee price and the cost of fertilizers but we can see that they would be parallel to increments of the carbon emission due to the chemical fertilizers with the project we would SPECT the day to increase whether the the deal we can see in the in the green bars but we see in the blue line that the emissions will be reduced because of the substitution of chemical fertilizers with compost that's only so what I say about the emissions from the compose application so we have estimated that the compost will cause emissions but they will also add carbon into the soil and in the organic farming systems the accumulation of carbon will be six times higher than the emissions caused because of the composing so they we don't need to worry about that is about the same case in the conventional one the next one please next please okay as I said before they have our forces systems where there are banana crops and trees useful also for the bees they produce honey so it's important and there are the trees covering the the the coffee plants and district agencies - in a capture rate for co2 assist sets in conventional 2.33 3233 and organic a little bit lower because they have more trees in the conventional ones so this important to bear in mind because of the next slide please next next yeah so one of the importance of this project is that because of the coffee rust especially the conventional farmers are tempted to switch from the bars that they already have to more resistant varieties to the coffee Li rust and the problem is that these darts approach with this the car these this plants needs more light so they will cut the trees they're already there and this coffee the quality of this coffee is not that good and the pro means that these organization Prada coke is well positioned in the market because of the quality of the coffee so they will lose market and they won't get the fur trade price they already have that complete so this is what we expect to happen with the project it's another representation we already have measured the baseline we have already measured what is the increase in carbon sequestration because the shift from conventional systems including organic farming but by implementing a compulsion facility we would spec this carbon right sequestration two-spirit to be boosts and then this is what would be the additionality of the project that would be offered in the market and the carbon markets next one please so again the composting facility will go to the coffee plantations we expect this to increased yields and to increase also carbon in soil and we get further carbo prayers that will be used for paying back the investment in the composting facility next one please sir so their benefits sorry are a you increase the yields to have a better control of the diseases especially the coffee Li rust and there's something we already have found that by using organic fertilizer to improving the nutrition of the plant we better we get better a taste way better a higher qualification of the other of the coffee if they have a better taste so they can claim for a higher price and we have seen also we have measured for example from reduction from 20 to 5 percent reductions in the the defective coffee beings so this is very important for the in terms of the yield and the quantities they can sell into the quality markets next one please so we expect from this product to increase the income from having higher yields to improve the quality of the coffee to reduce the losses because of the coffee beans and of course because reducing also the losses due to the diseases I'd report the likelihoods and we belong we believe that a stronger former organizations is a key key issue in order to promote the creation of farming and no farming jobs in in the in the communities to demand services and to promote then a more dynamic economy they're in their own landscapes so thanks for your attention and I hope your questions later Thank You Francisco [Applause] yeah now I want to introduce you to revert to googas revert to a gaseous member of the board of f1 but it is also a research researcher in the university la melena here improve the Vertigo flourishes when Finella presentation for for no it won't be easy good morning in contrar Oh I will report about a household survey that we conducted a few months ago in the Peruvian Andes and we try to understand the relationship between Agricola G livelihoods and food security this was part of a project project funded by Canadian development agencies in which we had collaboration with Peruvian and Canadian organizations and our main partner in the field with the National Association of ecological farmers when we speak of ecological farmers in the context of this report we don't mean third party certified farmers but non certified organic farmers and they are involved in other types of guarantee systems for organic farming like participatory guarantee systems the fact is that in spite of the very strong economic growth of the last two decades in Peru the situation in the Peruvian Andes remains more or less similar and the differences between urban and rural population remains more or less the same this is a map the official Peruvian map of the vulnerability to food insecurity and as you can see the red color are the districts with a highest vulnerability to put insecurity it follows almost exactly the Andean Highlands to the east you have the Amazon to the west you have the coast where almost 70% of our population leads so in spite of this economic growth and all the public discourse about the importance of traditional cultures in ditional people and biodiversity the fact is that when it comes to poverty and food insecurity particularly in the high Andes the situation is more or less the same so we I cannot read I'm sorry I have to turn around what we wanted was to characterize small landholders according to their Agricole article practices to analyze the relationship between rural livelihoods with emphasis on natural financial physical human and social capital and Agricole ajikko practices and to explain food security as an effect of Agricola chico practices and selected indicators of livelihoods so we developed the research first of all trying to understand the context in terms of social demographics environmental profile and Agricola Jeckle production we under try to understand and through a household survey we made several questions about natural physical financial and human and social capital and in the end we try to analyze it the effects on food security we divided the population in two main groups agro ecological farmers were at least 70% of the farms were under Agricole ajikko practice they had not used chemical inputs for the last three years and they were implemented at least one of the following one practice in each of the following category using organic manures soil and water conservation crop diversification and ecological pest control on the other hand the conventional farmers were living in the same communities as a research group of the Agricola Jeckle group with similar characteristics have not been exposed to the Agricola local perspective or does not know or they did not know about them and implemented conventional practices at least one of the following using chemical fertilizers chemical insecticide fungicide or plant growth hormones so we I'm sorry this is this is the size of the sample that we implemented we worked in three regions the northern Andes cajamarca the central Andes Juanico and the southern part of the end is cusco and the total number of farmers were 221 Agricola Tico 230 conventional with a total sample 451 households this is the first time that this type of comparison is done in Peru and what we wanted to gather of course concrete facts about the effect of the agro-ecological implementation besides the ideological discourse and this is the type of farmers we got information from they could have been like in the left it's very small tomato grower in the northern Andes then they a woman growing vegetables for the local markets in Cusco under plastic tunnels or very traditional farmers growing native potatoes above 4,000 meters sea level what all of them have in common is that they practice Agricola G and they belong to the National Association of ecological farmers or were linked to such organizations the results were very different and when it comes to the social demographic graphic profile we found statistical differences for example by the in the educational level achieved by the mother and in general there was a high statistical significant differences and the Agri collage achill households tended to speak more Spanish than the conventional farmers this has something to do of course with their access to the formal educational systems which is basically all done in Spanish when it comes to the farming system profile 99 almost a hundred percent of the agricultural households could distinguish an agro-ecological practice with only one third in the conventional almost 80 percent of the conventional households did not have any external support compared to only 54 percent in the Agricola chico households the agora collage achill households used more external labour 16:1 compared to 40 percent and they were also highly more interested in growing new crops and diversifying their production the sources of seats was statistically significant with significant differences produced by themselves or exchanged with other farmers with comparison to the conventional which were more reliant on the modern market when it comes to the Agricola Chico practices the use of organic manure soil and water conservation and crop diversification we asked what was the situation five years ago and what was the situation today as you can see the Agricola you call farmers five years ago 80% implemented these Agricole ajikko practices and five years later this climbed up to almost 100 percent while in the conventional group it changed from 40 to from 50 to 57 in five years so not a large increase over there when it comes sorry when it comes to the soil and water management practices five years ago in the Agricola yoga group there was an increase from 75 to 99 percent in five years while in the conventional group it remained more or less the same with regards to the cropping diversification systems in the Agricola Jekyll group the increase was similar from 82 to almost 100 while in the conventional group it moved from fifty to sixty seven when we characterized natural capital they were very interesting differences there the conventional group with significant differences expressed that their their soils were exhausted and also in 40% of the cases that the erosion has increased the Agricola Jekyll households practiced pressurized irrigation systems three times more than the conventional they have planted trees you see 85 percent versus 65 percent in the conventional and they consider that water to be contaminant free seventy five versus sixty percent when it comes to financial capitals the Agricola chico had a clear stronger connection with markets and to credit sources so they usually were selling their products in the local farmers market municipal markets while in the conventional there were other types of market connections and which is very importantly in these years in Peru the percentage of families participating in government social programs was higher in the Agra collage achill group as compared to the conventional and there were also significant differences in access to when it comes to physical capital there were significant differences sorry one minute okay I will run a little there were not many important differences when it comes to physical capital when it comes to the perception of family income you can see in the top the agroecological showed responded that their income has barely improved or has improved substantially well the conventional mentioned that their income remained the same with regards to social capital that were of course the normal differences basically because most of the agro-ecological farmers belong to farmers association and when required to answer why they belong to this organization 66 percent mentioned to access new markets when we decided with the start of the growing season when food reserves have already been finished and there were some difference there between Agricole ajikko and conventional so our preliminary conclusions are that we had a solid sampling allowing the detection of differences between Agricola jekyll and conventional however this is the first study of its kind a Greek illogical household showed a better performance in the five dimensions of food security there are normally four dimensions of post security but we have really found that institutions should be added at one of us one of the dimensions with regards to natural and social capital there were clear differences not so much with human and physical women had a higher participation and and this is relevant for what we are discussing today that very often Agri collage achill households tend to be located in similar similar micro watersheds and are organized increasing the relevance of key indicators related to climate change where they performed better there are many other conclusions that we are deriving right now but one very important is in general the institutional context in which these households operate is weak or very weak and there is a really strong need for stronger government presence of good quality thank you Thank You Loretta we have one to two minutes to clarification questions if there's some in the audience No okay well thank you hurry Francisco and Roberto yeah you have one could you please come in front [Music] Commerce Ernestina capacity muchas gracias rosemary a Gallaudet sentry Zayas me pregunta es para el representante de voz en lo relaciones o a los Beauty historias Beto a la posibilidad para poder reciclar la materia organic la pregunta que tengo es el proyecto crew stairs implement ro la dimension Elvin looming ec2 Vieira inversiones public Assisi converter own en pol\u00edticas para para ellos 'es Paseos porque en nuestro Pais tenemos la gran limitation de como este diamond Aviles say Misiones con el tema de las horas y lo recede Oso ledo's entonces esto como posibilidad para poder mesophyll carlo okay so our current system is or current programs are with the small holders in rural areas so they bio cash registers they are based on using the menu from the cows the cow dung mainly or sometimes the pigs it perfectly you can mix it with other inputs organic waste but in general we do not recommend it because then there's a risk that people don't know how how which are the materials that could be damaging the process and yeah so the the the program is just based on the the cow dung the pig dung and human extra for the first phase now so in future when people are more accustomed to to the system we might change that but and of course here in in in for the waste management it's also in also in urban areas very beneficial but we focus for the moment on the on the who Arius and I think the Russian another part in your question but I don't remember I want to hold your questions because we want to move to the panel and I want to introduce the panel and then we can interact within the panel no I said at the beginning that we will divide this session into you we already have seen three excellent cases in Africa Kenya and Indonesia presented by Harry also Nicaragua presented by Francisco and presented by Roberto and and now we want to also welcome to the floor Peter bomb in about a his director of business development and not used of the gold standard Foundation Christian Danika his director of land using carbon of South Pole say he owes alanya he is a special advisor of global issues as in un CCD Richie hue his regional director of Asia for the Environmental Defense Fund and well I didn't introduce myself I can follow so this a problem officer of ethos also for the regional for the region of the Andes so this panel we want to make it as interactive as possible and we want to start with innovation I will shut the first question and then we can continue from from that point and maybe Harry you can explain you have already explained the scale but could you or someone in in the table can set something about what is innovative of these approaches and and then we come to your question oh so yeah well one thing is innovative nation the in the scale yeah so it's really such biocare systems already have existed for a long time but the programs they bring in a market-based approach where the people get access so we work on the demand side we work with the with the MFIs and also the supply side with the local Commission's that construct us and yeah that's that's a system so it's and it's the scale well I don't know if that was part of the kind of the of the the question but we are in Indonesia we have now thirteen thousand households with biogas digesters and you can hear that twelve thousand okay do you have a question okay yeah could you yeah maybe you can repeat the question because it is to the expert from Peru I'm Charlotte from National Council for sustainable development India we have exhibition upstairs my question is to the expert from Peru that analysis which were showed about agro-ecological practices whether it is pure organic farming or it is organic farming or organic manure mixed with chemical fertilizer because we have found in our experience ok we have found in our experience with large number of farmers small farmers if you directly take up only organic farming it's not viable because if it is not based on soil health analysis right so if you just put organic and soil health analysis requires different nutrients then your farming is not viable so I just want to find out from the expert from Peru what was their situation and if I can add something maybe you can address a little bit of what innovative approaches you have you have seen in in the experience in in Peru we made a clear sampling and the difference was food from the beginning the agro ecological group about 250 farmers were using were implementing different Agricole ajikko practices and have not used any chemical input for the last three years on the other hand the conventional farmers were practicing agriculture in a similar agro-ecosystem but we're using at least one chemical inputs and a results show and the practice shows in Peru that there is a very high viability for ecological farmers in certain conditions this is specifically related to the high Andes and what is innovated about this approach I think the strongest innovation whoo empowering what I reported was the close interaction between farmers organization sometimes powerful farmers organizations and development agencies made many times local NGOs or other groups even groups of restaurants teaming together to buy produce from them so I would say the most relevant innovation in this context belongs to social capital thanks you Roberta and did this bring me to the next question to Francisco what is the role of other players you present a case on coffee what is the role of private sector in in that you listen yeah actually one of the approaches we are pursuing is to convince Roasters buyers of coffee for them to understand what is the program behind low productivity and higher risk for climate change of these coffee farmers so we believe they can play a great role by contributing in these investments initial investments for scaling up these kind of alternatives for the farmers to increase yields and to become more better adapted to the climate change to manage better their the diseases and to also we also pursue the investments goes to diversification of the system so they can not only depend on coffee so they can also get income from other sources so I believe these players need these increasing in yield they need the farmers to be in the field producing because it's their own business they need to continue their own business so actually it's a win-win relationship they would expect by supporting these kind of activities of course the financial institutions together with the parrot sector may join support these initiatives and to become more resilient to the climate change Thanks Francisco Peter a question for you do you see enough room for for this type of innovation in the injurer sector in the carbon sector ok good morning everyone the I think that we're talking actually about a lot of different things here we're talking about certification we're talking about organic agriculture practices we're talking about carbon markets what Francisco presented is actually a case how you can increase the production of farming systems and also find solutions to fight things like coffee rust one of the say proxies that it gets out of there is the mitigation potential that is related to it which is I would say great news that that that that you can combine these things there might be other situations where the mitigation potential is not so large but where you still can achieve this increase meant in production with with adapting new practices so better composting or increasing increasing your soil fertility I was just getting a figure that in 2013 24 billion tons of soil has been lost again and a lot of these initiatives actually look at how can we recover these soils and make them more productive again if carbon markets can help with that I think that is that's great we need any kind of finance that helps with that whether this violence will maybe rather come to low-carbon supply change that is actually a concept in which I believe more where we see we will see a lot of movement as the coffee roasters and the coffee supply chains himself have an interest it's still being in business in 10 or 20 years from now so you see in these sectors and ever-increasing willingness to invest in supply chains and increase the production sustainably at source when it when it really comes to the carbon component I think there should be some concern expressed as well the negotiations during the week and also next week and next year in Paris are making our making process I think there's a lot of new thinking going on and a more decentralization of contributions but also the question is going to be who's going to pay for all these actions that we want to see on the ground and we're always talking about leveraging private capital but in fact there's not too much private capital in the rooms here and not in the negotiation rooms either so these are examples where it can actually work and where I think the certification for example also leads to other side effects than just these effects but I do have a concern more about about the financing part of say the overall green transition but we will definitely talk about it more in and I definitely think that finds requires innovative mechanism on incentives maybe Ricci you can it gives us a little bit of background about market innovations that you have seen in the field that can bring this to scale for instance ICT can you all hear me oh great so my name's Richie Ahuja with the Environmental Defense Fund and terrific presentations from Harry Francisco and Roberto and we are doing something similar on the ground in India and so I'm going to draw up on that well of experience as well where we're working with about 70 80 thousand households for biogas units about 100,000 households for cook stoves and 2030 thousand farmers it is a landscape approach and I'm I'm loving the fact that everybody here is talking about landscape approaches and one thing I would caution on is sort of on the finance pieces that don't do this for the carbon finance what you do this for is because it makes economic sense for the farmer so it has to start from that place and if it so happens that in the process because we're doing all the things right you're going to get some benefits which are carbon benefits it is then up to the aggregator or the government in play or whoever to figure out if you want to monetize that asset and if you see value in monetizing that asset to drive or catalyze more transformation on the ground so the jury is still out but it is certainly I'm glad that more and more people are exploring this Avenue it's not a done deal yet there's also some issues around permanence so we need to think through on that as well but I think the rigor that needs to be done there's nothing we need more and more rigor more and more data points to show that what's being done is real that the development effects are really what we say they are that transaction costs are manageable on finance there's various sources of finance we have leveraged some monies from you know this Oda and philanthropic funds to build institutional capacity to test things out but there's huge amounts of money that governments like my government in India for example spends on development that's their business they spend on agriculture so there's budgetary line items we should think about how they can be leveraged and used better and made more efficient there's money from credit agencies where a lot of the small farmers on our credit so can we figure out ways to get debt to them which is low-cost debt there's social impact investments and then there's also the whole carbon deal so the idea is to figure out ways to blend all this together and come up with a solution that works for that particular place and context coffee farmers cent or into cash crops so they may perhaps have more availability in terms of credit creditworthiness and if they have tenure on the line etcetera hours you've talking about a small-scale farmer in upland or dryland agriculture in central India then your issues are they're a little bit there's issues around credit worthiness and availability of banking etc but all this is changing so there's places you've talked about ICT you know phone banking is coming into play in Africa phone banking is happening in India now just right off the phone phone systems credit is being made more available to the farmers GIS systems are being brought in to apply to ensure that farm ownership is clearly defined and all this is very very exciting because it's going to open up the space for the farmer to again access the funds that the farmer needs to optimize land use and also all this information system is going to be very valuable for the farmer in the end also to take the right decisions in the end where I come from on all this is that the farmer is really the best optimizer of resources on the ground they're not in the business of wasting resources but what they do best is you know if they have the right amount of information they'll take the debt right decisions the challenge is getting them the information thank you and moving from innovation to livelihood so resilient naively hood's Christian maybe you can explain us how these approaches from the landscape perspective builds on resilient livelihoods I'll project there you go thank you thanks for the question and actually we did start a while ago what which he said you shouldn't do which is looking a lot at carbon finance and we collected some experience on that in a in a organic farm in a organic farming focused project and we draw some lessons from that basically the project was not only organic farming itself but it was an intervention to save forests it's a LED intervention in the end so what was done is basically the upscaling of conservation and organic farming in Mason millet production through activities such as compositing precision planting and erosion harassing and so on but we framed that also with additional activities fairly soon which were around enabling conditions to allow that had to happen for example fire management there was a lot of wildfires that spread from other farms or from poaching activities into the fields which and then burnt the biomass that you needed for the organic farming and we also needed to diversify the workload over the year so we looked at honey production and we looked at and nutrition gardens next to the villages so that created more work when there was no other work to do and we looked also into fertilizer producing trees such as tighter BIA and additional food crops such as Moringa and finally we framed that as I said with a common methodology using the VCS and the CCPs and so what we found is that actually the carbon finance in the end was only you needed to kick-start activities at the start and then the project is sort of rolling out itself by itself now of course it's being you know supported ongoing with carbon but the the project managed to to raise 30 percent productivity of a glove staples outputted managed to generate $400 aprox of income per honey farmer per year which is about replicating the income they had before so we saw that carbon was an excellent Kickstarter and if there would be a better carbon price we could do a lot more because the project is at 800,000 hectares with several hundred thousand people so it could be rolled out and I hope that in the negotiations that you know the enabling conditions will be set for that so maybe some lessons there one was that the it was key to maintain the to avoid leakage and maintain that conditionality that we know we do this for a purpose and which also includes mitigation as honestly for the local population as the second most important priority but the other finance providers most important one and therefore it was key to make sure that there was a land use planning set for example there were bore holes that were dried up since decades partially and before rehabilitating those since starting organic farming that we looked at is that in a biodiversity cornea or or not and then we focused on those that community said and we looked after that are not in the middle of an area that is sensitive our second point is that work generation was key you don't want to generate more outcome with less work because then people spend that time opening new areas and it fasoli this was also little facilitated because it's really a non market environment there's almost no one going to the markets at selling excess crops so as long as they have this production they need and a little excess for paying school fees for kids there's not a lot of expansion going on and with regards to that negotiations I mean it would be nice if the technologies that have been presented here and then are being used at the landscape approach could receive the adequate support by either market-based mechanisms or by the Green Climate Fund or other discussions that are ongoing it's going slow so meanwhile what the positive messages all these projectors have been mentioned here are probably the most sexiest one that you have on the voluntary car market it's hard it's not a big market but meanwhile those are those projects that probably fetch the best prices things thank you I tend to talk too much and so if you please have questions just raise your hands meanwhile I have one for the case holders Harry Francisco Berto basically your cases were talking about mitigation and how you can reduce the amount of carbon output what about adaptation and food security well actually the use of the bio slurry also has great benefits for the food security and the adaptation first of all the food security now because it's yet used the bio salary is often used for growing new crops nearby in the house so this new particle vegetables and food crops coming into the home system yeah and then next to that the get fertile as I mentioned it's a good fertilizer and it's because it's also containing the micronutrients it's improving the soil condition the soil structure so that is also making an impact on the resilience and yeah depth against possible negative radical impacts and climate impacts so I think there's clearly an adaptation benefit as well maybe you want to add more on that okay okay yeah from we one way of looking at this is farmers are already by using improve endure their their income they would be able to buy some other food that they already taking a yet because of the they have a very low income but we are also increasing or encouraging the farmers to diversify their production in the case of product they also are producing honey bee and they are getting income from there we have seen in other cases of diversification that farmers themselves were able to pay the renovation of the plant of the coffee plantations because other sources that they are selling recently like a small farming small vegetable facilities are they are selling to the market they also having chicken eggs and some small animals and some cows and they are diversifying in this way they are reducing the risk and they are getting income from other parts so this is our contribution for the food security in food insecurity they already have oh yeah thank you very much my name's bill her ditch from Australia thanks for the fantastic presentations of the case studies I just had a question for the panel about the application of this type of innovation to broader scale landscapes we've talked a little more about small holders here but in Australia for example we've got millions and millions of hectares of extensive rangelands some on the edge of deserts and we're doing some work in the north on the application of technology by way of better water access for large large areas opportunities to increase biodiversity sell grazing and reduction of wildfire so just a general question to the panel about the application of organic farming or agro-ecological farming processes to broader scale landscapes around the world because in a way because of the climate issues and adaptation and mitigation will rely a lot on big areas of land being recovered and rehabilitated and put into better food production for giving me the opportunity to also put the my hair in the soup of this this issue and I agree with with your your question this is how this very innovative examples on cases that I am very grateful to be here mean here this morning and listening to these very highly relevant examples at the small scale and how large-scale operations also can can benefit from this issue how can this change can be driven not only at the at the on the ground but also the financial aspects this is a challenge that we have in front of us and if we include in this in this in this soup as I said the the negotiation process of where why we are here in in Lima today the Climate Change Conference well let me say first that I work in the other convention that came out of three or one of the three creo there were three conventions for those of you who don't know if you already know I'm sorry I would have to repeat this the climate change convention is only one of the three real conventions that were agreed upon in 1992 the other one is biodiversity Convention and the desertification convention I work in the desertification convention from that angle I can say that it is a challenging to to see the common denominator of these presentations the soil organic carbon or carbon content in the soil how is this going to be adopted and embraced by the negotiators in the in the I mean some kilometers away from here this is not something that we can hope and we can wish this is something that we have to advocate and fight for and 20 years have passed by discussing about in the inclusion of land and soil into the negotiation of climate change and nothing has happened in Kyoto in Curtin 1997 for example III at that time I had my hair black we in Kyoto the the Europeans they said you know we want a cane Kalli pure a great protocol chemically pure means means land and forest out of the negotiation and that was what they got no they got the Kyoto Protocol the way they wanted it this energy business and now in order to include the the issues of land and soils and water and for a vegetation it's going to be challenging Christiana Figueres mentioned this month this past Monday she wants an universal agreement for Paris universe of the world Universal includes this issue but I don't know how it is going to happen if we only well it's good that we have this this innovative cases and that we reflect and highlight the the issue of a soil carbon content but we have to pass this message in events like this and individually to those negotiators there are other issues on not only on mitigation mitigation is great and good as well the issues about adaptation and food security what happened to other indicators that are out there like for example the land productivity dynamics net primary product how can we use that Indyk in the within the framework of this convention or the trends in land cover these are a lot the indicators for the resilience of the of the land so there are options that we out there many research is has been done that it can be used and this is one side the other side is a financial issue it's true that that there are many resources out there that the national level in other investing and private investments but how to jumpstart how to drive this change how the Green Climate Fund or the Jeff or the CDM or all these other financial mechanisms that they discussed here for years and years in the convention how can this be the seed to create this change and I don't see the eligibility of projects that have this this soul component or land component be included Richard Wright the the gentleman from you mentioned sorry you mentioned about the methodology not being agreed by the CDM so you have to work on this methodology to include the soil carbon content but this is not the only case how we can do this to actually make this project eligible for for this carbon financing and adaptation finance this is the challenge we have in terms of metrics also sure I'll just take one minute it's a very good question on scale love it one I think want to bring up the issue of adaptation mitigation I think it's not a question of either/or we live on a spectrum so no matter what you do on mitigation off and you get adaptation benefits or a few packages inhabited updation you get mitigation benefits what's important I think is for us to know where we are and what those elements are the components how much and in terms of scale we are having these negotiations and and it's great and I think they can add value in terms of trying to drive scale but really scale happens at home it happens is driven by local interests which has in the individual farmer and by national interest we need to serve those and to do that we need to basically these examples are great and we need more and more of these examples that are very much data driven with strong metrics that really make the economic case you know governments typically look at money going into this sector as a cost and we need to start looking at that as an investment and the moment we can show very categorically that here are the returns on that investment then you can really start getting some scales so the more number of projects you had the good more data you have you get build confidence so that's kind of the stuff that we are beginning to see with some of our work we're moving from project-based approaches now to try and drive change across a whole district but small holder farmers in Vietnam the work we were doing in the Delta a turn are now replicated and have the government suddenly woken up and they asking some good questions and I think in the end the government is the big driver of scale when it comes to investments in this sector as well including you know you need the private sector you need other financing but in the developing countries often the government plays a pretty decent role especially on interest structure etc so to your question in the organic movement we don't pretend to have answers for yet for every farming system every country in the world but there are already about 70 million hectares certified organic worldwide and Australia is one of the top five countries in terms of acreage in organic land so and this only is when we count third parties certified in Africa Asia in Latin America there is much more there is not yet certified but the principles are applied on farm so we hope to have this increased but certainly we need to do much more research and outreach let's move to Finance and beta do you see what do you see the role where do you see the role of private investors private capital in to to reach this scale that we are talking about it's a very important role if sustainability was the business-as-usual we wouldn't be sitting here so the the conventions and all the efforts at the the case studies they all show how it can be done or they want to kind of break through the existing systems and come up with some new solutions so we make things like the Green Climate Fund and we do case studies and we do development aid but if we compare those sums with the finance that is yearly going to conventional agriculture if you know if we would ask something for Mars to look at how we do things here you would be saying what what what are you doing it this doesn't make any sense the only way in which we can make this transition is by changing the behavior of private capital that's I'm totally convinced of that and it seems so obvious to me as well fortunately we're seeing that so there is more and more corporates like Unilever that are making commitments and also putting you know they walk the talk they make they work towards more sustainable practices and there's many others do that as well there's movements in Europe in the u.s. of people that start to appreciate again more say also intrinsic values of of food and and regionality and and things like that so I think there's hope but there's a lot that needs to be done yet and true certification we we are partly doing that there is examples also of Germany where a city actually paid for organic certification of farmers that surround the city they said we pay for the certification because they knew if farmers would be organically certified in the surroundings it will improve the quality of the drinking water in the city because they're not allowed to use pesticides and chemical fertilizers anymore there's a lot of good examples out there already but for real change the behavior of this big lump of investments that is really going into agriculture that has to change and this is I think what we're all trying true institutions through to laws and regulations through certification and Christian so do you see a role of the payment for ecosystem services schemes to increase the to reduce the impact on forest degradation then yes this time it works I do thank you I think it was one of the two big frameworks that everyone is waiting for to be set and that everyone is working on to be said one is payment for ecosystem services at a global scale driven by a large-scale mechanism where the rules are set and the reward is clear and then the private sector could deliver very significantly on that and so therefore the investment to get that done should be from the public sector should be in setting those rules you know and on the other hand setting the reward in the end but not crowding out the implementation which often can be done by private players or together with the public place and the other one the other big framework is the deforestation free supply chains and clean supply chains that we are looking at if that compromise that has been done this and last year is really delivered on by lots of large companies and we had decided when incop some days ago people are moving and companies are moving but they're not really clear yet how they will do it to get to this very shorthand call to 2020 if that is getting traction then you know all these technologies here and all these initiatives that sit on this desk will you know will get a big boost and can probably partially even forget about the ecosystem service payments because there's enough Drive without them thank you the reality is that the carbon official car markets are collapsed so where are you going to sell these carbon credits yeah well many things have been mentioned by other panelists that I would like to reinforce and that is for example also that yeah don't do this for carbon finance know it the objective is the economic benefit of the farmer still for the carbon finance can help to take her to kick-start changes no and another aspect that has not been mentioned is that the strong monitoring impact now so interestingly is that for carbon credits you will need to monitor so that also helps to to focus and to improve your interventions because you have you have to really to follow up on what you are doing now so additionally also in the biogas that were there were bad systems better models which were distributed and the people just count how many models digesters have been distributed now and with the water we know now well it's in all the sectors it's the same so the carbon finances that effect of good monitoring and seeing what works about nothing does not work but yeah clearly so where we sell the carbon credits in the voluntary carbon market and biogas carbon credits are trait and relatively good price but of course it's far from sufficient what is needed to make a real transition and a real impact now somehow also Peter mentioned we need to change behaviour of private capital maybe yeah there's also still so much lacking but in the two cases we have small steps because in the Indonesia biogas program and bio slurry does a real contribution from Nestle know and that was so the program is in nine provinces at the and it performs best where Nestle is involved now they support the farmers and would produce their milk and in Kenya we also after the cooperation with EECOM trading which is a large coffee company and it's also investing in improving the agricultural practices and also the base salary is a day they submit and they are supporting with the private capital as well no but it's far far from what is really needed and I would say also that yeah carbon markets in the project-based approach which just is the small start to watch really promoting low-carbon growth well I know that there are a lot of questions but we ran out of time so I have one last question - sir here - and this this session so here was what lesson lessons can we take for the current coming sustainable development calls discussions hello yes with the with the topic at the this session the how is it that the in the sustainable development goals that are being negotiated in New York from December this December to to the next August or September next year there are 17 goals and out of the 17 14 make a reference to learn so water and vegetation 14 out of the 17 so how is this global Universal negotiation in New York is going to be reflected as well in the negotiations of this this this convention on climate change because what we have seen here today this morning I mean these three very we benefit from this innovative cases in which organic agriculture has has a role to play and the approaches to climate change are really evident there but how is this going to be reflected in the practical approaches to the implementation of the SDGs it depends on the on the national and regional structures and negotiations that are going to run dynamic situations that the different countries and regions have how they will see and face these sustainable development goals the sustainable development goals at the same time they will have targets so what it could be good approach is to have make sure that some of the targets that this sustainable development costs have contain the issues of land and so for example I know that target 15.3 is the the achievement of land degradation neutrality which is like my integrity and prevention and the same with in food security the financial structures of that that accompany the assurance of a secure world with the regarding food and and feed so this this issue of political negotiation financial aspects also include what the presenters mentioned the how to increase social capital how to increase livelihoods how to increase governance at the local level how to interact between the the small-scale farming and the large-scale operations in within the same a corridor within the same country these are the issues that perhaps we should bring to the table and at the core of the negotiations not only of this convention and climate change but also the convention of the certification and the convention biodiversity as well as to highlighted in the net in the in New York how we can do this we can as I said provide the message like demands like this but also talk individually to the negotiators and highlight this is important and this is a priority for the majority of the countries even even Germany even Australia even India these all these countries are based have a substantive based on on agricultural production and how is it that we can tap and harness that that issue so this is what I take home with from this event but thank you for asking thank you sir Hugh thank you all the panelists and thank you all the audience for for being here I know that we have to close the session the lunch is waiting for us there are still a lot of questions I see a lot of hands arising so but you already know his faces you can approach them to the breaks or to lunch or do the coffee's and ask the questions more specificity thank you all I think we deserve an applause [Applause] you",
