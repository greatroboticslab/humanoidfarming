1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:06,240
my name is Zach buckle and I run a

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,360
Halfacre vegetable farm that's projected

3
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:13,040
to produce $100,000 worth of vegetables

4
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:17,880
this year and I don't actually like

5
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:21,400
gardening I used to love it and I still

6
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,119
love certain parts of growing vegetables

7
00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,599
but I spend 40 hours of my week growing

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:29,720
vegetables for other people so when it

9
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:32,840
comes to gardening having a smaller

10
00:00:29,720 --> 00:00:35,280
space SP in my backyard where I get to

11
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:38,000
grow whatever I want my passion is just

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,280
not what it used to be so I don't really

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:43,760
like spending a lot of time watering

14
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,000
weeding planting

15
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,280
seeding doing the

16
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,600
whole romantic aspect of gardening that

17
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:56,199
people talk

18
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:59,160
about so because of my lifestyle right

19
00:00:56,199 --> 00:01:01,199
now I try to automate as much as

20
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,039
possible and and spend as little time in

21
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
the garden as possible because really

22
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:07,200
when it comes down to it all I want to

23
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,840
do is eat delicious vegetables that I

24
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,840
grew myself and be around pretty plants

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,280
as much as possible I don't want to deal

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,799
with all the maintenance and work

27
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:18,799
involved in creating that

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,560
stuff this

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:24,119
season I spent very little time in the

30
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:26,079
garden basically because I had to spend

31
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:30,159
very little time in the garden

32
00:01:26,079 --> 00:01:33,640
because I originally planned on turning

33
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:36,880
this very bad into a food factory to

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,960
make all sorts of fun videos

35
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,119
explaining gardening techniques that are

36
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:45,640
very similar to my farming

37
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:47,280
techniques uh but the reality is I had

38
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,920
almost no

39
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:53,880
employees from March through

40
00:01:50,920 --> 00:01:55,600
July um I didn't really get employees on

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:57,759
the farm until about mid July and that's

42
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,719
a whole long story

43
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,320
but I was exhausted just didn't have the

44
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,159
energy to come in here and lift a finger

45
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:07,920
I even looking at a plant growing was

46
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:11,000
depressing to me because I had so many

47
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,879
other fires to put out on the farm um

48
00:02:11,000 --> 00:02:15,040
especially any kind of weeds or anything

49
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,080
like that because honestly the weeds in

50
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,480
here are nothing compared to what I was

51
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,160
dealing with on the farm I had literally

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,800
whole beds full of dandelions I was

53
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,879
digging out and my back was killing me I

54
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:31,000
was literally

55
00:02:25,879 --> 00:02:33,400
bedridden uh for days um just because I

56
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:35,519
was doing all the work myself and that

57
00:02:33,400 --> 00:02:37,120
just kills a lot of your motivation for

58
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,560
doing this kind of

59
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:45,239
stuff but the cool thing

60
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:48,800
is I sort of took track of what was

61
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:52,159
actually in this bed a couple weeks ago

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:54,360
and there's still 36 pounds of food that

63
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,720
came out of this bed and I didn't do

64
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,920
anything my mom came out here and

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,120
watered once a week for about 2 hours

66
00:02:58,920 --> 00:03:03,799
using this sprinkler this wobbler

67
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,159
sprinkler and might have pulled a few

68
00:03:03,799 --> 00:03:07,159
weeds here and there but other than that

69
00:03:05,159 --> 00:03:09,159
there's nothing that happened and this

70
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:11,040
bed's a disaster to be honest there's so

71
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:13,120
many things that went wrong here I

72
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,840
planted it I spent about 20 minutes

73
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,159
planting it in June and then I just

74
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:20,519
forgot about it because I just didn't

75
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,000
have time or motivation and so this was

76
00:03:20,519 --> 00:03:25,360
supposed to be filled with carrots right

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:27,080
now and turnips and there's nothing but

78
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:29,879
all of the stuff that I planted in here

79
00:03:27,080 --> 00:03:32,239
like the scale the broccoli cauliflower

80
00:03:29,879 --> 00:03:35,000
still has a bunch of weight right there

81
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,879
and there's celery and uh green onions

82
00:03:35,000 --> 00:03:38,319
and stuff behind me there's still a

83
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:39,920
truckload of food there's actually

84
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,280
probably a lot more than 36 pounds in

85
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,519
here and I did a video explaining what I

86
00:03:42,280 --> 00:03:46,360
mean by 36 pounds but I mean I basically

87
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,959
spent an hour of my time this whole

88
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:50,799
season managing this bed and that's what

89
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:54,159
happened I think that's a pretty good

90
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,599
result um and that all comes down to the

91
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,840
style of gardening that I teach in my

92
00:03:55,599 --> 00:04:00,879
gardening course Link in the description

93
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:03,079
on that but

94
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:06,400
it just actually turned out to be really

95
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,959
cool because it proves how little effort

96
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,760
you need to put into a garden to really

97
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:13,519
produce a lot of food you just got to

98
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:16,040
set it up right and use a couple of fun

99
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:17,600
tools and gadgets that I'm going to go

100
00:04:16,040 --> 00:04:20,759
over in this

101
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:23,639
video so one of the reasons why I was

102
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:25,600
able to spend zero time in the garden

103
00:04:23,639 --> 00:04:29,039
and still get a good result was because

104
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:30,360
my mom was watering every week but if I

105
00:04:29,039 --> 00:04:34,840
didn't have myom

106
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,160
mom this could do the same thing this is

107
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:40,479
the

108
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:43,720
raino two Zone automatic water timer

109
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,120
battery operated and this could

110
00:04:43,720 --> 00:04:48,560
basically do the same thing as what my

111
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,320
mom did I just got this thing and I set

112
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:52,320
it up and I didn't even look at the

113
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,639
manual and I figured out how to use it

114
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,039
in about five minutes which is actually

115
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,759
a big deal because I've

116
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:02,280
used much fancier water timers on the

117
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:05,360
Farm I am using much fancier ones on the

118
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:06,720
farm and it take me about a half an hour

119
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,240
to figure out how to use them because

120
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,160
they're much more complicated watering

121
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:15,400
schedules and stuff and I had to read

122
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:17,720
the manual on those this is amazing

123
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:20,639
because all I had to do is figure out

124
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,440
how all these buttons work and it's real

125
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:26,560
simple there's two zones you could use

126
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:28,400
on this um I'm only using one cuz I

127
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,280
don't have drip irrigation set up here

128
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:33,160
but so this is set up just for our

129
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:38,680
wobbler sprinkler but I set this

130
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:41,639
for um 2 hours once a week and it's very

131
00:05:38,680 --> 00:05:44,479
easy to do this um like I said I didn't

132
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:48,039
even use the manual but you could set it

133
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:50,639
to uh two different zones so said you

134
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:53,120
say if you had uh drip tape along

135
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,960
flowers next door you could set those

136
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,080
onto a different time and I'm not going

137
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:59,680
to go over gory details on how to do

138
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:02,479
this they have great stuff on their

139
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,160
website um and how to set it up but it's

140
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,720
very easy I mean compared to the one I

141
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:10,759
use on the farm it is lightyears easier

142
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:14,280
they actually come with um Teflon tape

143
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:17,400
to uh make your seal leak proof which is

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,080
a big deal I love using Teflon tape on

145
00:06:17,400 --> 00:06:23,199
the farm for all of my Plumbing I pretty

146
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,880
much end up using that more often than

147
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:27,479
not on all of my fittings because

148
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:30,479
especially with plastic fittings cuz

149
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,400
plastic fittings generally fail and have

150
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:35,280
terrible leaking problems so including

151
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,800
teon tape is a big deal um I actually

152
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,240
had to switch to a brass fitting for the

153
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:42,280
fancy water timer I use on the farm so

154
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:46,880
it's nice to have that Teflon

155
00:06:42,280 --> 00:06:49,599
tape and uh the bottom line is with this

156
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:53,039
tool is you can walk away from the farm

157
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,160
for a long time and by Farm I mean your

158
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:59,680
backyard farm AKA a garden uh I use farm

159
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:04,440
and garden pretty much interchangeably

160
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:06,879
um English is a funny language but uh

161
00:07:04,440 --> 00:07:09,440
it's a constantly evolving language but

162
00:07:06,879 --> 00:07:13,039
anyway the cool thing about this is you

163
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:16,120
could set it and forget it and with all

164
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:17,240
things like that you know it you you

165
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:18,120
take that with a grain of Sal you're

166
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:19,840
still going to need to check the

167
00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:22,800
batteries and stuff all this takes is

168
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:24,120
two AAA batteries I'm sure you're going

169
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:26,759
to need to check those every once in a

170
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:28,680
while but bottom line is you can set it

171
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:31,039
and forget it and not have to worry

172
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:32,960
about watering because if I was to hand

173
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:37,680
waterer this Garden it takes about 20

174
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:39,479
minutes to a half an hour of my time and

175
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,000
you know my time is pretty valuable

176
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:44,000
right now in my life if you've got a

177
00:07:41,000 --> 00:07:46,960
family with kids 20 minutes half an hour

178
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,840
a week could be a lot so this saves that

179
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,960
time for you and it does it right the

180
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:54,240
thing I love about watering with the

181
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,759
sprinkler is when you set up a wobbler

182
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,080
sprinkler like we have in the garden it

183
00:07:55,759 --> 00:08:00,919
Waters so evenly but it takes a long

184
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:02,759
time you can't do that you know watering

185
00:08:00,919 --> 00:08:04,000
by hand you almost never do it right

186
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:05,720
because you don't want to sit there for

187
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:08,159
20 minutes on one plant to make sure

188
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:10,159
that water seeps in deep in the ground

189
00:08:08,159 --> 00:08:13,039
you know the best way to water is to

190
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:15,720
water very deeply and infrequently and

191
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:17,919
so this allows it to happen really

192
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:19,879
really easily because even when you do

193
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,720
it manually if you do it for two hours

194
00:08:19,879 --> 00:08:23,400
you got to come out here turn it on come

195
00:08:21,720 --> 00:08:25,120
out here and turn it off that's two

196
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,680
times you got to walk out here and if

197
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,280
your garden is you know 300 yards away

198
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:29,960
from your house that's kind of annoying

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:31,680
and

200
00:08:29,960 --> 00:08:35,000
the easier it is for you to water the

201
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,120
more likely you are to do it and so a

202
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:39,080
rain

203
00:08:36,120 --> 00:08:44,120
Point water timer like this is a really

204
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:45,680
simple way to make that happen um it's

205
00:08:44,120 --> 00:08:49,480
something that you got to have in your

206
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,399
garden tool Arsenal is a water timer and

207
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:54,360
this one's really really simple you can

208
00:08:51,399 --> 00:08:56,040
turn off one zone like I have because I

209
00:08:54,360 --> 00:08:59,160
don't want to use both zones all you got

210
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:02,320
to do is set it up so you say I this is

211
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:05,920
Zone one I wanted to select that and I

212
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,600
set it to 1200 a.m. but zero minutes and

213
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:09,480
that means it won't run at all because I

214
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,040
don't want this to just leak out water

215
00:09:09,480 --> 00:09:14,760
so you can set it up to just run one

216
00:09:12,040 --> 00:09:17,600
length of Hose um which is what I'm

217
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:20,640
doing and uh but if you wanted to run

218
00:09:17,600 --> 00:09:23,720
two you can and you know like I said

219
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,120
it's super easy to set up I just the the

220
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:28,680
you just use on off if you want to turn

221
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,959
it off you can just switch it to off and

222
00:09:28,680 --> 00:09:33,680
then if you want just turn it to manual

223
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:35,760
you could hold this down and say you

224
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,440
were here and you wanted to water for

225
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,079
like a half an hour just to germinate

226
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,880
some stuff in you could hold this down

227
00:09:39,079 --> 00:09:44,079
and set it to 30 minutes and then you

228
00:09:41,880 --> 00:09:45,360
know walk away and then deal with it

229
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,720
tomorrow or something there's all sorts

230
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:50,120
of cool things you could do with this um

231
00:09:47,720 --> 00:09:53,519
once you get good at watering in general

232
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:56,360
but uh that will save you time because

233
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,480
even if you think it takes 30 seconds to

234
00:09:56,360 --> 00:10:01,680
come out here and and turn this on

235
00:09:59,480 --> 00:10:04,839
if you're doing that you know more than

236
00:10:01,680 --> 00:10:08,600
twice a week that's something that you

237
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:11,640
got to check off your list every time uh

238
00:10:08,600 --> 00:10:14,440
you know throughout your week and it

239
00:10:11,640 --> 00:10:17,920
adds a little bit of pressure to your

240
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,200
life you know I have four Farm hydrants

241
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:22,560
that I'm managing on the farm to keep

242
00:10:20,200 --> 00:10:25,320
all the green houses watered so I love

243
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,880
having water timers because it gives me

244
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:30,040
peace of mind I don't have to think

245
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,760
about two of them at least you know it

246
00:10:30,040 --> 00:10:36,000
it really saves me a lot of mental

247
00:10:32,760 --> 00:10:38,959
effort and this does the same thing for

248
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:40,160
your garden so definitely look into it

249
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,399
there's a link in the description where

250
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:45,560
you can buy these

251
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,160
and I highly recommend you get a water

252
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,000
timer and honestly the number one way

253
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,279
that this thing is going to shine for

254
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,200
you in your garden is if you have drip

255
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:58,399
irrigation set up that's how I use water

256
00:10:55,200 --> 00:11:00,079
timers on my farm is because I'm

257
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,160
watering things like tomatoes and

258
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:03,800
cucumbers every single day for a certain

259
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,639
time period and that's where this is

260
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:09,680
going to shine you do not want to be out

261
00:11:06,639 --> 00:11:11,120
turning a farm hydron once a day for 45

262
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,040
minutes on and off it's going to drive

263
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:15,839
you crazy and if you are growing a large

264
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,440
amount of tomatoes and cucumbers in your

265
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:19,519
garden you're probably going to want to

266
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,320
have drip irrigation set up because

267
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:24,680
those don't like to get their leaves wet

268
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,680
so drip irrigation is a whole rabbit

269
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,600
hole and it it is somewhat complicated

270
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:31,560
to set up it's not complicated but you

271
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:33,360
do kind of have to know what you're

272
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:34,920
doing because there's a lot of water

273
00:11:33,360 --> 00:11:37,639
pressure gallons per minute kind of

274
00:11:34,920 --> 00:11:39,399
stuff to be aware of at least but um I

275
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:43,360
do go over that in my gardening course

276
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:45,639
by the way uh but the actual timer is

277
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:49,240
really going to be a GameChanger for you

278
00:11:45,639 --> 00:11:52,320
because it's going to control um how

279
00:11:49,240 --> 00:11:54,800
much water you put on the ground per day

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,760
like for example I'm watering my

281
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,279
tomatoes the it's the end of the season

282
00:11:56,760 --> 00:12:00,639
so I'm watering them very little but I'm

283
00:11:58,279 --> 00:12:02,480
still watering them 4 45 minutes a day

284
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:06,560
in my greenhouse and I have a water

285
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,240
timer for those and it just saves me a

286
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:10,040
lot of stress and I could also set it to

287
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:12,600
go off in the morning like way before I

288
00:12:10,040 --> 00:12:14,959
even get to the farm literally you could

289
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:17,839
water your garden or your farm while you

290
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:21,320
sleep and that's sort of a GameChanger

291
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:24,079
because um you could come out and do all

292
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:25,480
of the gardening stuff you need to do

293
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,279
and the garden's already watered it

294
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,199
doesn't like you don't have to worry

295
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:30,760
about getting sprinkled on while you're

296
00:12:29,199 --> 00:12:32,800
working in there that's really not a

297
00:12:30,760 --> 00:12:34,000
problem in a garden but in the farm it

298
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:35,760
does matter because we have a lot of

299
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:37,880
work to do in a greenhouse or something

300
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,680
while it's getting watered um so it's

301
00:12:37,880 --> 00:12:41,760
nice to have that checked off the list

302
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:43,440
before the day even really starts for us

303
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,680
but same thing goes for gardening

304
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:49,480
everything pretty much likes getting

305
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:51,480
watered while direct sun is not on it so

306
00:12:49,480 --> 00:12:54,720
it's a big benefit to just have it done

307
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:56,920
while you're sleeping and having it

308
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:59,320
automated on a daily basis for those

309
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:02,480
kinds of crops gives you a much higher

310
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:04,760
quality cucumber or tomato um most

311
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:07,160
tomato splitting issues happen because

312
00:13:04,760 --> 00:13:09,680
tomatoes are not getting watered evenly

313
00:13:07,160 --> 00:13:11,160
so they'll get like one inch of water

314
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,320
one day and half an inch the next day

315
00:13:11,160 --> 00:13:14,160
and that's where the splitting will

316
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,279
happen and then same with cucumbers

317
00:13:14,160 --> 00:13:17,800
getting bitter they get bitter usually

318
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:19,880
because the water's not even so if you

319
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:22,199
have a way to get that water even on

320
00:13:19,880 --> 00:13:24,000
them and you live in a climate where

321
00:13:22,199 --> 00:13:25,880
there's not a ton of rainfall you could

322
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:28,240
really take advantage of a of a water

323
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:30,639
timer like this and it's just going to

324
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:34,120
save you a lot of a headache and give

325
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,120
you a much higher quality product

326
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:40,480
basically so gadgets are great and all

327
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:43,120
and I love gadgets I love tools I use a

328
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:46,880
lot of them on the farm and in the

329
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:49,639
garden but they all can fail so I rely

330
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,480
on them all with a grain of salt you

331
00:13:49,639 --> 00:13:54,720
know when I first started

332
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,360
farming I got all excited about the

333
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,120
gadgets because I'm like oh it's going

334
00:13:56,360 --> 00:14:00,959
to make my life so much easier all my

335
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,759
stress is gone it's all automated I

336
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:06,079
don't have to worry about

337
00:14:02,759 --> 00:14:09,600
anything and then I got

338
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:11,480
a faucet that automatically shuts off

339
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:14,880
when the water level gets above a

340
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:18,199
certain level and it failed like one out

341
00:14:14,880 --> 00:14:21,519
of five times and it turns into a a

342
00:14:18,199 --> 00:14:22,720
flood of water in my wash Pack building

343
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,480
which is not really designed for the

344
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:30,560
floor to get wet that's happened like 20

345
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:32,360
times now and that's just one example

346
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:36,880
all sorts of stuff like this fails

347
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:40,199
automated vents automated fans tools

348
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:42,680
break you know um that's why I generally

349
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:45,000
like using hand tools at on the farm as

350
00:14:42,680 --> 00:14:48,040
much as possible as opposed to big

351
00:14:45,000 --> 00:14:48,800
mechanical tools or gas powered tools

352
00:14:48,040 --> 00:14:52,000
and

353
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,279
stuff but all these things can fail and

354
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:58,399
so even with a water timer like this no

355
00:14:55,279 --> 00:15:00,560
matter where it's coming from you know

356
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:01,560
there's moving Parts involved so you

357
00:15:00,560 --> 00:15:04,279
can't

358
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:07,399
just rely on it forever you know you got

359
00:15:04,279 --> 00:15:11,000
to pay attention to it sometimes these

360
00:15:07,399 --> 00:15:15,720
things they save you a lot of time and

361
00:15:11,000 --> 00:15:18,399
headache C like over time but there are

362
00:15:15,720 --> 00:15:20,079
points where they can fail so you just

363
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:21,360
got to take into account if this thing

364
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:25,759
fails is it going to be the end of the

365
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,639
world for you you know probably not uh

366
00:15:25,759 --> 00:15:30,600
like if you if this thing doesn't turn

367
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:33,959
on or something most likely you're G to

368
00:15:30,600 --> 00:15:36,440
be fine unless you're like germinating a

369
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:38,160
whole bed of carrots or something uh and

370
00:15:36,440 --> 00:15:40,360
you need it to come on every single day

371
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,240
for 10 days and it fails that's a

372
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:44,560
problem sure but just take that into

373
00:15:43,240 --> 00:15:47,720
account when you set these kinds of

374
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,160
automations up and tools of any kind

375
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:55,440
because they all fail you know all farm

376
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:58,360
tools fail at some point so you can't

377
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,639
just be in that uh naive state of mind

378
00:15:58,360 --> 00:16:02,440
that I was when I first started farming

379
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,000
and assumed it's all going to be fine

380
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:06,199
and dandy forever you know there's

381
00:16:04,000 --> 00:16:07,639
there's you still need to pay attention

382
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:10,040
to them and check on them every once in

383
00:16:07,639 --> 00:16:12,600
a while you know so I check the battery

384
00:16:10,040 --> 00:16:14,519
level on my water timers you know once

385
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:17,360
every couple weeks just to keep an eye

386
00:16:14,519 --> 00:16:19,199
on them you know stuff like scales I

387
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:22,600
keep the keep an eye on the battery

388
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:25,600
levels because if something like that

389
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,079
fails for me it's a big deal um on a

390
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:29,519
farm but for this it's not really that

391
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:32,120
big a deal but it's just something to be

392
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,319
aware of you know you need to be mindful

393
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:36,319
of all your tools and maintain them a

394
00:16:34,319 --> 00:16:40,839
little bit but it's easier to maintain a

395
00:16:36,319 --> 00:16:44,880
tool like this than maintaining a

396
00:16:40,839 --> 00:16:47,360
garden watering schedule by hand every

397
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:49,040
day or doing it by hand or whatever so

398
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:51,160
um just think of it that way it is

399
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,040
ultimately saving you a ton of time and

400
00:16:51,160 --> 00:16:56,160
headache and making your life easier it

401
00:16:54,040 --> 00:16:59,839
just requires less maintenance but it

402
00:16:56,160 --> 00:16:59,839
still requires maintenance

403
00:17:00,199 --> 00:17:06,480
so if you're interested in setting up a

404
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:09,559
garden like this where it takes very

405
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:11,319
little time to manage and can still

406
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:13,240
produce you the kind of results I talked

407
00:17:11,319 --> 00:17:16,919
about at the beginning of this video

408
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:20,160
I've got a free Garden starting guide in

409
00:17:16,919 --> 00:17:23,199
the description where I go over how to

410
00:17:20,160 --> 00:17:26,400
set up a garden like this in four simple

411
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:29,840
steps and give you the Bare

412
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,000
Bones necessary to build a garden like

413
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:36,280
this cuz it's not hard and it's a free

414
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,919
Microsoft Word document you can download

415
00:17:36,280 --> 00:17:40,799
save it and I have links to some of the

416
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:43,640
things you'll need to buy to make it

417
00:17:40,799 --> 00:17:45,000
happen and I highly recommend you check

418
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:48,320
