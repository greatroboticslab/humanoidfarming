  "text": "hello and welcome to my garden today we are looking at the onions that I have planted here in containers I started these from seed way back in January February and we are now nearing the end of July and these onions have all flopped over as you can see that's a sure sign that they are almost ready to harvest I've left them laying here like this for a week or so try to refrain from watering them so that they dry out a little bit if we just zoom in here you can see these are my yellow Globes they have flopped over the necks are soft they've started to develop kind of a skin around them here so I think it's time to pull them out and let them dry out and cure and hopefully we can store them for several months so hopefully I can get a nice supply of these cured and can store in a cool spot in my basement so I'm going to start off by pulling these onions and storing them in my garden Wagon here so I think this wagon here is going to be a perfect spot for them to cure off for the next week or two they'll get lots of air flow we can store this in a spot out of the direct sunlight where there's lots of wind and hopefully this will be a great spot for them to cure so my onions aren't super huge but it's it's an improvement from last year for me personally especially these yellow Globes here they turned out really nice pretty happy with those so I'm just going to pull them all out here lay them out in my wagon I do have some Walla Wallas also in this tub on this side I don't know they could have been a little bit bigger I know Walla Wallas are normally a lot bigger than that but nonetheless this is what I got I'm pretty happy so just kind of finger around them gently pull them out so that they come out with all their roots so picking onions obviously a very easy thing to do definitely the yellow Globes are looking bigger than the Walla Walla so I don't do a lot of in-ground gardening other than my potatoes and I think these have done well for container gardening it's been very easy to maintain pretty easy to pull weeds out of these containers I think I gave them a fertilizer once or twice in the month of July early June so these little tiny ones here will probably get eaten up pretty quickly and in this tub it's all Walla Walla onions I tried to keep them spaced out so that they you know could get as big as possible I did a little spooning around them early July when they were starting to develop try to thin them out by picking the odd ones that were too close together again not a bad size these will be great just you know one for a meal when you need an onion these are going to be a nice size to cook with we cook with a lot of onions pretty much on a daily basis I'm adding onions to my cooking so I'm excited to have a good Supply that'll hopefully lasts me you know till the end of this year I just think that's beautiful it's like a bouquet of beautiful onions so I don't have a cold room per se in my basement we have in-floor heat in our basement so don't have a cold room set up down there unfortunately we didn't think about that when we built our house 20 some years ago it's a beautiful nice cozy basement with that floor heat but there is one corner of the the space and empty bedroom now that uh the core heat doesn't seem to be working very well never did so that room is actually extra cool it's in the north west corner of the house it doesn't get a lot of direct sunlight in that room so I think that's going to be uh my new cold room this winter so we're going to hopefully get some shelves set up in there to store potatoes and onions and my last container here is the ruby ring onion so these are a red onion again we've been picking these a lot and eating them fresh so this is my ruby ring onion Harvest here so there is my onion Harvest for 2023 not bad for a little garden so I'm going to leave these in this wagon to dry and cure I'll push them over in a spot that's kind of out of direct sunlight it gets lots of airflow if you want these stems here to kind of dry up maybe some more skin to develop around that and that will help protect it and keep it fresh so that it will store longer over these next few months so I've already done some harvesting of my garlic a few days ago that I didn't do any filming of but this is what I've gotten so far so this is a hard neck garlic variety that I planted last fall here in the in the ground some of the cloves were from my previous Harvest from last year that I replanted somewhere I purchased from the store so how you know that they are ready to harvest is when you look down at the base here and you can see that some of the leaves are starting to yellow and die back usually two to four leaves is a sign that these are ready to harvest and like the onions you should try and dry out the soil and not water them for a week or two before you harvest just so when you pull them out you don't do any damage if they're too wet so I have my soaker hose that runs through the garlic here into my lasagna garden bed so I'm running it every day or two so I didn't really dry it out in some of these spots like I should have and then as you can see when I tried to pull this one out it kind of ripped away the roots because it was a little too wet and soft so this one will probably have to be eaten right away it might not cure as well but just to show you give you an idea of the difference between a garlic clove that's well watered and some that aren't as well watered this one was growing right next to my soaker hose all summer same with that one there as you can see they're a lot stronger and bigger so watering definitely does make a difference this is probably the biggest garlic clove I've ever grown pretty excited about that one so the spot that I picked to grow garlic in is right next to some of my Choke Cherry bushes here which you can see are almost ready to pick and I'm dealing with a lot of suckers from the choke cherries coming into this area so I've been kind of battling that I'm not sure if this is the best place for the garlic I do want to try next year to grow garlic in containers because that's how I do most of my gardening I'm just not sure how they will make it through the winter in a container if the cold weather that we go through you know the minus 30 35 degree cold in the winter can be pretty brutal on any perennials that you're trying to keep alive so we'll see how that goes we can also plant garlic in the spring early early spring so I might do that as well but it's so easy to just put in the ground keep it watered very little maintenance and it's a great Easy Storage over the winter garlic is something that like the onions we pretty much are cooking and eating every day so the more I can Harvest and store myself would be great so I just want to show you how I'm just trying to kind of work around the clove here with my hand kind of pull away that dirt you want to be able to to pull it out without doing too much damage to the roots again it's a little bit pretty moist right here because I've been watering through here but I'm going to try and pull it out without doing too much damage you can use some kind of a potato fork or I'm just using my hori hori knife here kind of get under and then gently pull there we go the garlic something else you want to remember to do if you're growing garlic is to in the usually early July the garlic starts to send out these what we call Garlic Scapes so they shoot this out it's got seed in it so the garlic is trying to self-generate some new seeds so that it can you know grow some new garlic so you want to make sure that you are watching for these Scapes in your garlic and harvest them off that way the energy will go back down into the bulb and the garlic will keep growing and be bigger if you leave these on you know a lot of the energy is going to go into self-seeding so you want to just watch for those and make sure you chop them off they're usually kind of a spirally circle and they make a great item to cook with you can chop them up and put them into your cooking they have a nice garlic flavor as well so this is the Garlic Harvest you know it's not a huge huge amount of garlic but I think it's a great amount for two people my husband and I are the only ones living at home now so this will definitely last us a while um next year I planted the really double down maybe and grow a lot more garlic trying some new methods in containers maybe try growing some in the spring and see which works best for us so this hard neck garlic is is a good variety for you know our growing zone here in the Zone 3 Canada used to do really well so for now that's all I'm gonna do just chop back the uh the tops I'm just going to let them dry so that some of that dirt comes off naturally let them develop a little skin layer cut back these roots and get them ready for storage so thank you for joining me while I harvest my onions and garlic out of the garden so I'll be storing this Wagon in a spot kind of out of direct sunlight it's getting lots of wind we haven't been getting much rain so I'm not too worried about them getting wet we'll leave them to dry for a week or two and then hopefully they'll be ready to store in the basement thanks for watching hit that like button leave me a comment don't forget to subscribe
