00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:09,599
okay just a little video showing off the

2
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,400
tractor kind of a little bit about it a

3
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:13,860
little bit of a walk around and one

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:16,859
thing I kind of pointed out we uh

5
00:00:13,860 --> 00:00:20,220
that we were gonna do and actually just

6
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:23,279
did it but I the intro that I made uh

7
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:25,140
before we did it didn't work out so I'm

8
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,240
just redoing it right now

9
00:00:25,140 --> 00:00:29,099
but with the bucket the idea was we've

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:30,300
got the step hitch receiver we're gonna

11
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:31,800
put on it

12
00:00:30,300 --> 00:00:34,559
uh

13
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:36,540
took it down to the neighbors he welded

14
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,760

22
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:03,420
step bumper receiver 25 bucks at Harbor

23
00:01:01,860 --> 00:01:06,360
Freight something like that they're

24
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,159
pretty cheap I mean these things are you

25
00:01:06,360 --> 00:01:09,540
pick these up on eBay actually made for

26
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
the tractor

27
00:01:09,540 --> 00:01:14,220

28
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:15,600

29
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:17,280

got it mounted right on front of the

31
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,180
tractor here

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:24,360
I can use it for moving trailers around

33
00:01:21,180 --> 00:01:25,680
also uh you can buy you know hooks and

34
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,220

36
00:01:29,220 --> 00:01:32,520
in those hitches I know they sell hooks

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:33,840
they sell

38
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,759
stuff like that where you can hook a

39
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,860
chain up to it and then with the chain

40
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,659

41
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,220
