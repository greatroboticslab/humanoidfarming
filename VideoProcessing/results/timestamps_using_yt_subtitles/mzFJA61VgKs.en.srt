1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:05,799
thanks Amanda really appreciate being in

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:12,000
Seattle and enjoying this cool and wet

3
00:00:05,799 --> 00:00:15,360
weather um I uh um want to discuss a

4
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,800
concept today and right off the bat when

5
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,519
I looked at the title and I saw the word

6
00:00:17,800 --> 00:00:22,160
new in there I thought wow there is

7
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,160
nothing new I don't know if anybody

8
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:27,080
listens to Ted Talks they were talking a

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,480
few weeks ago on an episode about how

10
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,200
there's really nothing new in the world

11
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:37,480
and that we just sort of reinvent stuff

12
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:41,120
and so this is not new uh this is taken

13
00:00:37,480 --> 00:00:44,480
whole cloth from uh the new zealanders

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,039
and from the the uh British aisles and

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,559
so with that if you're you know if you

16
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:53,719
have to have new you need to go

17
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:55,960
somewhere else but um it it is a good

18
00:00:53,719 --> 00:00:59,719
concept of what we have some preliminary

19
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:02,640
data but it's a m mature technology and

20
00:00:59,719 --> 00:01:05,119
it used successfully um in different

21
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:09,479
parts of the world where it does this

22
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:12,040
where it rains um frequently and it uh

23
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:15,799
uh during the winter feeding period so

24
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:18,360
I'm going to talk about three sets of uh

25
00:01:15,799 --> 00:01:20,560
issues to just set the stage with what

26
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:24,280
the soil and water effects are from

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:27,360
feeding cattle um on pastures during the

28
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:29,680
dormant period uh that we have in in the

29
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:30,960
Mid-Atlantic uh part of the United

30
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,640
States

31
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:37,880
and then I'll talk about um wood chip uh

32
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:40,560
design and that's an a engineering

33
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:43,439
component and I I I failed to mention

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,399
that I have collaborators from uh

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,920
University of Vermont a biosystems

36
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:50,119
engineer Joshua Faulkner and a wood

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:53,200
scientist from Duck West Virginia

38
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,880
University who worked with uh wood chip

39
00:01:53,200 --> 00:02:00,479
issues on these uh um feeding

40
00:01:56,880 --> 00:02:03,479
areas and I'll I'll go into a little bit

41
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:06,920
biomass um preliminary data that that

42
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:07,920
we've come up with on on what's suitable

43
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:11,440
to

44
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:15,319
use so anyway within the midatlantic we

45
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:18,239
have uh uh about 1.1 million uh beef

46
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:21,319
brood cows and that's minuscule when you

47
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:23,680
look at you know the Plains and and or

48
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:27,080
or Texas you know it's like one County

49
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:30,360
in Texas could have um you know a third

50
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:33,160
of a third of this uh population so it's

51
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:37,480
it's not big but it's our main uh

52
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:39,680
activity um and our our herd sizes have

53
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:42,480
have increased you know we're we've

54
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:46,760
we've gone from in the last 30 40 years

55
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:49,200
from 15 to 20 head up to now 200 head

56
00:02:46,760 --> 00:02:53,560
and so that puts pressure on our on our

57
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:56,080
pastoral systems and and we uh you know

58
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:58,959
initially we we fed square bales and we

59
00:02:56,080 --> 00:03:01,080
had Barn kept animals and we we moved to

60
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,599
round bales and everything went outside

61
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:06,360
and there's some serious impacts with

62
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,000
that so what's a wintering site it's an

63
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:11,159
area where cattle are fed during the

64
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:14,640
dormant period um sites includes you

65
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:17,400
know stored feed um you you you have to

66
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:21,040
tram across to feed concentrates with a

67
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:25,760
tractor um sheltered area if if you need

68
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:30,480
it calf Hutches and a winterized uh uh

69
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:33,000
you know watering system to to uh um

70
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,680
complete the uh the system and this is

71
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:39,760
what we get you know I I I do this talk

72
00:03:36,680 --> 00:03:41,480
to to Farmers all the time and you know

73
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,439
they just nod their head they see this

74
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,680
they're the they're the brown Donuts in

75
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:49,200
our pastures at the end of the winter um

76
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:51,720
and you know here's a beautiful spring

77
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:54,120
picture and you see a a pasture on the

78
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:57,040
other side that has not been used as a

79
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,280
uh dormant feeding uh winter area and

80
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,720
then one on on on this this Paddock and

81
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:05,680
uh the differences are

82
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,319
tremendous you know it's uh they all say

83
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,599
that they don't do tillage but they

84
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,760
really do this is this is a pretty

85
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:16,160
severe tillage in a saturated condition

86
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:19,680
um so what you know I go back and it's

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,759
like the thing is it recovers fast and

88
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,520
Farmers forget like that they you know

89
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,880
they get ground cover again and they're

90
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:28,400
like hey everything's okay and they go

91
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:31,720
on and then they're back in the same

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:36,240
situation so I like to to use this

93
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,080
classic study um that Owens at Al I met

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:42,039
these guys right before they retired

95
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:45,120
they're from uh kakon Ohio uh they had a

96
00:04:42,039 --> 00:04:48,520
a wonderful ARS station there that was

97
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,720
uh closed down uh recently uh in The

98
00:04:48,520 --> 00:04:54,400
Last 5 Years but they had monitored

99
00:04:51,720 --> 00:04:56,720
watersheds across the place and and what

100
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,800
they did was they they uh did long-term

101
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:01,280
studies which we don't we can't afford

102
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:04,280
to do and which we don't do anymore but

103
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:06,919
they had a period of from 74 to 886

104
00:05:04,280 --> 00:05:08,720
where they continuously used a pasture

105
00:05:06,919 --> 00:05:11,080
they summer grazed and then they winter

106
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,680
fed on it and then they pulled the cows

107
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:16,160
out and they only grazed during the

108
00:05:12,680 --> 00:05:18,160
summer for another period of years and

109
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:21,680
then the final period they only

110
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:24,680
harvested hay and the results um they

111
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:27,400
had 60% of their sediment loss occurring

112
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:31,039
during the dormant period um not

113
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:34,360
surprising but the greatest losses um

114
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:36,479
were during March to June um you know

115
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:39,520
and they had 40% of their loss during

116
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,319
April and that's when our hydrologic

117
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:46,800
cycle is really letting go we have a lot

118
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:50,000
of spring rains and and uh uh a lot of

119
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,000
uh tillage by the

120
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:56,080
cows so this is just a uh you know it

121
00:05:54,319 --> 00:05:58,560
kind of gives you an idea of

122
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:01,840
precipitation precipitation was even

123
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,680
across all these years from 74 to 94

124
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,960
there's some there's some some uh um

125
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:11,599
fuzziness to it but look at the the

126
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:14,240
runoff events during this uh um 24 or 12

127
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:17,360
month use period of the pasture where

128
00:06:14,240 --> 00:06:20,280
they where they uh had cows on it they

129
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:22,840
had compaction and they increased uh

130
00:06:20,280 --> 00:06:25,479
runoff during that period and as soon as

131
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:28,520
they pulled the cows off and only had

132
00:06:25,479 --> 00:06:30,120
them grazing those runoff events even

133
00:06:28,520 --> 00:06:34,039
with the same sort of

134
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:36,759
rainfall uh activity dropped off you

135
00:06:34,039 --> 00:06:39,960
know uh significantly and then during

136
00:06:36,759 --> 00:06:43,759
the hay only again there was a a huge

137
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:46,680
reduction so we know that um you know

138
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:49,240
it's a just a nice um quantification of

139
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,960
the impacts of winter feeding on pasture

140
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:54,479
and then here's the the uh corresponding

141
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:56,720
sediment loss numbers and as soon as you

142
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,479
pull them off you know all your sediment

143
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:01,360
losses are during that winter feeding

144
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:03,879
period and are caused from from that on

145
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,919
in a pasture

146
00:07:03,879 --> 00:07:10,160
system the kicker for me and this is

147
00:07:06,919 --> 00:07:11,840
what I try to tell Farmers is that

148
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,440
you're you're killing your production

149
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,759
you you you know you've got um here's

150
00:07:14,440 --> 00:07:19,479
here's June 1 and here's percent here's

151
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,160
here here's when you're getting back to

152
00:07:19,479 --> 00:07:24,199
100% ground cover and and Through the

153
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,199
Years there were times when they were

154
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:30,160
well into the growing period and they

155
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:33,080
only had 60% ground um ground cover so

156
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,560
you know using your your your your money

157
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,960
crop as a winter feeding area does you

158
00:07:36,560 --> 00:07:41,440
know it's a it's a huge conservation

159
00:07:38,960 --> 00:07:42,479
effect to move those cows off of that

160
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:45,159
pasture

161
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,440
land in our neck of the woods and so

162
00:07:45,159 --> 00:07:51,479
this is what what we stole from the the

163
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:54,560
uh new zealanders and and the Brits and

164
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:57,840
the Scots and the Irish um it's a it's

165
00:07:54,560 --> 00:08:00,560
an engineered uh heavy use area they

166
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:03,400
call them out wintering p ads so if you

167
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,840
want to learn about how it's done and

168
00:08:03,400 --> 00:08:09,319
what the the Deep research that's been

169
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:11,800
done go go look at the British work and

170
00:08:09,319 --> 00:08:16,360
and and do a search on out wintering

171
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:20,440
pads so what you do is we have um really

172
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:23,080
good clay soils uh subsoils or B Horizon

173
00:08:20,440 --> 00:08:27,520
we just create these these humps and we

174
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:32,440
put in drainage and we added uh uh 57

175
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:35,919
aggregate Stone a good size um gravel uh

176
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:40,719
at a at a foot deep and then we um added

177
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:43,839
our our wood chip base uh to

178
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:45,959
that and you know we do have local

179
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,680
materials uh and that's that's an

180
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,200
advantage we have a lot of uh uh Eastern

181
00:08:48,680 --> 00:08:55,519
Hardwoods and a lot of scrap trees that

182
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:58,040
are not um uh valuable uh for the timber

183
00:08:55,519 --> 00:09:00,160
industry so we can chip those up it's an

184
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:03,360
environmental benefit but there's some

185
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,000
cost and management to it and and uh

186
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:10,120
French over in England they just wanted

187
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,680
to compare cattle performance on inhouse

188
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:16,240
versus keeping these cows out on a wood

189
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:19,200
chip pad and and basically they found um

190
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,480
that the wood chip pad from feed intake

191
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:26,519
and and uh you know carcass weight uh

192
00:09:23,480 --> 00:09:28,600
live weight we all similar or better

193
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:30,000
than than these other Management Systems

194
00:09:28,600 --> 00:09:32,800
of keeping cow

195
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:35,800
in and so there was there's no sort of

196
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,200
physical detriment to having cows

197
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,800
outside in the

198
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,600
weather so here's a picture of of the

199
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:44,959
one that we put in it was a a very low

200
00:09:42,600 --> 00:09:47,959
budget we had a Conservation District

201
00:09:44,959 --> 00:09:51,200
that helped us uh establish this uh you

202
00:09:47,959 --> 00:09:54,959
will notice that it's next to a uh nrcs

203
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,200
heavy um uh roofed winter feeding area

204
00:09:54,959 --> 00:10:00,959
so we combined a out wintering loafing

205
00:09:58,200 --> 00:10:03,680
pad with feeding area and they do

206
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,800
recommend not to feed on these out

207
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:08,079
wintering pads because you'll create too

208
00:10:05,800 --> 00:10:10,800
much concentration of manure around the

209
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:15,680
feeding area so you feed somewhere else

210
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:20,040
so there's there's the drainage um uh uh

211
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:22,839
pits and there's the gravel there was a

212
00:10:20,040 --> 00:10:25,120
drain pipe that went into those low

213
00:10:22,839 --> 00:10:28,800
spots

214
00:10:25,120 --> 00:10:30,880
um you can see our our deep soils with

215
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:35,200
uh

216
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,920
um and and this was the the out pipe and

217
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:40,959
so you do have to manage process water

218
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:44,120
and that scares our Farmers because for

219
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,639
them EPA looks at a pastoral system as

220
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:49,680
being benign and so they say oh well if

221
00:10:46,639 --> 00:10:52,240
we pull cows onto a pad we're creating a

222
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,079
point source but I mean the the

223
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:55,720
economics have to come into play how

224
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,920
much damage are you doing to your

225
00:10:55,720 --> 00:10:59,959
resource so we put in a standard septic

226
00:10:58,920 --> 00:11:03,440
tank

227
00:10:59,959 --> 00:11:06,720
and uh um within that septic tank we had

228
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:09,560
a a pretty nifty little uh device that

229
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:13,200
was on a pivot and what it did was it

230
00:11:09,560 --> 00:11:16,480
allowed accumulation of effluent um into

231
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:19,440
the septic T tank the the flout would

232
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:21,600
come up to the to to a horizontal

233
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:23,920
position and then it would fill the pipe

234
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,959
and it would flop over and empty that

235
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:31,240
that tank all at once and that would

236
00:11:25,959 --> 00:11:31,240
dose our vegetative Treatment Center um

237
00:11:32,120 --> 00:11:38,240
and there's our there's our uh um

238
00:11:34,839 --> 00:11:40,399
vegetative uh our dispersal pipe for our

239
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,720
vegetative Treatment Center we set up we

240
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:47,120
set up another one um at our animal at

241
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:49,639
our Dairy science uh uh Farm in

242
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:51,560
Morgantown and we just uh tapped it into

243
00:11:49,639 --> 00:11:54,680
the Lagoon so those are your choices you

244
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:57,720
can either have a uh a treatment center

245
00:11:54,680 --> 00:12:01,880
or put it in a tank where you can spread

246
00:11:57,720 --> 00:12:06,000
it cows are very happy um they uh they

247
00:12:01,880 --> 00:12:09,279
had about 50 head and they they uh kept

248
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:12,160
these cows um on this pad for about a 65

249
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,320
day period during the the highest peak

250
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:18,639
of our hydrologic

251
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,519
cycle so costs everybody wants to know

252
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:23,959
what what do these things cost and and a

253
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:28,519
wood chip pad and this is a dollars per

254
00:12:23,959 --> 00:12:30,680
cow uh it's it's reasonably priced um in

255
00:12:28,519 --> 00:12:32,279
England I I think that they probably cut

256
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:36,120
all their trees down so there's a little

257
00:12:32,279 --> 00:12:39,480
higher cost um and roof winter this is

258
00:12:36,120 --> 00:12:42,199
the standard roof winter uh feeding barn

259
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:45,199
and manure storage is considerably

260
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:49,920
higher um pouring a concrete pad or

261
00:12:45,199 --> 00:12:53,040
gravel pad is uh gravel pad's about um

262
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:58,040
uh the same price or a little bit higher

263
00:12:53,040 --> 00:13:01,480
uh stocking density uh is is uh you do

264
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,079
have to give the the cows about 110 ft

265
00:13:01,480 --> 00:13:05,160
because you want them to be able to lay

266
00:13:03,079 --> 00:13:08,880
down you want them to be have

267
00:13:05,160 --> 00:13:12,880
comfortable and have have space um to to

268
00:13:08,880 --> 00:13:16,160
uh not be crowded um and and so these

269
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:18,920
are these are comparables these are our

270
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,839
nrcs uh standards that we that we

271
00:13:18,920 --> 00:13:25,800
compared this to because we don't have a

272
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:25,800
lot of uh um um

273
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:35,360
Alternatives so we we uh we had

274
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:39,120
a very preliminary uh uh sampling

275
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:42,959
protocol we we uh look we we did grab

276
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:45,240
samples at 12 storm events um you know

277
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:46,880
we'd run up you know hour and a half

278
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:49,160
whenever whenever it looked like we were

279
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:52,120
going to have a runoff event and go grab

280
00:13:49,160 --> 00:13:54,440
a sample um or the county agent would

281
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:57,440
help us do that and we had a pressure

282
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:59,120
pressure transducer in the in the septic

283
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,639
tank so that we could count how many

284
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:06,279
many times that flout raised and so we

285
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:10,480
knew what what our um amount of of of

286
00:14:06,279 --> 00:14:10,480
outflow was for the for the

287
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:18,720
system and we had reasonable numbers you

288
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:23,959
know we it again we compared this with

289
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:27,040
uh um an earn uh uh pad or a concrete

290
00:14:23,959 --> 00:14:29,560
pad and we were comparable to a concrete

291
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:33,560
pad and we were much less than an earth

292
00:14:29,560 --> 00:14:37,199
and um you know dry lot um for for

293
00:14:33,560 --> 00:14:40,279
numbers and uh you know the the the

294
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:43,480
Brits have found that uh uh you know

295
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:46,680
their estimation is that 90 to 90% of

296
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:49,519
the nitrogen and phosphorus is is in the

297
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:53,639
manure that's sort of held in this uh in

298
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:57,000
this filter bed um that that uh uh the

299
00:14:53,639 --> 00:14:57,000
cows uh loaf

300
00:14:57,759 --> 00:15:04,480
on again and with uh um looking at uh um

301
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:08,199
runoff

302
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:11,759
coefficients uh again we were we were uh

303
00:15:08,199 --> 00:15:15,360
um comparable with um concrete and we

304
00:15:11,759 --> 00:15:18,600
were much better than than earn um and

305
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:21,079
you can see uh you know our non- winter

306
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:23,720
periods what happened was we had rain

307
00:15:21,079 --> 00:15:27,759
events that stretched out to longer

308
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:31,079
times um uh between the rain events and

309
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:33,360
so the the wood chip pad acts as a

310
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:35,600
sponge and so the nice thing is that you

311
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,240
don't get an immediate runoff you get

312
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:40,639
some some capacity to hold a rainfall

313
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:44,360
event and then in the the warm weather

314
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:44,360
it'll actually evaporate back

315
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:51,440
out so this kind of shows that with uh

316
00:15:49,560 --> 00:15:54,519
these are these are individual rain

317
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:57,000
events uh the bigger the the uh the

318
00:15:54,519 --> 00:16:00,839
circle the the the the higher the amount

319
00:15:57,000 --> 00:16:03,720
of of rain and and you can see that um

320
00:16:00,839 --> 00:16:06,160
as as the duration of dry period as you

321
00:16:03,720 --> 00:16:09,759
as you have periods of dry between your

322
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:12,680
events uh less runoff occurs so there's

323
00:16:09,759 --> 00:16:15,000
that again that sponge effect to where

324
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,759
um you only after you get like repeated

325
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:20,600
rains day in day out then you'll that

326
00:16:17,759 --> 00:16:26,120
the system starts to get leaky so it's

327
00:16:20,600 --> 00:16:29,480
it's it's kind of a nice um system to to

328
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:32,560
moderate runoff um nutrients cycling

329
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:35,639
what do you do well um you you the

330
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:38,920
recommendations are to have um a layer

331
00:16:35,639 --> 00:16:42,120
of chips that are the filter bed chips

332
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,240
in the lower area that are fist size

333
00:16:42,120 --> 00:16:48,600
okay and those are difficult to find for

334
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:51,360
us because most American uh chippers uh

335
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:53,959
chip a very small chip and so we're

336
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:56,880
still struggling at finding that that

337
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:59,040
English style large chip for the base

338
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,639
but on the top you want a much more

339
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:04,760
comfortable finer chip for the animals

340
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:07,720
comfort and that gets pulled and spread

341
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,839
and and uh the English have found that

342
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:13,559
soiled wood chips um or

343
00:17:10,839 --> 00:17:16,480
composted um you know if you if you

344
00:17:13,559 --> 00:17:19,600
apply those you can get equal uh yields

345
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:23,199
at the same um you know application of

346
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:25,520
54 lbs of synthetic n so you can see

347
00:17:23,199 --> 00:17:28,000
there's there's quite a tie up of of

348
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,200
nitrogen that would be slow release over

349
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,320
time which is kind of nice with a with a

350
00:17:30,200 --> 00:17:37,400
woody

351
00:17:32,320 --> 00:17:39,640
product and like I'll go back the uh the

352
00:17:37,400 --> 00:17:41,880
the big chips there's no degradation so

353
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,960
you have to sort of sit and and pull

354
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:47,640
those off after the end of their life

355
00:17:43,960 --> 00:17:50,320
which is about five to seven years and

356
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:52,480
then it's like what do we do with those

357
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,600
I'm I'm still I'm really curious what

358
00:17:52,480 --> 00:17:57,880
the Brits do with their their big large

359
00:17:55,600 --> 00:18:00,919
uh chips that you can't spread on the on

360
00:17:57,880 --> 00:18:03,840
the uh pasture of

361
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:08,600
haand so this is just sort of a a

362
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:11,760
pictorial of uh um application rates and

363
00:18:08,600 --> 00:18:14,919
and response over time to that top P top

364
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:17,880
portion that has to be managed routinely

365
00:18:14,919 --> 00:18:22,120
on the on the pad so you know there are

366
00:18:17,880 --> 00:18:25,559
disadvantages you have to have uh um um

367
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:30,679
you know repeat applications of a of a

368
00:18:25,559 --> 00:18:33,120
thin layer um and and uh you do have to

369
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:35,840
deal with affluent management uh

370
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:38,960
prolonged freezing is an issue or is it

371
00:18:35,840 --> 00:18:41,960
not an issue to me um if I've got frozen

372
00:18:38,960 --> 00:18:44,159
ground I'll move my cows out onto frozen

373
00:18:41,960 --> 00:18:47,720
ground where they can't destructively

374
00:18:44,159 --> 00:18:49,720
tear it up um so to me it's like get

375
00:18:47,720 --> 00:18:52,640
them off the pad and use it

376
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:55,880
strategically in the wet sloppy weather

377
00:18:52,640 --> 00:18:59,559
um and sourcing wood chips I think that

378
00:18:55,880 --> 00:19:02,280
that's uh a real issue and and I am down

379
00:18:59,559 --> 00:19:04,000
to about a minute

380
00:19:02,280 --> 00:19:08,120
um

381
00:19:04,000 --> 00:19:13,799
so I'm not going to talk about uh wood

382
00:19:08,120 --> 00:19:15,760
chip um Quality or uh but you can come

383
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:20,240
and talk to me about some of our

384
00:19:15,760 --> 00:19:25,280
treatments there's our latest uh um pad

385
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:27,280
at the dairy farm and we are uh in the

386
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:31,440
process of asking for an enter and

387
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:35,799
practice standard uh for our state and

388
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:39,000
we just need to continue uh the work and

389
00:19:35,799 --> 00:19:41,600
uh the forestry equipment piece is huge

390
00:19:39,000 --> 00:19:43,760
getting the right chip for this

391
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:47,520
technology with

392
00:19:43,760 --> 00:19:47,520
that I appreciate your

393
00:19:52,440 --> 00:20:00,320
time one quick

394
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:02,799
question yes so if the sized wood shift

395
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:05,720
after 5 years is still fist sized what

396
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:10,480
determines that it's exceeded its

397
00:20:05,720 --> 00:20:14,039
lifespan the the the permeability or the

398
00:20:10,480 --> 00:20:16,600
functionality of the pad is no is so

399
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,280
clogged with manure at that point that

400
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:21,679
you have to pull it out and and you have

401
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:24,840
to have a flowthrough system it once it

402
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:26,320
clogs up it'll just start ponding so

403
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:29,159
every five years you have to refresh

404
00:20:26,320 --> 00:20:33,679
that entire bedus the

405
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:33,679
pip that's right yeah
