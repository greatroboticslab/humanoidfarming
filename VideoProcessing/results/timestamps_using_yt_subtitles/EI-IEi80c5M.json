  "text": "talk this morning is about nutrient management practices on on small livestock Farms I'm not going to get a lot of detail about how to actually do a nutrient management plan on a small farm I guess that's going to probably vary from from source to source to Source but I want to talk about some practices we've found or I've found that I think are are good guidelines that small farms ought to ought to be following and good recommendations we can make I guess the biggest question is uh what do you think is a small farm I mean it's kind of Soup To Nuts in a way here's uh you know 25 goats here's a couple hundred dairy cows that are grazing there's a few chickens on a farm that happened to be pretty much a managerie for foul um 500 milking use this pretty cool farm been there lots of times uh they produce artisan cheese for a very high-end Market if you want to spend $35 a pound for cheese you should come to that that farm um a 35 St Farm some beef cows 65 or 70 head a breeding Farm of horses so a small farm um kind of across the board a little bit so I'm I'm not going to throw out a question for you here but I'd like you to think just what makes a small farm small um could be acreage um sometimes Farms on small farms are very very limited acreage they're small um you know 20 goats on five Farms I guess that would qualify as a small farm animal numbers sometimes low but again that can vary um 150 Cow Dairy Farm would be considered small in much of the country um and in some parts of the country it would be considered quite large uh small farms may have a special kind of a market they're they're producing for some kind of a niche market um small farm uh um meat being produced for a for a specialty trade of some kind height well I'm just joking there 5 fo2 I guess would be height well this is the USDA answer uh for a small farm a small farmer is defined as one that grows and sells between $1,000 and $250,000 per year in agricultural products again that's a nice big range uh to look at uh$ 250,000 what's that 75 dairy cows you know is that about right I think that's probably in the realm of uh uh what it might be maybe 100 dairy cows a th000 $1,000 I guess below that we'd we we'd be looking more at uh maybe kind of a hobby farm and this is going to vary by States a lot of states are going to have um uh Farmland tax assessments that are going to require a certain amount of income to qualify for that Farmland tax assessment in our state we only required $500 of income to actually qualify for Farmland tax Assessments in some other states it might be quite a bit more than that so again that's the USDA definition um this comes off of usda's we side they kind of divide between more of a let's just call Residential or I don't I don't want to use the term Hobby Farms but retirement Farms lifestyle Farms um there's a major there's an occupation there other than just farming um and then more what we'd call an intermediate uh Family Farms probably still less than that $250,000 gross um they report farming as their major occup uh occupation low sales Farms might have less than $100,000 uh in sales High sales farms between1 and $250,000 in in sales so it's a pretty pretty broad look we're we're looking at um this kind of interesting uh from the the 2007 census of farms if you look at that um $250,000 from less than $10,000 to up to $250,000 60% um of of all those Farms of of all Farms not just the $250,000 Farms 60% of all Farms are less than $10,000 of sales okay six and 10 Farms have less than $10,000 in sales land in farms well that's lower 18% um cattle inventory 9% horse inventory 65% of our horse farms are on those less than $10,000 of of income and often times I wonder where horse income comes from I'm not not sure so much in my state where how they're actually making money unless they're part of other other kind of uh you know Endeavors on the same Farm okay we may not use the we may use another governmental um um recommendation and this would be the EPA um uh approach you know we can um we're all familiar with Kos small Kos medium Kos um a small farm would be um a small C would be less than 300 head of of beef ve or dairy less than 200 dairy cattle less than 750 swine uh that are greater than 55 lbs 3,000 swine less than 55 lb 16,500 turkeys 37,000 chickens 3,000 sheep 150 horses so by the the EPA standard that would be what we're um where we're uh what what would what they would considered to be a small farm I like to maybe talk about what I'll call small farm distinctives for just a little bit generally smaller Farms are going to have less animals fewer animals and because of that they're going to have less waste to handle okay um they might have some other problems related to having that waste but they're going to have less waste to handle they're not going to have the volume that or the amount that other Farms have quite often they don't have a suitable storage structure I know that most small farms that I go on in my state they probably they may have a designated area for manure it all goes here it all goes in the woods um but quite often they don't have any kind of a designated structure unless they've gotten generally in some sort of government program that helps them get a structure um they probably have less land available for grazing um they probably have less land available for spreading in in fact when it comes to most horse farms uh they don't want to spread it anyway they want to get rid of it if they can they just assume haul it offside um and generally operators have less experience in Waste Management closer to neighbors probably they're they're often located in some small uh um small regions or a local that where they may be totally surrounded by an urban area so they might have more neighbor concerns than someone else is going to have they probably have a limited budget budget for manure handling and storage however in some areas you know some Farmers tend to be more affl and would have would have income or dollars for that that they might have the option of disposing the offside now this is something that larger Farms probably don't have such an option for they might but a lot of small farms would if they can they'd like to haul it off site unfortunately sometimes offsite means in a dumpster uh that gets hauled to the landfill sometimes it might mean just stored off in the woods somewhere um composting might be an option in fact a lot of small farm you'll ask you'll ask they compost and they say oh yeah I compost but I think generally there's not a lot of understanding what compost means it might to some people it might mean that I keep it in a pile for a year and after it rots I try to get somebody to come and pick it up so that wouldn't really be composting uh less aware of manure management bmps probably so um I put a um a question mark there because I think often times uh newer or beginning farmers are more open open to uh Waste Management ideas than maybe some more established farmers are they're new they want to learn and and they might be more um you know more interested in and more willing to make some changes well let's go back to this that uh that uh I'm sure we've all seen this diagram many times um or or similar diagrams that we've got uh nutrients coming onto a farm we've got nutrients that are exiting the farm we we've got um nutrients that are causing balances or imbalances in the in the soil now I think it's I think actually getting Farmers to address if they're a small farm with not a lot of acreage getting them to uh accept the idea of actually spreading and managing and nutrient management plans on farms it's probably going to be kind of difficult um but I think we can focus on things like imbalances ways they can uh they can get around that that concern and of course manur storages are one of the ways we can do that now the these are some guidelines we use on small farms in our state in fact we use these guidelines for all farms in New Jersey but most of our Farms are on the smaller side anyway um so and this is the basic of our nutrient management requirements within the state but I think they're a good set of guidelines uh our first point is we we always encourage our producers to store their manure in a dry level impermeable location or as impermeable as possible free from Storm water runoff location should be at least 100 ft from Waters or Wetlands that comes right off of our state regulations so I I think that's a good thing we can we can look at on small farms if they don't have good storages now we can encourage them to um at least consider how they're storing their manure secondly each Farm should have a plan for managing manure spreading and Disposal now disposal if disposal is an option then uh then then I think Farmers small farms should be uh should be encouraged to do that we have a number of uh centralized uh small centralized composting areas in our state which pick up mostly horse horse manur but they they get manure from other sources as well but it's all small farm manur they compost it and then they Market it as mulch managing storm water so so your the water stays out of uh uh out of your manur pad out of your manur storage um might require the use of some buffers or some vegetative filters and I'll show you some slides in a couple moments of that um controlling animal access to streams and waterways again that's right uh right out of our state regulations um and again does sometimes animals have to have access to waterways if they if they or or or streams if that's their only source of water uh consumption so um but that include fencing maybe some uh stream Crossings control farmer oan and finally being aware of those neighbor concerns um we asked a survey of horse Farmers how many of you how many of them dispose of manura off Farm over 40% of them diso uh uh dispose of manura off the farm I mentioned you a centralized composter this is a guy that does that he comes he's in the northern part of the state he comes and he does a variety of things he'll do a he'll do a if you got manur stacked up for 10 years he'll come and he'll he'll haul it off and he'll compost it and he has regular contracts with certain Farmers where he'll leave a dumpster at the farm a roll off and he'll pick it up on a regular basis Min storage now again sometimes smaller Farms don't have a lot of dollars they may not be able to put up a a a storage that has a roof on it or proper proper storage for solid manure so um what this Farmer's done is he's got he's put down a mostly a gravel pad which is a three sides on it it's a relatively impermeable base or we hope that it is it's um 100t from Waters or wetlands and it's um got a vegetative filter on the back side of it so I think that's a good recommendation for a small farm they don't have to put up an elaborate uh concrete pad um they can put up a relatively simple structure like this that allows them to store their manure want them to keep water out of uh uh their animals out of water there's a there's a dry lot just to the right there which was a you know a muddy mess so they shouldn't have been storing their manure um the way they were um right by that stream which is in a sensitive Watershed anyway um this is a a farm that had several hundred horses um he thought he had a good system there you know had Woods on the one side Woods on the other a graveyard on the other side and uh and that's what his storage looked like it was a mess now he's changed that subsequently made some changes but had water way on the side there so I guess if you're talking The Good the Bad and the Ugly this is probably the ugly um this is a a farm we assisted a few years ago they had previously stored all their all their manure um on on one on one field right along a ditch which ended ended up going into a string so we came in we helped them put up this this small composting uh uh pad that you see which uh certainly took away some of their concerns this is actually on our campus uh for our horse farm you know we've I like want to point out that nice Vegeta buffer on the on the downward side of the of the storage so again the storage doesn't needs to be adequate in size to meet your needs we've got a 35 well foot well vegetated buffer uh to uptake nutrients that come out of that storage so I'm not for small farms I'm not a big proponent of of roofs on stor small storages maybe in certain environments rainfall Etc you you you have to consider that but I think there's other things that can be uh considered that are more cost- effective Okay order to store and spread again you have to make um proper investigations of your area um streams Lakes aquifers slopes for spreading neighbors now here's something that that that I will generally tell people that on a small farm if you're spreading man on a small farm I don't think it really does you any good to take a lot of manure samples for your spreading particular if you're spreading every day um you might you might spread over the you might take samples over the course of a year and come up with a baseline but in general I think using book values is probably about as good as you're going to get uh for an accurate uh estimate um on a smaller Farm okay here's a a spreader that's a spreader for you milk Creek spreader being pulled by a uh um by a an ATV vehicle and there are plenty of these mil Creek spreaders available at least in our area farmers who who use these I think we should always be encouraging Farmers kind of regardless of their size to develop a farm map think they ought have an idea what's what and what's where on their Farm they need to know where the water's at um they need to know where the slopes are and based on that they need to they need to be able to make some uh adjustments and some um plans about where they're going to spread and where they're not going to spread now if they don't have a a map such as this which they can probably get for the local Soil Conservation District or nrcs or you know Google Maps for that matter um there's number of sources they can get decent maps from they can draw their own um that's but but they need to some idea where their manur is um going and how they're managing their Farm sacrifice areas now I mentioned I'm a pretty big proponent of storages I'm also a big supporter of sacrifice areas if you can now what's sacrifice are is that where I'm going to kill my sheep no that's not um some people might call it an exercise lot or a rest lot or a dry lot um it's an area where our animals can kind of congregate we can feed them in that spot we can water them in that spot they could have some shelter in that area they it could be a semi-confined area which would probably let them have some some access to pastures and and grazing areas that are outside of that lot um sometimes we would include what we call a heavy use pad around the waterers especially um which is we've excavated some of the dirt around it we put in some kind of a geotextile pad and then maybe a couple of different layers of stone to uh eliminate the mud that would be around the watering area um to use a sacrifice area on your farm and um about half of our producers uh uh said that they did of some kind this is horse producers again and here's a not a real good uh thing to to kind of uh not a good kind of a sacrifice area to have just one great big lot where they graze and they feed and they water the same place here's kind of the idea and I got this out of a of a publication from I think it was University of Kentucky kind of a you know you got your dry dry lot area and then um where your animals are and then you have fences out to your rotational pastures I think we we did a survey recently looking at nutrient management practices on horse farms especially looking at feed management I think the things we one of the things I came out of it with is that sacrifice areas and rotational grazing if you can get Farmers horse producers to do those things that's good I mean those are those are good management practices that uh hopefully they'll follow again of course good uh well-managed pastures are always going to take up more nutrients than uh poorly poorly managed passengers and of course you get that whole recycling thing going um with your horses or with animals in general poorly vegetated passengers are not going to take up as many nutrients um erosion I mentioned so when when that's a possibility stream Crossings are are are possible nrcs can help design these and maybe help fund them too okay again I went through those those kind of six areas storage disposal and spreading storm water management um access to streams and waterways erosion neighbors and finally just kind of putting it all together small farms can have some unique challenges because of um their size both acreage and animal numbers there's not enough land for spreading there's probably a lack of understanding of nutrient management requirements lack of familiarity with bmps it may be located uh in in or near populated areas those those neighbors those urbanized neighbors that might surround us they probably don't many of them don't have a good understanding of what we do and why we do it um they may be able to dispose of waste offsite which is which is positive provid it's not going to landfill um and beginning on New farmers May willingly make changes again I think that that's a possibility um small farmers small farmers don't always fit existing models that might work for a larger farm for manure management so patience is required and if you want to see a nice fact sheet on on nutrient management go to the E extension website and you'll find a fact sheet there by a guy named Randall Randall James I think it is he's done a nice little program for how you manage a manur on a small Farm Ando and opposed to looking at it as just so many pounds produced per given time period he does it by by time okay my cows produce so many so many so much manure for for two months so two months storage goes here two month storage goes here so it's a take a look at it it's helpful any questions",
