00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,400
jumbo kaributana to this organic

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:16,000
strawberry farm this is your farm in

4
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,240
geroge and i hope you're learning

5
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,880
something and welcome to our strawberry

6
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:23,760
farm we are located along waiaku a place

7
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,279
called odero corporation in this episode

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,480
i'm going to teach you how to manage

9
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:32,920
your pests and diseases organically

10
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,920
machacha let's do this

11
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:49,120
[Music]

12
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:49,920
the first pest and disease is what we

13
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,120
call

14
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
leaf spots

15
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,239
now this spot is caused by three ways

16
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,640
number one

17
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:00,640
through overhead irrigation

18
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:01,920
because when water gets in contact with

19
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,159
your leaves you're definitely going to

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:05,760
get leaf spots it can also be caused

21
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:09,040
because of rainfall

22
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,520
i can also because at extreme scenarios

23
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,920
because it's caused because of

24
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,000
red spider mites but you'll find red

25
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,640
spider mites for farmers who are growing

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,960
strawberries inside a greenhouse

27
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,040
this armed in an open field system is

28
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,759
because of the rain

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,320
so

30
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:29,040
how do we prevent and manage this thing

31
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:31,759
so if you're doing irrigation using

32
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:34,400
overhead irrigation i'll tell you this

33
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:36,560
stop doing overhead irrigation and

34
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,320
either adapt either to drip irrigation

35
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,240
or do it manually

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,240
in case you have this because because of

37
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,200
the rain all you have to do is just

38
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,600
prune off the leaves and throw them away

39
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:50,399
in case you're in a greenhouse and

40
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:52,079
you've actually been faced because of

41
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,799
red spider mites and of course the leaf

42
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,159
spots you need to use a biological

43
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:58,240
control

44
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,040
now remember this there's organic

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:02,159
they're synthetic and it's biological

46
00:02:01,040 --> 00:02:05,600
let me just explain briefly what

47
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:08,160
biological is biological is using one

48
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,920
pest feeding on another pest or one

49
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,720
animal feed or another animal

50
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:15,840
think about the ladybird a ladybird will

51
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:18,160
feed on aphids that is biological so

52
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,040
there's a biological control from cooper

53
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:22,800
kenya that is called spidex

54
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,360
so the spidex is what you're going to

55
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:27,120
come and apply on your leaves and it's

56
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,520
actually live organisms that's actually

57
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,519
going to feed on your red spider mites

58
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,120
we have tested this

59
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,280
in different forms

60
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:36,480
of one farm is in cabarack another farm

61
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,560
is in

62
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,480
nanuki and the results we have actually

63
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
seen after two weeks

64
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:45,680
all your spider mites are actually dead

65
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
because the spy decks actually works and

66
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,360
see the good thing about it you could

67
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:50,959
hear what you're saying you can also

68
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:52,959
link you up with these farmers we'll

69
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,280
talk to them hear it from the horse's

70
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,920
mouth itself but with the spiders and

71
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,000
the leaf spots that is a done deal

72
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
the second pest and disease is actually

73
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:06,239
going to affect your throats there's

74
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:08,560
what you call anthrax and botritis so

75
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,400
your fruit will look like this honey

76
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,959
you're probably wondering ew looks very

77
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:15,200
bad yes it looks very bad it's a good

78
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,680
fruit the fruit started off very well

79
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,879
but because of anthracnose this actually

80
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,760
happens

81
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,840
so

82
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,519
for you to avoid anthracnose now

83
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,200
remember anthracnose is more like a

84
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,760
fungal disease

85
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,519
so and because once once the food gets

86
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,720
in touch with water

87
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,200
you're actually going to get such kind

88
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,560
of a challenge so you're probably

89
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,080
wondering somebody who's inside a

90
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,480
greenhouse they'll be smiling all the

91
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,280
way to the bank yes they will bother

92
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:43,120
about the outside farmer it's still okay

93
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,280
what i'd encourage you to do

94
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,360
get your greenhouse paper you see what

95
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,200
i've done the low tunneling system i'm

96
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:53,040
going to come and take my greenhouse

97
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:55,840
paper and cover on top of my beds

98
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,080
this way if it's raining my fruits are

99
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
not going to get in touch with water so

100
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:02,080
antarctica's end botrytis is avoided

101
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,480
okay

102
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,000
and it's something i'd encourage you and

103
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,959
every other farmer

104
00:04:06,000 --> 00:04:09,920
please

105
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,280
in case that happens to you do not be

106
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,239
alarmed

107
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,799
okay

108
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:18,160
because it actually works the third pest

109
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:20,400
and disease is from slugs

110
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,840
yes the difference between slugs and

111
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,120
snails

112
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,840
i know you probably thought it's one of

113
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:27,440
the same thing but it's not so for slugs

114
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,520
what they do they actually come and end

115
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:31,199
up eating the entire fruit or eating a

116
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:33,120
portion of the fruit

117
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
that becomes a waste

118
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:36,880
so what you are doing so far we're doing

119
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:39,680
our research with the secret to actually

120
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:41,360
try to understand what really causes the

121
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,199
slug to come and eat the strawberry

122
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:45,040
fruit what really attracts the

123
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:46,560
strawberry also attacks the slug to this

124
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:48,000
strawberry fruit

125
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:50,320
it is something that really puzzles

126
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,600
quite a number of farmers but yes we

127
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:55,520
have tried our own concoctions that

128
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,080
well it works

129
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:59,360
but you want to get definitive results

130
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:01,759
and that you're going to get from your

131
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,600
cpa so again we'll definitely keep you

132
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,840
updated on that and even if you follow

133
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,840
us on facebook or facebook page but also

134
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
in the description and even the comments

135
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:13,280
will definitely ensure to tell you the

136
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:14,880
results that we found from isupe slugs

137
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,520
is one thing that you actually want to

138
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:19,199
avoid in your strawberry plantation open

139
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:21,680
field farmer i know you're probably

140
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,960
wondering what about the birds yes birds

141
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,680
are a blessing

142
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:25,360
but

143
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,759
they're going to be a blessing to you so

144
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,320
much once they start eating your fruit

145
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,600
so how do you get rid of birds now the

146
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:36,720
first thing do not kill birds again i

147
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:38,240
repeat do not kill the bugs

148
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,160
so what you need to do you need to

149
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,960
prevent them from

150
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
eating your strawberries so how we do it

151
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,960
we're going to use netting

152
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,320
so you can use one

153
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,039
a button it

154
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:52,880
you can use a sheet net if you're going

155
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,880
to use a shade net ensure your shade net

156
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:56,479
is 35 percent

157
00:05:54,880 --> 00:05:58,639
go to the shop and tell them i want

158
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:01,840
cheddar that is 35 percent

159
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:03,440
third one you can also use a fishing net

160
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:04,880
fishnet also you can also use the

161
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:06,240
fishing net but

162
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,400
also you have to look at it in terms of

163
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,319
the cost also okay

164
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:12,880
if not you can also decide to use

165
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,960
galvanized chicken mesh

166
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:18,400
okay it'll actually work and remember

167
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:20,479
the key word is galvanized chicken mesh

168
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,639
why i say is because let's say trains

169
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:25,199
and elements you do not want that rust

170
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:28,240
to actually fall on your beds or even on

171
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:30,800
your plants or even on your fruits okay

172
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
but once you've covered

173
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:33,840
the strawberry plants with a different

174
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,840
kind of netting you've actually

175
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:38,880
prevented birds from coming to eat your

176
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:41,120
fruits buds are notorious but remember

177
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:43,440
they're also hungry at the same time so

178
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,440
for you you need to be very careful and

179
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:47,600
be careful in terms of don't let those

180
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,240
birds just come and eat the hard

181
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:52,400
labor that you've done okay prevent them

182
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:54,479
by using the netting system remember you

183
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:57,039
can either do it overhead or you can try

184
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:58,880
to use it the low tunneling system the

185
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:00,800
choice is yours but personally for us

186
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:03,599
the strawberry farm will always choose

187
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:06,400
to do the low tunnel system because of

188
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:08,800
cash money wise it saves us a lot of

189
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,720
