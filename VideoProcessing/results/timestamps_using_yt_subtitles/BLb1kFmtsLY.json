  "text": "foreign my name is Joe Sanford I am a professor at UW Platteville in the school of AG I'm also associated with the Wisconsin Dairy Innovation Hub um and so today I'm going to talk a little bit about some of the ongoing research we have going into adding biochar into manure management and so before we start getting into it too much um what is biochar for those who may not be as familiar with it biochar is a product of a process called pyrolysis where essentially we're just taking a biomass that can really be any organic biomass wood chips corn Stover straw manure putting it into a reactor with low oxygen content at very high temperatures we're talking 600 and 900 degrees Fahrenheit or higher and out of this process what we end up with is a syngas and a bio oil both of these products can be used for energy production or Heating and then we end up with a biochar as well which is this charcoal looking material down here here's some material that's been made in our lab from a lot of different things and so biochar has a lot of interesting characteristics very similar to activated carbon not the same thing but does have some similar characteristics it has a very high carbon content it has a high surface area alkaline pH and generally has a fairly good exchange capacity with nutrients and other elements and so biochar has been around for quite a while um and it's been primarily used as a soil amendment um and so biochar has been applied to a lot of different types of soils a lot of different production systems um and you know the kind of conclusions from a lot of the research you can find out there is that it's been shown to help improve nutrient retention this is a study that was done by a graduate student in my old Lab at UW-Madison with Becky Larson that found that soils amended with biochar that receive manure application if we amended it with biochar we could see significant reductions in total nitrogen leaching significant reductions in in nitrate leaching as well it's also been found to increase water use efficiency and sandier soils increase aeration and porosity and more clay soils some Studies have found it to reduce soil emissions I put a little asterisk there because the research isn't really conclusive yeah there's a lot of different opinions on this right now um but a big one that's receiving a lot of tension right now is biochar's potential to sequester carbon and so um if you're in in ag I'm sure you've heard about all the carbon credits going around anaerobic digestion things like that carbon sequestration is a is becoming a Hot Topic and um agriculture is kind of seen as as the place for biochar and this quest to sequester carbon is kind of the place for that biochar to go and so one thing my research group has been looking at is yes it'd be nice to apply biochar to sequester carbon improve nutrient intention things like that but how else might we be able to use biochar in a manure management system to get more benefits out of the product and so what my research group at Platteville has been doing has been looking at different areas that we can add biochar into the manure management system one of these areas is compost this is probably one of the most studied areas when it comes to waste management and biochar is composting biochar has been found to have some benefits in composting particularly around nitrogen retention in the form of nitrogen in the compost we've also seen out of Europe quite a bit of research into actually incorporating biochar into animal feed as well right now I'm not actively looking into those there's some literature out there I'd be happy to share with anyone that's interested but my research group right now has been looking at actually using that manure from manure solid so if we have solid liquid separator we're separating out those solids taking those solids drying them down and converting them into biochar as a another potential export from the farm we've also been looking at using it as a cover on the top of manure storages and also incorporating it into anaerobic digestion systems and so for the rest of my my time I'm going to talk a little bit about these these different studies that we have ongoing and some of the preliminary results we've been seeing so making biochar out of manure um this was a project that I started on uh back at you uh in UW at UW-Madison with Becky Larson um looking at phosphorus Management in Wisconsin and biochar and um for those of you who may not are in Most states where we have a lot of livestock production a lot of kfos we have an issue where you know we have a concentration of animals we have a concentration of manure and generally Around The Farmstead that manure is being applied and in particular in Wisconsin we have a lot of issues with the buildup of phosphorus in that soil leading to some Legacy phosphorus issues and so a lot of research has gone into how can we better manage our manure phosphorus particularly in areas where we have high concentrations of animals quite a few Studies have come out of the ew Madison groups kind of looking at different areas of concern and different methods and the conclusion for it is is that really we need to find a way to help densify the phosphorus in manure and try to export it from some watersheds where we have a particularly high amount of livestock production um and so solid liquid separation is one way to get a little bit of phosphorus out a lot of Studies have found that it's still a little too wet for economically transport reporting fairly significant distances and so what we've been looking at is taking that manure solid densifying it through the biocharb or the pyrolysis process and then shipping that out potentially as a as an agronomic fertilizer and so here's some results that we published a couple years ago on this topic here so the figure up here um in my lab I have this little tiny biochar unit this was the material that went into the biochar the same mass and this is what came out and so you can see here there's a really large reduction in the volume of that material it's a large reduction in the mass of that material well it makes it a little bit more feasible than to potentially transport further distances and so what we wanted to look at in the first part of this study was what happens to the nutrients in the material and so the figure on the left here this is the phosphorus concentration this is kind of what we're targeting here to see how we could densify the phosphorus taking the manure drying it and then going to biochar at two different temperatures what we found was that we could really increase or densify that phosphorus into this biochar product when we did a mass balance through the system um we essentially lost no phosphorus so we retained about 100 of the phosphorus there's a little bit of losses probably from user error um but we retained all that phosphorus and so we were able to densify that phosphorus from the manure solids into a very lightweight product that could potentially then be shipped out on the nitrogen side of things we did also see a densification in terms of nitrogen in the product so in terms of pounds of nitrogen per ton of wet weight we did see more nitrogen in that material however if you did a mass balance here what we found is we lost about 40 to 60 percent of the nitrogen when it went through pyrolysis and this is primarily due to volatilization of of nitrogen off of that process and so right now we're kind of looking at um you know yeah we can densify the phosphorus what does that mean though if we use it then as a fertilizer somewhere else so we did a small incubation study this is some results from that looking at phosphorus available phosphorus and some soil incubation studies over time what we found was that compared to the regular manure saws there's a little bit of a lag in the biochar in terms of available phosphorus first but over time it was statistically the same all right over the growing season so right now what we're doing is we're transitioning some larger field studies to keep exploring this is an option and get some more data and seeing how we can incorporate into some of our production systems in Wisconsin the next area I want to talk about adding a biochar to manure systems is uh manure storages and so manure storages are essential to a lot of our operations particularly large operations however there are some concerns particularly around emissions so our manure storages are going to emit quite a bit of methane they're going to emit some nitrous oxide and also some ammonia or we're gonna have some nitrogen losses from that manure storage and so changes in the industry particularly water use has resulted in manure storages looking less like this and more like this not having this natural crust and what we've seen is that particularly ammonia emissions have increased when we have no crust on the surface and so what we want to look at is can we use biochar as a surface cover over these more liquidy storages to help reduce particularly ammonia emissions and maybe some greenhouse gases as well and so we've been working on some pilot studies here about to transition some larger scale studies um and so what we've found is we had our manure storages which were five gallon buckets essentially we filled them with manure we had some controls we applied covers over the top of this so this is some wood chips that were not processed into biochar some wood chips that were and we measured ammonia Emissions on a weekly basis and also greenhouse gas Emissions on a weekly basis to kind of tracked what the emissions were and what we found was pretty Stark in terms of emissions of ammonia from that control wood chips we also did a corn Stover those two covers did reduce ammonia emissions but when we added biochar into the mix we took that material made into biochar where wood chips we almost eliminated ammonia emissions off that storage and for corn Stover we had a fairly large reduction as well and so what was going on here uh what we kind of found is that that cover stability is really important so biochar is fairly hydrophobic for the most part um and what we saw was that the cover staying on the surface of that bio of that manure storage was really essential and so this is the storages initially this is about two or three days after we applied the cover here we see both covers you know on top but after about a month that that biomass started to sink however biochar was still pretty much just as good as it was on day one and so this is what we think was the primary driver here I mean this has been a complaint of producers that do use permeable covers as a as a mechanism for ammonia where they they sink and they have they require frequent reapplication so biochar really does seem to be a potential method to reduce the applications of that permeable cover and help reduce ammonia emissions the next topic I want to talk about um is adding biochar to anaerobic digestion systems this is an area that's I've gotten a lot of questions about recently and so for those of you in the room I'm sure you're familiar with anaerobic digestion of manure we're taking the manure putting in a reactor we're getting biogas we convert that into energy there's a lot of benefits on the digestate side as well however a major problem with anaerobic digestion and particularly Dairy manure is that we feed a lot of sulfur to our animals and that sulfur when it gets in this anaerobic condition turns into hydrogen sulfide through sulfur reduction and so hydrogen sulfide is a is a really costly part of the operational budget for removing it takes around 15 to 20 percent of your animal operation budget is put just towards removing hydrogen sulfide so that we can use that biorgas for some sort of energy purpose and so what we've been doing this is this is um kind of coming off of some work that had been done by Becky Larson at Madison um expanding upon that but I was looking at adding biochar to anaerobic digestion systems quite a few people have looked at this in terms of reducing methane but we wanted to look at and see what its impact was on hydrogen sulfide so in our lab we've been looking at multiple different types of biochars and adding them in batch reactors and then analyzing the hydrogen sulfide methane and the biogas quantity off these reactors when we add biochar into the reactors at relatively low ratios in terms of a mass ratio and what we found has been pretty uh Stark removal of of biochar of hydrogen sulfide and so this is from a study my undergrad finished up about two months ago um at uw-platteville and what we did in this study is we had controls which were just manure with some digestate from a local farm and then we added biochars produced at different temperatures starting around the lower end of what we consider biochar production to the higher end and looked at hydrogen sulfide production over the course of the period and what we found was that by adding biochar particularly low temperature biochars we could significantly reduce hydrogen sulfide production when we did a mass balance of hydrogen sulfur produced compared to the biogas produced as well we found we had around a 70 to 80 percent reduction when we added biochar in the range of 660 degree Fahrenheit to 930. when we get to that higher temperature we're still trying to figure out what exactly is going on here so I'm not going to have answers to that questions if they're out there but high temperature biochars are not great at reducing hydrogen sulfide and we've seen this with a couple other biomasses as well so this is some Aspen wood um really not having much effect very similar to control um so we're not 100 sure what's happening here but the results that we've gotten so far has really shown that low temperature biochars are very effective at mitigating hydrogen sulfide production during anaerobic digestion of livestock manure so that is what I wanted to talk about today in terms of biochar and adding it to manure Management Systems um just a few take-home messages here you know biochar has been shown to have a lot of potential as a soil amendment and kind of what my group has been looking at is how can we increase the uses of it in manure management so that there's maybe some more adoption of it and so we're looking at a lot of different things and a lot of different benefits that biochar could potentially have in these manure Management systems and I think a key takeaway from what I talked about today is that not all biochar is the same the temperature the feedstock that the biochar is produced at is important on your end goal and so recognizing that when you are thinking about adding biochar thinking about encouraging a producer to add biochar to their manure management system is important uh one thing I didn't talk about uh which I'm sure there will be questions on is the cost and so it's kind of the elephant in the room biochar production is going to be a fairly high cost particularly if we're trying to do it on Farm it's going to be a high capital investment to put in a biochar production system on Farm however I think with the carbon credits and the in the way we're seeing anaerobic digestion moving right now I think in the near future there may be some incentives to start thinking about this biochar and lowering the cost a little bit and so with that just want to say thank you here's my contact information if you'd like to uh shoot me an email or follow me on Twitter and the research I presented today has been funded both by the dairy Hub in Wisconsin and uh the USDA nifa program [Music]",
