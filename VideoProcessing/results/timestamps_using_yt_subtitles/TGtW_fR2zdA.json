  "text": "have you ever wondered what makes Amish life so unique today I'll take you inside their world feeding chickens grains all day is like giving a teenager nothing but chips and sood easy but far from my deal I used to feed my chickens grains because the feed store convinced me and the bag had a picture of a Happy Hen I figured why not but my chickens weren't thrilled they ate some but spent most of the day scattering it around like confetti egg production barely average it felt like I was paying a premium for junk food grains are a go to for most chicken owners much like people once believed bloodletting cured everything it's just something people did even though it wasn't the best option but the Amish do things differently forget expensive bags of grain they managed to feed their chickens for just $125 a week honestly I've spent more than that on a single bad coffee maybe you're thinking but my chickens love grains of course they do just like kids love candy chickens are omnivores they're designed to scratch for bugs plants and whatever else they can find grains are just a small part of their natural diet feeding them only grains is like making them sit on a couch watching TV all day fun at first but not healthy longterm switching to the Amish method wasn't just about saving money though that was a nice perk my chickens became healthier more active and started laying better eggs it was like upgrading their diet from fast food to Gourmet Plus plus I wasn't constantly running to buy more grain every 2 weeks did you know that wild chickens eat more bugs and seeds than grains they need variety and when they get it they Thrive grains that's just filler at first I thought the $1 and 25 cents a week claim sounded to good to be true but after a few weeks the results were clear healthier chickens a happier wallet and less mess from scattered grain it was a win-win one you see how well this works it's hard to go back to the old ways when I first heard the Amish could feed their chickens for $125 a week I thought I'd M her I was spending way more on grain and my chickens weren't exactly rewarding me with extra eggs I had to see for myself what the Amish were doing differently that's how I ended up visiting an Amish farm honestly I expected them to pull out some old-fashioned farming Gadget like a hand cranked grain grinder but no they didn't seem to have any special tools the Amish have a knack for making everything look simple and their chicken feeding system was no exception while I was lugging heavy bags of grain and scooping out portions like a cafeteria worker they were tossing out kitchen scraps letting their chickens forage and using fermented feed their chickens were running around pecking at bugs plants and kitchen leftovers I couldn't believe how much easier their system was it was like watching someone effortlessly cook a gmet meal while you struggle with microwave popcorn about that $125 cost I thought it couldn't be real I did the math assuming they had to be leaving something out but no their method was incredibly costeffective meanwhile I was spending a small fortune on grain my chickens barely liked the Amish succeed By ignoring the grain hype that feed companies push instead they use things that would otherwise go to waste vegetable peels stale bread and leftover salad it's like they created a sustainable farm twoot table Chicken buffet minus the fancy Vibe what amazed me most was how natural it all felt there chickens were free to forage finding bugs and plants while the fermented feed extended their food supply I'd never heard of feeding chickens fermented food but these chickens loved it it was like a five-star meal for them the process was so simple it felt almost to good to be true but it made perfect sense the Amish have been doing things their way for Generations no gadgets no flashy marketing and definitely no overpriced grain bags yet their chickens were thriving so what do the Amish feed their chickens if not grains when I asked I half expected some secret ingredient but there was no mystery they rely on Common Sense and scraps most people throw away kitchen leftovers fermented feed and whatever the chickens can find while foraging I thought the secret would be something unusual like magic beans but no there's no mystery here the Amish rely on good old fashion practicality and a combination of things you'd usually throw away without a second thought we're talking about kitchen scraps fermented feed and whatever chickens can scavenge it's not fancy but it works and at just $125 a week I'm not complaining let's start with kitchen scraps if you're like me you probably dislike wasting food you cook dinner end up with some peels or a few stale bread slices and into the trash they go but not the Amish they've turned feeding chickens into a recycling Masterpiece veggie peels leftover salad and rock hard bread become chicken delices for chickens it's as good as fresh baked croissants the Amish have mastered turning food waste into a Powerhouse for egg production then there's fermented feed at first I imagined some odd science project with jars bubbling away and strange smells in reality it's much simpler fermented feed is just ordinary feed like cracked grains so in water until it ferments the fermentation process introduces healthy bacteria that improve the chicken's digestion much like how yogurt benefits us plus the feed swells as it ferments meaning less feed is needed to satisfy the chickens foraging is where things get really interesting chickens are natural scavengers they love scratching around for bugs warms and whatever they can find in the dirt you've probably seen them do this countless times but have you ever thought about what they're actually ually after bugs of course chickens are like tiny feathered dinosaurs with an instinct to hunt when they forage they're getting protein from insects and the best part it costs nothing bugs are completely free you might think really bugs and scraps that's it and yes it sounds almost to simple but that's the beauty of it chickens aren't picky they'll eat just about anything you give them when you combine the right scraps with foraging they Thrive this approach leads to healthier chickens and healthier chickens lay better eggs think about it if you ate the same meal every day you'd get bored too by giving chickens a mix of scraps and the chance to forage the Amish create a more natural and diverse diet for their Birds the result happier healthier chickens and fewer trips to the feed store saving you money in the process the next time you throw away potato peels or a half eaten sandwich remember that you're tossing out free chicken feed Meanwhile your chickens could be foraging for VMS living their best lives and giving you high quality eggs in return transitioning chickens from a grain-based diet to this Amish style approaches like swapping fast food for gourmet home-cooked meals you wouldn't want to live on junk food every day and neither do your chickens the change is obvious almost immediately the first thing you'll notice is the eggs the difference between eggs from grain-fed chickens and those on this nutrient trich diet is like comparing fast food to a homemade Feast the eggs have a richer color color better flavor and more nutrients I'll never forget cracking my first egg after switching my chicken's diet the yolk was so vibrantly oranged that it seemed magical but it was just the result of better nutrition the combination of foraged bugs fermented feed and kitchen scraps creates a nutrient packed diet which leads to Superior egg quality studies confirm it chickens on a varied and nutrient Rich diet produce eggs with higher levels of vitamins feeding your chickens this way is like giving them fresh organic local ingredients instead of cheap mass produced filler it's better for them and better for you vitamins like a ande plus omega-3 South are a GameChanger these nutrients make you feel like you're getting your money's worth at the store but it's not just the eggs that benefit the chickens themselves look and feel like they've just come back from a spar Retreat their feathers become shinier they stop shedding so much and their overall Vibe shifts from just surviving to thriving it's as if they're auditioning for some kind of chicken reality show honestly they even seem happier if chickens could smile mine would be grinning ear to air their health improves too which means fewer illnesses and thankfully fewer trips to the vet let's be real giving medicine to a chicken is like trying to bathe a cat but with feathers and way more noise Since switching to the Amish method sick days have become rare the chickens are tougher healthier and handle challenges like bad weather or stray dogs much better it's as if they've been training for the chicken Olympics and the Amish diet is their secret weapon egg production also gets a noticeable boost my hens used to legs sure but not as consistently as they do now grain heavy diets weighed them down much like car bloating before a race chickens may not run marathons but the Amish diet makes them lighter and more energetic the difference was clear I didn't need a spreadsheet to see the Improvement a full egg carton every week was proof enough I started feeling like I had cracked the Cat my chickens were healthier laying more eggs and I was spending Less on feed Meanwhile my neighbors kept buying pricey grain that didn't deliver half as much it's like discovering that a $5 Burger tastes just as good if not better than the $20 version from a fancy restaurant and here's a bonus less waste Yes you heard that right grain heavy diets produce more chicken poop because surprise chickens aren't designed to eat grains all day with the Amish diet their food is used more efficiently meaning fewer messes for you to clean if you've ever had to rake a chicken yard you'll know what a huge win this is after my chickens adjusted to the new diet I felt like I'd unlocked a secret formula for keeping chickens more eggs healthier birds and fewer vet bills it almost felt to good to be true before this I thought feeding chickens would cost me a fortune you know the feeling walking into a feed store grab grabbing a bag of grain and wondering if you're feeding chickens or a herd of cattle and it wasn't just the cost there was always that nagging question is this really the best way to do it well now I can confidently say there's a better cheaper alternative let's talk about the grain if you're like me you're probably spending a small fortune on chicken feed those bags disappear faster than socks in a dryer the Amish method on the other hand costs about the same as a cup of fancy coffee per week just $125 that's way less than I used to spend on overpriced feed mixes that promised Miracles but didn't deliver the savings are real but the real game Cher is how stressfree this method is back when I relied on grain I was stuck in an endless cycle of buying hauling and storing bags of feed those bags are deceptively heavy lugging them around feels like unintentional strength training plus storing them turn my garage into a critter magnet now instead of over price chicken food I feed my flock with scraps from my kitchen and let them forage in the yard fermenting their feet is so easy it almost feels like cheating it's also a relief not to deal with picky chickens anymore if you've ever shelled out for premium feed only for your chickens to reject it you know how frustrating it is switching to the Amish diet put an end to those judgmental chicken stairs my chickens are happier Scavenging bugs and enjoying fermented feed than they ever were with grains they eat with the kind of enthusiasm you expect on pizza night which is satisfying to watch plus the money I save on feed could easily go toward a Netflix subscription or some snacks to enjoy while watching it I accidentally ended up in a strength training class thanks to lugging heavy feed bags not to mention the chaos in my garage with stacks of feed inviting every Critter in the neighborhood for a feast but now instead of hauling overpriced chicken feed I use kitchen scraps and let my chickens forage in the yard fermented feed is so easy to make it feels feels like I'm cheating oh and let's talk sanity there's nothing worse than chickens turning their beaks up at premium feed you know the feeling spending money on top tier food only for them to act like it's beneath them switching to the Amish method ended those judgmental chicken looks now they happily hunt for bugs and devour fermented feed my chickens eat with the enthusiasm of kids on pizza night which is satisfying to watch and if you're hesitant think of the money saved enough to finally afford that Flix subscription or some snacks plus healthier chickens mean fewer vet visits saving you even more I used to think chickens were low maintenance until I was hit with vet bills that could have been avoided with a better diet Since switching emergency chicken care is practically a thing of the past less stress fewer expenses and healthier chickens it's a win all around if you're tired of wasting money on feed your chickens barely touch this method is a lifesaver it's better for your wallet better for for your chickens and better for your peace of mind you'll laugh at how simple and affordable it is and both you and your chickens will be grateful for the change now you might be wondering if this method is complicated I thought the same it seemed too good to be true like those Furniture instructions that leave you questioning your life choices but to my surprise the Amish way of feeding chickens is ridiculously simple honestly it's easier than making toast especially since I've burned toast more times than I'd like to admit yet I haven't messed up the chicken feed once just take kitchen scraps let them ferment a bit knot full on sourkraut level mixed with water and you're done your chickens are essentially getting a homemade meal at first I thought this method would require extra effort and as someone who barely functions before coffee I wasn't thrilled but the best part once you get into the habit of saving scraps and prepping feed it practically runs itself now even on busy mornings this routine feels effortless instead of dragging around heavy grain bags I give my chickens leftovers from the fridge and they love it it's also a great way to make use of scraps that would have gone to waste if there's one thing I've learned it's that we tend to over complicate things the Amish have mastered the art of Simplicity I expected this change to take time but it's been surprisingly easy no fancy equipment no complex systems just straightforward old-fashioned practicality this is as low maintenance as it gets and coming from someone who hits sze six times every morning that's saying something if you're wondering whether you're capable of doing this trust me you absolutely are it's not about being an expert it's about understanding that sometimes the simplest approaches are the most effective plus you'll save yourself time money and mental energy after all if you can make a sandwich you already have the skills to feed your chickens and if you figured out how to reheat pizza so without burning it you're basically a pro now let's dive into what this grain-free experiment really does for your chickens over time think of it like this when you swap fast food for a Clean home-cooked Diet your body feels better right the same principle applies to chickens after a few weeks on the Amish method your flock will look and feel as rejuvenated as if they just returned from a spar treat one of the first things I noticed was their feathers a well-fed happy chicken has a noticeable glow were at least their plumage looks fantastic it's like replacing a Shabby old sweater with a brand new fluffy one no more ragged or patchy looking birds instead they were sleek and stylish honestly if chickens had a fashion show mine would have been on the runway their new found confidence and vibrant Health were clear then there was the egg production while I wasn't expecting a miracle the Amish diet didn't disappoint not only did the quantity of eggs increase but the quality also improved significantly the yolks were richer the shells were sturdier and my chickens just seemed genuinely happier cracking open one of those deep golden yolks felt like getting a little piece of sunshine all of this came from swapping expensive grain feed for something closer to their natural diet I was genuinely impressed here's an interesting fact chickens on a grain-free diet often lay up to 15% more eggs than those on traditional grain-based diets that huge but when you're collecting eggs every morning it adds up and it's definitely satisfying it made me feel like I was running a boutique Egg Farm another big plus was how much healthier the chickens were overall they needed fewer vet visits had fewer health issues and caused me far less stress when chickens aren't overloading on grains they're less likely to become overweight develop fatty liver disease or turn into those lethargic grumpy hens that just sit around instead mine became active alert and fully engaged in their environment chickens that forage and scratch around naturally are much healthier and believe me much happier too every morning they practically bounced out of the co-op eager to hunt for bugs or Peck at the scraps I gave them it was like they turned into little chicken athletes here's the real game changer fewer health problems mean fewer trips to the vet nobody enjoys dealing with sick chickens not them and definitely not me no chicken wants to be hauled off to to the vet when they could be out enjoying the sunshine and chasing Grasshoppers and let's not even talk about those vet bills thanks to the Amish method the need for vet visits dropped significantly and my wallet was just as happy as my chickens in short the benefits of this Method Keep piling up and they're not just temporary once your chickens start thriving on this diet the rewards are long lasting",
