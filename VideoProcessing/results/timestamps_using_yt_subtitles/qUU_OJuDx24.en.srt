1
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:04,400
first thing we got to go do is check the

2
00:00:02,919 --> 00:00:06,640
Big Joe herd they've been in the Burn

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,719
Unit since the post working I had this

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,880
little inspiration to bring back the

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,719
Wild Turkey population here you don't

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:14,679
want to keep them in a small pin we need

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,199
to do something different so muris and I

8
00:00:14,679 --> 00:00:18,800
just got something we're moving our

9
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:18,800
turkeys in it

10
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,080
today hey guys welcome back to cross

11
00:00:26,439 --> 00:00:30,119
timers bison I want to thank happy

12
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,720
Farmer for sponsor today's video Marissa

13
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:34,440
AR super excited if you guys don't

14
00:00:31,720 --> 00:00:36,840
already know we rais wild turkeys so

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,879
mariss and I just got something that's

16
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,600
going to make a huge difference for our

17
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,239
turkey ranching first thing we got to go

18
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:44,719
check the Big Joe herd like I said

19
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:46,039
they've been in the burn unit for about

20
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,000
a week or two we've checked them on them

21
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:49,239
we checked on them several times but I'm

22
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:52,280
going to take them some hay and I'm

23
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:55,520
going to try to move them to the 9 acres

24
00:00:52,280 --> 00:00:58,440
and then into pasture 4 which is where

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,800
recently we've been cleaning out a pond

26
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:04,320
in there because it was completely dry

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:06,960
well two large rains have surprised us

28
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:09,479
so much and filled the sucker up which

29
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,680
means now we can rotate our bison in

30
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:13,799
there they can start Grazing In that

31
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,600
pasture since it's had rest they'll have

32
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:18,720
water now in their new cleaned out Pond

33
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,320
and also I'm going to give them some

34
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,360
grassy alphaalpha and some native hay

35
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:25,640
roll it out for them have plenty of to

36
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:25,640
munch

37
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:35,640
on so the Big Joe herd hasn't seen the

38
00:01:31,640 --> 00:01:37,119
feed truck in a couple of weeks so I bet

39
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,840
they're excited to see me I see them

40
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:39,840
right here over the

41
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:56,600
hill oh yeah here they come

42
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:20,959
what are you doing over

43
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:20,959
here silly boy

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
so what's interesting here is I just

45
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,519
rolled out two bells of hay so what

46
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,519
we're doing is I'm rolling out some hay

47
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,720
just kind of giving them plenty to eat

48
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:47,319
what I did was I rolled out two bells of

49
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:49,519
hay over there some long strips on some

50
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,599
grass that uh some ground that needs to

51
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,159
be covered it's some very short grazed

52
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:55,879
low grass and so I'm trying to get some

53
00:02:53,159 --> 00:02:57,800
coverage on it but so I rolled out a

54
00:02:55,879 --> 00:03:00,040
native and then I rolled out alphaalpha

55
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,080
and then to kind of draw them back back

56
00:03:00,040 --> 00:03:04,120
in from the Burn Unit obviously it

57
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,319
worked and then I this morning I just

58
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:09,760
rolled out a native hay and then I

59
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,760
rolled out Alfalfa Bill and so I rolled

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,959
all that out they've got plenty to eat

61
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,640
it's all spread out everywhere for them

62
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:18,360
the interesting thing is I rolled out

63
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,080
that native over there and maybe it's

64
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:25,000
just because I'm over here and this

65
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:26,680
goofy guy but I rolled out the this

66
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,360
right here is Grassy

67
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:31,280
Alfalfa right through here and so far

68
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,920
that's what they're liking so that's

69
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,560
interesting it's good to know that

70
00:03:32,920 --> 00:03:36,959
they're liking this grassy alphaalpha

71
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:39,120
it's got a little bit more protein in it

72
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:42,360
actually it has a lot more protein in it

73
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,599
we've got anywhere from 20 to 24% on

74
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:46,760
this grassy alphalpha compared to the

75
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,599
native hay I rolled out there um which

76
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:52,920
that cow she's over there eating it um

77
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:54,360
which is about 6 or 7% protein so that's

78
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:55,840
good stuff and get them through the

79
00:03:54,360 --> 00:03:57,519
winter and they need this protein

80
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,280
especially uh when we're getting our

81
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,280
first days of freezing

82
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,440
so just give you a little background

83
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,560
information what we did is I had this

84
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,160
little inspiration to bring back the

85
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,520
Wild Turkey population here in southern

86
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:24,840
Oklahoma especially here at the

87
00:04:22,520 --> 00:04:26,800
Ponderosa used to be lots of wild

88
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:28,680
turkeys and when I say wild turkeys I'm

89
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,520
talking about the Easterns and mostly

90
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:33,160
the Rio Grands I want to try to

91
00:04:30,520 --> 00:04:36,560
contribute and get the turkey population

92
00:04:33,160 --> 00:04:40,720
going again here so what I did was is in

93
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:43,039
April and May of 2024 I bought some wild

94
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:46,000
turkey eggs online had them shipped to

95
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:47,840
us we incubated them and out of the 30

96
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,600
we only had seven struggled a little bit

97
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,720
I heard that wild turkeys are hard to

98
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,880
incubate and hatch out so we only ended

99
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:57,520
up with seven so our goals kind of

100
00:04:55,880 --> 00:04:59,919
Switched a little bit we've got three

101
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,360
hands and four Toms and what we wanted

102
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:02,919
to do with that as we kind of changed

103
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,720
our mind we said well we're going to

104
00:05:02,919 --> 00:05:07,160
keep them we asked you guys and you

105
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,479
recommended this we kept these adults

106
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:11,759
and we're going to wait till the spring

107
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:14,360
again when these hens hopefully start

108
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:15,560
laying eggs for the first time ever

109
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:16,720
we're going to keep the eggs we're going

110
00:05:15,560 --> 00:05:20,639
to incubate them we're going to do a

111
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:23,280
better job and hopefully get a big group

112
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:25,720
of turkeys and then we'll let a big

113
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:28,880
flock of them go out here on the

114
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,440
Ponderosa yes wild turkeys and bison

115
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,800
back together again that's what we're

116
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:35,199
doing so what we did was is mariss and I

117
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:37,080
we don't want to keep them in a small

118
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:39,160
pin which we've had them there for a

119
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,080
while and I said we need to do something

120
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,600
different I like the mobile units I

121
00:05:41,080 --> 00:05:43,919
wanted to try to do something where we

122
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:47,479
can move them around right they're wild

123
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:50,240
turkeys let's do the best we can to keep

124
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:53,759
them wild essentially living off the

125
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:56,680
land with some help from us right some

126
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,360
feed some clean water those things uh

127
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,520
because this is basically our breeding

128
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,440
stock here and so what we did as we

129
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,080
reached out to the mobile chicken coups

130
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:06,960
from Happy farmer this is what we got it

131
00:06:05,080 --> 00:06:08,960
is going to be so awesome we're going to

132
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,479
show you guys all the things that we can

133
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,400
do with this we're going to move it

134
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:15,800
around the Ponderosa so this mobile

135
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:18,680
chicken unit from Happy farmer came in

136
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:21,039
on a big 18-wheeler semi truck my skid

137
00:06:18,680 --> 00:06:24,240
steer was actually out in the field so I

138
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:26,800
used the Hydro Bed to unload this long

139
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,800
pallet of all the parts and all the

140
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:31,160
equipment to set up this mobile chicken

141
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,599
unit so the next thing was is to put

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:34,639
this thing together so we could get

143
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:37,240
these turkeys in there as quick as

144
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,720
possible Marissa and I did this together

145
00:06:37,240 --> 00:06:42,039
I would highly recommend using at least

146
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:45,440
two people for this project just because

147
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,680
this is a 10x8 mobile unit we got one of

148
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:50,039
the largest mobile units just because

149
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:52,039
we're dealing with a a larger bird

150
00:06:50,039 --> 00:06:54,120
instead of just chickens this is

151
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:56,039
definitely made for chickens there's

152
00:06:54,120 --> 00:06:58,120
several different sizes on the happy fer

153
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,080
website that you can pick from but

154
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,960
Marissa and I put this together t teamed

155
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:06,560
it and it actually wasn't bad at all

156
00:07:03,960 --> 00:07:09,400
took a little bit of time working

157
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:12,240
together obviously start with the sides

158
00:07:09,400 --> 00:07:14,280
got the sidewalls completed got our

159
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,039
angles then we started putting on our

160
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:18,560
Rafters and then the main beam of course

161
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,680
you're going to get the instructions

162
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,319
there's also some videos online that

163
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,000
Marissa and I used to kind of get an

164
00:07:23,319 --> 00:07:26,199
idea of what it was supposed to look

165
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,680
like and how it's supposed to put

166
00:07:26,199 --> 00:07:32,759
together so we did use the videos online

167
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:34,400
as well all the bolts and nuts come in

168
00:07:32,759 --> 00:07:37,199
separate packages and they're marked for

169
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:40,960
you so you know what bolts you're going

170
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:43,720
to be using for different parts of this

171
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,639
pin once we got the door on and the main

172
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,639
hole frame of this chicken pin built we

173
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:50,039
moved it a little bit closer to the barn

174
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,520
where we actually going to move our

175
00:07:50,039 --> 00:07:53,680
turkeys in it so we didn't have to take

176
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,919
the turkeys very far and we're going to

177
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:56,919
put them in an area where we're going to

178
00:07:54,919 --> 00:08:00,240
be able to rotate kind of around the

179
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,599
front yard sort of inside the pond D Roa

180
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:06,360
but of course what makes this mobile is

181
00:08:02,599 --> 00:08:09,479
how these tires come up and down this is

182
00:08:06,360 --> 00:08:12,120
a neat and easy concept that they came

183
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:15,199
up with and this thing is not heavy at

184
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:17,400
all this whole system is so light I can

185
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,960
already tell it's going to be a great

186
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:21,759
way for us to move the turkeys around so

187
00:08:19,960 --> 00:08:24,400
once we did that we got it set

188
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:26,440
stationary and then we put the tarp this

189
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:31,440
is a heavy duty tarp and I think it will

190
00:08:26,440 --> 00:08:31,440
last a long time two three

191
00:08:34,120 --> 00:08:37,599
four it's pretty

192
00:08:38,919 --> 00:08:43,800
simple Brooks and her cousin AJ are out

193
00:08:41,560 --> 00:08:46,399
here with us helping us put on this

194
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:48,800
canvas and then they're going to help us

195
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,519
move these turkeys to their new PIN all

196
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,440
right now's the time we got the turkey

197
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,040
pin completely built we're not going to

198
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:55,760
mess with the water system right now

199
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,079
because uh we're in freezing

200
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,120

201
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,800
awesome and nice water system so we're

202
00:09:00,120 --> 00:09:03,720
not going to mess with it right now but

203
00:09:01,800 --> 00:09:05,160
it'll be very handy and super nice

204
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:07,200
especially in the warmer temperatures

205
00:09:05,160 --> 00:09:09,920
