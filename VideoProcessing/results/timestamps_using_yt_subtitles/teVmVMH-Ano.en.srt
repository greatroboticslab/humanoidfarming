1
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,440
Uh we have coconut, we have coffee, we

2
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,560
have banana, we have pineapple back up

3
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,279
over there. We have a rolinia delissiosa

4
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,279
here. We have casiois there and cassio

5
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,359
granus here which are both luminous tree

6
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,880
species. So they fix nitrogen out of the

7
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:29,039
soil uh into the soil through uh root

8
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:33,240
nodulation. We have another uh luggus

9
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,240
tree. This is an error from the puppet.

10
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:47,049
[Music]

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:16,799
This area here that we're in was um in

12
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,240
the terminal classic period a densely

13
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:24,080
populated city.

14
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:26,479
There were a lot of people here. Um and

15
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:29,759
uh so if we had 80 house mounts on this

16
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:32,720
land, average Maya household size is

17
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:35,520
about eight people. So that's 640

18
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:38,000
people. Uh so we had 640 people on this

19
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
land that left trace that we can see.

20
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,000
They were prosperous middle class people

21
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,240
that could leave something that somebody

22
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,759
like me would be able to recognize.

23
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:49,960
There is no way that they could have

24
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,960
done this with a cornbased economy.

25
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,280
If you step back and look at the larger

26
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,280
picture, it's pretty productive. Like I

27
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,840
said, we have about 500 species that we

28
00:01:55,280 --> 00:02:00,159
use. We have marketable crops. We have

29
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,520
medicinal crops. We have leguminous tree

30
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,360
crops that fix nitrogen. We have timber

31
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:09,200
species. Uh yeah, we have a lot of food

32
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,760
that we eat coming off the farm. Yeah.

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:14,720
Um most farmers if you go into the

34
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:17,120
communities are stuck to that um

35
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,800
traditional farming system of slash and

36
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,520
burn and

37
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:26,000
doing just a two crop um cycle which is

38
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,879
corn and beans because that is what they

39
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:30,800
mostly consume in these communities. So

40
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:33,200
that is that has been one of the main

41
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,800
challenges that we have had in trying to

42
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:37,760
get them to switch from the slash and

43
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,959
burn into a slash and m system and also

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,599
to to switch from just planting corn and

45
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,640
beans to diversifying your farm. Many

46
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,599
people like to do slash and burn and

47
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,200
know at the end of the day slash and

48
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,040
burn is not something which is good for

49
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,599
the environment. Many of the farmers

50
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,920
also cut down trees

51
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,920
uh for firewood. So at the end we are

52
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:01,519
destroying the forest. How can we put

53
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:04,519
that back? Because most of our people

54
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:08,000
may not know the end effect of

55
00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:11,120
it. So we have to go back and teach our

56
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:15,280
people to continue what they used to do.

57
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:18,480
The Mayans are the the oldest folks in

58
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,400
this part of the world and their system

59
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,400
of farming. You could know that apart

60
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,599
from setting fire they used to mix

61
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:29,200
everything and they do it. They knew

62
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:31,599
that mixing things was good for the

63
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:35,680
soul, but they never wrote it anywhere.

64
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,680
But yet they used to put practice

65
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:54,480
it where I'm working.

66
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:57,360
Every time I'm opening my trail cleaning

67
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:00,519
by banana, I am studying where need

68
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:04,159
help. So I just work towards that

69
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:10,840
work. I'm just a tool and I sit with it

70
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:14,000
that day happy, clean, healthy and grow

71
00:04:10,840 --> 00:04:17,840
naturally. Um I don't need have I don't

72
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:19,959
water. I don't water. I don't really do

73
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,720
anything. I just

74
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,720
caretaker. Yeah. That's why most of the

75
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:27,680
time in this war here, this life here, I

76
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,560
have I never say I own this land here. I

77
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:33,199
can only be a caretaker. We are all

78
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:33,199
caretaker

79
00:04:36,199 --> 00:04:40,479
too. And if I was an industrial farmer,

80
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:42,560
particularly a citrus farmer, I would

81
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,520
see leaf cutter ants as a problem. Leaf

82
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,800
cutter ants are actually a symptom of

83
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:48,720
other problems. They're an indicator

84
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:50,800
that your system is out of balance. Your

85
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:53,720
soil is damaged. You only see leaf

86
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:56,560
cutter ants in uh in the wake of a

87
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:58,520
catastrophe. 5,000 acres of citrus. Leaf

88
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,520
cutter ants are going to come in

89
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:03,759
there. Problem is the solution. So this

90
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:05,759
very good example of this. The problem

91
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,120
again back it up. This was citrus in

92
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,280
here when I bought the land. The

93
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:10,720
solution was the leaf cutter ants. Uh

94
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,880
and they're repairing it. They've been

95
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
repairing it for quite some time. The

96
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:15,680
solution to the problem with leaf cutter

97
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:19,120
ants is the solution to another problem

98
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:20,639
which is what do I feed my chickens? The

99
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,479
chickens will take this problem and

100
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,800
convert it to resources. They'll convert

101
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,639
it to meat. They'll convert it to eggs,

102
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,960
to feathers, and to manure. Those are

103
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,720
all products. And the services the

104
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:34,000
chickens are providing is pest control.

105
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:34,000
They're eating that. And then the

106
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:39,440
manureing. Those are the Maya mountain.

107
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:42,240
So this is a this is a Maya mountain.

108
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:45,960
All this is Maya Mountain. So every

109
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:49,120
hilltop is where my ancestor were

110
00:05:45,960 --> 00:05:51,759
living. And farming is another thing I

111
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:54,400
believe that's a very special gift God

112
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:57,039
give us. The main thing for human being

113
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:58,960
is learn to plant your food and get to

114
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,199
know where the food come from and what

115
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:01,199
is

116
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,360
food. Cook your food, plant your food

117
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:08,360
and give thanks and praise.
