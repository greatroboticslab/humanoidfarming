  "text": "Ghana's local rice revolution takes viewers through the thriving landscapes of rice farms across the country, highlighting the dynamic innovations and success stories emerging in the industry. The documentary showcases the important roles played by young farmers and processes while emphasizing the significance of local rice production for Ghana's economy by exploring various stages of the rice value chain and promoting local consumption. This film encourages deeper engagement in the country's agricultural sector. The West African country's fertile land holds the promise of feeding the nation. Today we dive into the stories of resilience, innovation, and national pride shaping the rice industry. We took a trip to one of the popular places known for rice production. We caught up with a young farmer whose experience started on a family land in 2010. I'm in the person of Emanuel from Asetary. Currently we are on the KIS project that's irrigation scheme project but me managing my own started from 2020. So managing my own farm is just 5 years now. Yeah. Initially I wasn't having the intention to become a rice farmer. Uh let me say as at now farming activities is generating a lot of money. So I have decided to keep in that side. Initially I I have the intention to become a bank accountant. Yeah. Because I have a degree in accountant. Yeah. I know mainly to become a rice farmer. Immano shared insights on the impact of technology and investments in enhancing livelihoods and creating employment opportunities in his community. When we started, you know, uh we control is done manually like you go and hire people yourself, you enter into the right farm and be putting the weeds yourself. But as time goes on they they brought some chemical that's selective herbicide that when you see the weeds when you spray all will go. So it's making the work to become easy and pling to first you hire people to come and dig it with normal hole. But now due to technology we have machines that they do all the plowing which make the work to become easier. So now if you just have the startup capital the farming will be very easy for you. Um the packaging let me start from the patty care. Yeah we dry the patty and we blow the chs then we we weigh them we weigh them 90k that's one bag and milling then we move to the milling center where they mail the right or the dehask. Okay. The milling side the packaging is done per um the customer requisition. Yeah. But ideally you package them 5 kg, 10 kg, 25 kg and 50 kg. That's the maximum the 50 kg. Normally it's the the farmers who convey the patty the wet patty to the mailing center to process. Then after that if the farmer said oh okay let me sell it with the husk for any a third party to process it. Fine. We have people who buy with a patty the patty like that and they process it per the way they they like it. Rice production in Ghana has evolved um and mostly as you mentioned previously rice production had um stones and it wasn't well gra I mean the it wasn't well graded and also didn't have that kind of polishing that uh the market demanded. However, um, new age of limited currently through our M foods brand, we beyond production, our farmers farm and gets good yields. Now when the farmers get good nutrition, then the patty rice is well filled and obviously the nutrition becomes better. Now we have um a state of the arts melee facility where we mail hall with stone then we do color separation or more like color sortter where we sort out then on white rice from the lot then we grade we grade on to long grain 75% broken 50% broken so now because we have now graduated we can now be able to base the different segments of the market. Some individuals want long grain. So we sell a premium a long grain rice to them. Some also want the bin maybe for um for other processing into uh p brown or the rest. For them we sell the brooking to them as well. Then we also have the rice brand which animal farmers are also using as part of their their feed composition and feed formulation. So I believe because of we are in a global village. So we are taking technologies not only from Ghana but technologies from across the world as well and the state of the arts machiner that we have indeed um is can be able to give us that right can be able to compete with any other imported rice. They also mentioned branding. So every long green rice is well branded h and it's because we are growing and then we decided to now meet the demand of the farmer and demand of the consumer which is they looking for well branded packages and that's where our market and research have also led us into having heavily having the arguably the best branding or packaging in the country. The labeling is done at different site and you bring the sacks with the labels then you come and do the packaging here. We have people who do the labeling per what you want them to put on the sack. Yeah. So they do the labeling they bring the sack here then they package then kilo 5 kg and the rest and they sew them they they seal them there indirect way of employment to the other committee members. Uh we have printers those who do the printing and we have the factory who uh um do the sack a transparent one While the coid9 pandemic posed challenges, it also sparked innovation in the food industry, attracting investors who saw potential for long-term growth. I'm Alex, a factory manager for Max Industries Limited. The mats industries is in currently a steady year of fishes and it's into providing dry and milling services for uh farmers right I think uh considering cover you realize that during that time food the food and beverage industries became very very important when everybody was I think in lockdown they were allowed to operate and all that he realized that it dawned on the CEO that no you will have to put this in place to also help the country in terms of uh this disaster. So it was doing that he gain inspiration to come out with the opmax industries right I think uh local rice has come a long way uh born with the days that we used to have stones and all these things in local rice and now we have proof seed method of growing and I mean process it we are using state of biat dry and the milling composite meal so currently we have a 30 metric tier which uses as as a floor is to grind the rice. Then we have a capacity of about 100 tons melon rice that uh processes the rice the dried rice. So we have from the melon side we have the pre- cleaner which cleans the patty rice as the name implies it leans the patty rice frees it from this uh debris chaff and all that. Then he passes it on to the the stoner which takes stones, clay pebbles, other solid materials from the rice. Know when you're harvesting rice, you can pick up clay pebbles because you go, stones and other foreign materials, solid foreign materials. The diston takes the house. So from there we have the ma that is what the husk the rice. It takes the hus of the rice from the kennel and from there spalled onto the separator. He separate the hacks rice from the ketta from the passes it on to the polisher. We have the three polishes. We have the primary polisher, the secondary and then the chair polisher. Now the primary polisher will first take the first coat of the brand of it. Secondary one will continue polishing to make it a bit whiter and then it is passed onto the grader. From the grading machine it sorts the rice into different grades. That's the long gray, the pera grid halfb broken and then the very fine broke. So now the grater sends the long gray to the water polisher. The dust polisher using mist the dust polisher using mist like with me have liquid polish polish. That's that's the purpose of the wonder polisher. And from there it sends it to the laser color. It takes multiol base from the uh the polished grains because you are not interested in those multiolent gears and then from there it is part onto the and bag unit. So based on the best you are being for that period they set it to the whiskey which is electronic and from there it is back and please don't h one significant hurdle needs to be addressed for the industry to achieve sustained growth and uh one of the challenges local rice producers face is they don't really have good distribution channels. They are not all over. So when it happens like that, yes, uh there's a little downtime with respect to processing or receiving raw materials from clients. Nevertheless, we sometimes do receive them. However, we are not able to process for them. The reason being that they are not having any demand for your side. You know, this packaging, you have to wait for you to get customers before you package. If you package it and you put it down maybe and you don't get customers to buy it and it's there for a longer time and this uh maze w can enter which will decrease the quality. So you have to wait for you to get customers before you you you package. Every business has its own ch every business has it own challenges and angel business um is not alien to that. Um as a company we've also have our own fair share of uh issues. Key among the challenges we have faced as a company is um the rates of uh interest on credit or capital or bank loans. Um we actually in a market we in global village we are competing uh with a market where the agricultural sector are getting loans as single niggets. Unfortunately in in Ghana loans are in excess of 20s and 30%. Where in very difficult for um agricultural business to be able to pick such facilities and be able to produce to compete with those who are coming with a single digit interest rate financing. The second issue is also uh with insurance when the way we have car insurance, home insurance, agricultural insurance is still in it. There are some interventions with Ghana agricultural insurance pool which is no more in existence. We know some few private entities are also doing some insurance for agricultural businesses. uh there's a need for us to have I call aggreate aggreate insurance as a big concern where we provide insurance to cover a lot of the I mean the activities along the value chain especially for an agri business sector where we are fully relying on rainfed or rain for agriculture it is because we don't have enough irrigation supports neither we have there enough resources to be able to go in for proper irrig irrigation facilities to help with our production. So we rely on God to leave us and that is also one of the risk factors. So when we have credits which is sorted out at very low rates and we have insurance that will provide that level of or layer of support for farmers or for businesses then we believe that we are on road of drisking agriculture uh in a long short long term by sharing knowledge and expertise industry players are empowering young people to become innovative entrepreneurs. Yes. So the opportunities for young uh individuals um the 72 that I mentioned it's interesting to know that we are we are all young people. I think the the the highest band of age will be just the the first the early part of 40 and we have a majority of the youth being under 40. So yes there there are opportunities for young individuals who have the who have the the capacity to be able to join our growing and our growing force. Uh additionally individuals who might also want to farm there's opportunity for them as well. Uh outgoers we we have our production hub or production arm called Tigaba. Tik T and out grower social enterprise for out grower companies out grower farmers who might want to farm h they can be able to reach out to taban and tab can be able to help them out there other individuals who are also not green fingered I mean they don't want to do the agree but they want to do agre we have a we have a product as well for them and they can come on board we can always see our best they can be able to benefit from agricultural space we also have the new age economy which is our newest kid of the block where we are going to provide trainings uh for individuals uh some for free and those who might want in-depth analysis or in-depth appreciation can also come on board our master class where we can be able to help them set up uh the test we are young individuals we've been able to achieve it and we know we can be able to um get to a lot of young individuals who have interest in agriculture to also come on board one of the major giants in the uh Rice value chain which is aok thing they started I happened to see their humble beginning they started and now they are very they being a client of ours and we went through taking thing with them and then as now I can say that they are producing one of the best quality of prepar rice you can you can have in in Ghana. We try our best to make our doors open for students. Abuk is behind the brand of Nar. They mostly deal with some of these young of students. They sometimes bring them here have a look at whatever is going on here. When they come out those are always we take them through the processes. We take them through and they see the final product. They appreciate it. Yeah. So as a company uh we commenced 5 years ago with uh barely 10 staff. uh currently we have 72 individuals who we have employed there and 50% of them being female. Now this 72 are on new ages or in the group's payroll. Then in terms of uh support we have tagged or directly supported six over 16,000 farmers who by extension have also reached out to over 60,000 individuals who have also been engaged along these value chains that we've been undertaking. When it comes to tonnage of of rice, we have contributed every year on year we produce this year we intend to produce 10,000 metric ton of of rice on the market. Uh last year with this just barely 4,000 metro ton of rice. This year 10,000 of rice on the market and going forward we are planning on doing exceeding it in our next production years. When it comes to rice, it is a very important crop in Ghana at the moment. It it didn't used to be. Uh but consistently as we urbanize, our eating patterns change. We always want something convenient to eat. So rice has become a convenient food for the Ghanaian population. And we are over 50% urbanized. So if you look at the grains when it comes to our food, maize is number one. We actually need to produce about 6 million metric tons of maze every year if we can meet our needs. In fact, over 6 million metric tons because beyond what we eat for bank, cocoa, et and kink and all those things. You also need maze to process all those processed foods by the big manufacturers like uni liver and all those companies. And then you need maze as a main component in animal feed, especially poultry feed. The poultry feed usually would have about 60 to 70% maze making the bulk of the food. So maze is very important. Then comes rice. Rice has gradually grown to be number two when it comes to the grains and cereals that we eat a lot in the in the country. And we import over 50% of the rice we we we need. And rice is also labor intensive, capital intensive and land intensive. For example, if you have a hectar of land, your average yield is 5 tons for rice. Your average yield is 5 tons for rice for a hectar of rice. Uh if I should give you an example, if you have the same hectare of rice, you can get over 20 tons of tomatoes or pepper. and tomatoes and pepper are higher value crops than rice. So if you look at rice is become very important. The return on investment is not that great and it requires a lot of resources. Land, irrigation, water and inputs. Your average acre of rice would take about four bags of fertilizer. So it's a lot of work. Now what we can do to get the best out of rice is to apply industrial ecology principles in the rise value chain. In fact not just the rise value chain you can apply industrial ecology principles in every other value chain where one you try to be as efficient as possible in the production your water use your material use input land use. Two, you apply the principle of consistency where the inputs that go into that system generates products and byproducts which become inputs within the same system or another system for growth. Now on the rice husk we can also um add rice husk and other organic materials to generate energy bio gas. So if you have rice husk plus poulry manure um cow dang even plantain stems and all those things any form of organic material you can um mix them up um for for for for biogas generation. So there's a lot of opportunity there. I know a company a startup in Tamil that uses rice rice has to make BS like this you see on this table and like what we've used for the partitioning behind me for furniture and if you are producing so much for example if you have 3 million tons of patty rice and about a million of that is going to end up as rice husk that's a million tons of rice husk that we can use to make MDN walls for furniture for construction for ceilings for all sorts of things that will cut down uh import bill on importing some of these things. So rice presents a very great opportunity going forward. The state needs to invest in or support farmers to get a lot of irrigation because rice drinks a lot of water and um and also support with mechanization um land preparation and harvesting. If you have mechanized harvesting you actually get better returns. Sometimes harvesting manually you lose a lot of the patty but if you have mechanized harvesting you reduce your post harvest losses. And another important element are dryers. If we have dryers in the key rice production areas rice farmers can actually dry their patty. Once they finish drying their patty they can store and even wait for a better market to sell. The value chain from farm to market holds the backbone of Ghana's rice production. technological advancements are boosting efficiency and profitability and offer other business opportunities. So how do we approach that? Once you farm rice and the rice stock grows, what you take out of of that is the grain which is the patty rice. Now the stock, what opportunities are there to use the rice stock? There are thousand1 opportunities for rice stock. Aside them being composted and to return nutrients back into the soil, you can use them for all sorts of things in the fashion industry. For mats, for a lot of different things in the fashion industry, you can use them in upholstery. You can process them and pack them in upholstery. You can use them in different different forms. So we need to start thinking about how we can harvest those things. In Ghana, usually once the harvester comes to harvest to cut uh and and get the patty uh will usually set fire to the to the stalks on the farm. That's one of the easiest ways to clear them and repair land for the next season. That also introduces a lot of greenhouse gases into the atmosphere. So one of the things we can do is to strategically also get machines that can help us. We don't even need machines. We have a lot of people who need work. Once we are adding value to the right stock and creating a product that returns capital value, we can engage a lot of people to do that work. That's one. And then when it comes to the rice patty itself, for every ton of rice patty, you'll get about 60, let's say average 60% of actually milled rice. Then you get your rice brand and you get your rice husk. That rice husk is a problem for a lot of rice mills. So you go to a lot of the rice mills the rice husk is packed and they either set fire to it and the few of them who have dryers will use will burn the rice husk to dry the rice patty there's an opportunity to converse rice husk into MDF boards for furniture like this even the rice straw you can use them for furniture like this you mill them into fine powder you add a binding agent you compress and become bolts like this that you can use for construction for partitioning in like um drywalls and all those things. So there's an opportunity to use that. Also the broken rice and the discolored rice, there's an opportunity to use them for animal feed, for rice wine, and for other nutritional products. Ghana's local rice market is growing, yet misconceptions linger. What will it take for local rice to become the preferred choice on every table? So if we have to meet our rice needs and be self-sufficient on rice, that is if we don't pivot another um commodity to take away the dependence on rice, we need to grow about 2 3 4 million metric tons of patty rice which we will then mill and get uh maybe 2 2.5 million metric tons of actual rice. then we meet our our rice needs to a certain extent. So rice is very important and I think largely we also need to accept the fact that 1 kilogram of broken rice is also the same as 1 kilogram of um long grain rice. So that if we educated the population to agree that 1 kilogram of broken rice when you eat is the same nutritional value and is the same stomach it will go to 1 kilogram of long grain rice is the same nutritional value then we in in selling our rice we can actually mix the broken rice with the long grain rice so that we can reduce the price per kilogram of um rice so that people can afford rice. What the industry does is that once we mail rice, we take the grade A, which is the full long grain rice. That's where a lot of rice um investors get their returns from. So they price that higher and that's what people want. Everybody wants to buy long grain rice. So you pay more for that long grade. The grade B sometimes is mixed with the grade A and then the grade C it goes to school feeding program or for animal feeding. But once we able to mix this in a good um percentage, we can then not concentrate the final retail cost of the rice on the grid A. We can spread it among these three so people will still get the volumes at a better uh uh price which will help the industry. So I think it's something we need to do with the industry. Ghana's agricultural potential is vast. With your support, we can make local rice a symbol of national pride.",
