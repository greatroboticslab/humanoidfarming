00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,879
hey everyone welcome back to the channel

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:08,320
today we're diving into the world of

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,599
onion growing and I'll be showing you

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:15,000
how to plant onion sets specifically

5
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:17,880
Shakespeare and centu yellow varieties

6
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:21,039
plus we'll be experimenting with two

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,039
different gardening methods a no dig bed

8
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:27,199
versus hul culture we're going to see

9
00:00:24,039 --> 00:00:30,000
which one grows better onions so let's

10
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,559
get started so today is the 5th of OCT

11
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:36,399
October and it's the perfect time to

12
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:39,360
plant these onion sets I'm planting two

13
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:42,399
different varieties Shakespeare and

14
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,320
centu yellow these are Hardy

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,559
overwintering onions which means they'll

16
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,559
grow through the colder months and be

17
00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:54,039
ready to harvest in early summer next

18
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:58,039
year when planting onion sets I'm making

19
00:00:54,039 --> 00:01:00,440
sure each one is placed about 5 cm deep

20
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:04,360
you'll want to space them about 10 CM

21
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:07,000
apart and leave about 20 cm between the

22
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:10,119
rows this gives the onions plenty of

23
00:01:07,000 --> 00:01:13,240
space to grow without competing for

24
00:01:10,119 --> 00:01:16,640
nutrients first up I'm planting in this

25
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:20,119
no dig bed as the name suggests there's

26
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:22,960
no digging involved the idea here is to

27
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,720
build up the soil Naturally by layering

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:29,000
compost Mulch and other organic

29
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:31,600
materials directly on top of the ground

30
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:33,640
this protects the so soil structure and

31
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:37,320
encourages earthworms and other

32
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:39,920
beneficial organisms to do their thing

33
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:42,600
over time this method improves soil

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,119
Health without disturbing it it's a

35
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:49,439
simple low effort way to Garden we'll

36
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:52,600
see how it compares to our next method

37
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:55,000
next we have the hul Coter bed hul Coter

38
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,079
is a German term that means Mound

39
00:01:55,000 --> 00:02:01,079
culture and it's a raised bed technique

40
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:05,360
that uses decaying wood branches and

41
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:08,160
organic matter as the base the idea is

42
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:11,640
that as the wood breaks down it releases

43
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:13,720
nutrients and retains moisture this

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,360
method can be really great for water

45
00:02:13,720 --> 00:02:18,959
conservation especially in drier

46
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:21,480
climates this bed should break down

47
00:02:18,959 --> 00:02:24,760
slowly over time providing a

48
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,599
nutrient-rich environment for our onions

49
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:28,800
it'll be interesting to see if this

50
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:32,040
method gives us better results compared

51
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,599
to the no dig bed that the onion sets

52
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:37,000
are planted in both the no dig and hul

53
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,680
culture beds it's time to let nature

54
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:41,959
take its course normally I'd water them

55
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,440
in after planting but today the ground

56
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:48,000
is already pretty wet so I'll just rake

57
00:02:44,440 --> 00:02:50,040
over the soil and leave it as is now

58
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,879
it's just a waiting game to see which

59
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:55,360
method performs better will the no dig

60
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,640
bed come out on top or will hugle

61
00:02:55,360 --> 00:03:01,519
culture prove to be the winner only time

62
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:04,440
will tell thanks for joining me on this

63
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:07,040
onion planting Adventure I'll be sure to

have any tips for growing onions see you
