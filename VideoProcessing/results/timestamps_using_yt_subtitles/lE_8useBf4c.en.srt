years they even almost went broke a few

38
00:02:14,280 --> 00:02:18,920
times but they have always dreamed of

expanding their operation and buying the

00:02:18,920 --> 00:02:24,200
adjacent Farm to make this dream come

00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,519

[Music]

49
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:51,400
work what Jim and Louisa will hear today

50
00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:52,959
from Russell is what many producers

51
00:02:51,400 --> 00:02:55,720
across the United States are hearing

52
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:57,680
from buyers of fresh produce how

53
00:02:55,720 --> 00:02:59,519
seriously they heed the advice Russell

54
00:02:57,680 --> 00:03:00,959
gives them could make a big difference

55
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,239
in their hopes for the

56
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:05,239
future as the fresh produce market

57
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:08,200
becomes more competitive and buyers more

58
00:03:05,239 --> 00:03:09,920
demanding producers across the US are

59
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:13,200
looking for ways to make their good

60
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,200
farming operations even better it is

61
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:17,159
beautiful lettuce but I like to add you

62
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,879
my list of prar but we only use

63
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:22,360
certified Gap process

64
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,680
Gap what's that I've never heard of that

65
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:26,640
before I'm not the expert but you can

66
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,959
ask Dean Okimoto he's one of our best

67
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,879
produce suppliers okay yeah actually I

68
00:03:28,959 --> 00:03:32,319
know Dean's in the call up with me and

69
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,120
so yeah maybe we could give him a call

70
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,640
and go out to his farm and and find out

71
00:03:34,120 --> 00:03:38,120
how he does it to meet your standards

72
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,519
Russell I want to thank you very much

73
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:40,640
for your time today I think we can meet

74
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,040
your standards and we'll be in touch

75
00:03:40,640 --> 00:03:44,519
with Dean and then we'll be in touch

76
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:48,200
with you hopefully give me a fall great

77
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:48,200
excellent thank you thank

78
00:03:49,640 --> 00:03:55,239
much thank

79
00:03:51,959 --> 00:03:57,560
you well we got it today Louisa and

80
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,879
Jim's potential buyer said he would buy

81
00:03:57,560 --> 00:04:02,959
from them only if they had a gap program

82
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:07,360
but the problem is they don't even know

83
00:04:02,959 --> 00:04:10,680
what gaps or good agricultural practices

84
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,799
are when Jim visits Dean he's at first a

85
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,840
bit shy asking for advice from a

86
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,199
competitor but Dean puts him at ease Jim

87
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:22,000
it's the responsibility of all of us in

88
00:04:18,199 --> 00:04:25,840
in in the industry to to be aware of of

89
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:28,360
good agricultural practices and to make

90
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,360
our industry which is a safe industry to

91
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:32,520
begin with even safer right so it's

92
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:34,280
important for all of us to understand

93
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:36,639
these things and to learn it and it

94
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,800
protects all of us that way Dean

95
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,479
explains that gaps involve a detailed

96
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,360
process designed to prevent or reduce

97
00:04:41,479 --> 00:04:45,759
microbial contaminants from entering the

98
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,240
fresh produce production system

99
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:51,039
following gaps is not always easy but

100
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,160
for demanding buyers like Russell it's a

101
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:54,639
requirement so I see this is is

102
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:56,720
everybody's responsibility like you were

103
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,000
saying I mean I I could be responsible

104
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,800
for some of these problems I need to

105
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,039
figure out ways to mitigate them so how

106
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:03,919
do I learn about the actual ways of to

107
00:05:02,039 --> 00:05:05,479
cleaning up my farm well Jim you know I

108
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:07,280
know it's a lot to handle and with our

109
00:05:05,479 --> 00:05:10,000
busy work schedule and everything what I

110
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:12,080
did as I hired a consultant although

111
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:14,360
Louisa and Jim decided to use a

112
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:16,680
professional consultant your local

113
00:05:14,360 --> 00:05:19,470
extension office and many universities

114
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:24,680
are staffed with qualified

115
00:05:19,470 --> 00:05:27,120
[Music]

116
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:30,000
advisers hey Jim what are you up to hey

117
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,759
Louisa um I'm going over this poster

118
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,080
that Dean gave us and wow there is just

119
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:34,360
a lot to do and I can see that we're

120
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:36,440
going to be spending a lot of money

121
00:05:34,360 --> 00:05:38,400
Transforming Our Farm yeah but you know

122
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:40,840
what I think we know a lot of things

123
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,160
that are on this poster already right

124
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:43,720
but I mean where do we start there's

125
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,039
just there's just so much and you know

126
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,039
what I'm worried are we ever going to

127
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,560
get a payoff well a payoff as you call

128
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:51,520
it well I think it's just going to come

129
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,759
in different forms you know expanded

130
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:56,520
markets and you know confidence in our

131
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:58,319
product and you know what get this maybe

132
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,840
in the future hopefully in a couple of

133
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,160
years a profit you know what when we

134
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,919
start selling to high-end buyers we

135
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,400
could probably see some money coming in

136
00:06:04,919 --> 00:06:07,800
okay but you know what I don't think we

137
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,319
should start spending that money just

138
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:11,000
yet uh I just don't I don't know where

139
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:12,880
to start there's just a lot to do it's

140
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,800
not difficult it's just I'm a little

141
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,440
confused where to start well I think

142
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,720
you'd agree with me it's about our

143
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:22,440
reputation we want to be growing and

144
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:25,319
selling the best Clean safe healthy uh

145
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:27,680
produce maret absolutely yeah well I

146
00:06:25,319 --> 00:06:29,199
know your fears and I think since you're

147
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,360
here and I'm here why don't we take a

148
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:32,960
look at this poster and let's pick out

149
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:34,479
several things that we can start doing

150
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:36,720
together you know take small steps

151
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:38,599
towards um getting it all together good

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
idea well you know I'm looking at this

153
00:06:38,599 --> 00:06:42,520
insecticide area here they show kind of

154
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,199
a bad example that that kind of looks

155
00:06:42,520 --> 00:06:46,479
like our farm I see where we got to go

156
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:47,880
and so you know what I'm going to pick

157
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:50,120
this one for now and start on this what

158
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,360
about you okay well you know how I've

159
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,440
been feeling about having to go behind a

160
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,919
tree and our workers having to go you

161
00:06:54,440 --> 00:06:58,160
know out in the field what Jim and

162
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,879
Louisa have found is a simple road map

163
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:01,879
to move their Farm toward APAP

164
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:02,879
compliance in order to meet the demands

165
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:04,879
of a new

166
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:08,639
buyer they decide to make some

167
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:08,639
critically important improvements

168
00:07:09,060 --> 00:07:15,840
[Music]

169
00:07:13,479 --> 00:07:18,280
immediately Louisa says she will start

170
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:20,319
with worker hygiene and Jim is going to

171
00:07:18,280 --> 00:07:23,160
tackle their use and storage of crop

172
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,000
protection agents it won't be easy but

173
00:07:23,160 --> 00:07:27,240
the payoff will make it worth all the

174
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:28,919
hard work believe this how many Louisa

175
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:31,479
has always been concerned about some of

176
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:33,000
the workers common hygiene habits

177
00:07:31,479 --> 00:07:35,120
although the workers are welcome to use

178
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,160
the toilets at the Farm office in

179
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:40,160
reality many just take advantage of a

180
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,639
nearby Bush Louisa knows this means they

181
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,720
are not washing their hands properly she

182
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,280
intends this to stop

183
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,720
immediately Louisa gets worker hygiene

184
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,560
regulations off the web to comply with

185
00:07:49,720 --> 00:07:55,639
state and federal requirements now she's

186
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:57,960
ready to go shopping for toilet

187
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,960
facilities Louisa is surprised at how

188
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,639
many units really do not meet her needs

189
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,840
they all have toilet paper holders

190
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:07,120
inside but she's looking for units that

191
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:08,560
will hold lots of toilet paper running

192
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:10,960
out would be bad

193
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,759
news next Louisa looks at the

194
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:17,080
handwashing facilities first she wants

195
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:19,120
it to be outside not inside among other

196
00:08:17,080 --> 00:08:21,479
things this will help ensure that all

197
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:24,400
workers actually wash their

198
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:26,919
hands in addition loua is looking for a

199
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,840
large soap dispenser she needs a paper

200
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:31,639
towel holder that dispenses single use

201
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:34,320
paper towel trash here she also wants

202
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,959
attached trash cans for the used paper

203
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:38,640
towels Louisa checks to be sure that the

204
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:40,959
tank can keep the water clean and

205
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:44,320
sanitary and that it is easy to clean

206
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:46,320
and sanitize on a regular basis it she

207
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,480
also wants to be sure the used water

208
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,680
never runs onto the ground but instead

209
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:51,920
is caught so it can be disposed of far

210
00:08:50,680 --> 00:08:54,880
from her food

211
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,000
crops once she finds the ideal unit she

212
00:08:54,880 --> 00:09:00,079
signs a contract that covers delivery

213
00:08:57,000 --> 00:09:01,399
cleaning supplies and maintenance

214
00:09:00,079 --> 00:09:03,360
this relieves her of a lot of

215
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:05,480
Maintenance headaches and provides

216
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:07,160
written documentation that she rented

217
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:09,640
enough toilets for the number of workers

218
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,000
she has and that everything including

219
00:09:09,640 --> 00:09:14,560
cleaning and restocking is up to

220
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:16,600
standards Louisa has ordered the unit on

221
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,240
Wheels so she can always have it close

222
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:21,160
to her workers and post signs to remind

223
00:09:19,240 --> 00:09:22,399
workers to wash their hands after using

224
00:09:21,160 --> 00:09:25,120
the

225
00:09:22,399 --> 00:09:27,160
toilet Louisa knows these new toilet and

226
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:29,440
handwashing Facilities will make her

227
00:09:27,160 --> 00:09:31,560
workers much happier and will also make

228
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:34,160
improvements towards the safety of her

229
00:09:31,560 --> 00:09:36,910
produce she realizes this first step

230
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:41,600
wasn't really all that

231
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:44,079
[Music]

232
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:46,160
hard Jim wanted to start on the crop

233
00:09:44,079 --> 00:09:47,640
protection agent guidelines because he

234
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:49,640
was trained by the University's

235
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:50,800
extension program and received his

236
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:52,800
applicator

237
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:54,680
license he's proud of the crop

238
00:09:52,800 --> 00:09:56,399
protection agent file he maintains

239
00:09:54,680 --> 00:10:00,240
complete with copies of labels and

240
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,720
material safety data sheets or the msdss

241
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,279
he always records the agent mix ratios

242
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:06,560
and Equipment inspections he's proud of

243
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,240
his written

244
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:11,360
records Jim has been careful to document

245
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,240
that Harvesters observe the legal time

246
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:16,640
between his last spray and worker

247
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:18,760
re-entry to protect his workers Jim also

248
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:20,800
follows the approved Harvest interval to

249
00:10:18,760 --> 00:10:23,760
help ensure that no illegal residues

250
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:26,279
remain on his crop but in reviewing his

251
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,760
class notes Jim realizes he needs to

252
00:10:26,279 --> 00:10:29,320
double check that his workers are

253
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:31,320
calibrating the spray equipment fre

254
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:34,480
frequently and recording all their

255
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:37,040
maintenance H I'm not quite sure about

256
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:39,720
this maybe a checklist will

257
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,040
help Jim reminds the workers to check

258
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:44,040
the calibration before each spray and

259
00:10:42,040 --> 00:10:47,000
makes Dennis responsible for record

260
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:48,560
keeping and periodic inspections because

261
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:49,839
you know Dennis this is really important

262
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:52,000
to do this you're doing a couple things

263
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:54,720
for us you're saving us money you're

264
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,440
controlling our p and we're keeping out

265
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:58,160
of the trouble of having illegal

266
00:10:56,440 --> 00:10:59,360
residues so it's really important that

267
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:01,480
you're doing this and you're doing a

268
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,720
good job so thanks for this calibration

269
00:11:01,480 --> 00:11:05,160
will save Jim money crop protection

270
00:11:03,720 --> 00:11:07,720
agents are

271
00:11:05,160 --> 00:11:09,959
expensive well Jim has put off his last

272
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,639
stop as long as he can he's going to

273
00:11:09,959 --> 00:11:14,800
inspect his crop protection agent

274
00:11:11,639 --> 00:11:16,839
storage area Jim always knew his storage

275
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,880
unit was cluttered but looking at it

276
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:20,800
objectively he can see it could be a

277
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:21,920
source of future contamination if he

278
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:24,519
doesn't act

279
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,200
now he knows pesticide containers

280
00:11:24,519 --> 00:11:28,959
shouldn't be sitting on top of product

281
00:11:26,200 --> 00:11:30,360
shipping containers he also knows all

282
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,320
crop protection agent should be

283
00:11:30,360 --> 00:11:35,360
organized separated and locked up he's

284
00:11:33,320 --> 00:11:38,279
just been too busy and this looks like a

285
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:40,040
big job but Jim remembers his Farm's

286
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:42,079
commitment to provide consumers with

287
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,519
safe produce and to protect his workers

288
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:47,240
at the same time he wants an operation

289
00:11:44,519 --> 00:11:48,200
he can be proud of so he decides today

290
00:11:47,240 --> 00:11:50,440
is the

291
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,519
day in less time than he would have

292
00:11:50,440 --> 00:11:54,720
guessed Jim has a good system for the

293
00:11:52,519 --> 00:11:56,360
Farm's crop protection agents complete

294
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,279
with good

295
00:11:56,360 --> 00:12:00,959
documentation Jim feels pretty good he's

296
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:03,360
solved a problem that's been nagging him

297
00:12:00,959 --> 00:12:06,690
for some time he's eager to share his

298
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:11,800
progress with Louisa and plan their next

299
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:14,560
[Music]

300
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:16,680
steps hey Jim I just passed the storage

301
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:18,760
 it looks terrific you did such a

302
00:12:16,680 --> 00:12:20,360
great job thanks Louisa you know I'm

303
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:22,720
feeling actually pretty excited about it

304
00:12:20,360 --> 00:12:24,519
myself once I got going it was actually

305
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:26,320
pretty easy and and now that we have it

306
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:28,480
organized I think we can insist that our

307
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:31,040
employees keep it clean well fortunately

308
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:33,199
we have good employees all we have to do

309
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,839
is get a system in place we have to

310
00:12:33,199 --> 00:12:37,440
train them and then it's just going to

311
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:39,320
be part of our routine I just love these

312
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,440
gaps well you know I wouldn't get all

313
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:43,000
that excited just yet I'm still

314
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,800
reluctant you know we're spending all

315
00:12:43,000 --> 00:12:46,079
this time and and I'm I'm worried about

316
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,720
whether or not we're really going to be

317
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:50,480
able to get the payback from people like

318
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:52,240
Russell and others I just don't know

319
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,040
okay I'll admit it too I've been a

320
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:56,199
little bit concerned about that um I

321
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:58,440
wondering should we get some

322
00:12:56,199 --> 00:13:00,760
professional advice what do you think

323
00:12:58,440 --> 00:13:02,320
maybe someone to keep us on track

324
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,320
because otherwise we're just going to

325
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,839
lose their Direction and I don't know if

326
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,399
you and I have the discipline to keep

327
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:10,639
doing this well Jim and Louisa chose to

328
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:12,199
get coaching from the private sector

329
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,360
there are many universities and

330
00:13:12,199 --> 00:13:17,360
extension offices that can provide

331
00:13:14,360 --> 00:13:19,959
quality advice also depending on the

332
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:23,639
size and disarray of your farm coaching

333
00:13:19,959 --> 00:13:23,639
may not be necessary

334
00:13:24,230 --> 00:13:31,600
[Music]

335
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:33,519
shortly after they talked to Dean Jim

336
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:35,480
and Louisa started getting professional

337
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:37,560
guidance from a private consultant

338
00:13:35,480 --> 00:13:39,680
specializing in gap

339
00:13:37,560 --> 00:13:42,079
certification other nearby farmers are

340
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:44,440
using qualified government University

341
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,800
and Industry resources but Jim and

342
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,360
Louisa were so busy they opted for a

343
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:51,920
private consultant and they're glad they

344
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,040
did in any case the advice this

345
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:56,120
consultant gives Louisa and jeem can

346
00:13:54,040 --> 00:13:58,560
benefit any producer wanting to

347
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:59,600
understand good agricultural practices

348
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
so let's

349
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,600
in a very methodical way and that's what

350
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,680
we want did the mitigation checklist

351
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:08,000
that I gave you help you going through

352
00:14:05,680 --> 00:14:10,360
the process Craig it sure did it made

353
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,920
the process so much easier yes and we've

354
00:14:10,360 --> 00:14:13,720
been actually incorporating good

355
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,600
agricultural practices into our standard

356
00:14:13,720 --> 00:14:18,000
Farm procedures to meet the requirements

357
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:19,920
of more particular buyer such as Russell

358
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,800
and Jim and I are excited to get this

359
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:24,560
process into action that's really great

360
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,720
let's take a look at what you've done to

361
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:29,600
date and see what else we need to

362
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:31,560
do the three talk about what hard work

363
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,759
it was to get ready for this Farm visit

364
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:35,959
today and all they learned about their

365
00:14:33,759 --> 00:14:38,279
own farming practices in the

366
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:39,800
process Lisa took on the challenge of

367
00:14:38,279 --> 00:14:41,639
learning the history of the land they

368
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:43,040
were planning to buy so they could

369
00:14:41,639 --> 00:14:45,120
expand their

370
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:47,320
operation before they invested in the

371
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,399
land next door Craig told her to do a

372
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:51,839
title search and detailed investigation

373
00:14:49,399 --> 00:14:53,680
of the prior land use she checked the

374
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:55,160
public records and the prior owner

375
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:57,279
records to be sure the land was

376
00:14:55,160 --> 00:14:59,600
historically used only to produce food

377
00:14:57,279 --> 00:15:01,880
crops and not used for industrial

378
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,800
purposes or to raise livestock such as

379
00:15:01,880 --> 00:15:05,480
cattle or chickens it's an easy

380
00:15:03,800 --> 00:15:07,560
transition thankfully she discovered the

381
00:15:05,480 --> 00:15:09,920
land was only used for food crop

382
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:12,560
production for over 50 years and there

383
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,519
was no history of chemical and microbial

384
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,399
contamination to be concerned

385
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,040
about Jim took on the task of detailing

386
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,880
what the land surrounding the plot they

387
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:24,040
hoped to buy was used for he started

388
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:26,959
with an accurate map and marked what all

389
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:28,759
the land around it was used for at first

390
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:30,440
Jim didn't understand why a neighbor's

391
00:15:28,759 --> 00:15:33,120
land use could really affect his

392
00:15:30,440 --> 00:15:35,160
cropping plans but when Craig told him

393
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,440
to map out the direction runoff water

394
00:15:35,160 --> 00:15:40,000
flowed from the neighbor land and how

395
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,800
hard and which way the wind blew Jim got

396
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,000
the

397
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:45,920
picture Jim's cousin out of New Mexico

398
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:48,639
had to adjust his plans because of a

399
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:51,000
neighbor's existing land use he wanted

400
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:53,279
to grow fresh leaf lettuce but then

401
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:55,959
realized that the wind and runoff from a

402
00:15:53,279 --> 00:15:59,040
nearby Dairy might carry pathogens onto

403
00:15:55,959 --> 00:16:01,160
his Fields so today Jim's cousin is is

404
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:02,720
earning less than he had hoped growing a

405
00:16:01,160 --> 00:16:05,839
nonf food

406
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,279
crop luckily Jim found no major problems

407
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:10,720
with their land but just to be sure it

408
00:16:08,279 --> 00:16:12,079
stays that way he's improved his fence

409
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:13,560
to keep the neighbor's horse from

410
00:16:12,079 --> 00:16:15,959
wandering onto his

411
00:16:13,560 --> 00:16:17,720
land well let's talk about fertilizer

412
00:16:15,959 --> 00:16:21,160
and compost next and Louisa that was

413
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:23,720
your task that's right Craig and let me

414
00:16:21,160 --> 00:16:25,839
tell you everything about compost I'm

415
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,120
the person now I know it

416
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:31,000
all she was responsible for the

417
00:16:28,120 --> 00:16:32,800
fertilizer use records on their Farm she

418
00:16:31,000 --> 00:16:35,519
discovered that the compost they buy

419
00:16:32,800 --> 00:16:37,519
follows a tested and certified method to

420
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:39,759
reduce microbial

421
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,600
contamination Louisa actually went to

422
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:44,120
the supplier to inspect their process

423
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:46,040
for herself she learned they carefully

424
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:48,399
controlled the process including the

425
00:16:46,040 --> 00:16:49,759
time temperature and number of turns

426
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,639
used to make the

427
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:54,880
compost the owners then tested each lot

428
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,000
at a certified lab to assure that it did

429
00:16:54,880 --> 00:17:00,279
not contain pathogenic bacteria Louisa

430
00:16:58,000 --> 00:17:02,440
established a farm policy to only buy

431
00:17:00,279 --> 00:17:05,480
compost that has been tested and shown

432
00:17:02,440 --> 00:17:07,319
to be free of pathogenic bacteria Jim

433
00:17:05,480 --> 00:17:09,520
and Louisa buy commercial soil

434
00:17:07,319 --> 00:17:11,839
amendments and fertilizers only from

435
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,679
reputable manufacturers who follow their

436
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:16,600
industry's best practices with Craigs

437
00:17:14,679 --> 00:17:18,760
help Louisa set up fertilizer

438
00:17:16,600 --> 00:17:21,199
application records for each individual

439
00:17:18,760 --> 00:17:23,360
field she added the manufacturers

440
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:25,520
certified analysis of their product and

441
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:28,120
set up a weekly time to update her

442
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:30,600
records Jim and Louisa are learning that

443
00:17:28,120 --> 00:17:33,760
running a top quality operation is only

444
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:35,280
half the task they must also document

445
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:36,480
all their efforts before they can be

446
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:38,840
audited and

447
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,960
certified Jim and Louisa have also

448
00:17:38,840 --> 00:17:43,240
learned that while the entire process

449
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,600
may seem overwhelming by working on

450
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:48,520
little steps every day it really doesn't

451
00:17:45,600 --> 00:17:50,559
take that longs and along the way they

452
00:17:48,520 --> 00:17:52,640
continue uncovering ways to make their

453
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,760
operation more efficient in many

454
00:17:52,640 --> 00:17:57,520
unexpected ways Jim and Louisa told

455
00:17:55,760 --> 00:17:59,080
Craig that their cheapest source of

456
00:17:57,520 --> 00:18:01,440
water was the stream that ran through

457
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:03,919
their property they wanted to use it if

458
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:06,880
testing proved the water was safe at the

459
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,720
same time they tested the well water but

460
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:11,280
the test results showed the stream

461
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,200
contaminated with ecoli so the farm

462
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,720
would need to rely on the well water for

463
00:18:13,200 --> 00:18:18,000
food crop related water needs you know

464
00:18:15,720 --> 00:18:20,679
now Farm policy tells workers to only

465
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:22,400
use wellwater for any operation where

466
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,120
the water will come into contact with

467
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,880
the edible portion of the

468
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:29,360
crops after all these months keeping

469
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:31,360
records has become second nature to

470
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:33,360
so he made a folder for all his water

471
00:18:31,360 --> 00:18:36,760
test results and has established an

472
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:38,600
annual water test as Farm policy this is

473
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:41,440
all part of their Farm

474
00:18:38,600 --> 00:18:43,600
gaps Louisa worked with Craig to develop

475
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:45,840
worker training and hygiene policies for

476
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:46,880
their farm and set up regular employee

477
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,360
training

478
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:51,640
sessions this allows her to update them

479
00:18:49,360 --> 00:18:53,159
on New Farm policies to improve the

480
00:18:51,640 --> 00:18:55,520
sanitation of their

481
00:18:53,159 --> 00:18:57,480
processes the farm now has a written

482
00:18:55,520 --> 00:19:00,120
policy that all workers must wash their

483
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,640
hands after eating going to the bathroom

484
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:05,720
taking breaks and anytime they return to

485
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,559
harvesting or handling the product she

486
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:10,480
insists that sick workers are either

487
00:19:07,559 --> 00:19:12,480
allowed to go home sent to the doctor or

488
00:19:10,480 --> 00:19:15,200
temporarily assigned to tasks where they

489
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:17,960
do not have contact with the fresh

490
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,480
produce at least once a month Louisa and

491
00:19:17,960 --> 00:19:23,440
Jim schedule a time to update workers on

492
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:25,840
new safety regulations and procedures

493
00:19:23,440 --> 00:19:27,720
and to reinforce the gaps especially

494
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:30,280
those involving cleaning and

495
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,440
sanitation they document their ongoing

496
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:34,679
program to keep workers trained and

497
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:36,880
reminded of critical points that affect

498
00:19:34,679 --> 00:19:38,679
the safety of their product thereby

499
00:19:36,880 --> 00:19:40,520
helping to protect the reputation of

500
00:19:38,679 --> 00:19:43,200
their farm and the

501
00:19:40,520 --> 00:19:45,000
industry if a cut happens on the job and

502
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:47,120
there's any chance that blood touch the

503
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:50,440
fresh produce all potentially

504
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:52,159
contaminated produce is thrown away Jim

505
00:19:50,440 --> 00:19:54,559
and Louisa have worked too hard to

506
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,159
endanger their good reputation over just

507
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:59,720
a few dollars worth of produce in the

508
00:19:57,159 --> 00:20:01,679
short run it hurts but in the long run

509
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:02,760
they know it is a small price to pay for

510
00:20:01,679 --> 00:20:05,240
a top

511
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,280
reputation Louisa also established

512
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:09,400
written policies that all Harvest tools

513
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:12,159
are washed and cleaned with portable

514
00:20:09,400 --> 00:20:14,480
water and rinsed with a food quality

515
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:16,480
sanitizer the farm now has written

516
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:18,760
policies that are enforced to ensure

517
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:21,919
that all washing and packing areas are

518
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,520
kept clean dust free and

519
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,000
sanitized here Craig shows Jim how to

520
00:20:24,520 --> 00:20:29,559
measure the strength of his washwater

521
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:32,080
sanitizer all the bins and Trays holding

522
00:20:29,559 --> 00:20:34,000
the fresh produce are sanitized and only

523
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,840
new bags and boxes are

524
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:39,039
used all packing materials are stored

525
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:41,640
off the floor and away from

526
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:44,120
chemicals the storage unit is set up to

527
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:47,080
ensure contamination from Birds rodents

528
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:50,080
or insects will not occur and just to be

529
00:20:47,080 --> 00:20:52,159
sure Jim sets out non bait rodent traps

530
00:20:50,080 --> 00:20:54,600
spaced at recommended intervals and

531
00:20:52,159 --> 00:20:56,520
makes a map of the numbered traps he

532
00:20:54,600 --> 00:20:58,240
then establishes a schedule to

533
00:20:56,520 --> 00:20:59,559
frequently check and change out the

534
00:20:58,240 --> 00:21:01,600
traps

535
00:20:59,559 --> 00:21:04,280
packed product is kept in a clean

536
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:06,240
well-maintained cold room at the optimum

537
00:21:04,280 --> 00:21:09,640
temperature to maintain post Harvest

538
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:11,559
quality and to reduce microbial growth

539
00:21:09,640 --> 00:21:13,720
Jim and Louisa have worked hard to

540
00:21:11,559 --> 00:21:16,400
produce their crop and maintain high

541
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:18,279
standards for quality and safety they

542
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,320
have labeled every box with tracking

543
00:21:18,279 --> 00:21:23,600
codes to allow for Trace back in the

544
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:25,200
event of quality or food safety problems

545
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,919
they have also set up systems to

546
00:21:25,200 --> 00:21:28,880
maintain these standards through the

547
00:21:26,919 --> 00:21:30,760
last phase of their process

548
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:33,039
transportation to the

549
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:35,360
buyer Jim once thought he was saving

550
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,279
money by hiring discount shippers to

551
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:38,960
take his produce to Market started doing

552
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:40,760
then he talked to Dean again we have a

553
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:43,159
checklist that we go through that'll

554
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:45,320
tell you uh the cleanliness of the of

555
00:21:43,159 --> 00:21:47,400
the van and the temperature that we want

556
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:48,880
to ship our produce at so it's a whole

557
00:21:47,400 --> 00:21:52,159
checklist and if you check for those

558
00:21:48,880 --> 00:21:53,640
things if you use another shipper then I

559
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,679
think you'll be

560
00:21:53,640 --> 00:21:59,120
