1
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:12,690
hello again it's spring the sun is

2
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,619
shining some of the time everything is

3
00:00:12,690 --> 00:00:18,090
growing lots of birds and bees and other

4
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:20,670
creatures are flowing around doing their

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:22,830
thing and it's time to get out in the

6
00:00:20,670 --> 00:00:24,869
garden and this is I've been a little

7
00:00:22,830 --> 00:00:26,789
bit stuck trying to finish my book

8
00:00:24,869 --> 00:00:28,949
because I keep looking out the window

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:32,369
and thinking I should be out there doing

10
00:00:28,949 --> 00:00:35,219
things outside so I thought given time

11
00:00:32,369 --> 00:00:37,890
let's do this little video bell books I

12
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,079
would do a video about a couple of books

13
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:43,950
to do with gardening and they both come

14
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,930
out in the last month or so the first

15
00:00:43,950 --> 00:00:49,590
one I'm going to share with you is

16
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:51,539
called edible paradise it's by a woman

17
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,460
called Vera I wish I could pronounce her

18
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,980
surname I could not do it justice I'm

19
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,410
sure we don't get very well trained in

20
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:01,140
foreign languages in England but there

21
00:00:58,410 --> 00:01:02,370
there it is Vera I do apologize for not

22
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,700
knowing how to pronounce your surname

23
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:08,869
she's from the Netherlands and she's

24
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:11,580
been gardening for over 30 years and

25
00:01:08,869 --> 00:01:15,450
this book is all about her experiences

26
00:01:11,580 --> 00:01:17,700
around learning how to grow plenty of

27
00:01:15,450 --> 00:01:20,869
food well what'd she say here herbs

28
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,490
flowers and veggies in any space and

29
00:01:20,869 --> 00:01:26,430
it's very much focused on a permaculture

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:32,040
approach it's it's very much organic

31
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:33,329
it's no dig which is becoming people are

32
00:01:32,040 --> 00:01:35,100
becoming a bit more aware of how to do

33
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,520
no date particularly Charles darlings

34
00:01:35,100 --> 00:01:41,340
books and and she quotes him one of the

35
00:01:38,520 --> 00:01:46,680
people that inspired her and his lovely

36
00:01:41,340 --> 00:01:48,329
work it's full of color it's always easy

37
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,270
to skim these things from the back to

38
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:54,390
the front both of the books I'm going to

39
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:55,439
mention have a guide to the months of

40
00:01:54,390 --> 00:01:58,020
the year and what you can do at

41
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:02,030
different months so if you're starting

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,409
now which is May as I'm doing this video

43
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:06,149
you can just go straight to May and see

44
00:02:04,409 --> 00:02:08,039
okay what kind of things are we doing

45
00:02:06,149 --> 00:02:09,690
what do we need to do in May and some of

46
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,050
us are perhaps more experienced

47
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,570
gardeners and

48
00:02:11,050 --> 00:02:16,330
think of these two books this book

49
00:02:13,570 --> 00:02:17,860
certainly pitched at perhaps somebody

50
00:02:16,330 --> 00:02:21,670
has a bit more experience but it doesn't

51
00:02:17,860 --> 00:02:24,750
assume that you know how to do things do

52
00:02:21,670 --> 00:02:26,620
everything so it's it's a lovely book

53
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:28,510
regardless of whether you have a lot of

54
00:02:26,620 --> 00:02:29,680
experience of not because there's

55
00:02:28,510 --> 00:02:32,280
something in here for everybody and I

56
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:35,020
was certainly enjoying reading this book

57
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:38,050
she has quite a lot about polycultures

58
00:02:35,020 --> 00:02:41,470
so polycultures are how we put plants

59
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:45,250
together in what we call in permaculture

60
00:02:41,470 --> 00:02:47,380
guilds so a guild is a collection of

61
00:02:45,250 --> 00:02:50,200
species but in this case we're talking

62
00:02:47,380 --> 00:02:54,610
plants primarily which are placed

63
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:56,890
together deliberately in order to create

64
00:02:54,610 --> 00:03:01,450
mutual benefit and beneficial

65
00:02:56,890 --> 00:03:03,730
relationships so for a fruit tree we

66
00:03:01,450 --> 00:03:06,460
might place around that fruit tree in

67
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:08,710
its proximity plants that may be

68
00:03:06,460 --> 00:03:11,680
providing nitrogen fixation or

69
00:03:08,710 --> 00:03:13,060
attracting pollinators or accumulating

70
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,540
particular minerals of values that

71
00:03:13,060 --> 00:03:18,940
plants or attracting pest predators that

72
00:03:16,540 --> 00:03:21,489
might prey on the plant and so on and we

73
00:03:18,940 --> 00:03:23,350
put these deliberate collections of

74
00:03:21,489 --> 00:03:25,540
species plants primarily together

75
00:03:23,350 --> 00:03:28,030
because it could include birds a bird

76
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,700
could be a pest predator that might be

77
00:03:28,030 --> 00:03:32,739
attracted to maybe eating the bugs in

78
00:03:30,700 --> 00:03:35,020
the fallen fruit which stop that cycle

79
00:03:32,739 --> 00:03:38,640
of those bugs impacting the fruit next

80
00:03:35,020 --> 00:03:41,320
year and she starts off by looking at

81
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,190
what you can do in containers in the

82
00:03:41,320 --> 00:03:48,700
garden back to this how do I show this

83
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,190
and put into the camera at the same time

84
00:03:48,700 --> 00:03:52,690
but you can see it's full of beautiful

85
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:56,350
photographs both of these books full of

86
00:03:52,690 --> 00:03:59,920
lots of lovely photographs her favorite

87
00:03:56,350 --> 00:04:02,650
flowers to eat how you might put things

88
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:06,090
together so she looks at polycultures

89
00:04:02,650 --> 00:04:09,250
from the perspective of different levels

90
00:04:06,090 --> 00:04:12,310
we might cause of structural diversity

91
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:15,540
in this space so how she might do that

92
00:04:12,310 --> 00:04:18,160
with a container for instance and

93
00:04:15,540 --> 00:04:19,760
Hoegaarden her in her husband's garden

94
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,670
with the children

95
00:04:19,760 --> 00:04:25,430
and what they do through the year and

96
00:04:21,670 --> 00:04:26,780
slobby features of those other gardens

97
00:04:25,430 --> 00:04:29,150
throughout the year the different things

98
00:04:26,780 --> 00:04:33,140
she does different varieties of plants

99
00:04:29,150 --> 00:04:38,510
that she recommends it's a really lovely

100
00:04:33,140 --> 00:04:41,270
book she has a blog well I say a blog

101
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:42,830
yes there is a blog and the YouTube

102
00:04:41,270 --> 00:04:45,620
channel which is I'm a bit more familiar

103
00:04:42,830 --> 00:04:47,870
with which is in Dutch and there's an

104
00:04:45,620 --> 00:04:51,170
English one an english-language one as

105
00:04:47,870 --> 00:04:53,330
well which is really good and yes I just

106
00:04:51,170 --> 00:04:56,750
highly recommend this book it's really

107
00:04:53,330 --> 00:04:58,550
nice particularly the focus on how do

108
00:04:56,750 --> 00:05:01,700
you put plants together in order to

109
00:04:58,550 --> 00:05:04,600
create beneficial polycultures that's

110
00:05:01,700 --> 00:05:09,490
really nice lots of lovely photographs

111
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:09,490
so she's been growing since she was 12

112
00:05:10,540 --> 00:05:18,110
this chap Hugh Hugh Richards he's being

113
00:05:15,070 --> 00:05:19,940
he's had a YouTube channel since he was

114
00:05:18,110 --> 00:05:22,970
12 and has been gardening with his

115
00:05:19,940 --> 00:05:25,820
parents in he was 3 so he's just turned

116
00:05:22,970 --> 00:05:28,910
20 I believe and he's already written

117
00:05:25,820 --> 00:05:31,250
his first book it's amazing and it was

118
00:05:28,910 --> 00:05:33,410
very lucky to meet you he came when a

119
00:05:31,250 --> 00:05:36,560
permaculture design course with us last

120
00:05:33,410 --> 00:05:38,920
year and his book has come out

121
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:42,440
subsequent to this and he's an amazing

122
00:05:38,920 --> 00:05:45,740
it's a young man most people eat young

123
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:48,320
by my standards these days and not only

124
00:05:45,740 --> 00:05:50,090
has he written this book he's also got

125
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,620
this YouTube channel now which has had

126
00:05:50,090 --> 00:05:53,860
over he's got over a hundred thousand

127
00:05:51,620 --> 00:05:56,570
subscribers it's called Hughes nursery

128
00:05:53,860 --> 00:05:59,210
well worth checking out and he's really

129
00:05:56,570 --> 00:06:00,560
focused on helping people to learn how

130
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:03,680
to grow food for themselves and of

131
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:05,360
course as permaculturist s-- one of the

132
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:08,300
key things we can do in order to improve

133
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:11,320
and reduce our impact on the world is to

134
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,030
grow some of our own food and whose

135
00:06:11,320 --> 00:06:17,270
mission really is about making that

136
00:06:14,030 --> 00:06:18,500
really easy for people now he's but

137
00:06:17,270 --> 00:06:21,920
there's lots of books about gardening

138
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:23,540
around so Hughes focus on the book the

139
00:06:21,920 --> 00:06:26,360
idea for the book is how do you grow

140
00:06:23,540 --> 00:06:31,160
lots of different vegetables in about 19

141
00:06:26,360 --> 00:06:32,599
different vegetables in one place so

142
00:06:31,160 --> 00:06:35,449
it's kind of

143
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,779
looking at a poly culture is it's kind

144
00:06:35,449 --> 00:06:40,969
of not quite crop rotation but he takes

145
00:06:38,779 --> 00:06:44,360
that into account we looks at how you

146
00:06:40,969 --> 00:06:50,360
could create a three meter by 1.2 meter

147
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:52,939
or 10 foot by 4 foot bed and grow lots

148
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,669
of different vegetables and once we get

149
00:06:52,939 --> 00:06:58,699
past the beginning part which just looks

150
00:06:55,669 --> 00:07:00,999
at how to make compost and make your

151
00:06:58,699 --> 00:07:08,569
raised bed pretty kind of simple stuff

152
00:07:00,999 --> 00:07:11,719
he gets into whoops yeah the the plans

153
00:07:08,569 --> 00:07:14,680
the year plans and so each of these

154
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:18,139
raised beds is divided into ten rows

155
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:20,839
along the bed and he takes you through

156
00:07:18,139 --> 00:07:22,430
what to plant at each row throughout the

157
00:07:20,839 --> 00:07:27,199
whole year and that's the basis of the

158
00:07:22,430 --> 00:07:29,379
book so how to grow the different plants

159
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:34,479
or hints and tips that he has for that

160
00:07:29,379 --> 00:07:40,309
and each each month has its own section

161
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:42,050
so we can may so each time you're

162
00:07:40,309 --> 00:07:44,269
looking at what's in the bed what should

163
00:07:42,050 --> 00:07:46,550
be in the bed he's telling you how to

164
00:07:44,269 --> 00:07:48,829
grow things and what to raise when and

165
00:07:46,550 --> 00:07:49,430
when you plant them out and someone who

166
00:07:48,829 --> 00:07:52,039
so forth

167
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,110
and the whole book is the book is mostly

168
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,149
focused around all of that and then

169
00:07:54,110 --> 00:07:58,099
towards the end once you got to the end

170
00:07:56,149 --> 00:08:02,569
of your first year you then gives you

171
00:07:58,099 --> 00:08:07,399
some ideas for future years so in

172
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:12,589
particular situations so cool climate

173
00:08:07,399 --> 00:08:14,149
flaunting low rainfall planting a salad

174
00:08:12,589 --> 00:08:16,519
bed and so on and this one is all about

175
00:08:14,149 --> 00:08:19,219
if you don't have much time you want to

176
00:08:16,519 --> 00:08:20,930
make it really easy and then they talks

177
00:08:19,219 --> 00:08:25,279
a little bit about rotation and so on

178
00:08:20,930 --> 00:08:28,519
but I'd say of course what's in this

179
00:08:25,279 --> 00:08:30,229
book is not new but the way he's put it

180
00:08:28,519 --> 00:08:31,639
together for me I've not seen that

181
00:08:30,229 --> 00:08:34,250
before and I think it's a really nice

182
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:37,449
way of supporting people and this is

183
00:08:34,250 --> 00:08:39,589
very much for people who are beginners
