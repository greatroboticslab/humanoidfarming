features Steven Cornett of nature isn't

11
00:00:25,109 --> 00:00:30,390
always right steven is a regenerative

12
00:00:27,890 --> 00:00:32,640
small-scale farmer who's had a really

13
00:00:30,390 --> 00:00:35,010
successful market garden over the last

14
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,579

he's on a mission to equip as many

19
00:00:42,450 --> 00:00:46,110
people as possible to get started with

20
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:48,329
their farm even if it's in their

21
00:00:46,110 --> 00:00:51,090
backyard steven is a wealth of knowledge

22
00:00:48,329 --> 00:00:53,430
and we covered so many topics please

23
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:56,129
consider this video a 30,000 foot

24
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:57,899
overview of small-scale regenerative

25
00:00:56,129 --> 00:01:00,660
farming and how you can get started

26
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,760
growing big in a small space I will of

27
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:05,729
course provide as many info cars right

28
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:08,070
here as I possibly can linking topics

29
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,140
covered it in this video to videos on

30
00:01:08,070 --> 00:01:12,270
Stevens Channel where he goes more in

31
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,130
depth so in this video we'll get to know

32
00:01:12,270 --> 00:01:16,830
Steven a little bit about how he got

33
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:19,290
into farming his beliefs about farming

34
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:22,110
why his name is nature's always right

35
00:01:19,290 --> 00:01:24,240
how he set his farm on a small scale to

36
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:26,430
be really successful and what he and his

37
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,750
wife are up to next so without further

38
00:01:26,430 --> 00:01:29,750
ado let's get into the video

39
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:46,720
[Music]

40
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:54,010
so what did seven-year-old Stephen do

41
00:01:50,980 --> 00:01:56,380
nothing man oh so no seven years old uh

42
00:01:54,010 --> 00:01:57,910
probably a video game designer something

43
00:01:56,380 --> 00:01:59,979
like that I think my first job was

44
00:01:57,910 --> 00:02:01,690
working at a golf course in all 15 and I

45
00:01:59,979 --> 00:02:03,580
had to do weed whacking and mowing lawn

46
00:02:01,690 --> 00:02:06,210
and I needed it and like I promised

47
00:02:03,580 --> 00:02:08,350
myself I'm never working outside ever

48
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:09,759
I'm gonna go to college and then get a

49
00:02:08,350 --> 00:02:12,070
desk job you know that's what I thought

50
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:13,180
my head and then I got older and I got

51
00:02:12,070 --> 00:02:15,880
some more wisdom and I learned more

52
00:02:13,180 --> 00:02:20,080
about reality and the world and all the

53
00:02:15,880 --> 00:02:22,390
stuff and and I realized today I'm with

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,820
my friend Steven Cornett everybody

55
00:02:22,390 --> 00:02:27,459
nature's always right and we're here at

56
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:29,860
his property before he leaves to

57
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,959
Tennessee and we're doing some cleanup

58
00:02:29,860 --> 00:02:33,910
today and I thought I would come out and

59
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:35,950
share with you guys about how you can

60
00:02:33,910 --> 00:02:38,530
get started in a small space with

61
00:02:35,950 --> 00:02:40,390
regenerative farming so Lauren lemon

62
00:02:38,530 --> 00:02:44,799
grove San Diego as you can see we're in

63
00:02:40,390 --> 00:02:46,840
a backyard so I do all of this in my

64
00:02:44,799 --> 00:02:48,459
backyard plus over time I got other

65
00:02:46,840 --> 00:02:50,260
plots so my next-door neighbor's yard

66
00:02:48,459 --> 00:02:52,540
had moved into his yard and then I've

67
00:02:50,260 --> 00:02:54,280
rented or leased another plot down the

68
00:02:52,540 --> 00:02:56,500
road and tell us what your lease terms

69
00:02:54,280 --> 00:02:59,260
are you pay them in I pay them in

70
00:02:56,500 --> 00:03:00,970
vegetables so I found people that wanted

71
00:02:59,260 --> 00:03:03,100
their yards to be improved or turned

72
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:04,870
into gardens and in exchange

73
00:03:03,100 --> 00:03:06,820
given the vegetables like it's the best

74
00:03:04,870 --> 00:03:09,130
lease ever yeah that's so really nicely

75
00:03:06,820 --> 00:03:10,660
if I like those terms how much space did

76
00:03:09,130 --> 00:03:12,760
you have when you first started carving

77
00:03:10,660 --> 00:03:14,260
yeah okay so well when I first started

78
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:17,080
farming this is like eight years ago

79
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:18,670
another part of San Diego and my best

80
00:03:17,080 --> 00:03:20,440
friend Jarrett Smith started a farm

81
00:03:18,670 --> 00:03:24,280
called Jared's real food that started

82
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:25,989
just with like 24 8 by 4 foot raised

83
00:03:24,280 --> 00:03:27,280
beds now fast forward to here three

84
00:03:25,989 --> 00:03:29,200
years ago or a little over three years

85
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,500
ago when I started this the first part

86
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,870
of the plot was this square right here

87
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:36,970
and initially that's all the landlord's

88
00:03:34,870 --> 00:03:39,700
allowed me to do they didn't but over

89
00:03:36,970 --> 00:03:41,049
time as they saw be more successful and

90
00:03:39,700 --> 00:03:42,790
they liked it more and things like that

91
00:03:41,049 --> 00:03:46,450
they allowed me to build a few more beds

92
00:03:42,790 --> 00:03:48,010
over here for like a home gardener or I

93
00:03:46,450 --> 00:03:50,470
guess someone in their apartment got a

94
00:03:48,010 --> 00:03:52,230
bunch of really nice soil these grow

95
00:03:50,470 --> 00:03:55,050
bags and the system which is awesome

96
00:03:52,230 --> 00:03:57,569
it's a cool system if you want to have

97
00:03:55,050 --> 00:03:59,129
another area I can move these to which

98
00:03:57,569 --> 00:04:00,660
is kind of neat at different times of

99
00:03:59,129 --> 00:04:02,900
the year you're gonna get better Sun in

100
00:04:00,660 --> 00:04:04,830
different areas so you can move it there

101
00:04:02,900 --> 00:04:06,900
that's something I like about the girl

102
00:04:04,830 --> 00:04:08,880
bags and now what I'm doing because I'm

103
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:11,099
leaving I'm just I'm selling these so

104
00:04:08,880 --> 00:04:12,569
I'm gonna get a bunch of my money and

105
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,280
like the investment money I'll get it

106
00:04:12,569 --> 00:04:16,940
back when I sell it I paid off my

107
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,799
investment in one season and made like

108
00:04:16,940 --> 00:04:22,710
twice what I put into it so it was very

109
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:24,150
effective for a short little season kind

110
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:27,479
of one of the things I wanted to prove

111
00:04:24,150 --> 00:04:29,160
was possible in a backyard what's the

112
00:04:27,479 --> 00:04:31,050
show you could create all your own

113
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:32,190
nutrients on-site or at least most of

114
00:04:31,050 --> 00:04:34,380
the nutrients that you needed for your

115
00:04:32,190 --> 00:04:35,610
farm on-site and I wanted you to show

116
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,710
that you could start farming in a

117
00:04:35,610 --> 00:04:39,600
backyard on a really small scale be

118
00:04:37,710 --> 00:04:41,400
successful at that and then go to the

119
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,080
next level at a larger scale so that's

120
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:45,060
kind of the whole reason behind this

121
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,669
backyard and this YouTube channel that I

122
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:49,139
make all about doing this stuff as well

123
00:04:47,669 --> 00:04:51,240
the chicken coop is a big deal for me

124
00:04:49,139 --> 00:04:52,710
that's how I make all of my compost 20

125
00:04:51,240 --> 00:04:54,540
chickens in there dropping a lot of

126
00:04:52,710 --> 00:04:57,750
manure I can make really good compost

127
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:59,880
I'm betting and everything compost

128
00:04:57,750 --> 00:05:03,479
number one so the chicken coop is a deep

129
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:06,570
litter system which means I'm putting in

130
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,210
layers of carbon in here vegetative

131
00:05:06,570 --> 00:05:11,130
material like straw leaves cardboard

132
00:05:09,210 --> 00:05:13,410
things like that floor is like al is

133
00:05:11,130 --> 00:05:15,360
alive it's always making compost so what

134
00:05:13,410 --> 00:05:17,940
I do is I rake it all out of here and I

135
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:22,500
take it out here and then I mix it with

136
00:05:17,940 --> 00:05:24,690
a bed of vegetables that's done for more

137
00:05:22,500 --> 00:05:27,930
greens to make the ratio correct and

138
00:05:24,690 --> 00:05:30,630
cool so this is what you describe as the

139
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:33,000
engine of your farm yes definitely this

140
00:05:30,630 --> 00:05:35,070
works I was able to run my Market Garden

141
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,240
for three years basically just off this

142
00:05:35,070 --> 00:05:40,889
this compost and not much else but from

143
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,349
a business standpoint it's cheaper to

144
00:05:40,889 --> 00:05:45,270
buy in the compost that to use my labor

145
00:05:43,349 --> 00:05:47,580
if you wanna do this as a business and I

146
00:05:45,270 --> 00:05:49,740
recommend buying it but it's still great

147
00:05:47,580 --> 00:05:52,500
to have a system like this to process

148
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:54,870
all of your leftover waste they're

149
00:05:52,500 --> 00:05:58,590
making compost for me for free with no

150
00:05:54,870 --> 00:06:01,500
work what would you tell Stephen eight

151
00:05:58,590 --> 00:06:04,320
years ago Stephen okay I got to go work

152
00:06:01,500 --> 00:06:05,789
smarter and not harder a lot of things

153
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:07,559
like that were hard on my back

154
00:06:05,789 --> 00:06:09,990
I'm just bending over and lifting things

155
00:06:07,559 --> 00:06:11,279
like that or you know so now that I'm

156
00:06:09,990 --> 00:06:14,550
older I do a lot more things

157
00:06:11,279 --> 00:06:15,900
ergonomically and or I'm gonna do a task

158
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:17,969
I try to think well what's the least

159
00:06:15,900 --> 00:06:19,499
physical effort I could do to get it

160
00:06:17,969 --> 00:06:21,689
done I guess I tell my younger self to

161
00:06:19,499 --> 00:06:25,469
think about your future body and take

162
00:06:21,689 --> 00:06:27,539
care of it this is the disaster this so

163
00:06:25,469 --> 00:06:32,300
this is my worm system it's essentially

164
00:06:27,539 --> 00:06:32,300
designed on the three toe system I like

165
00:06:33,559 --> 00:06:39,330
I got your top taupe here is where your

166
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:41,370
fresh is adding will be most of your

167
00:06:39,330 --> 00:06:43,559
worms will be also a tote underneath

168
00:06:41,370 --> 00:06:46,439
this is typically where your castings

169
00:06:43,559 --> 00:06:48,899
will be any juice or like the leachate

170
00:06:46,439 --> 00:06:51,389
that comes out fall into the third toe

171
00:06:48,899 --> 00:06:53,789
and on my system this whole bottom shelf

172
00:06:51,389 --> 00:06:55,770
here is the third tone I did this to

173
00:06:53,789 --> 00:06:58,110
save money cuz I would have had to buy a

174
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,779
third tote for each one of these it's

175
00:06:58,110 --> 00:07:02,759
modular I can have more totes to it if

176
00:07:00,779 --> 00:07:04,349
you take this out and carry it to where

177
00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:06,930
I want to fertilize so it's been a

178
00:07:04,349 --> 00:07:09,419
really great system for me why nature is

179
00:07:06,930 --> 00:07:11,729
always right sure came from the idea

180
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,129
that this is a nature's are already a

181
00:07:11,729 --> 00:07:16,259
perfect design as perfect as it could be

182
00:07:14,129 --> 00:07:18,479
on this imperfect planet it's the idea

183
00:07:16,259 --> 00:07:21,449
that nature itself is gonna provide the

184
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:24,779
best solutions for growing food for

185
00:07:21,449 --> 00:07:26,099
health or whatever issues that we really

186
00:07:24,779 --> 00:07:27,839
have on this book on this planet it's

187
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:30,360
already the solutions are already here

188
00:07:27,839 --> 00:07:32,099
for us to to take and use but

189
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:34,020
unfortunately especially in Western

190
00:07:32,099 --> 00:07:36,059
society we've gone down this road of

191
00:07:34,020 --> 00:07:38,370
thinking that our God and that we are

192
00:07:36,059 --> 00:07:40,169
more than God we can create on top of

193
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:41,490
God so we've done things like GMO crops

194
00:07:40,169 --> 00:07:43,439
and other scimplet you know

195
00:07:41,490 --> 00:07:45,419
synthetically derived pharmaceuticals

196
00:07:43,439 --> 00:07:48,379
you know all of this is just mimicry

197
00:07:45,419 --> 00:07:51,629
fentanyl or oxycontin this is a

198
00:07:48,379 --> 00:07:54,930
synthetic derivative of opium which

199
00:07:51,629 --> 00:07:57,300
comes from a plant so nothing is new the

200
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:59,039
airplane we mimic the bird like we

201
00:07:57,300 --> 00:08:01,589
didn't come up with any of this stuff we

202
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:03,330
we saw it we saw it in creation we

203
00:08:01,589 --> 00:08:06,059
mimicked it and then we use it or we

204
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:08,129
improve it but we haven't really created

205
00:08:06,059 --> 00:08:10,439
any so I guess it just goes back to the

206
00:08:08,129 --> 00:08:12,959
idea that nature and natural systems

207
00:08:10,439 --> 00:08:15,599
will always be the best way to grow food

208
00:08:12,959 --> 00:08:17,490
so trying to find kind of strike the

209
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,689
balance between because agriculture

210
00:08:17,490 --> 00:08:20,159
isn't a natural

211
00:08:18,689 --> 00:08:22,499
process right so trying to make

212
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:22,999
agriculture as natural as as we possibly

213
00:08:22,499 --> 00:08:25,019
can

214
00:08:22,999 --> 00:08:26,580
what kind of health struggle did you

215
00:08:25,019 --> 00:08:28,110
encounter that led you into farming my

216
00:08:26,580 --> 00:08:29,369
big one the big health problem that I

217
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:32,610
had was self-inflicted

218
00:08:29,369 --> 00:08:35,519
mm-hmm because of listening to medical

219
00:08:32,610 --> 00:08:37,560
advice and I was desperate for a cure so

220
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:40,500
I had really bad acne when I was in high

221
00:08:37,560 --> 00:08:42,569
school some cystic acne and you know the

222
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:45,149
real nasty bad guy so yeah under my my

223
00:08:42,569 --> 00:08:46,589
back and so that's with a lot of

224
00:08:45,149 --> 00:08:48,089
teenagers it's a horrible experience and

225
00:08:46,589 --> 00:08:49,980
you hate it you hate how you look and so

226
00:08:48,089 --> 00:08:51,360
I wanted to fix it like now that I was

227
00:08:49,980 --> 00:08:53,220
on an antibiotic for like four or five

228
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:54,420
months because the theory is that you're

229
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:56,610
killing all the germs that live inside

230
00:08:54,420 --> 00:08:58,529
the pores so they can't get inflamed and

231
00:08:56,610 --> 00:09:01,250
then the pus develops and all that but

232
00:08:58,529 --> 00:09:04,279
if you guys know it's obliterates your

233
00:09:01,250 --> 00:09:06,449
gut bacteria on your whole body

234
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:07,439
massively damaging to the digestive

235
00:09:06,449 --> 00:09:10,199
system then later I did

236
00:09:07,439 --> 00:09:11,790
accutane which limits vitamin A

237
00:09:10,199 --> 00:09:13,800
production in your body and the

238
00:09:11,790 --> 00:09:16,439
lubrication of your body anyways what

239
00:09:13,800 --> 00:09:18,689
resulted from this was like digestive

240
00:09:16,439 --> 00:09:20,759
problems oh yeah I eventually had to go

241
00:09:18,689 --> 00:09:22,949
see a doctor even and to figure out what

242
00:09:20,759 --> 00:09:25,019
the heck's going on and but ultimately I

243
00:09:22,949 --> 00:09:26,790
adopter didn't help me I solved it

244
00:09:25,019 --> 00:09:28,589
myself I had to fix it myself because

245
00:09:26,790 --> 00:09:30,629
then I finally figured out what was

246
00:09:28,589 --> 00:09:33,029
going on and and while I was having the

247
00:09:30,629 --> 00:09:33,559
problems I was having and then change my

248
00:09:33,029 --> 00:09:37,939
diet

249
00:09:33,559 --> 00:09:42,089
boom fixed never had a problem again

250
00:09:37,939 --> 00:09:43,529
back behind here you're seeing 18

251
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:46,500
different grow beds here they're all

252
00:09:43,529 --> 00:09:49,470
about 40 foot long they're 30 inches

253
00:09:46,500 --> 00:09:52,620
wide and this is the standard Market

254
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:53,879
Garden like small scale farm size and a

255
00:09:52,620 --> 00:09:55,680
lot of people like it just because you

256
00:09:53,879 --> 00:09:57,809
can stand over it you can step over the

257
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,790
road really easy they're easy to work in

258
00:09:57,809 --> 00:10:02,370
stuff now my very small pathways though

259
00:09:59,790 --> 00:10:04,199
as you can see because I've got to fit

260
00:10:02,370 --> 00:10:06,209
as much grow room in here as possible

261
00:10:04,199 --> 00:10:08,759
because like I said I'm on in a backyard

262
00:10:06,209 --> 00:10:11,220
I'm this back square right here is about

263
00:10:08,759 --> 00:10:13,050
five thousand square feet it's like an

264
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:16,079
eighth of an acre back here so it's not

265
00:10:13,050 --> 00:10:18,269
very big and I focus on lots of crops

266
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:21,089
that are the most profitable so things

267
00:10:18,269 --> 00:10:24,269
that grow quickly turn over within 60

268
00:10:21,089 --> 00:10:27,000
days typically or I can harvest them for

269
00:10:24,269 --> 00:10:30,000
a very long window of time like chard or

270
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:32,370
kale or tomatoes cucumbers salad salad

271
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:34,860
mixes like my my go-to thing I'm

272
00:10:32,370 --> 00:10:37,080
make the most money on salad mix heads

273
00:10:34,860 --> 00:10:38,790
of lettuce and microgreens I really

274
00:10:37,080 --> 00:10:40,560
focus on those and I have a whole method

275
00:10:38,790 --> 00:10:42,510
for growing salad mixes and washing and

276
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,279
packing them and it's kind of a whole

277
00:10:42,510 --> 00:10:46,200
thing because there's a lot of labor

278
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:49,010
involved but we cut out some of that

279
00:10:46,200 --> 00:10:51,270
labor by some of these awesome DIY

280
00:10:49,010 --> 00:10:52,830
inventions that that the small farmers

281
00:10:51,270 --> 00:10:54,930
have come up with like the salad spinner

282
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:57,960
made from a washing machine or a greens

283
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:01,500
bubbler made from just pipe at a Jacuzzi

284
00:10:57,960 --> 00:11:03,360
pump so this is kind of half taken apart

285
00:11:01,500 --> 00:11:06,029
right now but this is my post-harvest

286
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:07,589
station it's most of its set up to clean

287
00:11:06,029 --> 00:11:09,839
salad greens and microgreens

288
00:11:07,589 --> 00:11:12,390
but this used to be was a greens bubbler

289
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:14,610
it basically blows air did this jacuzzi

290
00:11:12,390 --> 00:11:17,010
pump it blows it through these tubes and

291
00:11:14,610 --> 00:11:19,080
creates a ton of bubbles basically just

292
00:11:17,010 --> 00:11:20,730
mixing all the the greens pulling the

293
00:11:19,080 --> 00:11:21,900
dirt and bugs off and from there it goes

294
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:23,730
to the spinner

295
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:26,279
electricity's off otherwise I would show

296
00:11:23,730 --> 00:11:27,300
you but it just spins this basket now

297
00:11:26,279 --> 00:11:29,490
I'm just like yourself spinner at your

298
00:11:27,300 --> 00:11:32,100
house it gets off most of the water and

299
00:11:29,490 --> 00:11:34,200
then it comes through the drying table

300
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:37,740
it's got fans on it to flow air over the

301
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:42,270
top yeah and then after this I would bag

302
00:11:37,740 --> 00:11:44,220
the greens Curtis Stone for sure Curtis

303
00:11:42,270 --> 00:11:46,140
Stone the urban farmer on YouTube and

304
00:11:44,220 --> 00:11:47,610
he's also got a fantastic farming book I

305
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:49,950
recommend for everybody called the urban

306
00:11:47,610 --> 00:11:51,930
farmer so he's the one who really kind

307
00:11:49,950 --> 00:11:54,180
of dialed in these super small-scale

308
00:11:51,930 --> 00:11:55,770
techniques his stuff was all in urban

309
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:58,290
Lots and that's what was different about

310
00:11:55,770 --> 00:11:59,700
it so he's one who helped me to really

311
00:11:58,290 --> 00:12:01,709
conceptualize how to think of the

312
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:03,540
profitability of a crop how to analyze a

313
00:12:01,709 --> 00:12:05,610
crops performance and then and then

314
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:07,709
decide well maybe I should select

315
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:09,630
something else that would make a little

316
00:12:07,709 --> 00:12:11,730
bit more money because on a small scale

317
00:12:09,630 --> 00:12:14,220
like this every little bit counts all

318
00:12:11,730 --> 00:12:16,050
the efficiencies really matter too so he

319
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,089
helped me like really put all these

320
00:12:16,050 --> 00:12:20,640
ideas together with what I already knew

321
00:12:18,089 --> 00:12:24,810
about how to raise plants regenerative

322
00:12:20,640 --> 00:12:27,029
lee so how would you describe your style

323
00:12:24,810 --> 00:12:29,820
of farming zai know you take from a lot

324
00:12:27,029 --> 00:12:31,170
of different methodologies yeah I'm so

325
00:12:29,820 --> 00:12:33,060
for me it's I guess to call myself a

326
00:12:31,170 --> 00:12:34,980
natural farmer holistic farmer

327
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:36,450
regenerative farmer I don't know what

328
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:39,270
the right term would be I guess but I

329
00:12:36,450 --> 00:12:41,579
just like I use any method that is

330
00:12:39,270 --> 00:12:44,450
natural it's made from nature I either

331
00:12:41,579 --> 00:12:47,420
sell by making compost compost teas

332
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:49,760
do worm castings things that are made

333
00:12:47,420 --> 00:12:52,040
within nature like even using plants

334
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,990
such as cover crops using the plants

335
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:54,500
themselves to put nutrients down into

336
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:58,370
the soil

337
00:12:54,500 --> 00:13:01,220
no-till so we're never or very rarely

338
00:12:58,370 --> 00:13:02,960
tilling the ground or you know turning

339
00:13:01,220 --> 00:13:06,530
the subsoils and mixing those subsoils

340
00:13:02,960 --> 00:13:08,950
together it also chops up microbes

341
00:13:06,530 --> 00:13:11,210
fungal strands the communication network

342
00:13:08,950 --> 00:13:13,160
all the different billions and billions

343
00:13:11,210 --> 00:13:14,720
of organisms that exist some of the soil

344
00:13:13,160 --> 00:13:17,290
they're being disturbed their homes

345
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,730
being messed up and those microbes are

346
00:13:17,290 --> 00:13:22,580
responsible for the breakdown of

347
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,590
nutrients in the soil which then gets

348
00:13:22,580 --> 00:13:26,720
transmitted to the plants through

349
00:13:24,590 --> 00:13:29,830
communication the plants actually ask

350
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:33,920
for specific nutrients and they give out

351
00:13:29,830 --> 00:13:35,720
carbohydrates to the microbes so the

352
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:37,700
microbes get food and the plants get

353
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:40,910
food and there's this constant exchange

354
00:13:37,700 --> 00:13:42,620
going on the Korean natural farming now

355
00:13:40,910 --> 00:13:44,480
making your own nutrients kind of to the

356
00:13:42,620 --> 00:13:46,040
extreme where you can you can create

357
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:49,310
every input that you would ever need for

358
00:13:46,040 --> 00:13:50,900
your farm so I'm kind of constantly

359
00:13:49,310 --> 00:13:52,430
experimenting with all these different

360
00:13:50,900 --> 00:13:56,660
methods from around the world to see

361
00:13:52,430 --> 00:13:58,280
what works on this context as a growing

362
00:13:56,660 --> 00:14:00,380
for money or also for growing just for

363
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:02,540
your home scale what makes sense for

364
00:14:00,380 --> 00:14:05,330
everybody and I just want to really

365
00:14:02,540 --> 00:14:09,920
awake in people's minds to God's design

366
00:14:05,330 --> 00:14:11,870
of nature and plants and all of this how

367
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:13,430
they communicate with the soil give them

368
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,500
a deeper understanding that will allow

369
00:14:13,430 --> 00:14:19,370
them to garden without any chemicals

370
00:14:15,500 --> 00:14:21,670
with nothing just using the design of

371
00:14:19,370 --> 00:14:21,670
nature

372
00:14:21,910 --> 00:14:29,740
how has farming grown you as a person oh

373
00:14:25,230 --> 00:14:31,150
I can't even begin to yeah to tell you I

374
00:14:29,740 --> 00:14:34,030
want you to help me grow it helped me

375
00:14:31,150 --> 00:14:36,160
realize everything the truth about this

376
00:14:34,030 --> 00:14:38,980
world this reality that God is actually

377
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,840
real it helped me understand that there

378
00:14:38,980 --> 00:14:41,170
is a design and a designer to all of

379
00:14:40,840 --> 00:14:43,270
this

380
00:14:41,170 --> 00:14:45,820
I studied like biology slow biology and

381
00:14:43,270 --> 00:14:47,290
plants the more you dive down deeper

382
00:14:45,820 --> 00:14:49,630
deeper deeper it just gets more complex

383
00:14:47,290 --> 00:14:51,880
and I just had to admit that how is this

384
00:14:49,630 --> 00:14:53,260
not a design it's obviously a design the

385
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:55,240
way it all works together to you the way

386
00:14:53,260 --> 00:14:56,680
the soil the plants the birds the

387
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,860
animals the everything it's an obvious

388
00:14:56,680 --> 00:15:01,240
system and systems are designed I guess

389
00:14:59,860 --> 00:15:02,890
that was a big way that it changed me

390
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:04,390
and just the amount of lessons that are

391
00:15:02,890 --> 00:15:06,910
out in the garden or the farm it like

392
00:15:04,390 --> 00:15:09,070
the whole lesson of life is out there

393
00:15:06,910 --> 00:15:10,930
for you to go find if you're paying

394
00:15:09,070 --> 00:15:12,760
attention enough but ultimately I think

395
00:15:10,930 --> 00:15:14,950
it spiritually just strengthens my

396
00:15:12,760 --> 00:15:17,110
belief in God and that it's it is real I

397
00:15:14,950 --> 00:15:18,880
can't deny that creation we have no

398
00:15:17,110 --> 00:15:20,890
reason to deny God because you can't

399
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,810
deny that this is a creation in just

400
00:15:20,890 --> 00:15:24,250
finding out the truth that Wow the food

401
00:15:22,810 --> 00:15:26,920
that you grow in your backyard that is

402
00:15:24,250 --> 00:15:28,570
your medicine that is the key to your

403
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,370
health diet and what you put into your

404
00:15:28,570 --> 00:15:31,930
body and just knowing that that is the

405
00:15:30,370 --> 00:15:33,430
the truth because I've experienced it

406
00:15:31,930 --> 00:15:35,980
now for eight years I've experienced the

407
00:15:33,430 --> 00:15:44,800
change in my health my families have my

408
00:15:35,980 --> 00:15:46,450
mental health so you guys are on a big

409
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:48,610
adventure and something we didn't talk

410
00:15:46,450 --> 00:15:51,370
about earlier is why are we cleaning up

411
00:15:48,610 --> 00:15:53,770
your farm well because we're shutting it

412
00:15:51,370 --> 00:15:55,240
down because we're moving so it's really

413
00:15:53,770 --> 00:15:57,940
excited actually we're gonna be going to

414
00:15:55,240 --> 00:15:59,620
Tennessee to buy our dream land and

415
00:15:57,940 --> 00:16:00,910
homestead and all that so that's kind of

416
00:15:59,620 --> 00:16:03,280
the next part of the journey is how do I

417
00:16:00,910 --> 00:16:05,800
take a backyard farm take it out to the

418
00:16:03,280 --> 00:16:07,540
country and you know build a much bigger

419
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,040
really cool property so I'm excited to

420
00:16:07,540 --> 00:16:10,330
show everybody what's next so tell us

421
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,370
like what do you envision what's your

422
00:16:10,330 --> 00:16:14,680
ideal situation on so we're looking for

423
00:16:12,370 --> 00:16:16,330
like five to ten acres you know

424
00:16:14,680 --> 00:16:18,400
somewhere about like 30 to 50 minutes

425
00:16:16,330 --> 00:16:19,870
outside of a major city now for the land

426
00:16:18,400 --> 00:16:21,130
I want a little bit of flat a little bit

427
00:16:19,870 --> 00:16:22,540
of everything like a little bit flat a

428
00:16:21,130 --> 00:16:25,540
little bit of hills a little bit of

429
00:16:22,540 --> 00:16:27,520
forest in the back maybe a stream or a

430
00:16:25,540 --> 00:16:30,760
pond would be incredible don't have one

431
00:16:27,520 --> 00:16:32,530
maybe I'll build a pond but yes

432
00:16:30,760 --> 00:16:34,360
Tennessee is cool cuz it you know we get

433
00:16:32,530 --> 00:16:34,860
50 inches of rain out there so it's like

434
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,110
you

435
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:39,240
the irrigate and a lot of fun things but

436
00:16:37,110 --> 00:16:41,430
it'll be more difficult growing yeah a

437
00:16:39,240 --> 00:16:43,470
lot of bugs the weather's more difficult

438
00:16:41,430 --> 00:16:45,450
so different obstacles but this is one

439
00:16:43,470 --> 00:16:47,100
that you guys have waited for for a long

440
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:48,420
time yeah very long time something

441
00:16:47,100 --> 00:16:50,970
you've looked forward to for over a

442
00:16:48,420 --> 00:16:52,530
decade okay yeah most of that probably

443
00:16:50,970 --> 00:16:54,450
yeah I've been dreaming of having my own

444
00:16:52,530 --> 00:16:55,800
land and they're getting to develop

445
00:16:54,450 --> 00:16:58,860
whatever I want and doing you know a

446
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,540

I'm excited to combine trees and

448
00:17:00,540 --> 00:17:04,980
