00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,720
tirelessly stay tuned as we reveal how

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,640
these Innovations are transforming

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,119
Agriculture and helping Farmers around

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:30,400
the world to maximize yield and

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:32,759
sustainability technology number one AI

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,840
powered crop monitoring artificial

15
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,680
intelligence is revolutionizing crop

16
00:00:34,840 --> 00:00:39,480
monitoring by combining the power of

17
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:41,640
data with real-time analytics through

18
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:43,760
satellite imagery drones and ground

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:46,360
sensors farmers can receive instant

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:48,120
alerts about soil Health moisture levels

21
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,280
and potential pest

22
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,160
infestations imagine being able to

23
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:54,600
predict the perfect planting day or

24
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,960
identify areas of underperforming crops

25
00:00:54,600 --> 00:01:00,120
without even stepping into the field

26
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,800
John a farmer in Iowa adopted a ey power

27
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,479
monitoring and saw a 20% increase in

28
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:07,640
yield these Technologies enabled him to

29
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,640
make data driven decisions such as

30
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:12,080
optimizing irrigation schedules and

31
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:14,520
applying targeted Pest Control measures

32
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:18,159
which reduced costs and maximized crop

33
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:20,119
output as we move into 2024 AI tools

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,439
will become more accessible helping

35
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:24,840
farmers of all sizes to boost efficiency

36
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:27,479
and sustainability ultimately leading to

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:30,280
smarter more resilient agricultural

38
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,799
practices technology number two

39
00:01:30,280 --> 00:01:35,600
autonomous farming vehicles imagine a

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,119
fleet of tractors that can plow sew and

41
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,240
harvest without any human intervention

42
00:01:38,119 --> 00:01:43,720
That's The Power of autonomous farming

43
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,719
vehicles these machines use Advanced GPS

44
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:47,840
machine learning and sensor technology

45
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:51,159
to navigate Fields with Precision day

46
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,360
and night in California a large-scale

47
00:01:51,159 --> 00:01:56,000
farmer reported cutting his labor costs

48
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,079
by 30% in just one season by using

49
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:59,280
autonomous

50
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:00,960
Harvesters these vehicles are not only

51
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,280
more efficient but also help in

52
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:06,840
minimizing soil compaction by following

53
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:08,479
optimized paths plus they are safer

54
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:11,520
reducing the risk of accidents

55
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,440
associated with manual operations as we

56
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,920
head into 2024 more farmers are expected

57
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,040
to adopt autonomous vehicles ensuring

58
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,920
consistent farming operations even

59
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:24,360
amidst labor shortages the future is

60
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:27,560
here and it's self-driving technology

61
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,640
number three vertical farming systems

62
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:32,239
vertical farming is redefining how we

63
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,440
think about space in agriculture instead

64
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,080
of spreading out we're growing up by

65
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,599
using vertical Stacks Hydroponics and

66
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,000
LED lighting crops are grown indoors in

67
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:43,360
tightly controlled

68
00:02:41,000 --> 00:02:46,720
environments this method significantly

69
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,800
reduces water usage up to 95% less than

70
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,560
traditional farming and virtually

71
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,920
eliminates the need for pesticides in

72
00:02:51,560 --> 00:02:56,400
urban centers like Singapore where land

73
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,879
is scarce vertical Farms are producing

74
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,840
up to 200% more greens in just a

75
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,000
fraction of the space

76
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:05,080
these Farms can be set up in warehouses

77
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,159
shipping containers or even abandoned

78
00:03:05,080 --> 00:03:09,040
buildings making it possible to grow

79
00:03:07,159 --> 00:03:12,640
fresh produce closer to where people

80
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,720
live in 2024 expect to see vertical

81
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:17,159
farming become a key player in ensuring

82
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,599
food security especially in urban and

83
00:03:17,159 --> 00:03:21,400
resource scarce

84
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:24,159
environments technology number four

85
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:26,440
smart irrigation systems water is a

86
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,120
precious resource and smart irrigation

87
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:30,599
systems are here to make every drop

88
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,159
count utilizing data from weather

89
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:35,239
forecasts soil moisture sensors and

90
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,280
real-time monitoring these systems

91
00:03:35,239 --> 00:03:39,760
automatically adjust water delivery to

92
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,439
crops preventing both under and

93
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:44,439
overwatering for example smallscale

94
00:03:42,439 --> 00:03:46,959
farmers in India who switched to smart

95
00:03:44,439 --> 00:03:48,480
irrigation have reported up to a 50%

96
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,239
reduction in water usage while

97
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,519
maintaining or even increasing their

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,519
crop yields smart irrigation technology

99
00:03:53,519 --> 00:03:57,680
not only conserves water but also

100
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:00,640
reduces energy costs and minimizes

101
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,400
nutrient runoff into local Water waste

102
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,840
as we move further into 2024 these

103
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:07,280
systems will become even more

104
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,959
sophisticated integrating AI to predict

105
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,680
optimal watering times ensuring maximum

106
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:12,840
growth while conserving our planet's

107
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,519
most vital

108
00:04:12,840 --> 00:04:19,359
resource five technology number five

109
00:04:16,519 --> 00:04:20,959
blockchain for supply chain transparency

110
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,040
blockchain is not just for

111
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,840
cryptocurrency it's transforming the

112
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,120
agricultural supply chain too by

113
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:30,560
providing a transparent immutable Ledger

114
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,440
of every transaction blockchain ensures

115
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,120
that all players from Farmers to

116
00:04:32,440 --> 00:04:38,000
Distributors to Consumers have access to

117
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:40,520
the same verified data this level of

118
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,479
transparency helps prevent fraud reduce

119
00:04:40,520 --> 00:04:44,240
food waste and build trust with

120
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:47,120
consumers who want to know exactly where

121
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,240
their food comes from for instance a

122
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:51,280
coffee producer in Colombia is using

123
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:54,039
blockchain to track beans from Farm to

124
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:57,240
cup ensuring quality and Fair Trade

125
00:04:54,039 --> 00:04:59,120
Practices as we look towards 2024

126
00:04:57,240 --> 00:05:01,479
blockchain will play a critical role in

127
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,720
making Supply chains more transparent

128
00:05:01,479 --> 00:05:05,800
efficient and trustworthy enhancing

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,440
sustainability and consumer confidence

130
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:10,039
in the global Food Market which of these

131
00:05:08,440 --> 00:05:12,240
