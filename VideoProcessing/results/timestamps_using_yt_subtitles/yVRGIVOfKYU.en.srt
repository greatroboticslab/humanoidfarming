00:00:04,250 --> 00:00:10,349
my name's Alan Farquhar this is our farm

3
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,330
at Belmondo email jokes

4
00:00:10,349 --> 00:00:14,790
just outside of McCoy we found this

5
00:00:12,330 --> 00:00:16,949
property since about 95 the

6
00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:19,260
fourth-generation grower it's a good

7
00:00:16,949 --> 00:00:22,619
farm down here nice and flat plenty of

8
00:00:19,260 --> 00:00:24,510
irrigation and close to the sea and not

9
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,970
many neighbors which makes it very nice

10
00:00:24,510 --> 00:00:28,980
to live down here as well the project

11
00:00:26,970 --> 00:00:30,960
was initially suggested to me by a Maps

12
00:00:28,980 --> 00:00:33,210
officer I could it sounded like a good

13
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:36,000
idea so I made contact with pharmacist

14
00:00:33,210 --> 00:00:38,280
and then Shay got in touch and it's gone

15
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:39,780
on from being Ellen is a really

16
00:00:38,280 --> 00:00:41,700
progressive farmer they've adopted

17
00:00:39,780 --> 00:00:45,300
techniques such as controlled traffic

18
00:00:41,700 --> 00:00:47,430
and minimum till and some legume fellow

19
00:00:45,300 --> 00:00:49,320
crops for a number of years now so

20
00:00:47,430 --> 00:00:51,090
working with Ellen we really had to

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:53,309
focus on the things that were gonna make

22
00:00:51,090 --> 00:00:55,649
the biggest difference for this farm the

23
00:00:53,309 --> 00:00:58,289
first year shaded a complete analysis of

24
00:00:55,649 --> 00:00:59,609
our soil tests over many years and then

25
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:02,910
came back with fertilizer

26
00:00:59,609 --> 00:01:05,549
recommendations for each block the

27
00:01:02,910 --> 00:01:07,140
nutrient management plan was helpful

28
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:09,240
because it it gave me a different

29
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,850
perspective on how I could manage the

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:14,640
property particularly the the

31
00:01:11,850 --> 00:01:17,909
intricacies of different blends for each

32
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:20,850
paddock there's been a few different

33
00:01:17,909 --> 00:01:23,220
opportunities to join seminars and

34
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:25,740
workshops there's a soil seminar which

35
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:28,290
was very interesting and gave me a lot

36
00:01:25,740 --> 00:01:30,299
of information about the current

37
00:01:28,290 --> 00:01:31,710
thinking on soil science and how it

38
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,979
relates to cane production and the

39
00:01:31,710 --> 00:01:36,990
nutrient uptake of a crop of cane going

40
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:39,119
to those Souls workshops and having like

41
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:40,680
an expert soil scientist sort of

42
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,979
validating what's being said on the

43
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,909
grounds really helps us in our

44
00:01:42,979 --> 00:01:46,500
recommendations and also for the growers

45
00:01:44,909 --> 00:01:48,869
to accept what we're sort of

46
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,579
recommending and giving them that deeper

47
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,610
knowledge of why we're recommending

48
00:01:50,579 --> 00:01:56,579
these application rates it was a Google

49
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:58,340
Earth workshop which showed me a few

50
00:01:56,579 --> 00:02:01,320
more tips and tricks when it comes to

51
00:01:58,340 --> 00:02:04,020
using Google Earth which is very useful

52
00:02:01,320 --> 00:02:07,229
the Google Earth training is useful as

53
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:09,330
we give each grower a USB and on that's

54
00:02:07,229 --> 00:02:10,230
all their farm data we put yield maps on

55
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:13,959
there

56
00:02:10,230 --> 00:02:15,579
locating of their soil samples any ec

57
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:17,439
mapping that they've done and also their

58
00:02:15,579 --> 00:02:19,840
actual nutrient management plan so all

59
00:02:17,439 --> 00:02:22,840
the details can be saved into Google

60
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,250
Earth and then they can add to to that

61
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,069
program

62
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:30,069
things like hydrant locations they can

63
00:02:27,069 --> 00:02:32,829
plan a site for a new dam so it's really

64
00:02:30,069 --> 00:02:35,379
a useful management tool they can use in

65
00:02:32,829 --> 00:02:39,430
the future in addition as part of the

66
00:02:35,379 --> 00:02:41,739
pharmacists package I got a few more G

67
00:02:39,430 --> 00:02:44,139
dots for my irrigation system so that

68
00:02:41,739 --> 00:02:47,019
tells me a lot more about my soil

69
00:02:44,139 --> 00:02:50,379
moisture profile through the project we

70
00:02:47,019 --> 00:02:52,900
offer growers either soil test G dots or

71
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:54,519
some EC mapping Allen he chose the G

72
00:02:52,900 --> 00:02:58,389
dots and they can be a really useful

73
00:02:54,519 --> 00:03:00,730
soil moisture sensor and telling us when

74
00:02:58,389 --> 00:03:02,799
the soil profile is getting dry and

75
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,930
giving an indication of when irrigation

76
00:03:02,799 --> 00:03:07,480
needs to start because Ellen's already

77
00:03:04,930 --> 00:03:09,340
confident in his nutrient plans and what

78
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:11,709
fertilizer he can apply the G dot was a

79
00:03:09,340 --> 00:03:13,739
good option for him to select as it's a

80
00:03:11,709 --> 00:03:16,470
practical tool that can be used on farm

81
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:20,169
working with pharmacist gives you

82
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:22,199
someone else who's hasn't got a vested

83
00:03:20,169 --> 00:03:24,970
interest in selling your fertilizer and

84
00:03:22,199 --> 00:03:27,970
also is on your side as far as

85
00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,349
productivity goes the project gives us

86
00:03:27,970 --> 00:03:36,459
confidence that our farm management is

87
00:03:32,349 --> 00:03:39,010
the best it can be and that as well as

88
00:03:36,459 --> 00:03:41,319
working through the BMP project has

89
00:03:39,010 --> 00:03:44,680
given me the confidence that my

90
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:55,779
operation can withstand any scrutiny

91
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:55,779
