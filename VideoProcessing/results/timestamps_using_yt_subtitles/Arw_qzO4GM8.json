  "text": "good afternoon everybody my name is Eric sale I am a small fruit entomologist at University of Georgia and today I am going to talk about insect management for a commercial strawberry production in today's talk we will discuss season at the glass tests which pests occur what kind of the a year for strawberries then their management again will take a season at a glance look at their management options that we have then I will get discuss a few select tests in detail in terms of their biology and management at the end I will cover some aspects of pollinator management which obviously are important in Strawberry production systems so take when we look at a sort of a season at a glance the pests of strawberries starting with the transplant cut worms and aphids are important here at this stage of strawberries and when you will look at this season at a glass Slide the leaf green leaf shows that they are they feed on leaves strawberry shows they feed on fruit or flowers and this these sticks will show that they feed on stems or branches of strawberries so cut worms of course feed on on stems as well as foliage if it's they are sucking pests and they suck primarily on the leaves going moving on into winter it's sort of later part of winter two spots spider mite they start they all go all the way through flowering into Fruit growth period lead on on foliate of the strawberries then trips also they feed on flowers for the most part during flowering until uh fruit initial fruit growth period as well strawberry Clipper again feeds on flowers and sometimes smaller fruits also if it's again are important this time of the blueberry growing season then we as we move on lady ligus bugs on especially on their neutral strawberries come into play at early through starting with early fruit growth stage going all the way to harvest then we during the Harvest we have serious issues including sap beetles go on earworms and spotted ring desophila spotted Wing discipla has become more important for strawberries recently than it has been in the past as compared to some other Berry crops where it has been key test ever since it was detected in the mainland U.S so now we when we look at a management of those pests instead of a season at a glance look when we look at post planting fall to early to midwinter crickets are important we do have a couple options to spray cut worms recyclomine mites are important we do have some miter side options fire ants obviously we can use those baits that are available here at this screen that I am showing you now it comes directly from South East small fruit Consortium strawberry IPM guide and a number of researchers from the region that get together every year to update this guide so this is one of the best resources for you to learn about Pest and disease management for strawberries I highly recommend I'll share I'll show you the main screen and link to access that in the end so and then two spider mites obviously we have number of my decide options then we move on to pre-harvest or Bloom time late winter to early spring aphids fire ants floor trips slugs and the snails strawberry Clippers two spotted spider mics these are major pest insect pests or other pest issues of strawberries and this slide does list options that we have to control them then we moved into the Harvest period fire ants obviously still become uh issue set beetles slugs and snails have become serious issues if we don't manage the moisture in the fields spotted during the sofa obviously is is one of the key pests tarnish plant bugs and mites they are still mites can be problem year round for strawberries now I will get into you know this gives you a season at a glass look but I will show you a share with you a little bit of and details and some of the select tests so one thing before we get into annual plastic culture practices do limit many pests of strawberries for example strawberry root Vivo cyclamen mites they do this particular system does help minimize impact of those those pests and also root nibbling diseases starting with the two-spotted spider mite two spotted spider mites they're it's very small little sort of difficult to see without hand lens adults are translucent greenish yellow to Rusty brown or orange red in color they're about a half millimeter long oval bodies of those mites have two distinct dark spots on E1 on each side and which are which is sort of a distinguished distinguishing feature to separate these mites from other groups this is actually accumulation of waste products within the body that is visible through their body wall eggs are clear white and spherical newly had larvae have only six legs compared to the eight legs as they grow into older nymphs and adults they develop all uh four pairs of legs uh two spider spider mites the rate of development is highly variable and it is uh dependent on temperature ranging from 5 to 20 days to complete their cycle from egg to adult so females basically they have about two to four weeks lifespan and each female can lay several hundred eggs during that time which are enclosed in a fine silk webbing eggs hatch in about three days and then six-legged larvae emerge and undergo through two more things two modes to achieve than two nymphal stages and then adults emerge after the second stage and then adults they obviously restart the the whole process that whole process can be completed within five to twenty days depending on temperature and other conditions spider mite feeding on the the primarily feed on undersides of the leaves and sometimes the stems also they cause initial stippling which is shown in the picture on the bottom left on the screen a set of a white spots and eventually lead to chlorotic yellowing or some times it's called bronzing or graying of the leaves and in severe cases necrotic and the defoliation necrosis and defoliation can occur when populations are not controlled Leaf deformities stunted growth Peril Browning built and reduce the fluid quality quantity and yield quantity and quality are obviously the outcomes these mites produce silky webbing and leave behind skin castings and feces that reduce plants as static value and ability to for the synthesize monitoring is is relatively easy in a part that is up to 10 acre in in size you need to collect only 10 mid-tier leaflets per acre and observe them under 10x hand lens if the field is larger than 10 acres then only five leaflets per acre would suffice the thresholds is if you have uh five miles per leaflet early in the season that maybe that may warrant application of Mighty sides or if you have 10 mites per leaflet during fruit and season then that is when you need to make spray applications to control them there are a number of options that I showed you in the season at a glass slide as well acromide with the land cane Mite nyalta these are effective against all stages of Baron Savvy Zeal they are effective against eggs and juveniles portal agreement again juveniles and adults MP Horticultural oils these are organic organically approved products which can be used for organic production and the predatory mites obviously are the buyer control option if if you want to go that route the next pest the group that I will discuss today is sat beetles set me the speed on overripe fruit and are attracted to the alcohol produced by micro microorganisms feeding on this rotten fruit it can be problematic in Peach Plum and apple production systems as well at least three species of ripe fruit feeding beetles are pests of Southeastern strawberries there are no thresholds developed for set beetles in strawberries at this point observe ripe fruit when it's picking surface damage and tunneling if a harvest is anticipated to run long or if Beetle damage is suspected bait buckets placed at the edge of the field will attract small adults adult beetles so that's that's one way to control that and cultural control is highly recommended for set beetles because there are registered chemicals but those chemicals can cause issues with the during the Harvest we don't want to leave too much residues in there we're going to minimize the pesticide application during that Harvest Time me at buckets can also obviously serve as a one cultural control strategy trips now trips is another pest that has recently been problematic in some situations especially these chili trips they are serious pests in Florida and have been detected in Georgia as well I'm not sure the status of Chile trips in Alabama but they are they have emerged as a serious issues though both Larry and adults feed on on strawberries Underside the leaves they have piercing and second pest uh mouth Parts they are originally from Southeast Asia they have been several times intercepted in at the ports in in Florida and have been established in Florida since 2005 and in strawberries they have become serious issue since 2015 and now this is one of the key pests or one of the major pests in Strawberry systems in Florida agility trips they as I mentioned they have a piercing sucking mouth bars and they feed on underside of the leaves to some Jews and that leads to darkening of the leaflet and midriff as you see in this picture on the left side of the screen that can lead to Leaf curdling of the strawberries and the image in the middle shows that severe case scenarios of just chili traps symptoms and sometimes it also leads to bronzing and cracking up the fruit and it's extreme situation several studies have been done in Florida as I mentioned this issue in particular is predominant in Florida so lots of work has been done in Florida and they have developed Management Programs based on products here [Music] which is delegate a sale and ciazepir or axel these are effective products for for management obviously broad spectrum insecticides these are all three of these products are reduced risk products which is a better option to choose if if there is a choice but they'll be slightly more expensive likely then you have broad spectrum choices like bifantrin which will be um a relatively less effective but can be used in some situations and there will be less expensive option if you want to go that route then we also have some biorational options that can be used for organic or other reduced risk type systems which include Azera and my control and interestingly these and thermopathogenic nematodes when they were applied two times they provided really good results so these options are also available for organic Growers and also other systems where reduced risk option is a desired now let's get into spotted Wing discipla which is a key pest in most of the berry crops and is becoming increasingly important for strawberry systems not only in the Southeast but across the country even in California it has recently become serious issue in Strawberry systems as well it was originally discovered in stock strawberries in California in 2008 to 2009 as you see on this screen sort of an increase the spread of this in invasive pest across the mainland U.S 2009 all West Coast in Florida and then from that front on it just quickly spread across the country in 2015 we just stopped monitoring it because it was everywhere you looked and spotted when the name comes from these two dark spots on the uh exterior margins of the male wings that's why where the spotted Wing name comes from and males can also be identified using these two black columns as a feature on the front legs females of this species are uniquely blessed with this very sclerotized and serrated over Pastor that they use to lay eggs in otherwise healthy fruit larvae develop inside the fruit and start feeding into the whole generation from larvae from egg laying to adult emergence can be completed in eight to ten days at 25 degrees Centigrade which can happen faster if the temperature is higher so this kind of tells that this fly can go to several Generations in one field season over here is just images using blueberries we generated this image of how the fruit damage progresses starting from over position to basically broadening of the complete unmarketable fruit is it takes about three to four days beyond that is fruit is not marketable overall impact of this fly was estimated to be 718 million dollars in the U.S it was estimated in 2014 Plus in additional management costs included about 120 million 129 million dollars which means it's approximately a billion dollar pest when you look at take all the crops into account starting with the monitoring initially we have used these 32 ohms plastic cups weighted with the yeast sugar slurry which is a kind of a messy if you leave it for a week it's become stinky and more than that it becomes really stinky and not easy to manage recently several states were participated in these studies to develop these dry traps which is a red sticky card embedded with these commercially available lures and they provided comfortable results and we are recommending this now for monitoring of swd these sticky red sticky card based traps we did monitoring for several years in in Georgia blueberries and what we noticed is that flies were active year round they don't sleep during the winter or slow down they just stick around and what more interestingly but but you can see in this slide is that numbers were higher in the wooded areas nearby than the field themselves for the most part of the year so it means there is a obviously alternative host to plants that occur in the wooded areas as you see in this picture we have Carl Pines that are mostly around the blueberry Orchards here are other carbs including strawberries but the understory is filled with several other species and when we looked within those several species were identified where swd females were able to lay eggs and complete development in many of those plants in the world so there's something that we need to do to eliminate those to those alternative hosts which will help in the long term but for now management is includes biological control chemical control behavioral and cultural control biological control this being an invasive species biological control is is very complicated a lot of work has been done on classical bio control by large teams of researchers from multiple institutions after eight to ten years of work finally we were able to get permits of to release those exotic parastors that we imported from native regions of swd China and South Korea and several states are now building up the colonies to test to release those in the field and see how they will help control swd currently there is no bio control in the field based on our native Paris stones all right so chemical control is the primary means to control it I'm just showing you this one slide which was the first attempt to control swd back in 2012. you see very few options primarily organophosphorus and pythroids with spinosins now look at this this is where we stand right now we have lots of options chemical options to control swd they belong to several chemical classes which means we have the option to do really nice resistance management which is highly recommended because resistance has become a major issue in California uh in in many cropping systems there we haven't seen resistance in other states yet but some states have started to show initial signs of it so highly recommended that Growers Implement resistance management by rotating products from one class to another when you look at organic management that's where we are in trouble because entrust is the only one that has if good efficacy but even that doesn't touch the line of threshold of being good so it means we need to add additional non-chemical components to make sure we are able to control a stability in organic systems here are some sample management season-long management programs again these are just a set of samples now we have several chemical options that can be included and in General weekly applications are recommended in organic systems we have to make some chemicals don't have week-long residues we need to go back after three days to make sure we protect the fruit against this fly when we have a sort of a decisions to make for the whole season it is highly recommended that you start with the highest heaviest chemicals which means the most effective chemicals as you see here infest light the intervention in the second slide we started with low efficacy product and still fly populations sustained they did not disappear however in the third picture when you see here that a highly effective product was used it knocked the fly populations down and then you can use low efficacy in mid-efficacy product for the rest of the season to maintain that low level of populations which will not cause economic damage all of the products obviously when we talk about insecticides they do have harmful effects against beneficial insects so we need to keep that in mind even organic products do have negative effects on beneficial insects so we need to always keep that in mind one thing we can do to minimize the non-target effects of those insecticides is to spray in the Dawn and dusk times when flies ought active in the field themselves and we can basically expose flies to direct spray residues rather than spraying other times of the day when they are not active and then relying on their exposure to the residues which may not be as strong and may not be as effective so recommending it is recommended to spray during the Dawn and Dusk and the other benefit is that less beneficials are active during that time of the day so that helps in in many ways now moving on to behavioral control we have tested uh several behavioral control strategies the goal is to develop attract and kill approach where we have an attractant that can attract flies away from the fruit and then we have a toxic and mixed in it to kill them by the residues so this one technology that was developed by iska Technologies company based in California we tested several years ago and it did show some promise as you see it reduced this it was 87 less fruit infestation in than when this particular product was applied which has an attractive mix with insecticide and in this case insecticide was spinocid now the same company is developing these new formulations which are even more attractive however the difference is that these new Farm TD formulation and or formulations TD in particular is the most effective and this is just by itself attracted by itself is stored as adjuvant it is currently in EPA for a constitution to be commercially available hopefully this will be available later this season or next year this is sold as ajimand itself and farmers will need to mix insecticide of their choice with it to use this as a check and kill too other chemicals can be protect was developed in Europe and several Labs we tested it last year here in the U.S and we found that even half weight of interest can give us just as much activity as Fuller rate of interest so or even more in slightly more in some cases so this is really good product again currently in EPA to be considered for registration as agile and hopefully this will be available later this season or next year cultural controls again these are really important the goal here is to modify the environment to make the environment less attractive for uh stability swd flies are very sensitive to temperature and humidity they don't like high temperatures and they don't like dry conditions so what can we do to change modify the environment so yes in this case we can do okay so let me go through one by one by one first starting with exclusion that's one cultural practice or a strategy that you can use to cover the fruit production area or berries themselves keep the flies out this is one foolproof technology that can use but it is expensive so uh however some Farmers I have just talked to they have repurposed their currently used materials in part and in part they got new materials to make it more economically feasible but once you have it installed it does work as a foolproof technology to control swd to keep the flies away irrigation is you know most of the fruit production does need the irrigation system if you have the option use uh drip irrigation as compared to the overhead irrigation because drip irrigation creates less humidity in the canopy zones and that is that helps keep the stability populations lower in the fruiting Zone mulching is another way to control swd the principle here is that when flies larvae are fully fed inside the fruit they come out of the fruit and drop to the ground to pupate if we have a black beet mat or some Mulch on the ground to prevent a lottery from getting into the ground to prepare it they will get toasted and killed on the surface that again has been very useful way to control the stability flies in high pressure situations pruning is is the other way to change the canopy environment when you we do heavy pruning but it does it allows more light through the canopy into the fruiting Zone where flies are likely to you know spend most of the time to infest food and it does reduce humidity a little bit so that slight increase in temperature and decrease in humidity does lower fly population in that zone to help with swd control Harvest frequency is again important if you leave ripe fruit out in the field for too long that is very attractive to flies and flies will have more opportunity to infest so remove the ripe fruit as frequently as possible that will minimize the risk of fruit infestation by swd sanitation is again extremely important because ripe rotten fruit on the ground is attractive for flies they will be attracted from others surroundings into the field if they have more of that rotten fruit so keep the field clean any ripe over ripe rotten fruit it must be removed as soon as possible and you can do deal with it two ways number one is either seal them in the plastic bags and leave them for two to three days indirect Sun that will kill all flies or you can bury them at least two feet in in the ground to make sure that larvae or pupils or our flies don't come out again to become source of infestation last part is the post Harvest once you have harvested fruit and you suspect there may be infestation is always possible to to control that or kill those larvae if you can store the fruit at 36 degrees Fahrenheit for up to three days this will allow more time for you to market the fruit and also it will kill majority of the Larry inside inside the fruit all right so when we talk about strawberries pollinators are extremely important and there is a very little information about uh wild pollinators in particular which are extremely important for pollination in strawberries so let's double yield of course and quality is increased with insect pollination and what do you mean by pollinator Health in in this system which is currently one of the major issues and we need to take care of it couple things that can be you know part of this whole concept of you know how do we look at pollinator Health pesticide use of course can negatively affect pollinator Health if B densities do how many bees do we have in the field and Landscape what other sources uh these bees can feed off of and then that contributes to overall population and their activity in the field that leads to pollination these are the key or general pollinators that we anticipate the first one is enemies of course and the other ones are wild bees that play the key role in pollination and Southeastern systems so what we look for what uh is this kind of a diagram shows you the red more red means more negative for uh pesticide if you know more negative for bees in lighter color means better system so first on the top left corner is you know more pesticides and the top down lower right corner is the least amount of pesticides so that is the best one for for bees bottom line uh when you know they see an IPM is all about making decisions and when to take management action is based on understanding of which pests are present and if we need to identify those pests how many of those pests are there what type of injury are they causing and how that injury translates into yield loss we need to know that by active sampling active monitoring of those pests and once we know that then we can get into making that management decisions then what management tools are available and what we can select to make sure that we will control the past but also we will not harm the beneficial insects or other beneficial organisms in the field that is extremely important component of Pest Management so now when it comes to management there is a really important resource that I mentioned earlier is the southeast smallfield Consortium guide that is developed and updated every year for the whole region it's available at smallfruit.org if you go online smallfruit.org you can find this guide and and other small fruit guides as well this is just the last excuse me this is the last page of that guide which shows you know in a one page all chemicals that are available and which pests they are effective and what is the level of efficacy here you know AE shows Excellence BG very good G good and and those things are denoted foreign of the last a few of last pages at the end of the guide so I highly recommend you using this guide as a resource for strawberry Pest Management it has really valuable information another resource that was recently relatively recently created is in my IPM app it does have information about strawberry diseases and pests as well so you can download that available for both both apple and other devices Android devices foreign Don Johnson and say uncle Lahiri Who provided some of the slides that I shared and also my lab my team and sponsors that has sponsored our research with that I'll take any questions if we have some time",
