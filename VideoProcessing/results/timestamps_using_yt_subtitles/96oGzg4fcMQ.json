  "text": "a five member technical team from Guyana has successfully completed the infrastructure for the national agriculture Innovation and Technology Center marking a significant step forward in St Lucia's drive for agricultural modernization the project a product of the collaboration between the government of St Lucia and Guyana for agricultural technology adaptation and Innovation features two tunnel green houses equipped with a nutrient fi technique hydroponic system the initiative is set to revolutionize St Lucia's agricultural sector by integrating sustainable practices with cuttingedge hydroponic technology the system offers a more efficient approach to farming particularly beneficial in combating challenges posed by the dry season Hydroponics reduces water and fertilizer waste while ensuring optimal crop growth making it an environment Al friendly and cost effective alternative to traditional farming the hydroponic system an ideal solution for Farmers with limited land space allowing them to maximize productivity in small areas with the completion of this facility the Ministry of Agriculture now has a powerful tool to educate and showcase to the local farmers the tangible benefits of Hydroponics farming lead Hydroponics technician khil Benjamin emphasize that this Innovation is expected to improve food security and economic resilience within the agricultural sector by using less water and fertilizer while yielding higher productivity yeah so today uh we finished the project uh the two B tunnel houses are completed and with the hydroponic system um this will be of a great benefit to the St Luan people right um hydroponic it's uh not a new technique it has been over here for 2 to 3,000 years it's a very old technology but uh what we did was we refined the the the the the technique and we did it it's called Precision agriculture because what we're doing we're not wasting fertilizers right we're not wasting fertilizers we're not wasting water especially right in in a system like if you have a say we have an area like as we have 32 by 100 ft you may use about 450 gallons of water per day right on on your crop uh with this hydroponic system you use that actually every 3 weeks right so so when we go we know we have have dry periods to go into so that can be a great benefit for the farmers so you can always have no short of production through that system the two tunnel green houses have a combined capacity of growing over 2,600 plants with one Greenhouse supporting 1,425 plants and the other 1,200 this advancement signifies a transformative step towards modern technology driven farming in St Lua fostering increased efficiency sustainability and resilience in food production this what we have here today is a nft system so n is called a nutrient film technique which just means a tin film of water is running on the root of the plant right the system is a recyclable system so it's goes from uh 30 ft in length and it comes back up again on a pump right we also have a AirStone to create oxygen for the system so everything is in place every parameters is in place and checked we also have filters on the system to to ensure that there's no uh clogging or anything that happens to the system so you need to maintain that as well right so we have a today we have the school kids so we want to do an introduction with them too as well the successful completion of this initiative highlights the strengthening of agricultural ties between St Lucia and Guyana showcasing Regional cooporation in the adoption of advanced farming Technologies as the fa faity becomes operational it is expected to serve as a model for the future of agriculture in the region empowering local farmers with Innovative techniques to enhance food production and sustainability from the Ministry of Agriculture Fisheries food security andural development I am Zar fix reporting",
