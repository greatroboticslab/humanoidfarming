welcome back to this channel in this

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,040
video we'll be discussing a very

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,679
important subject that I know several

4
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,599
Pak Farmers have on their mind in

5
00:00:08,679 --> 00:00:12,960
turning Pig farmers and that's the

6
00:00:10,599 --> 00:00:16,560
question around uh what kind of size of

7
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,520
pig should I start my farm with so uh

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,080
one of the first question is should you

9
00:00:18,520 --> 00:00:23,800
start with uh a pregnant Pig like the

10
00:00:21,080 --> 00:00:27,480
one you see in the video right

11
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:29,080
now or should you start with the winners

12
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:30,720
like what you can see right on the

13
00:00:29,080 --> 00:00:34,200
screen

14
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:35,559
also should you start with the Growers

15
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,559
like what you can see right on your

16
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,200
screen also and last but not the least

17
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:44,000
should you start with a matured but not

18
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,719
yet pregnant Pig so in this video we'll

19
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,680

20
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,600
sizes of pigs and which one is best for

each time we upload a new video all

33
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:24,680
right let's delve right into it so what

34
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:28,560
size of pig should I start with as a new

35
00:01:24,680 --> 00:01:32,000
farmer as a an aspiring Peak farmer what

36
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:36,520
kind of size should I start my farm with

37
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:39,759
now the pregnant pigs are are the most

38
00:01:36,520 --> 00:01:42,079
expensive size of pigs amongst all that

39
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,720
I showed you not withstanding what

40
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,439
breeds you are dealing with the pregnant

41
00:01:43,720 --> 00:01:48,159
pigs are always the most expensive and

42
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,840
you can agree with me why they will be

43
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,119
the most expensive obviously because

44
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:56,200
every um seller understands that you

45
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:58,039
getting them means you getting not just

46
00:01:56,200 --> 00:02:00,799
the mother alone but you're getting

47
00:01:58,039 --> 00:02:05,159
additional number of piglets alongside

48
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:08,239
so and it could vary from 5 to 15 so

49
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:10,679
therefore every farmer selling to you a

50
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,879
pregnant Pig will obviously sell at

51
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,879
premium because everybody understands

52
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,080
that you are getting a jackpot by

53
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:21,560
getting a pregnant pigs a pregnant Pig

54
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:23,040
so why should I start or why should I

55
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,840
not start with a pregnant pigs that's

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:29,599
what we'll be answering in this

57
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,480
video all right let's do it mat quickly

58
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:34,160
uh

59
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:36,080
a pregnant Pig of a pregnant tn70 brid

60
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:37,680
will cost about

61
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,879
400,000

62
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:47,519
Nara okay 400,000 NRA

63
00:02:41,879 --> 00:02:53,640
now the grower pigs will cost about

64
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:57,879
80,000 to 120,000 n and the the winners

65
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:59,239
May range from there about 50 to 100,000

66
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:01,680
depending on wherever you're getting

67
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:05,599
them from so we will use the cost of

68
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:08,760
50,000 or 60,000 for a winner 100,000

69
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,760
for a gr for the

70
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:17,599
grower and 400,000 for a pregnant Peak a

71
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:20,159
pregnant s now look at the mat getting

72
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:24,799
one pregnant Pig will get you there

73
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:28,480
about four to five grower pigs or about

74
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:31,879
six to eight winner picks now what do

75
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,439
you feel is best for you do you think it

76
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:34,640
will be good for you to have I

77
00:03:33,439 --> 00:03:36,760
understand there's an argument you will

78
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,920
bring up in your mind but do you think

79
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:40,799
it would be good to get just one

80
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,159
pregnant Pig what

81
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:48,159
400,000 or four or five gr pigs what the

82
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:51,439
same amount or 6 to eight winner pigs

83
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:53,680
wor the same amount now many of you will

84
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:54,840
say okay it's not just one pregnant Pig

85
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:56,760
I know that's the argument going on in

86
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,760
your mind you still have about probably

87
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:02,560
like 10 or 15 or there about of piglets

88
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:06,040
in the home so why should I not get a

89
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,239
pregnant Pig well the point is when you

90
00:04:06,040 --> 00:04:10,000
look at risk the risk of this whole

91
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:12,079
thing because as a good businessman you

92
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:15,000
need to know how to mitigate your your

93
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,479
risk risk is extremely important when

94
00:04:15,000 --> 00:04:18,680
entering any business you need to

95
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,239
consider uh mitigating your risk

96
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:24,759
whenever you getting into any form of

97
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:29,720
business so if you're going to dump 400k

98
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:34,400
on one hanima with the risk of Poss

99
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:37,240
possibly losing its piglet because you

100
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:40,039
don't have 100% assurance that you're

101
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:43,520
going to get those piglets due to

102
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:45,479
several reasons uh it's possible you you

103
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:47,240
have issues while transporting them down

104
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:49,560
here because you need to understand that

105
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:52,120
one of the main key thing when bringing

106
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,240
a pregnant pig is for you to be very

107
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:57,680
sure you are going to get them safely

108
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,919
into your farm because the if the road

109
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,759
is Bumpy if the road is uh rough if you

110
00:05:00,919 --> 00:05:06,880
have adverse weather condition you could

111
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:10,919
lose your piglet your s your pregnant s

112
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:13,759
could have bought or have miscarriage so

113
00:05:10,919 --> 00:05:16,120
obviously those are some some happenings

114
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:19,400
that can happen while getting a pregnant

115
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:23,199
Pig now imagine you get a pregnant Pig

116
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:24,600
and that happens that's obviously a very

117
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,919
big loss because in the head you back to

118
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:28,639
square one more like you're getting back

119
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:32,160
to just having a normal pig without it

120
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,600
piglet but imagine you get a grow P or

121
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,960
rather imagine you get five gr PS now of

122
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,240
course the same risk still exist while

123
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:43,720
getting uh a grow Peak because it

124
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,680
doesn't mean you can be 100% assur that

125
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:47,960
you're going to raise the entire five

126
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,560
also to maturity but you know the risk

127
00:05:47,960 --> 00:05:52,600
is mitigated because if anything happens

128
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:55,080
to one or two of them you still have

129
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,440
about three left or two left so you see

130
00:05:55,080 --> 00:05:58,080
you have been able succeeded in

131
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:00,000
mitigating your risk because you need to

132
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:03,080
understand that no matter how much you

133
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,240
try there are certain situations that

134
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:07,440
could happen that are

135
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,520
unpredictable uh no matter how much you

136
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:12,560
do your due diligence so you want to

137
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:15,880
make sure you are on the saf side when

138
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,599
planning your business when getting into

139
00:06:15,880 --> 00:06:21,319
your uh into Peak farming now imagine

140
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:24,160
you get five of these you raise them up

141
00:06:21,319 --> 00:06:26,199
you learn so much while raising them up

142
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,680
you are able to grow as a farmer you're

143
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,160
able to understand the Integrity of peak

144
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:32,479
farming that

145
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:36,039
wiser that's better that's much more

146
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,160
advisable than getting a pregnant s

147
00:06:36,039 --> 00:06:39,880
getting a pregnant s obviously if you're

148
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,560
a new Peak farmer you need to understand

149
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:42,680
that some sever question you should ask

150
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:45,680
yourself is do you have the experience

151
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,880
of managing a pregnant s to ensure it

152
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,360
deliver safely you know all it takes all

153
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,680
you need to do when it's delivering all

154
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,599
you all the maintenance all the

155
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:59,000
management practices that you have to do

156
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:02,039
the feeding all the nutrient it needs to

157
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:05,400
heat do you know all those things now

158
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:08,240
also when the pig deliver do you know

159
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,960
everything you need to do in terms of

160
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,759
managing the piglets to ensure that they

161
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:13,599
grow to maturity that you don't lose any

162
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:17,400
one of them just so you know I have a

163
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:20,639
friend of mine that lost his entire

164
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,919
piglet he had a pregnant sell the

165
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:26,440
pregnant sell delivered to gave bir to

166
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,120
ha piglet fine piglet fine fine piglet

167
00:07:26,440 --> 00:07:30,080
but you know the piglet the the the the

168
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:34,120
mother

169
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:35,840
could not give the piglet milk and so

170
00:07:34,120 --> 00:07:37,720
the pigs were okay the piglets they came

171
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:41,360
out fine they were okay but the piglet

172
00:07:37,720 --> 00:07:43,759
could not suck so in no time at all just

173
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:46,800
in few days he lost everything he first

174
00:07:43,759 --> 00:07:51,879
of all lost about maybe seven of them uh

175
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:54,000
maybe six in Con in in six went quite

176
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:55,720
early then maybe two survived to some

177
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,960
point then later on one went later on

178
00:07:55,720 --> 00:08:01,120
the last one went in short he lost the

179
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:03,479
entire hit that's exactly the reason why

180
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,720
I would not advise you to get a pregnant

181
00:08:03,479 --> 00:08:07,639
Pig now doesn't mean I did not say you

182
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:09,759
should not get a pregnant pig let me

183
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:10,919
state that very clearly I just mean of

184
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,520
course if you have the experience or if

185
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,360
you have an expact and you are very sure

186
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,599
of being able to handle it rightly

187
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,599
obviously you can go for a pregnant PE

188
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:23,879
but if this is not the case if you are

189
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:25,960
so new to Pi farming and you have no

190
00:08:23,879 --> 00:08:27,400
idea of what it takes to ensure like

191
00:08:25,960 --> 00:08:28,840
what drug are you supposed to give a

192
00:08:27,400 --> 00:08:31,080
pregnant PE we'll be doing a video on

193
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:33,760
that very soon what are the care you're

194
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:36,000
supposed to give uh to a pregnant Pig

195
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:37,200
what when a pig deliver what's the drug

196
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:38,719
what's the medication you're supposed to

197
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:41,360
give it what's the medication you're

198
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:43,360
supposed to give to the piglet you see

199
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:47,000
if you don't give your piglet a certain

200
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:49,120
drug after 3 days about if you wait till

201
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:50,560
over 3 days you you if you're not

202
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,760
careful you will lose all the piglets

203
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,839
even though it gives the mother gives it

204
00:08:52,760 --> 00:08:57,640
milk and let's imagine you even have a

205
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:58,880
mother that gives that doesn't have milk

206
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:02,360
what's the injection you're supposed to

207
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:05,360
give to to a pregnan a a sorry a a s I

208
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:07,240
just delivered that is not having enough

209
00:09:05,360 --> 00:09:09,160
meal what are you supposed to do in that

210
00:09:07,240 --> 00:09:11,640
situation so imagine you get a pregnant

211
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:14,279
pee and this that situation happens what

212
00:09:11,640 --> 00:09:16,360
do you do that's exactly the reason why

213
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,399
I may not advise you to get a pregnant

214
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:20,079
PE but of course I said again if you are

215
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:22,480
very much experienced and you are sure

216
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:24,920
of what you're doing it looks like a

217
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:27,240
very good way to start because obviously

218
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,079
if you get two pregnant pigs or five

219
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,320
pregnant pigs you are getting about 50

220
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,839
piglets or thereabout from just a few

221
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:36,760
weeks and in just one delivery so

222
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:38,920
obviously that looks very catchy but

223
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:41,519
again that could be very risky if you

224
00:09:38,920 --> 00:09:43,440
don't have the right experience you

225
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,079
could lose all your piglets and you

226
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,320
could lose your s that friend of mine

227
00:09:47,079 --> 00:09:51,920
that I talked about almost lost the S I

228
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:53,959
knew all the things we had to do to

229
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,200
rescue that s to rescue the south from

230
00:09:53,959 --> 00:09:58,959
North D he has already even lost hope

231
00:09:56,200 --> 00:10:03,279
already and was considering uh calling

232
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:05,320
the buyer to to to get it but uh we did

233
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,480
some certain things on you know give it

234
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:08,959
some certain things some things I'll

235
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:12,800
will probably be talking about in

236
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:15,040
subsequent videos and the S survive

237
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,000
eventually so that's one of the reasons

238
00:10:15,040 --> 00:10:22,120
why I would advise you to go for the

239
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:23,880
winners or for the grower PS this now

240
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:26,560
for instance if speaks you see on the

241
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,720
screen now if you get them on your farm

242
00:10:26,560 --> 00:10:30,160
in no time at all in some few months

243
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,920
they would

244
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:35,040
be delivering they would take in and

245
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:37,360
give you your piglet and you would be

246
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,800
able to have the experience the

247
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:41,360
experience from feeding the experience

248
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:44,000
from management The Experience from how

249
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:46,040
bi security everything you need to do uh

250
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,160
to ensure a profitable pig farm you will

251
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:49,839
be able to grow into the experience

252
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,519
because I don't care how much you read

253
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:53,480
some books or how much you research the

254
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:55,959
internet there are certain things you

255
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:58,560
will experience only when you get into

256
00:10:55,959 --> 00:11:00,760
big farming it's not it cannot be bought

257
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:02,600
anywhere what it's different from

258
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:04,240
watching a video than getting your hands

259
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:06,519
on this thing when you get into it you

260
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,360
will understand that it's so different

261
00:11:06,519 --> 00:11:10,680
it's different from watching a video and

262
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:12,440
seeing how you know some of the time the

263
00:11:10,680 --> 00:11:14,680
videos are just a summary of what goes

264
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:16,720
on on the farm you don't have an idea of

265
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:19,360
the challenges and certain things that

266
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,839
has to be done in order to ensure that

267
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,680
the farm is profitable until you get

268
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:27,200
your hands on this thing you may never

269
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:29,399
know so I will advise you to start with

270
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,160
uh little risk that means you mitigate

271
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,959
your risk rather than going for

272
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:36,200
something that could just quench your

273
00:11:33,959 --> 00:11:39,480
entire money like your entire 400k could

274
00:11:36,200 --> 00:11:42,079
just go or whatever amount you spend in

275
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:46,160
getting your pregnan out could just go

276
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:48,079
like that from just uh a mistake or an

277
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,079
ignorance you didn't know something

278
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,320
something happened and from there before

279
00:11:50,079 --> 00:11:54,279
you count five your pigs are go your

280
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:58,160
your pregnant pig is go is gone but

281
00:11:54,279 --> 00:12:00,320
imagine you had a a gr P or the winner

282
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:02,279
if you got five of them six of them or

283
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:04,720
or eight of them or even 10 of them if

284
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:07,480
anything happens to one you can learn

285
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,320
from that one and use it to uh you know

286
00:12:07,480 --> 00:12:12,079
to correct yourself on the other on the

287
00:12:09,320 --> 00:12:14,600
other one and then also if you for you

288
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,120
to understand the right drugs to use you

289
00:12:14,600 --> 00:12:19,480
know the the how do you inject your paks

290
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:23,560
how do you care for them how do you feed

291
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:26,120
them all those things come by experience

292
00:12:23,560 --> 00:12:28,240
so please from the the summary of this

293
00:12:26,120 --> 00:12:30,199
video is whatever you want to do make

294
00:12:28,240 --> 00:12:31,920
sure you're very sure of all these

295
00:12:30,199 --> 00:12:34,160
informations around all these things so

296
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:36,760
you don't go into something that uh

297
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,320
makes you uh regret getting into Pak

298
00:12:36,760 --> 00:12:40,680
farming so before you make the decision

299
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,120
on what size of pie to start with

300
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:44,519
consider all these things I've have said

301
00:12:42,120 --> 00:12:46,800
the experience the cost and every other

302
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:49,880
thing that you may need to know and

303
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:52,040
ensure that you are you are positioned

304
00:12:49,880 --> 00:12:53,920
right for whatever decision you make so

305
00:12:52,040 --> 00:12:55,680
