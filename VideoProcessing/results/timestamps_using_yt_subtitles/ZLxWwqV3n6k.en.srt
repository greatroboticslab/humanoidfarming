00:00:00,400 --> 00:00:15,010
[Music]

2
00:00:18,650 --> 00:00:26,400
okaywe I want to thank Sarah for giving

3
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,050
us the grant to do this project a little

4
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,269
bit of a spoiler alert a lot of it

5
00:00:28,050 --> 00:00:31,170
wasn't really successful but the whole

6
00:00:30,269 --> 00:00:35,700
thing is meant to be a learning

7
00:00:31,170 --> 00:00:38,730
experience right education is you know

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,870
the last word in ser so this has been an

9
00:00:38,730 --> 00:00:44,430
education for us so Rebecca and I were

10
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:46,649
on her family land she's a fourth

11
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,309
generation farmer we're located in North

12
00:00:46,649 --> 00:00:53,460
Kansas City about 45 minutes this is our

13
00:00:50,309 --> 00:00:55,260
farm down there in the left corner we

14
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:57,690
hit that's where our house is we have a

15
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,660
barn with our packing room our certified

16
00:00:57,690 --> 00:01:03,420
kitchen we have a greenhouse passive

17
00:01:00,660 --> 00:01:06,630
solar we have one high tunnel we have

18
00:01:03,420 --> 00:01:08,850
two movable chicken coops we have a

19
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:10,890
irrigation pond there with solar panels

20
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:17,000
so this is kind of some of the details

21
00:01:10,890 --> 00:01:19,500
we met on a CSA farm back in 2001

22
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:22,409
Rebecca wanted to come back to her

23
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,090
family farm and to you know improve it

24
00:01:22,409 --> 00:01:29,369
and to keep it from just becoming

25
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:32,189
another lot of houses and so the CSA was

26
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:34,439
really the model for us at our peak we

27
00:01:32,189 --> 00:01:42,570
were up around 100 close to 150 members

28
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:44,310
for 31 weeks we have about five acres

29
00:01:42,570 --> 00:01:45,990
five and a half that's actually able to

30
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,060
be cultivated over about a twenty acre

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:49,979
area that we grow on this is some of our

32
00:01:48,060 --> 00:01:52,200
vegetables you know we have a

33
00:01:49,979 --> 00:01:58,649
diversified operation which is really

34
00:01:52,200 --> 00:02:00,689
nice model you know was been talking

35
00:01:58,649 --> 00:02:03,540
diversity is always good and for us you

36
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,040
know we get to eat a diverse diet

37
00:02:03,540 --> 00:02:07,950
because we're growing all these things

38
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
our CSA models participatory our members

39
00:02:07,950 --> 00:02:11,520
come out and they help with the harvest

40
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,530
we have what's called a core group they

41
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:15,780
help to manage the CSA

42
00:02:13,530 --> 00:02:19,580
that's the model of the farm where we

43
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:22,830
met and it's just a great way to get oh

44
00:02:19,580 --> 00:02:24,090
you know the host of generations even

45
00:02:22,830 --> 00:02:27,120
from one family to come out and

46
00:02:24,090 --> 00:02:28,980
participate in agriculture this is our

47
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,760
certified kitchen that we had built and

48
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:35,370
right after it was completed 2016 we

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:40,310
decided to kind of diversify our farming

50
00:02:35,370 --> 00:02:42,120
operations and to have a firm a team

51
00:02:40,310 --> 00:02:43,740
that's so that would mean we need to

52
00:02:42,120 --> 00:02:45,210
grow a lot of brassicas so we wanted to

53
00:02:43,740 --> 00:02:46,920
look at different ways to raise the

54
00:02:45,210 --> 00:02:52,080
brassicas without having to do a lot of

55
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:55,770
mulching we're in our it's like our

56
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,780
second year of of fermenting we like to

57
00:02:55,770 --> 00:03:01,530
say we have a kitchen without a stove in

58
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:04,760
there it was a good model you know it's

59
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:07,080
a low-energy type of value-added product

60
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,220
you chop everything at room temperature

61
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:09,570
the fermenting happens at room

62
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:13,110
temperature and then you store the

63
00:03:09,570 --> 00:03:15,240
product back in the cooler until you

64
00:03:13,110 --> 00:03:17,459
need to jar it so we already have a

65
00:03:15,240 --> 00:03:19,860
cooler and we only we didn't need to

66
00:03:17,459 --> 00:03:23,670
have a stove or heat stuff up and we're

67
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:25,650
on the shelves on a a handful of retail

68
00:03:23,670 --> 00:03:27,239
outlets in Kansas City area as well as

69
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:31,970
selling to our members in a farmers

70
00:03:27,239 --> 00:03:31,970
market so our fertility plan

71
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:37,530
everybody that's talking about soil it's

72
00:03:34,470 --> 00:03:40,200
gonna be pretty much the same thing and

73
00:03:37,530 --> 00:03:43,080
and like Jeff was saying you really need

74
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:46,049
commitment so we make sure we feed the

75
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,660
soil a diverse and balanced meal we try

76
00:03:46,049 --> 00:03:53,150
to amend every bet each year with some

77
00:03:48,660 --> 00:03:57,989
type of cover crop or we buy compost

78
00:03:53,150 --> 00:04:01,920
mineral Edition we now have two Lane

79
00:03:57,989 --> 00:04:03,360
flocks of about 7080 hens and they we

80
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:05,010
fence in the yard fifty by a hundred

81
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,330
feet you know we can leave them in an

82
00:04:05,010 --> 00:04:10,560
area for about two months and moving

83
00:04:06,330 --> 00:04:12,810
them around the farm so we can fertilize

84
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,290
a good acre of land just with our our

85
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:19,130
hens and we do like I said a lot of

86
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,340
cover cropping you know we

87
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:26,540
this is like our Sudan grass and cow

88
00:04:22,340 --> 00:04:28,880
peas or crota larrya so we have a flail

89
00:04:26,540 --> 00:04:31,580
mower normally what we would do is we

90
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,650
would grow it we chop it down we have

91
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:35,720
it's called a spade er it kind of digs

92
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:38,180
that digs it in it helps it doesn't

93
00:04:35,720 --> 00:04:42,920
create the hard pan that like a tiller

94
00:04:38,180 --> 00:04:45,700
will so we call this our chewing step as

95
00:04:42,920 --> 00:04:48,200
we've been doing more and more farming

96
00:04:45,700 --> 00:04:50,480
we're trying to do this less you know

97
00:04:48,200 --> 00:04:52,280
not use the Spade or just to tilt stuff

98
00:04:50,480 --> 00:04:55,670
in but to mainly use it as a way to

99
00:04:52,280 --> 00:05:00,530
incorporate cover crops we incorporate

100
00:04:55,670 --> 00:05:02,270
them we also do a lot of hey this is

101
00:05:00,530 --> 00:05:05,510
compost from a company called Missouri

102
00:05:02,270 --> 00:05:07,250
organics they're local Kansas City

103
00:05:05,510 --> 00:05:11,290
company that's been growing and we were

104
00:05:07,250 --> 00:05:14,960
able to get truckloads of compost

105
00:05:11,290 --> 00:05:18,950
sometimes we'll use a you know a dry bag

106
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:20,600
fertilizer we use for trel it's kind of

107
00:05:18,950 --> 00:05:22,910
handy at times if you want to add some

108
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,380
fertility to a bed and it's kind of been

109
00:05:22,910 --> 00:05:27,710
out of the rotation or you haven't been

110
00:05:24,380 --> 00:05:29,750
able to time things properly and then

111
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,740
here's our our hens we really like it

112
00:05:29,750 --> 00:05:36,110
when we can raise a cover crop and put

113
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,480
the hens in and have them to eat the

114
00:05:36,110 --> 00:05:40,580
cover crop or we run them through our

115
00:05:38,480 --> 00:05:42,890
high tunnel in the spring after we're

116
00:05:40,580 --> 00:05:45,170
done with our extended season of the

117
00:05:42,890 --> 00:05:47,240
previous fall and spring they've been a

118
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:48,920
great way to improve the fertility and

119
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:51,320
the high tunnel you know they provide a

120
00:05:48,920 --> 00:05:53,600
lot of phosphorus don't the things you

121
00:05:51,320 --> 00:05:55,100
learn then realize what it is is that

122
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,560
they don't really process phosphorus

123
00:05:55,100 --> 00:06:00,530
sowing the phosphorus and the feed kind

124
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:02,080
of goes through them and it's where we

125
00:06:00,530 --> 00:06:06,230
are that's one of them are limiting

126
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:08,660
nutrients is the phosphorus and so this

127
00:06:06,230 --> 00:06:11,120
has been our our results just using our

128
00:06:08,660 --> 00:06:15,200
farming practices as you can see I've

129
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,730
been farming for 16 years I used to be

130
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,600
an environmental engineer I used to do a

131
00:06:16,730 --> 00:06:23,480
lot of environmental sampling and

132
00:06:20,600 --> 00:06:27,919
analysis and treatment system design and

133
00:06:23,480 --> 00:06:29,990
monitoring so around 2004 I believe it

134
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:31,719
was I decided well I should maybe plot

135
00:06:29,990 --> 00:06:35,499
our soil organic matter

136
00:06:31,719 --> 00:06:37,449
and it's been really instructive it

137
00:06:35,499 --> 00:06:40,299
shows that it bounced around between 2

138
00:06:37,449 --> 00:06:41,649
and 3 percent for a long time and it

139
00:06:40,299 --> 00:06:44,049
actually kind of went down and then

140
00:06:41,649 --> 00:06:48,279
after 2008 it's it's been trending up

141
00:06:44,049 --> 00:06:50,529
and one of the things we're trying to do

142
00:06:48,279 --> 00:06:54,729
in promoting our CSA and promoting art

143
00:06:50,529 --> 00:06:56,499
ferments is to talk about that how the

144
00:06:54,729 --> 00:06:57,519
value that's in that and I think next

145
00:06:56,499 --> 00:07:00,579
door they're talking about how to

146
00:06:57,519 --> 00:07:03,519
quantify that value and I think that's

147
00:07:00,579 --> 00:07:07,509
important so for the cover crop project

148
00:07:03,519 --> 00:07:11,949
the idea was rather than mulching as you

149
00:07:07,509 --> 00:07:13,300
saw doing on our brassicas we were able

150
00:07:11,949 --> 00:07:15,579
to we've been able to raise cover crops

151
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,119
historically raise cover crops roll it

152
00:07:15,579 --> 00:07:23,349
down and and plant into that so we were

153
00:07:19,119 --> 00:07:26,639
going to do that for cabbage cauliflower

154
00:07:23,349 --> 00:07:33,429
and broccoli and then we also have

155
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:36,189
tomatoes that we wanted to do so we

156
00:07:33,429 --> 00:07:40,539
started out in 2014 actually 2013 is

157
00:07:36,189 --> 00:07:46,449
when we started by raising our crops the

158
00:07:40,539 --> 00:07:47,949
rive edge we dr. Ron Morris from

159
00:07:46,449 --> 00:07:53,099
Virginia Tech he was our Technical

160
00:07:47,949 --> 00:07:55,779
Assistant and so he helped us kind of

161
00:07:53,099 --> 00:07:58,869
helped us build the no-till planting aid

162
00:07:55,779 --> 00:08:00,399
and he gave us some advice so that's

163
00:07:58,869 --> 00:08:02,619
just a flail mower where we turned off

164
00:08:00,399 --> 00:08:04,149
the blades you know it's got a big heavy

165
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:06,639
roller on it we're able to roll down the

166
00:08:04,149 --> 00:08:07,659
cover crops so this was like step 1

167
00:08:06,639 --> 00:08:10,089
everything looked like it's gonna be

168
00:08:07,659 --> 00:08:12,489
perfect it rolled down really well was a

169
00:08:10,089 --> 00:08:14,610
real good mixer Ryan betch we were

170
00:08:12,489 --> 00:08:17,949
really happy

171
00:08:14,610 --> 00:08:20,199
the vet came back but you know that was

172
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,569
fine we didn't care too much we mowed it

173
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:26,949
down did that a couple times and it kind

174
00:08:22,569 --> 00:08:31,089
of disappeared and but then the weeds

175
00:08:26,949 --> 00:08:33,219
started so bindweed was a big issue

176
00:08:31,089 --> 00:08:34,870
where we were doing this turns out we

177
00:08:33,219 --> 00:08:36,459
had a heavy fine weed problem we had

178
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:39,039
some other areas where we were doing it

179
00:08:36,459 --> 00:08:41,969
you know we're all in the grassland area

180
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,620
in the middle of you know June July

181
00:08:41,969 --> 00:08:45,130
every seed of grass is going to start to

182
00:08:44,620 --> 00:08:49,120
come up

183
00:08:45,130 --> 00:08:50,920
no matter what and so in talking to dr.

184
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:53,080
Morris you know we said you really need

185
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:54,700
a stale seed bed if you're gonna do this

186
00:08:53,080 --> 00:08:56,230
you know his work was down at Virginia

187
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:58,540
Tech kind of up in the mountains and

188
00:08:56,230 --> 00:09:03,610
it's really a whole different soil

189
00:08:58,540 --> 00:09:04,840
growing season and what's favored so all

190
00:09:03,610 --> 00:09:06,730
this was happening but we're thinking oh

191
00:09:04,840 --> 00:09:11,470
this is a test we need to kind of see

192
00:09:06,730 --> 00:09:13,060
what we can do so first thing we did is

193
00:09:11,470 --> 00:09:17,620
we took our farm throughout there and we

194
00:09:13,060 --> 00:09:21,040
weeded and kept track and I think it

195
00:09:17,620 --> 00:09:24,190
took you know eight hours worth of work

196
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:27,010
just to do like this 40 foot stretch of

197
00:09:24,190 --> 00:09:28,930
two beds so you know got that on the

198
00:09:27,010 --> 00:09:32,160
record it's like okay hand weeding isn't

199
00:09:28,930 --> 00:09:34,150
gonna work and then we tried organic

200
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:40,180
herbicides we're not certified organic

201
00:09:34,150 --> 00:09:42,220
but we follow NOP and we tried two

202
00:09:40,180 --> 00:09:47,890
different types of basically kind of you

203
00:09:42,220 --> 00:09:49,330
know citric acid type insecticide but

204
00:09:47,890 --> 00:09:52,390
all it does it just burns off the top

205
00:09:49,330 --> 00:09:55,300
growth that did nothing to stop the

206
00:09:52,390 --> 00:09:59,320
growth so we kind of had to abandon that

207
00:09:55,300 --> 00:10:01,570
we tried it again we'll talk about other

208
00:09:59,320 --> 00:10:02,980
attempts but basically you know we can

209
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:04,240
get good stands to cover crops and

210
00:10:02,980 --> 00:10:08,710
they're easily rolled and crimped with

211
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:11,140
the flail mower the the weed pressure

212
00:10:08,710 --> 00:10:16,150
and June and July it was significant

213
00:10:11,140 --> 00:10:17,800
so our cover crops are rolled down like

214
00:10:16,150 --> 00:10:20,110
the maybe the last week of May or so

215
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:22,060
somewhere in there that's kind of

216
00:10:20,110 --> 00:10:23,980
typical from where we are we're not

217
00:10:22,060 --> 00:10:25,390
going to plan our brassicas we don't

218
00:10:23,980 --> 00:10:28,750
start them in the greenhouse until the

219
00:10:25,390 --> 00:10:30,940
first second week of June so that whole

220
00:10:28,750 --> 00:10:33,160
time period that rolled down is just

221
00:10:30,940 --> 00:10:36,700
sitting there and that's when all this

222
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:38,440
weed pressure comes up I'll show you

223
00:10:36,700 --> 00:10:41,110
though what times where it's hard to do

224
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:43,030
and like I said the weeding and the

225
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,940
organic herbicides really weren't a

226
00:10:43,030 --> 00:10:48,730
solution so the next step was this

227
00:10:45,940 --> 00:10:52,680
no-till planting aid so you roll it down

228
00:10:48,730 --> 00:10:56,830
any ideas you can just cut furrows in

229
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:58,120
the rolled down cover crop and then we

230
00:10:56,830 --> 00:10:58,480
were going to bring our transplant or

231
00:10:58,120 --> 00:11:00,730
through

232
00:10:58,480 --> 00:11:04,780
and have it spaced at that same two foot

233
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:05,950
spacing and plant so at the beginning I

234
00:11:04,780 --> 00:11:07,720
thought all we had this whole piece of

235
00:11:05,950 --> 00:11:09,610
equipment laying around from what I can

236
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:11,710
tell it all be we'll just be able to

237
00:11:09,610 --> 00:11:15,280
kind of see redo this well doctor Moore

238
00:11:11,710 --> 00:11:17,770
said those Coulter's were way too small

239
00:11:15,280 --> 00:11:19,060
once I put that toolbar on our tractor I

240
00:11:17,770 --> 00:11:21,190
realized it was a diamond pattern

241
00:11:19,060 --> 00:11:22,960
instead of a square pattern and I had

242
00:11:21,190 --> 00:11:25,840
bought a square clamp and so there were

243
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:28,810
all sorts of you know just farm hack

244
00:11:25,840 --> 00:11:29,860
complications I hooked it all up to kind

245
00:11:28,810 --> 00:11:32,380
of see how it might look

246
00:11:29,860 --> 00:11:35,290
and the Coulter was so big that it

247
00:11:32,380 --> 00:11:37,690
wasn't long enough so we had to do we

248
00:11:35,290 --> 00:11:40,990
did an extension to put the fertilizer

249
00:11:37,690 --> 00:11:43,410
shoe on and then that still wasn't good

250
00:11:40,990 --> 00:11:45,810
enough so then we ended up putting a

251
00:11:43,410 --> 00:11:48,280
getting another piece of steel that

252
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:52,810
extended the length of it so we could

253
00:11:48,280 --> 00:11:57,340
separate all those and so in the end we

254
00:11:52,810 --> 00:11:58,690
got it built and it worked well see it's

255
00:11:57,340 --> 00:12:02,980
a little tilt II there we got an old

256
00:11:58,690 --> 00:12:08,320
tractor but it would drag through and it

257
00:12:02,980 --> 00:12:10,870
would cut the furrow you'd have to watch

258
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,670
about stuff kind of get snagged you know

259
00:12:10,870 --> 00:12:15,070
we kind of rigged that up so there'd be

260
00:12:12,670 --> 00:12:18,850
some things we would trim it up trim off

261
00:12:15,070 --> 00:12:20,980
to keep from snagging and you can kind

262
00:12:18,850 --> 00:12:22,930
of see there it the shovel went in there

263
00:12:20,980 --> 00:12:25,150
the fertilizer knife they cut a nice

264
00:12:22,930 --> 00:12:26,980
furrow so if we were going to come

265
00:12:25,150 --> 00:12:31,180
through with transplants we would have

266
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:33,970
been able to do that so the no-till

267
00:12:31,180 --> 00:12:37,840
planting aid farm hacking was fine

268
00:12:33,970 --> 00:12:39,310
rather than buying a new one but if I

269
00:12:37,840 --> 00:12:41,920
had to do it again we'd probably go to

270
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:43,540
equipment supplier and and try and

271
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,480
fabricate it from new pieces of

272
00:12:43,540 --> 00:12:49,300
equipment it was really a great tool we

273
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:51,100
may use it in the future too if there's

274
00:12:49,300 --> 00:12:54,220
a really wet period and we can't get in

275
00:12:51,100 --> 00:12:56,110
somewhere and we don't want to do any

276
00:12:54,220 --> 00:12:57,480
serious tilling we could always kind of

277
00:12:56,110 --> 00:13:02,680
maybe drag that through to create a

278
00:12:57,480 --> 00:13:05,710
planting row we held a couple feet field

279
00:13:02,680 --> 00:13:07,570
days - it was tough - time doing the

280
00:13:05,710 --> 00:13:08,390
roller crimping with our field days but

281
00:13:07,570 --> 00:13:10,790
we're

282
00:13:08,390 --> 00:13:13,040
able to to show some equipment at the

283
00:13:10,790 --> 00:13:20,900
same time that we were having our field

284
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:22,970
days so 2015 was a seriously wet year so

285
00:13:20,900 --> 00:13:28,820
I know if you can read all this but from

286
00:13:22,970 --> 00:13:31,310
from May 5th until July 20th we had 35

287
00:13:28,820 --> 00:13:34,070
inches of rain over 74 days and so it

288
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:35,530
was just consistent I mean it was really

289
00:13:34,070 --> 00:13:37,550
bad

290
00:13:35,530 --> 00:13:40,700
that was the year I decided I was gonna

291
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:43,070
start collecting records so I was kind

292
00:13:40,700 --> 00:13:44,830
of glad I did that it really showed this

293
00:13:43,070 --> 00:13:47,450
that's a year's worth the rain for us

294
00:13:44,830 --> 00:13:48,950
we even had a hailstorm one point

295
00:13:47,450 --> 00:13:52,070
through there right there in strawberry

296
00:13:48,950 --> 00:13:54,440
season and they just Rebecca said it

297
00:13:52,070 --> 00:13:58,870
looks like little fairy punches on the

298
00:13:54,440 --> 00:14:02,120
strawberries so kind of destroyed that

299
00:13:58,870 --> 00:14:06,940
you know we were trying to to still do

300
00:14:02,120 --> 00:14:09,590
things you know probably shouldn't have

301
00:14:06,940 --> 00:14:11,630
this is an example of this area had been

302
00:14:09,590 --> 00:14:13,460
I don't think we even really had a

303
00:14:11,630 --> 00:14:15,620
chance to roll it down or I might have

304
00:14:13,460 --> 00:14:18,800
tried rolling that down and it was just

305
00:14:15,620 --> 00:14:20,660
a mess so talk to Joan is like okay this

306
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:26,060
year we're you know we're extending the

307
00:14:20,660 --> 00:14:28,340
whole project and that was fine so 2015

308
00:14:26,060 --> 00:14:29,990
was kind of off the books another part

309
00:14:28,340 --> 00:14:35,000
of it was the cedar evaluation we were

310
00:14:29,990 --> 00:14:36,080
just gonna buy a regular grain drill you

311
00:14:35,000 --> 00:14:37,430
know it's one of those things everybody

312
00:14:36,080 --> 00:14:39,290
so you can buy them they're all over the

313
00:14:37,430 --> 00:14:43,600
place and I went looking over and over

314
00:14:39,290 --> 00:14:47,450
over again so we have like six foot beds

315
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:49,760
six foot wide beds and you know I really

316
00:14:47,450 --> 00:14:52,400
wanted like you know get eight rows in

317
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:54,440
that six foot eight nine rows and have

318
00:14:52,400 --> 00:14:56,960
something that's designed to put grain

319
00:14:54,440 --> 00:15:02,120
seed in the ground and just could not

320
00:14:56,960 --> 00:15:06,050
find anything anywhere used that size so

321
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:09,160
we decided to do was to buy some

322
00:15:06,050 --> 00:15:12,230
vegetables Cedars and so these are for

323
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:15,350
coal you know Planet jr. vegetable

324
00:15:12,230 --> 00:15:18,470
Cedars bought a new tool bar hook that

325
00:15:15,350 --> 00:15:21,660
up the idea was well we'll do like two

326
00:15:18,470 --> 00:15:25,150
passes and that'll be our cover crop

327
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:26,800
so what we also do and normally we've

328
00:15:25,150 --> 00:15:29,620
always done in the past is to use a

329
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:32,080
broadcast seeder and then come through

330
00:15:29,620 --> 00:15:35,230
with a Harrow we would mix our cover

331
00:15:32,080 --> 00:15:38,050
crops ahead of time and knock you late

332
00:15:35,230 --> 00:15:39,820
the legumes and then add the grain mix

333
00:15:38,050 --> 00:15:44,440
it up and then just spread it all

334
00:15:39,820 --> 00:15:47,350
together just one thing is an aside you

335
00:15:44,440 --> 00:15:49,840
know talking about sticking with game

336
00:15:47,350 --> 00:15:53,500
plans Jeff was and improving we have a

337
00:15:49,840 --> 00:15:58,390
Seine on our farm which is from a dr.

338
00:15:53,500 --> 00:16:01,060
Deming who was a quality engineer and

339
00:15:58,390 --> 00:16:02,770
proved constantly and forever so we're

340
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:03,370
always doing that and was at a

341
00:16:02,770 --> 00:16:07,510
conference

342
00:16:03,370 --> 00:16:09,430
the PFI conference and you're talking

343
00:16:07,510 --> 00:16:13,050
about with cover crops having a more

344
00:16:09,430 --> 00:16:17,200
diverse mix you know if you have up to 8

345
00:16:13,050 --> 00:16:18,970
see different seeds you may actually be

346
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:20,860
able to plant and have stuff to even

347
00:16:18,970 --> 00:16:23,560
come up in the grout in a drought just

348
00:16:20,860 --> 00:16:25,480
the that diversity creates this

349
00:16:23,560 --> 00:16:27,310
communication that we still haven't

350
00:16:25,480 --> 00:16:29,950
learned about that makes the whole grow

351
00:16:27,310 --> 00:16:31,450
better so we like doing a mix of cover

352
00:16:29,950 --> 00:16:36,850
crop seeds you know it's pretty much

353
00:16:31,450 --> 00:16:39,690
legumes and grain Harrow it in so with

354
00:16:36,850 --> 00:16:43,060
the grass seed there with the the

355
00:16:39,690 --> 00:16:44,830
vegetable Cedars at first I was looking

356
00:16:43,060 --> 00:16:46,840
at putting just an individual like

357
00:16:44,830 --> 00:16:49,210
that's a vet seed and one hopper and

358
00:16:46,840 --> 00:16:51,370
then something else in the other then

359
00:16:49,210 --> 00:16:53,410
I'd have to calibrate them all because

360
00:16:51,370 --> 00:16:57,340
the vegetable planters don't say you

361
00:16:53,410 --> 00:16:59,260
know vet seed and in the end I decided

362
00:16:57,340 --> 00:17:01,810
to mix them so we could just okay

363
00:16:59,260 --> 00:17:05,050
everything's at hole 32 and and that's a

364
00:17:01,810 --> 00:17:07,569
good mix for for all this that's a

365
00:17:05,050 --> 00:17:10,720
little crooked but you can see we've

366
00:17:07,569 --> 00:17:13,150
pulled it across and you know we'd get

367
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:17,709
decent I kind of wanted a little few

368
00:17:13,150 --> 00:17:20,620
more rows and stuff grew

369
00:17:17,709 --> 00:17:22,030
halfway decent and then later I went and

370
00:17:20,620 --> 00:17:24,189
just decided to ship them all the one

371
00:17:22,030 --> 00:17:25,600
side and go up and back because they

372
00:17:24,189 --> 00:17:27,189
were kind of going on top of each other

373
00:17:25,600 --> 00:17:32,230
they weren't quite staggering the way I

374
00:17:27,189 --> 00:17:34,630
want and with cover crops you know it's

375
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:35,260
difficult to sometimes get them in at

376
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:37,540
the same time

377
00:17:35,260 --> 00:17:38,950
you've kind of stale seed bedded so that

378
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:43,450
was one of the big things that we need

379
00:17:38,950 --> 00:17:47,549
to work on more and more so this is

380
00:17:43,450 --> 00:17:51,010
Sudan grass and cow peas we did a couple

381
00:17:47,549 --> 00:17:54,190
as part of the study was to compare

382
00:17:51,010 --> 00:17:55,840
these two seeding methods and you know

383
00:17:54,190 --> 00:18:01,510
weigh the cover crop and see which works

384
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:07,090
better so broadcast seeding versus the

385
00:18:01,510 --> 00:18:09,880
cold so in June that was more with a

386
00:18:07,090 --> 00:18:14,799
spring cover crop I believe would have

387
00:18:09,880 --> 00:18:18,130
been like oats and peas the the cedar

388
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:20,710
did better 13 percent but then the the

389
00:18:18,130 --> 00:18:22,270
when it was done in the summer we

390
00:18:20,710 --> 00:18:24,240
actually better with the broadcast and I

391
00:18:22,270 --> 00:18:26,590
think the reason for that is because

392
00:18:24,240 --> 00:18:29,200
part of the broadcast seeding is a

393
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:31,030
harrowing to put the seeds into the

394
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:32,110
ground so depending on your timing of

395
00:18:31,030 --> 00:18:35,290
one you were able to get in there and

396
00:18:32,110 --> 00:18:38,320
cultivate that kind of last Harrow I

397
00:18:35,290 --> 00:18:41,740
think helped with keeping the weed

398
00:18:38,320 --> 00:18:44,650
pressure down so we haven't used the

399
00:18:41,740 --> 00:18:47,020
coal anymore but we got a new full-time

400
00:18:44,650 --> 00:18:50,590
farmer somebody's worked with us before

401
00:18:47,020 --> 00:18:52,480
and so we may go back to trying to use

402
00:18:50,590 --> 00:18:57,160
the tractor to do more of our seating

403
00:18:52,480 --> 00:19:00,580
because a consistent cover crop is is

404
00:18:57,160 --> 00:19:02,110
one of the things that we try to work

405
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,880
with like last year didn't rain at all

406
00:19:02,110 --> 00:19:06,220
and if we didn't maybe he had better

407
00:19:03,880 --> 00:19:07,990
seed to soil contact somehow we might

408
00:19:06,220 --> 00:19:12,520
have had better germination of our cover

409
00:19:07,990 --> 00:19:16,179
crops there's just some more pictures of

410
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:17,770
the cover crops so this was one where it

411
00:19:16,179 --> 00:19:21,669
worked well you can see that's cow peas

412
00:19:17,770 --> 00:19:23,320
and Sudan grass so it's something to

413
00:19:21,669 --> 00:19:24,730
still consider you may have other pieces

414
00:19:23,320 --> 00:19:30,610
of equipment that you can seed your

415
00:19:24,730 --> 00:19:31,960
cover crops with on your farm so makes a

416
00:19:30,610 --> 00:19:35,530
conclusions you can use a vegetable

417
00:19:31,960 --> 00:19:39,460
cedar I would blend seeds and just have

418
00:19:35,530 --> 00:19:41,770
one seed hole or whatever your equipment

419
00:19:39,460 --> 00:19:43,990
uses

420
00:19:41,770 --> 00:19:48,280
I couldn't quite get everything evenly

421
00:19:43,990 --> 00:19:51,970
spaced and then the harrowing isn't

422
00:19:48,280 --> 00:19:55,809
necessarily a bad thing to do so then in

423
00:19:51,970 --> 00:19:58,870
2016 we tried it again and you can see

424
00:19:55,809 --> 00:20:02,200
what came up was mainly vets you know we

425
00:19:58,870 --> 00:20:03,820
we seeded this in the fall of 2015 and

426
00:20:02,200 --> 00:20:06,370
for some reason we've had this happen

427
00:20:03,820 --> 00:20:09,850
before the ride doesn't come up that

428
00:20:06,370 --> 00:20:13,470
well but the vet does but we still

429
00:20:09,850 --> 00:20:13,470
worked with it and rolled stuff down

430
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:17,559
that's the flail mower we are able to

431
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:20,080
get that as part of the project it's

432
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:23,860
really nice to have a it's a good

433
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:25,720
quality Alamo and we had some of the

434
00:20:23,860 --> 00:20:27,580
same problems with buying weed so it was

435
00:20:25,720 --> 00:20:33,910
kind of abandon it these are the same

436
00:20:27,580 --> 00:20:40,150
conclusions as the other one and then we

437
00:20:33,910 --> 00:20:42,070
just still had a lot of rain issues so

438
00:20:40,150 --> 00:20:47,140
one of the other things we were trying

439
00:20:42,070 --> 00:20:48,940
our no-till for tomatoes so with our CSA

440
00:20:47,140 --> 00:20:54,280
we raised Tomatoes

441
00:20:48,940 --> 00:20:56,290
and then we like to have a second

442
00:20:54,280 --> 00:20:59,920
planting just because the first one kind

443
00:20:56,290 --> 00:21:03,640
of dies off and doesn't do as well so we

444
00:20:59,920 --> 00:21:06,309
always have we have some summer heat set

445
00:21:03,640 --> 00:21:09,490
tomatoes that we use Bella roses a

446
00:21:06,309 --> 00:21:11,770
variety they're a caged tomato also a

447
00:21:09,490 --> 00:21:14,230
determinate so we don't have to do all

448
00:21:11,770 --> 00:21:16,420
the stringing you can raise them plant

449
00:21:14,230 --> 00:21:18,370
them put a cage around it and you know

450
00:21:16,420 --> 00:21:20,920
necessarily forget them but it there

451
00:21:18,370 --> 00:21:23,350
they take less care and they're more

452
00:21:20,920 --> 00:21:24,700
like a grocery store type tomato but if

453
00:21:23,350 --> 00:21:27,040
you leave them on the vine long enough

454
00:21:24,700 --> 00:21:29,140
and let them ripen you know using

455
00:21:27,040 --> 00:21:31,630
organic growing methods and improving

456
00:21:29,140 --> 00:21:34,350
your soil they do have some some good

457
00:21:31,630 --> 00:21:37,679
flavor and texture

458
00:21:34,350 --> 00:21:37,679
so the

459
00:21:38,360 --> 00:21:49,100
so that whole area had Ryan betch and so

460
00:21:45,830 --> 00:21:50,960
we rolled rolled stuff down and on one

461
00:21:49,100 --> 00:21:55,130
bed for the tomatoes and then the other

462
00:21:50,960 --> 00:21:57,230
one we tilled the cover crop in like we

463
00:21:55,130 --> 00:21:59,870
would normally do we tried to do that

464
00:21:57,230 --> 00:22:01,279
ahead of time and let it rest and then

465
00:21:59,870 --> 00:22:02,720
we came through and we planted our

466
00:22:01,279 --> 00:22:05,960
Tomatoes everything's at two foot

467
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:09,049
spacing I think somewhere in here I see

468
00:22:05,960 --> 00:22:12,409
I think we had close to 50 Tomatoes per

469
00:22:09,049 --> 00:22:15,279
row and so the one on the Left we we get

470
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:17,870
a lot of hay we're able to get hay from

471
00:22:15,279 --> 00:22:21,470
other farmland that Rebecca's hormones

472
00:22:17,870 --> 00:22:24,350
her family owns hey mulch and then on

473
00:22:21,470 --> 00:22:25,730
the right we did I believe somewhere in

474
00:22:24,350 --> 00:22:27,799
there at some point do a little bit of

475
00:22:25,730 --> 00:22:31,899
extra mulching but that's the role down

476
00:22:27,799 --> 00:22:34,730
cover crops so you can see that the

477
00:22:31,899 --> 00:22:36,260
mulch ones on the left they're a little

478
00:22:34,730 --> 00:22:40,429
more robust than the ones on the right

479
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:42,529
and over time you know we didn't do a

480
00:22:40,429 --> 00:22:44,659
lot of weeding on the ones on the right

481
00:22:42,529 --> 00:22:46,940
we did some just to keep him away from

482
00:22:44,659 --> 00:22:50,990
the plants but the idea was to try and

483
00:22:46,940 --> 00:22:57,159
have it be a minimal care system and you

484
00:22:50,990 --> 00:23:00,080
can see that the ones that were in the

485
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:03,380
cover crop that was turned under did

486
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:05,830
better they they had nice fruit set and

487
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:10,179
so here's the data so with the hay mulch

488
00:23:05,830 --> 00:23:15,019
we had almost three times the amount of

489
00:23:10,179 --> 00:23:17,090
tomatoes that we were able to harvest so

490
00:23:15,019 --> 00:23:19,010
their old print crops you know they help

491
00:23:17,090 --> 00:23:20,360
keep the weeds down during the early

492
00:23:19,010 --> 00:23:23,059
growth stage everything kind of got

493
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:25,970
established pretty well but the baited

494
00:23:23,059 --> 00:23:30,830
and hay mulch beds gave us three times a

495
00:23:25,970 --> 00:23:33,620
year and you know thought with us is

496
00:23:30,830 --> 00:23:35,840
that maybe in a more mature no-till

497
00:23:33,620 --> 00:23:39,470
system that you might get better

498
00:23:35,840 --> 00:23:42,279
nutrient uptake but we feel that by by

499
00:23:39,470 --> 00:23:44,360
spading in you know all that veg and

500
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,760
everything and kind of getting more of a

501
00:23:44,360 --> 00:23:48,440
mixing of the nutrients we're able to

502
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,950
get more nutrients released and that's

503
00:23:48,440 --> 00:23:57,860
part of the reason why we got higher

504
00:23:51,950 --> 00:24:01,039
yield and so here's some costs that were

505
00:23:57,860 --> 00:24:03,380
associated with the project

506
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:04,880
so the no-till planting aid you know

507
00:24:03,380 --> 00:24:08,289
doing kind of the farm hack and the

508
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:12,350
likes cost us about eleven hundred bucks

509
00:24:08,289 --> 00:24:14,269
imagine if you did it from scratch it

510
00:24:12,350 --> 00:24:16,789
might be you know closer to two thousand

511
00:24:14,269 --> 00:24:20,240
dollars and then we got a use flail

512
00:24:16,789 --> 00:24:22,190
mower and then we had to we had about

513
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:23,990
four thousand dollars figured in for the

514
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,539
cedar and I thought I'd be able to find

515
00:24:23,990 --> 00:24:28,120
a used grain drill but we couldn't so

516
00:24:26,539 --> 00:24:30,460
that's what that took and that was all

517
00:24:28,120 --> 00:24:38,630
brand-new equipment

518
00:24:30,460 --> 00:24:40,850
and yeah I think that got plenty of time

519
00:24:38,630 --> 00:24:46,240
here for questions then that's pretty

520
00:24:40,850 --> 00:24:48,550
much it so you have some questions

521
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:51,760
the question is how much horsepower it

522
00:24:48,550 --> 00:24:53,830
took to pull the no-till planting aid so

523
00:24:51,760 --> 00:24:57,940
that tractor that we were using

524
00:24:53,830 --> 00:25:01,540
that's Rebecca's grandfather's tractor

525
00:24:57,940 --> 00:25:09,370
it's a farm all 504 and it has about 45

526
00:25:01,540 --> 00:25:12,280
horse and it so you know at least

527
00:25:09,370 --> 00:25:15,760
probably 20 horsepower per per Coulter

528
00:25:12,280 --> 00:25:17,380
and fertilizer shoe because it did you

529
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:19,390
know you could definitely feel some drag

530
00:25:17,380 --> 00:25:25,030
on it but I don't know what the limits

531
00:25:19,390 --> 00:25:26,290
were so question was will we use a sweep

532
00:25:25,030 --> 00:25:31,390
to maybe

533
00:25:26,290 --> 00:25:32,890
undercut all the mulch and no we hadn't

534
00:25:31,390 --> 00:25:36,280
really thought about that I think the

535
00:25:32,890 --> 00:25:42,430
idea of the rolling down is that

536
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:45,070
everything's kind of all attached and so

537
00:25:42,430 --> 00:25:47,650
we didn't really look at that we've been

538
00:25:45,070 --> 00:25:50,470
using sweeps more and more on the farm

539
00:25:47,650 --> 00:25:51,940
to reduce our tillage like we'll have

540
00:25:50,470 --> 00:25:53,920
our chickens run through an area and

541
00:25:51,940 --> 00:25:57,580
there will be next to nothing there but

542
00:25:53,920 --> 00:25:59,170
you can't quite plant so we will try and

543
00:25:57,580 --> 00:26:00,930
use a sweep just to break up the first

544
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:04,390
inch so it's kind of more of a shallow

545
00:26:00,930 --> 00:26:08,590
tillage and then I don't know if I have

546
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:12,250
a picture of it here so we have a Alice

547
00:26:08,590 --> 00:26:15,990
this was another field day in

548
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:19,540
allis-chalmers G tractor it's a 1948

549
00:26:15,990 --> 00:26:21,700
model tractor and there was another

550
00:26:19,540 --> 00:26:26,950
Sarah project long time ago Ron Colson

551
00:26:21,700 --> 00:26:30,520
in New York he electrified it so we have

552
00:26:26,950 --> 00:26:36,550
48 volts on that tractor it's basically

553
00:26:30,520 --> 00:26:37,870
a golf cart size engine and we use that

554
00:26:36,550 --> 00:26:39,520
all the time you can see those are

555
00:26:37,870 --> 00:26:41,890
that's a cultivator on it right now the

556
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:46,330
the G is belly-mounted implements so you

557
00:26:41,890 --> 00:26:48,280
can see what's going on one of the other

558
00:26:46,330 --> 00:26:51,580
things we do a lot with it as we use

559
00:26:48,280 --> 00:26:53,590
discs on this a lot so we have a tool

560
00:26:51,580 --> 00:26:55,810
bar that goes right out to the edge of

561
00:26:53,590 --> 00:26:57,130
where the wheels are and they're discs

562
00:26:55,810 --> 00:26:59,530
and so we'll drive along and it will

563
00:26:57,130 --> 00:27:00,039
basically make a raised bed now we have

564
00:26:59,530 --> 00:27:04,600
a lot of heavy

565
00:27:00,039 --> 00:27:07,809
soils we have less soil but then clay

566
00:27:04,600 --> 00:27:09,729
and glacial till not far underneath so

567
00:27:07,809 --> 00:27:13,659
when we get those heavy rains if we

568
00:27:09,729 --> 00:27:16,090
don't have our beds shaped all that

569
00:27:13,659 --> 00:27:18,009
water will just smear everything over

570
00:27:16,090 --> 00:27:20,350
but if the beds are shaped well water

571
00:27:18,009 --> 00:27:21,580
will at least run down the gutters and

572
00:27:20,350 --> 00:27:26,409
stay in the gutters and we'll have some

573
00:27:21,580 --> 00:27:28,629
nice fluffy soil on top so we are like I

574
00:27:26,409 --> 00:27:30,840
said we're moving as much as we can

575
00:27:28,629 --> 00:27:34,179
towards a more reduced tillage and

576
00:27:30,840 --> 00:27:40,259
mainly using our tillage to incorporate

577
00:27:34,179 --> 00:27:40,259
cover crop yeah

578
00:27:57,040 --> 00:28:04,450
we moved it to different areas yeah you

579
00:28:00,980 --> 00:28:06,530
know the one year with all the water

580
00:28:04,450 --> 00:28:11,680
some of the areas we were trying we

581
00:28:06,530 --> 00:28:14,000
weren't even able to do that with but

582
00:28:11,680 --> 00:28:16,250
yeah we have friends in Kansas City

583
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:20,210
other farmers that do no-till and they

584
00:28:16,250 --> 00:28:22,370
have a lot of a lot of luck but they've

585
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:24,410
actually gone to hogs right now to kind

586
00:28:22,370 --> 00:28:27,110
of go across their land because they

587
00:28:24,410 --> 00:28:29,690
have a perennial weed pressure so

588
00:28:27,110 --> 00:28:31,130
no-till doesn't have that issue but if

589
00:28:29,690 --> 00:28:33,710
you're able to build up you know more of

590
00:28:31,130 --> 00:28:35,990
the mycorrhizal fungi in the soil there

591
00:28:33,710 --> 00:28:38,890
may be a lot of the benefit to really

592
00:28:35,990 --> 00:28:42,530
doing as little disturbance as possible

593
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:48,410
what was the planting death depth in the

594
00:28:42,530 --> 00:28:51,200
cedar with the those earth ways they

595
00:28:48,410 --> 00:28:52,850
pretty much just have this like shoe

596
00:28:51,200 --> 00:28:54,470
that hangs down and we didn't really

597
00:28:52,850 --> 00:28:58,880
adjust it too much as long as it would

598
00:28:54,470 --> 00:29:00,710
kind of cut an opening and then be able

599
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,570
to drop the seed down the chute and then

600
00:29:00,710 --> 00:29:07,250
it has a little follower that that

601
00:29:02,570 --> 00:29:09,050
covers it up so yeah you know it

602
00:29:07,250 --> 00:29:11,180
probably wasn't much more than an inch

603
00:29:09,050 --> 00:29:12,590
to an inch and a half you know because

604
00:29:11,180 --> 00:29:16,990
it's a vegetable cedar so you're really

605
00:29:12,590 --> 00:29:16,990
not going too deep

606
00:29:18,620 --> 00:29:25,640
coal planet jr. yeah uh-huh yeah well

607
00:29:23,870 --> 00:29:27,470
you know we've kind of seen to that

608
00:29:25,640 --> 00:29:30,530
you know those they're not no-till cedar

609
00:29:27,470 --> 00:29:33,170
they don't really drill seed and so I

610
00:29:30,530 --> 00:29:35,030
may act different if we if you were

611
00:29:33,170 --> 00:29:37,220
doing an area that had been faded not

612
00:29:35,030 --> 00:29:40,670
too long ago you know so dependent on

613
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:44,540
the the the soil condition what had

614
00:29:40,670 --> 00:29:47,990
previously happened question was what

615
00:29:44,540 --> 00:29:52,670
it's our cropping system so yeah we had

616
00:29:47,990 --> 00:29:56,480
150 members CSA at this time to

617
00:29:52,670 --> 00:30:00,560
full-time apprentices and sometimes we

618
00:29:56,480 --> 00:30:04,430
have other farm help too and so we were

619
00:30:00,560 --> 00:30:06,680
farming close to five acres and with

620
00:30:04,430 --> 00:30:08,000
that every year we would try and like

621
00:30:06,680 --> 00:30:09,590
when the broccoli came out of production

622
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:11,980
in the spring make sure we put down

623
00:30:09,590 --> 00:30:16,760
cover crops of a summer cover crop and

624
00:30:11,980 --> 00:30:19,820
then right now we scaled back so we're

625
00:30:16,760 --> 00:30:24,320
only growing about two to two and a half

626
00:30:19,820 --> 00:30:26,210
acres and in 2017 we cook took what we

627
00:30:24,320 --> 00:30:29,330
call sabbatical year we cut our CSA in

628
00:30:26,210 --> 00:30:30,770
half it's only every other week so we

629
00:30:29,330 --> 00:30:32,930
could concentrate on our fermenting

630
00:30:30,770 --> 00:30:34,760
business our business model the idea is

631
00:30:32,930 --> 00:30:36,860
to get back to the point where we're

632
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:38,600
making the same amount of income half of

633
00:30:36,860 --> 00:30:42,140
its the CSA and then half of it is the

634
00:30:38,600 --> 00:30:44,390
ferments and we spend a lot of 2017

635
00:30:42,140 --> 00:30:47,690
trying to stay all seed bed a lot of our

636
00:30:44,390 --> 00:30:50,000
beds so we had some areas we left them

637
00:30:47,690 --> 00:30:53,000
open and then we'd go through with like

638
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:55,280
a sweep cultivator and and try and knock

639
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:58,280
down the weeds just as they were we're

640
00:30:55,280 --> 00:31:02,810
starting and then depending on the time

641
00:30:58,280 --> 00:31:07,250
of year so our spring will plant either

642
00:31:02,810 --> 00:31:07,730
oats or barley with with field peas in

643
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:10,550
the summer

644
00:31:07,730 --> 00:31:14,530
it tends to be sorghum Sudan grass with

645
00:31:10,550 --> 00:31:17,300
crota larrya or cow peas and then in the

646
00:31:14,530 --> 00:31:20,090
overwintering we do the ryebeck but then

647
00:31:17,300 --> 00:31:23,510
sometimes we also do oats and peas near

648
00:31:20,090 --> 00:31:26,780
the end of summer to have a cover crop

649
00:31:23,510 --> 00:31:31,160
that we can maybe turn in before winter

650
00:31:26,780 --> 00:31:32,330
so one thing we do just because we're

651
00:31:31,160 --> 00:31:34,700
vegetable farmers and you

652
00:31:32,330 --> 00:31:37,429
kind of a prepared bed in the spring to

653
00:31:34,700 --> 00:31:41,510
plant in will do a certain amount of

654
00:31:37,429 --> 00:31:43,610
cover cropping in the fall and then turn

655
00:31:41,510 --> 00:31:47,419
that under kind of as late as we can

656
00:31:43,610 --> 00:31:49,730
maybe the first week of October or

657
00:31:47,419 --> 00:31:52,159
spring and or fall cover cropping and so

658
00:31:49,730 --> 00:31:54,740
to actually be won't have anything

659
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,110
planted in it over the summer or over

660
00:31:54,740 --> 00:31:59,480
the winter but then all that free

661
00:31:57,110 --> 00:32:01,130
stalling makes it like a perfect soil to

662
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:02,840
plant in in the spring we got to see

663
00:32:01,130 --> 00:32:08,210
beets and carrots or do different things

664
00:32:02,840 --> 00:32:11,779
so and as you can see our organic matter

665
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:14,210
has gone up so we feel that it shows

666
00:32:11,779 --> 00:32:17,960
that it's a it's a productive system as

667
00:32:14,210 --> 00:32:20,840
far as the soil and I say we try and

668
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,760
turn it under right before winter so

669
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:24,919
biological activity starts but a lot of

670
00:32:22,760 --> 00:32:28,010
that biomass is still in there so that

671
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:31,029
it gets released a little bit more in

672
00:32:28,010 --> 00:32:31,029
the spring and summer

673
00:32:38,470 --> 00:32:44,890
yeah so you know it's it's a little

674
00:32:41,600 --> 00:32:46,940
inexact but it was just something more

675
00:32:44,890 --> 00:32:48,590
kind of a good-faith effort to

676
00:32:46,940 --> 00:32:50,870
demonstrate that our soil organic matter

677
00:32:48,590 --> 00:32:53,000
is going up so it's whatever samples we

678
00:32:50,870 --> 00:32:56,059
take in a year we have two different

679
00:32:53,000 --> 00:33:00,010
fields if you went back to like the

680
00:32:56,059 --> 00:33:00,010
first picture

681
00:33:06,820 --> 00:33:12,040
so the fields on the left over here

682
00:33:09,150 --> 00:33:15,070
there's what we call our home field they

683
00:33:12,040 --> 00:33:19,590
they tend to be drier in the spring and

684
00:33:15,070 --> 00:33:22,060
then we we call this our the pond field

685
00:33:19,590 --> 00:33:23,530
so we've gotten to the point where we're

686
00:33:22,060 --> 00:33:26,290
going back and forth now with soil

687
00:33:23,530 --> 00:33:28,960
samples and so that's kind of what the

688
00:33:26,290 --> 00:33:33,940
data is is just whatever we had for that

689
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:37,090
year well you know we're growing for our

690
00:33:33,940 --> 00:33:38,920
ferments and for the CSA and because I

691
00:33:37,090 --> 00:33:40,000
had one thing that I'd like to try a

692
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:44,080
little bit different with the cover

693
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,810
crops is a more diverse mix you know

694
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:50,080
it'll still be like a grain and a legume

695
00:33:45,810 --> 00:33:52,360
but maybe we'll do four types of seeds

696
00:33:50,080 --> 00:33:54,700
or five and I'm kind of looking more

697
00:33:52,360 --> 00:33:57,870
into that so they will do the croud

698
00:33:54,700 --> 00:34:00,280
alaria and the cow peas along with

699
00:33:57,870 --> 00:34:02,620
sorghum sand and grass and find some

700
00:34:00,280 --> 00:34:05,170
other warm season grain that might work

701
00:34:02,620 --> 00:34:07,620
and have like four or five different

702
00:34:05,170 --> 00:34:13,150
seeds that were planting at a time and

703
00:34:07,620 --> 00:34:14,980
just keep trying different things and

704
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:16,750
with the chickens you know I said we

705
00:34:14,980 --> 00:34:18,669
we've gone more and more to as much

706
00:34:16,750 --> 00:34:19,630
reduced tillage as we can the chickens

707
00:34:18,669 --> 00:34:22,000
have really helped because they

708
00:34:19,630 --> 00:34:23,740
basically do a lot of tilling and so we

709
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,290
can get in there and just shape beds and

710
00:34:23,740 --> 00:34:37,800
maybe just till the top inch so the more

711
00:34:26,290 --> 00:34:37,800
we can do that the better sunhemp yeah

712
00:34:38,460 --> 00:34:44,980
yeah yeah it's nice it grows really well

713
00:34:42,100 --> 00:34:47,860
you know hot and dry as long as you can

714
00:34:44,980 --> 00:34:52,150
get it to germinate question is whether

715
00:34:47,860 --> 00:34:54,220
we sell it market so we sell our

716
00:34:52,150 --> 00:34:55,660
ferments at market our vegetables we

717
00:34:54,220 --> 00:34:57,640
could only grow enough vegetables for

718
00:34:55,660 --> 00:35:00,610
our CSA based on what we know our

719
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:03,250
membership is so if we have a good year

720
00:35:00,610 --> 00:35:04,840
they might get more of something we can

721
00:35:03,250 --> 00:35:07,870
also have excess we have what's called a

722
00:35:04,840 --> 00:35:10,090
bulk list so we're we have a small farm

723
00:35:07,870 --> 00:35:12,220
central anybody familiar with that it's

724
00:35:10,090 --> 00:35:15,910
an online system it's kind of made for

725
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:18,940
CSA farms so we use that system people

726
00:35:15,910 --> 00:35:20,560
can sign up online they can keep track

727
00:35:18,940 --> 00:35:22,210
of their own account

728
00:35:20,560 --> 00:35:23,740
so you're not like trying to keep track

729
00:35:22,210 --> 00:35:26,110
or double entering information that

730
00:35:23,740 --> 00:35:27,970
people send you and then they also have

731
00:35:26,110 --> 00:35:31,360
a place where you can kind of sell

732
00:35:27,970 --> 00:35:33,190
online so if we have extra lettuce we

733
00:35:31,360 --> 00:35:34,390
can just put that up and send out an

734
00:35:33,190 --> 00:35:36,910
email it's like if you want extra

735
00:35:34,390 --> 00:35:40,060
lettuce buy it online and we'll deliver

736
00:35:36,910 --> 00:35:43,270
it to your CSA distribution and then

737
00:35:40,060 --> 00:35:44,680
there's an organic farmers market in

738
00:35:43,270 --> 00:35:46,990
Kansas City called Brookside farmers

739
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:53,440
market and so we go there every other

740
00:35:46,990 --> 00:35:55,810
week to sell the ferments so we're 45

741
00:35:53,440 --> 00:35:58,540
minutes from kind of downtown Kansas

742
00:35:55,810 --> 00:36:00,610
City which is really a really good

743
00:35:58,540 --> 00:36:04,600
distance for us being a participatory

744
00:36:00,610 --> 00:36:07,450
CSA you know a family is going to come

745
00:36:04,600 --> 00:36:09,910
out to do their work requirement farm

746
00:36:07,450 --> 00:36:11,680
work you know it's a little Drive in the

747
00:36:09,910 --> 00:36:14,200
country they're not driving two hours so

748
00:36:11,680 --> 00:36:19,690
you know we're lucky that were

749
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:22,450
peri-urban as they say we have the farms

750
00:36:19,690 --> 00:36:24,940
one pickup site we have two locations in

751
00:36:22,450 --> 00:36:27,280
the city that we drop off at we have

752
00:36:24,940 --> 00:36:32,290
what we call a core group that manages

753
00:36:27,280 --> 00:36:33,940
the CSA and then a most of the core

754
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:36,490
group members are distribution captains

755
00:36:33,940 --> 00:36:38,560
and so if there's a distribution site

756
00:36:36,490 --> 00:36:40,150
there's like five people that instead of

757
00:36:38,560 --> 00:36:42,910
coming out to the farm to work they will

758
00:36:40,150 --> 00:36:45,850
rotate and go to the distribution site

759
00:36:42,910 --> 00:36:47,950
and we'll go drop off crates they set it

760
00:36:45,850 --> 00:36:49,780
all up they break it down and make sure

761
00:36:47,950 --> 00:36:50,830
everything works well and then when we

762
00:36:49,780 --> 00:36:54,160
come back the next week

763
00:36:50,830 --> 00:36:58,470
we take the empty crates and deliver the

764
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:58,470
fresh produce so it's nice for us we

765
00:36:59,130 --> 00:37:03,220
just drive into town then you you know

766
00:37:01,210 --> 00:37:06,040
work in other errands and stuff and with

767
00:37:03,220 --> 00:37:08,200
the ferments it'll allow us to maybe do

768
00:37:06,040 --> 00:37:12,690
some drop-offs there so it helps make it

769
00:37:08,200 --> 00:37:12,690
efficient for us to to drive in

770
00:37:16,600 --> 00:37:23,440
it's been pretty good we're normally 75%

771
00:37:20,440 --> 00:37:28,810
or more we'd our renewals going on right

772
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,150
now and we only opened it up to the last

773
00:37:28,810 --> 00:37:33,460
year's members to start with and we have

774
00:37:31,150 --> 00:37:35,050
100 we're going for 100 members this

775
00:37:33,460 --> 00:37:40,330
year and I think Rebecca said we're up

776
00:37:35,050 --> 00:37:44,110
to you know 65 or so already so I think

777
00:37:40,330 --> 00:37:45,670
we'll be on track for that and since we

778
00:37:44,110 --> 00:37:47,740
went to every other week people have

779
00:37:45,670 --> 00:37:49,240
actually liked that has helped us as

780
00:37:47,740 --> 00:37:51,190
farmers we got this whole extra week

781
00:37:49,240 --> 00:37:54,160
where we can kind of concentrate on

782
00:37:51,190 --> 00:37:56,920
farming more we've worked it out so the

783
00:37:54,160 --> 00:37:58,660
harvesting isn't that big of an issue we

784
00:37:56,920 --> 00:38:00,520
have a Wednesday drop-off as our first

785
00:37:58,660 --> 00:38:03,520
for the week and a Monday is the last

786
00:38:00,520 --> 00:38:05,140
for that distribution week so there's a

787
00:38:03,520 --> 00:38:09,010
handful of days in there that we can

788
00:38:05,140 --> 00:38:11,230
kind of plan stuff we have a 12 by 24

789
00:38:09,010 --> 00:38:15,790
inch cooler that we built as part of our

790
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:18,480
fermenting project so that helps to we

791
00:38:15,790 --> 00:38:18,480
can store a lot of stuff

792
00:38:19,460 --> 00:38:50,150
