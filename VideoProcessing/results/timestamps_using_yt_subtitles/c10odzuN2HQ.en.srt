1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,710
tractor has broke down so anyway want to

2
00:00:02,840 --> 00:00:08,780
see what we got going on check out the

3
00:00:05,710 --> 00:00:08,780
[Music]

4
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:16,760
video so guys the burn pile is burned

5
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,600
down good so far we got good hot coal so

6
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:21,720
uh as soon as I get the tractor going be

7
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:25,560
real easy to get this back going and we

8
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,359
have obviously put a big Den in this but

9
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:30,039
I got no go on

10
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:33,000
that so let me tell you what happened

11
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:36,559
and it's kind of a series of events it

12
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,520
I've got two issues so first of all U

13
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:39,960
and I'm going to include this in on the

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,879
end screens when we get to the end of

15
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:45,399
this video a while back I've got a video

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:48,160
it's called I messed up and I'm

17
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:50,199
surprised I didn't that it didn't break

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,960
everything then but I'm convinced it did

19
00:00:50,199 --> 00:00:55,719
like 80% of the damage so what happened

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,480
was I and again I'll show you the video

21
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,440
when I was hooking up my grandpa I

22
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,519
accidentally just for forgot to put in

23
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:05,840
the Locking pins I did the hydraulic

24
00:01:02,519 --> 00:01:07,880
lines and anyway I just dropped off the

25
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,560
grapple it pulled all the hydraulic

26
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:13,119
lines very tight I think it did a lot of

27
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,479
damage to them but they did not rupture

28
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:17,560
so I've been working I don't know last

29
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:21,079
two weeks contined to use the grapple

30
00:01:17,560 --> 00:01:23,759
well anyway over the weekend it finally

31
00:01:21,079 --> 00:01:26,600
um it finally gave up The Ghost and I

32
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,360
had a ruper I was shooting uh as I was

33
00:01:26,600 --> 00:01:30,439
picking up this stuff and moving it over

34
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,159
to the burn pile all of a sudden I

35
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,040
started shooting a stream out of one of

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,200
the hydraulic lines about 2 or 3 ft up

37
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:39,000
in the air so I immediately shut down uh

38
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,880
went to investigate real you know I knew

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,640
immediately what was going on but I

40
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,040
disconnected the hydraulic lines cuz I

41
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:47,799
did not want to lose any more fluid and

42
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,560
lo and behold when I went to crank back

43
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:51,719
up battery was dead as a door knob even

44
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:55,240
though I had been sitting here running

45
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:57,360
it for hours so uh I know just the

46
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:00,039
battery over time this this tractor is

47
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,479
over 6 years old now and uh you know

48
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:02,880
it's time for Batteries they you see if

49
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:05,320
you get over 5 years you count your

50
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,039
blessings right so anyway guys first

51
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:09,039
thing on the list is I'm going to walk

52
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:10,599
you guys through uh putting a

53
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:13,640
replacement battery in here now I've

54
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:15,280
already pulled the battery but no uh no

55
00:02:13,640 --> 00:02:16,879
big deal for you guys not to see that

56
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,160
coming out obviously we're going to do

57
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,879
the reverse process and as we go I'll

58
00:02:19,160 --> 00:02:23,080
tell you guys a bunch of stuff I've

59
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,160
learned along the way so you know me

60
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,040
guys let's get busy all right so

61
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:31,720
obviously my tractor is a

62
00:02:28,040 --> 00:02:33,360
3032e um and on pretty much all these

63
00:02:31,720 --> 00:02:37,440
versions of tractors the battery is

64
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:41,040
located up in the front and so um this

65
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,680
right here just sets in a in a a holder

66
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,640
and it's real easy you can just lift

67
00:02:42,680 --> 00:02:46,080
this up and move this over and this

68
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,400
right here just lifts up and comes out

69
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:54,599
of the way and I'm going to set this

70
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:56,920
over to the side and the the um battery

71
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:59,519
goes right down here in the bottom and

72
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:02,319
it's got a special way that it mounts in

73
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:04,760
now now uh one thing I want to share

74
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,640
with you and you know you guys can make

75
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:09,959
decisions for yourself on how to do this

76
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,879
but this is a 22 Series battery and if

77
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:13,760
you go to like Advanced Auto now you can

78
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:15,120
see I've got this was a John Deere I

79
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,400
actually went to the Tractor place to

80
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,879
get this and I'll explain why uh first

81
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,640
of all if you go to like uh and I'm not

82
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,440
knocking the advanced Autos or the Auto

83
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,480
Zones uh they have a battery that's

84
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:28,680
pretty close to the same size but the

85
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:31,360
one thing their batteries don't have is

86
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:34,280
this little protrusion out on the side

87
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,239
with this hole indention and so you have

88
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,519
to make a decision do you want to get a

89
00:03:37,239 --> 00:03:41,959
a little bit cheaper battery that does

90
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,840
not have this and then this is what's

91
00:03:41,959 --> 00:03:47,480
used to lock the battery on the tractor

92
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,959
in place or you can do one without this

93
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,000
and you got to figure out another way to

94
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,680
strap it down and hold it into place cuz

95
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:55,480
it been up on the front of the motor and

96
00:03:52,680 --> 00:03:57,200
it is near the radiator and the uh

97
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,239
intercoolers for the for the hydraulic

98
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,319
fluid you don't want the battery moving

99
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,720
around in and bouncing in and breaking

100
00:04:01,319 --> 00:04:05,680
you know you just will have another

101
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,519
thing to get tore up so then I played

102
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:10,680
the numbers game uh the batteries at the

103
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:12,959
Advanced Auto that's in the 22 series

104
00:04:10,680 --> 00:04:15,280
are AutoZone they're all about the same

105
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,840
they were anywhere from $110 to

106
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:20,639
$115 I could get this battery which is a

107
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,000
factory replacement from John Deere and

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:27,639
this was just like 140 bucks so for 20

109
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,880
or 30 bucks more uh was it worth it to

110
00:04:27,639 --> 00:04:32,120
me it was because my time I did want to

111
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:35,000
have to take time to reinvent how to

112
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:36,919
strap this down and so uh I just went

113
00:04:35,000 --> 00:04:38,919
ahead and got it I was there it was

114
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:41,240
available and it was the exact thing I

115
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:42,840
needed so I got it you guys obviously

116
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:44,639
more welcome to make up your mind on how

117
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,680
you want to do the fix but that's the

118
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,160
reason why so anyway that's the battery

119
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,639
and now let me uh start getting things

120
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,360
laid out and I'll show you how we get

121
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:57,080
this in place and by the way while we're

122
00:04:54,360 --> 00:05:00,240
here these are the straps that hold down

123
00:04:57,080 --> 00:05:03,080
and this is why this is so important

124
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:06,360
is this strap the way it goes and let me

125
00:05:03,080 --> 00:05:09,960
get the camera here so you can see it it

126
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,240
this battery I mean this bolt sits right

127
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,639
up in that little Groove and that's

128
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,680
what's going to keep it from moving back

129
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:19,560
and forth so anyway again the decision

130
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:22,080
is Ys on how you want to play it but

131
00:05:19,560 --> 00:05:25,720
anyway let's get this in and get my girl

132
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:28,479
going all right guys so I'm just going

133
00:05:25,720 --> 00:05:30,580
to ease this on down in

134
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,039
here like

135
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:33,960
[Music]

136
00:05:32,039 --> 00:05:37,120
so

137
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,960
up and get it set in

138
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:41,600
place and make sure I'm left and right

139
00:05:39,960 --> 00:05:45,199
from where these holes

140
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:47,479
are all right and then as I was stating

141
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:48,600
there's one hole to the left one hole to

142
00:05:47,479 --> 00:05:51,199
the right and this is where the

143
00:05:48,600 --> 00:05:53,560
challenge comes in a little bit because

144
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,199
that has a nut on the back side and you

145
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,680
got to reach around so hopefully my long

146
00:05:56,199 --> 00:06:00,360
arms are long

147
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,319
enough they sure don't make this easy to

148
00:06:00,360 --> 00:06:03,920
get

149
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:07,080
to from

150
00:06:03,920 --> 00:06:09,960
[Music]

151
00:06:07,080 --> 00:06:12,720
here there we

152
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,960
go that's that

153
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:16,479
side this right here is the hard Parts

154
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,160
just trying to stretch around and get to

155
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:19,560
the

156
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,840
bolts I've got an extension on the upper

157
00:06:19,560 --> 00:06:24,560
end holding it in place and I'm screwed

158
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:27,680
that in so now I've got them started all

159
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:30,520
I've got to do is just snug them

160
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,599
up like I said this is the fun part but

161
00:06:30,520 --> 00:06:33,599
it's not too awful

162
00:06:34,340 --> 00:06:37,390
[Music]

163
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:45,199
bad all right one side done one side to

164
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:47,280
go so now you just pull up the tabs and

165
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:50,800
pull the tops

166
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:54,199
off and obviously you want to make sure

167
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,400
black to black or black to negative and

168
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,919
red to

169
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,800
positive and obviously if I was at my

170
00:06:58,919 --> 00:07:04,560
house I would have much better selection

171
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:07,240
of tools but this is called in the field

172
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:09,720
repair and you make out with what you

173
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:12,440
got so it might be a little

174
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,010
slower but we're going to get

175
00:07:12,440 --> 00:07:22,240
it so you just snug these

176
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:24,599
[Music]

177
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:28,319
up and hopefully here in a minute we're

178
00:07:24,599 --> 00:07:30,280
going to be ready to fire this bad boy

179
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:32,199
up

180
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:34,560
so if you've been watching any of my

181
00:07:32,199 --> 00:07:38,639
videos recent you know that it's

182
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:41,599
extremely dry here and uh you also know

183
