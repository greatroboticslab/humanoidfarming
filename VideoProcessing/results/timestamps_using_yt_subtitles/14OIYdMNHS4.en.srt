weather prediction environmental control

276
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:53,040
and yield prediction to start with this

277
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:54,720
kind of business first you need to

278
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:57,200
develop expertise in Precision

00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:59,440
agriculture Technologies data analytics

280
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,440
and AI applications

281
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,720
you may need a background in agriculture

282
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,680
data science or partner with experts in

283
00:10:03,720 --> 00:10:09,279
these areas learn about remote sensing

284
00:10:06,680 --> 00:10:11,040
GIS geographic information system and

285
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:13,320
machine learning models for

286
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,440
agriculture you could also hire trained

287
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,320
staff with expertise in data analysis

288
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,360
and agricultural technology or train

289
00:10:17,320 --> 00:10:23,120
your own staff similarly invest in the

290
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:25,320
necessary software tools and hardware

291
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:27,560
for instance use sensors to monitor soil

292
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:29,519
moisture or drones to capture aerial

293
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:31,320
imagery you will also need a

294
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,120
comprehensive data management system to

295
00:10:31,320 --> 00:10:36,800
store the data consider using Cloud

296
00:10:34,120 --> 00:10:38,760

vendors for access to Advanced platforms

303
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,120
without developing them from scratch

304
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:55,800
secondly identify a niche by focusing on

305
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:57,680
a specific segment such as crop

306
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,279
management soil monitoring water

307
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:01,839
conservation or pest prediction

308
00:11:00,279 --> 00:11:03,839
identifying a niche will help you

309
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,240
develop expertise and offer specialized

valuable to clients than a general

313
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:13,920
approach finally start by offering your

314

00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,560
projects to prove the value of precision

317
00:11:18,440 --> 00:11:21,959
agriculture

318
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,680
Technologies use these projects as case

319
00:11:21,959 --> 00:11:25,440
studies that demonstrate the potential

320
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:27,120
Improvement in yield and efficiency

321
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:29,920

since many farmers may be hesitant about

325
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,320
adopting new technologies develop

326
00:11:35,800 --> 00:11:40,040
training programs webinars and workshops

327
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,639
to educate potential clients on the

328
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:43,680
benefits of precision

329
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,399
agriculture similarly speak at

330
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:46,760
agriculture conferences and Industry

331
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:48,920
events to build

332
00:11:46,760 --> 00:11:51,120

projects and demonstrate cost savings

338
00:12:00,279 --> 00:12:04,839
increased yields and more efficient

339
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,240
