00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,519
well hello my name is Don tipping I'm

2
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:19,130
here at seven seeds farm which is where

3
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:22,710
we run Siskiyou seeds where we grow

4
00:00:19,130 --> 00:00:26,310
about 700 different open pollinated

5
00:00:22,710 --> 00:00:29,039
organic fruits vegetables and herbs for

6
00:00:26,310 --> 00:00:32,940
seed to distribute all over the world

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:35,489
and today I wanted to share how I start

8
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,840
tomatoes and peppers and eggplants a man

9
00:00:35,489 --> 00:00:42,840
my greenhouse it's late March in Oregon

10
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:44,399
we started on these heat mats here which

11
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:46,590
are you can get at most garden centers

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,320
and they just boost up the temperature

13
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:53,190
so because our heat mat space is limited

14
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:54,420
I like to instead of starting my

15
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:56,850
tomatoes and pots

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:00:58,320
I started in these these little furrows

17
00:00:56,850 --> 00:01:00,899
here and I'll demonstrate that in a

18
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:03,510
minute the equipment I'm using here is

19
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:05,549
we call this a 10 by 20 because it's ten

20
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:07,200
inches by 20 inches and then inside of

21
00:01:05,549 --> 00:01:10,229
here I put it one that doesn't have all

22
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,150
these holes so it can hold soil and so

23
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:14,640
you can see that's what I've got here

24
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:17,490
this is filled with potting soil that we

25
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,380
made on the farm out of compost there'll

26
00:01:17,490 --> 00:01:22,439
be a link to another video of how to

27
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,689
make potting soil in the comments but

28
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,850
pretty much it's composts and a little

29
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,270
bit of eggshells and help or you could

30
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,479
obviously by potting soil and why you

31
00:01:30,270 --> 00:01:36,150
want to start these heat-loving crops on

32
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:38,220
heat mat is because they germinate quite

33
00:01:36,150 --> 00:01:39,390
poorly in cool temperatures and right

34
00:01:38,220 --> 00:01:42,509
now it's probably about 50 degrees

35
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,549
outside and these seeds one about 70 to

36
00:01:42,509 --> 00:01:48,509
80 degrees so with an electric heat mat

37
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:51,479
I can ensure those temperatures so I'm

38
00:01:48,509 --> 00:01:57,990
going to demonstrate one right now of

39
00:01:51,479 --> 00:02:00,390
how I do this and we save pretty much

40
00:01:57,990 --> 00:02:03,630
all around tomato seed I get these coin

41
00:02:00,390 --> 00:02:06,210
envelopes before that and you can get

42
00:02:03,630 --> 00:02:07,979
these at office supply store I wanted to

43
00:02:06,210 --> 00:02:11,730
share a few little details of how I

44
00:02:07,979 --> 00:02:13,410
label it tomatoes chestnut chocolate 18

45
00:02:11,730 --> 00:02:15,840
I always write the year of

46
00:02:13,410 --> 00:02:18,120
see to know how old it is because that

47
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:20,070
helps you with your seed saving so I

48
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,600
open the packet I put a little bit of

49
00:02:20,070 --> 00:02:28,410
crease crease in there so as I tap it it

50
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:32,700
helps the seeds to line up and give me

51
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:35,070
more precision how I can tap them into

52
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,620
this little furrow I've made I'm

53
00:02:35,070 --> 00:02:42,990
planting about 40 or 50 seeds in there

54
00:02:39,620 --> 00:02:44,670
you get about an ounce of seed per

55
00:02:42,990 --> 00:02:46,050
tomato plant you know I'm growing per

56
00:02:44,670 --> 00:02:47,580
seed but if you're just growing for your

57
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:49,800
garden you're not necessarily concerned

58
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,430
with that I know stamp those in a little

59
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,310
bit and then I take some loose soil and

60
00:02:53,430 --> 00:02:58,160
cover up my little furrow I'm aiming to

61
00:02:56,310 --> 00:03:00,570
get them about a quarter inch deep I

62
00:02:58,160 --> 00:03:03,060
found it's not actually super crucial

63
00:03:00,570 --> 00:03:05,940
half inch to quarter inch works and then

64
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:09,240
on a popsicle stick I am going to write

65
00:03:05,940 --> 00:03:12,060
chestnut chocolate for the variety name

66
00:03:09,240 --> 00:03:15,990
I know it's a tomato and at this point

67
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:19,320
in my gardening life I can identify them

68
00:03:15,990 --> 00:03:21,270
and I write the date on their March 27th

69
00:03:19,320 --> 00:03:24,030
so if I'm feeling a little impatient

70
00:03:21,270 --> 00:03:27,300
about the seeds coming up I know when I

71
00:03:24,030 --> 00:03:29,160
planted them and I can tell if there's a

72
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,760
problem or not so I'm going to show you

73
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,070
in this tray here I planted Yankee bell

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,410
peppers so this is a little bit farther

75
00:03:35,070 --> 00:03:40,740
along this was March 7th so 20 days ago

76
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:43,800
i seeded these in here on a heat map and

77
00:03:40,740 --> 00:03:45,030
you can see some coming up here and they

78
00:03:43,800 --> 00:03:46,680
you know obviously they were planted

79
00:03:45,030 --> 00:03:48,780
quite close together you wouldn't want

80
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:49,739
to let them grow in these open flats

81
00:03:48,780 --> 00:03:52,320
very long

82
00:03:49,739 --> 00:03:55,470
it's more just something you use to get

83
00:03:52,320 --> 00:03:57,959
them sprouted with heat so then I'm

84
00:03:55,470 --> 00:04:00,360
going to separate them out one little

85
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:02,940
plant here and then this is the size I

86
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:05,550
like to use for peppers you can see I'm

87
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:07,950
filling up this little pot snug it in

88
00:04:05,550 --> 00:04:09,720
there we'll do another one just so case

89
00:04:07,950 --> 00:04:11,640
you missed anything it's pretty simple I

90
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,290
generally hold seedlings buy the leaves

91
00:04:11,640 --> 00:04:15,570
instead of the stem because the plant

92
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,180
can regrow leaves it can't regrow it

93
00:04:15,570 --> 00:04:20,730
stem in case you were a little bit rough

94
00:04:18,180 --> 00:04:22,770
with it tuck it in there and that's it

95
00:04:20,730 --> 00:04:25,169
these will grow up to be really nice

96
00:04:22,770 --> 00:04:26,950
it starts in these and we'll plant them

97
00:04:25,169 --> 00:04:29,500
out probably around June first

98
00:04:26,950 --> 00:04:31,600
tomatoes I use something about twice as

99
00:04:29,500 --> 00:04:34,360
big like something like this would work

100
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:37,030
well we also have some that are a little

101
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:40,300
deeper because tomatoes are just more

102
00:04:37,030 --> 00:04:42,150
vigorous growing so you can see with

103
00:04:40,300 --> 00:04:44,830
this method I can really concentrate

104
00:04:42,150 --> 00:04:48,640
growing a lot of starts in a small

105
00:04:44,830 --> 00:04:50,740
amount of space and you know make the

106
00:04:48,640 --> 00:04:52,060
best use out of my heat mats so I hope

107
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:54,430
this was helpful and you learned

108
00:04:52,060 --> 00:04:58,030
something that you're able to put into

109
00:04:54,430 --> 00:05:00,910
action and improve your success at

110
00:04:58,030 --> 00:05:02,620
starting tomatoes eggplants and peppers

111
00:05:00,910 --> 00:05:05,800
from seeds you can use the same

112
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:09,240
technique for all of them and I'll put a

113
00:05:05,800 --> 00:05:13,210
link again in the comments of our

114
00:05:09,240 --> 00:05:17,230
website for accessing seed and we have a

115
00:05:13,210 --> 00:05:18,940
free ebook on growing a hundred square

116
00:05:17,230 --> 00:05:20,920
foot garden and all that you need to

117
00:05:18,940 --> 00:05:22,810
know and the link to that will be in the

118
00:05:20,920 --> 00:05:26,470
comments as well so I wish you all the

119
00:05:22,810 --> 00:05:30,630
best and your growing efforts and may we

120
00:05:26,470 --> 00:05:30,630
grow a world of good peace
