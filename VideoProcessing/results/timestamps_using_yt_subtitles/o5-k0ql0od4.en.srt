00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,240
water sustains

3
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:12,799
life on earth our ancient civilizations

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,519
flourished alongside reliable freshwater

5
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:15,759
sources

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,000
from ancient times to modern days

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:21,119
agricultural and livestock production

8
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:23,439
depend on this key natural resource

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,240
agriculture is the world's largest water

10
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:26,400
user

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,439
accounting for 70 percent of global

12
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,840
withdrawals

13
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:31,920
but pressure on fresh water resources is

14
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:34,480
increasing rapidly

15
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,399
in the past two decades annual fresh

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:37,920
water resources have declined by more

17
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:40,480
than 20 percent

18
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,879
population growth is a key driver of

19
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,079
water scarcity

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:45,360
socioeconomic development is another

21
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,440
important driver

22
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,960
increasing water demands and shifting

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:54,000
diets to more water intensive foods

24
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:54,719
moreover rising competition for scarce

25
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,039
water

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,199
alongside the effects of climate change

27
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,320
can lead to tensions and conflicts

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,159
jeopardizing access to water inevitably

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,280
vulnerable populations are the most

30
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,280
severely affected

31
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:11,840
fortunately we know what needs to be

32
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,520
done to achieve sustainable water

33
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,360
resource management

34
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,600
guaranteeing environmental flow

35
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,000
requirements to sustain ecosystem

36
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,080
functions is crucial expanding and

37
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,680
improving water harvesting and water

38
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:25,920
conservation techniques

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,159
can greatly benefit farmers in rain-fed

40
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,960
agriculture

41
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:30,960
rehabilitating and modernizing

42
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,520
irrigation systems and adopting

43
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:36,000
innovative technologies bolster water

44
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:40,000
productivity in irrigated cropland

45
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:42,880
and will be key to water-stressed areas

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,799
to be most effective all improved water

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,360
management practices must be combined

48
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,360
with the best agronomic practices

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,320
such as cultivating drought tolerant

50
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,600
crop varieties

51
00:01:51,320 --> 00:01:54,560
non-consumptive water uses such as

52
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:57,040
aquaculture

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:02:00,000
and non-conventional water sources

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:01,920
including water reuse and desalination

55
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:05,040
offer further opportunities for more

56
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:07,360
responsible water resource management

57
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,160
effective and coordinated policies and

58
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,479
governance

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,400
can lead to more efficient equitable and

60
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,720
sustainable water resource management

61
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,599
our water resources are precious

62
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,400
together

63
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,239
we can ensure equitable access for all

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:22,879
and conserve this crucial natural

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:35,280
resource

66
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:35,280
for future generations
