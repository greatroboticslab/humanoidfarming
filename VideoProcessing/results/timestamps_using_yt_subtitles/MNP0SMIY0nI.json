  "text": "Back at the vegetable bed again, looking at these early blighted tomatoes. So, early blight is one of the most common fungal diseases of tomatoes. This fungal disease loves wet and warm conditions and this is usually spread through overcrowdedness and bad airflow and so that comes with overcrowdedness. So, that's the easiest fix without using any type of substance. Oh, lost one. Blight can also affect the stems and the leaves as well. And usually this type of fungal disease starts at the bottom of the plant and works its way up. So if it starts down here, leaves start falling off and then you see some fruit like this, you definitely have some light. The stem damage is usually characterized by brown dry spots. Sometimes sun come in kind of like this one, but definitely brown and dry. The first thing you should do when you see blight on your tomatoes is get rid of the affected fruit. Get rid of that. The next easiest fix is to use something that we use at the garden center and offer at the garden center. It's copper fungicide. So, you can get this. You can spray it right on the plants and the tomatoes and it'll help you mitigate your fungal infections and spreads. And then you want to make sure everything is getting good separation and good airflow. That's how you beat it.",
