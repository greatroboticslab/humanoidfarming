2
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,960
collecting hay samples and having them

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:10,639
analyzed are important steps in

4
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,200
understanding if your forage program

5
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,040
meets the nutritional needs of livestock

6
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:16,960
a forged analysis provides crucial

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,359
information on nutritional value of

8
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,880
stored forages such as hay and helps

9
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:23,039
producers be more efficient in their

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,039
feed resource decision making

11
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:27,359
equipment required for collecting a hay

12
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,080
sample includes a forage probe a mixing

13
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,320
bucket and sample bags each county

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,040
extension office has a forage probe that

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,800
can be used to collect samples on a farm

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,239
the forage probe is operated using an

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,239
electric drill

18
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
hay samples can be collected following

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:45,039
baling if the bales are to be stored in

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,280
a barn or near the time of feeding

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:49,200
allow enough time for test results to be

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,000
returned to determine if supplemental

23
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:53,760
feeds are needed a two to three week

24
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:56,480
window is recommended for planning a

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,120
sample submission and return

26
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,879
test each lot of forge separately a lot

27
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:03,199
is defined as hay that was harvested at

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:05,280
the same time out of the same field and

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,600
under the same conditions

30
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,280
for example if you had four hay cuttings

31
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:12,320
during the season collect a

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:15,040
representative sample from each cutting

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:17,119
use a hay probe to collect 15 to 20 core

34
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,159
samples from individual bales within

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,479
each lot

36
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,840
insert the probe into the bale at a 90

37
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:23,680
degree angle

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,439
for a round bale insert the probe into

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,840
the curved side of the bale and sample

40
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,600
towards the center for a square bill

41
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,119
insert the probe into the center of the

42
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:32,799
end of the bale

43
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,119
remove the probe by reversing the

44
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,040
direction of the drill

45
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,439
detach the probe from the drill and

46
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:42,479
empty the sample into a bucket

47
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:45,040
after sampling a complete lot 15 to 20

48
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:47,200
core samples thoroughly mix the samples

49
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,920
in the bucket and place a subsample in a

50
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:52,320
one quart plastic bag the bag should be

51
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,799
at least half full

52
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,360
label each sample obtain an analysis

53
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,680
form and submit the sample and the form

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,880
to a certified forage testing laboratory

55
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,799
near you

56
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:04,399
the laboratory will send you a summary

57
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,640
report with information on the

58
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:08,560
nutritional value of the sample

59
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,560
this report can then be used to help

60
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,480
create a supplementation plan for your

61
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:14,400
livestock

62
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,160
you can also work with your local animal
