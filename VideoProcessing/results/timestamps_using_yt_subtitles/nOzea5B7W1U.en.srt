5
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:28,720
good morning my name's scott johnson

6
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:31,359
from the low technology institute and

7
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:33,360
this is part one of a two-part series on

8
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
home scale grain production and today i

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
need to prepare the soil and plant oats

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,760
and barley as you can see we've got a

11
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,320
field here that was more or less fallow

12
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,719
last year so we need to

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
at least knock down this weed load and

14
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,680
then plant seeds in it i have tried

15
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:49,039
no-till

16
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,039
i haven't had good luck with it the

17
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,039
weeds seem to out-compete

18
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,039
the the grains i tried to grow so what i

19
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,920
do is basically disk the top i use a

20
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:59,359
tiller with going in just an inch or two

21
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,359
knocking all this vegetation down

22
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
planting the seeds in and the seeds then

23
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,720
have a good a good head start and are

24
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,560
able to

25
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,159
over top the weeds

26
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:09,840
so i don't have to use a lot of

27
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,080
herbicides or

28
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,640
anything like that

29
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:16,799
i am going to fertilize a little bit in

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:18,240
this field using horse manure if i'm

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,560
growing other things i don't i'll talk

32
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,680
about each plant a little bit as we go

33
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,730
but for now

34
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:28,930
let's get let's get tilling

35
00:01:24,730 --> 00:01:28,930
[Music]

36
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,479
let's talk real briefly about fertilizer

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,479
generally speaking uh different

38
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,920
types of grain and different types of

39
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,040
applications need different amounts of

40
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:43,360
fertilizer

41
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,040
for example rye grows really well with

42
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,720
almost no fertilizer so i'm growing rye

43
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
where i grew corn last year without a

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,439
problem

45
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,360
wheat for me i don't fertilize and i

46
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,600
grow on a little bit of a

47
00:01:55,360 --> 00:01:59,280
restricted diet so to speak because i

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,439
want really good woody growth for the

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,960
stems because i use it for thatch

50
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:05,040
you could fertilize a bit more and maybe

51
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,200
get a little more yearly i'm not that i

52
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,200
don't care that much about that

53
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,120
because this was used for wheat last

54
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,440
year i'm actually going to put some

55
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
horse manure on it some well-rotted

56
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:16,879
composted harvest manure i've already

57
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,319
tilled it once i'll spread out the horse

58
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,080
manure and then i'll till it again and

59
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,560
then i'll be ready for seeding

60
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,080
i'm going to do the same for my barley

61
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,720
and

62
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,080
i'm going to do the same for my barley

63
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,239
i'm also going to be tilling and putting

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
in field peas which are soup peas or a

65
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,720
dried pea that you can then cook into

66
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,720
soup because they are a legume they fix

67
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:38,640
nitrogen in the soil so i actually don't

68
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:39,920
have to fertilize them at all

69
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:41,680
and they're not really a grain but i'm

70
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,360
talking about them because this is the

71
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:47,040
time that i would plant them

72
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:48,239
this is spring and you might say

73
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:50,239
spring is

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,560
too late for a wheat and you're right

75
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:55,840
winter wheat is planted in the fall as

76
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,040
is rye depends where you live it's

77
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,000
different time so you'll want to check

78
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:03,120
with your local extension or your local

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,480
state agencies for that timing

80
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:05,920
but you definitely want to get it in at

81
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:07,280
least like a month before the first

82
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,120
frost so that it has a good time to

83
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,040
start growing it's frost hearty but it's

84
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,000
nice to get a little bit of time

85
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,959
oats

86
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:15,920
barley spring wheat get planted in the

87
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:18,000
spring

88
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:20,640
and so right now this will be oats and

89
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:22,319
so i'm telling this up uh in the spring

90
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:25,519
we're still getting frosts but that's

91
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:27,360
not a big deal or a hindrance

92
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
i could have tilled this up in the fall

93
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
and applied my fertilizer that probably

94
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:31,280
would have been preferable and then

95
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,280
maybe i would have given little light

96
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,480
disking to take down any weeds that had

97
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:35,840
started

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,560
now when it comes to seeding there's a

99
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:41,120
couple different options um

100
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,799
you can broadcast seed broadcast seeding

101
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:46,879
is the traditional way

102
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:49,120
um and what one can do is take a sack or

103
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,319
an apron

104
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,879
and have

105
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:55,439
their seed in and what you do

106
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:58,239
your seeding rate is

107
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,920
driven by your foot steps so

108
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:00,799
for some seating rates you would take a

109
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:02,000
step

110
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,640
and throw

111
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,959
and then one and step and throw

112
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,879
and one and step and throw

113
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,799
if you want a denser seating rate then

114
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:13,280
you could throw throw

115
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,439
throw throw on each step

116
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
or even every third step whatever

117
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,560
i don't know

118
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,239
what a seeding rate would be you would

119
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,639
have to experiment on your own to figure

120
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:22,639
that out

121
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,440
what i do for laying down my seed is i

122
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
put down rows

123
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:30,400
and because i do not have a large

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,840
mechanical cedar i have to use a single

125
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,000
row cedar

126
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,440
a garden an earthway cedar

127
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:38,080
if you have a multiple

128
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,800
cedar good for you i don't and so what i

129
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,639
do is i make eight inch rows and so i've

130
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,440
got a measuring tape down here and i'm

131
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,840
putting down these white

132
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:49,919
poles every eight inches and then i'm

133
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:51,919
going to run the cedar between them

134
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,400
and when i look down the

135
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
the field i see the rest of them

136
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,639
i see this exact same setup on the other

137
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:01,120
side and so what's going to happen is i

138
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,680
will just take the cedar and run

139
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,039
straight down to its partner

140
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,400
and that will give me a nice row the

141
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,360
reason being

142
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,400
rows let me weed a little better because

143
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,560
i can differentiate between

144
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:17,039
what is seeded for

145
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,880
for grain and what is weeds

146
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,880
this is especially important

147
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:23,039
if you're coming off of grass there was

148
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,199
grass here before and so this is

149
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,280
something i'm gonna have to fight with

150
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,639
i find that to be my best

151
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,000
um

152
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:31,520
spacing

153
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:32,639
you can experiment and find what works

154
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:35,120
best for you

155
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:37,360
now as far as seeding rate goes i'll

156
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
talk about that when i get my cedar out

157
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:40,560
here in a minute

158
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,800
okay let's talk cedars i don't have a

159
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,560
big cedar uh like that goes behind a

160
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:45,600
tractor and has 20

161
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:49,120
40

162
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:50,639
60 drills i have this walk behind garden

163
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,400
seeder which

164
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:53,919
is not designed for grain so i have to

165
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,600
modify it slightly

166
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:57,280
and uh this seeder basically what

167
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,160
happens is it turns

168
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,479
uh this wheel as you walk this disc in

169
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:05,520
here turns and pulls up seeds and dumps

170
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:07,120
them out down the chute into this drill

171
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,000
that's uh plowing its way through the

172
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:09,759
soil

173
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:11,600
and as we'll see in the video coming up

174
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,160
but

175
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:14,960
i need to drop about 10 seeds for each

176
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:17,120
foot

177
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,440
one revolution of this

178
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:22,000
of this wheel is three feet

179
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,039
so basically i need to find

180
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,680
one of these

181
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,280
discs that's gonna pick up and drop 30

182
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,280
wheat kernels

183
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,319
for over three feet over one rotation of

184
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,360
this

185
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,680
and so basically what i do

186
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,080
to figure this out and i already know

187
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,800
the answer but um

188
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:42,319
i'm going to do this so you can find for

189
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,600
whatever grain you're planting and

190
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:45,600
whatever seeding rate you want

191
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:51,039
so

192
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,479
i'm first going to start with the beats

193
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,800
okra chard

194
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,800
disc

195
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,800
this slots right in

196
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:02,479
now i'm going to open up my

197
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,800
these are

198
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,479
streaker or hulless oats

199
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,360
i'm doing hull this out so i don't have

200
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:08,639
to

201
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:10,960
take the hull off which i don't have

202
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:12,479
equipment for

203
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:13,060
we'll talk about that in video number

204
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:15,199
two

205
00:07:13,060 --> 00:07:17,039
[Applause]

206
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,560
so here we have our oats

207
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:20,380
i'm just gonna drop

208
00:07:18,560 --> 00:07:23,360
a handful in here

209
00:07:20,380 --> 00:07:24,160
[Applause]

210
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:25,360
okay

211
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:27,520
now

212
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:31,479
now what i do

213
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,479
is i set this over a bowl

214
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,880
and

215
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,280
once it starts dropping i rotate one

216
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:40,639
full rotation so

217
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:40,639
okay so there we go so from the top

218
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:47,840
so that would represent

219
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,840
three feet of walking

220
00:07:48,470 --> 00:07:50,960
[Music]

221
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,680
[Applause]

222
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,520
now i take the oats out

223
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:57,039
and i count them

224
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:58,000
approximately

225
00:07:57,039 --> 00:07:59,440
10

226
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:00,560
20

227
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,160
30

228
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:03,360
40

229
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:04,319
50

230
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:07,120
60

231
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,560
78. that's more than twice as much of

232
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:11,599
what i need almost three times what i

233
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:14,960
need um and so one option i would have

234
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,960
and i dump all these seeds out

235
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:21,440
one option i would have to modify this

236
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,199
would be to take tape and go right over

237
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,560
every other one of these and you push it

238
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,160
down right nice and tight and then tear

239
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:28,240
it off so it's not on the back otherwise

240
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,440
it gums up the system i would cut that

241
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,599
clean

242
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:34,479
and that would reduce my seeding rate by

243
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,479
half and i would do that here here

244
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:37,680
uh here and here and then right that

245
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:40,719
would reduce the seeding rate and it

246
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,719
would spread them out a little bit

247
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,680
that's one option or i can try another

248
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:48,959
one so this is um

249
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,200
cabbage onions endive turnips

250
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,959
discs you can also buy blank discs and

251
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,920
then use a heated

252
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:59,360
metal probe to create your own

253
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,600
dishes little little dish cups to catch

254
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:05,279
this and maybe someday i will do that

255
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,120
since i do do a lot of grain

256
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:08,820
make my life a little easier all right

257
00:09:07,120 --> 00:09:11,200
let's see how many this does

258
00:09:08,820 --> 00:09:12,560
[Music]

259
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,720
foot

260
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,640
it's doing almost none

261
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,200
i can see them dropping in there it's

262
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:20,080
almost none because this disc is too

263
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,600
small

264
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,519
so that doesn't work

265
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,800
right so it's basically trial and error

266
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:26,800
so let's talk seeding rates

267
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,839
when you look on an agricultural

268
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,680
extension or

269
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:34,160
some website about growing wheat it's

270
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,480
going to tell you how much seed they put

271
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:37,600
in the big machines they sew at

272
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,640
something like

273
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:42,560
80 to 120 pounds per acre

274
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,519
i'm not doing acres how many pounds

275
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:48,720
right so i don't use that what i use is

276
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:51,200
um per square foot how many seeds or

277
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:54,240
because i do eight inch spacing of all

278
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:57,279
of my rows um i just do it by how many

279
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:58,480
seeds per foot i know for wheat i like

280
00:09:57,279 --> 00:09:59,519
about 10

281
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,240
seeds

282
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:05,279
purse per linear foot on eight inch

283
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,320
spacing that gives me like 14

284
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:08,880
seeds per

285
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,000
per square foot and what that does is

286
00:10:08,880 --> 00:10:12,480
it's like

287
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:14,959
a quarter or a half of the recommended

288
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,800
tilling rate uh seeding rate for

289
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,040
industrial wheat because what i want is

290
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,839
tillering so usually an industrial wheat

291
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:24,560
you have one seed you have one plant

292
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:26,079
well tillering that one plant senses

293
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,920
that has space around it so it sends up

294
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:30,560
multiple plants so from one seed i get

295
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:33,600
multiple heads it's more seeds i get

296
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:35,519
more return on the seeds i invest

297
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,079
and also it works well

298
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,560
in my application i'm not sewing as

299
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:43,279
densely i'm not fertilizing so it's nice

300
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,399
to have that one larger stronger plant

301
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:46,079
rather than a whole bunch of small

302
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
plants

303
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:51,200
so right now i'm seeing oats

304
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:52,959
i could still till at a similar rate but

305
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:55,120
i think i'm actually going to over seed

306
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:57,519
because i have a little more oat seed

307
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:00,160
than i do space so i might actually just

308
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:00,160
use this one

309
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,360
another another modification you can do

310
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,760
is take a piece of tape and go right

311
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:11,120
here so the cup is still open but it's

312
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,959
reduced and if i do that that will

313
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:14,800
somewhat reduce

314
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,320
the seeding rate and i'll have to test

315
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,079
it to figure out what that is but play

316
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:20,560
with tape and play with your seeding

317
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,079
discs and you can usually find something

318
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:23,519
that is close to the seeding rate you

319
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:25,760
want and if you don't know what your

320
00:11:23,519 --> 00:11:27,760
seeding rate should be do that's what i

321
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,839
did my first year i grew some at the

322
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:32,000
industrial seeding rate at the suggested

323
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,440
rate i did some at half that i did some

324
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:34,640
at a quarter of that and i did some at

325
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:36,240
double that

326
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:38,399
and what worked best for me was half the

327
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,200
industrial rate so i just did it by

328
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:42,399
experimentation i highly recommend

329
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:43,839
that approach

330
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,640
when we're dealing with small scale

331
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:48,640
because the people who knew how to do

332
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:50,160
small scale wheat growing are either

333
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:51,760
dead or there's actually a lot of people

334
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:53,839
around the world who still grow

335
00:11:51,760 --> 00:11:56,720
wheat this way but they probably

336
00:11:53,839 --> 00:11:59,279
broadcast i don't know how many small

337
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:02,160
scale farmers in less developed parts of

338
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:04,480
the world actually use a cedar i imagine

339
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:06,480
most of them just use a

340
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:07,680
broadcast method which is a little

341
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,880
easier

342
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:12,079
now i'm going to do is line up with my

343
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,040
cedar in this first space and walk

344
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:14,959
down

345
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:17,120
uh to its partner down at the far end

346
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,880
and then and when i'm walking i focus

347
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,440
far away from me i focus on the far end

348
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,519
of the field and that lets me

349
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:25,440
keep a straight line i'm planting these

350
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,760
at a depth of about

351
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,480
three quarters of an inch to an inch if

352
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:31,760
you notice as i walk i drag

353
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:33,600
the forward

354
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:35,519
in this case my right foot

355
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:37,920
and and deposit a little soil over the

356
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:38,639
line that i've just sewn that helps bury

357
00:12:37,920 --> 00:12:40,399
the

358
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:41,839
grain a little bit so the birds don't

359
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,680
get it all

360
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,120
and then when i finish a route

361
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,240
i take out the

362
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:48,240
post

363
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,600
so that it's easy for me to see

364
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:51,200
that i'm just headed for the next one

365
00:12:49,600 --> 00:12:53,200
that's available

366
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:55,040
and i don't mind trampling

367
00:12:53,200 --> 00:12:57,040
the ground

368
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,200
because that would be done often after

369
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:01,680
seeding in like ancient egypt they would

370
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,560
run their sheep or cows over to trample

371
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,800
the

372
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,360
soil in that's no problem

373
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:09,440
after each pass i refill

374
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:11,760
and here you can see the result of this

375
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,760
type of seeding here's last year's

376
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:15,680
rye and here's last year's wheat you can

377
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,160
see there is some uh

378
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:20,240
some competing weeds coming up here but

379
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,000
because these are spaced at eight inch

380
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:24,480
intervals i can walk my high wheel hoe

381
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:27,120
down them and knock all this down once

382
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:29,920
and then this is gonna grow up to be

383
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:31,600
this high it'll blot out all other weeds

384
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:33,440
and this was prepared just the same way

385
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:37,279
i planted the oats so you can see the

386
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,279
nice the nice results this this has

387
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,880

388

one part two we'll cover harvesting and

389
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:46,320
threshing i think we're actually gonna
