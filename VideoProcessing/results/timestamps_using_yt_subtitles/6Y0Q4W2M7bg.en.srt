really gonna happen but I did manage to

43
00:01:52,500 --> 00:01:57,619
scrounge myself up stout a cup of coffee

44
00:01:57,909 --> 00:02:02,140
free-range I might add a lot of stuff

45
00:02:00,850 --> 00:02:03,990

46
00:02:02,140 --> 00:02:07,299
big equipment

47
00:02:03,990 --> 00:02:09,670
besides the the pool building this is

48
00:02:07,299 --> 00:02:13,209

have big bluegill all laid out very

56
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:36,730

58
00:02:36,730 --> 00:02:41,019

269
00:13:40,559 --> 00:13:45,200
indigo

270
00:13:41,670 --> 00:13:45,200

so we're gonna come down here and get a

277
00:14:03,509 --> 00:14:07,379
bunch of these little flat river rocks

278
00:14:05,159 --> 00:14:08,789
before we flood it for the things do

279
00:14:07,379 --> 00:14:10,469
through here yes you can get some cool

280
00:14:08,789 --> 00:14:12,269
stuff for the pool yeah I'm gonna lay

281
00:14:10,469 --> 00:14:14,459
them around that little ditch around the

282
00:14:12,269 --> 00:14:16,949
pool this is gonna be really worth of

283
00:14:14,459 --> 00:14:18,959
crappies in the mondo bass

284
00:14:16,949 --> 00:14:21,479
we're probably catching about halfway up

285
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:25,349
that tree baby yeah we'll be in about

286
00:14:21,479 --> 00:14:28,379
well the water line so that corner will

287
00:14:25,349 --> 00:14:30,089
be the dam but I got I bought this the

288
00:14:28,379 --> 00:14:31,169
neighbor's property we're going to those

289
00:14:30,089 --> 00:14:34,079
all that out

290
00:14:31,169 --> 00:14:35,099
54 foot there so we should be about 3035

291
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,229
feet right here

292
00:14:35,099 --> 00:14:40,309
that's insane so I think this is going

293
00:14:37,229 --> 00:14:45,779
to be that the lfg mondo tree right here

294
00:14:40,309 --> 00:14:50,309
and then we got flares crappie Kingdom

295
00:14:45,779 --> 00:14:51,329

00:14:50,309 --> 00:14:53,669
was just talking about making little

297
00:14:51,329 --> 00:14:56,489
landmarks all over the lake kind of

298
00:14:53,669 --> 00:14:58,859
since we're gonna you know do videos on

299
00:14:56,489 --> 00:15:00,359
the build and help out with some stuff I

300
00:14:58,859 --> 00:15:02,789

00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,389
there comes out right under this tree

307
00:15:15,059 --> 00:15:20,279
there's another one oh I see I see what

308
00:15:18,389 --> 00:15:21,959
you're saying so it probably runs it's

309
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:24,239
connected to that little spring pond up

310
00:15:21,959 --> 00:15:26,279
there this whole like we call it runs

311
00:15:24,239 --> 00:15:28,649
underground hey hauler but it's it's

312
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:32,159
actually a swamp like there's probably

313
00:15:28,649 --> 00:15:33,809
10 or 15 artesian zits everywhere like

314
00:15:32,159 --> 00:15:35,789
if we walked across it right now we'd

315
00:15:33,809 --> 00:15:36,889
sink up this deep and we could just take

316
00:15:35,789 --> 00:15:39,899
a sip

317
00:15:36,889 --> 00:15:42,719

326
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,780
scuba dive down here if the water gets

327
00:16:07,760 --> 00:16:10,910
it's clear because there's some other

328
00:16:08,780 --> 00:16:13,310
big spring out of here so we're hoping

329
00:16:10,910 --> 00:16:16,100
they'll be clear enough we can sit in

330
00:16:13,310 --> 00:16:18,410

00:19:53,399 --> 00:19:57,480
tractor down there by the creek they're

396
00:19:55,409 --> 00:19:59,250
actually sitting in where the deepest

397
00:19:57,480 --> 00:20:01,110
part of the lake is gonna be

398
00:19:59,250 --> 00:20:03,330
besides the dam lie down in the creek

399
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:06,000
area so that's just gonna be phenomenal

400
00:20:03,330 --> 00:20:09,299
you know I can't wait the the date on

401
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:11,009
that around September when we get this

402
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,840
thing up and rolling there's a lot of

403
00:20:11,009 --> 00:20:14,580
things involved in building a lake of

404
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:17,669
this size because it's gonna be the

405
00:20:14,580 --> 00:20:20,070
biggest 30 or 40 mile radius this is

406
00:20:17,669 --> 00:20:22,529
gonna be the biggest Lake around here so

407
00:20:20,070 --> 00:20:24,870
it's not just a little pond in the

408
00:20:22,529 --> 00:20:28,649
backyard it's a natural lake that will

409
00:20:24,870 --> 00:20:30,059
sustain wildlife in this county and

410
00:20:28,649 --> 00:20:32,100
probably a lot of other counties

411
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:34,230
