  "text": "[Music] it's not possible to have a good yields of soft shop without pollination a hand pollination no preparing to get the collected the pollen grain or one flower and the male stage in the main stage we can see that we are getting some answers and this enters it is impregnated with the pollen grain this yellowish color that you can see we can go through this flower into this flower we can observe that it is it is the female stage so in this female stage I need to transfer the pollen grain from this from this brush to the flower for example I pouch it in the recipients it will be full of pollen grain and I or your transfer this pollen grain to the flower with one hand I tried to open the flower to expose the female part the female part of the flower and after that I put my brush with pollen grain in contact with the female part the stigma I do it Crossing and that's all it is pollinated this flower will continue developing but developing only inside these flowers or they were pollinated maybe some five something days ago and they continue in this with this formation with this appearance for 60 days for about two months and after that fruits will begin developing and with the development of the fruits we can say that we have to protect these fruits foreign [Music] this fruit just after 60 days of the pollination the fruits begin to develop we can see the spine that they appear to develop to separate one from another and this is the moment of protecting these fruits because now it's fruits and from this time it is possible to have infection with the city border the number one insect in the world to Source up so from this phase to when through it it be the size the the the silver can attack so we have to protect at this phase because if you protect when fruit is large one it will not work it will not avoid the the problem so I put the fruits one or two fruits together I protect it with this this protection with this bag this protection should be kept at least during two more months now it is protected in this case means that the past the silver has no capacity of getting into this uh this uh this environment because they are protected with this net with this this material so I will keep this fruit here during two modern months at least and after that I take out this protection and the food continue developing and naturally the the insect is not capable anymore to produce any kind of damage the seeds is not do not permit the of a position of the female insect [Music] now let's talk something about pruning pruning is very important in search of production is a a practice that you have practice that you have to adopt if you want to get good results if if you wanted to get a better control of diseases and also to help you to pollinate to protect the fluids with pecking and also if you during the moment of spraying against some insects some diseases and also during the time of of harvesting so the pruning is very important you have to open the center of the search up tree in order to get some sunlight inside every day and also to permit the circulation of air so aeration should be here either you reduce the problems of diseases and also will help us to make other practice for example in this case it was pruned here this Branch was spoons this also disorder that this Center was also pruned here we have other branches that was also pruned because it was growing in this direction I need to keep it open and after pruning we can do it with a saw we can do it with a Shear in this case of new suits that usually appear after pruning we have also to eliminate it we have to eliminate it in order to in order to avoid heavy closing again the central part of the canopy so we can do it every every branch that suit that is growing we have to eliminate it when you do it once twice or three times after that we can see that it you do not it will not appear no new suits again because you you're reducing its Force its strongness over this material so this is what we have to do another thing that we have to understand that every time that this plant is growing in the height for example more than three meters in height or more than a 10 feet in height I have to put like this plant here for example when this Branch it is very high I should cut it I should cut it I should cut it to avoid growing and closing again with one tree like this in at this this height I can make all the practices that this plant will need like pollination sprays packing harvesting and so on so I have to maintain this source of tree with pruning continuously because it's the way that we can increase yield and we can have fruits of God of good quality foreign we have to take a look on the spines and the color of the skin to see if it is ready to to be harvested in this case for example we take a look on the skin you can see some change in the color of the skin and especially when you do that when you cut you take this spine and you force it you see that you broke easily it becomes soft at this stage and also the operation of harvesting should be done with a shear and you have to be a good care so you have to put your Shear near the the pedal nearly stock near the fridge near the fruit and Cuts Like This Way you can cut it this way and the stock should remain on the branch because it's important because in this Zone in this site it will continuous producing new flowers it's very important to get in One Tree like search up to get the site like this one where we can install a flower Bud like this one it means that we have produced or harvested one foot in this site at this region you can see this car we have a fruit that we harvested some months ago it means if it is well harvested we can get at this site a lot of new flowers flowers button it is very important because it means that in this during many many years we can produce flowers and fruit every sites and we have to prune to stimulated new sites like these new buds like this one in this position in this position in this position like this one in this position like here it will help us to increase more and more fruits flowers and fruits the following years it will help us in increasing yield and fruits quality [Music] traditionally people use both organic matter and also fertilize chemical fertilizers you can use both okay but if you say no I don't want to apply chemical material no problem but you have to apply a lot of organic matter it's very important to apply because there is good response for social trip to what we apply organic matter and also you have to consider that when do you prune when you prune one three of salsa you are we estimate that you are you are putting four to eight tons per acre of leaves and branches you can see after two or three years that the root system goes through this material superficially with very nice results and also when you have opportunity you can use your warm compost to be bio fertilizer and so on in this case for example you can see related to to nutrient cycling Observer for example in this the source of tree it was pruned all the leaves and branches should be put together Under The Canopy under the shade of the canopy but you should not put fruits please never put fruits small one bigger one natural fruits never put fluids in this situation on leaves and breakfasts never fruits why because fruits usually develops and track noses call It pottery code is the most important disease that we have in salsa [Music]",
