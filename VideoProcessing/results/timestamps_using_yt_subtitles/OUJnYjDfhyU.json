  "text": "welcome all and good morning my name is Chris Roy I'm the consultant basically from Victoria and I manage that Gerry says grain storage extension project this morning's topic as you can see on your screen is best results for bags and blankets some quick housekeeping before we get going there's a Q&A window the choker you can define which allows you to ask your question click the Q&A window to open up pop your question and then if you'd like to send a question anonymously just tick where it says senators please feel free to ask questions as we go out I can kick this presentation interactive and answer your questions I've also like to thank the virtual copy work for facilitating session for today if you are having any trouble hearing me or or connecting those contacting they pay me oh this results for bunker storage bags where do they fit into this system often here they will just come to me and they say old creme bags they're cheap right but they any good for me yes they do have a place in the system yes they have a lower capital cost they tend to have a bit higher maintenance and a bit higher labor requirement they expect the obvious and and they to make them really they're really well suited to the shorter term storage so if you think about the higher volume lower very sort of commodities ideal for those things like how is the distance and ideally you really limit them to dry grain moisture driving bags because we don't have a way there efficiently with bags it's really about from the experience I see around the place in tell me about it's really about the effort your team if you don't put much effort in don't expect a great result if you put the effort in then you can make them work very well and you can expect to stall them for a bit longer obviously if you imagine a graph of time and risk longer the bag is down the higher the risk becomes of something going wrong that bag the gravy Burma getting in there pests getting in there grain quality loss so ideally in short term however statistics if there's a really good spot for them nineteen years we've got a bit high volume of grain that you've got to hold but not the anticipating to hold it for too long site selection preparation moving is key you see occasionally the the bag one bag in the corner of a cap a and unfortunately there we have a typical scenarios where I see if they will have how the issues one because it's not the best site and it's not managed that well though site selection really is important so ideally we have a central site written a few central sites around the farm that allow us to have all-weather access to that site and some way that we're going to be driving past regularly so at least weekly we need to be checking the bags and packing in holes dealing with any grammar issues things like that so a central site with several central sites around the farm where all your bags are stored in the same way you can set up your silo you put them all at a central spot so that they're much easier to monitor manage and therefore you're more likely to do it oh this one's higher ground I dealing with a slight slope and you can see the picture here we'll go bag which is on a bit of a rise which is great anything I do if I was doing the bagging would be to start at the top of the slide and run the bag again just with water drain make sure it runs down the hill away from the bag and the pinion walks it seal mechanism e-news at the end of the bag probably better than the other way obviously if you put it across a slope the war is going to run down the intended compacted service I've got written there put a nice cratered surface in this picture well I have seen plenty of times is when the rain comes and falls on the bag runs around the side beside the bag a little bit we don't cover slow and that'll soften the ground underneath the bag and then they later the bet black-saw make it sink into the soil and so what you end up with a bag it might be a little way under the compaction suits into the ground and so if there is a hole under there if my sleeve even underneath them into a hole with the grain bag sitting active surface so the bags it's nice and firm on top of the green and really also I stopped more poorly beside obvious pre of sticks and sharp rocks they told me to take them all away from Queens where birds nests obviously birds are they have an issue with banks so having a site that's away from the bird's nest another obvious one but something that I hadn't thought about if someone told me another one the creditor to the paper would do a bag they've passed on a lot of their tips and tricks of working what hasn't but away from sand hills on the long grass where rabbits and foxes tenderly obviously rabbits not a huge issue prepared but what chases the rabbit these problems and Fox is running over top of the bag taking them away from those samples and long grass first if I suppose is to select the quality bag and that can be one of the first helpful tip someone Gavin was absolutely super Thums it in the photo here I've got a demonstration what I mean by thumb just giving it a sampler bag or corner bag and just kind of stick that thumb through it to to see how hard or how easy it is to actually punch it about the head improved since they first come to Australia the quality of bag casino is much better than it started out to be something to just be aware of I don't set much and more people selling silage bag of grain bags and they just not this not that a bag with a stretch mark on it also makes life easier come with a rule or so you just measure up here speech that the manufacturer recommends things like that to make it easier when you try to give it back I don't have been research on this but in have said they sprinkle a little bit of your ear on the ground before laying bag good to the mice and Kenny research around how that works or what it works but anecdotally ceiling the starting end of a bag is quite important you might have seen or in my review real easy method of punching the bag up putting tabble trial in and stop being underneath itself it really is not the best option for a few reasons one of the main ones is when you come to into the bag the square of the starting wing there where shopping you have to do really shuffling so whatever we can do to make that Joe lead you the better so starting with a nice square in where they use this here together at seal or a couple of bits of timber clamp together and then roll it under each other roll it under it so [Music] seal and a square obviously when you're feeling they want to get the correct stretch don't overfill the bag there where if you haven't used bags before that they will stretch out a lot more when it's warmer itself stretcher bar easier doing a bag on cool day versus filling the bag on a hot day will be will be a little bit different so I've got straight this some people might think that's a little bit picky little bit finicky that we need the bag straight couple reasons for that though one is that it's a lot easier when it comes to out loading if you've got a straight bag to follow this one the other one is in the front you have got a couple of creases forming in the bag every time the bag changes direction until called a crease and those creases we find a wear mask and most likely to attack because I can chew the bag so the straighter we get it for those creases their spots we've got to the mass to access and down here like I said before well look at this photo you can see the site here it's always suggesting the core of paddock again not more not not my preference I understand that's very convenient for harvest logistics to run out straight from the chase then into a bag in the toilet paddy it's not ideal and and really limits the time that I would be comfortable waiting bag leave the grain stored in the bag so if it's just half of logistics for a month and we want to take the risk on be another half loaded when it's dry and not too wet do start in crazy after filling obviously we've got to seal up the the end of the bag well if we're finished if you know go to a bit of effort here you can get proper heat seals just to seal that up properly to keep the moisture out it seems like a pretty simple thing but what people tell me that the moisture moisture will find its way in there if it's not done properly so if you really have got worth going effort again clamp the tube it's a timber together our father saw the bag roll it under itself and then put some dirt on top of it hold that end in that opening listen to it obviously you've got to leave some bag access there if the unloader started so some dirt on the top will stop that back in the end and seal that then fence off the side of course even if we don't have sheep on our farm there's always a story of the neighbors sheep got out and run over the top of my bag or some well go to something or wild pigs building it and made a mess so I would recommend defense inside the gals of whether you've got livestock or not there's always something that we do Petare fighting a mice you can do a pretty simple bait station to bait the mice and clean up any spills happened around the site you can send the left hand side here we've got a beautiful hard compacted site here that makes it really easy to clean up grains pills and the reason for that is to to remove a reason for both grain pests and vermin lice birds anything like that to be actually attracted to the bag to be attracted to the site so if we clean those fills up and remove me from the site completely we remove the temptation in the attraction same as when we're patching the bag we're going there monitoring patching them that's about stopping their attraction stopping them spilling growing out and stopping the photo on the right here we've got a nice simple fence around it to stop of them and don't like though is that left the grass grower in the bag which again is a shelter there for the mice or insects not ideal and you can set it up right beside a built in fresh tree line which might be convenient in the court of a paddock but that's it's just providing food for those birds needs to control witches regular monitoring I've already touched on we here weekly is the ideal for patching bags again depending on where they are and how much pressure they are under wrong vermin I've had a couple people tell me they have got to go around them every couple of days to patch them again as soon as you've got a hole you've got a spot for grinding it out that becomes an attraction for more of them and that also is a spot where moisture can get in so soon you've got a moisture coming into a bag you're much more likely to have brain damage of course but also provides a really nice spot for insects to start bringing moist grain got a sample the bag check for moisture temperature insect pests have antennae soon it and a great system for the sampling but I'm sure you guys have got them whether you use a speed and take around the speed so that it doesn't tear the bag Mars the grain but same way we market lining up any other silos leaving the market cleaning bags as well obviously if we have big Brian full events you want to dry in the board away you know put this picture in to demonstrate they've got a bag nice and straight which is making unloading easy and see it's not too many holes it's likely not put the bag down for too long so well it's in a paddock and right beside some trees they're doing the right thing not baby bear too long expected me to be either stored or brain here quick frozen frozen cons of bags certain low capital cost upfront they do allow that segregation flexible capacity flexible in location meet leasing ground or you've got a farm that's the distance from the home place and it's not convenient to cart going home you could set up a bag use like they're so flexible location the conned things to be aware of they will require a bit more labor so it takes two people to load the bag and ideally color people to fill them successfully you could probably take shortcut but again every shortcut you take really reduces how good a job you're going to do and therefore how long you can store the plane successfully in the bag the pilot we we don't novel successful way to be irate the grinding bags Lee in there so cooling I wish to there's some risk with with damage and loss with a bag all things I'm telling you here is to try a minimum or inspectors and the limited storage look people tell me about stored in bags really comfortably for up to 12 months but the other people that have done everything absolutely ideal is like me if you're going to take shortcuts or perhaps it's it's not an ideal situation then really talking about storage really quick summary on bags there let's have a quick look of bankers while we're going on temporary storage very similar to bags in the site selection we want somewhere high we want good drainage to keep the moisture away they compacted pad again for the same reasons as we could do with bags we don't want the weight of the grain forcing a little depression in the soil and then creating spot a graded slope so if you imagine a roadway black should want a graded canva across the pub area and then we want to actually slow down so the water runs out of that bunker area as well so the camber and it's like it really is worth building and building website for a bunker if they will say part of their site selection for a bunker if they've got really flat ground is actually where they've got access to some filth and bunker walls look doesn't always be you don't have to have a wall around the bunker so the increases your capacity and it can help with sealing the top down a bit better and holding top having something to command it to you concrete ballz obviously ideal is it the clamping system but what I wouldn't recommend is using hay or straw as a wall purely because insects blowing pests in Bangka capacity to a few ways to go about it I put this table in here the people interested they can jump on on the website afterwards and look it up from the store crank ombr\u00e9 your website or or of course this just wouldn't have a you know idea start with how high your all there is Gannett going to stack the grain so if you've got an order that can reach up four meters expect your hub of that this is in wheat and it's expected the battle to get 700 meters wide given the angle of repose for weight if you adjusted a cone if you're looking about 225 ton capacity as the example if you went 30 meters long if you fitting weight it said number 60 cubic meters but really any loot I will break to figure out the capacity of a bunker the other way to do it of course is to calculate it for yourself the angle of repose for the various grains here a growing coffee it was a calculation here which you can do and then obviously your volume manners and then you convert that to the conversion factors where they're storing weight or value give you an idea of having a pad you need to grade half a part you need to put your bunker walls bunker operation I would always recommend the bottom top I have heard people say that they use the top top for a few years and then that becomes a bottom top you can do that with no separate but a lot of quality top for the bottom the top top there are quite significant differences in the quality of top that you can get so again if you let me at the bunker for more than short-term storage the quality difference and having a way to seal it down this is an ideal method to be able to clamp the top down to that concrete bunker wall obviously if we're going to do a bank on either a method for removing the top depending on the conditions if there's a bit of breeze it can be quite dangerous and seriously injured trying to remove taps will put taps on on bunkers one at 20 so having a safe way to move the tasks without having man handling really is a good idea and of course on the out loading method telehandler or a lighter or well bunker operation needs a couple of other methods if you put on the earth wall might be a tempest for the bunker you can put an earth wall there the ground sheet obviously wants to come up and right over the top of that that wall and then the top table will come down and join it now I do see in the next slide yes I have ever put any bit of dirt around the bottom of the top here to hold the top down good in theory but it can cause water to pool on top of that little that little line there so another method is to actually dig a trench around just outside of the bunker or top to go down and through and then put the soil in into that depth of the trench so that water running down the bunka tar will run straight across there talking away from the bunker site again a bit more work the more effort but you extend it the life of time that you can store grain there without having an issue and again these things operational things are very similar to two bags we can clean up many skills remove the grain from the site remove the attraction thanks aside our faithful mice and sure it's happy still being sort of pros and cons of bunkers low cost to capital up front takes off the passive flexible location obviously requires a bit more labour so if labor is something you can get at our store then that's fine if labor is a real pressure for your Tallis Tom then then then bag can bank it may not fit with your system Brian quality question was aeration it is possible in a butter he's a bit of work and in a bit to set up so I have don't you sit down there common but it is possible risk of damage on Wall Street begins rated for the ephemeral storage and the work required for successful fumigation not impossible but Dow Sephora so we have a look at the big picture of managing grain storage overall and thinking back to that first slide of where the bags and bunkers fit into a grain storage system we've really got three three categories that I think about in pest prevention and what do we do this try and stop pestering in s control what we do it with do get pests and having many grow in quality so if we look at those in the relationship bags and bunkers hygiene structural treatments and in terms of cleaning up around the site cleaning up and loading or unloading here if you do that if you use our diatomaceous earth aeration cooling I'll put a cross against that one while you can do in Bunker's I don't see it done very colony because it is so much work just to set up and manage across means that one protectants look this is where they do have a place in that temporary top storage and ensure the term I'll put a question mark there because I don't know if any one that is actually set up a chaser bin or something took me out or plyo protectants at the core acquired right it does seem to be they were challenged to be able to get an even consistent flow of rain calibrate that particular station so certainly possible I just don't see it that often so put a question mark yes that one but the thickness would help of course and monitoring absolutely you can do it I've got a question right there because so many people I say don't do it but I know you can even if we do all that we do get pests or our options to control them phosphine you say only control with the on-farm now in bags and bankers it is possible research being done in both and it is possible to fumigate it needs a bit extra work there's quite a process to it one of the real challenges to fumigating in bags is actually painting getting the phosphine back out of the bag being in sacrifice mania and it will take a longer really long bag there is more information I'll show you for that just really great quality in growing qualities are really about moisture and temperature management which we don't have a lot of options in bags and bunkers so it really relies on ask putting the grain into both temporal storages at the right conditions so it is a very maintained because we don't have much control over to sum up before I get into the circular questions coming in which is fantastic so keep them coming me let's say they prepared to put in the work and give it a good result but it'd be unfair here talk to someone about using bags and bankers and they tell you that they can store it for a long period of time successfully and then you go home and do a do a short cap job or noted for the quality is your set up and then complain that you didn't have the same result they really stick about your expectations for storage and bags and bunkers obviously they do have their limitations I do have their spot so bring out and utilize them they doesn't work really nice in conjunction with some permanent storage so you can have a combination both if you want to out load a bag get an issue in a put out load one to have some permanent storage out load of you to so you might have a bag in a paddock and then after month you've got to silo space freed up you can transfer the grain from the paddock interventive storage any feedback there if you need to but having some flexibility really bad well as with my things on the farm plantain head to do your preparation figure out your pest control method and figure out your outgoing method and then make sure you clean out both the more information here the stored grain cumberland website or you can you can contact the nearest grain storage specialist on 103 them shoot me an email with some links here you can click on the links they're successful storage and grain bags as a fact sheet there's a few other information resources there for bags and bunkers if you feel that the website and just search bunker you come up with a few days over there tea video which are really quite quite handy for growers perspective he'll the questions here i encourage you to keep talking these questions in and i'll try and tackle them one of us on question here would you feel about a bag look as i said it is possible it is a bit more work to fuming out in the bag you need to set up a system you can actually put the tablets into the bay about every 7 meters so they can liberate and then remove the tablet after the fumigation period obviously it relies in the bag being sealed completely so the quality of a bag the head with a job you've done in actually mixing up any hole is silastic tape because we can do a pressure test on bags or bunkers in ideal world would have gas monitoring equipment that actually tell us whether we're reaching the required two to three hundred parts per million for a seven to ten days then as I said the fainting is actually one of the tricky parts of you getting the bag so that can now having a little fan getting some perforated tube with a red on it or like an order flight you can actually screw into the staffing end of the bag open up the bag other end of the bag where you're finished billing and actually suck the air to the bag so yes it's possible in fact this the second link I've got here store grind up another user slash rain bag negation foundation fill a barrel in that video goes through the process the I do ideal as the course of gas starts doable storage the question here more comment in bags if you don't leave adequate labor upside bags in no etching this with a a really good comment Roy they do take a bit more louver and you might think you can do it on your own or they build with West people but certainly agree with the comments there they are given a chance which if you try and do too much yourself so labor something you're short of a Paris they may not be your best bet got plenty of people around and they're obviously in a bit low capital cost are there any other questions that you guys have cooked down for few more here that off and get a spit but please refer to add the question there if you can well often here is the bag he medically sealed therefore low oxygen inside tell you sex currently I haven't seen any independent research to back that up so I'm going on here say my my personal feeling is that it's the bag was in perfect condition it's quite possible but reality used most bags and have some holes in them at some point and I don't about the option to do so the short answer is I'm not sure that they are you medically still I certainly wouldn't want to rely on that of my own and insect control then the damage and hopefully they are sealed that they the oxygen low inside but certainly the question here have been problems in the past when used yeah good point not Valley can can be a little more sensitive to it to its storage certainly in terms of moisture and temperature we know that lower the moisture below the temperature the better the quality of North Valley will be maintained so again keep your bags for the lower value higher volumes sort of product [Music] Malvolio Dewey you put it into a solid that you can have a duration to cool it cool it rained down quickly so you think thanks right that question or comment are there any other questions or comments people look up before we finish up well you're thinking of them perhaps I'll just remind you next session will be on the 12th and though then but at 10 a.m. and we're going to look at grain protectants so approach you can spray on to try and prevent insects and snow or grains also please keep an eye in your email inbox for a quick 30 second name survey just a feedback for us as I said if you'd like more information stored grain calm today new web site is a whole kind of information there you can email me info it's stored grain combo you will call 100 weapon in touch with you in the nearest grain storage specialist there's an app gac store brain app also has some information and monitoring capability there so feel free to make use of it yeah that offer I'll make if you would like more information on grain storage and you've got a few people in your region on-farm training session or workshop at your place so feel free to contact us if that's something that you think would be helpful if there aren't any more questions I might bring the webinar to a close and thank you very much for your participation and then your questions I appreciate that and hopefully see you again on November at crying particulars",
