00:00:00,900 --> 00:00:05,220
hi welcome to Uncle Tim's Farm I'm Uncle

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,680
Tim and today I'm going to show you how

3
00:00:05,220 --> 00:00:12,120
I built this Barrel tumbler that I use

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:13,679
to make my t13 seasoning in 40 pound

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,139
batches

6
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:19,680
so right here I'm working on the base

7
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:20,760
and the two flat spots on top there are

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,039
going to be for the pillow block

9
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,240
bearings and you'll see that

10
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,240
here in just a few minutes

11
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:42,440
foreign

12
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,340
block bearings I was talking about

13
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,180
earlier and I'm just marking where I'm

14
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:56,180
going to drill the holes

15
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:02,699
okay here I'm building the I don't know

16
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,159
what you call the basket I guess that's

17
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:08,400
going to hold the barrel and be the part

18
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:11,240
that actually tumbles I'm welding on one

19
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,240
of the axles

20
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,640
foreign

21
00:01:38,900 --> 00:01:43,979
the other axles squared up so that I can

22
00:01:41,700 --> 00:01:47,240
get it welded on and as you see I have a

23
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:47,240
nice sturdy base torque with

24
00:01:50,759 --> 00:01:53,420
foreign

25
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,860
here I'm continuing to work on the

26
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,420
basket by adding sides to it so that the

27
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,480
barrel will be held in place and won't

28
00:02:15,420 --> 00:02:20,660
fall out the sides

29
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,660
foreign

30
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:00,019
foreign

31
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:16,220
just doing a real quick balance test

32
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:23,760
all right I'm going to be putting the

33
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:27,300
uprights on the sides here and I'm using

34
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,739
my Fireball tool Square to try to make

35
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:31,019
sure everything is

36
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,900
straight and square

37
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:36,540
takes me a little bit to get this all

38
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:42,080
put together but eventually I get it

39
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:42,080
squared away and it works quite well

40
00:04:16,260 --> 00:04:20,940
now that I've got both sides welded on

41
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:22,860
I'm just doing a real quick test fit to

42
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:25,100
make sure everything's gonna work as it

43
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:25,100
should

44
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,460
okay now I'm welding on the top bar

45
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,800
hinges this is going to be where I'll

46
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,419
open it up and be able to put the Barrel

47
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,419
in and then latch it down

48
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,440
I'm welding an end cap on this tube so

49
00:04:52,860 --> 00:04:59,180
that I can attach part of the latch to

50
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,180
it you'll see that in a few minutes

51
00:05:04,139 --> 00:05:07,560
this is the part of the latch that I was

52
00:05:06,060 --> 00:05:11,120
talking about and you'll see how it all

53
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:11,120
goes together shortly

54
00:05:23,639 --> 00:05:27,419
and now I'm attaching the bottom part of

55
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,639
the latch I'll zoom in here and give you

56
00:05:27,419 --> 00:05:32,240
a little bit closer look so you can see

57
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:32,240
how it works

58
00:05:32,460 --> 00:05:34,639
foreign

59
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,919
cross members to the top and they'll

60
00:05:54,660 --> 00:05:58,380
have little

61
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,000
flanges that hang down to keep the sides

62
00:05:58,380 --> 00:06:02,880
from bowing out

63
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:05,880
while in operation

64
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:05,880
foreign

65
00:06:40,259 --> 00:06:43,440
these are the flanges I mentioned

66
00:06:41,940 --> 00:06:46,620
earlier this is just to keep those

67
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,880
uprights from bowing out at the top once

68
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:49,880
it's loaded and tumbling around

69
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:05,160
here I'm working on the base getting it

70
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,720
nice and square and secured together so

71
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,720
that it doesn't flop around

72
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:12,199
foreign

73
00:07:46,380 --> 00:07:51,029
foreign

74
00:07:47,880 --> 00:07:51,029
[Music]

75
00:07:54,539 --> 00:08:00,020
now it's time to put this together and

76
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,020
see how it works

77
00:08:09,740 --> 00:08:14,340
looks like it's working pretty well I'll

78
00:08:12,479 --> 00:08:17,479
grab the barrel here in a minute and

79
00:08:14,340 --> 00:08:17,479
give it another test

80
00:08:24,660 --> 00:08:27,660
foreign

81
00:08:39,020 --> 00:08:44,219
I have some pads that I'll be adding to

82
00:08:41,580 --> 00:08:47,660
this later to keep it from slopping

83
00:08:44,219 --> 00:08:47,660
around like that inside there

84
00:08:48,060 --> 00:08:51,600
so here you can see I've added the

85
00:08:49,500 --> 00:08:53,220
sprocket onto the side and then I've

86
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,560
also added a

87
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:58,920
counterweight on the bottom so that it

88
00:08:55,560 --> 00:09:01,740
when it stops spinning it will stop with

89
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:03,779
the bottom on the bottom and the top on

90
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:06,180
the top so that it can load the barrel

91
00:09:03,779 --> 00:09:08,700
before with the extra Hardware on top

92
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:12,140
with the latch it was stopping with the

93
00:09:08,700 --> 00:09:12,140
top on the bottom

94
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,000
another Quick Test run

95
00:09:27,300 --> 00:09:31,920
here I'm welding a little axle together

96
00:09:29,940 --> 00:09:36,200
that will screw on to the windshield

97
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:36,200
wiper motor to help turn this thing

98
00:09:36,300 --> 00:09:42,060
and now it's time to test it with the

99
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:44,220
motor just I'm just holding it just to

100
00:09:42,060 --> 00:09:46,700
make sure that it will actually turn

101
00:09:44,220 --> 00:09:46,700
this thing

102
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:57,959
so now I'm welding on the motor mount

103
00:09:54,779 --> 00:10:01,380
that's adjustable so that I can

104
00:09:57,959 --> 00:10:03,540
keep the chain tight and what I found

105
00:10:01,380 --> 00:10:05,160
out after getting this all put together

106
00:10:03,540 --> 00:10:07,560
and actually putting some weight in the

107
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:09,300
barrel is that this windshield wiper

108
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:12,540
motor was way

109
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:14,519
way underpowered it turns this empty or

110
00:10:12,540 --> 00:10:16,380
even with the Empty Barrel in it just

111
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:18,060
fine but once I put

112
00:10:16,380 --> 00:10:20,519
40 pounds of

113
00:10:18,060 --> 00:10:22,019
seasonings in the barrel it wouldn't

114
00:10:20,519 --> 00:10:25,320
budget

115
00:10:22,019 --> 00:10:28,740
so I ended up having to order

116
00:10:25,320 --> 00:10:31,560
a much larger motor and as you can see

117
00:10:28,740 --> 00:10:34,440
here this is a two horsepower motor and

118
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:36,120
this is just a a quick test to make sure

119
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:38,040
it will actually work I just have it

120
00:10:36,120 --> 00:10:40,740
cobbled into place

121
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:43,440
and it does have

122
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:47,480
seasoning in it and it is plenty

123
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,480
powerful enough to make it work

124
00:10:47,700 --> 00:10:51,480
once I verified that that motor was

125
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:53,279
going to work I went ahead and built a

126
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:56,279
motor mount for it got everything lined

127
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:59,000
up and then went ahead and painted it as

128
00:10:56,279 --> 00:10:59,000
you can see here

129
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:09,200
time for the first test run

130
00:11:05,940 --> 00:11:09,200
with it all put together

131
00:11:09,899 --> 00:11:15,300
and it works like a champ and there is

132
00:11:13,100 --> 00:11:19,200
seasoning in that Barrel that's an 18

133
00:11:15,300 --> 00:11:21,060
gallon barrel and I have it's not a full

134
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,240
40 pounds because I've pulled some out

135
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:27,000
of there to use but it does have quite a

136
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:30,540
bit of weight in it and this two

137
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:32,279
horsepower motor will have no problems

138
00:11:30,540 --> 00:11:34,200
I'll do another video here in the near

139
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:35,519
future of me actually mixing up a whole

140
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:37,380
batch of seasoning

141
00:11:35,519 --> 00:11:39,560
thanks for watching and see you next

142
00:11:37,380 --> 00:11:39,560
time

143
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:47,620
