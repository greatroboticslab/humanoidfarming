  "text": "hi my dear friends and welcome back to boom today we grow romaine lettuce [Music] you hi-yah today I'm very excited because I'm gonna share with you a very easy technique to grow lettuce even from the letters that you buy from the supermarket it's very easy very healthy and he grows really quickly so let's get to it so in order to grow your letters from the letters that you bought in the supermarket you will need your romaine lettuce of course nice a cutting board one jar or a total work I'm actually reusing a memory jar to fix and so as you can see this letters was cut from the root here it has no roots here but that's not a problem all you have to do is keep this part from your letters so we're gonna cut it now and I'll show you how it goes okay so welcome to the kitchen okay we're gonna cut the letters at about five centimeters from the end of the letters and then you can say the rest in the fridge after you close the end of your letters you will have something like this so as you can see you have the ends here no roots there and what we're gonna do now is use the toothpaste to put in the letters so I'm gonna put one here maybe another one right here another one here and another words here so we have four toothpicks just like this and I'm gonna set it aside now we're gonna use our jar so fill up the tart with water all the way up now we're gonna put the letters inside the jar it makes sure that it's actually touching the water I'm gonna fill it up a little bit more all the way to the top so I make sure that the water is actually touching the letters mm-hmm now your letters will need some sunlight to book so make sure that you put the letters in a place with a sunny window so it gets lots of sunlight so you can grow quicker [Music] okay so as you can see this lettuce goes really quickly remember to always change the water every one or two days so you keep it clear and clean now this lettuce has been in water for about three weeks and as you can see the leaves are big and green I think when your letters gets to this size this is the best time to harvest and eat the leaves this is because keeping in mind that this lettuce is not getting as much ingredients as she would get in the soil the leaves are gonna start becoming more bitter so the best time to eat this lettuce is at this point I have read that we can actually transplant this lettuce to soil so she can get the nutrients that she needs so I'm gonna try it today I'm gonna try to transplant this lettuce to soil and see if she actually survived I hope that she does and I'm gonna show you now how I'm gonna transplant it soil and then I'm just gonna show you the progress on my Instagram account so let's hope it works okay so let's get to transplanting so first in this container I'm going to put organic all-purpose soil now we are going to make a hole further that is and this will be about five centimeters we take the toothpicks out like so and we're going to put the letters inside try to compress the soil guys look so pretty and now I'm just going to water a little bit so I make sure that the soil is moist okay so our first transplanted tennis is finally ready I will make sure to share the progress video on Instagram wish this beautiful that is look and hopefully it survived of course if you're going lettuce with me please make sure to share with me on Instagram I would love to see it and we will share with the community if you're watching this video life let's keep the chat going over here and if you're watching it afterwards thank you for being here and please leave a comment I will make sure to reply [Music] I'll show you what I do this is the lime or lemon base recipe today I'm gonna make it we're going to [Music] thank you so much for being here and watching this video and as always I will see you in the next one okay [Music]",
