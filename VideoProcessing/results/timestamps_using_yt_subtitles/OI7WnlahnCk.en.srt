1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:17,920
the newborn stage is over and now

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:17,920
we have our new challenges

3
00:00:19,300 --> 00:00:26,600
[Music]

4
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:31,840
so

5
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
so

6
00:00:49,190 --> 00:00:52,240
[Music]

7
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:05,040
i gotta hurry i gotta hurry i got the

8
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:07,439
baby monitor in my pocket and the baby

9
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,400
has just gone down for a nap got the

10
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:10,400
boys

11
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,159
working on some school work and

12
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:15,280
listening out for him

13
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,840
and i've got to quickly get these

14
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,880
animals

15
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:24,479
hey before the baby gets up

16
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:27,840
babies on the homestead lots of work

17
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
but we can do it

18
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:35,119
silly cows are napping

19
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:38,479
in the morning and the goats are

20
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:40,720
waiting for fresh hay and titus is

21
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:45,439
waiting for fresh scratches

22
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:49,200
oh yeah what's your big billy

23
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,600
just gotta get in and get out right

24
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,399
right big guys you've been driving in

25
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,520
the mud

26
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:58,560
have you playing any muddy noise

27
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:01,360
so we have been opening this gate

28
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,399
and letting the cows and the goats come

29
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:05,520
out and forage

30
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,880
all this pasture here

31
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,200
they call this the cow pasture and that

32
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:11,200
the goat pasture

33
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,480
because ideally that's what it'll turn

34
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
into

35
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,480
we've got the temporary electric net

36
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,879
fence going all the way around

37
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:22,720
the tree line and last night

38
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,480
way back in the corner one of the

39
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:27,920
sections came down

40
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,959
so i could not let them out today and

41
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:34,640
they had to stay in the ducks

42
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:37,519
are molting again we still are not

43
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:39,680
getting any eggs from them

44
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,519
don't know why they are a little bit

45
00:02:39,680 --> 00:02:44,480
older i think i probably need to hatch

46
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:44,480
out some eggs this year

47
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,120
our chickens have knocked over their

48
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,599
water again

49
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,319
they are not laying either so we have

50
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,640
not had

51
00:02:52,319 --> 00:03:00,239
eggs and i'm getting pretty sad about it

52
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
with the gorgeous warm weather we've had

53
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,400
because even though it's rained every

54
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:06,640
night it has been sunny and warm during

55
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:10,159
the day the last couple of days

56
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:13,519
the bees are so happy they're doing very

57
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,959
well most days i try to wait till that

58
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,760
first morning nap

59
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,280
of the babies to come out and do the hay

60
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,319
that's pretty much all i gotta do in the

61
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,040
morning

62
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,760
so while he's laying down i try to run

63
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:25,760
out and do the hay

64
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,760
some mornings he comes with me because

65
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:32,400
he's

66
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,519
not taking a nap or what have you and

67
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,720
then

68
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,920
a lot of these nice days we all come out

69
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,040
and play

70
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:43,840
the boys come out with me and i lay

71
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,519
add a blanket for the baby to play on it

72
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,080
doesn't stay on the blanket anymore

73
00:03:45,519 --> 00:03:49,920
he crawls all over the yard eating

74
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:53,040
leaves and twigs

75
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,280
just like a goat and he enjoys it

76
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,360
thoroughly

77
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:59,200
but because we had so much rain the

78
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,280
ground is really wet so that wasn't

79
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,840
really an option today even though

80
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:05,840
it's warm t-shirt weather he would get

81
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,360
soaking

82
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,920
through if he crawled on the ground

83
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:13,280
today unfortunately

84
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,280
but let's go see how the quail are

85
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,160
our quail house has turned out to work

86
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:20,959
perfectly

87
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,880
the quail are nice and protected in here

88
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:26,479
from the elements

89
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:27,600
and they still get some good sunlight in

90
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,320
here

91
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:31,280
coming through the sides so they're also

92
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,080
doing really well

93
00:04:31,280 --> 00:04:35,040
but unfortunately they're not laying

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,800
eggs either

95
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,800
they're taking a little winter break

96
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:40,800
right now we actually had to buy

97
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,280
store-bought eggs because i haven't

98
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:45,040
been able to meet anybody locally yet

99
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:46,320
that sells eggs that would have been my

100
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,520
first choice

101
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,520
but i don't get out much and i don't

102
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,880
meet new people very often

103
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:56,240
so hopefully soon we'll have eggs again

104
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:57,440
this is about the time of year that our

105
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:59,680
chickens start laying again

106
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,360
after their winter break so we're

107
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,440
crossing our fingers we will have lots

108
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
of eggs soon and we will even start

109
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:07,600
incubating

110
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,320
once we have our fill of eggs and we're

111
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:13,039
back into being happy full bellies

112
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,160
we're gonna throw a good batch into the

113
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
incubator

114
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:17,280
and hatch out some quail some ducks and

115
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
some chickens

116
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:20,320
so i'm really looking forward to

117
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:24,080
hatching season

118
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:26,320
the garden is pretty much the same as it

119
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:30,080
was the last time

120
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:31,039
the one bed of garlic is all we have in

121
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:33,199
the ground

122
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,039
i sure do miss having a winter garden

123
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,080
where i can harvest greens and roots

124
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,360
all winter long but by next year we will

125
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,880
definitely have that

126
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:45,280
going again and i cannot wait i can't

127
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:47,360
wait to see this whole area

128
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:48,720
bright with green new growth in the

129
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,759
spring we are

130
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,680
super excited to start sewing seeds

131
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:55,919
we're not planting outside yet

132
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,720
but we are going to begin planting our

133
00:05:55,919 --> 00:05:59,840
seeds

134
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,039
in here i've gone through most of my

135
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,240
seeds by now

136
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,240
and sorted and arranged them by category

137
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,319
i will be doing that one more time

138
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,360
before i'm officially into the sowing

139
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,639
season

140
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,680
but boy is it hard when you have

141
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,360
so many seeds one of those things that

142
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,160
we worked on this weekend

143
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:21,199
besides sorting the seeds was getting

144
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,240
the seed shelf

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
ready so we have heating mats grow

146
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,880
lights

147
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:31,680
on two shelves and then once

148
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,319
they have germinated and they're doing

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:33,919
okay

150
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:36,240
temperature wise and they don't need the

151
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,120
heat mats anymore we can then transfer

152
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,199
them up

153
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:44,240
to the top shelf because we have solar

154
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:45,360
coming from the roof then as they get

155
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,840
bigger and bigger

156
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:49,120
hopefully we'll be moving them out to a

157
00:06:47,840 --> 00:06:51,520
sheltered location

158
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,560
as we transition them off one really

159
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,720
cool thing that i

160
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:55,759
am able to do this year is i became an

161
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,520
affiliate

162
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,520
with mary's heirloom seed i have been

163
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:00,240
promoting mary's seed for over a year

164
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
now

165
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,000
because of the quality and the service

166
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:07,440
that she provides

167
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:10,160
is above and beyond um pretty much

168
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:10,960
any other seed company out there and

169
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,199
luckily

170
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,800
she invited me to join her affiliate

171
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,120
program and so now

172
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,960
i have my own link that you guys can use

173
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:20,639
to shop for your mary's heirloom seed it

174
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:21,360
doesn't change the price of the seeds

175
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:23,440
for you

176
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,520
but it does help me out just a little

177
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:30,319
bit so if you want to use that i'll be

178
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:34,240
leaving it in the description down below

179
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:37,280
yeah baby black gold

180
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:40,880
this is some wonderful compost

181
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:42,880
that we were able to get because we

182
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,479
participate in the composting program

183
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,479
that ryan works for

184
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,080
so we turn in our compost and we get a

185
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:49,520
certain percent back those finished

186
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,919
compost

187
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,120
love it so excited to add this to our

188
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:54,479
new beds

189
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:56,319
something else i've been spending a lot

190
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:58,960
of time with

191
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:00,400
through the winter is i don't know if

192
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:04,479
you can see

193
00:08:00,400 --> 00:08:07,440
but i've got all these beautiful plants

194
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:09,120
in the house all of my house plants i've

195
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:11,520
kind of gone overboard

196
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:12,400
i've been propagating a lot of them and

197
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
i'm hoping

198
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:16,720
that i can start sharing them with other

199
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,479
people we'll be sharing a lot of

200
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,000
vegetable seeds with some families we

201
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:22,160
were doing the

202
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,680
food box program through the summer

203
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:26,000
where we were handing out hundreds and

204
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:28,560
hundreds of food boxes to people

205
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,440
and we're looking to adopt some families

206
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:32,240
to

207
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,440
help get them started growing their own

208
00:08:32,240 --> 00:08:35,919
veggies

209
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:36,800
and we're going to provide the seeds and

210
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,360
the information

211
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,000
and the guidance and mentorship as long

212
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:41,440
as they are willing

213
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:42,959
to provide the labor so if you know

214
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,080
anybody who lives in the carrollton

215
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,000
georgia area

216
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,320
have them reach out to me by email

217
00:08:47,000 --> 00:08:51,920
wholesomerootsblog

218
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:55,040
gmail.com the goats are

219
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:57,279
fat and sassy we've got this

220
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,560
bar across here to keep the cow from

221
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:00,720
going in and

222
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,959
messing it up the cow uses the other

223
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:05,040
side as a lean-to shelter

224
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:07,360
we do have plans to make a pallet house

225
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:08,800
over on the cow pasture for the house

226
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
but for right now

227
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:12,640
the lean 2 is working just fine we've

228
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,399
had a really nice mild weather

229
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,800
for the most part a little bit too much

230
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,279
rain but i can't complain about that

231
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,080
because

232
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:20,959
i'd rather have that than a drought we

233
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:23,120
moved here

234
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,000
in the fall when we would normally be

235
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:27,120
breeding all of

236
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:29,920
our goats and after the move

237
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:31,839
nobody really came into heat thyme is

238
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,640
the only one that i have confirmed

239
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
bread from the fall there is one other

240
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,120
dough that might be bread

241
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:41,760
but i'm not even positive of that so

242
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,440
this week for some reason all of my

243
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:45,200
doughs have been coming into heat so we

244
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:49,600
have now bred

245
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:51,200
um kitty hearts fancy

246
00:09:49,600 --> 00:09:53,519
and shady the ones that have been with

247
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:56,560
us for a long time

248
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:59,279
so that's pretty awesome we are not

249
00:09:56,560 --> 00:10:01,040
breeding our most senior doe ruby she is

250
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
being retired

251
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,480
she probably could go another round but

252
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,640
her body condition

253
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,680
isn't good enough to be re-read anyway

254
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:11,040
so we're going to

255
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:14,399
continue to fatten her up and

256
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:16,800
hope that she can live a nice long

257
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,079
retirement with us for those of you that

258
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:21,200
have been with us for a long

259
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:24,240
time you've probably noticed our

260
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,040
reduced herd getting ready for a move

261
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:29,440
meant we had to reduce a lot we are

262
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:30,320
actually down to only 10 goats now can

263
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,160
you believe it

264
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,600
i i honestly cannot believe it i don't

265
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,560
remember the last time i only had 10

266
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,079
goats

267
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,160
but with adding in two cows and

268
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:41,360
moving to a new property i felt like

269
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:44,000
this is

270
00:10:41,360 --> 00:10:44,399
a great place for us to be i feel like

271
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:46,160
i'm

272
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,640
really comfortable where we are we're

273
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,720
going to have some new kids coming along

274
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:52,480
i might choose a couple of does out of

275
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,680
those that i like to

276
00:10:52,480 --> 00:10:56,640
and can see potential for and we may

277
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,480
keep them

278
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:03,200
but we also want to kind of

279
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:04,480
focus on what we're doing and the garden

280
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:06,720
and the cows

281
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:07,839
are going to be some pretty hefty

282
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,320
projects for us

283
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:12,079
um the garden being new we're going to

284
00:11:10,320 --> 00:11:13,040
have to see what kind of battles that we

285
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:15,279
have to face

286
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:17,120
having a garden on this property in a

287
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:18,800
new property you never know

288
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,160
what kind of pests you're going to have

289
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,200
what kind of weeds are going to be

290
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,640
around

291
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:25,120
we don't know what the deer presence is

292
00:11:22,640 --> 00:11:27,360
going to be we just really don't know

293
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,920
so we're hoping to get a good handle on

294
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:34,000
the garden in this location this year

295
00:11:29,920 --> 00:11:35,440
and start lots of new projects

296
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,240
some new birds that we're going to be

297
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:40,079
hatching and

298
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:42,320
that's pretty much going to keep us busy

299
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:44,640
i think with a new baby

300
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,680
i mean he's eight months old now guys

301
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,120
but

302
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,120
that's actually when it starts to get a

303
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:50,000
little harder because he can crawl he

304
00:11:49,120 --> 00:11:53,360
can get around

305
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,720
he can get into things so the newborn

306
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,079
stage is over

307
00:11:54,720 --> 00:12:01,600
and now we have our new challenges

308
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:03,360
so it's going to be an interesting ride

309
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:05,040
