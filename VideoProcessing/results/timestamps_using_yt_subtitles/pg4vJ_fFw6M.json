  "text": "welcome back to this channel in this video we'll be discussing a very important subject that I know several Pak Farmers have on their mind in turning Pig farmers and that's the question around uh what kind of size of pig should I start my farm with so uh one of the first question is should you start with uh a pregnant Pig like the one you see in the video right now or should you start with the winners like what you can see right on the screen also should you start with the Growers like what you can see right on your screen also and last but not the least should you start with a matured but not yet pregnant Pig so in this video we'll be talking about these four different sizes of pigs and which one is best for you to start your farm with quickly before I continue if you new to this Channel please quickly click the Subscribe button on this channel we bringing to you lots of great videos great content on profitable P farming all you need to know the a to set of P farming will'll be dropping it right here on this channel so please hit the subscription button and hit the Bell notification so that you can be notified each time we upload a new video all right let's delve right into it so what size of pig should I start with as a new farmer as a an aspiring Peak farmer what kind of size should I start my farm with now the pregnant pigs are are the most expensive size of pigs amongst all that I showed you not withstanding what breeds you are dealing with the pregnant pigs are always the most expensive and you can agree with me why they will be the most expensive obviously because every um seller understands that you getting them means you getting not just the mother alone but you're getting additional number of piglets alongside so and it could vary from 5 to 15 so therefore every farmer selling to you a pregnant Pig will obviously sell at premium because everybody understands that you are getting a jackpot by getting a pregnant pigs a pregnant Pig so why should I start or why should I not start with a pregnant pigs that's what we'll be answering in this video all right let's do it mat quickly uh a pregnant Pig of a pregnant tn70 brid will cost about 400,000 Nara okay 400,000 NRA now the grower pigs will cost about 80,000 to 120,000 n and the the winners May range from there about 50 to 100,000 depending on wherever you're getting them from so we will use the cost of 50,000 or 60,000 for a winner 100,000 for a gr for the grower and 400,000 for a pregnant Peak a pregnant s now look at the mat getting one pregnant Pig will get you there about four to five grower pigs or about six to eight winner picks now what do you feel is best for you do you think it will be good for you to have I understand there's an argument you will bring up in your mind but do you think it would be good to get just one pregnant Pig what 400,000 or four or five gr pigs what the same amount or 6 to eight winner pigs wor the same amount now many of you will say okay it's not just one pregnant Pig I know that's the argument going on in your mind you still have about probably like 10 or 15 or there about of piglets in the home so why should I not get a pregnant Pig well the point is when you look at risk the risk of this whole thing because as a good businessman you need to know how to mitigate your your risk risk is extremely important when entering any business you need to consider uh mitigating your risk whenever you getting into any form of business so if you're going to dump 400k on one hanima with the risk of Poss possibly losing its piglet because you don't have 100% assurance that you're going to get those piglets due to several reasons uh it's possible you you have issues while transporting them down here because you need to understand that one of the main key thing when bringing a pregnant pig is for you to be very sure you are going to get them safely into your farm because the if the road is Bumpy if the road is uh rough if you have adverse weather condition you could lose your piglet your s your pregnant s could have bought or have miscarriage so obviously those are some some happenings that can happen while getting a pregnant Pig now imagine you get a pregnant Pig and that happens that's obviously a very big loss because in the head you back to square one more like you're getting back to just having a normal pig without it piglet but imagine you get a grow P or rather imagine you get five gr PS now of course the same risk still exist while getting uh a grow Peak because it doesn't mean you can be 100% assur that you're going to raise the entire five also to maturity but you know the risk is mitigated because if anything happens to one or two of them you still have about three left or two left so you see you have been able succeeded in mitigating your risk because you need to understand that no matter how much you try there are certain situations that could happen that are unpredictable uh no matter how much you do your due diligence so you want to make sure you are on the saf side when planning your business when getting into your uh into Peak farming now imagine you get five of these you raise them up you learn so much while raising them up you are able to grow as a farmer you're able to understand the Integrity of peak farming that wiser that's better that's much more advisable than getting a pregnant s getting a pregnant s obviously if you're a new Peak farmer you need to understand that some sever question you should ask yourself is do you have the experience of managing a pregnant s to ensure it deliver safely you know all it takes all you need to do when it's delivering all you all the maintenance all the management practices that you have to do the feeding all the nutrient it needs to heat do you know all those things now also when the pig deliver do you know everything you need to do in terms of managing the piglets to ensure that they grow to maturity that you don't lose any one of them just so you know I have a friend of mine that lost his entire piglet he had a pregnant sell the pregnant sell delivered to gave bir to ha piglet fine piglet fine fine piglet but you know the piglet the the the the mother could not give the piglet milk and so the pigs were okay the piglets they came out fine they were okay but the piglet could not suck so in no time at all just in few days he lost everything he first of all lost about maybe seven of them uh maybe six in Con in in six went quite early then maybe two survived to some point then later on one went later on the last one went in short he lost the entire hit that's exactly the reason why I would not advise you to get a pregnant Pig now doesn't mean I did not say you should not get a pregnant pig let me state that very clearly I just mean of course if you have the experience or if you have an expact and you are very sure of being able to handle it rightly obviously you can go for a pregnant PE but if this is not the case if you are so new to Pi farming and you have no idea of what it takes to ensure like what drug are you supposed to give a pregnant PE we'll be doing a video on that very soon what are the care you're supposed to give uh to a pregnant Pig what when a pig deliver what's the drug what's the medication you're supposed to give it what's the medication you're supposed to give to the piglet you see if you don't give your piglet a certain drug after 3 days about if you wait till over 3 days you you if you're not careful you will lose all the piglets even though it gives the mother gives it milk and let's imagine you even have a mother that gives that doesn't have milk what's the injection you're supposed to give to to a pregnan a a sorry a a s I just delivered that is not having enough meal what are you supposed to do in that situation so imagine you get a pregnant pee and this that situation happens what do you do that's exactly the reason why I may not advise you to get a pregnant PE but of course I said again if you are very much experienced and you are sure of what you're doing it looks like a very good way to start because obviously if you get two pregnant pigs or five pregnant pigs you are getting about 50 piglets or thereabout from just a few weeks and in just one delivery so obviously that looks very catchy but again that could be very risky if you don't have the right experience you could lose all your piglets and you could lose your s that friend of mine that I talked about almost lost the S I knew all the things we had to do to rescue that s to rescue the south from North D he has already even lost hope already and was considering uh calling the buyer to to to get it but uh we did some certain things on you know give it some certain things some things I'll will probably be talking about in subsequent videos and the S survive eventually so that's one of the reasons why I would advise you to go for the winners or for the grower PS this now for instance if speaks you see on the screen now if you get them on your farm in no time at all in some few months they would be delivering they would take in and give you your piglet and you would be able to have the experience the experience from feeding the experience from management The Experience from how bi security everything you need to do uh to ensure a profitable pig farm you will be able to grow into the experience because I don't care how much you read some books or how much you research the internet there are certain things you will experience only when you get into big farming it's not it cannot be bought anywhere what it's different from watching a video than getting your hands on this thing when you get into it you will understand that it's so different it's different from watching a video and seeing how you know some of the time the videos are just a summary of what goes on on the farm you don't have an idea of the challenges and certain things that has to be done in order to ensure that the farm is profitable until you get your hands on this thing you may never know so I will advise you to start with uh little risk that means you mitigate your risk rather than going for something that could just quench your entire money like your entire 400k could just go or whatever amount you spend in getting your pregnan out could just go like that from just uh a mistake or an ignorance you didn't know something something happened and from there before you count five your pigs are go your your pregnant pig is go is gone but imagine you had a a gr P or the winner if you got five of them six of them or or eight of them or even 10 of them if anything happens to one you can learn from that one and use it to uh you know to correct yourself on the other on the other one and then also if you for you to understand the right drugs to use you know the the how do you inject your paks how do you care for them how do you feed them all those things come by experience so please from the the summary of this video is whatever you want to do make sure you're very sure of all these informations around all these things so you don't go into something that uh makes you uh regret getting into Pak farming so before you make the decision on what size of pie to start with consider all these things I've have said the experience the cost and every other thing that you may need to know and ensure that you are you are positioned right for whatever decision you make so that would be all for this video once again if you're new to this
