00:00:00,489 --> 00:00:04,590
Hello everyone,
My name is Youngsang Cho the founder of JADAM.

2
00:00:04,590 --> 00:00:55,789
In this episode, I'm going to talk about how
to assemble an irrigation system.

3
00:00:55,789 --> 00:01:11,610
There are overall 2 parts one for the external
hardware assembly

4
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:14,740
And the other one is about the electrical
system.

5
00:01:14,740 --> 00:01:18,979
To begin the assembly, as a major piece of
equipment first you will need 3 pallets to

6
00:01:18,979 --> 00:01:24,350
flatten the land surface where you are going
to locate the tanks.

7
00:01:24,350 --> 00:01:30,420
then one big water tank and 2 medium size
tanks and lastly the 2 motors one for the

8
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:33,880
water tank and the other one is for smaller
tanks.

9
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:36,049
and lastly, the water softener.

10
00:01:36,049 --> 00:01:40,619
For this video, I have purchased 2 tons size
big tanks and 2 600liter size tanks.

11
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:48,870
The first 600 liters 
tank will be used as a microbes incubator

12
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:50,530
and liquid fertilizer.

13
00:01:50,530 --> 00:01:53,380
And the nest one will be used as a pest solution.

14
00:01:53,380 --> 00:02:00,250
There was a lot of controversy on environmental
hormones from the plastic tank,

15
00:02:00,250 --> 00:02:06,250
It was partially true but now all most all
water tank products are eligible to use for

16
00:02:06,250 --> 00:02:08,149
drinking water as well.

17
00:02:08,149 --> 00:02:11,760
Let's first start with assembling the motors.

18
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:18,690
The first motor is from the company called
Hanil which they are broadly known brand in

19
00:02:18,690 --> 00:02:19,690
south korea.

20
00:02:19,690 --> 00:02:27,480
The first electric water pump's electric power
consumption is 1,500 watts The pressure height

21
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,420
is 15.5 meters.

22
00:02:29,420 --> 00:02:37,140
I'm not an expert on electrical water pumps
so you can always get advice from your nearest

23
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:39,220
hardware store for more information.

24
00:02:39,220 --> 00:02:42,500
The size of the pump can vary depending on
your land size.

25
00:02:42,500 --> 00:02:50,900
And the second pump's power consumption is
580 watts

26
00:02:50,900 --> 00:02:53,680
Which is better with smaller tanks.

27
00:02:53,680 --> 00:03:00,319
This pump is made for houses, it will automatically
turn off when is not in use.

28
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,520
And this is the water filter called the disk
filter.

29
00:03:04,520 --> 00:03:08,060
when you start using it, expect to clean it
quite a bit

30
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:11,810
often cause it will get dirtier the more you
use it.

31
00:03:11,810 --> 00:03:16,600
First, let's attach this filter to the main
pump.

32
00:03:16,600 --> 00:03:21,830
And of course, we will use Teflon tape to
prevent leakage.

33
00:03:21,830 --> 00:03:27,530
After this one, let now assemble other pipelines
that will be connected to the other pipes

34
00:03:27,530 --> 00:03:28,680
and water tanks.

35
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,569
If you open the PVC valve,
you will be able to see 3 different parts.

36
00:03:32,569 --> 00:03:38,110
When it comes to Teflon we also don't know
how much the accurate time to wrap the thread

37
00:03:38,110 --> 00:03:39,849
with Teflon,

38
00:03:39,849 --> 00:03:46,540
but with my years of experience, wrap about
20 times on plastic parts and 7-15 times for

39
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:49,230
steel-made parts depending on the size.

40
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:54,299
Do wrap the Teflon properly because you don't
want to find a leakage after completing the

41
00:03:54,299 --> 00:03:55,629
assembly.

42
00:03:55,629 --> 00:03:58,430
Then next, I will install this part, for this
one,

43
00:03:58,430 --> 00:04:04,970
You will be needing a 50A 40A connecting nipple,
Because the plastic valve comes in the size

44
00:04:04,970 --> 00:04:26,940
of 40A but the filter's size is much bigger.

45
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:36,470
And I will repeat the same thing on the other
side.

46
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:42,919
Then when we come below to filter, there is
another 50A size thread for the pump.

47
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:51,340
I going to attach a steel connecting nipple.

48
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,340
When it comes to PVC pipe,
there is a specific tool rather than just

49
00:04:55,340 --> 00:04:56,620
a normal wrench.

50
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,660
This is much more convenient for you and you
can get it from the.

51
00:04:59,660 --> 00:05:01,990
Hardware store as well.

52
00:05:01,990 --> 00:05:06,669
Next, I'm going to make a hole to install
the valve.

53
00:05:06,669 --> 00:05:10,750
Before drilling, make sure to drill a little
bit higher so that the valve itself has some

54
00:05:10,750 --> 00:05:15,580
space to rotate freely
or you can put extra pallets to install it

55
00:05:15,580 --> 00:05:20,650
a little more below.

56
00:05:20,650 --> 00:05:23,520
The tool that you need is the hole cutter.

57
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,740
The hole cutter should be a little bit bigger
than the steel fitting so that it will be

58
00:05:28,740 --> 00:05:32,530
firmly installed.

59
00:05:32,530 --> 00:05:38,669
Continue drilling slowly, then when the cutter
reach to tank, give a little more force to

60
00:05:38,669 --> 00:05:41,440
drill further.

61
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,130
Once you complete making holes, there is one
problem.

62
00:05:45,130 --> 00:05:48,800
The fitting that I'm holding should be installed
from the inside.

63
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:54,240
going into the tank to install that would
be a time-consuming and not smart way to do

64
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,039
it.

65
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:58,539
And this is where the trick comes in.

66
00:05:58,539 --> 00:06:00,639
Let me show you how.

67
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:05,720
First, take some thin pipes,
Then insert it into the tank and through the

68
00:06:05,720 --> 00:06:06,990
hole below.

69
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:10,810
Lastly, just drop the other part of the fitting.

70
00:06:10,810 --> 00:06:18,319
Then hold it until it is tightened,

71
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:20,850
Keep on installing it until you feel enough.

72
00:06:20,850 --> 00:06:24,910
If the part inside of the tank is rotating
along with the bolt,

73
00:06:24,910 --> 00:06:27,780
Then hold that part and continue until it's
done.

74
00:06:27,780 --> 00:06:33,720
And don't forget to wrap up Teflon on every
single thread.

75
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:46,280
Then next I will make another hole for the
incubator tank.

76
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:51,680
Once I'm done, I will repeat the same thing
for installing the fitting.

77
00:06:51,680 --> 00:07:18,561
Then I will be using a 20A size valve in order
to fit the PB pipe.

78
00:07:18,561 --> 00:07:23,220
The most general pipe that we know is the
white clear pipe.

79
00:07:23,220 --> 00:07:29,070
But these are weak in heat during summer,
So I would recommend using the PB pipe which

80
00:07:29,070 --> 00:07:36,180
is much more durable.

81
00:07:36,180 --> 00:07:40,629
You have probably noticed the difference between
the previous black PVC valve and the

82
00:07:40,629 --> 00:07:44,319
current one.

83
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:45,780
Let me show the difference.

84
00:07:45,780 --> 00:07:49,889
The structure is based on 3 components,
Once you open the bolt,

85
00:07:49,889 --> 00:07:53,539
You will see 3 different rings.

86
00:07:53,539 --> 00:07:59,990
The first one is the rubber fitting,
second is plastic fitting,

87
00:07:59,990 --> 00:08:13,789
then the third one is steel teeth for securing
the pipe.

88
00:08:13,789 --> 00:08:26,590
before pushing in the pipe make sure to put
the steel part inside of the pipe.

89
00:08:26,590 --> 00:08:32,810
Then when I push the PVC pipe in,
there will be a first smooth click.

90
00:08:32,810 --> 00:08:35,450
Then another hard click.

91
00:08:35,450 --> 00:08:39,149
That means it is all fixed in place.

92
00:08:39,149 --> 00:08:42,849
From now on I will connect the pipeline from
the bottom to the top.

93
00:08:42,849 --> 00:08:46,140
When you purchase large quantities it comes
in a roll.

94
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:53,040
So make sure to stretch it straight before
installing it.

95
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,240
There is a specific cutter for the PVC pipe.

96
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:03,890
Purchase one of those and slightly force the
lever then cut it through.

97
00:09:03,890 --> 00:09:07,630
Once you are done with cutting,
It is now time to fit right in.

98
00:09:07,630 --> 00:09:14,510
But before that, there is a 3 different parts
after when you open the bolt.

99
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:18,790
Rubber fitting and 2 diffenrent PVC fittings.

100
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:24,160
The mechanism of assembling together is pretty
similar to the thin PVC pipe.

101
00:09:24,160 --> 00:09:30,320
It is just little bit bigger.

102
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:45,380
fit in the PVC parts first, then fit the rubber
fitting to plug it right into the connecting

103
00:09:45,380 --> 00:09:50,160
point.

104
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,160
Once I'm done, let me install the elbow.

105
00:09:53,160 --> 00:10:13,590
After that same procedure is continued.

106
00:10:13,590 --> 00:10:34,990
Next, I will connect the smaller pump from
the tank.

107
00:10:34,990 --> 00:10:40,529
Then from here, I will connect the separator
before installing it all in place.

108
00:10:40,529 --> 00:10:44,889
The single side is for the water goes into
the water softener,

109
00:10:44,889 --> 00:10:50,100
And the other sides are for the future, just
in case you are going to connect some other

110
00:10:50,100 --> 00:10:51,100
tank.

111
00:10:51,100 --> 00:10:57,769
For this one, I will use the 20 A size connecting
nipple, and for the other side I will use

112
00:10:57,769 --> 00:10:59,520
the size converter for 15 A-size components.

113
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:07,110
Then I'm going to cut the PVC pipe into 49cm
to connect the pipe on the side.

114
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:19,310
Now let's come to the smaller tanks.

115
00:11:19,310 --> 00:11:50,690
One is for the pest solution and the other
one is for the microbes incubator or the liquid

116
00:11:50,690 --> 00:11:52,440
fertilizer.

117
00:11:52,440 --> 00:12:09,730
The fitting installed on the top is 20 A size
and the bottom is 25 A size in order to drain

118
00:12:09,730 --> 00:12:11,910
the water quick.

119
00:12:11,910 --> 00:12:25,970
I'm going to install the bottom fitting first,
Make sure to calculate the working angle of

120
00:12:25,970 --> 00:12:31,220
the component so that you won't have to release
again and again to fit the angle.

121
00:12:31,220 --> 00:12:35,769
And I will use the same trick to insert the
part.

122
00:12:35,769 --> 00:12:39,899
You might need these small tools depending
on the product.

123
00:12:39,899 --> 00:12:42,790
Now it's time to install the valves.

124
00:12:42,790 --> 00:13:01,540
Then next let me connect the all pipes first
with T joint

125
00:13:01,540 --> 00:13:05,870
Once it is all connected I will make a turn
from here,

126
00:13:05,870 --> 00:13:19,639
If your sink for the water is on this side,
turn the pipe where the sink is located.

127
00:13:19,639 --> 00:13:24,880
The other pipe parts which are already assembled
are for the water softener exit.

128
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:38,590
The lower pipe you can use with just ordinary
water, and the upper part is for pest solution.

129
00:13:38,590 --> 00:13:41,600
And let's continue with the bottom part assembly.

130
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:51,000
It is quite simple most of the procedures
are similar.

131
00:13:51,000 --> 00:13:56,490
The bottom pipeline gets a direct connection
from the main tank, and I will install the

132
00:13:56,490 --> 00:14:11,870
filter in order to avoid blockage from any
unknown material.

133
00:14:11,870 --> 00:14:15,740
Then next I'm going to drill a hole in the
existing pipe.

134
00:14:15,740 --> 00:14:19,680
This particular component is called a plumbing
saddle clamp.

135
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,459
It enables me to drill a hole in the pipe
and make a different connecting point for

136
00:14:25,459 --> 00:14:27,790
other components.

137
00:14:27,790 --> 00:14:32,620
There is a rubber packing in the middle, make
sure it is aligned with the point where you

138
00:14:32,620 --> 00:14:34,380
wanna drill a hole.

139
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:44,089
Then use the screws to hold it together so
that it won't wobble when you are drilling.

140
00:14:44,089 --> 00:14:57,930
For this, I will use a 16mm hole cutter.

141
00:14:57,930 --> 00:15:00,850
Once it is completed, I will move on to the
next step.

142
00:15:00,850 --> 00:15:04,579
Which is connecting the tank with the water
softener.

143
00:15:04,579 --> 00:15:09,490
I will convert the ordinary socket with the
one-touch fitting.

144
00:15:09,490 --> 00:15:20,600
The the same thing with other parts on the
top.

145
00:15:20,600 --> 00:15:25,320
Next is, we need to install other thin pipes
to be connected to the water softener.

146
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:36,940
For that, I will need 2 PVC elbow because
we are gonna turn twice.

147
00:15:36,940 --> 00:15:58,759
After that let me connect the other PVC pipe
to connect the water softener.

148
00:15:58,759 --> 00:16:20,440
Now, we are almost completed installing all
the parts.

149
00:16:20,440 --> 00:16:23,279
And I will connect the other parts to the
disk filter.

150
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:29,500
I will install the parts on both sides and
please measure the length before cutting the

151
00:16:29,500 --> 00:16:45,960
pipe.

152
00:16:45,960 --> 00:16:58,080
Then measure the other side as well.

153
00:16:58,080 --> 00:17:02,060
Once it is done, bring the pipeline to be
back of the disk filter.

154
00:17:02,060 --> 00:17:05,640
Then decide which side you will be going to
make a turn.

155
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,190
It really depends on your farmland's design.

156
00:17:09,190 --> 00:17:18,600
Next, I will add another 25mm hose line to
ease the pressure of water for the pump.

157
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:59,080
To do that I will make 4 different holes.

158
00:17:59,080 --> 00:18:02,620
Let me tell you why we need to install these
pipes.

159
00:18:02,620 --> 00:18:07,350
When you are turning on the irrigation system,
the pressure of each pipe will increase.

160
00:18:07,350 --> 00:18:12,260
And If you release the lever, the irrigation
pipe on the field cannot be sustained due

161
00:18:12,260 --> 00:18:14,230
to its high pressure.

162
00:18:14,230 --> 00:18:21,280
And to secure the pipelines, we need a sub
hose which will reflux the water back into

163
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:22,659
the pump.

164
00:18:22,659 --> 00:18:28,299
Meaning, the water pressure will be normalized
and prevent any leakage happens.

165
00:18:28,299 --> 00:18:34,740
As you can see there is a main pipeline coming
out from the container, and there is one lever

166
00:18:34,740 --> 00:18:36,690
to control water level.

167
00:18:36,690 --> 00:18:41,150
But also it is connected with the thin pipe
which is connected to the other water tank

168
00:18:41,150 --> 00:18:43,210
for liquid fertilizer.

169
00:18:43,210 --> 00:18:49,890
If you release the big lever all at once,
of course, it will just flow into the ground.

170
00:18:49,890 --> 00:18:54,330
But If you release a little bit, the pressure
will absorb the water from the fertilizer

171
00:18:54,330 --> 00:18:55,330
tank.

172
00:18:55,330 --> 00:19:00,530
So it is capable of irrigating water and fertilizer
at the same time.

173
00:19:00,530 --> 00:19:04,700
And this specific part is not very necessary.

174
00:19:04,700 --> 00:19:10,720
But if you have it, then it would be great
to connect water pipes and water tank along

175
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,340
with it.

176
00:19:12,340 --> 00:19:18,080
This small water pump is automatic and whenever
there is a tank with the lever opened,

177
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:22,040
it will water it until it's full.

178
00:19:22,040 --> 00:19:27,309
But it will be closed if the tank is already
full or the lever is closed.

179
00:19:27,309 --> 00:19:30,950
As you can see the inside of the water tank
is not visible.

180
00:19:30,950 --> 00:19:35,080
And it's because of moss if the tank gets
direct contact with sunlight.

181
00:19:35,080 --> 00:19:40,000
But with this blue tank, we don't know exactly
how much water is inside right?

182
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:54,690
So I'm going to install some parts which will
enable us to see the water level.

183
00:19:54,690 --> 00:19:59,320
Once you are done, right down the indication
of the amount so that you won't have to look

184
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:02,820
into
side to check every time.

185
00:20:02,820 --> 00:20:07,289
And here install one of the short pipes inside
the tank.

186
00:20:07,289 --> 00:20:12,370
Bent down the hose with fire then install
it.

187
00:20:12,370 --> 00:20:14,971
Then you will able to see all.

188
00:20:14,971 --> 00:20:18,250
The water gets drained out of the tank.

189
00:20:18,250 --> 00:20:25,480
Use the marker to indicate which hose is coming
from which pump and water softener.

190
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:35,120
You can use these two tanks for both pesticides,
microbial solution, and liquid fertilizer.

191
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,049
When you would want to use the both the tank,
release all the levers down below which are

192
00:20:40,049 --> 00:20:45,660
connected with the main water pump.

193
00:20:45,660 --> 00:20:48,240
And let's talk about the floating valve.

194
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:52,100
The big tank needs a big floating valve because
of its size.

195
00:20:52,100 --> 00:20:55,580
And of course small valve for the small size.

196
00:20:55,580 --> 00:21:00,490
There are a lot of products for stopping the
water such as the electric floating vale but

197
00:21:00,490 --> 00:21:05,370
this one is so far cheapest and most reasonable.

198
00:21:05,370 --> 00:21:10,900
As you can see our setup includes three major
pieces of electric equipment.

199
00:21:10,900 --> 00:21:16,890
The main pump, small sub pump, and electric
heater for microbial incubation.

200
00:21:16,890 --> 00:21:21,010
But you can also add some more such as electrically
powered spray.

201
00:21:21,010 --> 00:21:26,740
And to run all of that of course we will be
needing some electric distribution board to

202
00:21:26,740 --> 00:21:29,700
cover the circuit from the rain.

203
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,260
For that, I will make another video on how
to make one.

204
00:21:34,260 --> 00:21:35,720
Speaking of the electric heater.

205
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:39,010
You can get these from amazon or aliexpress.

206
00:21:39,010 --> 00:21:46,710
This is needed when the temperature drops
below 18 C . because of active microbes.

207
00:21:46,710 --> 00:21:50,990
Chose the one which fits the tank perfectly.

208
00:21:50,990 --> 00:21:53,890
Don't choose something long or very short.

209
00:21:53,890 --> 00:21:58,620
Using microbial solution is the key factor
to maintain healthy soil conditions.

210
00:21:58,620 --> 00:22:03,620
So make sure to irrigate often as possible.

211
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:07,049
There is no right temperature indication with
this piece of machine.

212
00:22:07,049 --> 00:22:11,409
If it gets too cold,
you have to increase the temperature even

213
00:22:11,409 --> 00:22:12,409
higher.

214
00:22:12,409 --> 00:22:16,549
So please keep that in mind.

215
00:22:16,549 --> 00:22:21,330
And lastly, when you are using this tank for
the first time, make sure to pour the water

216
00:22:21,330 --> 00:22:22,330
in.

217
00:22:22,330 --> 00:22:25,159
and
during winter, please release all the water

218
00:22:25,159 --> 00:22:27,590
out to prevent freezing.

219
00:22:27,590 --> 00:22:34,190
There is going to be some problem with the
automatic pump when you use it for a longer

220
00:22:34,190 --> 00:22:35,450
period
of time.

221
00:22:35,450 --> 00:22:39,360
If that happens, check the part behind the
motor to fix it.

222
00:22:39,360 --> 00:23:42,990
Thank you for watching and I will see you
guys in the next videos.
