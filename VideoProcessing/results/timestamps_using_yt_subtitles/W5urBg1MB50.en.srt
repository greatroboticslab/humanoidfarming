00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:12,140
our buildings consume about 40% of our

energy

3
00:00:12,140 --> 00:00:16,470
and with our emissions threatening to

00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:19,740
permanently change our climate

5
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:23,190
we need more efficient better greener

00:00:19,740 --> 00:00:25,170
cities we can start by being smarter

00:00:23,190 --> 00:00:28,290

10
00:00:33,350 --> 00:00:37,770
but our food production is still a long

00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,380
way from most of the people who live in

12
00:00:37,770 --> 00:00:42,930
the cities built on the best arable land

13
00:00:40,380 --> 00:00:45,720
vertical farming could turn this on its

14
00:00:42,930 --> 00:00:47,910
head or at least its side it would bring

15
00:00:45,720 --> 00:00:50,070
together a host of emerging technologies

16
00:00:47,910 --> 00:00:52,380
by putting food production on the

17

land use pull our urban heat sinks and

19
00:00:55,320 --> 00:01:02,160
drastically reduce food transport costs

20
00:00:58,880 --> 00:01:04,229
modern agriculture uses 70% of the

21
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,600
world's available fresh water but

22
00:01:04,229 --> 00:01:09,659
vertical farms could be fitted with nano

the best genetic variants for the

29
00:01:22,740 --> 00:01:28,759

hurdles the crops best suited to

35
00:01:42,389 --> 00:01:47,069
vertical farming may require us to

36
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:50,069
adjust our diets but would farmers and

37

agribusiness take this lying down or is

00:01:50,069 --> 00:01:54,270
it simply that our dollars are best
