1.3 billion people rely on livestock for

food nutrition and livelihoods animal

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:14,839
Source foods provide crucial nutrients

00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:18,359
that are not easily obtained from other

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:21,600
sources meat leather wool and milk make

income countries and 20% in lowincome

8
00:00:25,000 --> 00:00:31,480
countries but according to FAO livestock

9
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:35,280
contributes 12% of global greenhouse

10
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:37,719
gases including 30% of anthropogenic

11
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:41,719
methane worldwide varying across

12
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:44,200
production systems and regions about 88%

13
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:47,039
of these emissions come from anic

14
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:50,719
digestion of ruminants released through

15
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,440
belching the remainder comes from manure

16
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:57,440
greenhouse gases including methane

17
00:00:53,440 --> 00:01:00,840
contribute to global warming and climate

18
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,920
change while today low to Middle inome

19
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:04,600
countries and high inome countries

20
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,240
produce around the same amount of

21
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:12,000
livestock methane emissions it is

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:14,400
expected that by 2050 66% of global

23
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,280
livestock emissions will be from Low

24
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:20,720
Middle inome countries as populations

25
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,040
and incomes grow this means that we must

26
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,840
work to ensure that the development of

27
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,920
the sector occurs along a low emissions

28
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,799
pathway countries need to reduce methane

29
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:35,600
from livestock digestion and manure to

30
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,000
hit their climate targets and transition

31
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,680
to more sustainable and efficient

32
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:40,680
livestock

33
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:47,640
production most currently available

34
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:50,680
methane reducing Technologies Target

35
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:54,000
feed Technologies include methane

36
00:01:50,680 --> 00:01:57,079
Inhibitors tanniferous forages lipid

37
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,360
diet supplementation concentrate feeds

38
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:01,759
and genetic selection of animals that

39
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,520
produce less methane from their

40
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:06,920
food it's the microbes in ruminant

41
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:10,239
stomachs which produce the methane and

42
00:02:06,920 --> 00:02:13,200
there are ways to alter this methane

43
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,680
Inhibitors that Target these microbes

44
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:18,120
can reduce methane emissions by an

45
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,640
average 30% per

46
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:24,879
cow one of the most promising is B

47
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:28,400
scientifically known as three nitrooxy

48
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:32,080
propanol B has been developed by Swiss

49
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:36,120
Dutch company d SM fermanich and is now

50
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:36,120
approved for use in more than 50

51
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,840
countries for systems where livestock

52
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,560
mainly feed through grazing pasture and

53
00:02:42,840 --> 00:02:47,840
rangelands the only effective approach

54
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:50,879
is to increase the productivity of the

55
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:53,519
animal through climate smart livestock

56
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,760
practices this includes improving feed

57
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,200
and forage Animal Health pasture and

58
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:00,680
rangeland

59
00:02:58,200 --> 00:03:04,159
management we can produce emissions from

60
00:03:00,680 --> 00:03:07,200
manure using simple interventions like

61
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:10,120
managing moisture and oxygen levels

62
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:13,040
microbes which don't need oxygen can

63
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:16,000
convert methane into biogas which has a

64
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,560
double benefit as it can also save use

65
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,560
of fossil

66
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:23,400
fuels what is needed to develop and

67
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,640
scale these

68
00:03:23,400 --> 00:03:28,439
Technologies first we need more testing

69
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,480
in different livestock production

70
00:03:28,439 --> 00:03:34,480
contexts to take many Technologies from

71
00:03:31,480 --> 00:03:38,080
early stages to practical implementation

72
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:40,519
at scale secondly we need government

73
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,120
policies and incentives such as

74
00:03:40,519 --> 00:03:46,360
subsidies to reduce the cost of

75
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:49,280
Technologies together with regulatory

76
00:03:46,360 --> 00:03:51,200
standards thirdly Farmers need to know

77
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,799
about the Technologies and require

78
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:56,480
training on how to use them taking into

79
00:03:53,799 --> 00:03:59,920
consideration social and cultural

80
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,159
norms and fourthly we need to remove

81
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:05,840
financial and Market constraints for

82
00:04:03,159 --> 00:04:09,000
producers we need more private sector

83
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:11,680
investment and public sector

84
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:13,439
incentives consumers need the price of

85
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,680
animal products produced in a

86
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:19,239
sustainable way to be kept

87
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,400
low if we're going to successfully

88
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:23,720
reduce livestock emissions the

89
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,560
International Community needs to come

90
00:04:23,720 --> 00:04:29,759
together we need to share good practices

91
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:31,600
and Innovation we need policy Solutions

92
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:34,080
that encourage the private sector to

93
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,880
invest and research to fill gaps in

94
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:39,680
knowledge on livestock and

95
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:42,400
climate investing in climate smart

96
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,840
livestock practices is the best way to

97
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:47,280
reduce methane emissions in low to

98
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,080
Middle inome countries whilst also

99
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,840
improving livestock health and

100
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,520
productivity by doing so we not only

101
00:04:52,840 --> 00:04:58,560
help farmers adapt to climate change but

102
00:04:55,520 --> 00:05:01,560
we also reduce livestock's carbon

103
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
footprint
