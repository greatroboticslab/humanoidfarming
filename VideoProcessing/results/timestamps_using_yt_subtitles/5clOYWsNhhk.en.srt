2
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:14,799
holland is pretty crowdy

3
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:15,759
our land is quite expensive labor is

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:17,119
expensive

5
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,880
so we have to be as efficient as

6
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:20,240
possible we have to be more efficient

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,400
than others to compete

8
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:31,359
and that competition drives innovation

9
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:34,399
and technology

10
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,360
we decided to go for not more hectares

11
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,719
but for more yield protector and that's

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:40,480
the moment that we start

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,239
looking into precision ag precision

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160
technology

15
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:59,280
a lot of people think it's science

16
00:00:44,160 --> 00:01:01,280
fiction but it really is not

17
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,199
we have only important in all factors

18
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:05,360
and we're producing around 100 million

19
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,040
tomatoes a year

20
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,439
the idea about this greenhouse is we

21
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,680
even use less water we use 50 less

22
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,439
energy

23
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,040
our tomato plants grow in hydroponic

24
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,400
system so we know for sure that

25
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,320
everything is clean and we can steer

26
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:20,080
everything very precisely

27
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:24,320
we use all the new techniques and all

28
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,320
the innovations with a minimum impact on

29
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
environment

30
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,840
my definition of precision farming is

31
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:38,159
doing the right thing

32
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,159
on the right moment on the right place

33
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,240
of course we're more sustainable because

34
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:45,280
we use less input and that's

35
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,840
economically good for me

36
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:50,159
we use a range of technology we are

37
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:51,200
using soil scans that measure the soil

38
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,439
quality

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,520
and the availability for nutrients in

40
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,119
the soil and then the thermal cameras

41
00:01:55,520 --> 00:02:00,640
can detect diseases

42
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,880
or water stress implementing

43
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:08,449
precision farming is a way of getting a

44
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:13,689
better yield and a better quality

45
00:02:08,449 --> 00:02:13,689
[Music]

46
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
i still believe that farming is the job

47
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,800
of the future

48
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,080
there will be more people more amounts

49
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:26,319
to feed and less area

50
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,440
we have to expand the yields of our food

51
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,200
that much

52
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:32,239
that we actually need the precision

53
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:32,239
farming to do that

54
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,160
sometimes sustainable solutions are

55
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,599
costing a bit more on the short term but

56
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:40,959
on the long term they should be more

57
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,920
effective and that's actually what we

58
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,440
are seeing

59
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:51,840
you need to have the guts to invest in

60
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:51,840
those kind of things for the long term

61
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,680
