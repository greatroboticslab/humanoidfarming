00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:34,879
Kamal actually uh this is a this is a

32
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:37,360
farmer of the BR we have a collaborative

33
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:42,319
we have partner NGO BR as as I told the

34
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:44,280
seven NG working with us uh like uh BR I

35
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:46,280
mentioned the inter Corporation partner

36
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,040
like solidity there is also the ex

37
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:50,920
director of solidarity the seedling

38
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,239
planted and the same plant remain and

39
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:55,959
then new

40
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,959
form both

41
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:01,800
both question is how much of this will

00:03:04,519 --> 00:03:06,959
will he

45
00:03:23,879 --> 00:03:31,280
sell so he answered because it's a new

46
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:33,959
variety many people asked him for this

47
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:37,560
seed so he said he will not

48
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:42,480
eat so he will keep the

49
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:42,480
SE so that he can distribute to other

50
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:48,239

hello thank you 1 2

89
00:07:45,319 --> 00:07:52,520
three one

90
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:52,520
more can I make it smaller P somehow

91
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,280
yes he wants to know that he could see

92
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:32,399
that the subn is very good is there any

93
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:35,399
special technology required to grow

94
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:37,039
someone that he has got down that if you

95
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:39,080
can get there is some other different

96
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:42,719
technology

97
00:08:39,080 --> 00:08:46,120
then so that you can get more or it is

98
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:46,120
the technology same

99
00:08:46,519 --> 00:08:53,640
as the the the suban variety uh behaves

100
00:08:51,279 --> 00:08:57,560
the suban SW behaves the same way as

101
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:59,440
swna so you can grow the uh the

102
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:01,720
varieties in the same condition if

103
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:04,519
there's no flooding they will behave

104
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:08,120
exactly the same if there's a flooding

105
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:10,560
then the SW someone will survive better

106
00:09:08,120 --> 00:09:12,680
but otherwise they they perform exactly

107
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,680
the

108
00:09:23,399 --> 00:09:28,480
same one is because in in in the other

109
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,360
tries it didn't really obviously there

110
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:35,120
was a problem with with

111
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:35,120
s survival is not the problem problem is

112
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:43,600
the how many days under

113
00:09:38,279 --> 00:09:46,959
watering it may not actually 12 we are

114
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:48,279
seeing the check to die it is not then

115
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:50,800
we are

116
00:09:48,279 --> 00:09:56,279
dising no actually

117
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:56,279
pan panicle ex is not good
