but coming into contact with a moving

3
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:17,880
part hurts a whole lot more

00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,380

death

every year of all work accidents contact

00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,599
with moving parts of a machine cause an

00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:29,359
average of 20 deaths 300 amputations and

9
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,560
more than a thousand fractures

10
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:33,600
construction professionals are

11
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,960
particularly at risk because of all the

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,059
equipment we use in our everyday work

13
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,219
as a construction professional you

14
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:42,960
should already know how to avoid and

15
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:45,079
control the risk of injury from contact

16
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,579
with a moving part

17
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:50,820
since there can be serious consequences

18
00:00:47,579 --> 00:00:52,620
and there are several ways to prevent it

19
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,140
the risk of injury from contact with

20
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,559
moving Parts is considered zero

22
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:01,980
on a construction site there's a lot of

23
00:01:00,360 --> 00:01:03,480
machinery and powered equipment with

24
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,820
moving parts

25
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:08,460
that's why it's essential to prevent or

26
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:10,560
control access to moving parts

27
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:12,920
on some machinery and equipment the

28
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:16,020
moving Parts must be made 100

29
00:01:12,920 --> 00:01:18,060
inaccessible even during operation

30
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:20,520
these machines must be equipped with

31
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:23,280
guards or safety devices that completely

32
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:25,320
prevent access to moving parts

00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,299
on other machinery and equipment contact

34
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:29,759
with moving Parts can't be prevented

35
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:32,400
during operation in which case access

36
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,560
can only be controlled all such

37
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,140
Machinery must be equipped with guards

38
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:38,759
and or safety devices

40
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,979
regularly check that all safety devices

are in place in good condition and

42
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:48,500
undamaged and working properly

and also never tamper with a guard or

49

safety device such as overriding the

maintenance such as a blade replacement

53
00:02:17,180 --> 00:02:24,360
you should at minimum unplug it

54
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,879
or remove the battery in some cases a

55
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:29,220
lockout will be required

56
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,280
and on top of having compliant equipment

57
00:02:29,220 --> 00:02:34,980
you have to use it properly too

58
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:36,000
one wrong move during operation can be

59
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,160
fatal

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,260
this is why it's so important to
