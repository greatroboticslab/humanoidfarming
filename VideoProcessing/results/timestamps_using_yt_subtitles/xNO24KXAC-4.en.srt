[Music]

4
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,880
Namaste and welcome to the video course

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,000
on watershed management. Today in module

6
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:26,000
two on sustainable watershed approach

7
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,000
and watershed management practices. In

8
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,400
lecture number five, we will discuss

9
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,719
about the agriculture practices and

10
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,280
watershed management.

11
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,000
So the topics covered in today's lecture

12
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,239
includes watershed ecology and

13
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:42,480
agroecosystems, soil and water

14
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,800
conservation management practices,

15
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,039
sustainable land management practices,

16
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,440
crop management, nutrients and pest

17
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,680
management, integrated farming, and

18
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,760
finally a case study. Some of the

19
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,079
important keywords in today's lecture

20
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,399
include agroecosystems,

21
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:03,359
agriculture management, nutrient and

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:07,040
pest management and integrated farming.

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:09,439
So as we discussed in earlier lectures

24
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:12,479
like sustainable water management or

25
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:14,240
sustainable land management or uh the

26
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,759
sustainability issues are all very

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,000
important in in watershed management. So

28
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,240
uh in in any of the waterershed which we

29
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,119
consider one of the important land use

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,119
is the agriculture. So we have to see

31
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,840
what are the important issues as far as

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,680
the uh agricultural management is

33
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
concerned. What are the important issues

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,960
in sustainable agriculture management.

35
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:39,680
So uh as far as watershed uh in many

36
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,759
parts of the world are concerned uh

37
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,240
watersheds are experiencing pressure

38
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,920
from high population growth, climate,

39
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,079
land use change and overexploitations of

40
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:52,000
natural resources. So you can see the

41
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:54,479
effect of population growth and then the

42
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:57,280
land use change all these are directly

43
00:01:54,479 --> 00:02:00,079
influencing the agricultural practices

44
00:01:57,280 --> 00:02:02,159
uh within the watershed. So as we

45
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:04,960
discussed earlier to stop the

46
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:07,040
degradation of natural resources and to

47
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,920
understand the sustainable agriculture

48
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:12,160
management practices we need to deal

49
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,640
with upstream and downstream resources

50
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,319
management challenges. So what are the

51
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:17,599
major challenges within the waterershed

52
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,280
as far as various resources are

53
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,840
concerned how we deal with the uh the

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,440
management of those resources. Then uh

55
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,440
the sustainable agriculture management

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:30,879
is concerned. Uh we have to deal with

57
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,360
the uh to identify sustainable land use

58
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,599
practices to increase sustainable

59
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:38,000
agriculture production uh and to

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,920
increase opportunity of rural

61
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:43,599
livelihood. So we can see that in most

62
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:45,599
of the the uh areas the rural people are

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,239
living mainly based upon the

64
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:51,040
agricultural or the farm outputs. So we

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:54,160
have to improve this farm output in a

66
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:57,040
sustainable way. So uh for that on a

67
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:59,599
watershed basis we have to see that the

68
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:02,400
agriculture is sustaining and then the

69
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,959
the the land use is sustainable and

70
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,920
water use is sustainable. So uh within

71
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:11,200
that we have to see that how we can have

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:13,280
better uh agricultural or agriculture

73
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,599
water management or agricultural

74
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:18,080
practices. So let us see some of the

75
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,239
issues as far as water management in

76
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,239
agriculture is concerned. So this uh

77
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
deals with the interactions and

78
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,519
interplay between food, people and

79
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
nature sectors. So we have already seen

80
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,560
earlier when we discussed about the

81
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:35,840
sustainability issues. So the important

82
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:39,200
sectors are food, people and nature. So

83
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:42,799
out of this the food sector produces

84
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,640
biomass and influence ecosystem most of

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:46,159
the time positively and sometimes

86
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:47,840
negatively.

87
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:51,440
So you can see that as far as

88
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:54,799
agriculture is concerned the water is

89
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:58,480
concerned major use is consumptive. So

90
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:01,280
this is uh can be directly through

91
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,120
irrigation or otherwise. So as far as

92
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:06,799
irrigation is concerned there can be

93
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:10,400
major or micro irrigation and many times

94
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:13,040
farmers use excessive irrigation and say

95
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:16,639
this irriated water

96
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:19,359
are largely uh recycled. Then some of

97
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,000
the other issues like use of fertilizers

98
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:24,400
and pesticides and then corresponding uh

99
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,280
problems like non-point source of

100
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:30,320
pollution in the water either surface or

101
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:33,520
groundwater. So like this we can see

102
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:35,360
that agricultural water use is concerned

103
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:38,320
a large number of issues are there which

104
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:40,160
we have to deal um as far as the

105
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:42,639
particular watershed is concerned or

106
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:45,120
waterershed management is concerned. So

107
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:47,759
uh you can see that when we consider the

108
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,160
the three sectors like food people and

109
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:54,000
nature. So the requirement of water for

110
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,800
the people is relatively small. uh so uh

111
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:59,520
you can see that say for example if you

112
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,360
can see 1 cm per hectare per day for as

113
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,600
far as irrigation water is concerned

114
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:06,400
that much water is sufficient for uh

115
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:10,639
thousand people domestic or other

116
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:13,120
usages. So if you consider say the world

117
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,960
average as far as agricultural municipal

118
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:19,440
and industrial water usage is concerned

119
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:21,520
the ratio is 70 to 15 to 15%. But say

120
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:26,080
for example in developing country like

121
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:29,600
India this usage is 85% for agricultural

122
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:31,440
uh only 8% for municipal use and 7% for

123
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:33,199
uh industrial sector. So that way you

124
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:36,320
can see that say for example in a

125
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,280
country like India major portion of the

126
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:43,680
water is used for agriculture purposes.

127
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:46,880
So if we can save uh the water available

128
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:49,120
water say by doing appropriate

129
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,440
agriculture management practices

130
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:55,759
effective water use in agriculture then

131
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:57,520
we can save lot of water. So uh but you

132
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:01,600
can see that in most of the time

133
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:03,840
whenever uh we consider the farming

134
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:06,560
sector for a sustainable agriculture we

135
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:10,160
need irrigation since as we discussed

136
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:13,360
earlier the rainfall is

137
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:15,680
say distributed only for say four or

138
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:17,280
five months. So time wise variation is

139
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,800
there then special wise variation is

140
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,560
there. So that way we need um regression

141
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:27,520
for sustainable agriculture. uh so that

142
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:29,360
way if you consider say for example the

143
00:06:27,520 --> 00:06:31,680
global withdrawal of water for

144
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,479
agriculture industry and municipal use

145
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:38,000
and then its total use uh in liter say

146
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:40,960
for example the data from 1900 to 1995

147
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:44,080
for about 95 years you can see that uh

148
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,240
this uh curve shows the total withdrawal

149
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:49,199
and then you can see that this just

150
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:51,520
below this this curve shows the

151
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,440
agricultural withdrawal and the

152
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,039
municipal usage usage age is much

153
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,759
smaller. This white line shows the

154
00:06:55,039 --> 00:07:00,400
municipal usage and then this gray line

155
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,319
shows the industrial usage. But

156
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,199
especially in agriculture lot of water

157
00:07:02,319 --> 00:07:07,199
is lost in different ways. So that way

158
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:09,840
with respect to the total withdrawal you

159
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,319
can see that the effective

160
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,720
water the total water usage is much much

161
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:17,759
less compared to the total withdrawal.

162
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:22,080
So that way if we can save the water

163
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:24,400
which we are using for agriculture by

164
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:27,039
appropriate management practices approp

165
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:29,599
optimal irrigation management practices

166
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:31,759
we can save lot of water and that can be

167
00:07:29,599 --> 00:07:34,800
utilized for many other purposes and

168
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:36,880
then also we can use say for for example

169
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,599
for further irrigation and other

170
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,639
purposes. So if you consider a world

171
00:07:39,599 --> 00:07:44,720
average the world average for irrigation

172
00:07:42,639 --> 00:07:47,759
is concerned irrigated area covers about

173
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:49,840
40% of arable lands in the world and

174
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:53,440
rainfford is the rest that means about

175
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:56,319
60% of the uh arable land in the world

176
00:07:53,440 --> 00:08:00,160
is say the water is obtained through

177
00:07:56,319 --> 00:08:03,039
rain and only 40% is obtained through uh

178
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:05,440
irrigation. Say for example now if you

179
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,840
consider India's agriculture scenario

180
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,000
and irrigation is concerned uh so India

181
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:15,360
has about 2% of world's land 4% of fresh

182
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,639
water 16% of population and 10% of its

183
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,000
cattle so this is the the major issue as

184
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:24,080
far as a developing country like India

185
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:27,840
is concerned we have only 2% of ranch uh

186
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:31,520
but we have 16% of population and then

187
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:33,440
10% of cattle and only hardly 4% % of

188
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,200
fresh water and the geographic areas

189
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:38,719
concerned

190
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:44,159
say India's 329 million hectare of area

191
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:46,800
of which only 47% is cultivated 23 23%

192
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:50,320
is is forested and 7% under

193
00:08:46,800 --> 00:08:53,040
non-aggriculture usage and about 23% of

194
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:55,120
the land is wasteland

195
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:56,720
and uh if you consider with respect the

196
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,480
population the land availability is

197
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:01,519
concerned per capita availability of

198
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:05,600
land 50 years ago that means In about

199
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:08,240
1950s it was about 0.9 hectare but now

200
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,279
due to the population explosion uh this

201
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,920
will be reduced to about.14 hectare by

202
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:15,839
2050. So that way the land availability

203
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:18,320
compared to any other country it is much

204
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,440
much smaller. So that way India is a

205
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:25,360
major problem as far as the the the

206
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:27,920
sustainable practices as far as land um

207
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,320
water and agriculture is concerned. So

208
00:09:27,920 --> 00:09:32,399
whatever available we have to do it in a

209
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:36,160
better way and out of the cultivated

210
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,120
area in India uh about 47 40% is

211
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:42,160
irrigated which produces about 55% of

212
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,240
the food requirement of the country and

213
00:09:42,160 --> 00:09:48,080
60% is rainfford producing uh about 47

214
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:51,040
45%

215
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:54,399
of about 250 metric ton of food required

216
00:09:51,040 --> 00:09:57,440
presently. So you can see that 40% of

217
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:59,760
the reated area produces 55% of the food

218
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:02,959
and 60% of rainfed area only produces

219
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:05,760
45% of the the 250 metric t of food

220
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:09,839
produced. So in 40 years say for example

221
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:12,240
by 2050 uh say government of India wants

222
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:15,279
to increase the reation level such such

223
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:18,880
that we can have more food production.

224
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:22,480
So the irrigation we we want to increase

225
00:10:18,880 --> 00:10:25,440
up to at least up to 50% so that 50% is

226
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,320
um irrigated area and 50% is of the

227
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:32,000
arable land is um the rainfford area so

228
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:35,279
that that ratio of food production 75%

229
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:38,480
can be produced from reed land and 25%

230
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,600
from the rainfford land for out of the

231
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:44,480
500 metric t of food required by uh

232
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:47,440
2050. So this is the Indian scenario as

233
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:51,040
far as the the agriculture and uh

234
00:10:47,440 --> 00:10:53,440
irrigation requirement uh is concerned.

235
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:56,000
So now uh let us see what are some of

236
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:58,560
the uh the agriculture related issues as

237
00:10:56,000 --> 00:11:01,519
far as um especially India is concerned.

238
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:03,200
So uh in India after the independence in

239
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,200
1947

240
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,440
uh there is

241
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:10,720
large increase in agricultural growth

242
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,240
rate. Say for example in the 1950s if it

243
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:17,440
was about.3% 60s and 70s or 80s it has

244
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,200
increased to 3.5%. So this has mainly

245
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,760
happened due to a large number of

246
00:11:19,200 --> 00:11:24,399
irriation or reservoir projects

247
00:11:21,760 --> 00:11:27,200
implemented in the earlier five-year

248
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:29,839
plans. So that way the irriation

249
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:32,640
capacity has increased and that way the

250
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:35,920
agricultural growth has increased. So

251
00:11:32,640 --> 00:11:38,640
then another important issue is say say

252
00:11:35,920 --> 00:11:41,200
in the la the first first few five year

253
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:44,640
plans say in 70s and 80s government of

254
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:46,160
India put a lot of efforts to uh improve

255
00:11:44,640 --> 00:11:47,920
the agriculture sector through

256
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,800
introduction of new high yielding

257
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,200
varieties that is say we can call it as

258
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:55,760
first green revolution in ' 70s and then

259
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:59,519
in second green revolution say in ' 80s

260
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:01,760
uh government of India through its

261
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,600
agriculture and other ministries concent

262
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:06,880
center on the genetic engineering uh

263
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:09,360
through organized input management and u

264
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:13,040
say farmer services and extension and

265
00:12:09,360 --> 00:12:15,680
then also um better seed varieties were

266
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:19,360
implemented in the agriculture sector.

267
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:22,480
So that way we can call this um say

268
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,720
1980s as second green revolution. So

269
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,920
that way lot of improvement were taken

270
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:30,160
place in the agriculture sector but of

271
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:32,000
course lot of issues are still there uh

272
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,000
in the agriculture sector. So some of

273
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,720
the negative trends in spite of the

274
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,880
positive trends as we discussed here the

275
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,279
negative trends are say per hector yield

276
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:44,320
is low. So compared to other countries

277
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:46,800
like uh USA and China the per hector

278
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,680
yield is much lower. Then infrastructure

279
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:54,000
facilities in the farming sector sector

280
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:56,880
are concerned are poor. Then uh say the

281
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:59,200
uh total management aspect is neglected

282
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:02,560
in most of the farming sector. And then

283
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,079
also uh you can see that still in rural

284
00:13:02,560 --> 00:13:07,120
area

285
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:11,760
the farming is not mechanized. So people

286
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:16,000
are using different types of traditional

287
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,959
equipments for farming and then say most

288
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:21,839
of the time the rural farmers are not

289
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:25,440
adopting scientific farming. uh so that

290
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:28,240
way uh say lot of issues are there as

291
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:30,000
far as the agriculture in India is

292
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:32,639
concerned.

293
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,959
So uh some of the important constraint

294
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:36,880
as far as agriculture

295
00:13:34,959 --> 00:13:40,560
sustainable agriculture India are

296
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,639
concerned are listed here. So these are

297
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,240
decline in per capita land availability.

298
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,920
So as we already discussed that per

299
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:48,720
capita land availability is decreasing

300
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:51,440
due to population explosion. Then stress

301
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:54,160
in water resources. So available water

302
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:58,160
uh is not sufficient for irrigation um

303
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,920
due to lack of um say better agriculture

304
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:02,480
management practices, water management

305
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,959
practices or lack of availability of

306
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:07,680
sufficient water. Then degradation of

307
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,240
soils, the lack of efficient water

308
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,959
management, uh monocropping in many

309
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,519
areas farmers are with the same crop. So

310
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:17,680
that way uh there are lot of problems as

311
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:20,000
far as nutrient management and then

312
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:22,480
other soil related issues are concerned.

313
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,279
Then lack of crop management um

314
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:28,880
negligence of sustainable agriculture.

315
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:31,920
So um say as far as especially most of

316
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:33,839
the farmers are concerned they are not

317
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:35,839
bothered about the sustainability issues

318
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:39,760
as far as agriculture is concerned. And

319
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:43,519
then of course people's a that means the

320
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,320
farmers are indifferent to various the

321
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:49,120
scientific farming or mechanization and

322
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:52,160
other issues due to of course various

323
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:54,560
other constraints um the due to lack of

324
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:57,920
availabable resources or due to lack of

325
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:59,839
education and other issues. So that way

326
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:02,079
these are some of the important issues

327
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:04,160
especially in a country like India as

328
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:07,279
far as sustainable agricultural

329
00:15:04,160 --> 00:15:10,240
management practices are concerned.

330
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:12,720
So now let us see the water the

331
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,760
agriculture management practices within

332
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:17,920
the perspective of watershed. So the we

333
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,760
have already seen that uh agriculture

334
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:22,560
practices are very important in in any

335
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:25,199
of the watershed management plans. So uh

336
00:15:22,560 --> 00:15:28,240
the agricultural practices

337
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:31,360
following within a watershed uh the the

338
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:33,279
the whatever waterershed plans or

339
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:35,920
management issues we are making. So that

340
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,160
will definitely uh affect. So that way

341
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:41,519
let us discuss about the watershed

342
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,160
ecohydrology and agroecosystems.

343
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:47,120
So this agroecosystems uh we can define

344
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,759
as a subset of ecosystems

345
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:52,560
that defines functional uh

346
00:15:49,759 --> 00:15:55,040
representation of coherent agricultural

347
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:57,120
activity uh including interaction of

348
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,920
living and non-living components

349
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,440
involved uh within the uh watershed. So

350
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,240
we are considering a subset of the

351
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:07,519
ecosystems as agroecosystems.

352
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:10,000
uh then we can do various sonation

353
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:12,639
according to the the ecology according

354
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:15,839
to agriculture practices and the climate

355
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:18,560
system. So that way we can call these

356
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:22,000
zones as agroecological zones which are

357
00:16:18,560 --> 00:16:25,040
defined as uh land units carved out of

358
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:27,839
agroclimatic zones based on major

359
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:30,240
climate superimposed on length of

360
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:34,880
growing period. So so particular crop is

361
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:37,199
concerned a particular uh say climate

362
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:40,560
season is concerned. So accordingly we

363
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:44,000
can say define this agroecological

364
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:46,959
zones. So this mainly depends up on the

365
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:51,279
moisture availability. Say for example

366
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:54,639
India is concerned we can classify uh

367
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:59,040
India into 20 agroecological regions and

368
00:16:54,639 --> 00:17:02,720
60 agroeco sub regions. So as we defined

369
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:05,839
here agroecological zones indicate uh

370
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,839
the various uh issues as far as the

371
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:09,600
agriculture is concerned with respect to

372
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:13,039
land with respect to climate and other

373
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:16,079
issues. So each agro eco sub region has

374
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:18,959
further been classified into eco unit at

375
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:21,120
district level for developing long-term

376
00:17:18,959 --> 00:17:22,799
land use strategies. So when we

377
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:24,640
discussed about the sustainable

378
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:27,439
agriculture practices these

379
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:29,039
agroecosystem or agroecological zones

380
00:17:27,439 --> 00:17:32,160
are very important since we can

381
00:17:29,039 --> 00:17:35,600
implement or we can sort out many issues

382
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:38,080
uh by considering these agroecological

383
00:17:35,600 --> 00:17:41,360
zones or agroecological

384
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:43,760
uh sub regions as we discussed. So here

385
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:46,160
in this slide you can see the

386
00:17:43,760 --> 00:17:48,720
agroecological regions of India. So

387
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:52,720
these various colors indicate various

388
00:17:48,720 --> 00:17:56,799
zones. So these zones are delineated

389
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:59,760
based on physioraphy, soil, u length of

390
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:03,200
growing season and bioclimate of the

391
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:05,520
region. Say for example we can say uh

392
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:08,799
the agriculture ministry has put various

393
00:18:05,520 --> 00:18:11,919
nominal culture also. So for example a

394
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:17,039
zone means say a son is called aer zone.

395
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:20,400
So there the it is numbered as A13 EH1 A

396
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:24,000
stands for physioraphy 13 stands for

397
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:27,520
soil scale. EH stands for bioclimatic

398
00:18:24,000 --> 00:18:30,640
zone and one st stands for length of

399
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:33,039
growing period. So that way we can put

400
00:18:30,640 --> 00:18:37,600
various agroecological

401
00:18:33,039 --> 00:18:41,600
zones. Uh so AE zone A13 EH1 is referred

402
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:43,200
as western Himalayas here. So the some

403
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:46,960
of the important characteristics of the

404
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:49,120
zones shallow skelectal soils hyper

405
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:52,160
climates with the length of growing

406
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:54,720
period less than uh 60 days. So that way

407
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:58,720
by by considering this agroecological

408
00:18:54,720 --> 00:19:00,960
zones uh we can uh look into various um

409
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:04,480
sustainable agricultural practices or

410
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:06,400
issues and then we can go for planning

411
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,080
and management. It can be watershed

412
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:10,240
based planning and management but by

413
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:14,320
considering these type of zones we can

414
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:17,039
implement or we can have various plans.

415
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:18,960
So as we discussed so what are the

416
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,200
necessities or what are the need of

417
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:24,160
agricological classification. So the

418
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:26,880
needs are listed here. Uh to assess

419
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:29,200
yield potentialities of different crops,

420
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:32,160
crop combination in agroecological

421
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:35,280
regions or zones. Then to formulate

422
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:38,000
future plan of action involving crop

423
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:40,480
diversification to disseminate uh

424
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:44,080
agricultural uh research and agro

425
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:45,679
technology to other homogeneous areas.

426
00:19:44,080 --> 00:19:48,480
And then to determine the crop

427
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:51,440
suitability for optimization of land use

428
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,960
in different agroecological regions or

429
00:19:51,440 --> 00:19:59,440
zones. So as we discussed so this

430
00:19:54,960 --> 00:20:02,320
agroecological region or zones um uh say

431
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:04,400
indicates say what kind of crops say

432
00:20:02,320 --> 00:20:07,760
what kind of climate

433
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:11,919
climatic region or what kind of soil

434
00:20:07,760 --> 00:20:14,000
pattern is there then we can put plants

435
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,720
say like what kind of crops can be grown

436
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,320
there what should be the crop period

437
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:22,160
length so like that various issue can be

438
00:20:20,320 --> 00:20:24,320
put according to the agricological ical

439
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:26,880
classification or agricological zones or

440
00:20:24,320 --> 00:20:29,760
regions and then we can come up with the

441
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:32,320
plans as far as sustainable agriculture

442
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:34,640
practices are concerned.

443
00:20:32,320 --> 00:20:36,640
So now uh as far as sustainable

444
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,960
agriculture practices are concerned soil

445
00:20:36,640 --> 00:20:41,760
conservation and water conservations are

446
00:20:38,960 --> 00:20:43,440
two important issues. So let us look

447
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:46,400
into some of the important principles

448
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,640
and issues as far as soil and water

449
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,960
conservation are concerned. So soil

450
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:54,080
conservation important principles are

451
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:56,960
based upon rainfall of high intensity

452
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:59,600
then erosion of top fertile soil takes

453
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:03,039
place. So we have to stop this soil

454
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:05,760
erosion. So that is uh uh the so by

455
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:08,480
various practices we can reduce the soil

456
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:11,919
erosion. So that is the so-called soil

457
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:15,440
conservation. So we can have uh various

458
00:21:11,919 --> 00:21:17,120
measures like condor farming and then

459
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:20,640
say

460
00:21:17,120 --> 00:21:22,159
we can plant trees or grass to reduce

461
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,440
the soil conservation. So various

462
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:27,520
measures are measures are possible like

463
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,960
biological measures like a conservation

464
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:33,200
tillage deep conservation farming and we

465
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:36,960
can go for mechanical measures like

466
00:21:33,200 --> 00:21:40,640
terasing uh water disposal uh other low

467
00:21:36,960 --> 00:21:43,120
cost measures. So like shown here we can

468
00:21:40,640 --> 00:21:45,760
say reduce the soil erosion and we can

469
00:21:43,120 --> 00:21:48,720
go for soil conservation using uh

470
00:21:45,760 --> 00:21:51,039
various uh techniques. So then as far as

471
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,640
water conservation is concerned the

472
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,960
principle of the water conservation is

473
00:21:54,640 --> 00:21:58,960
say where precipitation is less than

474
00:21:56,960 --> 00:22:01,840
crop requirements what what we have to

475
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:03,440
do. So uh then where precipitation is

476
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,760
equal to crop requirement or where

477
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:08,960
precipitation is in excess of crop

478
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:11,360
requirements. So accordingly uh these

479
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:14,320
three classes we can uh have a

480
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,520
particular um say intervention or

481
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,720
particular uh strategy uh say according

482
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:24,080
to the the climatic or rainfall

483
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,520
conditions. So in the first case where

484
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:28,080
precipitation is less than crop

485
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:30,960
requirement the strategy includes land

486
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:33,200
treatment to increase runoff onto

487
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,600
cropped areas uh following water

488
00:22:33,200 --> 00:22:38,559
conservation use of drought tolerant

489
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,360
crops uh suitable managing practices. So

490
00:22:38,559 --> 00:22:44,400
this is when the precipitation is less

491
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:46,960
than crop requirement. Then second case

492
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:49,280
where precipitation is equal to crop

493
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:52,080
requirement. So the strategy is local

494
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:54,880
conservation of precipitation maximizing

495
00:22:52,080 --> 00:22:58,000
storage within the soil profile and

496
00:22:54,880 --> 00:23:01,120
storage of excess runoff for subsequent

497
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:04,799
use. So this is when precipitation is

498
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:06,880
almost equal to what is required as far

499
00:23:04,799 --> 00:23:09,280
as crop requirements are concerned. And

500
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,280
then the third case uh where

501
00:23:09,280 --> 00:23:14,559
precipitation is in excess of crop

502
00:23:11,280 --> 00:23:17,200
requirements the strategy is to reduce

503
00:23:14,559 --> 00:23:20,640
uh rainfall erosion to drain surplus

504
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:24,240
runoff and store the surplus water for

505
00:23:20,640 --> 00:23:26,799
subsequent uh use in summer season. So

506
00:23:24,240 --> 00:23:30,320
this way as far as uh water conservation

507
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:32,240
is concerned we can uh make particular

508
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:34,640
strategy depending upon the region

509
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:36,720
depending upon the case. Uh we can have

510
00:23:34,640 --> 00:23:38,480
either whenever precipitation is less

511
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,000
than crop requirement or whenever

512
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:44,240
precipitation uh is almost equal to crop

513
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:45,760
requirement or when precipitation is in

514
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:48,640
excess of crop requirement. So

515
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:51,679
accordingly uh we can go for particular

516
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:54,720
strategy as far as water conservation is

517
00:23:51,679 --> 00:23:57,440
concerned. So now uh based upon uh these

518
00:23:54,720 --> 00:24:00,320
issues now let us uh discuss the

519
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:03,200
sustainable land management practices.

520
00:24:00,320 --> 00:24:05,600
So we have seen the for to achieve

521
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,520
sustainable agriculture practices um we

522
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:10,159
need to go for sustainable land

523
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:12,640
management practices. So uh sustainable

524
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:16,320
land management practices

525
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:19,440
that gives um knowledge based it is a

526
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:23,279
knowledge based system which helps to

527
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:25,919
integrate land water biodiversity and

528
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,880
environmental management to meet rising

529
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:31,919
food and fiber demands while sustaining

530
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,400
ecosystem services and livelihood to

531
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:37,039
meet requirements for the growing

532
00:24:34,400 --> 00:24:38,880
population. So we can uh define the

533
00:24:37,039 --> 00:24:42,320
sustainable land management like this.

534
00:24:38,880 --> 00:24:45,760
So it is a holistic way of sustainable

535
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,880
approach as far as land water uh

536
00:24:45,760 --> 00:24:51,360
biodiversity environmental management

537
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:54,400
and then uh say the requirement as far

538
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:56,480
as the growing population is concerned.

539
00:24:54,400 --> 00:25:00,240
So this sustainable land management or

540
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:04,400
SLM enhances the productive capabilities

541
00:25:00,240 --> 00:25:06,880
of land in crop and grazed area. So if

542
00:25:04,400 --> 00:25:10,000
you consider the various issues

543
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:13,679
appropriately and we can increase uh the

544
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:16,400
productivity uh the crop yield and then

545
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:19,360
forest forestry can be improved or the

546
00:25:16,400 --> 00:25:21,919
the grass land or grazed area can be

547
00:25:19,360 --> 00:25:24,640
imbroved. So through sustainable land

548
00:25:21,919 --> 00:25:28,159
management uh we can have actions to

549
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:31,120
stop reversed degradation or at least to

550
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:33,679
mitigate adverse effects of uh earlier

551
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:37,039
misuses. So whenever we discussed about

552
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:39,840
the waterershed deterioration issues and

553
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:43,200
related problems uh we have seen that uh

554
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:48,480
say here say the waterershed will be

555
00:25:43,200 --> 00:25:51,600
degraded say by various problems various

556
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:53,200
issues as we discussed earlier. So uh

557
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:56,080
through sustainable land management

558
00:25:53,200 --> 00:25:58,080
practices we can at least uh reduce what

559
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,440
is happening and then also we can

560
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:05,360
reverse the trends so that uh we can

561
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:08,159
have same overall uh sustainable uh

562
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:09,919
development. So now let us look into

563
00:26:08,159 --> 00:26:11,679
what are the objectives as far as

564
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,360
sustainable land management practice are

565
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:16,960
concerned. Some of the important

566
00:26:13,360 --> 00:26:18,799
objectives are listed here to increase

567
00:26:16,960 --> 00:26:22,159
land productivity. So that means

568
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,279
replenish soil nutrients uh by lying or

569
00:26:22,159 --> 00:26:28,080
other means uh and then maintain soil

570
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,200
cover. So like cover we can use cover

571
00:26:28,080 --> 00:26:34,559
crops and residue recycling. And the

572
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,159
second objective is to provide adequate

573
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:39,840
quantity of water. So there is no

574
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:43,039
scarcity of water. So we can use crop

575
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,520
forage or tree species with higher water

576
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:49,039
use efficiency. So that depending upon

577
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:52,799
the uh available water uh we can uh go

578
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:55,520
for uh say water resource management

579
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,760
using particular crop then to maintain

580
00:26:55,520 --> 00:27:01,200
water quality. So water quality is also

581
00:26:57,760 --> 00:27:03,679
an issue. So uh here we can protect

582
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:05,840
vegetative filter areas in the

583
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:08,720
repairarian zones to remove excess

584
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:11,200
sediment and nutrients and then also the

585
00:27:08,720 --> 00:27:14,720
non-boyant source of pollutions all

586
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:16,960
those we can reduce and then uh third

587
00:27:14,720 --> 00:27:19,919
objective is to reduce flooding and

588
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:23,440
flood damage. So as we discussed earlier

589
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:25,039
flooding is always a problem. So we can

590
00:27:23,440 --> 00:27:26,799
through sustainable agriculture

591
00:27:25,039 --> 00:27:29,279
management practices or sustainable land

592
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,440
management practices we can plant deep

593
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:34,080
rooted weightation to enhance

594
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:36,559
infiltration and water consumption by

595
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:39,360
the plants and this also may decrease

596
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:41,200
the soil erosion problems. So these are

597
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:43,440
some of the important objectives as far

598
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,320
as sustainable uh land management

599
00:27:43,440 --> 00:27:48,159
practice are concerned. So now uh let us

600
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:50,799
look into the sustainable agriculture

601
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:54,880
issues. So first one is the the crop

602
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:58,320
husbandry. So crop husbandry means the

603
00:27:54,880 --> 00:28:00,720
practices of uh growing and harvesting

604
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,039
crops uh based upon scientific

605
00:28:00,720 --> 00:28:06,159
principles and careful management and

606
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:09,360
conservations of uh resources. So

607
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:10,960
whenever the the the cropping pattern so

608
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:13,840
we have to consider the cropping pattern

609
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:17,760
what type of crop is to be used then the

610
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:20,880
various issues uh say as far as soil is

611
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:22,480
concerned water is concerned and then uh

612
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,640
the

613
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:27,360
the health of the crop is concerned. So

614
00:28:24,640 --> 00:28:29,679
here the crop husbandry includes soil

615
00:28:27,360 --> 00:28:33,279
enri en enrichments

616
00:28:29,679 --> 00:28:36,559
usage of hybrid and improved seeds and

617
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:39,120
better cropping pattern. So some of the

618
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:42,480
techniques used for improved crop

619
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,720
productions include uh soil enrichments

620
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,960
by bofertilization.

621
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:50,640
Uh then introduction of micronutrient

622
00:28:46,960 --> 00:28:53,440
management uh then usage of hybrid seeds

623
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:55,279
uh achieving optimum plant population so

624
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:58,640
that better production will be there.

625
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:02,159
Then timely and effective we control. So

626
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:03,919
we say in agricultural practices we be

627
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:07,039
control is very important. So we have to

628
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:09,600
timely do the we control then pest

629
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:12,080
management. So these are some of the uh

630
00:29:09,600 --> 00:29:15,600
important techniques which we can

631
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:18,720
utilize in crop husbandry so that we can

632
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:22,320
achieve sustainable uh agricultural

633
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:25,279
practices as far as various uh crop

634
00:29:22,320 --> 00:29:27,120
management or crop husbandry is uh

635
00:29:25,279 --> 00:29:30,159
concerned.

636
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:33,120
Then uh the next issue in sustainable

637
00:29:30,159 --> 00:29:34,960
agriculture is nutrient management. Uh

638
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,120
so as far as nutrient management is

639
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:41,440
concerned uh it is important to tackle

640
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:44,480
problems like use of inorganic

641
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:48,720
fertilizers. So last few decades farmers

642
00:29:44,480 --> 00:29:52,000
are using lot of inorganic fertilizers

643
00:29:48,720 --> 00:29:55,919
like ura then phosphates

644
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:59,440
like that. So whenever we use

645
00:29:55,919 --> 00:30:01,279
without say optimal use or without

646
00:29:59,440 --> 00:30:04,240
scientific

647
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:06,960
say knowledge then what happens is that

648
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:09,679
it decrease the soil fertility and then

649
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,360
also it become a pollution source as far

650
00:30:09,679 --> 00:30:15,279
as soil and water is concerned. So then

651
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:18,559
other issues as far as nutrient

652
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:22,240
management is concerned to stop uh we

653
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:25,200
growth uh to avoid crop diseases uh

654
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:28,559
improve crop yield. So these are the uh

655
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:31,840
the main uh issues as far as nutrient

656
00:30:28,559 --> 00:30:33,840
management is concerned. Then as far as

657
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:36,640
nutrient management is concerned, it

658
00:30:33,840 --> 00:30:38,720
includes uh disseminate knowledge of

659
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,679
nutrient and its function to plant

660
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:44,159
growth. uh so most of the time say in a

661
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:46,960
country like India the farmers are not

662
00:30:44,159 --> 00:30:49,760
well educated so we can disseminate the

663
00:30:46,960 --> 00:30:51,760
knowledge say why we had to study a

664
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:53,760
nutrient analysis as far as particular

665
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:58,159
area particular waterershed is concerned

666
00:30:53,760 --> 00:31:01,919
and then how to improve the nutrient

667
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:06,960
say in the soil so we can disseminate

668
00:31:01,919 --> 00:31:08,720
the knowledge and then its function say

669
00:31:06,960 --> 00:31:11,440
in plant growth as far as nutrient

670
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:14,159
management is concerned. Then assessment

671
00:31:11,440 --> 00:31:16,240
of nutrient availability as far as the

672
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:18,640
waterershed is concerned and then

673
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:21,200
nutrient management like supply

674
00:31:18,640 --> 00:31:23,200
deficient nutrients to the soil also

675
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:26,240
avoid excess use to protect the

676
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:32,240
environment. So as I discussed for

677
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:35,039
example the nitrate phosphate and then

678
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:39,039
sapotage nk is concerned. So you can see

679
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:43,519
that the last few decades um many areas

680
00:31:39,039 --> 00:31:47,360
farmers are using this um uh this the

681
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:49,600
important nutrients like NPK. Uh so what

682
00:31:47,360 --> 00:31:52,240
happens when it is overuse is there it

683
00:31:49,600 --> 00:31:54,640
becomes uh an environmental problems and

684
00:31:52,240 --> 00:31:57,679
when whenever underutilize underuse is

685
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:59,600
there so then it becomes a deficient

686
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:02,000
nutrient as far as the particular area

687
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:04,880
is concerned. So that way we should look

688
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:07,919
into an effective nutrient management as

689
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:10,799
far as a particular area or particular

690
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:12,880
waterershed is uh concerned.

691
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:15,840
Then let us further look into the

692
00:32:12,880 --> 00:32:18,399
nutrient and its functions. So uh there

693
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,200
are two basic types of nutrients. One is

694
00:32:18,399 --> 00:32:22,960
so called macronutrients. So these

695
00:32:21,200 --> 00:32:25,200
macronutrients

696
00:32:22,960 --> 00:32:27,679
are available in soil in large larger

697
00:32:25,200 --> 00:32:30,559
percentage. So for example nitrogen,

698
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:34,480
phosphorus, potassium, uh sulfur,

699
00:32:30,559 --> 00:32:36,880
calcium, magnesium etc. Uh so then other

700
00:32:34,480 --> 00:32:40,000
one is so-alled micronutrients. So this

701
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:44,320
is available in soil in minute percent

702
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:47,360
uh percentage. So like um iron, copper,

703
00:32:44,320 --> 00:32:51,120
zinc, manganesees

704
00:32:47,360 --> 00:32:54,320
etc. So that way uh this depending upon

705
00:32:51,120 --> 00:32:56,159
the requirement for the particular crop

706
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:57,679
say depending upon the availability of

707
00:32:56,159 --> 00:33:02,080
that particular nutrient for the

708
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:05,760
particular area we have to uh provide

709
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:10,320
that particular nutrients um to the soil

710
00:33:05,760 --> 00:33:13,120
so that the crops can grow in a healthy

711
00:33:10,320 --> 00:33:15,360
way and it can give better yields. So

712
00:33:13,120 --> 00:33:17,519
appropriate nutrient management is uh

713
00:33:15,360 --> 00:33:19,360
very important.

714
00:33:17,519 --> 00:33:21,519
Then let us look into what are the

715
00:33:19,360 --> 00:33:23,279
important functions of nutrient. So some

716
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:26,480
of the important functions are listed

717
00:33:23,279 --> 00:33:29,760
here. Uh these are it include an

718
00:33:26,480 --> 00:33:33,519
involvement in photosynthesis and produ

719
00:33:29,760 --> 00:33:37,120
produces uh carbohydrates.

720
00:33:33,519 --> 00:33:40,000
Then early root formation and growth. uh

721
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:42,799
then nutrient helps plants to survive in

722
00:33:40,000 --> 00:33:45,440
uh bitter environmental conditions like

723
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:49,039
um the environmental conditions like um

724
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:52,480
drought area or the increased saline

725
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:54,000
area. So like that so the nutrients can

726
00:33:52,480 --> 00:33:56,240
helps plants to survive in this

727
00:33:54,000 --> 00:33:59,360
particular areas. Then increasing uh

728
00:33:56,240 --> 00:34:02,000
water use efficiency. So if you give

729
00:33:59,360 --> 00:34:04,480
appropriate nutrients

730
00:34:02,000 --> 00:34:06,799
appropriate levels to the plants or to

731
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:09,200
the soil then we can even increase the

732
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:11,919
water use efficiency and then important

733
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,919
role in reproduction of plants. So these

734
00:34:11,919 --> 00:34:16,399
are some of the important functions as

735
00:34:13,919 --> 00:34:18,720
far as nutrient is concerned. So we

736
00:34:16,399 --> 00:34:22,079
should have better nutrient management

737
00:34:18,720 --> 00:34:25,520
plans as far as the particular area or

738
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:28,800
particular waterershed is uh concerned.

739
00:34:25,520 --> 00:34:31,119
uh so then uh say particular area is

740
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:33,599
concerned we should assess the nutrient

741
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:36,320
availability and then uh we have to

742
00:34:33,599 --> 00:34:38,159
provide nutrients to the soil for the

743
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,480
particular crop is concerned. So the

744
00:34:38,159 --> 00:34:42,240
various tests are possible as far as the

745
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:43,760
assessment of nutrients are concerned.

746
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:47,119
So some of the important tests are

747
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:50,800
listed here like traditional soil tests

748
00:34:47,119 --> 00:34:53,760
uh including test like P for pH uh

749
00:34:50,800 --> 00:34:56,560
nitrogen phosphorus potassium uh

750
00:34:53,760 --> 00:35:00,160
electric conductivity etc. So this type

751
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:03,760
of test traditional soil test we can uh

752
00:35:00,160 --> 00:35:07,760
perform uh in every 3 to 5 years so that

753
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:10,960
uh depending upon the the the non-avity

754
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:13,520
of this particular uh nutrients we can

755
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:15,839
provide these nutrients according to the

756
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:19,520
requirements. Then another important

757
00:35:15,839 --> 00:35:21,599
test is called nitrous nitrate test. So

758
00:35:19,520 --> 00:35:23,920
this uh involute the pre-planned nitrous

759
00:35:21,599 --> 00:35:26,160
test for additional nitrogen uh deep

760
00:35:23,920 --> 00:35:28,720
nitrate test how much nitrogen has

761
00:35:26,160 --> 00:35:31,599
already less below the crop rooting

762
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:34,640
zone. So this test we can do and then

763
00:35:31,599 --> 00:35:36,960
accordingly we can provide appropriate

764
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:39,119
um say nitrate treatment as far as the

765
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:41,839
soil is concerned.

766
00:35:39,119 --> 00:35:45,280
Then next one is traditional plant test

767
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:48,079
like a chlorophyll meter to quickly

768
00:35:45,280 --> 00:35:51,920
determine the nitrogen status without

769
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:54,800
destroying any uh plant tissues and then

770
00:35:51,920 --> 00:35:56,960
also uh we can go for irriation water

771
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,400
test and then electric conductivity and

772
00:35:56,960 --> 00:36:03,119
pH test. So these are some of the tests

773
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:05,599
used to assess the nutrients available

774
00:36:03,119 --> 00:36:08,560
for the particular area particular soil

775
00:36:05,599 --> 00:36:11,359
for particular c crop growth. So then

776
00:36:08,560 --> 00:36:14,640
accordingly we can go for nutrient

777
00:36:11,359 --> 00:36:17,200
management by supplying uh appropriate

778
00:36:14,640 --> 00:36:19,839
nutrients and appropriate levels or

779
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:24,000
appropriate measures to particular area

780
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:26,000
for the uh given uh crop. So now another

781
00:36:24,000 --> 00:36:28,800
important issue in sustainable

782
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:31,680
agriculture management is uh pest

783
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:35,040
management. So the pest management the

784
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:38,480
main object objective is to uh say how

785
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:42,400
pest management interlates with climate

786
00:36:38,480 --> 00:36:44,240
uh water crop and soil management uh say

787
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,800
for farmers to understand. So the

788
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:48,880
farmers should understand how the the

789
00:36:46,800 --> 00:36:52,079
pest management will help them then to

790
00:36:48,880 --> 00:36:56,640
incorporate uh this pest management

791
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,880
techniques um and it's so its decision

792
00:36:56,640 --> 00:37:01,520
making process as far as the farming is

793
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:03,280
concerned. So this is another important

794
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:06,960
issue. So some of the important

795
00:37:03,280 --> 00:37:10,000
necessities as far as pest management is

796
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:12,560
concerned uh that include a critical

797
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:15,119
component of conservation practices. So

798
00:37:12,560 --> 00:37:17,520
it is very important the pest management

799
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:21,200
the negative impacts of pesticides. So

800
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:24,160
if overuse is there then lot of issues

801
00:37:21,200 --> 00:37:27,040
can be there. Uh then ground and surface

802
00:37:24,160 --> 00:37:30,720
water deterioration due to non-point

803
00:37:27,040 --> 00:37:33,040
source of um u source of pollution like

804
00:37:30,720 --> 00:37:35,280
pesticide contamination. So this is a

805
00:37:33,040 --> 00:37:37,359
very important issue as far as water and

806
00:37:35,280 --> 00:37:40,720
soil is concerned. Then environmental

807
00:37:37,359 --> 00:37:43,280
risk uh like um say for example uh

808
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:45,920
burning crop residue for disease and

809
00:37:43,280 --> 00:37:47,440
then insect control. So these are the

810
00:37:45,920 --> 00:37:50,079
necessities as far as the pest

811
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:53,680
management is concerned. So then for the

812
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:56,560
considered area considered crop we have

813
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:58,880
to go for appropriate uh pest management

814
00:37:56,560 --> 00:38:01,440
as far as the the sustainable

815
00:37:58,880 --> 00:38:03,760
agriculture management is concerned. Uh

816
00:38:01,440 --> 00:38:07,839
then generally we use a term called

817
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:12,400
integrated uh pest management. Uh so IPM

818
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:16,079
so IPM approach is to uh to pest control

819
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:19,119
that combines biological uh cultural and

820
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:22,079
other alternatives to chemical control

821
00:38:19,119 --> 00:38:24,880
with the judicious use of pesticides. So

822
00:38:22,079 --> 00:38:27,040
instead of overuse or underuse of

823
00:38:24,880 --> 00:38:30,000
pesticides we have to judiciously use

824
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:33,359
the pesticides by considering the

825
00:38:30,000 --> 00:38:36,160
various biological cultural and uh other

826
00:38:33,359 --> 00:38:38,480
chemical issues are concerned. So the

827
00:38:36,160 --> 00:38:42,079
important goals of integrated pest

828
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,560
management uh includes uh maximum use of

829
00:38:42,079 --> 00:38:48,079
naturally occurring control forces uh in

830
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:50,000
the pest environment. So particular area

831
00:38:48,079 --> 00:38:52,960
particular crop is concerned we have to

832
00:38:50,000 --> 00:38:56,640
consider whether uh we can control the

833
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:59,200
pest naturally. So if if it is not

834
00:38:56,640 --> 00:39:01,920
possible only we have to go for

835
00:38:59,200 --> 00:39:04,400
chemicals. Then first focus on

836
00:39:01,920 --> 00:39:07,839
non-chemical measures. So whether

837
00:39:04,400 --> 00:39:10,720
biologically or with say natural control

838
00:39:07,839 --> 00:39:12,960
whether we can reduce the pest. So first

839
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:14,720
focus is on non-chemical measures. Then

840
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:17,119
use of chemical pesticides only for

841
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,680
preventing severe damage. So as far as

842
00:39:17,119 --> 00:39:22,400
particular uh farm is concerned or

843
00:39:19,680 --> 00:39:25,119
particular agriculture is concerned. So

844
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,960
we go for indicated pest management so

845
00:39:25,119 --> 00:39:31,520
that um to reduce of course the damages

846
00:39:28,960 --> 00:39:34,079
due to the pest but um we have to see

847
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,640
that um whether without non-chemical

848
00:39:34,079 --> 00:39:40,079
measures whether we can reduce the pest

849
00:39:36,640 --> 00:39:41,920
problem and then if chemical measures to

850
00:39:40,079 --> 00:39:45,119
be adopted then it should be in a

851
00:39:41,920 --> 00:39:47,280
controlled way so that uh there are very

852
00:39:45,119 --> 00:39:50,000
less environmental problems so that we

853
00:39:47,280 --> 00:39:52,800
can achieve sustainable agricultural

854
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:54,320
management for the particular area is

855
00:39:52,800 --> 00:39:58,000
concerned.

856
00:39:54,320 --> 00:40:00,560
So now finally let us look into what are

857
00:39:58,000 --> 00:40:02,400
the important issues uh as far as

858
00:40:00,560 --> 00:40:04,400
sustainable agricultural management

859
00:40:02,400 --> 00:40:06,720
practices are concerned. So some of the

860
00:40:04,400 --> 00:40:09,920
important issues are listed here. First

861
00:40:06,720 --> 00:40:12,960
one is uh biomass management. So for the

862
00:40:09,920 --> 00:40:15,760
particular area uh what kind of crop is

863
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,599
to be considered for the particular

864
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:19,839
region and particular area depending

865
00:40:17,599 --> 00:40:22,240
upon the soil depending upon the water

866
00:40:19,839 --> 00:40:25,520
availability and also uh like crop

867
00:40:22,240 --> 00:40:27,280
rotation. Then second

868
00:40:25,520 --> 00:40:29,680
issue is concerned better conservation

869
00:40:27,280 --> 00:40:32,079
practices as far as land and water is

870
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:33,839
concerned land and water concerned we

871
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:36,640
have to go for better conservation

872
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:38,400
practices. Then uh conservation buffers.

873
00:40:36,640 --> 00:40:40,480
So for sustainable to achieve

874
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:43,920
sustainable agricultural management we

875
00:40:40,480 --> 00:40:47,760
can uh consider uh conservation buffers

876
00:40:43,920 --> 00:40:51,440
like forest buffers at particular area

877
00:40:47,760 --> 00:40:54,320
and then grass waterway uh then we can

878
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:56,800
go for filter strip then vegetative

879
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:59,359
barriers then conservation barrier for

880
00:40:56,800 --> 00:41:01,839
wind etc. So various conservation

881
00:40:59,359 --> 00:41:03,760
buffers we can consider

882
00:41:01,839 --> 00:41:06,000
for the particular watershed or

883
00:41:03,760 --> 00:41:08,480
particular area is concerned to achieve

884
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:11,520
sustainable agriculture management. Then

885
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:13,920
as we discussed earlier we can go for

886
00:41:11,520 --> 00:41:15,839
crop husbandry by considering the

887
00:41:13,920 --> 00:41:18,800
various crop management practice or

888
00:41:15,839 --> 00:41:21,359
concerns. Then uh we can go for nutrient

889
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:23,359
management. So as we discussed in the

890
00:41:21,359 --> 00:41:26,160
previous slides nutrient is very

891
00:41:23,359 --> 00:41:27,839
important. So we should not overuse and

892
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:29,920
we should provide sufficient nutrients

893
00:41:27,839 --> 00:41:31,599
as far as the particular area or

894
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:34,160
particular crop is concerned. So

895
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:36,560
nutrient management is very important in

896
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:38,960
uh sustainable agricultural practices.

897
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:41,599
Then integrated pest management. So

898
00:41:38,960 --> 00:41:44,800
first we have to see whether we can go

899
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:48,000
for pest control without chemical use

900
00:41:44,800 --> 00:41:50,240
and if chemical use is required then we

901
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:52,400
should go for on a scientific way

902
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:54,000
controlled way. Then of course as far as

903
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:56,079
sustainable agriculture practice are

904
00:41:54,000 --> 00:41:58,560
concerned we can go for modern

905
00:41:56,079 --> 00:42:01,760
technology like molecular biology uh

906
00:41:58,560 --> 00:42:03,839
then and genetic engineering. So now

907
00:42:01,760 --> 00:42:04,960
these two branches of science like

908
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:07,920
molecular biology and genetic

909
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:10,160
engineering uh have been grown um

910
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:16,640
consider considerably in the last few

911
00:42:10,160 --> 00:42:18,319
decades. So uh the expert expert the the

912
00:42:16,640 --> 00:42:22,480
scientific

913
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:23,760
uh it's a availability of this uh

914
00:42:22,480 --> 00:42:26,720
molecular biology and genetic

915
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:28,640
engineering or its practices. Uh through

916
00:42:26,720 --> 00:42:30,720
its practices we can have better

917
00:42:28,640 --> 00:42:33,040
sustainable agricultural management. We

918
00:42:30,720 --> 00:42:35,440
can go for uh say for example seeds are

919
00:42:33,040 --> 00:42:38,240
concerned we can go for hybrid and

920
00:42:35,440 --> 00:42:42,000
imbrove seeds and then we can go for

921
00:42:38,240 --> 00:42:44,960
tissue culture. you can go for uh say uh

922
00:42:42,000 --> 00:42:48,319
hybrid varieties. So like that uh

923
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:50,720
various uh things various due to the

924
00:42:48,319 --> 00:42:53,760
development uh in molecular biology and

925
00:42:50,720 --> 00:42:55,680
genetic engineering we can uh use the

926
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,000
the various available technique uh

927
00:42:55,680 --> 00:43:00,880
techniques uh for sustainable

928
00:42:58,000 --> 00:43:02,880
agricultural or agriculture management

929
00:43:00,880 --> 00:43:05,359
uh is concerned.

930
00:43:02,880 --> 00:43:07,839
So now uh another important issue in

931
00:43:05,359 --> 00:43:10,240
sustainable agriculture management is um

932
00:43:07,839 --> 00:43:13,680
whether we can go for integrated farming

933
00:43:10,240 --> 00:43:16,000
system. So uh say integrated farming

934
00:43:13,680 --> 00:43:19,040
system or IFS some of the issues are

935
00:43:16,000 --> 00:43:21,839
listed here in this slide. So uh say for

936
00:43:19,040 --> 00:43:23,920
example mixed farming system we can go

937
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:26,800
for mixed farming system. So mixes

938
00:43:23,920 --> 00:43:28,720
farming system combines crop and

939
00:43:26,800 --> 00:43:31,839
livestocks enterprises in a

940
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,640
supplementary and or or a complimentary

941
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:37,280
manner. So uh for a particular watershed

942
00:43:34,640 --> 00:43:41,200
or particular areas concerns

943
00:43:37,280 --> 00:43:45,040
uh it is not only crop we can have a

944
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:48,480
integrated uh way of saying mixer

945
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:50,960
farming as far as crop is concerned as

946
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:53,520
far as um livestocks

947
00:43:50,960 --> 00:43:56,560
are concerned. So we can combine

948
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:58,160
together so that we can have

949
00:43:56,560 --> 00:44:00,240
better

950
00:43:58,160 --> 00:44:02,480
say economical achievements as far as

951
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,920
the watershed is concerned. So

952
00:44:02,480 --> 00:44:07,359
integrated farming system means

953
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:10,960
integration of uh various agricultural

954
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:16,160
enterprises uh like cropping uh animal

955
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:19,520
husbandry fisheries forestry etc. uh so

956
00:44:16,160 --> 00:44:20,880
so that we can have uh better economical

957
00:44:19,520 --> 00:44:23,359
achievements as far as the particular

958
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:25,680
area is concerned uh and this gives

959
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:28,560
great potentialities uh in the

960
00:44:25,680 --> 00:44:30,319
agricultural economy. So some of the

961
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,880
important components of integrated

962
00:44:30,319 --> 00:44:37,200
farming system includes uh crops,

963
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:39,440
livestock, birds and trees. Uh so uh

964
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:42,880
depending upon the area say for example

965
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,720
crop is concerned uh we can have a

966
00:44:42,880 --> 00:44:49,200
monocrop that means only one type of

967
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:52,960
crop or a mixed uh or ind crop and then

968
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:56,640
multi-ter crops of cereals legumes or

969
00:44:52,960 --> 00:44:58,400
pulses and oil seeds forage etc. So crop

970
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,440
is concerned we can have not only

971
00:44:58,400 --> 00:45:04,800
monocropping we can have different crops

972
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:06,400
together. Say for example say wherever

973
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:10,240
coconut farming is there with the

974
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:13,359
coconut we can go for say we can grow

975
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:15,040
pepper. So like that various crops can

976
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:17,040
be combined

977
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:20,880
with within the given area so that the

978
00:45:17,040 --> 00:45:23,760
farmers um can have

979
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:27,359
more products and better benefits from

980
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:30,319
their particular farms. So the main

981
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:32,800
motto of integrated uh farming system is

982
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:36,079
maximize food production and then

983
00:45:32,800 --> 00:45:38,960
overall development of a waterershed. So

984
00:45:36,079 --> 00:45:42,800
uh say by integrated farming we can

985
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:45,839
achieve uh say uh overall development of

986
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:49,040
the area since the farmers will have um

987
00:45:45,839 --> 00:45:52,720
say better profits since v through

988
00:45:49,040 --> 00:45:55,200
various crops in the same area so that

989
00:45:52,720 --> 00:45:58,160
we can maximize the uh food production

990
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:59,599
and maximize the benefits.

991
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:02,000
Then integrated farming system is

992
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:05,040
concerned. Some other uh same issues

993
00:46:02,000 --> 00:46:06,960
like uh indropping, mixer cropping,

994
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,839
strict crop cropping. So as far as crops

995
00:46:06,960 --> 00:46:12,319
are concerned, we can have uh three ways

996
00:46:09,839 --> 00:46:16,000
of integrated farming. First one is

997
00:46:12,319 --> 00:46:18,160
indropping. So here crops are grown in

998
00:46:16,000 --> 00:46:20,560
space available in between the plants.

999
00:46:18,160 --> 00:46:24,720
Say for example, turmeric can be grown

1000
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:26,960
in mango gardens. Uh so like that say uh

1001
00:46:24,720 --> 00:46:29,359
some crops will be already growing like

1002
00:46:26,960 --> 00:46:31,839
this. You can see that here the in the

1003
00:46:29,359 --> 00:46:35,040
mango garden here mangoes are growing

1004
00:46:31,839 --> 00:46:38,160
and then here other types of crops. So

1005
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:41,680
this is so called inter cropping. Then

1006
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:44,400
second one is mixer cropping. So here

1007
00:46:41,680 --> 00:46:49,680
alternative rows of different crops we

1008
00:46:44,400 --> 00:46:52,240
can use so that say we can improve the

1009
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:54,720
crop yields then preserve soil

1010
00:46:52,240 --> 00:46:57,680
fertility. Then the third one is strip

1011
00:46:54,720 --> 00:47:01,200
cropping where long strips are used for

1012
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:03,839
growing crops on leveled birds. So like

1013
00:47:01,200 --> 00:47:05,680
this as far as integrated farming is

1014
00:47:03,839 --> 00:47:09,119
concerned cropping is concerned we can

1015
00:47:05,680 --> 00:47:13,440
have intercropping mixer cropping and

1016
00:47:09,119 --> 00:47:16,000
strip cropping. So like this uh say by

1017
00:47:13,440 --> 00:47:19,359
using integrated farming system we can

1018
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,960
achieve sustainable agriculture

1019
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,359
practices or sustainable agriculture

1020
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:26,480
management for the uh given uh

1021
00:47:23,359 --> 00:47:28,880
watershed. So within the perspective of

1022
00:47:26,480 --> 00:47:30,319
what we discussed today sustainable

1023
00:47:28,880 --> 00:47:33,760
agriculture management practice are

1024
00:47:30,319 --> 00:47:36,319
concerned let us look into a case study.

1025
00:47:33,760 --> 00:47:39,119
So the case study is Adasha water

1026
00:47:36,319 --> 00:47:42,000
studies in Kotaprai village in Andhra

1027
00:47:39,119 --> 00:47:46,240
Pradesh. uh it is spread to over 465

1028
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:48,160
hectares and uh the uh say an indicated

1029
00:47:46,240 --> 00:47:50,880
water management plan based upon

1030
00:47:48,160 --> 00:47:53,920
sustainable agriculture has been done by

1031
00:47:50,880 --> 00:47:57,599
in this area. So the details are taken

1032
00:47:53,920 --> 00:47:59,520
from these website details are available

1033
00:47:57,599 --> 00:48:02,640
in this website.

1034
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:05,839
So the main objective of uh this um uh

1035
00:48:02,640 --> 00:48:08,240
watershed intervention uh was to link

1036
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,480
strategic research in natural resource

1037
00:48:08,240 --> 00:48:13,680
management with the development research

1038
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,240
to increase productivity uh of rainfood

1039
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,720
agriculture through enhanced efficiency

1040
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:21,119
of natural resources while maintaining

1041
00:48:18,720 --> 00:48:23,839
the uh resource base. So this was the

1042
00:48:21,119 --> 00:48:26,400
main objective as far as the waterershed

1043
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:29,599
intervention in Adasha waterershed. So

1044
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:32,319
uh finally uh through this uh the aim

1045
00:48:29,599 --> 00:48:35,119
was to increase um the productivity

1046
00:48:32,319 --> 00:48:37,920
through adoption of improved soil water

1047
00:48:35,119 --> 00:48:40,079
nutrients and pest management as far as

1048
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:42,319
the area is concerned. So the area is

1049
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:45,680
shown here it is taken from this

1050
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:49,440
website. So the important strategy in

1051
00:48:45,680 --> 00:48:51,359
this watershed uh was to link uh the

1052
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:54,480
research with waterershed development

1053
00:48:51,359 --> 00:48:56,880
schemes to enhance effectiveness of uh

1054
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,440
community participation and in this

1055
00:48:56,880 --> 00:49:00,960
watershed a multi-disiplinary

1056
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:04,480
multi-institutional

1057
00:49:00,960 --> 00:49:07,280
um consortium approach has been utilized

1058
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:09,680
uh and various developmental projects

1059
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:13,280
were implemented by research in this

1060
00:49:09,680 --> 00:49:16,319
area. So they used an islanding approach

1061
00:49:13,280 --> 00:49:17,839
uh through micro waterershed as upfront

1062
00:49:16,319 --> 00:49:20,640
demonstrations

1063
00:49:17,839 --> 00:49:25,520
managed by farmers with technical

1064
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:29,359
backups. So uh technical advice given by

1065
00:49:25,520 --> 00:49:31,920
in this area and then uh say the farmers

1066
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:35,920
implemented these projects

1067
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:38,319
then the uh the watershed is concerned

1068
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:40,960
onfarmm strategic research was conducted

1069
00:49:38,319 --> 00:49:43,599
by Chris in partnership with the

1070
00:49:40,960 --> 00:49:46,640
farmers. So some of the important

1071
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:50,880
watershed details are uh said 270

1072
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:53,599
farmers out of which uh in this area 136

1073
00:49:50,880 --> 00:49:56,160
are small land holding uh up to one

1074
00:49:53,599 --> 00:49:59,599
hectare and 60 are medium land holding

1075
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:02,000
and 74 large land holding about two

1076
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:03,680
hectares. Uh so this as far as the

1077
00:50:02,000 --> 00:50:06,079
distribution of land holding as far as

1078
00:50:03,680 --> 00:50:08,319
farmers are concerned in the Adasha

1079
00:50:06,079 --> 00:50:10,480
waterershed. Then u some of the other

1080
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:15,520
watershed details like annual uh

1081
00:50:10,480 --> 00:50:18,319
rainfall is about um 800 mm uh say 85%

1082
00:50:15,520 --> 00:50:21,520
of it occurs during June October. So

1083
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:24,240
soils are predominantly black soils in

1084
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:27,200
this area. Soil depth varies from 30 to

1085
00:50:24,240 --> 00:50:29,920
90 cm. Uh the general slope of the land

1086
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:33,440
is about 3%. And some of the important

1087
00:50:29,920 --> 00:50:37,200
crops grown include sorghum, mice,

1088
00:50:33,440 --> 00:50:41,200
cotton, sunflower, PG&P, soya bean in

1089
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:43,920
rainy season and sorghum uh sunflower

1090
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,480
vegetables in post- rainy season under

1091
00:50:43,920 --> 00:50:49,839
rainfford condition. And then in some

1092
00:50:46,480 --> 00:50:52,559
areas um say the the farmers grow

1093
00:50:49,839 --> 00:50:55,440
turmeric, onion and rice cultivation

1094
00:50:52,559 --> 00:50:58,160
depending upon the uh water availability

1095
00:50:55,440 --> 00:51:00,160
and then uh irrigation. So all these uh

1096
00:50:58,160 --> 00:51:02,079
details were taken from the cryat

1097
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:04,480
website.

1098
00:51:02,079 --> 00:51:07,599
So let us look look into what are the

1099
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:12,400
important interventions done by the

1100
00:51:07,599 --> 00:51:14,880
therat authorities. So here they they

1101
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:17,680
conducted a complete resource mapping as

1102
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,920
a first step and then they identified

1103
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:22,480
the various problems as far as the

1104
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,839
waterershed is concerned. They discussed

1105
00:51:22,480 --> 00:51:28,319
the various issues with the farmers. So

1106
00:51:25,839 --> 00:51:30,160
uh some of the interventions done by

1107
00:51:28,319 --> 00:51:33,119
chroat include continuous weather

1108
00:51:30,160 --> 00:51:35,119
monitoring. Uh they implemented a number

1109
00:51:33,119 --> 00:51:38,960
of automatic weather stations in the

1110
00:51:35,119 --> 00:51:42,240
regions and then uh say conducted

1111
00:51:38,960 --> 00:51:46,079
scientific soil analysis. So that soil

1112
00:51:42,240 --> 00:51:50,000
according to the soil analysis the soil

1113
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:51,920
has been classified uh and then they

1114
00:51:50,000 --> 00:51:54,960
identified which type of soil is

1115
00:51:51,920 --> 00:51:57,680
suitable for particular crops.

1116
00:51:54,960 --> 00:52:00,079
Then uh also a cropping system analysis

1117
00:51:57,680 --> 00:52:02,640
has been carried out. So that how much

1118
00:52:00,079 --> 00:52:05,440
crop yield is possible then what is the

1119
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:08,480
cost for farming and then what will be

1120
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:11,200
the uh benefits from the particular uh

1121
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:14,400
crop in the particular area. Then

1122
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,200
cropping has been uh done according to

1123
00:52:14,400 --> 00:52:18,800
soil. uh then uh the cost effectiveness

1124
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:20,480
of particular cropping has been also

1125
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:23,920
analyzed

1126
00:52:20,480 --> 00:52:25,760
so that um uh whether say better crop

1127
00:52:23,920 --> 00:52:27,280
yield can be achieved through various

1128
00:52:25,760 --> 00:52:29,440
measures.

1129
00:52:27,280 --> 00:52:31,119
Then another aspect which has been

1130
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:33,119
implemented in this watershed is

1131
00:52:31,119 --> 00:52:34,559
intercropping.

1132
00:52:33,119 --> 00:52:36,480
So we have already seen what is

1133
00:52:34,559 --> 00:52:40,400
intercropping. It is not only one crop

1134
00:52:36,480 --> 00:52:43,040
various crops were uh same done in the

1135
00:52:40,400 --> 00:52:45,760
same area. Then use of nitrogen fixing

1136
00:52:43,040 --> 00:52:48,640
plants. So that uh so instead of

1137
00:52:45,760 --> 00:52:51,440
providing uh say nitrogen through

1138
00:52:48,640 --> 00:52:54,880
artificial fertilizers. So if the

1139
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:57,359
nitrogen fixing plants um give nitrogen

1140
00:52:54,880 --> 00:52:59,839
to the soil. So this has been

1141
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,920
implemented. Then ver composting then

1142
00:52:59,839 --> 00:53:03,040
organic farming. So all those things

1143
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:05,839
were done in this particular

1144
00:53:03,040 --> 00:53:08,079
waterershed. So also integrated pest

1145
00:53:05,839 --> 00:53:10,319
control uh through natural control

1146
00:53:08,079 --> 00:53:12,720
measures were implemented in this

1147
00:53:10,319 --> 00:53:15,119
watershed. So that was one another

1148
00:53:12,720 --> 00:53:19,200
important aspect of uh the success in

1149
00:53:15,119 --> 00:53:23,280
this um uh watershed. So then finally

1150
00:53:19,200 --> 00:53:26,000
the cryat or the nos's

1151
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,319
uh carried out capacity building and

1152
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:31,280
then they gave a training to farmers so

1153
00:53:28,319 --> 00:53:33,280
that farmers know what kind of cropping

1154
00:53:31,280 --> 00:53:37,119
to be done and what particular area and

1155
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:40,880
then uh say scientific way of farming

1156
00:53:37,119 --> 00:53:43,680
then by using soil testing and then then

1157
00:53:40,880 --> 00:53:44,960
nutrient management then integrated pest

1158
00:53:43,680 --> 00:53:47,280
management. So these are some of the

1159
00:53:44,960 --> 00:53:49,920
important watershed interventions done

1160
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:52,000
in this watershed. So then now let us

1161
00:53:49,920 --> 00:53:55,280
look what are the important impacts of

1162
00:53:52,000 --> 00:53:59,119
this measures interventions done by the

1163
00:53:55,280 --> 00:54:02,079
theat in this adasha waterershed. So uh

1164
00:53:59,119 --> 00:54:04,400
the analysis showed that crop yield

1165
00:54:02,079 --> 00:54:06,720
considerably improved in many of the

1166
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:08,880
areas then considerable improvement in

1167
00:54:06,720 --> 00:54:11,040
water vability including groundwater. So

1168
00:54:08,880 --> 00:54:13,280
they implemented rainwater harvesting

1169
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:15,920
also in this area. So that improved the

1170
00:54:13,280 --> 00:54:18,640
water availability for the area. Then in

1171
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:21,119
integrated nutrient and pest management

1172
00:54:18,640 --> 00:54:24,319
were carried out. So that way farmers

1173
00:54:21,119 --> 00:54:26,480
are using um very less artificial uh

1174
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:29,680
fert fertilizers

1175
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:31,920
uh but they go for organic fertilizers

1176
00:54:29,680 --> 00:54:36,640
and then better nutrient management and

1177
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:40,000
then they go for u better say uh

1178
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:44,400
scientific pest control and natural pest

1179
00:54:40,000 --> 00:54:46,880
control instead of going for uh say

1180
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:50,160
chemical

1181
00:54:46,880 --> 00:54:52,960
say using chemicals for pest. management

1182
00:54:50,160 --> 00:54:54,960
then continuous monitoring. So as far as

1183
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:57,359
the watershed is concerned it was

1184
00:54:54,960 --> 00:55:00,640
monitored using remote sensing and then

1185
00:54:57,359 --> 00:55:02,880
GIS platform has been also used for uh

1186
00:55:00,640 --> 00:55:05,119
overall better management. Then holistic

1187
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:07,200
watershed management uh the holistic

1188
00:55:05,119 --> 00:55:09,920
approach as far as land water

1189
00:55:07,200 --> 00:55:12,400
agriculture and people are concerned. So

1190
00:55:09,920 --> 00:55:15,599
that way a holistic development approach

1191
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:17,520
has been uh um say done in this

1192
00:55:15,599 --> 00:55:19,680
particular watershed. Then this

1193
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:21,520
watershed has been declared as a role

1194
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:23,760
model of integrated sustainable

1195
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:25,760
watershed management through sustainable

1196
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:29,119
agriculture management by various

1197
00:55:25,760 --> 00:55:32,640
agencies. And then so this has been

1198
00:55:29,119 --> 00:55:35,760
replicated in many villages in India and

1199
00:55:32,640 --> 00:55:38,079
abroad. So another important aspect in

1200
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:41,040
this watershed is capac city building

1201
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:43,040
and training has been given by the NOS's

1202
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:44,640
to the people. uh so people

1203
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,839
participation was another important

1204
00:55:44,640 --> 00:55:50,720
aspect and then overall socioeconomic

1205
00:55:47,839 --> 00:55:53,680
upliftment has been taken place uh in

1206
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:56,160
this watershed through uh various

1207
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:57,680
interventions. Uh so as far as this

1208
00:55:56,160 --> 00:56:00,400
today's lecture is concerned some of the

1209
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:05,040
important uh reference are listed here

1210
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:08,160
including uh various uh websites.

1211
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:10,799
Then based upon today's lecture uh here

1212
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:13,040
I have listed uh one tutorial question.

1213
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:15,520
So the question is illustrate necessity

1214
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:18,160
of sustainable agriculture management uh

1215
00:56:15,520 --> 00:56:20,640
practices as far as overall waterershed

1216
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:24,079
management plans are concerned. So uh

1217
00:56:20,640 --> 00:56:26,319
you can do through a systematic approach

1218
00:56:24,079 --> 00:56:29,839
some of the steps are mentioned here. So

1219
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:31,920
identify the components then uh uh the

1220
00:56:29,839 --> 00:56:34,960
possible scientific interventions as far

1221
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:37,680
as the agriculture management practice

1222
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,920
concerns then identify the problems then

1223
00:56:37,680 --> 00:56:41,599
identify the role of uh uh modern

1224
00:56:39,920 --> 00:56:43,839
techniques like molecular biology and

1225
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:46,720
genetic engineering. Uh then uh

1226
00:56:43,839 --> 00:56:49,520
importance of nutrient management then

1227
00:56:46,720 --> 00:56:51,760
role of indicator pest management. So uh

1228
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:54,160
most of these issues we have discussed

1229
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:56,240
in the lecture.

1230
00:56:54,160 --> 00:56:59,599
Then uh some of the self evaluation

1231
00:56:56,240 --> 00:57:02,799
questions from today's lectures lecture

1232
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:05,440
are listed here. Uh first one is discuss

1233
00:57:02,799 --> 00:57:07,760
agriculture water use and compare world

1234
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:09,760
and Indian scenarios. Uh second question

1235
00:57:07,760 --> 00:57:12,480
is what are the major constraints in

1236
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:16,240
achieving watershed based sustainable

1237
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,799
agriculture management. Then discuss the

1238
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:21,280
agroecological classifications in India

1239
00:57:18,799 --> 00:57:24,240
and its importance. then illustrate

1240
00:57:21,280 --> 00:57:26,880
sustainable land management practices.

1241
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:29,119
So uh for most of these questions the

1242
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,720
details are available uh in today's

1243
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:33,440
lecture.

1244
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,880
Then a few assignment questions discuss

1245
00:57:33,440 --> 00:57:37,520
Indian agriculture and irrigation

1246
00:57:34,880 --> 00:57:41,520
scenarios. Then explain waterershed

1247
00:57:37,520 --> 00:57:44,559
ecology and agro systems. Then explain

1248
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:47,599
important uh issues in soil and water

1249
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:49,839
conservation. then discuss uh importance

1250
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:53,040
of nutrient and integrated pest

1251
00:57:49,839 --> 00:57:55,920
management and related issues. So most

1252
00:57:53,040 --> 00:57:59,040
of these questions can be answered uh

1253
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:02,000
based on today's lecture. So finally one

1254
00:57:59,040 --> 00:58:04,880
unsolved problem is uh listed here for

1255
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:07,599
your waterershed area. Study the scope

1256
00:58:04,880 --> 00:58:11,280
for integrated farming systems in your

1257
00:58:07,599 --> 00:58:13,599
area. So this uh we can do in a

1258
00:58:11,280 --> 00:58:16,400
step-by-step procedure. So first you can

1259
00:58:13,599 --> 00:58:18,640
identify the suitable integrated farming

1260
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:20,559
system practices for the area for

1261
00:58:18,640 --> 00:58:22,960
integrated uh sustainable agriculture

1262
00:58:20,559 --> 00:58:25,839
management. Uh then carry out

1263
00:58:22,960 --> 00:58:28,480
stakeholder analysis uh consider

1264
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:30,079
traditional practices of the farmers.

1265
00:58:28,480 --> 00:58:33,119
You can go to the field and discuss with

1266
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:35,119
the farmers and identify then suggest

1267
00:58:33,119 --> 00:58:37,839
scientific methods uh various

1268
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:40,000
methodologies how we can go for uh

1269
00:58:37,839 --> 00:58:42,480
integrated farming systems. Then

1270
00:58:40,000 --> 00:58:45,520
identify soil and water conservation

1271
00:58:42,480 --> 00:58:47,200
measures for the area. Then identify

1272
00:58:45,520 --> 00:58:50,000
proper monitoring and evaluation

1273
00:58:47,200 --> 00:58:52,319
strategies for the area and uh involve

1274
00:58:50,000 --> 00:58:54,960
how we can involve the local people uh

1275
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:58,640
to achieve indicated farming systems for

1276
00:58:54,960 --> 00:59:01,680
the uh given watershed. So this is you

1277
00:58:58,640 --> 00:59:04,640
can do it as an unsolved problem. So

1278
00:59:01,680 --> 00:59:08,480
this is uh today's lecture we discussed

1279
00:59:04,640 --> 00:59:10,720
about the uh sustainable agricultural

1280
00:59:08,480 --> 00:59:13,680
management practices and then its

1281
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:17,280
important uh importance in water

1282
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:21,359
management. U so we'll discuss further

1283
00:59:17,280 --> 00:59:23,599
the variable various issues as far as uh

1284
00:59:21,359 --> 00:59:25,040
sustainable water management or

1285
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:27,839
sustainable waterershed management

1286
00:59:25,040 --> 00:59:31,799
issues are concerned in the uh next

1287
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:31,799
lecture. Thank you.

1288
00:59:38,160 --> 00:59:41,599
And my

1289
