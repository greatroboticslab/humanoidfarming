00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,500
folks have rounded up 10 hydraulic tips

2
00:00:02,340 --> 00:00:06,299
for you today to make life easier when

3
00:00:04,500 --> 00:00:08,340
owning a tractor this stuff can be

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:09,540
confusing and frustrating but if you

5
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:10,860
know what you're doing ahead of time

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:13,019
well you're going to shorten that

7
00:00:10,860 --> 00:00:15,059
learning curve and make life a breeze

8
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:17,160
now I learned something new myself that

9
00:00:15,059 --> 00:00:20,160
I thought and maybe it is relatively low

10
00:00:17,160 --> 00:00:22,920
probability but it wound up saving me a

11
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,500
3 800 Bill well it cost me like 150

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,720
bucks or something but so save me like 3

13
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:29,519
650 I'm gonna make you wait for that one

14
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:30,960
just a little bit we'll tell you a few

15
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:35,360
other tips and then I'll tell you how

16
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,360
that one turned my frown upside down

17
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,239
tip number one just making it up on the

18
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,340
spot because I am reminded right now

19
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:45,899
that I need to do it on this one here I

20
00:00:44,340 --> 00:00:47,879
lost my dust covers I need to get some

21
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,039
new dust covers for these two hydraulic

22
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:52,379
couplers they're just sitting there

23
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,180
just begging for dirt and dust to get in

24
00:00:52,379 --> 00:00:55,620
there and then be a challenge to clean

25
00:00:54,180 --> 00:00:57,539
it out or get into my hydraulic system

26
00:00:55,620 --> 00:00:59,640
that's just a problem waiting to happen

27
00:00:57,539 --> 00:01:01,020
so you can go online and order dust

28
00:00:59,640 --> 00:01:03,000
covers just make sure they're fitting

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,979
the right size couplers that you have on

30
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,420
your tractor but how do you know what

31
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,280
size couplers you have on your tractor

32
00:01:06,420 --> 00:01:09,299
that is a really challenging thing to

33
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:11,340
figure out

34
00:01:09,299 --> 00:01:13,979
I tried to find I did some Googling to

35
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,960
see if there was hydraulic fitting size

36
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:18,240
chart something that's a visual

37
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,619
indicator where you can tell what size

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,759
couplers you're staring at it's pretty

39
00:01:19,619 --> 00:01:23,520
easy to tell if they're male or female

40
00:01:20,759 --> 00:01:26,100
but there's Pioneer there's flat face

41
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,180
there's 3 8 there's quarter there's half

42
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:28,619
inch there's all this other kind of

43
00:01:27,180 --> 00:01:29,939
stuff and it's not

44
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:31,619
unless you really know what you're

45
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:33,479
looking at it's not easy to tell I found

46
00:01:31,619 --> 00:01:35,280
a really handy chart over on tractor

47
00:01:33,479 --> 00:01:37,020
Mike's website he's another YouTuber in

48
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
the tractor space as well putting out

49
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:40,740
great videos every week make sure you

50
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,420
check him out so we'll put a link to

51
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,040
that product page as well I think it's

52
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,960
actually in a different listing where he

53
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:47,579
has this chart up there but it's just

54
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:49,680
it's just easy to read easy to

55
00:01:47,579 --> 00:01:51,119
understand and concise so take a look at

56
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:52,860
that if you're struggling to figure out

57
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,020
what fittings you have on your tractor

58
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:57,979
this one's a big one folks okay it's

59
00:01:55,020 --> 00:02:00,240
going to happen to the best of us and

60
00:01:57,979 --> 00:02:01,560
well this is one that you go through it

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,659
once and then you you hopefully remember

62
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,280
and don't do it again but before you

63
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,140
disconnect your loader or really any

64
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
Hydraulics that are on your tractor so

65
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:10,679
if you have a grapple connected or you

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:11,819
know hydraulic top link and you want to

67
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,739
take that off

68
00:02:11,819 --> 00:02:15,660
turn the tractor off

69
00:02:13,739 --> 00:02:17,340
rotate

70
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:18,599
this around you could hear it maybe you

71
00:02:17,340 --> 00:02:20,099
can't see it moving but you're going to

72
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:21,660
relieve

73
00:02:20,099 --> 00:02:23,160
the hydraulic pressure that's going

74
00:02:21,660 --> 00:02:24,720
through the lines on both sides of those

75
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:26,459
couplers and so that's going to make

76
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:28,800
life so much easier when you go to

77
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:30,720
reconnect them back up if you don't do

78
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
that and I've done it myself all right

79
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:34,920
you're going to have a lot of pressure

80
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,780
on the the loader side of that line when

81
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,300
you want to go and hook it back up to

82
00:02:36,780 --> 00:02:41,340
your tractor and you're going to have to

83
00:02:39,300 --> 00:02:42,780
somehow release that pressure that's on

84
00:02:41,340 --> 00:02:44,519
there and it can be dangerous can be a

85
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,780
mess because that pressure is built up

86
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:47,819
and so you want to wear the proper

87
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:49,800
safety attire on there and I've been

88
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,260
able to sometimes put a rag or a board

89
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,060
and push it against you know the loader

90
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,500
to a heavy piece of steel or something

91
00:02:54,060 --> 00:02:58,260
on the ground like a board on the ground

92
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:00,599
to relieve that or maybe use like a set

93
00:02:58,260 --> 00:03:02,400
of channel locks or nipex to pinch that

94
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,319
down or sometimes you can even use some

95
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,360
wrenches and crack that fitting and just

96
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,860
let it slowly leak out just a little bit

97
00:03:06,360 --> 00:03:09,720
just to get that pressure out of there

98
00:03:07,860 --> 00:03:12,360
otherwise it can be impossible to hook

99
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,500
up those Hydraulics again be prepared to

100
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:14,819
get messy if you have to do that because

101
00:03:13,500 --> 00:03:16,500
there's hydraulic fluid that's going to

102
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:17,879
fall out somewhere but again it's one of

103
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:19,920
those lessons if you can avoid it

104
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,780
fantastic if it happens to you you're

105
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,459
not that alone has happened to pretty

106
00:03:21,780 --> 00:03:25,860
much just about every tractor owner out

107
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:27,120
there before okay connecting hydraulic

108
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,620
couplers

109
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:30,959
seems pretty straightforward but

110
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:33,720
sometimes it's not okay and number one

111
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:34,980
probably the biggest issue that I'm

112
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:37,140
contacted about

113
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,060
is on backhoes where they're just not

114
00:03:37,140 --> 00:03:40,620
working the Hydraulics are connected

115
00:03:39,060 --> 00:03:41,940
just like they're connected here but

116
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:43,920
they're not working there's no response

117
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,440
and the reason for that is pretty simple

118
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:48,360
it just looks like it's connected but it

119
00:03:46,440 --> 00:03:49,799
actually isn't all right and if You Yank

120
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:51,720
on it really hard you'll pull it apart

121
00:03:49,799 --> 00:03:53,340
without you know pulling back the collar

122
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:55,620
and that's going to be a common problem

123
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,480
on the Kubota on the John Deere just on

124
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:58,799
hydraulics in general is where it looks

125
00:03:57,480 --> 00:04:00,980
like it's just seated in there properly

126
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:03,780
but it's not and sometimes you'll see

127
00:04:00,980 --> 00:04:05,580
hydraulic oil flowing out through there

128
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,260
too when you go to move a lever because

129
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,140
it's kind of sort of seated enough to

130
00:04:07,260 --> 00:04:12,959
open up and have some flu some flu some

131
00:04:10,140 --> 00:04:15,180
flow going through that direction in the

132
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,799
line there but it's not enough to make

133
00:04:15,180 --> 00:04:18,299
it work properly so let's take a look at

134
00:04:16,799 --> 00:04:20,220
some other hydraulic connections as well

135
00:04:18,299 --> 00:04:21,660
so you can see firsthand how to hook

136
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:23,699
them up all right so this style of

137
00:04:21,660 --> 00:04:26,160
coupler is called a Pioneer or an AG

138
00:04:23,699 --> 00:04:27,960
style coupler pretty easy after you most

139
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,940
tractors have these okay the flat face

140
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:31,740
style is another very common one more

141
00:04:29,940 --> 00:04:33,780
likely seen on construction equipment

142
00:04:31,740 --> 00:04:35,400
sometimes on tractors too so you're

143
00:04:33,780 --> 00:04:38,340
going to have a collar and a female on

144
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:41,280
the male side you simply pull back

145
00:04:38,340 --> 00:04:43,320
I almost forgot work your joystick or

146
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,300
work your lever for the hydraulics in

147
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:47,280
both directions relieve any built up

148
00:04:45,300 --> 00:04:50,460
pressure If there is some then you're

149
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,840
gonna pull or push back on the male

150
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:53,759
collar and you'll see some little

151
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,259
bearings in there and then you can pull

152
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,060
right out

153
00:04:55,259 --> 00:04:59,639
gonna be a little bit of fluid all right

154
00:04:57,060 --> 00:05:01,139
that's just nature of the Beast now to

155
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:03,960
reverse the process

156
00:05:01,139 --> 00:05:06,300
here's a good look at that male side

157
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,220
if your pressure's built up you got to

158
00:05:06,300 --> 00:05:09,960
push you got to detent this little pin

159
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:11,759
that's in the middle here to relieve

160
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:13,560
that pressure or crack the fitting and

161
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:16,979
let some fluid leak out

162
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:19,020
or the proper PPE now to reconnect

163
00:05:16,979 --> 00:05:20,820
kind of just seated in there gently you

164
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:23,759
can't push it the whole way you have to

165
00:05:20,820 --> 00:05:25,320
get that collar pushed back and then

166
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,880
it seats in there give it a little yank

167
00:05:25,320 --> 00:05:28,560
to make sure it's seated properly and

168
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,020
Away you go okay so now we're looking at

169
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:33,060
flat face couplers again pretend one of

170
00:05:31,020 --> 00:05:35,280
these is on the machine side and then

171
00:05:33,060 --> 00:05:37,320
one is on the attachment exact same

172
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,320
thing going on you need to just pull

173
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,840
back on a collar to release

174
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:44,940
and there you go okay now what you see

175
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,759
the difference is the fact that these

176
00:05:44,940 --> 00:05:50,460
are flat faces all right and so putting

177
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,240
them together is really easy you're just

178
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,340
gonna

179
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:55,020
take the male side and just push it in

180
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:56,580
to the female side okay there's no

181
00:05:55,020 --> 00:05:58,800
collar that you have to push back or

182
00:05:56,580 --> 00:06:00,000
pull back on you just simply push it in

183
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:02,220
there and it locks in place you can hear

184
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:04,139
that snap hopefully now for a lack of a

185
00:06:02,220 --> 00:06:07,620
better term you have a DOT and a slot

186
00:06:04,139 --> 00:06:09,600
okay and if you have that not aligned

187
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,220
you can't pull back on this collar to

188
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:13,199
release it it's kind of a I don't know

189
00:06:11,220 --> 00:06:15,539
maybe a safety mechanism of some of some

190
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:17,580
sort if you align that just right like

191
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:19,080
this that's when you can push back on

192
00:06:17,580 --> 00:06:21,300
that and everything releases just fine

193
00:06:19,080 --> 00:06:23,520
and so if you if you can't get the the

194
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,479
coupler released from there maybe it is

195
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:26,039
a pressure issue where you have to

196
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,020
relieve the pressure or maybe you just

197
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,759
have to align that slot properly and one

198
00:06:28,020 --> 00:06:31,979
of the things that I actually like a lot

199
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,720
about flat face couplers besides the

200
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:35,699
ease of connecting them is the fact that

201
00:06:33,720 --> 00:06:38,400
they're flat faces all right and unlike

202
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:40,380
the Pioneer the AG style when we showed

203
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,819
you on the first one around there's that

204
00:06:40,380 --> 00:06:43,319
big cavity there that they're not all

205
00:06:41,819 --> 00:06:45,539
upright like this but no matter what

206
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:47,100
direction they are there's look there's

207
00:06:45,539 --> 00:06:48,780
space for debris to get trapped in where

208
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:50,100
there's not really any space for debris

209
00:06:48,780 --> 00:06:51,900
to get trapped here you can just brush

210
00:06:50,100 --> 00:06:53,340
off the top flat surface pretty easily

211
00:06:51,900 --> 00:06:54,840
and hook them up a little bit different

212
00:06:53,340 --> 00:06:56,699
you don't need dust covers on these

213
00:06:54,840 --> 00:06:58,319
versus the Pioneers here is a good

214
00:06:56,699 --> 00:07:01,380
example of why you want these dust

215
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,819
covers on here it is like a it's like

216
00:07:01,380 --> 00:07:04,620
the Dust Bowl around here lately so this

217
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:06,960
tractor we were doing some tilling it's

218
00:07:04,620 --> 00:07:10,560
just absolutely disgusting but I want to

219
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,660
show you this last type of hydraulic

220
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:14,340
coupler kind of hard to see and this is

221
00:07:12,660 --> 00:07:16,800
on the back of a Kubota and I don't know

222
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,319
what it's called I don't know anybody

223
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:21,479
else that has this style but I think

224
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:23,460
it's super stinking cool

225
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:25,860
you don't have to pull back in any

226
00:07:23,460 --> 00:07:26,880
collar it's not a flat face though it's

227
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:29,639
still

228
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,139
some sort of pioneer rag style coupler

229
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:33,599
just trying to get all the debris away

230
00:07:31,139 --> 00:07:35,039
from there so I don't clog it up and so

231
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,300
all I'm going to do and I don't know how

232
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,220
honestly I don't know how this works I

233
00:07:36,300 --> 00:07:39,479
really don't but you just yank them out

234
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:41,340
and you push them back in there's no

235
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:43,199
collar of any kind it's not again a flat

236
00:07:41,340 --> 00:07:46,699
face I I don't know the the sorcery

237
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,699
behind it but I like it

238
00:07:47,099 --> 00:07:50,940
and then you could slap this

239
00:07:49,139 --> 00:07:52,560
dust cover down right on it like that

240
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,500
really nice

241
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,060
pop that back open

242
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:59,060
and you're back in place

243
00:07:59,639 --> 00:08:03,960
that was it that's it we're proud to be

244
00:08:02,099 --> 00:08:05,460
sponsored by rim guard Solutions a

245
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:06,960
liquid ballast weight it goes right

246
00:08:05,460 --> 00:08:08,940
inside your tires completely hidden

247
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,560
we're big on safety on this channel

248
00:08:08,940 --> 00:08:12,180
these tractors are just too light and

249
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,620
Tippy right out of the factory not only

250
00:08:12,180 --> 00:08:14,940
is it going to help with safety keeping

251
00:08:13,620 --> 00:08:17,340
those rear tires planted on the ground

252
00:08:14,940 --> 00:08:18,960
it helps with loader efficiency and

253
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:20,940
traction too the benefits of rim guard

254
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,560
include being the heaviest all-natural

255
00:08:20,940 --> 00:08:24,060
liquid ballast weight on the market it's

256
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,800
not going to corrode your rims like the

257
00:08:24,060 --> 00:08:27,599
old calcium chloride it's not going to

258
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:29,220
freeze and it's available at over a

259
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,139
thousand dealers Nationwide find the

260
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:34,320
dealer near you at rimguardsolutions.com

261
00:08:31,139 --> 00:08:36,180
speaking of hydraulic pressure this is a

262
00:08:34,320 --> 00:08:37,979
smart way to make sure that doesn't

263
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:39,839
happen to you where you you have too

264
00:08:37,979 --> 00:08:41,880
much pressure in the line to hook it up

265
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,680
to your tractor the problem is is every

266
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:45,839
setup is not going to have a male and a

267
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,580
female so sometimes you can't swap that

268
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:49,140
out just swap out a fitting on your

269
00:08:47,580 --> 00:08:51,839
tractor so you can have a male and a

270
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,120
female or same thing on your attachment

271
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,860
too but I Loop these together so that

272
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,680
that flow is going through both ways and

273
00:08:55,860 --> 00:09:00,839
it's not locked in here at you know

274
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:02,760
behind the fitting on on each side that

275
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,860
can make it a super hard challenge to

276
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,660
hook up to your tractor actually with

277
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:07,860
these forks I didn't do this I forgot to

278
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:09,839
do this last year when we were shooting

279
00:09:07,860 --> 00:09:11,040
a pallet Fork video I wanted to hook it

280
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,540
up to my skid steer and show you guys

281
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:14,279
how they worked how they went in and out

282
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,320
and I couldn't we were in the middle of

283
00:09:14,279 --> 00:09:18,180
nowhere I didn't have the tools with me

284
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,760
to relieve the hydraulic pressure and we

285
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,800
couldn't get the fittings onto the the

286
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:25,440
skid steer itself so if you do this

287
00:09:22,800 --> 00:09:26,700
though then you simply disconnect them

288
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,380
like that you can see how easy they

289
00:09:26,700 --> 00:09:30,120
disconnected when they're sitting

290
00:09:28,380 --> 00:09:31,620
outside I know it's good to keep your

291
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,000
attachments inside if you can but when

292
00:09:31,620 --> 00:09:34,740
they're sitting outside especially with

293
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:35,820
temperature changes when they're in the

294
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:37,380
baking sun

295
00:09:35,820 --> 00:09:38,880
well that pressure is going to build up

296
00:09:37,380 --> 00:09:40,860
in there even more and want to expand

297
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,260
and make this even more of a problem so

298
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:45,720
do this if you had the opportunity to do

299
00:09:43,260 --> 00:09:47,640
so but there is a solution if you don't

300
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:49,380
and that would be the hose end chamber

301
00:09:47,640 --> 00:09:51,360
which is designed specifically for

302
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:52,980
applications like this when your

303
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,820
attachments are sitting outside and it

304
00:09:52,980 --> 00:09:58,080
could be your backhoe it could be a

305
00:09:55,820 --> 00:09:59,760
flex-wing mower anything that's going to

306
00:09:58,080 --> 00:10:01,019
have hydraulic lines on it maybe that

307
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:03,120
are going to sit for a long period of

308
00:10:01,019 --> 00:10:04,380
time in the exposed Sun situations where

309
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,839
you'll have these huge temperature

310
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:08,519
variations at number one can make it

311
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:10,260
challenging to then hook up to your

312
00:10:08,519 --> 00:10:11,880
tractor or your skid steer whatever it

313
00:10:10,260 --> 00:10:13,620
is when you need to use it but number

314
00:10:11,880 --> 00:10:15,420
two think about those pressure

315
00:10:13,620 --> 00:10:16,440
variations that are occurring and going

316
00:10:15,420 --> 00:10:18,540
on

317
00:10:16,440 --> 00:10:21,480
that's causing damage

318
00:10:18,540 --> 00:10:24,240
albeit most likely slowly to the hoses

319
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,860
to the fittings perhaps to Motors

320
00:10:24,240 --> 00:10:27,779
anything else that's on the equipment as

321
00:10:25,860 --> 00:10:29,399
well and so if you want to avoid a

322
00:10:27,779 --> 00:10:31,560
situation like that well there's a hose

323
00:10:29,399 --> 00:10:33,240
end chamber that you can purchase plug

324
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:34,560
it into your fittings that are on there

325
00:10:33,240 --> 00:10:36,660
it is basically going to be like a

326
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,700
little extra Reservoir so that fluid can

327
00:10:36,660 --> 00:10:39,839
go in and out of there freely instead of

328
00:10:38,700 --> 00:10:42,240
causing damage to the rest of your

329
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,040
hydraulic components okay there's a big

330
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,920
one here again it really did it saved me

331
00:10:44,040 --> 00:10:49,380
38 3650 dollars

332
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:51,959
and all it was was a hydraulic filter I

333
00:10:49,380 --> 00:10:54,480
I'm not kidding you we had the tech out

334
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:57,720
to our shop to look at the John Deere

335
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:59,519
4720 the rear three-point

336
00:10:57,720 --> 00:11:01,620
um the the rear Hydraulics none of that

337
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,160
was working and he had gone through a

338
00:11:01,620 --> 00:11:04,560
bunch of different things

339
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,000
troubleshooting all this and that and

340
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:08,040
basically came down to we needed to

341
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:10,740
replace a big hydraulic cylinder block

342
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:12,000
that's back there and it was to take it

343
00:11:10,740 --> 00:11:14,459
out put it back in and everything else

344
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:18,300
gonna be 3 800 bucks and

345
00:11:14,459 --> 00:11:20,040
I was like that's not cool and uh I was

346
00:11:18,300 --> 00:11:21,180
I was pretty I was really frustrated at

347
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:23,040
that point because that's just a

348
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:24,600
ridiculous amount of money to make your

349
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,880
Hydraulics work and the weird thing is

350
00:11:24,600 --> 00:11:28,980
is that a year ago maybe more we

351
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,620
reported in a video of a similar problem

352
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:33,839
with the 4720 where everything went from

353
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:35,399
working fine to just not working they

354
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,500
got it into the shop and took a look at

355
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,600
everything and couldn't figure it out

356
00:11:37,500 --> 00:11:41,880
and it just was working fine for them so

357
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,980
it was this crazy kind of ghost problem

358
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:46,079
that we weren't sure what was happening

359
00:11:43,980 --> 00:11:48,180
long story short

360
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,820
this this on-site technician said hey

361
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,260
you know what this could be a just a

362
00:11:50,820 --> 00:11:54,959
Hydraulics issue maybe your hydraulic

363
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,279
flow is is just too low uh hydraulic

364
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:57,660
filter hasn't been changed in a while

365
00:11:56,279 --> 00:12:00,420
let's swap that out and see what happens

366
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:01,860
and lo and behold swapping out that

367
00:12:00,420 --> 00:12:03,600
hydraulic filter with a brand new one

368
00:12:01,860 --> 00:12:04,800
got us right back in Action right back

369
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,240
in the game and everything is working

370
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,920
perfectly

371
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:09,899
I almost still can't believe it but

372
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,480
that's all it took you're looking here

373
00:12:09,899 --> 00:12:13,620
at some DIY Hydraulics all right a lot

374
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:14,700
of tractors are not going to come out

375
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,380
with

376
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:18,120
the grapple hydraulics on the front and

377
00:12:16,380 --> 00:12:19,740
the rear remote on the back the stuff

378
00:12:18,120 --> 00:12:22,320
you need to use the attachments you want

379
00:12:19,740 --> 00:12:24,420
like a grapple like a rear hydraulic top

380
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:25,980
link that we talk about a lot

381
00:12:24,420 --> 00:12:27,779
the power beyond that's on here to run

382
00:12:25,980 --> 00:12:29,459
that backhoe is not the same thing we'll

383
00:12:27,779 --> 00:12:32,339
get into that in just a minute and the

384
00:12:29,459 --> 00:12:33,660
challenges is that adding OEM Hydraulics

385
00:12:32,339 --> 00:12:35,760
after the fact

386
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:37,440
man that's an expensive game to do and

387
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,060
so you can get do-it-yourself Solutions

388
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:40,680
like what you see here from Summit

389
00:12:39,060 --> 00:12:43,139
Hydraulics you save five percent with

390
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:45,000
code GWT takes a couple hours of your

391
00:12:43,139 --> 00:12:47,040
time but you save hundreds of dollars

392
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:48,839
it's hard to beat that and there's a lot

393
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,839
of terminology in this video we've done

394
00:12:48,839 --> 00:12:54,060
a whole in-depth video focusing on the

395
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:56,459
difference in various kinds of

396
00:12:54,060 --> 00:12:59,160
hydraulics okay and so this is actually

397
00:12:56,459 --> 00:13:01,079
on the Kubota a third function an

398
00:12:59,160 --> 00:13:02,940
aftermarket third function but there's

399
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:04,800
another kind that's called a diverter

400
00:13:02,940 --> 00:13:07,800
like what's on the summit tractor and we

401
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:10,500
installed on the John Deere 1025r just a

402
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:12,060
a difference in how it works in my

403
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,019
opinion it's split hairs on smaller

404
00:13:12,060 --> 00:13:14,639
machines they don't have a lot of

405
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:16,680
hydraulic flow anyway so they sort of

406
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,600
work the same once you get the bigger

407
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:21,060
tractors it's more of a difference then

408
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:22,680
you have power beyond you oops you'll

409
00:13:21,060 --> 00:13:24,360
have a couple of remotes or a couple of

410
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:25,680
ports on the back side sometimes three

411
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,180
ports depending on the size of the

412
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:28,800
equipment

413
00:13:27,180 --> 00:13:30,360
power beyond does not have a lever

414
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,860
anywhere on the tractor to control

415
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:33,660
whatever is plugged into those

416
00:13:31,860 --> 00:13:35,279
Hydraulics you have to have a lever on

417
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:36,839
whatever's plugged in like how the

418
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:38,639
backhoe has two levers there to move it

419
00:13:36,839 --> 00:13:41,700
around so that's different from a

420
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:43,680
regular rear remote okay which will have

421
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:45,720
a hydraulic lever on the tractor

422
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,579
somewhere so if you have a hydraulic top

423
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:49,200
link there's a lever on the tractor when

424
00:13:47,579 --> 00:13:51,300
you have it plugged in to extend that

425
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:54,060
top link out or retract it back in and

426
00:13:51,300 --> 00:13:55,920
then lastly hydraulic multipliers and I

427
00:13:54,060 --> 00:13:57,360
absolutely love hydraulic multipliers

428
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,160
they're one of the best values that are

429
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,180
out there you can add on up to

430
00:13:59,160 --> 00:14:04,440
additional

431
00:14:00,180 --> 00:14:06,300
an additional five ports for like

432
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:07,620
like probably twenty percent of the cost

433
00:14:06,300 --> 00:14:09,660
if you were able to do that through the

434
00:14:07,620 --> 00:14:10,920
OEM it's just a crazy amount of savings

435
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:12,839
and

436
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,120
again another Summit Hydraulics product

437
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:17,820
that's there but I have one on uh the

438
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,860
Kubota M4 we put one on the John Deere

439
00:14:17,820 --> 00:14:22,980
4066 that I had I'm also going to put

440
00:14:19,860 --> 00:14:24,600
one on very soon on the summit tx25

441
00:14:22,980 --> 00:14:26,160
it comes standard with one rear remote

442
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:27,839
which is pretty awesome but we're using

443
00:14:26,160 --> 00:14:30,180
that on the hydraulic top link right now

444
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,100
I am fully expecting to need more

445
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,380
remotes next winter for my snow blower

446
00:14:32,100 --> 00:14:35,880
if I want to hook up any other hydraulic

447
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,380
attachment on the back side and use it

448
00:14:35,880 --> 00:14:39,540
in conjunction with the hydraulic top

449
00:14:37,380 --> 00:14:40,860
link well you need to have more remotes

450
00:14:39,540 --> 00:14:42,899
to do so and that's where a hydraulic

451
00:14:40,860 --> 00:14:46,199
multiplier comes in handy now speaking

452
00:14:42,899 --> 00:14:48,360
of hydraulic top links super handy item

453
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:51,120
again you can see this is a John Deere

454
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:53,399
2038r it's got two rear remotes you see

455
00:14:51,120 --> 00:14:54,120
four ports there that's two remotes all

456
00:14:53,399 --> 00:14:56,940
right

457
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,560
two couplers make one hydraulic circuit

458
00:14:56,940 --> 00:15:00,240
or one remote you have to have flow

459
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:01,800
going this way and then flow going back

460
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:03,959
the other way all right this machine

461
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:05,519
here has a hydraulic top and tilt kit

462
00:15:03,959 --> 00:15:07,320
very handy we've shown you these on

463
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:09,660
other tractors as well

464
00:15:07,320 --> 00:15:10,980
working on getting you a complete kit

465
00:15:09,660 --> 00:15:12,300
that you can add to your tractor that's

466
00:15:10,980 --> 00:15:14,220
going to be sometime in the future we'll

467
00:15:12,300 --> 00:15:16,380
get you more information on that for now

468
00:15:14,220 --> 00:15:17,820
you can buy those hydraulic top links on

469
00:15:16,380 --> 00:15:19,500
Amazon we have a bunch of links there

470
00:15:17,820 --> 00:15:21,360
where we've bought some that have worked

471
00:15:19,500 --> 00:15:23,519
for us and so you just want to basically

472
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:25,199
get the shortest length of your top link

473
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,120
and then unscrew it to get the longest

474
00:15:25,199 --> 00:15:28,620
length and let that kind of serve as

475
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,880
your guide and try to find a hydraulic

476
00:15:28,620 --> 00:15:31,980
top link that's

477
00:15:29,880 --> 00:15:33,360
matches about those same dimensions but

478
00:15:31,980 --> 00:15:34,560
it's staring me in the face and perhaps

479
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:36,600
I should have thought about this earlier

480
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:37,920
we talked about those dust covers but

481
00:15:36,600 --> 00:15:39,959
some other ways to protect your

482
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:41,820
Hydraulics from exposure or from getting

483
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:43,500
pinched or from bending and kinking and

484
00:15:41,820 --> 00:15:45,959
all that kind of stuff and just looking

485
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:48,480
cool maybe even identifying them Outback

486
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:50,160
wrap pretty good stuff this this helps

487
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,779
keep these hoses kind of connected

488
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:53,940
together and sandwiched together and up

489
00:15:51,779 --> 00:15:56,100
out of the way it's a really cheap thing

490
00:15:53,940 --> 00:15:58,139
to add onto your tractor as well and if

491
00:15:56,100 --> 00:15:59,399
you're not sure which hoses go where you

492
00:15:58,139 --> 00:16:01,380
color coat them with different colors

493
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:03,779
that are on here and also we did the

494
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,339
video talking about long-term storage we

495
00:16:03,779 --> 00:16:08,399
are going to park our backhoe all winter

496
00:16:05,339 --> 00:16:10,320
and you get some concerns about pitting

497
00:16:08,399 --> 00:16:13,019
on these exposed cylinder rods that are

498
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:14,940
there and you can wrap it in this real

499
00:16:13,019 --> 00:16:17,459
it's kind of a nasty tape but it's not

500
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:20,100
that bad but it's going to completely

501
00:16:17,459 --> 00:16:22,079
protect your your exposed rods from from

502
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:23,699
corroding or from pitting over the

503
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:25,440
winter from long-term exposures to the

504
00:16:23,699 --> 00:16:27,600
elements it sounds like that's used a

505
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,699
lot in Marine applications too

506
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:30,959
it was kind of pricey but potentially

507
00:16:29,699 --> 00:16:32,579
compared to the cost of getting a

508
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,740
cylinder rebuilt it could be worth it

509
00:16:32,579 --> 00:16:36,300
really quick one for you and honestly I

510
00:16:34,740 --> 00:16:37,680
don't see this one I've never seen it on

511
00:16:36,300 --> 00:16:40,980
a tractor definitely could be on there

512
00:16:37,680 --> 00:16:42,839
at some point but this is a relief valve

513
00:16:40,980 --> 00:16:44,699
all right and so you can pull that

514
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:46,440
to relieve the pressure the built up

515
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:48,540
pressure in there if you're if your

516
00:16:46,440 --> 00:16:51,120
Hydraulics happen to have a little handy

517
00:16:48,540 --> 00:16:52,440
pull tab like that give it a yank when

518
00:16:51,120 --> 00:16:54,060
you're trying to disconnect things or

519
00:16:52,440 --> 00:16:55,560
plug things back in and it could relieve

520
00:16:54,060 --> 00:16:57,000
that built up pressure and make life a

521
00:16:55,560 --> 00:16:58,500
lot easier something I wish all

522
00:16:57,000 --> 00:17:00,060
Hydraulics had that's going to wrap it

523
00:16:58,500 --> 00:17:02,040
up for us today folks hopefully you

524
00:17:00,060 --> 00:17:03,240
learned something new it shortens your

525
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:04,799
learning curves it saves you some

526
00:17:03,240 --> 00:17:06,419
frustration or maybe solves a problem

527
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:07,740
that you're you're facing right now but

528
00:17:06,419 --> 00:17:09,480
that's what we do here folks we show you

529
00:17:07,740 --> 00:17:10,559
new products give you the tips to

530
00:17:09,480 --> 00:17:12,000

remind you if you are in the market for

536
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:20,939
retractor attachment something for the

537
00:17:19,500 --> 00:17:23,040
front end loader or the three-point

538
00:17:20,939 --> 00:17:24,480
