1
00:00:04,339 --> 00:00:09,330
in this video we'll be talking about the

2
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:12,269
different ways that you can sample your

3
00:00:09,330 --> 00:00:14,400
soils and some of the techniques that

4
00:00:12,269 --> 00:00:16,199
are best to be used one of the first

5
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,180
things to think of when you're taking a

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,070
soil sample is the timing of the sample

7
00:00:18,180 --> 00:00:22,050
so that's important from the point of

8
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:24,390
view that if you're testing your soil

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:26,220
from a nutrient deficiencies point of

10
00:00:24,390 --> 00:00:29,820
view or wondering what to put on your

11
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:33,719
soil then taking a sample just before

12
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:36,180
the plant is at its optimum growth stage

13
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,969
or when you're about to plant the crop

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:42,180
is very important as this helps you to

15
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:44,730
get the timing just perfect the second

16
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:46,440
thing to take into account is location

17
00:00:44,730 --> 00:00:48,690
of where you're going to take your soil

18
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,899
samples for example we want to avoid

19
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:54,690
areas like roads and tracks around

20
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:55,949
watering points along fence lines and

21
00:00:54,690 --> 00:00:58,649
areas like that that are not

22
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:01,140
representative of your paddock if you

23
00:00:58,649 --> 00:01:03,510
finding that you've got some bad soil or

24
00:01:01,140 --> 00:01:05,939
you are finding bad germination of

25
00:01:03,510 --> 00:01:08,220
plants it may be important to sample in

26
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:09,960
that area and also to sample in a good

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,390
section of your paddock that's an

28
00:01:09,960 --> 00:01:16,110
important thing to keep in mind if it's

29
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:18,360
in an area of pasture or a plant of some

30
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:20,400
description that's growing quite nicely

31
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:21,960
you might want to sample your soils

32
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,780
where the plants are not growing well

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,780
and in an area whether they're growing

34
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:29,640
quite well and to actually look at the

35
00:01:27,780 --> 00:01:32,790
two differences and it may help you to

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,530
identify the soil issues the third thing

37
00:01:32,790 --> 00:01:37,140
to think about is the depth of your soil

38
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,000
samples soil sampling is important and

39
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:41,250
most of the nutrients are concentrated

40
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,380
in the top 30 centimeters of your soil

41
00:01:41,250 --> 00:01:46,259
so it's important that we sample this

42
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:48,930
area but that if we feel issues are

43
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:51,840
affecting us that are further below in

44
00:01:48,930 --> 00:01:54,149
the surface or into the subsoil that we

45
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,380
sample to that depth as well a simple

46
00:01:54,149 --> 00:02:02,210
spade test is done by making a general

47
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,210
hole like this which allows you to

48
00:02:02,350 --> 00:02:09,100
pull up a section of the soil profile

49
00:02:06,340 --> 00:02:11,860
and there we have the surface soil down

50
00:02:09,100 --> 00:02:15,430
into the subsurface which is there easy

51
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:17,739
for me to test for soil pH maybe Sosa

52
00:02:15,430 --> 00:02:21,450
disa tea and also texture but some

53
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:21,450
simple infield soil testing
