  "text": "good day everyone you may have heard some whispers about a new design of our Ripper pip player well I'm glad to present that to you today so our Ripper pip play has always carried great strength and this new design is no different some of the main features you can see is a square reel as opposed to our round reel the reason for going to square was to give the Reel Center lower to the ground this makes it easier when you're loading those larger rails of pie another feature we've added on is a for pocket to make it easily forkable so there's two Fork um pockets on the Ripper so if you got to move it from property to property it's a lot easier to load onto the back of a ute or trailer we've also made our legs on the Ripper more efficient and easy to store if you have any questions on this great product feel free to reach out to the team today thank you bye",
