00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:06,960
Around the world, farmers fight the same

3
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,960
battles. Battles against insects and

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:11,920
other pests that not only damage their

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,840
crops, causing high losses, but also

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:17,680
transmit diseases to millions of

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:20,080
livestock and humans.

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,800
At the same time, many insects are

9
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,960
becoming resistant to insecticides

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:27,599
while consumers are more aware of the

11
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,320
negative effects of pesticides on public

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,960
health, beneficial organisms, and the

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:35,280
environment. The sterile insect

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,600
technique is a type of birth control for

15
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,310
insect pests that does not harm

16
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,079
beneficial insects and the environment.

18
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,239
Millions of males of the insect pest are

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,370
produced in special factories,

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,559
sterilized with radiation,

21
00:00:52,370 --> 00:00:56,800
[Music]

22
00:00:54,559 --> 00:01:00,239
and then released into the field at

23
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:02,960
regular intervals. There they mate with

24
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:05,760
wild females, and as a result, there are

25
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,240
no offspring. If sufficient sterile

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,880
males are released, the next generation

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:14,159
will have fewer wild insect pests and

28
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:17,280
the pest population can be controlled.

29
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:21,040
In situations of isolation, such pests

30
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:23,360
can eventually be eliminated.

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,600
Furthermore, if neighboring farmers

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,240
collaborate and coordinate by releasing

33
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,479
sterile insects together, large areas

34
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,240
can be effectively protected from such

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,720
pests.

36
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:37,119
There is no environmental pollution and

37
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:40,720
consumers can benefit from access to

38
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:42,960
food without insecticide residues.

39
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,759
With proven success in controlling

40
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:48,479
fruitfly and moth pests, this technique

41
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:51,280
is also being applied to livestock pests

42
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,759
and is being developed for mosquitoes,

43
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,320
making an important contribution to food

44
00:01:53,759 --> 00:02:01,240
security and enabling countries to

45
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,240
compete in global food trade.
