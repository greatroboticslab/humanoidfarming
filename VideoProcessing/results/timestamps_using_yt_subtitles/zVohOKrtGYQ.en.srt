1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:05,600
my name is Michael Plum I work for iller

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:08,240
where I'm responsible for a project on

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:11,480
intensification of Livestock systems

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:14,160
where feed is a is a key issue feed a

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,560
key issue in terms of determining life

6
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:19,480
productivity the overall economics of of

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,640
a livestock system but also how much

8
00:00:19,480 --> 00:00:24,080
natural resources are we really using uh

9
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,599
how much are we affecting the

10
00:00:24,080 --> 00:00:28,400
environment in terms of greenhouse gases

11
00:00:26,599 --> 00:00:30,759
so feed is really at the inter phase of

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,120
say positive or negative effect

13
00:00:30,759 --> 00:00:36,879
of livestock so to me the the the kind

14
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,719
of concluding sessions we had today was

15
00:00:36,879 --> 00:00:41,879
very interesting because obviously a lot

16
00:00:39,719 --> 00:00:45,160
of work has been conducted in the past

17
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:47,480
on feed Resources with an overall very

18
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:50,399
mixed uh

19
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:53,960
success and obviously looking at all

20
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,600
those very well sought new approaches in

21
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:56,600
terms of Innovation System in terms of

22
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,000
value

23
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:03,120
chains uh which were applied in the in

24
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,400
the ifat uh F adoption project in three

25
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,439
sides

26
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,640
Syria uh Vietnam and

27
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:12,360
Ethiopia had the potential to really

28
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:15,040
come up with new messages and and trying

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:17,320
to new insights trying to understand uh

30
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,320
where can we do better in the in future

31
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:22,759
than than in the past what were key

32
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,040
errors we committed in the past how can

33
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:28,439
we remed and and so on and a lot of the

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:32,600
the concluding session really was trying

35
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:35,040
to to find those kind of of key messages

36
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:39,240
in terms of what we can do better in in

37
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,920
the future uh what kind of Concepts were

38
00:01:39,240 --> 00:01:45,479
developed and and proven by those

39
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,799
projects for example look at feed

40
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:50,119
resources in a wider context look at

41
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:52,680
feed resources in terms of systems look

42
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:54,880
at feed resources in terms of how they

43
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,240
help to connect people to markets how

44
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,000
they can improve value chain and I guess

45
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:04,039
that key message came was was really

46
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,680
realized and and accepted by by all the

47
00:02:04,039 --> 00:02:08,119
very diverse people in the in the

48
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:11,560
different groups uh I was I was talking

49
00:02:08,119 --> 00:02:15,280
to which is certainly uh a very

50
00:02:11,560 --> 00:02:17,720
promising uh kind of of outcome of of

51
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,920
that uh project because it used to be

52
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,640
different in the past people were much

53
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:26,080
more technical much more focused on very

54
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,920
limited entry points so that's certainly

55
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:32,640
a a very good outcome of the the project

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:36,160
the workshop today couple of key issues

57
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,159
where people felt uh we need to do more

58
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:43,040
was trying to to understand those kind

59
00:02:39,159 --> 00:02:46,000
of of feed gaps feed demand better

60
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:49,000
better in a way are we looking at

61
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:51,519
current kind of production aims yeah are

62
00:02:49,000 --> 00:02:54,840
we only satisfying looking more at the

63
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:57,640
kind of subsistence idea of of lar

64
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:59,519
production or are we really committed to

65
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:00,400
something we call L Revolution that we

66
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,080
know

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,120
demand for meat and milk will increase

68
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:06,000
tremendously particularly in developing

69
00:03:04,120 --> 00:03:08,519
countries which gives tremendous

70
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,840
opportunities for small holders to

71
00:03:08,519 --> 00:03:12,560
produce for those kind of markets

72
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,720
however to be successful in producing

73
00:03:12,560 --> 00:03:16,560
those markets they need to produce more

74
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,640
they need to produce more from fewer

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,959
animals they need to be competitive and

76
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,200
a couple of key issues around those

77
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:27,640
those challenges so uh came out very

78
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:29,560
clear from the from the workshop and and

79
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:32,120
from the the kind of concluding meeting

80
00:03:29,560 --> 00:03:34,040
with had and one was really trying to

81
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:36,760
understand what is a feed Gap are we

82
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:39,799
defining feed gaps in terms of how much

83
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:42,040
more want Farmers to produce more in at

84
00:03:39,799 --> 00:03:44,959
different scales at a household scale it

85
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:46,720
could be at at a country scale uh so

86
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,599
there were very very good ideas and

87
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:53,159
insights in terms of how we can improve

88
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,840
those kind of of feed resource demand

89
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,640
and predictions and of course mitigation

90
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,040
strategies coming from it in the

91
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:03,840
future um couple of Interest interesting

92
00:04:00,040 --> 00:04:05,519
discussions in terms of uh are we

93
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:09,000
focusing too much on the positive side

94
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:11,560
of feeds feed supporting higher milk

95
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:14,720
higher meat production higher income and

96
00:04:11,560 --> 00:04:16,959
are been necting so-called tradeoff

97
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,840
effects what do we need to produce the

98
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:21,840
feed we obviously need land increasingly

99
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,000
we need water water is an issue water

100
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:27,440
scarcity is an issue uh so there were

101
00:04:25,000 --> 00:04:29,800
serious discussions about do we need to

102
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:32,800
do much more in terms of balancing

103
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:37,080
positive and negative

104
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:41,039
effects uh it's a very it's a very

105
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:43,919
difficult uh decision and to me it was

106
00:04:41,039 --> 00:04:45,960
interesting to see that all the people

107
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:49,160
from or most of the people from all the

108
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,800
sites and from very different groups be

109
00:04:49,160 --> 00:04:54,360
it research be it

110
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,919
extension uh very down the value chain

111
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:56,880
they seem to agree that we should focus

112
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:59,600
on

113
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:02,520
transition trying to move people out of

114
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,639
of poverty by increasing productivity by

115
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:09,479
increasing their production for the

116
00:05:04,639 --> 00:05:13,960
markets and believing that once they can

117
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:15,520
move out of of Agriculture by education

118
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,280
by higher income or

119
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:21,440
whatsoever uh that we are essentially

120
00:05:18,280 --> 00:05:24,039
looking at a new system in a couple of

121
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,680
years down down the line perhaps less

122
00:05:24,039 --> 00:05:30,240
focus on very small Holdings like5

123
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:33,160
hectares one hectar which is the case in

124
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:36,000
Vietnam and Ethiopia just because people

125
00:05:33,160 --> 00:05:38,199
have moved out of of Agriculture and L

126
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,199
of

127
00:05:41,800 --> 00:05:44,800
production
