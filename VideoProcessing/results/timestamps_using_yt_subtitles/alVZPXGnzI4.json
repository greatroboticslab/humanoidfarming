  "text": "[Music] this is so cool our neighbor donated some pallets that we are going to use to make our own compost we're going to be using greens live foods that we don't use you put it in one side of the container and it will compost to make your own dirt and soil for our garden it's gonna be amazing guys look how cute she is got little homestead daughters we all just work as a team look at my other cutie oh my gosh we're totally filming each other do we want to just carry that one how many are there okay oh there's two more oh but holy heck i need to make sure i'm not stepping in fire ant hills seriously i do not need that if y'all have not had experience with one two or three little tiny fire ants it's horrible getting stung by a bee is bad but holy spiritual buckets so this is where we're going to make the compost at you can never have too much fun when you're on your homestead literally every day is fun day even when it doesn't feel fun i'm still making fun beanta is in the round pen the donkeys have chewed it by the way right there hi binta you want out so miss haley was using these bags to help with her training of desensitizing her because she's very scared of the bags and the sound of a bag so we had her in this training pen to gently get her desensitized i'll probably do a video on that someday but right now we're working on several other things aren't we being tough all right so what is this called a less pitchfork this is a pitchfork and what are you going to use it for i bought you this pitchfork it was 33 at russell's feed and you really really wanted it what's it for oh well i'm using it to flip my compost so we're going to flip our compost with the pitchfork oh what do we have in here already is that hey um yeah grass popping sleeves horse manures okay grass clippings leaves horse manure and then were we gonna do like any i guess leftover lettuce maybe from the bunnies and the guinea pigs oh the watermelon rinds oh my gosh the ones that the chickens ate yeah it's pretty hard is it really gonna is that really gonna mush up into anything yeah the bacteria will just attack it that's pretty crazy you know thank goodness i don't have to throw away my watermelon rinds anymore in the trash oh we can do cardboard and this is all okay so when do you know that you're going to now transfer it to this side of the compost well this is a two-step one so basically that one would be for the finished compost like once it's like dirt looking you put it in there so you can use it okay um there's also like a three style one where you flip it and then flip it back into there so yeah so where's the dirt is it gonna be on the bottom or the top yeah it's gonna decompose at the bottom and then work its way up why i don't know i think it's a mix i know see we're homesteaders in the learning process yeah so that's what i love about this it's all hands-on people don't just magically know the stuff you start and we're learning and then this is going to be passed down to generations of carols and wonderful texan son-in-laws manly husbands that my daughters are going to find good men and they're going to know how to do this stuff too someday my grand kitties they're going to know this like the back of their hand and it's going to be all because we had to start fresh on our own learn it all ourselves with our neighbors our family my mother-in-law she has such wisdom my father-in-law has such wisdom my dad has a lot of uh experience with gardening so he gives us tips too hi pablo i know she's a bully she took all the hay look he's in line you know what i'm gonna get your own hay yep [Music] here is an update on our compost that we have been working on as you can see we have expanded it isn't this so cool our good neighbors brought some over to us they donated these cute blue ones nice texas colors some red ones so we're expanding so we can have more options of separating like this is the cardboard and the horse manure that's going to be starting one once it starts then she will move it over to have the dirt on this side that we can use by next spring we're hoping this one right here she's got more of pine shavings just dirt mulch from the chicken coop some weeds and such and she will move it over to this section you have to keep it moist for this compost to develop and then she's planning on making another one right here where we can do more of fruits and vegetables the rinds of the watermelon things like that that you can use anything really for the compost you just can't use any meat any dairy any animal products other than manure because you want it to be a natural source where it's going to develop into a dirt that you can then use for your garden boxes you know many different things that you can use the compost for you can compost veggie cuttings fruit peels eggshells the egg cartons coffee grounds yard trimmings cardboard junk mail paper wood shavings tons of stuff thanks so much for watching guys as you can see we have a new horse round pen that we made in previous videos we had just a plain orange one we did have to replace it because of our naughty donkeys they like to play with it but it's good for our horse she's already trained i will have an upcoming video short video showing how we redid the round pen thanks so much for watching again don't forget to like this video i hope it helped you gave you some ideas on making your own compost in your backyard in your homestead it's really beneficial to be able to have than your own dirt for the upcoming gardening season dirt is expensive and you have to figure out how to haul it to your house and all that good stuff don't forget to comment push the notification bell it's going to send you either an email or a notification on your phone if you have the youtube app telling you that we have just put out a new video [Music] hey [Music] you",
