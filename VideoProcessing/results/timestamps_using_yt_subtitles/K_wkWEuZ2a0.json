  "text": "[Laughter] [Music] [Music] yeah he's five years old and he is a meat you know guys how we doing welcome to good works tractors today we are at the butterfly girl photography place right the farm so we have a lot of projects to tackle out here we have a berm that we have to move all the dirt the sand out yeah okay okay everything away from the house we got to take and put it out behind the barn then we got to tackle some bushes good chance to use the stump wrecker now the biggest challenge might be what you see right here i'm going to do something i haven't done before i saw it before on youtube i think it was hometown acres used his box blade to rip up and cultivate and prepare for a garden so we're going to give that a shot here i don't have any tillers to use right now so we're going to see what happens it's springtime the garden's got to get planted now in some ways i am risking my life today there are honeybees out here there's a killer rooster there's even coyotes roaming in the woods but we're gonna get the project done one way or another this could be a two-part series so make sure you stick around guys i'm proud to be sponsored by borah wheel spacers today is the first real opportunity in the field to try them out and see how they help with the stability we're gonna give it a shot if you're looking for a stability solution for your tractor make sure you check out borah wheel spacers order direct from them they make them from one inch to six inches wide aluminum steel a lot of options for you made in america too and if you like what you see here i'd love to get a thumbs up from you hit that subscribe button right underneath the video and if you're looking for cool tractor stuff read through that description underneath the video or head on over to goodworkstractors.com [Music] [Applause] [Music] okay so first thing we're going to do is tackle these small garden strips here we have one more over that way as well i don't have a tiller like i said so i'm gonna really pitch this box blade tilt it forward by shortening the top link and i'm gonna lower down those ripper teeth as far as they go i don't want to use the blade on the back of the box plate at all i just want these teeth to dig down and scrape and cultivate the ground to prepare for planting i found this on a forum somewhere i know you guys have done it before my first time adding some weights right to the box blade i have 70 pound weights hanging on the inside four of them so it adds an extra 280 pounds these smaller box blades don't weigh all that much so i wanted to have some additional weight we have about 70 pounds with the spiko we have the loaded tires too so this should be pretty solid then when i'm using that front end loader but this is going to be a good project for you guys you're going to see this box blade in action we're going to use the heavy hitch tooth bar as well going to use the brush crusher after we dig out some shrubs up by the landscaping that we're going to be ripping out and of course we're going to use that stump bucket too [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Applause] foreign [Applause] so [Music] all right guys i am going into the danger zone you can see that beehive way back there i got a till with this thing right around it so fortunately we had a a full body suit here so there was an actual honeybee inside here when i put put it on though so hopefully that's the only one but here we go [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Music] [Laughter] my [Music] [Music] so [Music] so we just got done tilling all three areas with the box blade mainly you know with the scarifier teeth the shanks that we had all the way down i won't say it was ideal you can't get super deep you know part of the challenge with a small tractor it's very light so i have a four foot box plate on here it's a good reason why you would not want to have a five foot in my opinion because when these shanks are all the way down you can see that the wheels just sitting there spinning it doesn't have enough weight to get enough traction to be able to pull anything further so constantly had to raise up and try to feather it and you're going over an uneven surface and so the box blade is reacting to whatever all four tires are doing and so it's kind of bouncing around so it's definitely not ideal but if you need to do something in a pinch i think the results are plenty good to go ahead and plant with what you have out here but overall i still prefer a [Music] [Applause] tiller [Music] so [Music] okay so didn't think about bringing a chainsaw or hedge trimmers so we're going to try to tackle this without first asking our customer to see if we can borrow a chainsaw from them i could always head back home and grab one but i figure what the heck we're right here we're gonna give it a shot we're gonna see if we can knock these out without going that route [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] now [Music] [Music] so number one it'd be a good idea to cut these down just to prevent branches from whacking the house we've been lucky so far but that's the first thing i would say about ripping up the shrubs near the house number two you gotta be able to attack it from other angles so i might have to get this bush out to get the banks out of this one there's a couple big rooks back here these front couple were easy but this one's kind of buried underneath that timber and a lot more soil back here without a good way to get to it proving a little more difficult [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Laughter] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Applause] for those of you not familiar with the brush crusher grapple this is the only type of grapple you can get that doesn't require any additional connections besides just hooking it up to your front end loader so there's no hydraulics no electric that's required you just put it on and you get to work so then you may be wondering how does this system work without any third function hydraulics i'm going to show you right now so pay attention to this stop right here that's on the back side or the bottom side of the loader arm i'm going to lift up on this bottom jaw just to illustrate this point so when i lift up on it you can see it's not touching there so that stop is going to prevent any further motion of the bottom jaw so this is essentially where that bottom jaw is going to live you'll see there are some different positions so you can tweak the angle or the you know the the levelness of the bottom jaw this top jaw is going to be controlled opening and closing by your curl roll function on your front end loader so if you're going to dump out a bucket full of dirt or scoop up a bucket this is going to be that same function that controls the open and close of the grapple this is going to be the model bc4215 it's for the john deere quick attach there's also the model bc 4200 which is not going to have the center teeth there's going to be a heavier duty bc 4255 not gonna have the center teeth but built a little beefier for the larger compact tractor those three are all for the john deere quick attach there is going to be another version the bc 4300 for anybody that has a skid steer quick attach it's going to be gray in color doesn't have the middle teeth again it's built a little beefier similar to that bc 4255 it gets confusing i know but all the information is on my website good works tractors we can ship these all over the country we do it all the time but if you have a skid steer quick attach on kubota mahindra coyote ls the list goes on look for that bc 4300 so you'll see i do have those third function hydraulics right up front i want to give you guys examples of all sorts of equipment in action so just pointing this out that i don't have anything hooked up here that's the beauty of the brush crusher is 90 or more of folks don't have these additional hydraulics so you get into a grapple functionality without the additional cost of the hydraulics or electrical connections or anything else however if you're dead set on getting some additional functionality on your tractor i'd encourage you to watch our videos on the summit hydraulic solutions both the diverter kit for the front end the hydraulic multiplier for the back end the best part is you go to summit hydraulics you order from them you use code gwt and you're gonna save five percent off your order [Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] you [Applause] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] so [Music] so [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] do [Music] [Applause] now all righty guys we are wrapping it up for today day one we gotta we got all sorts of stuff done i should say with the three-point hitch have the box blade on here a lot of stuff on the front we had three different attachments on the front today the brush crusher the regular bucket here with the heavy hitch and our stunt bucket as well so you can see all sorts of different applications for these products make sure you stick around you're going to want to get a tour of all the wildlife all the farm animals that are out here we're going to finish up moving those berms get all this dirt piled up out here get some more spread out in front of the barn as well my job was no longer there everybody wants out sister found this place she lives on the next road okay and she's like i found it i found the perfect place when i walked back and i saw the barn and i saw the property and no animals had lived in this field for i don't know how long but it was like lush and pristine there was no dirt it was all grass the barn was perfect and i was like this is for my horse i wouldn't want to live anywhere else now like this is the perfect place and then we just kind of accumulated that alrighty guys we're back out here day two we were all here a couple days ago skip today because of the rain back out friday morning now to finish up you can see we've got one section of the berm moved already gonna keep working our way around the house just keep pile by pile taking it back through a couple of fences back there have to have somebody man in the gate just because all the animals want to get in and out but that's the destination for the dirt we're gonna get to work [Music] [Applause] so [Music] [Music] so [Music] uh all right you guys well the amount of time i had available has expired we got a lot of work done between the first day and today i don't know six seven hours worth of work and a couple different periods uh some gardens tilled up and worked up for planting got all these shrubs there were some massive old shrubs that were standing here that we got dug out really quick with the stump bucket timbers out with the tooth bar you know these berms i'm not even sure how many yards of dirt we moved but it was a lot so a lot of you are curious on how much to charge for different jobs you know an hourly rate maybe by a project it is helpful if you can come out and walk a project but for me that's not really an option i just don't have the time to do it and with bids all over the place i know a lot of you guys don't either so you know i would typically charge somewhere in the 120 to 150 an hour rate for something like this for all inclusive work so it's going to depend on your geographic location as well the amount of competition you have the type of work you're doing so this gives you a good idea though of the different projects you can knock out within a short amount of time if you have the right tools with you i have an important question though because i told sheila that i was going to charge her for this job i was going to give her a discounted rate because we're shooting video but i have something that i really want instead of cash money so i have not asked for this yet we're going to see what she says all i want is just a little bit of that honey after you get your are you serious oh yeah after you get your first uh first batch will that work i would love i love some fresh eggs too yeah all right see you guys know me i love food so if i can get some food out of the deal i'm feeling pretty good yeah for sure all right well good there you go guys the first batch that's right so you can get your payment in honey or eggs or other food as well it's up to you it's totally optional anyway thanks so much for stopping by if you like what you see here i'd love to get a thumbs up from you hit that subscribe button right underneath the video and read through the description underneath the video as well or head over to goodworkstractors.com thanks again for stopping by and until next time stay safe we'll see you soon so hey i have chicken i have duck and then did you want wanna",
