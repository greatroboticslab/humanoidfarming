  "text": "[Music] hi my name is Brent hood I received a Sagar SAR grant to look at sustainable shrimp the idea less is to raise them in an environment where we could source all the components so that we could raise an all-natural a naturally raised product what we have here I got my hands on what's called a bio filter this helps control the chemical composition of the water that's in the pool or the shrimp are here we have the solar panels these provide power to the pump there's an air pump and there's also the water pump that causes water to flow through the bio filter here and of course we have the pool inside the pool there are series of substrates these are collections of frames that have been covered with mesh that allow the shrimp to actually get away from the other shrimp so they have their own space to grow we feed twice a day once in the morning once in the afternoon we use aqua max 1000 it's a sinking fish fry pelletized feed that has a high protein content and so those are I think the primary components you're probably asking yourself yeah so I go and I do all this well how do we get out of it well these shrimp grow really large but they need a long growing period so if you have at least a hundred days you can raise shrimp these shrimp will end up being about somewhere between a number 18 to a number 14 shrimp backyard shrimping calm is the website that we set up with this project with the idea that if you were interested in doing this in your backyard you could actually see the firm details when that site is complete what we are going to provide is an itemized cost per item so you'll be able to look at your budget also a time frame there are certain key benchmarks on the dates that you want to make sure you have certain places in place are certain things in place there will also be the source for the juvenile so you probably won't want to try to erase them as a nursery environment but there are a couple places where you can actually get the juveniles which the spot you want to stock typically you're going to stock those at about a thousand at the beginning of your season typically you'll have a eighty percent return which means you get eight hundred and so eight hundred shrimp at just under 2 ounces of piece will give you a fairly decent return both for your family to enjoy and honestly because everything we've done is all-natural you'd be able to market that to people who are concerned about the sourcing for their shellfish [Music] [Applause]",
