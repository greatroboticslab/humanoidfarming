  "text": "[Music] afternoon everybody so I'm going to talk to you a little bit more about some of the components that you can find in more detail in the report I'm going to try to be quick here we have a lot to cover and Tucker in a moment we'll cover one of the impact categories of pathogen so I want to leave them some time the first thing usually we like to talk about when we've been talking about this is that manure irrigation is just a component of a mature system right and it's the land application component and and one of the things that we try to remind everybody that we talked to this about is manure irrigation is a selection of practice and it's going to be compared to other manure application practices so a lot of times we try to keep that in mind in our discussion and that this wasn't manure irrigation or Nothing right typically all of these fields that were talking about in what continent has irrigation equipment if they didn't get irrigated with manure they get traditional or other types of manure application applied to them so we try to really frame this as you're trying to compare this to other technologies and see what the benefits or drawbacks are um the other thing that is important to notice to note is that it's part of the system and one of the things is manure irrigation you can't really accomplish manure arrogation without doing at least some minor processing typically it requires some solid removal you can accomplish that with some complex systems processing systems botanical systems or we've seen a few people achieve it through multi stage storages so there's a few options and how you do that but the majority of a manure irrigation system can't handle solid at the content level that are that is traditionally found as a treated or even as it's diluted in manure storages there are lots of things that a system can control that you can control in a system um oh there we go um so one of the things we told people we're tried to get them to understand there's a lot of pieces a lot of management to each system as we discussed a lot of this stuff so I want you to become a little familiar with some of these things that not all systems are the same and that there's a lot of pieces that may impact the types of things we're talking about like odor or runoff or other things so one of the things we try to remind people you can control the rate of application you can change the pressure and the nozzle type right the nozzle types used for manure are much larger on the traveling gun that can handle maybe for maybe up to 5% total solids on the manure irrigation the center pivot system the types of nozzles sometimes are called trash nozzles or other things that are used for manure are very different than what you use for water irrigation right and they produce profits that are much different than what you would see in traditional application systems that apply water or maybe apply some kind of chemical right so it's the conditions that might apply for those systems might be very different than the ones that apply here also there's an end gun on the system so we talked a lot about that you can turn that on or off and that there are really computerized systems that are out there that can help you detect wind speed automatic shutoff turning off certain components for working over waterways etc so here's just a few images this is what we have drop-down nozzles right these were a really big discussion point and that the lower you could get your drop nozzles closer to the crop would be beneficial again in a lot of these Center pivots you can get nozzles drop nozzles that go all the way to the ground um in this case you can see these are higher up because they grew corn in this field and later in the season they didn't want to have to change out the position but it's really important that you understand that all of the systems are not the same and that the impact from where you have dropped nozzles your release height is quite important so here's a picture of one of the nozzles playing manure again this is a specialized nozzle and the pressures that we run under pivot systems with when you are on are much lower and we typically run them with water so in general the nozzles and the pressures are designed to have larger droplet sizes and in a moment I'll talk about some impact categories and why that's important next I think my computer seems to want to move forward here there we go um is that you can have some control system right there really advanced control system so this so that you can shut off even like a pie slice or you can shut off very small zones in these very irate irrigation application so we had a lot of discussions about oh well I want I how am I supposed to I need to operate through a waterway and we were saying no there are technologies to avoid things like operating through a waterway and shutting off and trying to protect certain resources when you're using it - all right when we were talking about the practice there are a lot of things we centered our discussion around which include when we apply manure you with an irrigation system how does that change or a droplet movement how does that disperse when it disperses when we're talking about pathogens we have some microbial and activation from the sunlight how this temperature how this humidity affects that microbial inactivation how a lot of times we got to talking about setback distances how far should I be from a house where well or surface water is this practice have advantages or is it this advantageous to use in comparison to other practices in terms of groundwater penetration we do have some areas with like karst fractured bedrock in Wisconsin and so it was a big discussion of whether whether we would see benefits or drawbacks from this system compared to exhibition okay so what we did it we kind of in the report there's a lot more detail about each of these if you want more but we kind of broke down the impact factors into five areas one was drips odor water quality air quality and pathogen so in the drift area we heard a lot of people talking about risk some talking about spraying onto their house or spraying onto the sidewalk and really this drift to us means the aerial movement of liquid outside the intended application area and that's different from overspray right we called overspray when you hit a house or a sidewalk we define that as overspray and we always agree that that was not a practice that we would ever support and that that should always be avoided and you should be able to control that with understanding your irrigation system and using information like wind information and other things so drift is that movement typically caused by wind so you're going to get a little movement off of the intended area and you need to be a little more careful when you're applying near school right so application a location becomes really important in a lot of these we talked about how there were not a lot of regulations for other manure application methods that drift was not important in there but that we realize we really needed to think about it more especially if we had higher relief pipe or irrigate for manure irrigation particularly with center pivots and the traveling guns so what the things we determined if you wanted to use min irrigation it was important to maximize your droplet size and ASAE has a standard so we're talking about medium to coarse and again the type of systems were using here generally produce larger droplet sizes so you would want to select equipment that and pressures that achieve that droplet size that's in the medium to coarse or higher range you want to minimize your release height and then you have to you know we really recommended that you needed to keep an eye on wind speed automatic shutoff things that when the wind gets too high you can see in that top picture that was on a really windy day compared to the bottom picture on a not very when you say you can see the difference in the drift that you see so the conditions are really important and then also using barriers and other things are really important in order to minimize that one of the thing one of the biggest concerns without about manure irrigation was odor and there really is odor is going to be a bigger concern with manure irrigation than almost any other manure application method so the perception and variable there are so it's a greatest citizen concern um was first some of the odors produced they had a lot of concern for like being outside having repeated applications that the odor was really impacting their life so generally always greater there are ways to mitigate though in this case higher winds greater than five miles an hour increases dispersion so again now you're trying to fail in the odor versus the drift and kind of operating we recommended in this five to ten mile an hour range you wanted to be filled barrett barriers you want to think about where are people you know there are some cases in our state where there were folks who had a irrigation system that was nowhere near anybody else they owned all the surrounding fields and so drift and odor were not really that big of a deal there's other who are trying to operate irrigation systems where their boundaries were with that had houses near them and if you're looking to put an irrigation system in and you already have it in those selection of those fields is really a mistake and also we talked about how manure processing could really reduce some of the odors like using a digest for a number of the facilities that had irrigation has digesters again you can mitigate some of these odors but comparatively to other practices the newer irrigation order will be greater water quality we talked a little bit about this really we started to think about that so long as you would avoid application rates that resulted in runoff that we may actually with multiple applications be able to see some of the impacts of leaching and that we would have less penetration into the into the soil surface and downward with multiple applications instead of one application in the fall or spring as we do with traditional applications so we saw this as a benefit some ways but there really isn't any direct information on manure we were taking information and applying it from other research and again we really targeted that you can't use the irrigation system through a waterway right you have to use those more controlled system to avoid that kind of situation air quality we talked about particulate matter greenhouse gas emissions hazard hazardous air pollutants we use OSHA occupational standards and Wisconsin ambient air standards to kind of look at where we were falling when we use manure irrigation now there's not a lot of data from manure irrigation systems particular particulate matter not very much on greenhouse gas emission for that particular land application but we just talked about the mechanisms that may increase or decrease in the report these particular components obviously in a lot of cases this type of application system would increase some of these hazardous air pollutants particularly hydrogen sulfide people had some concerns about we did have this state folks that the public health had measured a number of times around these systems and never have really had a hydrogen sulfide reading on that that they could document as being close to anything near the ocean occupational um again there are similar mitigation techniques to the other odor as using edge of field barriers keeping larger droplets and having a low reach in these height there's one more impact category with his pathogens and conkers going to talk about that in a moment so I'm going to leave that to him to cover um but I do want to talk about just two additional things before I let him take over one is that we really talked a lot about application tiny right and that we are really we heard from producers a lot that they're really running into these scenarios where they cannot they don't have enough time in the spring and fall to apply their manure right it's particularly those who are not allowed to apply during a frozen ground and so put kind of this imaging up just to give an idea for people when you have rainstorm or you have precipitation or melting events you're really limiting and you're not allowed to apply in the winter you really have tight window some years when you can get when you are out in the field and so what we found was irrigation is that that really expands your windows and can reduce not not only can you do multiple applications which can be more tailored to the timing of the plant so you might get better nutrient use efficiency that you also can avoid some of the issues that happen you know what people apply during times they shouldn't be applying because they're facing a tight window or other similar things to that you know it issues with tons of road traffic at the same time so we did think that there are some significant benefits to be noted with applications and then we have a few scenarios and if you look at the report you can see some other information we are really trying to lay out what does it mean if you switch from a more conventional application system using maybe tankers on the road to trying a field with a manure irrigation right so we said well you know there's a lot of scenario to think about here but for a certain size farm you kind of map this out and say they had a bunch of fields and this farm had 250 tanker loads a year right and maybe they did one or two applications or here on each skills now that if they switch to having some manure irrigation maybe they're tanker loads reduced by almost half so you see if you live near there you might be less traffic but then if you live close to the fields with manure irrigation you may have more instances of application and I think one of the important things we talked about was setting some rules on how many times you know we really had some discussions about 20 tons if I live next door to a field is way too many or is reasonable right so we took we discussed a lot about what that application number should be if there is a maximum or not and also a little bit about setbacks which can we'll get to some of the consensus [Music]",
