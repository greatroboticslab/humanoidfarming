2
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,240
It's getting to that time of year where

3
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:12,240
many of us start thinking about planting

4
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,040
our gardens. A main stay in most Wyoming

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,359
gardens would be the tomato plant. The

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,119
tomato plant is a great plant. When

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,720
selecting the tomato plant, we want to

8
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:23,279
look for certain things. We want to pick

9
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
a plant with overall health. We want to

10
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:27,279
look for any broken branches. We

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,080
especially want to look for plants that

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,399
are growing straight and uh and don't

13
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,440
have any discoloration on the leaves,

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:38,239
any signs of disease or any insects on

15
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,320
them. When we select the plant, most of

16
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:43,360
the tags will tell us how many days it

17
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,440
is to maturity. We want to certainly

18
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,239
select a plant that will work in our

19
00:00:45,440 --> 00:00:50,079
where we live and in in our zone. When

20
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:51,840
we transplant the tomato plant, we can

21
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:54,000
gently take the tomato plant out,

22
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:55,840
remembering that we can pluck the bottom

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,399
branches off and actually plant the

24
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:00,640
plant deeper than than where it is in

25
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,199
the pot. Many people like to select

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,400
plants with uh blossoms on them and

27
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:08,400
maybe even some tomatoes. Uh remember,

28
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,320
with tomato plants, size doesn't

29
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:12,000
necessarily matter. The more blossoms

30
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,760
and the more tomatoes there are on the

31
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,080
plant, the more transplanting stress the

32
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:17,759
plant's going to go through. A big red

33
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:19,759
tomato is a great addition to any

34
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:22,720
kitchen table and I hope many of you

35
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,720
have lots this year. This is Hudson
