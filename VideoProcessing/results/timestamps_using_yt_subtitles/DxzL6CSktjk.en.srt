00:00:00,290 --> 00:00:09,809
alright guys we are taking the peanuts

2
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:11,880
cracking them open and getting the seeds

3
00:00:09,809 --> 00:00:25,080
ready we're gonna be planting some

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:28,609
peanuts this year hi foresters this is

5
00:00:25,080 --> 00:00:32,130
where we're going to put the peanuts and

6
00:00:28,609 --> 00:00:34,260
I'm just I put some compost down a

7
00:00:32,130 --> 00:00:36,719
little bit more topsoil just trying to

8
00:00:34,260 --> 00:00:40,920
amend the soil a little bit it's some

9
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:43,079
really good rich stuff anyways but so

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:46,440
we're going to do is I'm just mixing it

11
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:49,530
all in and loosening up the soil because

12
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,180
peanuts need loose soil and we're going

13
00:00:49,530 --> 00:00:55,680
to plant these things about a foot and a

14
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:58,440
half apart so I'm gonna go ahead and

15
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:01,579
finish mixing this up and we'll get back

16
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,579
to you with the planting

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:20,130
- maybe the eggplant we had in there

18
00:01:15,670 --> 00:01:20,130
could be that big gigantic thing

19
00:01:29,540 --> 00:02:07,530

00:02:15,450 --> 00:02:22,200
from Burpee so these are seed peanuts

24
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:27,900

the green peanuts but we're so we're

26
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:35,180
going to plant these about a foot and a

27
00:02:30,600 --> 00:02:38,400
half apart 18 inches or 16 inches oh

28
00:02:35,180 --> 00:02:39,989
that would be 18 inches about 18 inches

29
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,400
apart that but some of these might be a

30
00:02:39,989 --> 00:02:48,690
little close but they'll be all right

31
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:51,380

32
00:02:48,690 --> 00:02:51,380
