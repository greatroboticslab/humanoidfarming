00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,600
hi and welcome back to another video one

2
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,000
thing I have personally come to like so

3
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:12,120
much about a solar system is the fact

4
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,340
that you can always start small and then

5
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,260
go back later so starting small has to

6
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:17,640
do with the number of um solar panels as

7
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:19,680
well as batteries and then other

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,539
accessories you might need and then you

9
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,600
are always able to upgrade

10
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:27,240
um data to you know a bigger package or

11
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:29,939
solution so you could record that when

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,500
we were approaching electricity phase

13
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:33,780
like get electricity for this house and

14
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:36,239
we decide to consider Sula we're able to

15
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:39,239
start small that was starting with two

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,460
batteries two panels and then added so

17
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:44,520
in today's video let's talk about the

18
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:47,520
upgrade of our solar system

19
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:47,520
foreign

20
00:00:48,070 --> 00:00:59,520
[Music]

21
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:01,559
so as I was saying earlier we started

22
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:04,500
off with a solar system with just two

23
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,200
batteries that was a 100 age batteries

24
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:11,100
each so that gave us like 200 amp hours

25
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:13,200
and then also I have two panels of each

26
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:17,040
that was some 182 watts each that was

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
360 watt of panels that was what we got

28
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:23,100
and then we had the inverter that was 3

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:25,560
KVA or 3000 watts of inverter there's

30
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:27,960
some few other accessories now that

31
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:30,900
particular solution wasn't able to power

32
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,420
much as of then I was basically you know

33
00:01:30,900 --> 00:01:35,759
to help us test the electrical system

34
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,280
that we've had installed and then to use

35
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,619
some few power tools so it was able to

36
00:01:38,280 --> 00:01:42,299
power up some few parties not for a long

37
00:01:40,619 --> 00:01:44,460
time you know we had to regulate how

38
00:01:42,299 --> 00:01:47,280
we're using those parts too so that we

39
00:01:44,460 --> 00:01:49,740
don't run completely out of battery as

40
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,240
at then so that particular solution as

41
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:54,259
you could record in some of my videos

42
00:01:51,240 --> 00:01:57,060
was around

43
00:01:54,259 --> 00:01:59,280
6600 cities plus they're about that's

44
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,140
what it costs for that particular

45
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:02,820
solution having the two panels two

46
00:02:01,140 --> 00:02:04,979
batteries and then one inverter there's

47
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,039
some few other accessories to you know

48
00:02:04,979 --> 00:02:10,380
get started that and then aside from

49
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:11,580
that when we continue working on this

50
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,860
house and then you got to a point where

51
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:17,040
we needed more to use more power tools

52
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:19,020
uh there was a need to upgrade from that

53
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,360
particular solution to something higher

54
00:02:19,020 --> 00:02:23,520
so that meant that we had to go in for

55
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,879
two additional batteries that was 100

56
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:29,700
age each and then two more panels and

57
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,640
then also some few accessories to help

58
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:35,720
with that particular upgrade so going

59
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:38,819
about that upgrade also that cost around

60
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:41,640
9000 plus their button so we upgraded

61
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:44,280
from 6600 to around 9000 plus that but

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,140
we spent like around 30 000 Plus for

63
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,239
that particular upgrade house for the

64
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:51,120
battery that is two batteries that is um

65
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,400
100 age each and then white watts of

66
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,580
panels each now during that particular

67
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:58,739
upgrade also going about the upgrade was

68
00:02:56,580 --> 00:03:02,160
it was very necessary to take into

69
00:02:58,739 --> 00:03:03,720
consideration you know the angle of the

70
00:03:02,160 --> 00:03:05,280
sound where the sun comes from where it

71
00:03:03,720 --> 00:03:07,500
rises and the rest so we ended up

72
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:09,599
installing those two panels on the other

73
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,040
side of the building so their first two

74
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:13,379
panels went to the side of the building

75
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:16,379
and then the other two went to this side

76
00:03:13,379 --> 00:03:18,480
of the uh building the reason was we

77
00:03:16,379 --> 00:03:20,879
normally have the sun rises from this

78
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:23,819
place and then set around this place so

79
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,560
when it sunrises it takes you know a

80
00:03:23,819 --> 00:03:27,540
long time for it to get to this point

81
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:29,640
too I said even though we're getting

82
00:03:27,540 --> 00:03:31,680
good amounts of sun energy we're still

83
00:03:29,640 --> 00:03:33,540
losing Samsung I didn't have those two

84
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:34,379
panels over here I was able to you know

85
00:03:33,540 --> 00:03:36,239
help

86
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:38,459
um get you know good amount of energy

87
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:42,000
for their batteries now that solution

88
00:03:38,459 --> 00:03:45,360
also was given us around 720 watts of

89
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:47,879
panels solution or energy from them

90
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,400
solar panels and then also around 400

91
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:52,500
amp hours from the battery so that was

92
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:54,540
like the energy were able to get acid

93
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:56,940
and then that it cost like around

94
00:03:54,540 --> 00:04:00,180
um was upgraded to around 9000

95
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,159
now when it got to a point where we were

96
00:04:00,180 --> 00:04:04,739
down with the building and we had to

97
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:07,319
move in there was also a need to upgrade

98
00:04:04,739 --> 00:04:08,700
but we took time to upgrade to that

99
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:11,280
particularly sure the current solution

100
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:13,439
we have now because after then the

101
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:16,079
solution we had was able to power up our

102
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,120
fridge was able to power up TV

103
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,820
um water pump and then the lights and

104
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,400
then the fan in the house however I

105
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:26,520
wasn't able to pop uh that is especially

106
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:29,040
in the fridge 24 hours because during

107
00:04:26,520 --> 00:04:31,259
the daytime of course the solar panel

108
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,060
um is able to also supply energy to

109
00:04:31,259 --> 00:04:35,400
whatever devices that we are using

110
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:37,860
whenever the Sun is up or even during

111
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,419
the daylight that we have so that means

112
00:04:37,860 --> 00:04:41,220
that we're going to pop our fridge from

113
00:04:39,419 --> 00:04:44,220
like early morning from around six

114
00:04:41,220 --> 00:04:45,840
o'clock to around four or five PM I get

115
00:04:44,220 --> 00:04:48,360
into the evening then we have to turn it

116
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,380
up because if we keep it on it means

117
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:51,600
that

118
00:04:49,380 --> 00:04:53,520
um some of the energy which would have

119
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:55,740
have to start and use in the evening

120
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:58,440
room have to be cut off so that's how

121
00:04:55,740 --> 00:05:00,900
we're regulating that and so we got the

122
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:03,479
final upgrade and also during then we

123
00:05:00,900 --> 00:05:06,720
were able to pop all the lights outside

124
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:09,180
um the house yeah throughout the evening

125
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,100
until the next morning and we're also

126
00:05:09,180 --> 00:05:13,860
not watching so much of tele I'm not

127
00:05:11,100 --> 00:05:16,440
really so much of a TV person so that

128
00:05:13,860 --> 00:05:18,960
was how we're going about it and then um

129
00:05:16,440 --> 00:05:20,400
the water pump we use it as well we need

130
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,560
if you want to get water in the house

131
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,780
and there isn't so much pressure from

132
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:27,060
the tank then you just turned part of

133
00:05:24,780 --> 00:05:29,460
the pumping machine and that was mostly

134
00:05:27,060 --> 00:05:30,840
during the daytime so we're not using I

135
00:05:29,460 --> 00:05:33,180
have that pump doing that evening time

136
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:34,979
so that was how we went about uh the

137
00:05:33,180 --> 00:05:37,860
second phase of our upgrade we were able

138
00:05:34,979 --> 00:05:40,440
to manage situations until we go to the

139
00:05:37,860 --> 00:05:42,660
Final Phase or not necessarily find out

140
00:05:40,440 --> 00:05:45,600
but to the current stage of our upgrade

141
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:49,020
so the current stage of our upgrade has

142
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:52,320
two 200 h batteries so instead of

143
00:05:49,020 --> 00:05:55,740
additional 100 eh we added to 208 so

144
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:59,220
that gives us an additional 408 and 400

145
00:05:55,740 --> 00:06:01,139
amp hours so adding it to whatever we

146
00:05:59,220 --> 00:06:04,320
had what we had earlier that was 400

147
00:06:01,139 --> 00:06:07,860
basically now 800 hours and then we also

148
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:10,320
added two more panels that is 180 watts

149
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:13,560
of panels so that also gives us a total

150
00:06:10,320 --> 00:06:15,660
of 1080 watts of um solar you know

151
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,539
energy or energy which is being drawn

152
00:06:15,660 --> 00:06:20,340
from the solar panels so as you can see

153
00:06:18,539 --> 00:06:22,560
talking about the upgrade especially

154
00:06:20,340 --> 00:06:24,840
with regard to the solar panels we've

155
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:27,360
sticked to the same wattage of solar

156
00:06:24,840 --> 00:06:29,699
panels so we started 180 Watt and all

157
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,680
our upgrade has been with 180 Watts so

158
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:34,139
so that is an important consideration

159
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:36,000
especially when you have a certain

160
00:06:34,139 --> 00:06:37,919
solution of solar system and you want to

161
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:40,740
upgrade it's always advisable

162
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:43,080
recommended to stick to the same size of

163
00:06:40,740 --> 00:06:44,400
their panels yeah especially the panels

164
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,759
but for the batteries we're able to

165
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,919
upgrade from 100 age to 200 h this time

166
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:52,740
around now that solution or this current

167
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,259
solutionary we have has brought the

168
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:57,840
total solar cost up to around seven

169
00:06:55,259 --> 00:07:00,180
seventeen thousand five Android City so

170
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:01,740
it means that we spend around 8 500

171
00:07:00,180 --> 00:07:05,340
about for this particular solution that

172
00:07:01,740 --> 00:07:06,840
was because one of the 108 watch and 200

173
00:07:05,340 --> 00:07:08,340
age batteries was selling for like

174
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,139
around two thousand four hundred they're

175
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:13,319
about and then you have to buy two more

176
00:07:10,139 --> 00:07:14,880
panels and I had to get a rails and then

177
00:07:13,319 --> 00:07:17,460
um the other accessories that I needed

178
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:19,259
and then the mc4 connectors and then the

179
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:22,380
cables and so on so that brought the

180
00:07:19,259 --> 00:07:24,000
total um upgrade to like around that

181
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,160
um amount and the current upgrade we

182
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:27,599
have is able to take almost everything

183
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,720
that we have in the house so the fridge

184
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:32,699
is now able to Pop 24 hours without any

185
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:35,099
challenges we don't have to tear it off

186
00:07:32,699 --> 00:07:38,400
at any point I'm able to use part two so

187
00:07:35,099 --> 00:07:40,080
you saw me do some DIY works here

188
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:41,699
um with the first few racks I was using

189
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:43,139
my parts when I was there

190
00:07:41,699 --> 00:07:45,900
um grinding machine using it as a

191
00:07:43,139 --> 00:07:47,759
sandpaper machine and then I even have

192
00:07:45,900 --> 00:07:49,080
worked on another DIY project which is

193
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,000
like a small dining table which I'll

194
00:07:49,080 --> 00:07:53,880
share with you later and I was able to

195
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:55,340
use a circular saw also which takes

196
00:07:53,880 --> 00:07:58,620
consumes about

197
00:07:55,340 --> 00:08:00,419
1200 watts of energy so I was able to

198
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:02,759
use that throughout the entire project

199
00:08:00,419 --> 00:08:05,099
and be able to use our pump be able to

200
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:07,740
use our ion we're able to turn on the

201
00:08:05,099 --> 00:08:09,000
lights you're able to use fans yeah so

202
00:08:07,740 --> 00:08:10,560
everything we have in the house the

203
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:14,220
current solution that we have is able to

204
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:16,979
pop everything so like I'm saying this

205
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:20,340
has only been possible because of the

206
00:08:16,979 --> 00:08:22,080
solar system and we started small we

207
00:08:20,340 --> 00:08:24,539
upgraded to certain points and now we've

208
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:26,759
upgraded to what we have now if in

209
00:08:24,539 --> 00:08:28,199
future there's a need to upgrade it's

210
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:30,599
still going to be easier because you're

211
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:32,459
able to add up more panels to it as well

212
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:34,560
as add a battery to

213
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,360
um whatever we have now also adding up

214
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,919
there two more panels to our solar

215
00:08:36,360 --> 00:08:39,599
system we had to add it to this

216
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:43,380
particular point where the sun rises

217
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:45,899
from so it's able to draw much energy as

218
00:08:43,380 --> 00:08:46,740
compared to where the sun sets or you

219
00:08:45,899 --> 00:08:48,540
know

220
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:50,580
um yeah from the middle point to where

221
00:08:48,540 --> 00:08:52,740
the sun sets so basically that's the

222
00:08:50,580 --> 00:08:56,399
current solar system that we have the

223
00:08:52,740 --> 00:08:58,519
total cost is around 17 500 cities for

224
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:01,980
six one else

225
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,140
for Batteries you know six batteries so

226
00:09:01,980 --> 00:09:06,120
four of them are 100 each other two of

227
00:09:04,140 --> 00:09:07,980
them are 200 each so another important

228
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,500
consideration also especially with the

229
00:09:07,980 --> 00:09:12,300
solar upgrade was that um the outside

230
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:15,959
lights that we had that was a LED light

231
00:09:12,300 --> 00:09:18,600
outside acid then was 50 watts each so

232
00:09:15,959 --> 00:09:19,980
that means that uh when we turn on all

233
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:22,320
the lights that was like around 200

234
00:09:19,980 --> 00:09:24,300
watts and that was a lot so there was a

235
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:26,220
need to also change those ones to

236
00:09:24,300 --> 00:09:29,040
something which was a little lower So

237
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:31,380
currently what we have each of them are

238
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:34,440
10 watts each so that gives us a little

239
00:09:31,380 --> 00:09:36,899
total of like 40 watt so 200 watts to 40

240
00:09:34,440 --> 00:09:39,180
Watts that's okay and the brightness is

241
00:09:36,899 --> 00:09:41,339
not so like not so bad especially what

242
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:44,459
we have like a brightness is very very

243
00:09:41,339 --> 00:09:46,980
okay in the evening so that is also an

244
00:09:44,459 --> 00:09:49,380
important consider we needed to take

245
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,720
into action so we don't consume so much

246
00:09:49,380 --> 00:09:53,700
of energy that we have you know solar

247
00:09:51,720 --> 00:09:56,279
energy is a little bit unlimited there's

248
00:09:53,700 --> 00:09:58,380
no unlimited as compared to maybe

249
00:09:56,279 --> 00:10:00,720
um the they're great and even the grid

250
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:02,459
is also Limited at some point but you

251
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,920
only feel it when it gets to a crucial

252
00:10:02,459 --> 00:10:06,600
point when it has to be load shedding so

253
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:08,040
that was also an important consideration

254
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:09,839
we had to take

255
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,060
um interaction um especially with the

256
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,339
outside lights also one of the reasons

257
00:10:12,060 --> 00:10:17,880
why the cost has increased a little bit

258
00:10:14,339 --> 00:10:19,500
was because of changing prices asset you

259
00:10:17,880 --> 00:10:21,959
know this dollar situation that we've

260
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:24,959
had for some time now for inflation so

261
00:10:21,959 --> 00:10:27,000
prices of goods has you know gone up so

262
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:29,040
much High the amount we bought the first

263
00:10:27,000 --> 00:10:30,660
point was the first set of panels for we

264
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,519
didn't get the same amount for the

265
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,339
second set of panels and even the last

266
00:10:32,519 --> 00:10:37,380
set of panels also was different prices

267
00:10:35,339 --> 00:10:38,640
the same with the batteries the amount

268
00:10:37,380 --> 00:10:40,440
you got it too much the first two

269
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:43,019
batteries was different from the second

270
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:44,940
set of batteries and then also the final

271
00:10:43,019 --> 00:10:46,860
set of batteries also was um different

272
00:10:44,940 --> 00:10:49,200
and then with the cables the mc4

273
00:10:46,860 --> 00:10:52,019
connectors and everything so in as much

274
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:54,180
as it might look a little bit expensive

275
00:10:52,019 --> 00:10:56,820
because we have done this over like a

276
00:10:54,180 --> 00:10:59,160
period it hasn't been so expensive and

277
00:10:56,820 --> 00:11:00,839
at least it's it's been wetted I must

278
00:10:59,160 --> 00:11:03,899
say because we've been here now like

279
00:11:00,839 --> 00:11:05,399
officially three months now and if we

280
00:11:03,899 --> 00:11:07,620
were supposed to be paying electricity

281
00:11:05,399 --> 00:11:10,620
bill I said now we would have had to

282
00:11:07,620 --> 00:11:12,899
spend like around 600 or 8 close to 800

283
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:14,519
cities for electricity based on the

284
00:11:12,899 --> 00:11:17,100
things that we have

285
00:11:14,519 --> 00:11:19,560
um here so that is not so but I believe

286
00:11:17,100 --> 00:11:21,360
that in probably some few years to come

287
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:23,100
it's really going to pay off

288
00:11:21,360 --> 00:11:25,920
um and I'm even sure there's going to be

289
00:11:23,100 --> 00:11:27,420
some increment to electricity or utility

290
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:29,760
type so

291
00:11:27,420 --> 00:11:32,279
yeah the solar system so far has been

292
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:35,160
good all we just need is just energy

293
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,839
from the Sun or daylight and we are good

294
00:11:35,160 --> 00:11:39,060
to go so I've also been nominated for

295
00:11:36,839 --> 00:11:41,579
the UT greatest Awards and their

296
00:11:39,060 --> 00:11:43,019
category of um real estates now there

297
00:11:41,579 --> 00:11:45,300
are what is happening sometime in

298
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:47,160
November so I'm going to leave a link in

299
00:11:45,300 --> 00:11:49,560
the description so you can kindly try to

300
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:51,000
vote for me thank you very much so that

301
00:11:49,560 --> 00:11:52,680
would be just about it for this

302
00:11:51,000 --> 00:11:55,079
particular video maybe you might have

303
00:11:52,680 --> 00:11:57,660
some questions or things that you which

304
00:11:55,079 --> 00:11:59,220
was not so clear you can just leave them

305
00:11:57,660 --> 00:12:02,220
in the comment section and I'll try as

306
00:11:59,220 --> 00:12:04,200
much as possible to respond to them so

307
00:12:02,220 --> 00:12:05,700
that'll be just about it for this video

308
00:12:04,200 --> 00:12:07,820
thank you very much for watching bye for

309
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:07,820
now
