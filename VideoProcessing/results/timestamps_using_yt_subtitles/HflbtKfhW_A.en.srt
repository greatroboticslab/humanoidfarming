00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,299
hello this is Scott Kentucky I'm with

2
00:00:08,809 --> 00:00:13,520
Benson County Extension Service and I'm

3
00:00:11,299 --> 00:00:14,690
in middle walk in North Dakota today and

4
00:00:13,520 --> 00:00:16,550
I just wanted to do a short

5
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:18,890
demonstration on pruning an apple tree

6
00:00:16,550 --> 00:00:21,350
and at this time it's it's late March

7
00:00:18,890 --> 00:00:24,020
early spring so it's the time that we

8
00:00:21,350 --> 00:00:25,790
want to be pruning before we get a lot

9
00:00:24,020 --> 00:00:27,920
of growth and stuff coming on and that

10
00:00:25,790 --> 00:00:30,260
way we can decrease any disease spread

11
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,239
what you'll need is just a regular

12
00:00:30,260 --> 00:00:33,770
pruners and for some of the bigger

13
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:35,840
branches if you really want to get after

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:38,090
it we have some a big lopper and then

15
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,100
also a sweet Esau for taking off some

16
00:00:38,090 --> 00:00:41,899
branches and many times you can take the

17
00:00:40,100 --> 00:00:43,670
biggest bigger branches off with the big

18
00:00:41,899 --> 00:00:45,890
lopper and then and then use a sweet

19
00:00:43,670 --> 00:00:48,829
Esau to get up close on that branch

20
00:00:45,890 --> 00:00:50,659
collar but what I'm trying to do is to

21
00:00:48,829 --> 00:00:52,129
open up this this canopy I've been

22
00:00:50,659 --> 00:00:54,199
working on this tree for a couple of

23
00:00:52,129 --> 00:00:55,760
years and just trying to open it up a

24
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:57,739
little bit so we decrease the amount of

25
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,199
disease and stuff and what I don't like

26
00:00:57,739 --> 00:01:01,850
sometimes and some of our trees get so

27
00:01:00,199 --> 00:01:04,220
awfully tall so I'm trying to train this

28
00:01:01,850 --> 00:01:10,220
one to have lateral branches coming out

29
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,720
a little bit and some of these are you

30
00:01:10,220 --> 00:01:12,980
know they want to grow right up right up

31
00:01:11,720 --> 00:01:16,070
to the heavens and pretty soon you're

32
00:01:12,980 --> 00:01:18,080
gonna need a an apparatus with a basket

33
00:01:16,070 --> 00:01:19,400
on just just to get your apples so I'm

34
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,220
gonna I'm gonna prune out some of these

35
00:01:19,400 --> 00:01:23,900
branches at that goal awfully high up up

36
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:25,430
into the air and there again if they're

37
00:01:23,900 --> 00:01:27,380
growing into the canopy you want to

38
00:01:25,430 --> 00:01:29,420
remove them because eventually they will

39
00:01:27,380 --> 00:01:30,800
cause rubbing on each other's branches

40
00:01:29,420 --> 00:01:34,400
and you can create a wound and that's

41
00:01:30,800 --> 00:01:37,040
just a perfect spot for disease to take

42
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,720
a foothold in and yeah and get started

43
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,490
we've had a lot of fire blight these

44
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:42,260
last couple of years especially in some

45
00:01:40,490 --> 00:01:44,150
of the ornamental crabs and one

46
00:01:42,260 --> 00:01:46,820
particular one is estar had quite a bit

47
00:01:44,150 --> 00:01:48,500
in it so by keeping this canopy open we

48
00:01:46,820 --> 00:01:50,240
can certainly keep that disease

49
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:52,910
potential down and increase the airflow

50
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:55,580
I just like to give you an example of

51
00:01:52,910 --> 00:01:57,290
God I mean here when I when I make these

52
00:01:55,580 --> 00:01:59,630
cuts I don't want to dig into the branch

53
00:01:57,290 --> 00:02:01,010
itself I just want to be you know right

54
00:01:59,630 --> 00:02:05,030
on that branch collar and then it'll

55
00:02:01,010 --> 00:02:06,470
have a nice cut that it'll help heal and

56
00:02:05,030 --> 00:02:08,360
you won't even know it's there in time

57
00:02:06,470 --> 00:02:10,220
you can see down here there was there

58
00:02:08,360 --> 00:02:13,550
was a cut here a prior year and it

59
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:14,690
healed up and it's doing just fine they

60
00:02:13,550 --> 00:02:16,530
talked about some of these branches

61
00:02:14,690 --> 00:02:17,850
growing inside here

62
00:02:16,530 --> 00:02:19,830
we kind of want to thin them out a

63
00:02:17,850 --> 00:02:22,590
little bit there again for added

64
00:02:19,830 --> 00:02:24,180
circulation and one thing Tom kelp told

65
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:26,819
me when I first started to entry's he

66
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:28,260
said you show that tree who's boss you

67
00:02:26,819 --> 00:02:30,330
you're not gonna kill the tree but one

68
00:02:28,260 --> 00:02:32,940
thing he did caution me on was don't cut

69
00:02:30,330 --> 00:02:34,980
off more than 25% of the branches in one

70
00:02:32,940 --> 00:02:36,510
particular year otherwise it's a bit of

71
00:02:34,980 --> 00:02:38,190
a shock to the tree and it takes a

72
00:02:36,510 --> 00:02:40,020
little more time to recover so if you

73
00:02:38,190 --> 00:02:42,920
just keep up up at it annually you can

74
00:02:40,020 --> 00:02:42,920
you can keep it clean

75
00:02:47,880 --> 00:02:49,940
you
