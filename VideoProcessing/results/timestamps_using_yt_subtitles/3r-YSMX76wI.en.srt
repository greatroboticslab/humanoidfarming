1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,920
ever wondered how rice a staple food for

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,560
many is harvested today we're diving

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:08,719
into the compelling world of rice

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:10,639
harvesting this process which has been

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,880
honed over centuries is of immense

6
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,120
importance worldwide it's a journey that

7
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,720
begins in verdant fields and ends in

8
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,560
your dinner plate rice harvesting

9
00:00:17,720 --> 00:00:21,920
methods have evolved considerably over

10
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:23,760
time in many parts of the world

11
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:26,480
traditional manual methods still hold

12
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,960
sway where Farmers wield sharp sickles

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,960
to cut rice stalks under the baking sun

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,120
yet in other regions modern mechanized

15
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,800
methods have taken root with machines

16
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,960
efficiently reaping threshing and

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,640
winnowing the grain but whether it's

18
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:42,000
harvested by hand or machine each grain

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,360
of rice embodies the same labor of love

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:46,640
and dedication each tiny kernel

21
00:00:44,360 --> 00:00:49,360
represents a story of growth resilience

22
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,680
and transformation in this video we

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,960
demystify the fascinating process of

24
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,640
rice harvesting taking you through each

25
00:00:53,960 --> 00:00:58,680
step in detail so let's embark on this

26
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,719
journey together Unlocking The Wonder of

27
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:02,480
rice harvesting the first step in

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,960
harvesting rice is knowing when the crop

29
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:07,280
is ready it's all about timing when it

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,159
comes to Rice harvesting the process

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,799
begins when the rice plant exhibits

32
00:01:09,159 --> 00:01:13,640
certain telltale signs of maturity the

33
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:16,799
first and most visible indication is a

34
00:01:13,640 --> 00:01:18,640
change in color as the grains ripen the

35
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,880
vibrant green of the rice field

36
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,960
transforms into a sea of golden yellow

37
00:01:21,880 --> 00:01:26,920
this color shift is a clear signal that

38
00:01:23,960 --> 00:01:28,840
the grains are nearing Readiness next we

39
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:31,400
look at the grains themselves they

40
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:34,040
undergo a transformation as they mature

41
00:01:31,400 --> 00:01:36,840
hardening from a soft milky texture to a

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:38,399
firm solid state when the grains Reach

43
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,320
This hardened stage it's another

44
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:42,240
indication that Harvest time is Drawing

45
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:44,880
Near however it's not just about

46
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,159
spotting these signs it's also about

47
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,920
understanding why timing matters so much

48
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:50,399
harvesting too early can result in

49
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,560
grains that are underdeveloped and

50
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,920
lacking in nutritional value on the

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,000
other hand if you wait too long you risk

52
00:01:54,920 --> 00:01:59,920
the grains shattering and falling to the

53
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,759
ground leading to significant grain loss

54
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,880
to maximize yield it's important to

55
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:05,719
strike that perfect balance harvesting

56
00:02:03,880 --> 00:02:07,600
when the majority of grains have reached

57
00:02:05,719 --> 00:02:09,640
their Peak maturity this is where the

58
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,840
Art and Science of farming come together

59
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,599
where a Keen Eye and years of experience

60
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,280
play a crucial role in essence knowing

61
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:18,120
when to harvest is not just the first

62
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,680
step but also one of the most critical

63
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,440
steps in the rice harvesting process

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:24,800
harvesting at the right time is crucial

65
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:26,879
to the success of the crop once the rice

66
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:29,160
is ready to harvest the next step is

67
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:31,280
cutting the rice stocks this step is

68
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:33,120
crucial as it marks the transition of

69
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:35,720
the rice grains from the field to the

70
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:38,040
storage where they will be processed for

71
00:02:35,720 --> 00:02:40,640
consumption there are two primary

72
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:43,120
methods for cutting rice manual and

73
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,879
mechanized the method used often depends

74
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,280
on the scale of the farm and the

75
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,040
available resources let's delve into

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,480
each of these methods to better

77
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,879
understand them first we have manual

78
00:02:51,480 --> 00:02:56,040
cutting this method is often employed in

79
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,159
smaller Farms or in regions where Modern

80
00:02:56,040 --> 00:03:00,480
Machinery is not readily available or

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,519
economical manual cutting involves the

82
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,920
use of a traditional hand tool known as

83
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:06,799
a sickle this curved blade is swung with

84
00:03:04,920 --> 00:03:09,360
a practiced hand slicing through the

85
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,519
rice stalks near their base it's a labor

86
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,840
intensive process requiring strength and

87
00:03:11,519 --> 00:03:15,920
endurance but it's also a method steeped

88
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:18,319
in Tradition connecting the farmer to

89
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,760
the Earth in a very tangible way on the

90
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:21,879
other end of the spectrum we have

91
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,959
mechanized cutting this method is

92
00:03:21,879 --> 00:03:25,840
commonly used in larger scale farming

93
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,400
operations where efficiency and speed

94
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,560
are Paramount here a machine known as a

95
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,159
combine harvester is used used the

96
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:35,920
combine harvester is a Marvel of modern

97
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:37,439
technology it cuts threshes and

98
00:03:35,920 --> 00:03:40,280
separates the rice grains from the

99
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:42,599
stocks in one Fell Swoop this method

100
00:03:40,280 --> 00:03:45,080
significantly reduces the labor and time

101
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:47,400
required to harvest rice regardless of

102
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:49,400
the method used the result is the same

103
00:03:47,400 --> 00:03:51,680
the rice stocks heavy with grains are

104
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:53,959
cut from the field the cut stalks known

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,840
as sheaves are then bundled together

106
00:03:53,959 --> 00:03:57,799
these bundles serve a dual purpose they

107
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,480
make transport easier and they also

108
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:02,439
allow the rice to dry dry in is an

109
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:04,560
essential step in the rice harvesting

110
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,840
process as it reduces the moisture

111
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,799
content of the grain making it suitable

112
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,680
for storage and further processing so

113
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,519
whether it's a sickle in the hand of a

114
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,199
skilled farmer or the rumble of a

115
00:04:13,519 --> 00:04:18,160
combine harvester The Cutting process is

116
00:04:16,199 --> 00:04:20,880
a vital step in bringing rice from the

117
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:23,320
field to our tables after cutting the

118
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,199
rice is bundled and left to dry after

119
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,160
the rice stocks are cut and dried they

120
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,800
undergo threshing and winnowing these

121
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:31,039
are two crucial steps in the rice

122
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,680
harvesting process where we transition

123
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:35,919
from stocks to grains so let's delve

124
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,560
into what exactly these steps entail

125
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:40,479
first up is threshing threshing is the

126
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:42,680
process of separating the grains from

127
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,080
the stalks traditionally this was done

128
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:47,080
manually with Farmers using a flail a

129
00:04:45,080 --> 00:04:48,919
simple tool consisting of two pieces of

130
00:04:47,080 --> 00:04:51,080
wood connected by a short chain or

131
00:04:48,919 --> 00:04:53,080
leather thong the stocks of rice would

132
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:55,000
be spread out on a flat surface and the

133
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:57,400
flail would be swung down onto them

134
00:04:55,000 --> 00:04:59,240
breaking the grains free from the stalks

135
00:04:57,400 --> 00:05:01,400
in today's modern age machines have

136
00:04:59,240 --> 00:05:03,759
largely replaced manual labor and

137
00:05:01,400 --> 00:05:05,720
threshing is no exception a mechanized

138
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:07,400
thresher works on the same principle but

139
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:09,720
does the job much faster and more

140
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,880
efficiently the cut stalks are fed into

141
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:14,160
the machine which beats or rubs them to

142
00:05:11,880 --> 00:05:16,400
separate the grains now let's move on to

143
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,120
winnowing winnowing is the process of

144
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,840
separating the rice grains from the

145
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,759
chaff the husks that surround each grain

146
00:05:20,840 --> 00:05:24,680
in the past Farmers would toss the

147
00:05:22,759 --> 00:05:26,520
threshed grains into the air and the

148
00:05:24,680 --> 00:05:28,199
wind would blow away the lighter chaff

149
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:30,720
while the heavier grains would fall back

150
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,919
down again modern technology has made

151
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,639
this process quicker and more efficient

152
00:05:32,919 --> 00:05:37,199
a machine called a wiow essentially does

153
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,479
the same thing but in a controlled

154
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:41,639
environment the threshed grains are fed

155
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:44,000
into the Wier which uses a fan to blow

156
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:45,880
away the chaff leaving just the grains

157
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,000
so through the processes of threshing

158
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:50,360
and winnowing we separate the grains

159
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:52,720
from the stalks and the chaff getting us

160
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:54,600
one step closer to that bowl of rice

161
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:56,680
these steps have been integral parts of

162
00:05:54,600 --> 00:05:58,720
rice harvesting for centuries and

163
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,800
although the methods have evolved the

164
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:03,080
principles Remain the the same at this

165
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:05,240
point we have our harvested rice but

166
00:06:03,080 --> 00:06:06,960
it's not quite ready to eat yet the

167
00:06:05,240 --> 00:06:09,080
final steps in the rice harvesting

168
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,639
process are milling and polishing now

169
00:06:09,080 --> 00:06:13,479
let's dive into the details Milling is a

170
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,080
crucial step that transforms the

171
00:06:13,479 --> 00:06:18,360
harvested Patty into edible rice this

172
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,960
process involves removing the outer husk

173
00:06:18,360 --> 00:06:23,120
or Hull from the rice grain the husk is

174
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,120
tough and inedible but it protects the

175
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:27,360
grain during growth so it's served its

176
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,319
purpose by the time we get to Milling to

177
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:32,360
achieve this machines known as hullers

178
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:34,520
or Huskers are used these machines apply

179
00:06:32,360 --> 00:06:36,360
mechanical force to the Patty either

180
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:38,560
through abrasion or through more direct

181
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:41,160
means like impacting or shearing the

182
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:43,039
result the husk is effectively removed

183
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,960
revealing the grain or what we call

184
00:06:43,039 --> 00:06:47,880
brown rice but we're not done yet though

185
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:49,840
brown rice is perfectly edible most

186
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:51,599
people prefer their rice white and

187
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,720
that's where polishing comes in

188
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,000
polishing is the process of removing the

189
00:06:53,720 --> 00:06:58,080
brand layer from the brown rice this

190
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:00,919
brand layer which is a thin coating over

191
00:06:58,080 --> 00:07:02,599
the grain gives the rice its brown color

192
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:04,520
it's filled with nutrients but also has

193
00:07:02,599 --> 00:07:07,000
a distinct taste that not everyone

194
00:07:04,520 --> 00:07:09,479
enjoys to remove this layer the rice

195
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:11,639
goes through a machine called a polisher

196
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,560
this machine uses friction to gently rub

197
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:15,720
off the bran layer without damaging the

198
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,599
grain underneath the rice is often

199
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,240
sprayed with water during this process

200
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,680
to prevent overheating and to help

201
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:23,560
remove any remaining bran what emerges

202
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,360
from the other end of the polisher is

203
00:07:23,560 --> 00:07:28,280
the white rice that we're all familiar

204
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:30,560
with it's clean shiny and ready to be

205
00:07:28,280 --> 00:07:32,319
cooked into a delightful meal both

206
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:34,400
milling and polishing are carefully

207
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:36,520
controlled processes they need to be

208
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:38,840
done just right to ensure that the rice

209
00:07:36,520 --> 00:07:41,440
is not damaged and that it retains its

210
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:43,560
nutritional value and there you have it

211
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,280
from field to table that's how rice is

212
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:48,960
harvested so let's recap the Journey of

213
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:50,639
rice from the field to your plate it all

214
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,800
starts with knowing when the rice is

215
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:54,840
ready to harvest this crucial stage

216
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,360
requires a Keen Eye and a deep

217
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,919
understanding of the rice plant's life

218
00:07:56,360 --> 00:08:00,960
cycle harvesting too early or too late

219
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,599
can greatly affect the quality and yield

220
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,599
of the crop the next step is cutting the

221
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,560
rice this involves using either

222
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:09,599
traditional methods like a sickle or

223
00:08:07,560 --> 00:08:12,039
Modern Machinery depending on the scale

224
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,199
of the operation the cut stalks are then

225
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:16,120
bundled and left to dry which allows the

226
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:18,400
grains to harden and reduces the

227
00:08:16,120 --> 00:08:20,919
moisture content making the next steps

228
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:23,039
easier once dry the rice undergoes

229
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,120
threshing and winnowing threshing

230
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,879
separates the grain from the stalk while

231
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,520
winnowing removes the chaff from the

232
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,479
grain these processes are vital in

233
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,839
ensuring that only the pure grain makes

234
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:36,240
it to the next step the final steps are

235
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,279
milling and polishing Milling removes

236
00:08:36,240 --> 00:08:40,479
the outer husk and brand layers from the

237
00:08:38,279 --> 00:08:43,399
grain while polishing gives it that

238
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,720
distinctive shine these steps transform

239
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,160
the raw grain into the rice we recognize

240
00:08:45,720 --> 00:08:50,240
on our plates each of these steps is

241
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,120
essential in ensuring a successful rice

242
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:54,040
Harvest they require a blend of

243
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,279
traditional knowledge modern techniques

244
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:58,120
and a lot of hard work next time you

245
00:08:56,279 --> 00:09:00,240
enjoy a bowl of rice you'll know the

246
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,399
hard work and intricate process that

247
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:03,399
went into harvesting it
