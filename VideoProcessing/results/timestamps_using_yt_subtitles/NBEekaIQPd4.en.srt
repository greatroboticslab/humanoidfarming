[Music]

2
00:00:02,780 --> 00:00:06,980
my name is Angela Fraley I'm an agent

3
00:00:05,190 --> 00:00:10,710
associate at the University of Maryland

4
00:00:06,980 --> 00:00:12,150
here with my colleague Carol Allen who

5
00:00:10,710 --> 00:00:13,639
is the other agent associate at the

6
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,619
University of Maryland and we are both

7
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:19,199
food safety educators so our job is to

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,390
provide all the growers in Maryland the

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,160
education that you guys need and want

10
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:25,590
and the technical assistance that you

11
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:28,619
also need to be able to navigate these

12
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:32,880
murky waters of food safety both in

13
00:00:28,619 --> 00:00:35,270
audits and in the federal regulations so

14
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,320
today hopefully I'm going to be

15
00:00:35,270 --> 00:00:40,230
demystifying some parts of this and

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:41,850
giving you some updates from the work

17
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:43,649
that the Maryland Department of Ag and

18
00:00:41,850 --> 00:00:46,710
we have done in the last year to get you

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:49,320
ready for the produce safety rule so has

20
00:00:46,710 --> 00:00:53,489
anyone gone through a third party audit

21
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:57,600
process in this room one got a GAAP

22
00:00:53,489 --> 00:01:00,719
certification couple okay a couple

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:07,590
coughs education has anyone had a PSR

24
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:09,450
inspection this year from MDA okay is

25
00:01:07,590 --> 00:01:11,729
anyone a little bit confused about how

26
00:01:09,450 --> 00:01:15,270
those two things are different the PSR

27
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:17,520
and the gap okay good good all right

28
00:01:15,270 --> 00:01:19,110
well not we're hopefully I will give you

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,049
tips and tricks to try and negotiate

30
00:01:19,110 --> 00:01:24,509
both of those things and it is kind of

31
00:01:22,049 --> 00:01:26,130
hard to think about what the differences

32
00:01:24,509 --> 00:01:30,780
are between the two because at their

33
00:01:26,130 --> 00:01:33,930
core they try and get at one they try

34
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:36,600
and address one issue right so both of

35
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:39,090
them outline practices for you to

36
00:01:36,600 --> 00:01:41,040
minimize the microbial hazards on your

37
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:43,829
farm but there are a lot of differences

38
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,170
between the two one is a voluntary

39
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:48,090
process that you could undergo and one

40
00:01:46,170 --> 00:01:50,340
is a federal regulation so in this talk

41
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:52,049
we're going to start with kind of

42
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:54,149
looking at the differences between the

43
00:01:52,049 --> 00:01:57,149
two then I'm gonna get a little bit into

44
00:01:54,149 --> 00:01:58,680
how to negotiate the audit process if

45
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:01,200
you are interested in getting a GAAP

46
00:01:58,680 --> 00:02:03,119
certification this year then we're going

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,070
to transition and talk about what's been

48
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,170
going on in terms of the produce safety

49
00:02:05,070 --> 00:02:09,420
rule this year how we're getting farmers

50
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,170
ready what we're seeing on the ground in

51
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,860
Maryland and just as to let you guys

52
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:16,650
know you

53
00:02:13,860 --> 00:02:18,450
they're doing really well so far MDA is

54
00:02:16,650 --> 00:02:21,690
really pleased with how farmers in

55
00:02:18,450 --> 00:02:23,730
Maryland are farming and how they're

56
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:27,630
getting ready for the produce safety

57
00:02:23,730 --> 00:02:28,230
rule so both of them require similar

58
00:02:27,630 --> 00:02:31,710
things

59
00:02:28,230 --> 00:02:34,230
they both outline different ways to

60
00:02:31,710 --> 00:02:37,140
minimize microbial hazards on the farm

61
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,570
and they're focused on the farm elements

62
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:42,000
that we know affect your product quality

63
00:02:39,570 --> 00:02:43,890
and safety the most so that's all the

64
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,050
workers that interact with your product

65
00:02:43,890 --> 00:02:48,300
that's the water that you use to

66
00:02:46,050 --> 00:02:50,010
irrigate your product and wash your

67
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:52,830
product and cool your product if so

68
00:02:50,010 --> 00:02:54,720
that's also any soil amendments that

69
00:02:52,830 --> 00:02:57,510
you're using on the farm that's how you

70
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,190
clean and sanitize the tools that you

71
00:02:57,510 --> 00:03:01,530
have on the farm and the equipment that

72
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:04,560
you have on the farm and it also

73
00:03:01,530 --> 00:03:06,660
outlines practices for how to deal with

74
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,040
wildlife and other animals on the farm

75
00:03:06,660 --> 00:03:10,380
because we know that all of those things

76
00:03:08,040 --> 00:03:13,459
are really important in terms of your

77
00:03:10,380 --> 00:03:16,380
your finished product quality and safety

78
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:18,450
and so you might be thinking in your

79
00:03:16,380 --> 00:03:20,549
seat right now okay well if they both do

80
00:03:18,450 --> 00:03:23,790
most of the same things why do we need

81
00:03:20,549 --> 00:03:25,980
both or why do we need either so why

82
00:03:23,790 --> 00:03:28,350
would you need either right having a

83
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:30,930
formalized food safety plan and food

84
00:03:28,350 --> 00:03:32,730
safety culture on your farm is not only

85
00:03:30,930 --> 00:03:34,980
helpful to minimize those microbial

86
00:03:32,730 --> 00:03:37,350
risks but it also opens up market access

87
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,420
for you guys if you formalize the plan

88
00:03:37,350 --> 00:03:41,820
and get a GAAP certification and then

89
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:43,590
furthermore we do know that a lot of the

90
00:03:41,820 --> 00:03:44,910
practices that we do from food safety on

91
00:03:43,590 --> 00:03:47,030
the farm are also really good

92
00:03:44,910 --> 00:03:50,910
horticultural practices too so they also

93
00:03:47,030 --> 00:03:52,830
not only minimize your microbial human

94
00:03:50,910 --> 00:03:55,950
pathogen risk but also in some cases

95
00:03:52,830 --> 00:03:58,519
plant pathogen risk as well so it's

96
00:03:55,950 --> 00:04:01,980
always good to double dip now why both

97
00:03:58,519 --> 00:04:04,350
so as I had mentioned before the gap

98
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:07,560
program is a voluntary program the FISMA

99
00:04:04,350 --> 00:04:10,200
PSR is a mandatory program buyers right

100
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:11,850
now are only focused on the gap program

101
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:14,220
because that's the only thing that gives

102
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:16,739
you a paper certificate that a buyer can

103
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:19,200
see and it's very unlikely in the next

104
00:04:16,739 --> 00:04:21,150
few years that buyers are going to go

105
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,280
with anything food safety without a

106
00:04:21,150 --> 00:04:25,229
paper certificate attached to it right

107
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:27,430
so the GAAP certifications are the only

108
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:31,120
thing that's going to give you a

109
00:04:27,430 --> 00:04:33,490
a paper assurance that you can hand to a

110
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:36,699
buyer and that allows you to open up

111
00:04:33,490 --> 00:04:39,820
market access to different buyers but

112
00:04:36,699 --> 00:04:42,370
it's also why both is also important

113
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:44,289
because if you do gaps and you follow

114
00:04:42,370 --> 00:04:46,630
good agricultural practices you get you

115
00:04:44,289 --> 00:04:48,340
get a third party audit it's very likely

116
00:04:46,630 --> 00:04:52,360
that you're well on your way to getting

117
00:04:48,340 --> 00:04:54,460
ready for the produce safety rule so we

118
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:56,410
like to say that the GAAP certification

119
00:04:54,460 --> 00:04:58,090
is like a stepping stone to the produce

120
00:04:56,410 --> 00:05:00,310
safety rule and in some cases depending

121
00:04:58,090 --> 00:05:02,789
on what sort of GAAP audit you want to

122
00:05:00,310 --> 00:05:05,289
target if you are following all of those

123
00:05:02,789 --> 00:05:06,880
all those standards in that particular

124
00:05:05,289 --> 00:05:08,229
gap audit you're actually already

125
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,449
completely aligned with the produce

126
00:05:08,229 --> 00:05:12,669
safety rules so when you can double dip

127
00:05:10,449 --> 00:05:15,729
please do so because we don't want you

128
00:05:12,669 --> 00:05:17,759
to duplicate efforts in any way so a

129
00:05:15,729 --> 00:05:19,840
little bit into how they're different

130
00:05:17,759 --> 00:05:21,940
this is only going to touch on a few

131
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,669
things of how they're different if you

132
00:05:21,940 --> 00:05:26,349
are interested in reading how the GAAP

133
00:05:24,669 --> 00:05:27,930
audits and the produce safety rule

134
00:05:26,349 --> 00:05:30,280
inspections are really different

135
00:05:27,930 --> 00:05:32,110
University of Maryland extension and the

136
00:05:30,280 --> 00:05:33,699
agricultural law education initiative

137
00:05:32,110 --> 00:05:36,849
came up with this really great handout

138
00:05:33,699 --> 00:05:38,560
that goes into a lot of detail into the

139
00:05:36,849 --> 00:05:40,570
differences in the similarities they're

140
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,639
available I have them here I'll have

141
00:05:40,570 --> 00:05:44,349
them in the back table across the wall

142
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:45,669
over here if you would like to take and

143
00:05:44,349 --> 00:05:47,289
read some more they're also available

144
00:05:45,669 --> 00:05:50,169
online because there are a lot of links

145
00:05:47,289 --> 00:05:53,080
associated with this table as well but

146
00:05:50,169 --> 00:05:55,030
as I mentioned before number one the gap

147
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:57,880
audit program is a voluntary program

148
00:05:55,030 --> 00:06:00,070
dictated by what your buyer market wants

149
00:05:57,880 --> 00:06:02,680
and the produce safety rule is mandatory

150
00:06:00,070 --> 00:06:04,389
under the produce safety rule also a

151
00:06:02,680 --> 00:06:07,060
Maryland Department of Ag is rolling out

152
00:06:04,389 --> 00:06:08,740
a registration for growers so every

153
00:06:07,060 --> 00:06:10,570
grower in the state of Maryland is going

154
00:06:08,740 --> 00:06:12,669
to have to register with the Maryland

155
00:06:10,570 --> 00:06:16,030
Department of Ag and that's just so the

156
00:06:12,669 --> 00:06:19,090
Maryland Department of Ag can kind of

157
00:06:16,030 --> 00:06:21,580
figure out where they need to put you in

158
00:06:19,090 --> 00:06:23,440
terms of when you're gonna be inspected

159
00:06:21,580 --> 00:06:24,970
in the produce safety rules so if you're

160
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,349
a grower that's growing under five

161
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:28,599
hundred thousand dollars worth of

162
00:06:26,349 --> 00:06:30,610
produce you're going to be inspected

163
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,320
either this year or the next year

164
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:33,909
but if you're a grower who it has not

165
00:06:32,320 --> 00:06:35,289
been inspected yet and is growing over

166
00:06:33,909 --> 00:06:37,479
five hundred thousand dollars with the

167
00:06:35,289 --> 00:06:39,010
produce once you get registered you're

168
00:06:37,479 --> 00:06:41,230
going to be put up in the priority list

169
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:42,760
for an MDA inspection and

170
00:06:41,230 --> 00:06:44,320
not scary at all we'll get into them at

171
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,350
the at the end of this at the end of

172
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:50,110
this at the end of this talk so covered

173
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,390
produce so again because the GAAP audit

174
00:06:50,110 --> 00:06:54,400
is a voluntary program you dictate to

175
00:06:52,390 --> 00:06:57,160
the auditor what sort of products you

176
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,650
want gap certified so if you are a

177
00:06:57,160 --> 00:07:01,270
farmer and you have apples and you have

178
00:06:59,650 --> 00:07:03,730
kale for pick-your-own and then you have

179
00:07:01,270 --> 00:07:05,830
sweet corn you can choose to just get a

180
00:07:03,730 --> 00:07:07,840
gap audit and a gap certification just

181
00:07:05,830 --> 00:07:09,340
for the apples so that the auditor only

182
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,740
goes out and takes a look at what the

183
00:07:09,340 --> 00:07:13,270
practices are with your apples that's

184
00:07:11,740 --> 00:07:15,720
different from the produce safety rule

185
00:07:13,270 --> 00:07:18,160
the produce safety rule MDA

186
00:07:15,720 --> 00:07:19,960
inspector is going to come out and take

187
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,110
a look at your practices that pertain to

188
00:07:19,960 --> 00:07:25,000
all the crops that are eaten raw on your

189
00:07:23,110 --> 00:07:28,720
on your property so in that same example

190
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,270
of having apples and kale and sweet corn

191
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,220
they're gonna look at the apples and the

192
00:07:31,270 --> 00:07:35,500
kale because both of those are eaten raw

193
00:07:33,220 --> 00:07:36,870
and they're not going to be as they're

194
00:07:35,500 --> 00:07:43,630
not going to look at your practices

195
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:46,300
regarding sweet corn so exemptions to

196
00:07:43,630 --> 00:07:49,230
this rule the next part down here under

197
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:52,870
the voluntary program you can be exempt

198
00:07:49,230 --> 00:07:54,820
based on what your buyer what your buyer

199
00:07:52,870 --> 00:07:56,620
requirements are so there I know I do

200
00:07:54,820 --> 00:07:59,230
know some buyers in some grocery stores

201
00:07:56,620 --> 00:08:00,910
will allow you to start selling to them

202
00:07:59,230 --> 00:08:02,410
if you don't have an audit yet but with

203
00:08:00,910 --> 00:08:04,570
a written assurance that you're going to

204
00:08:02,410 --> 00:08:05,860
get an audit in the next year so so you

205
00:08:04,570 --> 00:08:07,470
could kind of work with your buyer on

206
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,580
the expectations they have with you

207
00:08:07,470 --> 00:08:11,440
exemptions on the produce safety rule

208
00:08:09,580 --> 00:08:14,170
because this is a federal regulation the

209
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:16,450
exemptions are real complicated and real

210
00:08:14,170 --> 00:08:19,480
murky and every single one of them has a

211
00:08:16,450 --> 00:08:21,190
record associated with it so I'm gonna

212
00:08:19,480 --> 00:08:23,260
just briefly talk about it here but if

213
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:25,270
you think that you might be exempt or if

214
00:08:23,260 --> 00:08:27,730
you think that you might be qualified

215
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:29,740
exempt to talk to me after this talk or

216
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:31,200
we could talk to Carol as well so if

217
00:08:29,740 --> 00:08:33,700
you're a farm that's growing under

218
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,490
27,000 dollars worth of produce a year

219
00:08:33,700 --> 00:08:38,979
you can be exempt and there is a

220
00:08:36,490 --> 00:08:40,240
registration associated with each one of

221
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:41,860
these right so there's registration

222
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,330
associated with if you're growing under

223
00:08:41,860 --> 00:08:45,940
twenty seven thousand five hundred and

224
00:08:43,330 --> 00:08:48,070
twenty eight dollars of produce it's

225
00:08:45,940 --> 00:08:50,290
adjusted for inflation each year which

226
00:08:48,070 --> 00:08:53,050
is our job to keep up on so we can let

227
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:55,480
you know if you if all the produce on

228
00:08:53,050 --> 00:08:57,940
your farm is all going to further

229
00:08:55,480 --> 00:08:59,980
there's a specific exemption for that so

230
00:08:57,940 --> 00:09:01,210
let us know if you're growing all you're

231
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:03,460
growing is spinach and it's getting

232
00:09:01,210 --> 00:09:05,560
canned let us know we can direct you to

233
00:09:03,460 --> 00:09:09,190
the right registration form to fill out

234
00:09:05,560 --> 00:09:11,460
for that the last one is if everything

235
00:09:09,190 --> 00:09:15,220
you're growing on your farm is just as

236
00:09:11,460 --> 00:09:18,100
not eaten raw so if you're just doing a

237
00:09:15,220 --> 00:09:20,470
whole farm full of winter squash for

238
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:22,720
some reason then you can be that crop is

239
00:09:20,470 --> 00:09:24,490
rarely eaten raw and there's another

240
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:27,100
potential exemption that you can apply

241
00:09:24,490 --> 00:09:30,520
for for that okay so those are the

242
00:09:27,100 --> 00:09:34,090
exemptions if you are a farmer that may

243
00:09:30,520 --> 00:09:36,070
find yourself in the category of selling

244
00:09:34,090 --> 00:09:38,020
between twenty seven thousand dollars a

245
00:09:36,070 --> 00:09:40,360
year in produce and five hundred and

246
00:09:38,020 --> 00:09:44,860
fifty five hundred and fifty one

247
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:48,490
thousand dollars 550 550 one yeah

248
00:09:44,860 --> 00:09:49,780
mmm-hmm that that one is important so if

249
00:09:48,490 --> 00:09:52,360
you're between twenty seven and five

250
00:09:49,780 --> 00:09:54,370
hundred and fifty then you could

251
00:09:52,360 --> 00:09:56,770
potentially be under a qualified

252
00:09:54,370 --> 00:09:59,290
exemption that you could apply for a

253
00:09:56,770 --> 00:10:01,090
qualified exemption so in addition to

254
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,860
your produce sales if you're in that

255
00:10:01,090 --> 00:10:05,110
bracket you're going to also want to

256
00:10:02,860 --> 00:10:08,890
roll in any other food sales that you

257
00:10:05,110 --> 00:10:12,610
have so that involves any livestock that

258
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:14,950
you're selling any jams or jellies that

259
00:10:12,610 --> 00:10:16,570
you're selling as well so you roll in

260
00:10:14,950 --> 00:10:22,630
all the other food that you're selling

261
00:10:16,570 --> 00:10:24,490
and who that food is being sold to so it

262
00:10:22,630 --> 00:10:27,730
gets very complicated we're not going to

263
00:10:24,490 --> 00:10:31,180
go into it at this talk but if you think

264
00:10:27,730 --> 00:10:33,610
that you are between 27 and 550 of

265
00:10:31,180 --> 00:10:36,670
produce and you think you want to apply

266
00:10:33,610 --> 00:10:38,050
for a qualified exemption then come talk

267
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:39,550
to me afterwards we'll get you all

268
00:10:38,050 --> 00:10:41,980
situated basically what you're going to

269
00:10:39,550 --> 00:10:43,420
have to do is keep sales records of all

270
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:46,540
the food you're selling and who you're

271
00:10:43,420 --> 00:10:49,870
selling it to to maintain to MDA that

272
00:10:46,540 --> 00:10:51,550
you are still within this structure to

273
00:10:49,870 --> 00:10:54,420
be qualified exempt and you'll have to

274
00:10:51,550 --> 00:10:56,860
keep those records for three years okay

275
00:10:54,420 --> 00:10:59,290
or you can just choose to be fully

276
00:10:56,860 --> 00:11:01,690
covered and you will be in the bank of

277
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:03,220
farms that MDA will come out and inspect

278
00:11:01,690 --> 00:11:05,200
if you don't want to go through all that

279
00:11:03,220 --> 00:11:07,940
all that record-keeping you can choose

280
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,210
to do that as I mentioned before

281
00:11:07,940 --> 00:11:13,010
with with the voluntary audit you are

282
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,390
gonna get a paper certificate of

283
00:11:13,010 --> 00:11:16,610
compliance and this is what buyers

284
00:11:14,390 --> 00:11:18,080
really like to see and there's no sort

285
00:11:16,610 --> 00:11:22,790
of paper certificate of compliance

286
00:11:18,080 --> 00:11:25,370
associated with a PSR inspection other

287
00:11:22,790 --> 00:11:26,930
general differences if anyone's familiar

288
00:11:25,370 --> 00:11:29,980
who is familiar with the food safety

289
00:11:26,930 --> 00:11:31,400
plan who has written a food safety plan

290
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:35,090
okay cool

291
00:11:31,400 --> 00:11:36,830
all right okay so for your GAAP audits

292
00:11:35,090 --> 00:11:38,780
you have to have a written food safety

293
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:40,550
plan that an auditor will come and take

294
00:11:38,780 --> 00:11:42,110
a look at what sort of practices

295
00:11:40,550 --> 00:11:44,120
policies and procedures you have in

296
00:11:42,110 --> 00:11:45,740
place on your farm and for the produce

297
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:47,510
safety rule it's not really required to

298
00:11:45,740 --> 00:11:49,790
do that but it's recommended because it

299
00:11:47,510 --> 00:11:51,770
just keeps everybody more organized and

300
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:53,300
it keeps the inspector on your farm for

301
00:11:51,770 --> 00:11:56,350
a shorter amount of time if you have

302
00:11:53,300 --> 00:11:59,690
everything organized into a written plan

303
00:11:56,350 --> 00:12:02,510
for trace back and recall some of the

304
00:11:59,690 --> 00:12:05,030
audits outline that you should have a

305
00:12:02,510 --> 00:12:07,220
trace back and recall plan so this means

306
00:12:05,030 --> 00:12:09,140
that you have a lot system for your

307
00:12:07,220 --> 00:12:11,720
products and you know you can trace it

308
00:12:09,140 --> 00:12:13,580
back from where it was in the field and

309
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:16,130
trace it forward to where it's going to

310
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:18,290
specific buyers so some audits require

311
00:12:16,130 --> 00:12:21,290
that the MDA gap audit does not which is

312
00:12:18,290 --> 00:12:24,170
the baseline type of audit that you can

313
00:12:21,290 --> 00:12:25,820
get it's it this is also not required

314
00:12:24,170 --> 00:12:27,560
for the produce safety rule unless

315
00:12:25,820 --> 00:12:31,460
you're doing some on-farm processing

316
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:34,520
like making ciders or jams or jellies or

317
00:12:31,460 --> 00:12:37,580
something like that the record-keeping

318
00:12:34,520 --> 00:12:39,200
is various between the two there are six

319
00:12:37,580 --> 00:12:42,140
required records for the produce safety

320
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,920
rule and we'll get into what is needed

321
00:12:42,140 --> 00:12:47,690
on those records in a little bit and

322
00:12:44,920 --> 00:12:49,820
when we get there I would recommend that

323
00:12:47,690 --> 00:12:51,320
everybody take a look and just add the

324
00:12:49,820 --> 00:12:53,330
things that are required for the produce

325
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:55,100
safety rule on whatever record that you

326
00:12:53,330 --> 00:12:57,920
are already doing so that you don't have

327
00:12:55,100 --> 00:12:59,600
to create two records for the same thing

328
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,340
right there are some easy ways that you

329
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:02,900
can comply with the produce safety rule

330
00:13:01,340 --> 00:13:05,840
with things that you already have and

331
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,030
then just kind of rounding us out the

332
00:13:05,840 --> 00:13:09,860
produce safety rule is just focused on

333
00:13:08,030 --> 00:13:11,270
microbial hazards it doesn't talk about

334
00:13:09,860 --> 00:13:13,040
chemical and physical hazards

335
00:13:11,270 --> 00:13:14,780
however in audits you're going to have

336
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:17,870
to want to keep a record of the

337
00:13:14,780 --> 00:13:19,730
pesticide applicator license and other

338
00:13:17,870 --> 00:13:21,610
Burbidge about how you're mitigating

339
00:13:19,730 --> 00:13:24,080
chemical and physical hazards

340
00:13:21,610 --> 00:13:26,150
okay so into the different gap audits

341
00:13:24,080 --> 00:13:28,010
that you can pursue if you would like to

342
00:13:26,150 --> 00:13:29,750
depending on if you want to open up

343
00:13:28,010 --> 00:13:31,910
market access to different buyers and

344
00:13:29,750 --> 00:13:33,530
different wholesale opportunities they

345
00:13:31,910 --> 00:13:37,190
range from less intensive to most

346
00:13:33,530 --> 00:13:39,710
intensive and the different the

347
00:13:37,190 --> 00:13:41,930
intensity of the audit kind of just goes

348
00:13:39,710 --> 00:13:44,300
with how many more paper records you're

349
00:13:41,930 --> 00:13:47,570
gonna have to keep the practices are

350
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:49,520
very very similar among all of these as

351
00:13:47,570 --> 00:13:51,440
I had mentioned before they all outline

352
00:13:49,520 --> 00:13:53,750
practices around workers fertilizer

353
00:13:51,440 --> 00:13:56,180
water quality maintaining and testing

354
00:13:53,750 --> 00:13:57,830
water quality your cleaning and

355
00:13:56,180 --> 00:14:00,140
sanitizing schedules for your tools

356
00:13:57,830 --> 00:14:02,000
equipments and your building how you're

357
00:14:00,140 --> 00:14:03,200
inspecting different trucks that are

358
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:06,590
coming onto your property to haul

359
00:14:03,200 --> 00:14:09,050
produce temperature controls and

360
00:14:06,590 --> 00:14:11,390
monitoring for animals so if you have

361
00:14:09,050 --> 00:14:13,550
not done a gap audit before and you

362
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:15,170
would like to get into this world of gap

363
00:14:13,550 --> 00:14:16,370
audits I would really recommend starting

364
00:14:15,170 --> 00:14:18,320
with an MDA gap

365
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:19,670
it requires the least amount of records

366
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,140
in the least amount of time to get you

367
00:14:19,670 --> 00:14:22,790
started it's very likely that you're

368
00:14:21,140 --> 00:14:25,100
already doing most of these practices

369
00:14:22,790 --> 00:14:26,630
that is outlined in an MDA gap audit you

370
00:14:25,100 --> 00:14:28,640
just got to write it all down in a way

371
00:14:26,630 --> 00:14:30,800
that an auditor can take a look at and

372
00:14:28,640 --> 00:14:33,020
give you a passing grade on right and

373
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,540
there's also some records required to it

374
00:14:33,020 --> 00:14:37,790
getting getting used to starting to put

375
00:14:35,540 --> 00:14:40,400
records together is is a bit of a hurdle

376
00:14:37,790 --> 00:14:42,050
but once your rips once your started

377
00:14:40,400 --> 00:14:44,839
with records it's a lot easier to keep

378
00:14:42,050 --> 00:14:46,400
going with record-keeping if you're

379
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:48,350
interested in some of these more intense

380
00:14:46,400 --> 00:14:51,170
audits they're going to include

381
00:14:48,350 --> 00:14:53,089
different parts and a produce safety and

382
00:14:51,170 --> 00:14:55,250
a produce safety plan some of them

383
00:14:53,089 --> 00:14:56,930
require written risk assessments so how

384
00:14:55,250 --> 00:14:59,510
you know when you're going out to a

385
00:14:56,930 --> 00:15:01,940
field it's ready for harvest some of

386
00:14:59,510 --> 00:15:03,950
those audits require a record associated

387
00:15:01,940 --> 00:15:05,570
with I know my field is now ready for

388
00:15:03,950 --> 00:15:07,820
harvest again it's things that you're

389
00:15:05,570 --> 00:15:10,130
already doing the auditor just wants it

390
00:15:07,820 --> 00:15:11,770
in paper form now which is quite

391
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:14,420
laborious I definitely understand that

392
00:15:11,770 --> 00:15:17,030
they also want things outlined like

393
00:15:14,420 --> 00:15:19,610
different defense plans corrective

394
00:15:17,030 --> 00:15:20,930
action plans so again something that

395
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,760
you're probably already doing you

396
00:15:20,930 --> 00:15:25,280
probably already have a plan in place

397
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:27,680
for if a port-a-potty falls over or if

398
00:15:25,280 --> 00:15:29,720
you see a worker who is just not washing

399
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:31,070
their hands ever right what the plan in

400
00:15:29,720 --> 00:15:32,959
place is that you're going to go over to

401
00:15:31,070 --> 00:15:34,250
that person and retrain them right and

402
00:15:32,959 --> 00:15:37,430
in these different

403
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:39,110
audits they're there in these more

404
00:15:37,430 --> 00:15:40,940
intense audits they're just asking that

405
00:15:39,110 --> 00:15:43,640
that's written down and formalized in

406
00:15:40,940 --> 00:15:47,470
paragraph form which Carol and I can

407
00:15:43,640 --> 00:15:51,290
help you do if you are interested in

408
00:15:47,470 --> 00:15:53,690
getting an audit so MDA can come out and

409
00:15:51,290 --> 00:15:54,770
perform any of these audits here there

410
00:15:53,690 --> 00:15:57,560
they're not going to come out and

411
00:15:54,770 --> 00:15:59,000
perform the global gap on it but MDA can

412
00:15:57,560 --> 00:16:01,880
come out and perform all these audits

413
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:03,710
and in 20 the twenty twenty year is a

414
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:07,490
good time to get an audit done because a

415
00:16:03,710 --> 00:16:09,920
lot of those because of MDA has found

416
00:16:07,490 --> 00:16:12,140
funds for them to be either free or for

417
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,810
you to get reimbursed so the MDA gap on

418
00:16:12,140 --> 00:16:17,180
it is free if you'd like to get an H gap

419
00:16:14,810 --> 00:16:20,330
on it there's 100% reimbursement on that

420
00:16:17,180 --> 00:16:22,400
audit so it's also free you can get cost

421
00:16:20,330 --> 00:16:25,010
share for any group cat op group gap

422
00:16:22,400 --> 00:16:28,180
audits you're looking to get and if you

423
00:16:25,010 --> 00:16:30,590
are interested in the harmonized gaps

424
00:16:28,180 --> 00:16:32,300
there is a reimbursement for the first

425
00:16:30,590 --> 00:16:34,160
four hundred dollars of certification

426
00:16:32,300 --> 00:16:36,140
and seventy-five percent of costs over

427
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,540
four hundred dollars so this year is a

428
00:16:36,140 --> 00:16:39,890
good year to pursue this because I'm not

429
00:16:38,540 --> 00:16:45,530
sure if these funds are going to be

430
00:16:39,890 --> 00:16:46,100
available in next year's so now is the

431
00:16:45,530 --> 00:16:50,630
time to do it

432
00:16:46,100 --> 00:16:52,339
um the stars over here go to the fact

433
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:53,990
that some of these audits are fully

434
00:16:52,339 --> 00:16:56,060
aligned with the produce safety rule

435
00:16:53,990 --> 00:16:58,610
meaning that if you're completing all of

436
00:16:56,060 --> 00:17:00,410
these things for this particular audit

437
00:16:58,610 --> 00:17:01,880
you're also aligned for everything

438
00:17:00,410 --> 00:17:05,180
underneath the produce safety rule and

439
00:17:01,880 --> 00:17:08,030
then also for those bigger farmers if

440
00:17:05,180 --> 00:17:11,420
you are selling to a larger grocery

441
00:17:08,030 --> 00:17:13,459
store like Wegmans or Walmart or if you

442
00:17:11,420 --> 00:17:16,010
would like to sell internationally there

443
00:17:13,459 --> 00:17:19,040
are audits that MDA can perform for you

444
00:17:16,010 --> 00:17:21,350
that are global GFCI equivalent global

445
00:17:19,040 --> 00:17:22,730
food safety initiative equivalent so

446
00:17:21,350 --> 00:17:23,839
that's available to you alright so if

447
00:17:22,730 --> 00:17:25,130
you're sitting in your seat and you're

448
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:26,510
saying okay this is all well and good

449
00:17:25,130 --> 00:17:28,730
but I don't know what the steps to

450
00:17:26,510 --> 00:17:29,870
actually get this done are the first

451
00:17:28,730 --> 00:17:32,240
thing that you're going to need to do is

452
00:17:29,870 --> 00:17:34,040
designate it be someone's job on the

453
00:17:32,240 --> 00:17:36,830
farm to be a food safety officer and

454
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:39,290
that person is going to be record man

455
00:17:36,830 --> 00:17:42,980
number one unfortunately or fortunately

456
00:17:39,290 --> 00:17:43,700
if they like records right so and then

457
00:17:42,980 --> 00:17:45,830
we

458
00:17:43,700 --> 00:17:47,360
you go to a food safety training you

459
00:17:45,830 --> 00:17:48,799
have that appointed person go to a food

460
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:50,000
safety training there are multiple

461
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:51,350
throughout the state of Maryland that

462
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:54,320
we're doing this year we do them every

463
00:17:51,350 --> 00:17:56,870
winter however if we get a quorum of

464
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:58,970
farmers who are like we would like a gap

465
00:17:56,870 --> 00:18:00,260
class in the fall we would also hold one

466
00:17:58,970 --> 00:18:02,480
in the fall it's based on availability

467
00:18:00,260 --> 00:18:04,010
and interest so you'll go to a food

468
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:05,539
safety training you'll start writing

469
00:18:04,010 --> 00:18:07,460
down the guts of your food safety plans

470
00:18:05,539 --> 00:18:09,649
as I mentioned before these are all your

471
00:18:07,460 --> 00:18:12,380
written policies they're gonna be your

472
00:18:09,649 --> 00:18:14,720
records they're gonna be any SOPs that

473
00:18:12,380 --> 00:18:16,279
you have and they're gonna be any risk

474
00:18:14,720 --> 00:18:17,990
assessments that you're making and any

475
00:18:16,279 --> 00:18:20,090
plans that you have in place in case

476
00:18:17,990 --> 00:18:23,000
things go wrong so that is all included

477
00:18:20,090 --> 00:18:24,919
in the guts of a food safety plan you'll

478
00:18:23,000 --> 00:18:26,450
keep things like your pesticide

479
00:18:24,919 --> 00:18:28,309
applicator license in there you'll keep

480
00:18:26,450 --> 00:18:31,760
things like your water testing report in

481
00:18:28,309 --> 00:18:33,559
there risk assessments as I had said

482
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:37,850
before then what you're going to want to

483
00:18:33,559 --> 00:18:39,919
do is start trying to see how what you

484
00:18:37,850 --> 00:18:41,690
wrote down is actually aligning with the

485
00:18:39,919 --> 00:18:46,279
practices you do on your farm because

486
00:18:41,690 --> 00:18:47,840
auditors will the audit goes off of

487
00:18:46,279 --> 00:18:49,519
based what you're writing down that

488
00:18:47,840 --> 00:18:51,409
you're saying so if you're writing it

489
00:18:49,519 --> 00:18:52,789
down you should do it and if it's

490
00:18:51,409 --> 00:18:54,350
something that you're not doing on your

491
00:18:52,789 --> 00:18:55,850
farm don't write it down because that's

492
00:18:54,350 --> 00:18:57,620
a way that an auditor will ding you

493
00:18:55,850 --> 00:19:00,740
right they've grade you off based off of

494
00:18:57,620 --> 00:19:03,289
what you're saying you're doing it's

495
00:19:00,740 --> 00:19:05,419
also a good idea to have a day where

496
00:19:03,289 --> 00:19:07,279
you're a mock auditor yourself and you

497
00:19:05,419 --> 00:19:08,809
go out to your workers and you see if

498
00:19:07,279 --> 00:19:10,370
they're following the practices that

499
00:19:08,809 --> 00:19:11,929
you're you wrote down that you said

500
00:19:10,370 --> 00:19:14,149
you're doing and it gives you a little

501
00:19:11,929 --> 00:19:17,240
bit of an opportunity to kind of self

502
00:19:14,149 --> 00:19:18,889
evaluate and augment the plan or your

503
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,139
records or anything before an auditor

504
00:19:18,889 --> 00:19:23,360
comes and then you want to schedule and

505
00:19:21,139 --> 00:19:25,039
pass a third party on it when can you

506
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,419
call Carroll or myself to help you

507
00:19:25,039 --> 00:19:28,190
through this you can call us during

508
00:19:26,419 --> 00:19:30,350
almost every single part of the process

509
00:19:28,190 --> 00:19:32,360
we cannot be the auditor for you

510
00:19:30,350 --> 00:19:33,830
unfortunately we would love to be but if

511
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:35,750
you have any questions about how to

512
00:19:33,830 --> 00:19:37,850
develop SOPs if you want second eyes

513
00:19:35,750 --> 00:19:39,889
reviewing a food safety plan if you're

514
00:19:37,850 --> 00:19:41,750
not sure how to write a food safety plan

515
00:19:39,889 --> 00:19:44,120
please get up with us we can definitely

516
00:19:41,750 --> 00:19:46,429
help you because it's having a written

517
00:19:44,120 --> 00:19:50,990
food safety plan is a great way to grow

518
00:19:46,429 --> 00:19:52,970
your business so you can get a bunch of

519
00:19:50,990 --> 00:19:56,120
templates online for food safety plans

520
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,980
the MDA has a template food safety plan

521
00:19:56,120 --> 00:19:59,960
that's a good plug and chug

522
00:19:57,980 --> 00:20:02,540
there's also for those growers who are

523
00:19:59,960 --> 00:20:06,080
interested in h gap a more stringent

524
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:07,940
type of gap audit there's a template

525
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:10,700
from the well there's a handbook on how

526
00:20:07,940 --> 00:20:12,620
to write your plan from the carolina

527
00:20:10,700 --> 00:20:14,780
farm stewardship Association there's

528
00:20:12,620 --> 00:20:17,960
also a good plug and chug template from

529
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:20,030
the produce safety Alliance that I can

530
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:21,650
send to Mike and he could send out to

531
00:20:20,030 --> 00:20:24,010
people if they're interested that's

532
00:20:21,650 --> 00:20:26,350
another really good plug and chug one

533
00:20:24,010 --> 00:20:28,910
hmm

534
00:20:26,350 --> 00:20:30,980
yeah yeah that's pretty safe do you like

535
00:20:28,910 --> 00:20:34,280
well yeah it's Cornell the Cornell gap

536
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:35,900
program yes Thank You Carol as I had

537
00:20:34,280 --> 00:20:38,690
mentioned before keep it simple and easy

538
00:20:35,900 --> 00:20:40,880
to follow structure it based on what the

539
00:20:38,690 --> 00:20:42,650
auditor how the auditor is gonna go

540
00:20:40,880 --> 00:20:45,440
through your farm so there are different

541
00:20:42,650 --> 00:20:47,420
scopes that are required in each of the

542
00:20:45,440 --> 00:20:49,400
the audits and just have your verbage

543
00:20:47,420 --> 00:20:51,050
structured exactly like that because you

544
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,140
don't want that person on your farm any

545
00:20:51,050 --> 00:20:55,700
longer than they need to be use tables

546
00:20:54,140 --> 00:20:57,260
liberally like when you don't have to

547
00:20:55,700 --> 00:21:00,380
write a paragraph you don't need to you

548
00:20:57,260 --> 00:21:02,900
can use a table if it's easier and other

549
00:21:00,380 --> 00:21:04,520
sort of conventions like bolding as I

550
00:21:02,900 --> 00:21:05,930
mentioned before it's not a wish list so

551
00:21:04,520 --> 00:21:07,160
just write down everything that you are

552
00:21:05,930 --> 00:21:10,490
doing and things that you're not doing

553
00:21:07,160 --> 00:21:11,870
don't write it down and make sure even

554
00:21:10,490 --> 00:21:14,690
with these if you're using a plug and

555
00:21:11,870 --> 00:21:17,450
chug that you're erasing the things that

556
00:21:14,690 --> 00:21:19,370
are not happening on your farm or if

557
00:21:17,450 --> 00:21:21,050
they cover a different type of crop

558
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,990
you're making sure that it's tailored to

559
00:21:21,050 --> 00:21:27,020
the crop that you are writing the plan

560
00:21:23,990 --> 00:21:30,230
for so this is a great way it's an

561
00:21:27,020 --> 00:21:32,450
example to put verbage in a food safety

562
00:21:30,230 --> 00:21:34,520
plan that covers many different phases

563
00:21:32,450 --> 00:21:37,100
at once into paragraphs and feel free to

564
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,410
take a picture of this I got this from

565
00:21:37,100 --> 00:21:42,620
Penn State and it talks about animal

566
00:21:39,410 --> 00:21:44,360
control so if you see here they have a

567
00:21:42,620 --> 00:21:46,640
couple of elements that I think are

568
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,560
really nice all in two paragraphs they

569
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:50,690
have the written policy about what they

570
00:21:48,560 --> 00:21:52,970
do for animals we do all that we can to

571
00:21:50,690 --> 00:21:54,770
keep up domestic and wild animals out of

572
00:21:52,970 --> 00:21:57,710
the fields right so that's a check check

573
00:21:54,770 --> 00:21:59,900
mark off that they have a monitoring log

574
00:21:57,710 --> 00:22:02,390
they reference a monitoring log in here

575
00:21:59,900 --> 00:22:04,640
right we routinely monitor the growing

576
00:22:02,390 --> 00:22:08,450
area and the results are recorded in our

577
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:10,340
monitoring log they have because this is

578
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:10,940
off of a more stringent audit this is

579
00:22:10,340 --> 00:22:13,640
not often

580
00:22:10,940 --> 00:22:16,430
MDA gap audit they have an allusion to a

581
00:22:13,640 --> 00:22:18,440
written risk assessment again if you're

582
00:22:16,430 --> 00:22:20,660
going for an MD a gap audit this does

583
00:22:18,440 --> 00:22:22,850
not need to be in here but they talk

584
00:22:20,660 --> 00:22:24,500
about that they include an inspection

585
00:22:22,850 --> 00:22:26,540
for the presence of animals during your

586
00:22:24,500 --> 00:22:29,090
pre harvest risk assessment and then

587
00:22:26,540 --> 00:22:31,460
they also outline the plan that they're

588
00:22:29,090 --> 00:22:35,720
going to enact in case something other

589
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:38,030
than something non normal happens so if

590
00:22:35,720 --> 00:22:40,010
they find significant evidence of poop

591
00:22:38,030 --> 00:22:41,960
in the field they outline that what they

592
00:22:40,010 --> 00:22:44,330
do is mark off the area with a buffer

593
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,280
and they don't harvest crop within that

594
00:22:44,330 --> 00:22:48,500
buffer and it's removed so this is a

595
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:50,410
really efficient way to get all of the

596
00:22:48,500 --> 00:22:53,750
elements of a food safety plan in

597
00:22:50,410 --> 00:22:55,250
paragraph form and I would really

598
00:22:53,750 --> 00:22:56,660
recommend working off this template

599
00:22:55,250 --> 00:22:58,490
because it's it's just the easiest way

600
00:22:56,660 --> 00:23:00,710
to do it and care a lot Carol and I have

601
00:22:58,490 --> 00:23:03,860
experience in this it can help you help

602
00:23:00,710 --> 00:23:06,380
you move through this kind of on records

603
00:23:03,860 --> 00:23:08,120
as I mentioned before take a look at all

604
00:23:06,380 --> 00:23:09,650
the records that you have right now and

605
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:11,870
we would recommend just making them

606
00:23:09,650 --> 00:23:13,280
produce safety rule compliant and to

607
00:23:11,870 --> 00:23:14,120
make them produce safety rule compliant

608
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:16,070
you're just going to have to add a

609
00:23:14,120 --> 00:23:17,660
couple of these little elements here

610
00:23:16,070 --> 00:23:19,190
you're going to want to add on all of

611
00:23:17,660 --> 00:23:21,950
your records the name and address of

612
00:23:19,190 --> 00:23:24,800
your farm all the records have to be

613
00:23:21,950 --> 00:23:28,340
done at the dated at the exact time that

614
00:23:24,800 --> 00:23:30,650
they're done the date is sufficient they

615
00:23:28,340 --> 00:23:33,290
also go to in in different things like

616
00:23:30,650 --> 00:23:34,850
cleaning and sanitizing produce safety

617
00:23:33,290 --> 00:23:37,760
rule records want you to outline what

618
00:23:34,850 --> 00:23:40,340
methods you're using so you in this

619
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:42,320
example it is writing out what the

620
00:23:40,340 --> 00:23:44,180
method is but we all know we don't have

621
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,490
time for that so what you can do instead

622
00:23:44,180 --> 00:23:48,200
is you could reference an SOP up top

623
00:23:46,490 --> 00:23:49,820
here and you could just reference like

624
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:50,990
everyone was trained in this specific

625
00:23:49,820 --> 00:23:52,910
way to clean and sanitize things

626
00:23:50,990 --> 00:23:55,130
reference the SOP and this could be a

627
00:23:52,910 --> 00:24:00,740
check mark you could say clean and

628
00:23:55,130 --> 00:24:02,480
sanitizing harvest knives SOP right the

629
00:24:00,740 --> 00:24:05,840
other thing that produce safety records

630
00:24:02,480 --> 00:24:07,540
need is that they are at the end of the

631
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,470
record you know you have your worker

632
00:24:07,540 --> 00:24:11,360
signing them and at the end of the

633
00:24:09,470 --> 00:24:13,670
record the food safety officer is going

634
00:24:11,360 --> 00:24:19,040
to want to review them title them and

635
00:24:13,670 --> 00:24:20,720
date them alright so what can Carol and

636
00:24:19,040 --> 00:24:22,280
I help you with well we can help you

637
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:24,310
write your food safety plan we can help

638
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:25,720
review your food safety plan we

639
00:24:24,310 --> 00:24:27,340
take a look at your practices that

640
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:29,140
you're doing on the farm you can have us

641
00:24:27,340 --> 00:24:30,820
out we can take a look and prioritize

642
00:24:29,140 --> 00:24:32,890
what different things you're going to

643
00:24:30,820 --> 00:24:35,170
want to target for this year and your

644
00:24:32,890 --> 00:24:37,600
food safety goals we can help you

645
00:24:35,170 --> 00:24:40,570
interpret water test results or get your

646
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:42,130
water testing program started if you

647
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:44,110
haven't already started it and then

648
00:24:42,130 --> 00:24:46,000
furthermore we can also help you devise

649
00:24:44,110 --> 00:24:47,860
a cleaning and sanitizing program for

650
00:24:46,000 --> 00:24:49,990
different tools and equipment on your

651
00:24:47,860 --> 00:24:51,730
farm so if you're not sure what things

652
00:24:49,990 --> 00:24:53,470
you should be cleaning and sanitizing or

653
00:24:51,730 --> 00:24:55,300
how often you should be doing it or how

654
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:58,210
you need to be recording it or if it's

655
00:24:55,300 --> 00:25:00,460
effective let us know and we could come

656
00:24:58,210 --> 00:25:02,980
out and help you with that there are

657
00:25:00,460 --> 00:25:04,480
also a bunch of resources both around

658
00:25:02,980 --> 00:25:05,950
the country and in Maryland that you

659
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:07,840
could take advantage of to help you with

660
00:25:05,950 --> 00:25:08,770
your food safety goals as I mentioned

661
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:10,900
there's a template for pretty much

662
00:25:08,770 --> 00:25:12,640
anything you could ever want there are a

663
00:25:10,900 --> 00:25:14,980
lot of signs that we made and some of

664
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:16,480
these signs suffice the recommendation

665
00:25:14,980 --> 00:25:18,130
or sorry the requirements for the

666
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:21,430
produce safety rule there's a visitor

667
00:25:18,130 --> 00:25:23,230
sign so especially those of you who have

668
00:25:21,430 --> 00:25:24,460
picked your owns I would recommend

669
00:25:23,230 --> 00:25:26,440
getting one of these signs so this

670
00:25:24,460 --> 00:25:27,850
outlines the policies that a visitor

671
00:25:26,440 --> 00:25:29,770
should be following when they come to

672
00:25:27,850 --> 00:25:31,630
your farm it talks about not picking one

673
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,980
stick not bringing their pets not

674
00:25:31,630 --> 00:25:36,010
bringing food and drink into the field

675
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,960
washing their hands and farm kids safety

676
00:25:36,010 --> 00:25:40,450
I think it says on here plants are not

677
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:42,280
toys which I really like so I have these

678
00:25:40,450 --> 00:25:43,810
available out here I have like six

679
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:45,610
available and we can order more so

680
00:25:43,810 --> 00:25:47,770
they're all free for you for taking if

681
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:51,340
you would like to have one we have other

682
00:25:47,770 --> 00:25:52,960
signs as well also we have worker

683
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:55,120
training supplements so the produce

684
00:25:52,960 --> 00:25:57,430
safety rule not only wants you to show

685
00:25:55,120 --> 00:26:00,790
the Cornell video to have all your

686
00:25:57,430 --> 00:26:02,890
workers trained in hygiene but they also

687
00:26:00,790 --> 00:26:05,200
want your workers trained in doing their

688
00:26:02,890 --> 00:26:07,380
specific jobs so Maryland Department of

689
00:26:05,200 --> 00:26:10,480
Ag actually came up with four

690
00:26:07,380 --> 00:26:12,820
powerpoints and videos that are in

691
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:14,860
English in Spanish both for harvest

692
00:26:12,820 --> 00:26:17,110
training post harvest training working

693
00:26:14,860 --> 00:26:18,850
with animals and general food safety so

694
00:26:17,110 --> 00:26:22,210
you can show these to your workers and

695
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,070
that will suffice the other requirement

696
00:26:22,210 --> 00:26:27,580
of training for the produce safety rule

697
00:26:24,070 --> 00:26:29,680
and then we can also provide the

698
00:26:27,580 --> 00:26:32,500
resource of trail tailored training to

699
00:26:29,680 --> 00:26:34,720
your needs that's where the the survey

700
00:26:32,500 --> 00:26:36,600
comes in so the our survey is the yellow

701
00:26:34,720 --> 00:26:38,100
one in your little booklet

702
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:40,310
we really appreciate if you fill this

703
00:26:38,100 --> 00:26:43,050
out this lets us know what types of

704
00:26:40,310 --> 00:26:45,570
training topics you would like to have

705
00:26:43,050 --> 00:26:48,000
in this area and we're in this area is

706
00:26:45,570 --> 00:26:50,310
most convenient for you for us to come

707
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:54,750
train so please fill this out I'll be

708
00:26:50,310 --> 00:26:57,210
collecting these at lunchtime all right

709
00:26:54,750 --> 00:26:58,500
back with the PSR compliance dates for

710
00:26:57,210 --> 00:27:00,750
the produce safety rule so if you're a

711
00:26:58,500 --> 00:27:03,780
grower that's growing over 500,000 worth

712
00:27:00,750 --> 00:27:06,840
of product expect that the MDA will be

713
00:27:03,780 --> 00:27:08,490
calling you soon to get an inspection if

714
00:27:06,840 --> 00:27:10,080
you're a grower that is growing between

715
00:27:08,490 --> 00:27:11,280
two hundred fifty thousand dollars of

716
00:27:10,080 --> 00:27:13,290
product and five hundred thousand

717
00:27:11,280 --> 00:27:14,760
dollars a product this year is the year

718
00:27:13,290 --> 00:27:17,850
that you're going to be inspected and

719
00:27:14,760 --> 00:27:20,730
then small businesses between 25 and 250

720
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:22,710
you've got till next year again as I

721
00:27:20,730 --> 00:27:25,700
mentioned in the top if you think if

722
00:27:22,710 --> 00:27:28,410
you're someone that's between 27,000 and

723
00:27:25,700 --> 00:27:30,360
$500,000 worth of produce and you think

724
00:27:28,410 --> 00:27:32,460
you might want to apply for this

725
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:34,830
exemption I would recommend start

726
00:27:32,460 --> 00:27:36,750
keeping sales records now of the food

727
00:27:34,830 --> 00:27:39,210
and produce that you're selling and who

728
00:27:36,750 --> 00:27:40,650
it's getting sold to because MDA the

729
00:27:39,210 --> 00:27:42,240
Maryland Department of Ag is gonna want

730
00:27:40,650 --> 00:27:46,650
to take a look at those records next

731
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:48,510
year so what is MDA and Carol and I

732
00:27:46,650 --> 00:27:49,860
currently doing to help everybody get

733
00:27:48,510 --> 00:27:52,830
ready for the produce safety rule

734
00:27:49,860 --> 00:27:54,540
we're holding PSR trainings so the

735
00:27:52,830 --> 00:27:56,640
produce safety rule trainings these are

736
00:27:54,540 --> 00:28:00,330
a federal requirement that were every

737
00:27:56,640 --> 00:28:02,130
food safety officer in a farm goes to

738
00:28:00,330 --> 00:28:04,320
one of these trainings we have one

739
00:28:02,130 --> 00:28:07,440
coming up in McHenry Maryland which is

740
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,050
all the way west so that will be the end

741
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:12,540
of these trainings for this year but let

742
00:28:10,050 --> 00:28:15,150
us know if you would like one over here

743
00:28:12,540 --> 00:28:17,600
in the late fall we could start doing

744
00:28:15,150 --> 00:28:19,890
that for you or when else would be

745
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:23,220
efficient and effective for you guys to

746
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:24,840
get a training we are conducting on-farm

747
00:28:23,220 --> 00:28:26,490
readiness reviews so an on-farm

748
00:28:24,840 --> 00:28:29,400
readiness review is a confidential

749
00:28:26,490 --> 00:28:30,810
program that Maryland Department of Ag

750
00:28:29,400 --> 00:28:32,880
and the University of Maryland is doing

751
00:28:30,810 --> 00:28:35,250
where we come out to your farm and we

752
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:36,840
take a look at your practices and we can

753
00:28:35,250 --> 00:28:38,400
let you know where you're already

754
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:40,590
aligning and things you need to

755
00:28:38,400 --> 00:28:42,300
prioritize to align better with the

756
00:28:40,590 --> 00:28:43,830
produce safety rule it's completely

757
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:46,170
confidential and we don't take any

758
00:28:43,830 --> 00:28:48,510
written notes off of the farm we keep

759
00:28:46,170 --> 00:28:49,710
them all with you and on the whole

760
00:28:48,510 --> 00:28:53,309
Maryland's been doing real

761
00:28:49,710 --> 00:28:55,620
well with these 86% of Maryland farms

762
00:28:53,309 --> 00:28:57,779
only needed to have minor changes but

763
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:59,340
before they were completely aligned with

764
00:28:57,779 --> 00:29:01,440
the produce safety rule and those minor

765
00:28:59,340 --> 00:29:03,990
changes are usually red tape things like

766
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:06,059
the stuff on their records and doing a

767
00:29:03,990 --> 00:29:08,730
water distribution assessment writing

768
00:29:06,059 --> 00:29:10,440
that down so again a lot of formal

769
00:29:08,730 --> 00:29:12,149
things but on the whole you guys are

770
00:29:10,440 --> 00:29:13,890
doing really well and we really commend

771
00:29:12,149 --> 00:29:17,549
you for keeping food safety in the

772
00:29:13,890 --> 00:29:20,730
forefront of your goals as I mentioned

773
00:29:17,549 --> 00:29:25,230
before MDA is inspecting the largest

774
00:29:20,730 --> 00:29:26,730
farms this year they are only none of

775
00:29:25,230 --> 00:29:28,679
these inspections are unannounced

776
00:29:26,730 --> 00:29:31,140
they're always gonna call you up unless

777
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:34,860
you are not returning their calls then

778
00:29:31,140 --> 00:29:36,210
they might show up but they have not the

779
00:29:34,860 --> 00:29:38,460
only thing that they're citing to the

780
00:29:36,210 --> 00:29:39,929
FDA are any egregious conditions that

781
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:41,700
they find on the farm and they have not

782
00:29:39,929 --> 00:29:44,640
found any egregious conditions in the

783
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:46,590
state of Maryland which is great they

784
00:29:44,640 --> 00:29:49,830
are providing you a summary report

785
00:29:46,590 --> 00:29:51,419
that's a non-federal document and that's

786
00:29:49,830 --> 00:29:53,490
just a report of things that you can

787
00:29:51,419 --> 00:29:55,200
work on this next year and that's just

788
00:29:53,490 --> 00:29:58,980
for people who are getting inspected

789
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,690
what's been happening so I was able to

790
00:29:58,980 --> 00:30:03,029
get this information from one of the

791
00:30:00,690 --> 00:30:05,570
inspectors Alec lenka from the MDA and

792
00:30:03,029 --> 00:30:09,210
he let us know the different things that

793
00:30:05,570 --> 00:30:11,850
need some work in general in Maryland

794
00:30:09,210 --> 00:30:13,799
for this next year so common

795
00:30:11,850 --> 00:30:16,110
observations that he saw when he was out

796
00:30:13,799 --> 00:30:20,370
doing produce safety rule inspections is

797
00:30:16,110 --> 00:30:22,529
that just to keep in mind we really want

798
00:30:20,370 --> 00:30:24,000
you to be aware of all your tools and

799
00:30:22,529 --> 00:30:26,730
equipment that our food contact surfaces

800
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:28,169
and we want you to devise cleaning and

801
00:30:26,730 --> 00:30:29,970
sanding tips cleaning and sanitizing

802
00:30:28,169 --> 00:30:31,890
schedules for those tools and equipment

803
00:30:29,970 --> 00:30:34,649
and it doesn't have to be after every

804
00:30:31,890 --> 00:30:36,840
use this is at this is a schedule based

805
00:30:34,649 --> 00:30:39,270
on what the frequency you determine is

806
00:30:36,840 --> 00:30:41,010
so it can be every month it can be once

807
00:30:39,270 --> 00:30:43,799
a season it's based on what works for

808
00:30:41,010 --> 00:30:45,210
your farm different cleaning procedures

809
00:30:43,799 --> 00:30:47,130
we're still feeling seeing a lot of

810
00:30:45,210 --> 00:30:49,919
people just spray sanitizer on a dirty

811
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:52,140
belt and just say that that's what their

812
00:30:49,919 --> 00:30:53,789
cleaning procedure is and we really want

813
00:30:52,140 --> 00:30:55,440
you to follow a four-step process of

814
00:30:53,789 --> 00:30:57,510
cleaning with a detergent and then

815
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,100
sanitizing and then completely drying

816
00:30:57,510 --> 00:31:01,520
the piece of equipment drying is

817
00:30:59,100 --> 00:31:03,330
essential we are finding in the research

818
00:31:01,520 --> 00:31:05,490
because of microbes we're never

819
00:31:03,330 --> 00:31:07,410
there is water present microbes really

820
00:31:05,490 --> 00:31:09,690
like to get into that niche and grow so

821
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:13,500
drying whenever possible your equipment

822
00:31:09,690 --> 00:31:15,360
is really important soil amendment

823
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:17,940
applications so if you're applying

824
00:31:15,360 --> 00:31:22,260
manure to a sweet corn field and you

825
00:31:17,940 --> 00:31:24,390
have melons within like 15 feet of that

826
00:31:22,260 --> 00:31:26,370
sweet corn field just be aware of the

827
00:31:24,390 --> 00:31:28,410
different risks associated with that

828
00:31:26,370 --> 00:31:30,480
sweet corn field if there if there is

829
00:31:28,410 --> 00:31:32,280
any way that runoff could happen and how

830
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:34,770
you're gonna mitigate potential risk of

831
00:31:32,280 --> 00:31:36,780
any runoff as I mentioned before visitor

832
00:31:34,770 --> 00:31:38,850
policies and that sign that I have can

833
00:31:36,780 --> 00:31:41,850
show you up on this visitor policies

834
00:31:38,850 --> 00:31:43,770
thing making sure that we have a plan in

835
00:31:41,850 --> 00:31:46,920
place for when wildlife comes on our

836
00:31:43,770 --> 00:31:48,600
farm and having workers trained for

837
00:31:46,920 --> 00:31:50,310
knowing how to deal with animals on the

838
00:31:48,600 --> 00:31:52,740
farm as I mentioned before Maryland

839
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:54,660
Department of Ag on their website has a

840
00:31:52,740 --> 00:31:56,760
training that's an English and Spanish

841
00:31:54,660 --> 00:31:58,590
for working with animals so I highly

842
00:31:56,760 --> 00:32:02,100
suggest getting to that website and

843
00:31:58,590 --> 00:32:04,080
showing your workers this from the h gap

844
00:32:02,100 --> 00:32:06,000
if you're if you're a grower who wants

845
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,410
to get one of the stringent audits for

846
00:32:06,000 --> 00:32:09,450
the h gap there are a couple of other

847
00:32:07,410 --> 00:32:11,820
things that Alec was noting in his

848
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:13,380
inspections this year again a lot of

849
00:32:11,820 --> 00:32:15,810
these some of these are piddly things

850
00:32:13,380 --> 00:32:18,360
some of these are red tape things like

851
00:32:15,810 --> 00:32:21,900
securing chemical storage makes sure as

852
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:23,940
was said in the last talk whatever sort

853
00:32:21,900 --> 00:32:26,010
of sanitizer or pesticide or whatever

854
00:32:23,940 --> 00:32:29,190
you're using follow the label

855
00:32:26,010 --> 00:32:31,560
instructions that is the most important

856
00:32:29,190 --> 00:32:33,090
thing and then you could take a picture

857
00:32:31,560 --> 00:32:34,980
of this I think for time I won't be able

858
00:32:33,090 --> 00:32:37,170
to go through it all the way but there

859
00:32:34,980 --> 00:32:41,040
are some things that you can prioritize

860
00:32:37,170 --> 00:32:43,650
that will cover a PSR requirement and a

861
00:32:41,040 --> 00:32:45,630
harmonized gap requirement and that is

862
00:32:43,650 --> 00:32:47,580
making sure the records have all the

863
00:32:45,630 --> 00:32:50,330
required things on them protecting your

864
00:32:47,580 --> 00:32:52,500
water source from source to spigot

865
00:32:50,330 --> 00:32:54,770
keeping your harvest totes off the

866
00:32:52,500 --> 00:32:58,620
ground and I know this is a hard one and

867
00:32:54,770 --> 00:33:02,190
research is still diving into the actual

868
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:04,230
risk of harvest totes in contact with

869
00:33:02,190 --> 00:33:06,330
soil but if you have the ability to use

870
00:33:04,230 --> 00:33:08,550
a sacrificial tote when you're

871
00:33:06,330 --> 00:33:10,170
harvesting or if you could put a piece

872
00:33:08,550 --> 00:33:12,150
of cardboard underneath the tote that

873
00:33:10,170 --> 00:33:13,030
you're using to slide around the ground

874
00:33:12,150 --> 00:33:15,160
we really recommend

875
00:33:13,030 --> 00:33:16,810
doing that if you can if you're

876
00:33:15,160 --> 00:33:18,730
employing any sanitizers for water

877
00:33:16,810 --> 00:33:20,350
treatment activities make sure that

878
00:33:18,730 --> 00:33:22,990
you're able to monitor monitor the

879
00:33:20,350 --> 00:33:25,120
sanitizer with a pH or ppm strip you can

880
00:33:22,990 --> 00:33:26,890
get these pH or ppm strips from brewery

881
00:33:25,120 --> 00:33:29,170
supply stores or restaurants supply

882
00:33:26,890 --> 00:33:31,660
stores I have got one from Amazon and it

883
00:33:29,170 --> 00:33:34,690
did not work so I would caution against

884
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:36,760
using the Amazon once and then if you

885
00:33:34,690 --> 00:33:39,010
are using a cooler just be aware of

886
00:33:36,760 --> 00:33:42,430
what's going on with cooler condensate

887
00:33:39,010 --> 00:33:43,990
we want best-case scenario is for the

888
00:33:42,430 --> 00:33:45,340
product any product that you have don't

889
00:33:43,990 --> 00:33:46,990
store it directly underneath the cooler

890
00:33:45,340 --> 00:33:48,400
but if you are storing it directly

891
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:49,810
underneath the cooler I would recommend

892
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:50,920
that you cover it with a plastic sheet

893
00:33:49,810 --> 00:33:53,970
or something so we don't have any

894
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:56,920
condensate hitting the product

895
00:33:53,970 --> 00:33:58,420
alright so things to think about now we

896
00:33:56,920 --> 00:33:59,500
just want to make sure that everybody

897
00:33:58,420 --> 00:34:00,760
realized that food safety is an

898
00:33:59,500 --> 00:34:02,920
iterative and continue to process

899
00:34:00,760 --> 00:34:05,110
continuous you're not going to get all

900
00:34:02,920 --> 00:34:07,450
your food safety goals done in one

901
00:34:05,110 --> 00:34:09,400
season if you are thinking of where to

902
00:34:07,450 --> 00:34:11,050
start we always recommend starting with

903
00:34:09,400 --> 00:34:13,150
worker training program because they

904
00:34:11,050 --> 00:34:14,560
affect your product quality and safety

905
00:34:13,150 --> 00:34:19,480
the most because they're touching it all

906
00:34:14,560 --> 00:34:21,100
the time and if you are interested in

907
00:34:19,480 --> 00:34:22,690
going to a gap training this year we

908
00:34:21,100 --> 00:34:25,750
have a couple of advanced trainings

909
00:34:22,690 --> 00:34:27,640
happening March 28th nope February 28th

910
00:34:25,750 --> 00:34:29,230
and March 4th and these advanced

911
00:34:27,640 --> 00:34:31,570
trainings we're gonna get more in-depth

912
00:34:29,230 --> 00:34:33,580
into how to look at your piece of

913
00:34:31,570 --> 00:34:34,659
equipment for food safety risks how to

914
00:34:33,580 --> 00:34:36,909
develop cleaning and sanitizing

915
00:34:34,659 --> 00:34:39,550
schedules and if you're doing any sort

916
00:34:36,909 --> 00:34:44,200
of on photo on farm produce processing

917
00:34:39,550 --> 00:34:46,090
how to how to know if you're edging into

918
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,880
a different type of Food Safety

919
00:34:46,090 --> 00:34:51,730
Modernization Act rule if you want more

920
00:34:48,880 --> 00:34:54,370
information on how to write your plan we

921
00:34:51,730 --> 00:34:55,960
are hosting two basic gap probe

922
00:34:54,370 --> 00:34:58,210
workshops where we're going to be

923
00:34:55,960 --> 00:34:59,440
actually writing plans so if you think

924
00:34:58,210 --> 00:35:01,570
you're ready to do this but you just

925
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:02,800
don't know how to write the thing we've

926
00:35:01,570 --> 00:35:06,760
come to one of these programs you'll

927
00:35:02,800 --> 00:35:08,230
leave with a plan almost done go ahead

928
00:35:06,760 --> 00:35:10,060
and take a picture of this these are

929
00:35:08,230 --> 00:35:12,340
references for further reading all of

930
00:35:10,060 --> 00:35:14,770
the Maryland registration forms that I

931
00:35:12,340 --> 00:35:16,420
talked about are available here and you

932
00:35:14,770 --> 00:35:18,010
can talk to Carol or myself to kind of

933
00:35:16,420 --> 00:35:19,780
navigate you through which form you need

934
00:35:18,010 --> 00:35:22,420
to fill out if you need to fill out one

935
00:35:19,780 --> 00:35:25,900
and there are also resources from the

936
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:26,859
produce safety rule as well oh yeah go

937
00:35:25,900 --> 00:35:29,920
ahead did you get it

938
00:35:26,859 --> 00:35:32,680
okay good and then if you have any

939
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:40,839
questions please reach out to us and

940
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:42,009
I'll take any questions you have great

941
00:35:40,839 --> 00:35:44,200
question so they're still trying to

942
00:35:42,009 --> 00:35:47,049
figure out how often they're gonna have

943
00:35:44,200 --> 00:35:49,390
to come out to give you a an inspection

944
00:35:47,049 --> 00:35:52,119
some smaller states are able to come out

945
00:35:49,390 --> 00:35:54,249
to their farms once a year it's quite

946
00:35:52,119 --> 00:35:55,539
it's gonna be unlikely that MDA is going

947
00:35:54,249 --> 00:35:57,579
to be able to come out to you every year

948
00:35:55,539 --> 00:35:58,660
I think they're thinking maybe I don't

949
00:35:57,579 --> 00:36:00,400
want to give you a number but maybe

950
00:35:58,660 --> 00:36:02,559
every three years and it's gonna be

951
00:36:00,400 --> 00:36:48,400
based on priority they're thinking too

952
00:36:02,559 --> 00:36:49,900
so it won't be an annual thing that's a

953
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:51,609
great question so we hear this a lot the

954
00:36:49,900 --> 00:36:53,529
wildlife is a real challenge especially

955
00:36:51,609 --> 00:36:55,599
on the Eastern Shore especially with all

956
00:36:53,529 --> 00:36:57,279
the deer we have and I think that all

957
00:36:55,599 --> 00:36:59,289
the regulator's and the auditors know

958
00:36:57,279 --> 00:37:01,660
that we're not going to be able to keep

959
00:36:59,289 --> 00:37:04,989
all of the animals outside of an outside

960
00:37:01,660 --> 00:37:06,940
space right so this one is mostly a due

961
00:37:04,989 --> 00:37:08,319
diligence thing on you it's it's you're

962
00:37:06,940 --> 00:37:10,029
writing down that you're trying to

963
00:37:08,319 --> 00:37:12,910
monitor for them and you're trying your

964
00:37:10,029 --> 00:37:16,089
best to deter them from your production

965
00:37:12,910 --> 00:37:18,549
areas but we know that wildlife are an

966
00:37:16,089 --> 00:37:22,539
integral and also beneficial part of a

967
00:37:18,549 --> 00:37:25,329
farm so we're not trying to give you a

968
00:37:22,539 --> 00:37:27,039
prescription to get rid of all the deer

969
00:37:25,329 --> 00:37:28,239
right and we know that it's a challenge

970
00:37:27,039 --> 00:37:30,430
and that's kind of one of those things

971
00:37:28,239 --> 00:37:32,049
where you do your best and you write

972
00:37:30,430 --> 00:37:34,559
down what you're doing and that's all

973
00:37:32,049 --> 00:37:34,559
you can do

974
00:37:37,700 --> 00:37:45,170
two three four clapping that's exactly

975
00:37:43,819 --> 00:37:48,130
right yeah and I just think yeah

976
00:37:45,170 --> 00:37:50,720
wildlife will always be a challenge and

977
00:37:48,130 --> 00:37:52,579
it's a good thing that the MDA auditors

978
00:37:50,720 --> 00:37:56,240
and inspectors they know that so they're

979
00:37:52,579 --> 00:37:57,950
not they're not as persnickety as

980
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:26,809
someone else in Rhode Island would be

981
00:37:57,950 --> 00:38:41,930
unfortunately fortunately if you went to

982
00:38:26,809 --> 00:38:43,400
choose one yeah that's a great question

983
00:38:41,930 --> 00:38:46,099
so the question was which animals should

984
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:48,319
we mitigate for most right should it be

985
00:38:46,099 --> 00:38:50,450
the deer should it be the geese and I

986
00:38:48,319 --> 00:38:52,339
think you can think about this two ways

987
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:54,980
you can think about it as what sort of

988
00:38:52,339 --> 00:38:56,630
animals you most likely see and how many

989
00:38:54,980 --> 00:38:59,390
of that sort of animal do you most

990
00:38:56,630 --> 00:39:00,859
likely see so if you notice from your

991
00:38:59,390 --> 00:39:01,970
monitoring because you're just looking

992
00:39:00,859 --> 00:39:03,319
at your you're looking at your

993
00:39:01,970 --> 00:39:05,390
production area all the time you notice

994
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:06,500
that deer is the biggest problem then

995
00:39:05,390 --> 00:39:08,480
you're going to want to try your best to

996
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:10,790
control for deer if you know that you've

997
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:12,950
got a flock of geese and a flock of deer

998
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:14,869
it's kind of down to like well who's the

999
00:39:12,950 --> 00:39:17,299
bigger problem who goes into the field

1000
00:39:14,869 --> 00:39:20,839
more often then I would prioritize that

1001
00:39:17,299 --> 00:39:22,430
way it's just doing your best they're

1002
00:39:20,839 --> 00:39:24,290
animals they're out there we're not

1003
00:39:22,430 --> 00:39:26,890
going to keep them from our delicious

1004
00:39:24,290 --> 00:39:26,890
food you know

1005
00:39:28,350 --> 00:40:05,220
are we are we seeing any feral pigs nope

1006
00:39:34,220 --> 00:40:07,140
okay well let's hope not you're gonna

1007
00:40:05,220 --> 00:40:09,120
want to have to do something you know

1008
00:40:07,140 --> 00:40:11,790
you can do something you could bury it

1009
00:40:09,120 --> 00:40:15,570
you could just flag it you could remove

1010
00:40:11,790 --> 00:40:18,810
it the the buffer is up to you you it

1011
00:40:15,570 --> 00:40:24,990
doesn't have to be three feet it doesn't

1012
00:40:18,810 --> 00:40:26,670
what you can say that but then what

1013
00:40:24,990 --> 00:40:30,210
you're gonna want to do is follow up

1014
00:40:26,670 --> 00:40:32,550
that your workers know not to pick it in

1015
00:40:30,210 --> 00:40:34,410
subsequent picks like if they go into

1016
00:40:32,550 --> 00:40:35,610
the field again so you can write down

1017
00:40:34,410 --> 00:40:37,110
and that's where the kinds of

1018
00:40:35,610 --> 00:40:38,880
flexibility comes into play you can

1019
00:40:37,110 --> 00:40:40,860
write down whatever works for your farms

1020
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:42,870
just as long as you can like back it up

1021
00:40:40,860 --> 00:40:44,760
with worker trainings right and in that

1022
00:40:42,870 --> 00:40:46,470
instance someone will ask a worker be

1023
00:40:44,760 --> 00:40:48,270
like how do you know if you're coming

1024
00:40:46,470 --> 00:40:49,590
into this field a second time what to

1025
00:40:48,270 --> 00:40:51,240
pick and what not to pick right and if

1026
00:40:49,590 --> 00:40:53,610
they know and if they can tell the

1027
00:40:51,240 --> 00:41:00,800
inspector like oh I know then you're

1028
00:40:53,610 --> 00:41:00,800
golden makes sense okay thank you

1029
00:41:04,920 --> 00:41:25,959
