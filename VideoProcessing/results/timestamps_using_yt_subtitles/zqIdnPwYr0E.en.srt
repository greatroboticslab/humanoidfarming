00:00:22,039 --> 00:00:28,400
Agricult St. Lucia. Welcome to the

6
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:31,880
program Agriculture on the Move. My name

7
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:35,600
Philip Sydney your host. Today we

8
00:00:31,880 --> 00:00:36,440
discussing rodents in or rodent control

9
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:39,680
in

10
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,399
agriculture simply means rats affecting

11
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:45,280
our crops simply as it is. But to my

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,520
right is Mr. Christopher Luben who is

13
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:52,079
the owner and managing director of FDL

14
00:00:49,520 --> 00:00:54,239
um pest control solutions. And of course

15
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,399
next to him is Mr. Alexander was the

16
00:00:54,239 --> 00:00:58,800
crop protection officer attached to the

17
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:00,480
Ministry of Agriculture. Gentlemen,

18
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,840
welcome to the program. Thank you. Thank

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,720
you. Chris Bayer, of course, you know,

20
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:09,040
you're not new to this this this um area

21
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,479
here. Um but let us St. Lucian Lu who is

22
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,320
Chris Lubin? Give us a little

23
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,200
background. Okay. I am Christopher

24
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,560
Lubin, an aronomist by profession. I

25
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:20,400
started working in the agricultural

26
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,680
sector at Windban in 1985 where I worked

27
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,040
with the plant pathologist and

28
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,840
subsequently with both the plant

29
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:28,759
pathologist and nematologist. My work

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:32,159
involve working in with pesticides,

31
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:35,040
neatocides, fungicides in controlling

32
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:38,159
cigar disease and also nematodes

33
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:41,520
um and other pests in bananas. And I was

34
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:44,000
lucky to whilst working at Windland for

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,680
10 years go off to do my first degree at

36
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,159
the University of the West Indies where

37
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:49,840
I studied aronomy of course and because

38
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,880
of my performance I got an opportunity

39
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:55,119
to start an

40
00:01:51,880 --> 00:01:57,200
MIL/PhD with a European funded um

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:00,799
project. However, I lost all my research

42
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:03,040
to tropical storm Debbie right and the

43
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,040
funds went run out. So I basically moved

44
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:07,680
on where I worked with ran pollen which

45
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,959
is now beer crop science where I worked

46
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:13,160
as a an individual who developed

47
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:16,080
pesticides between Latin America and the

48
00:02:13,160 --> 00:02:18,080
Caribbean farm with that company and

49
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:20,080
subsequently Renick Incorporated which

50
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:22,080
is a company that was based in Puerto

51
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:24,959
Rico where I worked as a product

52
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:27,360
development and marketing manager and

53
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,120
after that I came like back to St. Mucha

54
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,560
and I formed FDL pest control solutions

55
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,319
because I worked with companies across

56
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
the Caribbean, Latin America in pest

57
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,640
management. Working out of Puerto Rico,

58
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,879
I worked both with agriculture, public

59
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:42,160
health, urban pest management and had

60
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:44,640
done a fair amount of work. So I went

61
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,680
off to study pest management both US and

62
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,680
Europe and I I've kept up in in touch

63
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,560
with that and I've done a fair amount of

64
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:55,400
work with dicide companies and other

65
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,599
pest management of um manufacturers of

66
00:02:55,400 --> 00:02:59,440
pesticides based on my research

67
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,280
background to develop them in the

68
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:03,239
region. Okay.

69
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,680
Well, a wealth of

70
00:03:03,239 --> 00:03:09,120
knowledge. Of course, Clus, I mean,

71
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,480
everybody knows Clus has been with us in

72
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,319
the ministry for a while. Of course,

73
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:16,519
right now, I think it's Dr. Alexander

74
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:20,159
now. PhD.

75
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:23,120
Um, rodents have been around for many,

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:27,200
many, many moons. Um, we know the effect

77
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:30,080
it has on, um, crops as far as farmers

78
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:33,120
are concerned. uh it from an economic

79
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,080
standpoint it has set them back a lot.

80
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,799
um we have tried rod dentisticides over

81
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:41,840
the years and um with the rest are still

82
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:44,239
around you know so tell us what's what's

83
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:46,239
happening now I'm I'm hearing new things

84
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,000
are happening in your collaboration with

85
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,120
with Chris so give us a little

86
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:54,000
background as you said rodents they they

87
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:57,360
have been in for a while but in in terms

88
00:03:54,000 --> 00:04:01,200
of agricultural production they cause

89
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:03,599
between estimated that between 2 to 10%

90
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,879
of some crops

91
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,360
is lost due to

92
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:13,280
rodents. Again, they are major vectors

93
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:15,639
for some zunotic diseases. Mhm. Rudent,

94
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:19,040
they can affect the

95
00:04:15,639 --> 00:04:22,479
crop before harvesting and they can

96
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:25,360
affect the crop after harvesting.

97
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,520
They can at planting they can go and

98
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:31,199
they can eat the seeds that that you you

99
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:33,960
you planted and they can cause a lot of

100
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:37,680
problems in terms of the the post-h

101
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:39,840
harvest. Um it has been an issue in

102
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,400
terms of the the agriculture production

103
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,400
in India.

104
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,880
Basically the farmers have depended a

105
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,199
lot on

106
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:51,639
neaticides

107
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:54,800
but yes you have had some level of

108
00:04:51,639 --> 00:04:56,680
control but you need some thing that is

109
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:59,520
more

110
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:02,320
sustainable on a yearly basis thousands

111
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,240
of dollars of neatides are imported into

112
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,840
the

113
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:09,039
country and based on that are you seeing

114
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:11,680
that if you have to um do some research

115
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:14,840
in terms of the amount that is imported

116
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:18,320
and control of the pest. Is it warrant

117
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,400
further investment in the maticide? Is

118
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,600
there a dire need for transition to

119
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,440
something that is more environmentally

120
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,720
friendly? Because again, you will use

121
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:31,120
the rodenticide and it can basically

122
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,120
contaminate the crop as well. Mhm. Also,

123
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,960
you you'll kill the some of the rats out

124
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,199
in the field and they can again that can

125
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,360
be an issue for for in terms of the

126
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:42,400
safety of the of the crop. So hence the

127
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,919
reason for us now doing some trial in

128
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:46,320
terms of something that is more

129
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,639
environmentally friendly something some

130
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,720
fertility control for rodents basically

131
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:53,360
something like a contraceptive in human

132
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,160
being where you try and control the the

133
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:58,320
the fertility of the of the of the male

134
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,759
and the female so that you can have an

135
00:05:58,320 --> 00:06:03,520
impact in terms of the of the population

136
00:06:00,759 --> 00:06:05,840
but there are limitations in terms of

137
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,960
the um the the use of the fertility

138
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:11,639
products. It has to be sustained because

139
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,960
once you stop it means the the

140
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:16,720
the get back fertile again. So multiply

141
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,120
faster. Mr. Lubin and I we collaborated

142
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,039
on some research in the Roso area. So I

143
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:23,199
think he is quite vers in the area and

144
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:27,840
he's going to expound more on what we

145
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,919
did that day during this trial. Mhm.

146
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,840
Well going back to Rosa was nostalgic.

147
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,680
That's why I started off as you're home.

148
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:38,240
You're home. Yes. Um but I worked with

149
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,680
uh with two um rodenticide producing

150
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,319
companies. One with the fertility

151
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,160
product and one with an anticoagulant.

152
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:46,720
But I want to start by saying we should

153
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:49,360
try to change from speaking about rodent

154
00:06:46,720 --> 00:06:52,319
control to rodent pest management. Yes.

155
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,240
Management because if we think like that

156
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:57,039
it we need to understand the biology of

157
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:58,800
the rat and its food preferences and

158
00:06:57,039 --> 00:07:03,280
also the way the pesticide or the

159
00:06:58,800 --> 00:07:05,280
rodenticide works. So we looked at the

160
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:08,000
the birth control product. We looked at

161
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,800
an acute poison and we also looked at

162
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,560
two what we call anticoagulant um

163
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,280
rodenticide. And if I can just go into

164
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,120
that a little bit. Yes, definitely.

165
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,240
Rodents scent taste is very important to

166
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,280
rats. Rats are omnivores like us. All

167
00:07:20,240 --> 00:07:24,720
right. And there's um silanthropic which

168
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:26,800
means that they benefit like

169
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,800
cockroaches, ants and other insects.

170
00:07:26,800 --> 00:07:33,199
they benefit from man in the sense that

171
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,880
what we eat they eat and what we do they

172
00:07:33,199 --> 00:07:37,840
know they they take advantage of it. So

173
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:39,440
the two most important factors would be

174
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,759
in the case of a farmer I'd say the most

175
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,919
important factor is sanitation because

176
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,960
when you go on farms there's some

177
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:48,560
indiscriminate use of food. That's one

178
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:50,639
but also that what they're growing is

179
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,560
food. Yes. And if a rat is raised in

180
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,160
that area eating a particular kind of

181
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,960
food from its mother's womb it's very

182
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:02,199
conscious of what to eat. And rats now

183
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:05,360
smell each other's mouth. Okay.

184
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:07,360
Um um carbon dulfide is a is a smell

185
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,199
that comes out of rats out of rat's

186
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,960
mouth or rodent's mouth and that's very

187
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,879
important to the young. Yes. Okay. They

188
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,039
smell. Yes. They smell and they they're

189
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:18,800
very good at using that to eat because

190
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:21,280
although they're omnivores they're risk

191
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
outside there. So rats if they eat the

192
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,440
wrong thing they'll die. So they've

193
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:27,360
learned to use cues. And um there are

194
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,879
three things that we can look at. One I

195
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,440
mentioned it's that they look at the

196
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:35,120
others. Another one is picker. They if

197
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:37,120
they're if they eat food and um they're

198
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:39,599
not too sure. Pika is practiced by some

199
00:08:37,120 --> 00:08:42,080
mammals. They eat dirt and the clean it

200
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:44,880
would help it stick and get get out. But

201
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,399
then because rats cannot vomit, okay?

202
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,959
They can't vomit. They have a very

203
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:51,519
strong the the valve between the stomach

204
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,279
and the esophagus is is strong. So

205
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,839
unlike us who use our diaphragm

206
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:58,080
individually, the two muscles and we can

207
00:08:55,839 --> 00:09:00,560
force this open, rats can't do that. So

208
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:02,720
because of that, they would have to

209
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,720
find a way to survive and making sure

210
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:08,360
they understand food based on taste,

211
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,360
smell is very important and also

212
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:12,880
urine. Rats pee a lot on different

213
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,120
things. So in the case of female,

214
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,880
estrogen, progesterone is important. The

215
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:19,360
female rat which is who's about to go

216
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:22,000
into heat would pee everywhere for the

217
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,839
the stronger male to come, right? So

218
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,440
they do it. Some in some cases the

219
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,360
younger rats that not even there yet

220
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,800
would pee on the stronger meal. So

221
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
therefore they remember who to go by who

222
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,800
to go by you know so it's it's signs

223
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:35,279
that have already been said it right. So

224
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:38,160
when we looked at the area, farmers were

225
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:40,880
complaining about sweet potatoes, corn,

226
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:42,240
melons, pumpkin as well and pumpkin. So

227
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,959
the intention was to look at

228
00:09:42,240 --> 00:09:47,760
palletability.

229
00:09:43,959 --> 00:09:49,360
How would the rats react to this? So if

230
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,360
I go back based on our age in this room

231
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:54,160
here, if we go back, farmers before use

232
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:55,600
a product called phospho in cocoa. And

233
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,640
what they were doing was creating what's

234
00:09:55,600 --> 00:10:00,640
called bait shininess. the rat ate it,

235
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:02,240
some would die, some wouldn't die, but

236
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,839
those that didn't die would remember

237
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:06,720
what they ate and would not eat it for

238
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:08,720
at least 3 months. So that that concept

239
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,080
was very interesting to me in terms of

240
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:11,279
trying to look at the crop because the

241
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:13,600
farmers are saying, "Okay, I'm buying

242
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:15,519
how much rodenticide like it too and I'm

243
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:16,839
still seeing the thing." So what I found

244
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:19,760
out

245
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:22,079
was a lot of them use pellets and

246
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:24,160
pellets are designed for indoor use, not

247
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:25,760
outdoor use. As experts, we know how to

248
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:27,519
use it in the field, but the farmer

249
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,519
doesn't. So he was basically throwing

250
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:32,560
money away. Mhm. And then we looked at

251
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:36,079
the liquid which is not for general use.

252
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:38,519
So what we did was first put out the

253
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,399
pest the rodenticides where we we

254
00:10:38,519 --> 00:10:45,440
tainted food with liquid rodenticide. We

255
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:48,000
used the normal rodenticide but the two

256
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:50,720
of them one had more wax than the other.

257
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:53,760
And when we got two things we got uptake

258
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:55,839
with the rodenticide and we got bit

259
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:58,880
shyness with the food. We then put the

260
00:10:55,839 --> 00:11:02,079
the palatable then we put the um the

261
00:10:58,880 --> 00:11:04,959
sausage base which is the um the birth

262
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:07,040
control and we got very good uptake on

263
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:08,640
it. Now it's a long-term trial. The key

264
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:10,079
here was to see palletability. The

265
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:12,640
farmers were very pleased because they

266
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,720
saw the uptake and we were able to prove

267
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,760
that we can prevent a rat from eating

268
00:11:14,720 --> 00:11:20,920
watermelon. Okay. Like the old people

269
00:11:17,760 --> 00:11:22,800
would say they would think that you know

270
00:11:20,920 --> 00:11:24,640
watermelon you know and they wouldn't

271
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:27,839
eat it. We were able to prevent them

272
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:30,560
from eating pumpkin um pumpkin and eat

273
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,760
what we wanted them to eat and the was

274
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:38,160
great. How based on that? I mean um in

275
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:41,360
in layman's term, how can that happen?

276
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,279
That's a good point. In layman's terms,

277
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:45,600
a farmer should not just think of I'm

278
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,279
growing a crop so I can sell and make

279
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,600
money. He has to think of it and I said

280
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:52,000
pest management. Okay. So we have two

281
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:53,680
kinds of rats in St. Lucia. the roof rat

282
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:55,440
seems to be the one that's affecting

283
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,519
them the most because they would say to

284
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:59,040
me we saw them pass on the branches of

285
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,480
the you know the trees or on the fronts

286
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
of the coconut trees and we can see them

287
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:05,200
moving. So let's go backwards before

288
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:07,279
people use that metal strip on coconut

289
00:12:05,200 --> 00:12:09,279
trees. That's one that's one factor

290
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:12,079
that's very important, right? Even the

291
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:14,000
trees if they have to. Two is know which

292
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:16,160
rat and we can tell it by looking at the

293
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:17,839
the droppings of the rat and also if we

294
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:19,680
see them because the roof rat has a much

295
00:12:17,839 --> 00:12:21,120
longer tail, bigger airs. It's a

296
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,399
slender. It's a nicer looking rat

297
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:24,240
compared to the Norway rat which we see

298
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:25,839
all around the place. Right? So it's

299
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:28,720
important to know which rat is

300
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,959
affecting. So the rats in cast is these

301
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,639
are the Norway rats. In 2004, we did

302
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,480
some work there. Some work. It was very

303
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,399
interesting. They're all over. But these

304
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:39,120
are the nori rats which are bulkier,

305
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,880
stockier, heavier, and they they tend

306
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,800
both rats don't always agree, but we've

307
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:46,399
seen places where they coexist. Okay.

308
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,560
Okay. Um so the important thing here is

309
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,560
to the farmer needs to understand if I'm

310
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,480
going to grow

311
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:54,880
potatoes, I can impact the rat before I

312
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,880
start my crop. Okay? Not when the crop

313
00:12:54,880 --> 00:12:59,200
is growing because the rats are there.

314
00:12:56,880 --> 00:13:01,519
And like when farmers when they remember

315
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:03,040
I spoke about sanitation when they leave

316
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:04,320
whatever in the field there's stuff

317
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,920
there you need to clean that out but

318
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,639
also they can use it to prevent rats

319
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,800
from eating their crop. Okay. And to

320
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,320
Clintus's point the the birth control

321
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:14,399
can come in after because it's a

322
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:17,040
long-term strategy. So you can keep that

323
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:19,360
population of rodents down and you now

324
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,800
need to look at the other thing that was

325
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:24,399
interesting is we use rodent bait

326
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,240
stations and it's a monitoring device.

327
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,560
So I can always come and say okay yes

328
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:30,800
they took it because farmers generally

329
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,040
buy the rodenticide and throw them out

330
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:35,519
and the the rodenticide disappears but

331
00:13:33,040 --> 00:13:37,200
does not mean they're out. So with the

332
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:39,200
unit we have we can actually see that

333
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:42,079
they n on it and we keep on replacing.

334
00:13:39,200 --> 00:13:43,680
So rodent pest management if I put bait

335
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:46,560
and I come back and there's no bait

336
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:48,240
left. I did not put enough. Okay. I must

337
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,160
always come back and see some bait left

338
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:52,399
because if if that means the rats came

339
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,079
in they hit everything and they went

340
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,720
away. Now a farmer is always on his

341
00:13:54,079 --> 00:14:00,320
field so he can be trained okay to do

342
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:02,320
that right but I'm happy with what I saw

343
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:04,240
and a lot more work has to be done but

344
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,519
we can from what I'm seeing and with

345
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,240
some of the people that have interacted

346
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:12,320
with us um farmers can be trained

347
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,279
to understand their field and understand

348
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:18,399
what to do to reduce damage. So what

349
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:23,480
happens to a farmer next door who does

350
00:14:18,399 --> 00:14:26,279
not um carry up that control? Um will it

351
00:14:23,480 --> 00:14:29,279
affect come back and affect the the the

352
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,279
the stations where you bitted in that

353
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,040
particular farmer? Say farmer number one

354
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,959
you're working but farmer number two

355
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:38,480
doesn't do anything. what happens

356
00:14:35,959 --> 00:14:42,079
remember again what he is saying is very

357
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:44,880
important with the the the the control

358
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:47,279
whereby if there's an urgent situation

359
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,639
in humans the use of the toxic pesticide

360
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:50,240
is important because you'll knock down

361
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:52,800
the population but with the the

362
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:55,360
fertility um control now what you'll

363
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,959
have is that um yes they'll be sterile

364
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:59,120
but they're going to leave as well you

365
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:01,040
depending on natural mortality to bring

366
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,920
down the population so with with the

367
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,920
neatide it will much quicker than And

368
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:08,000
and what you have you may have is that

369
00:15:05,920 --> 00:15:10,399
um even if you control the population on

370
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,399
some of the farms that you conducting

371
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:14,240
the recession you'll have immigrants

372
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:16,240
those neighboring areas you'll have the

373
00:15:14,240 --> 00:15:18,560
farm since there's a void now they will

374
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:21,600
come into the area where trip and then

375
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:23,279
they will get the population will hence

376
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:25,600
the reason why you need um continuous

377
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,839
baiting with the the fertility so that

378
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,600
they can because not only the the

379
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:31,279
parents that you looking at fertility

380
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:34,320
for looking at all the offsprings as

381
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:36,079
well. So fertility will be continuous.

382
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:39,120
And remember I indicated that they have

383
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:40,560
a food preference, right? So if you put

384
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,160
the two things together, you're

385
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:44,160
basically saying I'm trying to get them

386
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:45,600
to not want to eat food in this farm,

387
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:47,519
but it doesn't mean that others would

388
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,519
not eat from the other farm. So there is

389
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:51,519
need for that structure in terms of the

390
00:15:49,519 --> 00:15:54,399
how it should be done. And it comes back

391
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:56,240
to research. We we in the windband days

392
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,000
a lot of research was done in bananas,

393
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,920
but a lot of work is done now, but

394
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:02,720
there's no set research in these areas.

395
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:04,560
And I think um farmers can be trained

396
00:16:02,720 --> 00:16:08,240
because the farmers we work with were

397
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:10,320
initially a bit skeptical but when they

398
00:16:08,240 --> 00:16:12,000
saw the results they were yes it's gone

399
00:16:10,320 --> 00:16:13,680
and we will actually be able to prevent

400
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:16,399
rash from eating corn prevent them from

401
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:18,720
eating and go for the watermelon yeah

402
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:20,320
and go for the the birth control and

403
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:21,839
it's a it looks like sausage so I guess

404
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:25,440
it's something that's palatable enough

405
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:27,279
for them and rats initially don't if

406
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:29,120
there's something new they don't eat it

407
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,079
up front remember I said they so they

408
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:31,920
would taste

409
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,240
And if they now realize, oh shucks, this

410
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,639
thing got me sick, they will leave

411
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:38,880
messages for others not to eat it. And

412
00:16:36,639 --> 00:16:41,120
so it's important in that case they at

413
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:44,480
all. They ate all of it. So it's

414
00:16:41,120 --> 00:16:46,079
palatable. So there is some interesting.

415
00:16:44,480 --> 00:16:49,480
So how many farmers you worked with in

416
00:16:46,079 --> 00:16:52,480
that? We worked with four farmers. One

417
00:16:49,480 --> 00:16:54,399
corn, watermelons, pumpkin. We three

418
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,839
farmers. Three farmers. Three farmers.

419
00:16:54,399 --> 00:17:00,320
Okay. But I know there is a lot of um

420
00:16:57,839 --> 00:17:04,480
rats um when it comes to cocoa

421
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,000
production. So are you all hoping to

422
00:17:04,480 --> 00:17:08,160
Well, if there are opportunities there,

423
00:17:06,000 --> 00:17:10,480
yes, because it can rodents can be

424
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,640
controlled. Okay, we just need to take

425
00:17:10,480 --> 00:17:14,799
time to understand it. So rodents, rats

426
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:17,360
don't see too well. People need to first

427
00:17:14,799 --> 00:17:19,199
understand that don't see too well. Rats

428
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:21,199
feel. So they have special hairs on

429
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:23,039
their bodies called vibr, the the

430
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:24,640
whiskers. So a rat runs the whiskers

431
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:26,319
come for you never see a rat run into a

432
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,640
wall because it's aware of it it

433
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,080
surroundings and they will mark like I

434
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:31,360
said they will mark with their urine. So

435
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:33,200
if something was moved they would mark

436
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:36,160
it to know that was it wasn't there. So

437
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:37,440
they they work with that. So if it's a

438
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,559
roof rat we first have to establish

439
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,480
whether it's a roof rat or whether it's

440
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:42,080
now a rats affecting them. Okay. And if

441
00:17:40,480 --> 00:17:44,000
it's now a rats they borrowing the wrong

442
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:45,520
roof rats are in the trees and they

443
00:17:44,000 --> 00:17:47,280
leave because they don't see too well

444
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,880
and they rub they leave those rub marks.

445
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,039
So the sebaceious glands what we'd call

446
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,200
ring around the collar they produce that

447
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,679
and they mark the areas they they go

448
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,760
through heavily. So we would see that

449
00:17:55,679 --> 00:18:00,320
and we can train people to understand

450
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,720
what's fresh and what's stale. So it's

451
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,880
important to know the habits of the rat.

452
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:07,039
Again I come back to pest management not

453
00:18:04,880 --> 00:18:08,559
pest control because if not you're doing

454
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:09,760
the same thing over and over expecting a

455
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:12,240
different result and it's not going to

456
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:15,640
happen. Okay. There's there's of course

457
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:20,480
we know about the rat urine and

458
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:23,840
leptospiryosis. Yes. Okay. Um how can

459
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,799
that be controlled in terms of um would

460
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,919
you think there'll be less

461
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:30,160
leptospirrosis using that method down

462
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,760
the road with less rats around? I would

463
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:33,280
say in the farming areas you'd have less

464
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:35,440
rodents and less chance of that

465
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:38,480
happening. Okay. Okay. So the key thing

466
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,080
is monitoring systems and a rodent bit

467
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:42,160
station makes a difference. Not throwing

468
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:44,320
the bit around because in a farm it's

469
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:46,240
out it's in the open. The rodenticide is

470
00:18:44,320 --> 00:18:48,400
not going to last forever. Right. So

471
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,480
it's important to put it in an area. If

472
00:18:48,400 --> 00:18:52,960
we find the runway of the rat, you don't

473
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,799
put stuff in the runway because they

474
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,200
know that wasn't there. So you have to

475
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:59,919
now trick them into finding it. Okay? So

476
00:18:57,200 --> 00:19:01,600
you have to look at home and food and

477
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:03,280
remember they have a preference already.

478
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:05,360
So what you put in, you just add into

479
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:07,840
the menu, right? So it's important to

480
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:10,160
understand how So you have to understand

481
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,440
the the the mo of the rat. Yes. Exactly.

482
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:16,240
You have to think that. But we seem to

483
00:19:13,440 --> 00:19:18,640
be um focusing a lot on rats but mice as

484
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,760
well. Oh yes. So it's rat and and and

485
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,400
the mice. The mice. Yeah. So for us it

486
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:26,880
is very important creating what is

487
00:19:24,400 --> 00:19:28,960
called the bit shyness because if you

488
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:31,200
have a watermelon crop you should not

489
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:32,880
wait when this the the the rats start

490
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:36,240
eating your watermelon. That's for

491
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,160
control the baiting. But what you can do

492
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,160
is if you know your watermelon will be

493
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:41,679
ready for probably in a couple of weeks.

494
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:43,840
What you can do is try and you can

495
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:47,039
purchase a watermelon put the watermelon

496
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,559
in the bit station apply the the the the

497
00:19:47,039 --> 00:19:52,240
liquid neaticide and the bit

498
00:19:49,559 --> 00:19:55,120
sh and and tell the others that I ate

499
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:56,640
this thing in the farm and then I I you

500
00:19:55,120 --> 00:19:58,400
send the population I'm going to die and

501
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:00,400
so on. So definitely that is very

502
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:02,480
important creating the bit shyness

503
00:20:00,400 --> 00:20:04,400
whereby the the the if you have pumpkin

504
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:06,080
as well with the pumpkin farmer in the

505
00:20:04,400 --> 00:20:07,880
base station we put the pumpkin under

506
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,520
liquid neatide

507
00:20:07,880 --> 00:20:14,320
rodent keep saying not neatide sorry the

508
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:16,720
rodenticide so um it's it was very

509
00:20:14,320 --> 00:20:19,039
interesting to um again the farmers they

510
00:20:16,720 --> 00:20:20,720
were very receptive to um the the

511
00:20:19,039 --> 00:20:23,360
research and we're looking to um

512
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,679
probably scale up if you can get other

513
00:20:23,360 --> 00:20:27,600
regions where um we can transfer the

514
00:20:25,679 --> 00:20:29,360
technologies to the other regions where

515
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:31,360
um crops have been cultivated that how

516
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:33,120
how long this thing has you all did this

517
00:20:31,360 --> 00:20:35,039
I did it for 3 weeks we did it for 3

518
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:37,760
weeks just to understand the

519
00:20:35,039 --> 00:20:40,559
palatability but also in do in that time

520
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:43,280
we inspected we were on the farms at

521
00:20:40,559 --> 00:20:45,600
least twice a week okay sometimes every

522
00:20:43,280 --> 00:20:47,679
other day we just wanted to make sure

523
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,400
that like I I mentioned earlier if we

524
00:20:47,679 --> 00:20:53,039
put rodent um um rodenticide in the bait

525
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:55,760
station it should not run out so we had

526
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:58,159
to go as frequently as we possibly could

527
00:20:55,760 --> 00:21:00,240
Um farmers also have to be trained. You

528
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:02,320
have your farm, your shed, the way you

529
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:04,640
eat and what you do inside is important.

530
00:21:02,320 --> 00:21:06,320
Okay. So that's the sanitation part

531
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,559
again you know. So there's a it's not

532
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:10,000
just one thing. Mhm. Okay. We can put

533
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,400
rodenticide till we get blue in the

534
00:21:10,000 --> 00:21:14,240
face. If we don't understand the why we

535
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:17,520
fail. So the food is what we want to

536
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:19,120
protect. Mhm. You create big shininess,

537
00:21:17,520 --> 00:21:21,320
you use the product, you you know you

538
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:23,919
reduce the population. And

539
00:21:21,320 --> 00:21:25,440
um it's not only in rodents you now have

540
00:21:23,919 --> 00:21:26,640
this this happening. And it happens with

541
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:29,200
birds, you know, there are there are

542
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,159
things that can be used. So it's it's a

543
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:35,039
a range of activities that should be

544
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,799
done on a farm and the farmer has to pay

545
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:39,360
attention to it because if not, he will

546
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:41,200
always have issues, right? And he can be

547
00:21:39,360 --> 00:21:43,440
trained to see the runways of the rat to

548
00:21:41,200 --> 00:21:45,360
look at where they come from and they

549
00:21:43,440 --> 00:21:47,760
know it, they see it. It's just to

550
00:21:45,360 --> 00:21:50,640
understand how to use what they have to

551
00:21:47,760 --> 00:21:54,720
to control. So Okay. So you all worked

552
00:21:50,640 --> 00:21:57,760
in Roso? Yes. Okay. So where else will

553
00:21:54,720 --> 00:22:02,240
that be replicated? Um we're looking at

554
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:06,280
um region five that's in the V4 area.

555
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:09,960
Also we we did it on um the

556
00:22:06,280 --> 00:22:13,039
watermelons, the pumpkins and the corn

557
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:15,919
farmer. Very important to us will be um

558
00:22:13,039 --> 00:22:17,919
the having a trial with a a sweet potato

559
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,159
farmer. Yes. because we know um there's

560
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:22,720
a serious issue in terms of the rat

561
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:24,400
infestation in in sweet potatoes. So

562
00:22:22,720 --> 00:22:26,559
once you can get a sweet potato farmer

563
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:28,559
who is interested, we can transfer the

564
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:32,080
technology to whatever region that um we

565
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:34,960
feel that um we can have the the trial

566
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:37,039
on. What was interesting to me is the

567
00:22:34,960 --> 00:22:38,640
potato farmer said to you there is you

568
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:41,919
know there there's still potatoes in the

569
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:44,159
field after harvest. M so it might be

570
00:22:41,919 --> 00:22:47,200
small potatoes or pieces they left in

571
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:48,880
the field and that's a source of food

572
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,400
some of them might might start to grow

573
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,720
because they then till the land because

574
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:55,039
we actually went back when that process

575
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,799
started so we didn't just come and we

576
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,600
went back to look at it so the lands

577
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:01,760
were being prepared so that's when you

578
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,159
now would disturb the potatoes right but

579
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,000
in some cases if you look at it from a

580
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:07,600
practical perspective some of them might

581
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:09,440
already be growing and now you're

582
00:23:07,600 --> 00:23:10,240
digging it up and remember rodents you

583
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:11,760
smell

584
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:13,840
So if they sense that they can be coming

585
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,600
back from that early and then you plant

586
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:17,679
your crop and they now know hey I have a

587
00:23:15,600 --> 00:23:20,400
source of food. So it's important that

588
00:23:17,679 --> 00:23:23,120
habits change some of the practices have

589
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:27,760
to be adjusted and we can have good

590
00:23:23,120 --> 00:23:31,760
success. Okay. So at what point will um

591
00:23:27,760 --> 00:23:34,240
that road denticide be available to the

592
00:23:31,760 --> 00:23:36,240
public for at for purchasers? I'm I'm

593
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:38,080
sure. Yeah. But I I this is something

594
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:40,240
that the ministry would have to to

595
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:41,919
decide. We can't, we wouldn't because

596
00:23:40,240 --> 00:23:44,400
it's something that requires proper

597
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,360
training to use. Okay. Um it's dangerous

598
00:23:44,400 --> 00:23:48,799
stuff. You know, no pesticide is safe

599
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:51,039
and you want to make sure it's used the

600
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:53,360
right way. And I say that simply because

601
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:56,400
over the years what we've learned is

602
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:58,799
farmers or people use different products

603
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:00,480
as rodenticides. Furodan, for example,

604
00:23:58,799 --> 00:24:03,039
was one of the main ones that was used

605
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:06,400
for years. and farmers mix stuff even

606
00:24:03,039 --> 00:24:08,080
down to using the cans where they they

607
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,559
cook it and then you know they they they

608
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:12,880
tint the food. So I think it's important

609
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:14,559
for people to understand the why the how

610
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:16,640
what you do and it's important to to

611
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,279
document it. That way people are aware

612
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:20,960
and the training is is taken seriously.

613
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:22,480
If not we will start something and then

614
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:24,480
if it's not done properly people will

615
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:26,159
see that as a failure. Okay. And we need

616
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:28,000
to make sure people understand what's

617
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:29,799
being done why it's being done. Okay.

618
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:31,760
So, so there there have to be that

619
00:24:29,799 --> 00:24:33,760
collaborative uh situation with the

620
00:24:31,760 --> 00:24:37,919
ministry of agriculture to ensure that

621
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:40,520
it works. So, yeah. You mentioned you

622
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:42,880
said when would the the

623
00:24:40,520 --> 00:24:45,679
neatide sorry be available on the

624
00:24:42,880 --> 00:24:47,440
market? Firstly, it has to be evaluated

625
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,440
by the pesticide and the chemical

626
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:51,440
control board because if a new product

627
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:54,240
is coming into the country, we'll need

628
00:24:51,440 --> 00:24:56,320
to do the necessary risk assessments to

629
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:59,039
mitigate some of the impacts of the of

630
00:24:56,320 --> 00:25:00,640
the product. So once this is done um the

631
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:02,159
product can be taken to the board for

632
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:05,039
registration.

633
00:25:02,159 --> 00:25:08,320
Okay. So so in so right now it's it's

634
00:25:05,039 --> 00:25:11,679
just a trial tested trials around the

635
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:14,240
island and like I said again so um you

636
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:15,919
do have any a specific time frame before

637
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:18,320
it gets gets the to the board for

638
00:25:15,919 --> 00:25:21,039
approval. Um it's difficult to put a

639
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:24,400
time frame because um if an a registrant

640
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:26,159
um submit a dossier it means well after

641
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:28,400
reviewing this particular dossier you

642
00:25:26,159 --> 00:25:31,360
may ask for further information. Mhm.

643
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,760
Where was it tested? Where was it tested

644
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:36,799
while going for the dosi may see um

645
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:40,000
something where you see some impact some

646
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:42,480
hazard on on on the um dossi. will the

647
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,279
registrant will need to prove to you

648
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:47,279
that some of the persons or where where

649
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:49,520
it was some of the risks that he's is

650
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:50,960
presented where it was mitigated some of

651
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,559
the research papers that was done on

652
00:25:50,960 --> 00:25:54,679
this particular product. So all these

653
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:56,799
the important pieces of

654
00:25:54,679 --> 00:25:58,720
information they're very important in

655
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:00,480
terms of the registration of the product

656
00:25:58,720 --> 00:26:03,279
to mitigate the risks associated with

657
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:07,440
the product. M so so you still so

658
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:10,159
there's no time frame you cannot but but

659
00:26:07,440 --> 00:26:12,480
still there is opportunity to train

660
00:26:10,159 --> 00:26:14,880
farmers until that time to understand

661
00:26:12,480 --> 00:26:16,880
what they should and shouldn't do great

662
00:26:14,880 --> 00:26:20,240
because it's it's it's not going to

663
00:26:16,880 --> 00:26:21,679
happen overnight but um my observations

664
00:26:20,240 --> 00:26:24,240
because in our industry we are

665
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:27,200
observational biologists my observations

666
00:26:24,240 --> 00:26:29,600
are people want a quick fix but you're

667
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:32,799
dealing with a pest that has been around

668
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:34,559
for a very long Mhm. And being silent

669
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:38,000
anthropic, it's adjusted its lifestyle

670
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,080
to us. So we need to readjust and it

671
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:42,880
will not happen with just a pesticide.

672
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,360
It has to happen with

673
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:46,799
an attitude change towards understanding

674
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:50,159
I have my crop. I want to make sure I

675
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:52,799
save I have maximum yield and less

676
00:26:50,159 --> 00:26:54,480
damage. What do I need to do? And years

677
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:57,840
ago we've been training with farmers

678
00:26:54,480 --> 00:27:00,720
where for example using fogging um

679
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:01,760
misting sorry for secret to control

680
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,600
things like that you have to train

681
00:27:01,760 --> 00:27:05,279
people need to understand wind direction

682
00:27:03,600 --> 00:27:07,840
in that case how to move through the

683
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,840
crop it's no different in this case it's

684
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:13,120
it's to understand how I should use a

685
00:27:09,840 --> 00:27:15,440
rodenticide and if I understand that and

686
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,880
I see the results I believe if I don't

687
00:27:15,440 --> 00:27:19,520
see the results then of course to

688
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:22,240
continue I don't yes

689
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:24,080
again what's very important for us is

690
00:27:22,240 --> 00:27:27,200
um the farmers they've been really

691
00:27:24,080 --> 00:27:29,679
reliant on pesticide use and the use of

692
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:31,760
pesticide is not the only means of

693
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,320
controlling rodents. M so um there are

694
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,840
other technologies available for

695
00:27:33,320 --> 00:27:38,640
controlling like the what we trying

696
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:42,400
presently the fertility control the use

697
00:27:38,640 --> 00:27:44,559
of carbon monoxide and probably the um

698
00:27:42,400 --> 00:27:46,880
blocking of the borrows and so there are

699
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:48,880
lots of other measures available but

700
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:51,919
specifically we feel that um the use of

701
00:27:48,880 --> 00:27:53,919
the fertility product is going to again

702
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:55,760
the product is an organic product. No,

703
00:27:53,919 --> 00:27:57,440
that's another thing right in terms of

704
00:27:55,760 --> 00:27:59,120
environmental protection and food

705
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,080
safety. It will help in that regard.

706
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:03,760
Finally, sir, me I hope it it catches

707
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:06,320
on. I love research. That's what I

708
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:09,200
always um as professionally that's where

709
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,240
I was I my profession started. And I

710
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:14,320
think um urban pest management, pest

711
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:15,760
management in agriculture, it's very

712
00:28:14,320 --> 00:28:18,159
important to understand the why and the

713
00:28:15,760 --> 00:28:20,240
how. Um we should not just be applying

714
00:28:18,159 --> 00:28:22,720
stuff for applying it sake. And I think

715
00:28:20,240 --> 00:28:25,360
it's important for all involved to to

716
00:28:22,720 --> 00:28:27,919
take it seriously before an end result.

717
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:29,440
I think for me it's um that's the food

718
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:30,640
security. Great. The Ministry of

719
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:32,880
Agriculture, we've been talking about

720
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:34,799
food security for a very long time. And

721
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:37,440
if you are able to control um the the

722
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:40,320
the rodents in watermelons, in the

723
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,240
cantaloupes, in the pumpkins, in in

724
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:44,640
sweet potato, there can be at least a

725
00:28:42,240 --> 00:28:47,840
10% increase in those crops. Definitely

726
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:49,440
which can benefit more money more.

727
00:28:47,840 --> 00:28:51,360
