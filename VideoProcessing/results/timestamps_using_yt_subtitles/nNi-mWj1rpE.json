  "text": "there are farmers who get G bumps when they hear the word tomato farming being mentioned but there are also some farmers who have made some good profit and created wealth doing tomato farming and New farmers ask themselves what do they do that others that make huge Rosses don't do where do they get it wrong is it from the variety select is it the market or what is it well in this tutorial we shall tell you everything that you need to know on successful tomato farming and especially how you can grow good tomatoes and the best timing for high prices in this tutorial we shall cover the following topics the Kenyan tomato industry the best time to plant tomatoes in Kenya the best place to grow tomatoes in Kenya the most profitable High yielding tomato varieties to grow how to plant good tomatoes the worst tomato paste and how to control them tomato diseases and how to control them cost and profit of tomatoes fing and finally the bonus tips so make sure you stick till the end if you really want to start getting good profits from your tomato Family actually at the end of this all you will realize what separates those who makes profit in tomato farming and those who make losses and remember we are dedicating this fashion to those serious Farmers those really fused farmers who need to start making a living and money and profit from tomato farming the Kenyan tomato industry Kenyan Tomatoes most of them are sold in the market though there is a small portion absorbed by the industry and therefore it is the mass Market that determines the overall prices that farmers earn now tomato prices in Kenya can be determined by WEA Supply demand and most of all the Brokers will and greed how much brokers want is what the farmer will sell simply because he cannot sell his own produce and therefore the inability of most Farmers to access Market is what has empowered Mercedes brokers who never Farm but I eat the biggest pie of the Tomato production selling tomatoes in krams especially as how Industries absorb is the most profitable way for Farmers however Brokers prefer using expective units of measure such as hip crate or Pro box two and abnormal profits the best time that you can plant tomatoes in Kenya the perfect time that you can get good prices at low cost is one that coincides with low market supply yes planting your tomatoes in such a way that you harvest them when there are Le little market supply at least at this time prices are high and even if Brokers try to expl you will still get good margins and at this time especially when there is heavy Lane most produce is destroyed by the L the roads are inaccessible therefore the supply roow and prices are high remember tomato demand is always there people will still continue consuming Tomatoes regardless of the weather where can you grow tomatoes the best place to grow tomatoes is one that has FTI well drained soil and warm weather warm weather p and fastens the Tomato growth at low cost especially when it comes to controlling fungal diseases caused by cold weather doing outdoor tomatoes in wet cold regions increases the cost of production especially in controlling diseases compared to doing it in weather in warm weather Legions the greenhouse system is ideal in both hot and cold regions as it enables faster growth of crops the most profitable High yielding tomato varieties to grow in Kenya in order to make money in tomato farming you must select the best tomato variety with faster maturity high yield and good tolerance to diseases all tomato varieties are not the same they vary in terms of yeld and resistance to diseases the best two varieties that you can plant and get good hydrates is Terminator F1 from Royal seeds and also F1 from seminis these are the best and most profitable outdoor tomatoes to grow in Kenya for Greenhouse Farmers Susanna F1 has good shape good size and therefore makes it the best tomato variety to plant inside Greenhouse it is a product of Royal seeds now let's check what makes the min typ one a good variety one it is a very vigorous plant long determinate and a heavy yielder its fruit has deep color with over shape it matures with 75 days from transplanting has a fruit weight of 125 to 150 g a yield potential of 40 tons per acre okay and those harvested fruits they can stay up to 21 days fresh at room temperature this what makes it most IDE deal for buyers they want a produce that can stay long after harvest Terminator F1 has a 21 day Safe Life AA can hold a plant population of around 8,000 plants of Terminator another cool variety that you can do is answer for from seminis it is elongated Square loud tomato hybrid it's best for open field environmental condition it brings value to Growers with overall fruit quality disease package extended shelf life and plant y after getting the best vary how do you plant it here is how you can plant good tomato in outdoor farming dig planting holds on a spacing of 60 cm by 60 cm or 60 cm by 50 cm but for Greenhouse fing you can do 50 cm by 50 cm simply because you'll do the pruning after that apply well decomposed manure 2 kg precisely per planting hole cover with loose soil and water then drench with thunder inxite to kill any cats and City shooter or optimizer for removing any transplanting stress on the crop after that you can transplant your seed drinks in large scale farming suain seed drinks is economical however for small scale Farmers Laing your own seedings is most economic and the variety is guaranteed even for large scale Farmers if you can manage to raise your own seedings it's very very economical and also the variety is guaranteed we've experienced several cases where Farmers they ordered or outsourced the drings but they were not the variety that they were promised given Farmers ress and remember you could only realize this few months down the line and it's irreversible there's nothing much you can do Ling own SE drings is guaranteed of quality and variety after you've planted your Tomatoes the next thing is feeding feeding is what determines the yield regardless of the variety if you have a good variety and you don't feed it well you'll definitely experience low needs here is the tomato fertilizer application schedule the fertilizer that you need to apply how and even the quantity to breast with dap NPK 1717 and fertilizers on the for 14th day after transplanting 45th day after transplanting and 16th days after transplanting respectively what do I mean I mean J planting you don't apply the DAP 2 weeks after your seedings have developed you can now come and apply the DAP at this time the seedings would have developed the roots and managed to absorb the fertilizer if you applied during the planting it may be easily reached away and not end up helping the crop after that 45 day equivalent to 1 and a half month after transplanting you can now apply NPK 17 17 17 it has the balance nitrogen phosphorus and potassium this will initiate fluting and flowering so you don't skip this one and go to CN no this one will initiate fruiting and flowering and give you high number of fruits and flowers after that then 2 months after transplanting you can apply now the CA and fertilizer CN has the calcium that will help in expansion of the fruit and that's why we usually recommend it to be done 60 days after transplanting you can supplement this fertilization by applying nitrogen fol fertilizers such as you can apply easily grow vegetative on the first month that is 2 weeks after transplanting and your to blasting every week you do e grow vegetative to enhance for your growth on the second month after transplanting now you apply the NPK FIA such as oo uh and also Advanced K this one has more potassium and it will help in floating and flowering on the third month you can now apply calcium Le forious fertilizers to prevent blossom endro and also these calcium Bon folas they will prevent in fruit and flow abortion after that we going to look at the wor tomato paste and how to control them imagine after selecting the best variety feing then now what kicks out all tomato fing it's p diseases we are not going to allow this and that's why we are now giving you the worst of all and the best chemicals you can use and how you can manage to apply them the number one past that has run most Farmers out of business is Du absoluta or what we call Reef Miner it's the most destructive paste in tomato farming due to its infectiveness to most chemicals caused by insect nature of damage actually it tends to hibernate between the layers of the leaves so that when you apply the chemicals they are much not effective to identify them very easily you can see some marks as if H kind of of snail passing by we often call them broad shaped mindes on the leaves L you find them on stems but you can also find them there the best control for Tut absoluta is applying the best chemicals early so you can apply belt for a male at the rate of 4 m in 20 L of water or 10 m per 20 L of water these application should be done from the third week after transplanting and you continue at Le weekly weekly weekly and when you apply you apply on the leaves below the leaves and also on the soil okay why do we apply on the soil so that we can manage to kill all the eggs ra on the soil below the leaves you need to control it and also on top control when you do this you will manage to have a total control before it reaches the last stage right like a fly remember it goes the whole metamorphosis so if you don't control it before becoming an insect it will be hard and this what has caused most Farmers low yet you find fruits they have made some holes and buas don't also want to buy them no one wants to buy a tomato with wols made of insect so the best way ensure that you you can use bed for a m per 20 L of water or Emerald 10 m per 20 L of water and apply early there is no shortcut about it the next Insight that has caused total Destruction in crops and especially Greenhouse Farmers it's white fries this one has has drained most Farmers white fries they are white stop stacking insects and by doing so they tend to promote growth of su mod kind of extracted honey they cause regular liening of tomatoes and can also transmit viral pathogens like the Tomato yellow lefal virus to identify them you just need to shake shake the plants a little bit and you'll see white flying insects along to control them apply profile at 30 m per 20 L of water or also Amon 10 ml per 20 L of water the application in it own green houses should be done on the midday if it's on the farm it should be done on the evening you apply around the farm and then you apply inside not inside then you will finish with around no spraying fast around the farm contains the them and makes them easy to be killed after controlling the paste the next thing you need to watch out is the Tomato diseases here is how you can control them early the most destructive tomato disease is bright oftenly known as Bida this one has drained a lot of farmers and kick them out out of tomato farming business tomato arite is a disease characterized by brown spot with dark conc drinks the disease spreads rapidly affecting the Lees and the stem and finally it affects the fruits to control it apply my 72 WP at the rate of 30 G per 20 L of water or gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 L of water the the best way to control them is a application once they are affected it becomes very very hard remember the cells of the plant die so and you cannot manage to revive them and therefore the best way is to prevent early when you've seen little infestation you can first apply copper Beast find St such as the green cop or Isa cop and then after that you now continue applying the normal fun sites but most of all is ensuring that you've prevented the infestation and the best application L is applying twice per week in cold Seasons or heavy season or once per week in hot Seasons the next disease that has destroyed a lot of tomatoes is tomato yellow leaf spot disease you find the leaves has black spots okay the bright and Sport disease are different for sport disease you find sports evenly distributed on the leaves but for blight you'll find along the margins as if they starting to dry it it starts by affecting other leaves with greenish yellow spots begging from the top of the leaf progressively the spots become dark with infected Broms also turning black and falling off the disease it also affect fruits for Effective control you can apply either Trinity gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 L of water or you can also apply skore yes at at the rate of 20 ml per 20 L of water these two will help in total control of Lea spot Lea spots and bright these are the worst diseases that will kick you out of tomato famine imagine all that investment and bu is where you come to or after all that investment and then you let just because of the carelessness you let your crops be destroyed by P P the tutor and also the white FES actually we don't expect any farmer listening to this tutorial to be ever again stressed by this dis we've given you toal control and after you've done this now let do the math how much are you willing or high likely to make and how much are you highly likely to incur the cost and profit of tomato farming in Kenya the cost of tomato production in Kenya is 185,000 k Shing and you can find all these M on our previous article which you can click here above this often varies with season location and management and good management Ana can produce 300 crates if a farmer Sals if a farmer sales one crit at around 1,000 shs then a y 300,000 from 300 crat in one this gives him a profit of around 115,000 however if he does sell the similar crates below 800 500 and even as it was in some months past at 300 Shing per crit the farmer definitely make losses so therefore the best means that you can manage to get good profit is selling your yield above 1,000 shs per crit at least this way you'll get some good profit remember we promised as we begin to give you the bonus tips we have the very bonus tips how you can increase yield then the second one how you can speed the Tomato growth and also the third one how you can get your tomatoes to produce more fruits now to increase yield and ESP special tomato yield ensure that you've planted with 2 kg of manure Ure that you've toess with 100 kgs of D 100 kgs of NPK 17 and 100 kgs of c and you've done sufficient irrigation don't forget also to control the past and diseases once you do that you will definitely increase your yield the next one on speeding the Tomato growth ensure that you planted in warm areas Ure that you water very well and you feed them P Tre and by feeding I mean giving them the right fertilizer at the right time not that you're giving the DAP 2 months or you're apping C at the beginning those one will not give you the good results the third one how do you get your tomatoes to produce more fruits one you can spray high potassium FIA fertilizers such as advanced K this one will enhance flowering and fruiting and don't forget to combine it with Boron Boron will prevent the formed fruit and flouring from a boin and the third thing don't forget to add calcium it will prevent the Brom andrs that's how smart Farmers would grow tomatoes and make a Kill from it I believe now you can comfortably begin your tomato farming if you have any question on tomato farming kindly let us know in the comment section we are willing to help you and we are willing to help you get those 400 or even 500 crates you get about 40 ttimes yes remember if you get high yield and at low cost regardless sometimes of the price you definitely get good margins but if you have low Ys I you get low prices you end up making losses and in tomato farming there is no shortcut there is no shortcut you cannot plant an opv variety and you expect 40 tons you cannot deny the crop CN or NPK and you expect good plant you cannot skip weakly spraying of chemicals to control T absor white fries bright yellow spots black spots you cannot escap that chemical and you expect good years it doesn't happen like that you have to be consist consistent don't forget also to like to subscribe and to share see you next in the next tutorial",
