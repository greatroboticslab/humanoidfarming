1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,110
in today's video you will learn or be

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:06,660
refreshed about the Tom point is to grow

3
00:00:04,110 --> 00:00:09,240
healthier vegetables in organic garden

4
00:00:06,660 --> 00:00:11,580
organic gardening faces more challenges

5
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:14,070
in conventional gardening methods due to

6
00:00:11,580 --> 00:00:16,619
a zero tolerance to harmful chemical use

7
00:00:14,070 --> 00:00:18,990
but it is very possible to get a higher

8
00:00:16,619 --> 00:00:21,270
yield in harvest because other gardening

9
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:23,850
methods overlook fundamental points to a

10
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:27,510
stronger crop this brings me to my first

11
00:00:23,850 --> 00:00:30,060
tip nitrogen fixation nitrogen fixation

12
00:00:27,510 --> 00:00:32,040
is a key building block to fertile soils

13
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:34,140
for your vegetables pods needs the

14
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,880
ammonia form of nitrogen for central

15
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:39,149
life components like proteins and amino

16
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:41,340
acids however they can't use a nitrogen

17
00:00:39,149 --> 00:00:44,190
which makes up 80% of the air we breathe

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:46,980
in there for planting legumes like peas

19
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:49,590
and beans will fix nitrogen in the soil

20
00:00:46,980 --> 00:00:51,660
by being stored in their nodes this

21
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:54,210
nitrogen can then be used up by other

22
00:00:51,660 --> 00:00:56,879
plants require this companion plant

23
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,920
broad beans sugar snap peas peas and

24
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,170
other legumes with other vegetables and

25
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,290
as a result they will promote plant

26
00:01:01,170 --> 00:01:06,600
growth secondly is to mulch raised beds

27
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:08,729
in the autumn with a three-inch layer of

28
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:10,740
either well watered mineral leaves or

29
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,619
leaf mold and cover with the dark

30
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:16,229
plastic make sure it is moist beforehand

31
00:01:13,619 --> 00:01:18,540
this will let earthworms and decomposers

32
00:01:16,229 --> 00:01:21,119
to work thoroughly at decomposing the

33
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:23,729
organic matter overwinter resulting in a

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:26,460
more fertile soil to grow vegetables in

35
00:01:23,729 --> 00:01:29,939
the spring and also being warmer as per

36
00:01:26,460 --> 00:01:31,850
plastic absorbs warmth ensure you poke a

37
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:34,530
few holes to allow the flow of oxygen

38
00:01:31,850 --> 00:01:36,840
otherwise decomposition will not be

39
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:39,000
possible if you like to see a detailed

40
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:41,280
video click on the annotation above and

41
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:43,829
learn the steps to success in six

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,979
minutes thirdly is growing in containers

43
00:01:43,829 --> 00:01:49,290
this is an especially important tip if

44
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:51,630
you have a small garden or even limit to

45
00:01:49,290 --> 00:01:54,570
a balcony but growing organic vegetables

46
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:57,210
can be done in almost any situation also

47
00:01:54,570 --> 00:01:59,130
people with larger gardens should strive

48
00:01:57,210 --> 00:02:02,340
to include containers to grow some of

49
00:01:59,130 --> 00:02:05,189
their produce in butwhy containers make

50
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:07,770
it easy to transport plants stop some

51
00:02:05,189 --> 00:02:09,629
becoming invasive for example mint and

52
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:12,390
it can be used to grow vegetables and

53
00:02:09,629 --> 00:02:13,680
hard surfaces for example on a patio on

54
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:16,319
a trellis which will

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:19,079
Aksum eyes yells containers don't have

56
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,540
to be plastic they can easily assemble

57
00:02:19,079 --> 00:02:23,909
together wooden plant boxes or make

58
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:26,459
hanging baskets out of dowels to grow

59
00:02:23,909 --> 00:02:29,519
cherry tomatoes the possibility is

60
00:02:26,459 --> 00:02:31,769
endless my fourth tip is to work with

61
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,469
nature by attracting beneficial insects

62
00:02:31,769 --> 00:02:37,019
such as pollinators or both which will

63
00:02:34,469 --> 00:02:39,180
help keep pests numbers down I strongly

64
00:02:37,019 --> 00:02:40,680
suggest you devote at least 10 percent

65
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,799
of your space to attracting beneficial

66
00:02:40,680 --> 00:02:45,810
insects that is not mean to simply plant

67
00:02:43,799 --> 00:02:48,060
flowers as you can still use the plants

68
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,609
you grow as food barrage is one

69
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:52,799
well-known flowering herb which both

70
00:02:50,609 --> 00:02:54,569
attracts dozens of beneficial insects

71
00:02:52,799 --> 00:02:57,239
but you can also add the leaves and

72
00:02:54,569 --> 00:02:59,430
flowers to salads a colorful way to

73
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:01,769
bring pollinators is to grow a flower

74
00:02:59,430 --> 00:03:04,049
border consisting of herbs of the likes

75
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:06,719
of marjoram mint and borage along with

76
00:03:04,049 --> 00:03:08,849
corn flowers and buckwheat this will

77
00:03:06,719 --> 00:03:11,250
create a paradise for visiting bees and

78
00:03:08,849 --> 00:03:12,959
why not create a movable paradise for

79
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:14,969
example planting in a bucket or a

80
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,329
wheelbarrow and being able to move it

81
00:03:14,969 --> 00:03:20,699
around your garden the fifth and final

82
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:22,470
tip for growing organic vegetables is to

83
00:03:20,699 --> 00:03:24,780
get ahead of the game with weeds as

84
00:03:22,470 --> 00:03:27,150
organic vegetable gardening is against

85
00:03:24,780 --> 00:03:29,069
the use of chemical weed sprays it can

86
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:31,979
only take a few weeks to get overrun by

87
00:03:29,069 --> 00:03:34,409
them weeds unfortunately will always

88
00:03:31,979 --> 00:03:36,599
outgrow vegetables originally all

89
00:03:34,409 --> 00:03:38,790
vegetables are weeds but after thousands

90
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:40,290
of years of cultivation they're weaker

91
00:03:38,790 --> 00:03:42,389
therefore weeds will win their battle

92
00:03:40,290 --> 00:03:44,519
for space but there are plenty of

93
00:03:42,389 --> 00:03:47,519
methods will which will help you get

94
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:49,530
that vital step ahead of the game my

95
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,989
personal favorite method is mulching

96
00:03:49,530 --> 00:03:54,419
using up the abundance of free resources

97
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:56,729
for example leaves cardboard and grass

98
00:03:54,419 --> 00:03:59,069
clippings we can source from our own

99
00:03:56,729 --> 00:04:02,159
backyard in the house or in your local

100
00:03:59,069 --> 00:04:03,810
park this fall collect leaves and in the

101
00:04:02,159 --> 00:04:05,849
spring you can use them to place in

102
00:04:03,810 --> 00:04:07,500
between the rows of plants stopping

103
00:04:05,849 --> 00:04:10,139
light to hit the bare patches of ground

104
00:04:07,500 --> 00:04:13,470
and also adding nutrients as they slowly

105
00:04:10,139 --> 00:04:15,509
decompose add a two to three inch layer

106
00:04:13,470 --> 00:04:17,669
and repeats when you see weeds poking

107
00:04:15,509 --> 00:04:19,680
through another great mulch is wood

108
00:04:17,669 --> 00:04:21,509
chippings which you can get for free or

109
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:23,849
for a very cheap price at a local

110
00:04:21,509 --> 00:04:26,130
sawmill black plastic is a less

111
00:04:23,849 --> 00:04:27,540
aesthetically appealing method however

112
00:04:26,130 --> 00:04:30,420
you get great results

113
00:04:27,540 --> 00:04:32,550
when we used it on our squashes and you

114
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:35,550
can see that video by finding the link

115
00:04:32,550 --> 00:04:37,500
in the description I hope you found this

116
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:39,780
video interesting and I would love to

117
00:04:37,500 --> 00:04:41,460
know what your top tips are so please

post them down below in the comment

119
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,600
