1
00:01:03,239 --> 00:01:06,799
so I've recently come out with a couple

2
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,200
videos talking about how we're getting

3
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:13,000
$44,000 a week in production on this

4
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,119
vegetable farm and in this video I want

5
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:17,000
to explain a little bit about our yields

6
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:18,159
that we're harvesting every week to get

7
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,000
to that

8
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:22,759
$44,000 I think that'll kind of clear up

9
00:01:21,000 --> 00:01:25,040
uh any confusion you get from that

10
00:01:22,759 --> 00:01:26,520
because just the number could mean a lot

11
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,320
of different things but I want to really

12
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,079
explain how much food we're really

13
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,799
producing on a half an acre of land

14
00:01:31,079 --> 00:01:35,200
which is Tiny amount of land you know

15
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:37,880
you could do a half an acre of

16
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:39,520
production in Chicago downtown in in the

17
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:42,280
city of Chicago you know that's not a

18
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:45,399
lot of land so um I'm going to go over

19
00:01:42,280 --> 00:01:47,799
that today I'm going to go over our core

20
00:01:45,399 --> 00:01:49,960
crops that are producing those kinds of

21
00:01:47,799 --> 00:01:53,680
numbers and some of the crops that

22
00:01:49,960 --> 00:01:55,439
produce less um and the point I'm making

23
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,360
with this video is not to brag or

24
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,640
anything because I think eventually that

25
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,840
number is going to be a lot bigger for

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,479
our farm but once we expand because

27
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:04,439
eventually we're going to be doing one

28
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,479
to one and a half acres of

29
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,879
production but the point I'm making here

30
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:13,360
is that you can grow a lot of food on a

31
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:16,040
small land base and make a living or

32
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:19,000
grow food for your family and I do offer

33
00:02:16,040 --> 00:02:21,239
a gardening course called gardening 101

34
00:02:19,000 --> 00:02:22,319
the link is in the description where I'm

35
00:02:21,239 --> 00:02:26,000
teaching

36
00:02:22,319 --> 00:02:29,200
you the similar techniques that I use on

37
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:32,680
this Farm to use in your backyard and

38
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:36,200
grow a truckload of food for your family

39
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:37,640
on a couple hundred square feet of land

40
00:02:36,200 --> 00:02:39,959
you know you don't need a lot of land to

41
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:43,920
do this kind of production

42
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:46,720
so on every bed that you see behind me

43
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:50,680
we're trying to get two crops a year in

44
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:52,159
the field some of the crops grow so big

45
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:54,879
and bulky that we don't really need to

46
00:02:52,159 --> 00:02:56,599
get two crops to make money and produce

47
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:58,760
amount of food like this celery is an

48
00:02:56,599 --> 00:03:00,519
example this celery is going to be

49
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,879
almost double the size dies by the time

50
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:04,760
we Harvest it and it'll be worth at

51
00:03:01,879 --> 00:03:07,280
least $5 each um so we don't need to get

52
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:08,799
two crops for that but most of the other

53
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,440
crops you see behind me like these

54
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,519
carrots um they're the second crop this

55
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,200
is a fall crop so the technique that I'm

56
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,640
talking about is growing really high

57
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:23,720
yield crops and growing multiple crops

58
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:25,400
in the same space if possible um so both

59
00:03:23,720 --> 00:03:27,840
of those things combined is how we get

60
00:03:25,400 --> 00:03:30,920
to $4,000 a week on a half an acre of

61
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,200
production so let's get into it and

62
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:33,959
highly encourage you to check out that

63
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:37,680
gardening course in the description it's

64
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:41,080
a game changer um you'll be able to grow

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,560
$1,200 worth of food in 200 square feet

66
00:03:41,080 --> 00:03:44,239
with the techniques I talk about in that

67
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,080
course so check it out and let's get

68
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,080
into the

69
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,560
video okay so you could probably take a

70
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,840
guess what about what I'm going to talk

71
00:03:49,560 --> 00:03:54,959
about next and that is tomatoes so

72
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:56,519
tomatoes are one of the most profitable

73
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,640
crops that we

74
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:03,439
grow on the farm and

75
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,680
uh I guess I should actually explain

76
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,400
that a little more it's not exactly

77
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,439
about profit that they bring in but the

78
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,079
yield that they bring in in this small

79
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:16,440
amount of space is incredible so these

80
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:18,519
are our granadero paste tomatoes and

81
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:21,759
they are just exploding this year it's

82
00:04:18,519 --> 00:04:23,919
the best crop I've ever had and

83
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,040
um we're

84
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:29,280
getting we're not just growing paste

85
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:32,120
we're growing paste beef steak heirloom

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,280
and cherry tomatoes throughout the farm

87
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:35,680
um we've got one this is our second crop

88
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:38,280
right now the first crop is still

89
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,880
producing really well um that we planted

90
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:43,759
back in April this crop we planted late

91
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:45,479
May and they're just exploding right now

92
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:48,639
we're in full tomato production right

93
00:04:45,479 --> 00:04:52,160
now we're doing 3 to 400 pounds of

94
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:55,479
tomatoes per week that's a lot and it's

95
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,440
the most I've ever done and

96
00:04:55,479 --> 00:05:01,680
um that

97
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,639
yield is uh for indeterminate tomatoes

98
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,720
so we're getting that every week and

99
00:05:03,639 --> 00:05:08,280
we've been getting about two to 250

100
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:10,199
every week since like Fourth of July and

101
00:05:08,280 --> 00:05:12,479
it just exploded once we had the second

102
00:05:10,199 --> 00:05:14,440
crop come in so that's between all four

103
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:16,120
different kinds but the paste tomatoes

104
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:19,600
are really exploding right now as you

105
00:05:16,120 --> 00:05:22,960
could see um and the way we're getting

106
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:25,240
these yields is these are grafted

107
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:29,240
tomatoes so we've graphed them onto a

108
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:31,960
root stock uh back in March and in

109
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:33,759
February for the first crop so that's a

110
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:36,520
separate variety of tomato that you

111
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:39,360
splice onto the variety you want to

112
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:41,199
produce and that increases yield a lot

113
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,039
if you get the right root stock and

114
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,319
that's really complicated I can't

115
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,840
explain it in this video and that's in

116
00:05:45,319 --> 00:05:49,759
that farm course that I've talked about

117
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:51,639
in the past and it's very hard to do I'm

118
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,680
not going to lie I've screwed it up many

119
00:05:51,639 --> 00:05:55,560
times and I've I got a pretty good

120
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:58,000
results with it this year and certain

121
00:05:55,560 --> 00:06:00,160
varieties do better but that increases

122
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,160
yields a lot

123
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,560
um so that's a big reason we're getting

124
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:06,960
the kind of yields we're getting because

125
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:10,120
there's only about a little over 200

126
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:11,639
plants in this greenhouse and

127
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:14,919
about

128
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:17,240
uh 150 in the other one so it's not a

129
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:21,199
lot of plants if you know about tomato

130
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,360
production but we get we graft them we

131
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,720
prune the bottom leaves and prune the

132
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,800
suckers so they're all growing uh up a

133
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,639
string and so that increases yields also

134
00:06:29,800 --> 00:06:34,639
in the space that we have they're in a

135
00:06:31,639 --> 00:06:36,680
greenhouse also and then they are um on

136
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:38,919
drip irrigation as well the drip

137
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:41,120
irrigation we have on a timer so it's a

138
00:06:38,919 --> 00:06:42,680
completely even watering and we don't

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:45,160
have any problems with splitting or

140
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:48,199
anything like that so it's a pretty

141
00:06:45,160 --> 00:06:49,919
complicated process but it's worth it to

142
00:06:48,199 --> 00:06:52,520
get those kinds of numbers because right

143
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,000
now we're actually getting $5 a pound

144
00:06:52,520 --> 00:06:57,919
for all those tomatoes and $7 a pound

145
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:01,240
for Cherries $6 a pound for heirlooms

146
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,080
they're very valuable and climate nobody

147
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,440
can grow them in their Garden here

148
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,000
because it's still below 50° at night so

149
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,919
very few people can have tomatoes in the

150
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:14,039
western mountains you know again I'm in

151
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:16,479
Cody Wyoming for anybody who's new so

152
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:18,520
it's a very mountainous cold climate so

153
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,360
it's very hard to grow tomatoes here so

154
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:22,440
they're very valuable I'm the only guy

155
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,800
at a big city market with them so it's

156
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,639
pretty easy to get that price and I just

157
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,720
heard that organic Tomatoes at the store

158
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:31,039
are $5 a pound anyway so I don't feel

159
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:33,879
bad at all about that price I used to

160
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,960
think that was really expensive um but

161
00:07:33,879 --> 00:07:38,319
after doing the work involved with this

162
00:07:35,960 --> 00:07:40,120
we're pruning these and maintaining them

163
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:42,840
every week I have employees managing

164
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:44,560
them it's a very intense process so

165
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,280
that's how we can get those numbers but

166
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,120
when you get that kind of price it's

167
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,400
it's quite a bit of money so that's

168
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:52,240
almost ,000 a week in tomatoes right now

169
00:07:51,400 --> 00:07:55,199
probably

170
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:57,759
more uh and it goes up and down depends

171
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,000
on the yield they

172
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,560
ripen uh differently depending on the

173
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
weather there's all sorts of factors in

174
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,400
there but those kinds of numbers are

175
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,319
possible with that that amount of space

176
00:08:05,400 --> 00:08:10,400
we're only using a quarter or a little

177
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,199
less than half of the greenhous this

178
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,520
whole Greenhouse for tomatoes so we

179
00:08:12,199 --> 00:08:17,520
still have room to grow all sorts of

180
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:20,319
other stuff like cucumbers which are the

181
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:24,360
other ridiculously profitable crop that

182
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:28,039
we get great numbers on um we're getting

183
00:08:24,360 --> 00:08:29,599
about 200 cucumbers a week right now and

184
00:08:28,039 --> 00:08:31,200
that's actually kind of low for the

185
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,640
amount of plants I'm sure we can get

186
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:36,519
better um and uh we kind of do the

187
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,080
similar technique with tomatoes we prune

188
00:08:36,519 --> 00:08:39,479
the bottom leaves in the suckers with

189
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:42,880
those and grow them up a string with

190
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:47,560
drip tape um similar fertility we're

191
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:52,120
doing um we fed these crops every week

192
00:08:47,560 --> 00:08:54,640
um with uh alala meal and stuff that

193
00:08:52,120 --> 00:08:56,040
also helps a lot I've noticed um just

194
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,600
after this is like the third year I've

195
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:01,360
been doing this so it's working really

196
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:03,440
really well um and so that's those all

197
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,040
that work gets you those kinds of

198
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:07,959
numbers and if you have really good

199
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:11,120
employees it doesn't cost that much it

200
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:12,880
just you you need to do it fast and um

201
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,920
make sure that those F fertilizers

202
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,360
aren't that expensive so it's it becomes

203
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,079
really profitable when you do it that

204
00:09:16,360 --> 00:09:23,360
way um but those two crops are bringing

205
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:26,600
in the bulk of that $4,000 it's about

206
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,560
$1,500 a week um between the two of

207
00:09:26,600 --> 00:09:31,480
those and it's every single week it's

208
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:33,279
just like Clockwork um I don't have to

209
00:09:31,480 --> 00:09:35,360
replant another crop it just keeps

210
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:36,920
coming you know so it's a really nice

211
00:09:35,360 --> 00:09:38,680
crop it's you know we've been getting

212
00:09:36,920 --> 00:09:41,720
those kinds of numbers with tomatoes for

213
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:43,800
since the 4th of July um and the other

214
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:45,760
thing about it is it helps sell all the

215
00:09:43,800 --> 00:09:48,440
other crops I'm going to talk about

216
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:50,160
tomatoes just when you are the only guy

217
00:09:48,440 --> 00:09:53,600
with tomatoes at the market you could

218
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:55,200
sell almost anything you want so the

219
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,320
other crops I'm about to talk about are

220
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,160
even more profitable um but they're

221
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,200
harder to sell so when you put them

222
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:03,640
right next to your Tomatoes you can

223
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:05,880
really make a lot of money that way so

224
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,360
um yeah I think that's kind of helpful

225
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,839
information for people who are kind of

226
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:11,480
getting into this and learning what kind

227
00:10:08,839 --> 00:10:13,240
of numbers you can make but this is

228
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:14,720
literally what we're making right at

229
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,600
this minute and I'm sure we can make a

230
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:20,000
lot more in the future and it's hard the

231
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,560
the big caveat with tomatoes is it takes

232
00:10:20,000 --> 00:10:25,279
a lot of skill to grow like this I mean

233
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:26,720
I screwed up bad this is the fourth year

234
00:10:25,279 --> 00:10:28,600
I've been growing them like this and it

235
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:32,399
was not even close to those numbers the

236
00:10:28,600 --> 00:10:34,480
first three there's a lot of little um

237
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,399
intricacies that I can't explain in this

238
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,480
video um that you have to

239
00:10:37,399 --> 00:10:43,320
learn um to get those kinds of numbers

240
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,079
it's not really that easy especially and

241
00:10:43,320 --> 00:10:47,000
it all depends on your climate too so

242
00:10:45,079 --> 00:10:48,240
there's a lot of things I don't want to

243
00:10:47,000 --> 00:10:50,360
make it sound like it's easy to get

244
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,160
those numbers but um that's the numbers

245
00:10:50,360 --> 00:10:54,030
we're getting right now let's move on to

246
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,140
the next

247
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:57,140
[Music]

248
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:03,120
crops all right so next thing I'm going

249
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,600
to talk about is uh probably the biggest

250
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:08,320
money maker of all which is salad greens

251
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:11,959
and I'm kind of leaving that as a broad

252
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:14,480
category because it kind of um cut

253
00:11:11,959 --> 00:11:16,880
greens we grow like a bunch of different

254
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,560
kinds of those we grow salanova lettuce

255
00:11:16,880 --> 00:11:22,079
is the biggest um arugula is second

256
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:24,680
biggest we grow tons of both of these

257
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:28,240
but we also do tons of spinach miners

258
00:11:24,680 --> 00:11:30,040
lettuce baby kale all cut salad greens

259
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:34,120
that are Bubble

260
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:36,600
spun dried and baged and it all pretty

261
00:11:34,120 --> 00:11:38,399
much is the same price just depends on

262
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,959
you know the volume people are buying

263
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:43,880
but um the price changes a little bit in

264
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,040
the winter when we're you know really

265
00:11:43,880 --> 00:11:47,720
the only person with any fresh produce

266
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:50,480
that's a little more expensive but

267
00:11:47,720 --> 00:11:53,040
bottom line is uh we're doing about 60

268
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:56,040
to 80 pounds of salad greens a week

269
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:58,160
right now and lots of other Farms do way

270
00:11:56,040 --> 00:12:00,720
more numbers than that but just at the

271
00:11:58,160 --> 00:12:04,920
level that we're at in our Market that's

272
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:08,160
what's working um we're selling about 30

273
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:11,440
40% of that no actually bought 50% of

274
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,399
that to restaurants um we're slowly

275
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:17,040
selling more and more at this new market

276
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:19,880
we're at at full retail price so we're

277
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:23,000
getting anywhere from s to $10 a pound

278
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:24,760
on the greens um lots more of them are

279
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:27,320
starting to go to the Farmers Market at

280
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:30,079
$10 a pound and that's working really

281
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:31,680
really well um you know it's taken me a

282
00:12:30,079 --> 00:12:34,839
while to get to that level it's hard to

283
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,360
get a top dollar for them when that's

284
00:12:34,839 --> 00:12:38,680
all you're selling but now that we're

285
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:41,480
selling at a bigger Market with a lot

286
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,199
more people we can get a better price

287
00:12:41,480 --> 00:12:46,320
and

288
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:47,079
um the real key with this is the yields

289
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,000
you

290
00:12:47,079 --> 00:12:54,040
know the price is definitely important

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,839
but uh you know the more yield you can

292
00:12:54,040 --> 00:12:59,959
sell keyword selling um is where you can

293
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,360
really make the money there so you know

294
00:12:59,959 --> 00:13:04,839
that's that's

295
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:08,959
providing you know $600 to $800 a week

296
00:13:04,839 --> 00:13:11,120
basically uh and we really want to sell

297
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,920
them more more and more at the uh

298
00:13:11,120 --> 00:13:15,399
Farmers Market but you got to be careful

299
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,760
with it because these are the one

300
00:13:15,399 --> 00:13:20,320
product that definitely have a shelf

301
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:22,680
life the Salen NOA has an incredible

302
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:25,519
shelf life for a cut lettuce it probably

303
00:13:22,680 --> 00:13:27,399
lasts 7 to 10 days I've had it last two

304
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:29,600
weeks and I probably would still sell it

305
00:13:27,399 --> 00:13:32,199
it's incredible I don't know why but it

306
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:34,839
just when it's growing well it lasts a

307
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:38,240
really long time but arugula is really

308
00:13:34,839 --> 00:13:39,880
about a week max four to seven days and

309
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,839
most of the other greens don't last as

310
00:13:39,880 --> 00:13:44,880
long spinach lasts a really long time so

311
00:13:42,839 --> 00:13:47,560
you got to make sure you sell it um

312
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:50,120
because if you cut it and wash it dry it

313
00:13:47,560 --> 00:13:51,720
and it goes bad you got problems and

314
00:13:50,120 --> 00:13:53,240
having a cold room is a really key

315
00:13:51,720 --> 00:13:54,720
detail here that's what's going to

316
00:13:53,240 --> 00:13:56,880
pretty much guarantee that you sell it

317
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:59,480
all when I used to do this before I had

318
00:13:56,880 --> 00:14:01,680
a cold room it was just so much riskier

319
00:13:59,480 --> 00:14:04,839
if there was a slow Market I lose all

320
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,639
you know half the crop so key detail is

321
00:14:04,839 --> 00:14:08,600
being able to sell it and having a cold

322
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:09,759
room because once if you have a slow

323
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:11,680
Market you could at least bring it back

324
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,000
to the cold room and find another Market

325
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,480
but um salad greens are a huge part of

326
00:14:14,000 --> 00:14:19,839
the business um you know and you can't

327
00:14:17,480 --> 00:14:22,680
it's hard in my market to sell these by

328
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:25,000
themselves you got to sell them with

329
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:26,639
some kind of draw in the summertime at

330
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:28,240
least you know so those tomatoes are

331
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,600
what I'm talking about that's a huge

332
00:14:28,240 --> 00:14:31,480
draw

333
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:33,000
um we're the only people with tomatoes

334
00:14:31,480 --> 00:14:36,120
at the market right now and that's how

335
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:40,120
we're able to sell you know 40 pounds of

336
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:43,440
this at full retail price um you know

337
00:14:40,120 --> 00:14:46,360
and uh this particular Salon NOA lettuce

338
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:49,040
also is just a spectacular product um it

339
00:14:46,360 --> 00:14:51,199
lasts really long time people love it

340
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,480
it's very versatile you can put it on

341
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:57,000
sandwiches restaurants love it um it's

342
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:58,639
easy to harvest you know the way we can

343
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:03,079
get really good yields on this this

344
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:07,560
whole B when we cut it will probably

345
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:09,639
yield 50 60 lbs cuz it's going to this

346
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:13,199
isn't really ready yet this is two two

347
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:14,600
weeks away and it'll get way bigger um

348
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,360
it'll fill out the bed and it'll be

349
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:19,720
completely like an ocean of lettuce and

350
00:15:16,360 --> 00:15:21,839
we'll cut it and then it regrows a

351
00:15:19,720 --> 00:15:25,000
slightly lower yield the second cut but

352
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:27,440
it does grow a second cut and um you'll

353
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:30,120
get at least 80 pounds per bed that's a

354
00:15:27,440 --> 00:15:31,639
lot of money right there that's if you

355
00:15:30,120 --> 00:15:34,519
do the math on that it's just say you

356
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:39,360
get $7 a pound I think

357
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:41,759
that's oh it's seven time eight I'm not

358
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:43,800
um I don't know I can't remember it off

359
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:44,720
the top of my head but uh you know

360
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:49,600
that's

361
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:51,160
between like6 and $800 you know on in

362
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,240
about 60

363
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:57,040
days um that's really profitable you

364
00:15:54,240 --> 00:15:59,480
know most crops don't yield that kind of

365
00:15:57,040 --> 00:16:02,680
number so we really try to focus a lot

366
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:04,360
on this um it's a very expensive seed

367
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,680
there's a lot to Growing lettuce but

368
00:16:04,360 --> 00:16:08,440
once you get good at growing lettuce you

369
00:16:06,680 --> 00:16:10,480
can grow any kind of lettuce and it

370
00:16:08,440 --> 00:16:13,639
works well so that's a really big part

371
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:16,160
of our business is cut greens so 60 to

372
00:16:13,639 --> 00:16:19,000
80 pounds is part of that $4,000 number

373
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:22,079
let's move on to the next

374
00:16:19,000 --> 00:16:23,759
crop so these are probably the most

375
00:16:22,079 --> 00:16:27,560
underrated

376
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:31,480
crop ever these are

377
00:16:27,560 --> 00:16:35,480
peases and uh I started growing these

378
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:37,360
two years ago and um I just started

379
00:16:35,480 --> 00:16:39,360
actually selling them in the summer this

380
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:40,480
year I normally was just doing it in the

381
00:16:39,360 --> 00:16:42,240
winter because I figured they'd be

382
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,399
really hard to sell and they are pretty

383
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:48,160
hard to sell but in when you have a

384
00:16:45,399 --> 00:16:50,199
really good market and you have a draw

385
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,639
crop like tomatoes you could sell a lot

386
00:16:50,199 --> 00:16:56,399
of these and um we also do sunflower

387
00:16:53,639 --> 00:17:01,000
shoots and a couple other micro greens

388
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:04,360
um but these yield incredible amounts of

389
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:06,240
shoots per flat this one flat right here

390
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:09,000
will probably yield 2

391
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:11,799
lbs just about two pounds of peash

392
00:17:09,000 --> 00:17:15,959
shoots at $16 a pound I could sell at

393
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:17,919
the market all day and people really

394
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:20,839
love them after they try them it's great

395
00:17:17,919 --> 00:17:24,000
on a sandwich um it's a great little

396
00:17:20,839 --> 00:17:27,600
rabbit food thing to add to the salad

397
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:29,799
department on your booth and um you know

398
00:17:27,600 --> 00:17:31,960
we're selling about

399
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:34,280
eight pounds at the market a week right

400
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:37,720
now of this in sunflower shoots it's

401
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:41,440
doing really really well um

402
00:17:37,720 --> 00:17:43,120
so that's a huge Money Maker um we also

403
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:47,280
sell this to restaurants the restaurants

404
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:50,679
love to buy it um and uh you know it a

405
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:52,520
lot of um wholesalers are selling peas

406
00:17:50,679 --> 00:17:54,160
shots anyway and a fancy restaurant's

407
00:17:52,520 --> 00:17:55,760
going to be buying them anyway so your

408
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:58,320
product is going to be 10 times better

409
00:17:55,760 --> 00:18:00,480
than theirs anyway because it's so fresh

410
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,919
it has a great shelf life it's almost

411
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:05,360
better than salad greens for some reason

412
00:18:02,919 --> 00:18:07,520
I'm finding it lasts like two weeks no

413
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:10,360
problem I don't know why you know every

414
00:18:07,520 --> 00:18:13,039
sing you'll find that every single leaf

415
00:18:10,360 --> 00:18:15,440
crop has a different shelf life like

416
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:18,360
herbs are really weird too certain herbs

417
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:20,320
will last forever certain ones won't but

418
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,039
shoots are a huge Money Maker we're

419
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:26,720
doing eight pounds a week at $16 a pound

420
00:18:24,039 --> 00:18:28,120
so that's a huge part of that $4,000 and

421
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:31,080
we just started really doing well with

422
00:18:28,120 --> 00:18:33,520
that about two weeks ago um but it works

423
00:18:31,080 --> 00:18:36,640
really well when you play it off salad

424
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:38,400
mix and arugula you can do a two for

425
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,799
nine deal or something where you mix and

426
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,760
match and people will buy one bag of

427
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:47,960
salad mix one 5 oce bag of this works

428
00:18:42,760 --> 00:18:49,919
great um and uh you know it just it's a

429
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:52,120
very very good money maker so you got to

430
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:54,400
try doing it if you are doing any kind

431
00:18:52,120 --> 00:18:57,240
of farming and very easy to produce once

432
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:58,559
you learn how um and it's I can't

433
00:18:57,240 --> 00:19:00,360
explain how to do it here but there's a

434
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:03,760
lot of videos out there on how to do it

435
00:19:00,360 --> 00:19:03,760
so highly recommend you try

436
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:10,559
shoots okay

437
00:19:08,320 --> 00:19:14,600
so you might be able to guess what our

438
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:16,760
next crop is if you've ever grown them

439
00:19:14,600 --> 00:19:20,520
and that is carrots I've talked about

440
00:19:16,760 --> 00:19:21,440
this in a couple other videos but um we

441
00:19:20,520 --> 00:19:24,520
have

442
00:19:21,440 --> 00:19:28,720
like oh I forgot how many there are 1

443
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:30,480
two three four five six at least six

444
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,039
beds of carrots growing out in the field

445
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:36,520
right now and

446
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:39,520
about eight or so growing in the G green

447
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:42,159
houses so um that can tell you a little

448
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,840
bit of how important carrots are for the

449
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:47,480
farm

450
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:49,720
um we're doing about 150 to 200 Bunches

451
00:19:47,480 --> 00:19:51,840
of carrots a week so one of these beds

452
00:19:49,720 --> 00:19:54,559
gets harvested every week at least

453
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:56,200
sometimes two um we have enough labor

454
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:58,919
right now where we can do that it does

455
00:19:56,200 --> 00:20:02,840
take quite a while to harvest carrots

456
00:19:58,919 --> 00:20:05,960
um but carrots are

457
00:20:02,840 --> 00:20:08,320
just they're just like a bombproof crop

458
00:20:05,960 --> 00:20:10,240
because you're always going to sell them

459
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:12,080
um you know you can either sell them

460
00:20:10,240 --> 00:20:13,720
bunched or you break them down and sell

461
00:20:12,080 --> 00:20:17,159
them into one pound bags and people are

462
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:19,240
going to buy them um so we grow them a

463
00:20:17,159 --> 00:20:23,679
lot of them fresh Bunch that's the best

464
00:20:19,240 --> 00:20:25,240
way to make money um but you know worst

465
00:20:23,679 --> 00:20:27,400
case scenario you break them down after

466
00:20:25,240 --> 00:20:30,360
the market and sell them bagged and

467
00:20:27,400 --> 00:20:32,039
that's pretty good as well um a lot of

468
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:33,120
what you see right here is our storage

469
00:20:32,039 --> 00:20:35,120
crop that we're going to sell in the

470
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,280
winter um so there's variety that's

471
00:20:35,120 --> 00:20:40,320
supposed to last six months or something

472
00:20:38,280 --> 00:20:44,360
um so we're going to do like 600 pounds

473
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:46,760
of those um and sell them slowly over

474
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:48,320
the winter you know um I don't want to

475
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:50,679
do too many of that too much of that

476
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:54,000
because it's pretty hard to harvest 600

477
00:20:50,679 --> 00:20:56,120
pounds in like a day uh and we try to do

478
00:20:54,000 --> 00:20:58,080
it quick because you want to harvest

479
00:20:56,120 --> 00:20:59,919
that before it gets too cold um

480
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,240
otherwise they've turned a little bit

481
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:04,440
crunchy and weird but they don't store

482
00:21:02,240 --> 00:21:06,720
as well so we'll Harvest those sometime

483
00:21:04,440 --> 00:21:09,280
in October probably this year but

484
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:12,120
carrots are a big backbone of the farm

485
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:14,960
and basically all root crops but carrots

486
00:21:12,120 --> 00:21:16,679
are the most important because a lot of

487
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,600
people can grow beets and radishes and

488
00:21:16,679 --> 00:21:20,400
stuff in their Garden but very few grow

489
00:21:18,600 --> 00:21:23,080
carrots well because it's hard to

490
00:21:20,400 --> 00:21:26,120
germinate them and

491
00:21:23,080 --> 00:21:28,039
it's uh that's the number one reason I

492
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:29,760
think um most people just can't

493
00:21:28,039 --> 00:21:31,960
germinate them or they forget to plant

494
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:35,480
them again in July you know we plant

495
00:21:31,960 --> 00:21:38,440
them basically every every month we'll

496
00:21:35,480 --> 00:21:42,240
do a big planting uh four or five beds

497
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:45,400
at a time and do uh you know start that

498
00:21:42,240 --> 00:21:47,039
in like March through July you know and

499
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:48,480
that's our carrots for the whole year

500
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:50,520
pretty much I've tried doing a couple

501
00:21:48,480 --> 00:21:53,720
weird plantings in January and that sort

502
00:21:50,520 --> 00:21:55,320
of works um but yeah we do lots and lots

503
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:58,720
of carrots it's a big back pone of the

504
00:21:55,320 --> 00:22:01,520
farm and so we're doing 150 to 200 bunch

505
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:04,480
is it depends on the size of the carrots

506
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:07,039
um how big of our bunches are how good

507
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:08,799
the germination was on that bed and

508
00:22:07,039 --> 00:22:10,600
sometimes I'll Harvest them before it's

509
00:22:08,799 --> 00:22:12,400
going to yield us 200 bunches because I

510
00:22:10,600 --> 00:22:13,919
need to flip that bed to some other crop

511
00:22:12,400 --> 00:22:17,279
it doesn't really matter if we wait to

512
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:19,799
get the full yield but you know at a

513
00:22:17,279 --> 00:22:23,840
minimum of $3 a bunch that's a lot of

514
00:22:19,799 --> 00:22:26,279
money that's at least $600 a week more

515
00:22:23,840 --> 00:22:28,240
usually um we do this thing where we're

516
00:22:26,279 --> 00:22:30,320
doing Rainbow carrots and regular

517
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:31,799
carrots and you get two for six at the

518
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,400
market and that works really well but

519
00:22:31,799 --> 00:22:37,440
you charge $4 for one so you're getting

520
00:22:35,400 --> 00:22:38,880
basically 350 a bunch that way and it

521
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:40,960
works really well because not everybody

522
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:43,279
buys two and all sorts of stuff so

523
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,279
carrots are a big part of it we do a

524
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:46,880
fair amount of Beats radishes probably

525
00:22:45,279 --> 00:22:50,279
about the same amount in those three

526
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:52,520
crops beets radishes and green onions um

527
00:22:50,279 --> 00:22:55,320
a week but our yields on those have not

528
00:22:52,520 --> 00:22:57,559
been as good as I want them to be um

529
00:22:55,320 --> 00:22:59,720
mostly that's just because of just stuff

530
00:22:57,559 --> 00:23:01,520
going wrong and I don't really try that

531
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,400
hard on Beats because they don't make

532
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:06,520
that much money um they're a lot harder

533
00:23:04,400 --> 00:23:08,919
to sell also carrots just I'll sell

534
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:11,440
three to one on Beats

535
00:23:08,919 --> 00:23:13,400
um you know people don't get as excited

536
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:14,919
about Beats radishes have been very good

537
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:17,360
but they don't grow well in the summer I

538
00:23:14,919 --> 00:23:19,039
can't get them to produce well when the

539
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:21,159
flea beetles are going crazy and it's

540
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:23,279
hot so I wish I could grow more radishes

541
00:23:21,159 --> 00:23:25,120
I think next year I will be able to but

542
00:23:23,279 --> 00:23:29,240
um so that's a huge part of that number

543
00:23:25,120 --> 00:23:29,240
two let's move on to the next crop

544
00:23:36,640 --> 00:23:45,200
all right so herbs in general are

545
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:47,159
um a huge part of our business now um

546
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,760
slowly built that into the business

547
00:23:47,159 --> 00:23:50,919
because it is hard to sell them on their

548
00:23:48,760 --> 00:23:52,640
own but we're selling a lot to

549
00:23:50,919 --> 00:23:54,760
restaurants right now and a lot at the

550
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:57,880
farmers market so right now we're only

551
00:23:54,760 --> 00:24:00,480
doing parsley cilantro and Dill and

552
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:02,679
they're all kind of of growing roughly

553
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:05,240
the same and bunched the same priced the

554
00:24:02,679 --> 00:24:08,240
same we're doing about $3 a bunch for

555
00:24:05,240 --> 00:24:10,559
roughly a 4 o Bunch but sometimes it's 6

556
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:14,480
oun or8 ounces depending on what's going

557
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:17,039
on but um these are really profitable

558
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,640
crops I mean this one B of parsley will

559
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,640
probably bring in

560
00:24:18,640 --> 00:24:24,120
$800 and that's because we're going to

561
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:26,240
harvest it at least twice and there's

562
00:24:24,120 --> 00:24:29,960
going to

563
00:24:26,240 --> 00:24:33,120
be probably 300

564
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:35,520
something bunches coming out of here um

565
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,679
and uh it might be a little less than

566
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:39,880
800 actually because this one won't uh

567
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:42,279
go as long but that first bed we had did

568
00:24:39,880 --> 00:24:44,799
at least $1,000 because we harvested it

569
00:24:42,279 --> 00:24:48,360
like three times parsley comes back

570
00:24:44,799 --> 00:24:50,520
again and again and again and um you

571
00:24:48,360 --> 00:24:51,679
know it's really valuable at a market

572
00:24:50,520 --> 00:24:54,480
like mine because you're if you're the

573
00:24:51,679 --> 00:24:56,399
only guy with it people want that and if

574
00:24:54,480 --> 00:24:58,399
it's really fresh you they get a big

575
00:24:56,399 --> 00:25:00,960
bunch that looks way better than the old

576
00:24:58,399 --> 00:25:03,000
stuff at the store it's a huge huge

577
00:25:00,960 --> 00:25:05,760
Money Maker you just got to have a cold

578
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:08,399
room and you know be able to store it um

579
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:10,360
and this one has a great shelf life um

580
00:25:08,399 --> 00:25:13,360
cilantro and Dill which is what you see

581
00:25:10,360 --> 00:25:16,120
behind me um we do a lot of that as well

582
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:18,320
that's probably even more profitable but

583
00:25:16,120 --> 00:25:21,039
well not quite because it's just you

584
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:22,640
have to plant that so much more often

585
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,880
partially you plant it once and it just

586
00:25:22,640 --> 00:25:26,960
keeps going but the cilantro and Dill

587
00:25:24,880 --> 00:25:29,039
will bolt but we're getting at least two

588
00:25:26,960 --> 00:25:30,880
crops out of that each bed and it's just

589
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:32,640
a truckload we're selling a lot of those

590
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,279
to restaurants and the cilantro is just

591
00:25:32,640 --> 00:25:36,320
going like hot cakes at the market

592
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:40,120
because people are making salsa with the

593
00:25:36,320 --> 00:25:43,000
tomatoes um so we're doing 150 to 200

594
00:25:40,120 --> 00:25:45,399
Bunches of of herbs per week right now

595
00:25:43,000 --> 00:25:47,440
between the three of those crops um at

596
00:25:45,399 --> 00:25:49,760
between two to $3 a bunch you know

597
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:52,919
depending on who's buying it so that's a

598
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:56,039
huge part of that number I anticipate

599
00:25:52,919 --> 00:25:59,440
we'll be doing at least 500 bunches a

600
00:25:56,039 --> 00:26:01,600
week soon um not not this year but next

601
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:03,559
year um because the Market's just going

602
00:26:01,600 --> 00:26:05,640
to keep as our production of things like

603
00:26:03,559 --> 00:26:08,399
tomatoes and those draw crops increase

604
00:26:05,640 --> 00:26:09,799
and our reputation increases we'll just

605
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:11,120
sell more we'll sell more the

606
00:26:09,799 --> 00:26:13,960
restaurants we're going to also start

607
00:26:11,120 --> 00:26:15,520
doing perennial herbs like oregano

608
00:26:13,960 --> 00:26:18,799
Rosemary stuff like that you could

609
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,440
charge more for those um and they all

610
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:25,520
herbs grow back so you get at least two

611
00:26:21,440 --> 00:26:28,720
cuts per per bed and um it's it's not a

612
00:26:25,520 --> 00:26:30,720
super sexy crop you know it's not G but

613
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:32,039
once you get people into it they're

614
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,679
going to come back to your booth just to

615
00:26:32,039 --> 00:26:36,440
buy those like deal people I have a lot

616
00:26:34,679 --> 00:26:38,240
of Eastern European customers that are

617
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:40,320
coming back just to buy deal and our

618
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:41,760
deal looks so much better than most deal

619
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:45,000
at the market because it doesn't go to

620
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:47,240
seed it's always fresh we plant it all

621
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:49,000
the time to keep it that way but it's

622
00:26:47,240 --> 00:26:53,320
worth it because of the amount of

623
00:26:49,000 --> 00:26:56,880
production you can get and yield so um

624
00:26:53,320 --> 00:26:59,760
really big part of our business you know

625
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:03,320
that's uh what is that you know $500 to

626
00:26:59,760 --> 00:27:05,080
$600 a week just in those crops and um

627
00:27:03,320 --> 00:27:07,960
we did it terrible with basil this year

628
00:27:05,080 --> 00:27:09,399
basil is another huge Money Maker but um

629
00:27:07,960 --> 00:27:11,399
I just didn't do a very good job of

630
00:27:09,399 --> 00:27:13,559
growing the plants this year so they're

631
00:27:11,399 --> 00:27:16,320
really behind and not growing well but

632
00:27:13,559 --> 00:27:18,399
basil is even more money so herbs are

633
00:27:16,320 --> 00:27:21,000
just a big big part of making a lot of

634
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,440
money in a small space so let's move on

635
00:27:21,000 --> 00:27:23,440
to the next

636
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:33,039
crops okay last but definitely not least

637
00:27:29,799 --> 00:27:36,320
is um what I'm calling miscellaneous

638
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:39,000
crops which is like a lot of different

639
00:27:36,320 --> 00:27:40,960
crops but um they all we kind of sell

640
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:43,039
them all the same they're all about like

641
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:48,799
three to four dollar per

642
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:51,880
unit um and we're doing 250 to 300 of

643
00:27:48,799 --> 00:27:53,279
those units per week on between all the

644
00:27:51,880 --> 00:27:55,679
different stuff you know it depends on

645
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:57,240
the week so like cabbage was really hot

646
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:59,039
the last couple weeks we're almost done

647
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:02,240
with that that was three a unit we're

648
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:06,159
doing 50 60 heads of those a week head

649
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:08,440
lettuce 50 60 heads of those a week

650
00:28:06,159 --> 00:28:11,159
celery um that's just going to start

651
00:28:08,440 --> 00:28:12,880
coming on in a couple weeks um we're

652
00:28:11,159 --> 00:28:14,919
actually doing Bunch celery right now we

653
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:18,480
just started that I just did a hundred

654
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:21,080
Bunches of those today um and those were

655
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:23,840
selling at $4 a bunch celery is a very

656
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:26,200
profitable crop because nobody grows it

657
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:28,559
and it's delicious tastes so much better

658
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:31,640
than the store organic celery right now

659
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,760
is $4 a pound or something right now at

660
00:28:31,640 --> 00:28:37,320
the store so it's like exactly the same

661
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:40,640
as the store but Whitey years better um

662
00:28:37,320 --> 00:28:43,519
celery is a really good one um it takes

663
00:28:40,640 --> 00:28:46,000
forever to grow but once you have it and

664
00:28:43,519 --> 00:28:47,399
people have tried it it's it's a big

665
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:49,760
money maker because you could charge a

666
00:28:47,399 --> 00:28:52,320
lot for it people who are juicing are

667
00:28:49,760 --> 00:28:54,919
going to buy a truckload of it because

668
00:28:52,320 --> 00:28:57,440
it's actually really cheap for juice

669
00:28:54,919 --> 00:29:01,200
because it's like 100% juice and the

670
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,640
juice quality is off the charts so um

671
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,559
saler is one of my favorites um we sell

672
00:29:03,640 --> 00:29:08,960
we're trying it as head full head and

673
00:29:06,559 --> 00:29:11,039
bunched this year the bunching you can

674
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:13,279
actually pick we're going to get at

675
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,720
least two crops out of that batch um if

676
00:29:13,279 --> 00:29:17,320
you plant it early enough you could get

677
00:29:14,720 --> 00:29:20,720
three you just take the outer stems and

678
00:29:17,320 --> 00:29:24,039
then it regrows from the center um big

679
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:26,039
big money maker um so between those all

680
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:28,120
those it's like $1,000 dollar a week in

681
00:29:26,039 --> 00:29:31,880
those miscellaneous crops and that means

682
00:29:28,120 --> 00:29:33,240
that's including kale chard um stuff

683
00:29:31,880 --> 00:29:35,039
like that you know so we try and

684
00:29:33,240 --> 00:29:37,640
incorporate a lot of those to add

685
00:29:35,039 --> 00:29:41,200
variety to the table we're growing 25

686
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:42,360
different crops right now um I don't

687
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,159
know if that's going to change a whole

688
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:47,799
lot in the future and we might go up to

689
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:49,240
40 maybe a maximum but um there's just

690
00:29:47,799 --> 00:29:51,159
this there's a I don't want to do too

691
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,000
much variety because it gets hard each

692
00:29:51,159 --> 00:29:56,600
crop is a definitely a skill set in

693
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,200
growing I'd say actually throughout the

694
00:29:56,600 --> 00:29:59,679
year we do probably grow about 4

695
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:02,080
different crops but right now it's about

696
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:03,760
25 that we're actually harvesting that's

697
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:06,960
including stuff like summer squash and

698
00:30:03,760 --> 00:30:11,399
zucchini but all those crops add up to

699
00:30:06,960 --> 00:30:13,240
money um at your Market table and so um

700
00:30:11,399 --> 00:30:14,600
so between all of the crops I've talked

701
00:30:13,240 --> 00:30:18,120
about in this video that's where we're

702
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:20,799
getting the average of $4,000 a week and

703
00:30:18,120 --> 00:30:22,880
last week was almost five this week will

704
00:30:20,799 --> 00:30:24,519
be probably close to five and then it'll

705
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:26,159
start to go down again so it really

706
00:30:24,519 --> 00:30:28,159
depends on what's going on you know

707
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:29,720
we're going to harvest shallots soon and

708
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:32,039
that's going to be that'll make it like

709
00:30:29,720 --> 00:30:34,080
6,000 but that's something we sell

710
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:35,519
throughout the year and when I say 4,000

711
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:37,960
a week it doesn't necessarily mean we're

712
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:41,640
selling that every week although right

713
00:30:37,960 --> 00:30:44,519
now we pretty much are um some of it we

714
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:46,480
store and sell later like carrots bagged

715
00:30:44,519 --> 00:30:48,080
will sell later if we have a bumper crop

716
00:30:46,480 --> 00:30:50,240
we could stretch that a little bit

717
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:52,200
because we have a cold room stuff like

718
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:53,960
cabbage also if I needed to harvest a

719
00:30:52,200 --> 00:30:56,399
whole bed at once I could sell that

720
00:30:53,960 --> 00:30:58,200
months later if I wanted to celery I

721
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:01,480
could probably sell a month later it's

722
00:30:58,200 --> 00:31:04,039
forever um salad greens we got to sell

723
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:07,840
that pretty much that week but kale even

724
00:31:04,039 --> 00:31:09,600
you can stretch that for a while so um

725
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:11,039
we have sold every almost everything

726
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:13,720
we've grown this year there's a couple

727
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:15,480
pounds of greens that we didn't sell at

728
00:31:13,720 --> 00:31:16,960
the very beginning before the markets

729
00:31:15,480 --> 00:31:19,399
really picked up but we're selling

730
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:21,200
everything right now so we are producing

731
00:31:19,399 --> 00:31:23,519
$44,000 a

732
00:31:21,200 --> 00:31:25,519
week almost everything we sell is in

733
00:31:23,519 --> 00:31:27,159
about a $3 portion that's kind of

734
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,600
standard Farmers Market thing the

735
00:31:27,159 --> 00:31:31,639
tomatoes those more just cuz if we

736
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,720
didn't do that we would sell out in an

737
00:31:31,639 --> 00:31:36,679
hour and then everything else would stop

738
00:31:33,720 --> 00:31:38,880
selling you'll notice if you're in that

739
00:31:36,679 --> 00:31:40,919
position that if you sell out of

740
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:43,399
tomatoes in two hours the last two hours

741
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:46,720
your sales drop because the draw to your

742
00:31:43,399 --> 00:31:48,919
Boost stops so we are trying to sell it

743
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:51,440
slow throughout that whole period to

744
00:31:48,919 --> 00:31:53,720
sell out of the salad greens and stuff

745
00:31:51,440 --> 00:31:55,159
and it's working really really well um

746
00:31:53,720 --> 00:31:57,360
right now I don't think we're have any

747
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:59,840
problem we have so many we'll start

748
00:31:57,360 --> 00:32:02,320
freezing and selling them in the winter

749
00:31:59,840 --> 00:32:03,840
but um and even with tomatoes if you

750
00:32:02,320 --> 00:32:06,039
don't sell them you freeze them and you

751
00:32:03,840 --> 00:32:07,960
could sell them $4 a pound in the winter

752
00:32:06,039 --> 00:32:10,600
and people use them in in stews and

753
00:32:07,960 --> 00:32:13,039
stuff and it works great so you know

754
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:18,360
that $4,000 a week is just a rough

755
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:20,039
average um and um it depends I I mean we

756
00:32:18,360 --> 00:32:22,039
could really bump that up if we had

757
00:32:20,039 --> 00:32:24,919
everything going perfectly like I had

758
00:32:22,039 --> 00:32:26,919
planned might have been five but you

759
00:32:24,919 --> 00:32:29,159
know in farming a lot of things go wrong

760
00:32:26,919 --> 00:32:31,000
I'm still pretty young farm and I'm a

761
00:32:29,159 --> 00:32:34,360
young farmer I'm still learning a lot so

762
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:38,480
I still make mistakes and um things go

763
00:32:34,360 --> 00:32:41,159
wrong so um that's like you know a real

764
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:43,360
nice solid number for me I'm very happy

765
00:32:41,159 --> 00:32:45,200
with that this year um given the the

766
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:48,399
size of the farm and again we're a half

767
00:32:45,200 --> 00:32:51,760
an acre Farm I think we have a total of

768
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:55,440
about 80 50 foot beds that's not that

769
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:58,440
much 50 foot means 50 feet long 2 and

770
00:32:55,440 --> 00:33:01,200
a2t wide so this this this bed right

771
00:32:58,440 --> 00:33:05,279
here is a 50ft bed of celery that's a

772
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:08,120
50ft bed of lettuce so um we're doing

773
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:11,159
that and some of those you know the

774
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:13,360
tomatoes is like I did a video a long

775
00:33:11,159 --> 00:33:14,799
time ago earlier this year about how

776
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:16,399
much money you can make in a greenhouse

777
00:33:14,799 --> 00:33:19,320
and I talked about some of the numbers

778
00:33:16,399 --> 00:33:21,159
you can make on one bed of tomatoes one

779
00:33:19,320 --> 00:33:25,919
bed of tomatoes this year for us is

780
00:33:21,159 --> 00:33:28,159
about $2,000 in Revenue at least um and

781
00:33:25,919 --> 00:33:31,440
it depends on you know how early it is

782
00:33:28,159 --> 00:33:31,440
and stuff but

783
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:36,200
uh those numbers are just numbers you

784
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:38,600
know it depends on how successful you

785
00:33:36,200 --> 00:33:41,200
are that the weather all sorts of stuff

786
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:43,399
but Baseline numbers that's what you can

787
00:33:41,200 --> 00:33:45,480
expect if you're good and that's a key

788
00:33:43,399 --> 00:33:47,200
detail you know I I saw those some of

789
00:33:45,480 --> 00:33:49,120
these numbers a long time ago and I got

790
00:33:47,200 --> 00:33:51,440
really excited my first year and I

791
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:53,960
expected to get them and I didn't like

792
00:33:51,440 --> 00:33:57,159
things just don't work well until you

793
00:33:53,960 --> 00:34:00,000
build your skill set as a grower and um

794
00:33:57,159 --> 00:34:01,919
I'm still at myself so there's a lot of

795
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:03,360
factors involved and labor is another

796
00:34:01,919 --> 00:34:05,480
Factor too you got to have really good

797
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:08,599
labor to make all these numbers happen

798
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:10,480
easily at least and not break your back

799
00:34:08,599 --> 00:34:14,480
um and we do this year I'm very

800
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,919
fortunate that we do um but um this is

801
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:18,639
just kind of a glimpse of what is

802
00:34:16,919 --> 00:34:21,520
possible because again we're only doing

803
00:34:18,639 --> 00:34:23,399
a half an acre of production um I think

804
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:25,119
it's pretty incredible to be able to

805
00:34:23,399 --> 00:34:27,879
bring in that kind of Revenue on a half

806
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:29,720
an acre because lots of places in in the

807
00:34:27,879 --> 00:34:31,919
world have a half an acre to grow on

808
00:34:29,720 --> 00:34:34,919
it's not very much land um especially

809
00:34:31,919 --> 00:34:36,520
with the price of land going up now so

810
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:38,560
just wanted to put this video out there

811
00:34:36,520 --> 00:34:40,879
because when I first started I looked

812
00:34:38,560 --> 00:34:43,919
for these kinds of numbers like the

813
00:34:40,879 --> 00:34:46,320
yields that uh Farm was getting because

814
00:34:43,919 --> 00:34:48,440
it helps you kind of plan a potential of

815
00:34:46,320 --> 00:34:50,200
uh of your business I think it's it's

816
00:34:48,440 --> 00:34:51,919
helpful to know what other Farms are

817
00:34:50,200 --> 00:34:55,960
accomplishing so you know what's

818
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:58,119
possible at least um and um there's a

819
00:34:55,960 --> 00:35:00,240
lot of factors to yields and I'm sure my

820
00:34:58,119 --> 00:35:02,760
yields can be a lot better that that you

821
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:04,839
know I want to get better at growing

822
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:07,119
more food on a small space every single

823
00:35:04,839 --> 00:35:08,599
year in the same beted and that's how

824
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:10,880
you can really make money with this and

825
00:35:08,599 --> 00:35:13,640
I know that as as my skills improve that

826
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:16,440
will be possible but um this is what I'm

827
00:35:13,640 --> 00:35:18,079
accomplishing right now and um you know

828
00:35:16,440 --> 00:35:22,359
hopefully this inspires somebody's out

829
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:24,560
there to uh you know think twice about

830
00:35:22,359 --> 00:35:26,680
starting a farm or something so hope you

831
00:35:24,560 --> 00:35:29,119
enjoyed that and I will see you in the

832
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,119
next one
