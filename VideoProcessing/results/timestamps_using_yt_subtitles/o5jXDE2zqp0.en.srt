00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:12,960
Hello every one,
Welcome to JADAM

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,560
In this episode, I will show you\h
how to make a natural wetting agent\h\h

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:19,680
which can be used as an\h
insecticide for agriculture.

4
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,760
I have invented this technology without\h
using external heating equipment.\h

5
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,560
And it is called JADAM Weting agent.

6
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,240
The main ingredient I will be using\h
today is the 3.6 liters of canola oil.\h

7
00:00:32,240 --> 00:00:34,480
You can also use various vegetable oil.\h

8
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,680
I m using canola oil simply because of it\h
is cheapest oil available in south korea.

9
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,960
And next ingredient is 640 grams\h
of 90% pure potassium hydroxide.

10
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,240
When making JADAM Wetting\h
agent, soft water must be used.\h

11
00:00:48,240 --> 00:00:53,360
The best soft water you can get is the clean\h
rain water after 30 minutes of raining.\h

12
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,480
Also there are lot of soft\h
water below the ground as well.\h

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,960
And it is not just limited to those two.\h

14
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:04,800
You can also use water from the air\h
condition, dehumidifier and distilled water.

15
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:08,560
It is mandatory to use soft water\h
for making JADAM Wetting agent\h\h

16
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:11,840
also for the water that you are\h
going to use for the pest solution.

17
00:01:15,760 --> 00:01:21,600
Best way to identify the quality of water is\h
using small portion of JADAM Wetting agent.\h

18
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,840
The soft water show very clean and transparent.

19
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,520
And alternative way to identify soft\h
water is by using natural ditergent\h\h

20
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:37,480
sold in the market when you don\h
t have a JADAM wetting agent .
\h

21
00:01:38,160 --> 00:01:42,400
First I will weight 500 ml of\h
soft water for initial process.\h

22
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:54,080
second I m adding 640 grams\h
of potassium hydroxide.

23
00:01:54,080 --> 00:01:59,520
And next I m adding 500 ml of soft\h
water on top of potassium hydroxide.

24
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,400
Now you may see the boiling due\h
chemical reaction with water.

25
00:02:06,400 --> 00:02:11,120
Close the lid and stir the bucket\h
to melt the potassium hydroxide.

26
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:21,840
Once you are done with this, open the\h
lid to add 3.6 liters of canola oil.

27
00:02:26,240 --> 00:02:32,000
From now I will start blending the oil, before\h
doing this, make sure your blender is clean.\h

28
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,880
Once I start, you will be able\h
to see the changes in color.

29
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:55,040
I have blended about 5 minutes, and as you can\h
see the oil has turned into like a thin mayonese.\h

30
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,080
This is the completion of first initial process.

31
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,080
It has been 20 minutes after aging, as you\h
can see the solution is getting harden.\h

32
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:09,600
Right now the temperature goes\h
more than 80 celcius degree.\h

33
00:03:09,600 --> 00:03:14,320
The temperature will gradually increase\h
then decrease overtime while aging\h\h

34
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:18,000
the solution for 3 days.
During this aging process\h\h

35
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,120
the solution inside will turn\h
into like a block of butter

36
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,640
When the initial process was not done well,\h
you will b e seeing the separate layer.\h

37
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,080
But here, I don t see any separation\h
. so that means it is good to go.

38
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,280
I have waited for 3 days.
I usually recommend aging for 3 days\h\h

39
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,120
but during emergency. You\h
can also wait just 24 hours.

40
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:46,320
let s see how it s look like inside.\h

41
00:03:46,320 --> 00:03:54,080
When you touch it, It feel like a soften butter\h
or soap that has been inside of water for an hour.

42
00:03:54,080 --> 00:04:00,640
However, If your solution is bit watery or\h
more softer even after aging it for 3 days,\h\h

43
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,440
that means the initial process is not done well.\h

44
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
So to solve those issue, you\h
will have to blend it once more.

45
00:04:09,520 --> 00:04:15,360
And in next step, I will add total of 16\h
liters of water, but at first I will just\h\h

46
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:27,840
add 4 liters to cleave the solution so\h
that it will be easier to melt it down.

47
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:34,240
Once you are done poruing water, split the\h
solution to make small particle at first.\h

48
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,840
Then use the handblender to fasten the process.

49
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:49,120
Since I have added 4 liters, now I\h
will weight 12 liters of water to add.

50
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:55,600
Next step is very easy.\h

51
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:58,720
Just stir the solution\h
occasionally once in an hour.

52
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,160
Then later you will be able to see it\h
has melted within 24 hours or more.

53
00:05:05,200 --> 00:05:08,880
You can also use a electric\h
drill to fasten the process.\h

54
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,748
Use a lowe RPM to aboid overflow.

55
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:42,160
I have stirred total of 5\h
times with 1 hour intervals.\h

56
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:51,840
It is almost melted but you have to check if there\h
is any solution left on the corner of the bucket.

57
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:59,680
In the early stage in this video, we have\h
used the small hand blender, but at this point\h

58
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:06,320
It is short to proceed the bl ending. So I would\h
recommend using the long one like this drill.\h

59
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:12,000
I will now close the lid and wait little bit.

60
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:25,600
It is now all perfectly melted\h
within 22 hours after aging.\h

61
00:06:26,480 --> 00:06:31,440
I have stired 5 to 6 six time\h
with one hour interval total.

62
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,280
I will now going to store this in the bottle.\h

63
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,000
In the previous video, I have stored\h
the JADAM Sulfur in the separate bottle.\h\h

64
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:47,840
But for this one it is not so necessary. You can\h
just store it in a bucket with the lid for use.

65
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,760
It is all completed.
So total ingredient I used was the 3.6 litters\h\h

66
00:07:11,760 --> 00:07:19,840
of canola oil, 16.5 litters of water and 640\h
grams to obtain 20 liters of JADAM Wetting agent.

67
00:07:20,480 --> 00:07:23,600
And total time consumed is approximately 4 days.\h

68
00:07:23,600 --> 00:07:26,880
3 days for the aging and 1\h
day for the melting procedure.

69
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:33,600
This is the one that I made one month ago.
As you age the solution it will get clearer\h\h

70
00:07:33,600 --> 00:07:38,240
and gets bit darker.
And there is no shelf life of JADAM Wetting Agent.

71
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:45,360
More attractive part of this is that it can\h
be your laundry soap, dish soap and shampoo.

72
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:50,560
As I m introducing you the JADAM\h
wetting agent as an agriculture input\h\h

73
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,280
but this is 100% decomposable natural detergent.

74
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:57,760
By making JADAM Wetting agent. You are not\h\h

75
00:07:57,760 --> 00:08:01,760
getting a agricultural input but\h
also your daily life material.

76
00:08:01,760 --> 00:08:05,652
Thank you for watching and I will\h
see you guys on the next video.
