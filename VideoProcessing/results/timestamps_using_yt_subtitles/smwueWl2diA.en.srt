1
00:00:04,160 --> 00:00:08,320
hi i'm albert bates what i'm going to do

2
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,599
today is walk you through the process

3
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,320
that we use

4
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:15,040
uh here in my community at the farm and

5
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:17,359
at the ecovillage training center to

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,160
make biochar and we object the

7
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,560
objectives of how we do it are to make

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,560
it very simple and easy and very

9
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,880
accessible and low cost

10
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,720
it's not perfect in fact it's going to

11
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,039
lose some carbon dioxide back to the

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,719
atmosphere that could be saved if we did

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:35,360
it a slightly different way

14
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,840
but in the process that we use

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,960
you don't need very many tools

16
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,399
and

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,760
you can do this

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,800
yourself

19
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:43,760
at home

20
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:45,680
in

21
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,680
a very small area

22
00:00:45,680 --> 00:00:49,039
we like to use bamboo because we have a

23
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:51,600
lot of it

24
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,680
and because it grows very quickly

25
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,719
and so we're going to be using bamboo to

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:01:00,480
make biochar we'll make about

27
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:02,399
two wheelbarrow loads in 45 minutes

28
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:04,320
and i have a lot of bamboo at the moment

29
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,159
because it grows fast

30
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:08,880
fastest growing plant

31
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,119
on the terrestrial surface of the earth

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,240
and this is my feedstock for making

33
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:18,479
biochar for cutting bamboo i'm using two

34
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:20,240
simple tools loppers and a saber saw

35
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:22,560
battery powered

36
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:25,439
and i have a lot of bamboo coming into

37
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,400
my garden it's been creeping past the

38
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,479
fence

39
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:31,360
so now i'm going in and i'm cutting it

40
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,520
back i'm going to take it and trim it

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,920
down and make it suitable for

42
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:38,320
the biochar kiln that i'm going to build

43
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,520
and right now i'm just taking it all

44
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:41,680
down and

45
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,640
stacking it letting it dry in the sun so

46
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:47,280
it's good and dry before we burn it

47
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:51,159
just those two simple tools loppers and

48
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,159
the saber saw

49
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,560
now we're cutting the bamboo's uh

50
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
branches off using the machete that's

51
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,640
another tool

52
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,560
and after we've done that we can cut the

53
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,799
trim it down to size

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,640
uh using a table saw that we've moved

55
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:10,800
out into the forest there

56
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:13,200
this makes it very easy to trim the

57
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:14,959
bamboo combs down to the right size for

58
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,879
to fit our kiln

59
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:19,200
and after we've done that we're going to

60
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:22,239
start the fire we always start

61
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:25,360
from the top down that eliminates smoke

62
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:27,599
so we want to not have smoke coming off

63
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,120
and to do that we start a small fire

64
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:32,160
using some paper and kindling and

65
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:35,280
cardboard at the top and then let that

66
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,599
work down as we add more bamboo

67
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:39,200
and we're going to be adding bamboo

68
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,480
that we've got stacked up here dry and

69
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:41,840
ready to burn

70
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:44,480
until

71
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,160
we've completely filled the pit that

72
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:47,440
we've dug and we've dug a pit that's

73
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,080
about

74
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:52,160
1 meter deep and about two meters two

75
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:54,239
and a half meters across

76
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,560
and i'm watching the temperature here

77
00:02:54,239 --> 00:03:00,000
i'm gonna mark it

78
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:03,519
i want it above 450 degrees and i want

79
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:05,840
it uh somewhere in the 450 to 550 degree

80
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:05,840
range

81
00:03:07,040 --> 00:03:10,560
now that we've completely filled the pit

82
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,319
and

83
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,760
it's starting to turn white i don't want

84
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,720
it to go to ash

85
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:19,680
i want it to stay black that's the

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,840
biochar so it i can't let it go to the

87
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,519
final stage where it oxidizes and turns

88
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,440
to ash

89
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:27,440
so i've stuck the hose down in the

90
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:29,680
bottom of the fire so that the water

91
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:32,480
rises from the bottom of the pit

92
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:34,560
and comes and steam cleans all the pores

93
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,959
after that we move over to the chipper

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,879
shredder stage i've got a little

95
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:41,519
electric shredder here for compost

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,159
shredding and we're using that to bring

97
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:47,840
the size of the of the particles down to

98
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:47,840
the size an earthworm could digest

99
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:57,040
now we've built a second pit this one is

100
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,599
up by the driveway where i've got still

101
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,360
more bamboo to cut back i want to cut it

102
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:02,879
away from the power lines and so we

103
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:04,879
built another pit

104
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:05,840
and we started the same process over

105
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:07,680
again

106
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,680
we're letting it go to

107
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,879
the point where the pit is full

108
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:15,040
and we're keeping the ash from forming

109
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,280
we're anytime we see it

110
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:19,919
turning a little bit white we we spray

111
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:21,359
down with water or add more material and

112
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:23,040
then eventually it gets to the point

113
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:25,360
where we put the hose in the bottom let

114
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:27,040
it steam clean the pores again until

115
00:04:25,360 --> 00:04:30,400
we've quenched the fire completely it's

116
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,840
come up over the top of the biochar and

117
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:35,759
there's nothing there

118
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:37,759
on the but a pool of wet char

119
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,199
if you want to eliminate the electric

120
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,919
chipper shredder this is a way to

121
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:42,919
micronize the particles

122
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,440
the final stage of

123
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:52,320
microbialization and mineralization

124
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,880
uh involve turning the biochar into

125
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:58,320
something suitable for soil and we do

126
00:04:54,880 --> 00:05:01,039
that i bought a 30 pickup truck load of

127
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,840
composted cow manure and we moved that

128
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:05,600
down to the garden using the tractor

129
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,160
where we make a compost pile with the

130
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,160
biochar

131
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,039
biochar straight out of the kiln is

132
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:15,199
hydrophobic it repels water so we have

133
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:17,280
to moisten it and then we need to add in

134
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:20,080
the microbes the microbial community

135
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:21,600
before we add the biochar to the garden

136
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,720
otherwise it will steal it from the

137
00:05:21,600 --> 00:05:24,720
garden

138
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,440
any kind of substrate can make good

139
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,199
biochar if it's a photosynthetic origin

140
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:32,880
when it goes through the kiln it forms

141
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:36,000
new forms of biochar new forms of carbon

142
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:39,039
because carbon bonds to itself at 450 or

143
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:41,039
500 degrees and it forms ring structures

144
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
and chain structures and that's why it

145
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:45,520
endures in the soil for hundreds to

146
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:48,639
thousands of years

147
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,720
the pyrolysis process itself has many

148
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:54,000
potential yields because it produces

149
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,479
heat it's exothermic it loses about half

150
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:58,160
of the carbon back to the atmosphere but

151
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,160
it produces all the things you can

152
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,720
produce with heat

153
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,319
and it saves biochar in the soil carbon

154
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,400
in the soil and that goes into the

155
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,319
carbon cycle of the soil

156
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,600
rather than returning to the atmosphere

157
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,319
in oceans

158
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:14,400
so photosynthesis is our key ingredient

159
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,960
here that's what takes the carbon out of

160
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,560
the atmosphere out of the ocean and now

161
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
we want to change it into a form that's

162
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:23,280
going to stay in land for thousands of

163
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,280
years

164
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,840
there are many good designs for using

165
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:29,120
the heat from the process to cook with

166
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:31,120
or to

167
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,039
apply to make electricity

168
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:35,840
lots of good designs there for stoves

169
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,440
and other implements that make biochar

170
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:39,360
of course if you're doing this a lot or

171
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
with larger volumes you might want to

172
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:43,199
invest in a little more permanent pit

173
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,120
this is the

174
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,919
method of the contiki kiln easy online

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:51,759
available public domain design

176
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,440
and it can make prodigious amounts of

177
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:57,759
biochar as shown here

178
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,280
biochar absolutely has to scale if we're

179
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,360
going to get out of this century and

180
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:04,080
alive and many companies are already

181
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:06,880
jumping into this space

182
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:09,039
thanks for listening and i hope you will

183
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,360
try making biochar yourself it's going

184
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,199
to be fun and you'll have a good time

185
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:16,199
and it's simple scalable and shovel

186
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,199
ready

187
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:18,560
you
