1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:05,440
florida is a state where most people

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,040
go to the supermarket to buy their food

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:07,440
but they don't realize that they can

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,400
grow

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,639
most of their food right at home today

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:13,519
i'm really excited to have pete canaris

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,519

00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,359
and he's going to introduce you to 10

9
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:20,400
different plants that you can grow

10
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:22,640
that are super abundant and resilient

11
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,720
for the florida climate to help you grow

12
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,760
a large amount of your food at home and

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:27,680
be able to skip

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,840
those trips to the grocery store this

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,679
doesn't just apply to florida though

16
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,680
semi-tropical climates exist

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,120
around the world the caribbean central

18
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:38,719
and south america

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:41,520
southeast asia parts of africa and parts

20
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:44,160
of australia just to name some places

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,920
are all places where this can be a super

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,399
helpful video to you

23
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:50,640

24
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,640
so pete canaris here with green dreams

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,960
and i'm coming at you from tampa florida

26
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,399
i'm about 20 miles north of tampa

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,239
and we're growing into some tropical

28
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,039
environment here in 9b and i'm taking

29
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,640
over rob greenfield's channel today so

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,720
i'm putting together a video together

31
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,880
for you all on our top 10

32
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,040
food crops to grow into some tropical

33
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,280
environment for self-sufficiency and

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
these are the top 10 go-to food crops

35
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,240
that are super easy to grow

36
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,759
and something i'll tell you guys is well

37
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,200
you know we focused on plants that

38
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,759
thrive on neglect

39
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
that grow with ease most of these crops

40
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:22,240
are perennial crops and by perennial i

41
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:23,280
mean

42
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,880
something that doesn't need to be

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,000
replanted every year like you would an

44
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,320
annual this is a plant

45
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:30,079
at one time and typically forget it you

46
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:31,759
know so perennial crops are crops that

47
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:33,280
live two or more years

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:35,280
so the first one i want to talk to you

49
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,439
guys about is actually right here behind

50
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,079
me this is just over my left shoulder

51
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,240
this is chaya or tree spinach and you

52
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:43,520
can see the big giant leaves off of this

53
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,280
tree

54
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,159
and this is a really easy one to get

55
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,759
going or established in your garden

56
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,280
this is one that i tell people about all

57
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:52,799
the time and the first thing that kind

58
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,560
of scares them about this one is it has

59
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:56,479
to be cooked so chaya does need to be

60
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,640
cooked for about 10 minutes

61
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,759
there's an off gas of cyanide that comes

62
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:01,119
off of there you definitely don't want

63
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:03,040
to use an aluminum pot

64
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,799
but this is a staple crop this is a real

65
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,240
big time staple crop in like central

66
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:08,160
america

67
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,759
this is a really easy one to propagate

68
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,280
and start so you know if you wanted to

69
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,959
share this one with your friends

70
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,800
you would simply take a cutting like

71
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:16,160
this stick it in the ground

72
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,319
take off the leaves and it'll start

73
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:20,560
growing it's really that easy

74
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:22,640
the leaves from this are actually quite

75
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,599
delicious i find this tree to be really

76
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:25,280
really

77
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:26,640
the flavor of the leaves to kind of be

78
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
like a hearty

79
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,160
you know they're really filling they go

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:30,720
really well in a soup really well in a

81
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:32,800
dish

82
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:35,280
also known as tree spinach this is four

83
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
times as nutritious than typical spinach

84
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,400
and it wants to grow here it wants to

85
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,959
grow here through our hot summer

86
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,319
our humidity and our full sun the number

87
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
two plant i want to talk to you guys

88
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:45,200
about that is a must-have for your

89
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:47,200
garden is sitting here behind me and

90
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,200
this is moringa olafera

91
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,959
this one really likes full sun if you

92
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,959
noticed i had that chaya kind of in a

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,040
dappled light understory situation

94
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,560
this one wants to be out in full sun and

95
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
i look at this tree as like having a

96
00:02:56,560 --> 00:03:01,440
health food store in your backyard

97
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:03,840
this one is like 22 protein by weight

98
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:05,120
68 different antioxidants four times the

99
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:06,959
calcium of milk

100
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,640
i could go off about all the different

101
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,560
minerals and nutrients

102
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:12,400
that are inside of this plant this one

103
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,239
is literally

104
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,000
um one of the fastest growing trees we

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,840
also have on the farm so commercially

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,519
they grow these trees about a foot apart

107
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:20,239
and they prune off the new growth every

108
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:22,319
week

109
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,840
most commonly you would dry those leaves

110
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,280
and powder them but you can put this

111
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
fresh into a salad

112
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:29,519
you could put this fresh into a smoothie

113
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:30,720
you can eat this fresh like this

114
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,440
the tree is also known as the

115
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,640
horseradish tree

116
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
and that's because the leaves can be a

117
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:37,840
little bit on the spicy side i prefer

118
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
this as a supplement

119
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
i prefer this in a smoothie i find it to

120
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:43,040
be a little bit on the strong side but

121
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,120
it grows so well

122
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:46,400
it is so nutritious like the powder from

123
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:48,560
this tree

124
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:50,640
goes for 30 40. i remember when it was

125
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:53,280
60 dollars a pound so

126
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:54,640
super nutritious my number three muscro

127
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,200
cop for florida

128
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,599
um would be what rob would like to call

129
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,200
yucca or cassava or maniac

130
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:03,200
we got a lot of comments on that one

131
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
from the videos we did together

132
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,879
this is a must-grow crop super easy to

133
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:07,599
grow crop down here in florida and this

134
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,879
is um

135
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,280
you know what they would make tapioca

136
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,959
pudding from so cassava is a root crop

137
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,720
and it's really easy to get started in

138
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,639
the garden it's one that you literally

139
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:18,959
just like i showed you on the chaya

140
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,400
you take a cutting of so probably

141
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:21,840
something a little bit older than this

142
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,919
you want like three notes above three

143
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,600
nodes below the soil you just stick this

144
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,360
guy in the ground it'll grow

145
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,199
usually cassava's about an eight to nine

146
00:04:27,360 --> 00:04:29,840
month crop you'll get a root crop off of

147
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,800
that and

148
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:33,759
i just did a specific video on cassava

149
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,759
on cooking it

150
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,440
on harvesting it on growing select

151
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:38,320
varieties with my good friend josh from

152
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:39,919
heart

153
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:41,040
so if you want more detail on that head

154
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:42,320
over to my channel and you'll see a

155
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,639
little bit more specific

156
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,759
stuff with josh how they cook it how

157
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,680
they prepare it

158
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,960
i had cassava bread while i was there i

159
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:49,280
mean there's many different ways to eat

160
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:51,759
this

161
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,199
cassava must grow it the third crop i

162
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:54,639
want to talk to you about today are

163
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:55,759
sweet potatoes and

164
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:57,680
you know many people when you think

165
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,360
sweet potato you think that typical just

166
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,280
orange sweet potato but there's

167
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,520
hundreds of heirloom varieties of sweet

168
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,120
potato there are white sweet potatoes

169
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:06,880
purple sweet potatoes

170
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,880
regular typical orange sweet potatoes

171
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,960
but what a lot of people don't know is

172
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,800
you can eat the leaves and the roots of

173
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:14,560
a sweet potato so

174
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,320
sweet potatoes just happen to be one of

175
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,360
the most nutritious crops in the world

176
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,280
for that reason

177
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:21,039
so what i really like to do is to pull

178
00:05:19,280 --> 00:05:22,560
all of these young leaves off of here

179
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:24,560
and you can see i mean this isn't a very

180
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:26,080
good example of a sweet potato patch

181
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:27,520
i just have a couple of slips that we

182
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:28,639
planted here maybe a month ago that are

183
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:30,320
starting to take over

184
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:32,240
but i could tell you is if i came back

185
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:34,160
in this area in just a few weeks

186
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,680
this would be a solid sea of green so

187
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,479
the leaves are just kind of starting to

188
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:38,080
fill in

189
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,840
and you would start sweet potatoes by

190
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,440
buying just organic sweet potatoes at

191
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:43,360
the grocery store

192
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,039
sticking them in some soil letting the

193
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,320
sprouts come off and you break those off

194
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,240
and that's what would be called a slip

195
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,240
so if you don't start it from a potato

196
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,240
you actually order slips in spring from

197
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:53,680
one of these sweet potato type companies

198
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:55,680
and like i said there's many different

199
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:56,160
varieties and types and not only do you

200
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:58,160
get this

201
00:05:56,160 --> 00:05:59,919
awesome potato at the end of season

202
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:01,280
which is really fun to dig up to pull

203
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:02,160
out of the ground

204
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:03,759
you know you don't have to eat them

205
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,120
right away they can last six to nine

206
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,120
months inside of your house

207
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,919
but during that entire time you can eat

208
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,919
the leaves off of the sweet potatoes so

209
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,280
sweet potatoes are super exciting for me

210
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:14,800
because i i personally

211
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:16,400
really love the flavor of the greens

212
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:17,840
they're great sauteed with just a little

213
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:19,440
salt and pepper on them

214
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,880
make a great dish side and then you get

215
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,120
potatoes at the end of the season

216
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
so digging up sweet potatoes is probably

217
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,039
one of my favorite events out here on

218
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:27,199
the farm

219
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,800
my number five favorite perennial

220
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:29,600
vegetable to grow down here in the food

221
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,240
forest

222
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,680
is siso spinach or miami spinach and

223
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:34,319
this one makes a really nice ground

224
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,160
cover

225
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,759
can take full sun or dappled light you

226
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,120
can see i accidentally

227
00:06:37,759 --> 00:06:40,479
ripped a little bit of that root out i

228
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,520
could stick it back in the ground it'll

229
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:42,800
easily grow

230
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,520
this is one that doesn't need to be

231
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:47,759
cooked it can be eaten raw

232
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,880
it really has a nice texture to it it's

233
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:51,440
not too slimy

234
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:53,120
goes really great in a salad goes really

235
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,000
great just eating it fresh or any type

236
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,759
of dish

237
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,199
this is a great perennial vegetable that

238
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,599
i planted one time

239
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,199
that's been here for multiple years

240
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,479
that's here all summer long if i want to

241
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:03,919
come outside and have something to add

242
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:06,560
as a green on a salad

243
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:07,919
or to a plate so siso spinach is

244
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:09,280
definitely worth growing if you're in a

245
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,800
subtropical environment

246
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,880
we've got like one or two varieties of

247
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:13,599
this one it is just great you know like

248
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:15,280
i said that

249
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:16,880
has a nice crunch to the leaf it's not

250
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:18,960
too slimy

251
00:07:16,880 --> 00:07:20,319
makes a great perennial vegetable to add

252
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,960
to your landscape so

253
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:24,880
number five my number six must-have for

254
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:27,520
sustainable garden in florida

255
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,360
is definitely going to be katuk katuk is

256
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:31,039
an awesome perennial vegetable

257
00:07:29,360 --> 00:07:32,720
super high in protein very similar to

258
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:35,440
like moringa where it's like 20

259
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:38,080
protein um and it tastes delicious it

260
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,759
literally tastes like raw peas so

261
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:42,080
it's one that really has a nice flavor

262
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,520
raw kids like everybody i've given this

263
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:44,319
one to they're like wow that tasted

264
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,080
pretty good

265
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:48,240
i have a variegated variety and a green

266
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,000
variety they both thrive on neglect

267
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,680
these plants never get watered these

268
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,080
plants never get fertilized

269
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,680
there is no irrigation here and they

270
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:56,720
live and they thrive on neglect all year

271
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,360
long so

272
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,360
with a lot of these perennial vegetables

273
00:07:59,360 --> 00:08:04,160
the sisu spinach the moringa

274
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:05,680
the katuk that young growth that new

275
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:07,360
growth that's coming off the top is

276
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,560
going to be the most tender the softest

277
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:11,039
so

278
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,039
as i work my way down the plant like

279
00:08:11,039 --> 00:08:14,400
these bottom leaves

280
00:08:13,039 --> 00:08:15,680
these are going to be a little tougher

281
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:16,560
they're still great to eat they can

282
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:18,160
still go in a dish

283
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:19,680
probably better in a cooked dish because

284
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,840
they'll break them down a little bit

285
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:23,440
but for eating fresh i find the raw tips

286
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:26,639
are always best so

287
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:28,240
katuk grow it my number six fruit crop

288
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:28,879
to grow here in florida which probably

289
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:31,360
would not be

290
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,880
typically looked at as like a vegetable

291
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,719
um is papaya

292
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,640
so papaya was something that i really

293
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,240
enjoyed with spending time with rob it's

294
00:08:36,640 --> 00:08:40,479
something he commonly made in his dishes

295
00:08:38,240 --> 00:08:43,279
i think my favorite was his uh

296
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:45,360
thai coconut curry with the papaya in it

297
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,959
but i personally love green papaya i

298
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:49,440
think it's great as a vegetable

299
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,680
i love papaya salad at a thai restaurant

300
00:08:49,440 --> 00:08:53,760
and i love the flavor of a good

301
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,360
ripe papaya as a fruit so you know

302
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:56,959
papayas don't have to be eaten ripe they

303
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,000
can be eaten green like a vegetable

304
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,320
you know we're starting to get some

305
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:00,720
little papayas here and you can get

306
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,480
these

307
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:04,080
while they get larger and they're green

308
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:05,760
or you can wait until they get ripe and

309
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,519
actually eat it as a

310
00:09:05,760 --> 00:09:09,279
vegetable this one doesn't have a lot of

311
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,720
fruit on it right now the other ones i

312
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:12,720
have are tall and i need to cut them

313
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
back you can cut your papayas back every

314
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:15,839
couple of years

315
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,920
one of my mentors the guy i feature a

316
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:19,920
lot on my channel is jim kovaleski

317
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:21,440
he's got a papaya tree in his front yard

318
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:23,360
that's like five or six years old so

319
00:09:21,440 --> 00:09:25,120
these trees can last a while

320
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
they can be perennial they could die

321
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,680
back if you're further north but you

322
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
could start them in your greenhouse and

323
00:09:27,680 --> 00:09:30,399
get them outside you know

324
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:32,080
right after that last frost and

325
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,120
potentially get a green fruit in like

326
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:35,279
six months so

327
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:37,120
papayas are definitely worth growing you

328
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:38,480
know find a good one grow the seed out

329
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,120
really easy to get started

330
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,800
highly suggest growing it number seven

331
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,399
i've been really busy the last couple of

332
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:46,080
weeks with the nursery business and all

333
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:47,519
of my plants out in the ground for these

334
00:09:46,080 --> 00:09:48,959
last three have been cut down for

335
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:50,320
cuttings and propagation

336
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,839
so i'm over here in the nursery where i

337
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,200
have some better examples and the one i

338
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:55,200
want to talk to you about now

339
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:57,120
is edible leaf hibiscus and that's this

340
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:59,680
big leaf plant right here behind me

341
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:00,320
and this can be used as a wrap you can

342
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,399
eat in raw

343
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:06,240
chopped up in a salad be used as a green

344
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,760
and this is one that might be a little

345
00:10:06,240 --> 00:10:08,079
bit more on the muse analogous side

346
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
tight

347
00:10:08,079 --> 00:10:11,839
you know maybe slightly slimy some would

348
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:13,360
say that's really good that's good for

349
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:15,200
lining our insides

350
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,120
this variety is actually less slimy than

351
00:10:15,200 --> 00:10:18,079
the variety i have over here on this

352
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:19,279
side

353
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:20,959
this one definitely has a little bit

354
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,640
more of the muce analogous to it i have

355
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,560
a couple different varieties

356
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,839
i have a skinny leaf variety i have this

357
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:27,120
fat leaf variety

358
00:10:25,839 --> 00:10:28,560
and there's a couple of different common

359
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:29,360
names for this one i really like to just

360
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:31,200
call it

361
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,040
lettuce leaf hibiscus i really like this

362
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:35,040
one as a wrap so you know you wanted a

363
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:36,800
green wrap something that's gluten free

364
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,560
you can grow this for your wrap the

365
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,320
number nine must-have for the

366
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,399
sustainable garden in florida

367
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,160
this is one that the kids really like

368
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:44,959
cranberry hibiscus the leaves are

369
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:46,880
beautiful

370
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,720
nice deep red some people call that like

371
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,959
a mahogany

372
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:52,880
and these are sweet they're sour they're

373
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,240
delicious just raw they go nice in a

374
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:55,600
salad you can chop them up

375
00:10:54,240 --> 00:10:56,959
my favorite thing to do is like if i'm

376
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,920
making a sandwich or i'm packing

377
00:10:56,959 --> 00:10:59,600
something for the day

378
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:01,279
i'm gonna be on the road i come out and

379
00:10:59,600 --> 00:11:02,720
i get a handful of fresh leaves

380
00:11:01,279 --> 00:11:05,920
and just like i talked about with the

381
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:07,519
katuk you know the younger leaves

382
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:08,959
the fresh growth like so this is a

383
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,519
really fresh red one

384
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:12,560
and you can see this is an older leaf

385
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:14,320
you can see a color

386
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:17,360
difference you see how that one's pale

387
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:17,360
that one's dark red

388
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,240
so the younger growth is always going to

389
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,839
be the most tender and the sweetest

390
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,279
nothing wrong with gold growth it's just

391
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:27,920
not going to be the best

392
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,440
flavor-wise so cranberry hibiscus is not

393
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,120
only just a stunner in the landscape

394
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:33,279
it's a pretty looking plant

395
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:34,399
has a really nice edible factor and i

396
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:36,320
guarantee if you give it to one of the

397
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,680
kids they're going to enjoy it too so

398
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,320
this one's definitely been perennial

399
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,680
here it will set flowers all hibiscuses

400
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:42,640
have edible flowers so you can eat the

401
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:44,000
flour on this

402
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:45,279
but after it's done setting the flour

403
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:46,640
it's going to set seed that you could

404
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:48,079
save to replant if you're in a more

405
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:49,839
northern type climate so

406
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:51,519
cranberry hibiscus is definitely another

407
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:53,200
must-have i think if you're

408
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:54,959
in gardening down here in florida and

409
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:55,600
you don't have it this is one to add to

410
00:11:54,959 --> 00:11:58,079
your system

411
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,760
last but not least must-have perennial

412
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:00,639
for sustainable garden down here in

413
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,480
florida

414
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:04,880
um or in any type of sub-tropical

415
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,560
climate would be okinawan spinach and

416
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,160
this is one that we've been propagating

417
00:12:06,560 --> 00:12:09,839
really hard the last few weeks

418
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:11,200
this is also one that the squirrels like

419
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,320
here that i have a hard time keeping

420
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:14,880
going in the beds

421
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,560
but i really like the flavor of it um

422
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,399
it's really nice to eat raw it's nice to

423
00:12:16,560 --> 00:12:20,240
eat cooked it's nice to put in a dish

424
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,399
and it's very similar to the longevity

425
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:24,959
spinach which is right here behind me

426
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:26,480
but i think the longevity spinach is um

427
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:27,839
a little bit stronger a little bit more

428
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,600
of like a medicine

429
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,160
um the squirrels don't like it as much

430
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:33,519
so it definitely grows here a lot better

431
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:34,959
i've noticed that you know we plant

432
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,000
these two for clients all the time

433
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,480
longevity spinach

434
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:40,000
okinawan spinach and the okinawan's a

435
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,839
little prettier it's got some purplish

436
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,680
red to the underside of the leaves

437
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:45,200
um it's hit or miss sometimes the

438
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:46,720
okanagan does better on your site

439
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:48,639
sometimes the longevity does better on

440
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:50,800
your site so i would say both of these

441
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:52,639
are kind of like a tie for number 10

442
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,720
but this one tastes a little better so i

443
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:56,480
