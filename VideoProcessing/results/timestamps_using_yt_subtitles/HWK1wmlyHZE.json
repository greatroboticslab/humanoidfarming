  "text": "[Music] greetings to all welcome to another enlightening video on organic farming practices we're excited that you're here here with us as we explore the captivating world of guava cultivation guava is not only a widely grown fruit but also cherished for its nutritional value and sweet taste this video will provide you with a comprehensive look at how guavas are meticulously cultivated to ensure top-notch [Music] quality Our Journey Begins at the guava sprouts garden in changua County Taiwan where the initial stages of guava cultivation occur the process starts by selecting robust guava Sprouts which are then carefully planted to ensure they are firmly rooted in the soil a crucial step for their early growth and development once the Sprouts reach about 1 month old they are ready to be transplanted into Farm Fields where the real work starts each Sprout is planted with Precision maintaining a recommended spacing of 1 to 1.5 M between trees this spacing is vital as it allows each tree ample room to grow and access necessary nutrients without competing with neighboring [Music] trees after planting the guava trees receive water through a drip irrigation system which ensures that each tree gets an adequate amount of water delivered directly to its roots this efficient method conserves water while providing essential hydration for growth water for irrigation comes from nearby pumps and undergos filtration before use to remove impurities that could harm the plants nutrients may also be added to support healthy tree development as the guava trees mature regular maintenance like trimming is required particularly when they reach around 4 months old to promote better growth by focusing nutrients on fruit development rather than excess foliage trimming also enhances air circulation within the tree reducing disease risk and encouraging healthier growth additionally grass around the trees is regularly removed to prevent nutrient competition and keep the plant Plantation clean and pest [Music] free one critical stage in guava cultivation is preparing for fruiting when Farmers start wrapping individual guavas on each branch after cutting Branch tops to direct nutrients towards fruit production ensuring large sweet fruits characteristic of highquality pearl quavas interestingly only one fruit per branch is allowed following a selective process common in Japan known for yielding superior quality fruits the wrapped fruits are protected from Birds insects rain and excessive sun exposure using nylon bags that create a controlled environment for consistent highquality product development over approximately 1.5 months until ripening especially crucial during rainy Summers when unwrapped fruits can easily [Music] [Applause] [Music] perish while waiting for ripening branches undergo periodic pruning maintaining tree Health promoting better yield and focusing nutrients on developing fruits approaching Harvest sweetness is checked ensuring Readiness using specific techniques guaranteeing only the sweetest and most mature are harvested meeting consumer taste and texture expectations once the desired sweetness is achieved the anticipated Harvest is conducted carefully avoiding damage scissors are used to cut placing gently in trays preventing bruising post Harvest stems are removed followed by thorough washing to clean and remove residues accumulated during growing the fruits are then neatly arranged in trays and wrapped with shock absorbing foam protecting them during transportation to reach the market in perfect condition finally they are packaged loaded onto trucks transported to distribution centers at various locations and sold to Consumers marking the end of the journey from Farm to Market enjoy by pe enjoyed people appreciating their sweet delicious flavor [Music] we will take you next into taiwan's bustling streets witnessing impressive guava cutting skills a true art form in Taiwanese street food culture watching talented vendors skillfully cut and peel fresh guava was transforming them into bite-sized pieces ready to serve eager customers traditional techniques highlight unique preparation and presentation whether you're a food Enthusiast or curious about street food globally this demonstration is sure to Captivate and Inspire don't miss this fascinating glimpse into a vibrant scene [Music] thank you for watching the video on organic guava cultivation technology we hope you found an informative and enjoyed learning about the process of farming and harvesting stay tuned for more videos on practices and techniques until then goodbye and see you next time don't forget to like And subscribe to the channel channel for more exciting documentaries thank you for watching and see you next time [Music]",
