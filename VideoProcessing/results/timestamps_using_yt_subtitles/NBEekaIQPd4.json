  "text": "[Music] my name is Angela Fraley I'm an agent associate at the University of Maryland here with my colleague Carol Allen who is the other agent associate at the University of Maryland and we are both food safety educators so our job is to provide all the growers in Maryland the education that you guys need and want and the technical assistance that you also need to be able to navigate these murky waters of food safety both in audits and in the federal regulations so today hopefully I'm going to be demystifying some parts of this and giving you some updates from the work that the Maryland Department of Ag and we have done in the last year to get you ready for the produce safety rule so has anyone gone through a third party audit process in this room one got a GAAP certification couple okay a couple coughs education has anyone had a PSR inspection this year from MDA okay is anyone a little bit confused about how those two things are different the PSR and the gap okay good good all right well not we're hopefully I will give you tips and tricks to try and negotiate both of those things and it is kind of hard to think about what the differences are between the two because at their core they try and get at one they try and address one issue right so both of them outline practices for you to minimize the microbial hazards on your farm but there are a lot of differences between the two one is a voluntary process that you could undergo and one is a federal regulation so in this talk we're going to start with kind of looking at the differences between the two then I'm gonna get a little bit into how to negotiate the audit process if you are interested in getting a GAAP certification this year then we're going to transition and talk about what's been going on in terms of the produce safety rule this year how we're getting farmers ready what we're seeing on the ground in Maryland and just as to let you guys know you they're doing really well so far MDA is really pleased with how farmers in Maryland are farming and how they're getting ready for the produce safety rule so both of them require similar things they both outline different ways to minimize microbial hazards on the farm and they're focused on the farm elements that we know affect your product quality and safety the most so that's all the workers that interact with your product that's the water that you use to irrigate your product and wash your product and cool your product if so that's also any soil amendments that you're using on the farm that's how you clean and sanitize the tools that you have on the farm and the equipment that you have on the farm and it also outlines practices for how to deal with wildlife and other animals on the farm because we know that all of those things are really important in terms of your your finished product quality and safety and so you might be thinking in your seat right now okay well if they both do most of the same things why do we need both or why do we need either so why would you need either right having a formalized food safety plan and food safety culture on your farm is not only helpful to minimize those microbial risks but it also opens up market access for you guys if you formalize the plan and get a GAAP certification and then furthermore we do know that a lot of the practices that we do from food safety on the farm are also really good horticultural practices too so they also not only minimize your microbial human pathogen risk but also in some cases plant pathogen risk as well so it's always good to double dip now why both so as I had mentioned before the gap program is a voluntary program the FISMA PSR is a mandatory program buyers right now are only focused on the gap program because that's the only thing that gives you a paper certificate that a buyer can see and it's very unlikely in the next few years that buyers are going to go with anything food safety without a paper certificate attached to it right so the GAAP certifications are the only thing that's going to give you a a paper assurance that you can hand to a buyer and that allows you to open up market access to different buyers but it's also why both is also important because if you do gaps and you follow good agricultural practices you get you get a third party audit it's very likely that you're well on your way to getting ready for the produce safety rule so we like to say that the GAAP certification is like a stepping stone to the produce safety rule and in some cases depending on what sort of GAAP audit you want to target if you are following all of those all those standards in that particular gap audit you're actually already completely aligned with the produce safety rules so when you can double dip please do so because we don't want you to duplicate efforts in any way so a little bit into how they're different this is only going to touch on a few things of how they're different if you are interested in reading how the GAAP audits and the produce safety rule inspections are really different University of Maryland extension and the agricultural law education initiative came up with this really great handout that goes into a lot of detail into the differences in the similarities they're available I have them here I'll have them in the back table across the wall over here if you would like to take and read some more they're also available online because there are a lot of links associated with this table as well but as I mentioned before number one the gap audit program is a voluntary program dictated by what your buyer market wants and the produce safety rule is mandatory under the produce safety rule also a Maryland Department of Ag is rolling out a registration for growers so every grower in the state of Maryland is going to have to register with the Maryland Department of Ag and that's just so the Maryland Department of Ag can kind of figure out where they need to put you in terms of when you're gonna be inspected in the produce safety rules so if you're a grower that's growing under five hundred thousand dollars worth of produce you're going to be inspected either this year or the next year but if you're a grower who it has not been inspected yet and is growing over five hundred thousand dollars with the produce once you get registered you're going to be put up in the priority list for an MDA inspection and not scary at all we'll get into them at the at the end of this at the end of this at the end of this talk so covered produce so again because the GAAP audit is a voluntary program you dictate to the auditor what sort of products you want gap certified so if you are a farmer and you have apples and you have kale for pick-your-own and then you have sweet corn you can choose to just get a gap audit and a gap certification just for the apples so that the auditor only goes out and takes a look at what the practices are with your apples that's different from the produce safety rule the produce safety rule MDA inspector is going to come out and take a look at your practices that pertain to all the crops that are eaten raw on your on your property so in that same example of having apples and kale and sweet corn they're gonna look at the apples and the kale because both of those are eaten raw and they're not going to be as they're not going to look at your practices regarding sweet corn so exemptions to this rule the next part down here under the voluntary program you can be exempt based on what your buyer what your buyer requirements are so there I know I do know some buyers in some grocery stores will allow you to start selling to them if you don't have an audit yet but with a written assurance that you're going to get an audit in the next year so so you could kind of work with your buyer on the expectations they have with you exemptions on the produce safety rule because this is a federal regulation the exemptions are real complicated and real murky and every single one of them has a record associated with it so I'm gonna just briefly talk about it here but if you think that you might be exempt or if you think that you might be qualified exempt to talk to me after this talk or we could talk to Carol as well so if you're a farm that's growing under 27,000 dollars worth of produce a year you can be exempt and there is a registration associated with each one of these right so there's registration associated with if you're growing under twenty seven thousand five hundred and twenty eight dollars of produce it's adjusted for inflation each year which is our job to keep up on so we can let you know if you if all the produce on your farm is all going to further there's a specific exemption for that so let us know if you're growing all you're growing is spinach and it's getting canned let us know we can direct you to the right registration form to fill out for that the last one is if everything you're growing on your farm is just as not eaten raw so if you're just doing a whole farm full of winter squash for some reason then you can be that crop is rarely eaten raw and there's another potential exemption that you can apply for for that okay so those are the exemptions if you are a farmer that may find yourself in the category of selling between twenty seven thousand dollars a year in produce and five hundred and fifty five hundred and fifty one thousand dollars 550 550 one yeah mmm-hmm that that one is important so if you're between twenty seven and five hundred and fifty then you could potentially be under a qualified exemption that you could apply for a qualified exemption so in addition to your produce sales if you're in that bracket you're going to also want to roll in any other food sales that you have so that involves any livestock that you're selling any jams or jellies that you're selling as well so you roll in all the other food that you're selling and who that food is being sold to so it gets very complicated we're not going to go into it at this talk but if you think that you are between 27 and 550 of produce and you think you want to apply for a qualified exemption then come talk to me afterwards we'll get you all situated basically what you're going to have to do is keep sales records of all the food you're selling and who you're selling it to to maintain to MDA that you are still within this structure to be qualified exempt and you'll have to keep those records for three years okay or you can just choose to be fully covered and you will be in the bank of farms that MDA will come out and inspect if you don't want to go through all that all that record-keeping you can choose to do that as I mentioned before with with the voluntary audit you are gonna get a paper certificate of compliance and this is what buyers really like to see and there's no sort of paper certificate of compliance associated with a PSR inspection other general differences if anyone's familiar who is familiar with the food safety plan who has written a food safety plan okay cool all right okay so for your GAAP audits you have to have a written food safety plan that an auditor will come and take a look at what sort of practices policies and procedures you have in place on your farm and for the produce safety rule it's not really required to do that but it's recommended because it just keeps everybody more organized and it keeps the inspector on your farm for a shorter amount of time if you have everything organized into a written plan for trace back and recall some of the audits outline that you should have a trace back and recall plan so this means that you have a lot system for your products and you know you can trace it back from where it was in the field and trace it forward to where it's going to specific buyers so some audits require that the MDA gap audit does not which is the baseline type of audit that you can get it's it this is also not required for the produce safety rule unless you're doing some on-farm processing like making ciders or jams or jellies or something like that the record-keeping is various between the two there are six required records for the produce safety rule and we'll get into what is needed on those records in a little bit and when we get there I would recommend that everybody take a look and just add the things that are required for the produce safety rule on whatever record that you are already doing so that you don't have to create two records for the same thing right there are some easy ways that you can comply with the produce safety rule with things that you already have and then just kind of rounding us out the produce safety rule is just focused on microbial hazards it doesn't talk about chemical and physical hazards however in audits you're going to have to want to keep a record of the pesticide applicator license and other Burbidge about how you're mitigating chemical and physical hazards okay so into the different gap audits that you can pursue if you would like to depending on if you want to open up market access to different buyers and different wholesale opportunities they range from less intensive to most intensive and the different the intensity of the audit kind of just goes with how many more paper records you're gonna have to keep the practices are very very similar among all of these as I had mentioned before they all outline practices around workers fertilizer water quality maintaining and testing water quality your cleaning and sanitizing schedules for your tools equipments and your building how you're inspecting different trucks that are coming onto your property to haul produce temperature controls and monitoring for animals so if you have not done a gap audit before and you would like to get into this world of gap audits I would really recommend starting with an MDA gap it requires the least amount of records in the least amount of time to get you started it's very likely that you're already doing most of these practices that is outlined in an MDA gap audit you just got to write it all down in a way that an auditor can take a look at and give you a passing grade on right and there's also some records required to it getting getting used to starting to put records together is is a bit of a hurdle but once your rips once your started with records it's a lot easier to keep going with record-keeping if you're interested in some of these more intense audits they're going to include different parts and a produce safety and a produce safety plan some of them require written risk assessments so how you know when you're going out to a field it's ready for harvest some of those audits require a record associated with I know my field is now ready for harvest again it's things that you're already doing the auditor just wants it in paper form now which is quite laborious I definitely understand that they also want things outlined like different defense plans corrective action plans so again something that you're probably already doing you probably already have a plan in place for if a port-a-potty falls over or if you see a worker who is just not washing their hands ever right what the plan in place is that you're going to go over to that person and retrain them right and in these different audits they're there in these more intense audits they're just asking that that's written down and formalized in paragraph form which Carol and I can help you do if you are interested in getting an audit so MDA can come out and perform any of these audits here there they're not going to come out and perform the global gap on it but MDA can come out and perform all these audits and in 20 the twenty twenty year is a good time to get an audit done because a lot of those because of MDA has found funds for them to be either free or for you to get reimbursed so the MDA gap on it is free if you'd like to get an H gap on it there's 100% reimbursement on that audit so it's also free you can get cost share for any group cat op group gap audits you're looking to get and if you are interested in the harmonized gaps there is a reimbursement for the first four hundred dollars of certification and seventy-five percent of costs over four hundred dollars so this year is a good year to pursue this because I'm not sure if these funds are going to be available in next year's so now is the time to do it um the stars over here go to the fact that some of these audits are fully aligned with the produce safety rule meaning that if you're completing all of these things for this particular audit you're also aligned for everything underneath the produce safety rule and then also for those bigger farmers if you are selling to a larger grocery store like Wegmans or Walmart or if you would like to sell internationally there are audits that MDA can perform for you that are global GFCI equivalent global food safety initiative equivalent so that's available to you alright so if you're sitting in your seat and you're saying okay this is all well and good but I don't know what the steps to actually get this done are the first thing that you're going to need to do is designate it be someone's job on the farm to be a food safety officer and that person is going to be record man number one unfortunately or fortunately if they like records right so and then we you go to a food safety training you have that appointed person go to a food safety training there are multiple throughout the state of Maryland that we're doing this year we do them every winter however if we get a quorum of farmers who are like we would like a gap class in the fall we would also hold one in the fall it's based on availability and interest so you'll go to a food safety training you'll start writing down the guts of your food safety plans as I mentioned before these are all your written policies they're gonna be your records they're gonna be any SOPs that you have and they're gonna be any risk assessments that you're making and any plans that you have in place in case things go wrong so that is all included in the guts of a food safety plan you'll keep things like your pesticide applicator license in there you'll keep things like your water testing report in there risk assessments as I had said before then what you're going to want to do is start trying to see how what you wrote down is actually aligning with the practices you do on your farm because auditors will the audit goes off of based what you're writing down that you're saying so if you're writing it down you should do it and if it's something that you're not doing on your farm don't write it down because that's a way that an auditor will ding you right they've grade you off based off of what you're saying you're doing it's also a good idea to have a day where you're a mock auditor yourself and you go out to your workers and you see if they're following the practices that you're you wrote down that you said you're doing and it gives you a little bit of an opportunity to kind of self evaluate and augment the plan or your records or anything before an auditor comes and then you want to schedule and pass a third party on it when can you call Carroll or myself to help you through this you can call us during almost every single part of the process we cannot be the auditor for you unfortunately we would love to be but if you have any questions about how to develop SOPs if you want second eyes reviewing a food safety plan if you're not sure how to write a food safety plan please get up with us we can definitely help you because it's having a written food safety plan is a great way to grow your business so you can get a bunch of templates online for food safety plans the MDA has a template food safety plan that's a good plug and chug there's also for those growers who are interested in h gap a more stringent type of gap audit there's a template from the well there's a handbook on how to write your plan from the carolina farm stewardship Association there's also a good plug and chug template from the produce safety Alliance that I can send to Mike and he could send out to people if they're interested that's another really good plug and chug one hmm yeah yeah that's pretty safe do you like well yeah it's Cornell the Cornell gap program yes Thank You Carol as I had mentioned before keep it simple and easy to follow structure it based on what the auditor how the auditor is gonna go through your farm so there are different scopes that are required in each of the the audits and just have your verbage structured exactly like that because you don't want that person on your farm any longer than they need to be use tables liberally like when you don't have to write a paragraph you don't need to you can use a table if it's easier and other sort of conventions like bolding as I mentioned before it's not a wish list so just write down everything that you are doing and things that you're not doing don't write it down and make sure even with these if you're using a plug and chug that you're erasing the things that are not happening on your farm or if they cover a different type of crop you're making sure that it's tailored to the crop that you are writing the plan for so this is a great way it's an example to put verbage in a food safety plan that covers many different phases at once into paragraphs and feel free to take a picture of this I got this from Penn State and it talks about animal control so if you see here they have a couple of elements that I think are really nice all in two paragraphs they have the written policy about what they do for animals we do all that we can to keep up domestic and wild animals out of the fields right so that's a check check mark off that they have a monitoring log they reference a monitoring log in here right we routinely monitor the growing area and the results are recorded in our monitoring log they have because this is off of a more stringent audit this is not often MDA gap audit they have an allusion to a written risk assessment again if you're going for an MD a gap audit this does not need to be in here but they talk about that they include an inspection for the presence of animals during your pre harvest risk assessment and then they also outline the plan that they're going to enact in case something other than something non normal happens so if they find significant evidence of poop in the field they outline that what they do is mark off the area with a buffer and they don't harvest crop within that buffer and it's removed so this is a really efficient way to get all of the elements of a food safety plan in paragraph form and I would really recommend working off this template because it's it's just the easiest way to do it and care a lot Carol and I have experience in this it can help you help you move through this kind of on records as I mentioned before take a look at all the records that you have right now and we would recommend just making them produce safety rule compliant and to make them produce safety rule compliant you're just going to have to add a couple of these little elements here you're going to want to add on all of your records the name and address of your farm all the records have to be done at the dated at the exact time that they're done the date is sufficient they also go to in in different things like cleaning and sanitizing produce safety rule records want you to outline what methods you're using so you in this example it is writing out what the method is but we all know we don't have time for that so what you can do instead is you could reference an SOP up top here and you could just reference like everyone was trained in this specific way to clean and sanitize things reference the SOP and this could be a check mark you could say clean and sanitizing harvest knives SOP right the other thing that produce safety records need is that they are at the end of the record you know you have your worker signing them and at the end of the record the food safety officer is going to want to review them title them and date them alright so what can Carol and I help you with well we can help you write your food safety plan we can help review your food safety plan we take a look at your practices that you're doing on the farm you can have us out we can take a look and prioritize what different things you're going to want to target for this year and your food safety goals we can help you interpret water test results or get your water testing program started if you haven't already started it and then furthermore we can also help you devise a cleaning and sanitizing program for different tools and equipment on your farm so if you're not sure what things you should be cleaning and sanitizing or how often you should be doing it or how you need to be recording it or if it's effective let us know and we could come out and help you with that there are also a bunch of resources both around the country and in Maryland that you could take advantage of to help you with your food safety goals as I mentioned there's a template for pretty much anything you could ever want there are a lot of signs that we made and some of these signs suffice the recommendation or sorry the requirements for the produce safety rule there's a visitor sign so especially those of you who have picked your owns I would recommend getting one of these signs so this outlines the policies that a visitor should be following when they come to your farm it talks about not picking one stick not bringing their pets not bringing food and drink into the field washing their hands and farm kids safety I think it says on here plants are not toys which I really like so I have these available out here I have like six available and we can order more so they're all free for you for taking if you would like to have one we have other signs as well also we have worker training supplements so the produce safety rule not only wants you to show the Cornell video to have all your workers trained in hygiene but they also want your workers trained in doing their specific jobs so Maryland Department of Ag actually came up with four powerpoints and videos that are in English in Spanish both for harvest training post harvest training working with animals and general food safety so you can show these to your workers and that will suffice the other requirement of training for the produce safety rule and then we can also provide the resource of trail tailored training to your needs that's where the the survey comes in so the our survey is the yellow one in your little booklet we really appreciate if you fill this out this lets us know what types of training topics you would like to have in this area and we're in this area is most convenient for you for us to come train so please fill this out I'll be collecting these at lunchtime all right back with the PSR compliance dates for the produce safety rule so if you're a grower that's growing over 500,000 worth of product expect that the MDA will be calling you soon to get an inspection if you're a grower that is growing between two hundred fifty thousand dollars of product and five hundred thousand dollars a product this year is the year that you're going to be inspected and then small businesses between 25 and 250 you've got till next year again as I mentioned in the top if you think if you're someone that's between 27,000 and $500,000 worth of produce and you think you might want to apply for this exemption I would recommend start keeping sales records now of the food and produce that you're selling and who it's getting sold to because MDA the Maryland Department of Ag is gonna want to take a look at those records next year so what is MDA and Carol and I currently doing to help everybody get ready for the produce safety rule we're holding PSR trainings so the produce safety rule trainings these are a federal requirement that were every food safety officer in a farm goes to one of these trainings we have one coming up in McHenry Maryland which is all the way west so that will be the end of these trainings for this year but let us know if you would like one over here in the late fall we could start doing that for you or when else would be efficient and effective for you guys to get a training we are conducting on-farm readiness reviews so an on-farm readiness review is a confidential program that Maryland Department of Ag and the University of Maryland is doing where we come out to your farm and we take a look at your practices and we can let you know where you're already aligning and things you need to prioritize to align better with the produce safety rule it's completely confidential and we don't take any written notes off of the farm we keep them all with you and on the whole Maryland's been doing real well with these 86% of Maryland farms only needed to have minor changes but before they were completely aligned with the produce safety rule and those minor changes are usually red tape things like the stuff on their records and doing a water distribution assessment writing that down so again a lot of formal things but on the whole you guys are doing really well and we really commend you for keeping food safety in the forefront of your goals as I mentioned before MDA is inspecting the largest farms this year they are only none of these inspections are unannounced they're always gonna call you up unless you are not returning their calls then they might show up but they have not the only thing that they're citing to the FDA are any egregious conditions that they find on the farm and they have not found any egregious conditions in the state of Maryland which is great they are providing you a summary report that's a non-federal document and that's just a report of things that you can work on this next year and that's just for people who are getting inspected what's been happening so I was able to get this information from one of the inspectors Alec lenka from the MDA and he let us know the different things that need some work in general in Maryland for this next year so common observations that he saw when he was out doing produce safety rule inspections is that just to keep in mind we really want you to be aware of all your tools and equipment that our food contact surfaces and we want you to devise cleaning and sanding tips cleaning and sanitizing schedules for those tools and equipment and it doesn't have to be after every use this is at this is a schedule based on what the frequency you determine is so it can be every month it can be once a season it's based on what works for your farm different cleaning procedures we're still feeling seeing a lot of people just spray sanitizer on a dirty belt and just say that that's what their cleaning procedure is and we really want you to follow a four-step process of cleaning with a detergent and then sanitizing and then completely drying the piece of equipment drying is essential we are finding in the research because of microbes we're never there is water present microbes really like to get into that niche and grow so drying whenever possible your equipment is really important soil amendment applications so if you're applying manure to a sweet corn field and you have melons within like 15 feet of that sweet corn field just be aware of the different risks associated with that sweet corn field if there if there is any way that runoff could happen and how you're gonna mitigate potential risk of any runoff as I mentioned before visitor policies and that sign that I have can show you up on this visitor policies thing making sure that we have a plan in place for when wildlife comes on our farm and having workers trained for knowing how to deal with animals on the farm as I mentioned before Maryland Department of Ag on their website has a training that's an English and Spanish for working with animals so I highly suggest getting to that website and showing your workers this from the h gap if you're if you're a grower who wants to get one of the stringent audits for the h gap there are a couple of other things that Alec was noting in his inspections this year again a lot of these some of these are piddly things some of these are red tape things like securing chemical storage makes sure as was said in the last talk whatever sort of sanitizer or pesticide or whatever you're using follow the label instructions that is the most important thing and then you could take a picture of this I think for time I won't be able to go through it all the way but there are some things that you can prioritize that will cover a PSR requirement and a harmonized gap requirement and that is making sure the records have all the required things on them protecting your water source from source to spigot keeping your harvest totes off the ground and I know this is a hard one and research is still diving into the actual risk of harvest totes in contact with soil but if you have the ability to use a sacrificial tote when you're harvesting or if you could put a piece of cardboard underneath the tote that you're using to slide around the ground we really recommend doing that if you can if you're employing any sanitizers for water treatment activities make sure that you're able to monitor monitor the sanitizer with a pH or ppm strip you can get these pH or ppm strips from brewery supply stores or restaurants supply stores I have got one from Amazon and it did not work so I would caution against using the Amazon once and then if you are using a cooler just be aware of what's going on with cooler condensate we want best-case scenario is for the product any product that you have don't store it directly underneath the cooler but if you are storing it directly underneath the cooler I would recommend that you cover it with a plastic sheet or something so we don't have any condensate hitting the product alright so things to think about now we just want to make sure that everybody realized that food safety is an iterative and continue to process continuous you're not going to get all your food safety goals done in one season if you are thinking of where to start we always recommend starting with worker training program because they affect your product quality and safety the most because they're touching it all the time and if you are interested in going to a gap training this year we have a couple of advanced trainings happening March 28th nope February 28th and March 4th and these advanced trainings we're gonna get more in-depth into how to look at your piece of equipment for food safety risks how to develop cleaning and sanitizing schedules and if you're doing any sort of on photo on farm produce processing how to how to know if you're edging into a different type of Food Safety Modernization Act rule if you want more information on how to write your plan we are hosting two basic gap probe workshops where we're going to be actually writing plans so if you think you're ready to do this but you just don't know how to write the thing we've come to one of these programs you'll leave with a plan almost done go ahead and take a picture of this these are references for further reading all of the Maryland registration forms that I talked about are available here and you can talk to Carol or myself to kind of navigate you through which form you need to fill out if you need to fill out one and there are also resources from the produce safety rule as well oh yeah go ahead did you get it okay good and then if you have any questions please reach out to us and I'll take any questions you have great question so they're still trying to figure out how often they're gonna have to come out to give you a an inspection some smaller states are able to come out to their farms once a year it's quite it's gonna be unlikely that MDA is going to be able to come out to you every year I think they're thinking maybe I don't want to give you a number but maybe every three years and it's gonna be based on priority they're thinking too so it won't be an annual thing that's a great question so we hear this a lot the wildlife is a real challenge especially on the Eastern Shore especially with all the deer we have and I think that all the regulator's and the auditors know that we're not going to be able to keep all of the animals outside of an outside space right so this one is mostly a due diligence thing on you it's it's you're writing down that you're trying to monitor for them and you're trying your best to deter them from your production areas but we know that wildlife are an integral and also beneficial part of a farm so we're not trying to give you a prescription to get rid of all the deer right and we know that it's a challenge and that's kind of one of those things where you do your best and you write down what you're doing and that's all you can do two three four clapping that's exactly right yeah and I just think yeah wildlife will always be a challenge and it's a good thing that the MDA auditors and inspectors they know that so they're not they're not as persnickety as someone else in Rhode Island would be unfortunately fortunately if you went to choose one yeah that's a great question so the question was which animals should we mitigate for most right should it be the deer should it be the geese and I think you can think about this two ways you can think about it as what sort of animals you most likely see and how many of that sort of animal do you most likely see so if you notice from your monitoring because you're just looking at your you're looking at your production area all the time you notice that deer is the biggest problem then you're going to want to try your best to control for deer if you know that you've got a flock of geese and a flock of deer it's kind of down to like well who's the bigger problem who goes into the field more often then I would prioritize that way it's just doing your best they're animals they're out there we're not going to keep them from our delicious food you know are we are we seeing any feral pigs nope okay well let's hope not you're gonna want to have to do something you know you can do something you could bury it you could just flag it you could remove it the the buffer is up to you you it doesn't have to be three feet it doesn't what you can say that but then what you're gonna want to do is follow up that your workers know not to pick it in subsequent picks like if they go into the field again so you can write down and that's where the kinds of flexibility comes into play you can write down whatever works for your farms just as long as you can like back it up with worker trainings right and in that instance someone will ask a worker be like how do you know if you're coming into this field a second time what to pick and what not to pick right and if they know and if they can tell the inspector like oh I know then you're golden makes sense okay thank you [Music]",
