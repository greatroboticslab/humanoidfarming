2
00:00:11,000 --> 00:00:15,799
you are at fickle Creek Farm in effland

3
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,600
North Carolina which is in Orange County

4
00:00:15,799 --> 00:00:20,600
right in the center of the pedmont

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:24,519
region of North Carolina and we describe

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:27,480
pickle Creek Farm as a small scale

7
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:30,080
Diversified sustainable farm this farm

8
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:32,719
right here is 61 Acres that's kind of

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,719
the the size of it the sustainability

10
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:40,280
part comes in with our practices we are

11
00:00:35,719 --> 00:00:42,920
trying to produce food at the same time

12
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:45,120
that we protect the environment and

13
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,399
bring in minimal inputs from the

14
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:53,039
outside and that's always a challenge

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:56,320
the produce we we grow is completely by

16
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:59,440
organic standards and practices however

17
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,519
we've chosen to not get certified

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:03,559
because

19
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,280
sometimes the what I call technically

20
00:01:03,559 --> 00:01:09,560
organic but not sustainable option just

21
00:01:06,280 --> 00:01:12,240
doesn't make sense we've decided to use

22
00:01:09,560 --> 00:01:14,360
locally milled feed for example the

23
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,520
reason for that is to get the certified

24
00:01:14,360 --> 00:01:19,600
organic feed that we had available at

25
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,880
the time it came from a much longer

26
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:25,240
distance we sell retail direct we do

27
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,159
very little wholesale so it's not like

28
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:29,479
our product is on a shelf somewhere and

29
00:01:27,159 --> 00:01:31,520
the only thing the consumer has to go by

30
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,759
is the the stamp on it that says

31
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:37,399
certified organic we're very lucky in

32
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:39,920
that we have a customer base that really

33
00:01:37,399 --> 00:01:42,479
supports us they come out to the markets

34
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,280
and rain or shine um they appreciate

35
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,320
what we're doing and how we're doing it

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:48,200
but that helps financially of course but

37
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,280
that also gets us into kind of

38
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,079
communally sustainable the farmer and

39
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,119
the Farm Workers have to make a living

40
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,320
along the way too so it has to be

41
00:01:55,119 --> 00:02:01,520
sustainable for the farmer

42
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:04,520
first this Farm is what I would call a

43
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:07,799
Agro forestry system a definition for

44
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:11,200
Agro forestry the inclusion of a Woody

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:14,440
perennial component in a farming system

46
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:17,440
meant to produce livestock and or

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:20,760
produce so our trees just like our

48
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:23,800
livestock we look at in two ways they

49
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:26,480
have service benefits and they have

50
00:02:23,800 --> 00:02:27,920
product benefits so examples that we get

51
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:31,319
from the trees are

52
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:33,959
shade um improved as Aesthetics erosion

53
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,000
control the trees are doing doing a lot

54
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:38,400
of things that aren't necessarily

55
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:41,040
monetary income but they they are

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:44,680
important services to be sustainable and

57
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,599
to be an enjoyable place to to farm we

58
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:50,080
heat our home with firewood and so

59
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,239
firewood is an actual product so there

60
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:55,560
are products as well from the trees by

61
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,280
having not only our crops and our

62
00:02:55,560 --> 00:03:01,040
pastures but then completely natural

63
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:05,519
forested areas are biodiversity is much

64
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:05,519
much higher than most agricultural

65
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:12,360
systems the livestock that we have

66
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:15,400
brought to the farm and that we have now

67
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:18,159
all got here because we were trying to

68
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:20,239
to meet a need of the farm

69
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,200
sustainability chickens for example we

70
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,519
started with laying hands and yes we

71
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,599
want needed the income but we also

72
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:31,080
needed the fertilizer that they were

73
00:03:28,599 --> 00:03:32,799
producing and so not only did they

74
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:34,879
produce the fertilizer but they spread

75
00:03:32,799 --> 00:03:36,560
it and Incorporated it for us the

76
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:39,159
chickens are really good for insect

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,239
control as well so we'll and weed seed

78
00:03:39,159 --> 00:03:43,879
control all of those are again our

79
00:03:41,239 --> 00:03:43,879
services

80
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,519
first then I think we got pigs next

81
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:52,799
their service at at the very outset was

82
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:54,439
to eradicate noxious weeds that we

83
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,480
couldn't get rid of any other way

84
00:03:54,439 --> 00:03:57,519
because of course we don't use

85
00:03:55,480 --> 00:03:59,239
herbicides and then we found out just

86
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
serendipitously that they're also great

87
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,720
for ra amazing Rock from pastures and

88
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:04,159
they bring them to the surface and then

89
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:06,879
we can just go out and collect them much

90
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:09,200
more readily they are great for

91
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,400
understory clearing so we'll take a

92
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,319
managed small wood lot area and we'll

93
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:16,160
put pigs in it and they'll clear it the

94
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,600
understory for us so then we can get in

95
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:21,160
to do the thinning that we want to do

96
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:26,199
now what we do as part of our standard

97
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:29,960
procedure is to clear a a paddock that

98
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:32,400
has um produce in it with sheep so they

99
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,440
eat all the vegetation the remnants of

100
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:37,800
of a crop then we bring in chickens

101
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,000
typically and they eat down even further

102
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,960
and they eat weed seeds and

103
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:44,800
scratch and then um finally we bring in

104
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,360
the Ducks and they just go right down

105
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,080
the rows just like kind of shoveling

106
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:53,560
along with their their beaks and the

107
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:56,680
Slugs are gone so and and of course

108
00:04:53,560 --> 00:04:57,919
again they produce um eggs so they're

109
00:04:56,680 --> 00:05:00,639
paying for

110
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:03,240
themselves we're at the very top of K

111
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,280
Creek Watershed which is the water for

112
00:05:03,240 --> 00:05:07,280
Carbone Chapel Hill this Farm is a farm

113
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:09,600
conservation

114
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,800
eent and that means we sold our

115
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:13,639
development

116
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,400
rights um so there will never be

117
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:16,840
development on this property beyond what

118
00:05:15,400 --> 00:05:19,360
is here

119
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:22,440
now you've probably heard many times

120
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,840
farming is really hard work and it is I

121
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:27,440
do feel like we're just one of many

122
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,400
farms in this area that are farming

123
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:34,039
along these lines and and we do make a

124
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:34,039
significant

125
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:42,160
impact
