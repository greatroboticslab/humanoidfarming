  "text": "I'm here with Steve the owner sprinkler where how he's about to tell us how we run wire to our sprinkler systems [Music] what kind of why are we running today Steve where we're gonna be running direct burial irrigation wire today it's 16 gauge wire and it's made for direct burials so we do not have to worry about running conduit all the way back to the controller we can just run the wire in the ground in the same trenches as the pipe and we'll just tuck the wire up underneath the pipe just to protect it from any shovels in the future or anything like that the best we can we'll tuck it up underneath but again we don't have to worry about running conduit because we are using wire that's that's designed for direct burial out here in the yard we're gonna be running our wire from the controller in this situation it's in the backyard in the garage we're gonna be coming from that controller around the back of the property down the side of the house and then across the front over here to our furthest bowels away from the controller so starting here we need to make sure that we've got a red wire or a hot wire for each valve in this case we've got three valves so we're gonna have three red wires but you only need one common that's it not ten yes can you change yeah daisy chain we would normally run the wire straight from these valves all the way back to the controller and tucking the wire underneath the pipe to protect it but we got to be careful I always advise people walk the property back to the controller and make sure you're not going to cross any obstacles that would prevent you from running the wire in this case as as we've been discussing here and you can see we've got a sidewalk to deal with we've gone under it earlier with a piece of conduit so that we prepared ourselves to go into this with wire so instead of starting here and rolling our rolls back we're gonna start here bring the wire underneath in the conduit over to the valves hook up the valves and finish running the wire around the side of the house to the backyard after we've done these we'll start over here on these valves we'll run our two red wires all the way back to the controller again and then we'll finish up with our valves that are in the backyard and do the same thing all right now I've pulled the wire down to the valve I'm gonna tuck it in underneath the pipe and I'm gonna leave about two and a half feet of coil because you want to have about two and a half extra feet to coil up for to protect for surges all right so this right here is a little coil and we're gonna make one on the rest of these wires now what this does is as it adds a little bit of a extra protection against power surges so we're gonna take a little pipe like this unwrap our cabling we're gonna go ahead and leave some slack right there we're gonna wrap it around right down here like this boom coil then you do that to all of them just took a little extra down start your [Music] to see how we're just jump [Music] [Music] so he goes from this one to that one we have our control [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] and don't forget your waterproof wire nuts [Music] [Music] take the white wire only and I'm gonna pull white wire I need you to let the roll or white wire [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] now in order to protect your wires from damage you're gonna want to run it through some PVC conduit from where it comes out of the ground all the way to your smart control [Music] and you don't good there's no water [Music] [Music] alright now we got all the wires running to our controller we have our rain sensor wire right here we're gonna hook that up we got our common wire we're gonna hook that up as well we're gonna turn the power onto this thing and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna strip the red wires one by one and we're gonna touch them to a powered terminal what that's gonna do is gonna start to isolate which wire goes to which zone because we don't know which wire goes to which is own at this point so if we turn on terminal number one and start touching a wire to it what what's gonna happen is it's gonna turn on one of the zones in our yard let's just say that turns on number seven we count one two three four five six seven connect it to number seven over here and go on down the line until we know which wire goes to which zone and then we connect it to that corresponding zone let's get started okay that's number that's the flower bed so that number six [Music] remember sprinkler warehouse has everything for your irrigation needs so your trees lawn gardens and flower beds are lush and beautiful and if you have any questions about irrigation chat with one of our superb customer service agents on sprinkler warehouse.com they really know their stuff and they will get you squared away subscribe to our YouTube channel for helpful tips tutorials and general sprinkler destruction i'm adrian sanchez your sprinkler warehouse pro I'll see you later irrigator",
