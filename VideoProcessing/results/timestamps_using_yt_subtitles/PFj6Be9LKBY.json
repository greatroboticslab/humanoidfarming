  "text": "[Music] thought we do a little update today on the chickens and how they're doing and the new winter chicken coop so it does smell a little bit in here kind like a vinegary smell I guess I would say so what that's telling me is we need more carbon I'm just going to take some of this hay I have and spread it out and let the ladies go ahead and do their thing [Music] [Music] [Music] so now all you got to do is throw the flakes of hay down and let the girls do the rest of the work [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] they just go into town scratching through it finding all the good stuff out of it right now to eat and they'll spread it around and you kind of got to remember too that these chickens been out on pasture their whole life until they come into this Coupe so all this hay and everything they love it they're going to pick through it and they're going to eat it the best they can they're not just going to use it for bed and they're going to be eating this stuff they've been out having fresh grass their whole life so they really look forward to this free range free choice oyster shells that they can eat so if they need more calcium in the diet they can go get it whenever they want they're making their own dust baths [Music] [Music] it's a little noisy in here right now they're really enjoying the fresh hay I put down for them so we just got 15 chicken eggs so far today there a duck egg over there and another chicken egg over there so we got 16 17 eggs plus one duck egg this morning we've gotten 18 eggs so far today we've been averaging around 20 to 22 a day we only have 24 laying hens been doing pretty darn good I think you'd almost think it's springtime with the amount of eggs you've been getting they're really loving the greenhouse they've been laying really good since they've been in here they love all the fresh hay they get as you can see they scratching through it and going to [Applause] town even the Ducks are loving it now even just since I put this hay down a few minutes ago the smell in here has changed there is no more smell it's kind of like a when you walked in you just kind of felt it hit you in the face it was a little bit of like a vinegary smell you put the hay down down the girls have come in they scratched it all around and moved it and the smell's gone away so the Deep bedding really works if you start smelling a nasty smell or a strong smell of anything all you need to do is add some more carbon in this case we're using hay the girls are loving eating it it's a food source for them they get more fresh greens and it's a good carbon I've just been using the lower nest boxes here upper ones I keep locked up I don't want the girls just hanging out in here during the day and pooping up in here so during the day I keep the lower nest boxes open when I get home from work usually around like 5:00 I'll come in I'll collect my eggs I get my eggs out and then when I'm all done collecting the eggs I just shut it up and then that way at night the girls can't go in there and sleep and poop all over the place that's usually when the nest boxes get really [Music] dirty this right here this hay is the same hay I put in the first time we set up the CPE for it's still clean there's no poop the eggs we're getting out are nice and clean the Ducks love the water they're just going to town they're the ones making the biggest mess over there and and I'm sure that's why we're going through about 50 gallons of water a week [Music] [Applause] [Music] we send our pigs off to the butcher shop a couple of weeks ago we'll be getting those back pretty soon I'm going to be going over how much pork and meat we got back from our pigs how much they weighed and we're going to be doing like a breakdown of what we're getting back to feed all the noise the Ducks are going a little crazy over there in the water yes we're going to be getting all of our meat back from the butcher shop on the pig so I'm going to be going over to you with the feet cost were with the butcher cost were and how much money we have into the food so if you want to check that out don't forget to subscribe so you don't miss it and we'll see you right back here want to say thanks guys for watching you have any questions on the chicken coup or the chickens or anything leave them down in the comments below if you like the video give it a thumbs up we're posting a photo a day over on our Instagram account so go check that out lumni Acres over on Instagram we have a Facebook page we love hearing from you guys so thanks for watching and we'll see you right back here next time at lumni Acres [Music]",
