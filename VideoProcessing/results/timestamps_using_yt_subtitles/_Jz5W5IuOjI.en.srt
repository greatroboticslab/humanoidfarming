1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:03,280
hey everyone i'm here with my friend

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:06,960
eric

3
00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:09,360
and we met two years ago in florida

4
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:10,800
and i was blown away by his knowledge of

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,240
the plants he's been foraging for about

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:14,880
a decade and

7
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,480
he is a plant wizard with really

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,000
seemingly infinite knowledge i know

9
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:19,279
there's things he doesn't know but it

10
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:21,840
seems like he knows

11
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:22,560
pretty much every plant that we cross

12
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:24,000
and so

13
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,000
i've been blessed to get to learn from

14
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,039
him i've been with him for the last day

15
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,760
in maryland and

16
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:30,080
learned so much and so i'm excited he is

17
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:32,160
going

18
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,600
to share some of his favorite plans to

19
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:35,040
help you get foraging and

20
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,120
first he's going to introduce himself a

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:40,960
bit my name is eric i'm a plant lover

22
00:00:38,120 --> 00:00:43,280
permaculturist and an avid forager

23
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:44,399
and i'm just really grateful to be here

24
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
with you all today

25
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,719
and share my top 10 wild edible greens

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,960
for the mid-atlantic

27
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,879
and there's just such an abundance of

28
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:59,840
food in these fields and forests

29
00:00:52,879 --> 00:01:02,160
so let's go see what we can find

30
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:03,039
my number one all-time favorite wild

31
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,640
edible green

32
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,360
has to be urtica dioica or

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,439
the mighty stinging nettle uh there is a

34
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:12,799
native north american species as well

35
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
urtica gracilis

36
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,520
and also la portia canadensis i love it

37
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,799
for so many reasons

38
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:23,200
it offers all kinds of amazing medicine

39
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,360
its flavor is incredible it can be

40
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,360
absolutely prolific in the wild

41
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:29,520
and it's very easy to cultivate for

42
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,520
those of us who are gardeners

43
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,560
not to mention it'll grow in full shade

44
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,799
underneath of

45
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,320
black walnuts for the permaculturists

46
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:40,079
out there

47
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:43,680
it can be made into dried green powders

48
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,119
or blended up into pestos

49
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:49,759
or it can also be steamed and sauteed

50
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,240
any kind of heat will deactivate the

51
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,000
stinging hairs and make it edible

52
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,759
but yeah definitely my number one

53
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:59,040
all-time favorite has to be

54
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:02,000
stinging nettle so number two

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,399
on my list of wild edible greens has got

56
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:05,520
to be

57
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:08,399
chickweed this is another great friend

58
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:10,640
to really connect with and bring into

59
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,440
the kitchen

60
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,720
so this is stellaria media common name

61
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,280
is chickweed

62
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:19,920
and i love this one because it's pretty

63
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:22,239
easy to identify it has these

64
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,040
really cute little star-shaped flowers

65
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:25,920
on it

66
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,800
and opposite leaves it's really cool and

67
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,400
juicy

68
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:33,360
and the flavor is really

69
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,920
awesome it's one that i do like to cook

70
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,080
because

71
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,680
it's a little bit higher in the oxalic

72
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,400
acid department

73
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,400
but it also makes a great pesto and can

74
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,239
be dried into powders

75
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,560
so yeah i would definitely say number

76
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,800
two on the list is chickweed

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:50,879
and keep an eye out for this one in the

78
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,160
spring and fall it'll disappear in the

79
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,640
summer

80
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:56,160
so number three on my list is lamb's

81
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,800
quarters this is one of the

82
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:59,760
first friends that i really got tuned in

83
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:02,159
to when i was

84
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,599
first starting to eat something wild

85
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,360
every day

86
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:10,959
the latin name is cannipodium album

87
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:12,239
and it's just an absolute superstar from

88
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,080
the spinach family

89
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,560
it's one of the most nutritious plants

90
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:20,239
on earth it's also one of the highest

91
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:23,599
wild greens in oxalic acid

92
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,760
so this is one that i definitely like to

93
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,879
cook it up i like to steam it

94
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:32,560
boil it pan fry it

95
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:35,040
anything to help cook out and denature

96
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,319
those oxalates but after that it's an

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,360
absolutely

98
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,480
flavor packed incredible edible this is

99
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,400
one that should be

100
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,720
in all the four star restaurants and it

101
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:48,400
should definitely be on everyone's plate

102
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:51,040
so can a podium album lamb's quarters

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:55,120
number three number four on my list is

104
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:56,879
definitely dandelion taraxicum officiale

105
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,879
this is one that most everybody's

106
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:02,480
probably already familiar with

107
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:04,560
it is an absolute incredible edible

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:06,720
the leaves are great in salad but they

109
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,280
can also be boiled to remove some of the

110
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,439
bitterness if you're not into that

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,319
they are loaded with all kinds of

112
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,280
nutrients

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,199
tons of vitamin a and they're the second

114
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,359
highest source of boron of any of the

115
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,840
wild greens which is cool because

116
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:23,120
boron helps to detoxify the body of

117
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,800
fluoride so

118
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,320
it's definitely an important one for us

119
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,880
to bring into our diets

120
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,400
and it's also a great one for helping to

121
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:32,639
support the liver health

122
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,160
and helping our body to detoxify

123
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:37,360
multiple different ways

124
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:39,040
so dandelion is definitely one for

125
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:41,840
everybody to tune into

126
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:43,360
and bring home to the dinner plate

127
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,880
coming in at number five

128
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:49,280
is ali area petiolata the

129
00:04:46,880 --> 00:04:50,160
garlic mustard so this is a biennial

130
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:52,720
plant

131
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,840
in the brassica kca family the mustard

132
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,800
family

133
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:57,840
like the first four on our list it's and

134
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,120
it's a european

135
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:04,720
import that is very weedy and prolific

136
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:05,120
and this one in fact uh is alleleopathic

137
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:07,199
so

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:09,440
it competes against other plants in the

139
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,440
area and for that reason i really love

140
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,479
encouraging people to consume these

141
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:14,800
kinds of plants

142
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,520
that are exotic to our region so that we

143
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,680
can help

144
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,600
native habitats to thrive a little bit

145
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
more take some of the pressure off of

146
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:23,600
the native plants in that way

147
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,520
this one was brought over from europe

148
00:05:23,600 --> 00:05:29,600
because it's very highly nutritious

149
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,400
190 milligrams of vitamin c

150
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:34,479
per 100 gram serving which is very easy

151
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:36,320
to consume in a batch of pesto

152
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,160
and that's definitely one of my favorite

153
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:39,919
ways to bring garlic mustard into the

154
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,840
kitchen is in pesto form

155
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,680
it also makes a great cooked green

156
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:46,800
sauteed or

157
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,240
even steamed up or you can boil it when

158
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,520
it gets older to take some of the

159
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:51,440
bitterness out

160
00:05:49,520 --> 00:05:54,160
so yeah definitely number five on the

161
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,080
list is ali area petiolata

162
00:05:54,160 --> 00:06:01,440
garlic mustard so number six on our list

163
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,560
is basswood this is the

164
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:06,960
american basswood talia americana

165
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,080
and this is a native tree in the mallow

166
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,560
family

167
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,240
and i love this one because we don't get

168
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:13,280
to eat a whole lot of tree leaves and

169
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,479
this one is so

170
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:18,560
mild and has such a nice flavor

171
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:20,000
that it can actually be the basis for a

172
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,240
salad i love

173
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,240
greens that we can eat raw it also makes

174
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:27,199
an excellent green powder

175
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,000
makes it fantastic sauteed greens

176
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,720
steamed

177
00:06:28,000 --> 00:06:32,479
any way that you prepare it basswood is

178
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,319
absolutely incredible

179
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:36,720
and the leaves also have this nice kind

180
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:38,319
of mucilaginous quality to it

181
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,240
that i think really helps to keep us

182
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:43,759
hydrated in the summertime

183
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:45,120
and also makes for a wonderful tea when

184
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:48,160
we've got a sore throat

185
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:52,960
so yeah definitely number six on the

186
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:56,080
on the list is basswood tilia americana

187
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:58,639
so for number seven on our list we have

188
00:06:56,080 --> 00:07:00,479
another tree leaf and this is one that i

189
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:01,520
bet a lot of you are already familiar

190
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:03,759
with because it is

191
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:05,520
world famous for its berries and of

192
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:06,400
course we're talking about the mighty

193
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:08,880
mulberry

194
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:09,520
so in the mid-atlantic we'd be that

195
00:07:08,880 --> 00:07:13,199
would be

196
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,680
either morris alba which is the asian

197
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,199
species or morris rubra which is the

198
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,960
native one

199
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:24,479
they both have edible leaves there is

200
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:26,080
um an introduced species uh browzanitia

201
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:28,240
papyro fera

202
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,759
that is a look-alike that's worth

203
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:31,919
looking into it's called the paper

204
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:34,960
mulberry it's in the same family

205
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:37,919
but not as edible and

206
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:38,639
this one it's not as some of them are

207
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:41,280
acceptable

208
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:43,199
as a salad crop but more so i think of

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,240
mulberries as being great for green

210
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:47,280
powders or

211
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,840
cooked greens either steamed sauteed

212
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:50,879
or otherwise kind of cooked down a

213
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:52,960
little bit

214
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,639
and yeah i love mulberries because

215
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:55,599
they're so easy to identify and they're

216
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:59,039
so prolific

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,199
and they have these deep roots and

218
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,160
they're just beautiful amazing awesome

219
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:05,840
trees

220
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:08,800
so number seven is the mighty mulberry

221
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:10,080
morris alba morris rubra coming in at

222
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:13,759
number eight on our list

223
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:18,240
is purslane porchalaca ola racia

224
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,879
and this is a really great cooking green

225
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,240
it can also be added raw to salads the

226
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,400
flavor is great

227
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,080
it is kind of high in oxalic acid so i

228
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,479
do prefer to cook it myself

229
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:30,639
personally but i have heard of people

230
00:08:28,479 --> 00:08:31,520
adding it to smoothies it's got a little

231
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,159
bit of a

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,279
sliminess to it that adds a great

233
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:38,560
mucilaginous

234
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,320
kind of throat coating quality to it

235
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,159
and one of the other things that's

236
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:45,760
amazing about this plant is

237
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,040
it's remarkably high omega-3

238
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,720
fat content so this is a great source of

239
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:54,640
omega-3 fats from

240
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:58,080
a local wild uh you know plant-based

241
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:59,279
source so yeah definitely let's say

242
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:04,800
number eight

243
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,800
is portulaca ola racia purslane

244
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,440
so number nine on our list is asclepius

245
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,880
syriaca

246
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:13,920
this is a native perennial that grows in

247
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,880
open fields

248
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,920
all throughout the country this one is

249
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,480
absolutely

250
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
incredibly delicious it's important to

251
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:24,480
boil this one twice because

252
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,959
it does have cardiac glycosides known as

253
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:29,920
cardinalites in it that are pretty toxic

254
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,640
so i like to boil it in two changes of

255
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:32,480
water

256
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,920
another thing to be aware of with this

257
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:37,040
plant is that it looks

258
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:39,600
very similar to another native that is

259
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,440
poisonous and that's dog bane

260
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,279
so this is the dog bane right here and

261
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,320
you can see that they obviously grow

262
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:48,560
in the exact same habitat and

263
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
so superficially it can be difficult to

264
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,880
tell the two apart but

265
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:53,680
when you get into the core of it you can

266
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
see

267
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,560
the inside of the milkweed is hollow

268
00:09:56,399 --> 00:09:59,519
where the inside of the dog bane is

269
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:01,920
solid

270
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,720
and so that's a very key distinguishing

271
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,040
feature

272
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:08,480
that makes it easy to tell the two apart

273
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:11,040
sclepius syriaca number nine

274
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,399
coming in at number 10 on our list is

275
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,440
the mighty bidens

276
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:17,279
beggar's ticks spanish needles and with

277
00:10:15,440 --> 00:10:20,399
this one we'll go ahead and say

278
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:22,240
the entire genus as far as i know every

279
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,000
species is edible

280
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,360
some are definitely better than others

281
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:27,279
i've noticed

282
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:28,560
this one in particular is biden's

283
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,600
frondosa

284
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:34,959
and this one is a great weedy

285
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:35,680
summer superstar it's in the aster

286
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:38,560
family

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,360
and has a little bit of kind of bitter

288
00:10:38,560 --> 00:10:42,079
sappiness

289
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
to it so i do prefer to either boil or

290
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:47,120
steam it before using it for pesto

291
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,279
but an absolutely incredible cooking

292
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,160
green loaded with nutrition

293
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:52,800
and also has a medicinal component to it

294
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:56,240
as well

295
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:59,360
being very popular as a

296
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:03,120
gentle but effective antibiotic

297
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,800
so yeah and the common names beggars

298
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,720
ticks and spanish needles are a

299
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,279
reference to the seed

300
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:10,399
and so that makes these very easy to

301
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,640
identify

302
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:14,480
and you'll see them all over the place

303
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:17,680
once you start looking for them

304
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,839
number 10 guidance so thanks so much for
