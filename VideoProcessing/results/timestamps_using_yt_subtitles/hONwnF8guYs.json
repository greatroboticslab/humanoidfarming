  "text": "foreign [Music] matters which is a program of the north central stair program that essentially we help Elevate the stories and share projects from our farmer Rancher grantees I am one of the hosts Aaron Schneider I farm and I work for Sayre and I am excited to be with you all and as well as Marie Flanagan our communication specialist hello hey and we have a special guest with us today Peter scold with waxwing farm and he is here to share um a story of his farmer Rancher project which is forcing Belgian and dive and traviso Radicchio in the Upper Midwest well yeah I can just give a quick introduction of myself so I'm Peter skull from I own waxwing Farm together with my wife Anna racer um this coming season will be our 13th growing season uh growing mixed vegetables um both for CSA and we sell probably half of our businesses selling to restaurants as well we sell a little bit to the Prior Lake School District and outside of the Twin Cities but that's kind of the the big breakdown and um yeah we got um through our restaurant work we got interested in growing um Radicchio and kind of The Logical extension of that has brought us to this project um so it's just kind of it was a desire to expand our options and diversify our winter offerings to our restaurants and we thought it might fit the bill but we needed a little uh help to get over the hump of of the initial investment in trial period so the that's why we applied for the Sarah Grant and once we got it we put the project into uh into practice and um had a few hiccups because of the coveted pandemic but um we actually it was It was kind of nice we we delayed the project or extended the project by a year because of that and we were able to put a lot of stuff that we had learned into practice and I think the the project was actually better for it okay so um yeah this is just a little presentation I put together just to kind of um hit the high points of of what we learned um so as you can see it the whole thing was about diversifying our season extension you know Season extension in the Upper Midwest is really critical for Vegetable Farms um and so um we just wanted to explore an option to give us something um something a little bit more higher value than some of the root crops especially for us uh selling to restaurants you know root crops at smaller restaurant volumes are not super profitable um so having something that um is a higher demand higher value product um was was something that we've been pursuing for our winter restaurant sales and we thought that these forcing chicorys um would fit that bill pretty well so so what is a forcing chicory it's um chicories are a crop that grows a lot like lettuce so it's got a leafy top above ground and a single Taproot down below it's been used for thousands and thousands of years it's originally from the Mediterranean area um and it includes you know forage crops and also crops for human consumption humans and animals alike both the leaves and The Roots the Roots historically have been used as a coffee substitute um so it's it's a crop that is well known um in certain parts of the world um and then Radicchio and Endive are the things that are the crops in the family that uh most um people are familiar with um and so forcing chicories are a certain variety that you plant them in this in the ground and you grow them like a regular chicory throughout the growing season but then you dig them up and you bring them inside and you force them to grow inside a dark room or chamber um which forces them to grow without chlorophyll and so you get a totally different product than what grows in the field so not only is it is it a unique um kind of value-added product for that reason um but it also it tastes great too it tastes a lot different than what you grow in the field so yeah this uh just kind of gets at why we wanted to to grow these things again like I mentioned it's about extending our season our growing season and finding a way to increase the value of some of our winter sales to restaurants in particular um it worked really well with our our farm infrastructure because we're able to use a walk-in cooler as our forcing chamber that is not used in the winter and then it also just kind of gives us a little bit more work to do in the winter which in theory could take away some of the workload from the summer and it's it's all about diversifying those winter sails so growing the stuff is uh it's a lot like growing lettuce um it doesn't really if you're set up to grow lettuce it doesn't require any additional equipment um you can either direct seed it in the field or transplant it um the most the biggest difference there is uh the impact on root shape so this crop even though a lot of people think of chicories as um a leafy crop when you're growing them for forcing you really got to think about it as uh you're growing a root crop um and so um I'll get to it later in the presentation about why root shape can in certain situations make a difference but um once you see them and get them in the field uh it's just like I said it's just like growing lettuce so you've got to keep them weeded keep them well watered it's a long crop so they have to be seated um right around mid-summer or early July um in order to get them in the ground and have them grow enough to produce a sizable root that can be forced um so for Harvest once you've once you've grown them all up we used an undercutter bar to lift the bed and then pull the roots out just like we would if we were growing carrots um you trim the greens and you have to make sure that you leave the growing tip intact you can see on the picture on the left a lot of those roots have about one to two inches of green still left on top that's critical for getting especially for Endive for getting the right shape um of the final product um on the right you can see we threw them into feed sacks that we stored in our walk-in cooler to help keep them at the right humidity and they store just like any other root crop best at about you know 32 35 with really high relative humidity uh here's a picture of the forcing chamber so like I said the forcing chamber is uh we utilize an uh walking cooler that we use in the summer for um you know storing cold sensitive things like tomatoes and eggplant and zucchini and cucumbers but in the winter that infrastructure was idle so this was uh this project was a really good way to utilize that idle space that was otherwise just sitting there um we had these galvanized steel tanks custom made for this project and you can see kind of just those red hoses connecting each of the tanks so that we can circulate water through the entire system I think that's helpful to keep the water aerated and keep keep things healthy but I don't think it's critical I think you could um get by with a much simpler system of just some tupperwares with roots in them and you know a couple inches of water that maybe you changed every couple of you know maybe once a week or something like that um so it certainly doesn't have to be this sophisticated I think that um we just wanted to to really have a system that um fit the best like larger scale commercial systems that we could identify and so a lot of the larger commercial systems had had the same kind of water bath circulating water um but I don't think it's critical so this is the actual process for forcing them for targivo Radicchio you dig them up uh from the field and you pull them out of storage and on the left you can see that these plants were transplanted so you can see that the roots are a lot more kind of splayed out and gnarly um we trim off most of the greens so on the left you see the root with a lot of the greens attached still and then on the right is what it looks like before we put it into the bulb crate for forcing and then on the right hand side you can see a bulb crate that's ready to go into the forcing chamber so you peel off most of the greens because the green leaves eventually Decay and die and become kind of a slimy mess and so the less of that that you bring into the you know into the forcing chamber the less cleanup you have to do on the back side and then once you put them into the forcing chamber it takes about three weeks for them to grow you can see these ones in this picture we trimmed all the greens off um so there's no decaying matter and that actually worked pretty well too so um but once they're in there you just have to make sure that the water level is sufficient so that the roots have something to drink and that you don't accidentally leave the light on that's the biggest thing is any light will cause the plants to start photosynthesizing which degrades them for Harvest um you take the bulb crates out trim off the root and you can see in the picture you leave kind of a little little stub of the root that's at least the traditional Italian way to do it um uh and you clean off all the bad leaves and then soak it in cold water to kind of let it rehydrate just a little bit it does tend to get a little dried out in the forcing chamber and then once you rinse it clean you can shake it dry and package it um for sale and just keep it dark so it doesn't start photosynthesizing so Endive is a little bit different um you can just trim them in the field and you want to make sure like I said before you leave the right amount of greens intact on the left picture on the left you can see the root on the bottom was trimmed too close and you can see that there's five or six small little Sprouts that are coming off of the sides so those aren't going to be marketable because they're going to stay really really small um whereas the root on the top was trimmed properly and you can still see the growth tip of the greens intact so that's going to form a nice tight head growing from the middle of that root so that's that's the critical thing that we learned and that was one of those things that we didn't learn that lesson the first year that we did it and so extending the project by a second year um allowed us to kind of learn from that mistake and and have a lot more success the second year um Endive is is grown more on a commercial scale so it's more of a familiar crop than the forcing radicchios and so it's been bred to develop that really nice straight Tap Root so if you direct seed to Belgian endive it'll grow a nice straight Taproot that then could be packed really tightly into the bulk crates you can see on the picture on the right that we fit you know more than double the number of hand dive Roots into one bulb crate so it's a much more efficient use of space so then harvesting um and dive grows a little bit slower it takes more closer to six weeks um you can see here this picture we've got on the top there's some chickens that are just about ready to be harvested and underneath we have a um some roots that were started a couple weeks after that so they're just starting to grow so it's but it's basically you can just cut them off of the um the root either with a knife or just by snapping them off trim off any leaves that are you know ill ill-shaped or have any kind of tinge of green to them and then you can pack them right from the forcing crate um for sale and again keep them dark so they don't start photosynthesizing we did notice that the the end I was more likely to start photosynthesizing than the Radicchio if you aren't careful um marketing you know the restaurants were our primary customers for this uh product they're both definitely Specialty Products um the tardivo is not commercially available anywhere in the US that we were available so um that helped it command a higher price but also because it's less familiar you know the the market options are are more limited for sure specialty restaurants that either have an open mind or are have previously worked with it are the easiest targets Belgian endive on the other hand um is historically more of a large-scale production it's more of an industrial crop so it's it's available from regular wholesalers vegetable wholesalers uh it shows up on a lot of winter restaurant Market or restaurant menus um so because of that reason the market price is a lot lower so you need to sell in a higher volume in order to make the make it work cost wise I think the opportunity is definitely there for that but um it's I think you would have to do it on a pretty significant volume other options are winters farmers markets you know in the same way that uh for restaurants it's a really unique different crop to differentiate ourselves from the competition in the winter you know if there's a winter Farmers Market you know just having these things on your stall is gonna just everyone's gonna come and take at least take a look so then you can tell the story um and you know you have to do a lot of customer education I think but um the opportunity certainly is there to get people to at least try this unique product and then you know if they're specialty grocery stores I don't think that necessarily either of these products are going to show up in regular everyday grocery stores but um there's certainly a possibility for um customers regular you know individual customers who either already know about these um products or are interested in getting their hands on something unique and different so there's other Radicchio varieties that are either meant to be forcing varieties like this isantina in the middle is grows really really small and it's got a really vibrant cool color but um is you know the market for that is probably pretty limited we've been growing The Chicory Rosa on the left um that is not specifically a forcing variety but in the Upper Midwest it it works that way um so we've we've had some success growing that crap as a forcing Radicchio and then like I mentioned um you know the the Belgian endive I think for our scale we found that um the the forcing radicchios are more cost effective for us just because of the higher price that they uh command um but again if you wanted to really scale up and do an acre or two of Belgian endive and you know talk to a wholesaler and try to kind of corner the the market um I think that there's possibility there and I think that you know that it could be cost effective so I think there's definitely opportunities that have been illuminated by this this uh project yeah and so I mean couldn't have done it without North Central Sarah so uh just thank you for everything that um the organization has done to support and fund this project it was it was a lot of fun and we learned a lot and we certainly developed a practice that we're going to keep using so uh overall it's been a huge success what just like so for someone experiencing Radicchio or Endive for the first time how would you describe that taste or like yeah it's um it's definitely bitter so you know I think um that's the the first thing that um turns people off is that it's it's got a bitterness to it um you know because we work with the restaurants we've been they've been slowly nudging us to growing a lot of radicchios a lot of restaurants are are really excited about that so you know there's kind of a spectrum of like the regular main season um ridicuous like with um kind of frize and um oh gosh no but escarole are which are Endive crops um that are on the milder side and then there's kind of the there's the kyoja which are like the round softball red radicchios that you see in the grocery store or in the salad mixes those are kind of like less bitter in the middle and then you can go all the way down and there's some really wacky ones that are like um puntarelle is an is a it's like basically you're you're harvesting the flower stock so it's real bitter real tough but then you soak it in the cold water and it Mellows it out um so so bitterness is kind of the key there is the main feature but there's it's you know it's kind of hard to describe the flavor unless you you have it and then the um these forcing varieties because they're just using they're not using photosynthesis for their they're just using cellular respiration so there's a whole different metabolic pathway that's happening within the plant um and so it's just they're they're different um chemical compounds that are being formed within the leaves so it's um the sweetness is like it's less bitter more sweet but it's not like sugary sweet it's kind of it's a it's a yeah it's it's hard to describe but did the crop find you or you found the crop I guess what I mean by that is like did you imagine yourself when you embarked on farming like yeah endives it's gonna be all about endives or like no no it was this was not at all on my radar at all I mean it's um I've always enjoyed Radicchio but but even you know prior to getting into growing it myself you know it was not a like it was a staple on my dinner table as a Scandinavian Heritage person from Minnesota you know um it's not a not a part of my culinary background but um so it was definitely working with the restaurants that has has kind of pushed us to broaden um our our scope of the crops that we grow um you know every once in a while we sneak Radicchio into our CSA but it it doesn't usually go over super well uh it's not a it's not a universally loved thing like uh potatoes or tomatoes or anything like that you trim the leaves and then you have these leftover Roots um what do you do with those yeah so um right now they're just going the compost um but I think that you know again being that they are um historically have been a forage crop um there's some value for I was just reading before this uh meeting that historically they were used as a substitute for oats for horses because there's a similar kind of nutrient breakdown um so for sure you know if you had Livestock on the farm through the winter uh when these spent Roots could you know just go into the pig pasture or into the you know parlor or horse barn whatever um I think that's actually how these first got discovered they would dig them up and then stick them in the corner of a barn and then in the spring when things started warming up they'd start to sprout or if like water was Dripping on them they'd start to sprout and grow um but in the darkness of the back corner of the barn and so then you know people as they're feeding horses or whatever like snap one off and take a bite it's like oh this is unique and different roasted chicory is a coffee substitute so I think you could talk to coffee shops and see if that was something that they wanted to try getting locally um it's showed up in um Stouts and porters and from breweries um so I think you could talk to Brewers about so I do think that there's an opportunity for turning that into an additional Revenue stream as well and if nothing else feeding it to livestock so that you you know recapture that value can you use the route more than once they're um there's some speculation that yes you could um I I read some in our initial research I read some um sources that said yes you can I think maybe if you were to it the the tricky part is like how you were would Harvest that chicken because then if if you cut it low enough to keep it as a nice tight that doesn't just like all the all the um leaves fall off uh you're gonna cut it low enough that you're gonna damage that that Central growth tip um so I think you know maybe snapping it off you could um but it's not something that we explored it's interesting it's beautiful it's like lots of sequencing and just like I thank you for taking through that taking us through that whole process and for other Farmers as well just like and I can just feel your joy in this discovery yeah I mean right exactly and it's you know again I I think that you know for small scale agriculture um you know especially working with restaurants a lot of the farmers that we know that are you know growing mixed vegetables in the winter they switch to like large volumes of a couple root crops um you know selling to school districts or uh wholesalers or grocery stores that kind of thing which you know is certainly viable and um but you know we as threat as the farm that we are we're we're sized a little different and we found that every time we try to dip our toe into that really larger scale like moving pallets of things at a time uh and always you know we're just not geared for that so we we were really hoping that this would be something that would allow us to kind of keep that smaller scale but just you know increase the value of those smaller smaller deliveries to restaurants in the winter and um and it really did pay off [Music] foreign",
