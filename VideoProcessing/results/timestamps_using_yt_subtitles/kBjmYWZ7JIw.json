for children and nursing mothers four they are a good source of income five they are easily available in rural areas and near Urban centers at affordable prices in Kenya there are different breeds of improved kyi Birds here are five best breeds to choose from first Ki improved this breed was developed by the Kenya Agricultural and livestock research organization k a l o it will grow fast to a weight of 1.5 kg in 5 months they will lay around 200 to 270 eggs per year two the Kura bird with this breed you easily convert the kitchen and farm waste into meat and eggs they are a fast growing breed they lay around 150 eggs per year third rainbow rooster this is a fast growing multicolored bird it was bred by a research and breeding Farm in India they have to be fed commercial layer feeds to lay 160 to 180 eggs per year four kenro chicken they have red feathers they grow fast if kept for meat they can grow to a weight of 1.5 kgs in just 3 months if kept for eggs they will start laying in just 6 months they lay around 200 eggs per year sinkam Sasso this are multicolored Birds which grow slowly they will lay around 150 to 200 eggs with good management mostly raised for meat and is left free to eat grass worms and insects with little supplementation there are three main ways of keeping improved kenyi chickens one free and semi- free range free range is where the chickens are left free to eat worms insects grasses and leaves around the farm they are then sheltered at night semi-free range is where birds are put in an enclosed place for some time and given food they are then allowed to roam outside to eat worms insects grasses and leaves around the farm this is my personal favorite so you know second fold unit system this is also known as a chicken tractor birds are kept in a small movable house made out of wire mesh big enough for the chickens to move around this house is moved from one spot to another every day this system is best suited to small scale operations and chicken vendors third small scale confined system this is also known as the deep litter system the chicken house is made of concrete floors but covered with litter wood shavings that is to make Birds feel comfortable the house is big to allow the chickens to move freely food and water are provided inside the house it is expensive but the best for commercial chicken farming chicken equipment both Drinkers and feeders should always be kept clean and wellmaintained this will prevent cases of diseases in your chicken these are the equipments required to raise 100 chicks comfortably feeders one feeder for every 50-day old chicks cleaned and disinfected all with fresh starter feed drinkers one Drinker for every 50-day old chicks cleaned and disinfected regularly and with fresh water always use 6 l or 10 L drink of what are features of a good Drinker has a Twist lock system and a hanger or carry handle easy to fill easy to clean drinkers come in different sizes 1 lit 6 L and 10 L choose as it fits litter use wood shavings or rice husks not sawdust as chicks can choke spread evenly to a depth of 5 to 10 cm the litter should be soft and dry heat Source ensure that you have a source of heat like a brooda Joo and it is working well maintain a good temperature for your birds light the idea is to provide 23 hours of light for the first seven days as this dramatically improves chick development brooder guards round plywood is used to make the brooding area 1.5 m squ per 50 ch the area is cleaned disinfected and with well spread fresh litter cover this area with paper and remove after 3 days looking to dive even deeper get our full expert guide packed with all the details it's a clucking great deal WhatsApp us at the number in the description and secure your copy today saucing for chicks here are three ways to get good and healthy chicks chicks one hatching own chicks mother hen sits on eggs for 21 days to keep them warm until they hatch this is a natural process she can sit and incubate her own eggs or those of another hen it's the simplest way of hatching a small number of eggs I prefer giving one hen only eight eggs to hatch you have almost 100% hatch rate two artificial brooding incubating machines are used to hatch eggs into chicks it's mostly used by farmers who are in the business of selling day old chicks or keeping many birds it hatches many eggs at once three buying day old chicks from hatcheries you can buy day old chicks from hatcheries directly and start brooding the chickens on your farm identify registered hatcheries or chick nurseries to buy day old chicks select hatcheries that vaccinate chicks against marik's disease brooding is a period right after the chicks have hatched and special care and attention is needed to support their health and survival because hatch chicks can't control their own body temperature in the first weeks you need to provide extra heat otherwise chicks will be too cold and May may not eat well drink enough or may even die one traditional brooding here brooding is done by the mother chicken she covers the young ones with her wings to keep them warm two artificial brooding when there is no mother hen to look after her chicks you need to set up an artificial brooder during the first 2 to 3 weeks chicks need to be kept in a brooder as they cannot control their own body temperature yet you need to give them special care to support their health and survival artificial heat helps keep chicks stay warm until the feathers grow heat can be provided by using a brooding go gas or electricity remember without the extra warmth chicks can easily feel cold and may not eat or drink enough and their digestive organs may not develop properly improved kyi chickens need feed that contains the following one energy second protein third vitamins four minerals five water feed requirement is dependent on the age and status of the birds chicks Growers layers meat birds and broody hens there are different types of chicken feed for the different age categories as I am about to discuss chicks below the age of 8 weeks feed them with chick Mash as it provides high protein quantities chicks between the age of 8 and 18 weeks feed them with Growers Mash to provide a balanced diet so that the chicks can gain weight fast when the chicks start laying feed them layers Mash this will provide needed nutrients to improve egg production good practices to protect your chicken against disease and enemies only allow essential staff to enter the chicken house place a foot bath with a disinfectant like kooper side outside the chicken house each person working in the house should have their own special pair of gum boots that they wear when entering the house remove old litter dirty bags and rubbish away from the house throw away old feed as they may have molds or produce toxins keep birds of the same age together to reduce disease outbreaks ensure no rodents or wild animals can enter the house regularly clean and dry all equipment thanks for watching if you found this video helpful don't forget to subscribe and hey if you subscribe today we might just send you a
