00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,160
hello everyone welcome to jadam in this

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,840
episode I'll talk about how to use and

5
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,160
store the jadam natural pesticide here I

6
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:28,480
have prepared jadam wedding agent Jam

7
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:30,560
sulfur and jam herbal solution with this

8
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,680
combination you're getting the perfect

9
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:33,719
natural pesticide for your garden and

10
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,280
for

11
00:00:33,719 --> 00:00:38,520
farming and in this video I'll show you

12
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:41,120
how to mix all the solution in a proper

13
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,160
way this is Jam herbal solution which is

14
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:46,640
the extract of any herbs with

15
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:49,440
insecticide repellent effect herbs that

16
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:52,960
are often used are peppermint Rosemary

17
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:55,239
lavender Jerusalem Arch choke and broen

18
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:57,680
and recently we have been testing Cosmos

19
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:00,680
plant and it is showing significant

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:05,360
results with all this plant you can

21
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:07,799
control from AIT to might but above all

22
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,680
our most favorite plant is Ginko until

23
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:12,520
now because there is not a single path

24
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,000
that we won't be able to control with

25
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:18,000
this plant all the details and the ratio

26
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:20,320
are listed in my book Jam organic

27
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,640
farming and the new book Jam organic

28
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:25,840
pest and Disease Control briefly

29
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:28,479
speaking it is very straightforward to

30
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,040
make plant extracts all you need is to

31
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:32,920
boil the plant for five hours and more

32
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,159
detailed information is spoken in my

33
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:37,960
lecture so please click the link of to

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:40,000
see the lecture video the first thing I

35
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:41,840
would like to talk about is how to store

36
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:43,520
The herbal solution once you're done

37
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:45,360
with the boiling the herbs pour the

38
00:01:43,520 --> 00:01:48,000
solution in the bottle to put it in a

39
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:50,040
sideway so that it can be vacuum sealed

40
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:53,119
in this way you can store The herbal

41
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:56,240
solution for a couple of

42
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:58,600
years but the problem is when you opened

43
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:01,039
it for use because when it contacts with

44
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,600
the air the properties of the solution

45
00:02:01,039 --> 00:02:07,119
start to change gradually which causes

46
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,319
decrease in its insecticidal function an

47
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,800
easy way to identify that the solution

48
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,840
is usable or not is the air pressure of

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,840
the bottle due to the

50
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,800
fermentation but to make sure the best

51
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,879
way is to drop small portion of jam

52
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,599
wedding agent before any use in

53
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:31,480
different Beaker once you drop the jwa

54
00:02:28,599 --> 00:02:35,480
if the color of the GH s doesn't change

55
00:02:31,480 --> 00:02:35,480
that means it is still good for

56
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:42,440
use and another problem is how to store

57
00:02:39,480 --> 00:02:44,760
an opened bottle properly even if you

58
00:02:42,440 --> 00:02:47,720
put it into refrigerator the changes

59
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:50,360
cannot be stopped so the best way is to

60
00:02:47,720 --> 00:02:52,440
get the help of ethanol there are

61
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:55,959
usually two types of ethanol sold in the

62
00:02:52,440 --> 00:03:00,200
market one is with 84% Purity and the

63
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:04,480
other one is with 99% purity

64
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:08,159
when you are using 99% ethanol add

65
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:10,959
15% of ethanol from what is left over

66
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,080
and 84% with

67
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:16,159
25% with the help of ethanol you can

68
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:19,680
increase the shelf life of J herbal

69
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:22,120
solution even in atmospheric temperature

70
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,400
when none of the herbs are available

71
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,040
near you you can also use sodium

72
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,360
hydroxide as an alternative solution for

73
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,920
pest

74
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,799
control with sodi hydroxide you can

75
00:03:30,920 --> 00:03:36,400
treat a problem of scale insects and

76
00:03:33,799 --> 00:03:38,239
snails however I do not recommend

77
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,840
constant use of this substance because

78
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,439
of the concentration

79
00:03:39,840 --> 00:03:47,879
damage jwa is recommended to use around

80
00:03:43,439 --> 00:03:53,799
200 to 600 mL for 20 L and 5 to 15 L for

81
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:58,079
500 L JS is 40 ml to 60 ml for 20 L and

82
00:03:53,799 --> 00:04:00,720
JHS is 200 mL to 600 mL for 20

83
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:03,439
L recently we have been receiving a lot

84
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:05,680
of questions from flower and gardeners

85
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,640
about our Jam solution so let me

86
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:11,319
elaborate on how to combine all three

87
00:04:08,640 --> 00:04:14,120
solution for Pest and Disease Control

88
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:16,079
this this is the sprayer that I use for

89
00:04:14,120 --> 00:04:19,239
testing the solution before the field

90
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:21,040
test this particular brand of spray is

91
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,880
my favorite due to its longl lasting

92
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:28,320
durability it cost little more but this

93
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,880
is a product worth a check out since we

94
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:32,800
are testing one liter of small amount

95
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,280
measuring the ratio also must be

96
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,840
calculated with the

97
00:04:34,280 --> 00:04:40,240
shring before doing the mixing process

98
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,400
please do use soft water it is mandatory

99
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:45,000
to achieve its full capability and now

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:48,639
let me show you how the natural

101
00:04:45,000 --> 00:04:53,400
disinfectant is made I I'll measure 800

102
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:56,360
ml of soft water first I will add 10 mL

103
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:56,360
of jam wedding

104
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:03,400
agent next

105
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:06,600
2 ml of jam

106
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:09,160
sulfur and now it is complete this

107
00:05:06,600 --> 00:05:12,039
yellowish human urine like liquid is

108
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:16,039
natural disinfectant it can treat dowy

109
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:19,840
MW powdery MW and anthra no speaking of

110
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:22,039
anthros you can also control this just

111
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:25,280
by increasing

112
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:28,600
jwa as you can see Jam's natural Pest

113
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:32,199
Solutions are very easy to do with the

114
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:35,120
best effect on past and Disease Control

115
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:37,960
and by adding Jam herbal solution it

116
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,280
becomes allpurpose natural past and

117
00:05:37,960 --> 00:05:42,840
disease

118
00:05:40,280 --> 00:05:47,360
solution then I'll add a little more

119
00:05:42,840 --> 00:05:47,360
water to make it one full

120
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:01,520
liter best thing about Jam natural Pesci

121
00:05:59,400 --> 00:06:04,360
side unlike any commercially available

122
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,160
chemical pesticide Jam natural pesticide

123
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:10,039
is very safe to use there will be no big

124
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:12,800
problem even it is contacted on our skin

125
00:06:10,039 --> 00:06:16,039
so you can also just wash the fruit to

126
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:19,039
eat right after spraying datam natural

127
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:19,960
Pest solution is all about combination

128
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:23,199
of

129
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:27,280
jwa JS and

130
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,919
JHS to increase insecticidal effect all

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,599
you need to do is the increase the

132
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:36,160
amount of jwa and JHS and for

133
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,599
disinfectant increase

134
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:43,240
JS but make sure to perform

135
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,680
concentration test in advance for JS

136
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:49,440
before spraying to the crops in this way

137
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,160
you can control almost all Pest and

138
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:55,000
disease you can add additional sodium

139
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:57,720
hydroxide and red clay powder for scale

140
00:06:55,000 --> 00:07:00,280
insects and snails let me show you how

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,680
to add them just add the sodium

142
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,479
hydroxide in the beaker with water to

143
00:07:02,680 --> 00:07:09,759
melt it

144
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,759
down this is very useful for scale

145
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:22,639
insects an additional red clay powder is

146
00:07:18,199 --> 00:07:22,639
for increasing the penetration

147
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:29,879
effect first add the water and steer a

148
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:32,520
couple of times then let it sit for a

149
00:07:29,879 --> 00:07:34,280
while until the layer is cleared out and

150
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,800
collect the surface of the red clay

151
00:07:34,280 --> 00:07:37,800
powder to add it into the

152
00:07:40,599 --> 00:07:45,280
bottle with this simple solution you

153
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:49,240
don't have to worry about Pest and

154
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:52,199
disease that occurs during farming but

155
00:07:49,240 --> 00:07:55,599
make sure to use it all before 3

156
00:07:52,199 --> 00:07:58,520
days however when you are adding sodium

157
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:01,400
hydroxide the solution can irritate your

158
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:04,280
skin when it makes

159
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:07,280
contact so please be aware of

160
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:09,879
