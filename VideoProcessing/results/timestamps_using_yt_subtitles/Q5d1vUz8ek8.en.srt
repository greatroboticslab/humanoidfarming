00:00:04,190 --> 00:00:09,210
hi guys welcome back to another episode

3
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:11,910
of mugs brew you here in my farm lab

4
00:00:09,210 --> 00:00:13,880
we're gonna do this with a lot less

5
00:00:11,910 --> 00:00:16,650
emphasis on the Edit and a lot more

6
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,420
emphasis on the information and today's

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:21,570
information is going to be about

8
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,580
irrigation not just any irrigation I'm

9
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:25,350
setting up a drip line system but I'm

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:26,640
not gonna be installing it today I do

11
00:00:25,350 --> 00:00:28,650
have a little bit of something I am

12
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,990
gonna do in the lab today I'm gonna

13
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:33,390
replace one of the times of my broadfork

14
00:00:30,990 --> 00:00:36,390
that I recently fabricated turns out I

15
00:00:33,390 --> 00:00:38,670
can't to thin but first off if you

16
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:41,250
haven't already seen any of my content

17
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:42,600
welcome to my channel I am more glue I'm

18
00:00:41,250 --> 00:00:44,789
gonna be dedicating the next few

19
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,379
episodes on this channel to our garden

20
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:47,969
that we busy developing and that is

21
00:00:46,379 --> 00:00:49,680
where the stripline irrigation is gonna

22
00:00:47,969 --> 00:00:51,480
be going I may put the link up there

23
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:53,280
it's not there yet means we haven't

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,320
installed it if it's there means we have

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:57,000
installed it however if it isn't there

26
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:58,680
it may just mean that I forgot to come

27
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:00,930
back from the future into the ponds to

28
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:05,580
put my tag up on the top of this and

29
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:07,820
talk to you guys these guys are terrible

30
00:01:05,580 --> 00:01:10,350
things I put this little energy to them

31
00:01:07,820 --> 00:01:12,210
properly so I always worry about you

32
00:01:10,350 --> 00:01:15,330
know they're flying around my neck oh

33
00:01:12,210 --> 00:01:17,310
yeah but we run into them at least once

34
00:01:15,330 --> 00:01:18,630
a week in the in the banana fields in

35
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:20,580
the summer anyway that's that's

36
00:01:18,630 --> 00:01:21,570
digressing from where I'm going I'm

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:23,280
trying to tell you guys about this

38
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:46,590
irrigation system that I'm setting up

39
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:49,530
and I got it down yet why are we setting

40
00:01:46,590 --> 00:01:51,600
up an irrigation system well the primary

41
00:01:49,530 --> 00:01:53,909
reason I suppose for me is time and

42
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,759
efficiency efficiency both in time

43
00:01:53,909 --> 00:01:59,159
management and in water efficiency water

44
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:00,869
use efficiency farm work is considered

45
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,570
one of the lowest paid jobs so let's

46
00:02:00,869 --> 00:02:06,450
just work at minimum minimum human cost

47
00:02:03,570 --> 00:02:08,459
per hour is 20 rand and if you're gonna

48
00:02:06,450 --> 00:02:09,690
water for an hour twice a day you're

49
00:02:08,459 --> 00:02:11,130
gonna be using two hours of your time

50
00:02:09,690 --> 00:02:13,590
strictly on watering

51
00:02:11,130 --> 00:02:16,380
there's two hours equals 40 round a day

52
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:18,000
now this is probably like three bucks or

53
00:02:16,380 --> 00:02:19,350
something in the states I don't know but

54
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,750
for you guys that's crazy cheap but

55
00:02:19,350 --> 00:02:24,780
let's just roll with this calculation

56
00:02:21,750 --> 00:02:27,000
for a second yeah you forty rounded day

57
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:28,890
ten days four hundred and thirty days

58
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:32,580
you're looking at thousand two hundred

59
00:02:28,890 --> 00:02:35,010
grand every three months is 3,600 and

60
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,840
now this whole set up by the filter cost

61
00:02:35,010 --> 00:02:41,400
me less than three thousand six hundred

62
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:44,520
Rand so what I'm trying to say is that

63
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,770
that time saved on watering pays itself

64
00:02:44,520 --> 00:02:49,050
off in three months if you come and look

65
00:02:46,770 --> 00:02:52,980
at my garden from the top and I will

66
00:02:49,050 --> 00:02:54,120
zoom out here to the next section where

67
00:02:52,980 --> 00:02:57,210
you can check it from the top we've got

68
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:58,800
a draw an image of our garden and I've

69
00:02:57,210 --> 00:03:01,290
got this into four blocks and you can

70
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,510
see here could be four blocks block

71
00:03:01,290 --> 00:03:08,310
block block block storage water both

72
00:03:06,510 --> 00:03:11,250
five thousand liters of water

73
00:03:08,310 --> 00:03:13,350
they're plumbed up in series of years so

74
00:03:11,250 --> 00:03:15,780
they're both gonna come into it we're

75
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,850
gonna put off filter are difficult to in

76
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:20,850
line over here which is gonna run down

77
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:24,120
here into our garden and then it runs

78
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:26,760
along here this for Timo comes down into

79
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:30,750
the middle hostel our lemongrass and

80
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:32,640
Homer Inga's and then basically splits

81
00:03:30,750 --> 00:03:35,850
the garden down here and we got two taps

82
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:41,550
on this but back to the photo so this

83
00:03:35,850 --> 00:03:44,970
filter this is a basic dust filter what

84
00:03:41,550 --> 00:03:46,890
the flow is in one way comes around here

85
00:03:44,970 --> 00:03:49,230
and has to go through this disk system

86
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:52,200
before it comes out the other side of

87
00:03:49,230 --> 00:03:53,730
the filter obeah and what I want to show

88
00:03:52,200 --> 00:03:56,970
you is on this filter I don't know if

89
00:03:53,730 --> 00:04:00,480
you're gonna get great focus but you can

90
00:03:56,970 --> 00:04:04,860
see this ribbing so teeth on these

91
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:07,800
things when we tighten this up and if it

92
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:10,410
closes up all together what you end up

93
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,620
with is a hundred and thirty micron

94
00:04:10,410 --> 00:04:16,020
filtration through this disk so that's

95
00:04:13,620 --> 00:04:17,820
gonna hopefully stop any of our metals

96
00:04:16,020 --> 00:04:19,410
from clogging up you know what it comes

97
00:04:17,820 --> 00:04:21,459
down here we're gonna get to our first

98
00:04:19,410 --> 00:04:23,289
forty mo 32 reducing

99
00:04:21,459 --> 00:04:26,770
tea we're gonna come out of here and

100
00:04:23,289 --> 00:04:28,360
that reducing tea into a 32 mo are 32

101
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,639
mullahs hanging around our sub main up

102
00:04:28,360 --> 00:04:33,220
and down so that way and this way along

103
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,800
these beds on that sub main we're gonna

104
00:04:33,220 --> 00:04:38,889
manage it through these ball valves so

105
00:04:35,800 --> 00:04:40,599
the set up of six beds across this is

106
00:04:38,889 --> 00:04:42,759
gonna be managed through the single ball

107
00:04:40,599 --> 00:04:45,160
valve I said it would be easy you just

108
00:04:42,759 --> 00:04:46,509
drill a little 8 mo hole and you stick

109
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:48,460
this little tip of key through one of

110
00:04:46,509 --> 00:04:52,210
those holes in there and then you

111
00:04:48,460 --> 00:04:58,660
tighten up this nut over here tighten up

112
00:04:52,210 --> 00:05:01,289
the nut so that it comes up against ends

113
00:04:58,660 --> 00:05:03,789
up against the plastic closing it off

114
00:05:01,289 --> 00:05:07,240
problem with the system that I'm finding

115
00:05:03,789 --> 00:05:09,280
is that you can't just push this little

116
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:13,110
paper key through one of these through

117
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,110
one of these holes over here because

118
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,940
I've never owned one of these things

119
00:05:20,990 --> 00:05:25,829
[Music]

120
00:05:37,740 --> 00:05:44,919
that's it looks like it's it it's in

121
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:47,669
anyways it looks like I needed a tin

122
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:55,780
mole bit on the end of my drill

123
00:05:47,669 --> 00:05:58,210
give me so that's basically it put two

124
00:05:55,780 --> 00:06:01,469
drop lines into each bed running the

125
00:05:58,210 --> 00:06:04,599
length of the beds which are 10 meters

126
00:06:01,469 --> 00:06:06,460
but now the strip line I haven't opened

127
00:06:04,599 --> 00:06:15,570
it - hang on a second here let's pull

128
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:15,570
this guy yeah girl Susan brighten up

129
00:06:15,650 --> 00:06:20,550
so that's what our drip lines are like

130
00:06:18,509 --> 00:06:22,380
and you can see underneath is sort of

131
00:06:20,550 --> 00:06:27,389
like a square underneath that hole a

132
00:06:22,380 --> 00:06:28,410
Sackman oblak some who I liked so

133
00:06:27,389 --> 00:06:30,780
there's really the square in a Neath

134
00:06:28,410 --> 00:06:33,270
that hole and inside that you can see

135
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:35,789
that little molded inline emitter and

136
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:39,479
there's actually a molded in my little

137
00:06:35,789 --> 00:06:42,150
filter inside there to help minimize any

138
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:44,190
other block because we might get thanks

139
00:06:42,150 --> 00:06:47,990
I could cross you guys at legions for

140
00:06:44,190 --> 00:06:50,490
supplying this so that's the basic setup

141
00:06:47,990 --> 00:06:54,270
each blocks can be controlled by single

142
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:56,460
valve six bits per block and that's what

143
00:06:54,270 --> 00:06:59,990
we're going to do there but I probably

144
00:06:56,460 --> 00:06:59,990
fixed my broadfork

145
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:21,050

151
00:07:54,699 --> 00:07:59,150
as well I just want to give you guys a

152
00:07:57,050 --> 00:08:03,319
any of you not as well this up they like

153
00:07:59,150 --> 00:08:05,720
me a little took the secret to welding

154
00:08:03,319 --> 00:08:07,220
to teaching the welding demons and the

155
00:08:05,720 --> 00:08:08,900
most important thing is camouflaging

156
00:08:07,220 --> 00:08:11,659
yourself so you can see I'm wearing

157
00:08:08,900 --> 00:08:15,229
green to camouflage the metal and blue

158
00:08:11,659 --> 00:08:17,930
to matte blend in with the UV are so

159
00:08:15,229 --> 00:08:19,370
make sure that your shirt is the same

160
00:08:17,930 --> 00:08:22,060
colors metal you're working on and

161
00:08:19,370 --> 00:08:22,060
you're wearing a blue jacket

[Music]

164
00:09:17,149 --> 00:09:22,829
so is the basic tech we've just got to

165
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,620
put it on both sides of the year so it

166
00:09:22,829 --> 00:09:27,810
doesn't walk what I'm gonna do now is go

167
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:30,570
ahead and tack the other side a couple

168
00:09:27,810 --> 00:09:32,310
of times and then run a deep world on to

169
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:39,759
this to close it up

170

180
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:38,550
anyways guys that's started for me in

181
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,949
this so let's go outside have a look and

182
00:10:38,550 --> 00:10:44,249
see and we're gonna put this drip

183
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:45,779
irrigation and then that's gonna be it

184
00:10:44,249 --> 00:11:10,980
