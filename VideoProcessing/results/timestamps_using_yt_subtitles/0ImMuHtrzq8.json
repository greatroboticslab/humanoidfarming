  "text": "hey welcome back to good works tractors got a good one for you today talking about the five worst tractors you can buy 2022 edition we did a video a year and a half ago give or take and cover the five worst compact tractors you can buy however we're gonna give you a different spin on that today different angle now i'd encourage you check that video out if you haven't seen it we're going to give you the specific models in that video today's video is a little bit different perspective on that to try to help you avoid those pitfalls making a bad decision attractive purchase is a big decision you don't want to make the wrong one so stick around we'll point you straight hey really quick we are proud to be sponsored by borah wheel spacers tractors are naturally tippy side to side so if you've had that experience you want to make sure it doesn't happen again i'd encourage you to check out borah link down below and we'd love to have you join the family subscribe it's completely free hit that button down below you'll get notified of new videos that come out we have over 450 videos out there already so a lot of stuff for you to take a look at if you are in the market for something for your tractor we sell and ship tractor attachments all over the country visit goodworkstractors.com all right well let's get this party started you know what i want to start off on a high note i don't want to be a debbie downer just talk about the bad stuff so i want to give some love to the sub compact tractors in general those are one of my absolute favorite sub markets the subcompact submarket that's out there today they have kind of revolutionized and just transformed the whole compact tractor world in general the 1025r i think is leading the charge with innovation the ease of connection of their loader of their bucket of their mower deck of their backhoe just all around is just top notch the kubota bx is right on its heels really coming out with some good innovations but for me the 10 25 is second to none all right we gave you something sweet it's time to take that medicine here we go now make sure you stick around because there are two tractors that are going to be on this list that i would not take if they were free and i refuse to sell them anymore at my dealership before we get to that i want to share something about the tractor industry in general you know something a lot of us don't really know you see it come up on forums from time to time but there's really very few parent manufacturers there's a lot of tractor brands that are out there but they all roll up to just a handful of actual manufacturers that are making the chassis the transmission and the engines all right to give you a few examples of what i'm talking about let's talk about the manufacturer de dong which is a korean company they are the parent manufacturer of the brand their primary brand i would say which is coyote in fact they are now manufacturing the recently reintroduced bobcat line of compact tractors and they also had their name on the mccormick lineup as well now they may not produce every single model within another brand's lineup but they are going to have their fingers on it tym is another interesting one of course they do have their own brand but they are also making tractors for branson for rural king they used to make them for cabela's bad boy the list goes on there's a lot of other smaller manufacturers as well that they white label for it's just interesting to know how one company can represent so many sub brands and then we're going to have another pretty good sized company lsm trim which of course is going to make the ls lineup of tractors but they also have their fingers on the cnh brands as well so your case tractors your new holland tractors mccormick farm trax some other brands and again this is not all of their tractors that they're making but there could be certain series certain sub compacts or compact models that they have and this isn't necessarily a bad thing because it means that perhaps if you have one of these other dealers that are near you maybe you have a new holland but you have an ls tractor i had this happen a while back i actually purchased an ls tractor i think it was a 47 48 horsepower tractor it came with a new holland manual and the parts were one for one the identical the same exact thing so it could work to your advantage to have one of these brands that works with a lot of different white label partners that they have because it can make it a lot easier for you to find parts if needed and there is one that a lot of john deere haters like to point to as well which is that yanmar makes attractors for john deere well i do know that for a short period of time in history i think it was the early 2000s that was the case yanmar was making the tractors for john deere but that's not the case anymore yes yanmar does supply the engines and they've supplied the engines for pretty much every john deere compact for decades and decades they're an excellent top-tier diesel engine manufacturer and you should be proud to have one in your tractor but the persistent comment that yanmar is still making john deere tractors just simply isn't true and it's getting kind of old guys okay so first up on the list we're going to combine these two groups which are going to be rental tractors and auction tractors i've seen my fair share of rental tractors over the years and i can tell you one thing's for sure they don't get worked very easy you have all sorts of different operators that are on there running for a weekend running for a day renting for a couple hours maybe a week whatever it is they don't care they're just working it to get their job done they have varying levels of experience with the equipment now most quality rental companies do have good mechanics on hand they service they inspect they repair they're on a good program to make sure it's maintained as needed but still that doesn't diminish the fact that you have so many different operators so many different scenarios that that tractor is being used in for me that is a situation i want to avoid now oftentimes you find those tractors going up for auction and that kind of ties us into that but typically if you're seeing tractors going on auction that means that they've been sitting on a dealer lot or some other location for a period of time and no matter what they do when they lower that price they're not able to get it sold and typically at some point that sales manager is going to say i want to get it off my books and clear it out and they're going to take it to auction and let it sell for whatever it goes for but if they couldn't get it sold while it was on their dealer lot there's got to be a reason for it and typically it is not going to be the price it's going to mean that there's something else going on with it there and for me i don't want to inherit those problems now i used to buy tractors on rare occasion from auctions if i wanted to get a certain series or a certain model in and i've all but eliminated that i haven't bought a tractor from an auction in years anymore i found that you don't get very good deals out there i found that many auctions put a surcharge or a buyer's fee or some kind of a premium that can be anywhere from 10 to 20 depending what it is which is just gonna drive that price up even higher i think that's something that a lot of buyers go into it not realizing as well now it's not that you can't find a steal of a deal from time to time at an auction but for the most part they are so popular there's so many guys that know what they're doing you're just not gonna find those great values okay next up pretty much everybody in the compact tractor market wants a tractor with a loader of the hundreds or maybe it's thousands of tractors that i've sold over the years i can think of two of them that guys did not want the loaders on that we removed the loaders took them off and sold those separately every other tractor has had a loader sold with it sometimes we've bought tractors and then added the loaders ourselves to them if we can make the numbers work but that's very challenging and i always encourage folks do not buy a tractor i just had this conversation with a gentleman the other day he found a gem of a deal a beautiful john deere 790 tractor but it didn't have a front end loader on it you can't buy a new one you can get a new aftermarket but if you're looking in the used market you're trying to save some money so if you're saving money on a used tractor you want to find a nice used loader to match up with that and have your savings all around well it's almost like finding a needle in a haystack when you're trying to find a used loader to match your tractor typically you don't want to have that shipped in so it has to be within driving distance of where you're at it needs to include the right brackets all the right components to go along with it and then of course the price has to be right too and if you're looking at something a little bit older like that john deere 790 it's not made anymore there's no replacement series that have a compatible loader to put on there that means that all those folks that have a john deere 790 without a loader are constantly keeping eyeballs on the market looking all over craigslist and facebook to try to see if one pops up in their area so it's gonna drive the price up you're gonna have to jump on it right away it can be a long and tedious search so using the 790 as an example all those folks out there in the market right now that have that tractor model without a loader are constantly checking the market on craigslist and facebook to see what's out there what's available that's going to drive the costs up i've heard of guys searching for months and months sometimes years and years just to find a loader to add onto their tractor trust me you're going to be a lot better off passing on that 790 without the loader to find the right machine with a loader already on it you're going to be a lot happier now on top of loaders you got to make sure you have a quick attached connection between the end of that loader and your bucket you do not want to have a pin that bucket it's another item i'm asked about constantly which is can you sell me a conversion kit to make my pin bucket into a quick attach whether that's john deere or skid steer quick attach it's a very expensive proposition to do that after the fact if you're ordering new try to get that option built right in don't get one of the goofy quick attaches that some of these manufacturers offer stick with the big ones primarily the skid steer quick attach and even if you're looking in the used market as well pay close attention ask that question if you can't clearly see it in the pictures make sure you have a quick attached bucket that's going to allow you to put on a set of pellet forks a snow pusher a grapple a bail spear all sorts of different attachments very quickly and easily it's going to open up a lot of options you won't regret it now i'm as big a fan of old tractors as the next guy there's just something about a classic tractor chris and i grew up with a ford eight and a nine end up at my grandpa's farm but you know what those old timers just had a special skill set that unfortunately i did not inherit and so a lot of you guys out there you get nostalgic i think right you see these cheaper price points of tractors like that eight ended at nine and you think that's what i want to have the downside is is that they typically require more maintenance than modern tractors and so you need to have that skill set but you also need to have the ability to get those replacement parts when you need to which can be harder and harder to find but as with anything typically if it's going to be older it's going to have more downtime which means you're spending more of your time working on your tractor instead of working with your tractor getting your projects done and i get a lot of folks i want to trade those tractors in on the newer tractors that i sell and i don't want to take those on trading you know we want to sell clean lower equipment here we're very specific on what we want to carry so this isn't knocking those older tractors if you're a handy guy and you can figure it out i'd encourage you to get one but for a lot of folks these days that are just now moving out to the country they weren't blessed with that skill set just like i'm not so i'd stick to the modern day tractors now on that note even for you guys buying the newer tractors whether that's john deere kubota coyote mahindra ls bobcat you name it you still want to have that dealer support that's nearby these newer tractors have longer warranties on them long powertrain warranties many of them are five six seven years long so if something does go wrong you want to be able to take it in quickly to your dealer that's hopefully not 100 or 200 miles away have them repair under warranty minimize the cost to you out of pocket you know if you don't want to handle your service on your own as well it's nice to have them right around the corner at least in the next town over so you can take it in there have those oil changes the regular maintenance done now fortunately in the day and age that we live in if you can handle the simple maintenance yourself which a lot of you guys can with greasing with oil changes and air filters and whatnot for most of us these tractors are typically going to require one major service interval a year which can be done on a saturday afternoon and one of our gwt discount club members 247parts.com is an online john deere dealer that carries all sorts of those parts for your service for accessories for whatever you need you're going to visit their website 24 247parts.com you enter code gwt you're going to get your savings they'll ship it right to you all right now i promised you a couple of specific models and these are going to carry over from that old video these still remain true i want to make sure that you avoid these tractors i know you're going to hear some folks out there that don't have an issue but this is a big chunk of money that you're spending on a tractor and i think there's so many other models out there so many similar models that you can avoid these ones if you find a good deal on it it's a good deal for a reason okay so the first model that you want to avoid if you can is the kubota b3350 just google that model kubota b3350 and then put the word problems after it you're gonna have hours of reading material they just have issues up and down the board with their dpf their regen it's just a constant battle yes there's some stories of it being covered under warranty but there's a lot more stories of it not being covered under warranty if you want to get that series but save a little bit of money look for the kubota b2650 or you can look at the new generation now the kubota lx series the lx 2610 and the lx 3310 both of those are going to perform very well for you just do yourself a favor and avoid the 3350. now john deere's not off the hook here either they do have a problem child of their own and i was bit by this one myself several years ago in fact i had a john deere 2320 and had that model that specific tractor sold actually i was still working out of this garage we're standing in right now at my house and i had just taken that tractor moved around to the back of the house to get it out of the way for a little bit of time when i went to turn that tractor back on and move it back up this way guess what i heard a loud clanking noise right underneath the floorboard i turned the tractor off i hopped off and looked underneath and there was just hydraulic oil spilling down i had sheared off the drive shaft where the u-joint is at and the way that mine broke just happened to break inside the trans axle so this turned out to be over a four thousand dollar repair i had to notify the customer who had bought the tractor but not taken delivery yet and in turn they wanted to cancel that i don't blame them at all and i sold that tractor for parts to somebody handy who could fix it on their own and another john deere model that had similar problems for a few years was the john deere 2305 so again 2320 2305 do your homework on those if they had the u joints replaced it's not going to be much of an issue the problem was that there was no instruction in the manual that told owners to grease those u-joints which were tucked way up underneath there there was no easy way to access it no way to really know about it and so they would dry out they would seize up they would fail mine just happened to fail in the most expensive way so again i'd encourage you just plug those models in and type the word problems after you're going to have all sorts of reading material you know if you think the deal is too good to be true there's probably a reason why it's priced so low just to get rid of it and at the very least ask that seller the questions ask them if these parts were replaced what the service history was like what they know about it because maybe they did something to correct that problem ahead of time but the last thing you want to do is get yourself into an unknown all right guys well i hope you enjoyed that and it helps you out with your tractor buying purchase if you want to learn more about tractors make sure you hit that subscribe button and check
