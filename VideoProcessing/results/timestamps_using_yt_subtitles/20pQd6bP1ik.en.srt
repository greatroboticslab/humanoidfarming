inventory turn to our dealerships one of

12
00:00:44,430 --> 00:00:50,580
the ways we do it well very aggressive

13
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:53,220
marketing weekly ads statewide or

14
00:00:50,580 --> 00:00:55,800
internet presence we try to push real

15
00:00:53,220 --> 00:00:57,600
hard and once a year at least once a

16
00:00:55,800 --> 00:00:59,250
year we have a used equipment auction

17
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,500
we've been running used equipment

18
00:00:59,250 --> 00:01:05,610
auctions through our dealership for many

19
00:01:01,500 --> 00:01:07,920
many years it's a way of freeing up some

20
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,810
capital and getting rid of that you

21
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:14,130
knows cleaning out the yard make room

22
00:01:09,810 --> 00:01:19,770
for new stuff we generally manage the

23
00:01:14,130 --> 00:01:23,030
the auctions ourselves we hire good

24
00:01:19,770 --> 00:01:25,500
auctioneers we Clerk them ourselves and

25
00:01:23,030 --> 00:01:28,250
cashier em ourselves and so it takes

26
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:32,850
some of the expense out I like to

27
00:01:28,250 --> 00:01:35,160
control the advertising myself i doing

28
00:01:32,850 --> 00:01:39,330
auctions so many years kind of know what

29
00:01:35,160 --> 00:01:42,030
I think our market is and overall it

30
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:44,280
gives us an opportunity to get a real

31
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,010
good handle on what use equipment values

32
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,320
are sometimes we lose money sometimes we

33
00:01:47,010 --> 00:01:49,680
make money it's all part of the deal

34
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:52,740
here

35
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,100
but but I'm a firm believer in the

36
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:55,100
auction process
