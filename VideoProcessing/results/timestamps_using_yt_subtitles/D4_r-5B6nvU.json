  "text": "so in the last video we showed you how we transferred the water from the well stream into the tote and in today's video we're going to show you how we get that water out of the tote in in the garden beds so hope you enjoy this video [Music] alright so you saw how we set up the the transfer pump the main pump that pumps to the tote and now i'm going to show you how we take that water in the tote and then pump it onto all of these crops over here so this pumping station just like the other pumping station also runs off of a solar panel so another 100 watt ranology panel and that is wired to a charge controller i'm going to show you so there's my charge controller this is a rinology one we have bought two and this one's the waterproof one the other one we had before was not waterproof and didn't work out correctly [Music] and then this rinology charge controller there's the negative and the plus for the solar and on the back of your panel you've got two terminals a negative and a positive [Music] so that is how that's wired to the charge controller so now the power from the sun is going from this solar panel into the charge controller and then to this battery system here and how that's possible is there's a plus and a negative here where the battery goes and you can see there's a positive and a negative terminal on my battery okay and then this battery is how we're getting power from that pump so here's the pump so it's a sea flow pump it's a water pressure pump it's a 12 volt pump every this is a 12 volt system and it produces about 5.5 gallons per minute and the flow is great [Music] so all you have to do to wire this pump to your battery is this is an old extension cord wire we just cut it we took the black and the white wire put the white on the black out terminal and the black on the red terminal these are your plus and your minus that come off this battery and then you can see it just goes and goes and goes and then here's my terminals my negative my plus here my negative here and all we're doing is we're taking a bolt [Music] on the other end of on the other end of the extension cord we've got that same uh black and white wire the black goes in the positive side what we do is we take our nut here and we put the nut [Music] over the terminal right nice and tight same thing we do over here and then this turns on this is your inlet pump here so this is connected inside of the tote and that's pulling the water out of the tote through the pump but it's got to go through this filter first let's take this off [Music] okay [Music] so there's your filter see what sort of stuff we got in here pretty nasty in there probably time for a cleaning so then it gets filtered so then it goes through this this filter here into the pump and then your outlet side and then the outlet is the garden hose so i'm going to show you right now where this goes to now let's go over to follow the cord here here it is [Music] [Applause] there you go you can see the pressure is real nice [Music] no sort of delays in the pressure and all we're doing is just watering and this is how we water all of our beds we hand water it next year we will not be hand watering next year we're going to try to switch over to a easier method for watering such as irrigation i know our first year and we hand watered everything are are we crazy i feel like we are so pretty simple setup you know that's how we're doing everything with the solar powered uh pumping station you saw the other solar panel on the transfer pump now you're seeing the second station here next to the tote and then now you're seeing all the water that's in the tote get out of the tote and end up in those garden beds so hope you enjoyed this hopefully you learned a little something make sure to like this video if you thought it was cool subscribe to our channel give this video a little like and uh drop us a comment let us know maybe we can help you out alright we'll see on the next one bye [Music] [Music] you",
