1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,160
so we're using a John Deere 1025r with

2
00:00:02,700 --> 00:00:05,880
an ideal 48 inch tiller on the back and

3
00:00:05,160 --> 00:00:08,400
so

4
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,380
any subcompact tractor you know your 20

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:12,120
to 25 horsepower range or typically what

6
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:13,980
you're going to see using a 48 inch

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:15,719
tiller about the same width as the

8
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:18,660
tractor but all your Kubota BX series

9
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,699
your massive subcompacts coyote New

10
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,800
Holland LS you're basically going to run

11
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:24,420
a 48 inch Taylor at 60 inch is just too

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,980
large so this is breaking new ground

13
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:27,599
here and so we're going to go over this

14
00:00:25,980 --> 00:00:29,580
multiple passes because we're gonna go

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,439
down and back for the first handful of

16
00:00:29,580 --> 00:00:32,820
passes and and show you what that looks

17
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,680
like and then at the very last pass

18
00:00:32,820 --> 00:00:36,780
we're going to go down back down back so

19
00:00:34,680 --> 00:00:38,460
for four total passes show you the

20
00:00:36,780 --> 00:00:40,260
difference it's breaking up chopping up

21
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,480
all the side all the grass all the roots

22
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,800
that are up on top a few rocks here and

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:45,480
there that you're going to see but in

24
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:46,860
subsequent years once you have that side

25
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:48,899
broken up you're not going to have to go

26
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,420
over it nearly as often to have really

27
00:00:48,899 --> 00:00:53,160
great and consistent results but in the

28
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:54,840
beginning if you're putting in a brand

29
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:55,980
new Garden or a brand new food plot

30
00:00:54,840 --> 00:00:57,660
you're probably gonna have to spend a

31
00:00:55,980 --> 00:01:00,860
little bit more time that first year

32
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:00,860
getting everything established
