1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:06,560
thank you Jason uh I'm like Ray uh the

2
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:09,440
word noil does not on my slide I start

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,480
with the word residue first it's residue

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,240
that protects the soil it's residue

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:16,199
that's helping feed the soil system it's

6
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,160
residue is what I want to keep out there

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:19,560
now Dwayne's talking after me so I'm not

8
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,840
sure what all he's going to cover but I

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:22,880
had the benefit of watching these three

10
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,920
guys in front of me to know what they're

11
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:26,880
talked about and I actually had two

12
00:00:24,920 --> 00:00:30,000
different presentations loaded for

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,480
today and the one was a more in-depth on

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,760
cover crops how to and what all all it

15
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,200
can do for you the other was more for

16
00:00:34,760 --> 00:00:39,000
them the residue and soil structure well

17
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:41,640
in the original program came

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:43,520
out Jim Herman was going to talk more

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:44,920
about cover crops what' he do he

20
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:47,320
switched more to soil biology and I'm

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:48,320
like or soil compaction so I'm like all

22
00:00:47,320 --> 00:00:50,320
right which

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:53,079
presentation this is a

24
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,600
blend it's called adjust on the go the

25
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:58,039
beauty of PowerPoint and computer so

26
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:59,600
anyway when it comes down to it I make a

27
00:00:58,039 --> 00:01:02,320
statement Point Blank Jim talked about

28
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,879
so compaction statement point blank is

29
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,640
tillage has never built soil structure

30
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,680
tillage destroys the existing soil

31
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,400
structure now if you got a bad structure

32
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:11,840
like compaction and you can reach it

33
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,080
with your tillage implant and you break

34
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:18,400
up the soil structure the bad compaction

35
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,960
that's good right but what if you have a

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:22,240
good structure or what if you have the

37
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:23,680
compassion and you break that up you

38
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:25,640
broke up all the structures there the

39
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,720
next pass in the field can create more

40
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:29,640
compaction it's a vicious circle when it

41
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:31,000
comes to tillage but when I look at

42
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:33,840
tillage and I started thinking about

43
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:35,880
Water Management years ago there's some

44
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,240
researchers saying studying the soil

45
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:39,280
said you know the average silt B soil

46
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,360
holds 2 inch of water per foot you tell

47
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:43,399
it 6 inches deep that's one inch water

48
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,759
affected about half of it goes away

49
00:01:43,399 --> 00:01:48,560
that's how these kind of numbers show up

50
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:50,479
now half inch in an average year before

51
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:51,560
planting who cares maybe I have

52
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:53,479
irrigation maybe I got another spring

53
00:01:51,560 --> 00:01:55,200
rain coming maybe the soil's too wet

54
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,960
anyway and you got to till it to dry it

55
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,000
out you've all heard that never do that

56
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:01,399
by the way but when you start thinking

57
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,200
about it what if we did in the olden

58
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,360
days there was three four tillage passes

59
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,719
half inch per trip we dried out 2 Ines

60
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,319
of water remember 2 inches per foot the

61
00:02:07,719 --> 00:02:10,679
olden days everybody had fur openers and

62
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:12,360
their Planters trying to push away dry

63
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:13,480
so and clouds trying to find moisture to

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:17,000
plant

65
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:19,120
into that's expensive half inch per trip

66
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:21,040
now very few of us do four trips anymore

67
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,480
pre-plan you know some guys are down on

68
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,959
one trip some guys are one in the fall

69
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,280
one in the spring whatever but I start

70
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:29,200
looking at that where's my residue

71
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:31,080
where's my so biological life think

72
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:33,040
about what else is going on out there

73
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:34,680
without residue there to keep the wind

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,080
off Sol surf we have wind erosion

75
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:39,200
problems without residue there absorb

76
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,599
raindrop impact that energy detaches

77
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:42,720
those solil particles then they start

78
00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:44,840
washing on us you we still got a triple

79
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,319
whammy here we got the yellow

80
00:02:44,840 --> 00:02:47,959
unproductive soil up there because all

81
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:49,879
the good stuff washed away we got the

82
00:02:47,959 --> 00:02:51,720
gullies there where washed out crop cut

83
00:02:49,879 --> 00:02:53,879
some gullies h on the sprayer going

84
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:54,959
across them down at the bottom sealed in

85
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,080
some

86
00:02:54,959 --> 00:03:00,000
crop that's all because of lack of

87
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,959
residue to absorb Rain Drive Impact and

88
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,640
a lack of soil structure to let the

89
00:03:01,959 --> 00:03:07,599
water soak in where it lands and again

90
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:09,519
tillage erases all that so we want to go

91
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,760
away from the tillage now even if you

92
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:13,720
don't have slopes and erosion problems

93
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,959
there's still an infiltration problem

94
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:17,280
you know I growing up many many years

95
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:19,280
ago in northeast Nebraska I thought it

96
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,959
was great to have a crust in the

97
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:24,560
soil dad put me out on the tractor says

98
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,720
you get to drive 10 m hour the rotary

99
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:30,280
hole trying to break that

100
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,640
up wait a minute that's not great

101
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:32,959
when you look at that you know this

102
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,400
farmer is digging in screwdriving and if

103
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,879
you know where to look you can almost

104
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,159
see corn plants trying to come through

105
00:03:35,879 --> 00:03:39,560
there I look at the other wave cop can't

106
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,840
get up more importantly the water can't

107
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,480
get in if water can't get in it's going

108
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:45,920
to run off so again I want to build

109
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:48,360
structure now I say this is many years

110
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:50,280
ago uh we got Farmers now that cut way

111
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:52,000
back on tillage they're leaving residue

112
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:54,239
out there we had to the 85 Farm Bill

113
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,200
said residue cover it's going to solve

114
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,239
our erosion problems it didn't quite it

115
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:01,400
helped but when it comes down to it

116
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:04,840
we're still doing ourselves a favor when

117
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:07,200
it comes to soil structure 1981 I

118
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:09,239
received a grant for three years to

119
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,079
study different tillage systems I

120
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:13,159
actually started working with noil in 78

121
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,480
with my Master's thesis in 81

122
00:04:13,159 --> 00:04:16,759
established a set of plots Southeast

123
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,840
Nebraska about 10 miles east of Lincoln

124
00:04:16,759 --> 00:04:22,759
to Sly clay LOM soil and Dryland and at

125
00:04:20,840 --> 00:04:25,520
that time grain sorum soybeans were

126
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:26,919
popular crops for Dryland Nebraska Corn

127
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,360
varieties weren't quite there yet for

128
00:04:26,919 --> 00:04:31,039
that location of the state so I did

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,520
grain start sing rotation for a number

130
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,360
of years this picture was taken about

131
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:37,000
the

132
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,080
mid90s I loved no till I loved the

133
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:42,880
residue now remember I started no

134
00:04:39,080 --> 00:04:44,199
tilling back before we had cheap glyos

135
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,479
you know at that time Roundup was only

136
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:49,240
about $100 a gallon I learned a no tail

137
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:52,000
without that now be truthful today I do

138
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:55,039
love Roundup Ready beans as such I hate

139
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,440
Roundup Ready corn with my crop rotation

140
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:59,080
I don't want to use Round Up in the corn

141
00:04:56,440 --> 00:05:00,560
year we don't and I don't because we put

142
00:04:59,080 --> 00:05:02,240
down our early pre-plant get it rained

143
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:04,000
in and activated and that's what we

144
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,120
learned back in the 80s when we didn't

145
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,960
have all the post emerged products our

146
00:05:06,120 --> 00:05:09,880
pre-emerge products rained in couple

147
00:05:07,960 --> 00:05:11,360
weeks had of planting when I plant all

148
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:14,400
my moisture all my nutrients are there

149
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,199
for my crop weeds haven't been using

150
00:05:14,400 --> 00:05:18,720
them the other thing is I love the

151
00:05:16,199 --> 00:05:20,400
residue every Bean is up and growing

152
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:21,560
because the soil moisture was protected

153
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,880
it's not going to crust not going to

154
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:25,280
wash out not going to dry out in the

155
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:26,759
tilled side there's some beans under

156
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,560
crust or some beans in dry soil some

157
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,120
beans never going to grow but when it

158
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,080
really comes to soil health take a look

159
00:05:30,120 --> 00:05:34,919
at the average elevation of this soil

160
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:38,120
surface compared to this over here

161
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:39,560
there's about a 4 in Step there that

162
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,240
many years of tillage compared to that

163
00:05:39,560 --> 00:05:43,800
many years of not

164
00:05:41,240 --> 00:05:46,039
tilling Jim talked about it sand silt

165
00:05:43,800 --> 00:05:48,919
and Clays and organic materials those

166
00:05:46,039 --> 00:05:51,440
are our solids in the soil the air space

167
00:05:48,919 --> 00:05:53,880
the POR space is air and water should be

168
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,600
about half por space half solids as I

169
00:05:53,880 --> 00:05:58,000
come through doing tillage I break up

170
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:00,639
the soil structure the solids are not

171
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,440
compressed what happens is the pores are

172
00:06:00,639 --> 00:06:04,319
squeezed out of the soil particles

173
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:07,400
between them and what happens is they

174
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:09,759
reappear on top a lack of soil structure

175
00:06:07,400 --> 00:06:11,960
this soil is denser than this this soil

176
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,680
has less pore space those less pores

177
00:06:11,960 --> 00:06:15,199
fill up with water quicker soil gets

178
00:06:13,680 --> 00:06:16,960
saturated quicker and worse than that it

179
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:19,360
dries out quicker because you don't have

180
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,720
the storage there and so a lot of guys

181
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:23,080
with Tilly say well my soils are too wet

182
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:24,240
well they're too wet for a couple days

183
00:06:23,080 --> 00:06:27,000
and they're too dry in the next couple

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,199
of days no mine is a lot more buffered

185
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,319
and that's what I like about soil

186
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,520
structure and again lot of guys say well

187
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:35,280
no tail it has to be continuous no tail

188
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:37,800
to get the soil Health has to be a

189
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,039
continuously fed soil system to get the

190
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:41,520
soil Health you know the year he planted

191
00:06:40,039 --> 00:06:43,759
this corn no tilling to the bean residue

192
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,400
yes he saved trips not doing till saved

193
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,919
some fuel save some labor but that's

194
00:06:45,400 --> 00:06:48,400
still a till soil when it comes to

195
00:06:46,919 --> 00:06:50,120
crusting when it comes to runoff when it

196
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,960
comes to lack of infiltration when it

197
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:54,160
comes to lack of so biological life so

198
00:06:51,960 --> 00:06:55,879
it's continuous no till it does it and

199
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,479
here's an example of about 12 years

200
00:06:55,879 --> 00:06:59,120
continuous no till here we can see some

201
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,360
good PS and Aggregates like Ray talked

202
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:03,720
about we can see where water can soak in

203
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,400
we can see where Roots can penetrate

204
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,039
walked across the fence this is the same

205
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:09,520
soil type continuous tillage you can

206
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:11,639
imagine Heavy Rain you can see why we

207
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,599
get runoff or flat soils you can see why

208
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:14,919
we get

209
00:07:12,599 --> 00:07:17,039
ponding again I want to build that soil

210
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,160
structure to get that healthy soil out

211
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:22,160
there again the tillage destroys it

212
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:23,759
rapidly you know the disc is one of the

213
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:26,039
worst offenders that was to developed as

214
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,720
a compaction tool to build roads to BU

215
00:07:26,039 --> 00:07:30,160
break up existing solil structure and

216
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:32,240
create a subgrade compaction layer to

217
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,919
build a road I don't know why we thought

218
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:35,840
we could use it in farming systems but

219
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,280
when you start thinking about it again I

220
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:40,000
showed this for compaction uh Jim talked

221
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,960
about compaction the full width tailing

222
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,560
compaction you hardly ever see I saw it

223
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:46,360
because I had no tail next to it Jim

224
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:48,400
said compare it to your fence row you

225
00:07:46,360 --> 00:07:50,599
can see how that's been beat down yes it

226
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:51,800
looks like it's been fluffed up but that

227
00:07:50,599 --> 00:07:53,639
weight of that disc has been carried

228
00:07:51,800 --> 00:07:55,680
underneath and on wet soils the wet soil

229
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:58,159
particles are lubricated they compact

230
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:59,240
more easily again earlier I said you may

231
00:07:58,159 --> 00:08:01,520
have heard it say I got to till that

232
00:07:59,240 --> 00:08:02,840
what Sol dried out it's exactly the

233
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:05,280
worst time to till it when it comes to

234
00:08:02,840 --> 00:08:06,840
soil health because it does destroy soil

235
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,639
structure now some people say I'm going

236
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,440
to till shallower I'm G get one of these

237
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,240
new colder tillage tools that's exactly

238
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,400
the worst layer to till that's the one

239
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:16,319
with your Sol biological life you're

240
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:17,280
trying to build why destroy that and

241
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,080
then pack below it where you're trying

242
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:20,520
to put the seed the other form of

243
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,120
compaction is shown back here wheel

244
00:08:20,520 --> 00:08:25,360
traffic compaction typically Wheel

245
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
tracks are as deep as you till because

246
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:29,520
again till you erase soil structure

247
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:31,720
there's nothing there to support you so

248
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,599
again it's a vicious circle here now

249
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:37,000
wheel traffic compaction larger tires

250
00:08:34,599 --> 00:08:39,039
reduced PSI more footprint on the ground

251
00:08:37,000 --> 00:08:41,880
more axles to carry the load that's how

252
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:44,720
I reduce those and build soil structure

253
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,240
how reduce those but even if the soil's

254
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:47,080
dry you're not doing yourself a favor

255
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:50,360
doing

256
00:08:47,080 --> 00:08:51,800
tillage yes I'm breaking up clouds why

257
00:08:50,360 --> 00:08:54,240
we created them with previous tillage

258
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,560
pass now this is going to be an extreme

259
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,920
example this is a wheat F producer out

260
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:00,880
in western

261
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:02,560
Nebraska he is an organic weak fellow

262
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:04,640
producer so every time he's got a flush

263
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,120
of weeds he does another tillage trip

264
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:08,480
now earlier I said tillage doesn't build

265
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:09,839
soil structure I'm wrong tillage

266
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:12,680
actually built a soil structure that we

267
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:15,760
call massive it has taken every poor

268
00:09:12,680 --> 00:09:17,640
space out of that soil now the soil

269
00:09:15,760 --> 00:09:18,760
surface is Right Above This the residue

270
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:21,320
is just sort of hanging down into this

271
00:09:18,760 --> 00:09:22,920
hole that we dug below this he's been

272
00:09:21,320 --> 00:09:25,399
discing on his first pass and then he

273
00:09:22,920 --> 00:09:26,839
switches over sweeps and blades and we

274
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:28,519
found layers in there you could actually

275
00:09:26,839 --> 00:09:31,240
pick that up and you could find the

276
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:33,480
shmear mark from the blade the sweep or

277
00:09:31,240 --> 00:09:35,800
whatever that ran in there now depending

278
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:38,800
upon the year he had anything between 13

279
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:40,160
to about 18 19 trips for tillage on his

280
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:42,040
wheat fellow rotation because remember

281
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,240
he has about 14 months he's doing

282
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:47,120
tillage look below that layer though

283
00:09:45,240 --> 00:09:49,320
some beautiful soil structure that free

284
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:50,839
Tha weding and drying builds but you

285
00:09:49,320 --> 00:09:52,560
know what if my roots can't get there my

286
00:09:50,839 --> 00:09:54,200
water can't get there this down here

287
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:57,600
doesn't make any sense doesn't make any

288
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,320
difference don't do the tillage on top

289
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,240
organic wheat fow Ray Ward and I walked

290
00:10:00,320 --> 00:10:03,640
out there and Ray we should have paid

291
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:05,519
attention I should have made a crisper

292
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:06,959
footprint but take a look at that

293
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,000
footprint take a look at that soil take

294
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:13,160
a look at the lack of biological

295
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,160
life does it look much different than

296
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,920
that Neil Armstrong we all know there's

297
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,519
no life in the moon I'm not sure there's

298
00:10:18,920 --> 00:10:23,440
much more life in that soil is there

299
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:25,560
again we've done some dumb things at

300
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:28,720
tillage you know this is a native soil

301
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:30,600
structure out there the grass that was

302
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,399
built by having a Living Root in that

303
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:34,519
soil system that was actually growing

304
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:35,959
there 10 11 12 months a year depending

305
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,880
on where you're at what the winter is

306
00:10:35,959 --> 00:10:40,560
like and it's having a Living Root

307
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:43,160
putting carbon down in there that's the

308
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,800
darker soil we see as we lose everything

309
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:46,959
on top and as we erode that away we get

310
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:48,519
down to this again to rebuild that we

311
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:49,600
need to get carbon back down in there

312
00:10:48,519 --> 00:10:51,480
that's Roots that's going to be our

313
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,920
cover crops our cash crops it's going to

314
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:54,120
be perennial crops to rebuild it the

315
00:10:52,920 --> 00:10:56,399
fastest because perennial crops would

316
00:10:54,120 --> 00:10:58,040
sent the roots Down Deeper that's what

317
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,399
built this to start with was perennial

318
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:04,160
grasses or a mixture of trees grasses

319
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:05,600
Forbes whatever out there again let's go

320
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,680
back a little bit in history and some of

321
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,279
the dumb things we've done you know the

322
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,399
more word plow everyone says I got to

323
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,680
plow that soil to make a seed bed you

324
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:14,279
can still go to the farm progress show

325
00:11:12,680 --> 00:11:16,360
and see plows being demonstrated yes

326
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,600
they're still being sold but we start

327
00:11:16,360 --> 00:11:19,000
thinking about what we're doing we're

328
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:20,959
breaking up all the existing soil

329
00:11:19,000 --> 00:11:22,480
structure we're coming in there taking

330
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,440
that non-uniform seed bed and we're

331
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:26,360
going in there and doing discing field

332
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,360
cultivation or whatever and this is a

333
00:11:26,360 --> 00:11:31,440
real bad example here this is a at alurn

334
00:11:29,360 --> 00:11:34,440
Alabama National soil tilth lab the

335
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,519
compaction layer of the plow pan where

336
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:38,120
the plow packed below that then you can

337
00:11:36,519 --> 00:11:40,000
see some secondary pans from the discs

338
00:11:38,120 --> 00:11:42,240
and field cators you see no soil

339
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:44,639
structure up here in the root Zone look

340
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:46,480
down below though beautiful soil

341
00:11:44,639 --> 00:11:49,800
structure but again if the water and

342
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:51,600
Roots can't get to it we're in trouble

343
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:53,040
I'm an egg engineer by training egg

344
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:54,800
Engineers figured out a long time ago

345
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:57,480
you know you take a stick out here a

346
00:11:54,800 --> 00:11:58,600
shank and put it down below this layer

347
00:11:57,480 --> 00:12:01,079
and as you drag it through there it's

348
00:11:58,600 --> 00:12:03,360
going to fracture at a 50 or about a 45°

349
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,279
angle so you put it 50% deep and put

350
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:08,240
another shank over here fracture that I

351
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:10,920
can fracture I can break up the bad soil

352
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:11,839
structure compaction right the chisel

353
00:12:10,920 --> 00:12:14,959
plow was

354
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:16,079
born 12 in shank space and 12 in deep

355
00:12:14,959 --> 00:12:18,160
you go through there and you break up

356
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,320
the bad so structure of the compaction

357
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,440
of the plow layer and you come back and

358
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:26,680
you smooth it out pack it back down

359
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,680
after a few years you took

360
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:30,959
a all right which one of you two were

361
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,680
the plower and chisler these two are

362
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,560
laughing he took a plow pan from 8 in

363
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:38,880
and you make a chisel pan at 12 is that

364
00:12:36,560 --> 00:12:41,880
enough of a root Zone to graze a crop

365
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,320
in here's a photograph from someone

366
00:12:41,880 --> 00:12:46,320
sales literature where they're selling a

367
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,160
ripper and I love this when I was out

368
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,560
there doing his last tillage operation I

369
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,000
think he got stuck here and I don't know

370
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:53,600
how he got out but you can tell he had

371
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:55,160
that big white discer field cator and he

372
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,920
came and he drove around here and hung

373
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:58,920
that big wide disc or field cator over

374
00:12:56,920 --> 00:13:00,920
that wet spot I have to till it to dry

375
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:02,199
it out out he turned plenty wide so he

376
00:13:00,920 --> 00:13:04,079
wouldn't get stuck and came back and

377
00:13:02,199 --> 00:13:06,360
dried out the rest of it

378
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,639
right every time you do that you now

379
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,920
packed it tighter that next time it'll

380
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,240
stay wet longer because the water can't

381
00:13:08,920 --> 00:13:14,040
soak in I gave this presentation one

382
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:16,320
time in Ohio and I had a guy come up to

383
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:18,519
me he says I run a tile business there's

384
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:20,800
guys who have this problem that hire me

385
00:13:18,519 --> 00:13:23,480
to cut in a random tile line to drain

386
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:25,880
that wet spot I go yeah he says when I

387
00:13:23,480 --> 00:13:27,199
do that I usually cut the pattern tile

388
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:29,440
that was already

389
00:13:27,199 --> 00:13:32,519
installed and it's because they created

390
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,560
a compaction layer above the pattern

391
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:36,160
tile again I've seen it here in South

392
00:13:34,560 --> 00:13:39,079
Dakota people are putting in tile to get

393
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:41,279
rid of water I'm going like no save the

394
00:13:39,079 --> 00:13:44,279
water use the water that's not I get rid

395
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:46,440
of it well you saw the tire tracks there

396
00:13:44,279 --> 00:13:48,800
maybe I switched to tracks less

397
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,079
compaction right tracks work because of

398
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:52,399
a couple things one it is lower PSI on

399
00:13:51,079 --> 00:13:54,600
the soil surface I can do that with

400
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:56,519
inflated tires as well it's also got

401
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,959
more axles that's sort of axle one axle

402
00:13:56,519 --> 00:14:00,480
two these two together probably carry

403
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:01,759
the weight of axle three these axle for

404
00:14:00,480 --> 00:14:03,199
again think about trucks when we go to

405
00:14:01,759 --> 00:14:05,079
the field or go to the road to carry

406
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:06,959
more weight without destroying the road

407
00:14:05,079 --> 00:14:09,480
we add more axles on a truck let's do

408
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,480
that in our Fields as well I love toe

409
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:12,759
carts I love things that put more axles

410
00:14:11,480 --> 00:14:15,519
out there to carry the load because it's

411
00:14:12,759 --> 00:14:16,759
a lower weight per axle in but again

412
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:18,279
you're not doing yourself a favor if

413
00:14:16,759 --> 00:14:21,360
you're doing tail

414
00:14:18,279 --> 00:14:23,360
AG farmer friend of mine from Illinois

415
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:25,120
he's been chiseling for years he's got

416
00:14:23,360 --> 00:14:28,199
compaction layer down there about

417
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:30,680
chiseling depth Harvest time he's got

418
00:14:28,199 --> 00:14:32,279
riced tires on his combine some people

419
00:14:30,680 --> 00:14:33,680
call them logger tires if you're not

420
00:14:32,279 --> 00:14:37,240
familiar with them they're a real tall

421
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,079
lug to cut down through anybody's ever

422
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,480
put rice lug tires in their combine

423
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,000
admits two things one they admit they

424
00:14:41,480 --> 00:14:45,880
have no soil structure they need that

425
00:14:43,000 --> 00:14:47,360
deep lug to cut through the mush to cut

426
00:14:45,880 --> 00:14:48,360
down to number two they admit they have

427
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:50,360
a compaction layer and that's where

428
00:14:48,360 --> 00:14:52,639
they're going to get their

429
00:14:50,360 --> 00:14:53,839
traction now anybody brave enough to

430
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:56,079
raise your hand do have rice leg tires

431
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:56,079
in your

432
00:14:56,160 --> 00:14:59,839
combine we've done some dumb things at

433
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,000
tell guys because we're destroying our

434
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:03,880
soil

435
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:06,519
structure okay Paul pan at 8 in a chisel

436
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:08,480
pan at 12 50% deeper shank spacing

437
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:12,240
equals operating depth the V rippers

438
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:14,839
were born 18 to 20 inches deep 18 to 20

439
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:18,480
inch shank spacing and you got to like

440
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:22,000
your fuel man and buy that big

441
00:15:18,480 --> 00:15:24,040
tractor and we come along and we smooth

442
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:25,680
it all out so we can plant destroyed the

443
00:15:24,040 --> 00:15:27,839
Sol structure now we packed it

444
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,959
down you see what's coming we've done

445
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,839
some dumb things haven't we

446
00:15:29,959 --> 00:15:33,839
is 18 to 20 inches enough of a RIT

447
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:40,360
Zone that's me in my younger

448
00:15:37,759 --> 00:15:41,959
day this is that Husker Harvest days DMI

449
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,360
was showing off their new deep Ripper

450
00:15:41,959 --> 00:15:47,120
30in shank spacing that run 30 inches

451
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,759
deep remember you got to go 50% deeper

452
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:49,759
than the 20-inch

453
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,440
layer fortunately we've not seen a lot

454
00:15:53,000 --> 00:15:55,839
those Nebraska you probably haven't seen

455
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,120
too many in South Dakota because we

456
00:15:55,839 --> 00:15:59,639
haven't till the soils when they're that

457
00:15:57,120 --> 00:16:01,079
wet like they do back east again never

458
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,680
tillette soil you're going to create

459
00:16:01,079 --> 00:16:06,199
compaction simple as that it's 30-in

460
00:16:03,680 --> 00:16:06,199
enough RIT

461
00:16:07,000 --> 00:16:12,279
Zone look close under here this is in

462
00:16:10,279 --> 00:16:15,519
farm Journal Magazine on a contest I had

463
00:16:12,279 --> 00:16:16,880
said I built the best Mike Peeper

464
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:19,120
compaction doesn't have a chance and

465
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:21,560
Mike Peeper deep rips with this rig he

466
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,880
designed and built 13 foot wide

467
00:16:21,560 --> 00:16:27,079
Implement takes 320 horsepower to

468
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:30,920
pull earlier I said you got to like your

469
00:16:27,079 --> 00:16:34,120
fuel man Mike's Fuel Man M's

470
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:36,480
mic we've done some dumb things guys

471
00:16:34,120 --> 00:16:37,839
let's go to noil Dwayne is going to talk

472
00:16:36,480 --> 00:16:40,480
about let mother do it mother nature

473
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:43,120
freest sty wedding and drying Roots

474
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,600
build soil structure and leave residue

475
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:48,160
out there it's the residue that's going

476
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:49,639
to make that system work and again a lot

477
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:52,519
of guys say well do I need to go out and

478
00:16:49,639 --> 00:16:54,600
rip that up do I need to do strip tail

479
00:16:52,519 --> 00:16:55,800
to me strip tail is a temporary tool to

480
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,399
get rid of a compaction ler that may

481
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,240
have been caused from years of tillage

482
00:16:57,399 --> 00:17:01,759
to open it up to get the crop plant and

483
00:16:59,240 --> 00:17:03,519
then next year I can go no tail rent the

484
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:04,600
tool you don't need it every year once

485
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:06,720
you get rid of the pan if you don't

486
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:08,600
reform it that's how strip till works

487
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:11,640
you get rid of the pan of the first trip

488
00:17:08,600 --> 00:17:13,039
don't reform it do some digging spend

489
00:17:11,640 --> 00:17:15,280
some time on the spade look what you've

490
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:17,600
got there now if you're digging and your

491
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:20,400
roots look something like this there's

492
00:17:17,600 --> 00:17:21,559
no root restricting layer the pan

493
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:24,160
doesn't necessarily mean you got to do

494
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:27,079
tillage a root restricting layer does a

495
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:29,840
water restricting layer does break that

496
00:17:27,079 --> 00:17:31,960
up iron can do it Roots can do it I

497
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:33,960
prefer Roots because they'll build soil

498
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,400
structure this one's interesting that's

499
00:17:33,960 --> 00:17:38,520
uh that living history of farming deor

500
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:39,799
years ago there's a display there that's

501
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,640
my finger point The Roots went all the

502
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,880
way to the

503
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,480
floor those roots went down and they

504
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:47,720
actually spread out below the tillage

505
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:49,200
layer with no residue up here there's no

506
00:17:47,720 --> 00:17:51,600
solar moisture up there there's no roots

507
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:52,880
up there now let's think about that

508
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:54,799
quick quarter inch rain that blows

509
00:17:52,880 --> 00:17:57,440
through on a summer thunderstorm soaks

510
00:17:54,799 --> 00:17:59,360
in about an inch no roots to pick that

511
00:17:57,440 --> 00:18:00,919
up it dries out

512
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,200
I'm a no tailer I got residue up here I

513
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:05,400
Got Roots up here that same rain means a

514
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:07,640
lot to me meant nothing to my till

515
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:09,280
neighbor so again think about the root

516
00:18:07,640 --> 00:18:11,280
system look see what youve got in the

517
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:13,400
soil leave residue out there this is one

518
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,760
of our Fields already planted residue

519
00:18:13,400 --> 00:18:18,080
everywhere that's what we want to see

520
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:20,120
that residue is going to be that mulch

521
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:22,919
to keep the soil cooler and wetter at

522
00:18:20,120 --> 00:18:24,200
planting time yeah yes a little bit but

523
00:18:22,919 --> 00:18:25,880
it's definitely going to keep it cooler

524
00:18:24,200 --> 00:18:28,600
and wetter the rest of the growing

525
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:30,000
season that's what makes the money you

526
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:32,880
know this past year there was a lot of

527
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:34,240
shortages of feed you know I can't fault

528
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:36,760
someone who has to keep their livestock

529
00:18:34,240 --> 00:18:38,720
alive maybe this is a cheap form of feed

530
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:40,000
for them but you know what it's a double

531
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:42,240
whamming when he looks at what happens

532
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:43,720
to the soil system as we take it away

533
00:18:42,240 --> 00:18:44,480
for the guys who got greedy are selling

534
00:18:43,720 --> 00:18:46,240
their

535
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:49,200
residue think of every one of those

536
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,280
Bales at least is a $20 bill and about a

537
00:18:49,200 --> 00:18:51,679
th000 pounds of residue there you're

538
00:18:50,280 --> 00:18:53,559
going to put on at least 20 pounds of

539
00:18:51,679 --> 00:18:55,840
extra nutrients to pay for that which

540
00:18:53,559 --> 00:18:57,480
you just hauled away but think about

541
00:18:55,840 --> 00:18:59,280
what happens to the soil itself I'm

542
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,679
hauling away carbon that I can't buy at

543
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:04,880
the elevator as we look at the a lot of

544
00:19:02,679 --> 00:19:06,559
people say that's already got half cover

545
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:08,799
you know nrcs will tell you half cover

546
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:12,600
is good for erosion control well when it

547
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,159
comes to moisture reducing evaporation

548
00:19:12,600 --> 00:19:15,440
Norm Clocky is an irrigation especially

549
00:19:14,159 --> 00:19:16,840
down at K State he's been doing some

550
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:19,640
work on measuring evaporation from

551
00:19:16,840 --> 00:19:22,280
residue covered soil surfaces with bear

552
00:19:19,640 --> 00:19:25,240
he's measuring about 8/10 of an inch or

553
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,720
800 an inch per day you'll say well

554
00:19:25,240 --> 00:19:30,360
that's not much multiply 100 day growing

555
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:33,080
season that's 8 in of water loss to

556
00:19:30,360 --> 00:19:35,280
evaporation as he left cover out there

557
00:19:33,080 --> 00:19:39,240
7/10 7/10

558
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:41,679
710 100% cover was 510 that's

559
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:43,799
three hund times 100 days is three

560
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,559
inches of water difference I looked at

561
00:19:43,799 --> 00:19:47,799
that and said wait a minute conservation

562
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:51,240
Tilly says 30% cover Cuts erosion and a

563
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:54,840
half 50% even 75% cover didn't cut water

564
00:19:51,240 --> 00:19:56,159
loss much why and Norman explained it to

565
00:19:54,840 --> 00:19:59,440
me this way he says you know you build

566
00:19:56,159 --> 00:20:00,840
the best house you can build you got r19

567
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:02,080
insulation of the walls and R30

568
00:20:00,840 --> 00:20:04,200
insulation of the ceilings and these

569
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,080
triple pane windows and the kids go out

570
00:20:04,200 --> 00:20:07,120
the door and leave the door open and all

571
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:09,760
the heat gets

572
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,640
out water does the same thing when it

573
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,120
comes to residue cover it follows a

574
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:15,960
lease path resistance preferential flow

575
00:20:14,120 --> 00:20:18,640
and the water goes out of the soil the

576
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:21,679
water vapor he says you want at least

577
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:23,840
80% 100% is better leave the soil

578
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:25,000
covered you can't afford to sell it

579
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:28,000
because you just lost three inches of

580
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:30,559
water in this case also leave it upright

581
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:32,480
standing catch the snow that is moisture

582
00:20:30,559 --> 00:20:34,919
I don't want that to blow away and I

583
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:36,320
want to catch it uniformly you know too

584
00:20:34,919 --> 00:20:37,880
often I hear from producers that you

585
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:40,159
know Hilltop doesn't produce much but

586
00:20:37,880 --> 00:20:41,760
boy those valleys sure do but if they

587
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,000
did something like this and they lost

588
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:45,840
all this moisture and they tilted and

589
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,559
lost even more moisture but down in The

590
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,919
Valleys where all their water ran off or

591
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:50,760
all the snow accumulated that's why

592
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,960
there's

593
00:20:50,760 --> 00:20:54,720
differences this is a noer left his

594
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,960
residue standing he's got about the same

595
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,600
snow catch everywhere that's going to be

596
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,080
more uniform soil temperature more

597
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,760
uniform soil moisture for planting next

598
00:21:00,080 --> 00:21:04,360
spring compared to this one so again

599
00:21:02,760 --> 00:21:07,000
leave the residue leave it standing

600
00:21:04,360 --> 00:21:08,679
upright upright anchored attached I

601
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:10,799
don't have to cut it compared to

602
00:21:08,679 --> 00:21:12,880
flattened since it's attached when I'm

603
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,240
going through it the soil holds it so I

604
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,559
can pass across it I love my residue I

605
00:21:15,240 --> 00:21:19,760
want to leave it there uh here's an

606
00:21:17,559 --> 00:21:21,880
example from our research farm corn our

607
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:23,480
corn residue we cut pretty high it's

608
00:21:21,880 --> 00:21:25,760
rubbing the paint off of our front axle

609
00:21:23,480 --> 00:21:27,640
of the tractor off of the planter

610
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:29,360
toolbar these are two visitors from

611
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:30,480
United Kingdom they couldn't believe in

612
00:21:29,360 --> 00:21:32,279
they had to take pictures I had to take

613
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:34,880
a picture of them taking pictures but

614
00:21:32,279 --> 00:21:36,240
again you see how tall the residue is a

615
00:21:34,880 --> 00:21:38,240
lot of people say well all that residue

616
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,320
holds a soil cold and wet well if you

617
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:41,559
knock it down early and you make a mat

618
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,360
you don't get any air movement down the

619
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:46,600
soil surface I leave it standing as long

620
00:21:44,360 --> 00:21:48,159
as I can so I get air movement of this

621
00:21:46,600 --> 00:21:51,400
whole surface so I get in there to plant

622
00:21:48,159 --> 00:21:52,400
earlier I knock it down at planting time

623
00:21:51,400 --> 00:21:53,760
you notice there's not a whole bunch of

624
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,880
root balls rolled out we're planted down

625
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:57,320
the old road the soil biological life

626
00:21:55,880 --> 00:21:59,240
and long-term no tail is that the root

627
00:21:57,320 --> 00:22:01,720
ball rots out from underneath it doesn't

628
00:21:59,240 --> 00:22:03,640
roll over when you hit it with a planter

629
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:05,360
in fact the so biologic activi is once I

630
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:07,679
get the residue in contact with that so

631
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:10,000
biological life my res disappears in a

632
00:22:07,679 --> 00:22:12,080
hurry hey that's okay it's breaking down

633
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:13,520
now releasing carbon dioxide into the

634
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,520
canopy it's releasing carbon into the

635
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:17,640
soil releasing nutrients into the soil

636
00:22:15,520 --> 00:22:19,679
when my next crop is

637
00:22:17,640 --> 00:22:21,440
growing compared to my neighbor who did

638
00:22:19,679 --> 00:22:22,760
tillage this fall it's releasing all

639
00:22:21,440 --> 00:22:25,440
that stuff now and his next crop won't

640
00:22:22,760 --> 00:22:26,480
be growing for another six months so

641
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,480
again I want the residue to break down

642
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:31,679
when the next crop is there now I apply

643
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:33,320
it down the old row for crops and

644
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:35,760
rotation for corn on corn we actually go

645
00:22:33,320 --> 00:22:37,200
beside the old row beside the old row

646
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:39,360
for more uniform depth control more

647
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:40,760
uniform seed placement if you really

648
00:22:39,360 --> 00:22:42,559
want to wear out your tractor tires real

649
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:43,520
fast plant exactly between the old rows

650
00:22:42,559 --> 00:22:46,039
and you'll wear them out because you're

651
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:48,919
driving on the old row so again I leave

652
00:22:46,039 --> 00:22:50,520
the residue in place I love rotation I

653
00:22:48,919 --> 00:22:51,840
love wheat wheat gives me a cool

654
00:22:50,520 --> 00:22:54,159
seasoned grass to go along with my warm

655
00:22:51,840 --> 00:22:56,919
seasoned grass of corn my warm season

656
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:59,640
broad life is soybeans as I go to the

657
00:22:56,919 --> 00:23:01,080
soybeans into wheat in this case

658
00:22:59,640 --> 00:23:02,679
Southeast Nebraska a lot of guys say you

659
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:03,799
can't plant soybeans till after May 5th

660
00:23:02,679 --> 00:23:06,400
conventional utilties because the soil

661
00:23:03,799 --> 00:23:07,400
is not warm enough yet May 5th I already

662
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,320
had them up and growing because I

663
00:23:07,400 --> 00:23:11,360
planted them in April 15th into 87

664
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,679
bushel wheat

665
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:16,039
straw the soil structure is such the

666
00:23:13,679 --> 00:23:17,840
excess water soaked away cold wet soil

667
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:19,320
temperatures is because you can't soak

668
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:21,480
away the water build the structure soak

669
00:23:19,320 --> 00:23:24,120
it down deeper and no tilling into heavy

670
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:26,640
wheat straw is not a problem now let's

671
00:23:24,120 --> 00:23:30,360
go back to this I started

672
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:32,760
earlier half inch doesn't sound like

673
00:23:30,360 --> 00:23:34,559
much been doing a lot of work in my uh

674
00:23:32,760 --> 00:23:36,039
early days I had research grants with

675
00:23:34,559 --> 00:23:37,840
rainfall simulator to measure the

676
00:23:36,039 --> 00:23:41,039
effects of residue and reducing the

677
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:42,279
erosion and that 30% level in

678
00:23:41,039 --> 00:23:44,559
conservation compliance came from

679
00:23:42,279 --> 00:23:46,240
research like this Across the Nation we

680
00:23:44,559 --> 00:23:49,039
started doing demos for extension type

681
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:50,880
meetings where we put out 100% cover no

682
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:53,640
cover on the other side we had 30% maybe

683
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,799
we had 50% we had this different things

684
00:23:53,640 --> 00:23:57,039
every time you ran the research every

685
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:59,200
time you ran the demo residue reduced

686
00:23:57,039 --> 00:24:01,000
erosion every time we did that looked at

687
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:03,080
the runoff we says boy residue didn't

688
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:04,919
change the runoff much you know at the

689
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:07,159
time the storm's occurring it doesn't

690
00:24:04,919 --> 00:24:08,919
change it much but when you look at what

691
00:24:07,159 --> 00:24:10,559
happens when the residue is gone and

692
00:24:08,919 --> 00:24:13,039
when you build soil structure there are

693
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:15,440
big differences big differences let's

694
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:19,080
come back to evapo transpiration the

695
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:20,600
measurements typically about 1/4 of our

696
00:24:19,080 --> 00:24:22,279
water that comes from rainfall is

697
00:24:20,600 --> 00:24:24,760
evaporated off from the soil surface off

698
00:24:22,279 --> 00:24:27,000
a wet crop canopy off a wet residue lost

699
00:24:24,760 --> 00:24:29,039
to evaporation quicker you close the

700
00:24:27,000 --> 00:24:31,039
canopy the less this will be

701
00:24:29,039 --> 00:24:33,159
now the rest of the water goes through

702
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:35,080
the soil system into the roots and

703
00:24:33,159 --> 00:24:36,880
transpired by the crop to keep the crop

704
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:39,399
cool and to grow more

705
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,320
crop now some people say take all the e

706
00:24:39,399 --> 00:24:42,360
out of ET well you can cut it in half

707
00:24:41,320 --> 00:24:44,919
roughly because it's still going to come

708
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,159
off wet surface wet residue but the more

709
00:24:44,919 --> 00:24:48,720
I can get into the soil the more goes

710
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:50,600
through the crop the more yield I get I

711
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,919
throw this up these are Nebraska numbers

712
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:54,760
just to give you a quick reference in

713
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,440
your mind western Nebraska ET is lower

714
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:59,159
than Eastern Nebraska wait a minute

715
00:24:56,440 --> 00:25:00,559
isn't hotter and drier out west

716
00:24:59,159 --> 00:25:03,559
the reason it's less out there is they

717
00:25:00,559 --> 00:25:05,720
use shorter seasoned crops if you get a

718
00:25:03,559 --> 00:25:07,320
90day corn versus 120-day Corn that's

719
00:25:05,720 --> 00:25:09,960
the difference in water use it's growing

720
00:25:07,320 --> 00:25:12,480
longer uses more water and look this

721
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:14,279
direction alphaalpha grows only about

722
00:25:12,480 --> 00:25:16,520
eight months a year compared to corn and

723
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:18,240
beans only about five months a year

724
00:25:16,520 --> 00:25:20,840
wheat grows in the cool of the winter

725
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:23,480
cool of the spring uses less water so

726
00:25:20,840 --> 00:25:24,799
there's all sorts of things affect ET

727
00:25:23,480 --> 00:25:27,159
but think about those when you're using

728
00:25:24,799 --> 00:25:29,600
water a cover crop in the offseason of

729
00:25:27,159 --> 00:25:30,840
corn soybeans is in this cooler season

730
00:25:29,600 --> 00:25:32,559
it's going to use less water simply

731
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:35,600
because it is a less water intensive

732
00:25:32,559 --> 00:25:38,679
time a year something grows year round

733
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:41,200
uses more water again if you got excess

734
00:25:38,679 --> 00:25:43,440
water grow something to use the water so

735
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:45,120
that's why I just throw these up for et

736
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:47,919
when nor Clocky was at Nebraska he was

737
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:50,200
measuring ET and he separated out again

738
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:52,240
what was off the evaporation what was

739
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:54,440
transpiration and what was amazing sort

740
00:25:52,240 --> 00:25:56,320
of is 16.8 was

741
00:25:54,440 --> 00:25:59,200
transpiration I can show you producers

742
00:25:56,320 --> 00:26:01,799
in Nebraska that pump 20 to 30 in of

743
00:25:59,200 --> 00:26:02,960
water a year which means they're wasting

744
00:26:01,799 --> 00:26:04,520
irrigation water that means they aren't

745
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,200
even using the

746
00:26:04,520 --> 00:26:09,559
rainfall again vaporation let's cut that

747
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,799
in half if we can Norman went out there

748
00:26:09,559 --> 00:26:14,600
and he took just 5,000 pounds per acre

749
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:17,080
equivalent of wheat straw spread it out

750
00:26:14,600 --> 00:26:18,919
there two different years data here just

751
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:21,960
by taking a bare soil and covering it he

752
00:26:18,919 --> 00:26:24,120
cut evaporation roughly in half growing

753
00:26:21,960 --> 00:26:25,799
a crop he also cut it in half because he

754
00:26:24,120 --> 00:26:27,960
cut the wind and sun off the soil

755
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:29,120
surface and residue in a crop cut it

756
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:33,240
even more

757
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:35,399
yet grow something protect the soil keep

758
00:26:33,240 --> 00:26:37,200
the Sun and wind off the soil surface a

759
00:26:35,399 --> 00:26:39,360
lot of people say well I never have this

760
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,559
condition over here sure you do if you

761
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:42,279
don't have a cover crop you've done

762
00:26:40,559 --> 00:26:43,960
tillage you've got that if you leave the

763
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:45,679
residue there it's worth a lot more if I

764
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:48,360
do residue and a cover crop it's worth a

765
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,559
lot more to save water he's norm since

766
00:26:48,360 --> 00:26:52,320
moved to Garden City Kansas here's corn

767
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,039
residue wheat residue straight no

768
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:57,640
tilling in soybeans and corn this is

769
00:26:55,039 --> 00:26:58,840
simply this difference now so he did the

770
00:26:57,640 --> 00:27:01,600
math for you

771
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:05,279
he finds two to four to almost five

772
00:27:01,600 --> 00:27:07,840
inches of water saved by reducing that

773
00:27:05,279 --> 00:27:09,159
evaporation so let's put this on here

774
00:27:07,840 --> 00:27:09,880
I'm going start running total here by

775
00:27:09,159 --> 00:27:12,919
the

776
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:14,080
way you know here's a crop sunflowers

777
00:27:12,919 --> 00:27:16,360
sunflowers supposed to be drought

778
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:18,520
resistant because they Root Down Deeper

779
00:27:16,360 --> 00:27:20,520
right 2005 was a drought here in

780
00:27:18,520 --> 00:27:22,159
Southeast Nebraska the sunflowers burned

781
00:27:20,520 --> 00:27:24,159
up because of a lack of

782
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:26,799
residue if you don't have residue there

783
00:27:24,159 --> 00:27:30,000
and evaporation I just lost five inches

784
00:27:26,799 --> 00:27:31,559
that was my crop

785
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,880
2005 there were some neighbors there

786
00:27:31,559 --> 00:27:36,279
that says you know I have to chop silage

787
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:40,200
to harvest what I can to feed my Liv

788
00:27:36,279 --> 00:27:42,760
stock true now the next spring when they

789
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:44,960
went in and planted their corn it was a

790
00:27:42,760 --> 00:27:47,320
dry year that corn burned up there's not

791
00:27:44,960 --> 00:27:49,200
an ear there on part of the field they

792
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:51,039
left to run the combine through just so

793
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:53,559
he get his insurance payment had to run

794
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:55,399
a grain yield had residue there the corn

795
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:57,840
is still green and it's forming an

796
00:27:55,399 --> 00:28:00,279
ear the residue are you took away that

797
00:27:57,840 --> 00:28:03,919
year cost him the next year the little

798
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,120
bit he left was a plus now the guys are

799
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:06,440
starting to argue well you get the

800
00:28:05,120 --> 00:28:08,480
drought year and you got that short corn

801
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:10,320
out there what do you do there's a lot

802
00:28:08,480 --> 00:28:12,440
of guys run their combine through it

803
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:15,000
just to spread the residue and process

804
00:28:12,440 --> 00:28:16,120
the residue they're not taking it away

805
00:28:15,000 --> 00:28:19,120
because they know the value of the

806
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:20,559
residue so a researcher out that way

807
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,440
West Central research extension centers

808
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:25,159
at North Plat Nebraska he went in

809
00:28:22,440 --> 00:28:27,640
straight soybean residue and raked away

810
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:29,080
some and left the other there now I did

811
00:28:27,640 --> 00:28:30,440
a nutrient testing he made sure

812
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:32,519
nutrients wen't limiting factor this

813
00:28:30,440 --> 00:28:33,840
simply the residue mulch he irrigated

814
00:28:32,519 --> 00:28:34,919
the rest of the field based upon the

815
00:28:33,840 --> 00:28:37,159
residue

816
00:28:34,919 --> 00:28:38,640
level this was under irrigated because

817
00:28:37,159 --> 00:28:40,919
of the viation and you can see how much

818
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:43,080
yield he lost well some guys say we just

819
00:28:40,919 --> 00:28:46,000
irrigate more to make up for this wait

820
00:28:43,080 --> 00:28:48,720
that costs money don't do that or you're

821
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:52,399
the dry Lander here was wheat after

822
00:28:48,720 --> 00:28:53,799
harvest left the straw in place and in

823
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:55,799
part of the field he bailed the straw

824
00:28:53,799 --> 00:28:56,840
because he needed some straw baales gave

825
00:28:55,799 --> 00:28:59,159
up 20

826
00:28:56,840 --> 00:29:00,200
bushels this guy figured out he buys his

827
00:28:59,159 --> 00:29:02,200
baales from the neighbor because the

828
00:29:00,200 --> 00:29:04,399
neighbor hasn't figured it out yet he

829
00:29:02,200 --> 00:29:07,519
leaves his residue in the

830
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:10,519
field the next year Steve Melvin at our

831
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,799
Curtis research Farm has a good rainfall

832
00:29:10,519 --> 00:29:15,480
year his Dy yields weren't that much

833
00:29:12,799 --> 00:29:18,000
reduced yeah there some look they were

834
00:29:15,480 --> 00:29:19,960
reduced both though when he removed

835
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,440
residue we got guys down there in

836
00:29:19,960 --> 00:29:23,279
Southeast Nebraska that don't even allow

837
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:25,799
Sil to be chopped in their Farms because

838
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:28,080
the yield they give up when that residue

839
00:29:25,799 --> 00:29:29,840
disappears and one of those Farms is our

840
00:29:28,080 --> 00:29:31,440
University Nebraska research Farm the

841
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,559
Agronomy group already figured this out

842
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,679
and the animal science group is mad

843
00:29:33,559 --> 00:29:36,600
because they got to buy the silage from

844
00:29:34,679 --> 00:29:39,640
The Neighbors The Neighbors haven't

845
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:42,600
figured it out yet again that residue is

846
00:29:39,640 --> 00:29:45,440
what drives this soil system I can't

847
00:29:42,600 --> 00:29:49,919
afford to give it up here's back to my

848
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:51,760
tillage plots in uh 2005 first week of

849
00:29:49,919 --> 00:29:54,519
June we had five days in a row over 100

850
00:29:51,760 --> 00:29:56,760
degree heat now it cooled off and it

851
00:29:54,519 --> 00:29:59,000
rained where there's no residue in the

852
00:29:56,760 --> 00:30:00,159
till that sor basically went dormant now

853
00:29:59,000 --> 00:30:01,799
it didn't die you can see all the plants

854
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:03,880
are still there but look where how

855
00:30:01,799 --> 00:30:05,760
healthy that growth is when the rain

856
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,760
came this took off and we didn't expect

857
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:10,519
too much yield difference when the

858
00:30:06,760 --> 00:30:10,519
combine rolled it was 35 bushel

859
00:30:10,720 --> 00:30:15,320
difference 2000 was a year that during

860
00:30:13,600 --> 00:30:17,600
the growing season we got 11 inches of

861
00:30:15,320 --> 00:30:19,799
rain County average of soybeans that

862
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:22,039
year was 23 Bush per acre or 25 bushel

863
00:30:19,799 --> 00:30:26,600
per acre I'm sorry my tilled soybeans

864
00:30:22,039 --> 00:30:29,200
were 23 on 11 in of rain my notail was

865
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:31,279
47 I can't give up that

866
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:33,720
residue earlier I said rainfall

867
00:30:31,279 --> 00:30:36,360
simulator we said not much difference in

868
00:30:33,720 --> 00:30:38,559
runoff big difference in erosion we had

869
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:41,440
one site we're doing all this research

870
00:30:38,559 --> 00:30:43,960
that uh when we stood there and on the

871
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,320
tilled side we got run off after about

872
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:47,240
20 minutes of water applied that's an

873
00:30:45,320 --> 00:30:49,440
inch of water in 20

874
00:30:47,240 --> 00:30:51,360
minutes and all the farmers standing

875
00:30:49,440 --> 00:30:53,600
there said see tilling it you open it up

876
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:56,399
the water can soak again on the other

877
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:58,320
side the residue was standing we stood

878
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,960
there for an hour and a half three and

879
00:30:58,320 --> 00:31:02,919
3/4 inches of water applied before we

880
00:30:59,960 --> 00:31:04,639
saw any runoff and we said boy this

881
00:31:02,919 --> 00:31:07,360
site's not like the other 21 sites that

882
00:31:04,639 --> 00:31:08,960
we just done this one's wrong I'm sorry

883
00:31:07,360 --> 00:31:13,159
to say this was the right

884
00:31:08,960 --> 00:31:16,399
site Charlie fster had a no tail as a

885
00:31:13,159 --> 00:31:19,200
Cham fellow versus tillage fellow what

886
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:20,360
this plot was he' been there for 13

887
00:31:19,200 --> 00:31:23,039
years

888
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,320
already 13 years a no tail build it such

889
00:31:23,039 --> 00:31:26,279
that three and 3/4 inches of water

890
00:31:24,320 --> 00:31:29,600
soaked in before we saw the first runoff

891
00:31:26,279 --> 00:31:31,360
compared to this one one inch of water

892
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:33,000
that single storm is two and 3/4 inch of

893
00:31:31,360 --> 00:31:34,799
water difference because the so

894
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:37,039
structure of longterm

895
00:31:34,799 --> 00:31:39,080
NOA again long-term no till this is from

896
00:31:37,039 --> 00:31:40,639
my tillage plots tile Spade full of soil

897
00:31:39,080 --> 00:31:42,559
you see the good Peds and Aggregates you

898
00:31:40,639 --> 00:31:44,559
can see where water can soak in compared

899
00:31:42,559 --> 00:31:47,159
to the tilled where it's denser you

900
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:48,480
can't see the water soak in now before

901
00:31:47,159 --> 00:31:50,320
taking this picture I should have lined

902
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,760
this up 4 inches lower than that because

903
00:31:50,320 --> 00:31:53,799
the soil surface is 4 inches lower

904
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,720
wasn't thinking when I snapped the

905
00:31:53,799 --> 00:31:58,399
picture but now some interesting work

906
00:31:55,720 --> 00:32:01,159
coming out of France see that good soil

907
00:31:58,399 --> 00:32:03,639
structure the heat from the earth Rises

908
00:32:01,159 --> 00:32:06,360
up through those same holes and they are

909
00:32:03,639 --> 00:32:08,519
measuring in no tail fields in March

910
00:32:06,360 --> 00:32:12,360
being about 5 to 10 degrees warmer than

911
00:32:08,519 --> 00:32:14,080
tilled fields in March it's because this

912
00:32:12,360 --> 00:32:15,960
tillage making it more dense and no poor

913
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:17,960
space there the Heat Can't

914
00:32:15,960 --> 00:32:19,600
rise I started paying attention to that

915
00:32:17,960 --> 00:32:22,200
on our usage Farm we started measuring

916
00:32:19,600 --> 00:32:23,639
so temperatures our no tail where the

917
00:32:22,200 --> 00:32:25,960
water can soak in and heat can come up

918
00:32:23,639 --> 00:32:27,519
as the same soil temperatures are tilled

919
00:32:25,960 --> 00:32:29,399
in fact with the soil structure we can

920
00:32:27,519 --> 00:32:31,880
plant no tail before our till neighbors

921
00:32:29,399 --> 00:32:34,200
can plant theirs and again remember I

922
00:32:31,880 --> 00:32:36,559
said I had soybeans into heavy wheat

923
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:38,000
straw 15th of April and Convention till

924
00:32:36,559 --> 00:32:41,519
neighbors aren't plant soybeans till May

925
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:43,919
5th because it's too cold no tail soil

926
00:32:41,519 --> 00:32:46,200
structure solves a lot of the problems

927
00:32:43,919 --> 00:32:47,960
when you get air exchange gas exchange

928
00:32:46,200 --> 00:32:50,399
water

929
00:32:47,960 --> 00:32:52,279
movement we've done some measurements on

930
00:32:50,399 --> 00:32:53,679
infiltration I use controll wheel

931
00:32:52,279 --> 00:32:57,039
traffic as well Jim mentioned that in

932
00:32:53,679 --> 00:33:00,799
his final present or slide there till

933
00:32:57,039 --> 00:33:02,679
2/10 inch per hour could soak in 410 on

934
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:03,919
the soft row we haven't driven and this

935
00:33:02,679 --> 00:33:05,360
has hadn't been driven on it for more

936
00:33:03,919 --> 00:33:07,960
than 25

937
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,519
years but the tillage makes that top

938
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:11,880
layer so it doesn't take in water very

939
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,000
fast we pulled out the nrcs soil survey

940
00:33:11,880 --> 00:33:15,000
and it said that the intake rate should

941
00:33:13,000 --> 00:33:18,639
be between 210 and 610 because of the

942
00:33:15,000 --> 00:33:20,840
clay content of Sly clay LOM soil that

943
00:33:18,639 --> 00:33:22,960
was now what was interesting though this

944
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:24,279
is saturated for more than 24 hours

945
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:25,799
before he took this measurement so this

946
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:27,600
is not just initial intake this is

947
00:33:25,799 --> 00:33:29,399
actually what's moving through the soil

948
00:33:27,600 --> 00:33:32,320
go to the notail there's 610 that's the

949
00:33:29,399 --> 00:33:35,519
high side of the two to four 2 to six

950
00:33:32,320 --> 00:33:38,320
it's over 4 in per hour there any of you

951
00:33:35,519 --> 00:33:40,200
who visits Dakota lakes Dwayne will show

952
00:33:38,320 --> 00:33:42,919
you this on his long-term noil with that

953
00:33:40,200 --> 00:33:44,240
water can just disappear it soaks in

954
00:33:42,919 --> 00:33:47,399
when you build that

955
00:33:44,240 --> 00:33:49,279
structure Southeast Nebraska it's the

956
00:33:47,399 --> 00:33:51,799
typical spring thunderstorm blew through

957
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:54,679
and actually late spring 6inch rain came

958
00:33:51,799 --> 00:33:56,480
overnight from June 12th to 13th we're

959
00:33:54,679 --> 00:33:57,960
out there walking around taking pictures

960
00:33:56,480 --> 00:33:59,799
and as we're taking pictures of this

961
00:33:57,960 --> 00:34:02,200
it's got a crust on Terrace is over top

962
00:33:59,799 --> 00:34:04,320
Terrace is washed out the farmer drove

963
00:34:02,200 --> 00:34:06,399
up he just shaking his head said

964
00:34:04,320 --> 00:34:08,679
worthless rain just like anybody else I

965
00:34:06,399 --> 00:34:11,280
said how much did you get he says six

966
00:34:08,679 --> 00:34:12,560
Ines worthless rain crusted the soil

967
00:34:11,280 --> 00:34:13,440
Washed Out The Terraces when am I going

968
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:14,679
to get in there when's it's it going to

969
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:16,520
be dry enough for me to replant the

970
00:34:14,679 --> 00:34:20,079
grain sorghum worthless

971
00:34:16,520 --> 00:34:21,599
rain his neighbor acrossed the fence

972
00:34:20,079 --> 00:34:24,079
long-term no

973
00:34:21,599 --> 00:34:25,679
tiller sorum's already up soil

974
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,760
structures there took a soil moisture

975
00:34:25,679 --> 00:34:31,760
Pro Rod had a full soil moisture profile

976
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:34,679
to 6 feet deep and sorghum June 13th 6

977
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:37,720
foot of moisture he says beautiful

978
00:34:34,679 --> 00:34:40,359
rain the difference of so structure

979
00:34:37,720 --> 00:34:42,040
guys all right I put a question mark on

980
00:34:40,359 --> 00:34:44,280
the six you don't always get that kind

981
00:34:42,040 --> 00:34:45,800
of thunderstorm it's impressive yes

982
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:47,599
we've easily measured two extra inches

983
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:48,839
of water because of better infiltration

984
00:34:47,599 --> 00:34:50,760
less

985
00:34:48,839 --> 00:34:54,599
runoff and again going back to that

986
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:58,160
11inch rainfall year 61 with tillage to

987
00:34:54,599 --> 00:34:59,240
the line no till 121

988
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,079
that's what we see when you get that

989
00:34:59,240 --> 00:35:03,480
infiltration and residue and soil

990
00:35:01,079 --> 00:35:06,040
structure and remember I'm adding this

991
00:35:03,480 --> 00:35:07,920
is working together areal view of that

992
00:35:06,040 --> 00:35:09,640
research Farm 10 miles east of Lincoln

993
00:35:07,920 --> 00:35:11,440
it's a terorist farm terorists are put

994
00:35:09,640 --> 00:35:13,960
in back in the 50s and 60s when he said

995
00:35:11,440 --> 00:35:15,160
we got to control runoff you know what

996
00:35:13,960 --> 00:35:16,800
with controlled wheel traffic and

997
00:35:15,160 --> 00:35:19,720
long-term no tail and nice broad crop

998
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:21,839
rotation we have next to no runoff very

999
00:35:19,720 --> 00:35:25,000
seldom do these Terra see

1000
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:27,720
water right here is a repair and buffer

1001
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:28,720
Strip This Terrace basically defines

1002
00:35:27,720 --> 00:35:31,200
only runoff that comes through that

1003
00:35:28,720 --> 00:35:33,240
buffer strip is off of this field that

1004
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,119
buffer strip was put in in 1998 because

1005
00:35:33,240 --> 00:35:35,280
everyone says we're going to put in

1006
00:35:34,119 --> 00:35:36,720
buffers to filter everything coming out

1007
00:35:35,280 --> 00:35:39,280
of the

1008
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,880
runoff was it R I think you said it

1009
00:35:39,280 --> 00:35:44,280
buffers were a

1010
00:35:41,880 --> 00:35:47,079
Band-Aid this field was no tilled about

1011
00:35:44,280 --> 00:35:48,880
10 years already by then 98 they put in

1012
00:35:47,079 --> 00:35:50,680
the buffer 99 they put in eight runoff

1013
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:52,839
sampers in front of the buffer and four

1014
00:35:50,680 --> 00:35:54,800
behind so they can compare the water in

1015
00:35:52,839 --> 00:35:58,520
water out see how affected the buffer

1016
00:35:54,800 --> 00:36:00,040
was about five years ago they quit

1017
00:35:58,520 --> 00:36:01,720
putting the runoff Samplers out there in

1018
00:36:00,040 --> 00:36:03,720
the spring because they never measured

1019
00:36:01,720 --> 00:36:06,720
runoff into that

1020
00:36:03,720 --> 00:36:08,160
buffer it all stays in that field

1021
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:11,720
doesn't run

1022
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:13,319
off we raise 250 bushel of corn dry land

1023
00:36:11,720 --> 00:36:15,160
down here dropping populations in

1024
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,640
Dryland 33,000 when our neighbors are

1025
00:36:15,160 --> 00:36:19,960
raising 142 is the county average and

1026
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:22,000
they're dropping about

1027
00:36:19,960 --> 00:36:24,440
25,000 I'm treating it like irrigated

1028
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:26,720
because we're using our

1029
00:36:24,440 --> 00:36:28,880
water now again our neighbors they're

1030
00:36:26,720 --> 00:36:30,280
using their terrorist

1031
00:36:28,880 --> 00:36:33,160
we're keeping our

1032
00:36:30,280 --> 00:36:38,040
water all right you've seen the running

1033
00:36:33,160 --> 00:36:40,599
total 5 to 12 I easily get the five

1034
00:36:38,040 --> 00:36:42,800
extra did a meeting down Boot Hill in

1035
00:36:40,599 --> 00:36:46,079
Missouri I was there for three days and

1036
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:48,200
rained five inches they get 50 inches of

1037
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:49,760
rain there they had land levelers trying

1038
00:36:48,200 --> 00:36:51,920
to get the land level to get rid of the

1039
00:36:49,760 --> 00:36:54,200
water then you looked in the background

1040
00:36:51,920 --> 00:36:55,960
and they had pivots I'm going 50 inches

1041
00:36:54,200 --> 00:36:58,480
of water and you got pivots yeah when

1042
00:36:55,960 --> 00:37:01,359
the rain stops in June it stops s till

1043
00:36:58,480 --> 00:37:03,760
September we need irrigation I go 50 in

1044
00:37:01,359 --> 00:37:04,960
of rain they have a tilled soil that's

1045
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:07,839
not letting the water soak in it's all

1046
00:37:04,960 --> 00:37:09,720
running off they need irrigation he's

1047
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,640
been there he's

1048
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:14,839
nodding we go to Minnesota we switch to

1049
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,480
Noel we go to Iowa Illinois wherever we

1050
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:18,720
switched to noil we used to be corn

1051
00:37:16,480 --> 00:37:21,359
soybeans with tillage we had runoff we

1052
00:37:18,720 --> 00:37:23,880
had evaporation and we had 30 inches

1053
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:25,560
rain 40 inch of rain whatever they get

1054
00:37:23,880 --> 00:37:28,319
and they save 5 to

1055
00:37:25,560 --> 00:37:30,520
12 remember Cornell used

1056
00:37:28,319 --> 00:37:31,839
16.8 they say 5 to 12 what's the first

1057
00:37:30,520 --> 00:37:33,599
thing they do they complain about cold

1058
00:37:31,839 --> 00:37:35,920
wet soil they say I'm going to get rid

1059
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:38,760
of that by doing strip tail blow off

1060
00:37:35,920 --> 00:37:40,280
that spring soil moisture they also set

1061
00:37:38,760 --> 00:37:42,359
themselves up again this is a norm

1062
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:44,079
Clocky leaving the door open that soil

1063
00:37:42,359 --> 00:37:47,640
moisture leaves them all season long not

1064
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,359
just that time of year all year long so

1065
00:37:47,640 --> 00:37:52,200
again some people till the water out and

1066
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:53,520
they continue to lose the water all year

1067
00:37:52,200 --> 00:37:55,920
for me it's up to you what you do with

1068
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:58,319
the extra water that no tail saves you

1069
00:37:55,920 --> 00:38:00,200
know a drought year that's your crop

1070
00:37:58,319 --> 00:38:03,720
in a non drought year that's opportunity

1071
00:38:00,200 --> 00:38:05,560
to do something else you know irrigators

1072
00:38:03,720 --> 00:38:07,599
in Nebraska the average for Center per

1073
00:38:05,560 --> 00:38:09,720
irrigation is about $15 an acre inch

1074
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:13,040
saing five inches the low end is 75

1075
00:38:09,720 --> 00:38:15,440
bucks an acre more profit you're the dry

1076
00:38:13,040 --> 00:38:17,800
Lander the low end again remember I said

1077
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:21,040
5 to 12 corn responds about 12 bushels

1078
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:22,720
per acre inch 5 time 12 is 60 extra

1079
00:38:21,040 --> 00:38:25,720
bushels of

1080
00:38:22,720 --> 00:38:27,760
corn we are running at R moral Farm past

1081
00:38:25,720 --> 00:38:30,599
5 years we are more than 60 bushels of

1082
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:32,000
County average on a Noto corn we're

1083
00:38:30,599 --> 00:38:34,440
running over 200 Bush of corn where the

1084
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:39,920
county average is 140 that's where my

1085
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:43,720
extra water is beans 3 and2 Time 5 is

1086
00:38:39,920 --> 00:38:45,440
172 again that's extra profit if you use

1087
00:38:43,720 --> 00:38:47,680
your

1088
00:38:45,440 --> 00:38:49,599
water comes down to can you use your

1089
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,800
water can you store your water out west

1090
00:38:49,599 --> 00:38:51,960
used to be wheat F because they didn't

1091
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:53,400
think they had enough water grow crop

1092
00:38:51,960 --> 00:38:55,000
every year they're using noil using

1093
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:56,480
residue and they're raising the crop

1094
00:38:55,000 --> 00:38:58,440
every year they're using their extra

1095
00:38:56,480 --> 00:39:00,240
water noil gives them

1096
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:02,160
down South Oklahoma and Kansas used to

1097
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,760
be a lot of wheat fow they went to no

1098
00:39:02,160 --> 00:39:05,280
till they learned they can raise

1099
00:39:03,760 --> 00:39:06,280
continuous crops they went to no till

1100
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:08,400
and they actually learned they can use

1101
00:39:06,280 --> 00:39:10,079
double crop because they're growing

1102
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,079
wheat that uses less water in the

1103
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,200
offseason they go beans uses the water

1104
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:16,319
when the water is available comes down

1105
00:39:14,200 --> 00:39:18,000
to timing now when your water

1106
00:39:16,319 --> 00:39:19,599
available producer I know in

1107
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:21,680
Pennsylvania he says you know we got wet

1108
00:39:19,599 --> 00:39:22,960
Springs I grow alala because it's a high

1109
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,520
water Ed crop it starts using water

1110
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:26,920
clear back in March I take first cutting

1111
00:39:25,520 --> 00:39:29,160
and by then it's already used 8 to 10

1112
00:39:26,920 --> 00:39:31,160
inch of water he says I wait for

1113
00:39:29,160 --> 00:39:33,839
regrowth I plant corn I spray out the

1114
00:39:31,160 --> 00:39:37,440
alal and I raise good corn he gets 40

1115
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:39,480
inch of rain 10 15 went to the AL Alpha

1116
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:40,960
the rest went to the corn he says I got

1117
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,079
conventional till neighbors who plow up

1118
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:44,839
their Al Alpha to kill it set themselves

1119
00:39:43,079 --> 00:39:46,480
for erosion and runoff they plant their

1120
00:39:44,839 --> 00:39:47,520
corn and the erosion and runoff no water

1121
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,319
getting into the solar profile and their

1122
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:52,200
corn droughts out says I'm a no tell I

1123
00:39:50,319 --> 00:39:54,480
got two crops and they got zero they're

1124
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:58,960
using the extra

1125
00:39:54,480 --> 00:40:00,800
water extreme case in Nebraska

1126
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:03,119
after Corn Harvest plant wheat planted

1127
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:04,040
in skip RS you plant your soybeans that

1128
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:06,119
when you combine your wheat your

1129
00:40:04,040 --> 00:40:09,000
soybeans are already there they're using

1130
00:40:06,119 --> 00:40:11,240
extra water now I say extreme case in

1131
00:40:09,000 --> 00:40:13,400
Nebraska this is the Dryland corner on a

1132
00:40:11,240 --> 00:40:15,160
pivot the beans got up this high and

1133
00:40:13,400 --> 00:40:16,359
died because the wheat already used all

1134
00:40:15,160 --> 00:40:19,280
the

1135
00:40:16,359 --> 00:40:21,359
water now back east in Illinois Indiana

1136
00:40:19,280 --> 00:40:23,720
on in Ontario they love it they call it

1137
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,319
relay cropping we got a Living Root

1138
00:40:23,720 --> 00:40:27,680
there almost a year round with

1139
00:40:25,319 --> 00:40:30,040
irrigation we got that Living Root and

1140
00:40:27,680 --> 00:40:32,520
they're raising good wheat and good corn

1141
00:40:30,040 --> 00:40:33,319
or good soybeans using that extra water

1142
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,800
and they're keeping track of the

1143
00:40:33,319 --> 00:40:37,480
irrigation they it's only putting on six

1144
00:40:34,800 --> 00:40:39,400
extra inches of water because the no

1145
00:40:37,480 --> 00:40:42,480
tail and the rainfall they only need 60

1146
00:40:39,400 --> 00:40:45,359
extra for two crops in a year so again

1147
00:40:42,480 --> 00:40:47,839
think about using the water and again I

1148
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,760
look at how much water can you store we

1149
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:52,359
have some potential losses if we have a

1150
00:40:49,760 --> 00:40:54,040
c profile it's already full we get extra

1151
00:40:52,359 --> 00:40:55,599
water in Nebraska we have trouble with

1152
00:40:54,040 --> 00:40:58,040
deep percolation taking nitrogen down to

1153
00:40:55,599 --> 00:40:59,760
our drinking water if we use some of

1154
00:40:58,040 --> 00:41:01,440
that water growing a cover crop we

1155
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:02,280
reduce the nitrate leeching Dwayne is

1156
00:41:01,440 --> 00:41:05,400
going to talk more about Catch and

1157
00:41:02,280 --> 00:41:08,400
Release nutrients we have a crusted soil

1158
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:10,839
or saturated soil again we lose water

1159
00:41:08,400 --> 00:41:13,000
build structure protect it or if it's

1160
00:41:10,839 --> 00:41:16,000
unprotected soil we got evaporation we

1161
00:41:13,000 --> 00:41:18,599
lose water leave residue out there and

1162
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:20,280
again once you're full it's wasted now a

1163
00:41:18,599 --> 00:41:21,960
normal spring in Nebraska we hope to

1164
00:41:20,280 --> 00:41:22,760
have our solar moisture profile refilled

1165
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,680
by

1166
00:41:22,760 --> 00:41:28,480
March we don't plant till maybe April or

1167
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:30,960
May I got an opport for cover crop to

1168
00:41:28,480 --> 00:41:33,119
use water if it's going to be a dry year

1169
00:41:30,960 --> 00:41:35,920
maybe I'll look at a fall cover crop to

1170
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:39,480
empty out water in the fall such that I

1171
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:41,280
can save water in the spring you go huh

1172
00:41:39,480 --> 00:41:43,160
think about it if it's got a wet fall

1173
00:41:41,280 --> 00:41:44,359
and it fills up right away everything in

1174
00:41:43,160 --> 00:41:46,319
the winner is

1175
00:41:44,359 --> 00:41:48,800
wasted sometimes you make the cover crop

1176
00:41:46,319 --> 00:41:50,400
decision on the Fly And the main thing

1177
00:41:48,800 --> 00:41:51,720
is I want to grow the water rather than

1178
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:53,920
lose it because I'm going to be growing

1179
00:41:51,720 --> 00:41:55,880
root and growing soil structure talk

1180
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:59,560
quickly about cover crops here for my

1181
00:41:55,880 --> 00:42:01,720
last get 17 minutes that's not bad then

1182
00:41:59,560 --> 00:42:04,720
Ralph derps friend of mine he's a crop

1183
00:42:01,720 --> 00:42:06,800
consultant uh learned no tail back at

1184
00:42:04,720 --> 00:42:08,160
least 40 years ago and he's been sort of

1185
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:09,640
the leader in getting no started in

1186
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,760
South America he's living in Paraguay

1187
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:13,880
now but he started with German

1188
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,640
government he's gone into areas that

1189
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:17,880
have never been tilled never been farmed

1190
00:42:15,640 --> 00:42:19,680
before and they're planting no till and

1191
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:20,920
I say that because they're not used to

1192
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,079
the big tractors we have they're using a

1193
00:42:20,920 --> 00:42:24,400
lot smaller tractors they have not

1194
00:42:22,079 --> 00:42:26,280
invest in the horsepower for tillage

1195
00:42:24,400 --> 00:42:28,000
they've never seen the soil bear they

1196
00:42:26,280 --> 00:42:30,160
think it's logical to have it

1197
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:33,440
covered we've seen it be thanks to

1198
00:42:30,160 --> 00:42:35,160
Grandpa thanks to Dad so we're not used

1199
00:42:33,440 --> 00:42:36,880
to seeing the residue near as much but

1200
00:42:35,160 --> 00:42:38,040
they're out there planting and what

1201
00:42:36,880 --> 00:42:40,000
they're doing is they're using cover

1202
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:41,880
crops to provide extra carbon biomass to

1203
00:42:40,000 --> 00:42:44,280
the soil system to use some water to

1204
00:42:41,880 --> 00:42:46,319
protect the soil to build the soil and

1205
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:49,280
to them cover crops is a

1206
00:42:46,319 --> 00:42:50,920
no-brainer now the interesting thing I

1207
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,160
when you start thinking about it and we

1208
00:42:50,920 --> 00:42:56,119
saw this on slide earlier but we think

1209
00:42:54,160 --> 00:42:57,760
about when is the crop using water

1210
00:42:56,119 --> 00:43:00,480
when's the water available

1211
00:42:57,760 --> 00:43:02,480
our summer planted crops and you could

1212
00:43:00,480 --> 00:43:04,359
substitute just move this axis over and

1213
00:43:02,480 --> 00:43:06,359
call this fall or winter crops if you're

1214
00:43:04,359 --> 00:43:07,880
doing wheat but think about it they take

1215
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,400
off growing in the spring corn that's

1216
00:43:07,880 --> 00:43:11,880
sometime in May they're really actively

1217
00:43:09,400 --> 00:43:13,599
growing they reach a peak in July they

1218
00:43:11,880 --> 00:43:16,160
taper off that in September they're done

1219
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:18,839
using water that's when we produce the

1220
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:23,040
biomass that's when it uses the water

1221
00:43:18,839 --> 00:43:24,680
but from an ARS study where they took

1222
00:43:23,040 --> 00:43:27,280
this they said we missed some

1223
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:29,079
opportunities to produce I love their

1224
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:31,240
big words resource simulation dry matter

1225
00:43:29,079 --> 00:43:34,200
production I say they basically they're

1226
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:37,000
losing the opportunity to use some water

1227
00:43:34,200 --> 00:43:39,559
and some carbon dioxide and also

1228
00:43:37,000 --> 00:43:41,520
sunlight now think about it sunlight we

1229
00:43:39,559 --> 00:43:45,000
don't store at least not in the crop

1230
00:43:41,520 --> 00:43:48,480
field carbon dioxide we don't use in a

1231
00:43:45,000 --> 00:43:50,000
crop field in the off seon now when a

1232
00:43:48,480 --> 00:43:51,800
crop is growing there is so that's what

1233
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,280
the cover crop is for now water we can

1234
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:56,200
store and some people argue well this

1235
00:43:54,280 --> 00:43:57,720
water it's not really lost if I can

1236
00:43:56,200 --> 00:43:59,680
store it and use it for next crop but

1237
00:43:57,720 --> 00:44:01,280
too often I see where the soils might be

1238
00:43:59,680 --> 00:44:04,160
already full and this is now deep

1239
00:44:01,280 --> 00:44:05,720
leeching or it's deep percolation or

1240
00:44:04,160 --> 00:44:07,720
it's evaporation off an unprotected

1241
00:44:05,720 --> 00:44:10,200
surface in the spring with heavy spring

1242
00:44:07,720 --> 00:44:12,839
rains it is again again by planting a

1243
00:44:10,200 --> 00:44:14,359
cover crop I can use some water and

1244
00:44:12,839 --> 00:44:15,800
accumulate some biomass and more

1245
00:44:14,359 --> 00:44:18,040
importantly get some roots in that soil

1246
00:44:15,800 --> 00:44:19,760
and use some of that carbon dioxide and

1247
00:44:18,040 --> 00:44:21,559
sunlight rather than waste to it use

1248
00:44:19,760 --> 00:44:23,359
some water but I have to manage the

1249
00:44:21,559 --> 00:44:24,520
water and that's why I show the break

1250
00:44:23,359 --> 00:44:27,680
off

1251
00:44:24,520 --> 00:44:29,720
here if it is a wet spring you let that

1252
00:44:27,680 --> 00:44:31,160
covered crop grow longer use some water

1253
00:44:29,720 --> 00:44:33,559
because you got plenty of water and that

1254
00:44:31,160 --> 00:44:35,319
breakoff might even occur out here or if

1255
00:44:33,559 --> 00:44:37,839
it's a dry spring it might break off

1256
00:44:35,319 --> 00:44:39,720
here or if it's always dry in your area

1257
00:44:37,839 --> 00:44:42,119
PL a cover crop that winter kills and

1258
00:44:39,720 --> 00:44:43,960
there's nothing even appears here again

1259
00:44:42,119 --> 00:44:45,200
the water management is up to you a

1260
00:44:43,960 --> 00:44:47,280
little bit on your risk and a little bit

1261
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:48,200
on what you're trying to accomplish and

1262
00:44:47,280 --> 00:44:50,119
when I say what are you trying to

1263
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:52,240
accomplish again here's down in South

1264
00:44:50,119 --> 00:44:53,920
America when they first started raising

1265
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:55,400
soybeans down there a lot of people said

1266
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:56,640
well it's beans on beans every acre

1267
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,400
every year and that's what kills our

1268
00:44:56,640 --> 00:45:01,000
soybeans Market in the US I had an

1269
00:44:59,400 --> 00:45:02,720
opportunity to go down to Brazil and Ray

1270
00:45:01,000 --> 00:45:05,160
W was along that trip last year and we

1271
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:07,880
saw a lot of Acres beans on beans every

1272
00:45:05,160 --> 00:45:09,319
year but you know what after soybean

1273
00:45:07,880 --> 00:45:10,680
Harvest they had enough growing season

1274
00:45:09,319 --> 00:45:12,520
enough sunlight and carbon dioxide and

1275
00:45:10,680 --> 00:45:14,839
water they grew a cover crop this is

1276
00:45:12,520 --> 00:45:16,319
black oats in this case rolled down or

1277
00:45:14,839 --> 00:45:17,440
it could have been a short season forage

1278
00:45:16,319 --> 00:45:20,160
because they had livestock or it could

1279
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:22,319
have been corn or cotton and they grew

1280
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:24,480
those through the winter months again

1281
00:45:22,319 --> 00:45:26,599
using a crop groin when the water's

1282
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,640
available is what they're doing now when

1283
00:45:26,599 --> 00:45:31,160
it comes to The Pest Management beans on

1284
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:33,559
beans when that first rainstorm comes

1285
00:45:31,160 --> 00:45:35,119
and hits that black oats residue how

1286
00:45:33,559 --> 00:45:36,680
much Bean disease is going to Splash on

1287
00:45:35,119 --> 00:45:40,480
that new beans

1288
00:45:36,680 --> 00:45:43,480
crop none a cover crop can be a pest

1289
00:45:40,480 --> 00:45:45,800
management tool reducing Splash in this

1290
00:45:43,480 --> 00:45:48,119
case the thing I encircled here is this

1291
00:45:45,800 --> 00:45:49,960
tree in the background that's the same

1292
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:51,200
tree a few weeks later and you look at

1293
00:45:49,960 --> 00:45:52,400
that and say the beans don't look bad

1294
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:54,480
and you look at that and you go where

1295
00:45:52,400 --> 00:45:56,480
did the rest of that residue go the

1296
00:45:54,480 --> 00:45:58,000
biological life is digesting it putting

1297
00:45:56,480 --> 00:45:59,680
in the system and I said that's when I

1298
00:45:58,000 --> 00:46:02,160
want it to happen when the next crop is

1299
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:03,079
growing I thought it was pretty neat I

1300
00:46:02,160 --> 00:46:04,240
thought it was real neat when Ralph

1301
00:46:03,079 --> 00:46:06,520
showed me

1302
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,800
this that's what it does when you grow a

1303
00:46:06,520 --> 00:46:10,040
crop cover crop and using the sunlight

1304
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:12,599
and carbon dioxide when it's available

1305
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:14,200
using the water to grow the soil by

1306
00:46:12,599 --> 00:46:17,280
having that Living Root in there it's

1307
00:46:14,200 --> 00:46:19,839
feeding the soil system so what do you

1308
00:46:17,280 --> 00:46:21,040
grow I've got this seed box in my pickup

1309
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:22,520
right now these some different cover

1310
00:46:21,040 --> 00:46:23,680
crops I've planted in different plots

1311
00:46:22,520 --> 00:46:25,920
people always ask me what do you plant I

1312
00:46:23,680 --> 00:46:27,240
go what are you trying to do the laundry

1313
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:29,040
list that I borrowed from under Nebraska

1314
00:46:27,240 --> 00:46:31,119
nrcs and their cover crop plan they put

1315
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,640
erosion control on top that's what the

1316
00:46:31,119 --> 00:46:35,040
name actually come from is cover to

1317
00:46:33,640 --> 00:46:37,200
reduce the soil

1318
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:39,480
erosion if I want erosion control I want

1319
00:46:37,200 --> 00:46:41,880
to quit growing something like a grass

1320
00:46:39,480 --> 00:46:43,800
to get it up there and absorb rain do

1321
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:45,599
impact what if I'm doing nutrient

1322
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:46,800
capture nutrient cycling I want

1323
00:46:45,599 --> 00:46:48,240
something takes up a lot of nutrients

1324
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,800
and then releases it slowly next year

1325
00:46:48,240 --> 00:46:51,960
and again Dwayne's going talk catch to

1326
00:46:49,800 --> 00:46:53,839
release nutrients improve solo Health

1327
00:46:51,960 --> 00:46:55,599
any Living Root will do that water

1328
00:46:53,839 --> 00:46:58,599
management the two-edged

1329
00:46:55,599 --> 00:47:00,400
sword you use the water if you have it

1330
00:46:58,599 --> 00:47:01,839
or better yet grow some residue to keep

1331
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:04,359
the Sun and wind off the Sol surface to

1332
00:47:01,839 --> 00:47:06,599
conserve the water that you don't have

1333
00:47:04,359 --> 00:47:09,280
it can work both ways increase

1334
00:47:06,599 --> 00:47:11,280
biodiversity by simply getting a cool

1335
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,000
season versus a warm season a r versus a

1336
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:15,520
grass just change the biodiversity to

1337
00:47:13,000 --> 00:47:17,200
change that so biological life balance

1338
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:18,880
carbonation ratio if you want residue to

1339
00:47:17,200 --> 00:47:21,599
hang around a long time you want a high

1340
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:24,559
carbon out there corn stocks wheat straw

1341
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:26,200
will hang around a long time compared to

1342
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:27,359
peas or soybeans will break down in a

1343
00:47:26,200 --> 00:47:31,559
hurry because it's

1344
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:33,079
a low carbon higher nitrogen ratio well

1345
00:47:31,559 --> 00:47:34,160
again if I want to Decay my residue and

1346
00:47:33,079 --> 00:47:35,599
I got a lot of cornstalks or wheat

1347
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,000
stubble there put a legum out there you

1348
00:47:35,599 --> 00:47:39,359
Decay your residue in a hurry or if I'm

1349
00:47:38,000 --> 00:47:40,800
like me I got a lot of Sol biological

1350
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:43,200
life and I don't want to Decay as fast

1351
00:47:40,800 --> 00:47:45,040
I'm going to put more high carbon stuff

1352
00:47:43,200 --> 00:47:47,319
out there more Grass more Rye to get the

1353
00:47:45,040 --> 00:47:49,040
residue to hang around longer nitrogen

1354
00:47:47,319 --> 00:47:50,319
fixation that's with the early days most

1355
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,400
people looked at cover crops to grow

1356
00:47:50,319 --> 00:47:52,760
nitrogen because we were organic

1357
00:47:51,400 --> 00:47:54,760
producers before they invented

1358
00:47:52,760 --> 00:47:55,800
fertilizer well we got organic producers

1359
00:47:54,760 --> 00:47:57,040
or we got others who are cutting their

1360
00:47:55,800 --> 00:47:59,880
nitr because they're growing on their

1361
00:47:57,040 --> 00:48:02,200
own reduce compaction it's a two-edged

1362
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:03,960
sword there as well the one is yes it

1363
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:05,880
can when you got a good vigorous roote

1364
00:48:03,960 --> 00:48:06,960
growing but the more important thing is

1365
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:08,160
the good vigorous route actually

1366
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,720
provides some soil structure and

1367
00:48:08,160 --> 00:48:11,359
stability to reduce the compaction from

1368
00:48:09,720 --> 00:48:13,680
next trips on the field getting that

1369
00:48:11,359 --> 00:48:15,920
road out there weed suppression the

1370
00:48:13,680 --> 00:48:18,079
right selected cover crop can suppress

1371
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,280
the next weeds you just want to make

1372
00:48:18,079 --> 00:48:21,839
sure you select the right cover crop

1373
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:23,200
doesn't suppress your next crop and

1374
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:24,319
again that's why I can't tell you what

1375
00:48:23,200 --> 00:48:27,440
you need to plant because I don't know

1376
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:29,839
what you're doing next Forge of grazing

1377
00:48:27,440 --> 00:48:31,440
I do that for the soil system but again

1378
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:33,400
some years drought conditions maybe I

1379
00:48:31,440 --> 00:48:35,760
need that for my four-legged livestock e

1380
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:37,200
T-Bones out of and so again we got to

1381
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:38,640
think about it like I said a lot of

1382
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,800
cover crop tours out there you go out

1383
00:48:38,640 --> 00:48:41,079
there and look at them lot usually

1384
00:48:39,800 --> 00:48:42,880
they're planted in single species just

1385
00:48:41,079 --> 00:48:44,200
so you can see the individual crop you

1386
00:48:42,880 --> 00:48:47,440
get benefits of mixing them in a

1387
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:49,319
cocktail the benefits build and it's uh

1388
00:48:47,440 --> 00:48:51,119
really helps you out that way but this

1389
00:48:49,319 --> 00:48:52,799
is a set of legumes then see how much

1390
00:48:51,119 --> 00:48:56,319
nitrogen they fix planted into wheat

1391
00:48:52,799 --> 00:49:00,280
stubble or this case into wheat stubble

1392
00:48:56,319 --> 00:49:01,559
cover he used a sorum sedan grows in the

1393
00:49:00,280 --> 00:49:04,280
heat in summer doesn't use a lot of

1394
00:49:01,559 --> 00:49:05,880
water but the good news is it's up and

1395
00:49:04,280 --> 00:49:08,319
growing that when his pastures and

1396
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:10,799
rangeland need a rest he can put the

1397
00:49:08,319 --> 00:49:13,359
livestock over here and they got feed

1398
00:49:10,799 --> 00:49:16,640
recovery time on pasture and rangeland

1399
00:49:13,359 --> 00:49:19,319
is worth big bucks that'll pay for your

1400
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:21,440
cover crop because you get the cattle

1401
00:49:19,319 --> 00:49:23,240
off of there so again we got to think

1402
00:49:21,440 --> 00:49:25,880
about how we manage the

1403
00:49:23,240 --> 00:49:26,960
system again with selecting a cover crop

1404
00:49:25,880 --> 00:49:28,720
first question what do you want Want To

1405
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:30,880
Do With It Go on a planet because it's

1406
00:49:28,720 --> 00:49:33,079
the hottest topic out there that's not

1407
00:49:30,880 --> 00:49:34,520
the reason to do it that's why so many

1408
00:49:33,079 --> 00:49:35,880
lemings go over the cliff they've never

1409
00:49:34,520 --> 00:49:39,160
asked why it's just everyone else is

1410
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:40,720
doing it no why do you want to do it

1411
00:49:39,160 --> 00:49:42,720
again what do you select then can you

1412
00:49:40,720 --> 00:49:43,760
grow it it doesn't matter if it's

1413
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:45,880
something that really works great in

1414
00:49:43,760 --> 00:49:47,000
South America and they can't grow here

1415
00:49:45,880 --> 00:49:48,559
black oats for instance if you want to

1416
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:50,000
raise black oats for seed you got to

1417
00:49:48,559 --> 00:49:52,440
move South a long ways it only takes

1418
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,680
about 170 days to mature it now for a

1419
00:49:52,440 --> 00:49:57,200
cover crop I don't need 170 days because

1420
00:49:54,680 --> 00:49:59,599
it doesn't need to mature can you manage

1421
00:49:57,200 --> 00:50:01,880
it can you kill it can you plant it can

1422
00:49:59,599 --> 00:50:04,839
you row again you would select something

1423
00:50:01,880 --> 00:50:06,720
you can't will it affect the next crop

1424
00:50:04,839 --> 00:50:08,280
one of my favorite examples is at

1425
00:50:06,720 --> 00:50:09,559
Harvest time when you're hauling wheat

1426
00:50:08,280 --> 00:50:11,200
to the elevator and they refuse it

1427
00:50:09,559 --> 00:50:13,559
because of

1428
00:50:11,200 --> 00:50:15,440
scab and someone walks up to you and say

1429
00:50:13,559 --> 00:50:17,960
I'll buy that wheat from you because I'm

1430
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,960
going to use it as a cover crop seed

1431
00:50:17,960 --> 00:50:24,079
you'd be glad just to sell it right well

1432
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:25,720
I plant that scab wheat as a cover crop

1433
00:50:24,079 --> 00:50:27,079
and it comes up and I spray it up before

1434
00:50:25,720 --> 00:50:29,280
it makes a head and every gets heads

1435
00:50:27,079 --> 00:50:32,079
scab who cares I'm planting my next crop

1436
00:50:29,280 --> 00:50:35,040
is soybeans who cares I plant my next

1437
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,280
crop is corn you serum heads scab and

1438
00:50:35,040 --> 00:50:39,440
ferium stock crot is the same ferium

1439
00:50:37,280 --> 00:50:41,119
guys you just shot yourself in a foot

1440
00:50:39,440 --> 00:50:43,160
when it come to raising corn if you use

1441
00:50:41,119 --> 00:50:46,200
wheat as a cover crop in front and had

1442
00:50:43,160 --> 00:50:48,119
ferium so again will it affect the next

1443
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:50,680
crop I see the same thing with

1444
00:50:48,119 --> 00:50:53,359
sunflowers and white mold things like

1445
00:50:50,680 --> 00:50:55,760
that so be careful what would the seed

1446
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:57,640
cost my cheapest cover crop seed has

1447
00:50:55,760 --> 00:50:59,599
been floor sweepings

1448
00:50:57,640 --> 00:51:01,920
well my next cheapest has been bin run

1449
00:50:59,599 --> 00:51:03,480
grein serum you know Milo is not worth

1450
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:06,280
much Milo is planted at 5 pounds the

1451
00:51:03,480 --> 00:51:07,799
acre Bush Milo 56 pounds it'll P 10

1452
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:10,440
acres for about three bucks four bucks

1453
00:51:07,799 --> 00:51:13,200
five bucks depending upon the price Milo

1454
00:51:10,440 --> 00:51:14,400
is a warm seasoned grass following wheat

1455
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:18,119
it's perfect because that's the cool

1456
00:51:14,400 --> 00:51:19,799
season grass so again how does it fit

1457
00:51:18,119 --> 00:51:22,359
what will the seed cost the best is what

1458
00:51:19,799 --> 00:51:24,319
is left in your seed shed when you're

1459
00:51:22,359 --> 00:51:25,960
done seeding dump it all together and

1460
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,200
plant it because you know you can grow

1461
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:30,599
it all well help the so system I sure

1462
00:51:28,200 --> 00:51:32,640
hope so that's why I'm doing it and

1463
00:51:30,599 --> 00:51:35,440
again some cover crops won't help as

1464
00:51:32,640 --> 00:51:36,520
much again different species out there

1465
00:51:35,440 --> 00:51:39,319
there's

1466
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:44,319
flax flax I used to not think too much

1467
00:51:39,319 --> 00:51:47,799
of it until we had 2in hail for 20

1468
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:49,119
minutes with two inches of rain with 80

1469
00:51:47,799 --> 00:51:51,319
mph

1470
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:54,240
winds everything in the area was

1471
00:51:51,319 --> 00:51:56,160
destroyed except for my flax cover crop

1472
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:57,760
this isn't it this is a different plot

1473
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,559
the FL cover crop is such a small

1474
00:51:57,760 --> 00:52:00,599
spining thing it sprang back up and the

1475
00:51:59,559 --> 00:52:04,119
day after the hill storm you're walking

1476
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:06,160
out there go how come it Miss that strip

1477
00:52:04,119 --> 00:52:08,760
it didn't that plant was that

1478
00:52:06,160 --> 00:52:10,920
resilient now I contrast that to this

1479
00:52:08,760 --> 00:52:13,440
one right next to it that's sunm it's a

1480
00:52:10,920 --> 00:52:15,119
legum fixes nitrogen Sun hemp as a name

1481
00:52:13,440 --> 00:52:17,839
implies is a

1482
00:52:15,119 --> 00:52:20,720
rope I would spray that out sooner than

1483
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:22,880
this producer did because you know as a

1484
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:24,920
rope any residue mover on your planter

1485
00:52:22,880 --> 00:52:27,599
it's turning wraps up so tight that you

1486
00:52:24,920 --> 00:52:29,440
need a torch to get it out

1487
00:52:27,599 --> 00:52:31,720
this producer says don't run residue

1488
00:52:29,440 --> 00:52:34,640
movers you just plant right through it I

1489
00:52:31,720 --> 00:52:37,040
go that works he goes great it works so

1490
00:52:34,640 --> 00:52:39,440
again what are you after if you're after

1491
00:52:37,040 --> 00:52:41,640
residue cover grasses will provide that

1492
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,839
fastest if you're after nitrogen it has

1493
00:52:41,640 --> 00:52:46,040
to be a legum and you have to inoculate

1494
00:52:43,839 --> 00:52:47,720
it with a proper inoculant for that

1495
00:52:46,040 --> 00:52:49,559
species just because you've planted

1496
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:51,079
soybeans before doesn't mean their isob

1497
00:52:49,559 --> 00:52:52,839
are there it's going to help you on peas

1498
00:52:51,079 --> 00:52:55,559
or vet or even alphalpha they're all

1499
00:52:52,839 --> 00:52:56,839
different you use the right one brascas

1500
00:52:55,559 --> 00:52:58,599
a lot of people look at them getting rid

1501
00:52:56,839 --> 00:53:00,240
of the compaction because the Braska

1502
00:52:58,599 --> 00:53:02,680
family includes the oil seed radish and

1503
00:53:00,240 --> 00:53:05,359
the turnips those big Roots but they're

1504
00:53:02,680 --> 00:53:06,720
also notorious for residue cycling

1505
00:53:05,359 --> 00:53:07,599
because they will break down the residue

1506
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,799
underneath

1507
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:12,839
them others the others category that's I

1508
00:53:10,799 --> 00:53:15,520
already showed you flax that's not any

1509
00:53:12,839 --> 00:53:17,559
of these sunflowers is other

1510
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:19,559
biodiversity is what I'm after cool

1511
00:53:17,559 --> 00:53:21,359
season versus warm season it's pretty

1512
00:53:19,559 --> 00:53:23,119
obvious to really get the good growth

1513
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:25,319
you plant the opposite what your cash

1514
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,880
crop is following wheat Harvest a cool

1515
00:53:25,319 --> 00:53:29,839
season crop I do a warm SE seon because

1516
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:32,200
In The Heat Of July and August you want

1517
00:53:29,839 --> 00:53:34,480
a warm season sorum Sudan or soybeans or

1518
00:53:32,200 --> 00:53:36,040
cow peas that grow out there now going

1519
00:53:34,480 --> 00:53:38,319
the other way after a warm season crop

1520
00:53:36,040 --> 00:53:40,119
like Corner soybeans I'm going to go

1521
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:43,240
cool season my aern winter peas even a

1522
00:53:40,119 --> 00:53:45,880
spring pea oats all my cool season crops

1523
00:53:43,240 --> 00:53:47,359
grass versus broadleaf versus cocktail

1524
00:53:45,880 --> 00:53:49,440
again that's balancing the carbon

1525
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:51,960
nitrogen ratio cocktail gets you the

1526
00:53:49,440 --> 00:53:54,839
balance of everything and it gives you

1527
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:57,839
some risk management as well what if it

1528
00:53:54,839 --> 00:53:59,960
is too hot and dry and the cool season

1529
00:53:57,839 --> 00:54:03,359
legum you planted burned up while my

1530
00:53:59,960 --> 00:54:05,319
warm season grass might be still growing

1531
00:54:03,359 --> 00:54:07,559
so again it gives you some management if

1532
00:54:05,319 --> 00:54:09,640
you need to learn more about cover crops

1533
00:54:07,559 --> 00:54:11,720
ARS out of Mandan put together this

1534
00:54:09,640 --> 00:54:15,200
periodic table just like the one you

1535
00:54:11,720 --> 00:54:19,280
hated in chemistry it is sorted by down

1536
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:21,760
the column the related again grasses

1537
00:54:19,280 --> 00:54:23,839
down the ends simpler things on top more

1538
00:54:21,760 --> 00:54:26,119
complex than the bottom then it's

1539
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,200
grouped also within column by legumes

1540
00:54:26,119 --> 00:54:30,119
here Broad Leaf here warm season cool

1541
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:32,760
season and they got these little

1542
00:54:30,119 --> 00:54:34,960
footnote things in the corners here on

1543
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,920
their life cycle their water use and how

1544
00:54:34,960 --> 00:54:39,400
they grow again you'll say huh well if

1545
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:40,760
I'm in an area of wind erosion I want an

1546
00:54:39,400 --> 00:54:42,799
upright if I'm in an area of water

1547
00:54:40,760 --> 00:54:44,200
erosion I want something that lays flat

1548
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:46,040
again just think about differences what

1549
00:54:44,200 --> 00:54:48,359
you need out there but then you're

1550
00:54:46,040 --> 00:54:50,040
saying okay what the world's a looping

1551
00:54:48,359 --> 00:54:52,000
you click on that and if you run it

1552
00:54:50,040 --> 00:54:53,160
online it goes straight to the file or

1553
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:55,400
you can download it to your computer

1554
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:57,760
it's a PDF file it's available again on

1555
00:54:55,400 --> 00:54:59,319
that website you click on loopin and it

1556
00:54:57,760 --> 00:55:00,880
comes up saying here's what it looks

1557
00:54:59,319 --> 00:55:03,799
like here's what it is cool season Broad

1558
00:55:00,880 --> 00:55:05,160
Leaf legume goes down low water use acid

1559
00:55:03,799 --> 00:55:08,200
soil if you're going to feed it it's got

1560
00:55:05,160 --> 00:55:10,680
some protein if you want the bonus

1561
00:55:08,200 --> 00:55:12,359
points in your CSP plan it attracts the

1562
00:55:10,680 --> 00:55:15,280
pollinators you know what it doesn't

1563
00:55:12,359 --> 00:55:17,359
form my micis

1564
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,960
associations again will it build soil

1565
00:55:17,359 --> 00:55:21,480
this one not as fast because it's not

1566
00:55:18,960 --> 00:55:22,960
going to help the fungi near as much or

1567
00:55:21,480 --> 00:55:24,240
you click on serial Ry one of my

1568
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:27,640
favorites because I don't raise a lot of

1569
00:55:24,240 --> 00:55:30,200
wheat in our area uh cool season grass

1570
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:32,280
following Corner soybeans it's great

1571
00:55:30,200 --> 00:55:34,960
anel upright upright catches more snow

1572
00:55:32,280 --> 00:55:36,319
for me high water use well that's why I

1573
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:37,760
be careful when I kill it in the spring

1574
00:55:36,319 --> 00:55:40,960
do I kill it late or early is it a wet

1575
00:55:37,760 --> 00:55:43,720
or dry spring go on down here you know

1576
00:55:40,960 --> 00:55:45,079
uh will form micro Riz Association very

1577
00:55:43,720 --> 00:55:47,559
good at Scavenging

1578
00:55:45,079 --> 00:55:49,039
nitrogen again once you decide why you

1579
00:55:47,559 --> 00:55:50,280
need a cover crop you can go to a table

1580
00:55:49,039 --> 00:55:52,559
like this and help you decide which

1581
00:55:50,280 --> 00:55:54,720
cover crop do you need again the

1582
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:56,760
cocktails are nice here's after wheat

1583
00:55:54,720 --> 00:55:59,000
Harvest a cocktail it had a cool season

1584
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:00,920
legum warm season legon brasas warm

1585
00:55:59,000 --> 00:56:02,559
season grass cool season grass this is

1586
00:56:00,920 --> 00:56:05,119
after the first Frost the warm season

1587
00:56:02,559 --> 00:56:06,640
grass of the Sorghum sedan frosted off

1588
00:56:05,119 --> 00:56:08,319
the cool season grasses underneath are

1589
00:56:06,640 --> 00:56:10,400
still growing in fact they'll really

1590
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:12,000
take off now that the weather cool down

1591
00:56:10,400 --> 00:56:13,319
likewise the brasas are still growing

1592
00:56:12,000 --> 00:56:14,960
down here they'll take cooler

1593
00:56:13,319 --> 00:56:16,280
temperatures again when you start

1594
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:18,760
thinking about managing the cover crop

1595
00:56:16,280 --> 00:56:21,440
can you kill it can you manage it a

1596
00:56:18,760 --> 00:56:22,760
cover crop roller rollers work great on

1597
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:24,400
a single species because you know

1598
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:25,720
exactly when to roll it you're supposed

1599
00:56:24,400 --> 00:56:27,280
to roll it about the time it's star to

1600
00:56:25,720 --> 00:56:29,720
do reproduction

1601
00:56:27,280 --> 00:56:31,559
now you got this cocktail mix here when

1602
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:34,599
do you roll

1603
00:56:31,559 --> 00:56:36,200
that I'm not exactly sure well wait a

1604
00:56:34,599 --> 00:56:37,240
minute if this already Frost killed and

1605
00:56:36,200 --> 00:56:38,880
the rest of this is going to frost kill

1606
00:56:37,240 --> 00:56:40,799
maybe I don't even need to worry about a

1607
00:56:38,880 --> 00:56:42,640
roller so again how you're going to

1608
00:56:40,799 --> 00:56:44,240
terminate depends what you're growing

1609
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:45,520
the cover crop rollers they love them in

1610
00:56:44,240 --> 00:56:48,079
South

1611
00:56:45,520 --> 00:56:51,400
America here's again from Ralph derps

1612
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:53,359
this is a black oats crop rolled down no

1613
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,559
herbicide those that black oats is

1614
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,079
expressing all the weeds raising that

1615
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:00,079
corn so again weed control there some

1616
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:01,920
guys say I can use till to terminate the

1617
00:57:00,079 --> 00:57:03,880
cover crop remember they told us for

1618
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,119
years you plow under that green manure

1619
00:57:03,880 --> 00:57:07,920
crop when it comes to soil biological

1620
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,920
life is exactly the worst thing to do

1621
00:57:07,920 --> 00:57:13,319
yes I put that residue into the soil but

1622
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:15,200
I destroyed a lot of other stuff as well

1623
00:57:13,319 --> 00:57:17,520
we got a grad student in Nebraska

1624
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:20,760
working my PhD in organic weed control

1625
00:57:17,520 --> 00:57:23,160
using cover crops he had two four six

1626
00:57:20,760 --> 00:57:24,319
and eight species cover crops he found

1627
00:57:23,160 --> 00:57:26,680
that once you got to six or eight

1628
00:57:24,319 --> 00:57:28,160
species you could suppress weeds

1629
00:57:26,680 --> 00:57:30,440
when you're down at two or four you

1630
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:32,079
actually almost increased weeds he found

1631
00:57:30,440 --> 00:57:33,280
that when you terminate with a disc you

1632
00:57:32,079 --> 00:57:34,920
increased weeds because you planted

1633
00:57:33,280 --> 00:57:37,319
every weed seed and you got R rid of the

1634
00:57:34,920 --> 00:57:39,559
benefit when he used a blade undercutter

1635
00:57:37,319 --> 00:57:42,559
and he left the residue on top then the

1636
00:57:39,559 --> 00:57:44,680
8pc cover crop paid for the ganing

1637
00:57:42,559 --> 00:57:46,000
production so again we got to think

1638
00:57:44,680 --> 00:57:47,799
about what's going on out there don't

1639
00:57:46,000 --> 00:57:50,760
use tillage to kill it guys use the

1640
00:57:47,799 --> 00:57:54,079
herbicide use the roller or you PL into

1641
00:57:50,760 --> 00:57:55,720
it wait before I can tell you to do that

1642
00:57:54,079 --> 00:57:58,280
check with your RMA check with your

1643
00:57:55,720 --> 00:57:59,799
insurance check with your FSA in

1644
00:57:58,280 --> 00:58:01,640
Nebraska I can guarantee you if you do

1645
00:57:59,799 --> 00:58:04,039
this your crop is not

1646
00:58:01,640 --> 00:58:05,839
insurable if you plant into a cover crop

1647
00:58:04,039 --> 00:58:08,359
or worse yet if your cover crop even

1648
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:10,480
heads or buds your next crop is not

1649
00:58:08,359 --> 00:58:12,440
insurable we have to kill our cover crop

1650
00:58:10,480 --> 00:58:14,559
early in Nebraska if you want crop

1651
00:58:12,440 --> 00:58:16,319
insurance but you know what Terry Taylor

1652
00:58:14,559 --> 00:58:17,559
in Illinois he's got excess water he's

1653
00:58:16,319 --> 00:58:19,559
growing the excess water out he's

1654
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:21,000
planting he's got beautiful mols there

1655
00:58:19,559 --> 00:58:22,680
that planter actually was this cover

1656
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:25,000
crop roller who really knocked it back

1657
00:58:22,680 --> 00:58:27,079
for him and his one poster herbicide

1658
00:58:25,000 --> 00:58:28,559
took care of the rest of it

1659
00:58:27,079 --> 00:58:31,000
he didn't have pre didn't have a whole

1660
00:58:28,559 --> 00:58:32,960
bunch of other stuff out there but again

1661
00:58:31,000 --> 00:58:34,359
we start thinking about it think about

1662
00:58:32,960 --> 00:58:36,760
growing it terminating it but why are

1663
00:58:34,359 --> 00:58:39,039
you growing it it's going to increase

1664
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,880
that soil biological life if you have a

1665
00:58:39,039 --> 00:58:42,160
soil surface that has no residue and you

1666
00:58:40,880 --> 00:58:44,200
got a lot of

1667
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,200
evaporation use a little bit of water to

1668
00:58:44,200 --> 00:58:47,400
grow the cover it reduces evaporation I

1669
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,359
got to throw up some data and you

1670
00:58:47,400 --> 00:58:53,640
mentioned the group up at uh Marlin RoR

1671
00:58:50,359 --> 00:58:56,680
up in uh North Dakota bismar you had

1672
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:58,680
about 15 inches of annual rain after p

1673
00:58:56,680 --> 00:59:00,000
Harvest he had very little residue he

1674
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,839
planted a cover

1675
00:59:00,000 --> 00:59:04,359
crop it all Frost killed the next spring

1676
00:59:02,839 --> 00:59:05,839
he had beautiful residue and over here

1677
00:59:04,359 --> 00:59:07,359
he had no residue and over here he had

1678
00:59:05,839 --> 00:59:08,680
weeds where he had the residue he had

1679
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:10,559
less weeds so he saved a herbicide

1680
00:59:08,680 --> 00:59:12,319
application he had the residue there it

1681
00:59:10,559 --> 00:59:14,359
saved water and when they took these

1682
00:59:12,319 --> 00:59:16,920
measurements the day of corn planting in

1683
00:59:14,359 --> 00:59:19,280
May going down to 4

1684
00:59:16,920 --> 00:59:20,839
foot basically no difference what's

1685
00:59:19,280 --> 00:59:21,960
interesting is look on top where there

1686
00:59:20,839 --> 00:59:25,039
was no

1687
00:59:21,960 --> 00:59:28,160
cover the soil was exposed and it dried

1688
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:30,039
out where he had cover he actually saved

1689
00:59:28,160 --> 00:59:32,680
water near the soil surface to plant

1690
00:59:30,039 --> 00:59:36,359
into so numbers I got from

1691
00:59:32,680 --> 00:59:38,240
Dwayne he only went to 3 feet and this

1692
00:59:36,359 --> 00:59:39,559
is 20-inch rainfall area onto a wheat

1693
00:59:38,240 --> 00:59:41,079
stubble again with a cover crop that

1694
00:59:39,559 --> 00:59:43,079
Frost killed this is spring planting

1695
00:59:41,079 --> 00:59:44,720
time he had more moisture near the

1696
00:59:43,079 --> 00:59:47,559
surface because he kept the Sun and wind

1697
00:59:44,720 --> 00:59:50,119
off the so surface and not only then all

1698
00:59:47,559 --> 00:59:51,720
the way until the crop canopy took over

1699
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:54,079
so it saves even more water going into

1700
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:56,720
the next season the cover crop

1701
00:59:54,079 --> 00:59:58,359
does again here's on our Rogers Memorial

1702
00:59:56,720 --> 01:00:00,960
Farm has two Bush of corn the day after

1703
00:59:58,359 --> 01:00:03,039
harvest I'm planting a cover crop Austin

1704
01:00:00,960 --> 01:00:04,480
winter peeas a lot of people say you got

1705
01:00:03,039 --> 01:00:05,680
too much residue there you know what

1706
01:00:04,480 --> 01:00:07,000
that drill just put the residue in

1707
01:00:05,680 --> 01:00:10,480
contact with the soo microbes this is

1708
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,079
long-term no tail next spring March one

1709
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:14,839
this is the same field we're also

1710
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:16,240
where's all my residue so microbes are

1711
01:00:14,839 --> 01:00:18,480
digesting at the cover crop is starting

1712
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:21,520
to grow that's Austin winter peeas March

1713
01:00:18,480 --> 01:00:24,039
15th by the time it came time to plant

1714
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:26,720
about April 20th those a peas fixed

1715
01:00:24,039 --> 01:00:29,240
about 90 pounds of nitrogen I paid for

1716
01:00:26,720 --> 01:00:31,920
the cover crop it cycled my

1717
01:00:29,240 --> 01:00:34,240
residue I'm getting excited about cover

1718
01:00:31,920 --> 01:00:36,079
crops here's Keith glue extension

1719
01:00:34,240 --> 01:00:37,440
educator plant some 20-inch corn in this

1720
01:00:36,079 --> 01:00:40,319
demonstration plot this is irrigated

1721
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:42,799
corn on corn with a Sero R cover crop we

1722
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:44,240
had corn Ry cover crop corn R cover crop

1723
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,839
R corn cover crop this is the fourth

1724
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:49,039
year corn we took a conventional tilled

1725
01:00:46,839 --> 01:00:51,440
field and with seven crops remember four

1726
01:00:49,039 --> 01:00:53,240
corn three cover crops we stepped up

1727
01:00:51,440 --> 01:00:55,640
biological activity such that here's the

1728
01:00:53,240 --> 01:00:57,200
rise sprayed out we're planting the corn

1729
01:00:55,640 --> 01:00:59,880
here's a few weeks

1730
01:00:57,200 --> 01:01:02,359
later where's all the Rye residue

1731
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,280
where's all the irrigated corn residue

1732
01:01:02,359 --> 01:01:08,599
breaking down because of the biological

1733
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,839
activity fly it on could be an option in

1734
01:01:08,599 --> 01:01:11,640
soybeans we're getting good luck in

1735
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:13,119
Nebraska because the soybeans we do it

1736
01:01:11,640 --> 01:01:14,640
right before Leaf Drop the seed falls

1737
01:01:13,119 --> 01:01:17,319
down in the ground the leaves cover it

1738
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:20,079
up it's the mulch the soybean mulch

1739
01:01:17,319 --> 01:01:22,319
allows the cover crop to grow in

1740
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,640
corn you fly it on there's a lot up here

1741
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:27,079
in the leaves never make it to the soil

1742
01:01:24,640 --> 01:01:28,240
until the combine runs

1743
01:01:27,079 --> 01:01:30,039
and you don't make the mulch like the

1744
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:32,400
dropping leaves do we don't recommend it

1745
01:01:30,039 --> 01:01:34,280
in Nebraska and corn in fact Lor Alor

1746
01:01:32,400 --> 01:01:36,960
nrd will pay the cost of the flying to

1747
01:01:34,280 --> 01:01:40,599
put it on because they want the erosion

1748
01:01:36,960 --> 01:01:41,839
control helicopter they're using that

1749
01:01:40,599 --> 01:01:44,160
the fun thing about a helicopter doesn't

1750
01:01:41,839 --> 01:01:45,799
have to return to the airport they put

1751
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:48,280
the totes out the day

1752
01:01:45,799 --> 01:01:50,640
before each tote held enough seed for 40

1753
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:53,079
acres helicopter just dropped the tote

1754
01:01:50,640 --> 01:01:57,200
slid to the side dump the tote in they

1755
01:01:53,079 --> 01:01:58,559
did 1300 acres in one afternoon

1756
01:01:57,200 --> 01:02:00,880
and it looks like this then at Harvest

1757
01:01:58,559 --> 01:02:02,880
Time this is a sandy soil couldn't store

1758
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:04,079
all the offseason prip his cover crops

1759
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:06,079
already growing when he combine the

1760
01:02:04,079 --> 01:02:07,599
beans protection is there keeping the

1761
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:10,319
Sun and wind off the soil surface this

1762
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:13,640
producer reported those Bean the cover

1763
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:15,160
crop corn did about 20 bushel per acre

1764
01:02:13,640 --> 01:02:17,000
better than where he had Sandy soils

1765
01:02:15,160 --> 01:02:18,799
without a cover crop because he kept the

1766
01:02:17,000 --> 01:02:21,599
Sun and wind off the soil

1767
01:02:18,799 --> 01:02:24,240
surface other guys spread it with dry

1768
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:26,359
fertilizer guys in Iowa do a lot of that

1769
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,279
mix their 1152 with some cover crop seed

1770
01:02:26,359 --> 01:02:28,400
when they go out there and spin it they

1771
01:02:27,279 --> 01:02:31,039
get enough rain they get the fertilizer

1772
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:32,359
on they get the cover crop up some guys

1773
01:02:31,039 --> 01:02:33,520
use the drill they're putting on the

1774
01:02:32,359 --> 01:02:36,079
fertilizer for the next crop they're

1775
01:02:33,520 --> 01:02:37,319
putting on a cover crop for this crop

1776
01:02:36,079 --> 01:02:39,720
again different ways of getting it out

1777
01:02:37,319 --> 01:02:41,480
there some put it with the manure now

1778
01:02:39,720 --> 01:02:42,880
dry feed lot manure is a little hard but

1779
01:02:41,480 --> 01:02:44,279
a lot of Michigan work and Pennsylvania

1780
01:02:42,880 --> 01:02:46,760
work mixing in with slurry when they

1781
01:02:44,279 --> 01:02:48,440
spread the slurry it gets incorporated

1782
01:02:46,760 --> 01:02:49,960
or they spread it with a dry spreader

1783
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:51,200
and then they do a manure application

1784
01:02:49,960 --> 01:02:53,720
across the top like with an airway or

1785
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:56,119
something they incorporate it or in this

1786
01:02:53,720 --> 01:02:58,119
case feed lot manure spread hair bar to

1787
01:02:56,119 --> 01:03:00,640
smooth it out the drill then cut up the

1788
01:02:58,119 --> 01:03:02,760
rest of the residue and this is actually

1789
01:03:00,640 --> 01:03:05,079
great to reduce nutrient runoff loss

1790
01:03:02,760 --> 01:03:06,440
from surface Supply manure because a lot

1791
01:03:05,079 --> 01:03:09,119
of those nutrients are now tied up in a

1792
01:03:06,440 --> 01:03:12,279
biological form be released

1793
01:03:09,119 --> 01:03:13,680
later in corn I say we don't fly it on

1794
01:03:12,279 --> 01:03:15,119
if you got hybrid SE corn production

1795
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:17,400
there's not much canopy there they do

1796
01:03:15,119 --> 01:03:18,880
fly on at hybrid SE corn production or

1797
01:03:17,400 --> 01:03:20,920
they do it when they destroy the mail

1798
01:03:18,880 --> 01:03:22,880
row here's the cover crop already

1799
01:03:20,920 --> 01:03:24,240
starting to come up here's a few weeks

1800
01:03:22,880 --> 01:03:27,000
later when the corn was

1801
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,520
harvested I like that hybrid sea corn

1802
01:03:27,000 --> 01:03:32,760
production you over fertilize and

1803
01:03:28,520 --> 01:03:32,760
overwater the cover crops an excellent

1804
01:03:33,039 --> 01:03:37,279
scavenger we already saw a couple of

1805
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,880
these I'm going repeat them here's a

1806
01:03:37,279 --> 01:03:41,160
seed corn producer that's got a det

1807
01:03:38,880 --> 01:03:42,680
tassler he says I detassel my hybrid

1808
01:03:41,160 --> 01:03:44,520
Seed corn but you know what the tassel

1809
01:03:42,680 --> 01:03:46,279
is not needed in regular corn AFF

1810
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,799
pollinated he goes out there and need

1811
01:03:46,279 --> 01:03:50,240
hous regular corn and he's blowing cover

1812
01:03:47,799 --> 01:03:50,240
crop seed

1813
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:55,359
underneath we already saw this one a lot

1814
01:03:53,960 --> 01:03:57,160
of guys say we can't cover much ground

1815
01:03:55,359 --> 01:03:59,760
you know what

1816
01:03:57,160 --> 01:04:02,799
at it's a nice cover build a bigger

1817
01:03:59,760 --> 01:04:05,440
spreader this is 90 ft

1818
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:09,400
wide you can cover some

1819
01:04:05,440 --> 01:04:09,400
ground this one's got some ground

1820
01:04:09,520 --> 01:04:13,000
clearance and again they're doing that

1821
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:16,200
to get the cover crop seated in that

1822
01:04:13,000 --> 01:04:18,640
growing corn but again talk to your

1823
01:04:16,200 --> 01:04:20,760
insurance man in Illinois they can do

1824
01:04:18,640 --> 01:04:21,799
that in Nebraska if I see that cover

1825
01:04:20,760 --> 01:04:23,839
crop and growing corn they're going to

1826
01:04:21,799 --> 01:04:27,119
say there new crops growing and your

1827
01:04:23,839 --> 01:04:30,440
previous crop is no longer insured

1828
01:04:27,119 --> 01:04:33,039
depends talk to them before you do it

1829
01:04:30,440 --> 01:04:34,440
again summary after low residue crop

1830
01:04:33,039 --> 01:04:38,359
let's grow some

1831
01:04:34,440 --> 01:04:40,720
residue after corn Sage or wheat because

1832
01:04:38,359 --> 01:04:43,359
there I've got a longer growing season

1833
01:04:40,720 --> 01:04:44,839
to do that and again here's the one that

1834
01:04:43,359 --> 01:04:47,079
catches a lot of people by surprise if

1835
01:04:44,839 --> 01:04:49,720
you got a Sandy so can't can't store all

1836
01:04:47,079 --> 01:04:51,720
your offseason preset maybe a cover crop

1837
01:04:49,720 --> 01:04:54,240
something to consider use the water when

1838
01:04:51,720 --> 01:04:58,520
it's available rather than lose

1839
01:04:54,240 --> 01:05:01,160
it biging the soil that black is the

1840
01:04:58,520 --> 01:05:02,960
roots get more Roots out there pero

1841
01:05:01,160 --> 01:05:05,400
crops cover crops drilled crops winter

1842
01:05:02,960 --> 01:05:08,880
crops you're going to build that

1843
01:05:05,400 --> 01:05:11,319
soil Carlos coretto about a 40-year no

1844
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:13,839
down South America grain belongs to a

1845
01:05:11,319 --> 01:05:17,319
farmer residue belongs to the

1846
01:05:13,839 --> 01:05:18,680
soil I believe in that again quick

1847
01:05:17,319 --> 01:05:22,119
commercial for our crop production crop

1848
01:05:18,680 --> 01:05:24,799

1849
01:05:22,119 --> 01:05:26,559
