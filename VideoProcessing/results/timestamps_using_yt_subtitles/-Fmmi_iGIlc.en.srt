Backyard composting can sometimes be a challenge
– figuring out a spot that’s going to

2
00:00:10,531 --> 00:00:13,840
be warm enough, where you can access it with
water to keep it moist.

3
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,790
And then there’s also that challenge of
just keeping it corralled.

4
00:00:16,790 --> 00:00:20,970
If you’re looking for a quick and simple
option, you might consider building one out

5
00:00:20,970 --> 00:00:23,800
of 2x4’s and a little bit of wire mesh screen.

6
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,800
You can find these materials at local hardware
stores for a relatively low cost.

7
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,160
Generally speaking, we want a compost container
that is a minimum of three feet wide, by three

8
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:36,410
feet wide, by three feet tall.

9
00:00:36,410 --> 00:00:41,370
For the backyard compost container that we’re
building today, we’ll simply be using 2x4s

10
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:44,519
that we attach together, using a few 2”
screws.

11
00:00:44,519 --> 00:00:49,980
We’ll also then use some wire mesh screen
that we’ll attach with a few staples.

12
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:51,800
Build four sides.

13
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:54,660
Use hinges on each of the corners.

14
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:00,100
And then we can actually shut that container
and dump material in once it’s all been built.

15
00:01:00,149 --> 00:01:04,210
Now, we’ve selected the wire mesh because
that will actually help allow air movement

16
00:01:04,210 --> 00:01:05,940
into that compost pile.

17
00:01:05,940 --> 00:01:10,470
And then we went with the hinges so we can
actually open that container back up later,

18
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,440
and actually stir that material around when
needed.
