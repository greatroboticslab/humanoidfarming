00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:05,600
hi it's john um

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,759
i'm just planting some sweet corn uh

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:12,240
i bought several packets

4
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,240
and this is the one i gonna plant today

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:17,840
there we go it's uh

6
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,600
unwinds sweetcorn

7
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
super sweet f1 hybrid

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,400
on the pack here it says pack to your

9
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,320
ending

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,000
12 14

11
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,079
12

12
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,680
so it's all right it's in date

13
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:41,680
best before

14
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:42,840
2016. approximate seeds 35

15
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,920
well there was only

16
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:47,600
28. i mean that is bad

17
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:49,280
if i was selling stuff i would always

18
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,239
make sure there was more than what was

19
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
said

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:54,079
i think i i'm not sure i might contact

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,480
them to tell them there was only 28

22
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:56,480
seats

23
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,920
but one of the things i forgot to do

24
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,160
when you're in the shop and you're

25
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:05,040
buying a pack of seeds

26
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,799
and it says it's so just check

27
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:08,640
you can just check you can feel how many

28
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,760
there are and if it doesn't feel like

29
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:12,400
there's 28 in there or if have 35 in

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,159
there

31
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:15,600
don't buy it but i forgot to do that on

32
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:17,920
this one

33
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:17,920
um

34
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,320
whether they would send me another pack

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,799
i don't know

36
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,799
anyway got 28 i've got these containers

37
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
all fitted up with soil

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,000
it's just uh

39
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:33,119
i'm not quite sure what soil it is i

40
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,439
just found it outside um

41
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,520
i don't think you need very special soil

42
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,400
for sweet corn

43
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:40,640
um

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:41,439
just the warmth really

45
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:43,840
uh

46
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,880
i've got a pop

47
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:48,240
pot here to put any objects of stones

48
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,960
and things i find

49
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,960
so i've put one in each pot

50
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:53,960
um

51
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,320
uh and it says half an inch deep

52
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,479
um

53
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:05,439
so this has got twelve sets uh

54
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,520
just pop them in

55
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,759
and what they need they need warmth

56
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,360
so they need to be over

57
00:02:09,759 --> 00:02:12,640
60 degrees

58
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,360
to be um

59
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:15,360
to germinate

60
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,959
that's the main thing they need

61
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,800
and then of course they need to be out

62
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,440
in the best of the

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,440
summer weather

64
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,000
they need the sunshine as the kellogg's

65
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,400
corn flakes advert says they need 100

66
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:34,319
days of sunshine

67
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:37,840
well sometimes we get a nice lot of

68
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,840
sunshine and sometimes we don't

69
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:46,080
if you get a good year you can get lots

70
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:46,080
of sweetcorn

71
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:52,400
and any surplus will be very useful for

72
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:55,519
feeding the chickens so

73
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:57,920
that's my thinking

74
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,080
last year i grew

75
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,000
some sweet corn

76
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,519
and just some odd bits of maize that i

77
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:04,879
had about

78
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,640
but uh

79
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,800
i bought quite a lot of seeds this time

80
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:08,800
so

81
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,360
it all should all be sweet cornable you

82
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,319
know edible

83
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,360
because the maze can be a bit

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:18,800
bitter

85
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,440
or

86
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,440
not sweet

87
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:27,360
it's with sweet corn it says you've got

88
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:31,959
to plant plants about 15 inches apart

89
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:31,959
that's quite loud and uh

90
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:38,000
and plant them in a block so they're

91
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:41,760
fertilize one another

92
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:41,760
and it also says that you shouldn't

93
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,840
plant other sweet corn by it

94
00:03:54,879 --> 00:04:00,400
because you get cross pollination i

95
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,080
don't did that matter i don't know

96
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,400
anyway

97
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:07,840
i'd love to see i'm not quite sure

98
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,840
where about someone planted yet

99
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
but

100
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:15,239
it is a lovely thing to have in the

101
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,239
garden because

102
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:20,160
well if you just eat and eat it can't

103
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,160
you and children like it as well so on

104
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:26,040
these will like it

105
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:26,040
she stays with us

106
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:43,800
and um

107
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:43,800
yeah

108
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:49,520
if i do write to one wins about the one

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:52,000
being 28 seeds i can put a link in

110
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,120
to this video

111
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,400
um

112
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,400
i don't know whether that would prove

113
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,400
that there were only 28.

114
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,080
i'm not gonna just poke this one in

115
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:02,240
somewhere

116
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:02,240
but

117
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:06,960
that would

118
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:07,919
prove something do you think i mean am i

119
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,680
mean

120
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,919
i think it's a matter of principle i

121
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
mean last year i bought some other

122
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,080
animal seeds

123
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,520
and there was supposed to be about six

124
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,639
small net gourds in the packet

125
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:21,840
and

126
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:24,240
seeds

127
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:25,840
and there was only two

128
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,479
and uh

129
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,240
i didn't send two of them then i said to

130
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:32,479
then i bought another packet and there

131
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,240
was about 12 in there

132
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,039
i mean what it suggests to me is that

133
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:38,720
their workers just aren't interested in

134
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:40,160
getting the right amount of

135
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:43,199
seeds in the packet

136
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:45,039
which doesn't sound very good to me

137
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,280
anyway that's got them in there i've got

138
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:49,280
them in uh they're 12 minutes i've got

139
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,720
them in 24 so i may have doubled up to

140
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:53,520
see two couple

141
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:56,960
there we go just hope that they

142
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:59,039
grow i think i think within about

143
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,520
10 days they should be showing some

144
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,680
signs i think 10 days it definitely will

145
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:03,680
be

146
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:07,520
and i'll do an update then

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:14,639
unwinds sweetcorn and if i do send to

148
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,280
them i'll be able to tell you

149
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:21,240
what their response was

150
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,240
okay bye for now

151
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:42,160
you
