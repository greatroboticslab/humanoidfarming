1
00:00:07,590 --> 00:00:13,750
drone AG was founded in 2015 by farming

2
00:00:10,869 --> 00:00:15,549
brothers Jack and he ran using their own

3
00:00:13,750 --> 00:00:17,710
Farmers of research and development base

4
00:00:15,549 --> 00:00:19,029
they've supplied Agri specific drone

5
00:00:17,710 --> 00:00:20,890
packages and first of their kind

6
00:00:19,029 --> 00:00:24,939
specialist training courses to the

7
00:00:20,890 --> 00:00:26,679
agricultural industry now based on the

8
00:00:24,939 --> 00:00:28,869
experience and insight gained over the

9
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:30,579
previous years the brothers are moving

10
00:00:28,869 --> 00:00:32,410
into software with a clear mission to

11
00:00:30,579 --> 00:00:34,750
make farming more productive through

12
00:00:32,410 --> 00:00:38,200
practical hassle-free drone automation

13
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:39,940
and AI technology there is a growing

14
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:42,850
need to produce more food with less

15
00:00:39,940 --> 00:00:44,410
resources as farmers we need to increase

16
00:00:42,850 --> 00:00:46,240
yield and we need to do it while using

17
00:00:44,410 --> 00:00:48,220
less chemicals and be more efficient

18
00:00:46,240 --> 00:00:51,340
overall in order to remain sustainable

19
00:00:48,220 --> 00:00:52,960
and profitable as a business a drone AG

20
00:00:51,340 --> 00:00:54,520
we have used many different types of

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:56,650
software systems to control drones and

22
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:57,810
process the data learning what is useful

23
00:00:56,650 --> 00:01:00,010
in the farming setting and what isn't

24
00:00:57,810 --> 00:01:01,660
we've been very much focused on how we

25
00:01:00,010 --> 00:01:03,670
can help farmers use drone technology

26
00:01:01,660 --> 00:01:06,100
through that knowledge by our training

27
00:01:03,670 --> 00:01:07,359
courses and hardware know-how and we've

28
00:01:06,100 --> 00:01:08,890
also been looking at how we can build

29
00:01:07,359 --> 00:01:11,799
practical hassle-free drone technology

30
00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:13,299
ourselves the industry is at the start

31
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:15,969
of the next major agricultural

32
00:01:13,299 --> 00:01:17,770
revolution drones will form a large part

33
00:01:15,969 --> 00:01:19,420
of this revolution with drones and

34
00:01:17,770 --> 00:01:22,270
agriculture growing to four billion US

35
00:01:19,420 --> 00:01:24,280
dollars by 2020 for building on our

36
00:01:22,270 --> 00:01:26,380
years of experience we knew we needed a

37
00:01:24,280 --> 00:01:28,780
system that saves us time provides us

38
00:01:26,380 --> 00:01:30,520
data we can readily use we also wanted

39
00:01:28,780 --> 00:01:33,130
to lower the barriers of entry both in

40
00:01:30,520 --> 00:01:34,630
terms of cost and complexity so over the

41
00:01:33,130 --> 00:01:36,280
last year we've been using drone

42
00:01:34,630 --> 00:01:37,990
technology in a completely new way and

43
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,810
we've begun building our own software

44
00:01:37,990 --> 00:01:42,819
system based on those principles our

45
00:01:40,810 --> 00:01:44,380
Skippy Scout app is simple to use

46
00:01:42,819 --> 00:01:46,420
taking affordable off-the-shelf drones

47
00:01:44,380 --> 00:01:48,939
like this and automating them in the way

48
00:01:46,420 --> 00:01:50,469
never done before Skippy flies the drone

49
00:01:48,939 --> 00:01:52,030
around the field and at multiple points

50
00:01:50,469 --> 00:01:55,060
it descents to only a few meters above

51
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:56,409
the crop and takes a photo these images

52
00:01:55,060 --> 00:01:58,479
are collected from across the field much

53
00:01:56,409 --> 00:02:00,459
faster than possible on foot and in a

54
00:01:58,479 --> 00:02:02,150
much more detailed way possible with

55
00:02:00,459 --> 00:02:04,330
mapping or satellite technology

56
00:02:02,150 --> 00:02:07,430
and they can be viewed in near-real-time

57
00:02:04,330 --> 00:02:08,900
once images have been collected users

58
00:02:07,430 --> 00:02:11,900
will be able to view them in location I

59
00:02:08,900 --> 00:02:13,730
mean right into leak level and Rai can

60
00:02:11,900 --> 00:02:16,150
already identify crop cover verses we

61
00:02:13,730 --> 00:02:18,440
cover and even nutrient deficient leaves

62
00:02:16,150 --> 00:02:20,120
we plan to offer the software as a

63
00:02:18,440 --> 00:02:22,280
subscription-based service with two

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:24,350
primary tiers one aimed at farmers and

65
00:02:22,280 --> 00:02:25,550
the other agronomists the price point

66
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:28,730
will be a lot lower than current

67
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:30,440
software offerings as a farmer having

68
00:02:28,730 --> 00:02:32,390
this information straight away means I

69
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:34,640
can confidently assess pest weed and

70
00:02:32,390 --> 00:02:36,140
disease levels in the field and I can

71
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:37,730
make informed decisions to deal with

72
00:02:36,140 --> 00:02:39,230
them quickly and accurately which

73
00:02:37,730 --> 00:02:41,570
hopefully means less crop damage and

74
00:02:39,230 --> 00:02:43,130
better yields the accuracy and detail in

75
00:02:41,570 --> 00:02:44,900
the data also means that can

76
00:02:43,130 --> 00:02:47,120
specifically target the worst areas of

77
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,790
the crop which helps save on pesticides

78
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,470
and labor thanks to our expert developer

79
00:02:49,790 --> 00:02:53,750
with both experience in drone control

80
00:02:51,470 --> 00:02:55,250
systems and app development we have an

81
00:02:53,750 --> 00:02:57,050
early version of skippy Skerritt up and

82
00:02:55,250 --> 00:02:58,730
running now and the next stage is to

83
00:02:57,050 --> 00:03:00,890
implement the full user interface and

84
00:02:58,730 --> 00:03:03,920
integrate green area index measurements

85
00:03:00,890 --> 00:03:05,660
and we detection we plan to bring in

86
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,670
further expertise to allow us to develop

87
00:03:05,660 --> 00:03:10,180
our AI and recognize different types of

88
00:03:07,670 --> 00:03:12,440
disease weeds and crop growth stage

89
00:03:10,180 --> 00:03:16,690
people have been using drones in

90
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:20,270
different scenarios with little effect

91
00:03:16,690 --> 00:03:23,239
on a big scale the technologies been

92
00:03:20,270 --> 00:03:26,150
there to be able to map fields and look

93
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:28,220
at images but there's not been a simple

94
00:03:26,150 --> 00:03:31,310
way of putting it all together and

95
00:03:28,220 --> 00:03:33,739
basically aiding people's jobs in terms

96
00:03:31,310 --> 00:03:36,580
of the agronomist to actually do their

97
00:03:33,739 --> 00:03:39,140
job quicker I think in the past the

98
00:03:36,580 --> 00:03:41,600
software has been cumbersome and slow

99
00:03:39,140 --> 00:03:43,130
and in the end you've stopped using it

100
00:03:41,600 --> 00:03:43,280
because you haven't had the time to do

101
00:03:43,130 --> 00:03:46,000
it

102
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:48,110
whereas this Kippy Scout will mean that

103
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,850
you'll be quite easily get out of the

104
00:03:48,110 --> 00:03:52,420
card set the drone away and get the data

105
00:03:49,850 --> 00:03:52,420
quickly

106
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:58,840
new technology can provide solutions to

107
00:03:56,709 --> 00:04:00,609
the challenges ahead but for farmers to

108
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,370
adopt those solutions now they need to

109
00:04:00,609 --> 00:04:05,379
be simple and practical Skippy Scout

110
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:07,689
optimizes crop management in real time

111
00:04:05,379 --> 00:04:10,209
at leaf level all with just a phone in a

112
00:04:07,689 --> 00:04:12,069
drone and we plan to take this a lot

113
00:04:10,209 --> 00:04:13,480
further over the coming years using

114
00:04:12,069 --> 00:04:15,040
automated drone systems and AI to

115
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:17,199
optimize the whole crop management cycle

116
00:04:15,040 --> 00:04:18,820
from scouting and mapping through to

117
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:20,500
intelligent control of both manned and

118
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:23,520
automated farm machinery on the ground

119
00:04:20,500 --> 00:04:26,050
and even drone sprayers in the air

120
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,440
growing to over 30,000 users worldwide

121
00:04:26,050 --> 00:04:31,330
by 2025 we can help farming to become

122
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:34,680
more profitable and sustainable while

123
00:04:31,330 --> 00:04:34,680
benefiting the environment as a whole

124
00:04:37,740 --> 00:04:39,800
you
