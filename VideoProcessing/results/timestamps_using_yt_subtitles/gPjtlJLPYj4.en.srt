00:09:13,320 --> 00:09:22,120
I they implemented this famous sentence

192
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:25,560
healthy soil means healthy plants means

193
00:09:22,120 --> 00:09:29,079
healthy animals and healthy

194
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:31,800
man but then it took us some time and

195
00:09:29,079 --> 00:09:32,959
still takes our time to Define what is

196
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:35,800
health

197
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:38,000
really and we more and more come to the

198
00:09:35,800 --> 00:09:39,920
conclusion that is a

199
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,200
very

200
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,720
volatile very

201
00:09:42,200 --> 00:09:48,519
Dynamic

202
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:51,000
status um uh depending on the

203
00:09:48,519 --> 00:09:54,200
circumstances that change from second to

204
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:56,600
second from minute to minute so it is a

205
00:09:54,200 --> 00:10:00,680
balance we have to

206
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,920
achieve and soil fertility is

207
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:08,720
uh constant work to keep the balance on

208
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:11,200
a level in the soil in the soil plant

209
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:14,760
system that is

210
00:10:11,200 --> 00:10:18,279
providing fertility and health to the

211
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:22,200
entire ecosystem we are part of

212
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:24,959
it um and then I come to another

213
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:30,640
citation from Johan wolf gangur I'm

214
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:34,680
sorry I don't have uh citations from

215
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,320
um from American Authors

216
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:41,240
here but he says this is a translation

217
00:10:37,320 --> 00:10:43,040
of myself but that's not the good one

218
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:44,079
but the meaning is as long as you don't

219
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,800
have

220
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:50,240
understood uh the relationship or the

221
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:53,839
dynamic between death and creation death

222
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:56,959
and growth death and birth you're just a

223
00:10:53,839 --> 00:11:00,160
dull guest on the dark Earth and this is

224
00:10:56,959 --> 00:11:02,959
all about this is these big

225
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:07,480
microbiological microbio

226
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:09,880
micrum Dynamic we are living in we have

227
00:11:07,480 --> 00:11:12,800
been developing out in our

228
00:11:09,880 --> 00:11:16,639
Evolution that we have to understand

229
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:20,000
steeper and steeper how we are connected

230
00:11:16,639 --> 00:11:25,000
and what is is all about is what we see

231
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:29,000
here it is the Garden it is the paradise

232
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:30,320
that feeds us and it feeds us because

233
00:11:29,000 --> 00:11:33,440
there is a

234
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:37,440
miracle there's a miracle that's deep

235
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:40,240
under our feet there are the rocks and

236
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,440
what is the main property in relation to

237
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:45,959
what we see as a green entity on the

238
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:50,519
top it is

239
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:54,519
dead it doesn't create on its own what

240
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:57,839
we call Life what we call development

241
00:11:54,519 --> 00:12:01,720
due to the laws which are you know

242
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:05,959
introduced into the sub substance

243
00:12:01,720 --> 00:12:09,440
itself and how does it come that such a

244
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:12,320
you know plant on the top I didn't bring

245
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:16,279
my carrot from the garden now how does

246
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:19,000
it come that on on the mineral ground of

247
00:12:16,279 --> 00:12:21,959
our Earth such a

248
00:12:19,000 --> 00:12:26,839
beautiful uh Empire of

249
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:31,600
plants that's is nourishing us can

250
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:35,519
evolve how does it work so there must be

251
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:39,839
something that is transforming the dead

252
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:43,199
Rock the scent the desert into something

253
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:45,000
which is very close to life and this

254
00:12:43,199 --> 00:12:49,680
miracle is

255
00:12:45,000 --> 00:12:50,639
mainly can be named by a key word and

256
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:52,880
this is

257
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,440
symbiosis and this is a symbiosis

258
00:12:52,880 --> 00:13:00,079
between the plant and the mineral

259
00:12:56,440 --> 00:13:01,959
Empire below the soil

260
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,160
and that is what is in between and that

261
00:13:01,959 --> 00:13:06,560
is soil and this is a habitat for the

262
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:09,199
microbiome the soil

263
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:11,440
microbiome symbiosis is

264
00:13:09,199 --> 00:13:15,040
everything and the plant with the plant

265
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:15,959
exudates nourishes the microbiome in the

266
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:18,079
root

267
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:23,320
sphere

268
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:26,440
by you know giving the assimilates the

269
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:30,800
phytosynthesis products directly into

270
00:13:26,440 --> 00:13:33,920
the soil to feed the the symbiotic

271
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,199
microorganisms in their environment in

272
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:38,360
order to get them as part of their organ

273
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,199
of the plant

274
00:13:38,360 --> 00:13:44,480
organ as we can name the soil as an

275
00:13:42,199 --> 00:13:47,720
organ of the

276
00:13:44,480 --> 00:13:50,560
plant to deliver the minerals and the

277
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:54,880
mineral compounds to nourish again the

278
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:59,800
plant it's a big you know Wonder Miracle

279
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:03,160
of symbiosis and interaction As We Know

280
00:13:59,800 --> 00:14:04,240
master of symbiosis just symbolizing

281
00:14:03,160 --> 00:14:07,800
this

282
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:12,399
picture and I say this

283
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,600
only because this fungal and bacterial

284
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:15,320
life in

285
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:20,000
soil

286
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:22,959
boosts life on Earth tremendously yeah

287
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:25,240
plants May absorb just as one example 16

288
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:27,759
times more water and nutrients with the

289
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:30,560
help of the fungal weap in the soil full

290
00:14:27,759 --> 00:14:34,160
stop it's just one small indication

291
00:14:30,560 --> 00:14:37,320
there's much more to say about what has

292
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:40,720
been found up out in the recent

293
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:43,320
years and the key is that this habitat

294
00:14:40,720 --> 00:14:46,560
this environment of the plant is this

295
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:50,399
clay humus complex and

296
00:14:46,560 --> 00:14:52,279
now the I come to the agricultural

297
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:53,360
composting or the corporation of the on

298
00:14:52,279 --> 00:14:58,040
Farm

299
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:59,560
composting that this processes in the

300
00:14:58,040 --> 00:15:05,040
soil

301
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:08,560
and the idea the ideas behind creating

302
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:14,519
maintaining building up enhancing soil

303
00:15:08,560 --> 00:15:17,040
fertility must be understood by heart

304
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,320
intimately by the farmers who are

305
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,279
responsible for the soil for their

306
00:15:19,320 --> 00:15:24,240
grandchildren this is all they have to

307
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:28,199
do soil is a common is not private

308
00:15:24,240 --> 00:15:31,560
property no square meter no square yard

309
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:34,759
of soil belong to anybody it belongs to

310
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:38,920
everybody in order to preserve life on

311
00:15:34,759 --> 00:15:41,639
Earth it's a very simple attitude and

312
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:46,199
what we are have to take care about is

313
00:15:41,639 --> 00:15:46,199
this humification dynamic in the

314
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:51,440
soil this is one

315
00:15:48,600 --> 00:15:55,000
example from a long-term experiment in

316
00:15:51,440 --> 00:15:56,199
Europe showing that aggregate stability

317
00:15:55,000 --> 00:16:02,040
by

318
00:15:56,199 --> 00:16:04,920
using composted manure over 21 years

319
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:07,880
increases the aggregate stability

320
00:16:04,920 --> 00:16:10,319
against you know conventional soil

321
00:16:07,880 --> 00:16:12,600
management

322
00:16:10,319 --> 00:16:13,519
tremendously and there's also one thing

323
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,160
one

324
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,600
motivation I want to

325
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:23,480
mention they have found out that we have

326
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:26,920
to eat 24 apples to

327
00:16:23,480 --> 00:16:30,519
to uh receive the same

328
00:16:26,920 --> 00:16:34,000
amount for instance

329
00:16:30,519 --> 00:16:34,000
of uh

330
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:41,720
iron um compared to

331
00:16:38,920 --> 00:16:44,639
1914 where it was only necessary for the

332
00:16:41,720 --> 00:16:47,160
same amount to eat one e so something

333
00:16:44,639 --> 00:16:51,880
went wrong in terms of

334
00:16:47,160 --> 00:16:53,560
degradation of the quality of food so

335
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:57,360
whus

336
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:01,000
management so fertility management is a

337
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:04,360
matter of food safety and therefore what

338
00:17:01,000 --> 00:17:07,480
we need is education education

339
00:17:04,360 --> 00:17:11,000
education and it is education to from

340
00:17:07,480 --> 00:17:14,240
the gardeners who are responsible for

341
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:17,959
you know self-reliant Gardens and food

342
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,400
provision for the families and the

343
00:17:17,959 --> 00:17:24,439
communities learning all about the

344
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:26,799
different processes from Bashi biochar

345
00:17:24,439 --> 00:17:30,760
composting and the composting process

346
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:32,960
itself all possibility of variations

347
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:35,320
which are part of our

348
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:39,240
natural

349
00:17:35,320 --> 00:17:42,120
bio I would say bios symbiosis in our

350
00:17:39,240 --> 00:17:44,640
environment and with Farmers because the

351
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:46,919
farmers are the professionals here and

352
00:17:44,640 --> 00:17:48,919
the concept in Austria was from the very

353
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:51,400
beginning in all

354
00:17:48,919 --> 00:17:55,440
provinces in

355
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:58,440
1980s every village is composting farmer

356
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,720
in order to close the organic cycle

357
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:03,480
Village by Village City by city but

358
00:18:01,720 --> 00:18:05,600
therefore the farmers have to be

359
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:09,679
motivated have to

360
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:12,280
understand the maintenance and how to

361
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:15,679
take care about the organic fertility of

362
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:19,840
their of their soil with the help of

363
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:22,120
compost of the Recycled organic metal

364
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:25,240
they have to understand what can go

365
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:27,000
wrong in terms of drying out and the

366
00:18:25,240 --> 00:18:28,600
composting process they have to

367
00:18:27,000 --> 00:18:32,320
understand what kind of materials they

368
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:35,039
have how to mix it in the right way to

369
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,799
understand that humus formation on soil

370
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:40,080
and in the natural environment in the

371
00:18:36,799 --> 00:18:43,200
Savana in the woods uh on aable end is

372
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:46,760
not the same as in a composting heat it

373
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,919
is an imitation of this process but it

374
00:18:46,760 --> 00:18:52,280
is not the same they have to learn

375
00:18:48,919 --> 00:18:55,480
exactly what time of Shredder material

376
00:18:52,280 --> 00:18:58,159
they need and depending on the type of

377
00:18:55,480 --> 00:19:01,039
body material they have available the

378
00:18:58,159 --> 00:19:04,320
machines have to develop in a way that

379
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:07,440
the structure the size the particle size

380
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:10,400
and the threading properties are perfect

381
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:14,760
for composting specifically to create

382
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:18,120
the right surfaces for the

383
00:19:14,760 --> 00:19:21,919
microbiota so training training

384
00:19:18,120 --> 00:19:24,799
training uh and to get specifically the

385
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:27,320
hands on and I show you only those

386
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:29,720
figures what we in Austria in these

387
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:33,000
training programs

388
00:19:29,720 --> 00:19:35,840
um we have approximately 280 Farmers

389
00:19:33,000 --> 00:19:38,400
running composting plants out of 400

390
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:39,880
composting plants in total I will show

391
00:19:38,400 --> 00:19:42,919
you the figures

392
00:19:39,880 --> 00:19:45,960
later we tell them something which is

393
00:19:42,919 --> 00:19:49,120
very important and this is a

394
00:19:45,960 --> 00:19:51,400
teaching from my experience since since

395
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,480
the 1980 this is key what I've

396
00:19:51,400 --> 00:19:58,039
understood of soil formation there is no

397
00:19:54,480 --> 00:20:02,799
stable humus formation without clay in a

398
00:19:58,039 --> 00:20:06,200
pure silicate Sandy situation sand

399
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:09,200
desert situation without clay formation

400
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:11,320
you will never achieve a stable humus

401
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:16,480
layer never

402
00:20:11,320 --> 00:20:19,120
ever so you need clay compounds during

403
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,000
the composting process to stabilize the

404
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:25,400
clay humus complexes you

405
00:20:22,000 --> 00:20:27,960
produce and then we train them even a

406
00:20:25,400 --> 00:20:32,440
little bit about indicators they can

407
00:20:27,960 --> 00:20:36,120
easily test on Farm in order to have an

408
00:20:32,440 --> 00:20:40,960
idea not only by organoleptic

409
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:45,600
observation but also by some very simple

410
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:48,960
tests on the nitrogen cycle on pH on

411
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:53,600
sulfate Etc and also Crest test I will

412
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:56,360
show you later in order to see uh the

413
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:59,159
stage of maturation that is very

414
00:20:56,360 --> 00:21:00,720
important to achieve a compost

415
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,760
that

416
00:21:00,720 --> 00:21:05,039
contributes best possible to humus build

417
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,360
up in the

418
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:10,919
soil so this is Crest test that is done

419
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:15,159
or with other plants also that is done

420
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:18,440
routinely with the farmers and also this

421
00:21:15,159 --> 00:21:22,760
dilution test with just with distilled

422
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:26,520
water where you can see from the density

423
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:29,000
from um the transparency and also from

424
00:21:26,520 --> 00:21:30,760
the colors the maturity of your compost

425
00:21:29,000 --> 00:21:32,880
and the performance of your composting

426
00:21:30,760 --> 00:21:36,320
facility it's just a little bit of

427
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,520
training for a proper

428
00:21:36,320 --> 00:21:40,520
interpretation and then at the very end

429
00:21:38,520 --> 00:21:45,400
what you see here on the

430
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:49,000
top I can show you here I guess this

431
00:21:45,400 --> 00:21:54,279
is the right one uh uh what you see on

432
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:57,760
the top here is the uh composta and the

433
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:59,279
quality seal the quality certification

434
00:21:57,760 --> 00:22:03,799
for composting

435
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:06,080
plans um and the some minimum uh

436
00:22:03,799 --> 00:22:11,799
criteria they have to achieve in order

437
00:22:06,080 --> 00:22:11,799
to participate uh to be awarded for the

438
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:18,159
certification and what is sorry sorry

439
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:20,760
sorry sorry sorry now it's going on now

440
00:22:18,159 --> 00:22:23,039
I come to collection what is very

441
00:22:20,760 --> 00:22:24,880
important if you receive not only green

442
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:27,520
waste and manure from the environment

443
00:22:24,880 --> 00:22:30,039
but also kitchen waste and you know from

444
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,000
households and from restaurants is the

445
00:22:30,039 --> 00:22:36,200
issue of impurities big problems in

446
00:22:33,000 --> 00:22:38,919
cities but it very much depends on the

447
00:22:36,200 --> 00:22:41,120
collection scheme so in the best

448
00:22:38,919 --> 00:22:43,840
performing on Farm

449
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:46,720
composting corporations where also the

450
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:48,080
farmers do the collection service for

451
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:51,679
the

452
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:55,039
municipalities they achieve a purity or

453
00:22:51,679 --> 00:22:57,720
a contamination of only

454
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,159
1.2% if they do it in a way I will show

455
00:22:57,720 --> 00:23:01,279
you in a minute

456
00:22:59,159 --> 00:23:03,679
and this success story where you have

457
00:23:01,279 --> 00:23:06,559
nearly nothing left because you have

458
00:23:03,679 --> 00:23:09,640
educated household by household in the

459
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:12,880
schools in the households in the

460
00:23:09,640 --> 00:23:16,159
commercial entities Etc providing the

461
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:18,880
right equipment you achieve very very

462
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:22,720
high Purity because what you see here is

463
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:25,799
a big problem if you screen it you will

464
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:29,200
have impurities and your compost Market

465
00:23:25,799 --> 00:23:33,279
might be destroyed at once

466
00:23:29,200 --> 00:23:36,919
so all of our citizens receed these

467
00:23:33,279 --> 00:23:40,400
little vented buckets Ramon will tell

468
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:42,480
you maybe about this also later this is

469
00:23:40,400 --> 00:23:45,520
standard in well

470
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:46,880
performing uh circumstances situations

471
00:23:45,520 --> 00:23:50,520
all over

472
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:52,600
Europe paper bags biodegradable bags

473
00:23:50,520 --> 00:23:56,120
which are certified by European

474
00:23:52,600 --> 00:23:59,640
standards for garden waste the bigger

475
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:02,840
paperbacks um where you can put uh the

476
00:23:59,640 --> 00:24:04,640
grass and and clippings and some leaves

477
00:24:02,840 --> 00:24:07,520
Etc and

478
00:24:04,640 --> 00:24:10,919
flowers and it is collected by farmers

479
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:13,960
in the rural environment in this way for

480
00:24:10,919 --> 00:24:16,120
instance uh depending on the size of the

481
00:24:13,960 --> 00:24:19,320
household the buckets are bigger or

482
00:24:16,120 --> 00:24:23,279
smaller but every bucket bucket has a

483
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:25,600
name and is identified even the

484
00:24:23,279 --> 00:24:28,880
biodegradable BS in some areas are

485
00:24:25,600 --> 00:24:31,960
identified with a number so if there are

486
00:24:28,880 --> 00:24:34,399
a lot of impurities Plastics and some

487
00:24:31,960 --> 00:24:37,960
forks and metals and so included not

488
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:41,039
well separated they can identify the

489
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:42,720
household and contact him and tell him

490
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:48,200
you're not committed in the way we need

491
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:49,440
it you're part of our society and please

492
00:24:48,200 --> 00:24:53,320
take

493
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:56,480
care with bigger facilities with pickup

494
00:24:53,320 --> 00:25:00,000
systems um hydraulic systems so

495
00:24:56,480 --> 00:25:01,640
depending on the size and uh the

496
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:04,559
catchment

497
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:10,039
area collection system is different here

498
00:25:04,559 --> 00:25:13,120
we have a example of a city of grats

499
00:25:10,039 --> 00:25:15,880
with more than 300,000 inhabitants and

500
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:19,000
they decided to do a centralized

501
00:25:15,880 --> 00:25:21,840
collection prepare and purify the

502
00:25:19,000 --> 00:25:24,679
collected biow waste kitchen waste and

503
00:25:21,840 --> 00:25:27,360
garden waste in a central treatment

504
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:30,360
facility put it on a truck and send it

505
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:32,200
to 18 different different compost

506
00:25:30,360 --> 00:25:36,279
agricultural composting plants to

507
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:41,200
farmers in the environment U maximum 80

508
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:43,679
kilm in average 30 kilm 10 to 30 kilm in

509
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:47,919
the vicinity in the environment of the

510
00:25:43,679 --> 00:25:51,120
city so there is no Central bit uh

511
00:25:47,919 --> 00:25:56,520
composting plant but 18 onine composting

512
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:59,760
plants and when the compost is tested

513
00:25:56,520 --> 00:26:02,399
for the standard quity criteria like

514
00:25:59,760 --> 00:26:04,320
heavy metals Etc and everything is okay

515
00:26:02,399 --> 00:26:08,399
the farmer takes over the compost for

516
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:11,799
his own use or he can also sell the

517
00:26:08,399 --> 00:26:14,720
compost to whomever he likes so it is a

518
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:18,039
win-win situation for the city for the

519
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,039
municipality and for the

520
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:24,039
farmer yes this is the typical uh Garden

521
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:28,399
waste collection and then we have

522
00:26:24,039 --> 00:26:30,320
collection points not uh the distance

523
00:26:28,399 --> 00:26:32,320
between the settlements and these

524
00:26:30,320 --> 00:26:36,799
collection points should not be more

525
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:39,360
than 5 kilm so and in a mostly connected

526
00:26:36,799 --> 00:26:43,120
with a recycling center this a public

527
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:45,640
imunity site where people pass by

528
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:48,679
frequently uh easy to access with a

529
00:26:45,640 --> 00:26:51,799
separation of fine and bulky Garden

530
00:26:48,679 --> 00:26:54,919
waste so that bulky Garden waste can be

531
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:59,840
shreded and it's mostly uh can be

532
00:26:54,919 --> 00:27:01,480
delivered for free so the system yeah

533
00:26:59,840 --> 00:27:04,919
and now I show you typical composting

534
00:27:01,480 --> 00:27:07,440
plants on Farm composting plants from

535
00:27:04,919 --> 00:27:12,159
very small

536
00:27:07,440 --> 00:27:14,919
um uh one wind row alongside uh the

537
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:17,039
field alongside the road in the

538
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:19,159
countryside where he goes with the wind

539
00:27:17,039 --> 00:27:22,039
roll Turner alongside the little road

540
00:27:19,159 --> 00:27:25,240
here on the upper left

541
00:27:22,039 --> 00:27:29,080
side uh it is composting between 300 and

542
00:27:25,240 --> 00:27:33,360
10,000 cubic met depending on the mment

543
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:37,600
area and the municipality involved

544
00:27:33,360 --> 00:27:41,399
um most of the facilities yeah can have

545
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:44,679
to be built on a paved area I will show

546
00:27:41,399 --> 00:27:48,399
you later uh details on on

547
00:27:44,679 --> 00:27:50,279
this uh exactly this is an overview of a

548
00:27:48,399 --> 00:27:52,919
design of a composting

549
00:27:50,279 --> 00:27:56,039
plant where you have H rotter there this

550
00:27:52,919 --> 00:27:58,480
is the main rotting area on the top this

551
00:27:56,039 --> 00:28:01,240
is sealed this is paved the surface B

552
00:27:58,480 --> 00:28:04,799
water is collected into the Wastewater

553
00:28:01,240 --> 00:28:07,840
retention tank that is to be calculated

554
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:09,360
according to the participation and the

555
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:14,159
rainfall

556
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:17,039
seasons in agreement with uh the um

557
00:28:14,159 --> 00:28:18,840
local authorities and the experts from

558
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,240
the licensing

559
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:25,760
bodies and all facilities must be

560
00:28:22,240 --> 00:28:28,760
licensed as any even commercial waste

561
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:30,279
treatment facility under

562
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:32,960
the

563
00:28:30,279 --> 00:28:35,480
specific regulations and guidelines

564
00:28:32,960 --> 00:28:37,519
National guidelines for composting in

565
00:28:35,480 --> 00:28:39,640
Austria though there is no difference if

566
00:28:37,519 --> 00:28:42,519
you're a farmer or a commercial entity

567
00:28:39,640 --> 00:28:46,080
or industrial Farm you have to follow

568
00:28:42,519 --> 00:28:49,320
the same rules in terms of Environmental

569
00:28:46,080 --> 00:28:51,840
Protection and then the open the the the

570
00:28:49,320 --> 00:28:54,120
post roting or the maturation can be

571
00:28:51,840 --> 00:28:58,960
done on open ground there is no need for

572
00:28:54,120 --> 00:29:01,559
cealing and the definition for uh uh the

573
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:04,840
maturation phase is that the compost

574
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:09,120
must um achieve or maintain a

575
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:11,279
temperature below 40 to 45 degre Celsius

576
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,640
on a constant level and then you can put

577
00:29:11,279 --> 00:29:18,399
it on the open ground or even beside

578
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:21,120
your acre or your field where you uh

579
00:29:18,399 --> 00:29:23,679
finish your composting for the final

580
00:29:21,120 --> 00:29:23,679
period in

581
00:29:24,519 --> 00:29:29,080
met so this is also what those Farms

582
00:29:28,159 --> 00:29:32,080
look

583
00:29:29,080 --> 00:29:32,080
like

584
00:29:32,440 --> 00:29:38,159
typically yeah Wastewater collection

585
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,159
with those little

586
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:41,159
gullies

587
00:29:41,279 --> 00:29:47,760
uh uh yeah

588
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:51,399
and I I uh swiftly give an overview what

589
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:53,880
is needed in terms of um regulatory

590
00:29:51,399 --> 00:29:57,039
framework in order to establish even

591
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:59,679
this decentralized on Farm

592
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:02,320
Corporation first of all in order to

593
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,760
make the entire system of separate

594
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:07,600
collection and composting successful you

595
00:30:04,760 --> 00:30:09,519
need an obligation of binding targets

596
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:12,000
for sour

597
00:30:09,519 --> 00:30:14,960
separation uh this has been established

598
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:17,919
already in the early 90s in Austria and

599
00:30:14,960 --> 00:30:20,840
then it starts the education how this

600
00:30:17,919 --> 00:30:23,080
must be done in order to achieve uh at

601
00:30:20,840 --> 00:30:26,399
the end a high quality compost so high

602
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:30,159
quality feed stock means high quality

603
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,399
compost uh in order to give time and

604
00:30:30,159 --> 00:30:33,760
skills and knowledge to set up the right

605
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,360
collection

606
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:40,200
scheme um in in parallel we have a ban

607
00:30:37,360 --> 00:30:43,120
on biodegradables of landfills so that

608
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:45,440
all so separated Organics are directed

609
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,679
towards biological

610
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:53,080
treatment and then it is important to

611
00:30:48,679 --> 00:30:56,639
give compost a name a name as a product

612
00:30:53,080 --> 00:31:00,039
that means in Austria we were the first

613
00:30:56,639 --> 00:31:02,360
country or EU member states establishing

614
00:31:00,039 --> 00:31:06,279
a so-called endof waste quality

615
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:11,559
standards within a decree within an

616
00:31:06,279 --> 00:31:16,080
ordinance that defines the eligable feed

617
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:18,159
stock feed stock quality plus minimum

618
00:31:16,080 --> 00:31:20,600
requirements for you know time

619
00:31:18,159 --> 00:31:23,000
temperature regime hygienization

620
00:31:20,600 --> 00:31:28,760
sanitization plus the definition of

621
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:33,519
quality criteria for compost two c

622
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:36,159
the waste status to become a compost

623
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:37,279
product to be freely marketed and put on

624
00:31:36,159 --> 00:31:39,639
the

625
00:31:37,279 --> 00:31:42,760
marketplace and therefore this was an

626
00:31:39,639 --> 00:31:45,200
enormous achievement to say this is a

627
00:31:42,760 --> 00:31:47,960
product as a fertilizer as a soil

628
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:50,440
improver as a constituent for growing

629
00:31:47,960 --> 00:31:54,720
media that can compete with all other

630
00:31:50,440 --> 00:31:57,039
fertilizers growing media and and soil

631
00:31:54,720 --> 00:31:59,480
improver uh the next one is we need

632
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,799
technicals standards common technical

633
00:31:59,480 --> 00:32:03,919
standards for

634
00:32:00,799 --> 00:32:06,720
design and for operation of composting

635
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:11,399
plants that's very important not to be

636
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:13,320
too strict and not to overrule with too

637
00:32:11,399 --> 00:32:16,639
you know

638
00:32:13,320 --> 00:32:18,919
scary and and strict and stringent

639
00:32:16,639 --> 00:32:20,840
requirements regarding environmental

640
00:32:18,919 --> 00:32:23,559
requirements we can discuss this perhaps

641
00:32:20,840 --> 00:32:26,360
later what I mean with this this is

642
00:32:23,559 --> 00:32:28,880
about order control this is about water

643
00:32:26,360 --> 00:32:32,760
protection Etc

644
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:35,639
um where if you if you make a good job

645
00:32:32,760 --> 00:32:37,279
you can be quite relaxed with a

646
00:32:35,639 --> 00:32:40,399
composting

647
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,639
activities um economic drivers

648
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:47,480
incentives this is mainly an

649
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:49,519
issue uh to make separate collection

650
00:32:47,480 --> 00:32:51,799
give incentive for separate collection

651
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:54,080
and make residual waste expensive but

652
00:32:51,799 --> 00:32:55,880
this is not so much our topic

653
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:59,440
here

654
00:32:55,880 --> 00:33:02,120
um and also of course to maybe give some

655
00:32:59,440 --> 00:33:04,960
support which was done in the in the

656
00:33:02,120 --> 00:33:07,120
beginning and now by the EU for

657
00:33:04,960 --> 00:33:11,039
establishing the centralized on Farm

658
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:13,559
composting systems where provinces and

659
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:17,840
also national government and

660
00:33:13,559 --> 00:33:20,880
municipalities gave uh subsidies for the

661
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:22,519
investment up to 50% for the investment

662
00:33:20,880 --> 00:33:24,279
for building and construction of the

663
00:33:22,519 --> 00:33:26,880
composting

664
00:33:24,279 --> 00:33:29,159
plants uh and finally the quality

665
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:32,159
assurance and ification scheme we have

666
00:33:29,159 --> 00:33:35,039
established since very

667
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:38,519
beginning here uh the

668
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:38,519
developments from the

669
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:46,120
1990s to today and you will wonder uh in

670
00:33:42,960 --> 00:33:47,559
in 1992 these obligation for separate

671
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:50,240
collection of organic waste was

672
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:52,760
established from that on the

673
00:33:50,240 --> 00:33:55,440
municipalities and waste management

674
00:33:52,760 --> 00:33:58,360
association started the initiatives so

675
00:33:55,440 --> 00:34:00,159
there's a big increase in the next

676
00:33:58,360 --> 00:34:02,559
uh three to four years and then

677
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:06,799
constantly more and more

678
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:09,560
was produced uh in terms of of quantity

679
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:12,399
of bowte collected and you see a miracle

680
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:17,520
in from 2017 to

681
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:18,839
2019 this is because uh we established a

682
00:34:17,520 --> 00:34:23,000
uh

683
00:34:18,839 --> 00:34:25,919
national uh um regulation for Waste

684
00:34:23,000 --> 00:34:28,079
reporting for electronic data management

685
00:34:25,919 --> 00:34:29,119
in waste reporting now we have really

686
00:34:28,079 --> 00:34:32,440
good

687
00:34:29,119 --> 00:34:35,079
data the data the the the really the

688
00:34:32,440 --> 00:34:39,440
reality of separate collection

689
00:34:35,079 --> 00:34:43,359
specifically of um of greenbase Etc

690
00:34:39,440 --> 00:34:44,280
chumped into the statistics so from 2017

691
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:47,520
to

692
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,119
2019 it it's went up from approximately

693
00:34:47,520 --> 00:34:53,480
1 million to 1.6 million tons we are

694
00:34:51,119 --> 00:34:56,440
collecting uh I didn't mention that we

695
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:58,680
have approximately 8 million inhabitants

696
00:34:56,440 --> 00:35:00,760
in Austria so that you have that

697
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:05,119
relation at the

698
00:35:00,760 --> 00:35:09,040
moment and you can uh achieve a picture

699
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:12,119
of our decentralized system that we have

700
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:16,000
for these 8 million uh residents or

701
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:19,040
inhabitants 400 composting plants um

702
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:21,480
that means the average um treating

703
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,480
approximately 1.3 million

704
00:35:21,480 --> 00:35:29,040
tons uh and including some sewage LGE

705
00:35:25,480 --> 00:35:31,800
here and this is in total 14 5 kilg per

706
00:35:29,040 --> 00:35:36,119
inhabitant that is

707
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:38,240
fact yeah composted that's a very high

708
00:35:36,119 --> 00:35:42,280
number

709
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:44,880
actually and uh nearly 70% are members

710
00:35:42,280 --> 00:35:48,079
in the quality assurance scheme and now

711
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:50,359
is something very important that our um

712
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:53,960
the Novation the new

713
00:35:50,359 --> 00:35:56,839
composting um ordinance that will be

714
00:35:53,960 --> 00:36:00,000
enacted next year will make the quality

715
00:35:56,839 --> 00:36:02,839
assurance and certification scheme

716
00:36:00,000 --> 00:36:07,440
including intensive education and

717
00:36:02,839 --> 00:36:09,960
certification obligatory so the 70% from

718
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:13,599
next year or in two years time there be

719
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:16,079
100% so those composting facilities all

720
00:36:13,599 --> 00:36:18,480
Farms will be visited every year by an

721
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:20,760
inspector and by this they receive

722
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:24,079
training and Improvement year by year

723
00:36:20,760 --> 00:36:26,400
year by year and uh this is a very

724
00:36:24,079 --> 00:36:28,200
important tool to integrate this

725
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:31,720
intensive communication

726
00:36:28,200 --> 00:36:33,200
controlling and inspection work and it

727
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:35,040
creates also

728
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:38,720
confidence

729
00:36:35,040 --> 00:36:41,200
among uh among the society among the

730
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:44,119
authorities uh but also for the

731
00:36:41,200 --> 00:36:47,800
population and you see our small scale

732
00:36:44,119 --> 00:36:51,680
composting plants in average we have uh

733
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:55,440
here 3,000 tons per per

734
00:36:51,680 --> 00:36:58,560
plant uh in the top of Austria or in the

735
00:36:55,440 --> 00:37:01,160
center of Austria there's one province

736
00:36:58,560 --> 00:37:03,319
uh they established approximately 160

737
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:07,240
composting plants for 1.4 million

738
00:37:03,319 --> 00:37:09,720
inhabitants in a very rural area so

739
00:37:07,240 --> 00:37:12,800
there it has been realized what I

740
00:37:09,720 --> 00:37:16,400
mentioned before every city every

741
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:18,040
village every town one or two farmers

742
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,560
yeah doing the job of separate

743
00:37:18,040 --> 00:37:23,440
collection on

744
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:27,880
composting this is the most

745
00:37:23,440 --> 00:37:31,800
transparent uh and uh way to do it

746
00:37:27,880 --> 00:37:34,119
because every citizen knows exactly

747
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:36,400
where the compost is produced the

748
00:37:34,119 --> 00:37:38,880
quality and where he received his

749
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:41,880
compost for his garden

750
00:37:38,880 --> 00:37:45,160
again but the participation in separate

751
00:37:41,880 --> 00:37:47,839
collection depends very much first on

752
00:37:45,160 --> 00:37:52,240
Public Relation work on the roll out

753
00:37:47,839 --> 00:37:54,760
system of the bioin of the brown bin but

754
00:37:52,240 --> 00:37:57,520
also on of course the settlement

755
00:37:54,760 --> 00:38:00,040
structure more rural so we have

756
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:02,400
different Pro if it's more rural or more

757
00:38:00,040 --> 00:38:05,000
urban areas so we have quite a

758
00:38:02,400 --> 00:38:07,920
difference between different provinces

759
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:11,680
but one of the provinces uh the far

760
00:38:07,920 --> 00:38:14,720
right one with 10% participation in fact

761
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,319
is the province that we would say is a

762
00:38:14,720 --> 00:38:18,720
white spot in Austria so I have still a

763
00:38:17,319 --> 00:38:22,359
lot to do

764
00:38:18,720 --> 00:38:24,480
there you see the same it is Corinthia

765
00:38:22,359 --> 00:38:27,560
this is the quantity in the specific

766
00:38:24,480 --> 00:38:30,119
quantity Collective here in 2017

767
00:38:27,560 --> 00:38:34,880
kilogram per inhabitant and year and you

768
00:38:30,119 --> 00:38:37,240
see uh kinia here the the second left

769
00:38:34,880 --> 00:38:39,680
only 50 kilg per

770
00:38:37,240 --> 00:38:43,280
inhabitant uh if you compare it with

771
00:38:39,680 --> 00:38:45,800
others up to 117 some other provinces

772
00:38:43,280 --> 00:38:49,000
but in some districts the quantity goes

773
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:53,400
up to 200 300 kilogram per inhabitant

774
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:56,440
there's a huge potential still available

775
00:38:53,400 --> 00:38:59,800
in spite we have started in the late

776
00:38:56,440 --> 00:39:02,680
80s and what is now very important is

777
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:05,079
again coming back to education or to

778
00:39:02,680 --> 00:39:08,920
minimum

779
00:39:05,079 --> 00:39:13,760
requirements is that uh there is a

780
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:18,040
strict rule that if you have to mix in a

781
00:39:13,760 --> 00:39:22,240
certain amount of bulky

782
00:39:18,040 --> 00:39:27,640
shredded wood waste into kitchen waso

783
00:39:22,240 --> 00:39:30,760
into sewage sledge so this is um a very

784
00:39:27,640 --> 00:39:34,480
you know a a an element of quality

785
00:39:30,760 --> 00:39:37,440
assurance that has been put up first as

786
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,680
a guideline and in due time next year it

787
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:41,720
will be an obligation for the license

788
00:39:40,680 --> 00:39:43,480
and you

789
00:39:41,720 --> 00:39:46,280
prevent uh

790
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:48,599
mismanagement all the problems and

791
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:51,760
failures on composting plant if you

792
00:39:48,599 --> 00:39:54,160
strictly require a certain minimum

793
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:57,520
requirement for the initial mix of the

794
00:39:54,160 --> 00:40:00,839
feed stock that you have enough carbon

795
00:39:57,520 --> 00:40:03,520
Rich material and this becomes important

796
00:40:00,839 --> 00:40:06,359
also in terms of understanding the

797
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:08,920
composting process from the very

798
00:40:06,359 --> 00:40:12,119
beginning uh identifying the right

799
00:40:08,920 --> 00:40:14,280
composition of each stock and another

800
00:40:12,119 --> 00:40:16,800
issue that we have a minimum requirement

801
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:18,400
because all our facilities or most of

802
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,480
them yeah

803
00:40:18,400 --> 00:40:25,599
95% of our facilities are open wial uh

804
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:29,839
composting plants that we want to

805
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:31,160
prevent these you know 4 meter high uh

806
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:35,280
Table

807
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:36,480
Mountains and uh provides minimum

808
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:39,960
requirements

809
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:43,280
for the relation between size of the

810
00:40:39,960 --> 00:40:45,359
wind R and minimum requirements for

811
00:40:43,280 --> 00:40:47,000
turning and

812
00:40:45,359 --> 00:40:49,640
Aviation

813
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,440
so feed stock

814
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:57,240
mix um uh limiting the size of the windr

815
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:58,359
plus turning and ariation as minimum

816
00:40:57,240 --> 00:41:01,119
[Music]

817
00:40:58,359 --> 00:41:04,240
requirements and if this is already not

818
00:41:01,119 --> 00:41:06,400
only in a guideline but in a binding you

819
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:12,000
know setup

820
00:41:06,400 --> 00:41:16,640
Bing uh component element in the

821
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:18,960
National liing procedure it is also

822
00:41:16,640 --> 00:41:21,520
educating the authorities and the

823
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:22,359
experts in the authorities and in the

824
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,560
local

825
00:41:22,359 --> 00:41:27,319
governments and this is another very

826
00:41:24,560 --> 00:41:30,480
important message that education is need

827
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:33,680
needed for all involved parties not only

828
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:37,960
for the composting plant operators and

829
00:41:33,680 --> 00:41:42,359
between the experts no you have to take

830
00:41:37,960 --> 00:41:44,560
on board the local government and the uh

831
00:41:42,359 --> 00:41:47,240
representative of the authorities which

832
00:41:44,560 --> 00:41:50,240
are involved in the licensing and in the

833
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:52,720
control and this is just the scheme of

834
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:58,079
the uh quality

835
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,760
assurance system where all um composting

836
00:41:58,079 --> 00:42:03,960
plants and this was very important for

837
00:42:00,760 --> 00:42:07,440
the farmers are obliged to be

838
00:42:03,960 --> 00:42:09,640
members um so they have one person

839
00:42:07,440 --> 00:42:13,160
visiting them taking the

840
00:42:09,640 --> 00:42:15,880
samples um um providing the report from

841
00:42:13,160 --> 00:42:19,800
the accredited laboratory and there is

842
00:42:15,880 --> 00:42:26,119
an independent committee that would

843
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:28,760
speak out on a the certificate year by

844
00:42:26,119 --> 00:42:31,400
year so every composting

845
00:42:28,760 --> 00:42:33,599
plants receives such a

846
00:42:31,400 --> 00:42:36,559
certificate uh he can use for his

847
00:42:33,599 --> 00:42:40,280
marketing and is is well known and

848
00:42:36,559 --> 00:42:41,400
accepted by all professional uses and in

849
00:42:40,280 --> 00:42:44,160
the

850
00:42:41,400 --> 00:42:48,119
markets that's another example how this

851
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:50,520
is done on a European level also there's

852
00:42:48,119 --> 00:42:53,559
a intensive cooperation with the

853
00:42:50,520 --> 00:42:55,520
European compost Network and we

854
00:42:53,559 --> 00:42:57,800
personally in our Institute we also

855
00:42:55,520 --> 00:43:00,160
provide International certification for

856
00:42:57,800 --> 00:43:02,599
countries who do not have the

857
00:43:00,160 --> 00:43:05,520
infrastructure for certification of

858
00:43:02,599 --> 00:43:09,000
compost and every second year there is a

859
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:13,200
big yester big celebration where the

860
00:43:09,000 --> 00:43:14,880
best 10 composting composts are awarded

861
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:17,880
with the so-called

862
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:19,720
composta uh that are tested for the

863
00:43:17,880 --> 00:43:22,200
parameters I showed you before or you

864
00:43:19,720 --> 00:43:24,559
will see them when you receive the

865
00:43:22,200 --> 00:43:25,920
presentation and finally but finally

866
00:43:24,559 --> 00:43:28,400
education

867
00:43:25,920 --> 00:43:31,119
internationally and don't know I I'm

868
00:43:28,400 --> 00:43:32,559
used all my time more than my time I

869
00:43:31,119 --> 00:43:37,200
guess

870
00:43:32,559 --> 00:43:41,040
already um uh you see uh after the

871
00:43:37,200 --> 00:43:44,520
Corona and covid break I'm happy to

uh of the composting separate collection

878
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:06,640
scheme specifically in the the

879
00:44:03,440 --> 00:44:08,960
decentralized model which is quite

880
00:44:06,640 --> 00:44:13,240
unique in Europe and I would say

881
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:16,680
worldwide but I'm very happy it's not

882
00:44:13,240 --> 00:44:20,160

management and treatment of a variety of

913
00:45:43,040 --> 00:45:47,640
organic waste he holds several patents

management so take us away

920
00:46:05,400 --> 00:46:12,960

00:46:24,400 --> 00:46:28,720
webinar and uh I I think that now you

927
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:31,680
are going to understand why at the

928
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:34,480
beginning I asked to to Linda that

929
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:36,359
floran has to talk before me because

930
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,359
what we are going to to show you what I

931
00:46:36,359 --> 00:46:42,280
going to present you is a much more

932
00:46:39,359 --> 00:46:43,800
modest uh implementation of the fun

933
00:46:42,280 --> 00:46:47,520
composting of the decentralized

934
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:49,200
composting model related to to farms and

935
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:53,280
the first steps that we are developing

936
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:55,839
here in Spain so that's either just you

937
00:46:53,280 --> 00:47:00,400
have it if you want to know who I

938
00:46:55,839 --> 00:47:03,040
am here in Spain we are uh defending

939
00:47:00,400 --> 00:47:05,000
that the bowte management should have

940
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:07,960
three models or

941
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:10,319
three first

942
00:47:07,960 --> 00:47:12,800
approaches the model without collection

943
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:14,839
of the food waste needed

944
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:15,839
Transportation the models were okay

945
00:47:14,839 --> 00:47:17,760
there is a collection but the

946
00:47:15,839 --> 00:47:20,960
transportation is minimum you don't go

947
00:47:17,760 --> 00:47:23,960
very far from the town from the village

948
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,400
from the city and the centralized models

949
00:47:23,960 --> 00:47:28,599
that are based on collection and

950
00:47:25,400 --> 00:47:30,520
transportation to big facilities to be

951
00:47:28,599 --> 00:47:33,400
uh plants treatment

952
00:47:30,520 --> 00:47:36,000
plants the first two

953
00:47:33,400 --> 00:47:37,920
models we think that can be done with

954
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:42,440
very simple and economical technology

955
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:46,520
low cost low tax system but as floran

956
00:47:42,440 --> 00:47:49,559
said we need a very clean by ways with

957
00:47:46,520 --> 00:47:52,520
very low content in contaminants of in

958
00:47:49,559 --> 00:47:54,640
properties those systems are low Tech

959
00:47:52,520 --> 00:47:57,079
because we need people so we are going

960
00:47:54,640 --> 00:48:00,720
to rise the employment rates if in the

961
00:47:57,079 --> 00:48:03,000
area we we change equipments for jobs

962
00:48:00,720 --> 00:48:05,359
they are effective if we do it well it

963
00:48:03,000 --> 00:48:08,400
allows to reach successful results and

964
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,319
we have many to present and what we

965
00:48:08,400 --> 00:48:12,720
think that is more important is that

966
00:48:10,319 --> 00:48:14,200
involve citizens because people is going

967
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:16,280
to see in front of them what is

968
00:48:14,200 --> 00:48:18,680
happening with their wasted especially

969
00:48:16,280 --> 00:48:22,000
with the fot waste with the kitchen

970
00:48:18,680 --> 00:48:23,800
waste and what it means the quantities

971
00:48:22,000 --> 00:48:27,280
what it means why they do not separate

972
00:48:23,800 --> 00:48:30,000
it well and the possibilities to form

973
00:48:27,280 --> 00:48:33,319
that way into a resource so at the end

974
00:48:30,000 --> 00:48:36,720
the territory is also involved in the

975
00:48:33,319 --> 00:48:38,839
management moreover we can't involve

976
00:48:36,720 --> 00:48:41,400
local companies small companies small

977
00:48:38,839 --> 00:48:43,760
and medium companies and even those

978
00:48:41,400 --> 00:48:47,559
companies with social Enterprises that

979
00:48:43,760 --> 00:48:50,960
allow that uh people in risk of social

980
00:48:47,559 --> 00:48:53,040
exclusion could perform specific task

981
00:48:50,960 --> 00:48:54,480
that are related in one way or another

982
00:48:53,040 --> 00:48:56,799
with the composting with the local

983
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:59,319
composting so we think that with this

984
00:48:56,799 --> 00:49:02,079
system you can develop a real local

985
00:48:59,319 --> 00:49:04,440
economy circular Economy based in the

986
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:08,799
treatment of the kitchen ways or and

987
00:49:04,440 --> 00:49:12,799
other kinds of uh organic

988
00:49:08,799 --> 00:49:15,119
wastes the centralized models that uh we

989
00:49:12,799 --> 00:49:18,079
are looking for big facilities with high

990
00:49:15,119 --> 00:49:21,119
technology that allow us to treat food

991
00:49:18,079 --> 00:49:23,720
waste or any other kind of organic waste

992
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:26,160
with a lot of contaminants uh we don't

993
00:49:23,720 --> 00:49:29,079
care too much for the collection systems

994
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:32,079
there are automatic most of most of the

995
00:49:29,079 --> 00:49:34,359
of the system so the employment rate is

996
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:37,119
much lower than in the others the

997
00:49:34,359 --> 00:49:39,200
results are mixed in the meaning that in

998
00:49:37,119 --> 00:49:40,880
some cases we have very good results and

999
00:49:39,200 --> 00:49:44,160
they those

1000
00:49:40,880 --> 00:49:47,000
facilities produce a relatively good

1001
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:50,240
product but in others it's a complete

1002
00:49:47,000 --> 00:49:52,359
disaster and uh they are distance to the

1003
00:49:50,240 --> 00:49:54,559
people it mean that people do not care

1004
00:49:52,359 --> 00:49:56,400
about what happens with the waste they

1005
00:49:54,559 --> 00:49:57,160
only care for the container that they

1006
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,480
have

1007
00:49:57,160 --> 00:50:01,839
uh in front of their house or not far

1008
00:49:59,480 --> 00:50:04,160
from from their house that it has to be

1009
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:08,079
empty every night that's just what they

1010
00:50:04,160 --> 00:50:11,319
they care for so with that in mind now

1011
00:50:08,079 --> 00:50:13,960
we are going to to travel from the US to

1012
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:16,200
Spain I choose Detroit because it was

1013
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:19,559
the first city I visit when the first

1014
00:50:16,200 --> 00:50:21,359
time I went to to the us and we are

1015
00:50:19,559 --> 00:50:23,000
going to the north of Spain to the city

1016
00:50:21,359 --> 00:50:26,200
of

1017
00:50:23,000 --> 00:50:30,520
bilau and here I we are going to present

1018
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:31,480
you the first examples but before that

1019
00:50:30,520 --> 00:50:35,319
just a

1020
00:50:31,480 --> 00:50:39,720
few few hints about Spain and our Waste

1021
00:50:35,319 --> 00:50:43,839
Management uh results okay this is the

1022
00:50:39,720 --> 00:50:45,680
LA the the last results or the last uh

1023
00:50:43,839 --> 00:50:48,960
numbers we have about the municipal

1024
00:50:45,680 --> 00:50:52,079
waste management so as you can see most

1025
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,680
of our municipal waste goes to lfi

1026
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:59,559
directly to lfi it is a same and we have

1027
00:50:56,680 --> 00:51:01,799
have a lot of work to do to fulfill all

1028
00:50:59,559 --> 00:51:05,559
the European directives about Waste

1029
00:51:01,799 --> 00:51:07,760
Management we are in the queue and as

1030
00:51:05,559 --> 00:51:10,200
you can see at the at the left of the

1031
00:51:07,760 --> 00:51:13,559
graph for composting and anerobic

1032
00:51:10,200 --> 00:51:16,280
digestion we just recover the 3% of the

1033
00:51:13,559 --> 00:51:18,960
of the waste of the municipal waste

1034
00:51:16,280 --> 00:51:21,559
maybe you can you can find in in some

1035
00:51:18,960 --> 00:51:24,240
reports and some articles that the

1036
00:51:21,559 --> 00:51:27,040
number is around 17 why because they

1037
00:51:24,240 --> 00:51:30,079
considered that all the food waste that

1038
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:32,599
are mixed with the residual waste so I

1039
00:51:30,079 --> 00:51:35,079
mean those fractions that that not

1040
00:51:32,599 --> 00:51:37,079
separate on SES and that go to

1041
00:51:35,079 --> 00:51:39,640
Mechanical biological treatment

1042
00:51:37,079 --> 00:51:43,480
facilities it's also

1043
00:51:39,640 --> 00:51:45,280
composting but in the real reality the

1044
00:51:43,480 --> 00:51:49,839
the quantity of food waste that is

1045
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:51,880
recovered separately it's just the 3% so

1046
00:51:49,839 --> 00:51:54,119
as I said we have a lot of things to do

1047
00:51:51,880 --> 00:51:56,119
in this in this

1048
00:51:54,119 --> 00:51:58,520
country about the distribution of

1049
00:51:56,119 --> 00:52:00,400
population it is interesting to

1050
00:51:58,520 --> 00:52:02,400
understand what is happening here you

1051
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,040
can see in this map of Spain a

1052
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,200
distribution of the population and every

1053
00:52:05,040 --> 00:52:10,000
Spike you are seeing there are points

1054
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:12,920
with a higher density than than others

1055
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:15,240
so you can see the main cities of Spain

1056
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:17,480
the center you can see this is the

1057
00:52:15,240 --> 00:52:19,760
capital Madrid here in the Mediterranean

1058
00:52:17,480 --> 00:52:22,799
Coast is Barcelona and all the

1059
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:25,520
municipalities around the north this is

1060
00:52:22,799 --> 00:52:27,079
bilau and other other cities and

1061
00:52:25,520 --> 00:52:28,960
Sebastian

1062
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:31,359
and this is Valencia and you can see

1063
00:52:28,960 --> 00:52:34,079
okay this is the big or the capitals of

1064
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:36,559
the province of different states in

1065
00:52:34,079 --> 00:52:39,839
results 50% of the population of Spain

1066
00:52:36,559 --> 00:52:42,760
lives in 125 municipalities and we have

1067
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:46,559
more than 8,000 municipalities in in in

1068
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:48,839
Spain so half of the of the population

1069
00:52:46,559 --> 00:52:50,240
of this country it's distributed it's

1070
00:52:48,839 --> 00:52:52,720
dispersed in the

1071
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:56,799
countryside and our Waste Management

1072
00:52:52,720 --> 00:52:58,680
model is in most of our region is

1073
00:52:56,799 --> 00:53:01,680
completely centralized this is the

1074
00:52:58,680 --> 00:53:03,880
number of mbts facilities as I said

1075
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,079
before this is with not separation of

1076
00:53:03,880 --> 00:53:08,319
the food

1077
00:53:05,079 --> 00:53:10,559
was you can see the the this bar is a

1078
00:53:08,319 --> 00:53:13,960
comparison between different regions and

1079
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:17,319
you see most of them are in Barcelona in

1080
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:18,799
Catalonia in the South and Del Lucia

1081
00:53:17,319 --> 00:53:21,359
there are

1082
00:53:18,799 --> 00:53:24,319
Madrid if we talk about composting for

1083
00:53:21,359 --> 00:53:26,040
food waste for biow Waste you can see

1084
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,119
that there's a big difference Catalonia

1085
00:53:26,040 --> 00:53:29,480
and the

1086
00:53:27,119 --> 00:53:32,680
rest why because here in Catalonia we

1087
00:53:29,480 --> 00:53:36,000
have around 27 composting facilities for

1088
00:53:32,680 --> 00:53:39,040
food waste and in the rest of of Spain

1089
00:53:36,000 --> 00:53:41,400
this is is an emptiness because the

1090
00:53:39,040 --> 00:53:44,920
north we have here we have we have two

1091
00:53:41,400 --> 00:53:48,040
now we have one in the B country we have

1092
00:53:44,920 --> 00:53:51,280
uh another one in in Nar and now we are

1093
00:53:48,040 --> 00:53:55,280
building two more Madrid have just uh

1094
00:53:51,280 --> 00:53:57,440
one of uh here in my homeland Gala in

1095
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:59,520
the Northwest here we just have at this

1096
00:53:57,440 --> 00:54:01,799
moment one that is operating there are

1097
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:03,720
another that are private but public that

1098
00:54:01,799 --> 00:54:07,000
is just one so as you can see the

1099
00:54:03,720 --> 00:54:09,839
different is huge what it means that if

1100
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:12,200
we're trying to compare the uh

1101
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:15,240
centralized models and the centralized

1102
00:54:12,200 --> 00:54:17,760
models I did this this number according

1103
00:54:15,240 --> 00:54:19,440
to the to the number of of composting

1104
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:22,079
facilities in different countries in

1105
00:54:19,440 --> 00:54:24,079
Europe and the inhabitants as you can

1106
00:54:22,079 --> 00:54:27,359
see Portugal it has a composting

1107
00:54:24,079 --> 00:54:29,359
facility for every five Millions vers

1108
00:54:27,359 --> 00:54:32,599
the Spain is one composing facility for

1109
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:35,119
every 1.5 million but if we take out

1110
00:54:32,599 --> 00:54:36,280
Catalonia it this number rise to more

1111
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:38,839
than three

1112
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:40,880
millions one composed facility for every

1113
00:54:38,839 --> 00:54:44,359
three millions person at the bottom

1114
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:46,559
Austria as you have now listened to fan

1115
00:54:44,359 --> 00:54:48,760
and you can understand what they meaning

1116
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:51,720
uh my numbers was around one composting

1117
00:54:48,760 --> 00:54:55,760
facility for every 19 uh inhabitants

1118
00:54:51,720 --> 00:54:57,000
floran Now update that data to 22,000

1119
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,599
but as you can see see the big

1120
00:54:57,000 --> 00:55:01,440
difference okay the different approach

1121
00:54:59,599 --> 00:55:03,920
to the strategy of Waste Management the

1122
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:08,000
centralized models confronting front

1123
00:55:03,920 --> 00:55:11,119
centralized models like Spain and

1124
00:55:08,000 --> 00:55:14,680
talking about another uh models like

1125
00:55:11,119 --> 00:55:16,119
houseold composting there are some areas

1126
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:17,920
in the north where there are many

1127
00:55:16,119 --> 00:55:21,119
composter distributed in the in the

1128
00:55:17,920 --> 00:55:24,280
households but uh at the end not all of

1129
00:55:21,119 --> 00:55:26,480
them have been really monitored so we

1130
00:55:24,280 --> 00:55:29,440
don't really know they're being well

1131
00:55:26,480 --> 00:55:30,799
managed or not if they are uh processing

1132
00:55:29,440 --> 00:55:33,039
all the food waste that is being

1133
00:55:30,799 --> 00:55:36,000
generated in the household or not so

1134
00:55:33,039 --> 00:55:39,200
this number have to be taken with cus

1135
00:55:36,000 --> 00:55:43,520
and Community composting okay here we

1136
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:45,240
have uh two regions that there are the

1137
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:47,920
the main leaders at this moment this is

1138
00:55:45,240 --> 00:55:51,640
in the north Bas country was here they

1139
00:55:47,920 --> 00:55:54,640
were the Pioneers in in the meaning that

1140
00:55:51,640 --> 00:55:56,760
around 13 14 years ago we begin to

1141
00:55:54,640 --> 00:56:00,960
experiment with different municipal with

1142
00:55:56,760 --> 00:56:04,839
the different models that could be

1143
00:56:00,960 --> 00:56:06,960
implemented in in in their towns and

1144
00:56:04,839 --> 00:56:09,599
Village and nowadays there are more than

1145
00:56:06,960 --> 00:56:11,480
500 Community composting areas and 13

1146
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:14,520
different models of community composting

1147
00:56:11,480 --> 00:56:17,520
here in the west this is the province of

1148
00:56:14,520 --> 00:56:22,960
poned this is where I was born and here

1149
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:25,359
we there is a a model with a very um in

1150
00:56:22,960 --> 00:56:27,720
intensive program about decentralized

1151
00:56:25,359 --> 00:56:31,240
composting basic on community composting

1152
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,280
and nowadays they are treating almost

1153
00:56:31,240 --> 00:56:36,760
3,500 tons of food waste per year in

1154
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:40,079
community composting areas and there are

1155
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:42,119
some areas in in the in the east in in

1156
00:56:40,079 --> 00:56:45,000
the community of Valencia there are some

1157
00:56:42,119 --> 00:56:47,039
initiatives Navar it's now also in the

1158
00:56:45,000 --> 00:56:49,720
Northeast they beginning with a very

1159
00:56:47,039 --> 00:56:51,520
intensive project and some areas of

1160
00:56:49,720 --> 00:56:54,200
Catalonia they have a very interesting

1161
00:56:51,520 --> 00:56:56,280
developing of community composting in

1162
00:56:54,200 --> 00:56:57,880
the rest there are also there are other

1163
00:56:56,280 --> 00:57:01,440
experience but there are not

1164
00:56:57,880 --> 00:57:03,760
Alternatives real alternatives to bowte

1165
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:06,119
management so they need to have a

1166
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:08,880
complimentary system with a collection

1167
00:57:06,119 --> 00:57:10,559
so this is the overview of Spain and our

1168
00:57:08,880 --> 00:57:12,920
Waste Management model and now I'm going

1169
00:57:10,559 --> 00:57:16,240
to present you the different

1170
00:57:12,920 --> 00:57:19,640
examples we go to the North La

1171
00:57:16,240 --> 00:57:23,319
lichu uh those were the Pioneers in in

1172
00:57:19,640 --> 00:57:23,319
the farm composting in

1173
00:57:24,039 --> 00:57:29,839
Spain here this is a small

1174
00:57:26,760 --> 00:57:33,240
Village of larab betu it's close to to

1175
00:57:29,839 --> 00:57:34,760
bilau around 20 kilom far it has uh

1176
00:57:33,240 --> 00:57:38,839
around 2,000

1177
00:57:34,760 --> 00:57:41,280
inhabitants and as they were about 20

1178
00:57:38,839 --> 00:57:44,640
kilometers far from from the big city in

1179
00:57:41,280 --> 00:57:46,680
the area it means that they have to pay

1180
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:50,640
for the collection taxes and the

1181
00:57:46,680 --> 00:57:52,520
transportation cost this uh uh higher

1182
00:57:50,640 --> 00:57:54,280
prices than than the neighbors because

1183
00:57:52,520 --> 00:57:57,520
they were at the end of the valley so

1184
00:57:54,280 --> 00:57:59,880
the tracks have to go there collect a

1185
00:57:57,520 --> 00:58:02,240
few kilograms of food waste and then

1186
00:57:59,880 --> 00:58:04,799
come back to the big facility so for

1187
00:58:02,240 --> 00:58:06,440
this Village it means a lot of money so

1188
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:09,119
in

1189
00:58:06,440 --> 00:58:11,359
2013 uh some neighbors here begin to

1190
00:58:09,119 --> 00:58:15,280
think that some other options could be

1191
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:18,280
available for them and they have heard

1192
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:21,960
something about the Austrian model here

1193
00:58:18,280 --> 00:58:25,839
in Spain it's uh you can some in some

1194
00:58:21,960 --> 00:58:27,880
places you can you can listen that the

1195
00:58:25,839 --> 00:58:29,520
that sentence Oh we have to replicate

1196
00:58:27,880 --> 00:58:32,319
the Austrian model or you have to look

1197
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:34,160
for the Austrian model so Florian so

1198
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,200
explain you what we think what is the

1199
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,920
Austrian model so they wanted to do

1200
00:58:36,200 --> 00:58:41,039
something like that they contact me and

1201
00:58:38,920 --> 00:58:42,960
we were thinking about which were the

1202
00:58:41,039 --> 00:58:45,960
real possibilities for then to to

1203
00:58:42,960 --> 00:58:49,079
perform some kind of local composting

1204
00:58:45,960 --> 00:58:53,160
based in the action of local

1205
00:58:49,079 --> 00:58:56,280
farmers so nowadays you're going to see

1206
00:58:53,160 --> 00:58:58,960
we develop a A system that they are been

1207
00:58:56,280 --> 00:59:01,880
running during all these years that uh

1208
00:58:58,960 --> 00:59:04,680
at this moment involve 290 families nine

1209
00:59:01,880 --> 00:59:06,720
big producers big producers I mean uh

1210
00:59:04,680 --> 00:59:11,000
shops

1211
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:12,480
restaurants um Fresh Markets in the area

1212
00:59:11,000 --> 00:59:14,400
and they have at this moment three

1213
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:17,079
simple composting facilities that

1214
00:59:14,400 --> 00:59:20,079
managed by by Farmers uh a few months

1215
00:59:17,079 --> 00:59:23,480
ago they were four but now

1216
00:59:20,079 --> 00:59:25,000
the one of the farmers uh decided that

1217
00:59:23,480 --> 00:59:26,880
he couldn't continue with with with the

1218
00:59:25,000 --> 00:59:29,280
program as you see

1219
00:59:26,880 --> 00:59:30,079
these composting areas they are very

1220
00:59:29,280 --> 00:59:33,359
very

1221
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:36,280
simple they were made by the by the

1222
00:59:33,359 --> 00:59:38,400
neighbors and with recycled materials so

1223
00:59:36,280 --> 00:59:39,680
the boots that you can see here they

1224
00:59:38,400 --> 00:59:42,359
were

1225
00:59:39,680 --> 00:59:45,640
recycled and the system is very very

1226
00:59:42,359 --> 00:59:47,880
simple it's Bas it in the three or four

1227
00:59:45,640 --> 00:59:51,119
boxes that when one is full they have to

1228
00:59:47,880 --> 00:59:53,280
move the material to the next and

1229
00:59:51,119 --> 00:59:56,920
continue and as you can see this is more

1230
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:59,280
or less how it looks

1231
00:59:56,920 --> 01:00:01,880
why we can do it like that Florian also

1232
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:04,599
explain it we have a very very good

1233
01:00:01,880 --> 01:00:06,720
quality of the foot waste it have less

1234
01:00:04,599 --> 01:00:08,559
than 1% of contaminants even we can

1235
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:12,559
think about less than

1236
01:00:08,559 --> 01:00:13,799
0.5 so it's extremely easy to treat it

1237
01:00:12,559 --> 01:00:18,440
here you

1238
01:00:13,799 --> 01:00:21,480
have uh some videos where you can see

1239
01:00:18,440 --> 01:00:24,160
how the the system works okay so the fot

1240
01:00:21,480 --> 01:00:27,359
waste is generated in the households so

1241
01:00:24,160 --> 01:00:30,440
they collected in a very small

1242
01:00:27,359 --> 01:00:32,760
then three days during the week they can

1243
01:00:30,440 --> 01:00:35,359
take it out to the street to to the

1244
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:39,799
doors of the building or the house and

1245
01:00:35,359 --> 01:00:42,319
then the the farmer the basara is the

1246
01:00:39,799 --> 01:00:44,119
the war in in Bas

1247
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:46,720
language

1248
01:00:44,119 --> 01:00:49,960
collected okay at the beginning they

1249
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,119
have just one one farmer and they they

1250
01:00:49,960 --> 01:00:55,000
realized that it was impossible to keep

1251
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:57,400
the the service during the world year so

1252
01:00:55,000 --> 01:00:59,880
they look for other to join the the

1253
01:00:57,400 --> 01:01:02,039
program and at this moment as I say they

1254
01:00:59,880 --> 01:01:05,319
they are three so they they distribute

1255
01:01:02,039 --> 01:01:08,640
when and how they they collect the the

1256
01:01:05,319 --> 01:01:10,839
food waste every week in the composting

1257
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:14,599
facility they measure the quantity of

1258
01:01:10,839 --> 01:01:17,200
the food waste by volume and they uh

1259
01:01:14,599 --> 01:01:19,160
just put it inside the inside the boxes

1260
01:01:17,200 --> 01:01:21,280
they add the the bulky material that

1261
01:01:19,160 --> 01:01:24,039
they have from their activity in in the

1262
01:01:21,280 --> 01:01:26,680
farm and from that the beginning the

1263
01:01:24,039 --> 01:01:29,280
process begin as you know at the end

1264
01:01:26,680 --> 01:01:33,039
they use Farmers really want the compost

1265
01:01:29,280 --> 01:01:36,720
for for the crop plants because the the

1266
01:01:33,039 --> 01:01:39,000
lands in that area are quite poor in

1267
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:41,520
infertility because of industrial

1268
01:01:39,000 --> 01:01:43,880
activity that they had in in the area in

1269
01:01:41,520 --> 01:01:46,960
the previous year and those vegetables

1270
01:01:43,880 --> 01:01:50,680
are sold to the to the to the neighbors

1271
01:01:46,960 --> 01:01:53,880
to the population so they they close the

1272
01:01:50,680 --> 01:01:59,760
cycle during these

1273
01:01:53,880 --> 01:02:05,160
years ER what the they got

1274
01:01:59,760 --> 01:02:07,440
is the as I said the uh the they see

1275
01:02:05,160 --> 01:02:11,119
that it was impossible to keep the the

1276
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:14,000
service if they don't have more than two

1277
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:17,640
or three Farmers involved

1278
01:02:14,000 --> 01:02:20,200
because any injur of the of the farmer

1279
01:02:17,640 --> 01:02:22,559
got ill or he wants to take up a

1280
01:02:20,200 --> 01:02:25,440
holidays a vacation anything they want

1281
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:28,640
to do they couldn't take the the

1282
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:30,760
population un attended so they begin to

1283
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:32,039
involve other Farmers they begin to try

1284
01:02:30,760 --> 01:02:34,680
with other

1285
01:02:32,039 --> 01:02:37,160
system as I said they were the Pioneers

1286
01:02:34,680 --> 01:02:39,880
so they were experimenting a lot with

1287
01:02:37,160 --> 01:02:42,039
these typical home composters for the

1288
01:02:39,880 --> 01:02:42,920
first stages and then they move it to

1289
01:02:42,039 --> 01:02:46,520
the

1290
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:49,720
next and one of the most interesting

1291
01:02:46,520 --> 01:02:52,359
things here was that in

1292
01:02:49,720 --> 01:02:55,000
2015 one of the most important

1293
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:57,240
restaurants in Spain one of with three

1294
01:02:55,000 --> 01:03:01,640
Michelin star one of those restaurants

1295
01:02:57,240 --> 01:03:03,920
that they give you uh a this like this

1296
01:03:01,640 --> 01:03:07,680
and the quantity of food is like this

1297
01:03:03,920 --> 01:03:10,799
and the bill is three pages at least and

1298
01:03:07,680 --> 01:03:13,799
have no less than two zos so one of

1299
01:03:10,799 --> 01:03:17,039
those restaurants joined the project and

1300
01:03:13,799 --> 01:03:20,599
it was very very funny because here you

1301
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:23,200
have the composting area the first one

1302
01:03:20,599 --> 01:03:26,319
and it's around less than a mile far

1303
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:29,680
from the from the uh from the town from

1304
01:03:26,319 --> 01:03:32,240
larab betu and the restaurant it's just

1305
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:35,160
here really really close to the

1306
01:03:32,240 --> 01:03:38,079
composting area but they just wanted

1307
01:03:35,160 --> 01:03:40,079
more and more F waste beans they didn't

1308
01:03:38,079 --> 01:03:43,359
want to know nothing about compost until

1309
01:03:40,079 --> 01:03:45,520
the moment that the tong Hall decide

1310
01:03:43,359 --> 01:03:48,520
okay this is the bill for all the

1311
01:03:45,520 --> 01:03:50,480
containers that you're asking for and if

1312
01:03:48,520 --> 01:03:51,920
you don't want to pay it you have to

1313
01:03:50,480 --> 01:03:55,480
take your food waste and go to the

1314
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:58,960
composting area and uh put it there for

1315
01:03:55,480 --> 01:04:02,039
to be processed and they wanted to say

1316
01:03:58,960 --> 01:04:04,599
okay we will do it and moreover they

1317
01:04:02,039 --> 01:04:07,559
begin to announce in the in the press

1318
01:04:04,599 --> 01:04:10,839
and in their web their web page that

1319
01:04:07,559 --> 01:04:13,960
they were making compost and at this

1320
01:04:10,839 --> 01:04:17,880
moment uh two years ago they got an

1321
01:04:13,960 --> 01:04:19,839
international prize award related to the

1322
01:04:17,880 --> 01:04:21,880
was the most sustainable restaurant in

1323
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:24,640
the world because they were performing

1324
01:04:21,880 --> 01:04:27,279
composting and other things of course

1325
01:04:24,640 --> 01:04:28,960
but since then moment the pro here you

1326
01:04:27,279 --> 01:04:31,359
can see this is the restant here at the

1327
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:35,079
bottom of the compos facility and since

1328
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:38,480
that moment the the project got more uh

1329
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:40,880
strength and it was more respected uh

1330
01:04:38,480 --> 01:04:43,680
for the local

1331
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:45,960
authorities this is the quantities of uh

1332
01:04:43,680 --> 01:04:49,039
food waste that they are processing in

1333
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:50,319
in this model okay here in the yellow

1334
01:04:49,039 --> 01:04:51,839
ones you can see this is from the

1335
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,720
restaurant this is the quantity from the

1336
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:56,839
restaurant

1337
01:04:53,720 --> 01:05:00,760
20202 because of the copy the quantities

1338
01:04:56,839 --> 01:05:03,160
was more smaller as you can see more

1339
01:05:00,760 --> 01:05:06,839
they processing 70 to little more than

1340
01:05:03,160 --> 01:05:09,559
80 tons per per year that's quite uh

1341
01:05:06,839 --> 01:05:13,200
modest this these are are the results

1342
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:15,720
from the analytics of the first compost

1343
01:05:13,200 --> 01:05:19,039
they complies all the exigencies that we

1344
01:05:15,720 --> 01:05:21,839
have here in Spain for the for compost

1345
01:05:19,039 --> 01:05:23,680
and it has the highest legal quality

1346
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:26,680
related to the heavy metals content is

1347
01:05:23,680 --> 01:05:29,960
Class A so here it Spain it will be

1348
01:05:26,680 --> 01:05:32,240
available to use in organic farming pros

1349
01:05:29,960 --> 01:05:33,839
and cons of the project okay it came

1350
01:05:32,240 --> 01:05:38,839
from the citizens that was very

1351
01:05:33,839 --> 01:05:41,680
important because it give you a a high

1352
01:05:38,839 --> 01:05:44,200
resistance and citizens convince the

1353
01:05:41,680 --> 01:05:47,559
authorities that it was good that it was

1354
01:05:44,200 --> 01:05:52,480
uh it has a future and at the end all

1355
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:54,680
the Mayors accept it and and and bet the

1356
01:05:52,480 --> 01:05:56,240
that it could be a future for for the

1357
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:58,319
for the town

1358
01:05:56,240 --> 01:06:00,279
it gives you a rent to the to the

1359
01:05:58,319 --> 01:06:04,039
farmers so they allow it to continue

1360
01:06:00,279 --> 01:06:05,599
their activities families are encouraged

1361
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:07,839
to participate it because they really

1362
01:06:05,599 --> 01:06:09,960
know what happens with the wasted and

1363
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:12,440
they know they are for good and not just

1364
01:06:09,960 --> 01:06:15,599
for them for all the population it's

1365
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:18,000
simple it's a very simple system and

1366
01:06:15,599 --> 01:06:20,279
they could incorporate new incentives in

1367
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:24,160
in the area like social

1368
01:06:20,279 --> 01:06:27,400
currency problems that as I said they

1369
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:30,520
began in 2013 now we are 10 years later

1370
01:06:27,400 --> 01:06:33,279
they are still with the same uh model so

1371
01:06:30,520 --> 01:06:35,200
they have to improve it yet and they

1372
01:06:33,279 --> 01:06:39,520
will take it they have to invest more

1373
01:06:35,200 --> 01:06:41,319
money to to get all the all the efforts

1374
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:45,240
and all the permits that the authorities

1375
01:06:41,319 --> 01:06:48,000
act the uh Regional authorities ask them

1376
01:06:45,240 --> 01:06:50,119
to have and they have a big dependence

1377
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:53,359
of the number of of

1378
01:06:50,119 --> 01:06:56,480
farmers okay now we go very not far from

1379
01:06:53,359 --> 01:06:58,599
here in in the North surville

1380
01:06:56,480 --> 01:07:00,240
and here we have also the

1381
01:06:58,599 --> 01:07:02,720
first

1382
01:07:00,240 --> 01:07:05,920
composting uh facility that are really

1383
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:08,559
managed by a farmer it is a a bigger

1384
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,079
town and here we have we find household

1385
01:07:08,559 --> 01:07:12,680
composting Community

1386
01:07:10,079 --> 01:07:15,160
composting and with the for the families

1387
01:07:12,680 --> 01:07:18,520
that do not perform one of those systems

1388
01:07:15,160 --> 01:07:20,079
they have doorto door collection and

1389
01:07:18,520 --> 01:07:21,880
what they're doing now is they're taking

1390
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,200
part of that to toor collection and

1391
01:07:21,880 --> 01:07:26,400
going to a

1392
01:07:23,200 --> 01:07:30,000
farmer here where they receive two tons

1393
01:07:26,400 --> 01:07:32,839
of bowte every 15 days so he's not under

1394
01:07:30,000 --> 01:07:34,760
pressure he can manage them with calm

1395
01:07:32,839 --> 01:07:37,359
and do all the things they have to be

1396
01:07:34,760 --> 01:07:40,200
done to be be sure that you have a good

1397
01:07:37,359 --> 01:07:43,599
compost they have a a small Turner

1398
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:46,760
machine that was also made in

1399
01:07:43,599 --> 01:07:48,839
Spain and the bulky material is is

1400
01:07:46,760 --> 01:07:49,480
provided by the municipality and also by

1401
01:07:48,839 --> 01:07:52,839
the

1402
01:07:49,480 --> 01:07:55,039
farmers all the farmers were trained and

1403
01:07:52,839 --> 01:07:57,039
they have a very specific protocol for

1404
01:07:55,039 --> 01:08:01,440
the manage M of food waste so when the

1405
01:07:57,039 --> 01:08:04,520
TRU arrives they they are prepared to to

1406
01:08:01,440 --> 01:08:06,680
process immediately all the food waste

1407
01:08:04,520 --> 01:08:09,799
and build the

1408
01:08:06,680 --> 01:08:14,079
windro perform the turnings and to keep

1409
01:08:09,799 --> 01:08:17,839
it covered and under control at at every

1410
01:08:14,079 --> 01:08:21,440
moment so all the parameters are

1411
01:08:17,839 --> 01:08:23,719
monitored uh not uh at every moment but

1412
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:26,560
yes every day we have the register of

1413
01:08:23,719 --> 01:08:29,120
temperatures or and either they have any

1414
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:31,920
any problem they find or they sense any

1415
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:36,080
smell or anything they immediately take

1416
01:08:31,920 --> 01:08:38,960
note and and and try to correct it and

1417
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:42,359
before the use the product is analyzed

1418
01:08:38,960 --> 01:08:44,239
so all authorities can have the can be

1419
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:47,080
sure that we are not doing anything

1420
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:49,120
harmful for the environmental or for the

1421
01:08:47,080 --> 01:08:51,560
final destination of the

1422
01:08:49,120 --> 01:08:54,560
compost we are still in the north this

1423
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:56,759
is a project uh that was Finance

1424
01:08:54,560 --> 01:08:59,839
financed by the European union and the

1425
01:08:56,759 --> 01:09:02,400
government of naar that involve a social

1426
01:08:59,839 --> 01:09:03,560
company that called HOSA we are here in

1427
01:09:02,400 --> 01:09:08,239
the

1428
01:09:03,560 --> 01:09:13,520
north here HOSA is a is a social company

1429
01:09:08,239 --> 01:09:15,120
that uh been uh working for 20 years now

1430
01:09:13,520 --> 01:09:19,480
and they produce

1431
01:09:15,120 --> 01:09:24,199
organic uh herbals medicinal medicinal

1432
01:09:19,480 --> 01:09:27,080
herbals and teas and different kinds of

1433
01:09:24,199 --> 01:09:30,880
cosmetic products all made by by organic

1434
01:09:27,080 --> 01:09:33,120
products uh locally and the the workers

1435
01:09:30,880 --> 01:09:35,839
are always people at risk of social

1436
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:38,319
exclusion so one of the problems that

1437
01:09:35,839 --> 01:09:42,159
they had is what they didn't have enough

1438
01:09:38,319 --> 01:09:46,440
compost for their Harvest so they begin

1439
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:49,040
to think after some of our uh meetings

1440
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:51,880
and speechs in the University here in

1441
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:54,840
Nar that maybe it could be possible that

1442
01:09:51,880 --> 01:09:58,000
they uh do perform the collection of

1443
01:09:54,840 --> 01:10:00,640
foot w in their area and with that food

1444
01:09:58,000 --> 01:10:02,960
waste they're going to produce compost

1445
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:05,239
for themselves so they will have an

1446
01:10:02,960 --> 01:10:08,400
economical income for the service that

1447
01:10:05,239 --> 01:10:10,480
they offer to the to the to the towns

1448
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:12,640
around the their

1449
01:10:10,480 --> 01:10:14,159
Farm the collection of the food waste

1450
01:10:12,640 --> 01:10:16,320
and the treatment of the food waste and

1451
01:10:14,159 --> 01:10:18,199
they have also the benefit of the

1452
01:10:16,320 --> 01:10:22,280
compost that they're going to produce

1453
01:10:18,199 --> 01:10:25,159
for their their use so here you have

1454
01:10:22,280 --> 01:10:27,760
it's a very simple composting facility

1455
01:10:25,159 --> 01:10:29,679
the they perform the biow collection to

1456
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:32,400
for the local and they they do the local

1457
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:34,880
treatment also with a very simple T

1458
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:38,199
machine that was made locally with a

1459
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:40,719
black by a blacksmith in the town but

1460
01:10:38,199 --> 01:10:43,679
also in this project we include the

1461
01:10:40,719 --> 01:10:47,480
training so this this facility is also a

1462
01:10:43,679 --> 01:10:51,000
school a school for training people as

1463
01:10:47,480 --> 01:10:53,560
uh Master composters as people that they

1464
01:10:51,000 --> 01:10:56,400
they they learn how what they have to do

1465
01:10:53,560 --> 01:10:58,400
technically I'm I'm Miss administrative

1466
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:00,840
about the management of a composting

1467
01:10:58,400 --> 01:11:03,080
facility they also learn about the

1468
01:11:00,840 --> 01:11:05,159
compost how they can use it to take to

1469
01:11:03,080 --> 01:11:07,600
test the quality of the compost and also

1470
01:11:05,159 --> 01:11:10,280
schools and universities goes there to

1471
01:11:07,600 --> 01:11:11,880
learn more about composting another

1472
01:11:10,280 --> 01:11:14,800
point of this project is that the

1473
01:11:11,880 --> 01:11:16,960
university is related with it in the

1474
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:19,520
research of different organic products

1475
01:11:16,960 --> 01:11:22,360
that can be produced in the composting

1476
01:11:19,520 --> 01:11:26,199
facility not only compost by by itself

1477
01:11:22,360 --> 01:11:29,400
we not a a liquid organic

1478
01:11:26,199 --> 01:11:32,400
fertilizers or different mixes of

1479
01:11:29,400 --> 01:11:35,239
products Bop pesticides Etc so there's

1480
01:11:32,400 --> 01:11:38,880
also a research here and broadcasting we

1481
01:11:35,239 --> 01:11:42,600
also we've been working a lot to promote

1482
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:44,440
this model to make people know about it

1483
01:11:42,600 --> 01:11:48,159
so we try

1484
01:11:44,440 --> 01:11:51,120
to to make it more popular in in in

1485
01:11:48,159 --> 01:11:53,239
other areas of Spain last year we

1486
01:11:51,120 --> 01:11:55,480
received an award from the rural

1487
01:11:53,239 --> 01:11:58,120
Inspiration Awards for resilient food

1488
01:11:55,480 --> 01:12:01,679
future so we think that we were going in

1489
01:11:58,120 --> 01:12:04,080
the right way here another example now

1490
01:12:01,679 --> 01:12:07,400
we're going to the to the isand we go to

1491
01:12:04,080 --> 01:12:10,719
Bic Iceland and this is a project that

1492
01:12:07,400 --> 01:12:12,880
connect tourists with ecology and local

1493
01:12:10,719 --> 01:12:16,480
farming we are in the mayorca island in

1494
01:12:12,880 --> 01:12:18,960
the Mediterranean Sea here okay some

1495
01:12:16,480 --> 01:12:20,679
fast details you see you know here the

1496
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,920
the problem with organic matter in the

1497
01:12:20,679 --> 01:12:26,120
soil in the Mediterranean Basin is

1498
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:28,840
really really terrible we have have most

1499
01:12:26,120 --> 01:12:32,159
of our soils more than 75% of our soils

1500
01:12:28,840 --> 01:12:35,120
have less than 2% of organic matter and

1501
01:12:32,159 --> 01:12:39,120
we are even losing and losing that those

1502
01:12:35,120 --> 01:12:42,320
contents for the island you can see that

1503
01:12:39,120 --> 01:12:45,840
specifically they have six more almost

1504
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:48,440
70% of the soils have an erosion risk

1505
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:52,199
and they are losing almost 12 tons of

1506
01:12:48,440 --> 01:12:55,639
soil peror and per year in the island so

1507
01:12:52,199 --> 01:12:58,000
they need organic matter moreover they

1508
01:12:55,639 --> 01:13:00,239
almost they don't have cattle so it's

1509
01:12:58,000 --> 01:13:03,679
hard for them to get the organic matter

1510
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:06,159
that they need to to to produce compost

1511
01:13:03,679 --> 01:13:10,159
but what they have is a lot of

1512
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:11,560
tourists okay 2020 they have a a drastic

1513
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:14,280
reduction of the number of tourist but

1514
01:13:11,560 --> 01:13:16,440
now they rise again and they have even

1515
01:13:14,280 --> 01:13:18,120
more than before so it means that they

1516
01:13:16,440 --> 01:13:19,920
have a high demand for local resources

1517
01:13:18,120 --> 01:13:23,920
and a high waste

1518
01:13:19,920 --> 01:13:26,239
generation and this hotel company Garden

1519
01:13:23,920 --> 01:13:28,080
hotels that has been working in the

1520
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:31,280
island for more than 30

1521
01:13:28,080 --> 01:13:35,280
years and this man howas begin to think

1522
01:13:31,280 --> 01:13:39,080
okay maybe we can do something

1523
01:13:35,280 --> 01:13:40,600
about waste management and organic

1524
01:13:39,080 --> 01:13:43,960
matter and

1525
01:13:40,600 --> 01:13:47,199
soils so what they did is okay we want

1526
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:48,800
to offer to our customers organic I

1527
01:13:47,199 --> 01:13:51,560
going to pass this video and will give

1528
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:54,199
you later they want to give you to the

1529
01:13:51,560 --> 01:13:55,800
to our customers to our CL clients

1530
01:13:54,199 --> 01:13:57,960
organic products but they have to be

1531
01:13:55,800 --> 01:14:00,480
local we want local organic products and

1532
01:13:57,960 --> 01:14:03,560
they didn't find it in in the market so

1533
01:14:00,480 --> 01:14:05,679
what they did is okay we have we are

1534
01:14:03,560 --> 01:14:08,080
producing more than 100 tons of food

1535
01:14:05,679 --> 01:14:09,199
waste per year in just in one of our one

1536
01:14:08,080 --> 01:14:13,600
of our

1537
01:14:09,199 --> 01:14:16,639
hotels so they take it during one month

1538
01:14:13,600 --> 01:14:19,679
October 2016 we take it to a

1539
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:21,480
farm managed by people as also in risk

1540
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:25,400
of social exclusion we teach them how to

1541
01:14:21,480 --> 01:14:27,719
make compost and during this year that

1542
01:14:25,400 --> 01:14:31,199
the last month of that year they produce

1543
01:14:27,719 --> 01:14:33,040
organic compost that they G gave to the

1544
01:14:31,199 --> 01:14:34,880
association of organic farmers of the

1545
01:14:33,040 --> 01:14:37,320
iseland and with that compost they

1546
01:14:34,880 --> 01:14:39,480
produce organic products for the hotel

1547
01:14:37,320 --> 01:14:41,320
during this this pilot project we take

1548
01:14:39,480 --> 01:14:43,000
them all the politicians all the

1549
01:14:41,320 --> 01:14:44,679
technicians from the local government so

1550
01:14:43,000 --> 01:14:47,040
they can see they can touch they can

1551
01:14:44,679 --> 01:14:51,400
smell they can see that it was possible

1552
01:14:47,040 --> 01:14:56,040
it was real and with that we could begin

1553
01:14:51,400 --> 01:14:58,480
the real project in September 2019 so

1554
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,960
nowadays two of those restaurants and

1555
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,480
the bigger two of these hotels and the

1556
01:15:00,960 --> 01:15:07,440
biggest restaurants in the island the

1557
01:15:03,480 --> 01:15:10,560
hotel collect the food was from those uh

1558
01:15:07,440 --> 01:15:12,880
those places and they take it to a uh

1559
01:15:10,560 --> 01:15:16,360
organic farm in the island that is not

1560
01:15:12,880 --> 01:15:18,040
far that 15 kilometers from the hotels

1561
01:15:16,360 --> 01:15:19,840
and here we have a very small composed

1562
01:15:18,040 --> 01:15:22,840
facility very

1563
01:15:19,840 --> 01:15:25,679
simple we we train the people in the

1564
01:15:22,840 --> 01:15:28,080
farm how to make compost

1565
01:15:25,679 --> 01:15:30,639
and they take all the measure all the

1566
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:32,400
controls we have everything under

1567
01:15:30,639 --> 01:15:34,000
control at every moment to be sure that

1568
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:38,040
they are managed the food waste

1569
01:15:34,000 --> 01:15:40,080
correctly and the farmer gives the hotel

1570
01:15:38,040 --> 01:15:42,400
organic products by the value of the

1571
01:15:40,080 --> 01:15:45,960
organic matter that they receiv there is

1572
01:15:42,400 --> 01:15:48,400
no money exchange here only products the

1573
01:15:45,960 --> 01:15:50,560
farmer receives organic matter and the

1574
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:52,360
farmer gives organic products by the

1575
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:55,440
value of the organic

1576
01:15:52,360 --> 01:15:58,320
matter and until now we have Pro

1577
01:15:55,440 --> 01:16:01,400
processed more than 400 tons of food

1578
01:15:58,320 --> 01:16:05,239
waste in this year and the content in

1579
01:16:01,400 --> 01:16:08,320
contaminants now is around

1580
01:16:05,239 --> 01:16:11,040
0.15% so it's really really good

1581
01:16:08,320 --> 01:16:13,320
material to be processed in this simple

1582
01:16:11,040 --> 01:16:15,560
system the process as I said is

1583
01:16:13,320 --> 01:16:18,360
monitored and all the data are collected

1584
01:16:15,560 --> 01:16:21,040
and uploaded to the cloud so we can see

1585
01:16:18,360 --> 01:16:24,440
immediately what is happening and we

1586
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:27,679
have all the process under control this

1587
01:16:24,440 --> 01:16:29,480
project has received different Awards in

1588
01:16:27,679 --> 01:16:31,239
the in the last year and the hotel is

1589
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:33,600
very happy because at the end this is

1590
01:16:31,239 --> 01:16:36,080
publicity for them so they don't they

1591
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:38,639
don't care for the investment in in the

1592
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:42,440
project because at the end you have the

1593
01:16:38,639 --> 01:16:45,719
the return of a very good image it's

1594
01:16:42,440 --> 01:16:48,880
always in the press and they create jobs

1595
01:16:45,719 --> 01:16:51,320
one of them for people social exclusion

1596
01:16:48,880 --> 01:16:54,400
we have develop some Machinery in the

1597
01:16:51,320 --> 01:16:56,800
island so nowadays they know how to make

1598
01:16:54,400 --> 01:17:00,239
this this kind of machiner that we don't

1599
01:16:56,800 --> 01:17:01,880
have it before and also the hotel create

1600
01:17:00,239 --> 01:17:05,000
a new company for the management of

1601
01:17:01,880 --> 01:17:07,199
green wastage of the iseland to produce

1602
01:17:05,000 --> 01:17:10,639
the bul material that they need for for

1603
01:17:07,199 --> 01:17:12,120
the compost so the main challenge we

1604
01:17:10,639 --> 01:17:13,960
have during this this time was to

1605
01:17:12,120 --> 01:17:16,120
convince the local Administration as

1606
01:17:13,960 --> 01:17:19,239
floran said this one of the challenge

1607
01:17:16,120 --> 01:17:21,000
and one of the specific uh Target of

1608
01:17:19,239 --> 01:17:23,679
this kind of projects they become

1609
01:17:21,000 --> 01:17:26,360
official waste management manager it was

1610
01:17:23,679 --> 01:17:29,760
difficult but they they did it

1611
01:17:26,360 --> 01:17:33,080
now they as I said they know how to

1612
01:17:29,760 --> 01:17:34,719
produce their own bulky material we

1613
01:17:33,080 --> 01:17:38,280
don't have providers for the Machinery

1614
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:40,960
in the island and at the end now we

1615
01:17:38,280 --> 01:17:43,320
can't build it in the island so the

1616
01:17:40,960 --> 01:17:46,280
things are changing now in in baleric

1617
01:17:43,320 --> 01:17:50,040
Islands related to to this kind of

1618
01:17:46,280 --> 01:17:51,560
projects and Ron I just want to flag

1619
01:17:50,040 --> 01:17:54,679
that we just have a few more minutes so

1620
01:17:51,560 --> 01:17:57,400
that we can leave uh time for questions

1621
01:17:54,679 --> 01:18:00,239
okay okay so this was the last example

1622
01:17:57,400 --> 01:18:03,320
this is the in Canary Island and just to

1623
01:18:00,239 --> 01:18:06,239
point you this is an island with a very

1624
01:18:03,320 --> 01:18:09,520
difficult orography high mountains

1625
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:12,840
volcano Etc and all the all the organic

1626
01:18:09,520 --> 01:18:17,080
wastes are were managed here in just one

1627
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:19,120
point of the island and now we perform a

1628
01:18:17,080 --> 01:18:20,760
project where there is a lot of

1629
01:18:19,120 --> 01:18:23,000
decentralized composting all on the

1630
01:18:20,760 --> 01:18:25,040
island and we are planning to use two

1631
01:18:23,000 --> 01:18:27,880
composting facilities that are already

1632
01:18:25,040 --> 01:18:31,960
exist for the treatment of agricultural

1633
01:18:27,880 --> 01:18:35,280
wastage from bananas mainly so they

1634
01:18:31,960 --> 01:18:38,760
can't now include also food WS from

1635
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:41,800
local uh Village local small village and

1636
01:18:38,760 --> 01:18:44,679
towns in the area so this one of the

1637
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:48,280
projects we we are working with to

1638
01:18:44,679 --> 01:18:50,080
finish it uh the pro the problems with

1639
01:18:48,280 --> 01:18:51,960
the with this model is that there is not

1640
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,880
a specific regulation in Spain for this

1641
01:18:51,960 --> 01:18:57,840
scale so it depends of the

1642
01:18:53,880 --> 01:19:00,560
interpretation for every uh responsible

1643
01:18:57,840 --> 01:19:03,400
from the technical of the public

1644
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:05,840
administration uh only in Nar they

1645
01:19:03,400 --> 01:19:08,440
perform uh because of the project of

1646
01:19:05,840 --> 01:19:10,760
HOSA they develop a first regulation

1647
01:19:08,440 --> 01:19:13,159
that is based in administrative and

1648
01:19:10,760 --> 01:19:17,159
Technical conditions okay you have it

1649
01:19:13,159 --> 01:19:19,000
here so we make it simple to to can

1650
01:19:17,159 --> 01:19:22,440
build and perform this

1651
01:19:19,000 --> 01:19:24,760
facilities our main problem here is the

1652
01:19:22,440 --> 01:19:25,480
quality of the food waste because in

1653
01:19:24,760 --> 01:19:28,360
some

1654
01:19:25,480 --> 01:19:30,639
cases we don't know who's going to

1655
01:19:28,360 --> 01:19:33,960
control the food waste that the facility

1656
01:19:30,639 --> 01:19:36,000
receives and who's going to pay if the

1657
01:19:33,960 --> 01:19:38,639
farmer has to invest more money or more

1658
01:19:36,000 --> 01:19:40,960
equipment and have a a loss of the

1659
01:19:38,639 --> 01:19:43,120
quality of the compost so here this is a

1660
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:44,679
problem now in Spain when we try to

1661
01:19:43,120 --> 01:19:47,600
promote this kind of

1662
01:19:44,679 --> 01:19:48,800
models and the need of professional

1663
01:19:47,600 --> 01:19:52,159
Technical

1664
01:19:48,800 --> 01:19:54,719
Training that it is essential as as

1665
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:56,360
floran previously said okay we know that

1666
01:19:54,719 --> 01:19:59,719
Farmers know about composting but this

1667
01:19:56,360 --> 01:20:02,199
is a little bit different and more

1668
01:19:59,719 --> 01:20:05,239
intense supervision external Technical

1669
01:20:02,199 --> 01:20:08,040
Support also Florian explain it about it

1670
01:20:05,239 --> 01:20:10,360
this here is a very a research group in

1671
01:20:08,040 --> 01:20:13,480
the University of

1672
01:20:10,360 --> 01:20:15,639
uh of Miguel Hernandez in in Valencia

1673
01:20:13,480 --> 01:20:18,120
that they are doing a very amazing job

1674
01:20:15,639 --> 01:20:21,880
work about it the training and the

1675
01:20:18,120 --> 01:20:24,440
giving assistance to the farmers and to

1676
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:26,120
guarantee that the process is all the

1677
01:20:24,440 --> 01:20:29,120
proc the service is given during the

1678
01:20:26,120 --> 01:20:31,320
world year so this is also one of the

1679
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:34,040
cons that the model has so it is

1680
01:20:31,320 --> 01:20:36,120
important to consider it finally just to

1681
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:39,280
commment that it's important that the

1682
01:20:36,120 --> 01:20:43,239
Ora sector can be the all the best

1683
01:20:39,280 --> 01:20:45,440
allies restaurants hotels censes

1684
01:20:43,239 --> 01:20:47,719
cafeterias they create they generate a

1685
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:50,040
lot of food waste and very clean food

1686
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:53,360
waste so it's very easy to transform

1687
01:20:50,040 --> 01:20:56,560
into a compost in a local

1688
01:20:53,360 --> 01:20:59,760
model so as I said this is the key

1689
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,960
aspect for for the model at least here

1690
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:04,520
at this moment in Spain there specific

1691
01:21:01,960 --> 01:21:06,320
regulation that we missed the guarantees

1692
01:21:04,520 --> 01:21:08,760
of the quality of the food waste the

1693
01:21:06,320 --> 01:21:12,000
Technical Training technical support

1694
01:21:08,760 --> 01:21:13,679
external support service guarantees and

1695
01:21:12,000 --> 01:21:17,600
the synergies that we can create with

1696
01:21:13,679 --> 01:21:19,960
Rea sector just to finish uh our

1697
01:21:17,600 --> 01:21:22,679
association that's called ferti AO has

1698
01:21:19,960 --> 01:21:26,280
create that developed h a community

1699
01:21:22,679 --> 01:21:30,280
composting uh guide a handbook to

1700
01:21:26,280 --> 01:21:31,960
promote the model and it has been

1701
01:21:30,280 --> 01:21:35,199
translated to different language it is

1702
01:21:31,960 --> 01:21:38,040
in English if you want it and also to

1703
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:41,480
the to Bolivia and other

1704
01:21:38,040 --> 01:21:44,440
areas we also perform as a friend said

1705
01:21:41,480 --> 01:21:46,679
training courses just for looking for

1706
01:21:44,440 --> 01:21:49,800
that so farmers and other people could

1707
01:21:46,679 --> 01:21:52,000
be trained and also those kind of Tours

1708
01:21:49,800 --> 01:21:54,280
to show people to show politician

1709
01:21:52,000 --> 01:21:56,719
technicians for other countries and also

1710
01:21:54,280 --> 01:22:00,159
other part of Spain that those models

1711
01:21:56,719 --> 01:22:03,800
are are a reality but what they need to

1712
01:22:00,159 --> 01:22:05,840
do what they need to know to take them

1713
01:22:03,800 --> 01:22:10,360
to their countries to their to the

1714
01:22:05,840 --> 01:22:12,960
regions and to really implement it so

1715
01:22:10,360 --> 01:22:15,320
that's all and sorry if I took longer

1716
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:17,000
that I I thought but I hope it would be

1717
01:22:15,320 --> 01:22:19,199
interesting for you thank you very much

1718
01:22:17,000 --> 01:22:21,840
for your attention and any questions

1719
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:24,760
here you have me fabulous that was a

1720
01:22:21,840 --> 01:22:27,040
great presentation thank you Ramon um

1721
01:22:24,760 --> 01:22:31,520
and so now we're going to move into uh

1722
01:22:27,040 --> 01:22:32,440
questions and answers and uh I just love

1723
01:22:31,520 --> 01:22:37,199
the

1724
01:22:32,440 --> 01:22:40,000
combination of um your

1725
01:22:37,199 --> 01:22:42,080
presentations um I think the gold

1726
01:22:40,000 --> 01:22:44,560
standard in Austria what this could look

1727
01:22:42,080 --> 01:22:45,840
like and I love uh seeing in Spain which

1728
01:22:44,560 --> 01:22:48,679
I think is probably more similar to

1729
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:51,280
where we are in the United States of of

1730
01:22:48,679 --> 01:22:53,400
something a little bit uh where we're

1731
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:56,040
still striving for that gold standard so

1732
01:22:53,400 --> 01:22:59,000
thank you for for that and uh I loved

1733
01:22:56,040 --> 01:23:02,719
seeing the I think your presentations

1734
01:22:59,000 --> 01:23:05,159
both clearly Illustrated the benefits of

1735
01:23:02,719 --> 01:23:07,320
community scaled composting solutions

1736
01:23:05,159 --> 01:23:09,639
that can really be adapted to the local

1737
01:23:07,320 --> 01:23:11,600
conditions and local challenges and

1738
01:23:09,639 --> 01:23:13,360
local communities but also some of the

1739
01:23:11,600 --> 01:23:17,960
considerations and challenges at that

1740
01:23:13,360 --> 01:23:20,239
scale and the importance of um support

1741
01:23:17,960 --> 01:23:23,560
um for the farmer

1742
01:23:20,239 --> 01:23:25,880
for uh in you know implementing the

1743
01:23:23,560 --> 01:23:27,920
composting but then also for uh

1744
01:23:25,880 --> 01:23:30,360
educating the community on how to

1745
01:23:27,920 --> 01:23:32,040
participate so uh such great

1746
01:23:30,360 --> 01:23:33,760
presentations uh one of the questions

1747
01:23:32,040 --> 01:23:36,760
that I think we could posee to both of

1748
01:23:33,760 --> 01:23:38,560
you um you both mentioned the importance

1749
01:23:36,760 --> 01:23:41,960
of

1750
01:23:38,560 --> 01:23:44,679
um contamination or just the needing a

1751
01:23:41,960 --> 01:23:48,840
clean stream that will be composted at

1752
01:23:44,679 --> 01:23:50,480
this scale and uh the question from

1753
01:23:48,840 --> 01:23:51,960
participant was what is an acceptable

1754
01:23:50,480 --> 01:23:55,920
amount of

1755
01:23:51,960 --> 01:23:58,880
contamination and uh for

1756
01:23:55,920 --> 01:24:01,199
customers or people uh submitting their

1757
01:23:58,880 --> 01:24:03,600
uh food scraps to be composed in these

1758
01:24:01,199 --> 01:24:04,800
projects uh what are the consequences if

1759
01:24:03,600 --> 01:24:07,560
they

1760
01:24:04,800 --> 01:24:12,159
exceed the

1761
01:24:07,560 --> 01:24:15,600
limits so can you hear me yes yes very

1762
01:24:12,159 --> 01:24:18,159
good so uh if you allow I can uh start

1763
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:21,199
with that because we have after now 30

1764
01:24:18,159 --> 01:24:25,199
years of experience again a very big

1765
01:24:21,199 --> 01:24:29,600
discussion there um we are going to

1766
01:24:25,199 --> 01:24:35,840
implement a a minimum requirements so a

1767
01:24:29,600 --> 01:24:36,920
limit with um 2% by weight of impurities

1768
01:24:35,840 --> 01:24:39,880
of

1769
01:24:36,920 --> 01:24:42,480
contaminants uh that is allowed to enter

1770
01:24:39,880 --> 01:24:47,000
the composting heat and there is another

1771
01:24:42,480 --> 01:24:48,480
threshold that they consider now 5% by

1772
01:24:47,000 --> 01:24:51,360
by

1773
01:24:48,480 --> 01:24:54,880
weight um that can enter the composting

1774
01:24:51,360 --> 01:24:58,600
facility but then you have to introduce

1775
01:24:54,880 --> 01:25:02,400
a purification separation equipment yeah

1776
01:24:58,600 --> 01:25:04,000
to take the impurities out but

1777
01:25:02,400 --> 01:25:06,880
there's

1778
01:25:04,000 --> 01:25:12,040
actually who will pay for it who will

1779
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:15,000
analyze it if it's 5.2 or 2.3 or

1780
01:25:12,040 --> 01:25:18,239
whatever uh so it's it's really tricky

1781
01:25:15,000 --> 01:25:20,760
so the only thing you can do you can you

1782
01:25:18,239 --> 01:25:25,199
you um and that what was very very

1783
01:25:20,760 --> 01:25:29,040
successful in our case is to uh achieve

1784
01:25:25,199 --> 01:25:30,840
the commitment by the by the entities

1785
01:25:29,040 --> 01:25:33,239
who are responsible for the collection

1786
01:25:30,840 --> 01:25:35,960
that might be in the municipality that

1787
01:25:33,239 --> 01:25:38,000
might be the intercommunity association

1788
01:25:35,960 --> 01:25:40,520
so the waste management

1789
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,719
association of a number of

1790
01:25:40,520 --> 01:25:44,679
municipalities that might be a private

1791
01:25:42,719 --> 01:25:46,960
company but at the end the private

1792
01:25:44,679 --> 01:25:49,920
company is contracted by the

1793
01:25:46,960 --> 01:25:52,360
municipality or by a local Authority and

1794
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:55,119
in the bylaws of the contract it must be

1795
01:25:52,360 --> 01:25:58,600
clearly stated that they have to take

1796
01:25:55,119 --> 01:26:01,719
into account take care about the proper

1797
01:25:58,600 --> 01:26:04,480
education and the control of the bins

1798
01:26:01,719 --> 01:26:08,800
they collect so they have to Pro provide

1799
01:26:04,480 --> 01:26:11,360
a system how they do the controlling and

1800
01:26:08,800 --> 01:26:13,199
the communication about the Purity and

1801
01:26:11,360 --> 01:26:16,520
the quality of the feed stalker and the

1802
01:26:13,199 --> 01:26:20,000
food waste they collect and I think this

1803
01:26:16,520 --> 01:26:23,679
again starts with a very intensive

1804
01:26:20,000 --> 01:26:26,400
corporate um um communication and

1805
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:30,080
identif ation with the system and then

1806
01:26:26,400 --> 01:26:32,080
you might succeed um you ask for the

1807
01:26:30,080 --> 01:26:34,800
threshold that would be acceptable at

1808
01:26:32,080 --> 01:26:38,560
the end I'm telling you it's

1809
01:26:34,800 --> 01:26:41,600
1% it's 1% we we shouldn't be shamed to

1810
01:26:38,560 --> 01:26:45,199
be quite stringent and very clear about

1811
01:26:41,600 --> 01:26:47,800
it because 5% which you will find in

1812
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:49,800
some of the areas in in in the big

1813
01:26:47,800 --> 01:26:52,520
cities for instance it look it looks

1814
01:26:49,800 --> 01:26:58,639
like hell because it's mainly plastic

1815
01:26:52,520 --> 01:27:01,000
and 5% by by uh by weight is uh even in

1816
01:26:58,639 --> 01:27:04,760
the final product you will have these

1817
01:27:01,000 --> 01:27:09,360
fine plastic pieces which are uh end up

1818
01:27:04,760 --> 01:27:09,360
in microplastic which is the big debate

1819
01:27:10,920 --> 01:27:16,199
today yeah I absolutely agree with with

1820
01:27:13,560 --> 01:27:17,960
Florian more than 2% becomes a problem

1821
01:27:16,199 --> 01:27:21,520
in in this kind of facilities with so

1822
01:27:17,960 --> 01:27:24,239
simple because if not you have to invest

1823
01:27:21,520 --> 01:27:26,880
in equipments or you have to invest in

1824
01:27:24,239 --> 01:27:29,840
time of your of your workers open the

1825
01:27:26,880 --> 01:27:32,360
bags by hand taking out the Plastics so

1826
01:27:29,840 --> 01:27:33,719
it's at the end that's impossible it

1827
01:27:32,360 --> 01:27:35,000
means that you have to invest a lot of

1828
01:27:33,719 --> 01:27:39,880
money for the

1829
01:27:35,000 --> 01:27:44,080
Management Facility as F said less than

1830
01:27:39,880 --> 01:27:46,320
1% is the objective here buet here the

1831
01:27:44,080 --> 01:27:48,440
problem of course is at the end who is

1832
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:51,199
responsible for those qualities so

1833
01:27:48,440 --> 01:27:53,400
that's what I said at the beginning the

1834
01:27:51,199 --> 01:27:55,719
Ora sector the hotels restaurants

1835
01:27:53,400 --> 01:27:58,159
something like that very very easy quite

1836
01:27:55,719 --> 01:28:00,520
easy to have it under control to teach

1837
01:27:58,159 --> 01:28:03,400
the people in the kitchen in the Halls

1838
01:28:00,520 --> 01:28:05,520
how they have to separate the food then

1839
01:28:03,400 --> 01:28:07,600
it's very easy to have a important

1840
01:28:05,520 --> 01:28:10,600
quantity of food waste that is almost

1841
01:28:07,600 --> 01:28:14,080
completely clean so I'm begin with that

1842
01:28:10,600 --> 01:28:16,280
and then begin to train to to raise the

1843
01:28:14,080 --> 01:28:18,560
awareness of the people of the citizens

1844
01:28:16,280 --> 01:28:20,639
of the politicians of the local

1845
01:28:18,560 --> 01:28:23,480
administration of of the importance of

1846
01:28:20,639 --> 01:28:27,040
the of the separation on source and then

1847
01:28:23,480 --> 01:28:29,360
you can go you can try to get a a b a

1848
01:28:27,040 --> 01:28:32,280
good quality food waste and then you can

1849
01:28:29,360 --> 01:28:35,520
think okay now I can I can extend the

1850
01:28:32,280 --> 01:28:40,119
model to more facilities or to do this

1851
01:28:35,520 --> 01:28:42,639
facility a bit a little bit higher

1852
01:28:40,119 --> 01:28:47,040
bigger yes great answers uh the

1853
01:28:42,639 --> 01:28:49,560
importance of of models uh Pilots that

1854
01:28:47,040 --> 01:28:52,719
that can be scaled up uh once the

1855
01:28:49,560 --> 01:28:54,520
systems are dialed in um so I'm just

1856
01:28:52,719 --> 01:28:57,119
flagging that it's almost 13 I'm

1857
01:28:54,520 --> 01:28:58,600
wondering if you uh Ramon and floran

1858
01:28:57,119 --> 01:29:00,400
would be willing to stay on for just a

1859
01:28:58,600 --> 01:29:04,080
few more minutes to answer some more

1860
01:29:00,400 --> 01:29:08,040
questions yes definitely no problem

1861
01:29:04,080 --> 01:29:10,880
fabulous okay so uh one question uh

1862
01:29:08,040 --> 01:29:14,719
directed at you Florian I think was for

1863
01:29:10,880 --> 01:29:17,560
an urban area um did you in your the

1864
01:29:14,719 --> 01:29:19,920
examp one of the examples you gave uh

1865
01:29:17,560 --> 01:29:22,840
was the

1866
01:29:19,920 --> 01:29:25,360
material sort of collected at a central

1867
01:29:22,840 --> 01:29:27,920
area where contamin was removed and then

1868
01:29:25,360 --> 01:29:30,920
it was sent on to Farmers who would

1869
01:29:27,920 --> 01:29:34,280
compost it or are there also examples

1870
01:29:30,920 --> 01:29:34,280
where the farmers have to

1871
01:29:34,360 --> 01:29:39,199
decontaminate but it's always both

1872
01:29:36,920 --> 01:29:42,719
because the decontamination in a central

1873
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:44,760
facility in the city is

1874
01:29:42,719 --> 01:29:48,320
uh never

1875
01:29:44,760 --> 01:29:50,480
complete yeah so um so if you collect

1876
01:29:48,320 --> 01:29:52,800
from a city we have the problem that we

1877
01:29:50,480 --> 01:29:55,080
might be in the range of 2% and then

1878
01:29:52,800 --> 01:29:57,800
they have some screening and some

1879
01:29:55,080 --> 01:30:01,520
separation by Ballistic separation and

1880
01:29:57,800 --> 01:30:05,760
Separation by wind sifter by Separation

1881
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:10,239
by a magnetic separator etc etc uh but

1882
01:30:05,760 --> 01:30:13,080
at the end um we had those problems that

1883
01:30:10,239 --> 01:30:16,040
the mixed and prepared feed stock

1884
01:30:13,080 --> 01:30:18,600
delivered to the farmers still was quite

1885
01:30:16,040 --> 01:30:21,760
contaminated but this is also due to the

1886
01:30:18,600 --> 01:30:24,760
fact that there was not a much not

1887
01:30:21,760 --> 01:30:27,920
enough commitment by this City by the

1888
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:31,280
municipality and its co-workers to do

1889
01:30:27,920 --> 01:30:35,199
more about education work to the

1890
01:30:31,280 --> 01:30:36,679
household and to to put more effort uh

1891
01:30:35,199 --> 01:30:39,960
even even in the in the cleaning and

1892
01:30:36,679 --> 01:30:42,040
purification and separation activities

1893
01:30:39,960 --> 01:30:44,199
but at the end it was the it is the

1894
01:30:42,040 --> 01:30:47,840
responsibility of the central of the

1895
01:30:44,199 --> 01:30:51,440
municipality and the facility to deliver

1896
01:30:47,840 --> 01:30:52,920
uh a well well prepared uh raw fit stock

1897
01:30:51,440 --> 01:30:55,639
mix to the

1898
01:30:52,920 --> 01:30:57,400
farmers

1899
01:30:55,639 --> 01:31:01,280
great thank you for that

1900
01:30:57,400 --> 01:31:03,040
clarification now question for youon um

1901
01:31:01,280 --> 01:31:06,639
someone asked is there any competition

1902
01:31:03,040 --> 01:31:08,840
between composters and pig Farmers or

1903
01:31:06,639 --> 01:31:11,840
other animal Farmers I suppose to

1904
01:31:08,840 --> 01:31:15,080
participate in the composting

1905
01:31:11,840 --> 01:31:19,560
model models that you mentioned

1906
01:31:15,080 --> 01:31:22,679
unfortunately not uh it's really hard to

1907
01:31:19,560 --> 01:31:24,719
find uh some farmers at this moment that

1908
01:31:22,679 --> 01:31:27,639
they want to be bor in this kind of in

1909
01:31:24,719 --> 01:31:29,480
this kind of models we have found in in

1910
01:31:27,639 --> 01:31:31,960
some cases that they they really want

1911
01:31:29,480 --> 01:31:34,000
the compost but when you say okay but

1912
01:31:31,960 --> 01:31:35,480
you have to do it by yourself and we are

1913
01:31:34,000 --> 01:31:38,199
you are going to collect or you are

1914
01:31:35,480 --> 01:31:39,639
going to receive the the food waste and

1915
01:31:38,199 --> 01:31:41,920
then you have to transform it into

1916
01:31:39,639 --> 01:31:45,920
compost and they say no no no it's I

1917
01:31:41,920 --> 01:31:48,679
don't have time it's more complicated uh

1918
01:31:45,920 --> 01:31:50,080
it's going to be uh I have I'm going to

1919
01:31:48,679 --> 01:31:52,520
have a lot of controls from the

1920
01:31:50,080 --> 01:31:56,000
administration I don't want to to have

1921
01:31:52,520 --> 01:31:59,080
problems and at this moment for example

1922
01:31:56,000 --> 01:32:01,080
in in Pedra in that province that I said

1923
01:31:59,080 --> 01:32:03,840
they have a very intense program in in

1924
01:32:01,080 --> 01:32:06,800
community composting now the C the

1925
01:32:03,840 --> 01:32:10,760
provincial government has developed a

1926
01:32:06,800 --> 01:32:14,040
project uh to uh give uh some kind of

1927
01:32:10,760 --> 01:32:17,159
Health economical healths to any uh

1928
01:32:14,040 --> 01:32:19,679
farmer or Association of farmers that

1929
01:32:17,159 --> 01:32:22,840
were that will that could will to

1930
01:32:19,679 --> 01:32:24,440
collect or receive organic waste from

1931
01:32:22,840 --> 01:32:28,040
municipalities

1932
01:32:24,440 --> 01:32:30,400
around them so they want to to to give

1933
01:32:28,040 --> 01:32:33,560
money for the investment in the facility

1934
01:32:30,400 --> 01:32:35,480
or in the collection system and try to

1935
01:32:33,560 --> 01:32:38,199
promote this model because they they

1936
01:32:35,480 --> 01:32:42,000
tried it years ago and they didn't find

1937
01:32:38,199 --> 01:32:44,440
any farmer interested in that so it's

1938
01:32:42,000 --> 01:32:48,639
difficult hearing most of the farmers

1939
01:32:44,440 --> 01:32:50,199
are are still related to the mineral

1940
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:52,920
fertilizers

1941
01:32:50,199 --> 01:32:55,880
and it's now it's this year with the

1942
01:32:52,920 --> 01:32:59,280
crisis in in energy crisis with

1943
01:32:55,880 --> 01:33:01,440
a tremendous rise of the cost of the

1944
01:32:59,280 --> 01:33:04,320
fertilizers that a lot of them now they

1945
01:33:01,440 --> 01:33:07,520
are looking for organic fertilizers and

1946
01:33:04,320 --> 01:33:08,520
they try to to find other sources but

1947
01:33:07,520 --> 01:33:12,639
until

1948
01:33:08,520 --> 01:33:15,719
now you you have to to take a lot of

1949
01:33:12,639 --> 01:33:19,199
time to to knock a lot of doors to find

1950
01:33:15,719 --> 01:33:25,239
fness that could be interested in the

1951
01:33:19,199 --> 01:33:29,040
M yes uh the the current crisis um

1952
01:33:25,239 --> 01:33:32,560
with uh prices of a lot of Commodities

1953
01:33:29,040 --> 01:33:35,600
but including um fertilizers is uh

1954
01:33:32,560 --> 01:33:37,520
something we feel even here in the US um

1955
01:33:35,600 --> 01:33:40,760
it's very important but hopefully it

1956
01:33:37,520 --> 01:33:44,360
also brings us back to the importance of

1957
01:33:40,760 --> 01:33:46,800
um and opportunities with um compost as

1958
01:33:44,360 --> 01:33:50,320
uh an amendment that can also reduce the

1959
01:33:46,800 --> 01:33:55,719
need for uh fertilizers synthetic

1960
01:33:50,320 --> 01:33:55,719
fertilizers it's a great Point um so

1961
01:33:57,600 --> 01:34:07,880
a question that this also leads me to is

1962
01:34:03,320 --> 01:34:11,280
um how do you balance supporting Farmers

1963
01:34:07,880 --> 01:34:14,560
to to get involved with this without

1964
01:34:11,280 --> 01:34:18,080
making it feel like they're being forced

1965
01:34:14,560 --> 01:34:21,960
or um by putting too much of the onus

1966
01:34:18,080 --> 01:34:24,440
of uh the responsibility of managing all

1967
01:34:21,960 --> 01:34:27,400
of the different pieces

1968
01:34:24,440 --> 01:34:29,239
of collecting the waste and processing

1969
01:34:27,400 --> 01:34:32,600
the waste and then Distributing the

1970
01:34:29,239 --> 01:34:36,080
compost at the end uh maybe this is

1971
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:37,520
question more for for uh chor and

1972
01:34:36,080 --> 01:34:38,520
because I think ran you sort of touched

1973
01:34:37,520 --> 01:34:41,280
on it but if you have anything to add

1974
01:34:38,520 --> 01:34:41,280
I'd love to hear from you

1975
01:34:41,560 --> 01:34:49,119
too now the the the key is is a farmer

1976
01:34:46,280 --> 01:34:50,440
really interested in these humus and

1977
01:34:49,119 --> 01:34:54,679
compost

1978
01:34:50,440 --> 01:34:57,840
cycle so um and the second is does he

1979
01:34:54,679 --> 01:35:00,480
has a right location and does he has the

1980
01:34:57,840 --> 01:35:02,920
human resources and some of the

1981
01:35:00,480 --> 01:35:05,679
equipment he can provide and this has

1982
01:35:02,920 --> 01:35:08,560
then to be decided between the

1983
01:35:05,679 --> 01:35:10,920
municipality the respons or the entity

1984
01:35:08,560 --> 01:35:12,480
that is local entity that is responsible

1985
01:35:10,920 --> 01:35:13,719
for the waste collection or the for the

1986
01:35:12,480 --> 01:35:19,400
waste

1987
01:35:13,719 --> 01:35:24,440
management um uh so usually we we have a

1988
01:35:19,400 --> 01:35:26,480
sort of a concour so there is a uh uh

1989
01:35:24,440 --> 01:35:28,719
an article in the local

1990
01:35:26,480 --> 01:35:31,400
newspaper we are looking for a farmer

1991
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:33,880
who is interesting to do the job and

1992
01:35:31,400 --> 01:35:37,159
then there are two or three Farmers

1993
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:41,119
coming up and they are invited and then

1994
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:43,440
we explain them what's coming up so what

1995
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:44,679
would be their Duty and their their task

1996
01:35:43,440 --> 01:35:46,880
it could be

1997
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:50,320
including the separate

1998
01:35:46,880 --> 01:35:52,480
collection collecting part or it's just

1999
01:35:50,320 --> 01:35:54,880
receiving the organic waste that it

2000
01:35:52,480 --> 01:35:56,440
collected by another by the municipality

2001
01:35:54,880 --> 01:35:58,440
or by a collection

2002
01:35:56,440 --> 01:36:01,400
company and

2003
01:35:58,440 --> 01:36:04,920
then he's doing the job of composting

2004
01:36:01,400 --> 01:36:07,360
from from the from the Gate of the

2005
01:36:04,920 --> 01:36:12,000
composting plant down to the marketing

2006
01:36:07,360 --> 01:36:14,679
and everything so it is a side job or an

2007
01:36:12,000 --> 01:36:17,000
additional job he has to become a

2008
01:36:14,679 --> 01:36:18,880
professionalist a professional compost

2009
01:36:17,000 --> 01:36:23,280
producer it's

2010
01:36:18,880 --> 01:36:24,800
nothing that he should do just by you

2011
01:36:23,280 --> 01:36:28,239
know

2012
01:36:24,800 --> 01:36:30,719
um in the late afternoon or in the

2013
01:36:28,239 --> 01:36:32,920
evening it must be clear that he needs

2014
01:36:30,719 --> 01:36:36,080
time for that to maintain the composting

2015
01:36:32,920 --> 01:36:37,960
PL of plant of a professional

2016
01:36:36,080 --> 01:36:40,280
level

2017
01:36:37,960 --> 01:36:46,239
um in that

2018
01:36:40,280 --> 01:36:48,360
case I can say um the key issue there is

2019
01:36:46,239 --> 01:36:49,760
not to find interesting Farmers but to

2020
01:36:48,360 --> 01:36:55,480
find the right

2021
01:36:49,760 --> 01:36:58,920
location and and uh to to sort out to

2022
01:36:55,480 --> 01:37:01,760
identify if the farmer has the capacity

2023
01:36:58,920 --> 01:37:04,560
to do the job in the right way and this

2024
01:37:01,760 --> 01:37:07,840
is a little bit uh an issue that has to

2025
01:37:04,560 --> 01:37:11,119
be taken into account at the beginning

2026
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:14,320
but from that on if this is okay if I

2027
01:37:11,119 --> 01:37:18,760
talk about location the minimum we try

2028
01:37:14,320 --> 01:37:21,960
to achieve is at least 250300

2029
01:37:18,760 --> 01:37:25,440
meter distance from the next uh

2030
01:37:21,960 --> 01:37:28,760
settlement or residential area or

2031
01:37:25,440 --> 01:37:30,239
permanent residence or restaurant or

2032
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:32,800
something like

2033
01:37:30,239 --> 01:37:35,080
that and then the local climate has to

2034
01:37:32,800 --> 01:37:37,560
be taken into account to prevent later

2035
01:37:35,080 --> 01:37:41,480
on you know all the problems and

2036
01:37:37,560 --> 01:37:41,480
complaints by the neighbors and so

2037
01:37:42,320 --> 01:37:49,760
fors if I understood your question

2038
01:37:47,440 --> 01:37:52,239
correctly I think so Ramon do you have

2039
01:37:49,760 --> 01:37:54,199
any insights to

2040
01:37:52,239 --> 01:37:56,599
share uh

2041
01:37:54,199 --> 01:37:59,639
all all the things that Florian said

2042
01:37:56,599 --> 01:38:03,040
absolutely agree with him just to add

2043
01:37:59,639 --> 01:38:05,719
that some cases that we found uh that

2044
01:38:03,040 --> 01:38:07,560
the farmers look for the model or could

2045
01:38:05,719 --> 01:38:10,320
be interested in the model because of

2046
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:12,599
the compost as they said that it's not

2047
01:38:10,320 --> 01:38:15,440
easy to especially those Farmers that

2048
01:38:12,599 --> 01:38:18,520
are looking for organic farming and they

2049
01:38:15,440 --> 01:38:21,639
are performing organic farming they need

2050
01:38:18,520 --> 01:38:24,239
compost and they they here in Spain to

2051
01:38:21,639 --> 01:38:27,040
find a high quality compost that could

2052
01:38:24,239 --> 01:38:29,960
be labeled as organic is not easy the

2053
01:38:27,040 --> 01:38:31,599
the production is quite reduced so if

2054
01:38:29,960 --> 01:38:33,800
they find the opportunity to do it by

2055
01:38:31,599 --> 01:38:35,960
themselves and they they make the

2056
01:38:33,800 --> 01:38:38,560
numbers and they see okay it is possible

2057
01:38:35,960 --> 01:38:42,159
for me then it's a it's a good incentive

2058
01:38:38,560 --> 01:38:45,199
for for them in our

2059
01:38:42,159 --> 01:38:49,520
case yes compost is a a high quality

2060
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:51,560
compost um is not always easy to come by

2061
01:38:49,520 --> 01:38:54,800
you have to consider it is an additional

2062
01:38:51,560 --> 01:38:57,719
income also but have to provide service

2063
01:38:54,800 --> 01:39:00,719
for that income so our gate fee for for

2064
01:38:57,719 --> 01:39:03,440
for taking over uh Organic Kitchen waste

2065
01:39:00,719 --> 01:39:08,080
is in in order to cover all the costs

2066
01:39:03,440 --> 01:39:12,320
including the revenue it's between 50 55

2067
01:39:08,080 --> 01:39:16,639
to 65 Euros per ton and that is needed

2068
01:39:12,320 --> 01:39:19,800
to do a professional job um this refers

2069
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:22,159
to paved and sealed and professional

2070
01:39:19,800 --> 01:39:24,159
composting plants that are constructed

2071
01:39:22,159 --> 01:39:28,199
on a on a on a high level

2072
01:39:24,159 --> 01:39:31,920
um I I forgot to mention that up to 300

2073
01:39:28,199 --> 01:39:34,360
cubic meter uh of green waste only so

2074
01:39:31,920 --> 01:39:36,320
Garden Parkwest only in Austria it is

2075
01:39:34,360 --> 01:39:39,560
allowed to do the composting on open

2076
01:39:36,320 --> 01:39:40,679
ground even the Intensive rotting phase

2077
01:39:39,560 --> 01:39:45,520
the

2078
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:47,920
first I I Tred to increase this uh this

2079
01:39:45,520 --> 01:39:51,639
threshold because we have found even if

2080
01:39:47,920 --> 01:39:53,960
it's 1,000 cubic meters per year uh it

2081
01:39:51,639 --> 01:39:59,040
wouldn't do any harm if you do a

2082
01:39:53,960 --> 01:40:01,880
uh a good job um it could be open ground

2083
01:39:59,040 --> 01:40:04,360
if if you are uh in a certain distance

2084
01:40:01,880 --> 01:40:07,040
from surface water from rivers or

2085
01:40:04,360 --> 01:40:10,520
whatever from a lake and you don't have

2086
01:40:07,040 --> 01:40:13,679
groundwater problems or a nearby well or

2087
01:40:10,520 --> 01:40:17,159
whatever but in normal cases even on

2088
01:40:13,679 --> 01:40:19,880
open ground the ground is capable to

2089
01:40:17,159 --> 01:40:25,320
carry your machines and so forth you can

2090
01:40:19,880 --> 01:40:25,320
do it up to a certain uh quantity

2091
01:40:25,800 --> 01:40:31,000
right okay well um just to get to a

2092
01:40:29,199 --> 01:40:32,560
couple more questions from from the

2093
01:40:31,000 --> 01:40:34,840
audience I would love to continue

2094
01:40:32,560 --> 01:40:37,960
talking about this um but maybe another

2095
01:40:34,840 --> 01:40:41,000
time um just to trying to compare it to

2096
01:40:37,960 --> 01:40:42,119
what I what we're seeing in the US um

2097
01:40:41,000 --> 01:40:45,199
there's just lots of questions that are

2098
01:40:42,119 --> 01:40:49,119
coming up for me but um a question a

2099
01:40:45,199 --> 01:40:52,239
clarification for you uh Ramon was in

2100
01:40:49,119 --> 01:40:55,040
the examples that you gave were are

2101
01:40:52,239 --> 01:40:58,320
there compost coming onto the farm to do

2102
01:40:55,040 --> 01:41:00,880
the composting and the farmers receive

2103
01:40:58,320 --> 01:41:04,520
the compost in the end uh or are the

2104
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:04,520
farmers actually doing the composting

2105
01:41:04,960 --> 01:41:09,760
themselves I don't think I understood

2106
01:41:07,080 --> 01:41:13,080
the question you mean

2107
01:41:09,760 --> 01:41:14,560
they are the farmers in the examples

2108
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:16,000
that you in some of the examples you

2109
01:41:14,560 --> 01:41:17,840
gave are they actually doing the

2110
01:41:16,000 --> 01:41:18,960
composting or is there a separate entity

2111
01:41:17,840 --> 01:41:20,360
that comes in and actually does the

2112
01:41:18,960 --> 01:41:23,760
composting on the

2113
01:41:20,360 --> 01:41:26,920
farm no no they do it but in all cases

2114
01:41:23,760 --> 01:41:29,920
they do it by by by themselves but in

2115
01:41:26,920 --> 01:41:34,239
for example in that with the hotels they

2116
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:36,080
have external support uh by myself and

2117
01:41:34,239 --> 01:41:39,040
and others to teach them and if they

2118
01:41:36,080 --> 01:41:41,119
have any problem or any doubt they just

2119
01:41:39,040 --> 01:41:43,599
immediately pH me or send me an email to

2120
01:41:41,119 --> 01:41:45,320
see it's happening this what I can do

2121
01:41:43,599 --> 01:41:48,199
that that's all but they do it in every

2122
01:41:45,320 --> 01:41:50,800
all those cases they do it by by by

2123
01:41:48,199 --> 01:41:54,440
themselves okay well thank you for that

2124
01:41:50,800 --> 01:41:56,800
clarification um for you for and um

2125
01:41:54,440 --> 01:41:59,119
someone early on in your presentation

2126
01:41:56,800 --> 01:42:02,040
asked if you could clarify the need for

2127
01:41:59,119 --> 01:42:05,760
clay um uh adding clay into the

2128
01:42:02,040 --> 01:42:08,560
composting mix to create stable

2129
01:42:05,760 --> 01:42:09,400
humus yeah this is basic knowledge of

2130
01:42:08,560 --> 01:42:11,840
soil

2131
01:42:09,400 --> 01:42:15,360
formation lecture number

2132
01:42:11,840 --> 01:42:18,000
one that 10,000 years ago when the

2133
01:42:15,360 --> 01:42:22,800
glacier disappeared you have just send

2134
01:42:18,000 --> 01:42:25,960
and grabble and so forth and then uh 100

2135
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:29,480
year 100 Year by 100 year uh the soils

2136
01:42:25,960 --> 01:42:32,719
were formed uh by a combination of

2137
01:42:29,480 --> 01:42:36,239
further degradation and weathering of

2138
01:42:32,719 --> 01:42:39,480
the mineral substance into the small

2139
01:42:36,239 --> 01:42:42,159
small pieces less than two

2140
01:42:39,480 --> 01:42:44,639
micrometer and when it's less than 2

2141
01:42:42,159 --> 01:42:47,920
micrometer in particle size of minerals

2142
01:42:44,639 --> 01:42:50,480
this is secondary minerals clay minerals

2143
01:42:47,920 --> 01:42:53,840
they become

2144
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:57,199
um plastic how you call that

2145
01:42:53,840 --> 01:42:59,960
they can take up water yeah and they are

2146
01:42:57,199 --> 01:43:02,560
performed and constructed in layers and

2147
01:42:59,960 --> 01:43:05,360
they can take up and absorb minerals

2148
01:43:02,560 --> 01:43:08,000
like calcium pottassium and they have

2149
01:43:05,360 --> 01:43:11,760
also um an electric

2150
01:43:08,000 --> 01:43:15,040
load uh in the surface which is negative

2151
01:43:11,760 --> 01:43:17,679
and this combines now not only with

2152
01:43:15,040 --> 01:43:21,679
minerals like calcium magnesium

2153
01:43:17,679 --> 01:43:25,719
potassium Etc but also with degradation

2154
01:43:21,679 --> 01:43:31,280
compounds from the organic breakdown of

2155
01:43:25,719 --> 01:43:34,440
peptides and um um carbohydrates Etc

2156
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:37,520
from assimilate from the plants that are

2157
01:43:34,440 --> 01:43:42,560
micro that are degraded by microbial

2158
01:43:37,520 --> 01:43:47,520
activity and those um micro molecules uh

2159
01:43:42,560 --> 01:43:49,639
also have in their outer layer uh a

2160
01:43:47,520 --> 01:43:53,639
positive

2161
01:43:49,639 --> 01:43:57,960
loading and this is connected now with

2162
01:43:53,639 --> 01:44:00,840
the surface of these uh secondary clay

2163
01:43:57,960 --> 01:44:04,360
minerals and they build a protection

2164
01:44:00,840 --> 01:44:06,840
layer around these we call it humi

2165
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:09,159
compounds that we don't know exactly

2166
01:44:06,840 --> 01:44:13,480
what it is chemically speaking we we

2167
01:44:09,159 --> 01:44:15,040
have a guess yeah in our in in in our

2168
01:44:13,480 --> 01:44:18,360
workbooks

2169
01:44:15,040 --> 01:44:21,080
yeah um but at the end this clay

2170
01:44:18,360 --> 01:44:23,639
compound is very very important to

2171
01:44:21,080 --> 01:44:27,000
stabilize the

2172
01:44:23,639 --> 01:44:31,040
partly degraded and stabilized organic

2173
01:44:27,000 --> 01:44:33,199
um compounds from microbial

2174
01:44:31,040 --> 01:44:35,679
decomposition and this is this is the

2175
01:44:33,199 --> 01:44:38,199
basic knowledge and it is not taken into

2176
01:44:35,679 --> 01:44:41,599
account because of costs so big

2177
01:44:38,199 --> 01:44:44,760
facilities consider if they have to add

2178
01:44:41,599 --> 01:44:48,599
I don't know 10% by volume or by weight

2179
01:44:44,760 --> 01:44:51,599
what take what you want of clay clay

2180
01:44:48,599 --> 01:44:54,360
soil into the composting process this is

2181
01:44:51,599 --> 01:44:57,960
a lot of effort the need additional

2182
01:44:54,360 --> 01:45:00,400
storage uh area and this costs money but

2183
01:44:57,960 --> 01:45:04,400
at the end the stability and the quality

2184
01:45:00,400 --> 01:45:07,520
of the humus compound they produce is

2185
01:45:04,400 --> 01:45:12,639
less and this is a lesson we learned

2186
01:45:07,520 --> 01:45:16,119
from basic soil formation lectures

2187
01:45:12,639 --> 01:45:19,639
yeah thank you for that that was that

2188
01:45:16,119 --> 01:45:22,119
was taught uh by the pioneers of

2189
01:45:19,639 --> 01:45:23,560
composting in the 1950s already but it

2190
01:45:22,119 --> 01:45:28,040
was forgotten

2191
01:45:23,560 --> 01:45:30,639
most a long time yes it wasn't until I

2192
01:45:28,040 --> 01:45:32,679
had the opportunity to study with uh

2193
01:45:30,639 --> 01:45:34,960
some composters in Austria a few years

2194
01:45:32,679 --> 01:45:39,639
ago that I I heard of uh clay being

2195
01:45:34,960 --> 01:45:42,560
added so um hopefully we were are res

2196
01:45:39,639 --> 01:45:46,639
sharing some forgotten knowledge there

2197
01:45:42,560 --> 01:45:48,960
um so a final question for both of you

2198
01:45:46,639 --> 01:45:51,400
um and I'm going to make it a two-part

2199
01:45:48,960 --> 01:45:53,000
question um someone commented that it's

2200
01:45:51,400 --> 01:45:56,119
great that restaurants and hotels are

2201
01:45:53,000 --> 01:45:58,719
getting involved um in these efforts are

2202
01:45:56,119 --> 01:46:01,520
there grocery stores uh getting involved

2203
01:45:58,719 --> 01:46:03,880
too and are you aware of any examples

2204
01:46:01,520 --> 01:46:08,360
that use uh vermic

2205
01:46:03,880 --> 01:46:08,360
composting uh as the processing

2206
01:46:09,639 --> 01:46:15,440
technique is the stores in the first

2207
01:46:12,040 --> 01:46:17,760
example that I I use in those that we

2208
01:46:15,440 --> 01:46:19,920
the bers here in Spain yes they are

2209
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,239
they're taking some organic wastage from

2210
01:46:19,920 --> 01:46:24,320
food wastage from groceries stores so

2211
01:46:22,239 --> 01:46:27,239
it's it's also possible it's that kind

2212
01:46:24,320 --> 01:46:30,639
of generators that could be really

2213
01:46:27,239 --> 01:46:32,040
welcome in this kind of of models as I

2214
01:46:30,639 --> 01:46:33,880
said the same that hotels and

2215
01:46:32,040 --> 01:46:37,560
restaurants it's quite easy to separate

2216
01:46:33,880 --> 01:46:40,920
it and have a good quality and with bmit

2217
01:46:37,560 --> 01:46:43,719
composting some for example the that

2218
01:46:40,920 --> 01:46:45,760
project in maor the end of the mation

2219
01:46:43,719 --> 01:46:47,840
process they do it with worms so they

2220
01:46:45,760 --> 01:46:51,599
perform ver composting at the end but

2221
01:46:47,840 --> 01:46:54,440
just for mation not at the beginning and

2222
01:46:51,599 --> 01:46:58,440
uh now we are working also in in another

2223
01:46:54,440 --> 01:47:00,880
facility Al very small that will part of

2224
01:46:58,440 --> 01:47:04,360
it will be the the production of of ver

2225
01:47:00,880 --> 01:47:07,840
compost so it's it's been really really

2226
01:47:04,360 --> 01:47:09,599
possible but it's much better to be sure

2227
01:47:07,840 --> 01:47:12,159
that everything is under controll you do

2228
01:47:09,599 --> 01:47:14,679
it after at least after the fermentation

2229
01:47:12,159 --> 01:47:19,159
stage of the composting

2230
01:47:14,679 --> 01:47:21,719
process that makes sense foran uh any uh

2231
01:47:19,159 --> 01:47:25,239
examples of either grocery stores being

2232
01:47:21,719 --> 01:47:26,520
involved uh um I assume they must be um

2233
01:47:25,239 --> 01:47:28,920
and then if You' know of any vermic

2234
01:47:26,520 --> 01:47:31,199
composting that's happening in

2235
01:47:28,920 --> 01:47:34,159
Austria you also the groceries

2236
01:47:31,199 --> 01:47:36,320
supermarkets Etc obliged to provide

2237
01:47:34,159 --> 01:47:39,560
separate collection usually they

2238
01:47:36,320 --> 01:47:43,639
contract a professional collection

2239
01:47:39,560 --> 01:47:46,000
company um so it's depends on the size

2240
01:47:43,639 --> 01:47:49,199
of the village and the groceries Etc if

2241
01:47:46,000 --> 01:47:51,679
they are involved in the uh agricultural

2242
01:47:49,199 --> 01:47:54,119
composting scheme where also the farmers

2243
01:47:51,679 --> 01:47:57,360
do the collection well they're involved

2244
01:47:54,119 --> 01:47:59,239
partly with these on Farm composting but

2245
01:47:57,360 --> 01:48:02,719
for the for the bigger Supermarket

2246
01:47:59,239 --> 01:48:06,000
chains I would say not so much but we

2247
01:48:02,719 --> 01:48:08,400
have big composting plants of course

2248
01:48:06,000 --> 01:48:12,159
that are run by Farmers up to 15 to

2249
01:48:08,400 --> 01:48:13,599
20,000 tons per year uh they they're not

2250
01:48:12,159 --> 01:48:16,080
providing the collection but they

2251
01:48:13,599 --> 01:48:18,520
receive if the grocery are involved in

2252
01:48:16,080 --> 01:48:20,360
the general separate collection scheme

2253
01:48:18,520 --> 01:48:23,599
run by the

2254
01:48:20,360 --> 01:48:26,520
municipality uh then

2255
01:48:23,599 --> 01:48:29,520
they have to implement the S separation

2256
01:48:26,520 --> 01:48:31,960
for the Organics and then it is included

2257
01:48:29,520 --> 01:48:34,280
also and V

2258
01:48:31,960 --> 01:48:36,639
composting there is only one

2259
01:48:34,280 --> 01:48:40,040
professional example and this

2260
01:48:36,639 --> 01:48:43,880
facility uh does uh exactly as Ramon

2261
01:48:40,040 --> 01:48:47,639
said a a maturation phase more or less

2262
01:48:43,880 --> 01:48:51,480
we could say so after uh I think it it's

2263
01:48:47,639 --> 01:48:55,040
six weeks of intensive high temperature

2264
01:48:51,480 --> 01:48:58,080
composting phase composting phase but

2265
01:48:55,040 --> 01:49:04,800
is uh in this case

2266
01:48:58,080 --> 01:49:08,440
only uh um uh green manure so means

2267
01:49:04,800 --> 01:49:13,159
grass clippings and alpha alpha Etc from

2268
01:49:08,440 --> 01:49:15,800
the farm manure and green waste so

2269
01:49:13,159 --> 01:49:18,880
garden and park waste is composted

2270
01:49:15,800 --> 01:49:20,719
without kitchen waste and that is then

2271
01:49:18,880 --> 01:49:25,159
fed to a very

2272
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:26,840
professional um wormy Farm Compost Farm

2273
01:49:25,159 --> 01:49:31,119
with automatic

2274
01:49:26,840 --> 01:49:34,800
harvesting uh the the the the

2275
01:49:31,119 --> 01:49:36,639
warm uh the war compost and so forth I'm

2276
01:49:34,800 --> 01:49:39,679
teaching it for home composting

2277
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:42,239
intensively in a very simple way because

2278
01:49:39,679 --> 01:49:44,440
with warm composting there's nearly no

2279
01:49:42,239 --> 01:49:45,599
need for turning if you do it in the

2280
01:49:44,440 --> 01:49:50,080
right

2281
01:49:45,599 --> 01:49:52,840
way um it can be done very simple with a

2282
01:49:50,080 --> 01:49:56,280
very simple performance with a simple

2283
01:49:52,840 --> 01:49:59,679
similar equipment as Ramon showed it

2284
01:49:56,280 --> 01:50:01,800
from from the compost boxes from the

2285
01:49:59,679 --> 01:50:04,599
community composting facilities just a

2286
01:50:01,800 --> 01:50:07,320
little box put a little bit on the top

2287
01:50:04,599 --> 01:50:09,199
and let the WMS do the job and in 10

2288
01:50:07,320 --> 01:50:11,320
days you don't see anything anymore from

2289
01:50:09,199 --> 01:50:15,800
the kitchen

2290
01:50:11,320 --> 01:50:18,560
