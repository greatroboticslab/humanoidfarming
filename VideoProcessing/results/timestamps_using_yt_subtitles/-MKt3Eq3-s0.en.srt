5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:10,800
story about this farm and it's very

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:11,920
heartwarming and i can't wait to meet

how long you been you guys been here for

10
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:22,400
um well i i was more or less born here

11
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:23,519
and it's like about the third day after

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
i was born i

13
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,199
i came here with my parents and well

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,240
they started farming

15
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,480
so you've been here your whole life

16
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,640
basically yes yes amazing

17
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:33,520
so this was a dairy it was a dairy yeah

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:35,680
yeah yeah

19
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:37,200
yeah everything was manual very hard

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,360
work so you've been

21
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:40,879
basically been a farmer or involved with

22
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,559
farming your entire life and

23
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,640
well that's that's what happens when

24
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:48,640
you're born on a farm base

25
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:50,559
you know it's hard to escape yeah so um

26
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,680
and i noticed in the area like there's a

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,079
lot of farming in this

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,960
in this area yes yeah yeah that's sort

29
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:58,480
of

30
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:00,559
dairy farming and in fact

31
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:02,960
like 50 years ago practically every

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,359
house in the area yeah was a small farm

33
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:06,080
of

34
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,520
some kind so your entire environment

35
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,360
your family life

36
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,040
like past on your heritage it's all

37
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,040
farming oh yeah everything's fine

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,520
everything's farming yeah yeah when when

39
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,360
you've got a family dairy farm

40
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:23,040
it's so time-consuming uh needs so much

41
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:25,119
energy and commitment

42
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:26,479
it's what you do you don't have time for

43
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,000
hobbies or

44
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,759
you know you get up in the morning you

45
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,720
start looking after the cows

46
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,200
and by the time you finished at night

47
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,799
you're

48
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,880
just too knackered to do anything

49
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:38,000
basically a lot of farmers they live and

50
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,159
breathe this stuff and it's

51
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,399
oh yes definitely yeah it's a way of

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,640
life you know it is it is a way of life

53
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,079
it's not it's more than a lifestyle it's

54
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:47,680
an all-encompassing

55
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:49,200
wow and that's what makes it so

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,320
difficult for

57
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:54,560
farmers to contemplate change yeah

58
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,560
it's not like another industry where you

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,399
like go to work

60
00:01:56,560 --> 00:01:59,759
somewhere else you could go anywhere to

61
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,280
go to work

62
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,880
yeah it is a very distinct way of life

63
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:06,240
so far as to say to a farmer and say

64
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,840
like you've got to change this whole

65
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:09,360
facility right now and stop farming

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:10,879
animals like that would be a daunting

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,160
concept like that they wouldn't even

68
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,319
something that would even cross their

69
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
mind no no it would seem

70
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:17,599
impossible yeah you've got to have a

71
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,720
very good

72
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,680
um you know like offer or

73
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,280
incentive for people to change yeah all

74
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,840
right let's go to a different um

75
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,520
part of the farm and we'll talk about um

76
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
we'll start talking about your change

77
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,560
could call it like a awakening kind of

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,640
thing wasn't it

79
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:40,000
um yeah sort of but but um

80
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,640
you know i think the rocks set in for me

81
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,879
when i

82
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,200
i learned transcendental meditation

83
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:46,640
about 30 years ago i really it would be

84
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:49,599
40 years ago now

85
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,000
and everybody connected with that was

86
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:53,040
vegan

87
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:57,760
or vegetarian yeah even back then and

88
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:59,120
so um i found it difficult to look after

89
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:01,760
the animals and then

90
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,319
sit down and eat them basically which is

91
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,080
what

92
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,800
you know that was what you were expected

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,920
to do that was the way things were

94
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:13,360
um so i became vegetarian then and

95
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,360
um so

96
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
when the when we approached the vegan

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,120
society

98
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,599
i was good and ready to take the next

99
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:24,799
step wow but it was

100
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,200
how to do it on the farm and

101
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,920
i really wanted to produce food on the

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,159
farm

103
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,440
i didn't want to sort of sell it and

104
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,120
walk away and say

105
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,200
okay i've had enough of this i can't do

106
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,720
it anymore

107
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:41,200
we want to provide a some kind of

108
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:42,319
template or example that you can do

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,480
something different you can

110
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,080
feed people yeah but you don't have to

111
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:48,400
have fields full of animals

112
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:49,519
and animals going to the slaughterhouse

113
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,720
or

114
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:55,680
animals having calves every year yeah

115
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:57,599
um permanently pregnant basically and

116
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:58,319
you just don't need to do it in order to

117
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,280
feed

118
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,040
the the world's population and in order

119
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:03,360
in order to live the farming lifestyle

120
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,840
that

121
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,640
is truly hard and true to your tradition

122
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,439
you have to

123
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:10,080
that's it you you feel responsible for

124
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:13,360
the farm

125
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:16,239
you know it's um some

126
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,840
obviously you enjoy being in the the

127
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,840
countryside who wouldn't

128
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:22,160
yeah um and let's face it we need

129
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:24,560
farmers yeah we need farmers but

130
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,280
we don't necessarily need the no the

131
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,720
animals

132
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:31,440
the stuff that goes with it that's

133
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,160
30 years worth of crap you can see the

134
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:34,240
where

135
00:04:32,160 --> 00:04:36,000
two cows used to live and they've got

136
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:39,440
the water bowl in front of them

137
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:40,080
we had probably 80 80 milk cows tied up

138
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:43,120
in there

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,960
okay to be milked every day and

140
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,479
so in the winter you'd get up get your

141
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,280
wheelbarrow

142
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:51,120
clean the manure from behind the cows

143
00:04:49,280 --> 00:04:53,600
and then the day starts

144
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:54,160
yeah so back back then with the um

145
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:56,400
because

146
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,520
being a dairy you wouldn't have any sex

147
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:59,360
semen back then

148
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
did you have to send any of the calves

149
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:04,000
away um

150
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,320
yes the the most of the male calves yeah

151
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:09,759
had to go to it was a regular

152
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:12,320
like friday run to derby

153
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:12,960
uh cattle market to to take the calves

154
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:16,240
to market

155
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:18,960
so and back then the male cast would be

156
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:20,560
sent for beef or growing for veal um you

157
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:21,280
know i don't know i presume they went

158
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,560
for beef

159
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:28,320
yeah but um i was ours were not

160
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,240
extreme dairy breeds so possibly they

161
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,080
they went for beef and i think um

162
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,320
probably holsteins or

163
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:35,360
more extreme dairy breeds probably go

164
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:38,000
for veal i'd say

165
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,039
yeah a lot of them are they actually

166
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:41,360
kill them on the farm

167
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:43,199
yeah england yeah no we never did that

168
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:45,680
no

169
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:47,199
i see over here we've got some some

170
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,960
little friends over here

171
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,160
yeah yeah yes 17 friends

172
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:57,600
this is what they for the winter wow

173
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:58,319
and um they eat on average 10 of those a

174
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:01,039
week

175
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,000
wow even the few that we've got so um

176
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:05,039
and how many have you got

177
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:06,080
17. you've got 17 here so only a small

178
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:08,479
amount of animals

179
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:09,360
oh yes comparably to like oh yeah a

180
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,720
large scale

181
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:15,520
yes yes and that just shows the

182
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:17,520
environmental impact of keeping

183
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,919
livestock yeah because

184
00:06:17,520 --> 00:06:22,240
ours are not producing anything no they

185
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,720
eat ten of these a week just to live

186
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,520
just and if you were fattening them for

187
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,360
beef

188
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:29,680
you'd have to supplement that with

189
00:06:27,360 --> 00:06:31,759
grains barley or something or

190
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,039
if they were milking obviously they'd

191
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:35,680
have enormous

192
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,280
energy demands and eating what they call

193
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,479
dairy concentrates which

194
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:42,160
which contain micronized protein stuff

195
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:44,319
from all over the world

196
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,600
in particular soya which is very

197
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:47,600
damaging yeah

198
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,360
and and of course cereals that people

199
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:51,039
could eat of course yeah yeah

200
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,639
a lot of people think that because uh

201
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:54,560
like they see the cows on the grass and

202
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,960
they don't ever supplement their diets

203
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,919
yeah yeah no that's only part of it um

204
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:01,039
yeah there are

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:04,080
there are people making grass-fed

206
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:06,400
and beef and away milk but um

207
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:08,400
they're still harvesting a lot of grass

208
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:11,919
so the environmental cost of

209
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,319
just producing food through animals is

210
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:13,759
just

211
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:15,520
it's just magnifying all of the

212
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
resources

213
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,639
it just doesn't make sense anymore with

214
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:24,720
the the growing world population and the

215
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:27,360
climate crisis and the loss of habitat

216
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
uh agriculture is responsible for and

217
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,520
when you look around on the countryside

218
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,039
it's just it all is this flattened grass

219
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:35,360
exactly yeah yeah people think that's

220
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:38,800
just normal that's just normal

221
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,360
no it isn't it's um i mean

222
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,319
that's panda hello panda you look like a

223
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:45,599
panda

224
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
hello darling so so you said you started

225
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,639
to make the connection you went you went

226
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
vegetarian and you still had

227
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:51,840
uh cattle on your farm that you were

228
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,520
having to yeah yeah

229
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,879
can you explain that what that felt like

230
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,240
making the connection to the animals and

231
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,639
still having to do what you had to do

232
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,720
kind of thing you in two minds or

233
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:02,400
torn a little bit or well i was very

234
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,080
torn because i mean

235
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:08,479
you look after somebody like this and

236
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:09,360
or panda panda should have been a beef a

237
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:15,039
beef animal

238
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:15,039
and you sort of look after them and

239
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:19,280
i mean look into their eyes you can see

240
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
there's somebody in there

241
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,560
and then you have to put them in a

242
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,840
trailer and take them to the abattoir

243
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:27,680
it's just

244
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:29,199
it's um like it must feel like because

245
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,639
you're kind of their only carer they've

246
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:31,360
never known that it's like a sense of

247
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:34,080
betrayal

248
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,919
it is a sense of betrayal you feel you

249
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:37,519
like sending somebody you know to be

250
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:40,880
murdered basically in

251
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,839
terrifying circumstances we used to go

252
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:44,880
to a

253
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:46,880
you know big abattoir in shropshire and

254
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:48,240
like at the front it's all like glossy

255
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:50,959
like a supermarket

256
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:53,839
and you go around the back where the

257
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:56,000
farmers take the animals and there's

258
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:58,480
pens where you put the animals and

259
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:59,440
and you know you can smell the smells

260
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,200
from the

261
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:02,800
slaughter process coming out the back

262
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,800
and you can tell that they

263
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:08,720
you know as soon as they you can tell

264
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:10,320
they've got a pretty pretty good idea

265
00:09:08,720 --> 00:09:13,279
what's coming for yeah

266
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,040
and you can feel the stress in there you

267
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,320
know the whole it's like a nightmare

268
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,800
place to go

269
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:20,839
and um you can see you've seen the

270
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,360
images of cows trying to escape the

271
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,200
slaughterhouse

272
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,399
yeah yeah yeah i never saw that i never

273
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,200
saw inside

274
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,720
yeah it was not something i had an

275
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:31,839
ambition to do

276
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,360
so as farmers even though they're

277
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,160
connected to the animals on the farm do

278
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:35,760
you think they have a level of

279
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:38,720
disconnect from the slaughterhouse

280
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:38,720
process like um

281
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:46,880
yes you couldn't do it otherwise

282
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:48,880
but i couldn't do it so i

283
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,240
obviously knew there was a different way

284
00:09:48,880 --> 00:09:50,560
it had to be a different way a different

285
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,640
way

286
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,519
yeah you didn't have to didn't have to

287
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,200
put yourself to it let alone the animals

288
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:59,680
just the act of putting them in the

289
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:01,600
trailer it must completely freak them

290
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,560
out well it does

291
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:03,680
because they were wondering where

292
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,640
they're going and then when they get

293
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:07,680
there

294
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:12,079
so you've got names for all these yes

295
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:12,079
yes yeah yeah panda and

296
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,240
blue badger

297
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:23,040
hole in the head yeah we treat them like

298
00:10:20,720 --> 00:10:24,000
individuals yeah but we have to realize

299
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,000
that they're cattle

300
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:28,079
yeah and they have different instincts

301
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,959
and different ways of reacting to the

302
00:10:28,079 --> 00:10:32,079
behaviors

303
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,320
yeah so how long have you

304
00:10:32,079 --> 00:10:35,600
has it been since you have been

305
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:38,880
operating as a normal

306
00:10:35,600 --> 00:10:39,680
you know beef farmer it could be four

307
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:41,920
years now

308
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,040
i think it's four years um since the

309
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,399
vegan society

310
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:47,680
visited and um yeah we sat around the

311
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,800
kitchen table and

312
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:52,800
and they said well there's something

313
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:55,040
else you can do on your farm apart from

314
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,240
keeping animals

315
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:59,760
and that's when we decided yeah that's

316
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,519
what we've been looking for that's what

317
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:04,079
we want to do

318
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,200
yeah so phil was pretty crazy like

319
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:06,800
thinking that

320
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,320
you know like going back to that mindset

321
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:09,920
where you're in before and then now that

322
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:11,920
now you don't even have to worry about

323
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:14,399
taking them to this corner no no it's

324
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:18,320
just it's it's incredible

325
00:11:14,399 --> 00:11:20,320
you can't believe what a a revelation

326
00:11:18,320 --> 00:11:23,279
and a

327
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:24,079
a life-changing experience it was not to

328
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,959
have to do that

329
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:32,079
anymore and to know that um

330
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,680
well people animals like panda won't

331
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,600
have to go through what what they used

332
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,600
to have to go through

333
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,160
but as i say i was in the same position

334
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:43,680
of as other farmers up till then

335
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:46,079
i didn't know what else i could do yeah

336
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,440
and um yeah that would be interesting to

337
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,040
talk about like what would be

338
00:11:47,440 --> 00:11:50,560
like let's just say there's farmer out

339
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,839
there that kind of felt feels the same

340
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:53,040
way they're kind of in two minds and

341
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,920
they feel like there's no other way like

342
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,920
what would you say

343
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,560
like to someone like that that we're at

344
00:11:55,920 --> 00:12:02,480
that place in time where you were at

345
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:04,320
um well just

346
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,760
take stock of what you're doing you know

347
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:07,600
real think think about

348
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,200
what effect you're having on the animals

349
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:12,639
what effect you're having on the

350
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:15,680
planet and yourself

351
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:16,720
and realize that you don't have to do

352
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,320
this

353
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,360
you can do something else you could

354
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,720
grow vegetables like we hoped to still

355
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:28,560
not started

356
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:29,760
um you could turn your farm into a

357
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:33,519
sanctuary

358
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:34,320
um or you could grow trees go into

359
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,880
forestry

360
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:39,440
do what you know just you've got this

361
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,079
farm most people own the farm i know

362
00:12:39,440 --> 00:12:41,760
some people

363
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,920
rent the farm so it's a lot more

364
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:46,880
difficult for them

365
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,519
um but you know the land is there you

366
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,839
can do

367
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:52,320
whatever you want with it yeah so what

368
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,440
have you chosen to do here um

369
00:12:52,320 --> 00:12:57,040
well we we we've been delayed by covid

370
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
the same as everybody else but we should

371
00:12:57,040 --> 00:13:00,240
have been producing vegetables this

372
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,360
spring yeah

373
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:06,079
and that's the overall plan that a small

374
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,959
area of the farm will produce as much

375
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:09,839
food as

376
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:11,920
all the animals used to um yeah we'll

377
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,920
grow vegan organic vegetables which

378
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:19,200
need no animal inputs whatsoever amazing

379
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,480
that's crazy like to think like this is

380
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:23,200
17 cows

381
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:25,040
what they're eating like what an

382
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:29,040
intensive dairy in canada

383
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:32,720
needs to feed them oh yeah yeah it's

384
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,720
it's just unfathomable like

385
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,399
um yeah it's one thing that um i mean

386
00:13:36,320 --> 00:13:40,880
that will be different that i've been

387
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:41,920
sort of wandering around this huge site

388
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:45,839
for

389
00:13:41,920 --> 00:13:47,360
years on my own since my dad died and

390
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,279
hopefully in a couple of years time

391
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,320
there might be

392
00:13:49,279 --> 00:13:56,079
12 20 people employed here

393
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,639
okay so that will be a massive boost for

394
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:01,360
local employment yeah and you know

395
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,000
really useful jobs as well you know yeah

396
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:05,040
yeah definitely fulfilling jobs

397
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,959
definitely yeah

398
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,639
yeah that's that's something that you

399
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:10,240
see farmers saying a lot that that

400
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,680
you know that this movement of

401
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:13,760
plant-based eating it's just like

402
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:17,839
attacking their their livelihood

403
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,120
and um like if new markets open up and

404
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,720
you know there's more plant-based foods

405
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:21,440
available that food needs to be grown

406
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:22,959
and produced

407
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,040
and you know it's got to come from

408
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:28,079
somewhere well if more people

409
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:31,760
um give up meat and dairy

410
00:14:28,079 --> 00:14:32,639
the market will force people to produce

411
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:34,800
food differently

412
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:37,839
it'll decide what the farmers move into

413
00:14:34,800 --> 00:14:39,839
yeah and it will provide an opportunity

414
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:40,880
the opportunity will be there the market

415
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:43,920
will be there

416
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:44,240
yeah and it'll be stupid to do anything

417
00:14:43,920 --> 00:14:46,079
else

418
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,320
yeah well it would make life on the

419
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:50,000
planet possible in the future

420
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,519
we've got to do it and it would be a

421
00:14:50,000 --> 00:14:51,920
better world without slaughterhouses

422
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:55,120
that's

423
00:14:51,920 --> 00:14:57,920
for sure definitely yeah absolutely

424
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:59,040
so this is like a little portable so

425
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,880
it's almost like it looks like a truck

426
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,320
container it does yeah yeah it

427
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:06,800
used to be a milk delivery truck well so

428
00:15:04,320 --> 00:15:07,680
well that's even better so this was a

429
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:11,279
dairy milk

430
00:15:07,680 --> 00:15:12,480
delivery truck we've got a cheese kettle

431
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:14,320
that um

432
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:15,760
we heat the oats and the water and the

433
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,720
other ingredients okay

434
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:19,199
sort of extract the products from the

435
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:22,399
oats

436
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:24,880
yeah it is a mini mini uh factory really

437
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:26,880
yeah wow see how crazy is that you can

438
00:15:24,880 --> 00:15:27,360
make a little mini oat drink factory in

439
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:29,680
the back

440
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,560
backyard of your farm there that's it

441
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:33,120
you don't even

442
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:35,600
you don't even need a suitable building

443
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,600
you can convert something like this

444
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:39,519
and literally drop it off the back of a

445
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:43,279
truck and next day

446
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:46,240
could be in business and no animals um

447
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,839
being you know chained up and on a

448
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:48,480
milking machine in the milking club

449
00:15:47,839 --> 00:15:51,680
absolutely

450
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,920
no no no carvings

451
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,680
no calves being taken away that's it

452
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:58,800
it's the only ethical way

453
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:01,120
yeah that's it wants you to if you want

454
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:02,800
to put something on your cereal in the

455
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:04,560
morning then your coffee

456
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:06,800
yeah it doesn't need to come out of a

457
00:16:04,560 --> 00:16:07,279
cow no it doesn't need to go through all

458
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:09,839
that

459
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:12,959
no that process exactly don't have to

460
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:15,120
impregnate the cow

461
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,920
all that yeah because the milk is coming

462
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:19,759
from a cow that's been pregnant

463
00:16:17,920 --> 00:16:21,279
don't forget that part now this just

464
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:23,759
seems like such a

465
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,560
insane way to get a beverage to put on

466
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:29,519
top of your cereal

467
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,560
very yeah it's such a such a sweat isn't

468
00:16:29,519 --> 00:16:34,160
it basically

469
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:37,040
all unnecessary and better if

470
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,320
if people didn't do it really yeah yeah

471
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:41,199
this is the way forward

472
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:43,040
it is and it's all assert everything

473
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:45,839
every ingredient is certified

474
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,800
organic so it's it's not just animal

475
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:48,800
free it's

476
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,240
the highest possible production

477
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:52,240
standards amazing

478
00:16:50,240 --> 00:16:54,079
well i came to the farm because jay said

479
00:16:52,240 --> 00:16:55,600
i want to get out of farming but the

480
00:16:54,079 --> 00:16:58,959
idea then of course was

481
00:16:55,600 --> 00:17:01,199
renewable energy wow okay you are also

482
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,959
very much bound by what your land is

483
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:05,679
capable of producing yeah

484
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,120
growing up if the farmers in wales say i

485
00:17:05,679 --> 00:17:09,600
can't grow avocados

486
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:11,199
that's true but you know other things

487
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:12,319
are possible and not everybody has to

488
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:16,000
produce food

489
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,640
you know we need timber you know we need

490
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:20,319
we need carbon capture you know other

491
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:23,520
other things are possible but they will

492
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:25,760
need a lot of support also from this new

493
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:28,160
uh hopefully from the new government

494
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:30,480
subsidies scheme

495
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:32,000
and that that might actually open a few

496
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:33,600
doors for people to get out of life

497
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:34,480
stuck into doing something different

498
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:37,440
with the land

499
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,960
yeah no definitely there's there's

500
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:40,400
always different alternatives not just

501
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,120
food i mean if you can't grow something

502
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:43,360
there's

503
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,750
there's like like you put a trucking

504
00:17:43,360 --> 00:17:51,679
container at the back here

505
00:17:46,750 --> 00:17:53,280
[Music]

506
00:17:51,679 --> 00:17:54,880
it doesn't matter if they've got some in

507
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,760
front of them already there's always

508
00:17:54,880 --> 00:17:57,760
something better

509
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,160
i think the two oh here comes rosie

510
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:04,260
rosie

511
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:08,230
we're rolling the hay

512
00:18:04,260 --> 00:18:08,230
[Music]

513
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:12,400
they got is it got protein in that that

514
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,559
oh yeah yeah it has got protein

515
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:15,600
where the cows get their protein from

516
00:18:14,559 --> 00:18:17,679
yeah well

517
00:18:15,600 --> 00:18:19,760
they're all vegans don't don't tell

518
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:21,120
anybody

519
00:18:19,760 --> 00:18:23,150
so who's got the most interesting

520
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:25,039
personality out of all the cows

521
00:18:23,150 --> 00:18:28,080
[Music]

522
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,799
some of them are cheeky here comes uh

523
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:31,679
this one's called hole in there yes that

524
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,960
one's cheeky

525
00:18:31,679 --> 00:18:38,480
yeah it's a bit cheeky so a lot of the

526
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:42,080
cows have gone to sanctuaries

527
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,480
we send we send

528
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:45,600
around 60 to hillside animal sanctuary

529
00:18:44,480 --> 00:18:48,799
in norfolk

530
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:52,240
who took them all and that was amazing

531
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:55,039
especially satisfying because they could

532
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:57,039
all stay with their calves or the cows

533
00:18:55,039 --> 00:19:00,160
i think when you change you've got to

534
00:18:57,039 --> 00:19:02,559
accept that what you did previously

535
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:04,960
wasn't a good thing yeah i think that's

536
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,720
a big hurdle for people that you know

537
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,799
you've got to say

538
00:19:06,720 --> 00:19:10,799
you think about all those hundreds of

539
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,880
animals who went to the slaughterhouse

540
00:19:10,799 --> 00:19:16,400
or you think of all that

541
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:19,120
the imported protein

542
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:21,840
maize soya whatever that that you were

543
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:23,120
responsible for being grown on what used

544
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:26,480
to be

545
00:19:23,120 --> 00:19:29,679
grassland or forest and which is now

546
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
intensive cropland until you start

547
00:19:29,679 --> 00:19:34,160
really thinking about

548
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:36,480
it it's just what you do and

549
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,520
they talk about farming being a

550
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:42,559
close-knit community it is because

551
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:45,520
farmers talk farming amongst farmers and

552
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,559
and nobody else has a clue what it's

553
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:48,799
about or

554
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:51,200
you can't relate to other people i mean

555
00:19:48,799 --> 00:19:55,280
i always say that um

556
00:19:51,200 --> 00:19:57,919
farmers interact with animals more than

557
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:59,200
more than uh you know your average vegan

558
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:00,799
activist does

559
00:19:59,200 --> 00:20:03,120
you know and so they know they know more

560
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:04,159
than me how much of a personality these

561
00:20:03,120 --> 00:20:06,640
animals have

562
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:07,600
so like i try to sort of ask them to

563
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:09,520
like you know

564
00:20:07,600 --> 00:20:11,039
you know you know more than me like how

565
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,360
much these animals are individuals and

566
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:14,480
they

567
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:17,120
want to because you've got years of um

568
00:20:14,480 --> 00:20:17,840
living with them literally living with

569
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,360
them

570
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:24,240
and you recognize that families

571
00:20:21,360 --> 00:20:24,720
have different personalities and you can

572
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,320
say

573
00:20:24,720 --> 00:20:30,240
oh yes she's just like her mother wow

574
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:32,080
yeah so they pass on their their

575
00:20:30,240 --> 00:20:34,559
attributes absolutely yes

576
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,000
so how do you think that um someone

577
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,039
could be so connected to animals but

578
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,280
still eat them

579
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:41,280
i think it's this thing tradition isn't

580
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:45,039
it an expectation

581
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,919
and um like

582
00:20:45,039 --> 00:20:49,200
community it's the people define

583
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,039
themselves as

584
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:56,960
oh i i like my meat i like my cheese

585
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:59,120
it's who i am one thing um

586
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:01,039
referring back to your question uh you

587
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,440
know if farmers care so much for the

588
00:21:01,039 --> 00:21:07,679
animals

589
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:10,080
i can part of the answer is

590
00:21:07,679 --> 00:21:10,799
that farmers care for the animals to the

591
00:21:10,080 --> 00:21:12,880
point

592
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:14,080
where they will retreat when it comes to

593
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,919
the slaughter

594
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:18,240
and you will hear anecdotes and people

595
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:19,600
will say oh i love the animals but when

596
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,679
they get slaughtered you know i just

597
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:24,400
have to clear out i can't be around

598
00:21:21,679 --> 00:21:25,600
yeah so i guess like a lot of farmers

599
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,960
will just put them on the truck and then

600
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:28,240
that'll be it like i know some

601
00:21:26,960 --> 00:21:29,520
some driving to this look like

602
00:21:28,240 --> 00:21:31,520
smallholders will drive them to the

603
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:33,280
slaughterhouse yeah yeah but uh some

604
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,679
some will just lead them onto the truck

605
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,280
and that's it and then

606
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:38,880
forget that we're back to back to the

607
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:40,320
new bed yeah yeah

608
00:21:38,880 --> 00:21:42,000
put it tuck it away in the back of their

609
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,679
mind and

610
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:47,919
most people are safely removed from the

611
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:49,679
physical reality of it they know it

612
00:21:47,919 --> 00:21:51,280
happens but they they don't like to

613
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:53,360
think about it they like to buy the

614
00:21:51,280 --> 00:21:55,520
little packet of

615
00:21:53,360 --> 00:21:57,120
something with something with a silly

616
00:21:55,520 --> 00:21:59,600
name like steak or

617
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,679
veal that doesn't actually refer to an

618
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,000
animal it's kind of a product

619
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:06,320
you're going to go to the supermarket

620
00:22:04,000 --> 00:22:08,960
you buy a little tray of

621
00:22:06,320 --> 00:22:10,480
yeah it doesn't say this was rosie no no

622
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:11,360
rosie went to the slaughterhouse and

623
00:22:10,480 --> 00:22:14,640
didn't want to die

624
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:17,200
this is a piece of british raised red

625
00:22:14,640 --> 00:22:18,640
grass-fed uh steak it's detached from

626
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:22,240
the individual isn't it yeah

627
00:22:18,640 --> 00:22:25,200
yeah yeah so what we're

628
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:26,000
what we sort of think is well you can

629
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,159
get your protein

630
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,880
you can get your carbohydrate you can

631
00:22:28,159 --> 00:22:32,559
get your vitamins and minerals

632
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:34,159
you don't have to feed all that stuff to

633
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,360
a cow first

634
00:22:34,159 --> 00:22:40,000
then kill the cow yeah yeah why bother

635
00:22:37,360 --> 00:22:41,200
it's it's just all bad what a silly

636
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,679
thing to do why not just

637
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,280
eat the stuff in the first place yeah

638
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:47,840
it's hazel's like the best seat

639
00:22:45,280 --> 00:22:49,280
oh it turns definitely yeah like i just

640
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,760
push it it's got the best cushioning

641
00:22:49,280 --> 00:22:53,200
it's very good here you go i'll be your

642
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:55,039
personal servant

643
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,600
okay so this is uh this is the product

644
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,280
here this is this is what you produced

645
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:01,120
in the amazing little facility out the

646
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:02,640
back look at that looks beautiful

647
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:04,720
and it's in this traditional glass

648
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,559
bottle here returnable

649
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:08,400
and this so you guys are doing this

650
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,600
actually you guys are actually

651
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,960
producers for uh like an operation

652
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:15,120
called refarmed yeah

653
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:16,559
yeah refarmed and and what their goal is

654
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:20,159
is to turn

655
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:22,640
animal-based farmers into oat drink

656
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:27,919
producers yeah yeah wow

657
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:27,919
oh look look at that

658
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:35,679
it reminds me of like a creamy

659
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:38,159
like like porridge well i guess it's

660
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:38,159
because of oats

661
00:23:39,440 --> 00:23:43,279
but it is super creamy it does yeah it's

662
00:23:42,559 --> 00:23:45,600
really good

663
00:23:43,279 --> 00:23:46,400
so this is all this is just just very

664
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,799
very simple

665
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:49,679
ingredients in here now you've got it in

666
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:52,400
the bottle here

667
00:23:49,679 --> 00:23:53,520
like and it's been a long sort of

668
00:23:52,400 --> 00:23:55,360
progression from

669
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:56,640
you know where you come from to here but

670
00:23:55,360 --> 00:23:58,159
um

671
00:23:56,640 --> 00:24:00,080
you haven't been alone in this you've

672
00:23:58,159 --> 00:24:01,360
had helpers so who's helped you along

673
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:03,440
the way to get you to where

674
00:24:01,360 --> 00:24:05,440
you guys to where you are now um well

675
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:08,880
first of all the vegan society

676
00:24:05,440 --> 00:24:09,919
and then they kind of offshoot the vegan

677
00:24:08,880 --> 00:24:12,080
organic network

678
00:24:09,919 --> 00:24:14,480
okay who um who are promoting

679
00:24:12,080 --> 00:24:16,159
animal-free agriculture wow in in all

680
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:18,720
its forms

681
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,400
and laterally reformed and that's the

682
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,679
whole idea of refarmed isn't it

683
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:27,279
yeah it's to provide a real solid

684
00:24:23,679 --> 00:24:27,760
genuine alternative that real people can

685
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:31,039
do

686
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:32,880
wow to change their lives and change the

687
00:24:31,039 --> 00:24:34,720
way we react

688
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:36,880
the way we interact with the planet as

689
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:38,960
whole amazing so it's all good

690
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:40,159
well you have to say that refund only

691
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:41,679
found us because

692
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:43,840
of the help we had from the vegan

693
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:47,120
society of the vegan organic network

694
00:24:43,840 --> 00:24:48,960
amazing because obviously

695
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,960
there was a lot of media exposure and

696
00:24:48,960 --> 00:24:53,520
that's how they knew about us

697
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,600
if you ever return hopefully we can

698
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:58,000
offer you some vegan organic vegetables

699
00:24:55,600 --> 00:24:58,960
amazing that would be that would be like

700
00:24:58,000 --> 00:25:02,960
veganic

701
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,960
vegetables veganic farming is there

702
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,640
is a way forward isn't it absolutely so

703
00:25:04,960 --> 00:25:09,360
they don't need any animal inputs

704
00:25:06,640 --> 00:25:10,320
or anything like that no no no no manure

705
00:25:09,360 --> 00:25:12,960
um

706
00:25:10,320 --> 00:25:13,679
nothing at all amazing yeah well they

707
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:15,440
said that

708
00:25:13,679 --> 00:25:16,799
they say it can't be done but it can be

709
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:20,159
done and it will be done

710
00:25:16,799 --> 00:25:21,279
yes the the trick is um the knowledge is

711
00:25:20,159 --> 00:25:24,480
out there but

712
00:25:21,279 --> 00:25:27,679
on a very small scale in many places

713
00:25:24,480 --> 00:25:29,440
um it just needs upscaling upscaling and

714
00:25:27,679 --> 00:25:31,200
when you get the message out there

715
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,880
hopefully uh people just have a

716
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:35,039
change of heart or there's a massive

717
00:25:32,880 --> 00:25:36,240
change in demand and everyone's gonna

718
00:25:35,039 --> 00:25:38,880
you know a lot of people might need

719
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:42,159
something to fall back on and look

720
00:25:38,880 --> 00:25:45,520
oat drink is where it's at and

721
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:46,880
yeah and for farmers don't say oh dear

722
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,080
somebody's trying to put me out of

723
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:50,559

752
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,159
future with more ethical

753
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:55,440
farming better for the environment and

754
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,039
just seeing

755
00:26:55,440 --> 00:26:58,640
those animals in there and they've got

756
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,559
another chance now and all the other

757
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:02,559
animals that got taken to the sanctuary

758
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:05,039
is just a beautiful story and

759
00:27:02,559 --> 00:27:06,240
the oat milk is fantastic the oat drink

760
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:08,400
is fantastic

761
00:27:06,240 --> 00:27:10,159
and it's just a really positive story

762
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:11,760
and i hope this inspires some other

763
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:13,279
farmers out there who are

764
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,400
they might be at a crossroads i don't

765
00:27:13,279 --> 00:27:16,240
like taking the animals to the

766
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:17,840
slaughterhouse well there's another way

767
00:27:16,240 --> 00:27:21,840
and this is the future really

768
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:21,840
plant-based food is the future so

769
00:27:22,050 --> 00:27:25,430
