1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:06,540
it was a cloudy and overcast morning at

2
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:09,150
UK's research and education center which

3
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,519
made for comfortable temperatures not

4
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:12,120
usually the case for July in Western

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:15,170
Kentucky

6
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:18,210
but welcomed by the crop scouting teams

7
00:00:15,170 --> 00:00:21,330
the eight high school teams consisting

8
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:24,570
of four to six members rotated through

9
00:00:21,330 --> 00:00:31,830
ten stations in the competition ranging

10
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:35,700
from soil properties weeds corn

11
00:00:31,830 --> 00:00:44,280
agronomics and more in a very hands-on

12
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:47,489
event so insects disease we're teaching

13
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,890
them how to scout fields work with some

14
00:00:47,489 --> 00:00:52,469
of our soil issues and also some basic

15
00:00:49,890 --> 00:00:54,300
corn soybean agronomics as well because

16
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:56,309
there is a younger grouse stage do you

17
00:00:54,300 --> 00:00:58,829
think that Kirsten why said the

18
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:01,770
competition is very similar to what a

19
00:00:58,829 --> 00:01:04,920
professional crop scout or consultant

20
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:08,130
would do in their job and gives UK a

21
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,720
chance to showcase its facilities we

22
00:01:08,130 --> 00:01:11,729
think this is a great opportunity for

23
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,670
the University of Kentucky to interact

24
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:15,750
with high school students particularly

25
00:01:14,670 --> 00:01:17,640
students that are interested in

26
00:01:15,750 --> 00:01:19,140
agriculture of course I did some

27
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,920
scouting when I was back in high school

28
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:23,490
in college

29
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:26,729
Bobby Schmitt was taught agriculture at

30
00:01:23,490 --> 00:01:29,189
Livingston County for 25 years was

31
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,680
excited about the opportunity to bring

32
00:01:29,189 --> 00:01:34,259
his students to the competition and be

33
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,880
so close to home I've been over here

34
00:01:34,259 --> 00:01:37,799
several times for field days and stuff

35
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:40,290
and if nobody's ever been here it's

36
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,920
really a neat place because you see so

37
00:01:40,290 --> 00:01:46,530
much on relatively a small acreage I

38
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,799
think it's a good good representation of

39
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,509
West Kentucky are the soils that we have

40
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,549
and a lot of growing conditions you

41
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:56,159
mentioned some of the insects Schmidt

42
00:01:53,549 --> 00:01:58,710
liked the fact that contest involved UK

43
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:01,649
specialists guiding the students through

44
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:03,960
the stations UK faculty graduate

45
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:06,240
students and interns all were involved

46
00:02:03,960 --> 00:02:10,520
in the competition and the students in

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:12,310
the contest said they learned a lot

48
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:14,530
going in like

49
00:02:12,310 --> 00:02:16,209
staging corn and like which sage it

50
00:02:14,530 --> 00:02:19,300
comes in and like I learned the same

51
00:02:16,209 --> 00:02:21,340
with like soybeans I got to learn like

52
00:02:19,300 --> 00:02:22,930
where you look at the plant like which

53
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,670
node you need to look at and different

54
00:02:22,930 --> 00:02:27,970
stuff like that so that was pretty cool

55
00:02:24,670 --> 00:02:31,750
I believe it will give me foresight for

56
00:02:27,970 --> 00:02:34,120
the future to kind of see what I'd be

57
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:37,930
getting into like taking that college

58
00:02:34,120 --> 00:02:39,819
courses saying well hey you know this is

59
00:02:37,930 --> 00:02:40,959
kind of what this is about you know give

60
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:43,810
me just a little bit of information

61
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:46,540
before you dive deep into that big

62
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:48,940
terminology officials at UK's research

63
00:02:46,540 --> 00:02:52,330
and education center hope to make the

64
00:02:48,940 --> 00:02:53,890
competition an annual event from the

65
00:02:52,330 --> 00:02:56,549
University of Kentucky College of

66
00:02:53,890 --> 00:02:58,600
Agriculture Food and environmental

67
00:02:56,549 --> 00:03:01,740
reporting

68
