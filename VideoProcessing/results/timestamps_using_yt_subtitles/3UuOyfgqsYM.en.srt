[Music]

2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,880
agriculture

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,720
is the most

4
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:19,760
fundamental and ancient activity

5
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,359
that propelled human civilization as we

6
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:24,000
know it today

7
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,519
before agriculture yeah there were

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,039
people there were

9
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:31,119
modern humans but they formed groups of

10
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:34,320
hunters and gatherers

11
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:37,360
and they didn't build cities they

12
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,879
didn't build empires

13
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:44,079
so agriculture is perceived

14
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:48,320
by many as a very conservative

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:51,360
activity however it has been

16
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:55,760
over the time characterized by

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:59,039
a rate of innovation that was necessary

18
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:02,719
in order to be able to feed the

19
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,400
populations and of course the rate of

20
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,640
population

21
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:11,760
was statistically speaking exactly equal

22
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:15,439
with the amount of calories that

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:16,560
agriculture could produce at a given

24
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:19,520
time

25
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,040
because if you had more people and not

26
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:25,280
enough calories

27
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:29,119
there would be starvation and death

28
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,400
this kind of cycle of

29
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:32,799
overshooting population that will then

30
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,600
go

31
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,880
back to the sustainable level has

32
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:41,280
characterized human civilization for

33
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,439
thousands of years tens of thousands of

34
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,040
years

35
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:50,000
and it was invisible

36
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,479
to most unless they were the one

37
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:55,600
starving

38
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,119
now we have a globally interconnected

39
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,119
world

40
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:05,200
and we know when there is a

41
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,239
food crisis somewhere and hopefully

42
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:12,319
we intervene we help

43
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:15,440
we prevent famine and starvation to kill

44
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:19,360
people actually

45
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:22,640
agriculture now is powerful enough

46
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,319
in its ability to create

47
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:29,440
the output edible calories

48
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:33,040
that when there is famine

49
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:37,760
it is not due to lack of food

50
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:41,680
it is due to insufficient logistics

51
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,560
or active prevention of the population

52
00:02:41,680 --> 00:02:48,400
being fed

53
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,400
by civil war and conflict or corruption

54
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:55,760
however the way that agriculture arrived

55
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:59,440
to the point where it is today

56
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:02,640
must change the impact of agriculture

57
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,720
on the environment must

58
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:09,760
be ameliorated must be enlightened

59
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:11,760
the pressure that humanity puts on the

60
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:16,879
environment

61
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:20,319
is not compatible with our future

62
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:24,239
i uh was lucky to

63
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:27,680
participate in the opening meeting

64
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:31,760
of a new think tank the think tank

65
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,040
farm to fork that was born

66
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:37,200
to catalyze the

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,879
rate of innovation and the rate of

68
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,640
technology adoption

69
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:46,319
in agriculture especially

70
00:03:42,640 --> 00:03:49,599
following the european union

71
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:52,959
a common agriculture policy

72
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:56,000
that is being

73
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,280
put in place in

74
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,439
highlighting sustainability and

75
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:03,599
highlighting

76
00:04:00,439 --> 00:04:07,680
biodiversity and

77
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:11,840
actually very explicitly putting

78
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:16,639
in place incentives and objectives

79
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:20,639
to reach this in the way that

80
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
every kind of activity in agriculture

81
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,720
and food production

82
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:26,160
is going to be influenced by it over the

83
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,960
course of the next

84
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:33,360
five years the

85
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:34,240
policies that the european union puts in

86
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:36,960
place

87
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,440
matter worldwide because of how big a

88
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:40,400
market

89
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:42,080
it uh represents both in terms of how it

90
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:46,000
produces food to be

91
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:50,720
consumed inside or for export

92
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:53,759
or its import of food from from outside

93
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:58,160
and the size of the market

94
00:04:53,759 --> 00:05:02,000
also makes it so that the producers

95
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:05,280
of technologies and components

96
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:08,240
in europe or outside of the

97
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,120
europe that serve the european market

98
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:12,800
are

99
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:14,240
um able to to leverage that size in

100
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,919
order to

101
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:20,960
achieve uh both their financial goals

102
00:05:17,919 --> 00:05:23,520
as well as to be able to develop new

103
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,720
products new services that otherwise

104
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,440
wouldn't be available so

105
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,960
just a few examples of the things that

106
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:34,080
that we are seeing that

107
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:37,280
are not only on the horizon but are

108
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,039
already in agricultural

109
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:44,160
practice today the ability to plow

110
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:47,520
at a depth that is much

111
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:50,720
shallower than before in order not to

112
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,960
disturb uh and not to

113
00:05:50,720 --> 00:05:58,080
diminish the fertility of the field

114
00:05:54,960 --> 00:06:01,919
the simultaneous

115
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:05,039
laying of tubes

116
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:08,400
underground at a depth that

117
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:11,680
is deeper than than the plowing depth

118
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:15,360
uh in order to irrigate the field

119
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:18,319
uh with the right quantities

120
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:20,160
of water enriched with the kind of

121
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:24,960
nutrients that the particular

122
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:28,639
plant needs exactly where

123
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:33,520
it is needed because of

124
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:36,960
both satellite-based and drone-based

125
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:41,280
monitoring of plant growth

126
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:45,199
through data analysis and integration

127
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:50,160
based on multi-spectral

128
00:06:45,199 --> 00:06:54,000
imaging the opportunity

129
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:55,599
is really enormous already the existing

130
00:06:54,000 --> 00:07:00,720
practices

131
00:06:55,599 --> 00:07:04,560
can improve farm productivity

132
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:08,319
double digits 10 20 and more

133
00:07:04,560 --> 00:07:11,440
while um diminishing

134
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:14,479
drastically uh the use of water

135
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:18,240
uh the um uh weight

136
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:21,680
uh the pressure of food production

137
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:26,400
on the fertility of terrain

138
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:30,240
and of course um quite substantially

139
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:35,039
diminishing also the use of chemicals

140
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,479
that that are the traditional

141
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,599
fertilizers or pesticides

142
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:44,080
which contributed importantly

143
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,560
in our ability to increase the level of

144
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:50,639
food production we have today but

145
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:53,840
where uh they are now being

146
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,800
labeled or recognized as uh

147
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:58,639
undesirable uh beyond a certain

148
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:02,560
necessary level

149
00:07:58,639 --> 00:08:04,879
the next stages of agricultural

150
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:09,280
revolution again will come from

151
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:14,400
technology imagine vertical farming

152
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:17,840
that can be above ground or below ground

153
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:21,039
that is proportional to the volume

154
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:23,360
of uh the uh farm

155
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,280
rather than the area of the field

156
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:29,199
available

157
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:32,560
the availability of plant-based

158
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,680
meat substitutes that are being

159
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:40,240
adopted and appreciated by consumers

160
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:43,519
already or actually a

161
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:47,600
cultivated meat of animal

162
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:50,800
origin obtained by cell cultures

163
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
rather than growing an entire

164
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:56,080
traditional

165
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:59,279
animal these are just two examples

166
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:00,560
uh but also advanced techniques like uh

167
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,240
crispr

168
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:08,240
in our ability to intervene

169
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:10,959
and improve the

170
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:12,160
basic crops and and the basic

171
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:15,519
ingredients

172
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:15,519
of our food chain

173
00:09:15,680 --> 00:09:22,240
there are uh obstacles uh

174
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:26,240
for example in italy today

175
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:29,760
you cannot apply uh pesticides

176
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:33,839
via drones uh which practice

177
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:37,760
would be able to diminish the quality

178
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:41,680
put out quite radically

179
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:44,720
because flying a drone even if applied

180
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:48,240
small camp quantity is very precisely

181
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:50,240
because it flies a meter or two meters

182
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,200
above ground is

183
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:58,880
equated to blasting the crops

184
00:09:55,200 --> 00:10:01,760
with traditional spraying from planes

185
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,800
and that is prohibited and as a

186
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,959
consequence

187
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:11,440
the use of drones is also prohibited

188
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:15,519
or other examples where

189
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:20,959
the regulations

190
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:24,399
are not um aligning the incentives

191
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,160
in actually delivering the desired

192
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,279
outcome

193
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:31,279
large quantities of healthy food in

194
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,800
great variety

195
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:38,160
with as little environmental pressure as

196
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:42,240
possible across not only europe

197
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,320
but the world and then of course

198
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:50,480
the most radical of food production

199
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:54,320
practices are going to be on the moon

200
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:57,920
and the mars and the asteroid belt

201
00:10:54,320 --> 00:11:01,200
environments where well you cannot

202
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:05,200
grow corn or feed

203
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:09,440
a cow with the corn that you grew

204
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:13,279
you cannot waste water you cannot

205
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:14,160
have almost any of the things that we

206
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:18,000
are accustomed

207
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:20,480
to have on earth the

208
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:21,600
total not only radical but total

209
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,120
sustainability

210
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,000
practices that moon colonies and mars

211
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,440
colonies

212
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,160
are going to have will be not only

213
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,399
advanced

214
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,120
but very valuable and earth agriculture

215
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:37,920
is going to be profoundly influenced by

216
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:42,240
those

217
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:46,000
practices that mars will be happy

218
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:48,720
to sell to earth and consult and advise

219
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:51,440
on their implementation in the best

220
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:55,120
possible way

221
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:58,320
the agricultural sector

222
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,120
uh something that i am not very familiar

223
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
with

224
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:06,079
uh except eating food

225
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,560
and for me it was a pleasure to

226
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:10,320
start this collaboration with the think

227
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:14,079
tank farm to fork

228
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:17,120
and i am looking forward

229
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:20,720
to the next meeting i am looking forward

230
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:24,079
to interact both with the providers

231
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:26,480
of these exciting interesting existing

232
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:27,839
already being deployed agricultural

233
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:31,760
technologies

234
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:35,279
as well as uh with the the farmers

235
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:38,399
that are the heart

236
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:41,680
and and really the the passion

237
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:44,880
that they put in uh their work of

238
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:48,560
uh what they produce

239
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:51,120
and we eat thank you very much

240
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,170
and see you in the next episode of the

241
00:12:51,120 --> 00:13:08,879
context
