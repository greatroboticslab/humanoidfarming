00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
hi this is jonathan rotz field

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:04,880
agronomist with pioneer today i want to

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:05,920
talk with you a little bit about cover

4
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,680
crops

5
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:09,280
now it's early spring and that means

6
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:12,000
we're all getting ready for another

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:13,280
great year another great growing season

8
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,200
and one of the things that we think

9
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,680
about this time of year is preparing

10
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,680
that field whether that be tillage or

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,840
for a lot of my guys that are no-till

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,760
it's thinking about cover crops in this

13
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,760
field we have some really nice growth on

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,680
our cover crops and some might think

15
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,119
about terminating but actually a fair

16
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,279
amount of folks are learning that maybe

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,120
this isn't the best thing to do now most

18
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,680
of us understand the benefits of cover

19
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,440
crops soil conservation is a huge thing

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,040
we've had this field covered all winter

21
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,120
long which means it's held the soil

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,520
there and it's kept everything in place

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:45,120
from erosion and wind erosion as well

24
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:46,800
but there's lots of other benefits as

25
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,480
well one thing we never want to forget

26
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:50,320
about cover crops is that great root

27
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,559
mass that's under the surface there's a

28
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,719
tremendous amount of biomass here and

29
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,480
not only do we have that biomass that's

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
creating carbon and everything else

31
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,879
underground it's also creating a

32
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,399
tremendous amount of soil structure

33
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,239
think about all this structure

34
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,400
underneath some of it being brought to

35
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,159
you by the roots alone other some of the

36
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:09,920
fungi and other things that are growing

37
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,240
on that root and the structure that they

38
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:14,479
can create and promote that biomass

39
00:01:12,240 --> 00:01:16,320
gives us the ability to to run across

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,479
this field without having compaction and

41
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,360
other things like that plus to put a lot

42
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,320
of carbon or organic matter down into

43
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,759
that soil another great part about this

44
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:27,520
is the reduction of weeds that you're

45
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,280
not going to have near the competition

46
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,200
early spring that you have to deal with

47
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,920
as you would in a fallow or an open

48
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,600
field biological activity is a huge part

49
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,520
of our cover cropping system and as we

50
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:39,280
keep something live and growing there's

51
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:41,520
a tremendous amount of biology that

52
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:44,320
continues late into the fall and early

53
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,000
spring as our soils warm up now again

54
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
some folks might think about this and

55
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:50,479
look at it and say boy it's really time

56
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:52,640
to go out and determinate that crop but

57
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,560
let's think for a moment that all of the

58
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
things that we just mentioned the soil

59
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,880
conservation the organic matter building

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,360
all the biological

61
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:03,759
activity including also that nutrient

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:06,399
retention and release is going to only

63
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,879
be benefited as we allow that cover crop

64
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,200
to grow longer and longer

65
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:13,360
i always say farmers should always think

66
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:15,440
about trying to harvest as much sunlight

67
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,680
as possible that's true in our crops and

68
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,319
it's true in our cover crops as well

69
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
as we allow this plant to grow

70
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:24,560
through the process of photosynthesis

71
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,400
that plant is bringing carbon dioxide in

72
00:02:24,560 --> 00:02:28,080
and releasing oxygen

73
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:29,760
where did that carbon go

74
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,519
it went right into the soil either

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:33,599
through our roots and things like that

76
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:35,760
or once we do terminate this plant all

77
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,640
the carbon that it has sequestered is

78
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
going to turn into organic matter into

79
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,239
that soil

80
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,879
also don't forget when we talk about

81
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,200
organic matter not only is that good for

82
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:49,519
the soil but it also increases our

83
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:51,519
nutrient holding capacity and increases

84
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:53,440
our water holding capacity over time as

85
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,640
we increase that organic matter in the

86
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,400
soil and that's great for our operation

87
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,400
now another benefit that maybe we don't

88
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:02,159
always think about but there might even

89
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,040
be potential to gain revenue from this

90
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,200
crop as well for instance if you have

91
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:09,840
changed a practice you may even be

92
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:12,239
eligible for corteva's carbon incentive

93
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,400
things like brand new to cover cropping

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,720
new to no-till maybe you're trying your

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,040
hand with a grass and a legume versus a

96
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,840
straight grass what about allowing that

97
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:24,000
cover crop to grow longer or maybe even

98
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:25,760
establishing it earlier in the fall

99
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,280
if you have anything like that going on

100
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:29,840
on your farm you may want to talk with

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:32,000
your granular digital business manager

102
00:03:29,840 --> 00:03:33,760
for more information

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,760
another big thing i'm talking to guys

104
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,400
about this year that's a huge benefit to

105
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,760
allowing our cover crop to grow is the

106
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,519
fact that we don't have as much

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:43,120
glyphosate in the marketplace as what we

108
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,280
would like to have

109
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:46,959
some guys are fairly tight on on their

110
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:51,440
supplies and we know some of these cover

111
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:53,760
crops can be fairly hard to to terminate

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,840
so what would it look like to instead of

113
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,319
burning it down now and then coming back

114
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:00,959
and maybe needing another application uh

115
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:03,200
closer to planting or post-planting what

116
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,879
about just going in and planting green

117
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,959
and then applying

118
00:04:04,879 --> 00:04:09,040
now that brings me to this whole idea of

119
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,519
planting green that's going to be what

120
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,439
this field has done but i'll throw a few

121
00:04:11,519 --> 00:04:15,920
cautions out for you just in case you're

122
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:17,040
thinking about this and are new to it

123
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:18,720
first off

124
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,519
typically when we think about planting

125
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:23,360
green thick stands are not the best for

126
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:25,759
us for that planting

127
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,680
anything around a bushel of rye and as

128
00:04:25,759 --> 00:04:29,759
you get above that a bushel of rye is

129
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:31,680
great as you get above that you're

130
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,840
probably going to get so thick if you

131
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:35,680
let your cover get really large that it

132
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:38,479
may be a challenge to get planted into

133
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:40,320
and have that seed slot closed correctly

134
00:04:38,479 --> 00:04:41,040
the other thing is is not all planters

135
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:43,040
are

136
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:44,960
created equal whenever you think about

137
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,040
planting green make sure that your

138
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:48,800
planter is set up in a sense that you

139
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,479
can go in and make sure that you get a

140
00:04:48,800 --> 00:04:52,320
good planting in that

141
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,400
if you're unsure there's lots of folks

142
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,479
that have been in and doing this for a

143
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:59,199
good while go ahead and reach out to one

144
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,880
of them and talk with them a little bit

145
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:02,479
the other thing i always tell with guys

146
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,400
is to always think about starting with

147
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:07,199
small changes if you're new to cover

148
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,919
cropping think about planting early

149
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,919
or maybe terminating early or at least

150
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,680
only play with planting green on some of

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,440
those early planted acres where your

152
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:16,240
cover crop is not going to be nearly as

153
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:17,680
big

154
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:19,759
now one thing that i'm going to do is

155
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,680
we're going to return to this operation

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,199
probably even this field

157
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,720
throughout the planting and growing

158
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:27,280
season and we're going to watch some of

159
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,800
this in action so stay tuned

160
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,479
now if you want more information about

161
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,479
this don't hesitate to reach out to your

162
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,479

employee for more information about the

164
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,320
carbon incentive that i talked about

165
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,160
talk with your local granule granular

166
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:41,840
