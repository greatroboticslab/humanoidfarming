3
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:25,359
Across the globe, water is fast becoming

4
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,920
a precious commodity as more and more

5
00:00:25,359 --> 00:00:30,800
people use water for the household,

6
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:33,640
industry, and agriculture.

7
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:36,000
Rice uses up the most amount of water in

8
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:38,960
agriculture with almost half of the

9
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:41,960
world's population depending on rice as

10
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:45,200
their staple food. By

11
00:00:41,960 --> 00:00:48,079
2025, 15 to 20 million hectares of

12
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,719
irrigated rice fields may suffer from

13
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,920
water scarcity.

14
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:56,160
To address this problem, scientists have

15
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:59,840
developed a technique called alternate

16
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:03,680
wetting and drying or AWD, which uses

17
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:06,320
less water to grow rice. AWD is a

18
00:01:03,680 --> 00:01:09,119
water-saving technology that lowland

19
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,159
rice farmers can apply to reduce water

20
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:14,960
use in irrigated

21
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:17,119
fields. In AWD, the rice field is

22
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,320
allowed to dry for a number of days

23
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:23,400
before being flooded again. Hence, the

24
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:26,159
field is alternately flooded and left

25
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,799
dry. The number of days that the field

26
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:31,840
can be left dry depends on the soil type

27
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
and other field

28
00:01:33,400 --> 00:01:39,360
conditions. A practical way of applying

29
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:42,439
AWD is by observing the depth of water

30
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:46,159
in the field using a field water

31
00:01:42,439 --> 00:01:48,159
tube. After irrigation, water level will

32
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,560
gradually decrease.

33
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:54,159
When the water level has dropped to 15

34
00:01:50,560 --> 00:01:57,560
cm below the soil surface, the field

35
00:01:54,159 --> 00:02:00,399
should be reflooded to a depth of 5

36
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:04,320
cm. Allowing the water in the field to

37
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:07,200
drop to 15 cm below the soil surface

38
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:08,720
before irrigating again is called safe

39
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:12,239
AWD.

40
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:14,800
The 15 cm limit will not cause any yield

41
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,200
decline since the roots of the rice

42
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:20,160
plants will be able to take up water

43
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,280
from the saturated soil and the perched

44
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,840
water level in the surface. The field

45
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:28,400
water tube helps farmers see the hidden

46
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,760
source of water.

47
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:34,400
Safe AWD irrigation can be started a few

48
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,840
days after transplanting or when the

49
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:41,040
directseed rice crop is already 10 cm

50
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,519
tall until first heading. When many

51
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,959
weeds are present in the early stages of

52
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:49,599
crop growth, safe AWD can be postponed

53
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:52,400
for 2 to 3 weeks until the weeds have

54
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:55,120
been suppressed by the ponded water.

55
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:59,000
Local fertilizer recommendations for

56
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:01,920
flooded rice can be used. Apply nitrogen

57
00:02:59,000 --> 00:03:04,720
fertilizer preferably on the dry soil

58
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,720
just before

59
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:10,400
irrigation. A week before to a week

60
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:13,599
after the peak of flowering. Water

61
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:16,239
should be kept at a 5 cm depth to avoid

62
00:03:13,599 --> 00:03:18,920
water stress which could result in

63
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:22,400
potentially severe yield

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,360
loss. After flowering and during grain

65
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:31,040
filling, apply safe AWD

66
00:03:26,360 --> 00:03:35,040
again. In safe AWD, water savings may be

67
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,080
relatively small about 15 to 25% but

68
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,440
there is no yield penalty.

69
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:43,840
Once farmers are confident that safe AWD

70
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:46,080
does not reduce yield, they can

71
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:50,799
experiment by lowering the threshold

72
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:52,360
level to 20, 25, 30 cm depth or even

73
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,429
deeper before

[Music]

75
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:01,439
irrigation. The field water tube can be

76
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,680
made of a plastic pipe or bamboo or

77
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:07,200
other indigenous materials that will

78
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,560
help farmers see water below the soil.

79
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:14,239
Cut these materials to a 40 cm length

80
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:16,560
with a diameter of 15 cm or more to

81
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:20,239
easily see the water level inside the

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:23,080
tube. The bottom 20 cm length of the

83
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:26,000
tube should be drilled with holes on all

84
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:31,600
sides. Holes should have a diameter of

85
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:33,680
about 0.5 cm each and spaced about 2 cm

86
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:36,889
away from one another.

[Music]

88
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,080
The tube can be placed on the side of

89
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:47,479
the field close to the bond, but not

90
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:50,080
less than a meter away for easier

91
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,199
monitoring. Bury the tube vertically

92
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:55,680
into the soil so that 20 cm or half of

93
00:04:53,199 --> 00:04:58,639
its length protrudes above the soil

94
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,800
surface. Take care not to penetrate

95
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:03,600
through the bottom of the plow pan or

96
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:06,720
hard pan, which is a dense layer of soil

97
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:08,960
that is largely resistant to water.

98
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:11,080
Remove the soil inside the tube so that

99
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:13,520
the bottom of the tube is

100
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:15,759
visible. Check that the water level

101
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:19,400
inside the tube is the same as that

102
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,400
outside the tube.

103
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,600
Alternate wetting and drying or AWD is

104
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:29,120
already a mature technology that can be

105
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:32,080
readily used by farmers. The field water

106
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:34,479
tube is a very simple tool that guides

107
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,960
farmers to effectively and efficiently

108
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:39,160
manage their limited irrigation water

109
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:41,919
for their rice crop.

110
00:05:39,160 --> 00:05:44,000
However, farmers can only truly

111
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:47,199
appreciate the benefits and water

112
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:49,680
savings from AWD if adoption of this

113
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:54,199
promising technology is done at the

114
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:54,199
community or system level.
