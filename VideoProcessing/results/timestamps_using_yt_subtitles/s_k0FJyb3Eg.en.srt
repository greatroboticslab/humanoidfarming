1
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:48,840
1 minute 1 minute 1 minute

2
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:59,079
one so we are at the bungu site this is

3
00:00:54,079 --> 00:01:00,519
the hungu itself and we will have bab G

4
00:00:59,079 --> 00:01:02,559
and

5
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,439
the owner of this one of the owners of

6
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,439
this Buu explained this to us

7
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
now

8
00:01:32,280 --> 00:01:38,880
so so bab G just can we can you I mean

9
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:41,360
for this you just quickly explain what

10
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,840
the bungu itself is technically so that

11
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:45,600
you know it's a good introduction to the

12
00:01:42,840 --> 00:01:47,880
whole video very brief one how it drains

13
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,719
the water and what it does okay Buu is a

14
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,680
very simple technology where whatever

15
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:55,240
the water is getting locked on the STP

16
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:57,680
soil we inject it in the underground

17
00:01:55,240 --> 00:01:59,360
take it to the region where the water

18
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,280
density is higher than the top water

19
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,759
density water loing water density and

20
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,640
release of water so the land get water

21
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,479
logging free as well as same underground

22
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:10,640
water which have injected earlier lift

23
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:14,200
it back do the winter irrigation this

24
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:16,360
simple okay so this is one bongu yeah so

25
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:18,519
the B the injection of the water happens

26
00:02:16,360 --> 00:02:20,720
through that Central bore and what we

27
00:02:18,519 --> 00:02:23,319
see around it is for the water get to

28
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:26,080
get filtered before it gets injected

29
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:26,080
perfect

30
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,760
huhu or or or

31
00:02:45,320 --> 00:02:48,400
[Music]

32
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:01,760
speech

33
00:03:24,680 --> 00:03:28,879
B basically he's she's talking of water

34
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:30,480
logging and water injection process

35
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,599
she's staining at at least this amount

36
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:34,200
of water comes in the initial period

37
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:36,239
then it comes up with this level of

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,319
initial as the monsoon progress Monsoon

39
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:40,319
progress and it gets refill three or

40
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:42,560
four times so so much of water goes

41
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,920
inside and the catchment area for this

42
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:47,200
bungu is catchment area of this bungu

43
00:03:44,920 --> 00:03:49,720
still the Revol channel so it is more

44
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,000
than 20 acres okay more than 20 acres

45
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:54,799
land okay and this 20 acres land is

46
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:57,000
collectively owned by the seven b seven

47
00:03:54,799 --> 00:04:00,000
no irrigation is taking place for 50 ACR

48
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:02,239
50 V of 20 acres of land yeah 50 V seven

49
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,680
women together all all below poverty

50
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:06,120
line Omen okay okay and this is the

51
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,439
first time they're doing this igation

52
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:11,040
earlier they are going for the migration

53
00:04:08,439 --> 00:04:12,720
work now this time they're doing last

54
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:17,439
whenever they got they go for the

55
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,439
Iration okay so AB

56
00:04:28,600 --> 00:04:31,600
your

57
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:40,320
speech

58
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:48,120
IGN speech speech for speech

59
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:56,080
speeech

60
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,560
speech

61
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:11,560
so they have a alternative

62
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:16,800
system every seventh day you get the

63
00:05:13,880 --> 00:05:18,600
your turn so whatever the crop they have

64
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:20,600
decided based upon that they decide upon

65
00:05:18,600 --> 00:05:21,680
the irrigation process and also ter of

66
00:05:20,600 --> 00:05:24,520
the irrigation duration of the

67
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,160
irrigation then one by one by one go 7

68
00:05:24,520 --> 00:05:28,479
you get the once second but they all

69
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,919
discuss that and collectively

70
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:35,120
AR

71
00:05:30,919 --> 00:05:35,120
everyone sit together and decide upon it

72
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,290
[Music]

73
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,440
okay she thinks so much of water if you

74
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:52,240
can give us more machine we can irrigate

75
00:05:50,440 --> 00:05:54,720
so much of land over here there's so

76
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:57,720
much of potential over

77
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,720
here

78
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:03,160
okay so this year this is uh how many

79
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:05,520
years since they've been

80
00:06:03,160 --> 00:06:08,599
using fourth year running this is the

81
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:10,960
fourth year this is the fourth year what

82
00:06:08,599 --> 00:06:13,120
is the key difference for them before

83
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:13,120
and

84
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:32,639
afteru okay before Buu there was no

85
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,240
income level for them they're migrating

86
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:37,360
now he has not only Buu has done she is

87
00:06:35,240 --> 00:06:39,000
also irating as well as she got two

88
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:41,759
animals animal

89
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,639
as animal as Buffalo she got and she got

90
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,960
another two B so four animals here she

91
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:48,919
got that's a huge income for each animal

92
00:06:45,960 --> 00:06:50,759
is at Le 50,000 okay and and what are

93
00:06:48,919 --> 00:06:53,039
the different crops they are now going

94
00:06:50,759 --> 00:06:55,960
in this 20 acres can she list that out

95
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:55,960
for us what are

96
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,400
theop

97
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:14,240
she's talking of wheat

98
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:17,240
Castor cumin isub sua grass and wheat

99
00:07:14,240 --> 00:07:19,560
okay okay total seven CR okay so quickly

100
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,639
if you can add in these details there's

101
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,319
one diesel engine and a pump here that

102
00:07:22,639 --> 00:07:29,000
extracts the water how many HP is this

103
00:07:25,319 --> 00:07:31,120
diesel engine 8 HP 8 HP and this pump so

104
00:07:29,000 --> 00:07:33,240
around how much diesel is used for all

105
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:34,759
the pumping in a season in one season

106
00:07:33,240 --> 00:07:36,000
approximately approximately cost us

107
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:38,680
20,000 to

108
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:41,319
35,000 the diesel diesel cost diesel

109
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:43,720
cost so that's how many liters are uh

110
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:46,039
depending on divide by 50 45 something

111
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:48,479
like that okay that's it okay for one

112
00:07:46,039 --> 00:07:53,720
season for around 20 acres for for 20

113
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,720
acres yeah okay okay thanks

114
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
bip
