  "text": "about 3 years ago I bought the paperpot transplanter system to use in my no till deep compost mulch Market Garden the first time I used a paper pot transplanter it was for beets and I threw the tray in the trees back there I was pissed I couldn't believe I spent $3,000 on this thing and the first time I used it wasn't burying them the the plants were getting twisted around each other basically it was Beats so like as the Paper Pot transplanter unraveled they were a little bit leggy and it just tore the plants apart it was a complete disaster but my friend Paul from Mountain Roots Farm has been a good Mentor to me over the years called him talked to him about it I was like man this thing sucks like what the heck and he's like ah yeah man you just got to keep practicing right like it's a tool and it takes system there has to be some sort of soil work to get the tool to work properly I I suppose everybody's going to have different soil conditions but in this video I'm going to show you the exact system that I use to use the Paper Pot transplanter in a no till deep compost mulch system so in my last video I showed you guys how I start seedlings in my basement under grow lights using the quick click drop seeder into the paper pot transplanter system so these are the same seedlings it's a couple weeks later now and today we're going to transplant these into my noil garden and I'm just going to show you the whole process and how it works in my system they've been sitting out here for about 2 weeks now leaving them sit out here for a couple of weeks before I actually plant them into the garden helps them to harden off so that they'll survive when I plant them it has to be soaking wet or else when you like start to use the transplanter and pull it these paper chains are just going to rip so you want to saturate the whole tray in water before you plant it and that's something that like nobody ever told me before I used it the first time I used the Paper Pot transplanter I just took my tray and then I tried to transplant it and they just kept ripping the whole way down and I couldn't find any good resources to tell me why but I learned that that's why you have to saturate the whole TR in water and the way that I do that this is like a 18x 26 in uh commercial cookie sheet basically but it just happens to fit these Paper Pot trays perfectly so I just sit the trays in that and then I fill it up with water and then I just let them bottom water and soak all that water up and it doesn't take long these things soak the water up super fast and so I'll just let that sit there and soak up the water while I get everything set up with the transplanter to plant and then we'll come back and grab that in a minute so then the typical bed flip method that I'm using is we clean out the previous crop I String up the beds to keep the beds straight and looking nice we broad for the beds so we put about three wheelbarrows of compost on every bed flip that we're going to use the pap poot transplanter next on and then I used the never syn icono class tilter to smooth out that top layer of compost so it's never actually like tilling the soil at all it just like gets all the chunks out of the compost sometimes it's chunky and those chunks will get like jammed up in the furrow the Paper Pot transplant so you need to make sure that your compost is nice broken down and fine or it's going to cause you problems you can't have rocks in there and then after we tilt it then we come through with just a regular like garden rake that you would use to rake your garden with leaves and we make it nice and smooth so we make kind of a raised nice smooth planting bed at a compost while never actually tilling the soil and we use a broad Fork to just make sure that the soil is not compacted I find that the broad Fork uh just kind of helps the furrow get through the compost and be able to just kind of barely dig into the actual native soil so that the roots are getting into the soil but then the actual plants are just like kind of planted through the compost and then it grows down through the compost into the native soil and the compost basically just a mulch on top of the soil and then generally after we'll Harvest a bed like that like these were Paper Pot transplanted right right and then we've got two rows of Salen NOA lettuce on the sides of tomatoes once these beds are terminated we'll just uh not broad fork or anything and just plant arugula probably we'll just direct seed arugula and then so that's kind of like the bed prep system we broad fork and apply new compost whenever we're going to be using the paper pot transplanter and then those beds are are good because the next crops we're not going to be planting salanova lettuce over and over in the same beds we're going to be doing like a rugula or spinach or tomatoes or whatever the next crop is it doesn't require the Paper Pot transplanter so we're really only broad forking if we're using the paperpot transplanter just kind of make sure that we're breaking up the compaction because I just find if I don't then I regret it you just need to do the proper bed prep basically but then you have to have your plants or your seedlings like exactly the right size there's a perfect size so for me I start my trays of salanova lettuce and that's basically the only crop I'm using a paper pot transplanter for I don't really find it to be profitable for a lot of other things cuz there's a huge cost you don't want to use a Pap poot transplanter if they're too small wheels like bury the furrow it like will bury the plant but then if they're too big the bottom sides of the tray The Roots will get tangled with each other so when you drag it the roots are not letting it unravel correctly so while it does transplant well like that because the furrow can close the overgrown seedling in a little bit it won't unravel well so it pops up out so all I do is just kind of you have to like them apart and like kind of stage them and then I can pull it and then it's not really a big deal and it goes pretty fast like that but it's like it took me some time to learn that and that's something that nobody really talks about on YouTube videos I just was left to kind of learn these things by myself and observation and there's adjustments on the tool to adjust it up and down you can adjust the the wheels you have to fool with the adjustments on like the depth of how deep you're planting it how it berries the seedlings after they're transplanted into the furrow and that's going to be different for everybody's soil conditions I have mine set up so I just leave it the same I don't fool with it but it took a lot of fooling with to get it just right I had a bed of cilantro which had been Paper Pot transplanted so I just went and like cleaned out the whole bed of cilantro I left like the roots and everything right in the ground so I just like cut the bottoms off cleared out the bed I didn't put any additional compost or anything and I just tried to drag the paperpot transplanter through but it didn't work very good because it get caught on the roof RO system of the cilantro to use the paper pot transplanter after a crop like cilantro didn't work very good for me cilantro just has like a really big root system but for me to like use the paper pot transplanter after I harvest the bed of carrots like that's ideal right",
