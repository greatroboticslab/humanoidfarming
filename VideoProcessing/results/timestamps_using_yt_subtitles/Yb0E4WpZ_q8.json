  "text": "we have our next presenter WJ I'm sorry Justin seon he is a nutritionist beef nutrition extensionist at mu and he's coming to you to talk about gracing W use in beef production systems please welcome Justin move that out of the way good morning and and so the uh the title of my talk is related to grazing wed use and beef production systems and and the primary reason that it is related to beef is because that's what I do but it certainly is applicable to multiple species of livestock and and we'll talk a bit about that uh as we go forward and and so just I guess a kind of the way to start is what is a grazing wedge and and so the grazing wedge is a concept that was uh kind of started in the grazing dairies specifically in the in the southwestern part of of Missouri where we look at our forage inventory in a visual system and and so the grazing wedge kind of what I would say is simply explained is that this is a visual illustration of a collection of pastures and so I I use this as an illustration and and maybe it's not a great one because you might be looking to say 58 pastures this is way more than I need to to kind of think about but but just stay with me and I'll show you some more uh applied examples here in a minute but function what the grazing wedge does is we go out and we inventory our forage with something as simple as a yard stick or as complex as a sonar reader on the front of a four-wheeler and and so from a technology standpoint you can use a yard stick or a grazing stick in this case you can use a rising plate meter uh either digital or manual or you can get a sonar amounted uh deal for the front of your um four-wheeler and and Dr Colin Bach one of my colleagues is is actually working on being able to take pictures using Google Earth to take forage inventory and and so the technology is uh fairly diverse I guess is the way I would say it but the grazing wedge gives us a visual picture of our forage inventory and and so it's it's kind of a um u a stoplight system in that once our our pasture in this case turns red we've gotten to the point where that pasture from a quality standpoint is too mature and if we keep our pasture gure in the green area then we have optimized forage quality and then when we get it into the yellow that is the point where we have overgrazed it and that's based off of measurements that we're taking as infrequently as uh once a month ideally what we would like to see is about every 10 to 14 days and so a bit of background as it relates to this program is it it's part of a sustainable agriculture research and education grant research and educ ation specifically and we have producer Cooperators that collected a lot of this data and we've we've developed these producer groups that are centered around these producers that use their forage growth data as kind of indicator values throughout the grazing season I'll show you that in a minute okay and so the the idea behind the the grazing wedge is OB objective pasture Management in that many people have implemented rotational grazing systems but many times we rotate through those systems systems in a pattern that maybe is convenient but not best from a forage management standpoint do we always start with south facing slopes in the early in the season or do we start with the one that's closest to the barn and so this allows us to look at pasture from a standpoint of growth and seasonal growth and try to best utilize it we measure and monitor that over the uh over the the entire pure season but really what we found through this work with the with the producers is that first pass through the past sets it for the rest of the year if you do a good job of pasture Management in May the rest of the year is very easy or specifically late April I should say but uh once once that reproductive plant portion has been taken off at the beginning the pasture is kind of set for the rest of the year and so if you want to think about that from an applied standpoint what's the best pasture that you'll see all year long it was largely cut as hay right uniformly grazed in theory and and so that regrowth we don't have any stems or or reproductive tillers that we see later on in the season so how do we set up a management system that addresses that goal at the end the other thing is it helps us to address which forage should we use next and and this I apologize doesn't show up real well with the amount of light but but one of the things to think about is if you go through and and graze a system and and let's say you have an eight pasture system right and and so you've set up some sort of grazing system early in the spring you'll go through and and graze a pasture and and about miday it looks really good right it looks really good it's been nothing but regrowth and then you have some pasture that looks similar to this over here where you start to see reproductive uh or seed heads start to produce and and so you say well I need to go graze this because I haven't been there yet right that's that's the next pasture to go to and I haven't been there yet but in reality what I want we used the grazing wedge just to challenge producers to stay this is the part of the farm that we should be making hay on because it's already too mature for the growing stock that we have in place and this is ideal in terms of forage quality and once forage goes bad or gets mature goes to the red part on the grazing wedge it's already mature it'll take the cattle longer to get through this more mature material and in the end this stuff starts to get overgrown and so from a management standpoint that's part of the question that we try to address with a grazing wedge and so when we started this is uh Denny and Mary Beth poges grazing wedge that uh we started in 2010 and this was uh the 23rd of May and this is kind of the visual image that when you when you take those forage quality measurement or those forage inventory measurements you get a visual display of your pasture and so these are each of their pastures that are labeled and and so what we see in a lot of beef Enterprise systems is we we start to push a lot of forage ahead into the summer right and and so beef systems are inherently more tolerant of poorer quality forage the biggest question that we get from beef producers is I need more forage it's not forage quality that we run out of I need more forage this year probably more so than ever and so the Dare or the grazing wedge was actually started in the dairy system and the dairy system they're highly aware of forage quality and so one of the things that we set out to do was just try to see how this worked with a beef production model and one of the first things that we observed was that we see a lot of our beef producers maintain a lot more forage specifically at this 3500 lbs and of uh of growth more so than our Dairy who much like it to be under 3,000 lb more about 2750 and and so to think to put that in a practical term you want forage in a beef production system to be about this the height of the eyeball on the cow that's when her head's down right when her head is down eyeball high is a good forage availability and quality uh guideline and if you can see her nose when her head is down you're in this yellow portion over here at overg grazed okay uh good Lord put a grazing stick on every cow between the eyeball in the nose Jim garish is actually credited with that concept but we're trying to put that on a visual perspective from a standpoint of how we can inventory our pastures and so the critical points in a grazing wedge this is the the 4 Farms grazing wedge on in the towards the end of June this year and what we want to do from a fertilizer and management standpoint is ideally we have a pasture that's being staged right along right when we get to the point where our pastures are all flat we we have a forid shortage coming and so this visual illustration that we we send out to these producers producers every two weeks or the producers submit every two weeks tells them that when they get to pasture 5 on a 21-day rotation if it falls below this line you need to start thinking about some sort of forage management system to meet the deficiency right and so this year it was great to kind of look at we started it wasn't great I'm I'm not glad we had a drought okay but it Illustrated the appropriateness of this where we start to see we start to see these uh pasture levels turning flat and we can start to make management decisions before hey prices get to $100 a ton and so it helps us from an inventory management standpoint and what we want to do is maintain forage quality here and make sure we don't overg graze it on the other end and so that's what we call the critical points as we think about interpreting the grazing wedge here's kind of how you can think about this is that when it's underneath the line I'm setting myself up for a forage deficiency going forward right if I can keep it above the line I've got enough forage that it's right at the eyeball high of the cow and this 1500 Line This is like thinking about how many bales of hay you have functionally in that I can graze it down to 1500 lb of dry matter and everything above it is forage on the stump and so it allows us to start calculating how much forage we have I visited with our livestock specialist this morning and this is something that going to go out and do right now this is the ideal time to go out and measure your forage CU it's not going to grow anymore the amount of forage that you have right now is what you're going to have available and so I can calculate how many days of forage I have out there and start to uh balance my supplementation needs going forward whether that's a supplement or hay fundamental concept as it relates to the grazing wedge is let's graze at to 1,400 lb of dry matter per acre on the first pass okay and and so that is a very tight system it it is extremely tight from a from a 4 height standpoint but that sets our pasture up just like running a hay Bine across that field and and the regrowth is going to be vegetative for the rest of the summer okay one of the things that we really struggle with is we have non-uniform grazing equals nonuniform regrowth and you've observed this out in the past years I I um I would assume is that around manure piles or urine spots we see this tall forage that those cattle never come back to and it's not because it's the manure pile per se but late in the season this is mature and they've got other vegetative forage to eat the rest of the year and so we want those cattle to be very aggressive the first pass through when the forage is very good and the manure piles are generally fairly loose and then we set up the season or set it up uh for the rest of the season this is some of the forage quality that we've observed in these grazing wedge systems and so I I like to show this line This is crude protein and the crude protein requirement of the beef cows right about here okay and so in terms of protein content management under this system provides more than adequate protein to those cows but maybe more importantly what we looked at is what is the fiber content of that forage and so from a from a productive standpoint what I want you to think about is a high bar on this chart is bad okay a high bar is fiber and fiber is is not highly digestible and a low bar here is indigestibility so the best way to illustrate this is what we observed is something that we we've uh told producers for a long time is if you want to maximize the Harvest of indigestible forage make your hay in July and the forage samples that we took under this system certify that is that the forage is not as digestible in July and August and we produce a high amount of fiber so F Focus excess forage harvest in April May and June and because we've used the grazing wedge we know what our forage inventory is going forward as well as a from a growth rate standpoint and and so from a second pass forage standpoint we think about how can we best utilize the forage if I say I want you to graze it to 3 in tall and you say that's pretty poor quality forage for a lactating cow and so what we want you to think about is well is there some replacement heers that could utilize that poor quality forage is there some dry cows that could utilize this poor quality forage to get it down to that, 1400 lb of dry matter and so I I like to show pictures of these are the groups of cattle or livestock that most people have standing around we have some late gestation cattle we have some early lactation cattle we have some cattle that are ready to be weaned and then we have a group of growing cattle or replacement heers and if you think about not a prioritization standpoint and that how do we match our forage grazing wedge to our cattle is that something that is pregnant and getting ready to Cal or lamb or kid whatever it is they have first priority of forage they get the first bite okay after that it's the lactating animal because if she doesn't have adequate condition at cing you'll never add condition to her unless you start carrying a feed bucket and so we we educated our producers such that we want these cows to get the green forest and then if we have some red Forge that we're not going to bail these are the type of cattle that we want to use that on because they have lower nutrient requirements so as you prioritize gestating cataler first early lactation cater second and these two groups are fairly flexible depending on your production goals and and so that was part of our educational component was matching it to the uh Forge Supply I like to show this in that if you bush hog pastures during the month of July that's not a product of the month of July it's a product of forage Management in April and May and that if if you're if you're cleaning up pastures in in uh May or in July sorry many times what has happened is that pasture got away from you in May and and if we can graze it appropriately April and May really focus our forage management efforts using these tools it it minimizes the amount of fuel and time that we have to spend cleaning up uh raising mistak so to speak the other thing that this uh system allows us to do and and I realize of one of the as a producer no one likes keeping records okay that's like the the number 20th thing that people like to do and so by entering these yield numbers you can actually determine we actually determine in the grazing wedge what the pasture yielded in grazable forage we look at it over time in terms of forage disappearance and so this is um Denny Po's pasture 2012 they've harvested anywhere from 2 to 3 tons per acre off of those pastures and that's based off of forage measurements that he's taken throughout the season every 14 to 21 days and that allows us to see that 5B and 4C are are maybe not as productive as 10e and so if I have to prioritize my fertilizer or I'm going to apply manure or something along those lines these are the two pastures that are perhaps most in need or I know that there's more water holding capacity maybe in 10e maybe that's in the bottom and so I'm going to put a higher level of nitrogen there because I know I get a response and so this allows us to look at our pastures objectively and see actually which pastures green up earlier in the spring as well without keeping records just as an inventory management standpoint okay and uh this may be a little small for those of VI in the back but at the end of the year we also print out a summary report and and so this is he uh has started taking uh taken measurements the 31st of March and took them all the way up to the 20th of October and this is 2012 and this is estimated growth rate and so one of the things I like to visit with producers that we've shown from this data is we'll grow three cows worth of feet a day the end of April and early May on one acre of ground and that the amount of feed that comes out early April and or late April and early may we can't stock for that there's no way we can stock to consume that amount of forage in a short period of time and so what we look at as we get down here into June and July we're growing four pounds of feed per acre per day okay and that's not a surprise but normally we would see this in the 25 to 30 lb range but this was 2012 and so it allows us to go back and say what was our pre grazing and postgrazing cover and and what hases that done to the long-term growth rate or or pasture health and can we maintain an average pasture cover around 2,300 lb and so it's a it's a recordkeeping system that is a product of an inventory management if we take those measurements this is all generated for you and you can look at your grazing season at uh at the end of the year and see what kind of growth rates you you received on each of these pastures and and the other thing that kind of indicates is what we call the key indicators and and this is where each of these producers who are kind of what I call our Sentinel producers they're posted on the internet you can look and I've shown the website several times but you can see where they're at relative to the state and what's going on and so in this case we see that we've got beef stalker cattle on the pasture the forage growth rates about 12 pounds an acre per day and those stalker cattle are being fed 7 and 3/4 of a pound of uh of grain or a pound of hay sorry and critical issues they make notes and so you can kind of see what's going on throughout the state and this one's weed control is working well one and A4 inches of rain yesterday total rain since the end of April 1.75 in and so the producers are commenting on what they're seeing locally and allows us to kind of use those as a as a as a guideline to what's going going out going on out in the state and as you find it if if you're interested in joining these groups it allows people to kind of say here's an indicator may not be current for me but it allows me to know what's going on relative to other locations this is the the one uh example that I think probably has the most value that we learn through working with producers is the fall inventory and that there's nothing worse than realizing that you don't have enough hay about the middle of February because there's not a lot of hay being produced in the middle of February and everybody else has realized that same thing at about that time and so from a cost standpoint as we went through the financial analysis of these operations is that how can I predict the amount of grazing days that I've got before I'm going to have to feed hay and then how much of that hay am I going to use kind of going forward and and so this is just a label of a bunch of pastures and this is the amount of dry matter that's available on the stump and and and so this is the amount of forage this is the amount of acres in each of those paddocks and then it calculates tons of feed available in each of those pastures and so you take how many cows you've got and how many tons of feed and then you can look at your hay Supply and match our forage availability with our intake hopefully such that you get to the point where as an inventory management tool inventory is one of the biggest challenges we face is that I don't want to spend more money than I have to because it's tied up in the hay right all year long until I need it again but I certainly don't want to have to pay two times for the hay because I ran short at the worst possible time of year and so we use this fall inventory in that as as something I would have you take home today is if you're not interested in the grazing wedge at all throughout the growing season the fall inventory component is as useful as anything to plan your winter feed needs and and so our feed and forage budgeting is essentially our stocking rate which is pounds of cattle times a percent body weight intake and then the utilization rate is what percentage your forage is used and during the growing season we're hoping that that's going to be somewhere in the 50 to 70% range in the dormant season it's a lot closer to 70% because they're going to they're going to utilize that we don't get a lot of regrowth and then how long can I graze you know if you if you think you've got 60 days of stockpile forage on hand that tells you you know about when you're going to start feeding hay and and it just allows you to better manage your inventory and if you know that you have 60 days of stockpiled forage and I've shown you kind of what the quality results are under that management system we're encouraging producers to think about that stockpile as a supplement as opposed to a um total diet intake and and so I explained that a bit in that people don't like buying feed many times but what we haven't thought about stockpile is as supplemental feed I'm going to put hay out but I'm going to strip graze a certain amount of forage so that that is the supplemental feed and and I can strip graze that because one of the first things that the producers will tell me as it relates to stockpiles like Justin if I had 70 more acres to stockpile I'd have more cows and that's a that's a valid statement but what I encourage people to do from an inventory standpoint is let's think about stockpiling some forage or even just using our fall growth most effectively by saying you know what I'm going to strip graze this off as a supplement I'm going to give you three days worth of supplemental grass and it it supplements our poor quality forage so the the biggest thing I wanted you to take away with is the grazing wedge gives you an opportunity to look at how you manage your grats from an inventory standpoint what we've kind of found through our visiting with producers is they do this for about two maybe 3 years and after that they get a pretty visual assessment of that system and they don't go out and maybe measure as much as they would normally but they'll go out and do that one measurement in the fall and and so it's kind of a growing process to learn how the forage quality is best managed relative to yield so with that I'll uh take any questions yes sir may sorry we have to you talked about um mowing the pasture in in May um could you hold off till June and bail it up you where you say it gets away from you could you so so relative to forage management one of the things that we we look for is that we're all trying to capture as much Sunshine as we can right our goal is to capture Sunshine we have soil and we have a photosynthetic leaf and how do we capture sunshine and so one of the challenges with letting that fore grow and get further mature is it starts to shade itself right and so if you think about where does grass not grow well under trees and so when it sends up a reproductive tiller or seed head it starts to shade the lower leaves and and the Dairy Producers have have gone to that uh three leaf grazing system there's only three live leaves on a Fescue plant the fourth one starts to die I will answer your question I'm just going through some background okay and and so one of the things we want to do is the sooner we can stop reproductive growth in that it shoots up one reproductive tiller okay one seed head and once that's cut off everything else is regrowth right and regrowth is our quality and so we're very aggressive at addressing that early on so that the sooner that we Harvest it the sooner it can start regrowing we have more moisture and cooler temperatures if we wait until June to go in and and take that closer then what we have is we don't have a lot of water available for rapid recovery and it's hotter when you mow pasture in the spring okay if you go in and hay pasture in the spring early in the spring like within 2 days it's it'll have a leaf out there like that youve when you get it off there you see that leaf that sticks out it's very quick in terms of its regrowth what we're trying to avoid is the shading as much as anything and that as it gets go ahead yeah so baage is their best option or or stock such that so one of the you know there's a there are a number of people that are what I call Hay haters right they think hay is the bane of of a pasture system and so one of the things we think about is on a fall caving system we keep those cavves around to help us manage that excess inventory of forage and then we sell those calves in June and and that relieves the amount of stocking rate such that a cows can go through the summer that's one option if you can't make hay in May what i bage is our best option and where we can make it wet think they bags anym you got buy one of bagging Mach yeah got to have a wrapper yeah no you can not you might try that but it won't be very successful well and and and so from a yeah those are hard to try do that as well but that's where you know maybe it's even a custom deal or manage your stocking rate stocking rate being the big one in that how do I match the forage that I have and most people you know stocking rate is the number one factor influencing the success of of a pasture system is that do you stack for 2012 stack stock for 2012 or do you stock for 2008 one of the wetest years that we've had and and the question is is it it depends and so how do I build flexibility into that system and what we found is many producers don't know how much forage they they can grow under a management system this gives us the opportunity to look at that as a uh forage growth rate and then we can start to put an animal system on it that's well matched uh grazing beef missouri.edu n",
