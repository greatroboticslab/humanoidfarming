western United States 85% of Wyoming is

considered rangeland one use we

5
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:18,400
frequently see on Range land is grazing

00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,320
by both domestic livestock and Wildlife

7
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,600
this grazing provided by rangelands is

8
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:24,640
critical for healthy animals but the

9
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:26,840
health of the rangelands must also be

10
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,320
considered when rangelands are grazed in

11
00:00:26,840 --> 00:00:31,439
a sustainable fashion rangeland plants

12
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,840
are able to grow grow and reproduce

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:36,480
soils are protected and the resource is

14
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:38,520
conserved for the future improper

15
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,680
grazing can lead to weat infestations

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,160
and soil erosion leading to A reduced

Forge base degraded rangelands can be

18
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,520
rehabilitated but recovery may take

19
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:49,960
years and inputs such as seaing or other

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:52,079
treatments can be

21
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:53,640
expensive because rangelands are so

22
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,480
critical for Wyoming's livestock and

23
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:57,960
