00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,720
Intro. Hey there, fellow farmers and

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:05,839
agriculture

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:08,639
enthusiasts. Ever wondered how those

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,480
neat hay bales end up in the field?

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:12,000
Well, you're in for a treat today

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:15,280
because we're diving into the world of

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:17,039
hay bailing. I'm your name and in this

8
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,680
video, we'll cover everything you need

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:21,279
to know about hay bailing. From the

10
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,160
equipment to the techniques and even

11
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:26,480
proper storage, we've got you covered.

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:29,519
So, grab your work gloves and let's get

13
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:31,519
started with hay bailing 101.

14
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,239
main content. Let's kick things off by

15
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,800
talking about the types of hay balor.

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,000
There are two main types, round balorers

17
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:42,079
and square bailers. Round bailers create

18
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,200
those big cylindrical bales you often

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:48,239
see in fields. They're great for large

20
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:50,320
scale operations and outdoor storage.

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,360
Square balers, on the other hand,

22
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:55,520
produce rectangular bales. These are

23
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:58,800
easier to stack and transport, making

24
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,280
them ideal for smaller farms. Each type

25
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,640
has its pros and cons, so choose based

26
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:06,680
on your specific needs. Now, let's walk

27
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,600
through the bailing process step by

28
00:01:06,680 --> 00:01:12,560
step. First, you need to cut the hay and

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,680
let it dry in the field. This usually

30
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,520
takes a few days, depending on the

31
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,000
weather. Once the hay is dry, it's time

32
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,759
to rake it into

33
00:01:19,000 --> 00:01:23,600
windrows. Windows are long lines of hay

34
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,640
that make it easier for the bor to pick

35
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:29,680
up. Next, you'll drive your tractor with

36
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,840
the bor attached over the windross. The

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:35,280
bor picks up the hay and compresses it

38
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:38,400
into bales. For round balor, the hay is

39
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:40,600
rolled into a cylinder. Square bailers

40
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:43,200
compress the hay into rectangular

41
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:46,399
shapes. Once the bail reaches the right

42
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:48,720
size, it's tied with twine or net wrap.

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:51,920
The bor then releases the finished bail

44
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:54,040
onto the field. After bailing, proper

45
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:56,720
storage is crucial to maintain hay

46
00:01:54,040 --> 00:01:59,159
quality. If you're storing round bales

47
00:01:56,720 --> 00:02:02,159
outside, place them on a well- drained

48
00:01:59,159 --> 00:02:03,000
area. Arrange them in rows with the flat

49
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,360
ends

50
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:08,239
touching. This helps shed water and

51
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:10,160
prevents moisture from seeping in. For

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,040
square bales, it's best to store them

53
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:15,680
indoors if possible. Stack them on

54
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,000
pallets to keep them off the ground.

55
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:21,040
Ensure good ventilation to prevent mold

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:24,080
growth. If you must store square bales

57
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,840
outside, cover them with a tarp. Make

58
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,400
sure the tarp doesn't touch the ground

59
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,920
to allow air

60
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:31,879
circulation. Now, let's talk about some

61
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,239
common bailing issues you might

62
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:37,360
encounter. One frequent problem is

63
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,800
uneven bales. This can happen if you're

64
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,560
driving too fast or if the wind rows are

65
00:02:39,800 --> 00:02:45,840
uneven. Another issue is bales that are

66
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:48,239
too loose or too tight. Adjust your bor

67
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:50,560
settings to fix this problem.

68
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,440
Sometimes you might experience twine or

69
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:55,040
net wrap failures. Check your bor's

70
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,440
tying mechanism and make sure you're

71
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,800
using quality

72
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:01,000
materials. Moisture in the hay can lead

73
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:03,440
to mold or even spontaneous

74
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:06,319
combustion. Always ensure your hay is

75
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:08,400
properly dried before bailing. To keep

76
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,599
your bor in top shape, regular

77
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,480
maintenance is key. Clean your bor after

78
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,640
each use to remove hay and debris.

79
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:18,360
Lubricate all moving parts according to

80
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
the manufacturer's

81
00:03:18,360 --> 00:03:22,040
recommendations. Check and tighten all

82
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,720
bolts and chains

83
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,040
regularly. Inspect belts for wear and

84
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,400
replace them when

85
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,239
necessary. Keep an eye on your BOR's

86
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,200
pickup tines and replace any that are

87
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:35,560
bent or broken. Before each bailing

88
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:38,000
season, give your BOR a thorough

89
00:03:35,560 --> 00:03:40,080
inspection. Address any issues before

90
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,040
you start bailing to avoid breakdowns in

91
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,480
the field. Outro. And there you have it,

92
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,920
folks, your complete guide to hay

93
00:03:45,480 --> 00:03:49,840
bailing. We've covered everything from

bailing practices lead to better feed

97
