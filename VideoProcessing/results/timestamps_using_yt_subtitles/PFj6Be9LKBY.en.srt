2
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:11,880
thought we do a little update

3
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,960
today on the chickens and how they're

4
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:16,960
doing and the new winter chicken coop

5
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:36,960
so it does smell a little bit in

6
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:38,800
here kind like a vinegary smell I guess

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
I would

8
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,960
say so what that's telling me is we need

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,440
more carbon I'm just going to take some

10
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:46,640
of this hay I

11
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:51,640
have and spread it out and let the

12
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,640
ladies go ahead and do their thing

16
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:21,360
so now all you got to do is throw the

17
00:01:18,439 --> 00:01:24,960
flakes of hay down and let the girls do

18
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:24,960
the rest of the work

24
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,560
they just go into town scratching

25
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:12,520
through it finding all the good stuff

26
00:02:09,560 --> 00:02:12,520
out of it right now to

27
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,000
eat and they'll spread it around

28
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,280
and you kind of got to remember too that

29
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:32,040
these chickens been out on pasture their

30
00:02:30,280 --> 00:02:34,640
whole life until they come into this

31
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:35,800
Coupe so all this hay and everything

32
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:36,959
they love it they're going to pick

33
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:38,280
through it and they're going to eat it

34
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,879
the best they can they're not just going

35
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,280
to use it for bed and they're going to

36
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:43,480
be eating this stuff they've been out

37
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,280
having fresh grass their whole life so

38
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:47,879
they really look forward to this free

39
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,120
range free choice oyster shells that

40
00:02:47,879 --> 00:02:51,000
they can eat so if they need more

41
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,120
calcium in the diet they can go get it

42
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:58,360
whenever they

43
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,360
want they're making their own dust baths

46
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,640
it's a little noisy in here right now

47
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:25,360
they're really enjoying the fresh hay I

48
00:03:21,640 --> 00:03:25,360
put down for them

49
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,080
so we just got 15 chicken eggs so far

50
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,480
today there a duck egg over there and

51
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,760
another chicken egg over there so we got

52
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:45,439
16 17 eggs plus one duck egg this

53
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:47,720
morning we've gotten 18 eggs so far

54
00:03:45,439 --> 00:03:52,120
today we've been averaging around 20 to

55
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:53,760
22 a day we only have 24 laying hens

56
00:03:52,120 --> 00:03:55,439
been doing pretty darn good I think

57
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:57,519
you'd almost think it's springtime with

58
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,959
the amount of eggs you've been getting

59
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,239
they're really loving the greenhouse

60
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:03,120
they've been laying really good since

61
00:04:01,239 --> 00:04:05,720
they've been in

62
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,959
here they love all the fresh hay they

63
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,240
get as you can see they scratching

64
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,720
through it and going to

65
00:04:09,240 --> 00:04:14,840
[Applause]

66
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,840
town even the Ducks are loving

67
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:21,799
it now even just since I put this hay

68
00:04:18,759 --> 00:04:23,400
down a few minutes ago the smell in here

69
00:04:21,799 --> 00:04:25,199
has changed there is no more smell it's

70
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:26,600
kind of like a when you walked in you

71
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,120
just kind of felt it hit you in the face

72
00:04:26,600 --> 00:04:29,960
it was a little bit of like a vinegary

73
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:31,440
smell you put the hay down down the

74
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:33,199
girls have come in they scratched it all

75
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:37,080
around and moved it and the smell's gone

76
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:39,280
away so the Deep bedding really works if

77
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:41,240
you start smelling a nasty smell or a

78
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,240
strong smell of anything all you need to

79
00:04:41,240 --> 00:04:45,320
do is add some more carbon in this case

80
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:48,320
we're using hay the girls are loving

81
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:50,960
eating it it's a food source for them

82
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:52,880
they get more fresh greens and it's a

83
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:54,600
good carbon I've just been using the

84
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:57,520
lower nest boxes

85
00:04:54,600 --> 00:05:00,080
here upper ones I keep locked up I don't

86
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:02,880
want the girls just hanging out in here

87
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:05,360
during the day and pooping up in here so

88
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,080
during the day I keep the lower nest

89
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:09,440
boxes open when I get home from work

90
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,039
usually around like 5:00 I'll come in

91
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,400
I'll collect my eggs I get my eggs out

92
00:05:12,039 --> 00:05:15,520
and then when I'm all done collecting

93
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:17,160
the eggs I just shut it up and then that

94
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:19,080
way at night the girls can't go in there

95
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,400
and sleep and poop all over the place

96
00:05:19,080 --> 00:05:21,890
that's usually when the nest boxes get

97
00:05:21,400 --> 00:05:23,560
really

98
00:05:21,890 --> 00:05:25,600
[Music]

99
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:28,280
dirty this right here this hay is the

100
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:30,600
same hay I put in the first time we set

101
00:05:28,280 --> 00:05:33,880
up the CPE for

102
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:36,919
it's still clean there's no

103
00:05:33,880 --> 00:05:39,120
poop the eggs we're getting out are nice

104
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:39,120
and

105
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:48,960
clean the Ducks love the water they're

106
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:50,960
just going to town they're the ones

107
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:52,000
making the biggest mess over there and

108
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:56,840
and I'm sure that's why we're going

109
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,840
through about 50 gallons of water a week

00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:24,599
and we're going to be doing like a

119
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,000
breakdown of what we're getting back to

120
00:06:24,599 --> 00:06:30,840

121
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:32,240

122
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,120

123
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,639
