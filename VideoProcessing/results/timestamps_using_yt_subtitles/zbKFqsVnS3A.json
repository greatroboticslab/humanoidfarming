  "text": "hello everyone welcome back to Modern Agri machines today we are going to explore a modern farming model that is becoming increasingly popular and highly effective growing melons and grained H houses not only does this model bring High productivity but it also protects crops from external environmental factors and optimizes growing conditions let's Dive Right In [Music] growing melons in green houses has several major advantages compared to open field cultivation firstly green houses protect plants from extreme weather conditions like heavy rain scorching heat or Frost ensuring consistent quality and yield throughout the year independent of weather conditions furthermore the greenhouse environment is closely controlled temperature humidity and irrigation are optimized for the plant's growth as a result melons grown in green houses are often of higher quality with evenly ripened sweeter fruits this model also minimizes the intrusion of pests in diseases reducing the need for pesticides green houses allow for efficient water use with automatic drip irrigation systems that conserve natural resources [Music] to get started we first need to construct a greenhouse the design and installation must ensure durability and protection for the plants green houses are typically built with sturdy steel frames and covered with UV resistant polyethylene film allowing the plants to absorb sunlight without damage ventilation and temperature control systems are also installed to maintain ideal growing conditions for the melons [Music] once the greenhouse is ready the next step is preparing the soil and planting seeds the soil in the greenhouse must be loosened and enriched with nutrients Farmers plant the melon seeds in rows or pots space 30 50 c apart giving each plant room to thrive irrigation is done through a drip system ensuring each plant receives the right amount of water and nutrients without was additionally LED Lighting systems can be installed to supplement sunlight especially during cloudy [Music] days pollination for cucumber plants is a crucial step in their growth process ensuring fruit formation cucumber plants have both male and female flowers and for fruit to developed pollen from the male flour must be transferred to the female flour typically this process is carried carried out by pollinating insects such as bees as bees fly from flower to flower they carry pollen from male flowers to female flowers in Greenhouse farming Farmers often use manual pollination methods using small brushes to transfer the pollen or they raise honeybees within the greenhouse to ensure efficient pollination this helps the cucumber plants produce even fruits and Achieve high yields [Music] [Applause] [Music] during the growing process Farmers regularly check the plants prune leaves and side branches to focus nutrients on the fruits organic or biofertilizers are applied to provide necessary nutrition ensuring the melons grow evenly and sweetly thanks to the enclosed environment of the greenhouse Pest Control becomes easier if any signs of pest or disease appear farmers can take quick action without needing excessive pesticide use [Music] [Applause] [Music] after about 75 90 days the melons are ready to be harvested Farmers carefully inspect the fruits and choose those that have reached perfect ripeness with bright yellow skin the melons are hand harvested ensuring minimal damage of the plants and fruits [Music] after harvesting cucumbers undergo a sorting process to ensure quality they are care carefully inspected for siis color and shape and any substandard fruits are removed the cucumbers are then carefully packed into boxes or bags to protect them during Transportation these packages usually have ventilation holes to keep the cucumbers fresh for a longer period once packed the cucumbers are transported to markets supermarkets and Distributors for [Music] sale the greenhouse melon growing model has brought significant economic and environmental benefits not only does it increase productivity and product quality but it also protects crops from weather fluctuations and pests in the future with the advancement of Technology growing melons and greenhouses promises to go even further becoming a sustainable and efficient agricultural solution for Farmers thank you for watching today's video don't forget to like share and subscribe to stay updated on exciting content about modern agricultural technology see you in the next video on Modern Agri machines [Music] oh [Music] la [Music]",
