  "text": "foreign it is used in diverse ways in the form of salads juices sauces ingredient for various urinary preparations Etc interestingly China ranks number one and the largest producer of tomatoes and the next point is a tomato plant information botanically called percicum tomato plants are actually wines if we will adequate support they can grow up to six feet to tall in traditional farming in greenhouses they can live up to three years The Vines are covered with short hairs all over and the flowers are yellow in color and the next point is ideal conditions for tomato cultivation it can't tolerate height right intensity as well as as well since it affects the fruit pigmentation our next point is the climate for a tomato farming being one seasoned crop tomato crop requires an ideal temperature of 21 to 30 23 degrees C tomatoes are highly sensitive to climatic changes for ideal growth and yield tomatoes need a diverse effect of climatic conditions at very every stage of growth such as seed germination flowering fruiting Etc tomato farming needs a warm and food climate with medium sunlight both heavy rainfall and a prolonged with a dry spells affect the growth of tomato plants our next wine diesel soil for tomato cultivation tomato needs a virus set of climate for its growth diverse effect of climate for its growth it can grow on all types of soils from light sandy soil to heavy creamy soil a well-drained soil with a depth of 15 to 20 cm is ideal for yielding a healthy crop pH for tomato farming soil PH falling in the range of food 6.2 6.0 to 0.0 is preferred along with adequate nutrient Supply can help to Tomato crops grow better in acidic soil and the next point is water requirement in tomato Plantation converters are sensitive to both excess water as well as very little water image is challenging tomato cultivation is maintained and even moisture Supply during summer it is necessary to irrigate the crop once a week while irrigating it once in every two weeks is the sufficient care should be taken to prevent any drought period after a heavy watering goes drought followed by an abruptive watering during the fruiting phase would cause cracking in tomatoes our next point is a crop rotation with the Tomato crop tomato belongs to solanasia family it can't be rotated with other crops belonging to the same family like potato tobacco bell pepper Etc it must be rotated with crops that fulfill the nitrogen content of the soil leguminous crops are the most recommended for this purpose tomato crops are hence rotated with a leguminous crops like beans pulses Etc next point is the land preparation for tomato cultivation the field for growing tomatoes must be thoroughly indicated and decimated and fragmented thorough repeated flowing it means about five programs five plugins before cultivation the step after plowing is leaving leveling the land is level in the evenings and beds are prepared for planting the tomato seeds the land must be sterilized after plowing so as to destroy the disease causing fascism on the microbes they are commonly sterilized by solarizations [Music] and next point is the season for tomato Plantation since the tomatoes are dead neutral they can be grown during any season in the southern part Circle in southern past tomatoes are transplanted in three Cycles December to January the transplantation schedule is below the crop next point is Krampus February months Jade season it transplanted during September and October months in the Southern Plains only if adequate irrigation facilities are available similarly in the northern plants in the Northern Plains a Ravi crop may not be taken since they may get affected during winter seeds these seeds the seeds are first raised in the nurseries and then transplanted after a period of 30 to 40 days 45 days hybrid and exodico varieties are sown in small plastic cups while other varieties that are not too closely to produce are soon in a nursery beds especially for the purpose next point is transplantation transplantation is done in Shallow furrows or flat beds as per the irrigation availability during the monsoon and in case of heavy soils seedlings are planted in brine in dry it in bridges so that the water doesn't get robbed in case of hybrids and in the determinative varieties seedlings must be stacked using bamboo sticks if planted in furrows then they are planted at a spacing of a 30 cm from each other for spring summer crop the spacing maintained is 75 to 45 cm and 75 to 60 cm for ottoman winter crop and the next point is harvesting from tomato Plantation Tomatoes can be harvested within two to three months of Plantation depending on the market you demand harvesting of tomato is done on a yearly basis the average tomato crop yield for actually India is about 10 tons although the yield varies from 15 to 20 tons per acre in case of irrigated crops this is the information regarding the Tomato Farm which is having very good demand in the world for commercial choices and vegetable work in the vegetable market also this is the main source of cooking pot tomato he is having very much so it is also a profitable problem but only one thing is marketing areas also Farmers you should find out according to the marketing areas they should Supply in time frequently then only it will be successful only lots of tomatoes are coming unders there's no Market means they will lost so much so periodical supply has to be there to the market units so marketing strategies are most important and where to supply when to supply and how we can collect their money all these things also we should think common then only it will be a successful successful business because production will be there we should catch the demand also in the same way that is also most important so Communications are most important in this manner to Farmer to Farmer and farmer to dealer and supplier and distributor and all these so if you maintain all these things you will be successful in this awareness wishing you all the way all the rest",
