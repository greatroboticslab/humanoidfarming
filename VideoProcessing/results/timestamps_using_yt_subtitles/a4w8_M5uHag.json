  "text": "hi it's john um i'm just planting some sweet corn uh i bought several packets and this is the one i gonna plant today there we go it's uh unwinds sweetcorn super sweet f1 hybrid on the pack here it says pack to your ending 12 14 12 so it's all right it's in date best before 2016. approximate seeds 35 well there was only 28. i mean that is bad if i was selling stuff i would always make sure there was more than what was said i think i i'm not sure i might contact them to tell them there was only 28 seats but one of the things i forgot to do when you're in the shop and you're buying a pack of seeds and it says it's so just check you can just check you can feel how many there are and if it doesn't feel like there's 28 in there or if have 35 in there don't buy it but i forgot to do that on this one um whether they would send me another pack i don't know anyway got 28 i've got these containers all fitted up with soil it's just uh i'm not quite sure what soil it is i just found it outside um i don't think you need very special soil for sweet corn um just the warmth really uh i've got a pop pot here to put any objects of stones and things i find so i've put one in each pot um uh and it says half an inch deep um so this has got twelve sets uh just pop them in and what they need they need warmth so they need to be over 60 degrees to be um to germinate that's the main thing they need and then of course they need to be out in the best of the summer weather they need the sunshine as the kellogg's corn flakes advert says they need 100 days of sunshine well sometimes we get a nice lot of sunshine and sometimes we don't if you get a good year you can get lots of sweetcorn and any surplus will be very useful for feeding the chickens so that's my thinking last year i grew some sweet corn and just some odd bits of maize that i had about but uh i bought quite a lot of seeds this time so it all should all be sweet cornable you know edible because the maze can be a bit bitter or not sweet it's with sweet corn it says you've got to plant plants about 15 inches apart that's quite loud and uh and plant them in a block so they're fertilize one another and it also says that you shouldn't plant other sweet corn by it because you get cross pollination i don't did that matter i don't know anyway i'd love to see i'm not quite sure where about someone planted yet but it is a lovely thing to have in the garden because well if you just eat and eat it can't you and children like it as well so on these will like it she stays with us and um yeah if i do write to one wins about the one being 28 seeds i can put a link in to this video um i don't know whether that would prove that there were only 28. i'm not gonna just poke this one in somewhere but that would prove something do you think i mean am i mean i think it's a matter of principle i mean last year i bought some other animal seeds and there was supposed to be about six small net gourds in the packet and seeds and there was only two and uh i didn't send two of them then i said to then i bought another packet and there was about 12 in there i mean what it suggests to me is that their workers just aren't interested in getting the right amount of seeds in the packet which doesn't sound very good to me anyway that's got them in there i've got them in uh they're 12 minutes i've got them in 24 so i may have doubled up to see two couple there we go just hope that they grow i think i think within about 10 days they should be showing some signs i think 10 days it definitely will be and i'll do an update then unwinds sweetcorn and if i do send to them i'll be able to tell you what their response was okay bye for now you",
