  "text": "this sample query shows how to select different time windows for different layers okay so in this specific example we're going to look at agricultural data for the Midwestern u.s. specifically we're going to compare the crop planting information together with some weather information okay so let's get started initially we create a new query we select from survey right here the 250 meter resolution crop planting map so this from the US Department of Agriculture and from the weather category we select prison historical data and let's pick the daily maximum temperature for example okay so now when it comes to where the prison data is only available for the continental US therefore you see here the contiguous US has been highlighted already for us now we can zoom in maybe a bit and select a rectangle somewhere here in the Midwest like this to the where we take this option off we can see now we can allow to choose different time windows for these layers okay so for the crop type that simply pick January 1st 2017 and for the maximum temperature let's pick something like June 2017 okay so the idea would be roughly speaking that from the crop type one knows what has been planted there and then one might won't be interested in the temperature to see you know all these crops could possibly elope so let's pick next we don't do any aggregation for this give this name and submit it so this is very straightforward to give an idea what the result looks like we ran this query previously so let's click on this here see indeed we have the crop layer note that the crop type is categorically encoded the codes pretty much correspond to these numbers you see with this color scheme they're gonna say no point you can basically see the value here and these numerical codes are consistent with USDA codes okay so similarly we could of course select our temperature which we have you know picked here and again is like now click on a single point we also get the complete time series at this point at the same time you can launch an animation for this and see how the temperature devolve de-evolve during the month of June",
