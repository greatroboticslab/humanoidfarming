  "text": "good morning modern standards we've been getting a lot of questions lately about our winter piglets I guess they're really not winter piglets but about our winter pink so we got to give them some water we've got some food scraps for him let's go have a chat with him like a fireside chat with piglets they're waiting for us hello prosciutto and Coppa I'll get some left over they smell the leftover food I have some of the first questions have been your piglets a huge are there really piglets well that's the debatable I guess we wanted to get piglets that were at least 60 pounds so that way we knew they had enough fat on them to make it through the winter here being in northern New Hampshire for just the two of them being outside once the piglets get bigger you don't have to worry about them being outside and if you got like a thirty pound cake lit and you live in a northern climate like we do and you only had two of them they're gonna they're gonna have trouble staying warm for a little while so we went to the farm we picked out our pigs I'll put a video right here the farm at raised the piglets out on pasture their whole life he had six of them in a pen when we got there there are around sixty pounds or so when we picked them out these are the two we wanted so he kept him in the barn for a week and he fed him grain and they packed on the pounds if they weren't a hundred pounds when we got him last week there are a hundred pounds now they're huge so we're not gonna have any issues with these two pigs going through the winter time which is perfect that's what we wanted winter pigs are gonna go through more food because they burn a lot more calories just to keep warm their feed to weight conversion isn't going to be as good as it is during the spring and summer months now for us in our area winter piglets are cheaper we paid one hundred and twenty five dollars per piglet in the springtime and those piglets were around 30 to 40 pounds our winter piglets we paid $75 a piglet form and they were between 80 and a hundred pounds there's a huge difference right there the biggest reason for that is supply and demand most people want to raise their pigs in the springtime and in the wintertime the average person doesn't want to be bothered with it the nice part about that is that's going to offset the cost we're going to have invested in the feed and the bedding only raising them outside hair on pasture I'll bring you up close to them the Heritage raised pigs they're not pink pigs their heritage breeds and look how hairy they are these pigs are gonna do amazingly well in the colder weather we're using hay for bedding they have an area where they can get in out of the wind and they can bury themselves and hay the reason why we're using hay versus straw straw is like double the price of hay there's not a lot of farmers up here who grow wheat so I think that's the biggest reason they got a chuck in all the straw pigs do really well outside of the elements they just need a place to be in and out of from the rain and the wind so it doesn't need to be a fancy barn or heated barn they just need a place to get in out of the elements think of wild pigs they do really well outside constantly when I'm raising animals I like to think about that like oh the animals thrive or do in nature normally how do they do it so I kind of try to implement those plans in action when we're raising up here we're going to be doing the deep bedding system not just in where they can get in and out of the weather but the whole head we're just gonna be layering it more and more with hay whatever we can get our hands on throughout the winter we are gonna be spending money on the hay and whatever else we can get for our deep bedding but we need to think about that as an investment into our food freedom this right here the deep bedding system is a big part of our food freedom we're gonna compost this and this is gonna grow our beautiful food next year and then we'll have a huge abundance for us to give away to friends and family and feed our animals in return to make us some peanut better bake it you can't get any better than that we install the hot and cold water spigot on our house okay so we have access to hot water during our three-day hog harvesting classes I'll put a link to those videos right here it's been working on amazing I even have an access to warm water to give to the animals the chickens love it the pigs love it right for shoot oh you'll love in the warm water the way I look at that is but no one give them two Hut cuz we can burn them but on a cold day like right now it's cold outside I'm looking forward to going into havin a hot cup of coffee so I think about I bet my pigs would like a hot cup of coffee and I bring out their warm water that's what I'm thinking I'm bringing them out their hot cup of coffee for the morning the afternoon for the night just to finish the day off not their day off strong form on the really cold days we can make a mash out of their food with warm water thanks I'm glad you like the sweatshirt we just got our new sweatshirts and t-shirts in they're gonna be up on our website at Lemna a curse.com we got two different color sweatshirts two different color men's two t-shirts two different color fitted women shirts that Gina picked out in two different color kids shirts that Olivia picked up I'll put a link in the description down below we just hit 14 thousand subscribers I wanted to thank all the modern stutters who's helped us with that when we had twenty thousand subscribers we're going to be giving away an automatic chicken plucker I'm going to put a link to that video right here and to our blog post in the description down below you can go check out either one of those if I know how you can enter in for your chance to win one of the other reasons I love having animals around on the homestead is when it's cold out and when do you don't always feel like getting outside and enjoying it and sometimes you're not going to enjoy going out and how to take care of the animals and that's fine there's nothing wrong with it but I really enjoy having the winter animals as it forces me to get out every day at least twice a day and go feed them in water and it makes me go outside and enjoy the beauty yes it might be called but it's beautiful right now it's snowing up I wasn't already taking care of my pigs I'd be inside so I just love that it it forces me to get out and it makes me look at the elements in a different way it makes me see the beauty around the farm one thing I love and enjoy doing is taking photos for Instagram I don't do it all the time but I do enjoy taking a nice snapshot of an area and then I can appreciate it more when I upload to Instagram like I wasn't looking at just that one area I was looking at the bigger picture sometimes it's just nice to focus in on a small thing and see what you've done and what you've accomplished and it makes you feel a lot better but what's going on sometimes it's just so much chaotic stuff going around in our life in the world on the homestead to just narrow it on one thing that you've done or that you're doing that you really enjoy just makes you feel that much better and having animals on the homestead and forcing you to go out every day to me that helps me do it and I really enjoy that I hope I answered everybody's questions if I did it then even in the comments down below and I'll either reply to them there or I'll make another video and answer them we hope you enjoyed today's video if you did give it a thumbs up share it it really helps our channel grow and it helps just we treat people and we wanted to thank you all for that and we'll see you right back here tomorrow at love the acres guide modern homesteading self-sufficiency and freedom I",
