1
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,400
with your agricultural knowledge did you

2
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:12,799
decide to pursue a niche in poultry

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,880
production so you've got 30 000 there's

4
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:17,840
a 20

5
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:21,680
room of era or margin what else should

6
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:24,160
we know about egg laying um for example

7
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:25,680
when a person wants to pursue uh poultry

8
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,400
production and specifically an egg

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,880
laying does one need to find clients

10
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,559
first before the chickens start to lay

11
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:36,160
the eggs which one comes first

12
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:37,920
it's it's

13
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,360
making sure that the chickens start

14
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,960
laying eggs

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:42,719
and then you can find the clients

16
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,239
because when you start right you don't

17
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:47,239
have to have the market when you start

18
00:00:51,010 --> 00:00:59,990

have you on we've had many poultry

65
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,840
farmers on the podcast

66
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,440
very few females so maybe if you could

67
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,720
tell us about your farming business

68
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,200
what's the name

69
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,080
why did you decide to farm poultry and

70
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,319
not any other commodity

71
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,560
okay um the name of our business is

72
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,100
mazapa trading

73
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,640
um and we are doing poultry

74
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:24,000
[Music]

75
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,879
uh

76
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,200
crops and

77
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,519
piggery right but we

78
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,480
we mainly focus on

79
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:34,799
poultry

80
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,599
because when we got into poultry we

81
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:38,480
realized that almost every house has

82
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:40,319
eggs

83
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,959
could be for breakfast could be for

84
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:45,120
lunch could be for dinner but almost

85
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,360
every house has eggs

86
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
so that is why we decided to get into

87
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:52,319
poultry and everything else just

88
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:55,360
balances it out

89
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,000
yeah so you keep saying we

90
00:03:55,360 --> 00:03:59,360
uh uh are you are you uh running a

91
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,840
family farm

92
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,680
do you have business partners um or are

93
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:06,560
you saying we thinking of yourself and

94
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:08,879
the team that you employ

95
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,000
it's okay it's a family business it's me

96
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:12,959
and my mom

97
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:14,720
but we also have a team that helps us so

98
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:17,440
at the end of the day it's not just the

99
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:19,759
two of us that these this business

100
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,240
supports it's us and a whole lot of

101
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:25,680
other families that are involved

102
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,520
yeah so you know we do get a lot of uh

103
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:29,840
farmers who have

104
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:31,840
joined generational family farms or

105
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,400
joined in the family business what made

106
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,320
you to decide to pursue farming with

107
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:38,160
your mother and

108
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,840
just also expanding a little bit on

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,560
poultry are you farming broilers or

110
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,080
layers

111
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,560
okay oh

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,960
i came with the idea right but i did not

113
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,080
have money so i was like okay you can

114
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:54,160
bring in the money and i will bring in

115
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,479
the skills because at first i was even

116
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:58,960
studying psychology and then i dropped

117
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:01,199
out of psychology to go to go pursue

118
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:03,520
agriculture with unisa

119
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:06,080
and then she brought in the funds i

120
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,560
brought in this skills and we just ran

121
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,800
with it and yeah

122
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:13,840
and oh yeah they they farm

123
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,919
um we're focusing mainly on the eggs

124
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:18,400
right but

125
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:20,320
on the side we have brightness

126
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:22,720
we also have

127
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:24,720
the old cheeks

128
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:27,919
right so maybe tell us a little bit

129
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:30,160
zondi in terms of um the layers you know

130
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:32,960
how many layers should one start with

131
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:35,600
just to you know break even and what are

132
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:37,840
the type of conditions that the the

133
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:39,759
chickens need to successfully lay eggs

134
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,759
in if you could maybe just share share

135
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:44,479
that with us

136
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:47,039
okay um first of all with the layers

137
00:05:44,479 --> 00:05:48,400
it's it's a go big or go home kind of a

138
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,080
game

139
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:54,800
you can't start with 100 um chickens and

140
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,440
because you get roughly 80

141
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,680
of the eggs of your total number if you

142
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:02,800
have 100 eggs then per day you should

143
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:05,120
look at 88 right which is not enough

144
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,120
because that's roughly 2

145
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,280
not even three trays

146
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,280
so you just have to go big and currently

147
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,400
we farming with about three thousand

148
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,759
chickens

149
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,440
from two different chicken houses right

150
00:06:15,759 --> 00:06:19,600
and then from that three thousand at

151
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:22,000
least we know that we have eighty

152
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:23,120
which is enough

153
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:24,000
yes

154
00:06:23,120 --> 00:06:25,520
yeah

155
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,759
and so

156
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,720
with your agricultural knowledge did you

157
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:33,039
decide to pursue a niche in poultry

158
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
production so you've got 30 000 there's

159
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,240
a twenty percent uh

160
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:42,080
room of error or margin what else should

161
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,560
we know about egg laying um for example

162
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:46,080
when a person wants to pursue uh poultry

163
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,720
production and specifically an egg

164
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,199
laying does one need to find clients

165
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,960
first before the chickens start to lay

166
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:56,560
the eggs which one comes first

167
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:58,319
it's it's

168
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,759
making sure that the chickens start

169
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,360
laying eggs

170
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:03,120
and then you can find the clients

171
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,280
because when you start right you don't

172
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:08,000
have to have the market when you start

173
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,080
because you can just start for household

174
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:10,960
consumption before you even go big you

175
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,919
know

176
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:15,120
the neighborhoods around the farm are

177
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:17,280
you

178
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,599
start off consumers if i should put it

179
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:23,360
like that because before you get to

180
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:25,280
produce for shop ride and spa and and

181
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,360
um you start off with the people around

182
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:30,319
you you know the household consumptions

183
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:31,840
are the first people that we started at

184
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
because

185
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:36,160
you can just stand anyway and sell eggs

186
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:36,960
and they will fly off

187
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:38,800
yeah

188
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,120
yeah so what would you say to someone

189
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:43,360
who says uh for example you said you

190
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,440
know firstly they need to go big or go

191
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:47,199
home because starting with 80 chickens

192
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:50,720
is not it's not sufficient that's about

193
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:54,400
two trays and if you started selling to

194
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:56,080
um your nearby community

195
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:58,000
why would there be a need for them for

196
00:07:56,080 --> 00:07:59,919
someone to go supply to establish

197
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
retailers because at the end of the day

198
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:05,280
those same people buy from the retailers

199
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:08,400
so doesn't it make logical sense to just

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,400
expand to your immediate community and

201
00:08:08,400 --> 00:08:11,919
then broaden it outside your immediate

202
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:13,759
community and start supplying other

203
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:16,160
communities

204
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
yeah it definitely does because

205
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,840
at some point

206
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,199
people people work with

207
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:23,199
um

208
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,560
i wouldn't say you channel people but i

209
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:26,560
would say it's easier to build

210
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:29,199
relationships with people around you

211
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:31,520
right and people work with referrals so

212
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,839
if one person can tell the next person

213
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,919
that i found fresh eggs at so and so

214
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,000
store then

215
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:39,350
chances of the business growing are very

216
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:40,640
high

217
00:08:39,350 --> 00:08:43,039
[Music]

218
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:44,480
zone if you can share with us uh uh you

219
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,160
know without

220
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:47,360
revealing too many business trade

221
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:50,399
secrets

222
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:52,480
who is your market um you know

223
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,279
how are you selling to them is it weekly

224
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,120
daily and how are you managing cash flow

225
00:08:55,279 --> 00:09:00,320
within your business do you have certain

226
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,240
payment terms um or do you do that or do

227
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:05,120
your customers have to pay cash because

228
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,680
we all know that in the broiler

229
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,160
poultry industry you know chickens need

230
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:13,040
to be fed every single day almost every

231
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:15,120
hour so how does one manage their cash

232
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:17,920
flow especially if they want to go into

233
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,399
poultry production

234
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,720
okay we work with cash on delivery we

235
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,240
are very strict on catch on delivery

236
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:28,959
right because chickens need eggs and

237
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,600
feed is expensive with petrols going up

238
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:35,120
everything going up feed is also going

239
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:37,839
up right so we cannot afford to have

240
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:40,000
people maybe taking stock on account and

241
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,360
the payment and because the business is

242
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,680
still growing

243
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:45,600
um there's always room for improvement

244
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,040
it's our fourth year in the

245
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,399
game and

246
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,640
there's still room for improvement so

247
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,480
cash on delivery makes things easier

248
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,040
right and

249
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:57,920
we sell on a daily basis because

250
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,880
just

251
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,440
not far from the farm we have a store

252
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,720
where people come in at first we were

253
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,320
selling for the around neighborhood

254
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:11,279
and before we knew it we had people

255
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,600
coming in to stroke

256
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,079
right so that is what has been helping

257
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,959
us keep the cash flow and another thing

258
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:20,880
is the crops see the crops also help us

259
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,360
with the cash flow of the business

260
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,160
because crops are growing at three

261
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:28,399
months three months rotation and that

262
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
it makes it easier to have a constant

263
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:33,279
cash flow for the chickens the feed and

264
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,680
everything else yeah i like the fact

265
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,480
that you are diversifying so that you

266
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,880
can maintain both enterprises because my

267
00:10:38,480 --> 00:10:43,839
follow-up question there was

268
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:46,560
why did you decide to also diversify

269
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,959
into piggery and crops you know that

270
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:52,079
also seems like very very intensive

271
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:54,399
farming uh in their own right but at

272
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,640
what stage having been in the business

273
00:10:54,399 --> 00:10:58,399
for about four years did you guys decide

274
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:00,480
let's venture into crops and if you are

275
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:03,440
venturing into crops what crops are you

276
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,760
farming and also why piggery at the same

277
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,760
time

278
00:11:05,920 --> 00:11:12,000
okay piggery was a hobby right because

279
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,640
my mom just left figuring

280
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:16,399
and she started off with just four pigs

281
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,360
and

282
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:21,200
now he's sitting at about 80 200 but

283
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,839
it's it's a hobby i wouldn't say it's

284
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:27,200
something that we focus on too much but

285
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:28,399
it's they and it it also generates cash

286
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,640
flow right

287
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:33,600
and then the the

288
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:36,240
crops the crops we we currently

289
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,480
plant okay we just

290
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:41,120
sold

291
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,720
sweet potatoes and mealy meal right and

292
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:45,120
then we're currently in the process of

293
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,320
planting cabbage so now with crops it's

294
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:48,000
three months three months till the

295
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:50,399
months so

296
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:53,920
those three months is we just

297
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:56,880
see we just we just grow we sell and it

298
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,040
generates cash flow

299
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,800
fantastic and tell me are you guys

300
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:04,240
farming in your own private land or is

301
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,120
it state-owned or are you leasing

302
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:07,440
it's

303
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,800
privately owned because we have two

304
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,720
farms

305
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:13,120
one farmer is my mom's and the other

306
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:15,120
farm is my dad

307
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,720
all right and so what advice could you

308
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,880
give to young farmers especially

309
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,760
managing their cash flow you know a lot

310
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:23,839
of young children unfortunate enough to

311
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,920
have parents who are really in business

312
00:12:23,839 --> 00:12:27,920
maybe to assist them on cash flow a lot

313
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,200
of other children um are not also

314
00:12:27,920 --> 00:12:33,040
fortunate enough to go into the farming

315
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:35,839
industry with their parents having

316
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,200
farmed i know you said to your mother

317
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,399
she needs to bring in the cashew

318
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,040
bringing the knowledge

319
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:43,360
but having fun for four years managing

320
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,680
all these various commodities poultry

321
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:48,160
piggery as well as crop production what

322
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,000
are some of the the the learnings that

323
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:51,440
you have

324
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:54,160
acquired throughout your farming

325
00:12:51,440 --> 00:12:56,959
experience around managing cash flow and

326
00:12:54,160 --> 00:12:59,200
the importance thereof and what advice

327
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,240
could you give to other young farmers

328
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,480
maybe we just studied agriculture but in

329
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:06,800
theory you know and don't have actual

330
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:08,720
practice in managing cash flow because i

331
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:11,360
heard you say you you take cash on

332
00:13:08,720 --> 00:13:13,200
demand now for a person who's not used

333
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:14,079
to getting cash

334
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:15,760
um

335
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:16,880
you know on hand

336
00:13:15,760 --> 00:13:18,560
and and

337
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,120
thinking that i have to reinvest this in

338
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:23,360
the business they might use that

339
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:24,560
you know to spend other things so what

340
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:27,040
are some of the things that you've

341
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:29,519
learned around handling cash cash flow

342
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:31,440
management managing finances in your

343
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:33,360
business that you could share to other

344
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:37,279
young farmers maybe who are less

345
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:40,000
inexperienced in financial management

346
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:42,560
you know i would first say that the

347
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:44,639
business does not find the lifestyle

348
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:47,120
because

349
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:50,800
it's a completely different world

350
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:53,120
because as much as cash flow cash flows

351
00:13:50,800 --> 00:13:55,440
every single day there's something to be

352
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:57,680
bought every single day for the farm

353
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,839
whether it's feed

354
00:13:57,680 --> 00:14:03,360
electricity water to be paid

355
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,279
medication there's just

356
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,560
something that needs to be bought every

357
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:11,360
day right and

358
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:13,279
it's very tricky because the first

359
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,600
the first three years

360
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:18,000
there is no profit you just farming

361
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:20,480
farming farming producing meeting

362
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,959
deadlines but there is no profit you

363
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,959
start to break even maybe at the end of

364
00:14:22,959 --> 00:14:26,800
the third year

365
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,279
then that's when you start to break even

366
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:31,120
then that's when you start to see where

367
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:34,720
you're working where what are you

368
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,040
working for and where you're going

369
00:14:34,720 --> 00:14:38,480
what's the vision for your farm business

370
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,160
i mean where do you see yourself in the

371
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:42,160
next three to five years

372
00:14:42,639 --> 00:14:45,920
i would like to see our eggs in

373
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:48,399
woodworks i'm sorry but i would like to

374
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:49,920
see our eggs and regrets because that's

375
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,560
where the niche

376
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:56,480
that is like the top bar

377
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:58,240
of every farmer or producer or

378
00:14:56,480 --> 00:14:59,760
anyone who's into product food

379
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:01,279
production

380
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:02,880
yeah and how do you think you're going

381
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,279
to get there because you know dealing

382
00:15:02,880 --> 00:15:07,519
with the big guys comes with a lot of

383
00:15:05,279 --> 00:15:10,079
red tape so how you think you're going

384
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,079
to get there

385
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,320
i would say quality speaks for itself

386
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,800
because

387
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:18,560
when you're producing quality

388
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,720
everybody around you will see it and

389
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:24,480
everybody will talk about it you can

390
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:27,839
start at like the close supermarkets

391
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:31,360
eventually quality will speak for itself

392
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:33,120
yeah yeah zondi uh before i let you go i

393
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:34,959
would just like to know maybe for

394
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:37,360
someone who's inspired by a story and

395
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:38,959
wants to start uh egg laying what are

396
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:40,880
some of the infrastructural development

397
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:42,720
that one needs to start off with how

398
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,800
much maybe cash do they need to start

399
00:15:42,720 --> 00:15:47,440
off with as well because you said start

400
00:15:44,800 --> 00:15:49,600
by going big or go home what does that

401
00:15:47,440 --> 00:15:52,399
going big look like is it 30 000

402
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:54,399
chickens is it 10 000 is it 5 000

403
00:15:52,399 --> 00:15:56,560
roughly how much can one

404
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,560
look at as an investment to start off

405
00:15:56,560 --> 00:16:01,040
with and what type of infrastructure

406
00:15:58,560 --> 00:16:03,279
must i have to just get my operation

407
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:05,600
going

408
00:16:03,279 --> 00:16:08,959
okay the first of all the infrastructure

409
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,480
should be very warm right because

410
00:16:08,959 --> 00:16:12,160
these chickens are going to be in there

411
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:14,639
for roughly a year

412
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:17,440
so they need a very warm

413
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:20,079
atmosphere because if they get too cold

414
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,240
then the production drops and if the

415
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:24,720
production drops then it's bad for the

416
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:27,360
business and

417
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,600
price wise i would say

418
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,320
it depends on on your structure right

419
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:35,199
but i would say minimum 2 000 chickens

420
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:37,920
minimum as i start off i mean you will

421
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:41,040
grow as it you will grow

422
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:43,920
as it goes right so

423
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:46,240
i would say 2000 as a minimum as a start

424
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:48,560
off maybe in the first year and then

425
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:51,199
from then on there should be growth

426
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,040
right and for for someone who's

427
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,519
interested in

428
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:59,279
farming or poultry i would say do your

429
00:16:55,519 --> 00:16:59,279
research do your research because

430
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:04,240
what works for me might not work for you

431
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:07,360
or there's different kinds of breeds

432
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:10,079
that you can start with you know

433
00:17:07,360 --> 00:17:12,959
so just do your intensive research and

434
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,959
figure out what you want to do

435
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,959
and yeah it will grow

436
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,679
yeah thank you so much for your time

437
00:17:16,959 --> 00:17:21,760
zondi uh maybe the last last question

438
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:22,959
this is quite interesting it is youth

439
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,360
month and

440
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,439
what message can you impart to other

441
00:17:25,360 --> 00:17:29,439
young people within the agri sector

442
00:17:30,480 --> 00:17:35,200
i would say invest in your craft because

443
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:38,559
the best thing you can do is to know

444
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:41,120
your craft master it so that nobody can

445
00:17:38,559 --> 00:17:43,600
tell you anything about it just invest

446
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:46,400
in your craft you know if it takes you

447
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:48,480
okay for from my side there was a yeah

448
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:50,640
where i had to leave the city leave

449
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:54,080
everything and go live at the farm for a

450
00:17:50,640 --> 00:17:55,120
year a full year i was just a farm girl

451
00:17:54,080 --> 00:17:57,679
you know

452
00:17:55,120 --> 00:18:00,080
and that has paid off because now the

453
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,160
the business is at a stage way i would

454
00:18:00,080 --> 00:18:04,400

455
00:18:02,160 --> 00:18:06,640

it's a pleasure if you just missed it we

465
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:32,000
are joined by zombie tajio she's a

466
00:18:29,120 --> 00:18:35,280
poultry farmer and she told us you know

467
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,919
the journey into agriculture um and how

468
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,960
she got to pursue her mother to to be

469
00:18:37,919 --> 00:18:42,640
the financier in her farming enterprise

470
00:18:40,960 --> 00:18:44,880
while she came with the agricultural

471
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:46,799
knowledge and i guess that should give

472
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:49,280
you an answer to say this is how you

473
00:18:46,799 --> 00:18:51,600
could raise your own capital to start

474
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,000
your own farming enterprise seek and

475
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:56,799
look advice and financial assistance to

476
00:18:54,000 --> 00:18:59,120
those close and immediate to you instead

477
00:18:56,799 --> 00:19:01,120
of running off to investors financial

478
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,559
institutions who will obviously lend and

479
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,880
borrow you money with high interest

480
00:19:02,559 --> 00:19:06,880
rates so if you're fortunate enough to

481
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,160
have maybe friends or family that can

482
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:12,400
believe in your idea your business idea

483
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:14,000
or your farming operation maybe give

484
00:19:12,400 --> 00:19:15,840
them some equity let them become

485
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:18,480
involved and you could follow the

486
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:20,559
footsteps like zondi now she's managing

487
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:22,320
an operation four years down the line of

488
00:19:20,559 --> 00:19:23,520
about 30 000

489
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,760
chickens

490
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:27,919
layers to be exact and she's also

491
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:30,240
diversified into piggery as well as

492
00:19:27,919 --> 00:19:32,240
crops to manage the cash flow that she

493
00:19:30,240 --> 00:19:34,160
has within a business she obviously has

494
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:36,160
big hopes as well she would like to see

495
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:38,640
an enterprise growing and i think what i

496
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:40,320
took lastly out of her is that you need

497
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:42,400
to manage your craft and i think this is

498
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,919
something that we need to do year in

499
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,919
year out no matter how much you

500
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,840
experienced how many years you've been

501
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:50,160
farming you still need to keep on

502
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:51,840
upskilling yourself as a farmer as an

503
00:19:50,160 --> 00:19:54,720
entrepreneur as a business person

504
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:57,039
because you know decades change seasons

505
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:59,679
change operations change and they come

506
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:01,840
with various different demands that need

507
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:04,960
your attention so definitely own your

508
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:06,799
craft um you know sharpen your expertise

509
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:08,960
so that you could be a successful farmer

510
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,280
at the end of the day that's it from me

511
00:20:08,960 --> 00:20:14,760
