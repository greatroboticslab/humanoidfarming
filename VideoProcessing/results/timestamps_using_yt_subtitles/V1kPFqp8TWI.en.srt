00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
hey guys little project today is uh i

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,720
gotta get this uh plow set up because i

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:09,360
gotta go plow the barbecue parking lot

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,440
out anyway i bought one of those weld on

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:14,080
plates for a quick hitch

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,759
and i welded it onto a plow blade i had

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,600
bought at an auction

8
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,600
and this is it right here there's the

9
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,520
work master and here's the plow i set up

10
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:23,600
it's welded there welded down there i

11
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:25,519
use a piece of box steel so i got to put

12
00:00:23,600 --> 00:00:26,720
the angle cylinders on that's my next

13
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:28,720
thing

14
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:30,640
all right we're getting parts

15
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:32,880
all right i got pins i hope these pins

16
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,840
work all right so i got the thing hooked

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:35,040
up

18
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:36,399
now i'm going to try to do a little

19
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,079
plowing

20
00:00:36,399 --> 00:00:39,840
i finally got it pinned in i had to go

21
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,840
bang into that snow bank over there to

22
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,239
get it so the pins would work

23
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,640
so let's go do a little plowing i think

24
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:49,280
i got angle now

25
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,280
look at that

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,879
oh

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:54,640
it went all the way that way now it's

28
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,800
not going back

29
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,640
oh i gotta switch to the other handle in

30
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,559
case i want to put like a rotary mower

31
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,280
on

32
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,720
it has to dump all the way back to the

33
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
sump on the tractor

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,159
know why that thing won't go in there

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,840
all right guys i got pressure on it

36
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,240
well best way to do that is to turn the

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,880
tractor off

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,040
turn the tractor off

39
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,840
cycle this

40
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,040
hopefully i'll drop the pressure

41
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:31,280
down and i can get this to plug in

42
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,960
yep there we go that works every time

43
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,400
boy i got my hands oiled up that new

44
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:36,320
holland hydraulic oil is good for my

45
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:39,119
complexion

46
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,400
okay back out see what happens

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,560
i went one way and it didn't go to the

48
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,560
other

49
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,870
well that don't make any sense

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:58,019
maybe it's not what i thought it was

51
00:01:54,870 --> 00:01:58,019
[Music]

52
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:03,920
because it's stuck

53
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:08,040
always some

54
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:08,040
go bang into a snow pile

55
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:25,720
now let's see what it does

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:43,800
seems like out of work

57
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:43,800
well let's go plowing

58
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,560
so

59
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:19,840
oh that works

60
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,799
wow

61
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,840
i wonder why it doesn't float more

62
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:01,840
wow

63
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:01,840
actually works pretty good

64
00:04:27,440 --> 00:04:33,000
all right i'm gonna go over plow the

65
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:33,000
parking lot see how that works

66
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:58,320
oh know i gotta get used to this thing

67
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,560
i don't know why float doesn't work so

68
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:04,560
well

69
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:11,680
i'm gonna keep dumping i gotta keep

70
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:14,000
picking the bucket up

71
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,000
wow

72
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:19,759
that was the best push so far

73
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,080
this stuff's gonna freeze up sell as a

74
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:22,080
rock

75
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:25,840
oh the winds are blowing

76
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,240
i might want to put gloves on ah

77
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:41,240
yeah the wind though it's gotta be 30

78
00:05:35,919 --> 00:05:41,240
mile an hour winds that's awesome

79
00:05:43,880 --> 00:06:10,749

[Music]

85
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:12,800
well let's get back on the tractor and

86
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,800
see what's going on

87
00:07:14,560 --> 00:07:19,840
i hope this mic's working

88
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
i don't know if it is or not

89
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,639
i think i kind of like this thing it

90
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,639
seems to be working okay

91
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:46,800
once i get the angle i got to set the

92
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:48,400
angle of the uh

93
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,479
the bucket tilt

94
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,599
the tilt's got to be right or it doesn't

95
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:55,120
doesn't seem to want to work good

96
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:58,000
also it works better with the blade

97
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:01,039
straighter it doesn't dig in as much so

98
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,039
that's kind of good to know

99
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,080
weather's a little icky out today

100
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,960
all right let's see if we can get this

101
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,960
plowed out nice

102
00:08:27,960 --> 00:08:35,850
[Music]

103
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,560
wow i like having this on a boom i could

104
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,839
i could pick it up and just shove stuff

105
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,640
way back

106
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:56,560
that again give that another sweep

107
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:58,320
i think we're gonna get more snowing i'm

108
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:02,480
gonna have to plow again

109
00:08:58,320 --> 00:09:02,480
before we open on thursday

110
00:09:02,720 --> 00:09:06,279
we'll see what happens

111
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:31,920
ah scraped up a little grass

112
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,800
nothing too bad

113
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,920
be really nice if the sun came out

114
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:45,920
melted this stuff

115
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:52,839
almost kept hitting the wrong lever

116
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,880
all right we're gonna get close to the

117
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,880
building

118
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,560
what i like about this work master i got

119
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,560
the uh forward reverse shuttle

120
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,399
and a regular standard shift

121
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,440
everybody wants hydrostatic hydrostatic

122
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:37,760
sucks down more power

123
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:41,040
and honestly this reverse shuttle is

124
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,640
the shift on the fly back and forth

125
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,040
you can almost if you're not going too

126
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,480
fast you can shift it without clutching

127
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,800
i don't know how they work it but it

128
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:48,800
works

129
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:06,000
all righty where am i going now

130
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:46,229
yeah i gotta finish this out

131
00:11:06,000 --> 00:11:46,229

135
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:45,320

[Music]

138
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:02,639
all right i think i got her good enough

139
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:04,399
anyway

140
00:13:02,639 --> 00:13:07,360
yeah the only weird thing is depending

141
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:09,440
on where the angle is

142
00:13:07,360 --> 00:13:12,440
i gotta i gotta roll the bucket back or

143
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,440
forth

144
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:49,519
got to be careful getting in the barn i

145
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:52,240
don't want to crash into anything

146
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:52,240
tight squeeze

147
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:58,000
all right

148
00:14:00,320 --> 00:14:05,360
and we're back let's see if our welds

149
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,320
held up i think they did

150
00:14:05,360 --> 00:14:08,160
ah

151
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:09,680
nothing seems broke but i don't have to

152
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,000
do something with these hoses this one's

153
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:13,600
ripping way down there

154
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,480
ah i don't know

155
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,839
get it like this i'm probably just gonna

156
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:19,920
oh you guys trying to attach them there

157
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,760
or something i don't know

158
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,199
but looks like i got them plenty long

159
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:24,639
enough

160
00:14:23,199 --> 00:14:26,320
all right well

161
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:27,279
that looks like about a wrap for right

162
00:14:26,320 --> 00:14:28,959
now

163
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,279
so just a little video doing some

164
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:33,440
plowing uh if you like my videos like

165
00:14:31,279 --> 00:14:35,279
and subscribe and share that'll be great

166
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:36,639
trying to build up a little channel here

167
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,600
so uh

168
00:14:36,639 --> 00:14:43,959
go ahead and hit that subscribe button

169
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,959
and that's always good for the algorithm

170
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,800
it's so mysterious an algorithmic
