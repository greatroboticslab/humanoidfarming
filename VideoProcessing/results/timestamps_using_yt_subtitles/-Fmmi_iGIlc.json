  "text": "Backyard composting can sometimes be a challenge\n\u2013 figuring out a spot that\u2019s going to be warm enough, where you can access it with\nwater to keep it moist. And then there\u2019s also that challenge of\njust keeping it corralled. If you\u2019re looking for a quick and simple\noption, you might consider building one out of 2x4\u2019s and a little bit of wire mesh screen. You can find these materials at local hardware\nstores for a relatively low cost. Generally speaking, we want a compost container\nthat is a minimum of three feet wide, by three feet wide, by three feet tall. For the backyard compost container that we\u2019re\nbuilding today, we\u2019ll simply be using 2x4s that we attach together, using a few 2\u201d\nscrews. We\u2019ll also then use some wire mesh screen\nthat we\u2019ll attach with a few staples. Build four sides. Use hinges on each of the corners. And then we can actually shut that container\nand dump material in once it\u2019s all been built. Now, we\u2019ve selected the wire mesh because\nthat will actually help allow air movement into that compost pile. And then we went with the hinges so we can\nactually open that container back up later, and actually stir that material around when\nneeded. If you need more information on composting,\nplease visit the University of Wyoming Extension website or go to BarnyardsAndBackyards.com From the University of Wyoming Extension,\nI\u2019m Brian Sebade, and you\u2019re watching From the Ground Up.",
