00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,759
ohio grazing council

4
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,599
web update hey sorry that we haven't

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:10,320
been in touch here in the last few weeks

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,480
we have been

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,400
very busy in the office this is equipped

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,240
contracting period for

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,840
beth and i and all the rest of the nrcs

10
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:20,080
soil and water folks

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,359
we just been swamped at the office and

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:23,680
didn't have a time to

13
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:24,800
to put out an update or or do a past

14
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:26,880
year walk

15
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:29,119
but the good news is we're going back

16
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,399
pastor walking this month and so

17
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:35,680
we wanted to do one last update

18
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:37,440
before we go past your walking so let's

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,559
get started

20
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:42,559
i thought i'd talk just a second about

21
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,800
what we're looking for with grass

22
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,320
this time of year we talked about

23
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,239
leaving the forage or

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,399
ochre grass and fescue to third leaf

25
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,360
stage we did that in this field

26
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,800
um and so what what is it that we're

27
00:00:53,360 --> 00:00:56,879
looking for now and

28
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,879
last three days i've come home and dad

29
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,600
daddy said well they didn't eat nothing

30
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,879
he said it's not down we we don't need

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:05,199
to move them yet tonight

32
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,640
well my answer is it always they always

33
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,040
need to move no matter what

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,240
um if i errored and gave them too big a

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,320
field and they didn't eat it all then

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:15,680
that's my fault not there so

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,880
but outside of that

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,960
our theory this time of year is we just

39
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,320
want them to top graze we just want them

40
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,159
to graze off the top

41
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:25,600
leaf and i'm standing here looking down

42
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,439
the fence for a reason because you can

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,600
kind of see the difference

44
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:35,040
uh if i pan one way very slowly

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,400
and you see that you say boy that's not

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,119
enough they didn't eat any of that

47
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:40,079
but then if you look down the fence you

48
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,920
can see the difference

49
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:44,720
between the two the important point here

50
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:46,720
is

51
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,159
we're just trying to keep it vegetative

52
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:48,799
we're just trying to graze the top

53
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:51,200
growth

54
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
keep it vegetative for as long as we

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,119
possibly can

56
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:55,680
we only get these six seven months of

57
00:01:55,119 --> 00:01:59,360
growth

58
00:01:55,680 --> 00:02:00,719
to be able to graze um newly grown grass

59
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,920
and we need to make the most of those

60
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,439
six seven months

61
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:05,680
so that we can graze the rest of the

62
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,200
year we hope and that's one big

63
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,119
difference too and i keep

64
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,160
in my mind is right now it's totally

65
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,039
different i'm just trying to keep it

66
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:12,800
vegetative

67
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:14,720
come august first i won't have

68
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,800
everything graced i don't

69
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,239
i want all the mob grazing pretty much

70
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,040
to be over by then

71
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,000
or at least i want enough mob graze

72
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
stuff ahead

73
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:26,720
of me to get to november 1st

74
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,480
so it's a smaller area it's not taking

75
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,959
out my whole farm and while i'm grazing

76
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:33,680
that i've got the whole farm

77
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:35,599
graze are growing for stockpiled grass

78
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,440
we've got to do a better job of taking

79
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,360
advantage of the days that we're given

80
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,519
to grow grass we can't waste them we

81
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,080
can't waste sunshine and rain

82
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:46,000
during the growing season in favor of

83
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,560
the non-growing season so

84
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:50,000
everything about what we do for grass

85
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:52,080
and grass management should be

86
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,080
not wasting those vegetative days

87
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:56,000
keeping that plant vegetative as long as

88
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,879
we possibly can

89
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:59,840
just uh saw this as i was coming in you

90
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:01,599
can see the post

91
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,080
sticking up there that's a fence that i

92
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,720
just took down it was three strand had

93
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,519
the sheep

94
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,720
on the left side cows on the right side

95
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:10,560
and you can kind of see why

96
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:12,239
because we called the right side the

97
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,480
badlands because it's

98
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:18,159
very steep a very rough slips

99
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,400
and tends to grow up in waterflower rows

100
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:21,519
and we've got some modifier rose control

101
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,280
ahead of us we've

102
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,720
done part of this field last year we'll

103
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:26,480
do the rest of it hopefully this year if

104
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,200
it gets dry enough but anyway

105
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,799
what i wanted to show was the difference

106
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,319
in grazing height

107
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:34,879
from one side to the other now granted

108
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:38,640
the sheep field has had

109
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:42,400
let's see one two three four five days

110
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:45,120
of rest five days more than the cow side

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,000
but it's a stark difference in the

112
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,280
grazing height

113
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:52,319
i hope you all can see that but

114
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,040
uh in five days we've got some really

115
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,000
massive regrowth on the sheep side

116
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,519
where it's only been two days since the

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,200
cows were on this side so

118
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,760
i haven't really got the regrowth yet

119
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:06,239
but it just shows

120
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:07,760
what we really look for in the spring if

121
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:09,280
i have my drillers i want the fields to

122
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:11,280
graze like the left side

123
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:12,640
more than the right side the reason this

124
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:14,319
is grazed like this is because

125
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,680
you can see it's a pathway to get to

126
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:16,880
another field so

127
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,199
they graze it tight because they're

128
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,759
going toward that gate but um

129
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:23,040
i know that the left side doesn't look

130
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,639
like it's grays it doesn't look like

131
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:25,680
it's grazed enough but if you get out

132
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:28,479
there in there

133
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:30,320
you may find in this one acre field you

134
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,759
may find 10 seed heads

135
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:34,160
baby seed heads just starting to come

136
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
out the rest have all been nipped off

137
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,360
and that will keep that plant vegetative

138
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:39,120
until next rotation

139
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,880
next rotation hopefully they'll nip them

140
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,440
10 off but they'll leave 10 behind and

141
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,960
we'll still have 10 seed heads but

142
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,960
hopefully we keep it a little more

143
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:47,919
vegetative this way and we're growing a

144
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,800
forage bank

145
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,520
ahead of us this way take home message

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:53,759
is

147
00:04:51,520 --> 00:04:54,720
i know it doesn't look grazed in the

148
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,199
spring

149
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,360
when we only graze this much but the

150
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,800
regrowth is going to be so much more and

151
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,039
this is something we want to carry

152
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,560
kind of through the entire season if we

153
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,759
let them graze too close

154
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:09,440
early in the season it tends to allow

155
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,720
them to over graze through the rest of

156
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,000
the season

157
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,080
kevin's talked about going out and

158
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,080
mowing with a with a this mower

159
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,000
at a four inch height and it kind of

160
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:18,800
makes that bottom of that plant that

161
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,080
four inches

162
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,800
kind of makes it stemmy and harder

163
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
and more lignified i guess woody i guess

164
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:27,840
is the term for it

165
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,120
and that keeps the the cows from grazing

166
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:30,320
down so low

167
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,919
and that's kind of what we want to do

168
00:05:30,320 --> 00:05:33,440
with the cows rather than doing it with

169
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,759
a mower if we can

170
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,800
or sheep or whatever we're grazing with

171
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,880
but

172
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:40,000
i know it's hard this is the roughest

173
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,440
time of year to graze

174
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,520
it's the time when i make the most

175
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:44,000
mistakes believe me i make them tons of

176
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,160
them

177
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,600
i got a field right now that one side is

178
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:48,400
not grazed enough the other side's

179
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:49,680
grazed too much

180
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,440
should have moved him last night but it

181
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,000
was pouring down rain and that's just

182
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,840
the way things

183
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:58,080
go so just a little picture of

184
00:05:55,840 --> 00:05:58,880
what i like to see i like to see it just

185
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:00,560
nipped off

186
00:05:58,880 --> 00:06:02,000
this stuff's going to grow so fast we're

187
00:06:00,560 --> 00:06:04,080
going to get back to it we'll leave that

188
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,600
forage bank we'll get back to it later

189
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:07,840
that will come in handy later on the

190
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:10,080
season when things slow down

191
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,840
one question i get this time of year all

192
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,759
the time and it's something that i

193
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:16,240
struggle with as well

194
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:16,800
is uh the sorting that we see out there

195
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:19,039
when

196
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:21,360
the cows first go out how much they

197
00:06:19,039 --> 00:06:22,880
graze certain patches really tight in

198
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:24,160
certain patches they don't seem to

199
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:25,919
hardly touch

200
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:28,240
and and i've struggled with that for

201
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,680
years and how to make that right and how

202
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,560
how to get them to

203
00:06:29,680 --> 00:06:33,199
graze more uniformly the entire pasture

204
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:35,280
field

205
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:37,120
just happened to be watching a video

206
00:06:35,280 --> 00:06:40,000
from dr alan williams

207
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,000
and gabe brown and they suggested that

208
00:06:40,000 --> 00:06:44,319
that we just didn't have the animal

209
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:46,560
impact that we needed to we weren't

210
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:48,240
having we didn't have as many pounds per

211
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:50,400
acre as we should have

212
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:51,840
to get them to graze that more uniformly

213
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:53,520
and it's tough to do

214
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:55,360
this time of year even for someone like

215
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,880
me who regularly

216
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,000
has a very high stocking rate per acre

217
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,000
when i'm grazing

218
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,840
it's tough to get those high stalking

219
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:07,120
rates this time of year and so

220
00:07:03,840 --> 00:07:07,919
uh dr alan williams proposed a a

221
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,160
scenario

222
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:13,360
a way to fix our sorting problems or our

223
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:16,160
non-uniformity of our grazing

224
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,520
is to to to create a really high

225
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,319
stocking density

226
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:22,800
for a short duration of of each day for

227
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:25,919
several days five to seven days

228
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:27,919
uh in length and that will will tell the

229
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:30,319
cows that they need to go ahead

230
00:07:27,919 --> 00:07:31,840
and be uniform in their grace and not go

231
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,000
and sort and select

232
00:07:31,840 --> 00:07:35,280
certain plants so i started doing that

233
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,759
at our place

234
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,919
i just built a small paddock turn the

235
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,759
cattle into the field

236
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,440
just leave them there for half an hour

237
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:45,280
or an hour and then

238
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:46,879
go back in a half an hour an hour and

239
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,800
move them into their bigger field what

240
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:49,199
will last them for a 12 hour period or a

241
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:50,560
day

242
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,840
depending on what i'm going to do and

243
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,479
whether i'm going to be home to move

244
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:54,240
them or not

245
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:56,720
and it seems to be working it seems to

246
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:59,199
have have made the cows be more

247
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:00,879
uniform in their selection of the field

248
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,639
rather than going out and patchy

249
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,280
sort of grazing and not getting

250
00:08:02,639 --> 00:08:05,759
everything by doing this just building a

251
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:07,840
small

252
00:08:05,759 --> 00:08:09,599
paddock turning them in there making a

253
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:11,360
really high stocking density for that

254
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:12,000
half hour an hour and then turn them

255
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:14,800
into the bigger

256
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,479
field later uh seems to be working it

257
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,639
seems to actually

258
00:08:16,479 --> 00:08:19,759
be making those cows graze those fields

259
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:21,520
more uniformly

260
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:23,360
just thought i'd pass that along some

261
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:25,759
the rest of you may be struggling with

262
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,360
grazing uniformity this time of year and

263
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:29,039
and i think this is one way that we can

264
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,680
kind of train our cows to be more

265
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:34,640
uniform in their grazing pattern

266
00:08:31,680 --> 00:08:36,880
well i'm out moving the sheep it's about

267
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,800
seven o'clock at night

268
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,000
got one lamb there got the rest of them

269
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:44,080
gonna come with lambs here

270
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:47,200
pretty soon everybody's excited

271
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,640
one thing i wanted to show

272
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,880
and the sheep are going to course in the

273
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,440
background is we get a question all the

274
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,560
time

275
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,680
how big should my paddocks be and and

276
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:57,200
that answer always

277
00:08:55,680 --> 00:08:59,680
always gets a government answer it

278
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:02,080
depends now there's about

279
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,440
30 ewes in this bunch weighing about a

280
00:09:02,080 --> 00:09:06,959
hundred pound

281
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,200
there's 16 fat lambs

282
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,080
in here again weighing about 100 pounds

283
00:09:09,200 --> 00:09:11,040
and they're getting ready to start

284
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:13,040
lambing so

285
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,040
you can figure that based on body weight

286
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:16,800
how many pounds and how many inches and

287
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:18,880
all that that we need but

288
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,399
what i'll show you is one way that i do

289
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,080
it without doing math and

290
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,600
those of you that know me say but you

291
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:26,399
love doing math and i do

292
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:28,399
but we can make this work for those who

293
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:31,680
are not math inclined

294
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:32,800
so what i have try not to make you sick

295
00:09:31,680 --> 00:09:36,240
here by

296
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:37,120
but i want to show you best angle what i

297
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,720
have is

298
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:43,680
the field they were in yesterday

299
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:44,800
this field was they were in sunday till

300
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
sunday night

301
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,959
so they were in saturday morning at 10

302
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,959
o'clock they came in this field

303
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,519
and they went out on sunday at six

304
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:55,440
o'clock the reason they came over here

305
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:56,560
was because they started landing and

306
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,760
they were clean at the back of the farm

307
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:59,839
and i don't want them back at the farm

308
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,839
because there's no houses no nothing

309
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:03,760
close by the nearest thing to them there

310
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,760
is dylanville and it's about

311
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:06,880
3 000 feet straight down over the hill

312
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,959
so um

313
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:11,040
coyote heaven so we wanted to bring them

314
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,000
up closer to the barns and i can pay and

315
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,680
show you the

316
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,120
barns are right there and we'd be

317
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,320
working toward the barns as they start

318
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
lambing but

319
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:19,519
unfortunately we had this first set of

320
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,040
lambs and

321
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:23,040
and we haven't had any more and that

322
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:25,040
happens sometimes we start and it goes

323
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:26,640
great guns and we have tons of lambs and

324
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,920
sometimes we start we get a couple days

325
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:29,200
and then we get another one in a couple

326
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,640
days and all of a sudden bang we get

327
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,560
tons of lambs but

328
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:36,160
so what we did you can see my fence

329
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:37,680
daughter with my flower rose there

330
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,360
that's a permanent three-strand fence

331
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:42,720
runs down the middle of this field

332
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:44,720
makes these paddocks 263 feet wide

333
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:46,240
the posts are on 32 foot center so

334
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,360
that's how i calculate

335
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,920
what i'm gonna do with my fences so i

336
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:52,320
gave them

337
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:54,560
five posts not knowing how much forage

338
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,839
was in this field and how much

339
00:10:54,560 --> 00:11:01,200
we needed to give them i i

340
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:03,360
split it into five posts per paddock

341
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:04,800
put them in this field and as luck would

342
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,720
have it it was raining

343
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:07,760
sunday i didn't want a movement 10

344
00:11:06,720 --> 00:11:09,440
o'clock because that gets them off

345
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:13,040
schedule for me to

346
00:11:09,440 --> 00:11:16,079
move them again the next day

347
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:18,800
so i just

348
00:11:16,079 --> 00:11:19,760
left them there i left them there to

349
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:21,120
figure out

350
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:23,040
whether that was enough or whether it

351
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,839
was too much or what came up here

352
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:28,560
between the raindrops six o'clock sunday

353
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:29,120
and this field is grazed what i consider

354
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:31,839
to be

355
00:11:29,120 --> 00:11:34,959
perfectly first new spring growth and

356
00:11:31,839 --> 00:11:38,480
i'll try to bend down and show you

357
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,640
new spring growth just right just tipped

358
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:43,760
the ends of the fescue plants

359
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:47,200
ate the clover but not too low

360
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,279
um just a perfect grace so

361
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,800
the way we figure our paddocks here is

362
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320
and you're gonna say well

363
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,000
you left them here for more than 24

364
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
hours how's that perfect well the way we

365
00:11:54,000 --> 00:12:00,240
do that is

366
00:11:55,600 --> 00:12:02,560
they were in here for 32 hours

367
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,720
five posts 32 hours divide that out

368
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:07,920
multiply it by 24

369
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:10,160
and you get 3.75 posts i know most of

370
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:10,880
you didn't want to do the math what i'm

371
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:13,440
saying is

372
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:15,680
five posts was too much for 24 hours so

373
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,760
reduce it down by one post

374
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:19,279
see how it goes the next day if it's too

375
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,360
much

376
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,880
reduce it down again if it's too little

377
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,680
give them a little bit more

378
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:28,160
if your whole field is is of one height

379
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:30,720
you can do that i mean it doesn't hurt

380
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,279
to to figure it out with the animals how

381
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,720
much

382
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,079
actually needs to be out there it's

383
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:35,920
actually a good way to figure out

384
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,360
backward how many pounds of animal we

385
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:38,959
have out here in the field

386
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,880
figure out how much grass you have how

387
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
many pounds per inch figure out how much

388
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:43,600
they ate in 24 hours

389
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:45,519
that'll give you a pretty good idea how

390
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:46,240
many pounds you've got out there without

391
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:47,760
a scale

392
00:12:46,240 --> 00:12:49,360
it's not going to be perfect it's not

393
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,279
may not even be close but at least it's

394
00:12:49,360 --> 00:12:55,360
a number for you to do but

395
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:57,200
that's how i do my paddock divisions

396
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:59,440
especially with the cows later in the

397
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:01,680
summer i start into a field

398
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:03,200
give them a piece next day is that too

399
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:04,399
much is it too little

400
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,160
well i'll give them a little more give

401
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:07,839
them a little less until we get about

402
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:09,680
right and then once the spring flush

403
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:12,320
really hits

404
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:12,800
we're very rarely ever wrong we're gonna

405
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,440
be

406
00:13:12,800 --> 00:13:17,279
right more than not i mean and then your

407
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720
grazer's eye kicks in too and you look

408
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:19,920
at this field and say well this one's a

409
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,120
little thinner or this one's a little

410
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:22,880
thicker let's give them a little more

411
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,200
let's give them a little less

412
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:26,320
but we're not going to err that bad by

413
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,839
doing it i mean we're going to leave

414
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:30,000
some forage behind and that's what we

415
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:32,399
want to do anyway but

416
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:34,320
um just a good way to come up with what

417
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,800
size should your paddocks be in and yet

418
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,639
another reason

419
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,639
for those of you that don't like

420
00:13:38,639 --> 00:13:42,480
temporary fence this is the reason why

421
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,040
we use temporary fence as i said this

422
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,880
this these two paddocks are 263 feet

423
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,600
wide they're 1200 feet long

424
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:51,680
so i can make my paddocks bigger or

425
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,440
smaller depending on what we need

426
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:55,120
once i put the steers in with these

427
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:56,320
lambs and sheep once they're done

428
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,240
lambing

429
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,000
we'll go back up so we'll go back up

430
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,680
usually it's around five posts that's

431
00:14:00,000 --> 00:14:03,519
why i started with five and then worked

432
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:06,639
my way down but

433
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:08,959
um just a good way to figure out what

434
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,720
size your panics need to be and because

435
00:14:08,959 --> 00:14:11,920
i've got temporary fence i can make them

436
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:13,600
smaller or bigger

437
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:15,199
and because i've got temporary fence i

438
00:14:13,600 --> 00:14:17,120
can take this all down

439
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:19,440
spread fertilizer spread manure winter

440
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:21,440
feed on it whatever it is i want to do

441
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:22,639
i can mow it all at one time brush all

442
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:24,399
get all at one time

443
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:26,240
i can mow portions of it at one time if

444
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,160
i want to so

445
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:32,480
just a good quick lesson on how we

446
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:34,079
size our paddocks i hope that wasn't too

447
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,160
complicated but

448
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:38,079
it's really not if you break it down to

449
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,519
its bare bits we we just give them a

450
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,959
piece of grass and we come back and

451
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,839
check on them every couple hours over

452
00:14:40,959 --> 00:14:44,399
the weekend

453
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:44,880
we know when it gets exactly right and

454
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:46,959
then we

455
00:14:44,880 --> 00:14:48,399
divide it out depending on the hours

456
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:49,360
when you like to do the math that's fine

457
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,880
if not

458
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:56,079
give them 24 hours if it's too much

459
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,880
make it smaller if they ate too little

460
00:14:56,079 --> 00:15:01,120
the other way around and just go from

461
00:14:58,880 --> 00:15:01,120
there

462
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,959
hey little guy i'm not your mama your

463
00:15:04,720 --> 00:15:09,760
mama's over there

464
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:09,760
there's your mama

465
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,560
people often wonder how we move sheep

466
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,360
with little lambs like that well we try

467
00:15:14,560 --> 00:15:20,160
not to move them when they're brand new

468
00:15:17,360 --> 00:15:21,040
but that little guy's six days old today

469
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:23,040
so

470
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,320
he's moving pretty good now we don't

471
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:25,360
have any trouble moving them once

472
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,880
they're that way

473
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:28,880
uh when we start having bunches and

474
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:31,279
lambs we just don't back fence it

475
00:15:28,880 --> 00:15:32,480
every day uh it makes kind of a pain

476
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:33,519
cause i gotta take fence down and put it

477
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,560
back up but

478
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,600
i do i take it down let them

479
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:41,279
find their way back to the new grass

480
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:42,399
every day i try to get a big field so

481
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,600
that i don't have to move them from

482
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,959
field to field when we lay them

483
00:15:45,600 --> 00:15:49,199

511
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:44,880

and in person pastor walks again i can't

517
00:16:53,680 --> 00:16:57,759
say how excited i

518
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:58,720
am that that's gonna happen i can't say

519
00:16:57,759 --> 00:17:02,000
how excited

520
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:02,720
we are to to get together again uh and

521
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,640
also

522
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:06,240
to be doing it in person instead of in

523
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,079
video format

524
00:17:06,240 --> 00:17:09,679
it's going to be great to to get to go

525
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:12,400
back to pasture walks and

526
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:13,679
and have discussion led by the folks who

527
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:16,799
are hosting the

528
00:17:13,679 --> 00:17:19,199
the county and hosting the pastor walk

529
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:21,120
and see what they're doing in their

530
00:17:19,199 --> 00:17:22,959
county and also on their grazing

531
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:25,520
operation

532
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:26,160
i guess that leads me to what are we

533
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:28,640
gonna do

534
00:17:26,160 --> 00:17:30,320
with these web updates uh we've had

535
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,559
considerable discussion and had

536
00:17:30,320 --> 00:17:33,520
considerable input over the last several

537
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:35,679
months of

538
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:36,960
uh how much folks enjoyed having these

539
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:38,320
web updates and

540
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,679
quite honestly when we started doing

541
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:40,880
this we were just filling the void we

542
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:42,720
wanted to make sure that the eastern

543
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:45,360
ohio grazing council folks

544
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:46,000
still got timely grazing information

545
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:48,799
that they were

546
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,960
used to from the in-person pasture walks

547
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:54,160
but would do it in video form

548
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:56,320
and we've had several folks uh

549
00:17:54,160 --> 00:17:57,919
call in to say you know we like what

550
00:17:56,320 --> 00:17:58,480
you're doing and we hope you keep doing

551
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,799
it

552
00:17:58,480 --> 00:18:03,120
and it's beth and i's hoping and our

553
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:05,280
plan to go ahead and video

554
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:07,200
our live and in person pasture walks in

555
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:09,440
the future get them edited and get them

556
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,679
posted to our youtube channel

557
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:12,799
beth and i have also had considerable

558
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,080
discussions about

559
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:16,000
whether we were going to continue to do

560
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,919
some updates now and then and and i

561
00:18:16,000 --> 00:18:20,880
think both of us believe it's

562
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,679
still a good thing to do some in-person

563
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,600
updates

564
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,520
uh with things that we see in the field

565
00:18:23,600 --> 00:18:27,600
some topics of discussion

566
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:28,720
some timely grazing information that may

567
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:30,080
not have been talked about at the

568
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:32,080
previous pasture walk

569
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:34,160
and and may not get talked about or may

570
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:34,559
be too late to talk about at our next

571
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:37,120
past

572
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:38,080
walk so uh it's our plan to still go

573
00:18:37,120 --> 00:18:40,000
ahead and do some

574
00:18:38,080 --> 00:18:42,400
some eastern ohio grazing council

575
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:45,120
updates from time to time uh

576
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:47,520
i guess my vision is to do some updates

577
00:18:45,120 --> 00:18:49,679
uh in the two-week interval between

578
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:51,520
pastor walks we got four weeks between

579
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,440
pasture walks to post them about two

580
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:54,559
weeks after the previous and two weeks

581
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:57,600
before the

582
00:18:54,559 --> 00:18:58,559
next pastor walk as time and information

583
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,880
allows

584
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:01,760
so with that i'll also say if any of you

585
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:05,039
have any

586
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:06,799
timely updates topics ideas suggestions

587
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:08,720
or if you've got some video that you'd

588
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:10,559
like for us to take a look at and

589
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:12,720
maybe post as an eastern algorithm

590
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:13,360
council update we would be glad to do

591
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:15,200
that

592
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:16,720
we'd also be glad to have those topics

593
00:19:15,200 --> 00:19:20,480
discussions ideas

594
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:23,760
for pastor walks in the future i i think

595
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:26,080
that's the vision for what we want to do

596
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:27,840
as far as the the eastern ohio grazing

597
00:19:26,080 --> 00:19:29,919
council web updates go

598
00:19:27,840 --> 00:19:31,280
i think we're going to be glad to go

599
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:33,600
ahead and post those

600
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:35,440
pastor walk videos just for those folks

601
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:36,640
who can't attend our live and in person

602
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,320
pasture walks and

603
00:19:36,640 --> 00:19:39,840
we'll see what the future holds as far

604
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:43,039
as web updates and

605
00:19:39,840 --> 00:19:43,360
things i can't say again how excited i

606
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:45,360
am

607
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:47,600
to go back to pasture walks i'm sure the

608
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,679
rest of the eastern ohio grazing council

609
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:52,000
would echo that sentiment we're going to

610
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:53,840
be glad to see all of you and have live

611
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,360
and in-person discussion and see where

612
00:19:53,840 --> 00:19:57,440
that discussion takes us

613
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:59,440
on the topics of grazing livestock in

614
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:02,799
eastern ohio and what we're seeing

615
00:19:59,440 --> 00:20:06,159
on our own farms so with that

616
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:08,080
i hope to see you may 27th at 6 pm at mr

617
00:20:06,159 --> 00:20:09,840
