00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,080
to produce sugar and many other products

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,439

00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:38,680
become much faster and more efficient

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:41,600
thanks to the help of Advanced Machinery

14
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:44,320
in the past planting sugar cane required

15
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,320
a lot of manual labor from digging

16
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,680
furrows to placing each section of sugar
