1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:03,919
all right everybody this is ross i

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,000
thought in today's video we would talk

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,040
all about pruning fruit trees and not

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,800
just

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,120
you know these peaches behind me here

6
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:12,960
but also a lot of the stone fruits a lot

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,280
of the apples the pears

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:17,039
we'll probably look at the persimmons

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:17,840
and we may even look at the grapes as

10
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,080
well

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,600
but i want to just cover pruning

12
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:22,640
and show you some of the pruning i've

13
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:24,960
been doing

14
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,640
over the last week or two

15
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,519
i've already at this point

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:32,559
come over the trees about two or three

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:34,559
times and have made my cuts

18
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:37,840
i've come back again later and then made

19
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,440
more cuts and have reevaluated the trees

20
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
and i thought it would just be you know

21
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:44,719
rather than just showing you guys

22
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:46,320
this whole process of every cut i made

23
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,760
i think that's an entertaining video but

24
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:51,039
i don't think it's a very educational

25
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:53,840
video i wanted to really just

26
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:56,559
show you guys the shape of the trees now

27
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:58,399
this i think is worth more than just

28
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,079
showing you where the cuts are

29
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,359
let me show you

30
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,600
and talk about why i made certain cuts

31
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:07,280
on these trees um

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:08,880
so that you get in it you can get an

33
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,040
understanding you know you can get the

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,960
blueprint you get the book

35
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,040
the manual so that when you actually do

36
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:17,280
this at home on your own trees

37
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:18,720
this makes a lot more sense to you

38
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,080
we're going to show you guys older trees

39
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:22,799
younger trees

40
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,040
trees of different sized root stocks

41
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:27,920
and many different species of trees so

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:30,000
these are the espalier peaches

43
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,600
the only real way that peaches work and

44
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
every tree is different

45
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:36,479
is if you renew the wood every year

46
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:38,799
right you have to have one year old wood

47
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:40,479
to get the fruit buds so this is one

48
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,680
year old wood you can tell by the color

49
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,920
of the wood

50
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,759
it's typically a redder color

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,240
and the older it gets it becomes more

52
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,920
gray or more brown

53
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:52,000
so you need to have one-year-old wood

54
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:54,560
but if if you have a tree as an example

55
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,159
that's an espalier which is really not

56
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
what you should do

57
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,079
or even if you had a tree that was a vas

58
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:01,840
shape you still have to renew that wood

59
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,040
it doesn't necessarily matter what the

60
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:04,719
form is

61
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:06,320
you got to make sure that you can set up

62
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,479
a system and that's kind of what i've

63
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:10,640
done up here at this top tier

64
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:13,040
right we have three tiers

65
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,599
in this espalier system

66
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,440
you have to set up this open vase open

67
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:19,680
vog shape because you're going to be

68
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:20,959
able to renew the wood a lot easier that

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,879
way

70
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:24,720
now

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,040
as an example we've already cut out a

72
00:02:24,720 --> 00:02:29,760
number of these

73
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,160
big scaffolds here big branches that

74
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,160
were three or four years in age so you

75
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,680
can see this one here this branch is

76
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:39,280
probably three or four years old as well

77
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,360
and there's a number of these these are

78
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,959
probably two or three years old

79
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:44,080
this one back there is probably four

80
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,920
years old

81
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:48,239
this one coming out in front of me that

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:51,120
actually is quite a nice branch i like

83
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:53,040
this one how it leans outwards

84
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:55,599
getting that sunlight and opening up

85
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,519
that center of this top tier

86
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,680
this is probably four years old as well

87
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,519
so

88
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:03,519
you know some of these scaffolds on a

89
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,239
typical tree and we're going to look at

90
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:07,760
that typical shape in a minute of what a

91
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,920
what a peach tree really should look

92
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,239
like

93
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:14,080
when you have something like that

94
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,640
you know you want to be able to take out

95
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,879
these scaffolds at a certain age to thin

96
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:21,200
this out and then have the scaffolds

97
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,040
renew and replace themselves over time

98
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:26,080
so these younger ones here

99
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,920
are coming in to take up this space

100
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:29,599
but at some point having both of these

101
00:03:27,920 --> 00:03:31,760
two right next to each other or maybe

102
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:33,120
even this one right next to this one is

103
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
just not gonna work we're not getting

104
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,400
enough light

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,920
we're not getting enough airflow and

106
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:39,519
especially in the summer i mean if you

107
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,040
can imagine these trees i've done a

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:43,040
great job this year

109
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,680
of opening up that center you can throw

110
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,599
something right through that

111
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,599
but even in the growing season in the

112
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,280
summer this is going to fill itself in

113
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,720
real quick right in that center so you

114
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
got to come in here

115
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:58,000
if you want good fruit quality you want

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:59,680
less disease pressure on your fruits

117
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,000
and even on your trees you got to come

118
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,480
in here and thin out the center and even

119
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,159
keep up with that during the summer

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:08,319
so that's what i've kind of focused on

121
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,879
this this bottom layer here of uh

122
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,879
espaliers typically what i like to do no

123
00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:14,400
matter what the species is

124
00:04:12,879 --> 00:04:17,440
have the tr have the branching come

125
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:20,479
outwards and sort of downwards

126
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:23,199
um and that way it can uh you know take

127
00:04:20,479 --> 00:04:24,960
up this lower space it's easy to harvest

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:25,919
even if i were to cut off everything up

129
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,520
here

130
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:29,199
i still would get a great harvest from

131
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:30,880
what's below

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,080
and it would get good light you know in

133
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:33,759
that sense

134
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:35,120
but if you're gonna have this upper

135
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,120
stuff again

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:39,520
and this is exactly what i focused on is

137
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:41,840
cutting this stuff out in the center

138
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:44,000
and making big cuts you know we cut out

139
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,000
a scaffold there

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:47,759
we cut out another scaffold right there

141
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,280
and there

142
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:53,520
smaller cuts actually on on those trees

143
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,080
or on those branches and i've kind of

144
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,680
thinned this out a bit more

145
00:04:56,080 --> 00:04:59,680
what i probably should do is even

146
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:03,360
consider this again

147
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,360
is because right here we have one two

148
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,840
three potential new scaffolds that are

149
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,880
coming in of a similar age i don't need

150
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,440
all that

151
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:14,000
you know even this branch here kind of

152
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,720
is shaded out by this taller thing this

153
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,160
taller system excuse the camera

154
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:20,479
right above it

155
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,320
so again this one here is kind of shaded

156
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:24,240
out by this

157
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,199
right here and if you kind of picture

158
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,759
this it's hard to imagine

159
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:32,080
but this whole thing right in this area

160
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,199
is kind of a mess so

161
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:34,479
that's

162
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:36,840
just the struggles you know and it's

163
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,400
better i think to cut out more than less

164
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:40,880
because

165
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,320
you know like i said all this stuff down

166
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:44,880
there at the bottom

167
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,440
will give me so much fruit i mean how

168
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:50,160
many peaches can you possibly eat

169
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,400
in a season i mean

170
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:54,160
it's crazy how many peaches i get we're

171
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:56,960
talking this year probably

172
00:05:54,160 --> 00:05:59,360
it's going to be easily in the thousands

173
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,680
so how can i eat that many also i don't

174
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,960
want to preserve that many or really any

175
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,400
at all

176
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:06,240
so the best thing i can do is give them

177
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,759
away but giving away you know hundreds

178
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:09,919
of peaches peaches

179
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,000
you know that can be uh

180
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,919
a difficult task

181
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,000
unless you got like a food bank or

182
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
something so

183
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:19,919
you know i don't know to me it's just

184
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:22,400
not worth it to have all this disease

185
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:25,120
pressure up here that then lowers the

186
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:26,720
fruit quality on the entire tree

187
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,240
you know it's all about getting that

188
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:30,319
light not just

189
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:31,600
you know having that open center because

190
00:06:30,319 --> 00:06:34,000
that gets you

191
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:36,720
the light in the center it makes use of

192
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,680
the most photosynthesis on these trees

193
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:39,440
right

194
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:41,759
you want to be able to have every single

195
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,199
leaf getting photosynthesis that is

196
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:45,280
going to give you the most amount of

197
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,520
sugars and carbohydrates

198
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,120
the tree can generate to then put that

199
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:50,080
into the fruits and you're going to see

200
00:06:49,120 --> 00:06:52,240
that

201
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:54,319
in the the measure of your bricks if you

202
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:56,800
were to take the bricks squeeze out some

203
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,639
juice put it on a refractometer

204
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:00,479
you would see a higher brix just by

205
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:03,759
having a more open center

206
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,919
having more photosynthesis hit your tree

207
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,160
that's absolutely critical the other big

208
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:11,520
benefit is the air flow which then

209
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:12,800
uh you have less disease pressure

210
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:14,720
right so it's a no-brainer on the

211
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:16,639
peaches you get something called rot and

212
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,000
it happens all the time in these humid

213
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,520
climates

214
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:21,599
it's so hard to fight and you could

215
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,120
fight it with sprays and other things

216
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:25,440
that you might want to do but just

217
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:26,319
having the right form can go such a long

218
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:28,080
way

219
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:29,039
i mean it's almost impossible to avoid

220
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:31,199
it

221
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:33,039
but like i said if you get the right

222
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,039
form and if you if i cut out more up

223
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
here then probably

224
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:37,919
i really should come in here again i

225
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,840
need to come in here again to these

226
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,240
trees specifically they grow so quickly

227
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:45,440
their standards i need to thin this out

228
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,879
even better than i have

229
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:48,800
i'm going to get the best fruit quality

230
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,479
possible and this alberta

231
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:51,840
that's what this tree here is is here on

232
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:53,759
the right

233
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,000
did not fruit and has never really

234
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,840
fruited that well in terms of its fruit

235
00:07:56,000 --> 00:07:58,960
quality right it's put out plenty of

236
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,479
fruits

237
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:02,960
but the quality's never been up there

238
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,639
and i wonder if oh well maybe it's a lot

239
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,800
to do with the way i was pruning my

240
00:08:04,639 --> 00:08:08,960
trees you know i it's crazy you think

241
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,520
you know about pruning

242
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,120
so you really get a crop of peaches or a

243
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:16,080
crop of plums

244
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,080
and they're just a disaster you know

245
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:19,280
here over here let's see this is a

246
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,599
younger

247
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:23,680
persimmon tree

248
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:24,960
and this guy is getting its form this is

249
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,639
proc

250
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:28,000
i probably could cut this out but i'd

251
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:29,599
rather

252
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:31,599
you know get all the fruit i could but

253
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:34,000
this is the main leader here and i've

254
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,399
made a cut there to cut out that central

255
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:38,000
leader open this up a bit more you can

256
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,360
see the scaffolds

257
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:43,200
one two three four and we have some uh

258
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:44,959
scaffolds up here potentially if i want

259
00:08:43,200 --> 00:08:46,640
to cut out something

260
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,880
lower down on the tree like this one

261
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,560
probably will come out in the future

262
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
as it might be a bit more shaded than

263
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,560
the others

264
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,480
just based on the angle of the sun

265
00:08:54,560 --> 00:08:59,519
this is kind of the standard thing right

266
00:08:56,480 --> 00:09:01,440
you want to get your tree grow it up

267
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:05,440
and don't be afraid to cut it you know

268
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:07,440
that single stem whip as an example

269
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,680
don't be afraid to make that cut do i

270
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,680
have any single stem whips at this point

271
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:13,600
i mean this is kind of

272
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,480
here's a young

273
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:17,760
seijo persimmon here it's just the main

274
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:19,600
whip at this point there's some

275
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
branching here at the top

276
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:22,880
i just really want this thing to grow

277
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,560
it's been taking a while to get

278
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,320
established but uh

279
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:27,600
you know that's it's very similar thing

280
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,839
is that you want it to grow up as a

281
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:31,920
single stem whip cut it back at a

282
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:33,680
certain height maybe around your knee

283
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,519
maybe at your waist depending on how

284
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:38,080
tall you want your tree

285
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:40,480
same thing over here with this quince

286
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,360
this guy actually got killed back

287
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,080
um

288
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:46,320
by some branching that fell on it

289
00:09:44,080 --> 00:09:48,640
from the the shade tree above

290
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:50,000
you can see that big shade tree there

291
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:52,080
it's the same thing you want to make

292
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,080
your cuts bring it back to a lower

293
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:57,040
height and it'll start sending out these

294
00:09:54,080 --> 00:09:58,800
branches so even though i have you know

295
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,399
two nice branches here on the left and

296
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:02,000
right

297
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,839
what i want to do is actually take off

298
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,519
the tips and what i probably want to do

299
00:10:03,839 --> 00:10:07,440
is even bring it back even further at a

300
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:09,120
lower height and really get that

301
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,519
branching to come in

302
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,920
at a lower point

303
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,680
the more space over here this is more

304
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,079
traditional sense

305
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:19,839
younger trees these are plums of what

306
00:10:18,079 --> 00:10:21,920
you might actually want to do with the

307
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,200
with your aspaya is actually grow

308
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,279
something that should be a spy a to plum

309
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:29,519
it's very similar situation having the

310
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,000
lower growth down here

311
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:34,000
forming this open center at the top and

312
00:10:32,000 --> 00:10:35,760
even if i wanted to i could bring this

313
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,800
these branches way back

314
00:10:35,760 --> 00:10:40,959
and have some lower uh branching here

315
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:43,360
keep that in check in the summer

316
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:45,040
rather than letting this grow all summer

317
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,880
just keeping it in check and i would get

318
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:48,480
nice plums

319
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:51,839
i don't have to have

320
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:55,120
crazy sized espaye trees right they

321
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,120
don't have to get like that

322
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:58,640
you know i think it's nice to have all

323
00:10:56,720 --> 00:10:59,519
that fruit but

324
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:00,880
um

325
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:02,320
you don't really have to do that you

326
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,959
don't have to maintain the trees like

327
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:07,360
that i could if i really wanted to like

328
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:09,680
i said bring back that top layer in the

329
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,480
summer i mean we're talking about winter

330
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:14,560
pruning right now but

331
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:17,440
to be honest with you summer pruning is

332
00:11:14,560 --> 00:11:19,120
really important and i i think it's um

333
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:21,600
something i'm really really going to

334
00:11:19,120 --> 00:11:22,880
focus on this year on all the trees

335
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:25,120
you know i think it's important to get

336
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:27,040
them established and not really worry

337
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:29,440
too much about summer pruning where i'm

338
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:32,240
at maybe in a longer season climate

339
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:34,320
that'd be something you would do

340
00:11:32,240 --> 00:11:36,079
but getting them established i think you

341
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:37,760
could just do that in the winter by keep

342
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:40,560
cutting them back to a lower height

343
00:11:37,760 --> 00:11:42,640
getting that branching that you want

344
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:45,680
keep doing that over time you're going

345
00:11:42,640 --> 00:11:47,600
to see success the birds are uh

346
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,440
they're out and about it's just so warm

347
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:51,040
out right now

348
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,480
and then if i bring you guys over here i

349
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:54,000
want to show you these two plantings

350
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,720
this is really critical i think you'll

351
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,800
learn a lot from these two here's

352
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,120
actually by the way two of our cherries

353
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:03,120
the white gold and the black gold

354
00:12:01,120 --> 00:12:05,440
just cut out the center that's all i

355
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:08,000
really did made sure i even cut out the

356
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:09,600
center within the trees themselves

357
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:11,519
to have even more of an open center i

358
00:12:09,600 --> 00:12:13,120
made a big cut

359
00:12:11,519 --> 00:12:14,880
right in there i think i need to

360
00:12:13,120 --> 00:12:16,639
actually get a saw and chop that out i

361
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,079
forgot about that

362
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:19,519
but uh opening up the center of the

363
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:21,279
trees but also making sure there's

364
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:22,959
nothing here in the middle

365
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,839
you know even in the future probably

366
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:28,000
cutting out some of this other stuff

367
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,880
that's going towards each other

368
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,639
you got to keep that center clear

369
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:34,959
and this is a great really good example

370
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:36,959
over here because

371
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:39,760
these trees are my plums

372
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,440
um plum cots

373
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,040
and apricots

374
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,560
so these are all very similar in how

375
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,760
they fruit

376
00:12:44,560 --> 00:12:47,760
and

377
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:49,839
you can see i've done a an interesting

378
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,279
thing here that you know dave wilson

379
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,720
nursery has

380
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,800
promoted and other people have

381
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:57,680
recommended where you

382
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,040
plant a lot of trees in the same hole

383
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:00,560
and you can see look how many of those

384
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:02,800
white things down there at the bottom

385
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,480
there is there's quite a bit there's one

386
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:06,800
two three four five six seven eight

387
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:09,279
there's eight trees

388
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,880
in a very small area

389
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,639
you know it's just not something i would

390
00:13:10,880 --> 00:13:13,839
recommend it's it's difficult to

391
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,680
maintain

392
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:17,200
you don't really need to do this

393
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,880
you plant one tree in the center and

394
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:20,639
then you graft all the varieties onto

395
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:23,360
that one tree

396
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,040
probably a standard is the way to go

397
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,320
and

398
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,959
i think that's a little bit more

399
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:31,839
difficult for the average person but

400
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,399
it's way more difficult i think

401
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,240
to maintain this and especially if you

402
00:13:34,399 --> 00:13:37,839
don't plant the trees correctly so this

403
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:39,760
one here

404
00:13:37,839 --> 00:13:43,680
you can kind of see

405
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:46,480
this tree is uh i think my satsuma

406
00:13:43,680 --> 00:13:47,839
or this might be the um

407
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:49,760
you see here

408
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,320
santa rosa so this is the santa rosa

409
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:55,440
plum and this guy was just planted too

410
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:58,079
much in the center of this planting

411
00:13:55,440 --> 00:14:00,160
so it's kind of occupying weird space

412
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,600
and i've had to force the branching

413
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,880
outwards because you don't want anything

414
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:04,959
in the center right you want to be able

415
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,399
to throw that hat through the middle you

416
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,519
want to be able to even stand in the

417
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,279
center

418
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,120
this is going to fill in probably quite

419
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,839
a bit in the summer got to keep on top

420
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:15,199
of that as i said with the peaches

421
00:14:13,839 --> 00:14:17,760
but

422
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:22,160
this is kind of just positioned poorly i

423
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,160
i think and then even this plum cot

424
00:14:22,480 --> 00:14:26,959
this one here behind me i don't even

425
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:29,199
the tag is now gone

426
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:32,399
might be somewhere down here

427
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:34,959
but uh this guy was planted even even in

428
00:14:32,399 --> 00:14:37,120
an even worse position excuse me

429
00:14:34,959 --> 00:14:39,600
and i'll show you guys actually

430
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,639
what i mean

431
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:42,639
if you can see that

432
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:46,480
so ignoring these two trees this is a

433
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:47,600
bit weird because there was one here

434
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:50,320
that died

435
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,440
so this one was growing out this way

436
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:53,120
but

437
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:55,199
you see what i'm saying here is that

438
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:56,959
this is supposed to be clear

439
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,480
and this tree should be

440
00:14:56,959 --> 00:15:00,639
more over here

441
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:03,839
that was the santa rosa we looked at and

442
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:05,600
then this tree back here this plum cot

443
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,600
is right in the center of the whole damn

444
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,519
thing

445
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
and that's just not good

446
00:15:09,519 --> 00:15:14,639
because this thing is now occupying

447
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:17,279
all that space in the center

448
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:19,120
and i've really had to focus on pruning

449
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,920
all the growth that was growing out this

450
00:15:19,120 --> 00:15:23,279
way or growing out in in just the wrong

451
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:24,800
direction

452
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:27,519
and this tree is in a sense kind of

453
00:15:24,800 --> 00:15:30,160
paying for it last year and this is why

454
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,839
i've really come to this realization

455
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:33,839
you know just with the peaches we did a

456
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:34,880
video on the peach trees not too long

457
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:36,560
ago

458
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,000
and the peach

459
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:39,839
video that we did talked a lot about

460
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,040
disease and a lot about that alberta and

461
00:15:39,839 --> 00:15:42,639
how it didn't

462
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,240
put out good quality fruit and how it's

463
00:15:42,639 --> 00:15:45,360
really fighting with disease over here

464
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,600
and this planting that we're going to

465
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:50,560
look at in a minute

466
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:51,759
this tree here put out hundreds of

467
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:53,519
peaches

468
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:55,600
and it did not

469
00:15:53,519 --> 00:15:57,279
i did not get to eat a single one

470
00:15:55,600 --> 00:15:59,440
because of disease

471
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:01,360
i know bugs plunker curlio is definitely

472
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,959
a big part of that as well but

473
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:05,360
you know between the rot and the plumka

474
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:06,959
curlio i didn't eat a single one

475
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:09,040
and you know what they weren't even that

476
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:10,160
good they were nowhere near as good as

477
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:12,320
they should have been because i couldn't

478
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:14,320
get them to ripen to perfection

479
00:16:12,320 --> 00:16:16,079
and also because the tree was heavily

480
00:16:14,320 --> 00:16:17,680
shaded it was not getting the

481
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,680
photosynthesis it wasn't getting the

482
00:16:17,680 --> 00:16:21,839
bricks that these plums need

483
00:16:19,680 --> 00:16:23,920
so by opening this up and really pruning

484
00:16:21,839 --> 00:16:25,759
out a lot of this tree

485
00:16:23,920 --> 00:16:27,360
pruning out all the center we should

486
00:16:25,759 --> 00:16:28,480
have a lot more success this year with

487
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:29,440
this one

488
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:31,759
um

489
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:34,000
again it's just in a bad spot

490
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,079
you know this italian prune plum is just

491
00:16:34,000 --> 00:16:37,199
odd and how it's shaped and how it's

492
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:38,880
doing but

493
00:16:37,199 --> 00:16:40,880
you know we're making do with what we

494
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:43,120
got and i think this is just a really

495
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:44,399
good example of what not to do

496
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:46,800
and that's why i'm showing it to you

497
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:49,040
guys you know having this tree here in

498
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:50,880
the center if you're going to do this

499
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,639
here's how you should do it

500
00:16:50,880 --> 00:16:54,959
okay this is going to make a lot more

501
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:54,959
sense

502
00:16:55,839 --> 00:17:01,279
because i have another planting in the

503
00:16:57,199 --> 00:17:01,279
front these are peaches and nectarines

504
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:06,640
and the peaches and nectarines

505
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:09,199
in addition to the trees i already have

506
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:09,199
by the way

507
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:16,400
it's amazing actually that you can just

508
00:17:12,640 --> 00:17:16,400
walk right through the center of this

509
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:22,079
look how well pruned

510
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:23,679
that is

511
00:17:22,079 --> 00:17:24,559
i mean that just looks gorgeous doesn't

512
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:26,720
it

513
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:29,120
now this is the back side this is the

514
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:31,440
north side of the planting

515
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:33,440
the sun comes from over here on this

516
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:34,880
side of the house and then finally sets

517
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:36,000
over here

518
00:17:34,880 --> 00:17:38,240
west

519
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:39,360
so the sun is really coming through here

520
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:40,400
like this

521
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:42,480
and

522
00:17:40,400 --> 00:17:44,080
what you want to do again is be able to

523
00:17:42,480 --> 00:17:46,880
walk right through this i can stand in

524
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:48,320
here there's no issue whatsoever so this

525
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:51,919
is kind of what you want to do with

526
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:53,280
these trees is have one planted here

527
00:17:51,919 --> 00:17:55,280
one of these guys even if you're going

528
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:56,559
to do it like this which i again i don't

529
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:58,960
recommend it but if you're going to

530
00:17:56,559 --> 00:18:01,840
plant this many trees in one hole here's

531
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,679
four and there's two of them behind me

532
00:18:01,840 --> 00:18:05,280
this is how you have to do it angle them

533
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:08,480
away from each other

534
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:11,840
pretend as if this is a scaffold this is

535
00:18:08,480 --> 00:18:12,840
a scaffold this is a scaffold and etc

536
00:18:11,840 --> 00:18:15,280
on one

537
00:18:12,840 --> 00:18:17,520
tree and you know what these are now a

538
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:19,600
part of that whole system as well so

539
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:22,480
instead of thinking of this

540
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:24,880
as four different trees this is now one

541
00:18:22,480 --> 00:18:27,120
tree with all these different arms

542
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,400
coming out again keeping the center

543
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,400
clear

544
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:33,280
and open that's the only way you're

545
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:34,720
going to get good disease pressure

546
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:36,400
good air flow

547
00:18:34,720 --> 00:18:38,720
you know good fruit quality with the

548
00:18:36,400 --> 00:18:41,440
sunlight coming in here getting as much

549
00:18:38,720 --> 00:18:43,520
photosynthesis as possible

550
00:18:41,440 --> 00:18:46,960
and that's it i made some big cuts right

551
00:18:43,520 --> 00:18:46,960
here in the center i'll show you guys

552
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:50,160
and this is the key

553
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:54,480
really has become the biggest

554
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,039
um thing that i've done with the pruning

555
00:18:57,280 --> 00:19:00,880
this year and i think it's absolutely

556
00:18:59,039 --> 00:19:01,919
critical i would not be showing you guys

557
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,840
this

558
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:05,360
if it wasn't but look here's a big cut

559
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,760
here in the center

560
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:09,679
another cut right here in the center

561
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:11,760
even these branches here in the center

562
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,760
i've even topped them off and made sure

563
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,679
that the growth is growing outwards

564
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:19,200
again all that's growing outwards

565
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:21,200
and then the same thing

566
00:19:19,200 --> 00:19:22,080
behind me look this is a big cut in the

567
00:19:21,200 --> 00:19:23,840
middle

568
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:25,440
this was the biggest and most

569
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,200
problematic

570
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:29,840
branch of the entire system because this

571
00:19:27,200 --> 00:19:30,799
was a giant scaffold that was way in the

572
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:33,039
center

573
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,080
taking up all the space all this real

574
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,080
estate

575
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:39,200
same thing with this one and this one

576
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,720
and that's really all i've done

577
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,640
is i've come in here

578
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:44,400
pruned out the middle

579
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:46,080
this planting makes a lot more sense

580
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:48,160
it's going to get a lot more light the

581
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,000
fruit quality is going to be better

582
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:51,120
but again i got to keep i got to stay on

583
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,280
top of this

584
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,720
because if i don't stay on top of it in

585
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:56,320
the summer it doesn't matter it's going

586
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:58,400
to continue to grow it's going to

587
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:00,080
continue to do its thing

588
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
and those branches are going to fill up

589
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:03,840
the middle there's

590
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:06,559
prime real estate for the sun

591
00:20:03,840 --> 00:20:08,240
in the middle of the trees

592
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:10,000
so the tree is naturally going to think

593
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:12,159
oh i got to fill up that middle space i

594
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:13,840
got to take advantage of that

595
00:20:12,159 --> 00:20:15,440
but you don't want that you got to prune

596
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:17,440
out that that middle stuff there and

597
00:20:15,440 --> 00:20:18,559
keep up with it throughout the summer

598
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:19,679
that's how you're going to get the best

599
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:20,720
air flow

600
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,880
that's how you're going to get the best

601
00:20:20,720 --> 00:20:25,200
fruit quality so rather than showing you

602
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
guys

603
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,840
you know my actual cuts my actual

604
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:31,679
pruning i thought this was a lot better

605
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:33,280
to come in here and actually show you

606
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:34,720
guys how i've actually pruned these

607
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:37,039
trees

608
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:37,840
the pears are a little bit different

609
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:39,520
but

610
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,440
you're trying to get that pyramid shape

611
00:20:39,520 --> 00:20:43,919
actually with those

612
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:43,919
but even

613
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,480
you know this is just good principles

614
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,240
every tree is a little bit different but

615
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,320
you're starting out young in a very

616
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,679
similar fashion getting that lower

617
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:55,440
branching

618
00:20:53,679 --> 00:20:56,960
getting an open center in most

619
00:20:55,440 --> 00:20:58,559
situations

620
00:20:56,960 --> 00:21:00,480
trying to think about light when it

621
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:03,120
comes to actually pruning

622
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,960
your trees and making those cuts

623
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:06,640
thinking about airflow because

624
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:09,360
everything we do

625
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:12,480
is in an effort to promote fruit quality

626
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:16,320
you could have you know 100 500 1 000

627
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:17,760
peaches a thousand fruits whatever it is

628
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,600
if they're not of a good quality you're

629
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:20,720
not going to enjoy them

630
00:21:19,600 --> 00:21:22,080
you're going to be actually pretty

631
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,080
creeped out you're going to be pretty

632
00:21:22,080 --> 00:21:25,440
down on yourself because your tree is

633
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,320
just diseased

634
00:21:25,440 --> 00:21:30,400
the fruits are diseased

635
00:21:28,320 --> 00:21:31,840
all this hard work and all this effort

636
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,280
is just finally

637
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:34,240
coming to a point where it's actually a

638
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,000
problem

639
00:21:34,240 --> 00:21:37,600
you know as the trees get older you're

640
00:21:36,000 --> 00:21:40,400
going to realize this as the trees get

641
00:21:37,600 --> 00:21:42,400
bigger as the trees grow more quickly

642
00:21:40,400 --> 00:21:44,159
this especially in humid places you're

643
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:45,919
going to realize

644
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:47,600
that's what i have to do

645
00:21:45,919 --> 00:21:50,559
it's gonna probably hit you then now i

646
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:51,360
hope it hope this got through to you now

647
00:21:50,559 --> 00:21:53,280
but

648
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:54,799
we need to focus on this

649
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:56,640
first and foremost

650
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:58,799
in the beginning and it's so hard to

651
00:21:56,640 --> 00:22:00,720
realize that so don't be down on

652
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,880
yourself but

653
00:22:00,720 --> 00:22:04,559
there's my advice guys thank you so much

654
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,400
for watching take care hit that

655
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,000
subscribe button you got this far and

656
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:09,360
share this with your friends somebody uh

657
00:22:08,000 --> 00:22:10,400
you know that's just now getting into

658
00:22:09,360 --> 00:22:12,880
fruit trees

659
00:22:10,400 --> 00:22:14,799
i'm sure this is a good video for them

660
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:17,200
to kind of understand what is it that i

661
00:22:14,799 --> 00:22:18,960
should at least be doing

662
00:22:17,200 --> 00:22:21,280
all right we'll see you guys later take

663
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:21,280
care
