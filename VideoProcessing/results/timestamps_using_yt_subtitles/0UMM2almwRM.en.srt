1
00:00:02,659 --> 00:00:07,919
if you own land more than likely you've

2
00:00:05,549 --> 00:00:10,230
got weeds and so it's a responsibility

3
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:12,450
of land owners to control noxious weeds

4
00:00:10,230 --> 00:00:15,330
as well as other weeds that might affect

5
00:00:12,450 --> 00:00:17,609
your cropping economics when you're

6
00:00:15,330 --> 00:00:19,949
storing chemicals it is to be behind

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,250
locked doors and you're also asked to

8
00:00:19,949 --> 00:00:24,960
put a Signia or a sign up that indicates

9
00:00:23,250 --> 00:00:28,019
the pesticides are behind that locked

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:31,769
door this avoids anybody from getting in

11
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:33,750
and maybe taking it or kids getting in

12
00:00:31,769 --> 00:00:36,870
close contact with it that type of thing

13
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:39,360
so also we're doing chemical pickup and

14
00:00:36,870 --> 00:00:41,190
as you come to pick up your chemical

15
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,870
make sure that you store it on the back

16
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:48,360
of your vehicle out in the open so you

17
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:50,160
instead of inside of the car I'm also

18
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:52,980
make sure that if you're using flatbed

19
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,969
pickups or trailers that you secure your

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:58,590
load and you do not lose that in

21
00:00:55,969 --> 00:01:01,379
transport another mistake that we've

22
00:00:58,590 --> 00:01:03,629
seen is leaving your chemical unattended

23
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,479
if you're going to go out to your field

24
00:01:03,629 --> 00:01:09,270
and make an application many of people

25
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:11,430
have basically chemical trucks that they

26
00:01:09,270 --> 00:01:14,430
store them in and they leave them

27
00:01:11,430 --> 00:01:16,799
unattended for long periods of time and

28
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:19,229
there's been mishaps of chemical getting

29
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,549
stolen or if you really don't have

30
00:01:19,229 --> 00:01:22,560
neighbors that like you there's been

31
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:25,500
cases of people putting chemical in your

32
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,119
spray tank kind of as a bad prank it's

33
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:29,549
your responsibility to keep that

34
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,159
chemical under lock and key and under

35
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,130
your control at all times another one to

36
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,049
keep in mind is that always store the

37
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:39,210
chemical in its original containers and

38
00:01:37,049 --> 00:01:41,909
you want those container labels to be

39
00:01:39,210 --> 00:01:45,049
facing outwards so everybody knows where

40
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,729
what chemical that they are exposed to

41
00:01:45,049 --> 00:01:49,740
also when you're handling chemicals or

42
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:53,009
transporting chemicals make sure that

43
00:01:49,740 --> 00:01:55,170
you do have the proper safety equipment

44
00:01:53,009 --> 00:01:56,250
in the event that there's a spill you

45
00:01:55,170 --> 00:02:00,689
want to make sure that you've got some

46
00:01:56,250 --> 00:02:03,390
cat litter or some some some chemical to

47
00:02:00,689 --> 00:02:05,219
kind of absorb the the spill and then if

48
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:07,079
it is significant enough that you report

49
00:02:05,219 --> 00:02:11,220
that to the poison control center and

50
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:12,160
assist with control to attempts to clean

51
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:14,350
that that mess

52
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:17,170
again we hope that everybody has a safe

53
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:18,940
spring season and you have questions

54
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,440
