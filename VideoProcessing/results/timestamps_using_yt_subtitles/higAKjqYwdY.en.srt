1
00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,120
yeah thanks for the introduction and uh

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,279
thanks to the organizers for inviting me

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,800
it's really pleasure to be speaking here

4
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:11,040
today

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:13,759
um yeah i'll be talking about the hidden

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,200
forces underground soil biodiversity for

7
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:17,840
agricultural production and

8
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:20,640
environmental integrity

9
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:23,920
so i think we all know that there's

10
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:25,680
organisms living in the soil and

11
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:27,920
it's actually a huge variety of

12
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,400
creatures living there and they're all

13
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:32,960
doing things so they are

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:35,680
eating organic matter they're feeding on

15
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:37,520
plant material they're feeding on each

16
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,399
other and

17
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:40,399
they

18
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:42,399
bury through the soil they poop in the

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,840
soil they eat each other's poop so

20
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,360
there's this whole complexity of

21
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,600
things happening

22
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:54,079
and together these actions um result in

23
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:55,520
certain ecosystem functions

24
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,440
um

25
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,079
and these ecosystem functions can result

26
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,879
in ecosystem services that we as humans

27
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,360
also depend on so um

28
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:08,479
soil organisms are important for organic

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:10,159
meta decom composition for example

30
00:01:08,479 --> 00:01:12,799
they can improve soil structure and

31
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:16,240
water infiltration they can store

32
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:17,920
nutrients release nutrients

33
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,840
improve plant nutrition

34
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,520
provide pest control

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:23,920
and so on

36
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,439
however it's been increasingly

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,479
increasingly shown in recent years that

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:32,159
with increasing land use intensification

39
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:35,200
a lot of these organisms are actually

40
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:39,680
negatively affected so they get reduced

41
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:42,320
in their diversity and abundance

42
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,479
and can even go locally extinct in

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,479
certain fields

44
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:48,880
and now the big question is

45
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
if we lose these organisms do we also

46
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,479
lose these important functions that we

47
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,600
depend on

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,399
or if we phrase it more positively

49
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,640
if we promote organisms and find ways to

50
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,479
promote these organisms in soil can we

51
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,280
actually improve our ecosystem

52
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:07,119
functioning and get more sustainable

53
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,360
cropping systems

54
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,360
so to put this in a theoretical

55
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,720
framework

56
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:14,480
when we

57
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:16,560
look at

58
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,280
a natural ecosystem

59
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,360
we we have usually relatively high plant

60
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,200
diversity we have a rich

61
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,280
and diverse soil life

62
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:28,080
and we have very efficient internal

63
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,140
resource recycling processes that keep

64
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,560
this system

65
00:02:29,140 --> 00:02:33,280
[Music]

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:35,519
alive over long time spans so it's a

67
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:38,879
very sustainable system but it's not

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:41,200
very productive in agricultural terms

69
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,040
when we compare this to an intensive

70
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,720
agricultural system

71
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:45,519
we often have

72
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,400
a

73
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,720
huge amount of external resource inputs

74
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,120
you have crop monocultures

75
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,440
and soil life is not doing so well so we

76
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:58,000
have less well developed internal

77
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,360
resource recycling processes and we also

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,239
have much more

79
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,120
losses of nutrients for example

80
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,879
to the groundwater or as gases emissions

81
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:08,800
into the atmosphere

82
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,879
so these systems are very productive but

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,120
they are not sustainable

84
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:15,519
so ideally we want to combine aspects of

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,560
both to create a sustainable system

86
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,239
where we have

87
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:21,519
less external inputs required we have an

88
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,519
intermediate

89
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:26,239
diversity on the field and we have a

90
00:03:23,519 --> 00:03:28,159
rich and abundant soil life so we have

91
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,560
very well developed resource recycling

92
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,959
processes and little losses to the

93
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,239
environment so we have a productive and

94
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:35,519
sustainable

95
00:03:34,239 --> 00:03:37,280
system

96
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,959
but first of all

97
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,560
we we have to answer the question how

98
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:43,280
important are the soil organisms

99
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,640
actually for ecosystem functioning

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,120
and

101
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,400
to find that out i

102
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,200
performed

103
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,560
an experiment a couple years back in

104
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:57,439
so-called lysometers so lysometers are

105
00:03:54,560 --> 00:04:00,400
basically big pots um

106
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,480
placed in the outside in free air

107
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:05,280
and each lysometer can hold the sole

108
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:07,040
volume of 230 liters

109
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,319
um we filled these lysometers with

110
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,560
sterilized soil and then added two

111
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:14,720
different soil biological treatments one

112
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,560
we call the enhanced soil life treatment

113
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:17,919
containing soil organisms smaller four

114
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:19,759
millimeters

115
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,519
and the other one was the reduced soil

116
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,759
life treatment that only contained

117
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,880
organisms smaller 11 micrometers so

118
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:28,560
basically

119
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:28,560
microorganisms but nothing else

120
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:32,479
these lysometers have a hole in the

121
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,160
bottom where the

122
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,160
water running through the soil profile

123
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,600
can be collected and later analyzed for

124
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,840
nutrients

125
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:43,040
and we also performed gas measurements

126
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,720
of nitrous oxide and n2 gas

127
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,120
into the air

128
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,720
to look at nutrient losses

129
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,400
so we planted the mace crop in these

130
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:54,960
lysometers and let them grow to maturity

131
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:57,440
so they got big mace plants as you would

132
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,440
find it in the field

133
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:02,560
and when we look at the data so we see

134
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:04,880
these dark bars the enhanced soil life

135
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,680
treatment and the light gray bars is the

136
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:10,080
reduced cell life treatment

137
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:12,000
what we found was that with reduced soil

138
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,639
life crop yields

139
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,800
when we're significantly lower and we

140
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:19,520
found a similar pattern for nitrogen

141
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,280
uptake and for phosphorus uptake the

142
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:24,880
effects were

143
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,120
strongest so actually it was more than

144
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,560
half the phosphorus uptake with reduced

145
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:30,240
soil life

146
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,720
looking at the nutrient losses we found

147
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:35,199
the opposite pattern so

148
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,520
with reduced soil life

149
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,639
nitrogen leaching losses

150
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,800
went up massively and the same was the

151
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:45,039
case for nitrous oxide emissions and

152
00:05:42,800 --> 00:05:47,120
important greenhouse gas

153
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,880
and also n2 another

154
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,840
gas being emitted

155
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,560
was massively

156
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:56,479
increased so this study shows that soil

157
00:05:54,560 --> 00:05:58,160
organisms have a great potential to

158
00:05:56,479 --> 00:06:00,319
enhance the nutrient use efficiency and

159
00:05:58,160 --> 00:06:02,319
support crop growth

160
00:06:00,319 --> 00:06:03,199
in cropping systems

161
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,400
but

162
00:06:03,199 --> 00:06:05,759
it is

163
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,360
a model system

164
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,759
and actually most knowledge we have

165
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:12,240
about soil biodiversity and how it

166
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:14,720
affects ecosystem functions is derived

167
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,880
from such model systems that often use

168
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,240
sterilized soil so we have to re-add

169
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:19,680
organisms

170
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:22,400
and

171
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:24,800
yeah we actually do not know how well

172
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:27,199
these results transfer to

173
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:29,120
um the real world to an agricultural

174
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:32,080
field

175
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:34,479
so i was trying to get um yeah closer to

176
00:06:32,080 --> 00:06:38,160
that and get some some

177
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:41,680
some answers in real world settings i

178
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,639
did a postdoc in california at uc davis

179
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
and

180
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:49,440
there went to 30 different field sites

181
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:51,599
differing in management intensity so i

182
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,639
selected 10 grassland sites

183
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:56,479
and 10 more sustainable tomato rotations

184
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:58,479
that received cover crops over the

185
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:00,720
winter and

186
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,560
compost applications and then 10

187
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:04,400
intensive tomato rotations that only

188
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,960
receive mineral fertilizers and

189
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:09,360
synthetic pesticides and so on

190
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:12,080
so i expected

191
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,759
reduced abundance and diversity of soil

192
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:15,360
organisms with increasing management

193
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,759
intensity

194
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:19,440
so i went to all these sites and we

195
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:22,080
sampled and analyzed the soil

196
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,000
communities and we also extracted soil

197
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,759
cores from all these fields

198
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,050
placed them in a greenhouse planted

199
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:29,680
tomato crops there and

200
00:07:28,050 --> 00:07:31,680
[Music]

201
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:34,240
yeah measured nutrient leaching losses

202
00:07:31,680 --> 00:07:36,240
and gas emissions and looked at

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,919
crop yield also

204
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:39,199
so when we look at the data for the soil

205
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,720
communities

206
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,440
you always see the grasslands on the

207
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:45,039
left and the intensive systems on the

208
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,440
right so

209
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:50,560
we found that with increasing management

210
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,720
intensity indeed most parameters for

211
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,360
solar organisms showed a negative trend

212
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:57,199
the more intensive the system was the

213
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,840
less diverse and less abundant soil

214
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,720
organisms there

215
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:03,680
then

216
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,080
we related this data to some ecosystem

217
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:09,039
functions that we measured so here we

218
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:11,840
see the relationship on the left

219
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:14,160
with microbial biomass in the soil and

220
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,319
tomato yield we found a significantly

221
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,639
positive relationship so with more

222
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:19,680
microbial biomass we had higher tomato

223
00:08:18,639 --> 00:08:22,080
yields

224
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:24,400
similarly we found for the more

225
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:27,280
nematodes we had in the soil we also

226
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:29,520
found higher crop yields looking at

227
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:31,840
nutrient leaching losses we found some

228
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,959
relationship with the ratio of fungi to

229
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:36,399
bacteria in the soil so the higher this

230
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,120
ratio was

231
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:40,880
the lower the nitrogen leaching losses

232
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,880
there which is something that has also

233
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,760
been shown before and hypothesized that

234
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:49,760
a fungi dominated system has a more

235
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:53,200
close sustainable nutrient cycling

236
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:55,440
compared to a bacteria-dominated system

237
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,000
so um yeah taken together this study

238
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:01,920
could partly confirm what we found in a

239
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:01,920
model system which was very nice

240
00:09:02,640 --> 00:09:05,600
and then

241
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:08,399
i performed a different study focusing

242
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:11,120
on a vascular mycorrhizal fungi or short

243
00:09:08,399 --> 00:09:14,560
amf we heard about mycorrhizal fungi

244
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:17,120
before savarina was managed

245
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:19,120
mentioning them and

246
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,680
yeah

247
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:24,240
these fungi form symbiotic relationships

248
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:26,959
with the majority of land plants and

249
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:28,000
including many major crops like may

250
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:32,080
sweet

251
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:34,160
potato tomato and so on and they are

252
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:36,240
mostly known for improving plant growth

253
00:09:34,160 --> 00:09:40,240
and nutrition and there are also other

254
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:42,880
benefits that have been shown to be

255
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:45,200
provided by amf so the way this

256
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,440
symbiosis works

257
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:48,640
you see here microscopy picture of a

258
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:51,920
plant root

259
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:54,560
and the blue structures is the amf

260
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:58,160
structure and actually enter the plant

261
00:09:54,560 --> 00:10:00,800
root even the plant root cells and

262
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:03,279
develop there then they spread a network

263
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:05,200
of fungal hyphae

264
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:07,360
into the soil so here we see the plant

265
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:10,560
fruit and then we see these fine root

266
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:13,120
structures spreading out in the soil so

267
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:14,720
basically they extend the root system

268
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,480
and you see that they are much finer

269
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:19,279
than the plant roots so they can enter

270
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:20,959
soil pores that the plant cannot access

271
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,480
and then they take up nutrients from the

272
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:26,000
soil and

273
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:28,959
give them to the plant the plant in turn

274
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:31,200
performs photosynthesis and gives carbon

275
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:34,079
back to the fungus so both partners

276
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:36,560
benefit from this association

277
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:39,200
so i i did a postdoc then

278
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:41,680
at uc berkeley and there we

279
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:43,920
looked at this mycorrhizal fungi in

280
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,480
a long-term field trial

281
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:49,120
the century experiment at russell ranch

282
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:52,079
in davis where since more than 25 years

283
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:54,240
different cropping systems are compared

284
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:56,880
and we were interested in the

285
00:10:54,240 --> 00:11:00,160
communities of microwaval fungi in these

286
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:03,279
systems and how they affect crop yield

287
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:04,640
so we selected four management systems

288
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:07,440
there

289
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:10,240
and we planted two different

290
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:14,079
tomato plants in these systems so one is

291
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:15,680
a normal tomato plant called 76r

292
00:11:14,079 --> 00:11:18,240
that forms regular

293
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,800
associations with mycorrhizal fungi

294
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,720
and then we had this tomato mutant

295
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,279
called rmc

296
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,760
that has a mutation that

297
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:29,839
prevents it from forming normal amf

298
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:33,920
association so they only form

299
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:36,079
yeah very reduced associations with amf

300
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:37,920
so we planted them there and then we

301
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,360
looked at tomato yields to basically

302
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:40,640
find out

303
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:43,440
um

304
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:45,920
yeah how yield is affected if we remove

305
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,000
the mycorrhizal association

306
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:49,279
from the crop

307
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,680
and

308
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,720
we see here the data for the biomass on

309
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,720
the left hand side under the crop yield

310
00:11:54,720 --> 00:11:59,200
dark bars are the normal tomato plants

311
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:01,920
and the light gray bars are the

312
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,240
mutant plants with reduced mycorrhizal

313
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:06,880
colonization and we see some differences

314
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:09,680
here depending on the cropping system

315
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:12,480
but importantly we see that

316
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:13,920
when we remove mycorrhital associations

317
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:17,120
from the system we

318
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:19,200
get up to a 30 percent

319
00:12:17,120 --> 00:12:21,360
decline in yields

320
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:23,120
and also overall we found a positive

321
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,040
correlation the more mycorrhizae we

322
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:26,480
found in the plant roots the higher

323
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,600
tomato yields

324
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,519
where

325
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:32,959
so i think this study also impressively

326
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:35,360
shows that that soil organisms can

327
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:36,839
really or really do support agricultural

328
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:38,720
yields and

329
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,880
matter

330
00:12:38,720 --> 00:12:43,120
so to sum up these

331
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,079
studies we saw that sole organisms

332
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:45,760
possess

333
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,079
the great potential to increase crop

334
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,639
yields and simultaneously reduce

335
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:53,600
nutrient pollution to the environment

336
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:56,399
and we could confirm um

337
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:57,440
these results in field settings

338
00:12:56,399 --> 00:12:59,040
so

339
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:01,040
soil life is a crucial factor for

340
00:12:59,040 --> 00:13:04,160
sustainable agriculture and

341
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:05,839
substantially supports crop yields and

342
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:07,839
supporting your soil life is good for

343
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,839
the environment good for the plants and

344
00:13:07,839 --> 00:13:11,760
good for you if you're a farmer so you

345
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:15,279
have more money in your pocket

346
00:13:11,760 --> 00:13:18,320
and need less fertilizer for example

347
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:20,880
so this is all very nice but

348
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:22,880
we have to get this information

349
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:24,720
out to the public

350
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:28,959
and we don't have much time because

351
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:32,240
soils are threatened so we lose soils

352
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,920
globally at an alarming rate um and

353
00:13:32,240 --> 00:13:36,399
there's like problems like soil

354
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:39,839
compaction so salinization

355
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,120
desertification and soil erosion through

356
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,519
wind and

357
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,199
water and also soil sealing through

358
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,920
human activities

359
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:49,760
that are major problems and also harm

360
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:50,720
soil life

361
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,040
and

362
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,519
most people or the general public is

363
00:13:53,040 --> 00:13:57,440
maybe not really aware that soils harbor

364
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:58,959
an entire below ground universe so

365
00:13:57,440 --> 00:14:01,760
actually

366
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:04,160
one quarter of the global biodiversity

367
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:06,240
is found in soils and one teaspoon of

368
00:14:04,160 --> 00:14:09,680
soil contains more living organisms than

369
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:09,680
we are humans on this planet

370
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,639
so there we got this idea we have to do

371
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:16,639
something to spread

372
00:14:14,639 --> 00:14:18,000
the word about

373
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,320
these facts

374
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:22,800
and this is where the underpants come

375
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:25,920
into play

376
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:27,760
so we trying to make the soil life

377
00:14:25,920 --> 00:14:29,680
visible because it's very hard to see

378
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:31,839
soil organisms we saw the presentation

379
00:14:29,680 --> 00:14:31,839
before

380
00:14:32,320 --> 00:14:36,560
so you need a microscope and then also

381
00:14:34,240 --> 00:14:38,959
you you yeah it's hard to see them but

382
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:40,000
we try to make soil life visible by

383
00:14:38,959 --> 00:14:43,040
making

384
00:14:40,000 --> 00:14:46,480
underpants invisible because if you bury

385
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:48,800
an underpant in the soil it's cotton

386
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:52,240
it will be decomposed by solar organisms

387
00:14:48,800 --> 00:14:55,519
and over time disappears

388
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:58,160
so we started um a citizen science

389
00:14:55,519 --> 00:15:00,880
project called bavais gunderhose in

390
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:02,160
english it's a proof by underpants

391
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:04,959
where we

392
00:15:02,160 --> 00:15:08,079
wanted to bury underpants together with

393
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:08,079
the swiss population

394
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:12,160
with the goal to raise the awareness

395
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,880
about the importance of soils and also

396
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:17,040
to perform some scientific assessments

397
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,360
of soil biological activity and soil

398
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:21,440
health across switzerland and also we

399
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,440
want to develop recommendations for best

400
00:15:21,440 --> 00:15:24,720
management practices to support soil

401
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:26,639
life

402
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
and i have to mention that we did not

403
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:30,800
invent this idea of burying underpants

404
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:34,480
so this was actually a group of farmers

405
00:15:30,800 --> 00:15:35,519
in canada that started with this in 2015

406
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,279
and

407
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:38,720
it has already been done in several

408
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,880
parts of the world currently there's

409
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:43,360
also project in hungary going on in

410
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:45,440
australia

411
00:15:43,360 --> 00:15:46,240
yeah

412
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,040
um

413
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,240
so

414
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:54,720
how did we do it we put together a soil

415
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:56,639
lab kit diy soil lab kit so we provided

416
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:58,160
standardized underpants to all the

417
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,120
participants

418
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:03,920
we also included tea bags to look at the

419
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:05,759
teabag index which is a scientifically

420
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,839
more established method to look at

421
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,839
decomposition processes in soil

422
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:13,519
and so we

423
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:15,600
put these things in the package and

424
00:16:13,519 --> 00:16:18,079
shipped it to all participants and then

425
00:16:15,600 --> 00:16:20,560
they got instructions on how to bury the

426
00:16:18,079 --> 00:16:23,199
underpants then they take a soil sample

427
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:26,560
which they ship back to our labs

428
00:16:23,199 --> 00:16:27,680
and they place the tea bags in the soil

429
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:29,600
and

430
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:31,759
each participant received two underpants

431
00:16:29,600 --> 00:16:34,079
so one will be

432
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,759
retrieved after one month the other one

433
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,040
after two months

434
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:39,199
then we also

435
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:43,199
together with this partner spotterron

436
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:45,759
we've developed an app where people can

437
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:47,120
enter management data and information

438
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:48,399
about the field where they buried the

439
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:51,279
underpants

440
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:53,920
and can also upload pictures

441
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,320
of the underpants

442
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,600
and then they ship after the two months

443
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,720
they ship the soil sample and the

444
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:03,440
underpants back to us to microscope and

445
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:05,199
we analyze them

446
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:07,280
so we um

447
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:09,439
aimed for 1000 participants and actually

448
00:17:07,280 --> 00:17:11,360
all the available spots filled up before

449
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:14,000
we officially announced the project so

450
00:17:11,360 --> 00:17:15,120
there was really a huge interest

451
00:17:14,000 --> 00:17:19,600
um

452
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:22,640
and we aimed for 50 farmers and 50

453
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,919
non-farmers being private gardeners or

454
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:25,439
just

455
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:27,679
regular people

456
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:29,840
um we we told them they can bury the

457
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,000
underpants wherever they want can be in

458
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:34,559
the forest can be in some reuteral

459
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,720
spaces in the city can be in their

460
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,960
community garden in the rooftop garden

461
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:41,440
or in agricultural fields

462
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:44,480
and here you see a map from our webpage

463
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:45,280
and everyone in each of these dots

464
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:47,120
actually

465
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:49,600
represents several

466
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:52,320
spots where underpants are buried so you

467
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:55,039
can zoom in and see all the details

468
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:57,760
and look at pictures and look at site

469
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:59,760
information on our web page which is

470
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:02,480
available in three swiss national

471
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:02,480
languages

472
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:09,039
yeah then we had the goal to raise the

473
00:18:06,240 --> 00:18:11,360
awareness and we had an event for the

474
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:13,679
media for the start of the project and

475
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:16,480
actually it was overwhelming how well

476
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:19,280
this was picked up so we were

477
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,720
in the media globally with this project

478
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:25,039
um

479
00:18:20,720 --> 00:18:26,559
in in ghana in india china the u.s

480
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,080
and so on

481
00:18:26,559 --> 00:18:34,000
and um we also had several television

482
00:18:30,080 --> 00:18:35,440
features in swiss and german television

483
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:38,160
and um

484
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:40,640
importantly all these media releases

485
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,480
talked about that soils are alive soils

486
00:18:40,640 --> 00:18:43,919
are important and souls are threatened

487
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:45,919
and we have to take care of them so they

488
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:48,720
really got our message across which made

489
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:50,160
us very happy

490
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:52,559
um we also

491
00:18:50,160 --> 00:18:56,000
put together a picture book about soil

492
00:18:52,559 --> 00:18:58,799
life called the jungle on soil but it's

493
00:18:56,000 --> 00:19:00,720
only available in german and french

494
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:03,600
if we think about releasing an english

495
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:06,000
version we'll see how that goes

496
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:08,240
um yeah it's actually very entertaining

497
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:09,679
and interesting can learn a lot there

498
00:19:08,240 --> 00:19:11,440
and it's available in bookstores in

499
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,919
switzerland germany austria or you can

500
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:15,360
also directly order it through us you

501
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:16,880
can write me an email then you get also

502
00:19:15,360 --> 00:19:19,039
a special prize when you get it through

503
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:19,039
us

504
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:24,240
yeah and then there's still the

505
00:19:21,520 --> 00:19:25,679
scientific assessments to be made so the

506
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:27,679
research questions we're trying to

507
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:29,919
answer with this project

508
00:19:27,679 --> 00:19:32,720
are um how sole biological activity

509
00:19:29,919 --> 00:19:35,120
distributed across switzerland and is

510
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,960
this biological activity linked to soil

511
00:19:35,120 --> 00:19:39,600
biodiversity

512
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:42,559
soil quality crop yields and also how

513
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,720
does management affect

514
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:46,799
the soil biological activity

515
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,120
and um

516
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,120
yeah we also want to assess whether

517
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:53,200
underpants can really serve as a

518
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:56,160
meaningful and easy to use indicator for

519
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:58,400
soil health that everyone can use in

520
00:19:56,160 --> 00:20:00,160
their backyard or wherever they

521
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:01,440
want because this method has never been

522
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:04,000
scientifically

523
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:05,679
assessed so um yeah we really hope to

524
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:07,440
get answers here how useful the

525
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:09,520
underpants actually are

526
00:20:07,440 --> 00:20:11,919
so right now we're dealing with the

527
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:15,280
samples we have almost 900 soil samples

528
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,880
1 600 underpants 10 000 tea bags

529
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:19,760
we have a subset of soil samples where

530
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:21,520
we look at soil microbial diversity 800

531
00:20:19,760 --> 00:20:23,200
questionnaires with site information

532
00:20:21,520 --> 00:20:25,840
management data

533
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:27,679
so we are really busy in the lab right

534
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,679
now so the underpants they are

535
00:20:27,679 --> 00:20:31,760
photographed and then with imaging

536
00:20:29,679 --> 00:20:33,760
software we determine the

537
00:20:31,760 --> 00:20:35,600
amount of degradation of the underpants

538
00:20:33,760 --> 00:20:37,520
the tea bags are weighed

539
00:20:35,600 --> 00:20:39,679
and yeah we hope to be able to make

540
00:20:37,520 --> 00:20:44,000
recommendations for for best management

541
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:44,000
practices in spring of this year

542
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:49,039
what we can tell already or what we have

543
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,120
already is data that the citizens

544
00:20:49,039 --> 00:20:52,480
actually entered in the app so they

545
00:20:51,120 --> 00:20:55,200
could

546
00:20:52,480 --> 00:20:57,280
assess how strongly the underpants were

547
00:20:55,200 --> 00:20:59,200
degraded

548
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:01,360
so we see here the results of the one

549
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,840
month so orange means the underpants are

550
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:05,919
not very degraded green men means

551
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,480
they're strongly degraded

552
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,159
so what we see so far after one month

553
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:11,760
months there's less degradation than

554
00:21:10,159 --> 00:21:14,159
after two months

555
00:21:11,760 --> 00:21:17,200
and we see that there are no

556
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:18,799
large-scale spatial patterns so um

557
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,880
yeah looking at the details will be

558
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:22,799
interesting hopefully so there's more to

559
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,720

interactions group at agroscope and my

569
00:21:43,679 --> 00:21:47,440
colleagues the project team of the

570
00:21:45,840 --> 00:21:50,159
underpants project

571
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:52,400
people at uc davis and berkeley

572
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:55,520
and i thank you for your attention

573
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,760

um for your talk and now

576
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:04,159
we also know what's

577
00:22:02,240 --> 00:22:05,760
how how it was all conducted regarding

578
00:22:04,159 --> 00:22:07,919
the pants and

579
00:22:05,760 --> 00:22:09,679
very um inspiring you want to say yeah

580
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:11,280
maybe i'm start collecting some pants

581
00:22:09,679 --> 00:22:13,520
now from now on

582
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:15,120
it's okay um

583
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:18,240
i will start right away with the

584
00:22:15,120 --> 00:22:21,039
question of felix um he's asking how was

585
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:24,320
the soil soil uh sterilized and how was

586
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,120
uh ensured that it was sterile

587
00:22:24,320 --> 00:22:30,320
um we sterilize the soil with

588
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:32,240
x-ray rear irradiation so there are

589
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:35,919
these companies that provide a service

590
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,919
mostly for medical equipment

591
00:22:36,080 --> 00:22:40,480
and

592
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:43,360
yeah depending on the dose of the

593
00:22:40,480 --> 00:22:45,760
irradiation you can determine how how

594
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,840
sterile the soil is because there is

595
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:48,720
always some bacteria that can survive

596
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:50,159
such

597
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:54,159
processes

598
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,280
um so we made sure that we did not have

599
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:57,760
fungi

600
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:59,200
in the soil anymore no mycorrhizal fungi

601
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:01,760
and

602
00:22:59,200 --> 00:23:03,760
insects arthropods and so on there might

603
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:05,440
have been still some bacteria

604
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:06,400
have been

605
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:10,640
sorry

606
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,640
alive in the soil but um

607
00:23:10,799 --> 00:23:14,400
yeah but we

608
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,360
um

609
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:19,600
also saw in our control treatments that

610
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,159
they were mostly free of mycorrhizae for

611
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:24,159
example we had some contamination

612
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:26,480
probably through the air because it was

613
00:23:24,159 --> 00:23:27,919
outside

614
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:31,840
and for the greenhouse we often

615
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,840
sterilize the soil with autoclaving

616
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:36,799
thank you very much

617
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:38,799
can you please stop sharing this screen

618
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:40,880
yeah sure i mean i love the biodiversity

619
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,840
of the of the pants but

620
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:42,960
thank you

621
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,960
um

622
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:46,000
okay uh the next question will be by

623
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:48,799
laying that

624
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:51,600
um using two domain tomato varieties

625
00:23:48,799 --> 00:23:54,640
introduce more differences than

626
00:23:51,600 --> 00:23:56,559
equals minus amf only so

627
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:59,200
how do you know the yield differences

628
00:23:56,559 --> 00:24:00,559
are amf based

629
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:02,000
so these uh

630
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,000
the

631
00:24:02,000 --> 00:24:06,960
this mutant is actually derived from

632
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,919
this 76-hour wild type that we used so

633
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:10,080
they are

634
00:24:07,919 --> 00:24:11,760
directly related and

635
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,799
it should only be

636
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:16,159
this one mutation that

637
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:17,919
that

638
00:24:16,159 --> 00:24:20,000
causes differences in mycorrhizal

639
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:22,000
colonization and this

640
00:24:20,000 --> 00:24:24,880
pair of wild-type and mutant has been

641
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:27,600
used in in several studies already

642
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,640
there have also been

643
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,200
tests

644
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:34,159
planting them in sterile soil to look at

645
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:36,880
growth differences without mycorrhizae

646
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:38,320
and they show fairly similar

647
00:24:36,880 --> 00:24:41,279
similar growth

648
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:42,320
even in sterile soil

649
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:46,240
thank you

650
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:48,400
the next question by italia is

651
00:24:46,240 --> 00:24:49,279
how deep have you buried their panties

652
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:50,799
and

653
00:24:49,279 --> 00:24:52,640
how do you account for the differences

654
00:24:50,799 --> 00:24:54,799
in land use because there is a huge

655
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:57,360
difference in arable land and a heavily

656
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:58,840
irrigated home garden

657
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,720
yeah that's

658
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:02,799
um so

659
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:05,679
first first part of the question we

660
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:09,520
buried the underpants vertically in the

661
00:25:05,679 --> 00:25:12,960
soil so that the the seam on the top

662
00:25:09,520 --> 00:25:12,960
looks out of the soil surface

663
00:25:13,120 --> 00:25:18,000
so it was yeah probably from 0 to 15 20

664
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,240
centimeters

665
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,520
they were buried in the soil

666
00:25:20,240 --> 00:25:24,320
um

667
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:27,600
and yeah of course there's a huge

668
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:30,480
variation and that's why we also tried

669
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,360
with this app and questionnaires to get

670
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:33,600
as

671
00:25:31,360 --> 00:25:35,679
detailed information as possible about

672
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:38,000
what's happening on these field sites is

673
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:40,159
it irrigated or not how often is it

674
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:42,080
irrigated which fertilizers do you use

675
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
do you apply compost do you apply

676
00:25:42,080 --> 00:25:46,080
pesticides

677
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:47,520
which crop is growing there and so on

678
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:49,840
and

679
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:54,000
with all this information we hope to

680
00:25:49,840 --> 00:25:54,000
really get meaningful answers

681
00:25:54,720 --> 00:25:59,120
thank you

682
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,760
and how did you create the treatments

683
00:25:59,120 --> 00:26:02,960
with reduced and enhanced soil life

684
00:26:01,760 --> 00:26:04,880
and

685
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,120
maybe the first part of the other

686
00:26:04,880 --> 00:26:08,960
question of italia

687
00:26:07,120 --> 00:26:12,720
um yeah so we

688
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:14,240
we used um sievings basically so we sift

689
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:16,080
the soil

690
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:18,400
through four millimeters

691
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:21,600
and then we had an additional step in

692
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:24,880
the greenhouse so we put the sift soil

693
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:27,360
into sterile soil in the greenhouse and

694
00:26:24,880 --> 00:26:31,200
planted some plants in there

695
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:34,400
and let them grow for three months to

696
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:37,279
yeah to let the soil organisms propagate

697
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:39,200
in these pots and

698
00:26:37,279 --> 00:26:41,840
yeah and for the for the reduced soil of

699
00:26:39,200 --> 00:26:44,720
treatment we filtered the soil through

700
00:26:41,840 --> 00:26:46,720
11 micrometer filters and also added

701
00:26:44,720 --> 00:26:48,720
this to steroid soil in the greenhouse

702
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:51,279
so we had both treatments growing in the

703
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:53,440
greenhouse in in sterile substrate and

704
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:54,640
only a small part of

705
00:26:53,440 --> 00:26:57,279
of the two

706
00:26:54,640 --> 00:26:58,240
filtrates was added so we tried to

707
00:26:57,279 --> 00:27:00,960
really

708
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:02,880
make sure that that

709
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,840
yeah the difference are similar except

710
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,480
for the different organisms

711
00:27:04,840 --> 00:27:08,320
present

712
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,480
okay and another part of the question

713
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:14,400
was where do you where do the microbes

714
00:27:10,480 --> 00:27:17,360
come from and how much did you apply

715
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:18,170
um so we went to a agricultural field

716
00:27:17,360 --> 00:27:19,840
like a pasture

717
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:22,640
[Music]

718
00:27:19,840 --> 00:27:24,720
here close to our research station

719
00:27:22,640 --> 00:27:27,440
from a farmer and

720
00:27:24,720 --> 00:27:30,320
yeah use just native soil organisms we

721
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:32,840
found in that soil

722
00:27:30,320 --> 00:27:37,520
what was the second part of the

723
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:39,039
question um this i have to i'm already

724
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:41,840
um

725
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:45,120
the second part but one moment

726
00:27:41,840 --> 00:27:46,960
um yeah how much did you apply

727
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:49,120
uh yeah um yeah

728
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:51,919
so we we produced this inoculum in the

729
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:54,320
greenhouse and

730
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:57,440
then i think we

731
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,320
if i remember correctly it was about

732
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:01,600
10

733
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:03,919
of the soil volume in this lysometers

734
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:06,880
was um

735
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:08,720
was the inoculum from the greenhouse

736
00:28:06,880 --> 00:28:10,480
or maybe was five percent or so of the

737
00:28:08,720 --> 00:28:12,880
volume i'm not sure right now i would

738
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:15,600
have to look it up

739
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:17,919
thank you uh a little interruption um i

740
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:20,720
want to remind everybody you don't have

741
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,960
to do it now but all the participants uh

742
00:28:20,720 --> 00:28:25,440
you have to refresh the browser because

743
00:28:22,960 --> 00:28:27,520
otherwise we will drop out

744
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:30,240
by five i mean maybe

745
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,679
there will be maybe we will be finished

746
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:33,760
by five but maybe

747
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,000
it take a little bit longer we

748
00:28:33,760 --> 00:28:38,000
just that it's not like a really quick

749
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:39,200
end so maybe you just refresh the

750
00:28:38,000 --> 00:28:41,279
browser

751
00:28:39,200 --> 00:28:43,200
when you have time within the next uh

752
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,120
five minutes

753
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,799
okay and um

754
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:49,840
i would continue

755
00:28:46,799 --> 00:28:51,760
with the questions michaela she's asking

756
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,840
is intensive cropping always combined

757
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:56,960
with bad soil life

758
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:59,600
or is intensive uh range from overuse

759
00:28:56,960 --> 00:29:01,440
like the degradation soils from us to

760
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:04,640
special use cropping systems with crop

761
00:29:01,440 --> 00:29:04,640
rotation and cover crops

762
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,159
um

763
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:09,760
yeah i

764
00:29:08,159 --> 00:29:12,240
probably there's also intensively

765
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:14,159
managed systems where soil life is doing

766
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:16,399
well i think there's a lot of factors

767
00:29:14,159 --> 00:29:18,960
that play a role and it's always

768
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,720
difficult to make these generalizations

769
00:29:18,960 --> 00:29:23,520
and we also saw on the data that there's

770
00:29:20,720 --> 00:29:25,679
a huge variability

771
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:26,640
in the data so some dropping systems are

772
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,679
doing

773
00:29:26,640 --> 00:29:31,200
better than than others

774
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,600
um

775
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:34,960
and i didn't don't remember the rest of

776
00:29:33,600 --> 00:29:35,760
the question

777
00:29:34,960 --> 00:29:36,960
yeah

778
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:39,919
yeah is it

779
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:41,919
um or is it in intensive range from

780
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:44,799
overuse to special use cropping systems

781
00:29:41,919 --> 00:29:48,320
with crop rotation and cover crops

782
00:29:44,799 --> 00:29:48,320
that's like the second part of the

783
00:29:48,799 --> 00:29:52,120
of the question

784
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
yeah uh so i think probably if i

785
00:29:56,799 --> 00:30:01,840
understand correctly if there's like a

786
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:04,080
gradient of of um

787
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,240
yeah soil

788
00:30:04,080 --> 00:30:09,600
soil health from from more sustainably

789
00:30:06,240 --> 00:30:12,000
to more intensively managed systems um

790
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:13,840
which i would say yes so you you can't

791
00:30:12,000 --> 00:30:15,919
cannot really put them in categories so

792
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,760
this is good this is bad or the soil

793
00:30:15,919 --> 00:30:18,720
life is going bad good here and bad

794
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:20,559
there

795
00:30:18,720 --> 00:30:23,360
so it's it's really

796
00:30:20,559 --> 00:30:25,919
a gradient and it really depends on on

797
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,640
lots of details that we also don't

798
00:30:25,919 --> 00:30:30,080
underst understand at this point i guess

799
00:30:28,640 --> 00:30:31,120
okay thank you

800
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,679
uh

801
00:30:31,120 --> 00:30:36,080
she's asking who paid about sending back

802
00:30:33,679 --> 00:30:39,440
soil samples t-bags and pans

803
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:41,200
participants or your organization

804
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:43,360
yeah actually the

805
00:30:41,200 --> 00:30:45,760
university of zurich was kind enough to

806
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:49,200
sponsor the shipment

807
00:30:45,760 --> 00:30:51,840
so we sent the packages already with a

808
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:53,360
return shipment label they just have to

809
00:30:51,840 --> 00:30:56,320
have to put on the

810
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:58,240
on the box and they could use the same

811
00:30:56,320 --> 00:31:02,240
box so we try to make it really easy for

812
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:02,240
the participants to return the shipments

813
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:08,080
another question by marianne

814
00:31:05,279 --> 00:31:10,640
which results would you think the

815
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:13,360
license trials had shown if also slurry

816
00:31:10,640 --> 00:31:13,360
had been added

817
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,159
um

818
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:21,840
yeah

819
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:24,000
that's a difficult question

820
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:26,399
i don't

821
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:27,200
i don't know i think i i would guess

822
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:29,039
that

823
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,200
in general

824
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:34,000
they they would have probably gone in a

825
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,919
similar direction

826
00:31:34,000 --> 00:31:36,880
but um

827
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:38,000
yeah

828
00:31:36,880 --> 00:31:41,919
yeah

829
00:31:38,000 --> 00:31:41,919
i can't really say a lot about this

830
00:31:42,480 --> 00:31:44,799
okay and then what's the question about

831
00:31:44,000 --> 00:31:47,200
this

832
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:50,399
how the soil was sterilized and how was

833
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:51,519
it ensured that it was sterile

834
00:31:50,399 --> 00:31:53,360
yeah

835
00:31:51,519 --> 00:31:54,960
yeah but i answered this already right

836
00:31:53,360 --> 00:31:57,120
yeah yeah that that's the thing like

837
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:58,799
because it was not um

838
00:31:57,120 --> 00:32:00,399
showed like that it was answered but it

839
00:31:58,799 --> 00:32:02,799
was already

840
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:03,450
answered right yeah

841
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:04,960
so um

842
00:32:03,450 --> 00:32:07,679
[Music]

843
00:32:04,960 --> 00:32:08,960
actually all questions in the chat are

844
00:32:07,679 --> 00:32:09,919
answered now

845
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:12,080
so

846
00:32:09,919 --> 00:32:14,080
um the final question is

847
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:17,200
you know it may be already what are the

848
00:32:14,080 --> 00:32:19,200
two uh main take-home messages or the or

849
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:22,480
one two things you want to share with us

850
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:25,279
before you or we leave the participants

851
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:29,519
by five we try

852
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:33,360
um yeah i think my main message is

853
00:32:29,519 --> 00:32:36,159
make taking care of your soil a priority

854
00:32:33,360 --> 00:32:38,720
it's really the basis of

855
00:32:36,159 --> 00:32:40,799
human existence and then also of the

856
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:45,039
functioning of planet earth so we really

857
00:32:40,799 --> 00:32:47,600
have to take care of the soil and

858
00:32:45,039 --> 00:32:50,159
get away from only focusing on yields

859
00:32:47,600 --> 00:32:52,000
but really focusing on feeding the soil

860
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:52,799
and keeping it healthy and alive so that

861
00:32:52,000 --> 00:32:55,039
we

862
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,840
can rely on them also in 100 years from

863
00:32:55,039 --> 00:32:57,840
now

864
00:32:58,559 --> 00:33:01,919
okay

865
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:05,039
thank you very much wow we are on time

866
00:33:01,919 --> 00:33:05,039
thank you france
