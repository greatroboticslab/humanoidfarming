[Music]

2
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,599
hey y'all let me start by introducing

3
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:13,599
myself my name is Wes white here at tick

4
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,400
Creek Ranch we're social media content

5
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,680
creators and we do all kinds of stuff

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:19,279
here on the acridge we operated on 192

7
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:21,480
acres and as you can see we got some

8
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,320
timber here on our land so roughly 2

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:25,480
years ago started working on a proof of

10
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,199
concept now here we are many months

11
00:00:25,480 --> 00:00:29,000
later and what you see before you is

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,039
what we call the log Hopper I saw it as

13
00:00:29,000 --> 00:00:32,719
an opportunity to hopefully design

14
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,440
something and maybe some would say

15
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:38,040
reinvent the wheel but it's a

16
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:40,239
combination of a skitter SL logging Arch

17
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:42,079
I feel that it really can help fill a

18
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:43,559
knead or a hole that's in the market and

19
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,399
for some of you folks out there now this

20
00:00:43,559 --> 00:00:47,160
is by no means going to replace a

21
00:00:45,399 --> 00:00:48,600
tractor if you want or need a tractor

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,520
I'm not telling you you should even

23
00:00:48,600 --> 00:00:51,960
consider this this is a very specialized

24
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:53,800
piece of equipment for a very

25
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:56,280
specialized application where the

26
00:00:53,800 --> 00:00:59,199
Genesis that this came from is that I'm

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,199
very ecologically and biologically

28
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:03,519
conscious whe whether it be our pastures

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,479
our cattle our horses or the forest

30
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:07,799
floor I Like To Tread really light I

31
00:01:05,479 --> 00:01:09,759
don't like to leave any Trace if I can

32
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:11,439
so that's kind of where this all came

33
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,400
from we're going to go around and show

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:15,640
you the features and functions of this

35
00:01:13,400 --> 00:01:16,680
and I love your feedback all right so

36
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:18,119
we're going to start with the heart of

37
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:20,920
the Beast here what we got here is a

38
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,920
mile marker 5,000 lb winch and it does

39
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:24,159
come with a full spool of wire now we're

40
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:25,799
going to send it out like that to

41
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:27,799
anybody purchases it but I would

42
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:29,720
actually recommend unless you plan on

43
00:01:27,799 --> 00:01:31,200
yarding with this thing and if you do

44
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,960
that hat you're going to probably want

45
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,920
to add an external battery on top of

46
00:01:33,960 --> 00:01:38,040
this unit I wouldn't want to rely on the

47
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,720
small battery that's on your ATV

48
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:41,320
four-wheeler side by side whatever you

49
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,880
got to be running this winch in a

50
00:01:41,320 --> 00:01:45,920
continuous fashion for long pull so this

51
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:48,079
wire here I'll actually probably trim it

52
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,079
down to about 20 ft it'll give us less

53
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:51,960
wraps on the spool it'll make the job of

54
00:01:50,079 --> 00:01:53,479
the winch a lot easier and you won't

55
00:01:51,960 --> 00:01:55,040
have so much problem with biting and

56
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,159
pinching cable it'll be a lot easier to

57
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:58,799
Flat wrap so that being said this is how

58
00:01:57,159 --> 00:02:01,000
it will come it comes with its own

59
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
wiring harness that you would just add

60
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,520
to your side by-side ATV and then you'll

61
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,039
be able to plug it in directly and run

62
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,879
off the battery of the machine that

63
00:02:07,039 --> 00:02:11,800
you're pulling it with here we've got

64
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:14,319
some grade 7516 chain and you can see we

65
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:17,000
got three chain Keepers on either side

66
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,920
the chain keeper is designed for just

67
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:22,720
that okay I do not recommend don't ever

68
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:24,080
ever suspend the load or the log off

69
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,000
these chain Keepers the only reason I

70
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:27,560
say that it's not the Integrity or any

71
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,319
problem here that we would be worried

72
00:02:27,560 --> 00:02:31,360
about it would be this so if someone is

73
00:02:29,319 --> 00:02:33,959
rigging this up puts their hand in here

74
00:02:31,360 --> 00:02:35,519
like this and the load comes loose it

75
00:02:33,959 --> 00:02:37,879
will cut your fingers off this is a

76
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:40,920
terrible pinch point so these are not

77
00:02:37,879 --> 00:02:42,400
for carrying load chain hooks boom

78
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:44,959
that's how you'll suspend your load okay

79
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,720
let's talk about what makes this machine

80
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,159
more unique than pretty much anything on

81
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,239
the market um this is not a new design

82
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,000
and I'm not intending to say this is my

83
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:55,319
own conception this is a very standard

84
00:02:53,000 --> 00:02:56,959
mechanical feature on a lot of trailers

85
00:02:55,319 --> 00:02:58,480
Andor military vehicles throughout the

86
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,400
world I think a lot of you would know

87
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,840
what a walking beam suspension is

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,640
especially considering if you ever been

89
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,480
around a logging truck a Hendrickson

90
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:08,840
suspension or the like so we've just

91
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,760
adapted that to a 3500 lound stub shaft

92
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,640
here these are 5/8 plate this is all

93
00:03:10,760 --> 00:03:15,159
laser cut and these spindles which are

94
00:03:13,640 --> 00:03:17,640
all greaseable mind you these spindles

95
00:03:15,159 --> 00:03:20,319
are rated at 1100 lb the tires are rated

96
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:22,760
1,000 lb so we are giving this machine a

97
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,480
3,000 lb rating I don't recommend going

98
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,879
higher than that but I know how you guys

99
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,640
use your equipment you can see this is

100
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:28,640
pretty

101
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,360
self-explanatory we've got deflectors

102
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,080
and then we also got chain keep Keepers

103
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,080
on the side here now what will we use

104
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:36,599
these for well these are designed to be

105
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,200
able to create a cradle or or run a

106
00:03:36,599 --> 00:03:39,519
chain over the top of your log so if

107
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,879
your log is butt heavy and you're

108
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:42,480
grabbing it from the top of the tree and

109
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:44,000
it naturally wants to lift the front of

110
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:45,400
the log when you pick it with the winch

111
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:47,439
well you can throw a chain over the

112
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:49,439
front and you'll be able to carry a butt

113
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:51,040
heavy log out you'll take obviously

114
00:03:49,439 --> 00:03:52,799
weight off the tow vehicle and you'll

115
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:54,280
have to take that in consideration or we

116
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:56,480
can cradle we can throw the chain

117
00:03:54,280 --> 00:03:59,120
underneath the log and just lift set the

118
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,879
front of the log reset our tongs and

119
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:02,680
lift the back l so now you're probably

120
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,280
wondering what this contraption is well

121
00:04:02,680 --> 00:04:06,319
this is what we call our trolley this

122
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,840
machine is designed to run many

123
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:09,760
different features and functions you

124
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,200
should be able to yard with it lightly

125
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,920
you're going to also have the the

126
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,920
feature of a standard log Arch where

127
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:15,200
you're going to be able to cradle and

128
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:16,880
carry your log out and you're going to

129
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:18,440
be able to take and move Logs with

130
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:20,759
unlimited length you'll be able to move

131
00:04:18,440 --> 00:04:22,000
pecker poles and tree length logs as

132
00:04:20,759 --> 00:04:24,040
long as they're not heavier than the

133
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:27,000
machine can handle by using this Trolley

134
00:04:24,040 --> 00:04:28,120
system so what we got here is a pin it's

135
00:04:27,000 --> 00:04:30,280
got three

136
00:04:28,120 --> 00:04:32,000
positions a different height you can run

137
00:04:30,280 --> 00:04:33,759
it if you want to cradle your log from

138
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,639
the front and hang from there but this

139
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,280
operation is going to allow you to back

140
00:04:35,639 --> 00:04:39,120
over your log connect this hook to the

141
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,360
choker on your log and as you pull

142
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:45,800
forward this is going to run

143
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,039
up stop at the back and then drag your

144
00:04:45,800 --> 00:04:50,639
log out from behind you it works really

145
00:04:48,039 --> 00:04:53,240
great on really long trees again pecker

146
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:56,400
pulls you know light logs I've pulled a

147
00:04:53,240 --> 00:04:59,320
I've Dr around a 40ft log that was about

148
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,520
oh 16 in at the butt 18 in it can do

149
00:04:59,320 --> 00:05:02,880
more uh that's just something I did with

150
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:04,479
it you got to make sure your choker

151
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:06,199
chain is tight enough and you don't have

152
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,800
too much tag in to make sure that the

153
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:09,919
log is high enough so when the machine

154
00:05:07,800 --> 00:05:11,639
articulates and the log comes out at a

155
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,520
obtuse angle it's not interfering with

156
00:05:11,639 --> 00:05:15,320
your tire that is another feature of

157
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:17,720
these really short tires people might

158
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:19,919
ask well why four tires instead of just

159
00:05:17,720 --> 00:05:22,520
two well the walking beam suspension is

160
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,280
a class two lever allows you to Traverse

161
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,199
over obstacles much easier with a heavy

162
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,680
load so as you can see for any of those

163
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:30,720
that don't understand you'll see how the

164
00:05:28,680 --> 00:05:33,039
lifting mechanism works here as I pick

165
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:35,360
up on this tire I will effectively only

166
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,400
be lifting half of the weight of this

167
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,240
unit cuz half will be on there the same

168
00:05:37,400 --> 00:05:41,160
goes for when this crawls over a stump

169
00:05:39,240 --> 00:05:43,680
or

170
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,319
log see how easy that is this unit

171
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:48,280
weighs just under 600 lb and I can

172
00:05:46,319 --> 00:05:50,800
easily lift that so now you can

173
00:05:48,280 --> 00:05:52,479
understand how little upward Force has

174
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:55,160
to be applied to this tire to

175
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:57,560
effectively lift this to allow the tire

176
00:05:55,160 --> 00:05:59,319
to Traverse over set obstacles so on

177
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:01,280
some of our Prototype videos we had some

178
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,120
people say oh great now you got four

179
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:04,800
tires to get flats instead of two and

180
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,479
blah blah blah it increases your chances

181
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,840
of getting a flat in the forest well if

182
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:09,520
you're going to go by that addage you

183
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,199
might as well run a unicycle and get rid

184
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,240
of your car that way you don't have more

185
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,919
tires in the way any rate let's say for

186
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:16,280
instance we get a flat tire here well

187
00:06:14,919 --> 00:06:18,280
how do we get out of the forest if it's

188
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:19,639
truly going to run off the bead well

189
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,240
we'll show you it's pretty simple go

190
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:23,199
ahead and remove your cradle chain here

191
00:06:21,240 --> 00:06:24,720
and we can run it right around the axle

192
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,840
we're going to say that the back tire is

193
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:30,800
now flat this is just a demonstration

194
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,800
you're going to take said chain

195
00:06:32,680 --> 00:06:37,599
and we're falling over well now your

196
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,280
Tire's off the ground now you can run

197
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:41,240
out on a single you're not going to run

198
00:06:39,280 --> 00:06:43,280
this off its bead you can do the same

199
00:06:41,240 --> 00:06:46,360
thing to both sides if you want to feed

200
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:48,720
this trailer in over a log in a really

201
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:51,880
hard spot to back into we'll repeat the

202
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:51,880
same process over

203
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:57,479
here all right so now both are off the

204
00:06:55,240 --> 00:06:59,639
ground mind you now we just changed the

205
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:01,360
center of balance of this machine

206
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:03,039
because we moved it forward from here to

207
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,680
the center of this axle which takes

208
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,039
incredible amount of weight off of the

209
00:07:04,680 --> 00:07:09,160
tongue so it becomes much lighter and

210
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:10,280
easier to handle and wheel around all

211
00:07:09,160 --> 00:07:14,319
right so if you're not too good at

212
00:07:10,280 --> 00:07:14,319
backing up you can always do

213
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:20,520
this trip on a stick while you're at it

214
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:23,840
and you could position this over your

215
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:25,479
log bring your machine in and connect

216
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,160
okay let's come to the front here this

217
00:07:25,479 --> 00:07:28,680
is the really important part um put a

218
00:07:27,160 --> 00:07:30,879
lot of time effort and thought into how

219
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,360
to make this work work to where is very

220
00:07:30,879 --> 00:07:34,919
strong and very safe for the end user so

221
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:36,680
if you get an apparatus like this behind

222
00:07:34,919 --> 00:07:38,599
you I'm sure you know as well as I do

223
00:07:36,680 --> 00:07:40,360
you manage to flip this thing over well

224
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:41,759
if this goes over and it's connected to

225
00:07:40,360 --> 00:07:42,800
the ball in your four-wheeler what do

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:44,919
you think is going to happen you're

227
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,680
going to roll and it's going to be bad

228
00:07:44,919 --> 00:07:48,680
so what did we do here we created a

229
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:50,520
swiveling tongue this is greaseable here

230
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:52,680
you go your grease zert this is a 1-in

231
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,280
grade 8 shaft passes all the way through

232
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,639
Doom tubing that's quarter wall

233
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,960
thickness 3/8 here in the gusset plate

234
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,759
you can see you have a handle and then

235
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:01,120
obviously your power wire that is going

236
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:02,560
to run your winch and it'll connect to

237
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,280
back to your

238
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:07,759
four-wheeler beautiful so that takes the

239
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,360
safety factor and uh UPS it a lot you

240
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,159
know in the initial phases and testing I

241
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:14,280
was doing some really kind of radical

242
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:15,960
and dumb stuff right well that's R&D

243
00:08:14,280 --> 00:08:18,039
driving as fast as I could and trying to

244
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:20,120
flip my trailer I never was actually

245
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:21,319
successful but it's possible and I know

246
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:23,319
there's guys out there that will take

247
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:25,400
bigger chances than me so this is for

248
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:27,440
that oh factor and it should keep

249
00:08:25,400 --> 00:08:29,080
you out of Harm's Way we'll demonstrate

250
00:08:27,440 --> 00:08:30,759
that later I'll go ahead and throw this

251
00:08:29,080 --> 00:08:32,360
thing over on its side down in the

252
00:08:30,759 --> 00:08:34,519
pasture so this takes us to the next

253
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,519
part this machine does not come with log

254
00:08:34,519 --> 00:08:40,320
Tong well we opted not to do that

255
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:42,399
because everybody's needs for logging

256
00:08:40,320 --> 00:08:44,920
tongs and sizes are very very different

257
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:46,680
so you might say well one size fits all

258
00:08:44,920 --> 00:08:49,000
but that's not been my experience so

259
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:51,440
what I got here is I have a set of 25 in

260
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:53,600
and 18in I find I use these more but

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,120
when you need these you just got to have

262
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:58,920
them as you can see here's your throat

263
00:08:55,120 --> 00:09:00,680
it'll handle up to almost a 31 in log we

264
00:08:58,920 --> 00:09:02,760
call it 30 because you're going to need

265
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,800
a little wiggle room obviously you can

266
00:09:02,760 --> 00:09:06,480
also see here we have deflectors so when

267
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,640
you're backing in and if your guide

268
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,760
liming the log which is probably you

269
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:12,760
didn't limit too well well you don't

270
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,959
have a sharp a here that just

271
00:09:12,760 --> 00:09:17,120
slams into and stops you we figured that

272
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,160
one out real fast first limb stub that I

273
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:21,880
backed into and it stopped me dead in my

274
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:24,040
tracks well we added those so as you can

275
00:09:21,880 --> 00:09:26,560
see we have almost triple the effective

276
00:09:24,040 --> 00:09:29,440
thickness of that 5/8 plate that 5/8

277
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:31,640
plate has zero deflection zero measured

278
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:35,240
deflection when it's being operated so

279
00:09:31,640 --> 00:09:37,839
major Improvement 3/8 plate 3/8 tubing

280
00:09:35,240 --> 00:09:40,000
this is 3in pipe and then let's look up

281
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,519
in here Tristan last but not least we

282
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,399
have an anchoring point for a shackle

283
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,360
here you can run a snatch block on here

284
00:09:43,399 --> 00:09:47,000
to take some load off of your winch if

285
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:49,560
you need to all right you can see our

286
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:51,160
wire passes through our upper tube comes

287
00:09:49,560 --> 00:09:53,440
out all the way to the front so it's

288
00:09:51,160 --> 00:09:55,600
direct shot no slices let's get this

289
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:58,880
thing hooked up and uh we're going to go

290
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:58,880
grab a lot

291
00:10:03,079 --> 00:10:06,640
so we're here on the trail for

292
00:10:04,839 --> 00:10:08,640
demonstration purposes it's kind of hard

293
00:10:06,640 --> 00:10:10,160
out in the brush it's hot as hell and

294
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:12,000
we're getting covered in tick so we're

295
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:13,680
going to be babies and do it right here

296
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:15,920
and it'll be a lot easier to explain and

297
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:18,160
show this is an old southern yellow pine

298
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:20,079
log uh it was cut about a year and a

299
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,200
half ago so it has lost the moisture

300
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:24,279
content but it's still very heavy I can

301
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:26,440
assure you we've been using this through

302
00:10:24,279 --> 00:10:28,440
the R&D process this is one of our

303
00:10:26,440 --> 00:10:29,320
sacrifice our dirty logs we drug this

304
00:10:28,440 --> 00:10:31,399
thing and beat it and everything

305
00:10:29,320 --> 00:10:35,639
everything else so really yeah all right

306
00:10:31,399 --> 00:10:38,120
so we're about 22 in by 24 it's a really

307
00:10:35,639 --> 00:10:39,839
balanced log uh we use this so we

308
00:10:38,120 --> 00:10:41,880
wouldn't be cherry-picking during the

309
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:44,800
design of something that was extremely

310
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:46,040
front heavy giving us a skewed idea of

311
00:10:44,800 --> 00:10:47,800
actually how this would work so we

312
00:10:46,040 --> 00:10:50,160
wanted the log to be balanced so we

313
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:51,959
couldn't say oh yeah we can carry 24t

314
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,680
logs because the butt was this big and

315
00:10:51,959 --> 00:10:56,399
the top was that big right all right

316
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,800
here we got a 7t choker slip hook and a

317
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:00,240
needle now if you can't needle and feed

318
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,360
under this and you're not going to be

319
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,839
able to get it cuz you're on too

320
00:11:01,360 --> 00:11:05,760
perfectly flat of ground which I could

321
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,639
right there and that works but if you

322
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,360
can't we're going to show you how you

323
00:11:07,639 --> 00:11:12,440
would go ahead and feed that here for

324
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:15,600
demonstration purposes I'm going to do a

325
00:11:12,440 --> 00:11:18,360
bad job of backing up as you can see it

326
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:18,360
just slips

327
00:11:21,960 --> 00:11:25,680
[Music]

328
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,000
over now don't let the trailer roll your

329
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:29,680
leg over because it will pull

330
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:33,800
four-wheeler in the trailer back as you

331
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,800
can see so stand outside of your

332
00:11:37,950 --> 00:11:45,120
[Music]

333
00:11:42,040 --> 00:11:47,279
tires it's like 94 to million per

334
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,720
humidity we didn't come here to listen

335
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,720
to any

336
00:11:55,040 --> 00:12:00,839
wi pull that I like to just drop that in

337
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,839
there

338
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:05,880
this creates a little bit of a pendulum

339
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:07,320
effect now I'm going to try first time

340
00:12:05,880 --> 00:12:09,120
I'm just going to pull forward I'm going

341
00:12:07,320 --> 00:12:10,639
to see if it's going to run up and if it

342
00:12:09,120 --> 00:12:14,200
won't because we lose traction of the

343
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:14,200
log skids then we go to plan

344
00:12:17,000 --> 00:12:21,320
B that works Dandy now I'm just going to

345
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:24,360
take this

346
00:12:21,320 --> 00:12:26,040
pen drop it in the desired hole as you

347
00:12:24,360 --> 00:12:28,120
get more used to this machine you'll be

348
00:12:26,040 --> 00:12:29,839
able to eyeball it and know where when

349
00:12:28,120 --> 00:12:32,320
and how which one of those holes you're

350
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:32,320
going to use

351
00:12:34,880 --> 00:12:40,320
so there we go all right now you can see

352
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,800
the logs off the ground up front what is

353
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:45,720
that 8 10 in it's going to come up

354
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,480
higher and I'll show you why now we go

355
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:51,120
ahead and set our tongs

356
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,440
back okay so now we're scoped out you're

357
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,199
going to see as we start winching up

358
00:12:52,440 --> 00:12:55,440
it's going to drive the log forward once

359
00:12:54,199 --> 00:12:58,670
again standing out of the way of your

360
00:12:55,440 --> 00:13:01,440
wheel so you don't get run over

361
