00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,790
we love shooting this video series of

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:07,919
Jesse Hall farmer out of Arlington and

3
00:00:05,790 --> 00:00:11,429
one of the things I want you to pay

4
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:14,040
attention to is how he has changed over

5
00:00:11,429 --> 00:00:16,470
the years not on his operation but his

6
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:21,260
mindset I'm gonna get out of the way and

7
00:00:16,470 --> 00:00:24,060
this way Osito hello I'm Jesse Hall and

8
00:00:21,260 --> 00:00:26,580
I'm farming over in eastern Kingsbury

9
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:28,289
County I currently live on my woman my

10
00:00:26,580 --> 00:00:31,320
mother his dad's place where she grew up

11
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:35,219
years and years ago I started farming

12
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:36,840
back in about 1996 dad gave up about 20

13
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:39,059
acres of land that was kind of my start

14
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:40,469
and I him and I had been farming

15
00:00:39,059 --> 00:00:43,070
together you know pretty much ever since

16
00:00:40,469 --> 00:00:45,510
til he's passing here about a year ago

17
00:00:43,070 --> 00:00:48,239
and dad's basically the one that got our

18
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,850
family started no-tilling here back in

19
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,219
1988 he was friends with dr. Dwayne Beck

20
00:00:50,850 --> 00:00:55,710
and doing at the time was telling dad

21
00:00:53,219 --> 00:00:57,059
about this new idea of no-till and we

22
00:00:55,710 --> 00:00:59,100
were having some problems with soil

23
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:01,230
erosion at the time we wanted to address

24
00:00:59,100 --> 00:01:03,809
and that was kind of what we did on the

25
00:01:01,230 --> 00:01:05,729
wet years particularly you know we would

26
00:01:03,809 --> 00:01:07,680
really really struggle with wet spots

27
00:01:05,729 --> 00:01:10,409
you know and and we were being basically

28
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,510
a corn soybean rotation and occasionally

29
00:01:10,409 --> 00:01:13,710
we'd throw in a note or a winter wheat

30
00:01:12,510 --> 00:01:16,200
or something like that but it's

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:18,060
predominantly corn soybean so what we

32
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:19,979
did is we would get the chisel plow out

33
00:01:18,060 --> 00:01:21,689
and we chose a plow all the low areas

34
00:01:19,979 --> 00:01:23,189
out and then we teal kolevatov the

35
00:01:21,689 --> 00:01:24,840
spring and we thought well you've got

36
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:26,850
all these wet spots so this will fix it

37
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:28,409
well you'd get in and you plant it and

38
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:29,909
then then you only would flood out on

39
00:01:28,409 --> 00:01:31,259
you again and it never did us any good

40
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:34,049
so then we decide okay we're we're gonna

41
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:35,670
try a rotary hoe so we go out and we'd

42
00:01:34,049 --> 00:01:37,560
rotary hoe the fields in all these wet

43
00:01:35,670 --> 00:01:39,090
spots and basically that dried it out

44
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:40,530
that that worked a little better but

45
00:01:39,090 --> 00:01:42,360
then that planet every we'd see that

46
00:01:40,530 --> 00:01:47,040
there was on top of the ground and then

47
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:49,560
you had a mess well in about 2000

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,110
probably 13 or 14 we switched over to it

49
00:01:49,560 --> 00:01:54,000
to a basically a permanent three-way or

50
00:01:52,110 --> 00:01:57,000
rotation where we brought oats back in

51
00:01:54,000 --> 00:02:00,570
so so once we see once we started to

52
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:02,939
your our three-way rotation a lot of

53
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:05,310
those wet spots went away you know

54
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,770
there's a lot of there's a few areas

55
00:02:05,310 --> 00:02:09,929
maybe acre patches or so here and there

56
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:11,670
that were there were always borderline

57
00:02:09,929 --> 00:02:13,170
planning I mean you'd go through with

58
00:02:11,670 --> 00:02:13,890
good conditions and you kind of slop

59
00:02:13,170 --> 00:02:15,330
through that

60
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:16,980
those low spots and you'd get to the

61
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,930
other end and then those little spots

62
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,670
never really recovered a lot of those

63
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:23,000
spots went away you know I take home

64
00:02:20,670 --> 00:02:26,490
messages you got to give stuff time and

65
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:28,110
if you're currently not a no teller the

66
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,670
big thing that you want to do is don't

67
00:02:28,110 --> 00:02:33,300
switch the whole farm over to no tea all

68
00:02:29,670 --> 00:02:36,900
all in one year just go field by field

69
00:02:33,300 --> 00:02:38,220
let it be a progressive thing but if you

70
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:39,750
bring in small grain and start cover

71
00:02:38,220 --> 00:02:41,520
cropping you're going to get your soil

72
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:43,440
structure much faster and you're going

73
00:02:41,520 --> 00:02:46,110
to start seeing your soil turning around

74
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:48,540
much faster and if you bring livestock

75
00:02:46,110 --> 00:02:50,040
and cover crops into it it's just going

76
00:02:48,540 --> 00:02:52,320
to accelerate that whole process even

77
00:02:50,040 --> 00:02:53,820
more so so instead of being three to

78
00:02:52,320 --> 00:02:54,989
five years you might you might start

79
00:02:53,820 --> 00:02:59,730
seeing a difference maybe sooner than

80
00:02:54,989 --> 00:03:01,830
that a lot of people don't think they

81
00:02:59,730 --> 00:03:03,209
can make any money on small drain and I

82
00:03:01,830 --> 00:03:04,860
disagree you know you might have to

83
00:03:03,209 --> 00:03:06,959
market a little harder and you can do it

84
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:08,910
but the one thing you have to take into

85
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:11,810
consideration is the yield bump you get

86
00:03:08,910 --> 00:03:11,810
on the other two years

87
00:03:13,010 --> 00:03:19,270
