1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,480
so cover crops basically they provide a

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,160
source of food for the animals as well

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:09,559
but what you would do is you would plant

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:11,160
those perhaps in late summer early fall

5
00:00:09,559 --> 00:00:13,040
so to speak in your garden and just

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:15,719
direct so and so some of the great cover

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,640
crops are like peas oh there's something

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,359
called hairy vet and there's so many

9
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,199
more but what happens is like peas

10
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,439
especially which are one of my favorites

11
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:28,000
and so are oats they fix nitrogen from

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:30,640
the atmosphere and add it back into the

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:33,440
soil and as you know some the fruiting

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,239
plants like tomatoes and cucumbers they

15
00:00:33,440 --> 00:00:39,040
love a nitrogen rich soil so what you

16
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,480
would do is grow those and just randomly

17
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,160
broadcast sprinkle which is just

18
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,920
basically throw the seeds in the soil

19
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,480
cover it up with a little bit more soil

20
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:49,239
Let It Grow and once it grows a couple

21
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:51,800
of inches tall you can just chop and

22
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,920
drop which is cut them and let them lie

23
00:00:51,800 --> 00:00:56,960
flat while the roots inside provide the

24
00:00:53,920 --> 00:01:00,359
nitrogen the green masses on top going

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,359
to insulate the soil
