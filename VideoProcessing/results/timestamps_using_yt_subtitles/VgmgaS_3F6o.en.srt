process of almond production from

[Applause]

16
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:36,920
the Journey Begins in mid-February when

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,079
Farmers plant almond seedlings this

18
00:00:36,920 --> 00:00:40,680
timing is crucial as it allows the young

19
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,900
plants to develop buds during the

20
00:00:40,680 --> 00:01:02,109
optimal growing season

22
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:11,400
Farmers carefully plant each seedling

23
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,560
ensuring they have enough space to grow

24
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:14,560
and thrive

26
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,719
protective covers are then placed over

00:01:53,000 --> 00:01:58,240
possible over the next 2 years these

32
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:00,479
seedlings grow into young almond trees

33
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:03,119
during this period farmers must provide

34
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:05,240
consistent care to ensure Healthy Growth

35
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:07,640
almond trees are water intensive

36
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,920
requiring regular irrigation drip

37
00:02:07,640 --> 00:02:11,959
irrigation systems are commonly used to

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,519
provide a steady supply of water

00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,840
directly to the roots conserving water

40
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:19,400
while keeping the trees hydrated as the

41
00:02:16,840 --> 00:02:21,280
trees grow Farmers monitor their health

42
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:22,680
looking out for any signs of disease or

43
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:32,760

Almond Tree Care usually done at the

51
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:51,920
crucial for the trees to produce high
