1
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:07,200
so

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:07,440
my name is david forster and this talk

3
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,000
is

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:14,080
introduction to soil minerals and um

5
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:16,560
to just to warn anyone who was here last

6
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:17,840
year i'm basically doing the exact same

7
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,320
talk i did last year

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,279
on the exact same subject uh there seems

9
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:22,560
to be enough confusion

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,800
around it that it's good to hear it a

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,400
few times um

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:27,680
i'm not an exception that took me a long

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,599
time comparing the same thing over and

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,279
over to learn it so

15
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:32,880
to warn you though if you thought you

16
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,760
got everything out of it last year

17
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,680
you may want to try a different one um i

18
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,520
have a little more time this year

19
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:42,320
so i'll cover things in a little more

20
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,399
depth that i did last year

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,480
basically my goal with this is to give

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,360
you a foundation for understanding

23
00:00:46,480 --> 00:00:50,800
uh the soil system and what we at the

24
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:54,480
bfa talk about

25
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:56,399
and what really is it the the

26
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:57,760
one way of looking at what is at the

27
00:00:56,399 --> 00:00:58,800
root of what

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:00,559
basically every one of the other

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
speakers here is talking about what's

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:05,119
going on in the soil

31
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:06,400
and i look at the soil minerals because

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,880
it's very concrete

33
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:10,479
it's something i can start with i'm

34
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:12,000
going to leave a lot of space at the

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,080
end of this talk a lot of time for

36
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:16,479
questions q a

37
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,080
um some of the other speakers here at

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,720
the conference i think have

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:21,759
brought up some issues that uh may make

40
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,040
me think that

41
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,600
i'm perhaps crazy to focus on this and i

42
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,840
want to

43
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:29,520
leave time to have those discussions

44
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:31,920
because i think that there are nuances

45
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:31,920
to all this

46
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,000
they are very important soil minerals

47
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:38,799
are very important

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,119
um but they are not the most important

49
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:40,799
thing

50
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,040
but they're a good place for people who

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:46,880
are just starting to start looking at

52
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:50,159
so with that introduction

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,200
i'll get started so like i said i'm

54
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
david forster

55
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:57,520
i'm the bfa agronomist staff agronomist

56
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:58,240
i also have my own consulting company i

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,600
consult with

58
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:05,520
private clients doing soil and farm

59
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:08,479
consulting and what i always focus on

60
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,119
is looking at the soil and i look at

61
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
what are the

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,120
limiting factors to soil health and so

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,680
that's where i

64
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:16,959
start every conversation and everything

65
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,800
when i'm talking to pharmacists

66
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,239
what are the limiting factors to get the

67
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,239
results that you want

68
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:23,440
so that's another key point here is that

69
00:02:22,239 --> 00:02:24,480
it depends on what you're trying to

70
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,560
accomplish

71
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,640
uh and that sets sort of the framework

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:32,160
for how to think about this stuff

73
00:02:28,640 --> 00:02:36,319
um the other goal with this

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:38,480
talk is to demystify the entire

75
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,640
thought process around this if you go

76
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,120
out and start reading books on this

77
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,920
you will likely get overwhelmed i mean

78
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,200
raise your hand if you've been

79
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:46,879
overwhelmed if you've been reading about

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,800
this stuff

81
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,879
it's very really very well and one of

82
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,560
the main reasons is because

83
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,319
we're dealing with living systems

84
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,360
they're complex

85
00:02:54,319 --> 00:03:00,159
and there is more

86
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:00,400
in those books that you've read more of

87
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,319
it

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:05,760
is dedicated to the sort of nuances the

89
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,280
what-ifs the things that

90
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,120
you're frankly most people aren't ever

91
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:10,640
going to deal with the actual

92
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:12,400
fundamental

93
00:03:10,640 --> 00:03:14,400
baseline of this is is not that

94
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,159
complicated it only gets complicated

95
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:17,680
when you start adding on all the

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,080
well what if you have this what if you

97
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:22,000
have too much magnesium what do you have

98
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,080
all these little things that in reality

99
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,519
if you're farming a piece of ground you

100
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,200
probably only have to deal with a couple

101
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,400
of your personal what-ifs

102
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,840
so i'm going to try to point out how to

103
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,840
think about it so that you can get

104
00:03:31,840 --> 00:03:35,440
quickly to what you need to worry about

105
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:37,040
and stop worrying about all the other

106
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:37,920
stuff that you only need to worry about

107
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:40,720
if you

108
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:40,720
want to do what i do

109
00:03:44,840 --> 00:03:48,720
so

110
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,760
so the other thing i want to do here is

111
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,720
before i

112
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:53,439
forget to do this before i lose track of

113
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,480
time

114
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
talk about some of the resources you

115
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,879
have available when we leave here so

116
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,840
financing.org the website we have a lot

117
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:01,519
of

118
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,000
information there in the growers section

119
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,599
especially uh we're reorganizing and

120
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,360
trying to do a better job of

121
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:12,400
presenting it these prep my presentation

122
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:13,280
and all the presentations here at the

123
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,680
conference with

124
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,600
maybe one or two exceptions uh will be

125
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,799
made available to everyone on the

126
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
website

127
00:04:18,799 --> 00:04:22,160
um that's a really gonna be a really

128
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,199
good resource we also have our

129
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:25,600
conference recording from past years we

130
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,160
have

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,680
uh you can download the audio from every

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,840
one of them i believe

133
00:04:29,680 --> 00:04:33,360
uh and there will be video for the ones

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:34,479
that we successfully have managed a

135
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:37,680
video this year

136
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:40,720
as well so that's a good place to go

137
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,199
i do free agronomy consulting calls once

138
00:04:40,720 --> 00:04:43,600
a month

139
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:44,720
virtually and um if you go to this

140
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,680
website tiny

141
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,680
dot cc slash soil health that's the

142
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:51,440
media trans version of the link

143
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:52,800
and you can learn about how to get

144
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:55,520
connected with that

anyone who might be interested in

151
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:10,560
learning how to create better food or

152
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:12,240
you know grow better anything really um

153
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919

december 12th

159
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:28,880
so it's coming up soon um i also do

160
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:30,080
through the bfa discounted one-on-one in

161
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,280
group consulting

162
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,199
um for anyone who wants that

163
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,120
the one-on-one is generally to help

164
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:38,160
people interpret their soil test results

165
00:05:37,120 --> 00:05:39,840
get them started

166
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,919
and then group is something i would love

167
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,160
to do more of and that would be

168
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:45,680
if you have a local horticulture group

169
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,880
or a local vfa chapter

170
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,880
something like that i could come and

171
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,840
give a talk

172
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,280
and then we also have local chapters

173
00:05:51,840 --> 00:05:56,080
throughout the country they keep

174
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:57,680
popping up uh more and more if you

175
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:58,720
anyone here wants to start one get in

176
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,199
touch with us

177
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,000
we have a mineral depot system we buy in

178
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,000
bulk

179
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,520
many of the minerals that you might need

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:07,280
and

181
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:08,960
and the biology and some of the other

182
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:12,000
products that are hard to find

183
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:14,880
and we make them available to chapters

184
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:16,080
um as best we can and that's a really

185
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:18,400
good way to get things that are hard to

186
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,400
find

187
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:21,840
so

188
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:25,360
uh all right i start with this picture

189
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:27,680
if you were here

190
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
last year you've seen this picture uh

191
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,919
this is

192
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,800
in minnesota and it's one of the first

193
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:34,639
places on earth

194
00:06:32,800 --> 00:06:36,400
there's i think two inches of elevation

195
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:39,680
change in five miles

196
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:43,120
it's the bottom of an ancient seabed

197
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:46,319
and places in this valley are

198
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,199
extremely salty as in sodium salt

199
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,840
and things grow really well when you

200
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,160
have everything

201
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:53,280
working well but um i'll talk about this

202
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,479
a little more later but i

203
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:57,919
just wanted to mention now that when

204
00:06:56,479 --> 00:06:59,759
the group that i was working with

205
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,759
started in this field about

206
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:02,960
20 to 25 percent of this field had

207
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:05,039
nothing going on so

208
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,319
it looked like these areas here totally

209
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:08,560
back up

210
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,240
20 to 25 percent around the perimeter of

211
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,840
all these fields looked like that

212
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,199
not even weeds wouldn't even correct

213
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:13,680
something they were spraying ground up

214
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:16,479
there

215
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,440
just weeds would not grow and not only

216
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:20,560
did weeds not grow

217
00:07:17,440 --> 00:07:21,440
but the soil wasn't this sort of darkish

218
00:07:20,560 --> 00:07:23,280
gray color

219
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:25,599
it was white it looked like it had just

220
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,599
snowed in the middle of summer

221
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,680
and that's because of all the salt the

222
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:33,120
sodium that was in that field

223
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,240
and this picture was taken just about

224
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:38,400
i think it was three years uh

225
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,000
after that after that point here it was

226
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:42,400
20 assault

227
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:44,319
and all but just this little part around

228
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:47,280
the outside edge was

229
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,759
planted uh it no longer looks white and

230
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:49,199
they were

231
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:50,879
actually growing really really healthy

232
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:51,919
sunflowers there i mean it's still a

233
00:07:50,879 --> 00:07:54,479
modern crop

234
00:07:51,919 --> 00:07:56,080
cultivation system but uh they were

235
00:07:54,479 --> 00:07:56,879
actually building organic matter in the

236
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,319
soil

237
00:07:56,879 --> 00:08:03,360
and it wasn't organic but practically

238
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,840
might as well have been they were

239
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,960
not certified almost entirely organic

240
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,639
practices there

241
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,080
and so in a very short period of time

242
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,840
they took soil that

243
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,440
literally wouldn't grow anything and

244
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:14,080
they turned it around to grow healthy

245
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,840
plants

246
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:18,479
and they did that with a combination of

247
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,000
minerals and biology

248
00:08:18,479 --> 00:08:21,280
people around there tried it with just

249
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:22,960
biology people around there try to

250
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:26,160
adjust minerals and it doesn't work

251
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,680
or it takes a lot longer so when you

252
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,160
work together and figure out what the

253
00:08:27,680 --> 00:08:30,080
limiting

254
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
factors are in your system you can have

255
00:08:30,080 --> 00:08:33,919
some tremendous results

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,760
so i'll come back to exactly how this

257
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,839
was done when we're talking about soil

258
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,240
test results and working with your soil

259
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:42,640
system

260
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,360
so i want to start sort of letting this

261
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,200
foundation

262
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,399
with a discussion of what is soil

263
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:50,399
fertility

264
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:52,320
and soil fertility is the harmonious

265
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:53,920
interaction of a number of components of

266
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,399
soil so their

267
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,160
air water the physical chemical so it's

268
00:08:56,399 --> 00:09:00,640
minerals it's biology

269
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,200
they all have to work together to create

270
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:03,760
healthy

271
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,480
living soils if you're missing any one

272
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:05,920
piece of that

273
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:08,000
then you don't really have healthy

274
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:11,680
living soils you have

275
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:15,279
dirt basically or or something that's

276
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:17,279
not working at its maximum potential

277
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:18,880
and so if you don't have these things

278
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,720
you don't have clay

279
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:27,279
silk sand water air minerals biology

280
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,440
you cannot build soil you cannot

281
00:09:27,279 --> 00:09:30,560
grow healthy plants you may be able to

282
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,160
grow plants that look healthy but

283
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:33,839
they're going to be limited or they're

284
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:35,600
going to be

285
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,440
expensive in the sense that you have to

286
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:40,000
continuously dump something on there to

287
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,560
keep them alive and growing and happy

288
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,920
in this picture here it's just a sort of

289
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,560
standard

290
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:47,279
chart of the physical composition of

291
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,959
soil

292
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,600
in terms of clay uh silt sand

293
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:54,880
and various compositions of type various

294
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,680
categories of

295
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:57,680
loam in the middle

296
00:09:58,959 --> 00:10:04,560
and so the key thing about fertile

297
00:10:02,399 --> 00:10:05,760
healthy living soils is they are

298
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,519
compounded

299
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,600
when you have healthy soil pretty much

300
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:13,600
by definition you're

301
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:16,720
creating more of it the

302
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,000
the great plains uh had in places many

303
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,839
dozens of feet of soil

304
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,519
that were built over many millions of

305
00:10:19,839 --> 00:10:25,040
years and that was done

306
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,720
through the healthy symbiotic

307
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,720
relationships between the various

308
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:29,680
components of soil biology the minerals

309
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:32,560
the air the water

310
00:10:29,680 --> 00:10:34,640
the plants etc and as they grow they

311
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:35,519
actually produce more soil they produce

312
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:36,800
topsoil

313
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:38,640
and they do that by breaking down the

314
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:40,800
rock breaking down the parent material

315
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,560
incorporating organic matter and that

316
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:43,360
that process creates what we think of as

317
00:10:42,560 --> 00:10:45,440
top soil

318
00:10:43,360 --> 00:10:46,880
and that topsoil is able to support life

319
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,760
and grow abundance and

320
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,720
continue to create more of it and this

321
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:53,760
is something that

322
00:10:50,720 --> 00:10:57,040
our industrial agricultural system

323
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,839
has been mining this soil for a number

324
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,240
of years

325
00:10:57,839 --> 00:11:01,680
and until we can get away from that and

326
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,519
start building soil

327
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,600
uh we aren't really it's not a

328
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:06,240
sustainable model uh it is just like

329
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,200
mining

330
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:10,079
in any other sense and so what i'm

331
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:12,320
really talking here is

332
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,680
called pedogenesis this is the building

333
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:18,640
of soil and creation of soil

334
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:19,680
and there's an equation made up by a

335
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:22,720
russian geologist

336
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:24,640
that defines how you create soil and

337
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,480
creative soil is a function of these

338
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,959
things that are down here at the bottom

339
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:29,680
it's a function of climate prepared

340
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:32,720
material

341
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:34,079
biological process and time and

342
00:11:32,720 --> 00:11:36,000
there's only certain multiples that i

343
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:40,640
can control i cannot control time

344
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:43,360
it can be kind of cool i can control

345
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,720
somewhat climate like in terms of i can

346
00:11:43,360 --> 00:11:45,200
make sure that my plants have enough

347
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,880
water

348
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:48,880
i can make sure i can do mean

349
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,920
differences make sure that they have

350
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:53,360
so i have hair uh that there's stuff

351
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:55,360
happening around them

352
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,920
you know the gases they need etc i can

353
00:11:55,360 --> 00:12:00,639
do that to some degree

354
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,480
i can impact biological processes for

355
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
sure i can bring in inoculants i can

356
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:06,720
feed microbes

357
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,360
i can um i can bring in the things that

358
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:09,680
are missing

359
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,200
and try to balance and keep them alive

360
00:12:09,680 --> 00:12:12,720
and then i can also do this this

361
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,920
apparent material so

362
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:18,160
we think of soil as this sort of

363
00:12:15,920 --> 00:12:19,360
stamped stable thing it's been there for

364
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:20,880
a long time

365
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,480
we go out there we just look at soil and

366
00:12:20,880 --> 00:12:24,320
assume that that

367
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:27,200
dirt out there it's always been there

368
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:28,639
but in many cases around here

369
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,480
one of the ways it got there is through

370
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,760
glaciation it's been through

371
00:12:30,480 --> 00:12:37,200
geological processes these things take

372
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:39,680
millions and millions of years and so

373
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:41,360
the way i think about building soil is

374
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:42,079
that what i'm trying to do is make this

375
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:44,800
equation

376
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:45,680
as efficient as time or as efficient as

377
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:46,959
possible

378
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:49,760
and the thing i can't control is this

379
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:52,000
one so i worry about these

380
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,279
so i always tell people if you can't

381
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,079
maintain hydration

382
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,200
you can't keep your plants moist none of

383
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,959
these things matter

384
00:12:57,200 --> 00:13:00,480
violet's going to die the minerals are

385
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:01,279
going to sit there doesn't matter don't

386
00:13:00,480 --> 00:13:04,399
waste your money

387
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:06,800
if you can't do that so um

388
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,240
and the same thing applies to any other

389
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,639
ones if you have biology

390
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,680
but you don't have uh the hydration if

391
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:14,880
you don't have

392
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,720
the minerals necessary to have as much

393
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:17,600
diversity as you can in biological

394
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:20,480
processes

395
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:21,279
as much vibrancy there then you are to

396
00:13:20,480 --> 00:13:23,600
some degree

397
00:13:21,279 --> 00:13:24,720
wasting some of that investment of time

398
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:26,639
or money

399
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,800
and so i like to look at all of them

400
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:31,760
together find where my weaknesses are

401
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,600
and focus on those i'm a lean sigma

402
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:34,720
black belt by training as an industrial

403
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:38,320
engineering

404
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:38,800
uh methodology and so what i learned was

405
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,600
always

406
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,320
find your um your weakest link link in

407
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:43,839
the system

408
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,839
and that's where you want to focus

409
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,199
because until you fix that one

410
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
everything else you're doing is a waste

411
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:51,519
of your time and in farming it's

412
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,279
very similar if you're spending all your

413
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:55,839
time um

414
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:57,279
making really awesome compost tea but

415
00:13:55,839 --> 00:13:59,279
you're not making sure your plants

416
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:00,880
maintain hydration or that you've got a

417
00:13:59,279 --> 00:14:03,360
little bit of boron there

418
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,480
then you might actually just be wasting

419
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:08,720
your time

420
00:14:04,480 --> 00:14:09,279
so try not to get stuck on in a dogmatic

421
00:14:08,720 --> 00:14:12,480
approach

422
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:14,240
to your farming your growing practices

423
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,920
i think that's one of the things that

424
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,839
where a lot of people get tripped up

425
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:18,959
they hear a great idea and it's a great

426
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:19,920
idea and they think it's a great idea

427
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:21,360
for them

428
00:14:19,920 --> 00:14:23,440
and then they wonder why it doesn't work

429
00:14:21,360 --> 00:14:26,880
and it doesn't work probably because

430
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:29,040
they've never thought of this so

431
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:30,000
um and why is pedogenesis important

432
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,639
pedogenesis

433
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,680
is important because basically if you

434
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:36,720
aren't growing soil

435
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:39,680
you are likely destroying it

436
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:40,320
soil is rather easy to destroy and so if

437
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,320
you're not

438
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:43,839
making your decisions in a way that

439
00:14:42,320 --> 00:14:44,959
you're really consciously thinking about

440
00:14:43,839 --> 00:14:48,079
how can i grow

441
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:51,199
more soil make it healthier and heavier

442
00:14:48,079 --> 00:14:53,040
you're likely destroyed um

443
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:54,720
you're likely not sitting on the knife

444
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:57,199
edge of in between

445
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:58,079
perfectly balanced between um just

446
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:00,240
barely

447
00:14:58,079 --> 00:15:01,360
not destroying it or not building it so

448
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,079
if you're not

449
00:15:01,360 --> 00:15:05,680
seeing new soil being created you're not

450
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,240
seeing improvements in your soil over

451
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,839
time

452
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:12,800
then you're probably engaged in mining

453
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,320
so keep that in mind um so what i like

454
00:15:12,800 --> 00:15:15,600
to do when i look at

455
00:15:14,320 --> 00:15:17,199
accelerated heterogenesis and that's

456
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:19,360
what i want to do to make this equation

457
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:20,800
as efficient as possible

458
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:23,680
and what i like to do when i do that i

459
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,040
don't just you know go out and try to

460
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:26,959
throw chemical fertilizer or anything

461
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:30,079
like that what i do is mimic

462
00:15:26,959 --> 00:15:31,120
natural processes so i try to eliminate

463
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,000
the inefficiencies

464
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,079
in them what i see in my system and

465
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:39,360
mimic natural processes

466
00:15:36,079 --> 00:15:41,440
if i didn't care about making money

467
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,240
i didn't care about feeding my family i

468
00:15:41,440 --> 00:15:47,279
could wait for the next glacier

469
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:48,320
but i have a short life span and i'd

470
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,920
like to

471
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:51,920
be a shepherd to the land that i take

472
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,800
care of i like to teach my

473
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,800
farmers and science staff as well and so

474
00:15:54,800 --> 00:15:58,880
that to me is really important so

475
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:01,199
if you have enough time to wait you

476
00:15:58,880 --> 00:16:03,360
don't have to really worry about this

477
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,040
but most of us don't have those types of

478
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,560
time scales available to us

479
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:08,480
and i would propose that what we need to

480
00:16:06,560 --> 00:16:09,600
be doing is helping nature out a little

481
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:12,399
bit

482
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,920
what we're doing is not necessarily

483
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:16,720
counter to what nature

484
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,320
intends we're just trying to work within

485
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,600
those systems accelerate them for our

486
00:16:18,320 --> 00:16:22,160
own purposes

487
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:24,320
so these are the things i i look at i

488
00:16:22,160 --> 00:16:27,360
look at creating more perfect climate

489
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,399
um ensuring that we have adequate and

490
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
balanced

491
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:31,759
minerals so that's the parent materials

492
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:33,759
and also

493
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,040
eliminating stress on biology so that

494
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,519
might mean

495
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:38,480
you may not have biology that's a thing

496
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:40,079
that happens

497
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,519
uh so you may have to bring it in and

498
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,160
then you may have to feed it and take

499
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:45,920
care of it

500
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:47,440
um people here that's not a big

501
00:16:45,920 --> 00:16:49,519
shock to when i talk to conventional

502
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:52,639
growers generally when they hear

503
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:53,759
soil biology um if they've really

504
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:55,839
thought about it all they've

505
00:16:53,759 --> 00:16:57,120
usually thought about it in terms of um

506
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:58,480
something trying to kill their plants

507
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:00,720
that they have to spray

508
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:01,519
and so it's this is a big leap for some

509
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:04,400
people

510
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:05,120
um but at the same time it doesn't take

511
00:17:04,400 --> 00:17:08,160
much to

512
00:17:05,120 --> 00:17:10,640
get this the one thing many

513
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,559
a lot of the soil the pathogens and soil

514
00:17:10,640 --> 00:17:15,280
they actually have protective

515
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:16,160
properties for other pathogens and when

516
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,280
they're balanced

517
00:17:16,160 --> 00:17:23,120
uh they actually help plants uh grow

518
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:25,199
better so um i'm gonna

519
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:26,400
blank on the example i had in mind then

520
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:30,160
that's great but

521
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:34,480
we'll get back to that so

522
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:37,760
delving into the sort of nitrate

523
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:38,480
of what how of soil and how some of the

524
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:41,520
minerals

525
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:44,320
place a role in healthy soils

526
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:45,440
um starting i'll start with this so for

527
00:17:44,320 --> 00:17:49,760
this picture

528
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,760
so this is how you can think of

529
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:55,120
how minerals stick into soil so this box

530
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,240
represents

531
00:17:55,120 --> 00:17:58,960
the clay portion of soil and these

532
00:17:58,240 --> 00:18:01,919
minerals

533
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:02,960
are some of the cation elements that are

534
00:18:01,919 --> 00:18:06,400
in those soils

535
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:08,640
so cations cats generally think of as

536
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:10,480
positive unless you're allergic

537
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,000
anions are like ants and you know

538
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,120
they're you know positive unless they're

539
00:18:12,000 --> 00:18:15,280
in your kitchen so we

540
00:18:13,120 --> 00:18:17,840
you know that let's call it negative so

541
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,400
ants are negative cancer positive

542
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:22,240
and so these are cations which means

543
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,720
that they can stick to soil

544
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:25,440
uh soil colloid the clay particles and

545
00:18:24,720 --> 00:18:27,200
soil

546
00:18:25,440 --> 00:18:28,559
because they have an electrostatic

547
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,880
charge where they're attracted to each

548
00:18:28,559 --> 00:18:32,480
other

549
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:33,919
so what what soil is made up of what the

550
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:35,280
clay component of soil we're going to

551
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:37,200
talk a lot about clay and i'll tell you

552
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:40,160
why in a second but

553
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:41,039
clay soil particles stick minerals to

554
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:43,919
them

555
00:18:41,039 --> 00:18:44,799
and the amount of play you have can vary

556
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:47,760
tremendously

557
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:49,039
and also how many sites can be on the

558
00:18:47,760 --> 00:18:52,080
play so this is

559
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,280
a box it's a certain size box and the

560
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:55,200
same size box

561
00:18:53,280 --> 00:18:56,880
in different types of clay can have a

562
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:58,160
different number of these elements stuck

563
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,919
to it

564
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:01,840
and that's based on the age the

565
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:04,080
weathering the type of clay it is

566
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:05,280
some clays just naturally hold more

567
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:08,080
minerals

568
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:08,960
and some clays are very weathered so in

569
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:10,880
the south

570
00:19:08,960 --> 00:19:12,559
southeast united states for instance a

571
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:15,600
lot of the clays are very old

572
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,880
geologically and weathered and the soil

573
00:19:15,600 --> 00:19:18,880
may be

574
00:19:16,880 --> 00:19:20,320
pure clay practically but they hold very

575
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:24,799
little nutrients

576
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,559
some people have heard of this um and

577
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:28,240
we'll talk about how you address that in

578
00:19:26,559 --> 00:19:30,799
just a moment uh but

579
00:19:28,240 --> 00:19:31,440
what i want to point out here too is

580
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,720
that

581
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:37,679
clay isn't in a box shape like this clay

582
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:38,799
is is comes in sheets so there's layers

583
00:19:37,679 --> 00:19:40,559
of clay

584
00:19:38,799 --> 00:19:42,480
and on the outside edges of those clay

585
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:44,720
you'll have a lot of these elements

586
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:46,799
and sometimes you'll have some of those

587
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,840
stuck between the layers of clay

588
00:19:46,799 --> 00:19:51,120
and the size of these elements actually

589
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:53,360
will influence

590
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:54,720
how closely those clay layers are stick

591
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:56,080
to each other

592
00:19:54,720 --> 00:19:57,760
and so one thing i'll talk about a

593
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,240
little later in more detail

594
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,000
is that certain things like calcium make

595
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:05,120
those clay layers

596
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:07,520
get further apart things like magnesium

597
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:08,880
tend to have them stuck closer together

598
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:11,440
and when they're close together they can

599
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,039
trap things inside of them and it can

600
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:14,799
change the physical properties of how

601
00:20:13,039 --> 00:20:17,919
the clay reacts in soil

602
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:17,919
and this is the piece where

603
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:21,760
where it's important to realize that

604
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,600
when you're adding soil minerals you're

605
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,240
not just adding soil minerals because

606
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:26,080
you think

607
00:20:24,240 --> 00:20:28,400
that there's not enough in the soil it's

608
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:30,320
also about changing the physical

609
00:20:28,400 --> 00:20:32,640
and uh the physical properties of that

610
00:20:30,320 --> 00:20:35,520
soil and how biology

611
00:20:32,640 --> 00:20:37,120
works within it and to create a more

612
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,039
efficient system

613
00:20:37,120 --> 00:20:42,159
so we're going to talk about that more

614
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:42,159
in a minute um

615
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,000
changing gears slightly here um

616
00:20:46,320 --> 00:20:50,320
there's this concept that there is an

617
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:53,440
ideal cation balance

618
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:54,080
um dr william albright came up with this

619
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:55,840
concept

620
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:57,280
he did a lot of research around the

621
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,559
world studying

622
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:03,600
places where animals uh and

623
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:05,039
people but mostly animals uh nutrition

624
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,760
and health was higher than in other

625
00:21:05,039 --> 00:21:06,960
places

626
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:08,880
and he found that there was this

627
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,840
correlation between the health of the

628
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,799
animals

629
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:13,760
and the soil in which their food was

630
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,640
grown

631
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:17,200
and the and basically what he found was

632
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,480
that

633
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,080
anywhere in the world and almost and

634
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:23,440
then he started looking on the cross

635
00:21:20,080 --> 00:21:23,440
anybody wrote any props

636
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:30,400
if they if it approximated this ideal

637
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,520
cation balance everything seemed to work

638
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
better

639
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:35,360
and so he spent basically the rest of

640
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:38,559
his career studying this

641
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:41,919
and so that ideal cation

642
00:21:38,559 --> 00:21:44,480
balance is approximately 68 calcium

643
00:21:41,919 --> 00:21:45,280
12 percent magnesium four percent

644
00:21:44,480 --> 00:21:47,039
potassium

645
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:49,760
one percent sodium and the trace

646
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:53,600
elements the trace electron

647
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:57,039
now one important thing here is that um

648
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,880
going back to this the amount of

649
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,640
minerals that can be held onto

650
00:21:58,880 --> 00:22:02,559
the tight portion of the soil remember

651
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,880
these are cations there's a name for

652
00:22:02,559 --> 00:22:04,320
that

653
00:22:02,880 --> 00:22:06,000
and that's called the total exchange

654
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:09,120
capacity so it's the total

655
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:11,520
capacity of your soil of your

656
00:22:09,120 --> 00:22:12,159
mostly it's clay because it plays tiny

657
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:14,480
it has

658
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:15,679
a huge surface area which is why so many

659
00:22:14,480 --> 00:22:19,120
things can stick to it

660
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:20,320
uh very many orders of magnitude less

661
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,480
things stick to silt

662
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:23,760
and many orders of magnitude less things

663
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:25,280
stick to sand

664
00:22:23,760 --> 00:22:27,280
so the clay is really where most stuff

665
00:22:25,280 --> 00:22:30,400
sticks in terms of cations

666
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:33,760
and so the amount of this stuff that can

667
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:37,919
stick to this size box of clay

668
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:39,520
or soil is the total exchange capacity

669
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:41,120
that's an important thing to keep in

670
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:44,240
mind because

671
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:45,360
that is what relates the percent of

672
00:22:44,240 --> 00:22:46,799
these elements

673
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,960
to the actual amount of pounds you need

674
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,159
to have in your soil to have a balanced

675
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:54,080
soil that

676
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:57,919
works well and um

677
00:22:54,080 --> 00:23:01,679
when you have this in your soil

678
00:22:57,919 --> 00:23:04,159
it leads to a ph of 6.4

679
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:04,159
every time

680
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:10,320
when you are higher or lower in some of

681
00:23:08,000 --> 00:23:13,360
the cations it changes your ph

682
00:23:10,320 --> 00:23:13,360
and this is also why

683
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:19,600
ph is a core metric for soil health

684
00:23:16,880 --> 00:23:20,240
and mineral balance it's because

685
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,799
basically

686
00:23:20,240 --> 00:23:23,440
all of these things in all of these

687
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,720
things

688
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:28,720
impact ph but

689
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,760
we don't know which ones and so for

690
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,880
instance this

691
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:34,320
calcium actually impacts ph less than

692
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:36,320
magnesium which is less than catalyst

693
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:39,200
potassium which is less than sodium

694
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,960
so you may have and actually this goes

695
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:45,360
back to the minnesota picture

696
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,159
um the ph in that soil was i think 8.4

697
00:23:45,360 --> 00:23:48,720
so it's very basic uh if you're from new

698
00:23:48,159 --> 00:23:52,320
england

699
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:54,880
we'll see of you can't imagine at 8.4 ph

700
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,320
uh you're usually 5.4 maybe six if

701
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,200
you're you know been working on for a

702
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:00,720
while

703
00:23:57,200 --> 00:24:01,919
um but out there was 8.4 it was because

704
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,880
they had super high

705
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,640
sodium and magnesium which has a big

706
00:24:04,880 --> 00:24:08,559
influence on ph

707
00:24:06,640 --> 00:24:10,080
and the solution to their many of their

708
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:12,000
issues which we'll get to a minute was

709
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:13,200
adding calcium they literally added

710
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:16,880
basically limestone

711
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:19,440
and their ph went down

712
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,880
this is totally count counter to the

713
00:24:19,440 --> 00:24:24,159
sort of accepted

714
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:26,400
uh truth about lyme and ph normally

715
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,279
you have low ph you add mind with ph

716
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,880
goes up

717
00:24:27,279 --> 00:24:33,919
well that's only if uh

718
00:24:30,880 --> 00:24:36,320
you need the um if you're deficient

719
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:37,279
in in these in these catalysts if you're

720
00:24:36,320 --> 00:24:39,919
excessive

721
00:24:37,279 --> 00:24:40,880
in anything but calcium you can actually

722
00:24:39,919 --> 00:24:44,000
see the ph go

723
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:45,520
down when you enlarge them so there's a

724
00:24:44,000 --> 00:24:47,360
lot of nuances here about things

725
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,919
that are like half truths that get just

726
00:24:47,360 --> 00:24:52,159
sort of repeated because it's simple

727
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:53,919
and i'm going to try to explain them in

728
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,840
enough detail that you understand it

729
00:24:53,919 --> 00:24:58,880
without current confusion so

730
00:24:55,840 --> 00:25:01,120
uh anyway so then

731
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,400
one last caveat to this is that this

732
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:05,840
ideal balance

733
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:08,880
this ideal count imbalance is subject

734
00:25:05,840 --> 00:25:10,000
to change a little bit based on your

735
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:11,440
exchange capacity

736
00:25:10,000 --> 00:25:13,200
you have low exchange capacity you have

737
00:25:11,440 --> 00:25:14,320
to modify these numbers a little bit if

738
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:16,320
you have super high

739
00:25:14,320 --> 00:25:17,840
uh you have to modify them a little bit

740
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:21,120
but by and large that's

741
00:25:17,840 --> 00:25:21,120
that's a good target

742
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:25,760
all right and so um

743
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:30,880
these are what these are our recommended

744
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:33,679
values

745
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:35,600
for the elements of soil tests and this

746
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,400
is a logan lab soil test

747
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,360
and i want you to be very clear if

748
00:25:38,400 --> 00:25:41,919
you're taking notes

749
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,919
that this is based on a logan labs base

750
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:47,120
saturation

751
00:25:43,919 --> 00:25:48,159
test any other lab any other type of

752
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:51,440
soil test

753
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:53,039
you cannot use these numbers

754
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:54,799
very clear here if you apply these

755
00:25:53,039 --> 00:25:57,600
numbers to other people's tests

756
00:25:54,799 --> 00:25:58,320
you likely will screw things up because

757
00:25:57,600 --> 00:26:01,039
they don't

758
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:02,720
all test the same way um it is not that

759
00:26:01,039 --> 00:26:04,159
they test something that it's uh it's

760
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:06,559
not wrong it's not bad

761
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:08,400
it's that this cannot apply in the same

762
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:10,240
way

763
00:26:08,400 --> 00:26:11,679
the best thing to do is ask your lab

764
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:15,679
what they recommend

765
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:18,000
um mandy lab will be happy to do so

766
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,000
my only issue is that many labs do not

767
00:26:18,000 --> 00:26:23,039
even look at half of these things

768
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:25,200
and that's a problem for me um

769
00:26:23,039 --> 00:26:26,960
but that being said people after using

770
00:26:25,200 --> 00:26:27,760
labs that do different methods they get

771
00:26:26,960 --> 00:26:29,760
good results

772
00:26:27,760 --> 00:26:32,000
uh i'm not saying my way is the only way

773
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:36,320
or even remotely the best way

774
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:38,640
but it does work and i don't work so

775
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:39,440
this is this is on the website this uh

776
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:42,799
here's the

777
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:43,440
link to it tiny dot cc slash mineral

778
00:26:42,799 --> 00:26:45,520
targets

779
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:47,200
if you don't want to scribble it down it

780
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,600
is also on your handout

781
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:51,679
again menu doesn't have a handout um

782
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:54,960
grab one we're gonna get to that

783
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:59,200
on the far left side of the handout is

784
00:26:54,960 --> 00:27:01,520
a quick dirty version of this

785
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:01,520
all right

786
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
all right all right so

787
00:27:08,080 --> 00:27:11,440
we're going to jump into the soil the

788
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:13,120
soil tests

789
00:27:11,440 --> 00:27:15,039
um on the sheet on the handout you've

790
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:16,720
got three different sort of tests

791
00:27:15,039 --> 00:27:18,720
representing some variation

792
00:27:16,720 --> 00:27:20,559
that i was able to pull together to show

793
00:27:18,720 --> 00:27:22,320
some uh interesting things

794
00:27:20,559 --> 00:27:24,240
to should be aware of and make some

795
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:28,159
points

796
00:27:24,240 --> 00:27:29,440
and every time i look at soil tests um

797
00:27:28,159 --> 00:27:31,360
the first thing you always want to look

798
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,039
at is your tc numbers

799
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:34,880
so at the toward the top about the third

800
00:27:33,039 --> 00:27:36,880
line down you've got tc

801
00:27:34,880 --> 00:27:38,559
for the vegetable garden sample it's

802
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:40,159
10.29

803
00:27:38,559 --> 00:27:42,559
and if you remember i was mentioning

804
00:27:40,159 --> 00:27:45,679
that that's a really important number

805
00:27:42,559 --> 00:27:48,480
that's important because it is what

806
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,120
tells you how much nutrients your soil

807
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,880
can hold

808
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:52,320
which then also tells you if you have to

809
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:55,120
modify that

810
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:57,120
that ideal cation balance that we were

811
00:27:55,120 --> 00:28:00,559
talking about

812
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:02,720
and so when you have a tc above about an

813
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:03,600
eight it means you can hold

814
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:06,720
theoretically

815
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:08,640
enough nutrients in an extractable form

816
00:28:06,720 --> 00:28:09,760
for an entire year growing season for an

817
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,000
annual crop

818
00:28:09,760 --> 00:28:12,960
generally speaking if you're below a tc

819
00:28:12,000 --> 00:28:15,200
of eight

820
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:16,240
it will mean that organic matter becomes

821
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:19,039
more important for you

822
00:28:16,240 --> 00:28:20,480
because you are able to hold fewer

823
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,399
minerals on your

824
00:28:20,480 --> 00:28:27,120
clay colloid

825
00:28:24,399 --> 00:28:27,840
and so that's something to keep in mind

826
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,120
so

827
00:28:27,840 --> 00:28:31,200
organic matter is always great you

828
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:32,720
always want to work on that the best way

829
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:35,200
to get good organic matter

830
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,919
is to grow healthy crops we'll talk

831
00:28:35,200 --> 00:28:38,480
about that

832
00:28:35,919 --> 00:28:40,080
later in terms of the chicken and the

833
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:41,600
egg problem of

834
00:28:40,080 --> 00:28:44,559
growing healthy crops when you don't

835
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,320
already have healthy soil but um

836
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,159
for now what you need to know is that if

837
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:49,600
you're above eight

838
00:28:48,159 --> 00:28:51,600
you're pretty good if you're above 10

839
00:28:49,600 --> 00:28:54,799
you're definitely pretty solid in terms

840
00:28:51,600 --> 00:28:54,799
of being able to hold your nutrients

841
00:28:55,279 --> 00:28:58,880
and that gets important when you start

842
00:28:57,200 --> 00:29:01,360
talking about the back we're

843
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:04,080
going to skip down here a little bit the

844
00:29:01,360 --> 00:29:06,399
most important thing after tc

845
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:08,720
is looking at the base saturation

846
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:12,240
percent numbers which is in the middle

847
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:14,240
gray area of your soil test

848
00:29:12,240 --> 00:29:15,840
and there you can see numbers on that

849
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,240
first one 59

850
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:19,200
and 32 and this is where you want to pay

851
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:21,279
attention to

852
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:22,480
the recommended base saturation percent

853
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:26,080
numbers

854
00:29:22,480 --> 00:29:28,880
so basically for base saturation

855
00:29:26,080 --> 00:29:30,080
of calcium you're looking for 60 to 68

856
00:29:28,880 --> 00:29:32,640
percent

857
00:29:30,080 --> 00:29:33,520
magnesium is 12 to 20 potassium's three

858
00:29:32,640 --> 00:29:36,240
to six

859
00:29:33,520 --> 00:29:38,320
sodium is point five to three and so if

860
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:42,159
you look at that first one you've got

861
00:29:38,320 --> 00:29:45,840
59 calcium 32 magnesium 3

862
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:49,279
potassium 1 a little bit more of sodium

863
00:29:45,840 --> 00:29:52,559
so right away this is

864
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:55,520
basically how i assess soil

865
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:57,919
testing services laboratories uh if they

866
00:29:55,520 --> 00:29:59,520
claim to do this type of soil test

867
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:01,760
where they're actually interested in

868
00:29:59,520 --> 00:30:01,760
base

869
00:30:03,200 --> 00:30:06,320
base saturation cation balancing and

870
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:07,600
they don't

871
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:10,399
they either don't give you this

872
00:30:07,600 --> 00:30:11,600
percentage or the percentages don't make

873
00:30:10,399 --> 00:30:13,679
sense when you actually look at the

874
00:30:11,600 --> 00:30:16,000
field and you know something's up

875
00:30:13,679 --> 00:30:17,760
but in this particular case you've got

876
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:20,880
low calcium and high magnesium

877
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
and what that does in soils is it makes

878
00:30:20,880 --> 00:30:22,880
the

879
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,480
clay particles stick together more

880
00:30:22,880 --> 00:30:27,440
closely it

881
00:30:24,480 --> 00:30:27,440
makes your soil

882
00:30:27,520 --> 00:30:34,480
slimy and kind of smear

883
00:30:30,960 --> 00:30:37,600
and this this is a 10.29 this particular

884
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:39,760
was not high in clay necessarily but

885
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,039
they described it as heavy placed oil

886
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:42,320
this is one of those little triggers

887
00:30:41,039 --> 00:30:43,679
every time someone describes your soil

888
00:30:42,320 --> 00:30:45,200
as have you played soil

889
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:47,360
i say what's your base saturation

890
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:50,240
magnesium and

891
00:30:47,360 --> 00:30:51,279
nine plus times out of ten it is higher

892
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:54,240
than it's supposed to be

893
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:54,799
usually by a lot and this is one example

894
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,039
of that

895
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,360
being true so the magnesium acts to

896
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,360
actually

897
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:04,880
stick the soil together more tightly and

898
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,279
what that does is it makes act like clay

899
00:31:04,880 --> 00:31:08,720
uh or what we think of this cloud it

900
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,480
reduces the porous

901
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,120
pore spaces where there's oxygen where

902
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:16,159
there's air it reduces the

903
00:31:13,120 --> 00:31:18,399
rate of influx of water

904
00:31:16,159 --> 00:31:20,880
basically it causes an awful lot of it

905
00:31:18,399 --> 00:31:24,000
causes compaction or it causes

906
00:31:20,880 --> 00:31:25,519
recompaction very quickly and it causes

907
00:31:24,000 --> 00:31:26,799
it actually traps minerals so when you

908
00:31:25,519 --> 00:31:29,120
have high magnesium

909
00:31:26,799 --> 00:31:31,120
you can actually get potassium gets

910
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,039
trapped in the layers of clay

911
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:35,279
and even though it may show up on your

912
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,960
soil test

913
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:39,360
when your plants really need it it may

914
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:41,279
not be available to them

915
00:31:39,360 --> 00:31:44,960
in the amount that you think you might

916
00:31:41,279 --> 00:31:49,279
have so in this particular case

917
00:31:44,960 --> 00:31:52,399
this garden was exhibiting uh it had uh

918
00:31:49,279 --> 00:31:54,960
prone to root diseases it had poor uh

919
00:31:52,399 --> 00:31:56,080
soil soil flocculation so like it wasn't

920
00:31:54,960 --> 00:31:57,600
really crumbly like you've ever seen

921
00:31:56,080 --> 00:32:00,559
really nice crumbly soil

922
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,000
um that's a well flocculated soil you

923
00:32:00,559 --> 00:32:03,519
can get that a lot easier if you have a

924
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:04,720
good calcium magnesium balance they

925
00:32:03,519 --> 00:32:07,360
didn't have that here

926
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,960
they had potassium deficiency symptoms

927
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:11,440
far excess of one of three

928
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,039
might indicate normally on a soil test

929
00:32:11,440 --> 00:32:15,840
uh and that was because the magnesium

930
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,679
was blocking uptake of potassium

931
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:19,039
and if you read i didn't mention it

932
00:32:17,679 --> 00:32:20,559
before but there are several really good

933
00:32:19,039 --> 00:32:23,279
books i recommend on this

934
00:32:20,559 --> 00:32:25,600
one is um the ideal soil by michael

935
00:32:23,279 --> 00:32:28,399
astaire that's probably the easiest one

936
00:32:25,600 --> 00:32:29,600
to digest as a beginner and then there's

937
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,399
sort of the

938
00:32:29,600 --> 00:32:35,200
bible for this which would be in my mind

939
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:38,640
neil kinsey's

940
00:32:35,200 --> 00:32:42,000
neil kinsey's book hands-on agronomy and

941
00:32:38,640 --> 00:32:45,519
in that book he goes through a whole

942
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:47,840
slew of examples of many examples

943
00:32:45,519 --> 00:32:49,120
of of all the different interactions

944
00:32:47,840 --> 00:32:51,760
between these elements so what

945
00:32:49,120 --> 00:32:52,880
i just mentioned one high magnesium ties

946
00:32:51,760 --> 00:32:55,760
up potassium

947
00:32:52,880 --> 00:32:57,519
that's one example uh another one behind

948
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,279
nitrogen ties up potassium

949
00:32:57,519 --> 00:33:00,799
uh high phosphorus times up zinc

950
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:02,880
hydrogen phosphorus

951
00:33:00,799 --> 00:33:04,320
these are things that are in um hands-on

952
00:33:02,880 --> 00:33:06,320
agronomy that

953
00:33:04,320 --> 00:33:09,519
really are really valuable when you're

954
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:12,720
trying to understand your soil system

955
00:33:09,519 --> 00:33:13,919
and so when you have when you're looking

956
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:15,760
at soils that's the first thing you want

957
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:18,320
to look for is you go down through

958
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,919
you highlight anything that's deficient

959
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:21,519
and he's below your target

960
00:33:19,919 --> 00:33:23,760
highlight preferably a different color

961
00:33:21,519 --> 00:33:24,399
anything that's excessive so above your

962
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:25,440
target

963
00:33:24,399 --> 00:33:28,000
and that's where you really want to

964
00:33:25,440 --> 00:33:29,600
focus your effort and try to

965
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:31,120
tease out what the things are that you

966
00:33:29,600 --> 00:33:34,880
need to work on

967
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:37,600
and so cation base saturation

968
00:33:34,880 --> 00:33:38,720
percents that's the that's the first

969
00:33:37,600 --> 00:33:40,960
place you look if you have a big

970
00:33:38,720 --> 00:33:44,080
imbalance between magnesium

971
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:46,000
calcium potassium and sodium that's has

972
00:33:44,080 --> 00:33:47,279
a huge impact

973
00:33:46,000 --> 00:33:49,120
the nice thing is it's one of the

974
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,600
easiest things to fix so say you're

975
00:33:49,120 --> 00:33:52,960
low in calcium you need usually a high

976
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:56,080
calcium limestone

977
00:33:52,960 --> 00:33:56,720
or gypsum if you're excessive in

978
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,880
something like

979
00:33:56,720 --> 00:34:00,640
magnesium gypsum is often best because

980
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,640
gypsum helps to

981
00:34:00,640 --> 00:34:03,840
break up that the bond between the

982
00:34:02,640 --> 00:34:07,840
magnesium and the

983
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:10,480
soil colloids split that magnesium off

984
00:34:07,840 --> 00:34:12,240
uh and replace it with the calcium so

985
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:16,560
gypsum is good when you have excess

986
00:34:12,240 --> 00:34:18,240
of something other than calcium um

987
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:20,560
and so those are the first places to

988
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:23,679
look there the other thing

989
00:34:20,560 --> 00:34:24,960
um at the far right side is this test

990
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,320
called salem

991
00:34:24,960 --> 00:34:28,159
and this is something that most people

992
00:34:26,320 --> 00:34:29,760
in new england i don't think

993
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,839
have seen where you have excessive

994
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,399
calcium i've seen it sometimes when

995
00:34:31,839 --> 00:34:34,079
people are

996
00:34:32,399 --> 00:34:36,800
adding compost that they add a lot of

997
00:34:34,079 --> 00:34:39,119
egg shells to a lot of limestone too

998
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:41,119
and in that particular case you can also

999
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:43,440
have the same kind of problem you have

1000
00:34:41,119 --> 00:34:44,320
uh you decrease potassium availability

1001
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,839
so

1002
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:50,800
you need to try to get it within the

1003
00:34:46,839 --> 00:34:50,800
targets you try to um

1004
00:34:52,560 --> 00:34:57,280
try to address the

1005
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,119
deficiencies by adding things and then

1006
00:34:57,280 --> 00:35:00,720
with the excesses that's a little bit

1007
00:34:59,119 --> 00:35:02,240
trickier and i'll talk about that in

1008
00:35:00,720 --> 00:35:03,440
just a few minutes i want to get to the

1009
00:35:02,240 --> 00:35:05,440
back to the

1010
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:06,960
the top of the sheet i'm just going to

1011
00:35:05,440 --> 00:35:09,440
run through how i do it

1012
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,400
uh when i'm looking at these so you've

1013
00:35:09,440 --> 00:35:12,000
identified your

1014
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:14,240
your deficiencies you looked at your

1015
00:35:12,000 --> 00:35:16,400
excesses so

1016
00:35:14,240 --> 00:35:17,440
looking at sulfur this is one that is

1017
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:19,599
almost always

1018
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:21,680
deficient unless you've been adding lots

1019
00:35:19,599 --> 00:35:24,480
of sulfur for many years or you live

1020
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:25,280
in some place uh that has sulfur vines

1021
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:26,560
which is

1022
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,119
as far as i don't know where east of the

1023
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:30,240
mississippi river um so this one's 14

1024
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:33,119
parts per million

1025
00:35:30,240 --> 00:35:33,599
sulfur the target is 75 parts per

1026
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:36,000
million

1027
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:37,280
sulfur and so here we go to some math

1028
00:35:36,000 --> 00:35:38,400
and i forgot to warn people there would

1029
00:35:37,280 --> 00:35:42,079
be a little bit of math

1030
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:45,839
um so you take 75

1031
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:47,040
you or in well let me back up

1032
00:35:45,839 --> 00:35:49,520
when you're really low you don't want to

1033
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:51,359
do everything at once

1034
00:35:49,520 --> 00:35:53,520
that's an important thing that i haven't

1035
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:56,640
mentioned um

1036
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:58,160
often times so a lot of the arguments

1037
00:35:56,640 --> 00:36:00,079
against using minerals

1038
00:35:58,160 --> 00:36:02,480
is that they kill soil life but they can

1039
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:04,320
actually negatively impact the biology

1040
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:06,079
and to some degree that's definitely

1041
00:36:04,320 --> 00:36:07,119
true everything you do every step you

1042
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:09,920
take in a field

1043
00:36:07,119 --> 00:36:12,160
every element you add does kill soil but

1044
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:12,960
it also creates conditions where other

1045
00:36:12,160 --> 00:36:14,960
life can live

1046
00:36:12,960 --> 00:36:17,359
and potentially increase the diversity

1047
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:20,000
and how healthy that life is

1048
00:36:17,359 --> 00:36:21,680
so in the case of sulfur if you're like

1049
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:24,160
a 14 in this case or

1050
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:25,760
20 i like to target 50 parts per million

1051
00:36:24,160 --> 00:36:28,480
that's the beginning of good

1052
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:30,400
75 would be considered sort of excellent

1053
00:36:28,480 --> 00:36:33,680
so if you're targeting 50 you take

1054
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:36,640
the 14 parts per million you subtract

1055
00:36:33,680 --> 00:36:39,760
your take 50 subtract 14. so you need 36

1056
00:36:36,640 --> 00:36:41,680
parts per million sulfur and

1057
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,760
to get to from part per million to

1058
00:36:41,680 --> 00:36:45,920
pounds per acre you multiply by two

1059
00:36:43,760 --> 00:36:47,599
so you have 36 you multiply that by two

1060
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,280
you have 72

1061
00:36:47,599 --> 00:36:50,880
and then you have to divide that by the

1062
00:36:49,280 --> 00:36:52,000
amount of sulfur in the material you're

1063
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:53,359
at

1064
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:56,160
and here's another point where people

1065
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:56,160
get very confused

1066
00:36:58,320 --> 00:37:02,240
i think that's 50 minus 14

1067
00:37:03,680 --> 00:37:07,440
i've been here so the fifth sorry yes

1068
00:37:06,800 --> 00:37:09,280
the 50

1069
00:37:07,440 --> 00:37:10,640
yes that's because i wrote 75 and i

1070
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:13,760
didn't write 50.

1071
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:17,280
50 is the minimum target 75

1072
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:18,000
is the ideal target it is not on there

1073
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:21,119
because

1074
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:21,119
i screwed up

1075
00:37:21,359 --> 00:37:27,200
is the minimum target like for good and

1076
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:28,960
75 is ideal

1077
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,560
um and so then once you get once you

1078
00:37:28,960 --> 00:37:33,200
figure out you're taking your

1079
00:37:30,560 --> 00:37:33,760
your target you subtract what you have

1080
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:36,880
so

1081
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:39,520
15 minus 14. you get 36

1082
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:40,400
you multiply it by 2 to get pounds per

1083
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:43,760
acre

1084
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:49,119
so you get 72 and then you divide that

1085
00:37:43,760 --> 00:37:51,280
by in 0.9 or whatever the

1086
00:37:49,119 --> 00:37:53,520
composition of the material you have is

1087
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:55,280
so if you're using elemental sulfur

1088
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,040
which is my preferred method of adding

1089
00:37:55,280 --> 00:38:00,880
sulfur and i'll tell you why in a minute

1090
00:37:57,040 --> 00:38:03,599
it's 90 sulfur so 90 0.9

1091
00:38:00,880 --> 00:38:04,640
so you take the 72 that you got before

1092
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,839
and you divide it by

1093
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:09,440
0.9 and you get

1094
00:38:07,839 --> 00:38:11,760
let me write this down somewhere in the

1095
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,160
neighborhood of 80-ish

1096
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:15,359
pounds of elemental sulfur so you need

1097
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:18,240
to add 80 pounds

1098
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:19,680
elemental sulfur to get you from 14 to

1099
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:21,359
50.

1100
00:38:19,680 --> 00:38:23,680
and that's in a perfect world we do not

1101
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,920
live in one of those so you'll add that

1102
00:38:23,680 --> 00:38:27,359
and you will not get to 50 you will get

1103
00:38:25,920 --> 00:38:30,320
to something else

1104
00:38:27,359 --> 00:38:31,680
usually with sulfur there is such a need

1105
00:38:30,320 --> 00:38:34,240
for it in the systems

1106
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:35,920
that you will put 50 down or you'll put

1107
00:38:34,240 --> 00:38:38,000
you know 80 pounds down

1108
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:39,599
should be enough to get to 50 but you

1109
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:41,440
won't get there you'll come up somewhere

1110
00:38:39,599 --> 00:38:44,720
short

1111
00:38:41,440 --> 00:38:46,800
um don't fret about that the sulfur

1112
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:48,800
didn't just go away what it probably did

1113
00:38:46,800 --> 00:38:50,160
is went to fixing some other aspect of

1114
00:38:48,800 --> 00:38:51,760
your soil system so

1115
00:38:50,160 --> 00:38:53,839
when you have an excess light in excess

1116
00:38:51,760 --> 00:38:56,400
of magnesium like in the soil

1117
00:38:53,839 --> 00:38:57,599
um some of that sulfur is going to go to

1118
00:38:56,400 --> 00:39:00,240
fixing the excess

1119
00:38:57,599 --> 00:39:01,520
so when you add when you have an excess

1120
00:39:00,240 --> 00:39:03,599
of a cation

1121
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:04,560
sulfur helps to get rid of that excess

1122
00:39:03,599 --> 00:39:07,280
it helps to strip

1123
00:39:04,560 --> 00:39:08,000
that element off the soil colloid and

1124
00:39:07,280 --> 00:39:09,680
make it

1125
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,200
and flush it out of the system making

1126
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:13,119
space for other things

1127
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:14,480
so a lot of that sulfur is going to go

1128
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:16,079
to that and so

1129
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:18,160
i would always i would round up to about

1130
00:39:16,079 --> 00:39:20,079
100 pounds of sulfur on this

1131
00:39:18,160 --> 00:39:21,680
instead of the 80 and that will give you

1132
00:39:20,079 --> 00:39:24,320
a little bit more but

1133
00:39:21,680 --> 00:39:25,839
honestly this soil will take probably

1134
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:28,240
three years of adding that to get enough

1135
00:39:25,839 --> 00:39:28,240
sulfur

1136
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,119
the sulfur doesn't go where you think

1137
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:38,880
it's going to yeah

1138
00:39:35,119 --> 00:39:41,440
yeah so there's basically a big

1139
00:39:38,880 --> 00:39:42,480
sulphur sink in your soil it's going

1140
00:39:41,440 --> 00:39:45,280
into the it's going

1141
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:46,480
to attach itself to the magnesium that's

1142
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:48,240
excessive

1143
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,720
to help remove it from the system

1144
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,320
because in reality

1145
00:39:50,720 --> 00:39:53,760
the idea of soil balance isn't just

1146
00:39:52,320 --> 00:39:56,640
ideal because we think it works

1147
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:58,320
the best it actually the soil almost

1148
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:01,280
seems to want to

1149
00:39:58,320 --> 00:40:03,119
approach that balance on its own so when

1150
00:40:01,280 --> 00:40:05,520
we actually have a sulfur

1151
00:40:03,119 --> 00:40:07,119
the soil system it's not necessarily

1152
00:40:05,520 --> 00:40:09,119
intelligent but it uh

1153
00:40:07,119 --> 00:40:10,880
certainly acts that way it'll the sulfur

1154
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:12,960
will attach to the most excessive

1155
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:14,960
cation and it will remove it from the

1156
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:17,280
soil the clay

1157
00:40:14,960 --> 00:40:18,800
which will make the space you need for

1158
00:40:17,280 --> 00:40:20,560
the things that are deficient

1159
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,480
so it'll make the space you need for the

1160
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:24,480
calcium or the potassium or whatever

1161
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,079
and the magnesium will flush out to the

1162
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:29,200
soil and

1163
00:40:26,079 --> 00:40:31,280
um and you'll lose it that way

1164
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:33,760
basically it'll still be there available

1165
00:40:31,280 --> 00:40:34,960
to plants as a fertilizer element and

1166
00:40:33,760 --> 00:40:37,839
sulfur is extremely

1167
00:40:34,960 --> 00:40:39,520
vital to plant health and human health

1168
00:40:37,839 --> 00:40:40,079
but you won't show up on the soil test

1169
00:40:39,520 --> 00:40:42,240
until

1170
00:40:40,079 --> 00:40:44,480
you've addressed until it has basically

1171
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:47,520
worked on all of those excesses

1172
00:40:44,480 --> 00:40:50,319
so it um it's one of those things that

1173
00:40:47,520 --> 00:40:51,119
triggers i get a lot so many calls about

1174
00:40:50,319 --> 00:40:54,240
sulfur it's

1175
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:56,400
crazy the other piece about sulfur

1176
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:57,520
is people don't don't understand this

1177
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:01,200
but

1178
00:40:57,520 --> 00:41:04,240
um sulfate is not the same as sulfur

1179
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:06,160
sulfate is an oxidized sulfur and

1180
00:41:04,240 --> 00:41:08,560
when it is in sulfate form it is a

1181
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:11,280
water-soluble form of sulfur

1182
00:41:08,560 --> 00:41:13,119
and it does not act the same it will

1183
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,960
quickly leach out of your system

1184
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:16,160
it doesn't really build sulfur on your

1185
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,359
soil test it will help

1186
00:41:16,160 --> 00:41:20,960
feed a crop sulfur and but it will not

1187
00:41:19,359 --> 00:41:23,200
stick around sulfur to

1188
00:41:20,960 --> 00:41:24,960
be transferred from sulfur to a plant

1189
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,560
available water soluble form takes

1190
00:41:24,960 --> 00:41:28,640
something like 56

1191
00:41:26,560 --> 00:41:30,000
biological sort of steps and processes

1192
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,560
biochemical steps

1193
00:41:30,000 --> 00:41:34,000
and so each one of those there's things

1194
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:35,839
in the soil that will grab a hold of it

1195
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:37,520
there's bacteria that will chelate it

1196
00:41:35,839 --> 00:41:38,880
which means bind it up into organic

1197
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:41,440
compounds and it will

1198
00:41:38,880 --> 00:41:42,560
help to keep it around a lot longer so a

1199
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:44,319
lot of people like i don't want to use

1200
00:41:42,560 --> 00:41:46,400
elements of sulfur it's super acidic it

1201
00:41:44,319 --> 00:41:48,000
kills microbes sure yeah it does

1202
00:41:46,400 --> 00:41:49,760
every microbe within maybe a quarter

1203
00:41:48,000 --> 00:41:51,200
inch of each little pellet is probably

1204
00:41:49,760 --> 00:41:53,520
going to be dead

1205
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:54,400
but when you actually spread 100 pounds

1206
00:41:53,520 --> 00:41:57,040
of sulfur over an

1207
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:57,920
acre of ground i do everything by the

1208
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:00,880
acre that's how my

1209
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:02,000
mind works but when you do that you put

1210
00:42:00,880 --> 00:42:03,839
100 pounds per acre

1211
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:05,520
the pellets are about maybe this far

1212
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,960
apart and

1213
00:42:05,520 --> 00:42:08,720
they're only going to impact the biology

1214
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:10,400
in that little quarter inch

1215
00:42:08,720 --> 00:42:12,480
around it you've got six inches or more

1216
00:42:10,400 --> 00:42:13,359
of soil below it so you're killing yes

1217
00:42:12,480 --> 00:42:14,960
you're killing microbes but you're

1218
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,240
killing microbes on a tiny fraction of

1219
00:42:14,960 --> 00:42:17,680
your total soil

1220
00:42:16,240 --> 00:42:19,280
and you're adding the things that are

1221
00:42:17,680 --> 00:42:20,079
holding back your system and functioning

1222
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:21,440
better

1223
00:42:20,079 --> 00:42:23,760
the things that are holding your system

1224
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:25,440
back from more efficiently building soil

1225
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:27,200
uh in a lot of cases sulfur is one of

1226
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,839
the top ones

1227
00:42:27,200 --> 00:42:33,040
and until you can address it you're not

1228
00:42:29,839 --> 00:42:33,040
working as efficiently as you can

1229
00:42:34,480 --> 00:42:38,400
so can i ask you another question sure

1230
00:42:36,240 --> 00:42:41,520
certainly uh all right so this first

1231
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:42,240
quick one is the 72 times 0.9 you're

1232
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:44,640
saying

1233
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:44,640
why is it

1234
00:42:46,000 --> 00:42:52,240
and um is there a

1235
00:42:49,680 --> 00:42:53,119
chart that shows kind of like a standard

1236
00:42:52,240 --> 00:42:56,839
uh

1237
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:59,839
let's say like elemental sulfur it's 90

1238
00:42:56,839 --> 00:42:59,839
percent

1239
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:05,680
they are online i can quickly i could

1240
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:07,440
also i can give a list

1241
00:43:05,680 --> 00:43:08,720
maybe remind me at the end and if we

1242
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:09,599
still have time i'll give you a list

1243
00:43:08,720 --> 00:43:12,319
verbally and

1244
00:43:09,599 --> 00:43:13,440
they are available even google them is a

1245
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:15,760
good way to

1246
00:43:13,440 --> 00:43:17,839
search online also keep in mind that

1247
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:20,720
every material you might buy

1248
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,520
may be a different number so always

1249
00:43:20,720 --> 00:43:23,680
check the bag

1250
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:25,200
or the source of what you're using you

1251
00:43:23,680 --> 00:43:26,480
can get a lot of trouble doing that with

1252
00:43:25,200 --> 00:43:27,599
trace elements especially if you're

1253
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:30,160
assuming it's

1254
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:31,760
five percent but it's actually 39 that's

1255
00:43:30,160 --> 00:43:34,560
a molybdenum example

1256
00:43:31,760 --> 00:43:36,079
for instance um you always check the bag

1257
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:37,440
of music

1258
00:43:36,079 --> 00:43:40,000
is there one more another question back

1259
00:43:37,440 --> 00:43:41,680
there yeah can you explain the why

1260
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:43,599
as far as these targets go but it only

1261
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:47,599
works in the local lab versus

1262
00:43:43,599 --> 00:43:50,000
yes thanks for bringing that up and um

1263
00:43:47,599 --> 00:43:51,520
so loganlab does this very specific test

1264
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:54,800
basically what they're looking at when

1265
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:54,800
they give you a base center

1266
00:43:56,400 --> 00:44:00,240
is that they're looking for extractable

1267
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:02,319
minerals

1268
00:44:00,240 --> 00:44:03,520
they're not looking for water soluble

1269
00:44:02,319 --> 00:44:04,480
and they're not looking at total

1270
00:44:03,520 --> 00:44:06,240
elemental

1271
00:44:04,480 --> 00:44:08,079
so our total elements will be like

1272
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:10,480
everything that's in your soil like a

1273
00:44:08,079 --> 00:44:12,640
geological assessment every element

1274
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:14,720
um and water soluble is what it sounds

1275
00:44:12,640 --> 00:44:15,680
like it's the water soluble nutrients in

1276
00:44:14,720 --> 00:44:18,240
solution

1277
00:44:15,680 --> 00:44:19,200
um that you can get out of your soil

1278
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,359
their test is an

1279
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:23,440
extractable so it assumes that you have

1280
00:44:21,359 --> 00:44:26,000
some biology it assumes you have

1281
00:44:23,440 --> 00:44:26,720
a system that's working together they

1282
00:44:26,000 --> 00:44:28,560
use different

1283
00:44:26,720 --> 00:44:29,920
acids basically to break some things

1284
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,079
apart so

1285
00:44:29,920 --> 00:44:34,000
the number will be higher and water

1286
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:35,200
soluble but less than the total

1287
00:44:34,000 --> 00:44:36,880
elemental

1288
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:39,280
and every lab does that test a little

1289
00:44:36,880 --> 00:44:40,880
differently and

1290
00:44:39,280 --> 00:44:42,400
the reason we can't apply the same

1291
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:45,119
numbers is because

1292
00:44:42,400 --> 00:44:46,960
many labs over the years have to cut

1293
00:44:45,119 --> 00:44:50,079
costs and save time etc

1294
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:53,119
have changed how they do that

1295
00:44:50,079 --> 00:44:54,880
many of the labs don't necessarily know

1296
00:44:53,119 --> 00:44:56,160
how to use these numbers the way that

1297
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:59,760
i'm trying to teach

1298
00:44:56,160 --> 00:45:00,720
people to use them and so that they have

1299
00:44:59,760 --> 00:45:03,599
made

1300
00:45:00,720 --> 00:45:04,640
they've changed how they do it and the

1301
00:45:03,599 --> 00:45:06,480
numbers don't work out

1302
00:45:04,640 --> 00:45:08,800
the same anymore and that's why i also

1303
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:10,880
say it's not that this is the right way

1304
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:12,000
this is the way i know how to make it

1305
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:14,640
work

1306
00:45:12,000 --> 00:45:14,640
and um

1307
00:45:15,040 --> 00:45:18,640
and i guarantee you the numbers that you

1308
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:21,760
get on a load and lab test

1309
00:45:18,640 --> 00:45:22,880
are wrong in the sense that your plant

1310
00:45:21,760 --> 00:45:24,720
doesn't necessarily see

1311
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:26,720
exactly these numbers but that's not

1312
00:45:24,720 --> 00:45:27,280
really the point because the point is

1313
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:28,800
that

1314
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:30,640
when you when these numbers are

1315
00:45:28,800 --> 00:45:31,119
approximately where they're supposed to

1316
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:33,200
be

1317
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:35,280
the whole system actually does work

1318
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:38,640
better and it works better because

1319
00:45:35,280 --> 00:45:40,319
of the how calcium magnesium work

1320
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:41,359
together to change the structure the

1321
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,400
physical structure

1322
00:45:41,359 --> 00:45:46,960
the amount of air and water in your soil

1323
00:45:44,400 --> 00:45:48,960
the relative amounts of some of these

1324
00:45:46,960 --> 00:45:51,119
things are really important to

1325
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:52,640
which species of microbes are living or

1326
00:45:51,119 --> 00:45:55,200
not in your soil

1327
00:45:52,640 --> 00:45:56,800
and so that's why there's these general

1328
00:45:55,200 --> 00:45:58,160
recommendations they're not hard to fast

1329
00:45:56,800 --> 00:46:00,480
rules i don't want anyone to

1330
00:45:58,160 --> 00:46:01,599
leave here thinking that they need to

1331
00:46:00,480 --> 00:46:04,079
like farm to a

1332
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:04,800
soil test it's a good way to throw money

1333
00:46:04,079 --> 00:46:08,640
away

1334
00:46:04,800 --> 00:46:10,800
um but they are a good place to start

1335
00:46:08,640 --> 00:46:12,560
and so if you have major imbalances like

1336
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:14,000
what some of these are on the soil test

1337
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,119
those major imbalances are going to

1338
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:17,520
point you in a direction it's going to

1339
00:46:15,119 --> 00:46:20,560
be helpful for you to make decisions

1340
00:46:17,520 --> 00:46:21,920
um sometimes

1341
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:23,920
you'll see something that's out of whack

1342
00:46:21,920 --> 00:46:25,680
in your soil tests but you

1343
00:46:23,920 --> 00:46:28,160
won't actually do anything about it you

1344
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:29,440
know i have high phosphorus here

1345
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:30,400
all right so the biggest thing you want

1346
00:46:29,440 --> 00:46:31,280
to look for when you have high

1347
00:46:30,400 --> 00:46:33,440
phosphorus

1348
00:46:31,280 --> 00:46:35,680
is where's my zinc because those are

1349
00:46:33,440 --> 00:46:38,319
that's a really tightly correlated

1350
00:46:35,680 --> 00:46:39,599
um nutrient system there so when you

1351
00:46:38,319 --> 00:46:41,359
high phosphorus

1352
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:43,200
it ties up zinc and when your eyes dig

1353
00:46:41,359 --> 00:46:44,720
it ties up phosphorus so when you apply

1354
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,800
phosphorus you want to make sure you

1355
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:49,200
also have um

1356
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:49,839
towards the higher end of sink so if you

1357
00:46:49,200 --> 00:46:51,920
look at

1358
00:46:49,839 --> 00:46:53,119
look down there zinc the recommendation

1359
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:54,720
is eight plus

1360
00:46:53,119 --> 00:46:56,319
and it's eight plus because when

1361
00:46:54,720 --> 00:46:58,160
phosphorus is much higher than it's

1362
00:46:56,319 --> 00:47:00,560
supposed to be as it is in this case

1363
00:46:58,160 --> 00:47:01,359
you actually need to double or maybe

1364
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,040
even a little more

1365
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:06,000
in your level of zinc to make sure that

1366
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:09,200
you can maintain zinc availability

1367
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:10,640
um so that's like that's how this works

1368
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:12,240
and why

1369
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,839
when you cut your corners and you make

1370
00:47:12,240 --> 00:47:14,960
it a little cheaper you make or you just

1371
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:16,480
change it because you think it's a

1372
00:47:14,960 --> 00:47:19,359
better way of doing it so

1373
00:47:16,480 --> 00:47:22,079
it no longer the ratios no longer work

1374
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:24,620
the relationships no longer work

1375
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,040
so that's a key point there

1376
00:47:24,620 --> 00:47:29,040
[Applause]

1377
00:47:27,040 --> 00:47:32,000
are you familiar with working with any

1378
00:47:29,040 --> 00:47:34,720
other lab reports like csi

1379
00:47:32,000 --> 00:47:35,200
so not particularly i've seen many of

1380
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,960
them

1381
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:38,480
um i've worked with some of them i've

1382
00:47:36,960 --> 00:47:41,680
talked to some of the people there

1383
00:47:38,480 --> 00:47:42,960
i mean there are good

1384
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:44,400
consultants and around us getting

1385
00:47:42,960 --> 00:47:45,280
results with a lot of different sort of

1386
00:47:44,400 --> 00:47:47,760
claps

1387
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:49,359
and so i'm just teaching you what you

1388
00:47:47,760 --> 00:47:50,559
can do on your this so one reason we

1389
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:52,480
like logan is it's not there

1390
00:47:50,559 --> 00:47:54,079
not very expensive and you don't have to

1391
00:47:52,480 --> 00:47:54,640
work with a consultant to use it so you

1392
00:47:54,079 --> 00:47:56,000
can

1393
00:47:54,640 --> 00:47:57,839
take serial tests yourself send them

1394
00:47:56,000 --> 00:47:58,720
there and get your results and then we

1395
00:47:57,839 --> 00:48:01,839
try to teach you

1396
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,880
how to interpret them yourself many

1397
00:48:01,839 --> 00:48:04,240
other labs you have to actually work

1398
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:05,760
with a consultant in order to even

1399
00:48:04,240 --> 00:48:06,960
access the lab

1400
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:08,319
so we're trying to we're trying to

1401
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:09,839
basically give you the tools to do it

1402
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:11,680
yourself

1403
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:14,079
and so that's a big reason why we've

1404
00:48:11,680 --> 00:48:14,079
done that

1405
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:19,359
i have an issue when i'm doing

1406
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:20,960
calculations

1407
00:48:19,359 --> 00:48:23,119
because i'm working with a lot of very

1408
00:48:20,960 --> 00:48:26,079
small spaces they're not any cars

1409
00:48:23,119 --> 00:48:27,520
right they're um you know hundreds of

1410
00:48:26,079 --> 00:48:30,880
square feet right

1411
00:48:27,520 --> 00:48:32,079
and i get really prolifed up in terms of

1412
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,920
where the decimal place

1413
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:38,559
is going when yeah so

1414
00:48:35,920 --> 00:48:40,160
so i'll just tell so when i look at it i

1415
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:43,520
think in terms of

1416
00:48:40,160 --> 00:48:45,839
in acres um

1417
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:46,640
a lot of them i like to start with acres

1418
00:48:45,839 --> 00:48:48,480
even if i'm

1419
00:48:46,640 --> 00:48:49,760
doing a thousand square feet i start i

1420
00:48:48,480 --> 00:48:53,280
can make all the recommendations

1421
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,880
in terms of acres and i divide by 43

1422
00:48:53,280 --> 00:48:56,400
and that gets you thousands per thousand

1423
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:57,839
square feet and if you need to go

1424
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,480
smaller than that it's pretty easy to

1425
00:48:57,839 --> 00:49:01,920
just

1426
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:03,440
lock off a decimal point or and uh to

1427
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:03,680
get a hundred square feet so that's how

1428
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:06,400
i

1429
00:49:03,680 --> 00:49:06,880
do it do it in acres divide by forty

1430
00:49:06,400 --> 00:49:09,119
three

1431
00:49:06,880 --> 00:49:10,400
thousand square feet and that is usually

1432
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:11,760
where people like to

1433
00:49:10,400 --> 00:49:13,520
like to end up and then when you start

1434
00:49:11,760 --> 00:49:15,359
really dividing it you're starting to

1435
00:49:13,520 --> 00:49:17,280
talk about tiny amounts and

1436
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:19,839
we can talk about that later if we have

1437
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,920
time about how you actually apply

1438
00:49:19,839 --> 00:49:24,079
a half an ounce of something yeah yeah

1439
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,079
yeah

1440
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:28,839
um how do you go about correcting this

1441
00:49:26,960 --> 00:49:32,160
um phosphorus

1442
00:49:28,839 --> 00:49:34,160
yeah yeah so um the first thing i want

1443
00:49:32,160 --> 00:49:34,640
to point out on phosphorus is that you

1444
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:36,720
may

1445
00:49:34,640 --> 00:49:37,839
notice that the numbers are different

1446
00:49:36,720 --> 00:49:40,800
between these two

1447
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:42,400
recommendations um and this is really

1448
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:44,160
another important point that i

1449
00:49:42,400 --> 00:49:46,160
kind of left it confusing like this for

1450
00:49:44,160 --> 00:49:47,599
a reason is to draw your attention to it

1451
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,800
remind you of this

1452
00:49:47,599 --> 00:49:50,800
these are in parts per million

1453
00:49:51,280 --> 00:49:55,520
if you look at this sheet you'll see

1454
00:49:53,680 --> 00:49:58,079
that it's in pounds per acre

1455
00:49:55,520 --> 00:49:58,880
it's my one biggest pet peeve with logan

1456
00:49:58,079 --> 00:50:00,319
labs

1457
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:01,839
is that sometimes you get your results

1458
00:50:00,319 --> 00:50:03,440
and parts familiar and sometimes you get

1459
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:06,160
a passport

1460
00:50:03,440 --> 00:50:07,599
and if you don't notice that you can

1461
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:09,280
kind of screw up your map a little bit

1462
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:11,119
so just i want to point that out

1463
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:13,119
it's a good opportunity to do that this

1464
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:15,440
particular one your phosphorus on here

1465
00:50:13,119 --> 00:50:16,960
is in pounds per acre so that's why

1466
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:20,319
there's the discrepancy

1467
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:24,960
um what that means in reality is that

1468
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:27,920
while it says you have 2427 on here

1469
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:28,800
thousand it's actually and thirteen or

1470
00:50:27,920 --> 00:50:30,960
fourteen

1471
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:32,000
um based on parts per minute but it's

1472
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:34,960
still high

1473
00:50:32,000 --> 00:50:35,440
obviously yeah um so there's a couple

1474
00:50:34,960 --> 00:50:38,319
things

1475
00:50:35,440 --> 00:50:38,720
um phosphorus is often high it's often

1476
00:50:38,319 --> 00:50:40,640
low

1477
00:50:38,720 --> 00:50:42,079
because there's a huge range in

1478
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,200
available phosphorus

1479
00:50:42,079 --> 00:50:46,880
um i constantly see people who've added

1480
00:50:45,200 --> 00:50:49,040
a ton of compost over the years

1481
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,000
who have astronomically high phosphorus

1482
00:50:49,040 --> 00:50:52,800
levels

1483
00:50:50,000 --> 00:50:53,520
and there's not anything like specific

1484
00:50:52,800 --> 00:50:56,720
you can do

1485
00:50:53,520 --> 00:50:57,599
to address that not necessarily even a

1486
00:50:56,720 --> 00:50:59,760
problem

1487
00:50:57,599 --> 00:51:01,040
if you can bring everything else up to

1488
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,880
an ideal level

1489
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:04,480
if you've got good phosphorus that's

1490
00:51:02,880 --> 00:51:05,680
actually an expensive thing to fix when

1491
00:51:04,480 --> 00:51:07,520
you're deficient

1492
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:09,440
so count yourself it's somewhat of a

1493
00:51:07,520 --> 00:51:11,200
blessing but you do have to

1494
00:51:09,440 --> 00:51:13,040
keep it in mind and work extra hard to

1495
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:16,800
bring everything else up because

1496
00:51:13,040 --> 00:51:18,079
um because if you have high phosphorus

1497
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:21,359
and you're deficient other things

1498
00:51:18,079 --> 00:51:23,359
that makes the high phosphorus worse

1499
00:51:21,359 --> 00:51:24,480
it doesn't does if that makes sense the

1500
00:51:23,359 --> 00:51:26,960
other thing is sometimes

1501
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:27,599
um the phosphor is a good example you

1502
00:51:26,960 --> 00:51:29,280
can have

1503
00:51:27,599 --> 00:51:30,800
other things that will tie it up so

1504
00:51:29,280 --> 00:51:34,480
phosphorus and calcium

1505
00:51:30,800 --> 00:51:35,280
uh tend to get along so well that they

1506
00:51:34,480 --> 00:51:38,160
don't like to

1507
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:40,240
ever split apart again and so when you

1508
00:51:38,160 --> 00:51:41,680
apply phosphorus adding

1509
00:51:40,240 --> 00:51:43,119
adding calcium sometimes you'll add a

1510
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,640
lot of calcium you think you're going to

1511
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,640
get your calcium where it needs to be

1512
00:51:44,640 --> 00:51:48,079
and it just won't show up but slowly

1513
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,280
your phosphorus will come down

1514
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:51,359
and that's because phosphorus and

1515
00:51:49,280 --> 00:51:51,680
calcium like to tie up in the mineral

1516
00:51:51,359 --> 00:51:54,880
called

1517
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:57,040
it's a appetite apatite rock it it

1518
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:58,559
basically turns back into a hard rock

1519
00:51:57,040 --> 00:52:00,720
and both of them become unavailable

1520
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:02,079
so one approach if you've got super high

1521
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:04,800
phosphorus is to add

1522
00:52:02,079 --> 00:52:05,359
um keep your calcium high keep your

1523
00:52:04,800 --> 00:52:07,920
calcium

1524
00:52:05,359 --> 00:52:09,280
available and it will slowly tie up some

1525
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:11,440
of that phosphorus

1526
00:52:09,280 --> 00:52:12,559
so that's one way to do that but again

1527
00:52:11,440 --> 00:52:14,720
really just

1528
00:52:12,559 --> 00:52:15,760
making sure when you have an excess in

1529
00:52:14,720 --> 00:52:18,079
in phosphorus

1530
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:19,839
and many other ones bring everything

1531
00:52:18,079 --> 00:52:21,760
else up to

1532
00:52:19,839 --> 00:52:24,960
the target that's the first thing to

1533
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:26,640
focus on um

1534
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:28,640
so hopefully that helps to answer that

1535
00:52:26,640 --> 00:52:31,599
question

1536
00:52:28,640 --> 00:52:33,280
find your you have 150 prosperous

1537
00:52:31,599 --> 00:52:34,480
up there you have 75

1538
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:36,240
right and that's the whole that's what i

1539
00:52:34,480 --> 00:52:37,119
was talking about with that's in parts

1540
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:39,280
per million

1541
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,599
and this one is in pounds per acre so

1542
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:43,119
the 150 right here over in that column

1543
00:52:41,599 --> 00:52:44,800
right that's pounds per acre

1544
00:52:43,119 --> 00:52:47,359
so that's the important consideration

1545
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:49,359
that first of all the math to go from

1546
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,720
one to the other is you multiply your

1547
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:52,800
parts per million times two

1548
00:52:50,720 --> 00:52:54,319
and that gets two pounds per acre that's

1549
00:52:52,800 --> 00:52:57,119
because they assume that an

1550
00:52:54,319 --> 00:52:58,800
acre of soil the top six inches of an

1551
00:52:57,119 --> 00:53:00,720
acre soil weighs two million pounds

1552
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:01,920
so if you want to like your math to make

1553
00:53:00,720 --> 00:53:03,280
sure that these numbers make sense

1554
00:53:01,920 --> 00:53:07,520
that's where it comes from

1555
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:11,680
um so yeah um and the phosphorus

1556
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:13,359
in the loading lab is about just p205

1557
00:53:11,680 --> 00:53:15,520
exactly yes i'm glad you mentioned that

1558
00:53:13,359 --> 00:53:19,119
so um

1559
00:53:15,520 --> 00:53:20,400
when when agronomists farmers

1560
00:53:19,119 --> 00:53:23,119
fertilizer sales people talk about

1561
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:25,359
phosphorus they're usually

1562
00:53:23,119 --> 00:53:26,720
basically always actually talking about

1563
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:29,359
phosphate

1564
00:53:26,720 --> 00:53:30,319
phosphate is what um they're actually

1565
00:53:29,359 --> 00:53:31,359
measuring what they're actually

1566
00:53:30,319 --> 00:53:32,880
concerned about

1567
00:53:31,359 --> 00:53:34,319
so it's not actually elemental

1568
00:53:32,880 --> 00:53:35,520
phosphorus that they're looking at but

1569
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:37,280
it's phosphate

1570
00:53:35,520 --> 00:53:38,559
um and it's you'll see that also when

1571
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:40,079
you start talking to people about

1572
00:53:38,559 --> 00:53:43,280
potassium they often say

1573
00:53:40,079 --> 00:53:46,079
potash potash would be um

1574
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,839
it's not actually potassium itself so

1575
00:53:46,079 --> 00:53:49,280
that that's something to keep in mind

1576
00:53:47,839 --> 00:53:51,359
the definitions in terms of an

1577
00:53:49,280 --> 00:53:53,040
agriculture versus actual chemistry if

1578
00:53:51,359 --> 00:53:54,559
there's chemists in the room

1579
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:56,720
or if there's chemicals who become

1580
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:58,960
farmers they're constantly frustrated by

1581
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:01,680
the fact that agriculture doesn't use

1582
00:53:58,960 --> 00:54:04,079
the real the right words

1583
00:54:01,680 --> 00:54:06,880
in quite a few examples so that's one of

1584
00:54:04,079 --> 00:54:06,880
them phosphorus

1585
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:15,119
um all right but the so that

1586
00:54:12,079 --> 00:54:17,200
75 ppm is for

1587
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:18,720
phosphate it's for phosphate and even

1588
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:19,839
though many labs were reported as

1589
00:54:18,720 --> 00:54:20,960
phosphorus

1590
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,839
i don't know if any of that are

1591
00:54:20,960 --> 00:54:24,240
measuring it as anything other than

1592
00:54:22,839 --> 00:54:27,680
phosphate

1593
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:31,359
um all right so

1594
00:54:27,680 --> 00:54:31,359
let's see where do i want to go next um

1595
00:54:32,800 --> 00:54:38,079
all right so there's so many nuances so

1596
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:41,200
this is another thing i want

1597
00:54:38,079 --> 00:54:41,200
i want to mention um

1598
00:54:41,839 --> 00:54:45,760
there's a lot of a lot of times when

1599
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:47,920
what people get messed up and why they

1600
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:49,680
really can't understand soil test

1601
00:54:47,920 --> 00:54:51,200
results why they get frustrated that

1602
00:54:49,680 --> 00:54:53,040
it doesn't make any sense is when they

1603
00:54:51,200 --> 00:54:55,359
do something and then it doesn't

1604
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:56,160
behave like they expect it to and often

1605
00:54:55,359 --> 00:55:00,000
that's because

1606
00:54:56,160 --> 00:55:02,160
there's the interrelationships between

1607
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:04,880
these elements is what screws them up

1608
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:06,160
so in the case of this is a good example

1609
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:07,920
a lot of people have this problem they

1610
00:55:06,160 --> 00:55:10,400
have low potassium

1611
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,160
and maybe they have high magnesium like

1612
00:55:10,400 --> 00:55:13,359
this first example their ph is above

1613
00:55:12,160 --> 00:55:15,280
seven

1614
00:55:13,359 --> 00:55:16,400
and when your ph is above seven things

1615
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:18,880
don't exactly work

1616
00:55:16,400 --> 00:55:19,520
the same as if they're lower than seven

1617
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:21,040
so

1618
00:55:19,520 --> 00:55:22,720
one of the things that happens is that

1619
00:55:21,040 --> 00:55:24,799
the soil when it has

1620
00:55:22,720 --> 00:55:26,079
when the pitch is above seven there's

1621
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:29,520
not much room

1622
00:55:26,079 --> 00:55:30,160
on that on that box on the soil box we

1623
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,319
look here

1624
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:33,520
it's full in fact not only is it full

1625
00:55:32,319 --> 00:55:35,200
but it's kind of got extra stuff

1626
00:55:33,520 --> 00:55:36,880
floating around it's not really attached

1627
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:39,200
but it's sort of attached

1628
00:55:36,880 --> 00:55:41,280
and so there's no room there so if you

1629
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:42,640
want to add something like calcium

1630
00:55:41,280 --> 00:55:44,319
the calcium is just going to like come

1631
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:46,240
in here and be like well there's no

1632
00:55:44,319 --> 00:55:47,599
place for me to go

1633
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:49,200
and that's why what i was mentioning

1634
00:55:47,599 --> 00:55:50,160
before sulfur is important the sulfur

1635
00:55:49,200 --> 00:55:52,559
helps to

1636
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:54,319
like say this in our example on the

1637
00:55:52,559 --> 00:55:55,200
sheet helps to cut this bond with

1638
00:55:54,319 --> 00:55:58,079
magnesium

1639
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,760
making room for calcium and the same

1640
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:02,319
thing happens with potassium so if you

1641
00:55:59,760 --> 00:56:03,200
in this soil your ph is above seven

1642
00:56:02,319 --> 00:56:05,839
there's no room

1643
00:56:03,200 --> 00:56:07,119
to add potassium to this and so until

1644
00:56:05,839 --> 00:56:09,520
you can get

1645
00:56:07,119 --> 00:56:11,520
calcium and sulfur and to start

1646
00:56:09,520 --> 00:56:13,040
splitting off your excesses

1647
00:56:11,520 --> 00:56:14,480
you're wasting money if you add any more

1648
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,480
potassium basically than what your

1649
00:56:14,480 --> 00:56:17,440
plants need that year so in this

1650
00:56:16,480 --> 00:56:21,119
particular example

1651
00:56:17,440 --> 00:56:23,280
you um there's a deficit if you look at

1652
00:56:21,119 --> 00:56:26,240
the exchangeable cations potassium

1653
00:56:23,280 --> 00:56:28,160
growth guesses are 75 pounds per acre of

1654
00:56:26,240 --> 00:56:30,559
potassium

1655
00:56:28,160 --> 00:56:33,040
and that's how much you need to bring

1656
00:56:30,559 --> 00:56:34,960
your soil test result to four percent

1657
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,400
but there's no room for 75 pounds of

1658
00:56:34,960 --> 00:56:39,280
potassium on here

1659
00:56:36,400 --> 00:56:41,599
and so what you would want to do is

1660
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,599
actually

1661
00:56:41,839 --> 00:56:45,920
trickle feed your crop to make sure the

1662
00:56:44,400 --> 00:56:49,119
crop has enough potassium

1663
00:56:45,920 --> 00:56:50,799
until you can fix your imbalances here

1664
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:51,839
get rid of the excess magnesium make

1665
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:53,520
space here

1666
00:56:51,839 --> 00:56:54,559
for the potassium otherwise you're

1667
00:56:53,520 --> 00:56:56,000
literally just throwing money away

1668
00:56:54,559 --> 00:56:58,079
because the potassium is going to go

1669
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:59,760
it's going to float up here so my god

1670
00:56:58,079 --> 00:57:02,160
it's full i'm gonna go over here

1671
00:56:59,760 --> 00:57:03,520
and it's gonna go down the stream into

1672
00:57:02,160 --> 00:57:06,799
rivers it's going to

1673
00:57:03,520 --> 00:57:09,520
um not not stick to your solar power

1674
00:57:06,799 --> 00:57:11,119
um furthermore and this is where we're

1675
00:57:09,520 --> 00:57:12,960
gonna start to talk about what lane you

1676
00:57:11,119 --> 00:57:14,720
who i think told a lot of you

1677
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
is that it's ridiculous to add minerals

1678
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:18,319
because there's tons already there

1679
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,920
and potassium is a great example there's

1680
00:57:18,319 --> 00:57:23,119
40 000 pounds

1681
00:57:19,920 --> 00:57:25,760
of potassium on average in every

1682
00:57:23,119 --> 00:57:27,760
acre of topsoil and that's just actually

1683
00:57:25,760 --> 00:57:28,880
the top six inches of topsoil forty

1684
00:57:27,760 --> 00:57:30,880
thousand minutes

1685
00:57:28,880 --> 00:57:32,880
and so it's a little bit ludicrous that

1686
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:36,160
we ever think to add potassium

1687
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:38,160
ever because there's tons there um

1688
00:57:36,160 --> 00:57:40,480
but having it there and having to build

1689
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:43,440
plants of incredibly different things

1690
00:57:40,480 --> 00:57:44,960
and it is true that biology will make

1691
00:57:43,440 --> 00:57:46,319
things available if you have excellent

1692
00:57:44,960 --> 00:57:47,599
excellent biology

1693
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:48,960
but the fact of that is it's really hard

1694
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:49,760
to good biology if you don't have good

1695
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:51,520
plants because then

1696
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:52,640
what's feeding the biology and it's

1697
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:54,000
really hard of good plants if you don't

1698
00:57:52,640 --> 00:57:56,480
have any potassium

1699
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:57,839
so that's why when i say on an example

1700
00:57:56,480 --> 00:57:59,920
like this where you have borderline

1701
00:57:57,839 --> 00:58:00,960
deficient potassium your magnesium is

1702
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:02,960
really high

1703
00:58:00,960 --> 00:58:04,799
so it's going to block the availability

1704
00:58:02,960 --> 00:58:06,799
of some of that potassium

1705
00:58:04,799 --> 00:58:08,799
if you're not adding some potassium that

1706
00:58:06,799 --> 00:58:11,119
you're going to have a really hard time

1707
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:12,880
to keep plants healthy enough to be

1708
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:13,680
putting carbon into the soil and feeding

1709
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:15,280
the microbes

1710
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:17,359
that are then going to unlock more

1711
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:17,760
potassium for you so by adding a little

1712
00:58:17,359 --> 00:58:20,319
bit

1713
00:58:17,760 --> 00:58:21,359
you can potentially unlock a lot and so

1714
00:58:20,319 --> 00:58:24,720
that's a key

1715
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:26,240
part of all of this to keep in mind

1716
00:58:24,720 --> 00:58:27,760
like i said earlier we're not trying to

1717
00:58:26,240 --> 00:58:30,079
get a perfect soil test

1718
00:58:27,760 --> 00:58:31,599
we're trying to build soil and one of

1719
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:32,319
the ways to do that is to make the metal

1720
00:58:31,599 --> 00:58:34,480
test

1721
00:58:32,319 --> 00:58:36,240
a little better try to tweak it as best

1722
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:37,920
we can so that we can unlock the

1723
00:58:36,240 --> 00:58:40,240
conditions for the biology to do the

1724
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:45,599
rest of the work for us

1725
00:58:40,240 --> 00:58:45,599
um so that's gonna make that point um

1726
00:58:46,000 --> 00:58:49,440
now i wanna talk a little bit about

1727
00:58:47,520 --> 00:58:52,400
trace elements before

1728
00:58:49,440 --> 00:58:54,319
i open up your questions um trace

1729
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:56,559
elements are something that

1730
00:58:54,319 --> 00:58:57,440
people get stuck on they can be very

1731
00:58:56,559 --> 00:58:59,280
difficult to

1732
00:58:57,440 --> 00:59:00,559
understand like how to get the materials

1733
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:02,960
out there um

1734
00:59:00,559 --> 00:59:04,079
we're dealing with tiny amounts uh in

1735
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:07,839
general

1736
00:59:04,079 --> 00:59:09,280
and um but

1737
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:10,880
a couple there's a couple things that

1738
00:59:09,280 --> 00:59:13,920
are pretty universal

1739
00:59:10,880 --> 00:59:14,640
unless you're from the rocky mountains

1740
00:59:13,920 --> 00:59:16,720
or points

1741
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,079
west you are unlikely to have enough

1742
00:59:16,720 --> 00:59:21,440
boron in your soil

1743
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:23,599
it's just a fact of geology

1744
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,440
if you have really really really good

1745
00:59:23,599 --> 00:59:26,000
biology you're going to find maybe be

1746
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:29,440
able to

1747
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:31,280
get enough for healthy plant growth but

1748
00:59:29,440 --> 00:59:34,240
to add the maximum yearly application of

1749
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:38,000
boron costs seven dollars an acre

1750
00:59:34,240 --> 00:59:40,559
boron is extremely important for moving

1751
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:42,319
elements up and down in plants and when

1752
00:59:40,559 --> 00:59:43,920
plants can't move elements up and down

1753
00:59:42,319 --> 00:59:45,280
it means that they run out of things

1754
00:59:43,920 --> 00:59:48,319
when they're growing quickly

1755
00:59:45,280 --> 00:59:49,760
which is invites disease which limits

1756
00:59:48,319 --> 00:59:51,280
photosynthetic efficiency

1757
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:52,799
and limits the amount of carbon they're

1758
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:54,240
able to put in the soil to feed the

1759
00:59:52,799 --> 00:59:56,400
microbes in the soil

1760
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:58,480
and so if you don't address these things

1761
00:59:56,400 --> 00:59:59,839
when you have a deficiency in boron

1762
00:59:58,480 --> 01:00:03,200
and you're just going to assume it's in

1763
00:59:59,839 --> 01:00:05,359
your sword and hope for the best

1764
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,640
you're not going to get the best you're

1765
01:00:05,359 --> 01:00:10,240
never going to get the best

1766
01:00:06,640 --> 01:00:11,680
um and so while you may not have to get

1767
01:00:10,240 --> 01:00:14,240
more and all the way to two or three

1768
01:00:11,680 --> 01:00:16,880
parts per million in the target i would

1769
01:00:14,240 --> 01:00:16,880
argue that

1770
01:00:17,280 --> 01:00:23,839
your mid

1771
01:00:20,720 --> 01:00:26,480
you're not well served to not add any

1772
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:26,480
and um

1773
01:00:26,960 --> 01:00:31,520
and anyway so yeah i just wanna

1774
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:33,520
you should add some boron if you're

1775
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:35,280
deficient in warm like

1776
01:00:33,520 --> 01:00:37,040
hands down i'll make that categorical

1777
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:39,680
statement um

1778
01:00:37,040 --> 01:00:41,040
you may not need to add all of it but

1779
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,960
it's yeah it's cheap

1780
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:44,240
um so to understand how much more you

1781
01:00:42,960 --> 01:00:45,760
can add

1782
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,520
every one of these things has a maximum

1783
01:00:45,760 --> 01:00:50,799
yearly application rate

1784
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:53,359
every element borons is low so you only

1785
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:56,480
have two pounds of actual form per acre

1786
01:00:53,359 --> 01:00:57,280
and if you're using a 10 boron that

1787
01:00:56,480 --> 01:00:58,960
would come through

1788
01:00:57,280 --> 01:01:01,280
20 pounds of product if you're using a

1789
01:00:58,960 --> 01:01:01,839
20 boron it's 10 pounds of product per

1790
01:01:01,280 --> 01:01:03,920
acre

1791
01:01:01,839 --> 01:01:06,160
so giant small amounts those small

1792
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:07,680
amounts make a tremendous impact

1793
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,839
which is also crazy when you think about

1794
01:01:07,680 --> 01:01:11,599
it because 10 pounds spread over an acre

1795
01:01:09,839 --> 01:01:14,720
is not very much stuff

1796
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:17,599
um but that's how you look at that

1797
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:19,200
um i don't we'll see if we get time to

1798
01:01:17,599 --> 01:01:20,319
go over the elements of where you get

1799
01:01:19,200 --> 01:01:22,319
these things but

1800
01:01:20,319 --> 01:01:24,880
um that's what you need to do for the

1801
01:01:22,319 --> 01:01:24,880
whole question

1802
01:01:34,319 --> 01:01:38,799
right so whether you need to or whether

1803
01:01:37,599 --> 01:01:39,520
you're just going to blend it into

1804
01:01:38,799 --> 01:01:40,880
something that

1805
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:42,880
isn't going to be isn't going to hurt

1806
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:44,720
you or it might be beneficial for other

1807
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:47,839
reasons so compost is a great one

1808
01:01:44,720 --> 01:01:49,599
and after compost you can add it to um

1809
01:01:47,839 --> 01:01:52,079
leaf mulch there's lots of ways if

1810
01:01:49,599 --> 01:01:52,079
you're doing it

1811
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,119
diluted water you can dissolve it you

1812
01:01:57,839 --> 01:02:01,359
can spray it on

1813
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:03,200
um i generally my recommendations are to

1814
01:02:01,359 --> 01:02:06,000
use granular whenever possible

1815
01:02:03,200 --> 01:02:06,640
by my my way of working it's a lot

1816
01:02:06,000 --> 01:02:08,160
easier

1817
01:02:06,640 --> 01:02:09,920
you can mix it with other granules you

1818
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:11,920
can spread them out easily

1819
01:02:09,920 --> 01:02:14,079
the granular stuff generally is a slower

1820
01:02:11,920 --> 01:02:17,599
release so you're less risk of burning

1821
01:02:14,079 --> 01:02:19,599
plants when you use water-soluble things

1822
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:21,599
you you really need to cut the rate of

1823
01:02:19,599 --> 01:02:22,480
application so i said two pounds of bond

1824
01:02:21,599 --> 01:02:24,880
per acre

1825
01:02:22,480 --> 01:02:26,720
per year but if you're using soluble and

1826
01:02:24,880 --> 01:02:29,520
you put all two pounds at once

1827
01:02:26,720 --> 01:02:30,400
you're liable to burn things like borax

1828
01:02:29,520 --> 01:02:32,480
right

1829
01:02:30,400 --> 01:02:34,079
yeah borax is one of those things that's

1830
01:02:32,480 --> 01:02:36,640
not as soluble as soluble

1831
01:02:34,079 --> 01:02:38,079
but it's soluble enough right and um if

1832
01:02:36,640 --> 01:02:40,240
you applied it all at once so if you

1833
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,960
applied all 15 pounds or so borax at

1834
01:02:40,240 --> 01:02:44,160
once

1835
01:02:40,960 --> 01:02:45,680
then you could burn things um

1836
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:47,440
and so what you'd want to do is divide

1837
01:02:45,680 --> 01:02:49,520
it into multiple smaller applications

1838
01:02:47,440 --> 01:02:51,520
maybe divided at least by three or four

1839
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:54,640
and apply those as your liquids

1840
01:02:51,520 --> 01:02:56,240
but it's not hard to add it to compost

1841
01:02:54,640 --> 01:02:57,760
in fact i like to when i'm making my

1842
01:02:56,240 --> 01:02:59,359
compost piles and things

1843
01:02:57,760 --> 01:03:00,720
add these minerals to it so if i take a

1844
01:02:59,359 --> 01:03:02,079
soil test i'm building compost the

1845
01:03:00,720 --> 01:03:03,039
compost is eventually going to add up on

1846
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,520
that soil

1847
01:03:03,039 --> 01:03:06,480
i add the elements to the compost that

1848
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:08,799
my soil needs

1849
01:03:06,480 --> 01:03:10,880
and it helps to digest them gets them

1850
01:03:08,799 --> 01:03:12,720
chelated in with organic compounds

1851
01:03:10,880 --> 01:03:14,960
and that's really important because many

1852
01:03:12,720 --> 01:03:17,920
of these things are

1853
01:03:14,960 --> 01:03:18,319
can be harsh on soil life um and so the

1854
01:03:17,920 --> 01:03:19,760
more

1855
01:03:18,319 --> 01:03:22,079
carbon that you can put out when you put

1856
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:24,640
them out it'll buffers that effect

1857
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:26,880
so you kill less microbes and it doesn't

1858
01:03:24,640 --> 01:03:30,000
have the harsh effects that

1859
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:31,440
people worry about so um but

1860
01:03:30,000 --> 01:03:33,440
basically so i've talked a little bit

1861
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:35,039
about how to do the sulfur math

1862
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:36,559
uh in terms of you take your target you

1863
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:39,200
take how much you

1864
01:03:36,559 --> 01:03:40,000
want uh to take your target take where

1865
01:03:39,200 --> 01:03:41,760
you are now

1866
01:03:40,000 --> 01:03:43,280
and then do the math in terms of parts

1867
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:44,799
and millions of pounds per acre

1868
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:46,400
and then you figure it out if you

1869
01:03:44,799 --> 01:03:47,839
actually do that math on most of the

1870
01:03:46,400 --> 01:03:50,240
trace elements so

1871
01:03:47,839 --> 01:03:52,960
you have 80 to 90 part parts per million

1872
01:03:50,240 --> 01:03:55,920
target say on manganese you have 31

1873
01:03:52,960 --> 01:03:56,799
you get 60 let's say um parts per

1874
01:03:55,920 --> 01:03:59,039
million deficient

1875
01:03:56,799 --> 01:04:01,280
multiplied by two to get pounds you get

1876
01:03:59,039 --> 01:04:02,799
120 pounds of manganese

1877
01:04:01,280 --> 01:04:04,400
if you did all that at once you would

1878
01:04:02,799 --> 01:04:07,280
burn everything and give everything

1879
01:04:04,400 --> 01:04:08,400
manganese toxicity so and all the trace

1880
01:04:07,280 --> 01:04:10,480
elements especially have to

1881
01:04:08,400 --> 01:04:12,319
take into consideration maximum yield

1882
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:15,119
application rates

1883
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,319
those are on the resource on the

1884
01:04:15,119 --> 01:04:19,440
resource page earlier

1885
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:19,440
i pointed to a um

1886
01:04:20,720 --> 01:04:24,799
um here it is so at these minerals on

1887
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:27,680
this page

1888
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:29,920
i need signing fcc literal targets has

1889
01:04:27,680 --> 01:04:32,240
the maximum yearly application rates

1890
01:04:29,920 --> 01:04:33,760
very important for the trace elements so

1891
01:04:32,240 --> 01:04:35,119
when you're doing your math

1892
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:36,559
have that sheet from you to make sure

1893
01:04:35,119 --> 01:04:41,839
that you don't do anything you're not

1894
01:04:36,559 --> 01:04:45,359
supposed to yeah

1895
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:46,960
yeah so the question is about

1896
01:04:45,359 --> 01:04:48,880
time of year when you should have

1897
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:50,640
different minerals

1898
01:04:48,880 --> 01:04:53,680
the general rule is you should add them

1899
01:04:50,640 --> 01:04:56,160
yesterday if you need them

1900
01:04:53,680 --> 01:04:57,520
but there are some things that are

1901
01:04:56,160 --> 01:04:58,720
better to do in the spring than some

1902
01:04:57,520 --> 01:05:00,720
better in the fall if it's a

1903
01:04:58,720 --> 01:05:01,520
water-soluble element you need to feed a

1904
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:03,599
crop so

1905
01:05:01,520 --> 01:05:04,960
in this example that i used before you

1906
01:05:03,599 --> 01:05:07,039
have a potassium

1907
01:05:04,960 --> 01:05:09,119
potential potassium deficiency issue

1908
01:05:07,039 --> 01:05:10,319
that you might come up on that first one

1909
01:05:09,119 --> 01:05:12,319
if you're trying to grow tomatoes or

1910
01:05:10,319 --> 01:05:13,599
something there especially

1911
01:05:12,319 --> 01:05:15,440
if you do in the fall you're going to

1912
01:05:13,599 --> 01:05:18,960
lose some bleaching over winter

1913
01:05:15,440 --> 01:05:20,000
essentially so you might want to do that

1914
01:05:18,960 --> 01:05:21,520
one in the spring or

1915
01:05:20,000 --> 01:05:23,039
during the growing season if you're

1916
01:05:21,520 --> 01:05:25,200
adding limestone

1917
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,400
uh you want to have that the winter time

1918
01:05:25,200 --> 01:05:28,480
helps to break it down

1919
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:29,520
so anytime you're adding rock dust rock

1920
01:05:28,480 --> 01:05:32,319
powder type of

1921
01:05:29,520 --> 01:05:34,000
material uh fall is a really good time

1922
01:05:32,319 --> 01:05:38,079
to use that winter

1923
01:05:34,000 --> 01:05:41,839
rest period um when it helps to unlock

1924
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:45,440
those the compounds from those materials

1925
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:47,680
um and then anything that's

1926
01:05:45,440 --> 01:05:49,039
leachable water soluble is best in the

1927
01:05:47,680 --> 01:05:50,559
spring when you have

1928
01:05:49,039 --> 01:05:52,720
a lot of biological activity that can

1929
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:54,240
chelate it or bind it up into organic

1930
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:56,720
molecules so it doesn't

1931
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:57,359
run away uh and leave your leave your

1932
01:05:56,720 --> 01:06:01,280
farm

1933
01:05:57,359 --> 01:06:04,240
so that would be like boron phosphates

1934
01:06:01,280 --> 01:06:06,079
sulfates would be a springtime thing

1935
01:06:04,240 --> 01:06:09,760
sulfur

1936
01:06:06,079 --> 01:06:10,640
limestone azomite some of the rock

1937
01:06:09,760 --> 01:06:13,280
powers would be

1938
01:06:10,640 --> 01:06:14,960
fall everything else is sort of in the

1939
01:06:13,280 --> 01:06:19,119
gray area you can do either one

1940
01:06:14,960 --> 01:06:22,559
but those are the general rules

1941
01:06:19,119 --> 01:06:24,400
is that information um

1942
01:06:22,559 --> 01:06:26,319
no but i'll simplify so i'll simplify

1943
01:06:24,400 --> 01:06:29,920
i'll say it again um

1944
01:06:26,319 --> 01:06:34,400
rock dust that dump that are not

1945
01:06:29,920 --> 01:06:36,880
water soluble plant foods some limestone

1946
01:06:34,400 --> 01:06:37,760
sulfur that requires biological process

1947
01:06:36,880 --> 01:06:41,760
to break down

1948
01:06:37,760 --> 01:06:41,760
things like that are best in the fall

1949
01:06:42,160 --> 01:06:45,680
but you can do it in the spring but

1950
01:06:43,520 --> 01:06:47,680
they're best to say in the fall and

1951
01:06:45,680 --> 01:06:48,960
anything is water soluble so those would

1952
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,160
be the things that are commonly thought

1953
01:06:48,960 --> 01:06:55,039
of as fertilizers

1954
01:06:50,160 --> 01:06:57,760
so potassium sulfate kmag or sulfur mag

1955
01:06:55,039 --> 01:06:59,359
any of the phosphate the the sulfate

1956
01:06:57,760 --> 01:07:01,039
fertilizer any of them really

1957
01:06:59,359 --> 01:07:02,799
they're going to leach more readily so

1958
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:04,079
you want to apply them in the spring

1959
01:07:02,799 --> 01:07:05,039
when you have a lot of biological

1960
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:06,559
activity

1961
01:07:05,039 --> 01:07:08,160
to tie them up to make sure they don't

1962
01:07:06,559 --> 01:07:10,559
run away

1963
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:12,160
yeah can you like say for salt for

1964
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:14,319
sulphur can you just throw it on your

1965
01:07:12,160 --> 01:07:17,440
soil or is it

1966
01:07:14,319 --> 01:07:20,559
so uh you do not have to incorporate

1967
01:07:17,440 --> 01:07:22,559
uh i certain if you're like if you're

1968
01:07:20,559 --> 01:07:25,680
chilling just to incorporate minerals

1969
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:27,520
um i highly recommend you not do that uh

1970
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:29,839
if you are going to till

1971
01:07:27,520 --> 01:07:31,599
anyway then it's nice to put the

1972
01:07:29,839 --> 01:07:31,920
minerals down first because it is better

1973
01:07:31,599 --> 01:07:34,400
to

1974
01:07:31,920 --> 01:07:35,920
incorporate them but if you have healthy

1975
01:07:34,400 --> 01:07:37,200
soil life they'll bring your they'll

1976
01:07:35,920 --> 01:07:37,680
bring those minerals where they need to

1977
01:07:37,200 --> 01:07:41,200
go

1978
01:07:37,680 --> 01:07:42,000
quite quickly so yeah it's not necessary

1979
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,280
for sure

1980
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:45,520
how about if you have like a lot of

1981
01:07:43,280 --> 01:07:47,039
organic matter yeah so if you have

1982
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:49,119
organic matter you can put it right on

1983
01:07:47,039 --> 01:07:52,559
top if your organic matter

1984
01:07:49,119 --> 01:07:53,200
is something like um if it's something

1985
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:55,039
like leaves

1986
01:07:53,200 --> 01:07:56,960
that where it might sort of concentrate

1987
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,480
some of those things so if you

1988
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,480
it hits the leaf and then it rolls and

1989
01:07:58,480 --> 01:08:00,960
it all goes to one place where you're

1990
01:08:00,480 --> 01:08:03,119
gonna

1991
01:08:00,960 --> 01:08:04,720
overdo the soil on a certain mineral

1992
01:08:03,119 --> 01:08:07,280
then sometimes

1993
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:08,880
that's less than ideal um but most

1994
01:08:07,280 --> 01:08:10,799
things you can put right on top without

1995
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,280
wearing so

1996
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:14,720
just kind of look at how it if you're

1997
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:16,080
spreading it by hand or whatever

1998
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:17,920
look at an area see how much it's

1999
01:08:16,080 --> 01:08:19,759
concentrating in your particular

2000
01:08:17,920 --> 01:08:21,199
type of mulch and see if you think it's

2001
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,880
going to be a problem and if it is you

2002
01:08:21,199 --> 01:08:25,040
can always just put half as much down

2003
01:08:22,880 --> 01:08:26,960
and then do the other half in the spring

2004
01:08:25,040 --> 01:08:28,960
or at a later time

2005
01:08:26,960 --> 01:08:30,799
um to make sure you don't overdo it at

2006
01:08:28,960 --> 01:08:33,520
one time

2007
01:08:30,799 --> 01:08:34,400
would you say azerite in the fall i

2008
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:36,239
would but i

2009
01:08:34,400 --> 01:08:38,000
like his i mean if i'm going to use i

2010
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:39,759
might use a little bit involved a little

2011
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:41,759
bit again in the spring i actually

2012
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:45,279
really like to do that when i can if

2013
01:08:41,759 --> 01:08:45,279
it's not adding a lot of extra work

2014
01:08:45,600 --> 01:08:49,839
i do want to also mention that all of

2015
01:08:47,679 --> 01:08:52,159
the recommendations on the website

2016
01:08:49,839 --> 01:08:53,520
they are in terms of granular materials

2017
01:08:52,159 --> 01:08:56,080
i really want to stress this

2018
01:08:53,520 --> 01:08:57,920
if you're using water soluble you want

2019
01:08:56,080 --> 01:09:01,520
to reduce your application rate

2020
01:08:57,920 --> 01:09:01,520
it's an important piece

2021
01:09:02,799 --> 01:09:08,400
all right so i didn't get through nearly

2022
01:09:06,080 --> 01:09:12,480
as much as i wanted to

2023
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:15,199
um there's so much to this

2024
01:09:12,480 --> 01:09:15,920
it is it is overwhelming um but i do

2025
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:17,839
want to just

2026
01:09:15,920 --> 01:09:18,960
mention again the the thing you want to

2027
01:09:17,839 --> 01:09:21,199
focus on is you look

2028
01:09:18,960 --> 01:09:23,359
for the weakest link in your particular

2029
01:09:21,199 --> 01:09:26,319
soil so that's where you want to focus

2030
01:09:23,359 --> 01:09:27,440
don't get super into getting the soil

2031
01:09:26,319 --> 01:09:29,679
test perfect

2032
01:09:27,440 --> 01:09:30,960
um soil tests have a tendency of

2033
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,920
humbling you quite quickly

2034
01:09:30,960 --> 01:09:34,080
you think you're doing everything

2035
01:09:31,920 --> 01:09:36,880
perfect you take your next soil test

2036
01:09:34,080 --> 01:09:37,600
and it's it's like what the heck just

2037
01:09:36,880 --> 01:09:39,279
happened

2038
01:09:37,600 --> 01:09:41,040
um it happens all the time generally

2039
01:09:39,279 --> 01:09:43,279
there is an explanation for it

2040
01:09:41,040 --> 01:09:44,960
uh but it can be frustrating um when you

2041
01:09:43,279 --> 01:09:46,480
don't understand that explanation

2042
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:48,319
but generally speaking if it doesn't

2043
01:09:46,480 --> 01:09:50,400
look like what you expected it to

2044
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:52,799
just do the whole exercise again what is

2045
01:09:50,400 --> 01:09:55,040
now the weakest link and focus on that

2046
01:09:52,799 --> 01:09:56,560
um some things that get people tripped

2047
01:09:55,040 --> 01:09:57,360
up as they put line down the next year

2048
01:09:56,560 --> 01:10:00,480
they test

2049
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,679
and they don't see anything improved and

2050
01:10:00,480 --> 01:10:03,679
because they don't realize life takes

2051
01:10:01,679 --> 01:10:05,040
three years to break down so if it takes

2052
01:10:03,679 --> 01:10:06,159
three years and you're testing more

2053
01:10:05,040 --> 01:10:09,120
frequently than that

2054
01:10:06,159 --> 01:10:09,600
it's quite likely you're gonna see um

2055
01:10:09,120 --> 01:10:12,800
nothing

2056
01:10:09,600 --> 01:10:13,199
or a very reduced influence of that and

2057
01:10:12,800 --> 01:10:15,440
so

2058
01:10:13,199 --> 01:10:16,480
um keep in mind what you've applied in

2059
01:10:15,440 --> 01:10:18,640
the past

2060
01:10:16,480 --> 01:10:20,239
and if you use your intuition to

2061
01:10:18,640 --> 01:10:23,120
somebody make sure you're thinking about

2062
01:10:20,239 --> 01:10:24,640
that and don't overdo it so if you're

2063
01:10:23,120 --> 01:10:25,760
testing every year and you're adding and

2064
01:10:24,640 --> 01:10:27,040
you needed limestone and you had

2065
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:29,679
limestone last year don't

2066
01:10:27,040 --> 01:10:31,120
add the same amount of lime again

2067
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:33,040
because you're probably gonna

2068
01:10:31,120 --> 01:10:34,800
likely be overdoing a lot when all that

2069
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:36,080
becomes available in three years

2070
01:10:34,800 --> 01:10:37,840
you will have a new problem you've

2071
01:10:36,080 --> 01:10:39,840
created so um

2072
01:10:37,840 --> 01:10:41,199
take a slow and steady approach to it

2073
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:42,880
remember that we're not actually trying

2074
01:10:41,199 --> 01:10:43,440
to get a perfect soil test we're just

2075
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,520
trying to

2076
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:49,040
influence the soil structure and the

2077
01:10:45,520 --> 01:10:52,960
biology in the system as a whole

2078
01:10:49,040 --> 01:10:54,719
and and here's where i mean so

2079
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,000
the biology trumps all this stuff every

2080
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:59,040
time

2081
01:10:56,000 --> 01:11:00,560
i mean if you had perfect soil biology

2082
01:10:59,040 --> 01:11:02,400
like you could shred this and never look

2083
01:11:00,560 --> 01:11:03,120
at it doesn't matter it doesn't matter

2084
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:06,080
at all

2085
01:11:03,120 --> 01:11:07,440
um the key though is that i've not ever

2086
01:11:06,080 --> 01:11:10,560
seen an example of

2087
01:11:07,440 --> 01:11:12,560
really healthy um and i mean like

2088
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,320
perfectly efficient like super massively

2089
01:11:12,560 --> 01:11:15,600
efficient systems where biology is

2090
01:11:14,320 --> 01:11:17,440
working really well

2091
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:20,719
where the underlying soil chemistry was

2092
01:11:17,440 --> 01:11:22,560
really screwed up i've never seen it

2093
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,560
maybe other people have but i would

2094
01:11:22,560 --> 01:11:24,880
argue that even in that system you think

2095
01:11:24,560 --> 01:11:27,840
it's

2096
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:29,280
functioning really well in biology alone

2097
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:30,320
add the minerals and see if it does even

2098
01:11:29,280 --> 01:11:33,280
better

2099
01:11:30,320 --> 01:11:33,920
because everything i've ever seen when

2100
01:11:33,280 --> 01:11:36,960
you

2101
01:11:33,920 --> 01:11:38,640
work with the whole system holistically

2102
01:11:36,960 --> 01:11:39,600
look to try to figure out exactly all

2103
01:11:38,640 --> 01:11:42,640
the places you can

2104
01:11:39,600 --> 01:11:45,600
influence it it always works better than

2105
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,000
just looking at one thing at a time so

2106
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:49,840
that's

2107
01:11:46,000 --> 01:11:49,840
that's a key thing i want to stress

2108
01:11:50,560 --> 01:11:54,880
yeah so i'd like to open up the question

2109
01:11:52,960 --> 01:11:55,600
because i don't have time to go to the

2110
01:11:54,880 --> 01:11:59,280
next

2111
01:11:55,600 --> 01:12:01,120
section of material um there's a lot of

2112
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,600
material in these slides at the end

2113
01:12:01,120 --> 01:12:04,159
i talk about what i have in here every

2114
01:12:03,600 --> 01:12:06,239
element

2115
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,480
what it does for plants how it works in

2116
01:12:06,239 --> 01:12:09,280
soil just a really quick little slide on

2117
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,199
each one

2118
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:12,480
because then that that helps so if you

2119
01:12:11,199 --> 01:12:14,640
understand what it's doing

2120
01:12:12,480 --> 01:12:15,920
then it can help you can help to figure

2121
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,640
out what your plants might be

2122
01:12:15,920 --> 01:12:19,840
lacking what your soil might prove um so

2123
01:12:18,640 --> 01:12:21,280
take a look at the slides

2124
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:23,120
from the website well they'd be on the

2125
01:12:21,280 --> 01:12:26,960
website they will be on the website

2126
01:12:23,120 --> 01:12:29,760
yes and hopefully soon and

2127
01:12:26,960 --> 01:12:31,440
there's more slides in here this uh

2128
01:12:29,760 --> 01:12:34,080
mentioned something real quick

2129
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:35,199
so when you have uh imbalances you often

2130
01:12:34,080 --> 01:12:38,080
will see

2131
01:12:35,199 --> 01:12:39,360
them show up in different ways and so

2132
01:12:38,080 --> 01:12:41,520
sometimes you'll see

2133
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:42,880
um you can find potassium deficiencies

2134
01:12:41,520 --> 01:12:44,880
by looking at the leaves you can see

2135
01:12:42,880 --> 01:12:46,640
calcium efficiency looking at the plants

2136
01:12:44,880 --> 01:12:48,239
and so you can actually figure out a lot

2137
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,679
of what you might need

2138
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,520
based on just looking at your field of

2139
01:12:49,679 --> 01:12:55,199
getting good at observing

2140
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:57,280
differences in changes in your plants um

2141
01:12:55,199 --> 01:12:58,880
and sometimes you'll have plenty of say

2142
01:12:57,280 --> 01:13:01,360
potassium control tests but

2143
01:12:58,880 --> 01:13:02,960
you've got plants that look an act just

2144
01:13:01,360 --> 01:13:04,560
like potassium deficient plants

2145
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:06,480
you see it actually all the time

2146
01:13:04,560 --> 01:13:07,760
generally it'll it should

2147
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:09,920
tell you there's something else going on

2148
01:13:07,760 --> 01:13:10,800
maybe your irrigation system is not

2149
01:13:09,920 --> 01:13:12,640
working right

2150
01:13:10,800 --> 01:13:14,000
there's not enough water or there's some

2151
01:13:12,640 --> 01:13:16,640
other issue that

2152
01:13:14,000 --> 01:13:18,000
what happens all the time and just real

2153
01:13:16,640 --> 01:13:22,000
quick does anyone know

2154
01:13:18,000 --> 01:13:24,719
um does anyone know what causes this

2155
01:13:22,000 --> 01:13:25,360
calcium calcium there you go so if you

2156
01:13:24,719 --> 01:13:26,880
have

2157
01:13:25,360 --> 01:13:28,719
calcium getting your plant attitude

2158
01:13:26,880 --> 01:13:31,840
amounts you will never see this

2159
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:33,360
ever um what is what is that what caused

2160
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,679
this one

2161
01:13:33,360 --> 01:13:38,080
does anyone know is that what your

2162
01:13:35,679 --> 01:13:40,560
tomatoes look like

2163
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,920
um that is potassium efficiency it's a

2164
01:13:40,560 --> 01:13:43,520
pretty classic potassium

2165
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,360
deficiency if you don't have enough

2166
01:13:43,520 --> 01:13:48,960
potassium getting your plants you don't

2167
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:50,560
get uh even ripening and you may not

2168
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:53,120
even have examples where you can get no

2169
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:54,480
ripening at all and it's really bad

2170
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:01,520
uh and what about this one does anyone

2171
01:13:54,480 --> 01:14:03,600
recognize this first so this one's

2172
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,719
commonly uh uh this is commonly called

2173
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:06,480
early blight

2174
01:14:04,719 --> 01:14:07,920
some people may have had it on their

2175
01:14:06,480 --> 01:14:10,960
plants in the past

2176
01:14:07,920 --> 01:14:12,239
and this and this are caused by the

2177
01:14:10,960 --> 01:14:14,080
exact same thing

2178
01:14:12,239 --> 01:14:16,080
if you have adequate potassium in your

2179
01:14:14,080 --> 01:14:18,800
plants you will not get early blood

2180
01:14:16,080 --> 01:14:20,320
your plants will die from frost at the

2181
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,520
end of the year

2182
01:14:20,320 --> 01:14:26,880
with green leaves always from the ground

2183
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:29,360
all the way to the top so

2184
01:14:26,880 --> 01:14:31,040
um these things you know so if you're

2185
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:34,080
seeing these things you have a

2186
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:36,640
sign of so underlying problems

2187
01:14:34,080 --> 01:14:38,080
uh i would argue that there are a number

2188
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:40,080
of ways of addressing them

2189
01:14:38,080 --> 01:14:42,159
uh the psa likes to talk about the soil

2190
01:14:40,080 --> 01:14:43,920
the minerals the biology

2191
01:14:42,159 --> 01:14:45,920
one thing that i have found extremely

2192
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:49,120
helpful is

2193
01:14:45,920 --> 01:14:51,360
liquids foliar sprays inoculants

2194
01:14:49,120 --> 01:14:53,360
these things are by my way thinking like

2195
01:14:51,360 --> 01:14:56,159
cheating if you go out when you spray

2196
01:14:53,360 --> 01:14:58,640
really good foliar amendments uh plant

2197
01:14:56,159 --> 01:15:00,880
shore from agridynamics foley 8k

2198
01:14:58,640 --> 01:15:01,840
uh people out there talking we have them

2199
01:15:00,880 --> 01:15:04,239
in the mineral depot

2200
01:15:01,840 --> 01:15:05,679
you spray those once a week tiny amounts

2201
01:15:04,239 --> 01:15:08,719
like tiny tiny amounts

2202
01:15:05,679 --> 01:15:09,920
off in the grand steaming land they can

2203
01:15:08,719 --> 01:15:12,080
keep you from having any of these

2204
01:15:09,920 --> 01:15:14,159
problems they keep your plants healthier

2205
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:16,400
and then what i have seen is one of the

2206
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:19,040
best ways to build biology in your soil

2207
01:15:16,400 --> 01:15:20,080
is you use the foliar sprays you

2208
01:15:19,040 --> 01:15:22,480
inoculate

2209
01:15:20,080 --> 01:15:24,719
and what happens is your plants stay at

2210
01:15:22,480 --> 01:15:25,360
you know one percent more efficient or

2211
01:15:24,719 --> 01:15:28,000
so at

2212
01:15:25,360 --> 01:15:28,880
say photosynthesizing um than the sun

2213
01:15:28,000 --> 01:15:32,239
that one percent

2214
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:34,480
say they're they need this much and they

2215
01:15:32,239 --> 01:15:36,000
sprung synthesize and they're

2216
01:15:34,480 --> 01:15:37,360
photosynthesizing this much so they're

2217
01:15:36,000 --> 01:15:38,480
putting this much into the soil

2218
01:15:37,360 --> 01:15:40,960
and you're able to increase it one

2219
01:15:38,480 --> 01:15:44,480
percent more of that one percent

2220
01:15:40,960 --> 01:15:46,800
increase is going to go into the soil um

2221
01:15:44,480 --> 01:15:48,400
so little tiny influences on

2222
01:15:46,800 --> 01:15:51,040
photosynthetic efficiency

2223
01:15:48,400 --> 01:15:51,760
can quickly double triple et cetera the

2224
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,199
amount of

2225
01:15:51,760 --> 01:15:55,199
carbon that your plant can put into the

2226
01:15:53,199 --> 01:15:57,120
soil because it's creating now

2227
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,360
excess energy and that is what feeds

2228
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:00,320
soil life that's what builds biology

2229
01:15:59,360 --> 01:16:03,360
builds

2230
01:16:00,320 --> 01:16:06,000
uh healthy biologically active soils

2231
01:16:03,360 --> 01:16:07,280
and so anything you can do in my book

2232
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,800
anything you can do to keep plants a

2233
01:16:07,280 --> 01:16:10,320
little bit healthier whether that's soil

2234
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:12,159
minerals whether that's foliars or

2235
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:14,640
anything else it's going to

2236
01:16:12,159 --> 01:16:15,840
um improve the biological function in

2237
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,480
that system so

2238
01:16:15,840 --> 01:16:19,440
that's the last thing i wanted to stress

2239
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:22,159
i think

2240
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:25,040
and so i will stay as long as people

2241
01:16:22,159 --> 01:16:25,040
want to stay and ask

2242
01:16:33,600 --> 01:16:36,960
can you questions about aluminum a

2243
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:38,320
little bit aluminum yeah it's always on

2244
01:16:36,960 --> 01:16:39,360
this oil it's always not sort of this

2245
01:16:38,320 --> 01:16:41,600
yeah

2246
01:16:39,360 --> 01:16:44,400
so aluminum is always on uh at least

2247
01:16:41,600 --> 01:16:46,640
logan left soil tests and many others

2248
01:16:44,400 --> 01:16:47,679
uh the recommendations for aluminum i

2249
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,159
don't know where they come from

2250
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,800
they i have to see 200 250 parts per

2251
01:16:50,159 --> 01:16:53,840
million

2252
01:16:50,800 --> 01:16:57,360
i almost never maximum with 250.

2253
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:59,760
i almost never see one in range so i

2254
01:16:57,360 --> 01:17:01,120
basically disregard the recommended

2255
01:16:59,760 --> 01:17:03,760
range because

2256
01:17:01,120 --> 01:17:04,560
as with literally all of these elements

2257
01:17:03,760 --> 01:17:07,040
the

2258
01:17:04,560 --> 01:17:08,159
target amounts are basically just our

2259
01:17:07,040 --> 01:17:10,080
best guess

2260
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:11,679
and aluminum is one of those things that

2261
01:17:10,080 --> 01:17:14,320
um our best guess just

2262
01:17:11,679 --> 01:17:16,560
isn't that good so i don't worry too

2263
01:17:14,320 --> 01:17:16,560
much

2264
01:17:16,640 --> 01:17:20,960
basically aluminum is a problem where

2265
01:17:18,960 --> 01:17:23,600
you get toxic aluminum toxicity

2266
01:17:20,960 --> 01:17:24,080
the main issue there um aluminum is

2267
01:17:23,600 --> 01:17:27,520
everywhere

2268
01:17:24,080 --> 01:17:29,440
it's the foundation of clay uh play is

2269
01:17:27,520 --> 01:17:30,719
aluminum silica so it's in every like

2270
01:17:29,440 --> 01:17:32,960
clay molecule

2271
01:17:30,719 --> 01:17:34,719
and so it's everywhere and the only

2272
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:37,440
issue is when it becomes

2273
01:17:34,719 --> 01:17:37,920
toxic the only way it becomes toxic is

2274
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:40,719
if you're

2275
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,040
massively deficient in in your soil and

2276
01:17:40,719 --> 01:17:43,679
other

2277
01:17:41,040 --> 01:17:45,360
areas so that the plant is trying so

2278
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,920
desperately to get the nutrients it

2279
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:48,640
needs

2280
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:49,360
that it's making extremely harsh acids

2281
01:17:48,640 --> 01:17:51,199
dissolving

2282
01:17:49,360 --> 01:17:53,360
aluminum and sucking a little bit of the

2283
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:57,199
plant and causing a little toxicity

2284
01:17:53,360 --> 01:17:59,360
so if you have balanced soil if you are

2285
01:17:57,199 --> 01:18:00,400
if you're even anywhere close on your

2286
01:17:59,360 --> 01:18:02,640
soil test

2287
01:18:00,400 --> 01:18:04,239
i've never seen aluminum toxicity the

2288
01:18:02,640 --> 01:18:04,880
only place i've seen it is where you

2289
01:18:04,239 --> 01:18:06,480
have

2290
01:18:04,880 --> 01:18:07,840
people going blueberries where they've

2291
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:09,840
been told the only way to grow good

2292
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:11,440
blueberries is to lower your ph

2293
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,679
which by the way is not painful to

2294
01:18:11,440 --> 01:18:17,040
blueberries or anyone wants to know

2295
01:18:13,679 --> 01:18:18,640
um and then they push it so low they

2296
01:18:17,040 --> 01:18:20,560
make it so imbalanced that aluminum

2297
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:23,199
toxicity

2298
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:24,840
so um i don't really worry about it

2299
01:18:23,199 --> 01:18:26,960
unless i'm working with a blueberry

2300
01:18:24,840 --> 01:18:29,440
farmer

2301
01:18:26,960 --> 01:18:30,239
is there a visible sign or something

2302
01:18:29,440 --> 01:18:32,960
there is

2303
01:18:30,239 --> 01:18:34,239
i don't know off the top of my head i

2304
01:18:32,960 --> 01:18:35,280
would google that there's a lot of

2305
01:18:34,239 --> 01:18:37,920
resources

2306
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:40,800
online um i mentioned in one of these

2307
01:18:37,920 --> 01:18:44,960
slides this one i believe for

2308
01:18:40,800 --> 01:18:47,440
looking at nutrient impacts on

2309
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:49,600
plants so how you scout for nutrient

2310
01:18:47,440 --> 01:18:52,800
deficiency or excess

2311
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:55,679
is that related to arsenic

2312
01:18:52,800 --> 01:18:56,320
yeah i mean it's just a similar thing

2313
01:18:55,679 --> 01:18:58,000
applies

2314
01:18:56,320 --> 01:19:00,719
so people are really worried about heavy

2315
01:18:58,000 --> 01:19:03,120
metals metal toxicity in the soil

2316
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:04,000
lead uptake by plants my understanding

2317
01:19:03,120 --> 01:19:07,040
is most like

2318
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:09,360
heavy metal issues with produce is

2319
01:19:07,040 --> 01:19:11,120
from physically splashing lead

2320
01:19:09,360 --> 01:19:13,679
contaminated soil on your

2321
01:19:11,120 --> 01:19:14,480
feet and very little is picked up by the

2322
01:19:13,679 --> 01:19:16,800
plants

2323
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:19,199
but everything i've read suggests that

2324
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:21,520
if you're if your soil

2325
01:19:19,199 --> 01:19:23,840
balance the more balance your soil the

2326
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:27,120
less of those heavy metals are actually

2327
01:19:23,840 --> 01:19:28,560
brought up into your plant tissue

2328
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,320
and also the more biology you have the

2329
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,800
more of that gets chelated in such a way

2330
01:19:30,320 --> 01:19:37,840
that

2331
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:37,840
that's not a problem yeah

2332
01:19:48,840 --> 01:19:53,229
um

2333
01:19:50,120 --> 01:19:53,229
[Music]

2334
01:20:02,320 --> 01:20:07,040
yeah so um well first of all i recommend

2335
01:20:05,199 --> 01:20:09,440
testing soil about every two years

2336
01:20:07,040 --> 01:20:10,639
every other year testing or even every

2337
01:20:09,440 --> 01:20:13,840
three depending

2338
01:20:10,639 --> 01:20:18,639
so that's the first thing uh and then

2339
01:20:13,840 --> 01:20:18,639
uh so where what other that was

2340
01:20:23,990 --> 01:20:27,050
[Music]

2341
01:20:44,880 --> 01:20:47,840
right

2342
01:20:50,000 --> 01:20:54,000
it's a different focus perhaps yes but

2343
01:20:52,639 --> 01:20:54,480
i'd say they're complementary they're

2344
01:20:54,000 --> 01:21:01,120
not

2345
01:20:54,480 --> 01:21:02,960
mutually exclusive um i think that

2346
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:04,239
i don't i try not to get very dogmatic

2347
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:05,440
about this and it kind of bothers me

2348
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:08,719
when others do

2349
01:21:05,440 --> 01:21:10,800
um because uh we don't

2350
01:21:08,719 --> 01:21:13,199
it's not helpful to be dogmatic about

2351
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:16,320
this so

2352
01:21:13,199 --> 01:21:20,000
no but no but plenty of people do and

2353
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:23,520
i just want to uh it's

2354
01:21:20,000 --> 01:21:25,520
yeah basically um

2355
01:21:23,520 --> 01:21:27,280
if you're thinking about it holistically

2356
01:21:25,520 --> 01:21:29,840
you're trying to make improvements

2357
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,840
um

2358
01:21:32,239 --> 01:21:36,639
did you approach that field also

2359
01:21:35,199 --> 01:21:40,000
improving the microbial

2360
01:21:36,639 --> 01:21:40,800
yeah okay yes absolutely so if you look

2361
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:42,960
at

2362
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:45,040
no no so this is what i've been saying

2363
01:21:42,960 --> 01:21:47,440
so just doing the middle approach does

2364
01:21:45,040 --> 01:21:49,120
is not the best way to do it if you're

2365
01:21:47,440 --> 01:21:51,360
if you need biology and minerals

2366
01:21:49,120 --> 01:21:53,199
you do both um so this field we could

2367
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:54,159
not have gotten this in three years with

2368
01:21:53,199 --> 01:21:55,840
minerals alone

2369
01:21:54,159 --> 01:21:57,360
and i would argue i don't know anyone to

2370
01:21:55,840 --> 01:21:59,360
do with biology alone either now if

2371
01:21:57,360 --> 01:22:02,159
someone can please talk to me

2372
01:21:59,360 --> 01:22:03,679
um but people were trying to fix these

2373
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:05,040
fields with biology alone and people

2374
01:22:03,679 --> 01:22:07,199
were trying to fix it with

2375
01:22:05,040 --> 01:22:08,719
minerals alone and no one had as much

2376
01:22:07,199 --> 01:22:10,000
successes when they put it together so

2377
01:22:08,719 --> 01:22:13,199
this field got

2378
01:22:10,000 --> 01:22:16,080
the minerals it needed so it got

2379
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:17,120
um so this field in particular it had it

2380
01:22:16,080 --> 01:22:20,320
was like a tc

2381
01:22:17,120 --> 01:22:23,280
exchange capacity like 80 plus so it's

2382
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,000
like pure clay if people know that uh

2383
01:22:23,280 --> 01:22:28,000
the sodium

2384
01:22:24,000 --> 01:22:31,360
percent was 30. the magnesium was 30

2385
01:22:28,000 --> 01:22:33,040
and the calcium was 25 and so like

2386
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:35,040
look here they have to totally screw up

2387
01:22:33,040 --> 01:22:37,120
soil and that's why nothing literally

2388
01:22:35,040 --> 01:22:38,719
nothing would grow

2389
01:22:37,120 --> 01:22:40,400
and we probably could have added biology

2390
01:22:38,719 --> 01:22:41,600
alone to that but you add biology along

2391
01:22:40,400 --> 01:22:42,880
with that with something where you can't

2392
01:22:41,600 --> 01:22:45,280
even get weeds to grow

2393
01:22:42,880 --> 01:22:46,159
the body just dies there's nothing to

2394
01:22:45,280 --> 01:22:48,560
feed it

2395
01:22:46,159 --> 01:22:49,440
so what we did was we we broke every

2396
01:22:48,560 --> 01:22:51,440
rule of the book

2397
01:22:49,440 --> 01:22:52,880
we applied like 2 000 pounds of

2398
01:22:51,440 --> 01:22:56,480
elemental sulfur

2399
01:22:52,880 --> 01:22:59,840
we applied 10 tons per acre of gypsum

2400
01:22:56,480 --> 01:23:00,880
by the way do not do this unless you

2401
01:22:59,840 --> 01:23:04,639
have

2402
01:23:00,880 --> 01:23:07,280
this soil don't do that

2403
01:23:04,639 --> 01:23:09,280
um but it's exactly what this soil

2404
01:23:07,280 --> 01:23:10,719
needed to jump start the system like you

2405
01:23:09,280 --> 01:23:12,880
couldn't have jump started

2406
01:23:10,719 --> 01:23:14,639
a functional system here unless you did

2407
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:16,000
something that radical

2408
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:17,360
most of the time you're not dealing with

2409
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:18,560
things that need radical change you're

2410
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:19,520
dealing with things that need like

2411
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:22,000
tweaking

2412
01:23:19,520 --> 01:23:22,560
um but it works on when you have big

2413
01:23:22,000 --> 01:23:24,080
problems

2414
01:23:22,560 --> 01:23:25,600
it works and it works because you're

2415
01:23:24,080 --> 01:23:27,600
addressing the your big

2416
01:23:25,600 --> 01:23:29,199
challenges which then allows the whole

2417
01:23:27,600 --> 01:23:32,400
system to work better

2418
01:23:29,199 --> 01:23:34,080
so what we did is uh lots of

2419
01:23:32,400 --> 01:23:36,560
gypsums what luckily jupiter was cheap

2420
01:23:34,080 --> 01:23:38,480
in this area we used lots of sulfur to

2421
01:23:36,560 --> 01:23:38,960
help get rid of that extra sodium and

2422
01:23:38,480 --> 01:23:41,600
the

2423
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:43,199
magnesium we tried we grew whatever the

2424
01:23:41,600 --> 01:23:45,840
heck we could

2425
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:46,880
uh we added a whole bunch of humates and

2426
01:23:45,840 --> 01:23:48,480
carbon sources

2427
01:23:46,880 --> 01:23:50,320
and microbes are not going to have

2428
01:23:48,480 --> 01:23:53,360
microbes and then

2429
01:23:50,320 --> 01:23:54,000
this so yeah if it works together it

2430
01:23:53,360 --> 01:23:57,440
works

2431
01:23:54,000 --> 01:23:58,239
really well yes uh yeah that kind of

2432
01:23:57,440 --> 01:24:00,880
soil is

2433
01:23:58,239 --> 01:24:02,239
somewhat similar it's over seven percent

2434
01:24:00,880 --> 01:24:06,000
uh

2435
01:24:02,239 --> 01:24:07,360
7ph sorry okay and um i'm curious so

2436
01:24:06,000 --> 01:24:10,480
they recommended

2437
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:12,719
some of the micronutrients in sulfate of

2438
01:24:10,480 --> 01:24:17,840
copper sulfate because as the ph is

2439
01:24:12,719 --> 01:24:17,840
going up some of those micronutrients

2440
01:24:20,480 --> 01:24:25,760
i'm curious if they were recommending

2441
01:24:23,600 --> 01:24:28,000
smaller amounts just because that was

2442
01:24:25,760 --> 01:24:29,920
you can only add so much per year and

2443
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,880
how much of an impact will that

2444
01:24:29,920 --> 01:24:36,159
potentially have on my ph

2445
01:24:32,880 --> 01:24:38,080
smaller quantities not much what's

2446
01:24:36,159 --> 01:24:39,600
your exchange capacity that's so that's

2447
01:24:38,080 --> 01:24:42,080
partially what determines how much

2448
01:24:39,600 --> 01:24:45,760
material it takes to increase

2449
01:24:42,080 --> 01:24:47,440
protein so i mean i haven't seen the

2450
01:24:45,760 --> 01:24:48,719
result your testosterone of course but i

2451
01:24:47,440 --> 01:24:51,280
would say

2452
01:24:48,719 --> 01:24:52,800
if you're not adding elemental sulfur

2453
01:24:51,280 --> 01:24:53,840
you're not going to see your ph change

2454
01:24:52,800 --> 01:24:56,400
dramatically

2455
01:24:53,840 --> 01:24:57,760
um if you're adding just a little bit of

2456
01:24:56,400 --> 01:25:01,920
sulfate fertilizers

2457
01:24:57,760 --> 01:25:03,920
then it'll might change it marginally

2458
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:07,120
when you are adding those small amounts

2459
01:25:03,920 --> 01:25:08,800
of those elements

2460
01:25:07,120 --> 01:25:11,440
your in many cases they recommend them

2461
01:25:08,800 --> 01:25:12,719
to to feed the crop model to get your

2462
01:25:11,440 --> 01:25:14,639
crop healthy enough

2463
01:25:12,719 --> 01:25:16,800
uh you can also use foliars in that case

2464
01:25:14,639 --> 01:25:17,280
so if you're if your soil is really high

2465
01:25:16,800 --> 01:25:20,400
ph

2466
01:25:17,280 --> 01:25:22,000
a low sediment is not really high but if

2467
01:25:20,400 --> 01:25:23,440
it is really high you can use foliars

2468
01:25:22,000 --> 01:25:25,360
because if you add it to the soil it's

2469
01:25:23,440 --> 01:25:27,520
not going to be available to plants so

2470
01:25:25,360 --> 01:25:28,800
there's a lot of strategies that you can

2471
01:25:27,520 --> 01:25:31,440
utilize

2472
01:25:28,800 --> 01:25:32,159
in that example but if you're i mean i

2473
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:34,639
don't know what

2474
01:25:32,159 --> 01:25:36,880
low numbers you were given like what

2475
01:25:34,639 --> 01:25:41,199
whether it was 30 pounds

2476
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:44,639
it might have been like about 15 15. um

2477
01:25:41,199 --> 01:25:47,040
if you're 15 pounds is basically nothing

2478
01:25:44,639 --> 01:25:48,080
it's on a per acre basis for l slower so

2479
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:49,920
i mean if you were

2480
01:25:48,080 --> 01:25:52,239
already basically at 50 million or

2481
01:25:49,920 --> 01:25:54,000
already at your target or 75 even better

2482
01:25:52,239 --> 01:25:56,000
15 is probably a good maintenance

2483
01:25:54,000 --> 01:25:58,080
application to keep it there

2484
01:25:56,000 --> 01:26:00,080
um the sulfate oil is critically

2485
01:25:58,080 --> 01:26:01,120
important ones and one thing that i'll

2486
01:26:00,080 --> 01:26:04,320
mention is that

2487
01:26:01,120 --> 01:26:05,280
um sulfur we used to barbecue get a lot

2488
01:26:04,320 --> 01:26:07,120
of sulfur in

2489
01:26:05,280 --> 01:26:08,320
their fertilizer when they used

2490
01:26:07,120 --> 01:26:10,639
conventional

2491
01:26:08,320 --> 01:26:12,639
phosphate fertilizers there was a there

2492
01:26:10,639 --> 01:26:14,480
was gypsum mixed in so they got calcium

2493
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,560
sulfur and phosphorus all together

2494
01:26:14,480 --> 01:26:18,159
and then they they started moving to

2495
01:26:16,560 --> 01:26:19,199
triple super phosphate because it was

2496
01:26:18,159 --> 01:26:20,560
more efficient

2497
01:26:19,199 --> 01:26:22,480
because they had always stripped out all

2498
01:26:20,560 --> 01:26:25,679
the calcium sulfur is just phosphorus

2499
01:26:22,480 --> 01:26:26,800
great great idea um and then the other

2500
01:26:25,679 --> 01:26:29,760
thing that happened

2501
01:26:26,800 --> 01:26:30,960
in the last couple decades is the clean

2502
01:26:29,760 --> 01:26:33,040
air act

2503
01:26:30,960 --> 01:26:34,719
uh has dramatically reduced the amount

2504
01:26:33,040 --> 01:26:36,400
of sulfur in the atmosphere coming out

2505
01:26:34,719 --> 01:26:39,360
of coal-fired power plants

2506
01:26:36,400 --> 01:26:40,080
and farmers we're actually getting a

2507
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:43,120
reasonable

2508
01:26:40,080 --> 01:26:46,320
dose of sulfur sulfur fertilizer

2509
01:26:43,120 --> 01:26:47,280
everywhere from acid rain and now we're

2510
01:26:46,320 --> 01:26:49,440
not getting it

2511
01:26:47,280 --> 01:26:51,040
and i would argue there's a lot of soil

2512
01:26:49,440 --> 01:26:52,800
systems that kind of got used to it and

2513
01:26:51,040 --> 01:26:54,080
they were hooked on it and

2514
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:55,840
now they're struggling because they're

2515
01:26:54,080 --> 01:26:59,120
deficient and the sulfur

2516
01:26:55,840 --> 01:27:00,639
was being rained on for so long

2517
01:26:59,120 --> 01:27:02,239
was also stripping out some of those

2518
01:27:00,639 --> 01:27:05,600
other elements like calcium

2519
01:27:02,239 --> 01:27:07,520
so i think just thinking that we can

2520
01:27:05,600 --> 01:27:08,800
just let nature take its course

2521
01:27:07,520 --> 01:27:10,480
we've already screwed the pooch on that

2522
01:27:08,800 --> 01:27:13,199
one so um you gotta do something a

2523
01:27:10,480 --> 01:27:13,199
little better than that

2524
01:27:13,440 --> 01:27:20,719
uh yeah please speak to uh the use

2525
01:27:16,880 --> 01:27:22,560
of sea salt yeah um

2526
01:27:20,719 --> 01:27:24,080
so sea salt is great uh basically

2527
01:27:22,560 --> 01:27:25,199
anything from the ocean it's gonna have

2528
01:27:24,080 --> 01:27:27,440
a lot of

2529
01:27:25,199 --> 01:27:29,520
trace elements a lot of like micro trace

2530
01:27:27,440 --> 01:27:31,280
elements so we only looked at a couple

2531
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:33,679
of elements here on the soil

2532
01:27:31,280 --> 01:27:36,560
before but there's plenty of evidence to

2533
01:27:33,679 --> 01:27:38,800
suggest at least 42 maybe 46

2534
01:27:36,560 --> 01:27:40,800
elements are necessary for enzyme

2535
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:42,400
pathogens that have been identified

2536
01:27:40,800 --> 01:27:44,639
there are 92 naturally occurring

2537
01:27:42,400 --> 01:27:46,239
elements and there is probably an enzyme

2538
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:48,400
pathway that needs every single one

2539
01:27:46,239 --> 01:27:49,600
uranium included um just haven't

2540
01:27:48,400 --> 01:27:52,320
discovered it i've

2541
01:27:49,600 --> 01:27:54,000
seriously spent money on that um and

2542
01:27:52,320 --> 01:27:56,239
what that means is if you can get

2543
01:27:54,000 --> 01:27:57,520
those in there in tiny trace amounts you

2544
01:27:56,239 --> 01:28:00,880
might be actually

2545
01:27:57,520 --> 01:28:01,840
um increasing your your the efficiency

2546
01:28:00,880 --> 01:28:04,719
of your system

2547
01:28:01,840 --> 01:28:06,159
um salt water is going to have most if

2548
01:28:04,719 --> 01:28:07,360
not all of those naturally occurring

2549
01:28:06,159 --> 01:28:08,960
elements in it so you're going to get

2550
01:28:07,360 --> 01:28:09,840
those tiny trace amounts which is really

2551
01:28:08,960 --> 01:28:12,560
all you need

2552
01:28:09,840 --> 01:28:13,600
if you don't have them um if you have

2553
01:28:12,560 --> 01:28:16,880
too much sodium you

2554
01:28:13,600 --> 01:28:18,480
definitely want to avoid the sodium uh

2555
01:28:16,880 --> 01:28:19,760
the sea salts that don't have the sodium

2556
01:28:18,480 --> 01:28:21,120
removed there are some processes you can

2557
01:28:19,760 --> 01:28:23,040
use to actually

2558
01:28:21,120 --> 01:28:24,560
remove most of the sodium from seawater

2559
01:28:23,040 --> 01:28:27,760
and still keep the

2560
01:28:24,560 --> 01:28:30,239
trace elements um but yeah it's

2561
01:28:27,760 --> 01:28:31,600
it's great i like that uh azomite it has

2562
01:28:30,239 --> 01:28:33,280
a lot of trace elements

2563
01:28:31,600 --> 01:28:35,280
um that's why we have to recommend like

2564
01:28:33,280 --> 01:28:35,920
the salt rock dust or any rock dust

2565
01:28:35,280 --> 01:28:36,960
really

2566
01:28:35,920 --> 01:28:39,360
because there's a lot of those trace

2567
01:28:36,960 --> 01:28:40,560
elements um well that don't think i

2568
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:42,880
mentioned was that

2569
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:44,000
we're talking about biological diversity

2570
01:28:42,880 --> 01:28:46,639
but one thing that

2571
01:28:44,000 --> 01:28:47,920
spurs biological diversity is diversity

2572
01:28:46,639 --> 01:28:50,000
of

2573
01:28:47,920 --> 01:28:51,040
things in the soil parent materials so a

2574
01:28:50,000 --> 01:28:52,639
diverse

2575
01:28:51,040 --> 01:28:54,639
diversity of minerals in your soil will

2576
01:28:52,639 --> 01:28:55,600
actually spur a diversity of biology

2577
01:28:54,639 --> 01:28:57,679
because

2578
01:28:55,600 --> 01:28:58,800
different types of biology are are

2579
01:28:57,679 --> 01:29:00,639
better or worse at

2580
01:28:58,800 --> 01:29:02,320
digesting different things in your soil

2581
01:29:00,639 --> 01:29:04,320
so um

2582
01:29:02,320 --> 01:29:05,600
i mean there's microbes that eat you

2583
01:29:04,320 --> 01:29:09,840
know sulfur

2584
01:29:05,600 --> 01:29:11,280
sulfur sulfur vents under the ocean

2585
01:29:09,840 --> 01:29:12,480
there's like the microbes that literally

2586
01:29:11,280 --> 01:29:15,360
live off of that

2587
01:29:12,480 --> 01:29:16,000
and so it's um when we add sulfur we're

2588
01:29:15,360 --> 01:29:19,280
probably

2589
01:29:16,000 --> 01:29:20,560
keeping entire new species of life

2590
01:29:19,280 --> 01:29:22,880
alive in our soil and giving them

2591
01:29:20,560 --> 01:29:23,440
conditions to thrive so anytime you can

2592
01:29:22,880 --> 01:29:25,120
add

2593
01:29:23,440 --> 01:29:26,880
diverse sources of things i like to do

2594
01:29:25,120 --> 01:29:28,719
it yeah

2595
01:29:26,880 --> 01:29:30,639
just back to your question about test

2596
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:34,159
frequency once every two years

2597
01:29:30,639 --> 01:29:36,880
um i wanted to steer away from doing

2598
01:29:34,159 --> 01:29:37,280
mineral testing chemicals because of the

2599
01:29:36,880 --> 01:29:39,199
very

2600
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:41,199
inherent variability in the sampling

2601
01:29:39,199 --> 01:29:42,960
yeah yeah and

2602
01:29:41,199 --> 01:29:46,719
then so i love your comments on that

2603
01:29:42,960 --> 01:29:46,719
plus seasonality impacts

2604
01:29:46,960 --> 01:29:51,360
the window or do you or or does it

2605
01:29:49,600 --> 01:29:54,400
somehow wash out the little

2606
01:29:51,360 --> 01:29:56,880
matter excuse me so the way i recommend

2607
01:29:54,400 --> 01:29:59,280
the question about the variability in

2608
01:29:56,880 --> 01:30:02,639
the testing itself and procedures

2609
01:29:59,280 --> 01:30:04,639
what i like to say is basically

2610
01:30:02,639 --> 01:30:06,480
when you test try to do the same way

2611
01:30:04,639 --> 01:30:08,000
because you're really going to compare

2612
01:30:06,480 --> 01:30:10,320
you want to compare yourself over time

2613
01:30:08,000 --> 01:30:11,040
to your same you have to start somewhere

2614
01:30:10,320 --> 01:30:13,360
but then you want to

2615
01:30:11,040 --> 01:30:15,440
kind of do an applesauce comparison do

2616
01:30:13,360 --> 01:30:18,480
the same time of year

2617
01:30:15,440 --> 01:30:19,199
do it in the same way you always want to

2618
01:30:18,480 --> 01:30:21,520
make sure you take

2619
01:30:19,199 --> 01:30:22,480
your samples from multiple places in the

2620
01:30:21,520 --> 01:30:23,760
field so you want to try to get a

2621
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:25,520
representative sample

2622
01:30:23,760 --> 01:30:27,120
the best way is to figure out this i

2623
01:30:25,520 --> 01:30:29,840
want to test this area so

2624
01:30:27,120 --> 01:30:30,320
basically try to do random tests don't

2625
01:30:29,840 --> 01:30:32,880
like

2626
01:30:30,320 --> 01:30:34,480
let your biases influence where you go

2627
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:37,360
or you might find that you

2628
01:30:34,480 --> 01:30:38,000
go to the places that are the best if

2629
01:30:37,360 --> 01:30:39,440
you're like

2630
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:41,280
i just ate a really good carrot from

2631
01:30:39,440 --> 01:30:42,400
here or the worst where you're because

2632
01:30:41,280 --> 01:30:43,840
you're thinking like

2633
01:30:42,400 --> 01:30:44,960
man this is not a good field so you're

2634
01:30:43,840 --> 01:30:45,840
gonna go to the worst and then you're

2635
01:30:44,960 --> 01:30:48,159
gonna

2636
01:30:45,840 --> 01:30:49,920
you know it'll but you can buy us your

2637
01:30:48,159 --> 01:30:52,880
soil sample with how you take

2638
01:30:49,920 --> 01:30:53,600
your test and so try to do randomly try

2639
01:30:52,880 --> 01:30:56,320
to do at least

2640
01:30:53,600 --> 01:30:57,360
seven to 12 ish that's a good branch for

2641
01:30:56,320 --> 01:30:59,679
the number

2642
01:30:57,360 --> 01:31:00,560
of cores that go into a bag the other

2643
01:30:59,679 --> 01:31:02,719
thing you want to do

2644
01:31:00,560 --> 01:31:04,560
is many people take it put into a bucket

2645
01:31:02,719 --> 01:31:05,600
mix it up take a sample put in a bag and

2646
01:31:04,560 --> 01:31:07,520
chip it

2647
01:31:05,600 --> 01:31:09,360
not the best way to do it because soil

2648
01:31:07,520 --> 01:31:10,159
is not homogeneous it does not break up

2649
01:31:09,360 --> 01:31:11,679
the same way

2650
01:31:10,159 --> 01:31:13,199
so when you mix it you're not actually

2651
01:31:11,679 --> 01:31:15,679
mixing and making homogeneous

2652
01:31:13,199 --> 01:31:16,800
usually unless you're really and

2653
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:18,880
diligent about it

2654
01:31:16,800 --> 01:31:20,239
and so what that's why soil probes are

2655
01:31:18,880 --> 01:31:20,880
really nice they don't have to cost a

2656
01:31:20,239 --> 01:31:23,520
lot

2657
01:31:20,880 --> 01:31:25,040
um you get them i think for as little as

2658
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:26,320
fifteen twenty dollars or you can pay

2659
01:31:25,040 --> 01:31:28,400
120

2660
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:29,840
um but basically anything that takes a

2661
01:31:28,400 --> 01:31:31,520
core sample

2662
01:31:29,840 --> 01:31:33,199
push the whole sample right into the bag

2663
01:31:31,520 --> 01:31:34,639
don't mix it the lab will mix it when

2664
01:31:33,199 --> 01:31:34,880
they get it they got the equipment to do

2665
01:31:34,639 --> 01:31:38,400
it

2666
01:31:34,880 --> 01:31:39,280
and homogenize it that's the best way

2667
01:31:38,400 --> 01:31:41,440
you also avoid

2668
01:31:39,280 --> 01:31:43,199
a potential route for contamination

2669
01:31:41,440 --> 01:31:45,520
which would be your bucket

2670
01:31:43,199 --> 01:31:47,520
i've seen soil tests come back where i'm

2671
01:31:45,520 --> 01:31:49,199
like that doesn't make any sense

2672
01:31:47,520 --> 01:31:50,639
i'm like where'd you put your sample and

2673
01:31:49,199 --> 01:31:52,239
then i put it in the bucket i said what

2674
01:31:50,639 --> 01:31:52,880
did you use the bucket for last fall and

2675
01:31:52,239 --> 01:31:55,280
they're like

2676
01:31:52,880 --> 01:31:56,239
well used i planted some bulbs and so uh

2677
01:31:55,280 --> 01:31:58,480
oh

2678
01:31:56,239 --> 01:32:00,639
bone meal and limestone okay there you

2679
01:31:58,480 --> 01:32:02,719
go just a little bit that's left over is

2680
01:32:00,639 --> 01:32:04,880
enough to contaminate a sample

2681
01:32:02,719 --> 01:32:06,560
so um if you can eliminate those sources

2682
01:32:04,880 --> 01:32:07,360
of contamination and think about that

2683
01:32:06,560 --> 01:32:12,320
when you're doing it

2684
01:32:07,360 --> 01:32:12,320
so um does that answer the question

2685
01:32:16,560 --> 01:32:23,120
so best time to test take soil tests uh

2686
01:32:20,159 --> 01:32:23,760
was yesterday um if yesterday isn't an

2687
01:32:23,120 --> 01:32:27,199
option

2688
01:32:23,760 --> 01:32:30,000
then tomorrow and uh fall i like

2689
01:32:27,199 --> 01:32:31,600
if you want to know um the worst your

2690
01:32:30,000 --> 01:32:33,360
worst case scenario

2691
01:32:31,600 --> 01:32:35,360
spring is best if you want to know your

2692
01:32:33,360 --> 01:32:38,000
best case scenario assuming you

2693
01:32:35,360 --> 01:32:39,280
live in a place that has winters and

2694
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:41,360
that's because

2695
01:32:39,280 --> 01:32:43,199
soil rests over the winter time and

2696
01:32:41,360 --> 01:32:44,800
things become more available generally

2697
01:32:43,199 --> 01:32:46,719
speaking so your numbers and spring will

2698
01:32:44,800 --> 01:32:48,639
generally be higher your numbers and

2699
01:32:46,719 --> 01:32:49,920
fall and so

2700
01:32:48,639 --> 01:32:51,440
whenever you're taking soil tests kind

2701
01:32:49,920 --> 01:32:52,880
of think about what what are the

2702
01:32:51,440 --> 01:32:54,719
questions you're trying to answer the

2703
01:32:52,880 --> 01:32:57,679
results you're trying to get

2704
01:32:54,719 --> 01:32:57,920
because um that will help you to figure

2705
01:32:57,679 --> 01:32:59,120
out

2706
01:32:57,920 --> 01:33:02,000
should i do it now with the original

2707
01:32:59,120 --> 01:33:03,280
sprint and it might change depending on

2708
01:33:02,000 --> 01:33:06,320
whether it's an existing

2709
01:33:03,280 --> 01:33:08,639
field or a new field or there's lots of

2710
01:33:06,320 --> 01:33:11,440
lots of new ones there's no simple

2711
01:33:08,639 --> 01:33:11,440
answer unfortunately

2712
01:33:14,000 --> 01:33:18,239
all right uh yeah i'll stay as long as

2713
01:33:16,320 --> 01:33:20,400
you want to stay but it is um

2714
01:33:18,239 --> 01:33:37,840
the closing remarks happened in three

2715
01:33:20,400 --> 01:33:37,840
minutes yeah

2716
01:33:47,360 --> 01:33:51,840
you need water
