economic impact throughout the Northern

long established family stations through

operate on several pastoral leas at a

time unlike any other industry the

11
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,320
cattle industry has a footprint covering

12
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,480
around 45% of the territory's total land

13
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,440
area it is an industry providing

14
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,160
significant employment opportunities for

Industry Group has been identified as a

18
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,039
priority industry due to the high

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,960
numbers and rates of injury and the

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,120
Hazardous nature of the work NT work

21
00:00:55,960 --> 00:01:00,120
safe has commenced a campaign to assist

22
00:00:58,120 --> 00:01:02,160
station owners to reduce the frequency

23
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,600
of injuries in the industry from the

24
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:06,799
stations visited so far the industry has

25
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,759
demonstrated awareness and commitment to

26
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:11,520
work health and safety this snapshot

managers on the hazards facing the

years well I started out as a as a as

anyone as a station hand on a on a

39
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:45,159
bigger property um I've been through a

40
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,600
few different areas of the industry as I

41
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:50,040
said I've been into the part uh tanning

42
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:52,040
hides and that sort of thing in in that

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,280
sort of area building machinery in that

44
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:56,840
for the agricultural industry um and

45
00:01:54,280 --> 00:02:00,479
moving through on onto the head Stockman

46
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:03,640
rooll overseer and the station man manag

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,960
the opportunity was given to me uh as a

48
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:07,159
as a station manager in central

49
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,720
Queensland on a smaller property um to

50
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:12,000
move to a big move to the bigger

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:15,400
property and really go forward in my

52
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:17,280
career and and take on a bigger role AA

53
00:02:15,400 --> 00:02:19,720
has at least 12 properties in in the

54
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,640
Northern Territory um from brunette on

55
00:02:19,720 --> 00:02:23,720
the Barkley right up to the DAR region

56
00:02:21,640 --> 00:02:26,000
here and obviously the the abire just

57
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,440
out of D we are vertically integrated

58
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:31,599
from a cattle sort of supplyer um into

59
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,800
the beef industry we obviously have a

60
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,000
lot of station managers so we

61
00:02:33,800 --> 00:02:37,680
collectively between us there would be

62
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:39,120
hundreds of years of experience between

63
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,640
all the station managers the general

64
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:44,000
managers that have been in the business

65
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,000
and right up to CEO turn off here so

66
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:48,440
live exporter was was probably the one

67
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,720
of the main ones last year um this year

68
00:02:48,440 --> 00:02:51,680
we're just turning off wieners to

69
00:02:49,720 --> 00:02:53,560
brunette so this year we'll probably

70
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,040
turn off about 8 10,000 wieners down to

71
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:57,400
brunette with our background on the

72
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:59,200
Lakes at brette so yeah so it is it is

73
00:02:57,400 --> 00:03:01,319
very vital that our staff are trained

74
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:03,959
and and managed them cattle in a safe

75
00:03:01,319 --> 00:03:06,519
manner I think going into the company

76
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:08,120
side of things you focus on safety we

77
00:03:06,519 --> 00:03:10,120
want to create a safety culture and

78
00:03:08,120 --> 00:03:12,360
that's from the ground up so our our

79
00:03:10,120 --> 00:03:14,080
staff telling us what they think uh you

80
00:03:12,360 --> 00:03:15,920
know what what is their what is the risk

81
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:17,360
what is the hazards and they have a and

82
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,000
they have the opportunity to voice that

83
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:21,080
to their manager or their next in line

84
00:03:19,000 --> 00:03:22,959
manager and that comes through to the to

85
00:03:21,080 --> 00:03:25,000
the station manager and onto the GMS and

86
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:27,280
onto the board um the board obviously

87
00:03:25,000 --> 00:03:29,799
takes it very seriously and they are

88
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,599
implementing things um for us this

89
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:33,560
station managers and and we communicate

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:35,080
down but we also from a site perspective

91
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:36,640
we want the communication to come up

92
00:03:35,080 --> 00:03:38,480
from the from the guys on the ground the

93
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,680
station hands to tell

94
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,720
us well right at the beginning doesn't

95
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,799
matter what aak property you're on you

96
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:46,439
do a onboarding program the moment they

97
00:03:44,799 --> 00:03:47,599
sign up um so that will start a week

98
00:03:46,439 --> 00:03:49,599
before they actually arrive at the

99
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,480
station uh we spend three or 4 days with

100
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,040
them we'll go right through all the safe

101
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:54,480
working procedures and everything that

102
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:56,319
we have and we'll actually take them to

103
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,159
the yards and we'll work a small M of

104
00:03:56,319 --> 00:04:00,959
cattle uh we'll spend a day on the

105
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:02,720
horses uh we'll shoe and we'll do the

106
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,280
quad bike assessments and the motorbike

107
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:05,720
assessments and we'll have all that

108
00:04:04,280 --> 00:04:07,519
ticked off and we'll have them assessed

109
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:09,280
in the first week and then we work

110
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:12,200
through the training and what we need to

111
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:14,280
go forward with we go through that first

112
00:04:12,200 --> 00:04:16,120
initial assessment um we will set a

113
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:18,120
review date on that and that's done by

114
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,000
myself or the operations manager I made

115
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,720
a very apparent point of that we will

116
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:24,320
talk about safety and we'll have toolbox

117
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:26,160
talks weekly so that's the head Stockman

118
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,800
to his staff and that's on a issue that

119
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:29,759
I've risen or something that I've seen

120
00:04:27,800 --> 00:04:31,520
as as the manager that I want dealt with

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,880
to something that one of the station

122
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,720
staff have actually brought to me and

123
00:04:32,880 --> 00:04:38,759
said I need this communicated up toolbox

124
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,759
talks go up to a safety meeting that we

125
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,039
will generally have once a month and

126
00:04:40,759 --> 00:04:46,199
then uh we have a bigger broader you

127
00:04:43,039 --> 00:04:48,199
know with 27 staff we have a full safety

128
00:04:46,199 --> 00:04:51,280
meeting every 3

129
00:04:48,199 --> 00:04:53,160
months I think outside the box um I'm

130
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:56,639
only young and I and I look look for

131
00:04:53,160 --> 00:04:58,160
things uh since since my management here

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,360
I've identified a few areas that I need

133
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,680
to work on um this year I'm offering a

134
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,919
safety incentive to the staff um so if

135
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:07,320
they come to me with near misses uh any

136
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:08,600
incidents and anything that they want to

137
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:10,680
bring forward there's a there's an

138
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:12,639
initiative there for them we understand

139
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:15,320
the policies and procedures coming from

140
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:18,720
NT work safe and we we identifying the

141
00:05:15,320 --> 00:05:21,039
issues and um seeking you know ways to

142
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:23,720
limit them mainly and this is what we've

143
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,560
identified uh with AO is the you know

144
00:05:23,720 --> 00:05:27,600
the cattle the horses and the and the

145
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,039
motorbikes and the mastering as our main

146
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,360
areas but we certainly don't forget

147
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,600
about the me mecs The Cook The Gardener

148
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,240
they're all involved the maintenance

149
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,759
manager they're all involved in what we

150
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,960
do here for safety we have the low

151
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:40,639
stress stock handling that all the

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,440
station staff here been through and that

153
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:44,360
is something that everyone is aware of

154
00:05:42,440 --> 00:05:45,800
and does very well when you're talking

155
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:47,680
about the wieners we handle the wieners

156
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,680
with low stress and we keep them heers

157
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,319
they come back next year as as Joiner

158
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,680
heers so they've been handled properly

159
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:53,960
they come back the next year as a wet

160
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:55,800
care theyve been through the yards

161
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:57,560
properly low stress handling uh the

162
00:05:55,800 --> 00:05:58,919
staff know how to handle them properly

163
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:00,880
cuz we we put them through the low

164
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:03,240
stress handling School schs but does it

165
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:04,720
actually you know does it actually stop

166
00:06:03,240 --> 00:06:07,479
instance of when you're working with a

167
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:09,360
live animal um it'll be very hard to say

168
00:06:07,479 --> 00:06:12,280
well you know just that alone and a set

169
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,560
of Standards alone would would work in

170
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:17,680
every every

171
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:18,880
case we have a cattle handling procedure

172
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,479
um we go through it with them how to

173
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,800
shut the gates properly how to yard up

174
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:23,680
properly and all that um that is

175
00:06:21,800 --> 00:06:25,440
something we do and we tick off and and

176
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:26,880
all our staff aware of what risks and

177
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:28,080
Hazards are involved around the cattle

178
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:32,000
and around the cattle

179
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:33,440
yards back back back so this is where we

180
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:35,800
you know this is where we can go back to

181
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:38,240
those B we did need to get the training

182
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,240
and the horsemanship skills to a to a

183
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,039
better level here at tiary we felt we

184
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,599
had the expertise to do it instead of

185
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:45,800
getting someone external and paying for

186
00:06:43,599 --> 00:06:48,160
that um we felt we had the expertise and

187
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:49,919
we'd share that with our staff so we

188
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:52,639
went from first round to you know young

189
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:55,479
Green rers from that is they been all

190
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,800
the staff of going from a from a level

191
00:06:55,479 --> 00:06:59,240
to the next level I've initiated this

192
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:01,560
year that we've brought a new Quad baret

193
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,759
it's speed limited to 35 km hour they do

194
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,319
have rollover protection systems on them

195
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,479
uh I've made a conscious decision that

196
00:07:05,319 --> 00:07:09,039
myself the operations manager and the

197
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:10,759
head Stockman are the only ones allowed

198
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,240
to Master on quad bikes other staff are

199
00:07:10,759 --> 00:07:15,560
allowed to fence on them aao policies

200
00:07:13,240 --> 00:07:17,280
that all Riders of quad bikes and and

201
00:07:15,560 --> 00:07:19,080
two wheelers have to have a helmet on

202
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,199
they are commy assessed and they

203
00:07:19,080 --> 00:07:24,160
reassessed every 6 months to get their

204
00:07:22,199 --> 00:07:27,000
attitude right on a quad bike is what

205
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,240
I'm after um but part of it is slowing

206
00:07:27,000 --> 00:07:32,520
the bikes down and the training and we

207
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:35,360
haven't had a quad bike incident this

208
00:07:32,520 --> 00:07:37,960
year mastering out in a lot of like

209
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,639
fixed scrub country and in a remote area

210
00:07:37,960 --> 00:07:42,680
um of implemented GPS units that

211
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,759
actually they use as two ways in GPS if

212
00:07:42,680 --> 00:07:46,240
they get lost uh something happens they

213
00:07:44,759 --> 00:07:49,199
fall off a horse they press a button on

214
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:51,639
the GPS and we know their exact

215
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,879
location definitely retention is one of

216
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:54,800
our biggest things that we we're

217
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:56,879
identifying and and we're working with

218
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:58,520
at AO you know obviously we keep someone

219
00:07:56,879 --> 00:07:59,919
he understands the property and he

220
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:02,199
understands our policies and the

221
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:03,759
motorbikes the horses all that's at a at

222
00:08:02,199 --> 00:08:05,039
a level that we want them to be at to

223
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,840
keep them here we are looking at

224
00:08:05,039 --> 00:08:08,840
offering incentives and and getting that

225
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:11,360
retention rate cuz the cattle industry

226
00:08:08,840 --> 00:08:13,360
and in general the egg industry is a

227
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:15,680
industry that can only keep people for

228
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:17,879
one year 2 years we have a budget and I

229
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,639
have to I have to report to uh general

230
00:08:17,879 --> 00:08:21,319
managers on what my budget is and what I

231
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:22,560
put my money into but looking at the

232
00:08:21,319 --> 00:08:24,080
safety side of things there's things

233
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:25,840
that you don't compromise you measure

234
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:27,720
what is it going to save me in Lost Time

235
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:29,599
staff incidents all that sort of stuff

236
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:31,319
but when you look outside this box it a

237
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,839
few things well you weigh up your

238
00:08:31,319 --> 00:08:34,360
options and most of the time it'll tell

239
00:08:32,839 --> 00:08:36,800
you that you're better off doing it no

240
00:08:34,360 --> 00:08:39,640
matter what the cost is NT work safe

241
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:41,640
come out a month ago I found it very

242
00:08:39,640 --> 00:08:43,399
interactive very positive so it wasn't

243
00:08:41,640 --> 00:08:45,959
about uh what we were doing wrong it was

244
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,399
about just identifying things uh looking

245
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,959
at areas that we can we we can work on

246
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:51,680
the positive for me was it was just an

247
00:08:49,959 --> 00:08:54,160
open discussion some of the issues that

248
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,920
were raised um just minor ones that we

249
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:58,640
just off off the cuff conversation um

250
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:01,079
I've gone and addressed them and I think

251
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,760
you know it's that outside Outsiders

252
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:04,959
perspective the second set of eyes um

253
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:06,360
that just show you look this is

254
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,320
something that you could work with the

255
00:09:06,360 --> 00:09:09,560
regulations and that do I fully

256
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,760
understand all of them we have people

257
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:13,399
that do that for me as a manager for AO

258
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
I have someone that does that for me but

259
00:09:13,399 --> 00:09:18,240
on the ground uh the helping and the

260
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,920
communication from NT work safe is is

261
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,279
what we need well we may not always be

262
00:09:20,920 --> 00:09:24,920
able to get out there uh to assist the

263
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:27,399
guys on the ground and have a look in

264
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:30,399
that at at their at their location we

265
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,440
are still contactable by uh phone and

266
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:34,360
obviously we've got email website as

267
00:09:32,440 --> 00:09:36,399
well a lot of information on the website

268
00:09:34,360 --> 00:09:38,200
that can assist stations and that but by

269
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,360
all means they can give any work safer

270
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:42,160

271
00:09:40,360 --> 00:09:44,560

getting hurt the most and I it's wider

321
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:43,040
across the whole industry um I think you

322
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,480
know it's a little bit to do with ego

323
00:11:43,040 --> 00:11:46,880
going straight out of school getting

324
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:48,880
away from your parents and getting full

325
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,560
of confidence you know showing off in

326
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,440
front of your mate so you know basically

327
00:11:50,560 --> 00:11:54,240
that's why we we got to train our people

328
00:11:52,440 --> 00:11:55,639
we got to we got to get them going and

329
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:57,560
get them thinking right get a get a

330
00:11:55,639 --> 00:11:58,880
culture developed so they're they're

331
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:01,000
thinking about what they're doing and

332
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:02,600
they not just racing into things and

333
00:12:01,000 --> 00:12:04,839
getting themselves hurt at the end of

334
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:07,560
the day that's that's where safety

335
00:12:04,839 --> 00:12:09,279
really comes into its own it can be very

336
00:12:07,560 --> 00:12:11,000
tough to handle you know I was young

337
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,399
like that once myself I know exactly

338
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:17,160
what I was like um but basically just I

339
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:18,519
think you just got to just got to work

340
00:12:17,160 --> 00:12:20,519
through it your first couple of weeks

341
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:23,079
are your hardest you just got to work

342
00:12:20,519 --> 00:12:26,320
through it and really you know get them

343
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:28,440
thinking um you know all the training we

344
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:32,800
doing constant reminders you know

345
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:34,920
toolbox to each each month um and and

346
00:12:32,800 --> 00:12:36,880
having meetings just just just making

347
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:38,480
them aware you know we might we might

348
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,440
have been lucky and not got to had any

349
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:41,959
incidents but just making aware the

350
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:45,279
incidents that are

351
00:12:41,959 --> 00:12:46,680
happening when we um our employees to

352
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,920

throughout them um and they came out

367
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:25,959
here to mamboo and U we basically um

368
00:13:24,040 --> 00:13:28,399
just stepped them through some basic

369
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:30,519
horse riding we asked them to do a self

370
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,040
assessment of their Ro riding then we

371
00:13:30,519 --> 00:13:33,680
had a couple of horses around that are

372
00:13:32,040 --> 00:13:35,360
Fairly reliable horses you know they're

373
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:38,320
quiet and nothing's going to go wrong

374
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:40,320
with them got them catching them and um

375
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:41,720
you riding them and safely handling

376
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:43,079
basically getting getting them them take

377
00:13:41,720 --> 00:13:45,360
their hips away so they're not horses

378
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:47,600
not kicking and just working with the

379
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,199
animal and then they do about 3 days of

380
00:13:47,600 --> 00:13:51,600
that mind you they're not they're not

381
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:53,120
totally right to go for the job but

382
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:56,240
they've got to start and they know how

383
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,759
to keep themselves safe uh safe so yeah

384
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,920
they can improve from there um and with

385
00:13:58,759 --> 00:14:02,959
the low stress stock handling they go

386
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:05,120
right down to basic stuff for opening

387
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,920
shutting Gates moving cattle making sure

388
00:14:05,120 --> 00:14:08,920
cattle have water and moving cattle

389
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:11,160
around the yard safely so everything you

390
00:14:08,920 --> 00:14:13,800
know can be as safe as

391
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:17,240
possible we're trying to um basically

392
00:14:13,800 --> 00:14:19,440
develop a culture here of um just having

393
00:14:17,240 --> 00:14:21,600
an understanding and an awareness for

394
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:23,920
safety but because we basically live all

395
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,800
live here together um you know it's our

396
00:14:23,920 --> 00:14:27,360
home as well as our workplace I think

397
00:14:25,800 --> 00:14:29,600
we're just trying to develop an

398
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,240
awareness and understanding and start to

399
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:34,639
take responsibility of where we are when

400
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:37,480
it when it comes to safety um yeah it's

401
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:42,079
a joint effort for all of us not just

402
00:14:37,480 --> 00:14:42,079
just me barking down the shots to to my

403
00:14:43,399 --> 00:14:49,000
staff our RS have being cattle horses

404
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,440
and motorbikes after the induction

405
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:54,120
training program of horses myself and my

406
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:56,560
head Stockman we assess assess our own

407
00:14:54,120 --> 00:14:58,920
stuff here on Manalo again um and just

408
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:00,639
watch them ride and allocate horses to

409
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:02,000
the their level and then just step

410
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:03,759
through the training like that that's

411
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:05,639
ongoing the horsemanship training all

412
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:07,639
year it's it's a constant Improvement

413
00:15:05,639 --> 00:15:11,160
like I still got Improvement we all do

414
00:15:07,639 --> 00:15:13,040
so with motorbikes um we carry out we do

415
00:15:11,160 --> 00:15:15,480
some training with Charles Darwin with

416
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:17,880
their motorbike experts and then then

417
00:15:15,480 --> 00:15:19,440
basically they we come out here and I

418
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:21,920
only try to allocate one or two people

419
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,560
to ride the motorbike and then we step

420
00:15:21,920 --> 00:15:25,959
them through make sure they're all right

421
00:15:23,560 --> 00:15:28,000
they got you know they know how to ride

422
00:15:25,959 --> 00:15:29,800
safely motorbike is a big risk because

423
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,079
you can be out in a padic riding around

424
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:34,000
on a MOBA cattle and there's a log lying

425
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:35,800
in Long Grass and that's all it takes

426
00:15:34,000 --> 00:15:37,920
you might only be idling along and you

427
00:15:35,800 --> 00:15:40,199
can fall off and and injure injure

428
00:15:37,920 --> 00:15:42,399
yourself so just trying to get awareness

429
00:15:40,199 --> 00:15:44,560
into them and um you know just

430
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:45,959
understand that um you know there could

431
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,560
be an issue and we're trying to trying

432
00:15:45,959 --> 00:15:51,000
to avoid it I believe low stress stock

433
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:52,959
handling definitely uh takes away a lot

434
00:15:51,000 --> 00:15:54,759
of the risk it'll never totally take it

435
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,839
away cuz we we're dealing with animals

436
00:15:54,759 --> 00:15:59,040
at the end of the day and they can be

437
00:15:56,839 --> 00:16:01,199
unpredictable I think it's a huge advant

438
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:03,440
manage our um our stock only come into

439
00:16:01,199 --> 00:16:05,440
the yard some twice a year some only

440
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:08,319
once a year and a small percentage only

441
00:16:05,440 --> 00:16:10,880
every couple of years so um using low

442
00:16:08,319 --> 00:16:13,759
stress techniques as long as we we stick

443
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:15,839
to it all the time each year the ATT of

444
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,800
the cattle just improve they're used to

445
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:19,800
being handled in a good way you know

446
00:16:17,800 --> 00:16:21,000
they become easy to put through the yard

447
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:23,279
become a pleasure to put through the

448
00:16:21,000 --> 00:16:25,639
yard like I um I remember when I first

449
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:27,839
started um in the Northern Territory

450
00:16:25,639 --> 00:16:29,759
chasing cattle in they used to see you

451
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:31,480
be in the stockyard and Gates would fly

452
00:16:29,759 --> 00:16:33,360
back open cattle running back over the

453
00:16:31,480 --> 00:16:35,319
top of you I've heard of incidents in

454
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:37,759
the last 5 6 years but I haven't

455
00:16:35,319 --> 00:16:39,839
actually seen a cow run back and smash a

456
00:16:37,759 --> 00:16:42,800
gate in the last 5

457
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:44,000
years we've been using quad bikes for as

458
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:46,839
long as I can remember there's been

459
00:16:44,000 --> 00:16:48,560
quads around um but at current at

460
00:16:46,839 --> 00:16:50,639
current stage cuz they're being

461
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,440
identified as such a danger I think they

462
00:16:50,639 --> 00:16:56,399
will become phased out the sidebyside

463
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,959
ATV we got um yeah it'll probably

464
00:16:56,399 --> 00:17:00,839
that'll that'll take over and um you

465
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,360
know replace a quad by it's being an

466
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,160
alternative use and seem to be a bit

467
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,600
safer you know seat belt and have a roof

468
00:17:05,160 --> 00:17:09,679
on it for Roll by protection that so I

469
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,679
think I definitely feel that's a way

470
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:14,640
things will go all our staff have run

471
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:18,000
through chemical training at CDU they do

472
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:20,520
their uh chemer or the other equivalents

473
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:22,559
you know cuz chemicals are are a part of

474
00:17:20,520 --> 00:17:24,559
it but yeah we've got a process where

475
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:26,039
everyone goes through that training and

476
00:17:24,559 --> 00:17:27,679
when they come onto the station and they

477
00:17:26,039 --> 00:17:29,720
have to undertake some Camel handling

478
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:30,919
we've got records there have to keep you

479
00:17:29,720 --> 00:17:33,880
know they're recording what they're

480
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:36,360
doing where they're doing it and what

481
00:17:33,880 --> 00:17:39,640
what they're doing it for in our our

482
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:41,679
chemical shed we have the MSDS sheets on

483
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:43,880
hand um for all our chemicals that we

484
00:17:41,679 --> 00:17:45,799
use um they're provided there for the

485
00:17:43,880 --> 00:17:48,480
staff if they an incident happens and

486
00:17:45,799 --> 00:17:50,880
know how to treat it um how to use it

487
00:17:48,480 --> 00:17:52,600
what PPE they need to use for it uh we

488
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:54,520
also have it on hand in the office so

489
00:17:52,600 --> 00:17:57,760
there's a second copy

490
00:17:54,520 --> 00:17:59,720
available work safe and um were out

491
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:04,400
earlier this year they basically just

492
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:05,840
did a had a visit and um yeah just ran

493
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:08,760
had to look at things and what what

494
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,159
we're doing to try and uh mitigate our

495
00:18:08,760 --> 00:18:13,440
risk it was fairly daunting expecting

496
00:18:11,159 --> 00:18:16,080
them to come cuz from what you know in

497
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,400
the industry have heard of other places

498
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,400
and in the past yeah they're coming to

499
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:22,440
kick your bum really um that's what

500
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:23,960
that's what the general feel was of it

501
00:18:22,440 --> 00:18:25,280
but when they turned up it was really

502
00:18:23,960 --> 00:18:28,039
good we just stepped through the paces

503
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:29,640
of it um doing we first we um just did a

504
00:18:28,039 --> 00:18:31,520
bit of a basic induction with them and

505
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,799
then talked about our policies and

506
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:35,640
procedures and just worked walked around

507
00:18:33,799 --> 00:18:37,280
and they just had a look at things and

508
00:18:35,640 --> 00:18:40,559
yeah it was fairly smooth I think it was

509
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:42,159
good mainly peace of mind and knowing

510
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:43,280
maybe they're not so bad you know

511
00:18:42,159 --> 00:18:44,880
they're they they're probably just

512
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:48,799
trying to help too and do their job

513
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:51,039
rather than um bullly into into things

514
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:52,960
yeah definitely having work safe um

515
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,280
coming on board this year and the role

516
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:57,480
of being you know there as an advisor

517
00:18:55,280 --> 00:19:00,679
and it's being there to help us rather

518
00:18:57,480 --> 00:19:02,320
than hammer us um it's definitely like

519
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:04,840
we got all the policies and procedures

520
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:06,919
in place and um you know them coming on

521
00:19:04,840 --> 00:19:09,360
board and supporting what we're doing

522
00:19:06,919 --> 00:19:11,320
you know it it gives you a lot lot of

523
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,880
confidence in knowing that uh what

524
00:19:11,320 --> 00:19:13,559
you're doing is right and your people

525
00:19:12,880 --> 00:19:15,799
you

526
00:19:13,559 --> 00:19:18,280
know people are the key at the end of

527
00:19:15,799 --> 00:19:19,880
the day we do make money out of cattle

528
00:19:18,280 --> 00:19:22,520
but you know you can't do none of that

529
00:19:19,880 --> 00:19:24,120
without your people um so at the end of

530
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:26,919
the day if they they're able to come

531
00:19:24,120 --> 00:19:28,360
home safe um and our policies and that

532
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:31,039
are helping that happen you know I

533
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,360
definitely think it's it's it's better

534
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,320
rather than worse you know definitely

535
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:36,240
moving

536
00:19:33,320 --> 00:19:38,440
forward I don't believe uh it's it's got

537
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,480
to be an expensive task I believe that

538
00:19:38,440 --> 00:19:42,960
some of the systems uh that they can be

539
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:44,799
implemented on on site are rather simple

540
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:47,799
and can be maintained with minimum of

541
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:49,480
fuss it's it's um and I think uh by

542
00:19:47,799 --> 00:19:52,159
doing so you're going to reduce the

543
00:19:49,480 --> 00:19:55,039
number of uh incident rates on your uh

544
00:19:52,159 --> 00:19:57,520
on your farm or your station and in

545
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:59,840
industrywide level if that uh if those

546
00:19:57,520 --> 00:20:01,520
incident rates uh begin to fall over a

547
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:04,159
period of time that can only be good for

548
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:06,360
the industry both in a productivity

549
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,679
sense as well as their bottom

550
00:20:06,360 --> 00:20:12,880
line uh I've been involved in uh

551
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:16,200
Insurance in underwriting and broking uh

552
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:19,280
for the last 40 odd years and uh of

553
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,320
those spent many years offering services

554
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,840
to the uh Cattleman's Association of the

555
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:27,000
Northern Territory when you do o health

556
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:30,360
and safety there's not immediate returns

557
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:33,120
it's a longterm plan program you you

558
00:20:30,360 --> 00:20:36,000
need to implement it and then reap the

559
00:20:33,120 --> 00:20:38,159
rewards as you go forward it's not

560
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,919
instantaneously because whilst you might

561
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:41,280
have had 5 years of bad claims and

562
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,360
implement the o health and safety

563
00:20:41,280 --> 00:20:47,559
Service uh program you to to get a

564
00:20:44,360 --> 00:20:49,960
better work safe situation the problem

565
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:52,000
is that you've still got 5 years of

566
00:20:49,960 --> 00:20:53,360
really bad record so you've got to get

567
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,120
rid of that so you got to have one year

568
00:20:53,360 --> 00:20:58,440
good one year maybe bit better or or not

569
00:20:56,120 --> 00:21:00,320
as bad and then the insurance company

570
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,679
can and then work with you to see that

571
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:04,600
yes you're on the right track then the

572
00:21:02,679 --> 00:21:06,360
benefits of the savings will come if

573
00:21:04,600 --> 00:21:08,440
anybody's looking for Quick Fix it's not

574
00:21:06,360 --> 00:21:10,600
going to happen that way it's going to

575
00:21:08,440 --> 00:21:12,600
be a long-term

576
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,760
situation obviously given that the

577
00:21:12,600 --> 00:21:16,520
Northern Territory does have a vast uh

578
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,039
land mass in that and some of these

579
00:21:16,520 --> 00:21:21,360
stations are quite remote uh it's not

580
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:23,679
just restricted to us coming out there

581
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:25,640
and uh visiting them uh while we we

582
00:21:23,679 --> 00:21:29,200
intend to try and do that as part of the

583
00:21:25,640 --> 00:21:31,840
campaign uh if they uh require any um

584
00:21:29,200 --> 00:21:33,720

00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:35,919

whatever we can just because they make

00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,279
