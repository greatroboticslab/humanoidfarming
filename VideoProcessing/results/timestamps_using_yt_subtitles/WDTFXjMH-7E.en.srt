00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,439
hello everyone welcome back to our

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,279
channel so for today's video we are

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,000
going to do on monsoon

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:09,040
and its current status of the monsoon in

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:12,639
india as well as

6
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:15,360
its impact on agriculture okay so um

7
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:17,039
and we're also trying to do some few

8
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,720
questions we're going to solve them

9
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,480
as well as we're going to explain some

10
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,560
of the questions and

11
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,480
uh which is very important from the exam

12
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,560
point of view especially for this

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,560
aggregatology i think at least about one

14
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,400
or two questions high counselors of at

15
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:31,119
least minimum of two questions coming

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,760
from this

17
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,320
topic okay so guys watch this video till

18
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:36,320
the end

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,360

21
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,760
in horticulture and i've also completed

22
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,600
my post-graduation and dermatology in

23
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,280
agriculture okay

24
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:47,120

as well

33
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:03,840
so um if your first slide we are going

34
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:06,240
to talk something about this monsoon how

35
00:01:03,840 --> 00:01:07,040
uh so there has been an increase in

36
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,159
sowing

37
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,520
uh because of the good monsoon by 87 so

38
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,640
we're just gonna have a

39
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:16,799
rough talk and rough overview about the

40
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,600
monsoon in general right as well as in

41
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,759
the uh indian economy and agriculture

42
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:24,080
so the first line here sees about thirds

43
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:26,720
of the indus manufacturing outfit

44
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:28,640
which makes up about eighteen percent of

45
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:31,200
the country's gross domestic product

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,560
is linked to agriculture and therefore

47
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,200
into the food right

48
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,640
and the second point here is the monsoon

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,960
it is a lifeboat

50
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,720
uh basically for indian agriculture and

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,119
it depended on about

52
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,040
2 trillion dollars of economy and at

53
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
least half of the farmlands are rain fed

54
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:49,520
and when we're gonna talk about wing fed

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,000
rain fed areas are the areas or the

56
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,399
farms

57
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:54,799
where there is no facility for

58
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,960
irrigation no irrigating facilities

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,040
so they are totally dependent on

60
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:01,360
rainfall for the crop production

61
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,840
all right and now this in this

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,399
agriculture sector they also account for

63
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:08,479
about

64
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:09,679
14 of the country's uh 2.7 trillion

65
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,920
crammy which is the

66
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:13,760
one one uh which we were talking about

67
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
and about 42

68
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:17,840
of the total employment so agriculture

69
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,400
is a huge sector where

70
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,879
it gives about majority almost half of

71
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:26,080
the employment comes to agriculture

72
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:28,480
practices in india okay and 55 percent

73
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,760
of the indus arable land dependent on

74
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,640
precipitation right

75
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,239
so when you say 55 it means basically

76
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:37,280
it's a rainfall

77
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:40,640
farms or the rain fed lens okay um

78
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,040
so 55 of it these are

79
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,440
completely dependent on precipitation so

80
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,519
precipitation is just another word for

81
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:49,680
rainfall right so i hope this is clear

82
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,360
and now let's move on to our new

83
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:52,959
slides where we're going to talk why

84
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,760
there is an increase how

85
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:58,000
zarin increased so basically uh due to

86
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,400
the good rainfall in the month of june

87
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:04,239
the basic important key crop sewing

88
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:07,599
areas that have increased by about 87

89
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,319
and when we compare this percentage to

90
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
the last

91
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,599
year so there has been increased by 87

92
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:14,720
percent there is

93
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:16,640
huge range right so uh rice cultivation

94
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
is basically a curved crop

95
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,480
so right now in the modern season rice

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,440
is a major curry crop so they are

97
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,080
growing this

98
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,040
at a huge amount of number at a huge

99
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:27,280
area okay

100
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:30,080
so these are grown nearly 40 percent of

101
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,519
the total area during the curry crop

102
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:36,319
season and is up to about 39

103
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,840
okay so the oil seeds they have risen

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:40,319
more than three times

105
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
of its normal production and the

106
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:43,440
cultivation

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,040
and as if you're going to talk about

108
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,280
pulses then it has

109
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,120
had a piece of about quadruplet which

110
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,319
means four times okay

111
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:55,519
so um these are something overview about

112
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:58,879
these monsoons and especially as

113
00:03:55,519 --> 00:04:01,840
rice is a very water intensive um

114
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,319
crop so i think a lot of water is needed

115
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:04,959
so

116
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:06,239
due to this uh good rainfall in this

117
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,920
year in june so

118
00:04:06,239 --> 00:04:10,239
the right production is also high

119
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:12,799
chances of rice production as well

120
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:14,799
um states like bihar punjab and harvard

121
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,600
they are one of the major moving

122
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:18,239
agriculture states in our country where

123
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,160
they have

124
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:23,360
grown where they grow a lot of career

125
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:24,000
season especially for rice wheat maize

126
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:27,120
all of that

127
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,360
pulses especially these are the main

128
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,600
good monsoon they also helped the

129
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,680
farmers increase the sowing area

130
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:34,960
okay so these are some of the overview

131
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:37,680
and some of the impact

132
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,400
that this monsoon has on the indian

133
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:42,080
economy

134
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:44,639
is that these are um basically uh

135
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:45,199
the monsoon they have a direct impact on

136
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:47,600
the

137
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,520
country's agricultural gdp right so the

138
00:04:47,600 --> 00:04:52,080
planting of this key career

139
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:53,280
season which is the season for now are

140
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,240
the summer crops like

141
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:58,000
rice sugarcane pulses and oil seeds they

142
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,240
begin with the arrival or the

143
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:01,360
onset of the monsoon rains in the june

144
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:02,880
right and

145
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,560
due to this when you have a good

146
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:05,280
production when there's a good rainfall

147
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:07,840
the quality

148
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,880
the quantity of and the sowing area will

149
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:10,080
also increase

150
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,639
and therefore there'll be higher

151
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,600
production and in the end they'll have a

152
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,080
better income

153
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:17,199
right so and even uh the summer crops

154
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,759
they also account for

155
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,199
almost half of indus food output and

156
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,919
delayed or the per me

157
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:25,919
monsoon it means issues and acceleration

158
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,280
in the food inflation as well

159
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:29,520
so this is also a problem so if you have

160
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:32,720
a

161
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,960
good output to the summer product uh

162
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:37,199
the summer crops they are the major

163
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:40,000
crops for the indus food output

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:40,560
and there will be if the monsoon is poor

165
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:42,880
the

166
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,000
production will also be lesser and

167
00:05:42,880 --> 00:05:46,479
therefore there will be

168
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:47,120
uh supply issues and sublime as they

169
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,440
will be

170
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:50,320
having a smooth inflation okay so

171
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,479
another point

172
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:54,800
that i want to focus here is that

173
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,440
especially in a poor monsoon they'd also

174
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,319
not

175
00:05:55,440 --> 00:05:59,600
lead to demand or to weak demand or

176
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,240
fast-moving

177
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:04,880
consumer goods as well if the

178
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,520
two-wheelers attractors rural housing

179
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:08,319
sectors all of these will also have an

180
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:10,479
impact

181
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:12,800
uh by the import of this essential food

182
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:14,720
staples and they will also force

183
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:16,319
the government to take measures like

184
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:19,440
lone waves and thereby

185
00:06:16,319 --> 00:06:20,800
they will also put more pressure on the

186
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,520
finances as well

187
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:25,600
another important point is that a weak

188
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:28,479
monsoon is strong

189
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:30,639
correlate is strongly correlated to the

190
00:06:28,479 --> 00:06:33,759
receding water table in the ground

191
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:34,720
and this will also worsen the farmer's

192
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:36,960
distress

193
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:38,960
okay so these are some of the impacts

194
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:39,840
that this monsoon has on indian

195
00:06:38,960 --> 00:06:42,160
agriculture

196
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,960
and thereby on an indian economy i hope

197
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:45,039
this is clear

198
00:06:42,960 --> 00:06:46,479
um now let's move on to another slide

199
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,960
where i've just given some

200
00:06:46,479 --> 00:06:49,759
a variable uh brainful variability in

201
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:51,680
india right

202
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,280
so basically in rainfall where we talk

203
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:55,680
about the rate for variability in

204
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:56,639
the indian subcontinent they continue uh

205
00:06:55,680 --> 00:06:58,639
they receive its

206
00:06:56,639 --> 00:07:01,120
annual rainfall by the speculative

207
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,080
phenomenon um which we call it monsoons

208
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:04,319
right and

209
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,199
basically it's consists of a cyclone

210
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:08,240
that arrives

211
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,400
in the indian ocean okay and this uh

212
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:11,919
cyclone in the indian ocean they travel

213
00:07:10,400 --> 00:07:13,919
in the northeast direction

214
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,440
towards that side and they enter the

215
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:18,160
peninsula region

216
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,960
along its west coast so the cup they go

217
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:22,240
around the whole

218
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:24,400
peninsula indian region and they enter

219
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,440
to the west coast all right so some of

220
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,400
the important

221
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:30,000
um radial variability or the type of

222
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,720
monsoon systems in

223
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
india that we can find uh the major two

224
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,280
ones are

225
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,680
southwest monsoon as you can see here

226
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
the first point and we also have a

227
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,919
northwest monsoon

228
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,680
right so we also have a winter rainfall

229
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:45,759
as fellas in the summer rainfall

230
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:47,759
and let me just briefly talk about what

231
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:48,879
this uh southeast monsoon northeast

232
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:52,080
monster exam

233
00:07:48,879 --> 00:07:54,000
all of these are okay so um this

234
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,360
first thing this southeast monsoon this

235
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,840
is one of the most important

236
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,280
of monsoon season in india as it

237
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,240
contributes to about about

238
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:03,039
80 to 90 of the total rainfall in the

239
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,280
country

240
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:06,080
uh the this is one of the most important

241
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,479
cycles

242
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,720
of cyclone cycles and they usually occur

243
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,759
in the month of june to september

244
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:15,680
and this results in the mons summer

245
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:16,879
monsoon so it's southwest monsoon is

246
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:19,199
also known as the

247
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,800
summer monster right and now let's go to

248
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,080
our second point which is on the

249
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
northeast monsoon

250
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,120
so uh in northeast monsoon these are

251
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,599
these

252
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,160
august during the month of september and

253
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:30,400
right

254
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:32,000
so the northwest monsoon they penetrate

255
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:34,399
through northwestern

256
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:35,440
india and but it stays a full month in

257
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:38,399
the eastern

258
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:39,839
india which is in bengal okay so um

259
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:41,599
these are some of the things on the

260
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:43,360
northwest mountain i think that's

261
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:44,959
enough for you all to know and we also

262
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
have winter rainfall

263
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,880
so it's winter rainfall it is mostly

264
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,200
restricted to the northern area

265
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:52,320
or the northern indian and it is

266
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:55,200
basically uh

267
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:56,720
suppose if it's in the hilly regions or

268
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,360
the marlin regions then it will

269
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,399
form in the form of a snow and if it's

270
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:03,600
in plain regions

271
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:05,519
then rains or come okay

272
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:07,519
so these are something on the winter

273
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,360
rainfall and now lastly we're going to

274
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:12,320
talk about this summer rainfall

275
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:14,399
so in summer rainfall this uh the

276
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:14,800
rainfall is basically received in the

277
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:17,920
march

278
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:21,040
of march um to may okay

279
00:09:17,920 --> 00:09:22,000
so so these are which is received during

280
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,080
this summer months

281
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,240
as a local storms right so these are

282
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:28,800
mostly received in the southeast of the

283
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:30,880
peninsula or in the west bengal right

284
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:33,040
so basically the western indian sign

285
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:35,200
they are not generally

286
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,240
affected by this summer rainfall or they

287
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,480
do not receive

288
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:40,240
this rainfall okay so these are

289
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,000
something important uh

290
00:09:40,240 --> 00:09:43,600
points it's not really important from

291
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,519
the exam point of view but i think uh

292
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:46,720
it's very important to at least know the

293
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:50,000
types of monsoons in

294
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,320
india that we have all right

295
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
and now let's go to another question uh

296
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,959
over the question series the first

297
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,800
option says the crops region the crop

298
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:00,160
region they are classified based on

299
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,920
average rainfall okay

300
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
and which of the following range comes

301
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:06,160
under this semi-annual region

302
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,519
so based on the uh rainfall received

303
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:09,600
annually these field

304
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:10,959
uh they have classified these regions

305
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:13,600
into different

306
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:14,560
regions right um the first option given

307
00:10:13,600 --> 00:10:18,240
here is

308
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:21,440
less than 500 number bc is 500 to 700

309
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:25,040
number c is 750 to 1000

310
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:25,600
number d is 1000 to 1500 and number e is

311
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:28,880
more than

312
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:32,240
1500 right so right answer for this is

313
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:35,120
700 500 to 750 okay so

314
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:37,200
based here if you can see the uh lower

315
00:10:35,120 --> 00:10:39,920
table i've given on the left hand side

316
00:10:37,200 --> 00:10:41,920
given the rainfall in the meter and on

317
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:43,600
the right hand side you can see the

318
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:46,399
climatic regions all right

319
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,680
so um this table is very important guys

320
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:48,720
if you guys are learning it for the

321
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:51,040
first time

322
00:10:48,720 --> 00:10:53,040
please remember i would request you all

323
00:10:51,040 --> 00:10:55,200
to take a screenshot of the screen

324
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:57,120
and you can also jot it down if you're

325
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,200
having a notepad besides you can just

326
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:02,640
pause the video and jot it down okay

327
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:05,040
so okay first thing less than 500 it is

328
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:06,480
in the arabic region right and we have

329
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:10,240
500 to 700

330
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:11,120
means in this semi-arid region uh 750 to

331
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:14,480
1000

332
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:17,360
it's in the suburbs and more than 1000

333
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:19,360
it's in the humid so these are the lists

334
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,800
of the rainfall ranges as well as along

335
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,279
with the regions all right

336
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:25,440
so i think this is very important from

337
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,079
uh high chances of this question coming

338
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:28,480
and exam

339
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:30,480
okay another one here is on the

340
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,959
reflected solar radiation

341
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:33,680
without any change in quality is known

342
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:35,760
as

343
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:36,959
the options given here are the radiation

344
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,440
flux number b

345
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,000
is emission power number c is alberto

346
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:42,720
number d

347
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,760
is latent heat and we also have from the

348
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,880
huge safe

349
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,600
sensible heat affection okay so guys the

350
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:51,519
right answer for this is alberto so el

351
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,160
pedu what is this alberto it is

352
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,040
basically

353
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:56,000
just the measurement of the reflectivity

354
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:58,480
of an object

355
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:59,600
okay so the solar radiation enters the

356
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:02,480
earth right

357
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:03,120
and soft these are absorbed and soft

358
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:05,680
these are

359
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:07,120
reflected back so alberto is basically

360
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,160
the reflected pack without

361
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:11,839
any change these are the uh radiations

362
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,480
solar radiations which are reflected

363
00:12:11,839 --> 00:12:14,399
back without

364
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,760
any change in its quantity or the

365
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:19,279
quality okay

366
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:21,120
so this is what an albedo is okay so in

367
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:24,079
other words if there's a measure

368
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,639
of the diffuse reflection of the solar

369
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,279
radiation out of this total radiation

370
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:30,240
received by an astronomical body so

371
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:32,480
according to this

372
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,680
definition we can say that every object

373
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,440
has different

374
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:39,200
alberto okay in this point i have given

375
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,480
this a very important point i've given

376
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:44,320
some of the alberto um percentages of

377
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,560
different elements okay the first one is

378
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,279
for the pure water so pure water is an

379
00:12:46,560 --> 00:12:50,079
albedo for

380
00:12:47,279 --> 00:12:51,200
about five to twenty percent okay and

381
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:54,240
we're going to talk about

382
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:58,000
vegetation it's about 10 to 40 percent

383
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:00,079
and for soil it's about 15 to 50 percent

384
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,920
and if we're going to talk about earth

385
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:04,800
we have about 34 to

386
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,360
43 so roughly we're going to talk a

387
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:07,600
static

388
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
average for earth then they say it's

389
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,519
about 35

390
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:13,519
okay and if it's for clouds then we have

391
00:13:11,519 --> 00:13:15,120
about 55

392
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:16,560
and especially at this point if you're

393
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,560
gonna come down here

394
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,800
uh when you talk about plans for the

395
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:22,880
plant community this albedo

396
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:24,639
the absorption of sorry the reflection

397
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,519
of the soil radiation

398
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:29,360
they depend on the first thing is on the

399
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:31,279
age of the crop the second is the

400
00:13:29,360 --> 00:13:33,360
percentage of the ground cover

401
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:34,880
as well as the last one is and the color

402
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,519
and reflectivity

403
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,800
of the foliage okay guys so these are

404
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,880
some of the points on elbow

405
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,800
that you actually to remember another

406
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,560
point is that here on earth especially

407
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:46,560
the albedo effect they have a very

408
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:49,040
significant impact on the

409
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,279
climate as well so at the lower the

410
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,320
elbow right to lower the percentage of

411
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,079
the elbow

412
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,320
the more radiation from the sun that

413
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:58,560
gets absorbed by the planet okay

414
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,240
and therefore the temperature will rise

415
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,199
but if the albedo is higher

416
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:04,800
then the earth is more reflective and

417
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:07,519
more of the radiation

418
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,240
is returned to the space and the planet

419
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:11,600
cools

420
00:14:08,240 --> 00:14:12,880
so these are something on so you can

421
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:15,120
you're getting the pattern right it's a

422
00:14:12,880 --> 00:14:16,240
vegetation it's about it's towards the

423
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:18,800
highest so

424
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:19,839
we have more vegetation ground cover

425
00:14:18,800 --> 00:14:22,880
then definitely

426
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:26,959
the earth will be lesser um less cool

427
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:28,720
um sorry will be cooler okay so um

428
00:14:26,959 --> 00:14:31,440
uh in the question you can see that we

429
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:34,399
have already come across a few of the

430
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:35,519
uh state a few of the definite a few of

431
00:14:34,399 --> 00:14:37,279
the terms right

432
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:39,760
so now let us understand what these

433
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:41,199
terms are okay so base the first one is

434
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:43,680
and the radiation flux

435
00:14:41,199 --> 00:14:45,440
so uh radiation flux uh these are the

436
00:14:43,680 --> 00:14:46,240
amounts of gradient energy which are

437
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:48,399
emitted

438
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:49,360
as well as which are received and

439
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:51,760
transmitted

440
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,760
across a particular area and this is

441
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:55,440
known as the radiant flux okay

442
00:14:53,760 --> 00:14:57,120
and the second one here is on the

443
00:14:55,440 --> 00:14:59,920
emissive power

444
00:14:57,120 --> 00:15:01,120
so when you have the radiant uh

445
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,000
radiation flux

446
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:06,160
the density of this radiant flush is

447
00:15:04,000 --> 00:15:09,360
basically emitted by a source right

448
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,399
and this is called aster emissive power

449
00:15:09,360 --> 00:15:13,040
okay so this is what an emissive power

450
00:15:12,399 --> 00:15:14,720
is and

451
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,320
alberto we have already discussed what

452
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,959
an albedo is and

453
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:21,839
now we have a latent heat so a latent

454
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:25,360
heat is a part of an incident radiation

455
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:28,000
on the surface if absorbed and while

456
00:15:25,360 --> 00:15:30,079
a part of it is reflected and the

457
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:31,120
remaining is basically transmitted so

458
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,240
these are

459
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:36,480
uh latent heat what a latent heat is

460
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:37,440
so we also have the last option was

461
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:39,199
given here

462
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,959
the last option given here is on the

463
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,199
sensible heat direction right

464
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:45,279
so sensible heat infection as well as

465
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,920
sensation heat the other types of this

466
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:47,680
energy

467
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,279
which are basically released or absorbed

468
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:50,959
in the atmosphere okay

469
00:15:49,279 --> 00:15:53,199
but this latent heat these are most

470
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:55,040
related to the changes in the phase of

471
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,759
between the liquids the gases and the

472
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:57,519
solids

473
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,519
whereas in the sensible heat these are

474
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:02,079
mostly related to the temperature

475
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:03,600
which are of the gas or the objects with

476
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:06,160
no change in the face

477
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,320
right so an example all right so these

478
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:08,720
are some of the terms the definitions of

479
00:16:08,320 --> 00:16:10,480
this

480
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
so try to know the at least the

481
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:13,600
definitions i think

482
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,880
just know your definition will offer

483
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:17,440
survives okay

484
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:19,839
all right so um let's go to another

485
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,800
slide which is

486
00:16:19,839 --> 00:16:24,639
on which of the following crop is or

487
00:16:22,800 --> 00:16:26,160
considered as a short day plan so this

488
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:29,120
is a very easy question

489
00:16:26,160 --> 00:16:30,880
again but very important okay so the

490
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:33,519
options given here are number a

491
00:16:30,880 --> 00:16:34,160
is potato we have b which is rice then

492
00:16:33,519 --> 00:16:36,959
you have c

493
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:36,959
which is wheat

494
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,839
so guys the right answer for this is

495
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:44,800
rice

496
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:47,759
rice is the short day plant right so now

497
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:50,480
let us talk about this duration of

498
00:16:47,759 --> 00:16:51,759
light right so based on the

499
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:53,920
classification

500
00:16:51,759 --> 00:16:56,000
of these plants these are based

501
00:16:53,920 --> 00:16:57,639
classified into a few groups three

502
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:58,800
groups mainly on the basis of

503
00:16:57,639 --> 00:17:00,240
photoperiodism

504
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:02,800
and if you're going to ask what is a

505
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:04,720
protoperiodism a photoperiodism is a

506
00:17:02,800 --> 00:17:08,079
response of a plan to the

507
00:17:04,720 --> 00:17:08,400
relative length of the day and night and

508
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,799
this

509
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:13,760
is known as photopurism okay and this

510
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:15,439
would be radism it influences

511
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:16,880
the planned character the flow

512
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:19,600
realization or

513
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:21,439
development we'll have blood bulb and

514
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,280
rhizome production etc

515
00:17:21,439 --> 00:17:25,520
so these are some of the fact and some

516
00:17:23,280 --> 00:17:27,520
of the points where these photoperiodism

517
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,760
they affect the plant okay

518
00:17:27,520 --> 00:17:31,760
um the first one here is a short day

519
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:34,559
plan we also have long day

520
00:17:31,760 --> 00:17:36,559
and we have a neutral plant right so

521
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:38,480
this duration of the life they have a

522
00:17:36,559 --> 00:17:40,640
great influence and the intensity for

523
00:17:38,480 --> 00:17:41,760
the canopy as well as for the final

524
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:45,520
years okay guys

525
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:47,840
um it is very important to consider this

526
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:48,960
in the selection of the crop varieties

527
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:52,400
especially

528
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:54,000
the crop varieties and the short day

529
00:17:52,400 --> 00:17:55,200
plans if you're going to look at that

530
00:17:54,000 --> 00:17:58,640
these are the plants

531
00:17:55,200 --> 00:18:00,640
which basically develop normally when

532
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:02,799
they develop normally when the for the

533
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,120
period is

534
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,440
less than the critical or maximum okay

535
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:10,160
so the critical maximum is less than 12

536
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:10,880
hours right so these are what short-term

537
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:12,559
plans are

538
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:14,960
and now when we look into this

539
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,799
long-distance these laundry plants these

540
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:17,919
are the plants which develop and they

541
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:19,919
produce

542
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:21,360
normally when the photo period is

543
00:18:19,919 --> 00:18:23,760
greater than the max

544
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,480
critical minimum which is greater than

545
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:28,320
the 12

546
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:30,799
us so these longer plans they needed to

547
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:31,440
the length of about more than 12 hours

548
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:33,600
and now

549
00:18:31,440 --> 00:18:35,520
the last one here is of the day neutral

550
00:18:33,600 --> 00:18:37,760
plant and the day neutral plant

551
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,520
basically these are the plants or those

552
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:40,799
plants which are not affected by the

553
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:42,799
photo period okay

554
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,960
i hope this is clear and now let's go to

555
00:18:42,799 --> 00:18:47,120
another a slide where i've just given

556
00:18:44,960 --> 00:18:47,600
some of the examples along with in the

557
00:18:47,120 --> 00:18:49,280
table

558
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:50,880
along with the short day plan long day

559
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:52,799
plan and day neutral okay

560
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,960
so let me just read out the for the

561
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:58,240
short term plans we

562
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,880
coffee have chrysanthemums dahlia

563
00:18:58,240 --> 00:19:03,360
goose food we have hemp morning glory

564
00:19:00,880 --> 00:19:03,919
poinsettia these are all flowers okay

565
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:06,400
guys

566
00:19:03,919 --> 00:19:07,120
and we have rice soy bean we have

567
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:09,039
tobacco

568
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:10,320
we have violets so these are also

569
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,160
another flowers

570
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:14,400
and now let's look into longer plants

571
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:17,919
for long day we have barley

572
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:20,320
cabbage carrots hanbin we have lobster

573
00:19:17,919 --> 00:19:21,120
these are also flowering plants we have

574
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:24,240
lettuce

575
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:27,360
onion petunia poppy these are flowers

576
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:29,200
raw dish spinach and beet

577
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:31,039
and if you're going to look into the new

578
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:34,400
japans we have balsam

579
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:38,320
these are also flowers okay and

580
00:19:34,400 --> 00:19:41,440
we have beans chilies capsicum

581
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,720
to be sorry tomato cotton cucumber

582
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:47,440
a maize potato all of these these are

583
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:49,200
under the neutral plants okay um right

584
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:51,360
so now let's go to our fourth question

585
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:52,320
who is the father of agri meteorology in

586
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:55,600
india okay

587
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:57,679
so guys um the right answer for this

588
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:59,039
is okay so before that before giving the

589
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,919
right answer let me just read out the

590
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:02,400
options

591
00:19:59,919 --> 00:20:04,000
uh the options given here our number is

592
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:07,200
m swaminathan we have

593
00:20:04,000 --> 00:20:10,720
b which is ramdas c is bp

594
00:20:07,200 --> 00:20:12,720
pal and d is jw leather and number e

595
00:20:10,720 --> 00:20:13,919
is none of the above so guys the right

596
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:17,039
answer for this

597
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,840
is el eram does so he is the man who is

598
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:20,400
the

599
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:22,400
father of the agrimetrology in india

600
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:23,840
right so in that we try to study for the

601
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:25,840
fathers of

602
00:20:23,840 --> 00:20:27,600
different other allied subjects under

603
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,039
agriculture we also have for soil

604
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:32,000
science agronomy

605
00:20:29,039 --> 00:20:34,000
agricultural engineering try to list out

606
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:36,480
all the fathers of his respective

607
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:38,159
discipline and jot it down make it i

608
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:40,000
think it'll be more much more easier for

609
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:40,480
you guys if you can make a table out of

610
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:44,000
this

611
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:45,840
and get study in that way okay so um

612
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:47,440
my last question here i would like you

613
00:20:45,840 --> 00:20:49,360
all to answer for this again

614
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:51,679
so which of the following range of the

615
00:20:49,360 --> 00:20:55,039
wavelength they help in photosynthetic

616
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:55,600
and photoperiodic activity so we do have

617
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:57,440
certain

618
00:20:55,600 --> 00:20:59,200
range of wavelengths which help in

619
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,600
certain uh growth and

620
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:03,760
production and for certain effects that

621
00:21:01,600 --> 00:21:04,880
it has a particular function that it has

622
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:07,280
on the plant okay

623
00:21:04,880 --> 00:21:08,000
so this question is based on that right

624
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,640
so

625
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:12,080
uh think carefully and drop it in the

626
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:13,760
comment section all right guys

627
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:15,679
so the options i'm gonna read up that

628
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:19,760
number a is 720

629
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:21,120
to 510 number b is 1000 number c is more

630
00:21:19,760 --> 00:21:24,400
than 1 000.

631
00:21:21,120 --> 00:21:27,840
number d is 500 to 400 number e

632
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:29,760
is 400 to 300. out of these which one

633
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:31,440
the longest range helps in the

634
00:21:29,760 --> 00:21:33,280
photosynthetic as well as in the

635
00:21:31,440 --> 00:21:35,200
photoperiodic activity

636
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:36,640
if you guys know the answer then do drop

637
00:21:35,200 --> 00:21:37,760
it in the comment section so that i'll

638
00:21:36,640 --> 00:21:40,799
be able to know

639
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,720
right guys and before going uh let's

640
00:21:40,799 --> 00:21:45,600
just solve three of the

641
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:46,240
questions quickly right so i've just

642
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:49,440
given

643
00:21:46,240 --> 00:21:51,039
the questions here and i think it's

644
00:21:49,440 --> 00:21:52,559
quite small i don't know whether you

645
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:56,240
guys are able to see or not

646
00:21:52,559 --> 00:21:59,039
if it's visible then but let me just

647
00:21:56,240 --> 00:21:59,440
increase the size of this right guys

648
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,480
yeah

649
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:04,320
this is more visible now okay so um

650
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:06,400
number question number one was that

651
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,320
indian institute of tropical meteorology

652
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:10,159
iitm it is located in

653
00:22:08,320 --> 00:22:12,080
putna right then it was established in

654
00:22:10,159 --> 00:22:14,240
the year of 1962.

655
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:15,840
right and question number two is wind

656
00:22:14,240 --> 00:22:19,360
speed is measured by

657
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,720
any moment rainfall is measured by rain

658
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,280
gauge okay guys

659
00:22:20,720 --> 00:22:25,120
and we have a chemical which is used for

660
00:22:23,280 --> 00:22:26,640
artificial

661
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,720
rainfall i think this is an important

662
00:22:26,640 --> 00:22:29,280
question so you can jot it down i'm

663
00:22:28,720 --> 00:22:32,400
gonna

664
00:22:29,280 --> 00:22:34,640
put a star mark under this and

665
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:36,240
we also have um the word monsoon it is

666
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,240
derived from arabic

667
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,400
language and the last one says that the

668
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,200
radiation having thermal effect on the

669
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,679
plant

670
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,880
is uh the answer would be your infrared

671
00:22:43,679 --> 00:22:46,799
radiation so these

672
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,400
are some of the questions that i've just

673
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:49,919
quickly jotted down for that which i

674
00:22:48,400 --> 00:22:50,960
thought might be very important from the

675
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:53,600
exam point of view

676
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:55,280
okay guys um so that's all for today i

677
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:57,360
