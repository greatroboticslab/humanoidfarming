1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,400
like the farmers in Canada objected they

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:06,879
said

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:09,480
look we have every economic reason to

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:12,759
use as little fertilizer as we can cuz

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:15,440
it's expensive we have satellite maps of

6
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,199
where we put the fertilizer we have cut

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,279
our fertilizer use so substantially in

8
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,920
the last 40 years you can't believe it

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:25,439
and we grow way more food we're already

10
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,240
breaking ourselves in half and if you

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,400
know Farmers especially the ones who

12
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:32,560
still survive you think you think those

13
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,560
people don't know what they're doing
