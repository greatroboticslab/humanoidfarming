  "text": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] okay having looked at the various relationships which can be used for the design of our irrigation system we look at another aspect of the system design let's put a question to ourselves that was the guarantee that the parameters which you have obtained from those relationships are those the valid parameters when you will be applying those parameters in the field so quite often is required that we should check those parameters and try to uh define some procedure by which you can check those parameters we had seen that in the case of border irrigation design also that we had gone in further the field trials or field evaluation similarly in this case also we can adopt a similar procedure to check those parameters which we have obtained whether those parameters are close to the parameters which you actually obtain through the field trials if they are well and good if they are not then you will have to revise some of those parameters depending on what are the actual conditions because many times what is the reason behind if you look at the reason behind you are trying to use the relationships which which represent the conditions in the field so that representation if it is faulty or if it is not is always dependent on some observations which you have made at some discrete points in the field if those are not proper then you might get some some parameters which are not representative parameters because many times you might be you might be basing all your criteria on the the infiltration observations which you have made those observations they belong to certain point locations in the field so when you do the trial run you will be able to verify those parameters so let's have a look at the field trial verification procedures of some of the design parameters on the case of furrow irrigation the first thing which you want to find out is that what is the maximum stream size which should be taken and you have used this relationship to find out that q maximum having obtained this q maximum now you set up a length in the field which is representative length of the the furrow field and select around four to five furrows for example if you have this is your total field having different photos you can select some segment maybe somewhere here where you can you have the upstream and there's the downstream end where you are making the measurements and then you select some of the photos so you have you have selected a representative segment of the total field and this segment has a portion of the field where you will be making the observations so so as to check the various design parameters now the queue maximum which we have obtained so let us assume that you have selected four photos and you have a q maximum which you know which is a desirable stream size which you obtained from the relationship now select four different stream sizes in such a way that some of them are more than q maxima and some of them are less chance the q maximum value the one which is less you try to select one out of this which hardly which may not be able to even reach the downstream end of the field so it's so low you are trying to select those stream sizes which are extreme scenes stream sizes the one which is very low and on this side you might select one which is definitely erosive so as to have a range of these stream sizes because you want to you want to make the observations that how the the movement of water will behave with respect to these different ranges of the stream size so once you have selected the same sizes you make the observations the observations are only made in terms of the elapsed time but how the waterfront moves from the upstream end of the furrow to the downstream end so you plot these with respect to the distance down the furrow meters this is in minutes depending on what sizes you have selected you might find that you are once you plot those you will get a family of these advanced curves belong to different stream sizes for example this is if you take this as the you might now be able to observe one if you have many of them you might out of these you might know that which is the one which is the maximum allowable stream size because you want to select one which is non-erosive okay that you can call as the maximum allowable stream size here you will have all these stream sizes will be this will be more than q maximum if we call this as the q maximum now you can also match that whether the q maximum which you have obtained from the relationship from the empirical relationship does it match with the allowable maximum as per the field conditions or not so that's the first check so if you find that that maximum allowable is different choose that as the maximum allowable and the others now these are the sizes which are greater than q maximum and they'll be will be creating erosion on the field and on this side of the this maximum allowable these are the stream sizes which are less than q maximum and they are non-erosive at the same time they are of course non-erosive but we have seen that to have less of de-percolation you should try to have the maximum stream size the fpr ratio which we have seen we can we have seen the justification now having obtained this family of the curves now this family of curve is with respect to unknown slope and non-q values you can always use iterative procedures to find out what is the the length to be adopted and what is the corresponding time of advance to show you the how you do the use the iteration to find out which are the proper parameters let's take one case where you have been given the given data is that q maximum as 0.4 liters per second the slope of the field is also given and the family curve or the properties of the soil in terms of the family curve as known so once the family curve is known you know all that the coefficients a b and c so now as a first trial you have to make trial runs assume a length of the field let's say we assume 100 meter land let's call this as the first trial you can evaluate beta since we know the values of all these parameters g is known since the family curve is known and x is 100 meters that's what we have taken as the segment of the length so x is basically uh the length of the field considered does the value of g with respect to the family curve into 100 meters and q is known to be 4 liters per second 0 0 5 to the power 0.5 and this is 2.13 now with this beat off you can find out what is the advanced time i'll call it t1 because this is the first trial this is given as all these relationships we have seen earlier so this is what this will evaluate to be into exponent of beta is 2.13 this is and then 10 minutes having found this advanced time let me let me assume that when once i have found out the the stream size if the stream size is 0.4 i have taken these stream sizes to be i have chosen these stream sizes for which the family curves have been plotted and these belong to these values 0.15 liters per second point three point four five point six okay so let's let's assume that these belong to the the given case which we have just taken and let's give some values to a distance and so on i'm just trying to sketch it in a rough manner and the time elapsed time is from 0 to 500 minutes now in the first case when i i have found that the advanced time is 110 minutes so for that case i find out for this advanced time and the distance i know the distance taken is 100 meters if this is the 100 meter distance here i try to project it and if this belongs to 110 110 minutes i find that this point lies much below the the maximum allowable stream size and this point with respect to these two parameters if i take 100 meters as the length of the field and for which the advanced time with respect to the given parameters is 110 minutes then this point lies below this the maximum allowable which suggests that if you use these parameters you are going to get the erosive conditions so that means either the length is not proper or the synth length is dependent on the advanced time or the advanced time is dependent on the length is the either way they are both interconnected so i can take another length as a second trial that means this particular condition is not acceptable i take the second trial and assume a length which is which is larger than the previous case take a length of 140 meters now for 140 meters length meter gets over evaluated to sorry 2.98 and the corresponding advanced time is 362 minutes again if i get back to this for 140 140 meter i project a vertical line from here and on this side the elapsed time is 300 something 362. if this is the point here for 362. i project it and you are getting a point which is slightly above the the maximum discharge um curve the maximum logarithmic discharge curve so this shows that we have achieved a condition now with respect to these two length of 140 and the the resultant advanced time is 362 minutes so this gives you a condition where you can you will have a situation where the erosion is not a problem but you might be getting efficiency which is not as much as achievable it's not an optimum efficiency the optimum efficiency you will get when you when you you will be able to closer to the maximum allowable stream size so you can if you feel that you have come quite close to this with the respect to these parameters is fine otherwise you can have another child where you can still improve upon take a third trial where you improve on the length and you feel that you have taken a length which is more than the desirable you can take it to be less than the previous case and have another iteration where this case beta is 2.66 and the advanced time works out to be 235 minutes now this advanced time versus the length combination it falls quite close to the q maximum and now you can you can say that you have achieved a situation which is desirable and at this at this juncture you now compare the parameters which are obtained here with respect to the parameters which you obtained by the the other the equations which have been provided and that comparison will give you an insight into whether the results which you obtained through the the procedural steps using the procedure which you have studied in the last class how close they are to the actual conditions so if they are very far they are far apart you might have to make some adjustments so once in a way it is always better to keep track of these these parameters and wet those parameters try to check those parameters don't keep on blindly using those parameters that is the main main reason of having these trial evaluation runs for different systems we have seen in the case of border and this also even similarly in the case of level basin which you are going to consider next the procedures remain same only the expressions the way you have to conduct the trial runs they will change okay so with that we conclude this topic on the furrow education system and we will move on to the the next topic which is a topic of level basin system if you have any question i can answer that at this juncture we won't spend much time on the level basin system because is quite same procedures as we have done in the case of border irrigation system only with very small minor differences and i'll quickly go through this particular subject a topic which is a related topic and try to bring out those differences which are considered in the evaluation and the design of this level basin system if you remember we have discussed earlier that the level basin is a special case of the border only difference is the level basin they are not having any slope they are level areas without slope they're relatively small in size and what you are doing the suitability in terms of the suitability they are suitable far low to moderate and take soils so for those soils where the infiltration rates are relatively lower you can use you can make use of this system the shapes of the fields are normally rectangular but the sizes are not the lengths are not as big as you have in the case of border derivation because of the fact that you are trying to flood these areas now the reason is that you want to do the flooding in these small basins so that you can let the water stand for a long period so as to have the the available infiltration opportunity time to be there so as to have the desired desired infiltration take place in the field because we have just said that the the infiltration rates of these soils are very low if you let the water pass over the surface of the soil the amount of time which is available for the infiltration is very small and since the infiltration rates are very low it needs a very long time for infiltration so that is the reason that the shape of the basin and the size of the basin has been reduced the the slopes are not given so that you can flood the area you can check the water within the area that is the idea if you create slopes then you will find that the lower portions of the let me elaborate this point that if i have a field which is having slope if you want to supply a depth of water and you try to trap this water it will get accumulated only into the lower area so you have to have a relatively level surface on which you can now you can establish a depth of water and the depth of water will depend on what is the ridge size what is the height of the edge which are created in creating these these basins will come to that that is also a parameter which has to be considered in the designs so this particular method from that angle is is created for some special purpose or some special circumstances but with respect to the type of crops which can be grown we have already considered that in this particular method in the czech basin method or the level basin method the crops there's hardly any crop which cannot be grown in this even those crops which are not suitable to be known with any other method example the rice or the jute which need the water inundated water which need the standing water they also are used with this method other all the other methods even the orchards they are also irrigated using this method where you are creating the conditions where you are taking care of each individual plant by having a ring method which you had considered so we have discussed that earlier also and let's let's set this juncture try to look into the various formulations which have been considered for the design of these systems and this case also as we have seen in the previous cases that there are some relationships which are based on experience and the even the field trials and these relationships are ultimately given in the form of a very simple chart which becomes the starting the starting parameters of the design you can always use them as the thumb rules or as the values which are recommended values so in this case there is one that they are presented in different different forms and one form which i am trying to express here is the chart given in terms of the flow rate in liters per second and for different soil type the soil type vary from sand to sandy long to clay long so clay and you are given the area of the basin and hectares for different forage and for different soils so i'll only pick up some of the values for some in intermediate stream sizes and give you the variation that how much variation in size can take place which is the recommended sizes for all these different types of soils let me say that this is 270. now you can see the variation when you have very small stream size within the same uh the same stream size when you go from one extreme of the soil type to the other extreme the area can vary by around 10 times same is true in this case also and for different seam sizes for the same soil there's still a lot of variation in the area which can be used for the level basin besides this this this will give you a reasonably good starting parameters of the design but you can always if you have more data available you can go in for the detailed design which is dependent on the hydraulic relationships which we have been using for other methods the relationships basically used in this these designs are the soil characteristics which we have seen and the manning's equation which have been used very often because with the assumption that the we are considering a channel flow which is a very wide channel with a very small depth as the assumption made because basically the manning's equation is for channel flow so let's look at the hydraulic relationship which we can use for the case of level basin this equation is still valid for the net depth of infiltration which is which we have used very often so using this equation you can always get the time of infiltration to have this much net depth of infiltration what is the the desirable time of infiltration can be obtained from the same relationship once we have this tn available now we use the fpr's the fractional advanced ratio and the fracture advance ratio is given for this is basically the affair the way we are defined as the ratio of advanced time by the net time the fps varies with respect to the the distribution pattern efficiency or you can also say that the distribution pattern efficiency is dependent on affair and for different distribution pattern efficiencies far value has been computed and given in this table similarly for other efficiencies you have now this is something which is available either in this form or even in a graphical representation is one of the same thing even there's a the equation which is available to uh find out the distribution pattern efficiency knowing the affairs and this equation is a regression equation which you can make note of and 2 dt by tn to the power 0.5 this is 0.5 here where it is and percentage as in this once you either know your t n to the power 0.5 i'm sorry as i'll write with this is it visible now now there can be different situations in one case you might select a ed that you want to you don't want to have a distribution pattern efficiency below a particular level so in that case you fix your id and you can find out what will be the the far possible for that id so if that is the situation then you know your affair if far is known you can you can know the affair or in other words you know this ratio this you can find out from the table depending on the acceptable distribution pattern efficiency once you know this you can now evaluate t t because t n is known t n is known and the far is known okay so knowing therefore the advanced time can also be evaluated then there is a relationship between the the time of advance and the length and the stream size now in this case let me tell you that the stream size which we use is not the stream size for the total strip we use per unit strip so the unit stream size which you can say is the cube divided by the width of the basin and this will be in meter cube per seconds per meter width or meter per second that is what we call the unit stream size and this length is given in terms of the unit stream size and the advanced time and the other parameters of the family curve this is lying by 16. and advanced time by 3 by 60. so that's the expression which is used to find out the length of the basin and this the n value n value is the same as we had used for the border irrigation system i had given you the three n values which are representative of three conditions the small this value was for smooth bare soil surface point one is taken as the when the when you have small grain drill rows parallel to the bottle strip and if you have a dense crop or when the rows are drilled across the border strip then you have more resistance the n value is 0.25 the same and values or similar n values are chosen for if this is a similar situation the difference is not much the only difference is that you have the flat areas besides this you will also be interested in knowing what is the cutoff time the time to cut off which we are calling as tco the relationship used for the time to cut off all these quantities you are now quite aware of the unit stream size the distribution pattern efficiency the length and the net depth of infiltration and this the ea is assumed to be 100 the application efficiency so if the application efficiency is assumed to be hundred percent then this is the expression otherwise if the application efficiency is less than hundred percent which is normally not the case in the case of surface irrigation systems but if it is if you are certain that is not hundred percent then you can use the expression which is giving a also okay that'll be the device expression if your ear is not 100 then lastly we are also interested in knowing that what is the maximum depth of flow on the basin this maximum depth of flow in the basin has to find out the requirement of the ridge and normally the ridge size is approximately 1.25 times the the maximum if we call this maximum depth as the maximum so you can compute the the maximum using this expression this expression used for obtaining the d maximum and the maximum will be millimeters now here there's one requirement that there might be a situation when the advanced time is more than the cutoff time if that is the situation which can which can only happen in the case of level basins so if that is the situation then you must and this equation of t max you must replace tco with dt so in this expression which is for the nd max expression okay that will have to take care that if your time of advances happens to be more than the the time of cutoff then this will be the governing time to compute the d maximum which is quite understandable so that is what gives us all the parameters which we are interested in and similarly in this case also you can go in for the trial runs and check the parameters as we have suggested in the previous two cases so with that i will conclude the topic of irrigation methods using the surface irrigation or the gravity irrigation flow and then in the next class we'll proceed with the design of other two methods the sprinkler irrigation and the depletion system okay any question i want to uh answer this juncture the question is that is there any thumb rule for the basin method the thumb rule in terms of this is the table which we have just looked at i had given you some values of that table that was basically a thumb rule uh it can be converted into a thumb rule in the sense that this thumb rule all the thumb rules which you normally formulate they are having lot of experience behind them so this can be taken as a thumb rule where if you know the stream size because normally what parameters are available to you the constraints the constrained parameters are the quantity of stream size or the rate of stream size which is the stream size which is available to a farmer at a particular location if that is known and we also know in general what are the the type of soil which are prevalent there in that field then he can use this as a thumb rule that what is the size of the the basin which he should adopt so as to get a reasonably good efficiency so this is this is nothing but a thumb rule it can be taken as a thumb rule okay thank you [Music] so [Music] you",
