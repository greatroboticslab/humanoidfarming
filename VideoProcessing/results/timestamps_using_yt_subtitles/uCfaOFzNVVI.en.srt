peaceful rivers, and rich culture. This

00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,040
is Nepal. Not only a feast for the eyes,

5
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,600
but also home to hundreds of thousands

6
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:20,560
of upland and lowland farmers who depend

7
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,720
on rice for their food needs. Many of

8
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
these farmers are economically and

9
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,439
socially marginalized and are often the

10
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:28,439
poorest.

11
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,399
Traditionally, Nepalese hill farmers

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:37,520
rely on rice production for subsistence.

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,000
Most of them grow traditional varieties.

14
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,079
The average rice yield in Nepal has been

15
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,600
around 2 and 1/2 tons per

16
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,160
hectare. Upland rice farming is highly

17
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,039
labor inensive and taxing especially for

18
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:53,440
women. Besides their household chores,

19
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:57,039
women do most of the farm work such as

20
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,290
taking care of animals, weeding, drying,

21
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,800
and milling.

the International Rice Research

32
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,840
Institute to implement a project in

33
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:40,479
Nepal. The project is called managing

34
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,479
rice landscapes in the marginal uplands

35
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:45,360
for household food security and

environmental

00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:51,040
sustainability. In the mountainous areas

38
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:53,920
of Nepal, farmers grow rice in both

39
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:56,159
upland and lowland fields. The project

40
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,399
is focused on developing improved

41
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:00,399
technologies for managing these rice

42
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:06,159
landscapes. The project has adopted a

43
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:08,560
farmer participatory approach. Farmers

44
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,959
are highly involved from the beginning

45
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:12,360
during implementation and in the

46

decision making

47
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:16,560
process. Research on potential

48
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,760
technologies is conducted at

49
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,520
village-based field research sites. It

50
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,520
is done with a collaboration of the

00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:33,120
collaborates with the Lumjang campus in

tested, and disseminated under the

64
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,319
farmers benefit from these

65
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:06,080
technologies. IAS researchers with a

collaboration of the farmers identified

67
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:11,120
and tested several suitable upland and

68
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,440
lowland rice varieties.

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,480
From these varieties, farmers chose

70
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,840
Radha 32 and

71
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:23,200
IR554355. These farmers came from

72
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:25,480
several villages in Langjong, Gorka and

73
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,480
Tanahun

74
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:32,599

IR554355 has consistently outperformed

79
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:55,040
the preferred local varieties. Farmers

80
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,000
like it because of its higher number of

81
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:01,200
field grains and straw yield. Farm

82
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,599
animals like the soft straw. The straw

83
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:07,280
feeds farm animals such as cattle and

84
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:09,920
buffalo during the dry season.

85
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,159
From the IAES assisted areas, we have

86
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,480
seen and heard the reasons why farmers

87
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,320
preferred and adopted the varieties

88
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:20,639
mentioned compared with

89
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:22,639

sites Pu and

94
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:37,800
Bapsi. Here farmers preferred NR

BM9855 and hard enough one. Farmers

98
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:47,759
chose these varieties for their higher

99
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:51,040
yield, good eating quality and

100
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:55,759
suitability to a rice cropping pattern.

101
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:58,080
The M9855 and NR 6015 also perform well

102
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:01,080
in rainfed land and irrigated

The ability to grow spring rice is a

107
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,039
blessing for farmers in the lower hills

108
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,840
because they can grow two crops in one

109
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,360
year, one in spring and one in the

110
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:29,520
summer.

111
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:31,960
Hard enough one is the most popular

112
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:35,039
spring season variety in the Churia

113
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:37,520
Hills. The variety is popular because it

114
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,479
matures early which allows growing a

115
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,639
second crop. Hard enough one is also

116
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,759
high yielding and has good milling and

117
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:49,000
eating qualities. It is also tolerant of

118
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,680
drought and major rice

119
00:05:49,000 --> 00:05:54,320

120
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:57,280
enough one seeds to farmers in Bapsi and

121
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:59,280
Pu villages. The seeds were also

122
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:01,039
distributed to farmers in seven

123
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,479

varietal demonstration and wider

127

128
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:15,919
important inputs of production for

129
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:19,680

134
00:06:26,600 --> 00:06:33,039

135
00:06:29,720 --> 00:06:35,759
formed, one in Lamjung district and the

136
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:39,199
other in Tanahun. The groups are

137
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:41,120
producing rice and maze seeds.

138
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
The two groups were provided with

139
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,639
information on group formation and

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:49,440

00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:04,000
the capacity of farmers to produce

148
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:06,160
seeds. This has also helped them to

149
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:09,199
market and meet local demand for the

150
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:11,280
popular varieties. This endeavor has

151
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:14,319
improved the availability of good

152
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,880

laborsaving technique as opposed to

156
00:07:20,840 --> 00:07:24,759

157
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:28,400
farmers in

158
00:07:24,759 --> 00:07:31,160
2007. The method saves them up to 60% in

159
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,440
labor compared with traditional

160
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:35,520
transplanting. It has significantly

161
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:37,670
lessened the backbreaking job of

162
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:38,800

community-based farmer groups and

166
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:48,400
district offices also introduce crop

kitchen gardens filled with vegetables

171
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:02,240
such as cabbage, cauliflower, tomato,

176
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:17,840

177
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:20,319
from the vegetables they grow. Cash

178
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:22,960
income from vegetables has enabled these

179
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:26,280
farmers to buy food and other items for

As the project ends in 2009, upland

182
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:35,279
farmers in Nepal have become more aware

183
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:37,440
of new rice varieties and technologies

184
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:40,360
and have started adopting those that

185
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:42,880
suit their needs. They are now growing

00:08:57,800 --> 00:09:02,320
knowledge. As farmers continue to adopt

194
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:04,720
and share the technologies they

195
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:07,040
developed, we hope that more upland

196
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,920
farmers in Nepal will not only have

197
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:11,839
enough food on their table but also have

198
00:09:09,920 --> 00:09:18,120
extra income for their famil family's

199
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:18,120
needs. Now that is what we mean by hope.
