  "text": "as we continue in integrated rangeland management down this road of honing our skills as grazing managers now we're going to talk about those specific grazing methods or systems that can be applied to to manage goals on land keep in mind there's a lot of things that a grazing system or a grazing management plan can do can help the vegetation it can improve the ecological quality of the land these items are from the National rangeland and pasture handbook another thing that they say there is that you can improve the efficiency of grazing through uniform use of all grazing units so that is one thing that we do know if you graze smaller units appropriately you can have uniform use across you what Congrats not accomplished they can't rectify mismanagement because of some other larger overriding factors such as the wrong species an incorrect stocking rate or some major distribution problems such as water not being available except every three miles or in this these graphs below you see this really really steep country on the right hand side and those black spots on the landscape are our cows a grazing system isn't going to help that animals use those landscapes it's going to take something else another we have really long large long term woody encroachment into plants that's got to be accomplished by a season and a type of animal a grazing method is not going to accomplish changes in those systems let's talk about these systems we'll talk about the first which is the kind of easiest grazing system that can be done and that is what we call continuous or season-long it's just one pasture livestock are placed on that pasture in the spring and they're removed at the end of the season or in other words are grazed all year are all season in one pasture so there's some advantages to this system one it's really simple the the input the cost and input is pretty low just have to permit or fence around the outside there is also an advantage because livestock production can be really high on these continuous season-long systems because animals have all the choice they need they can choose any plant any time across that landscape of course there are quite a few disadvantages too one is if you've got a really really large pasture or large allotment you may have difficulty actually managing or finding the cattle so that can be a problem plants that are available that once that animals will eat even though it's healthy for them to have maximum choice they're always going to eat their favorite plants so we tend to see in season-long systems we often see the most desirable plants being a disadvantage because they're the ones that are always eaten and the same can be true of riparian quality if you look at that stream going down the middle of this pasture animals have access to that all year round that can be okay if it's not really heavy grazing but I'm in hand in the summer every summer animals are probably going to camp out on that on the riparian vegetation there so it can be pretty hard on repairing systems also it's not very well adapted season-long systems are not really great on areas that have a lot of topographic challenges so on the other hand these systems can work really well in fairly small moderate sized pastures in the plains or in areas where we have moisture in the summer areas where there's not a huge riparian concern and where most of the plants growing are good forage plants and there's not a lot of differentiated inferential between the desired and undesirable plants so the system can work really well in some places and it's a challenging in others to overcome some of those challenges the next system up in intensity would be a deferred rotation system so here's a past here's a set of three I'm sorry instead of four pastors that are managed the three pastors that are managed in this case are the North pasture the upland pasture and the South pasture what we see here is that the three pastures are management and one is deferred every year in other words one is not grazed until after seed set so I in the year one we see that the upland pasture is deferred and the North pasture starts out being raised and then animals are moved to the South pasture and then they're finally moved to the upland pasture later in the year and the next year the deferred pastures the North pasture so animals start in the South pasture they're moved the upland pasture and then later in the summer they moved back to the North pasture the North pasture did not have any grazing in that period from initiation to seed set and then only receive grazing at the end at the end of the season so that's how you see on this chart that we the first year the upland pasture is deferred to the north bastard heard in the last or third year in this rotation the South pasture was deferred that's why it's called the deferred rotation because it's the actual deferment that is being rotated not the cows I mean the cows are being rotated too but the important point is that the deferment is being rotated some important points of this system one is that the animals are using all of the units they're using all of the available area so there's no extensive stocking rate there's no high stocking rate involved and and that's that's good because you're taking stock rate and you're taking a number of animals and you're spreading across the whole units the stocking rate is actually fairly low and animal performance is still fairly high because animals still have quite a bit of use of the area and they are able to choose their pet their diets not quite as high as that continuous system is still pretty good riparian areas can benefit from this because they're at least only going to be grazed once every three years during that really hot dry season the other two years out of any three they would they would be rested or deferred they would not be grazed and I'd also it's an advantage to wildlife because there's always gonna be some pastures that are not being used by livestock and that flipside of that there's always gonna be some pastures that were just used by livestock and often we find with large ungulates like deer and elk and pronghorn that they often those animals like following the cattle or the Sheep because the livestock will take down some of the dead material and then that makes for good resources so we often see wildlife following the livestock and this system allows for that next step FN is the rest rotation system case we have three pastures a lot of rest rotations are based on three pastures the difference between this and deferred rotation is that now one of the pastures is rested for a whole year you see in year one of this diagram the spring pasture is grazed early in the season then animals are moved at hill pasture and during that time creak pastors not grazed at all that whole year okay that's good because it gives some pastors rest for a whole year and it means that the plants that aren't going to be grazed by livestock they might be grazed by wildlife but they're not going to be grazed by livestock for that whole year it's bad because you're taking all of your animals and you're concentrating them in two-thirds of the area at least in this case when you had three pasture they'd be concentrated in 2/3 of the area so unless this is a unless there's a decrease in stocking rate with rest rotations we can see kind of heavy use of areas that are grazed in each year on the other hand that use is is followed by a long period of rest the downside to this pasture has to do with animal performance we often see relatively well lower animal performance in rest rotation systems because animals are always going on to a pasture that was deferred or rested meaning there's always a buildup of biomass of dead biomass so they have to sort through that dead biomass before they can get to the green better forage so animal performance can be quite low in rest rotation systems the flipside to that these systems weren't designed so much with livestock and while in mind they were designed with giving plants every opportunity to reseed themselves so what you see in these systems is that a pasture will not be gracious and spring to the plants go to seed then they will be grazed as a way to Tromp the seed into the soil and then that same pasture will be rested for the following years okay so for example look in this diagram we have in year one the Hill posture is not grazed from April to July then it is grazed in August through September during that time the grazing can shatter the seeds and stomp them into the ground the following year the hill pastures not graze at all so those plants that were stopped into the ground can now turn into turn into plants now I don't know that there's a lot of data that shows that this actually does yield more new plants but that certainly is the design behind system the one that here's an example of one of the most intensive systems we have that would be arrested I'm sorry a short-duration or a high intensity low frequency system it's where you have multiple pastors and every pastor is grazed by a lot of animals for a short period and usually each individual pastors grace several times per year so let's just take a look at this a pattern if you look at the diagram down there it's grazed in January and then it's grazed again in May and then it's grazed again in July and then it's grazed again in November so that pastors raised for only a few days ten fifteen seven days but it's grazed multiple times a year this system was designed to mimic some of the systems in Africa of large herds of wildebeest and then other kinds of prong of antelope coming through the system and so you see these waves of animals the advantage from the animal standpoint is that at least several times a year the animal has green forage to go on regrowth so the system was really designed with animals in mind but it also has the advantage of leveling the playing field of all the plants you put a lot of animals into one pasture at one time that restricts their choices between plants but it does make sure that all the plants are grazed so it makes sure that the zero plants aren't always getting hit that the undesirable or less desirable plants are also getting eaten so these intensive systems often involve higher stocking rates and they have a you know a large number of animals on pastures for a short period they can be quite effective in areas where you have rain during the growing season or at least throughout most of the year I tend to not work as well out here in the Intermountain West where we have a pretty short period of moisture so they so these systems are really adapted to just a few areas where there's moisture throughout the year and can really handle that higher sustained grazing another whole set of systems could best be just defined as decision decisional or management intensive systems these are systems that have just one heard and many pastors multiple pastors and the decisions about whether to move the animals and where depends on the amount of forage that's available the amount of water what activities are happening in the livestock units such as calving or lambing they're often used to facilitate other practices such as hanging or stockpiling enough forage for prescribed great for our fire and then finally these systems are probably the most common in the world and their success can be really high or low depending on the bill the ability of the manager the decisions of the manager some names that we would call these decisional systems would include the best pasture system this is where you move livestock to pastures that look best in terms of forage availability it was designed in the arid Southwest is used a lot in New Mexico Arizona those areas because oftentimes a storm will come through and it may put several inches of rain on a on a pasture but it might just be on one pasture or one area of the ranch so in order to use that green forage the manager makes a decision to go to the best pasture available complimentary systems such as those that are up in the central plains are where you have a pasture and a cultivated area you've cultivated some part of the ranch to have green forage either early in the season or late in the season so you're making a pasture to complement the rest of the range so that's a complementary or decisional system when you have to elevation to give you the advantage to be able to go to green forage at higher elevation you can accomplish a seasonal suitability system seasonal suitability is the idea that you're following the green you're always in put animals on higher and higher elevation because of the growth pattern of different vegetation types that's a seasonal suitability system in Idaho that's following the green or seasonal suitability is often seen where we start out in the winter range down in the salt desert shrub where the shrubs in the winter a few grasses to give that energy and shrubs to give the protein and will stay down there during the winter months then they start to move in the bench limbs there's a whole set of spring fall ranges that green up in April May time and animals graze those often times that's where we have animals calving or lambing out it's a very common system used in sheep production so you have lambing occurring that spring fall range from then on animals just follow up the mountains up into the summer range we're up in the summer range it's high elevation there can be snowpack up into June or July so you can have green forage up until it starts to cool down in August September the case of sheep usually those owners will ship the Lambs off of the mountain in September take them to sale because by that time they'll be fat ready to eat ready to sell and then they'll just slowly move the ewes down the mountain into that spring fall range again and then down onto the winter range this system also works with cattle just that the calves may have to be brought off and brought to some higher quality forage in that September October November we'll often see the cat the steers and heifers being taken off and gone going to higher quality forage it's a pretty simple system age-old system works really well because the animals are eyes on green forage and the vegetation usually has time to recover once the animals get off there's still enough resources and time for those plants to recover so it can be really easy on the range and really easy on the animal which method is best well it really depends I've seen all of these methods work and all of these methods fail depending on the skill of the manager and depending on what management goals are whether it be for livestock performance whether riparian areas are concern whether livestock production is the issue whether there's a concern over wildfire or risk and what and how the landscape would respond to that so all of these systems can be good at one time and may be poor at others so there's no one system fits all it depends on the skill of the manager nearly all systems can work and nearly all systems can fail there are thousands of variations on theme all of these examples in this PowerPoint are of one heard systems multiple pastures or one pasture and one herd there's a whole set of systems that are designed with multiple herds so there's a like there's just variations on this theme depending on how many pastures you have exactly what the rest deferment grazing rotation combinations are are quite endless but no matter the system you've got to get a stocking right the species of animal and you've got to pay attention to distribution patterns because this the grazing method is just one of the parts of the equation and all methods need to be flexible to be managed and so if the manager is good and they have the flexibility they can manage for disturbances on the ground such as fire weeds droughts animals used by wildlife or by wild horses all of those things are things that can change a management plan and that requires flexibility so that's about the main aspects very simplified version of grazing methods there's some other readings in this class that will give you some more of the details for each method but keep your eye on the ball it's a manage of it's just an aspect of managing the time that pastures are grazed or arrested and then we'll next talk about distribution and some of the other elements about making your grazing method successful",
