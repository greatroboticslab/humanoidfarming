1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:06,839
so right here I have the garden tower

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:10,500
and I'm going to assemble it and what it

3
00:00:06,839 --> 00:00:13,679
is is a tower compact tower that you can

4
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,660
grow up to 50 little plants and I plan

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,609
on putting some strawberries the other

6
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,160
nice feature about this is that you can

7
00:00:17,609 --> 00:00:23,430
put food scraps in the middle of it and

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:24,960
the plants will eat it and so I put it

9
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:27,840
here on my deck where it's close to the

10
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:30,190
kitchen so we can just easily put food

11
00:00:27,840 --> 00:01:13,439
scraps in it so let's get started

12
00:00:30,190 --> 00:01:13,439
[Music]

13
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:34,540
[Music]

14
00:01:42,530 --> 00:01:45,599
[Music]

15
00:01:51,790 --> 00:01:54,989
[Music]

16
00:02:01,460 --> 00:02:10,819
[Music]

17
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,980
[Music]

18
00:02:21,629 --> 00:02:25,720
so I don't quite have enough dirt to

19
00:02:23,980 --> 00:02:27,160
fill this up but I'm eager to get some

20
00:02:25,720 --> 00:02:29,349
plants in there so I'm going to go ahead

21
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:32,170
and plant the strawberries that I have

22
00:02:29,349 --> 00:02:34,629
so the instructions say that fill it up

23
00:02:32,170 --> 00:02:37,000
about a third of the way the soil and

24
00:02:34,629 --> 00:02:40,360
then add approximately three gallons of

25
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:44,610
water to the soil that's there and I'll

26
00:02:40,360 --> 00:02:44,610
just circle this

27
00:02:49,240 --> 00:02:55,340
so I've given the water a chance to

28
00:02:51,530 --> 00:02:58,250
percolate down now I'm going to get

29
00:02:55,340 --> 00:03:01,010
these strawberries out these are pine

30
00:02:58,250 --> 00:03:03,800
Barry White Carolina strawberries and

31
00:03:01,010 --> 00:03:19,850
then there's some red ones in here as

32
00:03:03,800 --> 00:03:23,510
well to help with the pollination end up

33
00:03:19,850 --> 00:03:26,030
with purposing feedbags in order to fill

34
00:03:23,510 --> 00:03:28,690
up with some topsoil from the high

35
00:03:26,030 --> 00:03:28,690
tunnel project

36
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:56,109
[Music]

37
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:59,740
and the idea is that over time this

38
00:03:56,109 --> 00:04:04,210
water and stuff will come down here

39
00:03:59,740 --> 00:04:09,060
would be the nutria team so then you can

40
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:09,060
take this bring it back up here

41
00:04:10,090 --> 00:04:14,650
[Music]

42
00:04:11,420 --> 00:04:14,650
poor back in there

43
00:04:16,200 --> 00:04:19,250
[Music]

44
00:04:19,299 --> 00:04:24,350
so I'll go ahead and let it go let it

45
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:29,240
get situated before I plant anything

46
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:33,650
else in the top but I'm really thrilled

47
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:36,590
to try this out now I these are

48
00:04:33,650 --> 00:04:39,380
available on farmer Broadcom and I've

49
00:04:36,590 --> 00:04:42,350
purchased this one with my own money

50
00:04:39,380 --> 00:04:43,700
because I wanted to be able to try it

51
00:04:42,350 --> 00:04:47,450
out firsthand

52
00:04:43,700 --> 00:04:50,060
and so these two rows are going to be

53
00:04:47,450 --> 00:04:58,250
strawberries and what I like about this

54
00:04:50,060 --> 00:05:01,370
is that you can rotate it around and so

55
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:04,970
if you have like a small amount of space

56
00:05:01,370 --> 00:05:07,669
you got 50 opportunities to grow

57
00:05:04,970 --> 00:05:09,800
something which i think is incredible

58
00:05:07,669 --> 00:05:13,100
now they do offer an upgrade kit where

59
00:05:09,800 --> 00:05:15,260
you can get coaster or wheels for the

60
00:05:13,100 --> 00:05:19,370
three legs that way it can be moved

61
00:05:15,260 --> 00:05:21,710
around a little bit but I have it on my

62
00:05:19,370 --> 00:05:25,430
deck so that's close to the kitchen so

63
00:05:21,710 --> 00:05:28,070
it can put food scraps in there and this

64
00:05:25,430 --> 00:05:31,760
way is south facing so it should get

65
00:05:28,070 --> 00:05:36,440
plenty of Sun throughout the day no

66
00:05:31,760 --> 00:05:38,090
matter which side the plants are on so

67
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:41,210
thanks for watching I hope you enjoyed

68
00:05:38,090 --> 00:05:47,770
this video and make sure to get your the

69
00:05:41,210 --> 00:05:47,770
