  "text": "boredom folks this Josh Stoney Ridge farmer son is up and it's peeking through the trees beautiful spring weathers here trees are starting to blossom and we're getting some leaves on them and we've got day number nine here on the land clearing projects and I'm going to take you over here I'm gonna update you what they're doing today is they're hauling off some big brush piles in the dump truck moving them to the other side of the farm and we're going to go over here and basically direct traffic not direct traffic out in the road but actually direct them to what we want them to do with these huge rocks out on the pond and I'll show you we're gonna go over here we're gonna put huge rocks out on the pond so we'll have a place to like hop rock to rock to go fishing you want to finish the project off nicely we want to have beautiful landscape and part of finishing this land clearing project behind me here is landscaping so we put some big stones up here and we'll just take you around and show you and we'll place these rocks I'm along today and we'll show you the progress and we'll show you the project alright let's have some fun [Music] [Music] alright guys we're gonna follow the excavator over here actually we're gonna beat the excavator over so he's coming down the hill here with the excavator and all this may seem kind of silly to you but it's what I want and I want to be able to hop rock to rock out here and fish in my fish pond so that's what I want so let's watch him do it I'm gonna direct rock traffic should be fun can't have fun what good's life send him right there take that one and set it out as the next step and then we'll take bigger and bigger out to the next steps leave about that much space in between them if you can this guy's looking at me like I'm an idiot paying 200 bucks an hour here and I want to have some fun with it folks don't forget click that like button down there just pound it pound that like button right now boom hit it okay it helps the channel a whole lot help support the channel and helps get these videos out there so other youtubers can see them alright [Music] [Music] the pond is swallowing them up more than I thought it would if the danger here is that the excavator could actually tip over into the pond but we got bulldozers we can get it out these boulders are thousands of pounds biscuit biscuit [Music] this is the most dangerous rock it's the biggest one it runs a risk of tipping I don't know if you saw that or not he told me if it starts the tip I'm dropping it I told them to just start piling rocks just start making a big pile out in the water back here and hopefully by the end of the pile you'll finish off with some nice big smooth rocks it's gonna be really cool I might even mount like a fighting chair out there where you can just sit down and rotate fish catch a big bass be awesome I think a little more thought needs to go into this they just keep sinking up or falling over in the water I think probably the best thing to do would have been to put the really rough rocks on the bottom and make a pile and then put the pretty rock on the top while we're working here guys I'll tell you what's going on today today most of the burn piles on this side of the farm have gone out and what's happening is these picking up these burn piles and he's taking them over across on the other side of the farm with the dump truck and what we're doing there is eventually once they get cold once they're not burning anymore we have a big gully and we're gonna fill in that gully now we're not gonna make pasture out of that gully we're just gonna fill in that gully with the old stumps and stuff like that just makes sense so that's why you'll see in the drone footage I'll walk you through and talk you through what's going on there [Music] [Music] one of the cool things about doing this right here is that it's gonna make good fish habitat and it's also going to make a place for the turtles to crawl up on so what a beautiful farm beautiful place and good habitat for wildlife so we're about to wrap it up right here we got one more rock we're gonna put on here it's a big old flat rock that's about it so we'll take you over with the drone walk you through what's going on the process that's going on the thought process and see you next time hopefully we'll be digging with a disc harrow to try to loosen up the land and then we'll run over it with the seed drill a no-till seed drill would be real fun so come on back and see me all right so you stand on the Stoney Ridge guys all right so we've got a view of the farm right here and this is just an overview across from our house if you look up right in the center of your screen that's the next area that we're gonna be clearing off for field for pasture and you see a couple hay bales in the middle of the field this spot we're traveling over right now was a spot that was gully washed and we had him fixed that we're gonna drill seed down in that and we'll pop over the dump truck here and watch the caterpillar 963 B go at it here it's a cab model six-cylinder caterpillar basically he's scooping up remnants of where we had a fire and pretty much he'll just go along all the way through the farm anywhere they're remnants of where we had a fire he's scooping it up putting it in the dump truck and taking it over to a gully on the back side of the farm and dumping them out and then pushing them over into the gully to fill that in just a spot on the farm where we needed a hole filled in and it's better than leaving them out there in the middle of the field for another two years like the previous piles they all just kind of set out there so pretty good shot of the caterpillar at work right here and that's it just want to let you guys know what's going on here stay tuned for the next vlog or so and you'll see the progress as things have gone on they'll clean this up and we'll take a huge disc harrow and drag over the fields and loosen the dirt and then we'll go through and seed it so the next vlog should be cleaning up the fields [Music]",
