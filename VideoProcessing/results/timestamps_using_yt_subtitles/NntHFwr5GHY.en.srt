1
00:00:00,350 --> 00:00:12,300
alright so here's my my solar setup that

2
00:00:04,710 --> 00:00:15,960
I have going I have these 210 watt solar

3
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:17,460
cells got them both for forty four

4
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:21,390
dollars forty-four dollars for the two

5
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:23,070
solar cells pretty good deal but I still

6
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:28,490
have yet to be able to test them to make

7
00:00:23,070 --> 00:00:33,360
absolutely sure that they're running at

8
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:41,100
10 watts each there any possibility i

9
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:43,520
can zoom in on this yes no okay fine it

10
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:43,520
says

11
00:00:48,890 --> 00:00:53,989
it says that we've only put out a

12
00:00:51,030 --> 00:00:56,670
hundred and sixty-seven milliamp hours

13
00:00:53,989 --> 00:01:04,220
and I've been running this thing for

14
00:00:56,670 --> 00:01:08,400
hours that's lame but uh okay i need to

15
00:01:04,220 --> 00:01:11,640
get me to take out and put it in actual

16
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:16,040
direct Sun on a day that's not you know

17
00:01:11,640 --> 00:01:19,440
I don't know patchy here and there and

18
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,540
ya want it directly at son I'll put its

19
00:01:19,440 --> 00:01:26,990
own ohm resistor on them see if they

20
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:26,990
will actually give me 10 watts 10 ohms

21
00:01:27,950 --> 00:01:39,869
10 ohms oh okay and it was at 12 volts

22
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:43,979
this is supposed to be 12 volt things so

23
00:01:39,869 --> 00:01:47,759
12 volts 12 volts at 10 watts would be

24
00:01:43,979 --> 00:01:52,880
eight hundred milliamps and we're only

25
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:59,100
doing five volts and 200 milliamps with

26
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:02,909
210 watt panels so whatever like I said

27
00:01:59,100 --> 00:02:05,400
I've gotta do actual testing outside but

28
00:02:02,909 --> 00:02:07,259
either way you know getting into the

29
00:02:05,400 --> 00:02:10,350
soul of revolution is pretty cool I got

30
00:02:07,259 --> 00:02:13,769
my my thing here you know show me how

31
00:02:10,350 --> 00:02:15,570
much power is going in this thing is

32
00:02:13,769 --> 00:02:19,739
keeping count of how much power actually

33
00:02:15,570 --> 00:02:23,340
using this little thing down here is the

34
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:28,019
charger circuit for my battery this is

35
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:32,690
my USB battery so I'm charging up my USB

36
00:02:28,019 --> 00:02:38,130
better right now and have been for hours

37
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:43,440
and when I got 167 milliamp hours in

38
00:02:38,130 --> 00:02:46,440
there which is crap are 67 times five

39
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:53,060
that's that's almost 1 watt over three

40
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:53,060
hours not right bye peeps thanks
