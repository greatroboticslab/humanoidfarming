00:00:10,960 --> 00:00:14,320
hi there and welcome to little garden on

2
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:18,160
the prairies

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:21,680
so i'm very excited because this is the

4
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,400
first outdoor video of 2022 that i'll be

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,080
sharing with you today and it is a

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,160
beautiful sunny day

7
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,640
so if you've seen on on my previous

8
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:33,120
videos i have a lot of indoor starts

9
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:36,239
going on in my basement and in the

10
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:38,800
garage and we are still a few weeks away

11
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:41,920
from that last frost date so none of

12
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:44,399
that can come outdoors yet but there are

13
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:47,280
a lot of things that can be planted

14
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,840
outdoors directly into the ground before

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,680
last frost date so in this video i'm

16
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:53,680
going to show you some of the seeds that

17
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,079
i'm going to be direct sowing into

18
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,600
containers so before we get to the

19
00:00:56,079 --> 00:01:00,000
planting i just want to take you on a

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,840
quick tour of the garden

21
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
to show you the beautiful blue skies

22
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:05,680
we're having here today on the

23
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,760
saskatchewan prairies if you have a look

24
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:10,080
here at my garden it looks pretty

25
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,520
disastrous right now

26
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:16,640
i am in the process of converting my two

27
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:18,799
raised garden beds to containers

28
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
i have access to

29
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:23,280
many of these wonderful 30

30
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:24,240
gallon tubs they are mineral tubs that

31
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,880
we

32
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,000
get from our cattle once they've licked

33
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:32,079
them clean we wash them out and they are

34
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,240
food grade safe and they make such a

35
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:36,479
good container for growing

36
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,159
and it's just a lot easier than

37
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:41,040
crawling around on your hands and knees

38
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,880
i'm kind of getting to the point in my

39
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,880
life where i don't really want to be

40
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,040
doing that a whole lot i'll probably do

41
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,960
another video here next week kind of

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,240
giving you more details on how that's

43
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,680
all going to go

44
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,759
and how i'm going to fill up these

45
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:55,920
containers

46
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,560
the soil in these raised garden beds you

47
00:01:55,920 --> 00:02:00,640
know is just several layers of wonderful

48
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:02,560
materials that i've added over the last

49
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,040
few years leaves

50
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,600
wood chips compost

51
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,599
and i didn't want to just throw it away

52
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:13,200
so i'm digging it all out

53
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:15,280
and going to use it to fill these tubs

54
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,040
so i'll go over some of the seeds that

55
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,920
i'm going to be directly sowing today

56
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,160
plus give you a list of other

57
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:25,040
seeds that you can plant early these are

58
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:27,040
all cool weather crops that require

59
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:28,879
soil temperature to be somewhere around

60
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,920
that 10 degrees

61
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:34,080
to 15 degrees celsius

62
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,400
and when i came out yesterday afternoon

63
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:40,000
and did a temperature check

64
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:43,200
the soil seems to be about you know 17

65
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:44,959
18 degrees on the surface and

66
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,720
down below it was you know around that

67
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:49,200
10 degrees mark

68
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,519
we had some super windy days this past

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,440
week where the wind was gusting to 70

70
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:55,680
kilometers an hour

71
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,519
those two days were just horrible you

72
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,760
didn't even want to be outside

73
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,560
and a system like this would never

74
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,720
hold up in any kind of wind like that

75
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,239
so i don't think it's worth

76
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:08,560
fighting with i'm just going to remove

77
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:09,840
all this i think the soil is nice and

78
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:13,319
warm so

79
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,319
we can get planting

80
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,800
so before i get planting my lettuces

81
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:25,120
here i'm just going to put in a

82
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:29,519
all-purpose fertilizer and add that into

83
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:31,920
the soil here so this is just a 444

84
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,200
general all-purpose type fertilizer that

85
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:38,239
i usually add into my containers

86
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,480
so i've taken some fresh soil from my

87
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,200
raised garden beds that

88
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:43,360
is

89
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:46,879
you know really nice

90
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:50,159
organic soil it's got lots of material

91
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:53,280
in it some broken down leaves and

92
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:56,799
compost that i've added and some

93
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:58,560
wood chips so i think it'll be a nice

94
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,799
soil for this lettuce

95
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:03,920
and i plan to do section planting with

96
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,920
my lettuces and kale and spinach

97
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:07,280
so i plan on just going to be

98
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:10,080
planting up

99
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:12,560
on the back half of these containers

100
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,720
so here the sun rises over there and it

101
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,959
comes across my garden so these will

102
00:04:14,720 --> 00:04:21,759
have sun shining on them for probably

103
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:23,280
you know 16 hours a day

104
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,560
throughout the spring and early summer

105
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:25,840
for sure

106
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:28,560
so if i plant

107
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:31,520
this first round here in the back these

108
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,759
will grow up in about three weeks i'll

109
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:35,600
do another planting in the front here so

110
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:38,800
these won't you know be shading out the

111
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:41,600
new seedlings when they come through

112
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:43,199
so i just add a little handful of the

113
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,680
fertilizer here

114
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:49,040
try not to let it all blow away

115
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
work it into the soil

116
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:55,080
i'll work it into the whole container

117
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:01,919
i don't really follow any kind of

118
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:06,039
particular

119
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:06,039
measurement just a little sprinkle

120
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:24,240
so something that i try to follow is the

121
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:26,560
square foot gardening method when i'm

122
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:27,680
planting and it just helps kind of show

123
00:05:26,560 --> 00:05:29,440
you

124
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:31,840
the proper spacing of your seeds

125
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,600
depending on what you're planting

126
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,039
it is a bit of a challenge to use this

127
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,039
square

128
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:39,199
space seed spacing thing in a round

129
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,120
container but i'll just kind of show you

130
00:05:39,199 --> 00:05:44,240
how i do it so for lettuces and kale and

131
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:45,039
spinach

132
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,800
you

133
00:05:45,039 --> 00:05:48,639
use this spacing

134
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:51,199
of the red circles so that kind of shows

135
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,479
you so you can just press down just to

136
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,600
kind of mark where you're going to be

137
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:55,120
pushing

138
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:57,600
where you're going to be planting the

139
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,600
seeds

140
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,639
and i believe these in a square foot

141
00:06:02,880 --> 00:06:07,840
there is 16

142
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:11,600
spaces for lettuce or kales and then

143
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,600
from there i just kind of go outwards

144
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,479
following this

145
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:19,120
pattern a little bit

146
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,840
so that i can plant a few more

147
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
to each side

148
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:25,759
just kind of eyeballing it

149
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:35,759
and then from there you should have

150
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:38,639
all your holes marked where you want to

151
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:38,639
place your seeds

152
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:44,400
this is covering a little more than half

153
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,400
of my container but that's okay

154
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,199
so in this one i'm going to be planting

155
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:52,560
kale

156
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
so i try to just do one

157
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,000
per hole

158
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:02,479
you can you know just sprinkle it around

159
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:03,919
i've done that before you know you end

160
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:07,120
up with a very

161
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:10,240
thick crop that

162
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:10,240
needs to be thinned out

163
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:14,000
i'm going to try this and see

164
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:17,840
how it looks once it starts coming

165
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:34,639
we could even go a little bit closer to

166
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:34,639
the edge here and throw in a few more

167
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:38,000
but this way you kind of got a nice

168
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,919
general

169
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:45,840
spacing of your seeds

170
00:07:41,919 --> 00:07:48,000
another reason why i'm moving to uh

171
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,240
container gardening is

172
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,319
my little doggie here that you see in

173
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,720
the background

174
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,360
is already been digging in the

175
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,120
garden burying some treasures so i'm

176
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,919
hoping if i switch to the containers

177
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,560
that

178
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,080
that won't be such a problem

179
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:06,240
then after getting the seeds in just

180
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:08,080
give it a good generous water and ready

181
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:11,639
to move on

182
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:11,639
to the next container

183
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:54,480
so the next thing i'm going to plant up

184
00:08:50,640 --> 00:08:56,800
here today is some radishes and some

185
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,880
spring onions so i have two kinds of

186
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,600
onions that i'm going to try today and

187
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:04,320
one's kind of like a purple

188
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:07,680
and this guy is going to

189
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:09,440
really give me grief while i do this

190
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:11,680
okay so i just relocated these

191
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:14,000
containers uh so i can do some videoing

192
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,320
with hopefully without the dog

193
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,760
sticking his nose in things and

194
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:19,360
disrupting it

195
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:22,480
so for

196
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:23,440
onions uh these are like a spring green

197
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:26,399
onion

198
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:28,959
that i like to grow in containers and

199
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,240
something this size works perfectly

200
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:31,920
and it's good because you can move it

201
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
around the garden and make sure it's in

202
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,440
a sunny spot

203
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,279
and for radishes

204
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:40,080
pretty much any container goes as well

205
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,360
this isn't very big but because i can

206
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,920
you know plant about 16 in here today

207
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:47,760
and then find another little container

208
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,120
in a week and start some more you can

209
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:51,440
kind of just

210
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:53,760
grow radishes anywhere every couple

211
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,760
weeks so that you always have some

212
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,839
i find that if i grow too many at one

213
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,880
time they you know they grow so fast

214
00:09:57,839 --> 00:10:02,839
that i can't keep up with them so

215
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,440
little containers like this work

216
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,320
great so i did the same i had just a

217
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:09,120
little

218
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:11,279
sprinkling of the all-purpose fertilizer

219
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:13,519
into the soil here worked it up a little

220
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,720
bit so it's nice and loose

221
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,240
and i'm going to do some french

222
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,480
breakfast today

223
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,160
and according to the square foot method

224
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
you should do kind of the same spacing

225
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,279
you do with lettuce where you have 16

226
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,519
per

227
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,200
square foot but i'm kind of just going

228
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:28,880
to eyeball it

229
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:32,160
not too worried about them being too

230
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:34,640
close together

231
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,640
it's easy to thin out later or just let

232
00:10:34,640 --> 00:10:38,399
them grow sometimes they

233
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:40,640
will grow together and just push each

234
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,440
other aside and still you know you can

235
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:43,200
still

236
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
harvest them

237
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,600
and get a pretty good

238
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:49,360
crop that way

239
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:51,519
so i just push my seeds down with my

240
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,800
finger

241
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:54,800
wherever i see them

242
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:02,720
i think i can shove a few more in here

243
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:04,800
and then just

244
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:06,399
gently pat it down

245
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,000
so hopefully it's not going to be issue

246
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:09,839
with my dog this year

247
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
getting into these small containers so

248
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:15,839
we'll see how it goes

249
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,839
and again just give it a good watering

250
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,320
and then just find a nice sunny location

251
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,440
for it and leave it in your garden so

252
00:11:22,320 --> 00:11:27,440
radishes are one of the fastest growing

253
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:30,399
garden vegetables these should be ready

254
00:11:27,440 --> 00:11:33,279
to harvest within 25 to 30 days

255
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,160
and for these onions i'm just going to

256
00:11:33,279 --> 00:11:37,519
run a line down the middle here and plot

257
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,839
both of them

258
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:41,760
into this container

259
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,680
again green onions are another

260
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,600
type that you can succession plant

261
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,920
throughout the summer

262
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,440
find a container find a corner

263
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:51,519
somewhere in your garden where you could

264
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:52,959
throw in some more of these

265
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:55,600
you can plant them

266
00:11:52,959 --> 00:11:57,440
all summer long

267
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,440
i just pulled these out i did grow some

268
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:01,600
of these indoors hydroponically this

269
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:03,519
winter and i see that i hardly have any

270
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:07,560
seeds left so these are only going to

271
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,560
take up a quarter of this container

272
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,639
i just lightly cover them

273
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,279
work them in

274
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:22,959
don't bury them too deep

275
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:25,440
so i got lots of these ones these are

276
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,200
more of a purple type of a green onion

277
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:30,200
these are called the rosa lunga de

278
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:30,200
friends

279
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:51,040
another seed that you can direct sow

280
00:12:48,399 --> 00:12:53,680
before the last frost are peas

281
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,800
so peas are cool weather crops that love

282
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,760
being planted in nice cool soil in early

283
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,200
spring

284
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:04,240
so i have got these four cloth grow bags

285
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,680
designated for my peas here

286
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:08,320
we have an old

287
00:13:05,680 --> 00:13:10,959
remnants of a rabbit cage here that we

288
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,959
left one side up that's chicken wire so

289
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,639
we thought it'd make a good trellising

290
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
system for peas

291
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:17,120
so that's why i have them up against

292
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:20,079
here

293
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:21,839
they get lots of sunlight here as well

294
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:23,120
so i'm going to be planting two types of

295
00:13:21,839 --> 00:13:26,160
peas today

296
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:28,959
this is a burpiana early so it's a

297
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,920
potted pea that you have to shell to eat

298
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:34,800
and these are a sugar pod

299
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,600
so they have the edible type pod and

300
00:13:34,800 --> 00:13:39,600
these are called oregon sugar pod so i'm

301
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:42,160
gonna set up these two in these

302
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:44,720
containers

303
00:13:42,160 --> 00:13:46,560
so i usually push my peas down about one

304
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,959
inch into the soil

305
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:51,680
spread them out about you know two

306
00:13:48,959 --> 00:13:53,680
inches or so apart

307
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:57,360
using the square foot method

308
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:59,600
they say about six per square foot

309
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,560
so we'll kind of follow that

310
00:13:59,600 --> 00:14:03,199
here

311
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:06,240
you see i just push it down so it goes

312
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:08,160
about you know a good inch into the

313
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:10,800
soil

314
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,079
so peas are have very a very shallow

315
00:14:10,800 --> 00:14:14,560
root system

316
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:17,839
so that they're they're best to direct

317
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:19,680
so you can try starting peas indoors but

318
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:21,040
they don't transplant very well like i

319
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,720
said they have

320
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,040
a shallow root system and they don't

321
00:14:22,720 --> 00:14:27,680
really like to be disturbed so

322
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:30,720
this is the best way to do it once your

323
00:14:27,680 --> 00:14:33,040
soil is warm so i got about i think 14

324
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,040
in here

325
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:37,440
and i'm just gonna

326
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:39,519
cover them up

327
00:14:37,440 --> 00:14:42,000
and these ones growing on this side will

328
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:44,720
hopefully attach to this chicken wire

329
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:45,920
and then i will also probably stick a

330
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:47,839
tomato

331
00:14:45,920 --> 00:14:51,880
cage in here as well for them to grow up

332
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,880
as well in the front parts

333
00:14:57,010 --> 00:15:01,920

if you are enjoying this video and find

335
00:15:01,920 --> 00:15:06,320
value in the information i share on my

336
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,639
channel you can help support me by

337

make a small contribution to the channel

339
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:32,480
so one final step after planting your

340
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:34,800
seeds uh you should always use some kind

341
00:15:32,480 --> 00:15:36,880
of mulch on top of the surface just to

342
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:39,519
keep that moisture in

343
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:42,480
and protect it from the hot sun keep it

344
00:15:39,519 --> 00:15:44,160
from drying out too fast i have a

345
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:45,839
an abundance of

346
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,639
old straw so that's what i'm going to be

347
00:15:45,839 --> 00:15:51,920
using on my planters today you can also

348
00:15:48,639 --> 00:15:54,160
use dried leaves you know kind of ground

349
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,240
up dried leaves makes a great mulch if

350
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:57,759
you have some wood chips

351
00:15:56,240 --> 00:15:59,199
grass clippings

352
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:03,560
anything like that will make a good

353
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,560
mulch on top of your containers

354
00:16:10,160 --> 00:16:13,839
so i hope you found this video helpful

355
00:16:11,920 --> 00:16:16,240
and that you will start doing some

356
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,800
direct sewing outdoors if you're still

357
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:21,040
waiting for that final frost date to

358
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,279
pass there's a lot of things you can be

359
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:25,920
planting outdoors right now
