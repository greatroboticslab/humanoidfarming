4
00:00:23,779 --> 00:00:30,330
what what you want Ruby I was thinking

5
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,279
Ruby might have come back into heat this

6
00:00:30,330 --> 00:00:35,280
morning but she's not showing any signs

7
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:38,250
now so I guess not she stopped at the

8
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,920
buck pan I thought hmm did we not get

9
00:00:38,250 --> 00:00:48,120
your bread last dad so I think we have a

10
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:52,079
ton of goats bread starting Valentine's

11
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:57,840
Day on we should have some babies

12
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:59,010
dropping so what about you autumn you're

13
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:01,379
a teen aren't you

14
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:02,719
we're not gonna breed autumn we're not

15
00:01:01,379 --> 00:01:06,300
gonna do that to her

16
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:08,430
her little sweetness we just don't want

17
00:01:06,300 --> 00:01:12,149
to we just don't want to she's too sweet

18
00:01:08,430 --> 00:01:13,920
I don't want to mess up any of her

19
00:01:12,149 --> 00:01:17,220
awesome body condition because she looks

20
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:21,740
so healthy now so I guess she's always

21
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:23,580
been a little plump girl like her mama

22
00:01:21,740 --> 00:01:25,770
where's-where's time that's hearts

23
00:01:23,580 --> 00:01:28,140
hearts is looking pretty plump too so I

24
00:01:25,770 --> 00:01:32,520
think we bred hearts

25
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:34,610
I think fern may have had a go fancy

26
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:43,970
girl Mamie shy

27
00:01:34,610 --> 00:01:45,450
Dominique time kitty fancy too shady I

28
00:01:43,970 --> 00:01:48,239
think that's it

29
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:51,420
oh and truly I'm pretty sure she's bred

30
00:01:48,239 --> 00:01:54,440
but time right here right and I've been

31
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:57,569
talking about how she is like the

32
00:01:54,440 --> 00:02:00,720
easiest keeper and the whole herd she

33
00:01:57,569 --> 00:02:03,000
never has issues and she's always got a

34
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:06,840
thick shiny coat and she's always got a

35
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:09,479
nice plump body and she stays and milk

36
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:13,140
for a long time she's still in milk and

37
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:18,420
it's been a year since autumn was born

38
00:02:13,140 --> 00:02:20,220
so it is tempting to grate on them my

39
00:02:18,420 --> 00:02:23,520
dad thinks I should he thinks it would

40
00:02:20,220 --> 00:02:26,640
be good for her spiritually that she

41
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,680
would enjoy being a mom but sorry to add

42
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,690
I'm just not ready yet maybe next year I

43
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:31,390
just feel like anytime you breathe in

44
00:02:30,690 --> 00:02:35,130
animal

45
00:02:31,390 --> 00:02:37,450
you gotta be prayer for any type of

46
00:02:35,130 --> 00:02:39,040
pregnancy complications birthing

47
00:02:37,450 --> 00:02:42,400
complications that could potentially

48
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:44,770
harm them and I'm just not not prepared

49
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:46,510
for that with my sweet autumn so we'll

50
00:02:44,770 --> 00:02:49,390
breed her again and hopefully get

51
00:02:46,510 --> 00:02:53,290
another beautiful autumn that that won't

52
00:02:49,390 --> 00:02:56,850
end up with the deficiency that harmed

53
00:02:53,290 --> 00:03:02,070
her so much while she was developing so

54
00:02:56,850 --> 00:03:03,700
look at them goofy that kids eat goats

55
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:07,180
love my goats

56
00:03:03,700 --> 00:03:09,810
oh poor fluff another no girlfriend

57
00:03:07,180 --> 00:03:12,340
today oh you are disgusting

58
00:03:09,810 --> 00:03:14,830
poor fluffer nutters getting no pets

59
00:03:12,340 --> 00:03:17,350
from mommy if you guys remember the

60
00:03:14,830 --> 00:03:19,720
first two years that we had him in the

61
00:03:17,350 --> 00:03:22,840
fall he never really went into rut like

62
00:03:19,720 --> 00:03:25,540
he never did the whole stinky buck thing

63
00:03:22,840 --> 00:03:28,330
look at his face that is so stinky his

64
00:03:25,540 --> 00:03:30,100
ears are white normally his chest is

65
00:03:28,330 --> 00:03:33,280
whitening his beard is white he's

66
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:35,980
disgusting he's so gross in the stench

67
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:39,459
is so foul and I'm not pretty okay with

68
00:03:35,980 --> 00:03:44,100
a goat buck smell but he's gross

69
00:03:39,459 --> 00:03:47,320
well Peter pepper is not as stinky

70
00:03:44,100 --> 00:03:51,010
that's the old water by the way the new

71
00:03:47,320 --> 00:03:54,400
waters in there I got up I'm just gonna

72
00:03:51,010 --> 00:03:58,720
dump that on the grounding rod you stink

73
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:00,970
ooh boy I can't wait until rut season is

74
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:04,030
over and I could pet you again yeah he's

75
00:04:00,970 --> 00:04:08,260
been getting rough with Peter not too

76
00:04:04,030 --> 00:04:09,280
bad just an occasional random RAM he's

77
00:04:08,260 --> 00:04:12,910
still a sweet boy

78
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:16,810
Oh gross II stinky it quit spraying up

79
00:04:12,910 --> 00:04:18,910
your nostrils that's gross I guess one

80
00:04:16,810 --> 00:04:20,380
of the benefits of having a drought in

81
00:04:18,910 --> 00:04:23,380
the middle of the summer in Georgia is

82
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:26,140
that finally we're having a break from

83
00:04:23,380 --> 00:04:29,169
major parasite loads the spring weather

84
00:04:26,140 --> 00:04:31,479
that was so wet after the winter that

85
00:04:29,169 --> 00:04:34,840
had no cold weather to kill off

86
00:04:31,479 --> 00:04:36,729
parasites was very rough on us when we

87
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:38,530
went into the spring and into the

88
00:04:36,729 --> 00:04:42,910
beginning of the summer we had serious

89
00:04:38,530 --> 00:04:43,680
parasite issues in our herd we had a lot

90
00:04:42,910 --> 00:04:47,100
of

91
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,320
problems and it was very scary and we

92
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:52,560
had some losses and it was very

93
00:04:49,320 --> 00:04:54,060
difficult that all happened during the

94
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,970
time when I wasn't making videos I

95
00:04:54,060 --> 00:04:59,100
wasn't I wasn't doing well with it

96
00:04:56,970 --> 00:05:02,100
mentally or physically with my health so

97
00:04:59,100 --> 00:05:04,650
it became really hard for me to pick up

98
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:07,050
the camera so just know that every time

99
00:05:04,650 --> 00:05:10,620
you get a video from me that it's just a

100
00:05:07,050 --> 00:05:13,490
sign of me feeling better and I'm

101
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:17,009
definitely feeling a lot better mentally

102
00:05:13,490 --> 00:05:18,810
physically I think once the 90 degree

103
00:05:17,009 --> 00:05:19,770
weather cools off I think I'll be

104
00:05:18,810 --> 00:05:22,949
feeling a lot better

105
00:05:19,770 --> 00:05:25,169
the quail are doing great they just went

106
00:05:22,949 --> 00:05:26,580
through a molt so their egg-laying

107
00:05:25,169 --> 00:05:29,250
slowed down a little bit but not nearly

108
00:05:26,580 --> 00:05:30,720
as much as when a chicken molt's it

109
00:05:29,250 --> 00:05:34,020
seems like it's a faster process for

110
00:05:30,720 --> 00:05:37,199
them so we've been supplementing with

111
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:38,820
mealworms from our meal worm colony if

112
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,139
you're interested in that I'll leave a

113
00:05:38,820 --> 00:05:45,930
link to our video showing the easy way

114
00:05:43,139 --> 00:05:48,659
to grow mealworms without having all the

115
00:05:45,930 --> 00:05:51,870
extra steps of separating out the

116
00:05:48,659 --> 00:05:53,940
different stages the mealworms provide

117
00:05:51,870 --> 00:05:56,039
extra protein to help with the new

118
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:57,650
feather growth we also make sure that we

119
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:01,110
continue giving them the high-protein

120
00:05:57,650 --> 00:06:03,979
game bird feed that's really important

121
00:06:01,110 --> 00:06:07,090
to their health and keeping them

122
00:06:03,979 --> 00:06:12,870
actively laying and doing well

123
00:06:07,090 --> 00:06:16,980
[Music]

124
00:06:12,870 --> 00:06:18,810
I have to give another huge thank you to

125
00:06:16,980 --> 00:06:21,030
the people who came out for the whole

126
00:06:18,810 --> 00:06:23,010
submergence summer soirée for all of

127
00:06:21,030 --> 00:06:25,979
their help in the weeding of this garden

128
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:29,610
I am so happy to say that these

129
00:06:25,979 --> 00:06:32,580
asparagus have been regrowing through

130
00:06:29,610 --> 00:06:34,320
this drought and heat because of the

131
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:36,930
weed suppression being taken off of them

132
00:06:34,320 --> 00:06:39,690
so it looks like we're gonna have a

133
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:42,000
great asparagus harvest in the spring

134
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:44,729
because the plants are coming back into

135
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:48,570
their healthy strong health it's funny

136
00:06:44,729 --> 00:06:50,970
because in New England and other cooler

137
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:52,860
parts of the country people say that

138
00:06:50,970 --> 00:06:54,620
asparagus grows wild on the side of the

139
00:06:52,860 --> 00:06:57,720
road in in the ditches with the weeds

140
00:06:54,620 --> 00:07:00,150
but here in Georgia the slightest amount

141
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:01,710
of weed stress well not the slightest it

142
00:07:00,150 --> 00:07:03,930
does okay with chicory there's a winter

143
00:07:01,710 --> 00:07:06,690
cover crop but when it gets that

144
00:07:03,930 --> 00:07:09,090
creeping Charlie in there and the

145
00:07:06,690 --> 00:07:11,520
goldenrod that was growing up in it it

146
00:07:09,090 --> 00:07:14,250
really stressed the plants out and made

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:16,590
them not produce as much so it's

148
00:07:14,250 --> 00:07:18,470
interesting to me that it doesn't do as

149
00:07:16,590 --> 00:07:21,780
well in the south as it does the north

150
00:07:18,470 --> 00:07:24,000
obviously but that the weeds make a big

151
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:27,060
difference so we're gonna have to really

152
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,740
stay on top of it this year and once the

153
00:07:27,060 --> 00:07:32,310
winter kills back all of the screen

154
00:07:28,740 --> 00:07:34,440
fern foliage on the asparagus we're

155
00:07:32,310 --> 00:07:36,960
gonna go through and put a nice thick

156
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:40,470
layer of mulch to protect it from the

157
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:45,150
weeds in the spring our permaculture

158
00:07:40,470 --> 00:07:49,250
perennial fruit and berry bed kind of

159
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:51,360
got a hit to it the goats got out

160
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:53,150
somehow they knocked down one of the

161
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:56,340
posts probably because it's so dry out

162
00:07:53,150 --> 00:07:59,039
it loosened up in the ground and I

163
00:07:56,340 --> 00:07:59,550
looked out here and they were Mallen

164
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:05,849
down

165
00:07:59,550 --> 00:08:07,500
they ate down all the leaves off of the

166
00:08:05,849 --> 00:08:10,289
raspberries but you can see they're

167
00:08:07,500 --> 00:08:12,419
regrowing from the center so they're

168
00:08:10,289 --> 00:08:15,690
coming back but they ate down all of

169
00:08:12,419 --> 00:08:17,400
those they down all the comfrey they ate

170
00:08:15,690 --> 00:08:18,780
down all the strawberries so the

171
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:20,849
strawberries already going back here let

172
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:24,770
me show you one down here where it's

173
00:08:20,849 --> 00:08:26,669
like real obvious like this you see

174
00:08:24,770 --> 00:08:29,939
these sticks

175
00:08:26,669 --> 00:08:32,700
we're all leaves those were all leaves

176
00:08:29,939 --> 00:08:35,010
growing and so when the goats ate them

177
00:08:32,700 --> 00:08:37,529
off the strawberry started producing new

178
00:08:35,010 --> 00:08:40,260
leaves down at the base from the center

179
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:41,729
rosette so it's really bouncing back

180
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:42,300
quite well and I think it's gonna be

181
00:08:41,729 --> 00:08:43,800
fine

182
00:08:42,300 --> 00:08:46,740
we'll still have plenty of strawberry in

183
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:51,779
the spring of course all it's a tomato a

184
00:08:46,740 --> 00:08:52,410
dead dead dead did the basil went to

185
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:56,430
seed

186
00:08:52,410 --> 00:08:58,079
it's beautiful still I think but it's

187
00:08:56,430 --> 00:09:00,180
dropping its seed left and right I need

188
00:08:58,079 --> 00:09:01,649
to harvest some of these seed heads so

189
00:09:00,180 --> 00:09:03,959
that I can grow more next year this was

190
00:09:01,649 --> 00:09:08,040
a lemon basil I got from Kaylee at the

191
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:11,040
honey said this little volunteer tiny

192
00:09:08,040 --> 00:09:15,990
cherry tomato it's probably a current or

193
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,089
wild Tom one of those types it's still

194
00:09:15,990 --> 00:09:22,410
producing fruit despite the fact that

195
00:09:18,089 --> 00:09:23,760
all the other have died the peppers that

196
00:09:22,410 --> 00:09:27,899
we're producing at the beginning of the

197
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
season are dying back probably a lot to

198
00:09:27,899 --> 00:09:33,510
do with the drought plus it looks like

199
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:37,290
the goats got to it the pepino melons

200
00:09:33,510 --> 00:09:40,470
never did produce fruit so I don't know

201
00:09:37,290 --> 00:09:41,820
if it's because of the drought or we

202
00:09:40,470 --> 00:09:43,470
didn't have a long enough growing season

203
00:09:41,820 --> 00:09:46,190
I'll definitely try planting them again

204
00:09:43,470 --> 00:09:48,779
because they showed a lot of potential

205
00:09:46,190 --> 00:09:51,570
um these tomato plants have a lot of

206
00:09:48,779 --> 00:09:53,699
herbicide curl on them so they haven't

207
00:09:51,570 --> 00:09:56,880
ever produced anything really worth

208
00:09:53,699 --> 00:09:59,910
speaking my Roselle got knocked over and

209
00:09:56,880 --> 00:10:06,029
nibbled on by the goats but it is still

210
00:09:59,910 --> 00:10:08,040
producing huge huge buds so we're gonna

211
00:10:06,029 --> 00:10:09,779
be harvesting these pretty soon I don't

212
00:10:08,040 --> 00:10:12,779
want to do a video on that so hopefully

213
00:10:09,779 --> 00:10:15,510
I'll take you along and you can see what

214
00:10:12,779 --> 00:10:17,970
we do with these usually they're

215
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:19,240
standing upright like okra but they fell

216
00:10:17,970 --> 00:10:23,720
over

217
00:10:19,240 --> 00:10:26,330
peppers on this end are doing a great

218
00:10:23,720 --> 00:10:28,880
job steal these purple peppers were the

219
00:10:26,330 --> 00:10:30,200
first peppers to produce and they I

220
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:32,060
think are going to be the last ones to

221
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,740
produce they seem to me to do really

222
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:39,620
well through all temperatures of the

223
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:41,300
season this right here is one of the

224
00:10:39,620 --> 00:10:44,030
ones that I was really excited about

225
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,250
trying this year I got these seeds from

226
00:10:44,030 --> 00:10:49,970
Jess at roots and refuge and this is

227
00:10:46,250 --> 00:10:52,880
arroz con pollo and it took forever to

228
00:10:49,970 --> 00:10:55,970
start producing blooms so now it's

229
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,040
starting to bloom and some fruit is

230
00:10:55,970 --> 00:10:59,680
developing so we will definitely get to

231
00:10:58,040 --> 00:11:02,180
try it

232
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,560
my goes kind of surprised me because

233
00:11:02,180 --> 00:11:05,870
they came over here and ate all the

234
00:11:03,560 --> 00:11:07,720
horseradish leaf down so I wasn't

235
00:11:05,870 --> 00:11:11,210
expecting them to be interested in that

236
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:14,500
but it's okay the plant is regrowing

237
00:11:11,210 --> 00:11:14,500
leaves just like everything else

238
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:20,570
goldenrod is just taking off over here

239
00:11:18,050 --> 00:11:22,850
all of the plants kind of fell over but

240
00:11:20,570 --> 00:11:25,880
they are blooming like crazy and feeding

241
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:29,660
the honeybees and all the other bees and

242
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:32,110
pollinators unfortunately our main stand

243
00:11:29,660 --> 00:11:34,970
that we had from that water tank down

244
00:11:32,110 --> 00:11:37,460
got cut down during the soiree so we

245
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:38,750
don't have as much as we used to on this

246
00:11:37,460 --> 00:11:41,030
side of the garden but we still have

247
00:11:38,750 --> 00:11:44,990
some and it does spread quite easily so

248
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:47,360
we'll be fine and just over the garden

249
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:50,810
fence over here by the pond you can see

250
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:56,030
how much the drought has affected us the

251
00:11:50,810 --> 00:12:00,170
water line usually comes up to about

252
00:11:56,030 --> 00:12:03,440
where that sedges and the edge of the

253
00:12:00,170 --> 00:12:06,380
water would be here their water line

254
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:08,690
went down so far early in the season

255
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:11,030
that plants were able to grow all the

256
00:12:08,690 --> 00:12:13,310
way out to there and then it got even

257
00:12:11,030 --> 00:12:16,880
worse and the water line has receded

258
00:12:13,310 --> 00:12:20,270
even more so our pond is the lowest it's

259
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:23,870
ever been since we've lived here but we

260
00:12:20,270 --> 00:12:26,240
still have water so it's ok we still are

261
00:12:23,870 --> 00:12:29,750
feeding our wildlife and taking care of

262
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:31,850
the environment by allowing plants to

263
00:12:29,750 --> 00:12:32,150
grow around the edges of the pond that

264
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:34,910
are

265
00:12:32,150 --> 00:12:37,640
official to pollinators in other

266
00:12:34,910 --> 00:12:42,260
wildlife we're doing our part to keep

267
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:45,680
the world a little healthier the good

268
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:48,110
news is the forecast is calling for

269
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:50,420
cooling temperatures this weekend and

270
00:12:48,110 --> 00:12:53,780
next week so that means we're gonna get

271
00:12:50,420 --> 00:12:57,350
out of the 90s to us that's cooling

272
00:12:53,780 --> 00:12:59,090
temperatures a lot of people in the

273
00:12:57,350 --> 00:13:01,280
country are dealing with snow and

274
00:12:59,090 --> 00:13:05,050
freezing already and we are over here

275
00:13:01,280 --> 00:13:09,590
going it is 95 degrees it feels like 100

276
00:13:05,050 --> 00:13:11,240
not fun but thankfully it looks like

277
00:13:09,590 --> 00:13:12,710
it's going to get into the 80s and

278
00:13:11,240 --> 00:13:15,380
possibly even 70s

279
00:13:12,710 --> 00:13:19,270
next week with a chance of rain on

280
00:13:15,380 --> 00:13:23,180
Monday or Tuesday so if that happens um

281
00:13:19,270 --> 00:13:27,820
these beds are gonna be sown so quickly

282
00:13:23,180 --> 00:13:32,600
with my carrots beets collards kale and

283
00:13:27,820 --> 00:13:34,910
we will have a fall crop and I'm really

284
00:13:32,600 --> 00:13:39,110
grateful for all the help getting this

285
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:41,210
ready for fall garden and I'm really

286
00:13:39,110 --> 00:13:43,880
glad that I didn't rush to get it

287
00:13:41,210 --> 00:13:47,090
planted that week because it all would

288
00:13:43,880 --> 00:13:50,000
have died all of my friends that live in

289
00:13:47,090 --> 00:13:53,360
the area have all been posting sad sad

290
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:56,060
stories and pictures of what's happened

291
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:56,810
to their fall crops and let me tell you

292
00:13:56,060 --> 00:14:00,830
it's not pretty

293
00:13:56,810 --> 00:14:03,080
so we got lucky that we didn't do it

294
00:14:00,830 --> 00:14:04,550
when we should have as a normal season

295
00:14:03,080 --> 00:14:07,040
ghost because this season has been

296
00:14:04,550 --> 00:14:08,810
nothing close to normal all right

297
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,510
speaking of hot it is getting hot out

298
00:14:08,810 --> 00:14:13,490
here I'm gonna go inside if you haven't

299
00:14:11,510 --> 00:14:16,370
checked out our amazon links down below

300
00:14:13,490 --> 00:14:19,940
you know a while please do Amazon

301
00:14:16,370 --> 00:14:21,710
affiliate associates do rely on a slight

302
00:14:19,940 --> 00:14:23,900
Commission being earned every month or

303
00:14:21,710 --> 00:14:25,370
they will cancel it due to the fact that

304
00:14:23,900 --> 00:14:28,970
I haven't been producing videos very

305
00:14:25,370 --> 00:14:30,590
often our Amazon sales have declined all

306
00:14:28,970 --> 00:14:32,780
you gotta do is use the link it doesn't

307
00:14:30,590 --> 00:14:34,640
charge you any extra it's the same cost

308
00:14:32,780 --> 00:14:37,400
to you it just gives us a tiny

309
00:14:34,640 --> 00:14:42,200
Commission off of each of the sales used

310
00:14:37,400 --> 00:14:45,530
in our link so it's very appreciated if

311
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:45,980
you do so if you do shop on Amazon it's

312
00:14:45,530 --> 00:14:47,690
a great way

313
00:14:45,980 --> 00:14:49,400
to help support the channel and our

314
00:14:47,690 --> 00:14:51,440

315
00:14:49,400 --> 00:14:54,500
continued to use the Amazon link I

316
00:14:51,440 --> 00:14:57,320
really appreciate it it has kept us

317
00:14:54,500 --> 00:15:00,380
being able to keep an active status so

318
00:14:57,320 --> 00:15:03,200
hopefully we'll see an increase here as

319
00:15:00,380 --> 00:15:04,930
we start producing more videos thank you

320
00:15:03,200 --> 00:15:08,070
