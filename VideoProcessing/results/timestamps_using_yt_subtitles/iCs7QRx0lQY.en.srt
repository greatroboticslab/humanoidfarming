00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,750
wow I love finding old garden books this

2
00:00:03,750 --> 00:00:09,300
is called the garden of experience by

3
00:00:06,750 --> 00:00:12,599
the author of garden of ignorance and

4
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,519
these old garden books are so cool they

5
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:16,650
don't have pictures so they had to be

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:18,810
excellent garden Writers to actually

7
00:00:16,650 --> 00:00:20,699
paint a picture of what it was that you

8
00:00:18,810 --> 00:00:23,100
were learning the garden and creating a

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:26,490
garden so look at this when I found is

10
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:30,240
called a sense of humors and it is

11
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:32,430
another book written 0 60 years ago and

12
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,620
and the pages even the fact that they're

13
00:00:32,430 --> 00:00:36,809
faded makes it just really cool to dive

14
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:40,110
into really old gardening books here's

15
00:00:36,809 --> 00:00:42,809
when this called the embattled male in

16
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:46,469
the garden now hopefully it's written by

17
00:00:42,809 --> 00:00:49,140
a female and even has the old seattle

18
00:00:46,469 --> 00:00:51,210
public library i found these old books

19
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,210
at a store that specializes in antique

20
00:00:51,210 --> 00:00:56,910
garden books but i also found this one

21
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:58,559
this is down the garden path now it's

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:00,960
written by a famous garden writer called

23
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,210
beverly nichols but when you read old

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,189
garden books like this it doesn't matter

25
00:01:03,210 --> 00:01:08,100
there's no pictures because of the

26
00:01:05,189 --> 00:01:09,720
garden tips some of the advice in this

27
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:11,970
book one thing I remember Beverly

28
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:15,030
Nichols writing about was when you water

29
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:17,310
lilies to use lukewarm water now that's

30
00:01:15,030 --> 00:01:19,320
something I'd never heard before and

31
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:21,990
it's something that he learned you know

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,880
a hundred years ago growing lilies now

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:26,880
if you can't find old antique garden

34
00:01:23,880 --> 00:01:28,560

35
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,350

writer this one is Rhapsody in green and

38
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,340
it's and it's kind of the best of some

39
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:41,340
of the old gardening advice that was

40
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,380

start checking out some of these old

43
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,570
historical garden books it's a great way

44
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,930
to really get down and dirty without

00:01:51,570 --> 00:01:53,930
going outside
