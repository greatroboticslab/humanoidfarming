1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,719
not sure if this is the best way to get

2
00:00:01,959 --> 00:00:05,200
a hold of Courtney but if so I

3
00:00:03,719 --> 00:00:07,359
appreciate your time reading this and

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,719
hopefully getting some feedback I

5
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:10,840
followed and watched most of your

6
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,200
YouTube videos and you're really one of

7
00:00:10,840 --> 00:00:14,480
the reasons I want to get serious about

8
00:00:12,200 --> 00:00:17,760
selling tractor attachments uh-oh this

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:20,039
might be backfiring I'm I'm inspiring

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:21,439
competition I live in North Carolina I

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:23,760
bought and sold used attachments for a

12
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,519
while on Marketplace in some occasions I

13
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:27,160
buy them broken fix them and sell them I

14
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,199
really enjoy doing it and it brings in

15
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:30,800
some extra cash I have a full-time job

16
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,759
that I also love and pays well too this

17
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,559
is where I need your feedback or at

18
00:00:32,759 --> 00:00:36,760
least what you think I want to get into

19
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:38,960
buying and selling used and new

20
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:40,800
attachments as a real business I guess I

21
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,320
should just get an LLC how do I go about

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,520
selling new how do I even make money

23
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:45,640
selling new I see attachments and it

24
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:48,879
looks like it would be cheaper to just

25
00:00:45,640 --> 00:00:50,760
buy them off of marketplace nope sorry

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,120
sorry I see attachments and it looks

27
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:54,800
like it would be cheaper to just buy

28
00:00:52,120 --> 00:00:57,640
them off the

29
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:59,519
manufacturer yes that's that's pretty

30
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:01,199
straightforward there I feel like I need

31
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:03,399
a lot of money just to even place an

32
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
order to have some attachments in stock

33
00:01:03,399 --> 00:01:06,799
if that's how it works is there a

34
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,000
minimum number of attachments that I

35
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,520
have to buy do I have to be a dealer I

36
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:12,040
really don't know how it works I visited

37
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:14,080
and talked to the owners of two local

38
00:01:12,040 --> 00:01:15,880
farm equipment stores I talked to them

39
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:18,400
and both roughly said not to get into

40
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:19,880
the business jokingly I think they were

41
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:21,560
nice guys but a little disappointed on

42
00:01:19,880 --> 00:01:22,960
what they told me I'm hoping they were

43
00:01:21,560 --> 00:01:25,439
just too busy to talk to me for that

44
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,479
long I have a local company that sells

45
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,640
attachments I can start with them I

46
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:30,600
don't mind the work it's just I don't

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,680
know where to start

48
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,560
you don't really have to answer every

49
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,119
single question above I just don't know

50
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,560
what the right question is to ask I

51
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,439
appreciate you taking time to read this

52
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:42,079
thank you okay so a lot going on here

53
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:43,680
and I I'm joking about helping the

54
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,320
competition I mean

55
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:48,840
I I'm confident enough in my abilities

56
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:51,719
to know that I I've got my own market

57
00:01:48,840 --> 00:01:53,159
and that there's a ton of tractor

58
00:01:51,719 --> 00:01:55,880
attachment dealers out there that really

59
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,600
only sell locally and there's some you

60
00:01:55,880 --> 00:02:00,039
know I have some online competition too

61
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:03,439
I'm I'm not I'm fully aware of that and

62
00:02:00,039 --> 00:02:04,960
that's the way of the world and it does

63
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,360
complicate things quite a bit more if

64
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:09,360
you're going to go online and and sell

65
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:14,160
Nationwide but in

66
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:16,120
general how I started out selling was

67
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,000
Finding attachments that I wanted to

68
00:02:16,120 --> 00:02:21,000
sell right so let's just take pallet

69
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,280
forks for example and those are one of

70
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:24,680
the most popular tractor attachments

71
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,760
that are out there and there's probably

72
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,000
100 or 150 manufacturers that make those

73
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,840
and they're all going to be at different

74
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:35,280
price points you know different weight

75
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,760
ratings configurations and um areas of U

76
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:38,800
the countries of origin where where

77
00:02:36,760 --> 00:02:40,760
they're manufactured and and yada yada

78
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,080
yada so the other issue is that you're

79
00:02:40,760 --> 00:02:43,440
going to have some manufacturers that

80
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,920
will sell directly a lot of

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:47,159
Manufacturers that uh will sell through

82
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:49,800
Distributors that maybe like a

83
00:02:47,159 --> 00:02:51,239
distributor covers Michigan where I'm at

84
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,000
for example then a different distributor

85
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:56,319
covers Indiana you know and so maybe you

86
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,080
have to go through that layer um some

87
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:01,760
manufacturers just sell directly and so

88
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:04,080
you you can't even work with them and so

89
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,920
it's take that times every single

90
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:07,959
attachment you want to sell and you have

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:10,000
to go through that process and then

92
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:11,599
see what's going to work for you what

93
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,159
kind of relationships you can get what

94
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:14,519
kind of minimum buys you have to buy

95
00:03:13,159 --> 00:03:16,879
everyone's going to be different there's

96
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:18,959
not going to be a a standard answer for

97
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,879
every brand that you're working with we

98
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:23,480
actually manufacture some attachments

99
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,040
and sell uh to dealers as well and so

100
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:28,640
we'll do bundle buys with minimum

101
00:03:26,040 --> 00:03:30,000
quantities and since we ship Nationwide

102
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,200
you know normally when we had stuff

103
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,959
shipped into us from our fabricator that

104
00:03:32,200 --> 00:03:36,720
manufactures for us it's you know on a

105
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,760
pallet that contains a set quantity of

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:43,319
whatever that item is so that's how we

107
00:03:39,760 --> 00:03:45,159
do our our sales with dealers is that

108
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,760
they need to buy based on the pallet

109
00:03:45,159 --> 00:03:49,040
quantity because it's it just comes in

110
00:03:46,760 --> 00:03:51,080
like that it's set like that it's easy

111
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,560
to ship out it's already prepackaged and

112
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:55,200
then we give a bundle discount based on

113
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,200
that to to send out to dealers and so

114
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:58,720
you're going to

115
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,760
find I don't think most manufacturers

116
00:03:58,720 --> 00:04:02,799
work it that way they're just going to

117
00:04:00,760 --> 00:04:04,680
tack on freight based on whatever it is

118
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,200
you order at the end of the year like

119
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:08,079
say now a lot of Manufacturers will give

120
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:09,959
you an incentive an extra incentive to

121
00:04:08,079 --> 00:04:11,079
place an order for next spring but

122
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,079
there's

123
00:04:11,079 --> 00:04:14,360
no the only way that you can find this

124
00:04:13,079 --> 00:04:16,680
stuff out is doing it so you need to

125
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:18,720
reach out and call and this applies to

126
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,800
any industry this isn't just tractor

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:24,520
stuff if you want to sell computer parts

128
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:26,080
or anything else it's it's the same kind

129
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:27,919
of a concept where you're going to find

130
00:04:26,080 --> 00:04:30,479
that there's no standard way that every

131
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:32,960
single manufacturer in your segment is

132
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,560
operating with a a set of the same set

133
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:35,919
of rules they all have different rules

134
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,199
they all have different price points and

135
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:41,320
I will say that the closer you can get

136
00:04:38,199 --> 00:04:43,080
to the manufacturer and get out of the

137
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:44,800
Distributors typically the better

138
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:47,520
pricing you're going to have um

139
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:49,680
sometimes the manufacturers are aware of

140
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,680
that and will just make their price a

141
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,600
bit higher and keep some more profit for

142
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:56,120
themselves which more power to them but

143
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:58,280
otherwise if you have to go from a

144
00:04:56,120 --> 00:05:00,240
manufacturer to a distributor and then

145
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,400
to you for example well that's more

146
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,199
people that need to make money on top of

147
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,320
it keep in mind you then have to Market

148
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,639
up to sell to a an end user as well and

149
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:13,000
and that's going to work against you the

150
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:14,840
cheaper the price point maybe not the

151
00:05:13,000 --> 00:05:16,080
cheaper or lower quality product but

152
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:18,240
just the lower the price point in

153
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:21,319
general the more likely you are to sell

154
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:23,360
that product too so that just comes with

155
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:25,039
putting the time in talking to people

156
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:27,280
you know and comes with the weeks the

157
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:30,520
months the years that go by on

158
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,960
understanding how that gain is played so

159
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,560
let's let's move on to the next point or

160
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:34,880
next question that he had folks we are

solutions.com he asked if he should get

179
00:06:03,960 --> 00:06:08,039
an LLC and yeah I mean I would contact

180
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:09,639
your accountant and and maybe an

181
00:06:08,039 --> 00:06:12,120
attorney uh to do it the right way or

182
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,759
just go to Legal Zoom or at least

want to have protection for your

185
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,440
business to separate that from your your

186
00:06:17,720 --> 00:06:21,400
personal accounts and everything else so

187
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:22,759
keep that separation there get set up

188
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:26,039
for taxes and and everything else

189
00:06:22,759 --> 00:06:27,680
separately and take advantage of um

190
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:28,960
those policies when you can feel like

191
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:30,759
you need a lot of money to even place in

192
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:34,440
order to have some attachments in stock

193
00:06:30,759 --> 00:06:35,919
well yes and no uh it does really it

194
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:38,160
does take money to make money in my

195
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:40,919
opinion at least a significant amount

196
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,800
but once you become credit worthy with a

197
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:44,400
lot of different well within your

198
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,880
industry you're going to find that you

199
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,440
can get credit terms it's not going to

200
00:06:45,880 --> 00:06:49,360
be a cash basis where if you place an

201
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:51,400
order you have to pay for it right then

202
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:54,199
before it's delivered but you can get

203
00:06:51,400 --> 00:06:56,759
maybe uh 30 60 90 day 180-day terms

204
00:06:54,199 --> 00:06:58,400
depending on what it is and you could

205
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:01,120
potentially if you know what you're

206
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:03,080
doing have all of your inventory sold

207
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,520
and have that cash come in by the time

208
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:07,479
that you have to make the payment in 180

209
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:10,120
days or 90 days whatever it is so you

210
00:07:07,479 --> 00:07:11,680
potentially could use no cash of your

211
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:13,800
own at a certain point but that is going

212
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:16,440
to be tough to do upfront without any

213
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:17,639
kind of creditworthiness in the industry

214
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:20,000
and then finally he doesn't know where

215
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:21,919
to start and that is a good place to

216
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:23,280
start is asking the questions you can't

217
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,680
be

218
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,720
afraid well I think a lot of folks would

219
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,120
be afraid to go into a a tractor

220
00:07:27,720 --> 00:07:31,400
dealership like he did with a couple of

221
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:33,440
play and ask them how to do this because

222
00:07:31,400 --> 00:07:37,280
you're asking your competition how I can

223
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,879
compete against you and I don't blame

224
00:07:37,280 --> 00:07:41,639
those dealers for not giving him a lot

225
00:07:38,879 --> 00:07:43,000
of information and I also told this

226
00:07:41,639 --> 00:07:46,159
gentleman I'm not going to give you all

227
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:49,360
of the secrets right it's you know

228
00:07:46,159 --> 00:07:51,240
I again it comes back to don't be afraid

229
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,800
to ask the question but expect to be

230
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,280
told no and when you're not told no then

231
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:56,800
great take advantage of that opportunity

232
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,440
and glean what you can from it but

233
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,720
that's the only way you're going to grow

234
00:07:58,440 --> 00:08:01,199
is putting yourself out out there and

235
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:04,560
taking risk like we've talked about

236
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,319
before and this risk really isn't I mean

237
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,000
maybe it affects some of your ego and

238
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,159
that's about it right it's it's it's

239
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,280
costing you a little bit of time but

240
00:08:10,159 --> 00:08:12,919
you're going to learn something from it

241
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:14,199
either way I mean every interaction you

242
00:08:12,919 --> 00:08:15,000
have you're going to learn something

243
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:17,000
from it and that doesn't mean you're

244
00:08:15,000 --> 00:08:18,520
learning something from a dealer that

245
00:08:17,000 --> 00:08:21,080
tells you go away I'm not going to help

246
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,360
you out at all but maybe then you know

247
00:08:21,080 --> 00:08:24,159
how to approach the situation

248
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:25,800
differently the next time around too and

249
00:08:24,159 --> 00:08:26,840
so you can get better from that you can

250
00:08:25,800 --> 00:08:28,800
improve from that and you're going to

251
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,440
find that you become more efficient with

252
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,120
your own time the more often that you do

253
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:33,440
it so hopefully that helps some other

254
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:35,279
folks out there that are thinking the

255
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:37,360
same things that this guy took the time

256
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:39,320
to email me about and I appreciate him

257
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:41,760
