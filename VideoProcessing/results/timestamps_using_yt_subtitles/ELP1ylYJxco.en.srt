1
00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,880
insect pets are a major problem in

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,200
vegetable production systems there are

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:09,000
three ways of controlling insect pets as

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
part of integrated Pest Management or

5
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,000
IPM approach those are system based

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,720
practices mechanical practices and

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,800
insecticide trap crops are based on the

8
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:21,160
principle of host preference that is

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,960
insects have strong preference for food

10
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,080
and actively seek the most appropriate

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:28,000
host plants trap crops lure insects away

12
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,000
from the main crop insecticide

13
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,640
applications made to the Trap crop prent

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,600
prents migration of pest into the main

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,840
crop advantages of trap cropping include

16
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:40,320
a low cost of Technology seed is the

17
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:43,320
only cost compatibility with current

18
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:45,000
forming practices increased biodiversity

19
00:00:43,320 --> 00:00:48,440
protection of natural enemies and

20
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:50,440
reduction in Inc deide usage success of

21
00:00:48,440 --> 00:00:52,800
the Trap crop depends on the choice of

22
00:00:50,440 --> 00:00:55,000
trap crops and on designer layout if the

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:57,199
pest source is unknown is recommended to

24
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,519
use perimeter system with the Trap crops

25
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,840
planted on all sides of the main crop

26
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,119
this works well in small forms and

27
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,159
rectangular Fields strip inter planting

28
00:01:04,119 --> 00:01:09,200
is more complex system and is suitable

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:11,159
for large forms here is a photo of a

30
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,159
perimeter trap crop demonstration aimed

31
00:01:11,159 --> 00:01:15,960
at reducing Lea footed bug damage in

32
00:01:13,159 --> 00:01:18,840
tomatoes in this case all four sides

33
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:21,360
around the M crop replanted to nk300

34
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,200
variety of Ford sorghum the pest is

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,240
attracted to the head or Pentacle of

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:27,079
sorghum planted two weeks before the

37
00:01:25,240 --> 00:01:30,119
main

00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:32,799
crop here's a photo of strip intercop C

39
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,640
in system where nk300 soron was planted

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:38,000
in a wide swath across a large vegetable

41
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:40,159
field remember to scout the Trap crop

42
00:01:38,000 --> 00:01:42,320
for Target Pest and use insecticides

43
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,759
during Peak insect activity to reduce

44
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,479
pest

45
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:48,360
population if the pest is known trap

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,880
crops can be used in a highly efficient

47
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:53,079
manner using the sore sink approach in

48
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,439
this layout trap crops are planted at

49
00:01:53,079 --> 00:01:57,880
specific locations to arrest insect

50
00:01:55,439 --> 00:02:00,119
migration it may take a few years of

51
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:02,799
trap crop use on inform form to generate

52
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,840
sufficient knowledge about the pest

00:02:04,840 --> 00:02:09,440
representation of how sorghum trap crops

55
00:02:07,159 --> 00:02:11,959
work for leaf footed bug control under

56
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:14,400
high pest pressure the Trap crops served

57
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:16,800
as source of food and Maiden sight two

58
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:19,360
insecticide treatments on sorum were

59
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,319
sufficient to reduce 78% of leaf footed

60
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:24,040
bugs without treating the main

61
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:26,040
crop here's a video of leaf footed bugs

62
00:02:24,040 --> 00:02:28,560
on sorghum trap crop in Southwest

63
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:31,280
Alabama notice the high concentration of

64
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,959
leaf footed bugs on every ear in the

65
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,959
absence of trap crop the leaf of the

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:38,599
bugs will feed on tomatoes and other

67
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,239
crops resulting in very poor quality of

68
00:02:38,599 --> 00:02:43,680
produce producers can use trout crops

69
00:02:41,239 --> 00:02:45,640
creatively on their Farm in this case a

70
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,599
producer in Alabama use sunflower and

71
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:49,280
sorum trap crops all along the fence

72
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,920
near the road making his field look

73
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:54,120
attractive to cu's customers trap crops

74
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:57,720
can also provide some weed control and

75
00:02:54,120 --> 00:02:57,720
wind reduction as side

76
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:02,239
benefits there are many limitations of

77
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,239
trap crop system that can be overcome

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,159
with experience for additional
