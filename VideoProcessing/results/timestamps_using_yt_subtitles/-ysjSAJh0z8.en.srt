3
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:22,320
So folks that meet us say, "Oh, so you

4
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:24,400
guys are no tillers." And I say, "No,

5
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,880
we're not no tillers. We're regenerative

6
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:30,000
a people,

7
00:00:25,880 --> 00:00:34,120
enthusiasts." because uh noill is not a

8
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:37,120
system. Noill is one tool that we

9
00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,160
use. You can't be successful if you

10
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,399
think you're going to be a no- tiller

11
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:46,320
because you have to change your paradigm

12
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:49,440
about what you plant the diversity. um

13
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:53,520
keeping a living root and especially

14
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:57,559
integrating cattle because uh we think

15
00:00:53,520 --> 00:01:01,039
that the cattle are the most important

16
00:00:57,559 --> 00:01:03,760
thing. I'm going to name drop a few

17
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:07,520
folks that are influential in my life.

18
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:09,920
There's a guy named Jim Garish who uh

19
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:12,960
came to a grazing school in Watertown,

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:16,159
South Dakota, and made us repeat 10

21
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:20,159
times during his session. I will not be

22
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:23,280
afraid to waste grass, which is uh just

23
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:28,320
a real change for us. There's a man out

24
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,119
in western Canada named Steve Kenyon who

25
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,960
custom grazes cattle for folks. He has

26
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,520
some of his own herd and he's got sheep

27
00:01:32,960 --> 00:01:39,920
now. But he said when when people say it

28
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:44,240
takes a thousand years to add an inch of

29
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,960
top soil, he says I can increase top

30
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:50,720
soil by an inch in 7 years through

31
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,240
integrating cattle. Um those people get

32
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:57,119
me excited and that's why I enjoy what

33
00:01:54,240 --> 00:02:00,320
we're doing and it's just a whole bunch

34
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:03,390
of fun to have Eli agree with me and get

35
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:05,360
excited about it, too.

36
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:09,920
[Music]

37
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:13,120
I got sold from Gabe Brown. Um when when

38
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:17,360
Barry had had listened to him um before

39
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:21,040
I had and and you know I think it was uh

40
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:24,879
about January 2018 when I I saw him at a

41
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:27,760
soil health coalition uh conference and

42
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,160
listening to him talk about what he

43
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:33,519
does.

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:35,440
Um it's a goal. It's great because we

45
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,080
know now we have so many things we could

46
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:40,640
accomplish on our farm. It's just we're

47
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,959
always building on it. But when he said

48
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:45,840
that he would bet his farm against

49
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:49,680
anyone's farm that what he does would

50
00:02:45,840 --> 00:02:51,360
work on their farm, uh I took that as a

51
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,360
challenge to prove him right instead of

52
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:56,480
a challenge to prove him wrong because

53
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,519
why wouldn't you want to be doing what

54
00:02:56,480 --> 00:03:03,599
he's doing? And the biggest thing for us

55
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:06,000
I think was the context part. Um you you

56
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,720
can fail easily at at anything if you

57
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,760
try. But if if you look at your context

58
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:14,400
and you and you study what your climate

59
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,640
is, uh how things will fit into your

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:19,400
system, you can make soil health work on

61
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,239
every acre

62
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:25,879
anywhere. We've lost acres and added

63
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:30,000
acres in the last 10 years. Um, we we

64
00:03:25,879 --> 00:03:33,200
added a few quarters of of heavy soil in

65
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,560
this area and we added another quarter

66
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:40,120
or two of just some really light soil.

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:42,480
And it's our approach is the same. You

68
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:45,360
it's, you know, what can we do with soil

69
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,200
health on those acres? And we know it's

70
00:03:45,360 --> 00:03:50,560
going to work if we just stick to the

71
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:53,920
principles and and look at at our our

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:55,680
context of all that.

73
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:57,680
You know, when we did look at our

74
00:03:55,680 --> 00:04:00,400
context, we we were thinking, okay, we

75
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:02,560
we like the cover crops. We want we want

76
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:04,480
more cover crops. We want we want to be

77
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:08,319
able to plant as many species as

78
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:10,720
possible every year. And so we were we

79
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,560
were doing uh spring wheat for small

80
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,560
grain. And and we realized that we

81
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:18,639
didn't have enough growing season to to

82
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,440
get the cover crop growth after spring

83
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,199
wheat. So, one thing we we did was we

84
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,840
started planting a lot more winter

85
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:28,320
wheat. Uh we're doing a lot of oats this

86
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:32,280
year, just knowing that we can get that

87
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:35,360
crop off earlier and get a cover crop

88
00:04:32,280 --> 00:04:39,440
going. You know, we we did 17 species

89
00:04:35,360 --> 00:04:44,040
this year of cuz we know how many pounds

90
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:44,040
an acre of each thing we can add.

91
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:50,520
So, one of the things we did is

92
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:53,680
converted crop land to pasture. Um,

93
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:57,280
and that was a learning experience, but

94
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:59,360
it worked out very well for us. And, uh,

95
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:02,720
and now we're transitioning that field

96
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:06,400
back into crop land because we can, I

97
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:09,199
guess. Uh we we never want to give up

98
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:12,720
the experiments because every conference

99
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:16,160
we go to, we hear something new that we

100
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:18,800
just got to try on this farm. And I I

101
00:05:16,160 --> 00:05:20,960
guess at this point I need to say that

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,039
without the South Dakota Grassland

103
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,840
Coalition and the South Dakota Soil

104
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,639
Health Coalition, we probably wouldn't

105
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:32,840
have gotten access to an awful lot of

106
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:35,520
excellent material that we've

107
00:05:32,840 --> 00:05:38,080
assimulated. And I appreciate the folks

108
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,840
that are willing to go to a conference,

109
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:44,320
stand up in front of a crowd, and

110
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:46,479
explain to us what they've been doing.

111
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:50,479
So, we're going to work on staying on

112
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,080
this land as as long as possible. And,

113
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:54,280
you know, we we've got the river bottom

114
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:57,600
land. We know none of it's native

115
00:05:54,280 --> 00:06:01,360
because sand was really easy to plow.

116
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:04,400
And so, we we need to work on on that

117
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,759
land. We we know that the previous

118
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:10,080
practices on it had depleted it. What it

119
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:12,800
was before that is what we need to get

120
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:15,600
back to. what the, you know, the

121
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:17,759
migrating buffalo did to it. We need to

122
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,919
replicate that and and work with that

123
00:06:17,759 --> 00:06:21,919
and and we know that it'll be beneficial

124
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:24,639
and it'll it'll make the land more

125
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:29,479
valuable and it'll it'll keep my family

126
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:29,479
here, our family here for generations.
