00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:02,850
I'm here with Steve the owner sprinkler

2
00:00:01,650 --> 00:00:04,900
where how he's about to tell us how we

3
00:00:02,850 --> 00:00:09,370
run wire to our sprinkler systems

4
00:00:04,900 --> 00:00:09,370
[Music]

5
00:00:10,250 --> 00:00:14,370
what kind of why are we running today

6
00:00:12,300 --> 00:00:16,710
Steve where we're gonna be running

7
00:00:14,370 --> 00:00:19,710
direct burial irrigation wire today it's

8
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:21,570
16 gauge wire and it's made for direct

9
00:00:19,710 --> 00:00:23,400
burials so we do not have to worry about

10
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:27,539
running conduit all the way back to the

11
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:29,130
controller we can just run the wire in

12
00:00:27,539 --> 00:00:31,920
the ground in the same trenches as the

13
00:00:29,130 --> 00:00:33,690
pipe and we'll just tuck the wire up

14
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,180
underneath the pipe just to protect it

15
00:00:33,690 --> 00:00:37,860
from any shovels in the future or

16
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,739
anything like that the best we can we'll

17
00:00:37,860 --> 00:00:42,120
tuck it up underneath but again we don't

18
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:44,309
have to worry about running conduit

19
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,289
because we are using wire that's that's

20
00:00:44,309 --> 00:00:48,360
designed for direct burial out here in

21
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,550
the yard we're gonna be running our wire

22
00:00:48,360 --> 00:00:53,160
from the controller in this situation

23
00:00:50,550 --> 00:00:54,960
it's in the backyard in the garage we're

24
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,629
gonna be coming from that controller

25
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,820
around the back of the property down the

26
00:00:57,629 --> 00:01:01,710
side of the house and then across the

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:04,799
front over here to our furthest bowels

28
00:01:01,710 --> 00:01:07,260
away from the controller so starting

29
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:09,720
here we need to make sure that we've got

30
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,670
a red wire or a hot wire for each valve

31
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:13,380
in this case we've got three valves so

32
00:01:11,670 --> 00:01:14,939
we're gonna have three red wires but you

33
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,430
only need one common that's it

34
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:19,710
not ten yes can you change yeah daisy

35
00:01:17,430 --> 00:01:22,080
chain we would normally run the wire

36
00:01:19,710 --> 00:01:24,960
straight from these valves all the way

37
00:01:22,080 --> 00:01:26,759
back to the controller and tucking the

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:29,040
wire underneath the pipe to protect it

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:31,470
but we got to be careful I always advise

40
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:32,549
people walk the property back to the

41
00:01:31,470 --> 00:01:34,470
controller and make sure you're not

42
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:36,000
going to cross any obstacles that would

43
00:01:34,470 --> 00:01:38,850
prevent you from running the wire in

44
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,860
this case as as we've been discussing

45
00:01:38,850 --> 00:01:42,060
here and you can see we've got a

46
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:45,000
sidewalk to deal with

47
00:01:42,060 --> 00:01:46,829
we've gone under it earlier with a piece

48
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:49,770
of conduit so that we prepared ourselves

49
00:01:46,829 --> 00:01:51,899
to go into this with wire so instead of

50
00:01:49,770 --> 00:01:54,360
starting here and rolling our rolls back

51
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:57,090
we're gonna start here bring the wire

52
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,850
underneath in the conduit over to the

53
00:01:57,090 --> 00:02:01,740
valves hook up the valves and finish

54
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,659
running the wire around the side of the

55
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:05,250
house to the backyard after we've done

56
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:07,530
these we'll start over here on these

57
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,420
valves we'll run our two red wires all

58
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:11,250
the way back to the controller again

59
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:12,540
and then we'll finish up with our valves

60
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:15,090
that are in the backyard and do the same

61
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:16,709
thing all right now I've pulled the wire

62
00:02:15,090 --> 00:02:18,239
down to the valve I'm gonna tuck it in

63
00:02:16,709 --> 00:02:20,970
underneath the pipe and I'm gonna leave

64
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:22,860
about two and a half feet of coil

65
00:02:20,970 --> 00:02:24,959
because you want to have about two and a

66
00:02:22,860 --> 00:02:28,220
half extra feet to coil up for to

67
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,220
protect for surges

68
00:02:31,170 --> 00:02:37,210
all right so this right here is a little

69
00:02:34,870 --> 00:02:38,920
coil and we're gonna make one on the

70
00:02:37,210 --> 00:02:41,170
rest of these wires now what this does

71
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:43,420
is as it adds a little bit of a extra

72
00:02:41,170 --> 00:02:47,280
protection against power surges so we're

73
00:02:43,420 --> 00:02:47,280
gonna take a little pipe like this

74
00:02:47,550 --> 00:02:52,030
unwrap our cabling we're gonna go ahead

75
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,650
and leave some slack right there we're

76
00:02:52,030 --> 00:02:59,440
gonna wrap it around right down here

77
00:02:53,650 --> 00:03:06,370
like this boom coil then you do that to

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:15,450
all of them just took a little extra

79
00:03:06,370 --> 00:03:15,450
down start your

80
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:26,569
[Music]

81
00:03:23,340 --> 00:03:26,569

84
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,930
so he goes from this one to that one we

85
00:03:58,670 --> 00:04:01,930
have our control

and don't forget your waterproof wire

91
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:46,980
nuts

94
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:29,219
take the white wire only and I'm gonna

95
00:05:27,210 --> 00:05:31,940
pull white wire I need you to let the

96
00:05:29,219 --> 00:05:35,000
roll or white wire

101
00:06:16,870 --> 00:06:20,169
now in order to protect your wires from

102
00:06:18,970 --> 00:06:22,210
damage you're gonna want to run it

103
00:06:20,169 --> 00:06:23,560
through some PVC conduit from where it

104
00:06:22,210 --> 00:06:26,310
comes out of the ground all the way to

105
00:06:23,560 --> 00:06:26,310
your smart control

107
00:06:36,290 --> 00:06:40,000

[Music]

110
00:07:12,770 --> 00:07:17,669
alright now we got all the wires running

111
00:07:14,819 --> 00:07:19,169
to our controller we have our rain

112
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:20,669
sensor wire right here we're gonna hook

113
00:07:19,169 --> 00:07:21,960
that up we got our common wire we're

114
00:07:20,669 --> 00:07:23,849
gonna hook that up as well

115
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:25,439
we're gonna turn the power onto this

116
00:07:23,849 --> 00:07:27,840
thing and then what we're gonna do is

117
00:07:25,439 --> 00:07:29,460
we're gonna strip the red wires one by

118
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,710
one and we're gonna touch them to a

119
00:07:29,460 --> 00:07:33,960
powered terminal what that's gonna do is

120
00:07:31,710 --> 00:07:35,939
gonna start to isolate which wire goes

121
00:07:33,960 --> 00:07:37,590
to which zone because we don't know

122
00:07:35,939 --> 00:07:39,689
which wire goes to which is own at this

123
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:42,240
point so if we turn on terminal number

124
00:07:39,689 --> 00:07:43,409
one and start touching a wire to it what

125
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:46,169
what's gonna happen is it's gonna turn

126
00:07:43,409 --> 00:07:47,849
on one of the zones in our yard let's

127
00:07:46,169 --> 00:07:49,439
just say that turns on number seven we

128
00:07:47,849 --> 00:07:52,319
count one two three four five six seven

129
00:07:49,439 --> 00:07:55,710
connect it to number seven over here and

130
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:57,419
go on down the line until we know which

131
00:07:55,710 --> 00:07:58,860
wire goes to which zone and then we

132
00:07:57,419 --> 00:08:01,789
connect it to that corresponding zone

133
00:07:58,860 --> 00:08:01,789
let's get started

134
00:08:05,180 --> 00:08:11,060
okay that's number that's the flower bed

135
00:08:08,550 --> 00:08:11,060
so that

136
00:08:11,169 --> 00:08:14,560
number six
