  "text": "[Music] the smell of that stuff you know it's it's alive it's not dead i just enjoy watching mother nature working i mean it's it's it's intriguing i mean if you've never been around doing composting and then you see it change on a daily basis as you turn it it's impressive most people say well that can't be that to this it is we've been farming roughly around 1500 acres of uh last year was probably the most diverse that we've ever been and having we had rye we had peas we had sunflowers edible beans soy beans alfalfa and wheat so we from a few years ago we were just basically doing uh soybeans and wheat and so we have gone to to more of a diverse farming operation which i think is is is helpful in management or or to try to get your biology going so this is our feedlot facility which we call hollywood feeders here in toronto south dakota and we're a permitted facility for 34.99 head of beef cattle so in a standard monoslope type barn the livestock are bedded with straw and and then that combines with their manure and you have a bed pack situation olsen custom farms we farm about 12 000 acres in in minnesota and south dakota so dual county lincoln county uh minnesota and a little bit over in hamlin county south dakota as well right now we farm we're right around 2200 acres soybeans corn sugar beets and and we do have wheat every so we don't have any wheat this year we'll chop some of the corn for silage but we tend to feed a lot of the beet pulp from the from the factory but it's nice again to fit in with spreading the manure if we're chopping silage we know we can spread some manure and compost so that works out really well so with the feed lot we're um we're allowed 999 through the state we normally run about oh there's probably 500 that we feed in there almost all finishing so the feed lot processes is i'll go in about every well right around this time every year with the excavator and pile our piles pile our piles where that we put our bedding i'll pile as high as it'll go and then we have we have our sloped feed lot that goes into lagoon so all that leachate runs in the lagoon the manure starts to dry out and then after a while normally it's normally it's mid-august we'll start to haul that that manure out we try to do it in about two two and a half days that's our goal anyway so we tend to we'll hire a contractor to come in with one of those big trucks to haul and then i just load them with the excavator which works really well normally we have about um per year we have about probably 4 000 tons of manure but like this year it's a double year we really had a wet year last year so we're trying to figure out what we're going to do there we try to plant our acres based on the crop that we're going to go into i like to go into corn but we have in the past done it where we'll spread on ground that's going into sugar beets because normally that's weak sometimes wheat ground so we can get it we know we're going to get it spread we can spread lime we can spread manure so we've done that the last couple years like i said before not all of it gets turned to compost of the feedlot manure that we take out but the stuff that we do i'll either put close to the farm and run my windrows there or in the past i have gone on the edge of a field dumped the manure and then just turned it you know four or five times and then it's right there we're able to spread it on the ground so as far as spreading we've done a little bit of both we've had custom guys come in and spread our compost and our manure but the last few years we've bought our own vertical spreader and so we've been able to spread with that and then have another neighbor that brings his over so but we've got a lot of material now so i think we'll probably end up doing something just to get rid of it all we should be able to spread you know probably 500 of those acres i would imagine this year is kind of my goal that's how much we have a lot of material normally i'd only like to put on about five ton but with the material we have it might be closer to 10 maybe 15. i'll i'll end up doing trials with that too just to see the difference but with the compost i'd like to spread a little being that i have enough of the product i would really like to see what more you know a higher amount does to kind of maybe offset some of that fertilizer side of it that's one thing i really want to learn though too is you know can i move forward using a lot less fertilizer because it's hard it's hard to move away as i said before from the npk mindset but i know especially the p and the k i know i can replace that with the compost through through time i live here on five acres in eastern wright county with my family who is now just two of us because all the other all the kids are gone now but we still have four horses we've got the two you can see in the background two big boys and we got two little boys out and back clean stalls every evening before everybody comes in from being out here on the pasture or out in the dry lot manure goes into a wheelbarrow wheelbarrow comes out here and we just dump it here in front of the pile and maybe once a week or so kind of depends on how much manure we've had i'll take the tractor and we'll load it back up under the pile and stir the pile at the same time the reason i i started first of all is i'm concerned about first of all organic matter and second more so infiltration i think we have a real problem with infiltration and how do you remedy that and i still don't have an answer for that the other thing is that we've been losing organic matter in our soil and and we put in most people feel we put all this residue into the ground it's got to go into organic matter but most of it goes up into the air i went to uh acres conference and there was a guy there that he showed the extract and he showed it up on the screen and you see all those critters moving around and it says you know those are live in our soil and i think we need to get them get them back in there again the fertility is here this is one of our business entities of the farm but it was very underutilized and it's just was begging for the opportunity because it's the best fertility we could have for the farm but how are we going to get it out on to the acres when i joined the farm as the agronomist i quickly identified in fall of 2016 that we needed we could do a better job with this fertility and make it kind of the hub of our fertility program but the only way we were going to be able to do that was to get it in a transportable package so to speak and that's where you fall back on the idea of composting diversification is is important utilizing the acres that you have soil health all those buzzwords compost is at the peak of that yeah it's been 15 years since i've started to do this and every year is a new experience but i really enjoy doing it and i enjoy talking about it and i i just think um it's i like to use the term it's the right thing to do and it's also i think it's it's the way things are going i think it's um is we're we're taking that that management that stewardship to the next level and we're taking a waste product that people don't want to look at they think it smells they think it looks bad and we're turning into something that you could give your kids and when they could eat it and it wouldn't harm them that's an amazing thing to me so for me personally i think the combination is is really a really good way to go and i think from a a sector side from an agriculture sector sector side we're gonna have to start moving away from the synthetic fertilizers from relying on that and and if we're about building our soil health it's putting that organic matter back on the soil every spring i spread it out on the pasture give the grass some nutrition and we use it for garden mulch and it reduces the the volume of the manure probably by a third it's a very inexpensive thing to do you do have to have equipment to keep your the compost pile turned over i would hate to have to do this with a shovel that's for sure it would be a better operation here if i had started this on a concrete slab because one of the problems is over the over well we've been here for 25 years and uh the the ground around the manure pile is starting to go down just because it gets caught up in the in the bucket of the tractor once in a while when we turn the pile over the manure pile itself is a composted stays at a fairly high temperature but it'll only do that if you keep it turned over and keep it aerated and give the bacteria some some oxygen to live on good farming you need a mix of of the fungal and bacteria and that's why i've done some more of the of the static that i will introduce the static in with the with the regular compost because most of our compost i can show you those numbers but most of the of the uh of the compost that we build in the row like this it's two gets too hot and the fungal material doesn't survive and i'm hoping that we can once that these piles are probably getting cool enough now that that we can do the the fungal material add that to the compost this is some finished compost and uh here so this is this is what this came from and most people have a hard time visualizing well this is soil i mean but it's compost that that's gone through the process of of with all the microbes and everything else and and and digesting it and this is the final result of that and which is very impressive stuff i use straw i i've used pea straw i've used soy bean straw i've used corn straw and we also try to get wood chips if we possibly can this is the first time we've been using a larger amount of hay because we had some of our alfalfa that was left over from last year we're using that and we have in the mix that we're doing right now it'll be 30 bales of straw on a roll with 15 bales of alfalfa this is last year's alfalfa so this is a really good nitrogen source to add then with your because what kind of straw is this then it's rye straw okay from the seat of the pants it's it's basically what you've got available yes we normally green chop our road ditches as as another forage area so that would be another nitrogen that's right the second type too you put water on your probably a few times before you put the manure on top of it it'll get a nice even and so do you think you'd be able to compost here without water no i think water is important because this stuff is so dry when you start with so we will probably dump like three semi loads of manure into this here which would be 150 000 pounds and is that manure coming out is that a bedded pack that bed pack that back yeah and that'll have some hay and straw also in there too but it should make a pretty hot mixture i would think i usually don't have any problem with temperature you said that pile over there was even up to 120 already well when that got turned with that moisture in there now that'll probably by tonight or tomorrow morning it'll be up to 140 150 degrees and that's where your biology starts working on there and and uh breaking down everything uh in in there so that'll be a good material for the soil when your compost gets down to ambient temperature you can use it or another method is i think if you put it into a zip lock bag and if it doesn't smell ammonia you you're okay to spread it you notice that this is is this ideal place it's it's you've got a slope on it so anybody that you you you can't have it in a in a slew hole i mean you've got to be able to access your or do your turning even though you've had rain so that's this here has got a nice gentle slope and it hit heads off over to the side we've got the analysis of both the regular windrow composting and also the static compost from the same material coming back so if we have twelve thousand acres we hope to apply compost to four thousand every year so every field will see compost hopefully once in every three years some people work under their state regulations others work under an epa permit but with this facility it's easier to work under the state regulations versus an epa permit this particular county you had to get a special use permit and of course the the neighbors concern was oh you're gonna have more flies more smell because now you've brought it out out on one particular site and not land applied it but with the inoculants and the composting process within one or two turns it's not manure anymore it's compost and it's basically odor free and then we'll have two pads where all the wind rose are contained so we can hold 36 windrows that are 14 feet by 160 feet long and they're 160 feet because that's the length of our felt covers that we'll have over the windrows the felt covers are from for moisture management because in the composting process the microbes want to stay at a consistent temperature and moisture and so excess moisture messes up that process and and the windrows getting too dry would also shut that process down so if we have them all covered we control the moisture with the compost turner and the car the water cart that follows uh we control and rain snow whatever doesn't uh interfere with that or like this summer we have a lot of hot windy days you would have to be adding water to your windrows like constantly the longer you have a run the harder it is to get water away from the windrows even on a design pad so we shorten them up to 160s so there'll be a diversion channel kind of right in this area where the first runs water collects and gets diverted to the containment pond so within this site all the water from a rain event excess water goes to the containment pond down there we didn't have a lot of slope to work with here so we have to kind of create this this the necessary slope because most compost sites you have to be able to work in you know all the time and so it can't be a place where water accumulates it has to drain away because excess moisture uh doesn't lend itself well to composting and that's why we discover too that most large-scale composting sites tend to be in more arid areas but over here where you have more moisture you have to create that condition where you can work with your compost on an almost daily basis because the wind rose will demand that this will be our loadout spot that we're standing on here to bring in trucks and we'll haul it to the field we're thinking with a live bottom truck and then we'll meet the composter litter spreader out in the field and that'll have a conveyor so we can just back up with a live bottom so we don't need another payloader we don't want a double handle in the field that we're spreading we want that to be efficient the equipment to compost really in the scope of what farm equipment costs isn't the obstacle because there's a scale of composting equipment for every size operator it comes down to the site and what how extensive a site do you need we probably wouldn't be able to permit this facility had we not taken on this type of manure management system they would have had to redesign something within the barns or how the manures handled because under the new south dakota permitting you can't we can't store minerv for very long outside the barn if at all depending on what your situation is out here with the feed lot when my father-in-law built the feedlot it was kind of nice because he had to to come under the guidelines of the feedlot runoff and so in dealing with the manure we had a best management practice plan and then with the composting it fit really well into that and and we're able to utilize a lot more of that product on on a wider acre basis as you can see out here the beets have been the biggest challenge most of the time you're dealing with either a carbon source or a nitrogen source and what i've found is it almost goes from a carbon to a nitrogen back and forth depending on on the how the beets feel i mean they start off really spongy but then as they dry out they get really hard basically like a carbon source and so finding that happy medium of of what to do with the beets has been has been a i won't say tough because it it really isn't tough it's just it's it's interesting and it's uh i like the interesting side of compost too so what i found with this and and again that's one of the main reasons i bought my turner is you know if a guy could start off with a smaller particle size you would be way better off with my machine after two times it really breaks that stuff down the ingredient part is the main thing i i have found with our manure we use we use straw throughout the year so we tend to have a pretty good mixture based on just the straw that we put in with the manure in the feed lot i don't have to add a lot with the beets like i say the the moisture level can vary so much that it's more of kind of a feel and a look for me so i don't really have a recipe at this point again um you know there's a few things i try to do to to start that process a little quicker but you know over time it you know it starts to heat up even without turning it and then getting that particle size down is is kind of the main thing so talking about mistakes and i made a lot of mistakes is is the carbon side of it i've i've really come to find out and my dad has too that you know the manure is good but but you can have too much of it you know what i mean and if you're going for a good product you don't need a whole lot of manure i consider the manure to be kind of a magic elixir but you can you can get in trouble with with it heating up too much as far as when you apply it especially repeat customers because they think a little is good a lot must be better so i've really tried to go away from just doing straight manure piles out of the feedlot we still do it but if i'm going for a good product i'll basically start with my carbon source and then add the manure here it's almost trying to keep the moisture out of it i deal more with with puddling which creates a challenge even with with the equipment you know sometimes a two-wheel drive tractor is not enough to even pull sometimes which is kind of frustrating but the heavier ground out here poses a challenge but i've been able to get around that now that's where hankinson comes into play i've got some some compost ground down by hankinson north dakota where it's basically blow sand and it can be raining and i can be turning so i love making compost down there and it makes a really good product too well here it was just uh the the closeness to the feedlot um i didn't want to have to haul it very far and we had a spot uh that was close enough that that had a you know a good enough drainage site um that that worked and i and i try to move my piles around so i'm not putting it on the same spot but i also don't want to take up a lot of ground but i've also done where we'll we'll pile manure on the end of a field i'll turn it and then we spread it right away which really works nice and that's a year process the trucking cost is always something that i really take into account because it can get expensive but it's no different than you know if you're having to haul manure i try to take into account that and and with the compost you're hauling a lot less material too the marketing side of it of course i want to get to the point where i can market almost all of it i'd like i'd love to get to the point where i have a really good product i can find growers especially organic guys that that they would really appreciate a good product that they could use um and maybe even some of the conventional guys to see that you know the big thing is soil health right now i don't know of a better way to build your soil than put compost other than maybe cover crops my dad had this this exact machine he bought his brand new about 15 years ago i was able to find this one used and i knew i wanted to find the same machine if i could do that just because i knew it it's simple and to be honest it makes a really good product it's not aggressive but once the material starts to break down it really does a good job of incorporating the material and also incorporating the oxygen and the biggest thing that i found and in most cases you would think that you would want the machine to turn really fast when i start off i do run it fast but as time goes on those those mic you know the microorganisms do more of the work than the machine does and basically what i do with this machine is is i'm basically just fluffing that material and and just trying to you know if it's reaching that temperature that i want to turn it out that's kind of my basis for when i turn but i'm not looking at being aggressive once once it starts to break down and those piles get get small by the by the end of the process so one of the downfalls of this machine is is it doesn't quite fit a dump truck when you're dumping your material so you're constantly in your loader sizing up your windrows and that's the only downfall that i have with this machine so now this machine right here was i think this cost me about fifteen thousand dollars which i felt was a pretty good price um so and they're they're not easy to find but um but if a guy can find one and they're they're beginning there's beginning to be more and with the internet you can find you can find them more and more this machine new with the water is is probably 50 000 i think so yeah this machine has been a big boon to our operation um as you can see i've got all the flails off but i did put a couple a couple on here just to show you can see how how big these knives are compared to the other the other machine now the reason i bought this machine was is i was getting a lot more material and i wanted to get through it quicker than i was getting through with that other machine and i wanted to do i wanted to to start with a smaller particle size was the biggest thing it just really um this thing is really aggressive it doesn't make as good a finished product and i would recommend that's why it's nice i really don't want to have two machines but it's worked out really well that i can i can start off my piles and and get going on them fast and handle a lot of material i can do almost 2 500 tons an hour with this thing and then when the piles start to get smaller i come through and and use that other machine of course it's it's more expensive and they're harder to find and i didn't like the self-contained engine but it was kind of just what worked at the time so every one of those then will have a knife it's got 80 knives on it yup it makes you know going through manure pot heavy manure can cause a lot of issues with that other machine if you if you um if you have a too big of a pile this thing i it will go through anything it's it's unbelievable what's nice about the vertical beater is i i've used compost spreaders in the past and i love them but we still spread manure and you can't spread and i'm not i'm not an all or nothing guy i mean sometimes you just run into problems where you don't have the time and manure is still a great product in my mind so we're able to uh to kind of kill two birds with one stone we spread lime with it too spent lime from the beet factory so for us this was a no-brainer we probably need a couple more but this works really well and the nice thing and what i've looked at doing is i can take these beaters off and build windrows also as a barrier to entry our our feed lot corresponds with the composting equipment just perfectly the only excess piece of equipment i've had to buy ism is a turner i mean everything else i can use in the feedlot the manure spreader this this has worked out really well for adding my carbon source to to my piles um and then you know of course the the spreader and then trucks and loaders you know you have those your you have those already so that that to me was was just was awesome when people ask about you know getting into into composting if you if you have cattle already and are feeding or you know even just a rancher you have the majority of the equipment already which is which is just huge because it's pretty easy to go and spend a lot of money on equipment if that's you know if you're looking to get started without without that already this is basically straight manure with you know we mix um corn stalks and wheat straw yeah and this stuff was screened with a quarter inch screen this is about oh two two-year-old two-year-old material so this would be something i would sell to a gardener the stuff that i would apply would have bigger chunks i mean this stuff as you can see there's chunks here but it breaks apart it's it's friable so um but nothing like it when i start to turn my product i do have the end user in mind of what i i don't want to sell to a local gardener or a local landscape or a product that doesn't look good and so um i've i've come to the conclusion that you know that's my machine to make a good finished product and i also want to try to screen it if possible so i do have access to a screener and that makes a huge difference um and there's a difference to compost most people think compost is just one big thing but you know some of that finished compost i'll turn 15 times if i have to do it the stuff that i put on my fields i'll do a minimum of four normally it ends up being about six seven times it's more of an art than a science is at the end of the day you have different conditions it might rain and then you've got to decide you know you might have a smell that doesn't quite smell right i got to go add some carbon to it so it does take take some time especially if you're trying to make that high quality product figure out what you're trying to do we made the mistake of buying one for a skid steer right away and it was a complete waste of time it made a good product so someone on a small scale i would say that's a great way to start we were dealing with my dad's business in probably three to four thousand tons a year and i would say even a loader is too is too small and it's too slow to to do a good job i would recommend right away someone getting a machine whether it's by yourself or with a neighbor you know you're not turning all year so it's it's probably a machine that that you can trade with you know trade time and and labor with but i would recommend getting a machine now size wise this is a good way to start but like i said if if you're wanting to to be the most efficient a wider machine would probably be the best way to go the other mistake i think a lot of guys starting out might make is is thinking they can can get away with just a normal transmission tractor um you basically have to have a creeper an ivt or a hydro to do a good job because you're when you're starting off with a big windrow no matter whether it's this machine or the other machine i'll show you you're wanting to go probably less than half a mile an hour and even slower because you're moving a lot of material and once you start breaking that material down it does get easier but you you'd be riding the clutch a lot on a tractor so if i were to start and budget was the biggest thing a vertica or a horizontal beater manure spreader would be able to do would would be able to do a pretty good job especially on a small scale because it starts that process it starts to heat it up and then if you have a loader you can come and turn it later and and you've got a a decent product especially if you're just putting on farm ground i'm never concerned about what other people think in in if i was i wouldn't be doing what i'm doing uh and i you don't always win you probably lose more than you win but i i'm always up for a challenge and this is probably a real real challenge the thing is you've got to be committed and if you're not committed don't even start because it can be trying you know a lot of people say well compost isn't worth it or whatever but i i still think it's got a lot of benefits you know to composting so you just don't think that this can have but this is mother nature working at its finest",
