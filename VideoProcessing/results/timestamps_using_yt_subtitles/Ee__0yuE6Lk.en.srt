00:00:13,210 --> 00:00:16,360
the installation we're recording today

7
00:00:15,250 --> 00:00:19,000
is happening in Texas

8
00:00:16,360 --> 00:00:21,279
here we use schedule 40 PVC pipe for the

9
00:00:19,000 --> 00:00:22,720
main lines in class 200 after the valves

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:24,490
your area may require different

11
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:26,200
materials so check with your local

12
00:00:24,490 --> 00:00:30,060
authorities to make sure you're using

13
00:00:26,200 --> 00:00:33,010
the recommended materials for your area

14
00:00:30,060 --> 00:00:35,320
the Pikes you see here mark the location

15
00:00:33,010 --> 00:00:37,210
for sprinkler heads and valves use

16
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:41,230
marking spray to lay out where you want

17
00:00:37,210 --> 00:00:42,970
your inches here you can see our

18
00:00:41,230 --> 00:00:45,489
installer marking the location of a

19
00:00:42,970 --> 00:00:47,500
valve box use the different color than

20
00:00:45,489 --> 00:00:48,160
the ones marking your utilities to avoid

21
00:00:47,500 --> 00:00:50,829
confusion

22
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,899
speaking of which remember to call 8 1 1

23
00:00:50,829 --> 00:00:55,000
before you do they'll send someone out

24
00:00:52,899 --> 00:00:57,130
to mark the property with flags or paint

25
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:59,680
to indicate where utility lines are

26
00:00:57,130 --> 00:01:02,829
buried this is always your first step in

27
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,300
a turning project you're going to need a

28
00:01:02,829 --> 00:01:06,700
variety of tools for this project

29
00:01:04,300 --> 00:01:08,890
including shovels trowels rakes and PVC

30
00:01:06,700 --> 00:01:11,050
pipe cutters you might want to check out

00:01:08,890 --> 00:01:14,800
our video titled necessary sprinkler

32
00:01:11,050 --> 00:01:16,780
installation tools for this installation

33
00:01:14,800 --> 00:01:18,880
we're digging trenches 6 to 8 inches

34
00:01:16,780 --> 00:01:21,659
deep the area where we are installing

35
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:24,159
this system is not prone to hard freezes

36
00:01:21,659 --> 00:01:26,020
areas that are prone to hard freezes may

37
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,000
need deeper trenches to protect piping

38
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,549
you should contact your local authority

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,380
for recommendations notice how clean

40
00:01:30,549 --> 00:01:34,750
this crew member is taking out sections

41
00:01:32,380 --> 00:01:36,549
of side this team always puts the sod on

42
00:01:34,750 --> 00:01:38,439
one side of the trench and the Philbert

43
00:01:36,549 --> 00:01:43,960
on the opposite side this will pay off

44
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:45,610
big one backfilling notice how flat and

45
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,159
even the bottom of these trenches are

46
00:01:45,610 --> 00:01:50,939
that's ideal strive to get your trenches

47
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:50,939
flat like this

48
00:01:51,189 --> 00:01:55,729
one of the crew is pre assembling the

49
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:57,890
swing joints to the tease and sprinkler

50
00:01:55,729 --> 00:01:59,659
heads this is so much easier and quicker

51
00:01:57,890 --> 00:02:01,310
than trying to assemble this in the

52
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:11,120
trench while on your knees hunched over

53
00:02:01,310 --> 00:02:13,220
it saves both time and your back routes

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,140
can be a serious challenge if you're

55
00:02:13,220 --> 00:02:17,120
lucky you can tunnel under some of them

56
00:02:15,140 --> 00:02:19,670
however you may need to put some muscle

57
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:21,319
into it swinging an axe will pull off

58
00:02:19,670 --> 00:02:22,100
the heavy artillery and go at it with a

59
00:02:21,319 --> 00:02:23,959
chainsaw

60
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:27,550
please take safety precautions when

61
00:02:23,959 --> 00:02:27,550
using an axe or chainsaw

62
00:02:28,240 --> 00:02:34,740
[Music]

63
00:02:35,159 --> 00:02:39,370
when digging in a flowerbed the trick is

64
00:02:37,900 --> 00:02:41,909
to do this little disruption to

65
00:02:39,370 --> 00:02:44,079
establish plants and shrubs as possible

66
00:02:41,909 --> 00:02:45,760
trenches should be planned in such a way

67
00:02:44,079 --> 00:02:54,040
as to minimize the amount of digging

68
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:56,440
necessary right here's where our 12 inch

69
00:02:54,040 --> 00:02:58,629
pop-up will go this crewman is using a

70
00:02:56,440 --> 00:03:00,700
sharpshooter to dig down about a foot to

71
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,590
accommodate the height of the head the

72
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:05,560
top of the head should be level with the

73
00:03:02,590 --> 00:03:07,000
ground our technician is cutting links

74
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,250
of pipe that will be heading out to the

75
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:11,200
valves and sprinkler heads it's optimal

76
00:03:09,250 --> 00:03:13,359
to have several pipes utilizing the same

77
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,970
trench and it's perfectly fine to have

78
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:18,430
pipes laying on top of each other he's

79
00:03:15,970 --> 00:03:20,290
using extra bits of PVC to keep the pipe

80
00:03:18,430 --> 00:03:24,819
out of the dirt while he applies primer

81
00:03:20,290 --> 00:03:26,349
and cement quickly push the fittings on

82
00:03:24,819 --> 00:03:28,450
to the pipe after applying the cement

83
00:03:26,349 --> 00:03:31,060
hold in place a few seconds wipe away

84
00:03:28,450 --> 00:03:33,069
the excess remember cement as a solvent

85
00:03:31,060 --> 00:03:34,750
wiping away excess prevents it from

86
00:03:33,069 --> 00:03:38,139
continuing to weaken the exposed

87
00:03:34,750 --> 00:03:40,120
portions of the pipe PVC pipe often

88
00:03:38,139 --> 00:03:41,709
comes with flared ends this allows you

89
00:03:40,120 --> 00:03:44,139
to connect pipe without having to add a

90
00:03:41,709 --> 00:03:46,060
coupler you could use cut off nipple

91
00:03:44,139 --> 00:03:47,859
risers to save some money but you'd

92
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:49,989
still want to use swing joints near the

93
00:03:47,859 --> 00:03:51,940
driveway and street so that if a vehicle

94
00:03:49,989 --> 00:03:54,150
drives over the sprinkler head you don't

95
00:03:51,940 --> 00:03:56,530
end up with a brake

96
00:03:54,150 --> 00:03:58,599
additionally swing joints make it much

97
00:03:56,530 --> 00:04:00,639
easier to place a sprinkler exactly

98
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:02,410
where you want it and it makes it simple

99
00:04:00,639 --> 00:04:03,989
to adjust the height of the head should

100
00:04:02,410 --> 00:04:06,250
the soil eventually cover the head

101
00:04:03,989 --> 00:04:08,410
carefully fill soil in around the

102
00:04:06,250 --> 00:04:09,940
sprinkler head remember to pack some

103
00:04:08,410 --> 00:04:12,220
soil underneath the head to prevent it

104
00:04:09,940 --> 00:04:13,449
from sinking down do remember that

105
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,400
you'll need to run wiring before

106
00:04:13,449 --> 00:04:17,349
covering up any trenches that go from

107
00:04:15,400 --> 00:04:19,599
your valves back to your controller

108
00:04:17,349 --> 00:04:21,250
wires should be tucked into the piping

109
00:04:19,599 --> 00:04:24,210
to provide protection for lawn equipment

110
00:04:21,250 --> 00:04:24,210
and animals

00:05:43,570 --> 00:05:47,450
be careful when backfilling not to hit

116
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:50,889
your pipe with the edge of a shovel or

117
00:05:47,450 --> 00:05:50,889
you'll likely be repairing leaks

118
00:06:01,650 --> 00:06:06,479
and now we're replacing those sections

119
00:06:03,810 --> 00:06:08,190
of side care taken while digging the

120
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:10,580
trenches and backfilling allows your

121
00:06:08,190 --> 00:06:13,470
yard to recover and look great quickly

122
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:15,830

often arrive with a flush cap in place

129
00:06:40,890 --> 00:06:44,790
it allows the dirt and debris to wash

130
00:06:43,170 --> 00:06:53,610
out of the system while also quickly

131
00:06:44,790 --> 00:06:56,040
testing your new system our team is

132
00:06:53,610 --> 00:06:58,620
installing nozzles for this installation

133
00:06:56,040 --> 00:07:01,830
we're using Rain Bird our bands and H

134
00:06:58,620 --> 00:07:03,900
evens the H II bands are high efficiency

135
00:07:01,830 --> 00:07:07,350
spray nozzles their patterns can be

136
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:09,780
adjusted from 0 to 360 degrees they also

137
00:07:07,350 --> 00:07:10,919
emit large droplets making them about 40

138
00:07:09,780 --> 00:07:14,460
percent more efficient than standard

139
00:07:10,919 --> 00:07:16,560
sprays our bands are rotary heads that

140
00:07:14,460 --> 00:07:17,750
shoot out fingers of water rotary

141
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:18,870
nozzles like this are incredibly

142
00:07:17,750 --> 00:07:21,000
efficient

143
00:07:18,870 --> 00:07:22,530
they met large water droplets which

144
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:25,050
prevents Wynn from carrying the weight

145
00:07:22,530 --> 00:07:26,940
of water this means about 30 percent

146
00:07:25,050 --> 00:07:29,610
more water reaches the plant roots

147
00:07:26,940 --> 00:07:34,320
compared to normal rotors the our vans

148
00:07:29,610 --> 00:07:37,590
are numbered 14 18 and 24 that number is

149
00:07:34,320 --> 00:07:39,540
the maximum throw distance and feet to

150
00:07:37,590 --> 00:07:41,850
install a nozzle pull up the head by the

151
00:07:39,540 --> 00:07:44,820
flush cap while holding the riser in the

152
00:07:41,850 --> 00:07:47,910
up position unscrew the flush cap put in

153
00:07:44,820 --> 00:07:49,710
the filter and screw on the nozzle then

154
00:07:47,910 --> 00:07:51,860
adjust the direction of the spray head

155
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,970
by turning the pop-up riser that

156
00:07:51,860 --> 00:07:55,830
ratcheting sound is not hurting the

157
00:07:53,970 --> 00:07:58,169
pop-up head they're meant to be turned

158
00:07:55,830 --> 00:08:00,150
like this here you'll see two sprinkler

159
00:07:58,169 --> 00:08:00,930
heads installed close together that

160
00:08:00,150 --> 00:08:03,300
wasn't a mistake

161
00:08:00,930 --> 00:08:05,640
one of these heads is for the flowerbeds

162
00:08:03,300 --> 00:08:07,650
only and the other is for the lawn this

163
00:08:05,640 --> 00:08:10,440
allows separate watering schedules for

164
00:08:07,650 --> 00:08:12,390
the beds and for the lawn the 12-inch

165
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,220
pop-up allows the spray to shoot over

166
00:08:12,390 --> 00:08:18,419
the plantings in the bed while the lawns

167
00:08:14,220 --> 00:08:19,919
typically only need a 4-inch papa now

168
00:08:18,419 --> 00:08:22,320
our team is adjusting each of the

169
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,000
nozzles for distance and pattern for

170
00:08:22,320 --> 00:08:26,220
distance you want head-to-head coverage

171
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:28,110
that means throw the sprinkler should

172
00:08:26,220 --> 00:08:31,260
reach the next sprinkler head this

173
00:08:28,110 --> 00:08:33,030
