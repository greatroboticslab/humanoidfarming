  "text": "today my team PR shaki will be presenting a problem statement ID 1554 which is about smart irrigation system for precision farming nowadays water scarcity is a major challenge in agriculture leading to insufficient water usage and reduced drop traditional irrigation method often result in overuse or underuse of water however we have developed an smart irrigation system that utilizes iot and Technologies to monitor soil moisture nutritional level and weather condition this system will provide a realtime data for Farmers enabling them to make informed decision on irrigation scheduling th optimizing water usage and maximize crop yeld we have come with a robotic car fixed with different sensors to provide such as for soil testing soil moisture soil temperature then NSP for motion we will be using IR sensors for paste I thermal camera for air humidity and temperature dd22 for checking nutritional level of soil NPK sensors and for detecting rain rain sensors all sensors are controlled by ESP 826 which drives the car according to the data described by the farmer the data collected to an I blink platform which is analyzed precisely by using aimf these datas are shown to the former using user interface which shows temperature water level humidity GPRS nutrition and insects according to these analysis the motor that is connected to our fertilizer pump is opened and closed by one click of the farmer here we have also use GPRS sensor to detect the location of the car the robotic car consists of omni wheel which is free to move in any direction without any D here we have also prepared a video for this problem thank you",
