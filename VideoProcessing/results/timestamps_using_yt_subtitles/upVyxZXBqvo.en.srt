1
00:00:00,799 --> 00:00:05,200
new tractor owners listen up i made a

2
00:00:02,960 --> 00:00:06,799
recent video about all the hidden costs

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:08,880
for tractor owners and it's true there

4
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:10,719
are a lot of hidden costs however

5
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,000
for the very basics just the bare

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,519
essentials that you need

7
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,360
that list is pretty short you don't have

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,880
to spend thousands of extra dollars

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:18,560
just to get started so when someone

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:20,400
starts chatting me up about what they

11
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:22,080
need for their new tractor what they

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,199
gotta get along with it to be kind of

13
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,519
set up right

14
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:27,519
well most of those answers are gonna be

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:29,039
custom tailored to fit their application

16
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,640
however there are a handful of things

17
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:32,559
required for every tractor owner

18
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,320
regardless of your task let's play a fun

19
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,840
game really quick in this one too

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,360
something is going to change in the

21
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,079
background of this video between the

22
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,840
beginning

23
00:00:38,079 --> 00:00:41,680
and the end of it if you figure out what

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,600
it is leave a comment down below

25
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:45,120

you seasoned vets out there

27
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:48,160
if you have something else you think

28
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:49,600
every tractor owner should have

29
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,280

30
00:00:49,600 --> 00:00:52,480

38

underneath the video or head on over to

39
00:01:03,479 --> 00:01:06,479
goodworkstractors.com

40
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:14,960
so it's no secret i sell used equipment

41
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,600
so i am pretty particular about what i

42
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:16,960
bring in

43
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:18,799
not only in the condition of the

44
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,240
equipment but what features are found on

45
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:21,520
the tractors that i have for sale

46
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:23,280
for that reason it's going to be very

47
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,880
rare to see something out here that

48
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,240
doesn't have a quick attached bucket a

49
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:28,240
quick attached loader

50
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,680
you know a quick attach mower a quick

51
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:32,159
attach backhoe

52
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,320
a three-point quick attach the common

53
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:36,159
theme there is quick attach i want that

54
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,320
versatility for my customers

55
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:40,159
i think that paying a little bit more to

56
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:42,079
have equipment that has that kind of a

57
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,000
feature on there to allow you to make

58
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:45,759
um or to hook up different attachments

59
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,119
to the loader or take the loader off

60
00:01:45,759 --> 00:01:49,280
quickly if you just want to mow

61
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:50,799
or take the backhoe off or hook up to

62
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,280
different three-point attachments a lot

63
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,799
easier

64
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,840
those kinds of features are worth their

65
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:55,840
weight in gold

66
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,360
so quick attach is really pretty

67
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,960
self-explanatory right but

68
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,520
the main benefits are going to be

69
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:05,119
efficiency and versatility so efficiency

70
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:06,079
because it's going to be very fast of

71
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:07,520
course to change

72
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:09,679
attachments out like take your bucket

73
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,039
off put pallet forks on or a snow pusher

74
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:12,879
or if you want to take your whole loader

75
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,120
off or your mower deck your backhoe

76
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:16,640
versatility again because you can take

77
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,400
your bucket off then you can put those

78
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,040
forks on you can put the snow pusher on

79
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:20,640
a grapple

80
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:22,560
instead of being just stuck with your

81
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,239
bucket and no quick way to go back and

82
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:24,959
forth between forks and a pusher or

83
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:26,640
anything else

84
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,000
and of course it's going to allow you to

85
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:29,599
do things the right way

86
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,959
if you're mowing your lawn you really

87
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,879
shouldn't have your load around and your

88
00:02:30,959 --> 00:02:33,840
bucket on so if you can quickly take

89
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:35,360
this off

90
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:37,760
it's going to keep a lot of stress and

91
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
strain off of the front axle the tractor

92
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:41,120
it's going to allow you to maneuver in

93
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:42,400
tighter corners and the same thing if

94
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:43,840
you're trying to use your front end

95
00:02:42,400 --> 00:02:45,120
loader or your three point

96
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:46,800
you want to be able to take your mower

97
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:48,480
deck off because this is an easy thing

98
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,120
to damage if you're driving along say

99
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:50,879
you're tilling

100
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,160
and or you're in your woods just driving

101
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:53,760
around and you hit a stump

102
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,280
and it whacks the mower deck and knocks

103
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,040
it out of alignment you could have some

104
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:57,599
costly repairs that way as well or

105
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,920
shorten

106
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:01,120
uh the lifespan of the axle for example

107
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:03,040
in other scenarios

108
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:04,239
so the easier it is to take on and off

109
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:06,319
the better off you are

110
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:08,400
this next essential for tractor owners

111
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,480
is free for everybody but it's something

112
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:11,200
that we all need and rely on we're using

113
00:03:10,480 --> 00:03:13,040
it right now

114
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:14,720
and that's going to be support and it's

115
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,200
a great thing at this day and age as you

116
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:19,360
have so many versions and forms and ways

117
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
to get knowledge about your tractor

118
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:22,640
and that learning curve is really going

119
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:22,879
to get shortened the more that you kind

120
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:24,640
of

121
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,560
dive into it and understand what's going

122
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,480
on with your tractor how to use it

00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:29,680
watching it in action you can do that in

124
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,200
a lot of different ways

125
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:32,720
youtube of course is a really good

126
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,560
platform

127
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,560
not my channel there's a lot of great

128
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:37,120
channels out there that show tractors in

129
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,879
action

130
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
all sorts of different setups different

131
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:41,519
configurations you can see what works

132
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,200
and what doesn't work

133
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,360
the right size equipment to fit your

134
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:47,280

136
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:50,080
there with

137
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:51,360
guys that are doing different custom

138
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,799
things to their tractors if you want to

139
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,680

140
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:55,280

customize your tractor to fit your needs

143
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,879
along the lines of youtube and the

144
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:03,280
facebook groups

145
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,120

146
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:06,720

00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,560
with a lot of experience those just

148
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:10,879
starting out and everywhere in between

149
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:12,400
to just get together ask and answer

00:04:10,879 --> 00:04:13,360
those questions and it's not only going

151
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,599
to take care of

152
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,440
the situation at hand for that that

153
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,799
customer that user right at that point

154
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,560

everybody else in the future to read and

156
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:24,160
digest and understand and hopefully

157
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:26,320
shorten their learning curve as well in

158
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,000
fact i think tractor forms are so

159
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,440
beneficial that on my new

160
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,240
website that's coming out soon you'll

161
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:32,560
want to stick around for that

162
00:04:31,240 --> 00:04:34,800
goodworxtractors.com

163
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,160
i paid thousands of dollars extra to

164
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,639
have a forum

165
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:39,440
application built into that website that

166
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,040
way

167
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,720
i can direct folks right there we can

168
00:04:41,040 --> 00:04:43,199
have a great community just to get those

169
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,520
questions

170
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:47,280
answered right there on the spot another

171
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:47,759
couple great ways to get support are

172
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:49,919
going to be

173
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:51,840
through your dealers so that's why i say

174
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,960
one of the big decisions in figuring out

175
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,320
the right tractor for you

176
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:57,759
john deere kubota coyote whoever is

177
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,160
checking out your local dealer do you

178
00:04:57,759 --> 00:05:01,919
have good support there you know there's

179
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:03,199
good dealers and bad dealers most of

180
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,600
them are good out there right

181
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:06,960
but go ahead talk to those guys even if

182
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,240
you don't buy a tractor from them

183
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,520
a good dealer is still going to take

184
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:11,199
care of you if you need to get your

185
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,400
tractor service there or buy some parts

186
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:13,520
or accessories from them

187
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:15,360
that can make a difference between

188
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,080
getting a john deere a kubota or any

189
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,520
other brand

190
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,680
of course you can always reference your

191
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:20,160
user manual if you don't have a hard

192
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:21,680
copy

193
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,840
at least with john deere if you just

194
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:28,160
google john deere 10 25

195
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,440
hour manual or john deere 300 cx manual

196
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,919
you're gonna find

197
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:33,440
this same thing just in the online

198
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,360
version okay so it's the exact same

199
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:36,960
thing easy to reference but

200
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:38,880
even after all these years i've made

201
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:39,919
videos on the hidden things that i find

202
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:42,000
in these manuals that

203
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:43,440
maybe you just gloss over the first 10

204
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,680
times you read through it

205
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,120
but you kind of pick up on it eventually

206
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:48,320
so there's a lot of good stuff in here

207
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:49,680
i'd encourage you to read it

208
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,360
if you don't have a hard copy just get

209
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:52,000
it online something else that's not

210
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:53,440
going to cost you

211
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,800
a whole lot but could come in really

212
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,400
handy especially if you're in the middle

213
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:58,639
of a project

214
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:59,840
and all of a sudden need it something

215
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,080
like fasteners

216
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:03,840
linchpins cotter pins and i'll tell you

217
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,319
if you use a tiller if you use a brush

218
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:06,639
hog

219
00:06:04,319 --> 00:06:08,160
snowblower anything along those lines

220
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:09,280
shear bolts are your best friend that's

221
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,400
not one of those things you want to

222
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,919
search around for

223
00:06:10,400 --> 00:06:13,919
when you're out in the field and all of

224
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:15,600
a sudden one of these shears off

225
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:17,680
have some replacements on hand they're

226
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:19,360
super cheap just keep them with you you

227
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,240
may never need them if you get lucky but

228
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:21,280
if you do

229
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:23,600
you're going to be thankful you have

230
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,039
them with you even items like pins

231
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,120
for your three point attachments to your

232
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,560
quick hitch you know in fact last fall i

233
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,720
was doing some tilling and i

234
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:32,479
forgot i had adjusted my hook up and

235
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,400
down forgot to tighten down

236
00:06:32,479 --> 00:06:35,919
one of my bolts and it actually came off

237
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:38,560
in the field so if you can

238
00:06:35,919 --> 00:06:39,680
keep extra hardware around with you i

239
00:06:38,560 --> 00:06:41,440
didn't

240
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
but if you do it'll save you a lot of

241
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
time so learn from my mistakes

242
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,440
and shorten your learning curve you know

243
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,039
when out here at least straps and chains

244
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,400
really come in handy with trying to move

245
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:51,280
things around but if you're out in the

246
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:52,800
woods as well

247
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,319
say you have a log somewhere that you

248
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:55,599
just can't push you got to kind of pull

249
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,759
it out of the way

250
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,039
great way to just strap to it and yank

251
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:00,639
it out of the way this way

252
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:01,840
so keeping something handy like this

253
00:07:00,639 --> 00:07:02,639
will really help you out when you're in

254
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:04,240
a pinch

255
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:06,160
simple maintenance items will go a long

256
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,319
way to making your tractor last longer

257
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,080
and making a lot easier for you to use

258
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:11,680
if you can keep things on hand like a

259
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,840
rust release spray

260
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,280
some grease options as well they're

261
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,199
going to help you with attaching and

262
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:17,840
detaching to your different attachments

263
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:18,960
that you have

264
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:20,960
they're also going to make it so that

265
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
your loader your mower deck your backhoe

266
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:24,560
other things with grease zerks on there

267
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,479
your drive shafts are going to last a

268
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,360
lot longer it's very easy to do very

269
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:28,800
simple to do

270
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:30,319
you should have these kinds of products

271
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,000
on hand these are nothing you need to

272
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,080
take to a dealer to have done

273
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,440
even a couple simple tools like a hammer

274
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,479
and a set of channel locks will help you

275
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,520
when you're out in the field if you've

276
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,520
got to get

277
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:40,960
an attachment off or maybe an attachment

278
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:42,880
on it's just being stubborn

279
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:44,240
these hunks of steel will help you move

280
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:45,759
those other hunks of steel

281
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:48,000
now i don't care if you have a loader on

282
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,919
your tractor if you don't have a loader

283
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:51,039
if you have something on the back or not

284
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:52,879
everybody needs

285
00:07:51,039 --> 00:07:54,720
ballast weight and stability okay

286
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
because you are not just using the

287
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:58,080
tractor you're going to have something

288
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,599
connected to it so whether it's a mower

289
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:00,879
and maybe you're just mowing around on a

290
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,240
side hill and you have to have some

291
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,039
weight to help keep you planted to the

292
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,319
ground

293
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:05,360
if you're using a front end loader

294
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:06,319
you've got to have some weight on the

295
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,240
back

296
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:10,160
different scenarios call for different

297
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:11,520
types of ballast weight and stability

298
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,280
so everybody's going to have a little

299
00:08:11,520 --> 00:08:14,560
bit of a different requirement of that

300
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,120
kind of ballast weight or

301
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,360
spacers or dual wheels but i'll tell you

302
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:21,440
we all need stability on our tractors to

303
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:22,960
get our projects done safely

304
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:24,240
so talking about reading your owner's

305
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:25,360
manual this is where that's going to

306
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
come in handy because

307
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,080
if you're going to use your front end

308
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:29,599
loader it's going to tell you how much

309
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:30,560
weight you need to have on the back side

310
00:08:29,599 --> 00:08:32,080
to offset that

311
00:08:30,560 --> 00:08:33,519
you can accomplish that in a variety of

312
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:34,560
ways with suitcase weights with a

313
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,479
ballast box

314
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,080
with wheel weights with liquid ballast

315
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:38,560
inside your tires a lot of ways to go

316
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,560
about it

317
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:41,839
the point being you got to get it done

318
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:42,880
weight on the front of your tractor can

319
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:44,240
be useful in a couple different

320
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:45,680
scenarios sometimes

321
00:08:44,240 --> 00:08:47,440
if you don't have your loader on and you

322
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:49,120
have maybe a heavy tiller or some other

323
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,720
piece of equipment on the back end

324
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,399
you want to have some more weight up

325
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,279
here to help keep you planted to the

326
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:55,040
ground

327
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:56,399
your loader is a good form of ballast

328
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,360
weight but it's not ideal for every

329
00:08:56,399 --> 00:08:58,880
situation

330
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:00,399
and sometimes even this additional

331
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,680
weight up front will help keep your

332
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:03,519
front end planted to the ground when

333
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,000
you're using something on the front so

334
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,000
a snow pusher or a snow plow for example

335
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:09,519
sometimes will um

336
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,880
almost make it like you want your front

337
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:12,880
wheels to come off the ground a little

338
00:09:10,880 --> 00:09:14,560
bit so if you can add an extra 200

339
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:16,480
pounds in this scenario here

340
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:17,760
well that's like one of me just standing

341
00:09:16,480 --> 00:09:18,880
on the front of the tractor help keeping

342
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:20,720
it planted to the ground

343
00:09:18,880 --> 00:09:22,640
while i'm pushing or plowing that snow a

344
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:24,240
lot of us are dealing with hills

345
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:26,080
okay there's no way around it you just

346
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:27,040
have hilly property you still have work

347
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:28,640
to get done

348
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:30,800
that's where a setup like these dual

349
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:32,720
wheels can come in handy or maybe

350
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
wheel spacers to get a little bit wider

351
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,320
footprint here

352
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,080
these tractors are not very stable side

353
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,279
to side you could find yourself in some

354
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,279
dangerous situations

355
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,959
you need to find a way to make it safe

356
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:44,240
to do that work and so whether it's

357
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:46,160
through the dual wheels the wheel

358
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,560
spacers maybe a combination of one of

359
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:50,160
those items along with wheel weights

360
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:51,680
liquid ballast to really lower your

361
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,680
center of gravity it's going to make a

362
00:09:51,680 --> 00:09:55,200
big difference to operating safely and

363
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:57,040
efficiently on your tractor

364
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,800
so while the form of ballast or

365
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,440
stability could change depending on the

366
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
user

367
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:03,040
the one thing i can tell you is we all

368
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,959
need some version of it

369
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:07,040
so that's it guys the bare essentials

370
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:09,680
what every tractor owner needs to know

371
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:10,880
needs to have that's just my opinion if

372
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,560
you have something else you think

373
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:13,360
belongs on this list leave a comment
