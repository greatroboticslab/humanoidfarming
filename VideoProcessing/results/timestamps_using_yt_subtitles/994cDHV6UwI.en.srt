00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,080
good day to you

2
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:09,280
and welcome to this webinar that is part

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:12,160
of the idf webinars on managing calves

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,320
from birth to weaning in different parts

5
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,039
of the world

6
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,800
my name is giulio django

7
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,560
i am a senior scientist at the

8
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,800
international livestock research

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,720
institute based in nairobi kenya

10
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,160
in the work i do

11
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,719
we seek to identify appropriate breeds

12
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:35,760
and breed combinations for livestock

13
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:37,520
production systems in middle and low

14
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:41,120
income countries

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:44,320
in order to improve animal productivity

16
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:47,520
and improve incomes for the millions of

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:50,879
people who depend on livestock

18
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:50,879
for their livelihoods

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:54,719
in this webinar

20
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
prepared in combination with other

21
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,800
members of the livestock genetics team

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,440
at ilray

23
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,360
i will share information on smallholder

24
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:08,000
farming systems in eastern africa

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,600
the title of our presentation is

26
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,560
raising carbs

27
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:16,159
a strategic investment for small holder

28
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:18,560
farmers in east africa

29
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,280
why is this strategic

30
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:25,520
the continent of africa is estimated to

31
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,720
have 1.3 billion people

32
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,680
about one-fifth of this population lives

33
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:35,439
on less than two dollars per day

34
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:38,320
yet africa hosts more than 20 percent of

35
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:41,439
the world's cattle

36
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,880
in spite of the huge cattle population

37
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:49,040
africa produces less than six percent of

38
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:49,040
the global milk from cattle

39
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:56,960
eighty percent of the milk produced in

40
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,960
africa is by small holder farmers

41
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:04,719
it is interesting to note that 43

42
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:08,360
of the agricultural workforce in africa

43
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,360
is female

44
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:14,560
there is a huge gap in productivity by

45
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:17,200
dairy animals depending on the farming

46
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:19,840
system in which they are raised as is

47
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:23,239
illustrated in the chart for the east

48
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,239
africa region

49
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,480
you note dairy cattle

50
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:31,280
raised by the majority of smallholder

51
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:35,599
farmers produce less than 2 000

52
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:38,480
kilograms of milk in an annual lactation

53
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:40,879
yet within the same environment

54
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,080
large-scale producers are able to

55
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:46,239
produce

56
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:50,640
up to 6500 kilograms per lactation from

57
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:53,680
the same type of animals

58
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,800
what is the nature of dairy production

59
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,080
in the small holder farms

60
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,080
typically

61
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:05,840
small holder farms

62
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:08,720
are 0.5 to 5 acres in size

63
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:11,280
the farmers engage in both crop and

64
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:15,760
livestock enterprises

65
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:18,879
they generally own 2 to 5 dairy cattle

66
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:20,480
one or two of the animals will usually

67
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,599
be in milk

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:27,120
while the rest of the herd is comprised

69
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,799
of animals of mixed age and sex

70
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:31,040
categories

71
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,080
the cattle are raised under different

72
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:38,159
management conditions depending on their

73
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:40,400
age and physiological status

74
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:42,959
mature milking animals

75
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,879
are often kept in barns

76
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:47,760
or stalls

77
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,200
while younger animals are left to graze

78
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:52,879
in the fields

79
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:56,480
on residues from crops

80
00:03:52,879 --> 00:04:00,159
or by the roadsides

81
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:03,920
animals put to graze by the roadside

82
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,120
are tethered to a fixed pole or tree

83
00:04:03,920 --> 00:04:10,400
using a length of rope to ensure that

84
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:10,400
they do not stray

85
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:16,160
the animals in stalls

86
00:04:13,200 --> 00:04:19,600
have limited space for movement

87
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:22,320
and are provided with feed and water by

88
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:22,320
the farmer

89
00:04:22,639 --> 00:04:28,960
these systems

90
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,840
are referred to as the cut and carry

91
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,120
or

92
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:36,240
zero grazing production systems

93
00:04:33,120 --> 00:04:39,600
the animals reared for dairy production

94
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,880
have a high proportion of exotic

95
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:43,280
genotype

96
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:44,560
that is the host and frisian

97
00:04:43,280 --> 00:04:48,880
archive

98
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:50,160
jersey or brown swiss blood types

99
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,120
however

100
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:56,800
the milk productivity tends to be much

101
00:04:53,120 --> 00:05:00,800
lower than that of the same breeds in

102
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,800
some of the more developed countries

103
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:07,840
though the milk production per animal

104
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:11,600
is less than 12 liters per day from two

105
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:15,120
milkings in the smallholder systems

106
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:18,160
the dairy cows are a critical source of

107
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:19,840
daily income for the farmers

108
00:05:18,160 --> 00:05:22,240
the newborn calf

109
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,560
is generally left with its mother for

110
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:27,280
the first week of its life

111
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:30,080
that is three to seven days

112
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:33,759
in a field or enclosure that is well

113
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:35,520
sheltered from strong winds

114
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,320
during this time

115
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:40,479
the calf is allowed to suckle at any

116
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,919
time

117
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:45,520
at the same time the cow is hand milked

118
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:48,320
twice a day

119
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,639
in the morning and in the evening in

120
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:53,639
order to enhance milk let down

121
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:59,199
cows in small holder systems are milked

122
00:05:57,919 --> 00:06:01,680
by hand

123
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:03,919
as most farmers do not have milking

124
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:07,039
machines

125
00:06:03,919 --> 00:06:10,160
the milk extracted by the milka

126
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:13,280
is given to the calf using a bucket from

127
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:16,240
the third day of its life

128
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,600
as the calf is taught to feed from a

129
00:06:16,240 --> 00:06:21,199
bucket in addition to suckling from its

130
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:22,560
mother

131
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:25,360
in this way

132
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:28,639
the colostrum from the cow is all

133
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,639
provided for the calf

134
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:32,880
after the first week

135
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:36,400
milk produced

136
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:38,240
is used both by the calf and the farm

137
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,680
household

138
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:43,120
excess milk is sold to generate an

139
00:06:41,680 --> 00:06:46,080
income

140
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,639
at the end of the first week

141
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:49,759
the calf is also separated from its

142
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:53,120
mother

143
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:56,000
and is housed in a shed that protects it

144
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:59,039
from extreme cold or heat

145
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:03,440
while the mother is left to graze or

146
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:06,240
feed in a nearby stall or paddock

147
00:07:03,440 --> 00:07:09,120
in the first month following carving

148
00:07:06,240 --> 00:07:11,520
farmers pay critical attention to their

149
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:11,520
calves

150
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,160
they ensure the carbs are provided with

151
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:22,000
sufficient milk

152
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:26,080
and take time to bond with the calf so

153
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:28,800
that it is used to human contact

154
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,720
as cows are hand milked

155
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,440
in some instances

156
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:36,880
the calf is permitted to suckle from its

157
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:40,720
mother in order to help stimulate milk

158
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:44,240
let down at the times of milking

159
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:46,960
once milk is flowing freely the calf is

160
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,280
removed and the handler continues to

161
00:07:46,960 --> 00:07:52,000
milk the cow

162
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:54,800
at the end of the milking session

163
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:58,160
the calf is again permitted to circle

164
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:59,759
the mother and extract any remaining

165
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,280
milk

166
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,759
this practice

167
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:07,440
is used to prevent incidences of

168
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:09,280
mastitis due to incomplete milking by

169
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:12,639
the handler

170
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,680
a measured portion of the extracted milk

171
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,599
is provided to the growing calf using a

172
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:20,400
bucket

173
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:23,280
after the first month of its life

174
00:08:20,400 --> 00:08:27,840
the calf is moved to a further distance

175
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:30,639
from the cow and circling is discouraged

176
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,800
milk for the calf is fully provided

177
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,440
using a bucket

178
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,399
the farmers thus control the amount of

179
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:43,039
milk that is provided for their carbs

180
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:45,680
depending on the age of the calf

181
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:46,959
the common practice is for milk to be

182
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:48,399
provided

183
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,399
such that

184
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,440
in the first month

185
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,440
the calf is given up to six liters of

186
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:59,040
milk each day

187
00:08:55,440 --> 00:09:00,480
divided into three feeding times

188
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:01,839
in the morning

189
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:04,640
at midday

190
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:06,720
and in the evening

191
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,760
in the second month

192
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:12,160
milk for the calf is gradually reduced

193
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:15,279
to four liters per day

194
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,720
divided into two feeding times in the

195
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:20,640
morning and in the evening

196
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:23,040
at this stage

197
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,279
the calves are also exposed to good

198
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:28,080
quality fresh forage

199
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:31,360
to begin to stimulate the rumen

200
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:35,600
and are provided with some quantity

201
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:38,080
of clean water and mineral lick

202
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:41,360
farmers with more resources

203
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:44,080
also provide calf starter pellets for

204
00:09:41,360 --> 00:09:44,080
their calves

205
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,240
in the third month

206
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:53,120
the milk provided for the calf is

207
00:09:48,240 --> 00:09:55,839
gradually reduced to two liters per day

208
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:59,200
and in the fourth month

209
00:09:55,839 --> 00:10:01,760
the carbs are fully weaned off milk

210
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:05,120
and are provided with green forage

211
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:08,240
in addition to being left to graze on

212
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,240
crop residues

213
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:14,880
in the first two months of their lives

214
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:16,160
calves are normally housed in raised

215
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,399
pens

216
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:21,920
this is to ensure that they are

217
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,519
protected from external parasites that

218
00:10:21,920 --> 00:10:27,760
are often found in open fields

219
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:30,640
the calf pen is washed with their

220
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:33,040
carricides twice a week to prevent

221
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:35,920
infestation with ticks

222
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:38,160
and to protect the calves against

223
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:42,279
different diseases

224
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:46,240
the carbs are also washed with a gentle

225
00:10:42,279 --> 00:10:49,600
pyrethrin-based aquaricide

226
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:52,640
male calves are usually castrated soon

227
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:55,200
after birth if they are not earmarked

228
00:10:52,640 --> 00:10:57,760
for breeding

229
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:59,760
there are often several challenges that

230
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:03,519
are experienced when raising carbs

231
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,519
within the small holder systems

232
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:08,480
one of the main challenges is under

233
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:10,959
feeding of the calves

234
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:13,600
due to competition for milk

235
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,839
between the farmer household and the

236
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,920
calf

237
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:21,279
in some instances

238
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:24,000
the herders dilute the milk provided to

239
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:27,600
the calves with too much water

240
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,480
this results in water poisoning

241
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:32,320
diarrhea

242
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:35,440
in calves is also a common challenge

243
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:37,519
as the feeding containers may not have

244
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,200
been well cleaned

245
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:43,120
farmers are encouraged to use

246
00:11:39,200 --> 00:11:45,760
disinfectants and the strong sunlight to

247
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:49,279
help ensure that the containers are

248
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:52,320
clean and dry prior to putting the milk

249
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:52,320
in for the calves

250
00:11:52,480 --> 00:12:00,160
when environmental conditions are cold

251
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:02,160
the calves sometimes contact pneumonia

252
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,600
because of the drafts and the sudden

253
00:12:02,160 --> 00:12:05,600
changes in weather

254
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:11,200
it is important that the farmers provide

255
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:15,040
adequate housing for the calves in this

256
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,040
early stage of their lives

257
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:21,680
to encourage improved dairy production

258
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:25,920
livestock extension service providers

259
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:29,120
normally visit the smallholder farmers

260
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:31,600
there are also several training courses

261
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:35,279
for small holder farmers on proper

262
00:12:31,600 --> 00:12:36,399
management of carbs provided by both

263
00:12:35,279 --> 00:12:40,160
national

264
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:40,160
and development partners

265
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:46,639
with the cobit pandemic in 2020

266
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,519
it has been a challenge to access the

267
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:52,399
smallholder farmers

268
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,639
the ilre livestock genetics team

269
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:58,560
developed and availed

270
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:01,680
mobile phone-based extension materials

271
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:04,399
using different web applications that

272
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:05,440
are freely available to the small holder

273
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:08,399
farmers

274
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:10,880
following a simple online registration

275
00:13:08,399 --> 00:13:10,880
process

276
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:16,800
the training content is turned into fun

277
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:20,880
interactive lessons

278
00:13:16,800 --> 00:13:24,000
and quizzes to help guide the farmers

279
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,000
and also to encourage younger household

280
00:13:24,000 --> 00:13:30,399
members to take an interest in managing

281
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:32,399
the animals

282
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:35,760
the tools are available

283
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:38,320
in the main languages used in east

284
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:38,320
africa

285
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:42,880
currently

286
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,360
there are four courses available for the

287
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,360
users

288
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:52,800
you are welcome to ask any questions on
