00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:31,879
bathing in nutrient-rich Solutions

94
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,040
absorbing everything they need to grow

95
00:03:31,879 --> 00:03:36,480
this is Hydroponics a revolutionary

96
00:03:34,040 --> 00:03:38,159
method that doesn't rely on soil instead

97
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,439
plants are supported in systems that

98
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:43,080
circulate water infused with minerals

99
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:45,120
and nutrients it's an elegant solution

100
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:47,480
that turns traditional farming on its

101
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:49,599
head Hydroponics comes in several

102
00:03:47,480 --> 00:03:51,439
flavors each with its unique setup

103
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,239
there's the wick system quite the

104
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,200
passive player using no pumps or

105
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,360
electricity then there are the more

106
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:59,920
active systems like the nutrient film

107
00:03:57,360 --> 00:04:02,000
technique where a thin stream of water

108
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:04,000
constantly flows past the roots or

109
00:04:02,000 --> 00:04:06,319
consider the deep water culture where

110
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:08,159
plants literally float on water Serene

111
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:11,040

116
00:04:17,639 --> 00:04:22,240
supplies nutrients for the plants which

117
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,000
in turn purify the water for the fish

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:27,080
it's a harmonious environment that

119
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:29,919

00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:30,120
Technologies might sound straight out of

201
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:32,680
a Sci-Fi novel but they are very much a

202
00:07:30,120 --> 00:07:34,639
reality and a necessity as we've

203
00:07:32,680 --> 00:07:36,319
explored earlier the landscape of

204
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:39,039
Agriculture is undergoing a

205
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:41,400

farming let's start with Precision

213
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:57,720
farming this method uses data and

214
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,720
analytics to make farming more accurate

215
00:07:57,720 --> 00:08:01,800
and controlled Precision far Farming

216
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,960
tools allow Farmers to monitor soil

217
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:06,680
conditions weather patterns and crop

218
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,000
Health at an incredibly granular level

219
00:08:06,680 --> 00:08:10,879
this means inputs like water fertilizers

220
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,199
and pesticides are applied only where

221
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,479
needed and in the right amounts the

222
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,720
result a significant reduction in waste

223
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,159
lower costs and a smaller environmental

224
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:22,000
footprint moreover Precision farming

225
00:08:20,159 --> 00:08:24,680
boosts crop yields by ensuring that

226
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:27,360
crops get exactly what they need when

227
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:29,520
they need it next consider the role of

228
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,200
drones these flying Marvels are

229
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,919
reshaping how Farmers manage their

230
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:35,719
fields by providing a bird's eyee view

231
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,200
drones can quickly and efficiently

232
00:08:35,719 --> 00:08:40,599
monitor crop Health across vast areas

233
00:08:38,200 --> 00:08:42,959
detect Pest infestations and even spot

234
00:08:40,599 --> 00:08:44,560
irrigation problems some drones go a

235
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,560
step further equipped to spray

236
00:08:44,560 --> 00:08:48,720
pesticides or fertilizers precisely

237
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,160
where they are needed this not only cuts

238
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,480
down on labor costs but also reduces the

239
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:55,959
exposure of crops and importantly

240
00:08:53,480 --> 00:08:58,120
Farmers to potentially harmful chemicals

241
00:08:55,959 --> 00:09:00,640
Hydroponics and aquaponics introduce us

242
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:03,320
to the art of growing plants without

243
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:05,480
soil these systems use nutrient-rich

244
00:09:03,320 --> 00:09:07,519
water solutions to grow plants which can

245
00:09:05,480 --> 00:09:10,360
be set up anywhere from Urban rooftops

246
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:13,200
to Desert locals this method is not just

247
00:09:10,360 --> 00:09:15,839
about saving space it's about resource

248
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:18,600
efficiency hydroponic systems use up to

249
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:20,839
90% less water than conventional farming

250
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:23,040
because the water is recirculated the

251
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,200
controlled environment also means fewer

252
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:27,519
pests and diseases reducing the need for

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,640
pesticides and enhancing food safety and

254
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,440
