  "text": "hello everyone on behalf of Agri links speed the future and the USAID Bureau for food security I would like to welcome you to our webinar today on measuring performance and Agricultural Extension a common metrics framework my name is Julie McCarty and I'm with the USA Bureau for food security and I'll be your webinar facilitator today so you'll hear my voice periodically especially during our question-and-answer session before we dive into the content I'd like to go over a few housekeeping items to orient you to the webinar first and many of you have done this already please do use the chat box to introduce yourselves and let us know where you're coming from the chat box is your main way to communicate today and we encourage you to use it to post your questions at any point to share resources and to discuss this topic with your colleagues we'll be collecting your questions throughout the webinar and we'll try to answer some of them along the way in the chat box and we'll hold the rest until after the presentation you'll see that the slides are currently available for download and the little box in the bottom left of your screen and they're also some recommended links so we encourage you to explore those throughout the webinar and lastly we are recording this webinar and we'll e-mail you the recording the transcript and some additional resources once they are ready and they'll also be posted on the iGrow links website so you'll be able to forward this on to your colleagues as desired all right let's talk about extensions as many of you know Agricultural Extension and advisory services provide essential support to small holder farmers by providing them with the knowledge and tools about modern practices and technologies by facilitating co-learning within communities and by increasing access to finance and market solutions among other roles and as such AG extension is very fundamental to see the futures work with small holder farming communities I expect that many of you have joined today because you see value in having an established set of metrics to compare and contrast the performance of extension systems across different countries and contexts and feed the future of developing local extension capacity or elect projects as leading an initiative to develop a common work for extension metrics and we're excited to have three speakers on hand today to discuss this so I'll go ahead and introduce our speakers and then I will hand it over to them all right so first up will be Kristin Davis who is a senior research fellow with the International Food Policy Research Institute and has been there since 2004 her research involves research and capacity strengthening on Agricultural Extension education and agricultural innovation systems and she is currently the project director for the USA funded project developing local extension capacity or a d-league next up will be David Spielman who is a senior research fellow also at spring and has also been there since 2004 and he leaves the Institute's program on science technology and innovation policy and then we will also have Judy Paine who was USAID's digital solutions advisor for agriculture until just recently in 2017 and is now an independent consultant with the same focus and she's currently helping us aid missions and their projects use digital tools to increase thank you very much Julie and good day to all of you thank you so much for joining this webinar and I hope we'll have plenty of time for discussion so I'm going to try to advance the slides here and start with an introduction to the topic and I'd like to give you some background on the initiative that Julie mentioned to develop a common framework for extension metrics to date no common framework exists but we do see value in having a common set of metrics to consistently assess extension performance across countries and also across contexts I think a set of common metrics would help us to share and adapt learning to guide policymakers and funders and implementers as well with regard to how to invest in extension also just to innovate and to maximize impact as I said there is no common framework but where the initiative started then was with the best fit framework which is a conceptual framework developed by the International Food Policy Research Institute the best fit framework suggests an impact chain approach but first let me explain a little bit more what this framework is all about the premise of the best fit framework is there is no one-size-fits-all solution to extension and advisory services and we need local context specific and customized or best fit solutions to designing impactful extension how does this work we start with the extension system characteristics and these have to be adopted or fit to the frame conditions and you can see the frame conditions here surrounding the box in green it's the political system whether it's centralized or decentralized it's the farming systems and production input and output markets it's the business environment and civil society etc just a little pause here Julie to make sure everything's working fine no problems good gonna continue great so let's dig a little deeper here into the characteristics of the extension system and how they lead to performance in the previous slide here I showed you how the characteristics lead to performance which lead to outcomes or changes in behavior and then ultimate impacts digging a little deeper into the extension system characteristics and how they affect the performance we first of all have governance and management structures things like human resource management and the incentives and career paths if any monitoring and evaluation we then have both organizational and individual capacities of the extension services and for individual agents this includes technical skills but also your functional or soft skills as well which they need for their job and then we also have the methods which characterize extension services the ways in which extension interacts with farmers depending on their audience whether they're trying to reach women or youth teach something complicated where you might use farmer field schools or something where you use radio or demonstrations all of these characteristics which as I said are fit to the frame conditions then affect the performance of the systems and by performance we're talking about things like quality relevance timeliness demand Drive effectiveness and efficiency but where the best fit framework falls short is in establishing a common set of indicators against which to measure performance so that's what we want to talk about today and that brings us to the initiative for a common framework for metrics the initiative as Julie mentioned is led by the Feed the Future developing local extension capacity together with Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation the World Bank and of course USAID and this initiative came out of some joint discussions on how to transform extension globally including things like pluralism and the use of information and communication technologies or ICT there is a task force within the initiative that is working on this framework for common metrics which will be discussed actually in a face-to-face meeting in Uganda in February 2019 and we're hoping to bring together some potential adopters of the framework especially government's to see how they're going to use the framework and what we can do with it the task force up front decided that the metrics we're going to look at are going to be aspirational which means data that we want to not necessarily that we know we can get but also we'll focus on the public sector but within a pluralistic context and perhaps with modules for further users like the private sector and civil society what have we done to date as the extension metrics taskforce we've come up with a set of definitions of terms we've come up with a framework for the common metrics that includes outcome pillars or goals of extension the target audience and the domains across which we would like to measure extension and then we've taken and mapped potential metrics or data or indicators across the framework across the pillars the target audience and the domains to identify gaps and overlaps and I'm going to cover each of one of these one by one very quickly we have to find extension and advisory services broadly and in a pluralistic sense to be all of the services and information needed and demanded by producers that is aimed at developing their technical organizational and management capacity and empowering them to make better decisions with regard to their agricultural enterprise we then looked at the ultimate goals or the outcome pillars that most extension services have they have one or more of these goals one of these is with regard to productivity and income this means that producers are reaching their max maximum productivity and income potential from the agricultural activities a second goal many extension programs have is sustainable resilience where producers mitigate adapt to and recover from shocks and stresses in a way that reduces chronic vulnerability while at the same time ensuring environmental sustainability and then a third pillar is surrounding empowerment and equity and here we're saying that all producers including those that are marginalized or vulnerable the poor sometimes women youth pastor lists all of these people have access to fair agricultural opportunities to agency and to human capital in order to make better farming decisions so those are our pillars looking at the target audience I said we're going to focus on the public sector this is your government's your public research organisations your policymakers but we also think this framework might be applicable to the private sector agribusinesses private service providers and then broadly defined to civil society as well these include your donors nonprofits and NGOs cooperatives and farming farmer organizations and then the last area we looking at is the domains within the extension system we start with the systems which are your overall extension structures the institutions networks and incentive things like linkages between organizations or policies that guide extension or even your share of the public budget the second area is that of inputs these are the resources that are used to implement extension activities like your extension agent workforce the government budget per household and things like that the third domain is that of delivery the processes and actions taken to achieve outputs and deliver or achieve outcomes and this is your organization and management Quality Assurance training or even use of ICT information and communication technologies we then have your outputs which are the most immediate set of accomplishments necessary but not sufficient to produce the outcomes which are your changes in behavior things like the households reached are included within the outputs and then lastly we have outcomes these are as I said your changes in behavior these are immediate intermediate observable and measurable changes that can be attributed to extension and can result in ultimate impacts things like adoption change in behavior change in attitude knowledge there's one area we did not include and it would be interesting to discuss and that is the ultimate impacts that's mentioned here these are very difficult to measure and also difficult to attribute to extension programs and Judy and David might discuss that further we'll see but any arm have done here is to give you some background on the extension metrics initiative and a quick overview of what we've done in terms of definitions and the start of the common framework the outcome pillars the target audience and the domains and with that I'd like to turn it over to my colleague dr. David Spellman to start to talk about the challenges of extension metrics Thanks all right thanks Kristin I hope everybody can still hear me it's great to have such a large audience on Agri links with an interesting extension metrics and it's very consistent as this large audience with the evolution of thinking in many quarters on extension you know in which we're moving from what's historically been a very strong focus on research metrics that is the upstream source of Science and Technology for agricultural growth and transformation to a new and very much complementary focus on the last mile and the downstream solutions for getting products and services to people which includes information and extension recommendations so you know quite naturally we want to have indicators benchmarks and baselines to gauge progress on this front on our sort of investments or our programs or our projects in extension but let me offer a quick sort of reality check there are some fundamental challenges in measuring extension so let's start with you know what you might call sort of a an epistemological debate at a very basic level it can be argued that extension cannot be isolated or identified at least not in the way we define extension in our theory of change that Kristin presented in the earlier slides Emily let's face it do we really know what individuals employed by the Agricole chiral service organization are doing are they providing farmers with advice or are they doing other things monitoring crop production distributing fertilizer and other inputs collecting on overdue loans and so on an even extension can be isolated or identified can it be quantified can quantitative measures adequately explain a complex system that is specific to farming systems or Agri ecology society culture economy and so on and even if it can be quantified are we sure we have a complete understanding of how extension works are we sure that extension leads to better farmers or do better farmers simply seek out extension services all right let me make sure that everybody can still hear me yeah I think I'm good and then continuing this sort of leads us to the broader debate of wear indicators matter in our identified theory of change along with the impact pathway we have to think carefully about what we're trying to measure are they proximate input indicators on sort of the level and reach of extension or are they more sort of you know distant outcome indicators such as the causal relationship between extension and these productivity income or sustainability outcomes of the care about we have to think carefully about the importance of attributing causality which Kristin referred to earlier or really understanding that relationship between extension on the one hand and those outcomes of interest that we care about and trying to demonstrate that they're more than simple correlations and that we're accounting for confounding factors in other words is there really a link between receiving extension services and you know improving your crop yields or you know improving the sustainability of farming or improving the welfare or income of a household or members of that household it's a tough question all right but let's put those things aside for a moment and assume that we're comfortable with the idea the very idea of measuring extension so now we have to select construct and interpret some set of indicators but there's no an internationally accepted standard of what can be classified as say public spending on extension or who's considered an extension astoria Nagant or how to classify how to classify capital equipment used in extension service provision so thankfully we have some precedent to build on here an analogous set of questions and an analogous exercise began in the late nineteen eighty in the measurement of agricultural research it frees agricultural Science and Technology indicators for instance collects compiled and disseminates internationally comparable data and information on investment in agricultural research its advantage and what makes it distinct from the exercise we're talking about today on extension is that the a few metrics draw on comprehensive definitions of what constitutes research that were developed by the OECD and laid out in their Frascati manual so maybe in the measurement of extension we need to develop something similar maybe it's up to us to develop that manual or that guidance on how to measure extension and what constitutes extension so a key principle of the of the ASCII approach or any approach really is that we need to measure extension or whatever it is we're measuring at the point where the actual action takes place it's the principle of subsidiarity in asti they look at the Agricultural Research Center or Institute or at the university research program or lab that same principle applied to extension though is a bit trickier and what scale - extension metrics make analytical sense for data collection or for other purposes do we measure extension at sort of the central or federal level or do we go hunting for data on extension at the state or provincial level or at the county and district level or even further down at a very local sort of village or community level do we measure by geography agro ecology farming system commodity or value chain those are very different units of an and do we focus on measuring public extension only or do we try to get proprietary information from private firms on their customer support and advisory services so all of this suggests the need for data collection and I would argue that if we want to track extension metrics over time and space which is certainly the the goal of this conversation we need to collect new data and definitely not repackage existing data but collecting new data costs a lot of money thankfully several new initiatives out there can help us either by bringing useful data into our reach or by providing us with new data collection methods for example consider the World Bank living standards measurement survey and it's integrated surveys on agriculture which provides cross country comparability on questions such as whether a respondent has met with an extension officer in the last year or so or consider the women's empowerment indicators under the women's empowerment in agriculture index has been developed by my colleagues of mine here in history and elsewhere way the way assembles novel data and analytics on how men and women live work and interact in the context of developing country agriculture and a lot of these data points could be used to obtain a very valuable gendered perspective on extension provision and performance so that leads us to what I think is really the essential question or the biggest challenge can extension metrics actually influence policy change for example by encouraging governments to invest more in extension or to undertake meaningful structural reforms in extension I think that the world has made tremendous progress in using evidence data evidence like we're talking about here to advance policy change but we all know that there are other factors like political imperatives that affect policy change much more than simply a set of good metrics more importantly even if we assume that our metrics have merit we still need to ask if metrics are the right to either a lot of very powerful people talk about using metrics to name and shame or rank and spank countries who don't invest enough in development priorities but does that get us to the outcomes we really want you know extension systems are not a competitive sports league like say the English Premier League and the standings are there on the screen in front of you or the National Football League here in the United States where team rankings points and other statistics are the very essence of the game a metric has to be actionable to be policy relevant otherwise how does a policymaker do anything about a low score or a low rank and a metric also has to be substantive so that policymakers cannot simply game the system by investing in one topic or solving one particular problem to somehow move themselves up the ranks there's been a lot of critique of the World Bank's Ease of Doing Business Index or data collection and analysis project along these lines and it's something to think about very carefully so having said all that I think an attempt to measure extension is is a tremendously good idea and we're fortunate that the Gates Foundation the Bullet Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation along with several other key organizations have taken a stab at this challenge to guide their own investments and their own grant making so what you have in front of you is a list of key indicators that the foundation is considering for their extension dashboard they form what I would argue is a good starting point for any country or program considering an investment in developing local extension capacity I'll walk through them very quickly for you and we can talk more about them later if you like they are for instance the share of public budget spent on extension and we would normalize that by dividing it by the total agricultural budget so sort of a percentage-wise intensity measure we could also normalize that on a per household basis an interesting metric that they're proposing is financial incentives for extension agents such as the ratio of an extension agent daily wage to let's say a royalty daily wage continuous improvement processes so the proportion of extension personnel annually trained in specialized courses households directly reached by public extension again that's a fairly standard measure but an important one households reached by all extension whether it's from the public sector or from the private sector or from civil society organizations the quality of public extension the share of households for instance reporting the public extension services were at least somewhat useful on a Likert scale kind of measure or service to female farmers the share of females in small holder households reporting that they received extension services or inclusivity that is something like maybe an index of inclusivity of extension services relative to some defined disenfranchised or underserved population so these are probably some of the metrics that we should be considering and I and I would argue they're a great starting point for this kind of initiative and on that note let me just wind up my remarks simply by encouraging everyone to think about the feasibility relevance and influence of these kind of metrics in their own context be it their own country context the agroecology that are concerned about the farming systems that they that they observe the provinces or states they work in or the value chains and commodities that they focus on and with that let me hand it off to Judy Dane thank you very much thank you Davis um I assumed the handlers of Agri links will let me know if I'm not being heard well unlike Kristin and David I do not have a research background and the academic discipline and clear experience that they have pardon I come from I came from the US private sector and then spent about a decade at US aid and have at least as strong as interest as as Kristen and David and the others on the small task force we put together on figuring out better metrics for extension I'm especially interested in cost-effectiveness of extension I've given I've worked for government and of course are insured by government and also the impact of extension on the poor especially I focus on digitally enabled extension and visually enabled extension providers and users often assume impact and cost effectiveness when that's not the case or it certainly shouldn't be assumed it may be other proven techniques are better so I think these metrics will help us get at that I'm just going to pose a few questions and hope that they'll provoke thoughts from the audience and participation and additional questions from you I wanted to point out that this is we're presenting this as a point in time it's definitely a work in progress the informal task force of a handful of people is working towards the convening that Kristen mentioned that we hope to have in early 2019 but we wanted to open up the discussion to more people to get feedback we know the metrics we have and the work that we're doing is not is not as good as it can get and we hope to get it much better before 2019 so please study these slides and give us feedback during the discussion but also afterwards you can contact any of us and also our colleagues at the Gates Foundation and the World Bank as well so I'll pose a couple of questions just to get the thinking going a thing that asked about whether this would influence decision-making and there is a concern that we try to set this up in some way for governments to compete but I desert that if we can find some agreed-upon metrics and even one country or two can stand up and say I'm willing to be measured against that and show that they've made progress I think that alone would be a great success and then other countries might follow again it's not like they're doing business indicators but it still would be I think a point of pride for governments that are really struggling and working on improving their extension services so I think for decisions policymaking it could have an effect that we do know and we want governments that are working on extension to participate in this convening to see whether they find these measures useful Kristen also pointed out that we're looking at fresh aspirational measures right now hold on just a minute I want to just to make sure everything's going okay I will get out of full screen just to make sure okay I think we're just fine so the rational versus actually indicators that we can use now David actually pointed out the many challenges to have metrics that we can collect for overtime all those things are are certainly true I'd say we still need to define things as aspirational and then see how close we can get with at least a few measures to start out I'd be interested if you think that we have forgotten any critical measures here I'll go on to my next slide we're have additional questions or we are have we gotten carried away I think one danger is that we'll forget that most public extension services are directed to help farmers but especially poor farmers and do we have enough indicators to balance that interest or will we be applauding extension services that go after the most able farmers and are not rewarded for doing the harder work sometimes of making sure the more remote farmers the remote households can benefit from extension services before our convening we want to make sure we've done homework by talking with others in a broader context and maybe you have ideas of organizations you want to make sure we talk with and it may be your organization and how well will this be accepted or we be useful by agribusinesses say or or public or private extension service providers are these measures irrelevant can additional ones be added is there metric some how to tackle how well the public extend service is leveraging private service providers that's another really tough one so there's there's lots of questions again this is a starting point so we look forward to a rich discussion I'm honored that I get to be the sort of provocateur on this and I'm very pleased that we have people like Kristin and David with such experience to keep us self keep as disciplined as we go through this effort so I think I'll turn this over to Jimmy now who can figure out what questions you all have great thank you so much Judy and thanks also to your dogs Waldo for his patience and waiting for you to present if we've had some fun side discussion about hearing him a little bit but so there are a lot of questions and comments coming in the chat box which is wonderful so we'll go back and start with some of the questions that came in a bit earlier I also wanted to reassure everyone that we will be sharing the chatbox content with the presenters so any comments you type in that are answering some of the provocative questions that judy has asked your answers to those and your commentary will go to the presenters and the Judy mentioned there's also opportunity to think about these and provide commentary after this webinar all right so looking back to some of the earlier questions that came in let's see all right Kristin or David perhaps I can toss this one to Kristin to start Viviani or Viviana Palmieri asked is there any reason why the system is limited to extension instead of considering the broader innovation systems or what other related systems oh thanks okay go for it David I can I can take that one viviana thank you very much for the question certainly measuring attributes of the wider innovation system which includes research and education business and enterprise and the general enabling environment the role of cooperatives and extension among many other things is important extension is just one element in a larger agricultural innovation system and we acknowledge that I think what we're trying to achieve here is simply putting some very small boundaries around what we can measure and hoping that contributes to broader measurement of the innovation system so for instance in AG innovation systems we do measure agricultural R&D through initiatives like Asti we also look at you know measurements around educational achievement and and performance systems and whatnot through forum and others and so on and so forth the task of measuring every little aspect of an innovation system is very very broad and very very challenging that's why in this particular exercise we're trying to parse it out to something that's directly relevant to sort of the the investments and the the choices and decisions that governments and their development partners make to help them inform that process that decision-making process thank you Kristin there are two questions that came in from Mahesh shondor during your presentation and so I thought I'd ask them both to you since they're sort of short questions one was can we use the same metrics for different extension service providers and the other was asking about measuring productivity profitability yes thanks very much Mahesh for joining us from India can the same metrics be used for different service providers that very much depends on the goal or the outcome pillars that we're looking for so some providers might be looking more for public goods outcomes like food security and and increasing incomes and others you know might be looking for different goals and outcomes so it's going to really depend on your your goal and your pillar but we are trying to make a modular approach where you can sort of pick and choose what what outcomes or indicators are going to work for you and it's I'm getting into Steve Fran's ELLs question a little bit but we'll address that later with regard to looking at the overall matrix that we've come up with you also asked about productivity versus profitability and we actually had that debate within the taskforce we started off with productivity and then we said but that's not the ultimate goal the ultimate goal is maybe to improve livelihoods or increase incomes or something like that and so we do have an element of productivity we might expand that and you know it's not just crop productivity there can also be factor productivity issues as well but we do include the element of profitability because that's a step beyond the productivity excellent thank you all right let's jump up to well you mentioned that Stephen had asked a question so perhaps Kristen we can jump to his question and Steve asked how are the ten listed metrics linked to the overall objectives goals or desired impacts of extension that would help us see gaps and overlap yeah thanks Steve and Judy and David feel free to chime in after I've said my bit we do have a rather complex looking matrix that has your your domains down the left side and then the audience across the right the pillars across the right and then we've put in those initial on Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation indicators as well as some others that we've been looking at in exactly to do that to see where are the gaps and what we have seen is that there are a number of gaps in outcome pillars like sustainability and equity so those are things that we're working on it's it was really I think too tough to show to a webinar type of audience but hopefully we're going to have something out of the task force in the coming months that we can share publicly and you can see more clearly how it goes this is Judy echo what Kristen said we we were limited to what we could present but the matrix that Kristen refers to is is very useful for taking a look at what we're missing and the question of equity is one where were where we need to think much further I think once we work a little bit more we'll get that matrix in some form may be multiple matrixes out there for more review great thank you both David I'll ask a couple of questions that came in during your presentation first up from Reginald to sense based on your experience what is the minimum timeframe to measure the impact of an extension system alright that's it that's a tricky question obviously if you're trying to measure let's say the impact of a large extension system reform process right changing salaries and incentives you know providing more different infrastructure creating you know new administrative routines and procedures new leadership things like that you know the IMP the the the time frame may be anywhere from what two two to five years five to ten years it's very hard to say depending on it depends on what outcome indicators you care about things like profitability productivity incomes and welfare obviously take take some time to manifest but in other in other instances for instance you can measure the impact of a very simple extension intervention in a single season so I'll give you two examples that we've worked on under under the development local extension capacity project funded by see the future in US aid in Ethiopia working with digital green and the government of Ethiopia we examine the impact of a video video enabled extension approach on on farmers adoption of new crop management practices for the main cereal crops and we found that after one season simply engaging farmers in sort of you know video screenings on new technologies and practices that we saw increases in adoption levels by five to eight percentage points which are translated into a much larger adoption rate on the order of you know fifteen to twenty percent against the the consuming of the the control or what people were otherwise doing in other words we saw significant increases in adoption of new technologies after one season simply by the video extension approach in Uganda we saw much of the same thing and after one season we were focusing on maize and the use of video enabled a video based extension approaches we actually saw increases not only an adoption but also in yield maize yields based on what people learned in the videos of how best management practices recommended management practices so if it's a simple like ICT based intervention you can you can measure a lot of impacts in one season if it's a structural reform process well that's a lot longer great David and allow me to throw one more out to you you would discuss you know the difficulty of measuring ultimate impacts I think my house gender added another kind of layer to that difficulty which is that impact is an outcome of multiple factors so how to isolate the impact due to extension or should we even try what do you think about that well like in the examples I just gave from Ethiopia and Uganda as well as work that other colleagues of mine have done in India Aroo and many other countries I I think with a well-designed evaluation strategy you can definitely measure the impact of very specific extension interventions to give you the example of what one of my colleagues didn't Peru he he looked at what they looked at the the impact of providing agronomic recommendations to children in high schools and trying to measure whether that affected what their parents did back on the farm and in fact they found significant effects of this sort of intergenerational transfer of information that's pretty exciting right you know give extension messages in a school and and lo and behold the parents actually adopt you know new practices on the farm so so you can certainly measure some of these things the question is you know how what are you trying to measure how broad are you trying to measure with good evaluation design you can measure a lot of things but like I said earlier if we're talking about systemic reforms you probably need a lot more data to be able to you know control for or account for confounding influences like changes in the in the political winds or changes in you know the weather over time things like that or changes in market forces and prices as long as you can count for those kind of factors there is possibility to to to suss out the impact of extension its but it can be challenging both in terms of data and and sort of quality of inquiry so you know your evaluation strategy really matters but we do it all the time we love to do it and it's something that we would love to explore with many of our partners great thank you David and thank you to all of our participants who are putting some really excellent questions and comments in the chat box all right so there were a couple of questions that came in about private service providers and so I'll ask them both and we can perhaps answer them in combination so Padma Singh asked about the presenters thoughts on considering service providers and angry entrepreneurs as a target audience of Agriculture X Agricultural Extension and then the Catherine Killaloe wanted to know about how does the private sector compare in terms of cost effectiveness of delivery and understanding those business cases yes o process.i conservative Judy first okay well I think I would distinguish between third-party service providers that are providing digitally enabled extension ones that would be providing it for private agribusinesses as well as for public extension service providers say digital green does this so they would be I would I would assume severally these metrics would be relevant for them to be able to prove that their services are are worth paying for by the public sector or an agribusiness so that would be I think many of the made metrics apply directly another category of private sector folks in extension are those that are say sectoral associate Asians for coffee or cocoa these are very large plantation operators for pineapple or other large export crops a very short list of metrics might be relevant if they get public funds they would care about the ones related to equity but I'd love to hear candidates who might be able to tell us whether these are relevant or not you can just actually let us know in the chat window and we can later follow up so Kristin and David probably have some comments as well all right if Kristin or David would like to chime in on those so you feel free so many good ones I'm I'm just doing my best to sort through them all let's see all right for Kristin Marissa sternness asked are there targets or guidelines for any of these metrics once you get the data how would you know if you're doing well for example if they're I recommend oh thanks or it's a very very good question and that's an important one as well it does depend on the indicator so the fao for instance has some recommendations of minimum budgets that should be spent on extension services or minimum number of extension agent to Farmer ratio things like that but in in general I think a lot of the things there is going to be no no recommendation perhaps at national level maybe the organization implementing it might have their own targets and so forth interestingly I was on a webinar yesterday with the UNDP Green commodities program and they are trying to set up a comparable sort of way to diagnose extension systems that would start with a baseline and give scores over the years so there are some related initiatives going on but David or Judy I'm not sure if you want to add anything to that I can I can say I guess one thing I think you know you can use metrics in so many ways cross country comparability for instance gives you the you know a chance to see what those countries that you like to compare yourself to are doing and think of that in an aspirational sensing okay China does this we want to be like that or Ethiopia does this we want to be like that for instance but I think more importantly for any given country a program these types of indicators are simply good to benchmark oh you know changes over time and look at you know what types of investments what type of personnel what type of resources are being channeled into extension and you know over the years and is it improving or is it not improving I mean and whether you know people perceive quality changes in relevance and usefulness of extension so you can use it in so many different ways I guess I guess you know like I was saying earlier in my presentation part what you probably don't want to do is though is get into this you know sort of competitive you know race to the top race to the bottom because sometimes you know the context is so specific that it's you know one country is trying to get to where another country is but the systems are really different or the challenges are really different you know does that serve anybody's purpose or policymakers try to game the system by throwing money at extension without thinking about you know quality or administration or or incentives and things like that does that really help things so there are you know using using extension indicators in different ways is good using them cautiously is even better this is Judy I have one related comment actually it sort of veers us off set the topic of goals although I think that's a great question and that will certainly depend on the comments of Kristin David made I was thinking I've read quite a bit about one acre fund lately and it provides extension services it provides financing it provides input it provides a package of things it doesn't worry about distinguishing what its extension type services are doing versus its other services it's focused primarily on scaling and outcome so that it's sort of a counterpoint to that the for middle effort we're talking about here and in a way it makes it easier for many organizations that might somewhat like that to look for results so maybe the third-party service providers could keep that in mind and give us comments on whether any of this is even relevant if you've got some focused goals of your own questions that are really related I think to what you were all just discussing about adapting the content of the framework near and jakka Rama Stan javo asked do we want a measurement that is comparable globally or something that is specific to the needs and context of each country and Marisa our new staffs are really good question saying that these indicators are geared towards governments or measuring at a higher administration level can they be adapted to community level interventions from NGOs and how well good questions no simple answers I'm sure Kristin and David could chime in as well if we get good measures defined they certainly can be used at a sub-national level between communities and with civil society organizations they'll just have to pick and choose and figure out practical ways that they can use them you know clearly they won't be able to do as a rigorous of data collection as would be possible without an international organization like if pre coming from the private sector I tend to have a more practical outlook on it being some is better than nothing at all and if we have metrics that we've together defines then all the better so try to get try to use define metrics and then figure out how well though you are they'll work for you for your organization your community Kristin David do you have more thoughtful comments I guess I guess just to say that you know international comparability has its pros and cons and it can be useful for for instance for international development partners multilateral and bilateral donor agencies in making investment choices and decisions that's why the Gates Foundation developed their bash their dashboard after all that's why I'm sure Feed the Future USA and many others care about these these sort of international comparability --zz that we're talking about but of course at a government or country level and that a look at an organizational level they're also important some degree of standardization is helpful because again you can use a baseline and benchmark and compare whether it's between organizations or states or countries or or whatever you choose I think that's the key to indicators well you know commonly accepted indicators make life I think a lot more useful or a lot a lot easier then everybody choosing your own indicators from Thomas Caffrey Osvald how can the impact of extension services be effectively measured when one farmer may be receiving overlapping extension support for example from public Extension Service as well as from private sector when coupled with investment in new technology or input that's a great question again it goes back to the response again to Mahesh earlier you know it depends on your evaluation design and what you're trying to measure so you know those are simply questions you can ask well we regularly ask them in in household farm household surveys where we ask people farmers where you know where do they get information from about you know crop acts or technology why and and we allow for multiple responses might come from public extension or private extension sources or might be some combination of both now you know I've been in the field where a public extension agent is working with it was a corporate sales agent at the same time to promote a new a new cultivar a new hybrid a new you know a new machine or something like that so yeah people work in tandem people working in collaborative ways I think that's perfectly fine and and you know as long as you're able to account for that and have that information then you know you can you can parse out you can parse out the effects I mean you know sometimes there's an art to this sometimes there's a science to it it really depends on what the intention of your evaluation is if you're trying to say okay you know my NGO did this and the government didn't then then you know that's a fairly I think narrow assessment approach or evaluation approach if you're trying to say well you know information from you know these types of sources led to the outcomes we care about then that might be I think a more realistic way of approaching the problem or the question it really ultimately depends on what your learning objectives and what your evaluation objectives are in this case great thank you David all right let's see curtain I will show a question to you from Vicki Sigmund is the expectation that public sector Extension will support ie pay for data collection or otherwise what role will they play if the public sector is to support this then are there clear indications or if I guess if the public so there are there clear indication thanks hi Vicki thanks for your excellent question there is some expectation that there will be interest on the side of governments and actually this is part of the role of the task force now and the next few months is to go and to start to talk to potential governments that we think would be interested and to see are they interested in collecting extension metrics and then invite them to the convening in Uganda in February and sit down and hash through it a little bit more so how it's gonna be done is is yet to be seen it might be different in every country but there is the expectation but there's going to be funding whether it's coming from a sort of an outside donor or governments in terms of using these data to inform and advocate for their policies for extension that's that remains to be seen Thank You Kristen and we still have some good time for questions but I just wanted to flag a few upcoming events and activities on a burling's first to feed the future learning agenda the draft agenda for phase 2 FC the future is currently open for public comment and you can see the dress learning agenda and a survey link for commenting there next to number one number two if you are a student or you know one who is working in the food security and agriculture space Agri links is currently having a young scholars blog contest but which students can submit their blog post about their work or their insights on global food security and we're going to pick with a panel of US aid and Agri links individuals we're going to pick the top blog post to published and feature on Agri links so do encourage your student students in your life to apply and lastly we wanted to announce the October theme month for every links right now we're in extension month clearly but next month is going to be value-added food month which I'm really excited to to talk about we'll probably be having a webinar on orange flash super to potato and been talking about all of the entrepreneurial ways that farmers processors other actors can add value to food for better incomes and better nutrition so keep all of those in mind oh and I also wanted to point out in the links box to your left you'll see a link for the del X community of practice we definitely encourage everyone on this webinar to join that community of practice the there will be a lot of additional ways to discuss these topics through that website and through some webinar and other discussion opportunities that Dee lek presents so don't hesitate to join that COP alright so back to oh we've got a bit of an a large none of that links box we'll go ahead and bring the head back dad so that was just really telling you all to click on those links excellent okay so back the questions that have come in okay I will go to a question that came in from Kathy Perry in the ten common metrics the quality of public extension is a metric but the same approach of determining quality is not applied to the private sector is it implicitly implied that private sector extension does not need to be assessed for quality of extension and Judy was that one that you could address sure I'll start how many come from the private sector and the private sector cares a lot about success and it defines what did success means if it's getting donor money of course it cares a lot what donors care about but say a private company that owns pineapple plantation cares a lot about productivity it cares a lot about making sure its workers stick to them and we hope are treated well but we can't these metrics will be decided by so they're not by the private sector but maybe some of the others could chime in but certainly any service provider cares a lot about showing how effective their services are so those metrics will be truly relevant yeah I can quickly add to that I'd say that we have some experience on on the measurement of agricultural research indicators to say what's possible what's not possible measuring both the levels and the the type of private investment in agricultural research for instance has proven to be very difficult especially for for initiatives like a steam which I mentioned earlier and that's largely because AG research indicators that is you know investment spending things like that personnel and so on our proprietary information they form for many companies they form the basis of their competitive advantage in the margin you know in very competitive marketplaces so think along the same lines our extension if you're a an agro service provider of some sort your private your profit-making you don't necessarily you know want to give out information on hey how many people do we have on the ground providing after sales support or providing you know recommendations to farmers and advice on an ad hoc basis or you know through our call center or whatever it is that might be proprietary information that you know that that the company wants to protect so that becomes very difficult to get so you know but that doesn't imply that it's not it's not the quality of private extension is not an important measure as Judy said you know people care about the quality of their products in the private sector as much if not more than they do in the public sector so somebody's measuring it it's a question of whether it's going to be shared in the public domain or not thank you great thank you so much I'd like to toss it back to you David for a really interesting question that came in from the Civic Amol Yan looking at the gapes metrics what if we were to reach 100 percent of households covered by extension have a very generous public budget service the females etc but no essential increase in yield for hectare no increase in production and trade are those the most important and probably the only metrics that matter that's a great question doc I thought earlier I had to laugh it's it's yes it's precisely what one wants to be asking the proof is in the pudding as they say if you measure something but you can't attribute that measurement to some outcome of interest then then maybe the problem the problem isn't your measurement so much as it is your theory of change so what you're basically describing here is a situation in which your theory of change doesn't stand up to - you know empirical testing and that extension has no effect on these outcomes of interest in which case you probably have to go back to the drawing board and say well extension really has nothing to do with you know productivity profitability incomes welfare environmental sustainability and so on and so forth now of course whether you know whether that's really the case is a bigger question and and I think that's again where we go back to a good evaluation design and saying okay you know we've got some measurements on extension and now we want to go back and make sure that that we're able to say that you know these measurements are somehow correlated and potentially infer causality about their you know their their influence on on outcomes so yeah there's a lot of sort of you know hypothesis testing and all of this not just measurement and and that's something we have to be very very I think serious about in our work thank you David and I would like to throw out another question that came in from Alma do if Sokka can we use the same approach to measure quality outcomes like for instance the functionality of innovations platform farmers capacity to mobilize funds from institutions etc and that was for David or Kristin you can fill in the gaps yeah thanks for your question I mean I think this is is an approach that can be applied in other similar institutions I mean extension is quite a complex institution and then when you're getting into innovation platforms and things like that it includes even more variables and actors and so forth but I think the general setup of how we're looking at this and applying things based on those different domains as well as the different outcome pillars I think we could try to apply it to two similar activities like innovation platforms and so forth David [Music] so there's been some interesting work on the measurement of the functionality of innovation platforms for instance by it by Pam book at Wageningen University in the Netherlands and as well as colleagues so so yeah and you can certainly measure those types of outcome you can measure things like farmer's capacity to mobilize funds from financial institutions and so on those are all indicators that you can even look at and whether they're linked to extension you're thinking the theory have changed and and how you measure it one I would I would suggest that if you're really interested in these topics and and poking around in the data take a look at those at the LSMs integrated surveys on agriculture from the World Bank that I mentioned earlier I mean there's there's a incredible amount of information there that people are really digging through intensively to learn more exactly the kind of questions you're asking you know and and you know I kind of sort of data analysis and approaches are are key to answering but they're but they're they're good ones they're good ones to explore Oh finally speaking alright okay interesting comments came in from gear Gary Alex that I thought that Kristin could address so Gary said for an understanding of extension systems it is probably important to start from the farmer level to understand the needs objectives preferences and potential actors too often we have gaps in the understanding and perspective and treat the farmer as a blank slate to be worked on it is hard to think of how this might be reflected in an indicator but it's important yes hi Gary my first comment is that we're going to try to rope you into this task force I don't know if John got in touch with you yet but we'd love your inputs on it but certainly for an extension program to be to be relevant and as you say effective and all of these things I mean it's got to be relevant and useful to the clientele and the extension services need to have that client client oriented approach so we do need to have their opinions it it would be interesting to look for some indicators to reflect that and it's of course again going to depend on our ultimate program goals and program objectives so if we're trying to empower farmers and have a demand driven program that's certainly one that we would want to oh great I think David you said you had some additional comments sure so so let me see if I can tackle two comments one is related to what Gary Alex said and another one from Andrea borne on the importance of using data collected from farmers to who to provide feedback to farmers so so at these both of these comments have a similar thread or a similar vein which is that you know you know often when we think about metrics and indicators we're really we're really top down and how we think about things right we're thinking of this big system level and we want to measure things so we have international comparability and we can you know steer our investments in the right way well that's all good and fine but if we don't really understand sort of what's going on at the grassroots level and if we're not really using this type of information to inform people at the grassroots level then we're probably falling short of our objectives and you know I couldn't agree more I mean I think that's exactly the way we should be thinking about development processes development processes economic and social development do not occur on the basis of what we think about in Washington DC or Seattle or London or Paris or wherever they happen at the grassroots where people exist and the more we think about farmers as a diverse set of people that are more than just farmers the better we are at understanding how to tailor extension services to fit their needs one of the things we care about in particular when we're looking at indicators of you know how well is extension achieving the outcomes that were focused on is to think not at the average effect size or the average the magnitude of the average effects but also to parse it out and think a little bit about how certain subgroups are affected so for instance thinking about you know the work in Uganda Uganda has a inordinately large number of women headed households because of demographic pressures pressures associated not just with urbanization but also the hiv/aids and like that that the country has suffered through for decades so focusing on that particular sub population is really important women headed households are children and youth headed household in Uganda are a significant part of the population and we don't think about much so focusing on them getting you know getting a better understanding what extension does and doesn't do for them is a great way to to address these these these issues so yes I think starting from the bottom up and worrying less about not worrying less but but you know maintaining a balance between what we think about the grassroots and what we think of that this this much higher systems levels is necessary balance is everything thank you great very interesting answers thank you to both of you let's see we do have about up to ten more minutes for questions but in the meantime we wanted to throw up a few poll questions for all of you to help us better understand your experience on the webinar so we'd love to know how likely it is that you would recommend this webinar to a friend or colleague did anything surprise you from the content of this webinar are you walking with any new insights what was not address that we could potentially address in the future asking about if you'd like to stay involved in the common metrics initiative so that we can continue to reach out to you and what was most useful to your work so please to let us know your answers to these questions they'll help us better shape future webinars and events all right let's see we've got just a few more questions that I think we can answer and a question flash comment came in from Suzanne Pullen's that I will toss out Suzanne said farming is a business how do business advisory services measure impact what metrics do these business advisory services use and could these be relevant to farming businesses and other agribusinesses and judy we thought perhaps you could start on that question actually I would ask Suzanne to bet herself she's an expert on all of this so and I learned a lot from her and I hope to continue so I don't have any any answer that Suzanne probably wouldn't have herself clearly farming is a business it's more than a business it's a it's the household livelihood so measuring business services as part of it as part of extension is a big challenge both Kristen and David are better students of the definition of extension and we're business advisory services fit in so maybe they can comment on where what metric would tackle that all right and Judy let me toss another one out to you from Padma Singh how do we ensure that producers are getting a fair share in benefit in private sector extensions as the governor or does the government have a role here I say follow the money his government has money in those service services being provided or a donor does then yes the government has a role in measuring that and of course in some countries there are rules about how farmers or our service of those getting services ash should be served or treated clearly if a private company is providing these services on its own for its own gains and that of its owners then the government has far less of a role and given I came from the private sector I I certainly honor that private businesses ever have strong reasons to measure their own success they surely have to protect those that they serve through various other laws but applying these metrics by the government on totally private service providers I don't think we'd have to do that with great caution and maybe do it voluntarily so that the private services providers can have an incentive to do it to show how well they serve their audience to that question I think there's a number of people on the webinar Gary and Ontario David and myself who have been trying to measure extension and you know struggling with with indicators and data and so forth so it is a trade-off I mean there's the data we ideally would like to have and we're starting from there and we're gonna try to get it and see how it works in the end its it might be necessary to come down to you know what's gonna be more feasible and more easy to collect so we're gonna we're gonna see about piloting this in one or more countries and and take it from there and see what works [Music] great Thank You Kristen and David let me look way back to your presentation for a question that came in fairly early on from Hamid or Rahman who said it is difficult to measure outcomes in terms of monetary value is there any good indicator available for the researchers or just a little bit more perspective on measuring monetary value it depends on which outcomes you are interested in monetary value can certainly be measured to give you to give you a sense we've been talking a lot about profitability of farming or farm activities so if we if we want to put a monetary value on that you know we look at we look at the costs and returns to to cultivation of a particular crop or commodity or the whole farms the overall profitability you know when you think about simply yield gains right you can translate that into monetary value by multiplying the quantity of production increased multiplied by the price of the crop that involved so that gives it a monetary value income of course is a monetary phenomenon welfare can be measured in other ways apart from income in both monetary and non-monetary ways there are lots of different ways to measure these things and they can you know be boiled down to two monetary measures or non-monetary as well what's important I think is you know to get a sense of sort of the you know the rate of the differences in the rate of change you know that are attributable to two extension and those levels and trends are what gives us a sense of performance and impact thank you thank you so much David all right so we've had a lot of questions come in some really great discussion we really really appreciate all of you who have joined us as attendees liberally sharing your questions and comments they're very helpful to the delecti who are helping to create these metrics and of course joining the DLX community of practice is one of the best ways to continue to stay informed on this topic in addition we'll be sending out an email with the recording of this webinar the powerpoints a few additional resources the chatbox transcript etc and in that email we'll be sure to communicate any essential follow-up actions from this webinar so I'd like to go ahead and wrap up the webinar and say a sincere thank you to Judy David and Kristen for your excellent presentations thank you to the aggro links team who is always wonderful and supporting and putting on these webinars and most importantly thank you to you the attendees for continuing to come to a grilling Slover",
