2
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:18,000
over the years demand for rice has been

3
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,600
growing or into increased demand for

4
00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:22,720
alternative carbohydrates and

5
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:26,240
progressive change in eating habits

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:28,320
in 2019 kenya imported rice worth 25

7
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,480
billion shillings the annual rice

8
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,880
consumption is increasing at a rate of

9
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,360
12 percent compared to four percent for

10
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,920
wheat and one percent for maize which is

11
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,680
a main step of food previously regarded

12
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,440
as an orphan crop the government

13
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:44,480
declared rice an important crop to

14
00:00:41,440 --> 00:00:46,160
supplement maize and in 2008 launched

15
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:48,399
the kenyan national rice development

16
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:50,320
strategy to double rice production in

17
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,719
the country as the demand for rice

18
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,480
increases farmers are becoming more

19
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
aware of the environment farmers like

20
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,960
dan from west corner irrigations came in

21
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,960
western kenya and gare from moya

22
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,920
irrigation scheme in eastern kenya have

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,720
been growing rise for decades initially

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,520
my father is the one who was

25
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,640
holding these farms after he was dead he

26
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,880
has died

27
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,560
i'm the one who took over from him i

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:15,920
have four acreage of

29
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:19,520
farm

30
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,759
and i'm doing rice when this

31
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,080
rise this farm was budging the

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:25,119
production of rice was the hill was very

33
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:26,799
high

34
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,000
and we

35
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,439
one acre was producing almost

36
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,520
60 to

37
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,320
70 bucks

38
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,079
but

39
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,960
nowadays

40
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,280
it goes down i've been a rice farmer for

41
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,399
quite a long time i inherited these

42
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,920
farms from

43
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,759
my father who was a the original roti

44
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:48,960
and i've grown here

45
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:50,399
since

46
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:52,479
i was young

47
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,439
and i've been doing this

48
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,520
together with my father then i took over

49
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:59,680
i've done it for several years we plan

50
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,840
to rise around august

51
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:04,240
we harvest

52
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:05,759
late november and december

53
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,759
then after that

54
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:11,200
we do what we call ratoon

55
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:13,599
latune is a when when we cut the rice

56
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:16,319
another crop sprouts and

57
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,440
we treat it just like a

58
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,160
normal

59
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:21,599
crop and then it grows we harvest then

60
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,319
after that

61
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:27,120
our farms remain idle

62
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:29,520
for quite some time before we embark on

63
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:31,200
the next cropping season these farmers

64
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:32,959
are just a sneak peek into what other

65
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,680
rice farmers have been practicing for

66
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,519
many years globally rice is known to be

67
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,920
a key contributor to greenhouse gas

68
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:41,440
emissions and climate change owing to

69
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:43,599
the large volumes of fertilizers and

70
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:46,080
water that rice requires

71
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,879
by promoting water and nutrient-use

72
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:50,959
efficiency the concept plays a critical

73
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:53,200
role in the reduction of these gases

74
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,120
towards helping combat effects of

75
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:59,680
climate change the rice sector is one of

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,959
the largest or the the fastest growing

77
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,800
agricultural sub sectors in in kenya

78
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,800
and actually across the world because in

79
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,239
terms of

80
00:03:06,800 --> 00:03:11,120
consumption

81
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:13,840
in terms of cereals actually it's almost

82
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,319
now overtaking ways here in kenya with

83
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,599
an annual growth rate of about slightly

84
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:22,000
over 12 percent per annum which is a way

85
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:23,840
beyond the consumption growth rate for

86
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,720
both the wheat

87
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:27,440
maize

88
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,360
and other cereals so you can imagine how

89
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:31,200
serious this particular commodity is

90
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,319
because even of the

91
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:34,080
import

92
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,080
import bill on

93
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,920
on rise particularly here in kenya we

94
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:39,599
are the largest importers of rise in

95
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:41,760
east africa

96
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:43,840
and therefore

97
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,799
the importance of rise

98
00:03:43,840 --> 00:03:48,640
subsector cannot be cannot be again said

99
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:50,799
and for that reason

100
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:52,959
you can imagine there's a lot of there

101
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:54,319
are a lot of efforts geared towards a

102
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:55,840
rice production

103
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,640
and sometimes

104
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:01,680
we may risk doing rise intensification

105
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:03,439
at the expense of the environment

106
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:04,560
and of course you can imagine the kind

107
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:05,840
of

108
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:07,680
the amount of

109
00:04:05,840 --> 00:04:09,519
pressure

110
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,000
rice production puts on

111
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:14,560
on the environment and of course

112
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,079
and its effect on climate because

113
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:18,400
of the

114
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:20,400
the greenhouse gases that are produced

115
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,320
within the the rice production fields

116
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:24,560
particularly methane and other

117
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,320
greenhouse gases it is on this backdrop

118
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:27,919
that kilima trust has ambassador's

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,000
journey to support the two rice grain

120
00:04:27,919 --> 00:04:31,759
regions in kenya that is eastern and

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,759
western regions for cross-learning

122
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:35,759
opportunities to introduce regenerative

123
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
agriculture through sustainable rice

124
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:40,240
cultivation rotational cropping with

125
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:42,080
leguminous crops and management of crop

126
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:44,240
waste streams the project is funded by a

127
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,240
care foundation and seeks to foster

128
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:47,680
public and private partnerships along

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:49,680
this value chain

130
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,080
the ultimate goal is to promote the use

131
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,400
of innovative technologies and generate

132
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:56,880
evidence of developed and tested

133
00:04:54,400 --> 00:04:58,560
business models for scaling up as it

134
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:59,919
also boosts farmers production

135
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:01,680
capacities

136
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:05,120
we came up with this

137
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
particular project called

138
00:05:05,120 --> 00:05:08,160
reduce

139
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:09,360
reuse

140
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,880
recycle

141
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:12,560
rice initiative

142
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,639
furthered by the ikea foundation of the

143
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:16,080
netherlands and it's geared towards

144
00:05:14,639 --> 00:05:17,840
ensuring that

145
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,400
there is increased adoption of

146
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:23,199
sustainable rice production practices

147
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,800
and also adopt regenerative or what you

148
00:05:23,199 --> 00:05:26,880
call circular economy within the

149
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,120
subsector according to research by

150
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,120
eagerton university despite my

151
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,120
irrigation scheme being more intensive

152
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,440
in comparison to western kenya the

153
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,840
yields per acre are considerably lower

154
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:40,880
but why is this a situation what is very

155
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:42,320
clearing is that

156
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,280
is more advanced

157
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,680
in the marketing market linkages

158
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,759
and the orientation of farmers to

159
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:51,360
innovations in the value chain

160
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,759
and therefore they have well organized

161
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:55,280
marketing system they have

162
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:57,120
the farmers are highly linked to

163
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:59,440
marketing processing there are several

164
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:03,360
meals up to 15 i think

165
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:06,400
as compared to aero a hero is

166
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,080
not well established in terms of the

167
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,440
western western kenya

168
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,520
in terms of the value chain and

169
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:13,440
innovations so

170
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:16,960
but the difference is that the

171
00:06:13,440 --> 00:06:18,960
productivity in western kenya is higher

172
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:21,199
so with the intensification in eastern

173
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,039
kenya where farmers don't allow the the

174
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:24,400
farm to rest

175
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:27,199
continuous

176
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:29,840
irrigated irrigated system does not

177
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:31,280
allow the soil to breed

178
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:34,080
so

179
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:36,080
continuous eboxy conditions does not

180
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,400
allow microorganisms to survive because

181
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,919
there is no oxygen for nine months in a

182
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:44,080
year so in western western west kenya

183
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:46,160
the farmers produce at least once one

184
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,280
crop plus an additional

185
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:50,000
mini crop

186
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,120
so the rest of the time is a rest period

187
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,919
for the farm

188
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:55,360
so nutrient content the soil organic

189
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,680
matter the

190
00:06:55,360 --> 00:07:00,080
the overall production system is better

191
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,000
in western kenya at the production stage

192
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,479
overuse of fertilizer in the fields has

193
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:06,479
been a challenge to address this millers

194
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:09,360
like moirai's grow as multi-purpose

195
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:11,440
cooperative society has adopted the urea

196
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,759
displacement system where nitrogenous

197
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,240
fertilizers like urea are applied in a

198
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:18,080
more efficient way on the other hand

199
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:20,479
input providers like margo enterprises

200
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,039
in western kenya can already see great

201
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:26,000
uptick of the pelleted urea by the

202
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,720
farmers the nitrogen advertiser found in

203
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,400
the market is in granule form

204
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,400
and that granule forms all those

205
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:34,800
granules are the ones which are applied

206
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:37,360
by the farmer through broadcasting so we

207
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,440
have realized the cost of applying and

208
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:40,639
the amount of waters are being applied

209
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:43,440
is too high

210
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:45,440
now through the four hour program

211
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,919
they have financed us

212
00:07:45,440 --> 00:07:49,759
to compact those granules

213
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,000
into parrots

214
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:54,319
thereby reducing

215
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,599
the amount of waterizer being applied

216
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:58,720
into the field

217
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,800
of course also reducing the cost so when

218
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:03,520
you go to apply into the chamber we

219
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:06,319
don't broadcast what we shall do we are

220
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:08,319
going to apply them deeper into the soil

221
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:09,440
through that method of urea deep

222
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:12,720
placement

223
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:14,560
this fertilizer is slow release and most

224
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:17,599
the demos that we have done is just a

225
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:19,919
one-off application after 21 days we did

226
00:08:17,599 --> 00:08:21,840
21 days and when we applied this and

227
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:24,080
it's just enough for that farmer

228
00:08:21,840 --> 00:08:25,599
for the whole production process

229
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:28,319
and with that in the directory that we

230
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:30,879
have we have increased from a production

231
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,839
to two to thirty percent

232
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:36,560
and now the adoption is really coming up

233
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:37,519
i can proudly say i've already sold up

234
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,479
to

235
00:08:37,519 --> 00:08:41,120
around

236
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:43,360
800 bags of this

237
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:45,120
and if you visit some of our farmers in

238
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,200
gonialla

239
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,720
you in west kennel

240
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:51,360
and

241
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,440
andajero will be able to find that now

242
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:56,640
they understand the use of

243
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:58,560
the pelleted urea as a way of increasing

244
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,560
rice production in addition to improved

245
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
fertilizer application the project is

246
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,640
also intensifying adoption of crop

247
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,800
rotation where farmers intercrop with

248
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,279
leguminous crops like green grams which

249
00:09:06,800 --> 00:09:11,680
are excellent for nitrogen fixation when

250
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,200
we are doing the cooperation

251
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,640
the yield starts to grow up again

252
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,240
we do

253
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,600
green grams

254
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,360
after green grams we do rice

255
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,640
when we put rice

256
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,000
when we put green grams we can even get

257
00:09:26,640 --> 00:09:31,120
more money

258
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:33,279
like the one i did myself i did i get a

259
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,720
lot of money from the green grams

260
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,040
it supported me in school fees

261
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:42,000
in hospital

262
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:43,600
even in some other things

263
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:45,920
it helped me a lot

264
00:09:43,600 --> 00:09:47,760
beyond the rice grain rice husks and

265
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,240
straws are made by products in rice

266
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,560
production the straws contain silica

267
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:54,480
which takes much longer to decompose

268
00:09:52,560 --> 00:09:56,399
leaving farmers with limited options on

269
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,120
how to utilize them they end up either

270
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:01,440
being burnt or fed to livestock despite

271
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,240
their low nutrition value to address

272
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:06,399
this the r4i csa project in partnership

273
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:08,800
with eagerton university has piloted

274
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:10,480
vermicomposting where red worms are used

275
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:12,959
to break down the straws into rich

276
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:15,120
organic manure and vermi liquid which

277
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:17,839
farmers can use on their farm or even

278
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,519
sell the straw from rice has got a lot

279
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,760
of silica

280
00:10:19,519 --> 00:10:22,959
there is a uptake of silica in the straw

281
00:10:21,760 --> 00:10:25,760
and therefore they cannot easily be

282
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,279
biodegradable the worms plays a very

283
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:29,600
important role

284
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:32,880
they introduce hydrolytic enzymes into

285
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:35,680
the straw so we mix together with the

286
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,320
organic mat organic matter from cow dung

287
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:40,320
and within a period of 60 days

288
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:41,680
all this straw now has been biodegraded

289
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:44,320
from through the

290
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,480
mechanisms of hydrolytic enzymes and

291
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:49,040
also the the red worms are very very

292
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:51,360
active they feed also on this and within

293
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:53,839
a short time

294
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:56,480
if you leave them in the farm without

295
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,959
doing family composting you will come

296
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,600
back after 90 days and you still get it

297
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,440
as hard as it is without breaking down

298
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:05,440
so that is why you see most of the rice

299
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:07,920
production systems one of the biggest

300
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:09,760
problems is what to do with the straw

301
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,399
rice husks on the other hand have been a

302
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:14,480
menace to millers for a very long time

303
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,279
they account for the bulk of waste at

304
00:11:14,480 --> 00:11:18,160
the point of milling in a period of one

305
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:20,160
month

306
00:11:18,160 --> 00:11:21,200
we are able to

307
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:24,560
mail

308
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:28,320
exactly about eight thousand kilograms

309
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:30,240
and out of eight thousand kilograms rice

310
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:32,000
ass is about

311
00:11:30,240 --> 00:11:35,600
800

312
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:38,240
kilograms we had a charge

313
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:39,680
a particularly on the space for keeping

314
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,120
this rice husk

315
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,440
because a

316
00:11:41,120 --> 00:11:46,079
250 metric tons

317
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:47,600
is much much much husk

318
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,360
and

319
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:50,800
we used to

320
00:11:49,360 --> 00:11:52,000
ban that task

321
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:54,240
initially

322
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,880
but due to the preparation growth and

323
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:58,240
the scarcity of space particularly in

324
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:00,240
moya

325
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:02,959
we don't have any space where we can

326
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:05,680
take this husk and burn

327
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:08,079
but tables are turning rice husks are

328
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:10,160
now becoming a sought after input in

329
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,920
production of diverse products from

330
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:14,079
fabrication of stoves that use rice

331
00:12:11,920 --> 00:12:16,079
husks carbonation of husks for

332
00:12:14,079 --> 00:12:17,760
production of organic fertilizer to

333
00:12:16,079 --> 00:12:20,720
reach organic material for tree

334
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:22,320
nurseries the opportunities are many we

335
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,399
started working on this innovation

336
00:12:22,320 --> 00:12:26,720
because as you when you walk around you

337
00:12:24,399 --> 00:12:27,839
find a lot of waste that are just dumped

338
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,959
outside

339
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:32,639
and uh most of you are propelled by the

340
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:34,000
amount of waste that was coming out of

341
00:12:32,639 --> 00:12:35,519
this small town

342
00:12:34,000 --> 00:12:38,320
and so we were seeing the dump site

343
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,160
which has been a very big problem even

344
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:41,040
to the government on how to dispose the

345
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:43,279
waste

346
00:12:41,040 --> 00:12:45,279
so we realized that a lot of waste that

347
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:47,600
were being disposed there

348
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,839
are combustible waste and so we're

349
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,279
thinking on a way on how we can turn

350
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,480
this waste into

351
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:55,200
um

352
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:56,639
energy and that's why we came up with

353
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:58,720
this kind of stuff

354
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,320
that then could be used to

355
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:01,120
burn that waste to

356
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:03,120
to

357
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:05,360
energy at the same time

358
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,200
help in management of those waste this

359
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,200
innovation is gradually taking shape

360
00:13:07,200 --> 00:13:12,320
with women adopting it as an alternative

361
00:13:09,200 --> 00:13:12,320
to using firewood

362
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:48,639
over 10 youth who have learned how to

363
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:50,639
add value to rice husks kilimotras has

364
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,639
helped create linkages for them with

365
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:54,959
more rice growers where they get the

366
00:13:52,639 --> 00:13:56,720
rice asks for carbonation to make

367
00:13:54,959 --> 00:13:58,240
biochar

368
00:13:56,720 --> 00:14:01,240
cream

369
00:13:58,240 --> 00:14:01,240
synthetic

370
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:15,680
ready to use for farmers as mulching

371
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,519
material but it doesn't end here

372
00:14:15,680 --> 00:14:19,680
kilimotrust has linked to awareo with

373
00:14:17,519 --> 00:14:22,639
safyorganix an organics fertilizer

374
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:25,199
manufacturer which uses the shared husks

375
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:27,199
for production of organic fertilizers

376
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:28,800
initially actually we were doing the

377
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:31,680
whole process here

378
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,160
so we will do the carbonization here but

379
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:35,199
now we realized that

380
00:14:34,160 --> 00:14:37,120
it is

381
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,120
one of the bottlenecks

382
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,240
and definitely

383
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:44,800
was taking quite a lot of time and also

384
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:48,880
limiting our capacity

385
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:50,320
so what happened is we chose

386
00:14:48,880 --> 00:14:51,600
to look for

387
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:55,040
people

388
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:58,639
to work with and people we can train

389
00:14:55,040 --> 00:14:59,760
on how to convert their rice husk into

390
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:01,760
biochar

391
00:14:59,760 --> 00:15:04,079
so and

392
00:15:01,760 --> 00:15:06,639
one of the things that happened

393
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,199
interestingly then

394
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:12,560
climate trust was also

395
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:16,000
in the picture so we brought

396
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:18,560
people like uh on board

397
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:19,839
we have about six teams that are doing

398
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,720
that for us

399
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,360
and

400
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:24,720
the good news is the these people are

401
00:15:23,360 --> 00:15:27,120
able to win

402
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:28,480
a good income

403
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:30,639
from the venture

404
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:32,639
which i would otherwise

405
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,120
they would otherwise have moved to urban

406
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,800
centers to look for jobs so we are

407
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:39,360
reducing that

408
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,399
in directory we say at sophie organics

409
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:44,480
we are employing about that youths

410
00:15:42,399 --> 00:15:46,800
locally with eastern kenya having

411
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,880
intensified value addition companies

412
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:50,399
like lake basin agritech are working

413
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,360
towards knowledge transfer in the

414
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:55,680
western region the cost of producing

415
00:15:53,360 --> 00:15:57,600
rice is too high

416
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:00,560
and most of that cost is actually taken

417
00:15:57,600 --> 00:16:02,800
by a fertilizer so this is the reason

418
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:04,399
why we decided to look for which are

419
00:16:02,800 --> 00:16:05,120
other cheaper ways

420
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:07,360
of

421
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,800
improving soil fertility in rice

422
00:16:07,360 --> 00:16:10,000
production

423
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:12,880
and

424
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:14,880
we also learned from

425
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,320
our colleagues in in

426
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:17,279
safe organics

427
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:19,040
which

428
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:22,480
was already in the field of

429
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:24,480
biochar production so our intention

430
00:16:22,480 --> 00:16:27,440
was to replicate the same

431
00:16:24,480 --> 00:16:29,440
in western kenya because we had seen the

432
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:31,920
impact that

433
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:33,759
biochar had in rice fields anywhere

434
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:35,600
already vincent and his team have

435
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:36,399
introduced biochar to tree nursery

436
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,399
owners

437
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,560
given that the charred husks can be used

438
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,240
solely on plants or into the high

439
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,040
nitrate and moisture retention

440
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,040
capabilities

443
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,480
going forward as all these interventions

444
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:06,799
take shape cross-learning opportunities

445
00:18:04,480 --> 00:18:08,720
will be critical to scaling up and

446
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:11,200
transforming rice farming to become more

447
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:13,840
sustainable given its important role in

448
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:16,160
addressing food nutrition security and

449
00:18:13,840 --> 00:18:18,559
improved incomes for all the value chain
