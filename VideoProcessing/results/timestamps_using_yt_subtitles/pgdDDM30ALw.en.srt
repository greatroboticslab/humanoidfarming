1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,009
I want to thank everybody we just hit

2
00:00:02,449 --> 00:00:08,160
17,000 subscribers the other day

3
00:00:05,009 --> 00:00:10,200
thanks modern standards good morning

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,530
modern standards we've got probably at

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:16,800
least inches of snow yesterday and last

6
00:00:13,530 --> 00:00:19,529
night it's crazy it's cold out this

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:21,689
morning they're calling for today and

8
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,810
tomorrow to be negative 40 with the

9
00:00:21,689 --> 00:00:28,439
windchill it's gonna be cold let's make

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,730
sure all the animals have extra hay well

11
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:32,399
we were getting a lot of questions about

12
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:34,649
how does our outdoor green house hold up

13
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,750
with all the snow and what do you need

14
00:00:34,649 --> 00:00:38,460
to do this morning before I clean up the

15
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:42,829
winter chicken coop I thought I'd show

16
00:00:38,460 --> 00:00:42,829
you how I do it what works well for us

17
00:00:55,840 --> 00:00:59,009
[Applause]

18
00:01:04,660 --> 00:01:07,840
[Applause]

19
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:14,530
they love the fresh hay this time of the

20
00:01:12,430 --> 00:01:28,090
year especially go Peck through and eat

21
00:01:14,530 --> 00:01:29,800
all the grain to help encourage that we

22
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:32,140
don't like to have electricity out

23
00:01:29,800 --> 00:01:36,159
running to our coops so what we really

24
00:01:32,140 --> 00:01:39,340
like using on these rubber water buckets

25
00:01:36,159 --> 00:01:41,880
mat troughs whatever you want to call

26
00:01:39,340 --> 00:02:01,840
them and they get frozen flip them over

27
00:01:41,880 --> 00:02:03,939
step on them well nice and clean the

28
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,640
snow on the greenhouse it's pretty dark

29
00:02:03,939 --> 00:02:09,399
in here too what I use to clean off the

30
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:12,160
greenhouse whatever I have in my hand

31
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:13,959
you have a push from that works good

32
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,290
you have your feed bucket that works

33
00:02:13,959 --> 00:02:16,290
good

34
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:49,360
easy peasy just like that it lets so

35
00:02:46,989 --> 00:02:51,010
much more light in but keep the snow off

36
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,129
of it and we don't have to worry about

37
00:02:51,010 --> 00:02:58,230
the greenhouse collapsing off and the

38
00:02:54,129 --> 00:02:58,230
chickens really like the extra light

39
00:03:06,190 --> 00:03:10,670
one of the other really good benefits

40
00:03:08,150 --> 00:03:12,680
about doing this is and piles up the

41
00:03:10,670 --> 00:03:15,110
snow along the side of the winter

42
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,780
chicken coop slash greenhouse and it

43
00:03:15,110 --> 00:03:20,390
helps keep out the drafts it seals it up

44
00:03:17,780 --> 00:03:24,290
believe it or not snow is a very good

45
00:03:20,390 --> 00:03:26,959
insulator believe for every inch of snow

46
00:03:24,290 --> 00:03:31,069
you get one hour value so that's pretty

47
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,819
good so the heat can go up the top which

48
00:03:31,069 --> 00:03:33,290
is fine

49
00:03:31,819 --> 00:03:35,870
but if we can keep a lot of the drafts

50
00:03:33,290 --> 00:03:38,930
out on the sides for the animals it's

51
00:03:35,870 --> 00:03:41,510
great you don't want it airtight because

52
00:03:38,930 --> 00:03:43,040
your animals need fresh air circulating

53
00:03:41,510 --> 00:03:45,500
you couldn't have your animals in a barn

54
00:03:43,040 --> 00:03:47,720
a heated barn that's not good for them

55
00:03:45,500 --> 00:03:48,950
you want to have them out of the

56
00:03:47,720 --> 00:03:50,660
elements the biggest things you want

57
00:03:48,950 --> 00:03:52,489
keep my little wind and they want to

58
00:03:50,660 --> 00:03:56,959
have a place room to go and get in from

59
00:03:52,489 --> 00:03:59,120
the wind in the walk rain or water but

60
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,470
the elements the cold is still good for

61
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,200
them you just want to have an a draft

62
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:05,989
free area it's kind of weird like we

63
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,400
want to go inside in a warm house I'm

64
00:04:05,989 --> 00:04:09,769
sure the animals would love to do it but

65
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:13,220
it's not healthy for them so we got to

66
00:04:09,769 --> 00:04:15,109
remember that we're not animals don't

67
00:04:13,220 --> 00:04:17,389
react to this weather the same way we do

68
00:04:15,109 --> 00:04:21,109
the more they're out in it the better it

69
00:04:17,389 --> 00:04:23,450
is formed especially the more natural it

70
00:04:21,109 --> 00:04:25,460
is like our pigs are getting a huge

71
00:04:23,450 --> 00:04:27,289
winter coat on them so that's keeping

72
00:04:25,460 --> 00:04:29,060
them warm yesterday when I was out

73
00:04:27,289 --> 00:04:32,600
feeding them in the afternoon it was

74
00:04:29,060 --> 00:04:35,150
snow no good but all the snow was melted

75
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:37,610
off them they will wet sweating and then

76
00:04:35,150 --> 00:04:39,410
they can go inside there too hey going

77
00:04:37,610 --> 00:04:42,110
there they can dry off they can get warm

78
00:04:39,410 --> 00:04:43,729
they can go back in and out this weather

79
00:04:42,110 --> 00:04:45,979
doesn't bother them they're getting

80
00:04:43,729 --> 00:04:48,139
acclimated to it they do it really good

81
00:04:45,979 --> 00:04:49,639
speaking of that let's go check on the

82
00:04:48,139 --> 00:04:51,910
pigs and see how they like and all the

83
00:04:49,639 --> 00:04:51,910
snow

84
00:04:53,900 --> 00:04:57,000
[Applause]

85
00:04:57,380 --> 00:05:03,840
guess we gotta pack our trail down if it

86
00:05:02,460 --> 00:05:06,870
ever warmed up we can do some

87
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:10,380
snowshoeing it's gonna be way too cold

88
00:05:06,870 --> 00:05:12,300
this weekend to get under this tree

89
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,600
keeps getting narrower and narrower

90
00:05:12,300 --> 00:05:18,090
we gotta keep ducking I think it's

91
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,560
between the snow buildup and the tree

92
00:05:18,090 --> 00:05:31,880
get him weighted down from all the snow

93
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:31,880
they've been out and about good morning

94
00:05:33,320 --> 00:05:40,610
what are you girls thinking of snow oh

95
00:05:36,470 --> 00:05:40,610
you know what that means huh

96
00:05:55,760 --> 00:06:10,040
I don't know if that noise will ever get

97
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:12,020
old they definitely are eating a lot

98
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:13,940
more which is a good thing I want to see

99
00:06:12,020 --> 00:06:16,460
him eating that means they're staying

100
00:06:13,940 --> 00:06:18,500
warm if we need to go through an extra

101
00:06:16,460 --> 00:06:21,860
couple of bags of feed to keep them warm

102
00:06:18,500 --> 00:06:24,260
it's worth it later on today I'll bring

103
00:06:21,860 --> 00:06:25,730
them out a fresh bill of hay went to the

104
00:06:24,260 --> 00:06:27,560
feed store the other day and I picked up

105
00:06:25,730 --> 00:06:29,120
a few extra be able to hay because I

106
00:06:27,560 --> 00:06:30,590
knew it was gonna be cold out this

107
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:33,500
coming week and weekend

108
00:06:30,590 --> 00:06:38,660
it's banked up nice all around the sides

109
00:06:33,500 --> 00:06:41,990
of the greenhouse what do you think of

110
00:06:38,660 --> 00:06:45,140
all this snow okay the day off yesterday

111
00:06:41,990 --> 00:06:48,350
in a two-hour delay today and this is

112
00:06:45,140 --> 00:06:52,340
just the week back from winter break you

113
00:06:48,350 --> 00:06:58,220
get a whole nother break I was hoping

114
00:06:52,340 --> 00:07:02,180
today to start building our large soil

115
00:06:58,220 --> 00:07:05,480
block maker that our medium-sized soil

116
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:08,000
blocks will fit into but with all this

117
00:07:05,480 --> 00:07:10,160
cold coming and snow we got we're gonna

118
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,230
switch gears we have some Quonset tents

119
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,780
or tent sheds we got to clean those off

120
00:07:12,230 --> 00:07:16,850
otherwise they're gonna collapse and we

121
00:07:14,780 --> 00:07:19,070
need to get more firewood in the house

122
00:07:16,850 --> 00:07:21,410
tomorrow today it's supposed to start

123
00:07:19,070 --> 00:07:23,060
supposed to be like 40 below zero with

124
00:07:21,410 --> 00:07:25,820
the windchill we're gonna be going

125
00:07:23,060 --> 00:07:28,010
through some firewood so we've already

126
00:07:25,820 --> 00:07:30,770
gone through quite a bit this week has

127
00:07:28,010 --> 00:07:32,300
been so darn cold that pile is brought

128
00:07:30,770 --> 00:07:36,350
up to the window we had another one in

129
00:07:32,300 --> 00:07:38,830
front of it clean this up and get some

130
00:07:36,350 --> 00:07:38,830
more wooden

131
00:07:41,930 --> 00:07:43,930
ah

132
00:07:51,190 --> 00:07:58,850
[Music]

133
00:08:08,999 --> 00:08:16,199
the aprons dry in nicely my went a

134
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:20,399
little overboard I want to have like an

135
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:22,860
heirloom quality apron that I know will

136
00:08:20,399 --> 00:08:25,079
handle my abuse that I can do anything

137
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:27,209
with it and I have to worry about it and

138
00:08:25,079 --> 00:08:30,110
it just gets better and better with aids

139
00:08:27,209 --> 00:08:33,149
like it gets more patina to it no last

140
00:08:30,110 --> 00:08:35,279
that's what I like to do stuff that's

141
00:08:33,149 --> 00:08:38,789
kind of my thought pattern now if we

142
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:42,269
built the house the use of all wood wood

143
00:08:38,789 --> 00:08:45,240
floor wood walls with squid siding metal

144
00:08:42,269 --> 00:08:48,269
roof like something's gonna happen to it

145
00:08:45,240 --> 00:08:50,220
if we have used it or it gets beaten up

146
00:08:48,269 --> 00:08:53,399
a little bit I want to look nicer with

147
00:08:50,220 --> 00:08:56,459
age the outdoor kitchen all rough sawn

148
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:58,199
lumber it's just the older it gets the

149
00:08:56,459 --> 00:09:00,750
more character it's gonna get the more

150
00:08:58,199 --> 00:09:04,110
age is gonna have now with our new day

151
00:09:00,750 --> 00:09:07,050
modern plastic world the older it gets

152
00:09:04,110 --> 00:09:09,180
the crafty or it gets it throw it away

153
00:09:07,050 --> 00:09:12,540
and get some new stuff what are they

154
00:09:09,180 --> 00:09:16,290
saying vinyls final it's not wood is

155
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:20,160
final just don't paint it oil your oil

156
00:09:16,290 --> 00:09:23,699
stuff it last like the outside of our

157
00:09:20,160 --> 00:09:25,680
house we've oiled the siding and if we

158
00:09:23,699 --> 00:09:27,839
have to redo it we don't have to scrape

159
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:31,170
it and paint it we can power wash it let

160
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:32,879
it dry and reel it easy-peasy and

161
00:09:31,170 --> 00:09:36,089
they'll just keep adding to the richness

162
00:09:32,879 --> 00:09:37,079
and the beauty over time and that's what

163
00:09:36,089 --> 00:09:40,860
I'm hoping for

164
00:09:37,079 --> 00:09:43,709
with the leather apron it's probably

165
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:46,529
half of it's probably completely dry so

166
00:09:43,709 --> 00:09:48,720
I'm excited I can't wait to start using

167
00:09:46,529 --> 00:09:51,540
it I'll be using it in the intensive

168
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,370
three-day pasture to plate class we're

169
00:09:51,540 --> 00:09:55,649
going to be putting on here in April

170
00:09:53,370 --> 00:09:56,779
with the pigs on us it's gonna be

171
00:09:55,649 --> 00:09:59,370
exciting

172
00:09:56,779 --> 00:10:01,559
all right enough staying warm by the

173
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:02,750
fire we got to get outside and get some

174
00:10:01,559 --> 00:10:05,189
stuff done

175
00:10:02,750 --> 00:10:09,209
judo doesn't look like she wants to come

176
00:10:05,189 --> 00:10:11,610
out but I bet as soon as we get ready to

177
00:10:09,209 --> 00:10:14,350
go out we asked should we write out the

178
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:17,200
door with us jumping around no

179
00:10:14,350 --> 00:10:21,000
come back in July by the wood stove and

180
00:10:17,200 --> 00:10:21,000
melt the snow off of her

181
00:10:30,259 --> 00:10:43,760
you ready to go out

182
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:43,760
[Music]

183
00:10:44,580 --> 00:10:59,700
