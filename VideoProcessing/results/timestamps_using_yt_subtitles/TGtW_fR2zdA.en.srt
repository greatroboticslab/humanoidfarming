1
00:00:00,280 --> 00:00:04,720
have you ever wondered what makes Amish

2
00:00:02,080 --> 00:00:06,480
life so unique today I'll take you

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:08,719
inside their world feeding chickens

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,040
grains all day is like giving a teenager

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,400
nothing but chips and sood easy but far

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,240
from my deal I used to feed my chickens

7
00:00:13,400 --> 00:00:17,439
grains because the feed store convinced

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:20,480
me and the bag had a picture of a Happy

9
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:22,840
Hen I figured why not but my chickens

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:24,519
weren't thrilled they ate some but spent

11
00:00:22,840 --> 00:00:27,080
most of the day scattering it around

12
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:29,160
like confetti egg production barely

13
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:31,800
average it felt like I was paying a

14
00:00:29,160 --> 00:00:34,040
premium for junk food grains are a go to

15
00:00:31,800 --> 00:00:35,879
for most chicken owners much like people

16
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:38,040
once believed bloodletting cured

17
00:00:35,879 --> 00:00:39,960
everything it's just something people

18
00:00:38,040 --> 00:00:41,920
did even though it wasn't the best

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,120
option but the Amish do things

20
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,480
differently forget expensive bags of

21
00:00:44,120 --> 00:00:47,039
grain they managed to feed their

22
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,680
chickens for just

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,239
$125 a week honestly I've spent more

24
00:00:50,680 --> 00:00:55,039
than that on a single bad coffee maybe

25
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:57,760
you're thinking but my chickens love

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:01:00,280
grains of course they do just like kids

27
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:02,199
love candy chickens are omnivores

28
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:05,159
they're designed to scratch for bugs

29
00:01:02,199 --> 00:01:06,920
plants and whatever else they can find

30
00:01:05,159 --> 00:01:10,080
grains are just a small part of their

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,320
natural diet feeding them only grains is

32
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,560
like making them sit on a couch watching

33
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:18,040
TV all day fun at first but not healthy

34
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,119
longterm switching to the Amish method

35
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,680
wasn't just about saving money though

36
00:01:20,119 --> 00:01:25,320
that was a nice perk my chickens became

37
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,880
healthier more active and started laying

38
00:01:25,320 --> 00:01:30,439
better eggs it was like upgrading their

39
00:01:27,880 --> 00:01:32,320
diet from fast food to Gourmet Plus plus

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,840
I wasn't constantly running to buy more

41
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,920
grain every 2 weeks did you know that

42
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:39,920
wild chickens eat more bugs and seeds

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:42,560
than grains they need variety and when

44
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:46,000
they get it they Thrive grains that's

45
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:48,960
just filler at first I thought the $1

46
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,840
and 25 cents a week claim sounded to

47
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,600
good to be true but after a few weeks

48
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,840
the results were clear healthier

49
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:59,600
chickens a happier wallet and less mess

50
00:01:56,840 --> 00:02:01,799
from scattered grain it was a win-win

51
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,079
one you see how well this works it's

52
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:05,680
hard to go back to the old ways when I

53
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:07,000
first heard the Amish could feed their

54
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,479
chickens for

55
00:02:07,000 --> 00:02:12,560
$125 a week I thought I'd M her I was

56
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,599
spending way more on grain and my

57
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,400
chickens weren't exactly rewarding me

58
00:02:14,599 --> 00:02:19,480
with extra eggs I had to see for myself

59
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:21,480
what the Amish were doing differently

60
00:02:19,480 --> 00:02:24,400
that's how I ended up visiting an Amish

61
00:02:21,480 --> 00:02:26,440
farm honestly I expected them to pull

62
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:29,440
out some old-fashioned farming Gadget

63
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:31,080
like a hand cranked grain grinder but no

64
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,519
they didn't seem to have any special

65
00:02:31,080 --> 00:02:35,480
tools the Amish have a knack for making

66
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,959
everything look simple and their chicken

67
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,840
feeding system was no exception while I

68
00:02:37,959 --> 00:02:42,000
was lugging heavy bags of grain and

69
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:44,040
scooping out portions like a cafeteria

70
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,640
worker they were tossing out kitchen

71
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:49,159
scraps letting their chickens forage and

72
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:51,760
using fermented feed their chickens were

73
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:54,360
running around pecking at bugs plants

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:56,400
and kitchen leftovers I couldn't believe

75
00:02:54,360 --> 00:02:58,280
how much easier their system was it was

76
00:02:56,400 --> 00:03:00,280
like watching someone effortlessly cook

77
00:02:58,280 --> 00:03:03,360
a gmet meal while you struggle with

78
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:06,200
microwave popcorn about that

79
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:08,159
$125 cost I thought it couldn't be real

80
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:10,519
I did the math assuming they had to be

81
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:13,120
leaving something out but no their

82
00:03:10,519 --> 00:03:15,640
method was incredibly costeffective

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:18,159
meanwhile I was spending a small fortune

84
00:03:15,640 --> 00:03:20,400
on grain my chickens barely liked the

85
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:23,000
Amish succeed By ignoring the grain hype

86
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,879
that feed companies push instead they

87
00:03:23,000 --> 00:03:27,599
use things that would otherwise go to

88
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:30,439
waste vegetable peels stale bread and

89
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:32,360
leftover salad it's like they created a

90
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:35,040
sustainable farm twoot table Chicken

91
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,560
buffet minus the fancy Vibe what amazed

92
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:39,280
me most was how natural it all felt

93
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:41,599
there chickens were free to forage

94
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,360
finding bugs and plants while the

95
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,319
fermented feed extended their food

96
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,200
supply I'd never heard of feeding

97
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:48,760
chickens fermented food but these

98
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:51,360
chickens loved it it was like a

99
00:03:48,760 --> 00:03:53,200
five-star meal for them the process was

100
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,040
so simple it felt almost to good to be

101
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,599
true but it made perfect sense the Amish

102
00:03:56,040 --> 00:03:59,840
have been doing things their way for

103
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:02,280
Generations no gadgets no flashy

104
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,560
marketing and definitely no overpriced

105
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,720
grain bags yet their chickens were

106
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,239
thriving so what do the Amish feed their

107
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,599
chickens if not grains when I asked I

108
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:14,319
half expected some secret ingredient but

109
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,680
there was no mystery they rely on Common

110
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:19,560
Sense and scraps most people throw away

111
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:21,199
kitchen leftovers fermented feed and

112
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:23,400
whatever the chickens can find while

113
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:26,160
foraging I thought the secret would be

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,720
something unusual like magic beans but

115
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:31,039
no there's no mystery here the Amish

116
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,600
rely on good old fashion practicality

117
00:04:31,039 --> 00:04:34,520
and a combination of things you'd

118
00:04:32,600 --> 00:04:36,240
usually throw away without a second

119
00:04:34,520 --> 00:04:38,919
thought we're talking about kitchen

120
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:41,840
scraps fermented feed and whatever

121
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,479
chickens can scavenge it's not fancy but

122
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,919
it works and at just

123
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:49,080
$125 a week I'm not complaining let's

124
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,160
start with kitchen scraps if you're like

125
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:54,520
me you probably dislike wasting food you

126
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,120
cook dinner end up with some peels or a

127
00:04:54,520 --> 00:05:00,039
few stale bread slices and into the

128
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,280
trash they go but not the Amish they've

129
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:05,639
turned feeding chickens into a recycling

130
00:05:02,280 --> 00:05:07,440
Masterpiece veggie peels leftover salad

131
00:05:05,639 --> 00:05:10,039
and rock hard bread become chicken

132
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,600
delices for chickens it's as good as

133
00:05:10,039 --> 00:05:14,600
fresh baked croissants the Amish have

134
00:05:12,600 --> 00:05:16,600
mastered turning food waste into a

135
00:05:14,600 --> 00:05:19,120
Powerhouse for egg production then

136
00:05:16,600 --> 00:05:20,960
there's fermented feed at first I

137
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,840
imagined some odd science project with

138
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:26,520
jars bubbling away and strange smells in

139
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:28,639
reality it's much simpler fermented feed

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:32,199
is just ordinary feed like cracked

141
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:34,639
grains so in water until it ferments the

142
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:36,440
fermentation process introduces healthy

143
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,039
bacteria that improve the chicken's

144
00:05:36,440 --> 00:05:42,080
digestion much like how yogurt benefits

145
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:44,080
us plus the feed swells as it ferments

146
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,240
meaning less feed is needed to satisfy

147
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:48,720
the chickens foraging is where things

148
00:05:46,240 --> 00:05:50,759
get really interesting chickens are

149
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:53,440
natural scavengers they love scratching

150
00:05:50,759 --> 00:05:55,680
around for bugs warms and whatever they

151
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:57,960
can find in the dirt you've probably

152
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,319
seen them do this countless times but

153
00:05:57,960 --> 00:06:01,840
have you ever thought about what they're

154
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,360
actually ually after bugs of course

155
00:06:01,840 --> 00:06:06,000
chickens are like tiny feathered

156
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:08,080
dinosaurs with an instinct to hunt when

157
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:10,800
they forage they're getting protein from

158
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:12,919
insects and the best part it costs

159
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,319
nothing bugs are completely free you

160
00:06:12,919 --> 00:06:17,800
might think really bugs and scraps

161
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:20,080
that's it and yes it sounds almost to

162
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:22,360
simple but that's the beauty of it

163
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:24,560
chickens aren't picky they'll eat just

164
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:26,759
about anything you give them when you

165
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,599
combine the right scraps with foraging

166
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:30,039
they Thrive this approach leads to

167
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,880
healthier chickens and healthier

168
00:06:30,039 --> 00:06:35,039
chickens lay better eggs think about it

169
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:37,400
if you ate the same meal every day you'd

170
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,759
get bored too by giving chickens a mix

171
00:06:37,400 --> 00:06:42,199
of scraps and the chance to forage the

172
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:45,280
Amish create a more natural and diverse

173
00:06:42,199 --> 00:06:47,199
diet for their Birds the result happier

174
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
healthier chickens and fewer trips to

175
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,199
the feed store saving you money in the

176
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,680
process the next time you throw away

177
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,280
potato peels or a half eaten sandwich

178
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:58,120
remember that you're tossing out free

179
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:00,440
chicken feed Meanwhile your chickens

180
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:02,800
could be foraging for VMS living their

181
00:07:00,440 --> 00:07:05,240
best lives and giving you high quality

182
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,160
eggs in return transitioning chickens

183
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,280
from a grain-based diet to this Amish

184
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:11,840
style approaches like swapping fast food

185
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:13,800
for gourmet home-cooked meals you

186
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:16,240
wouldn't want to live on junk food every

187
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:18,840
day and neither do your chickens the

188
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:21,240
change is obvious almost immediately the

189
00:07:18,840 --> 00:07:22,560
first thing you'll notice is the eggs

190
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:24,240
the difference between eggs from

191
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
grain-fed chickens and those on this

192
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,840
nutrient trich diet is like comparing

193
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,919
fast food to a homemade Feast the eggs

194
00:07:28,840 --> 00:07:33,080
have a richer color color better flavor

195
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,120
and more nutrients I'll never forget

196
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:37,840
cracking my first egg after switching my

197
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:39,759
chicken's diet the yolk was so vibrantly

198
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,080
oranged that it seemed magical but it

199
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,000
was just the result of better nutrition

200
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:46,280
the combination of foraged bugs

201
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:48,440
fermented feed and kitchen scraps

202
00:07:46,280 --> 00:07:51,240
creates a nutrient packed diet which

203
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:53,599
leads to Superior egg quality studies

204
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:55,639
confirm it chickens on a varied and

205
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:57,960
nutrient Rich diet produce eggs with

206
00:07:55,639 --> 00:07:59,720
higher levels of vitamins feeding your

207
00:07:57,960 --> 00:08:02,479
chickens this way is like giving them

208
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:05,000
fresh organic local ingredients instead

209
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:07,599
of cheap mass produced filler it's

210
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:10,520
better for them and better for you

211
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:12,879
vitamins like a ande plus omega-3 South

212
00:08:10,520 --> 00:08:14,159
are a GameChanger these nutrients make

213
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,639
you feel like you're getting your

214
00:08:14,159 --> 00:08:18,520
money's worth at the store but it's not

215
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,000
just the eggs that benefit the chickens

216
00:08:18,520 --> 00:08:22,039
themselves look and feel like they've

217
00:08:20,000 --> 00:08:23,960
just come back from a spar Retreat their

218
00:08:22,039 --> 00:08:26,319
feathers become shinier they stop

219
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:28,759
shedding so much and their overall Vibe

220
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:30,520
shifts from just surviving to thriving

221
00:08:28,759 --> 00:08:33,039
it's as if they're auditioning for some

222
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:35,200
kind of chicken reality show honestly

223
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:38,159
they even seem happier if chickens could

224
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:40,120
smile mine would be grinning ear to air

225
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,640
their health improves too which means

226
00:08:40,120 --> 00:08:45,120
fewer illnesses and thankfully fewer

227
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:46,959
trips to the vet let's be real giving

228
00:08:45,120 --> 00:08:48,920
medicine to a chicken is like trying to

229
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:51,440
bathe a cat but with feathers and way

230
00:08:48,920 --> 00:08:54,120
more noise Since switching to the Amish

231
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,320
method sick days have become rare the

232
00:08:54,120 --> 00:08:58,279
chickens are tougher healthier and

233
00:08:56,320 --> 00:09:00,240
handle challenges like bad weather or

234
00:08:58,279 --> 00:09:01,880
stray dogs much better

235
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,279
it's as if they've been training for the

236
00:09:01,880 --> 00:09:06,680
chicken Olympics and the Amish diet is

237
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:09,320
their secret weapon egg production also

238
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:12,279
gets a noticeable boost my hens used to

239
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:14,680
legs sure but not as consistently as

240
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,680
they do now grain heavy diets weighed

241
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:19,680
them down much like car bloating before

242
00:09:16,680 --> 00:09:21,480
a race chickens may not run marathons

243
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,760
but the Amish diet makes them lighter

244
00:09:21,480 --> 00:09:25,680
and more energetic the difference was

245
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,320
clear I didn't need a spreadsheet to see

246
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,079
the Improvement a full egg carton every

247
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:31,880
week was proof enough

248
00:09:30,079 --> 00:09:34,320
I started feeling like I had cracked the

249
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,600
Cat my chickens were healthier laying

250
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:39,640
more eggs and I was spending Less on

251
00:09:36,600 --> 00:09:41,720
feed Meanwhile my neighbors kept buying

252
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:44,360
pricey grain that didn't deliver half as

253
00:09:41,720 --> 00:09:47,000
much it's like discovering that a $5

254
00:09:44,360 --> 00:09:49,440
Burger tastes just as good if not better

255
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:52,640
than the $20 version from a fancy

256
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:54,920
restaurant and here's a bonus less waste

257
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,399
Yes you heard that right grain heavy

258
00:09:54,920 --> 00:09:59,720
diets produce more chicken poop because

259
00:09:57,399 --> 00:10:02,680
surprise chickens aren't designed to eat

260
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:04,640
grains all day with the Amish diet their

261
00:10:02,680 --> 00:10:06,760
food is used more efficiently meaning

262
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:08,920
fewer messes for you to clean if you've

263
00:10:06,760 --> 00:10:11,480
ever had to rake a chicken yard you'll

264
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:13,839
know what a huge win this is after my

265
00:10:11,480 --> 00:10:15,959
chickens adjusted to the new diet I felt

266
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,519
like I'd unlocked a secret formula for

267
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:20,839
keeping chickens more eggs healthier

268
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:23,519
birds and fewer vet bills it almost felt

269
00:10:20,839 --> 00:10:26,040
to good to be true before this I thought

270
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:28,399
feeding chickens would cost me a fortune

271
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,959
you know the feeling walking into a feed

272
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:32,560
store grab grabbing a bag of grain and

273
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:34,920
wondering if you're feeding chickens or

274
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,800
a herd of cattle and it wasn't just the

275
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:39,040
cost there was always that nagging

276
00:10:36,800 --> 00:10:42,000
question is this really the best way to

277
00:10:39,040 --> 00:10:44,200
do it well now I can confidently say

278
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:46,440
there's a better cheaper alternative

279
00:10:44,200 --> 00:10:48,639
let's talk about the grain if you're

280
00:10:46,440 --> 00:10:50,920
like me you're probably spending a small

281
00:10:48,639 --> 00:10:53,680
fortune on chicken feed those bags

282
00:10:50,920 --> 00:10:56,639
disappear faster than socks in a dryer

283
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,720
the Amish method on the other hand costs

284
00:10:56,639 --> 00:11:00,760
about the same as a cup of fancy coffee

285
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,120
per week just

286
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:05,279
$125 that's way less than I used to

287
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:07,760
spend on overpriced feed mixes that

288
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:10,079
promised Miracles but didn't deliver the

289
00:11:07,760 --> 00:11:12,279
savings are real but the real game Cher

290
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:14,800
is how stressfree this method is back

291
00:11:12,279 --> 00:11:17,200
when I relied on grain I was stuck in an

292
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:19,800
endless cycle of buying hauling and

293
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,560
storing bags of feed those bags are

294
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:23,560
deceptively heavy lugging them around

295
00:11:21,560 --> 00:11:26,079
feels like unintentional strength

296
00:11:23,560 --> 00:11:28,760
training plus storing them turn my

297
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,120
garage into a critter magnet now instead

298
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:33,040
of over price chicken food I feed my

299
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
flock with scraps from my kitchen and

300
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:37,120
let them forage in the yard fermenting

301
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,680
their feet is so easy it almost feels

302
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:41,639
like cheating it's also a relief not to

303
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:43,480
deal with picky chickens anymore if

304
00:11:41,639 --> 00:11:45,680
you've ever shelled out for premium feed

305
00:11:43,480 --> 00:11:48,200
only for your chickens to reject it you

306
00:11:45,680 --> 00:11:49,920
know how frustrating it is switching to

307
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:52,320
the Amish diet put an end to those

308
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:54,600
judgmental chicken stairs my chickens

309
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:56,440
are happier Scavenging bugs and enjoying

310
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,399
fermented feed than they ever were with

311
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:00,800
grains they eat with the kind of

312
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:03,399
enthusiasm you expect on pizza night

313
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,320
which is satisfying to watch plus the

314
00:12:03,399 --> 00:12:07,399
money I save on feed could easily go

315
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:09,480
toward a Netflix subscription or some

316
00:12:07,399 --> 00:12:11,200
snacks to enjoy while watching it I

317
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:13,000
accidentally ended up in a strength

318
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,720
training class thanks to lugging heavy

319
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:17,880
feed bags not to mention the chaos in my

320
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,480
garage with stacks of feed inviting

321
00:12:17,880 --> 00:12:21,760
every Critter in the neighborhood for a

322
00:12:19,480 --> 00:12:24,040
feast but now instead of hauling

323
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,000
overpriced chicken feed I use kitchen

324
00:12:24,040 --> 00:12:28,760
scraps and let my chickens forage in the

325
00:12:26,000 --> 00:12:31,720
yard fermented feed is so easy to make

326
00:12:28,760 --> 00:12:34,079
it feels feels like I'm cheating oh and

327
00:12:31,720 --> 00:12:35,920
let's talk sanity there's nothing worse

328
00:12:34,079 --> 00:12:37,800
than chickens turning their beaks up at

329
00:12:35,920 --> 00:12:39,839
premium feed you know the feeling

330
00:12:37,800 --> 00:12:42,040
spending money on top tier food only for

331
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,880
them to act like it's beneath them

332
00:12:42,040 --> 00:12:46,480
switching to the Amish method ended

333
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,199
those judgmental chicken looks now they

334
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,600
happily hunt for bugs and devour

335
00:12:48,199 --> 00:12:53,240
fermented feed my chickens eat with the

336
00:12:50,600 --> 00:12:55,760
enthusiasm of kids on pizza night which

337
00:12:53,240 --> 00:12:57,639
is satisfying to watch and if you're

338
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,320
hesitant think of the money saved enough

339
00:12:57,639 --> 00:13:03,240
to finally afford that Flix subscription

340
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:05,480
or some snacks plus healthier chickens

341
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:07,519
mean fewer vet visits saving you even

342
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,240
more I used to think chickens were low

343
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,839
maintenance until I was hit with vet

344
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:14,000
bills that could have been avoided with

345
00:13:10,839 --> 00:13:15,920
a better diet Since switching emergency

346
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:19,440
chicken care is practically a thing of

347
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:21,600
the past less stress fewer expenses and

348
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:23,399
healthier chickens it's a win all around

349
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,680
if you're tired of wasting money on feed

350
00:13:23,399 --> 00:13:28,079
your chickens barely touch this method

351
00:13:25,680 --> 00:13:30,320
is a lifesaver it's better for your

352
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,199
wallet better for for your chickens and

353
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:34,720
better for your peace of mind you'll

354
00:13:32,199 --> 00:13:36,480
laugh at how simple and affordable it is

355
00:13:34,720 --> 00:13:39,680
and both you and your chickens will be

356
00:13:36,480 --> 00:13:42,240
grateful for the change now you might be

357
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,800
wondering if this method is complicated

358
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:45,800
I thought the same it seemed too good to

359
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,720
be true like those Furniture

360
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:50,720
instructions that leave you questioning

361
00:13:47,720 --> 00:13:52,399
your life choices but to my surprise the

362
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:55,480
Amish way of feeding chickens is

363
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:57,360
ridiculously simple honestly it's easier

364
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,360
than making toast especially since I've

365
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:01,959
burned toast more times than I'd like to

366
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:04,440
admit yet I haven't messed up the

367
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:06,600
chicken feed once just take kitchen

368
00:14:04,440 --> 00:14:09,199
scraps let them ferment a bit knot full

369
00:14:06,600 --> 00:14:10,920
on sourkraut level mixed with water and

370
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:13,519
you're done your chickens are

371
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:15,399
essentially getting a homemade meal at

372
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:17,839
first I thought this method would

373
00:14:15,399 --> 00:14:20,320
require extra effort and as someone who

374
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:22,839
barely functions before coffee I wasn't

375
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:24,720
thrilled but the best part once you get

376
00:14:22,839 --> 00:14:27,839
into the habit of saving scraps and

377
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:30,440
prepping feed it practically runs itself

378
00:14:27,839 --> 00:14:32,920
now even on busy mornings this routine

379
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:35,079
feels effortless instead of dragging

380
00:14:32,920 --> 00:14:37,279
around heavy grain bags I give my

381
00:14:35,079 --> 00:14:39,199
chickens leftovers from the fridge and

382
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:40,920
they love it it's also a great way to

383
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:43,079
make use of scraps that would have gone

384
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:45,160
to waste if there's one thing I've

385
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:47,279
learned it's that we tend to over

386
00:14:45,160 --> 00:14:49,680
complicate things the Amish have

387
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:51,880
mastered the art of Simplicity I

388
00:14:49,680 --> 00:14:54,399
expected this change to take time but

389
00:14:51,880 --> 00:14:56,399
it's been surprisingly easy no fancy

390
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,160
equipment no complex systems just

391
00:14:56,399 --> 00:15:00,880
straightforward old-fashioned

392
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:03,079
practicality this is as low maintenance

393
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,600
as it gets and coming from someone who

394
00:15:03,079 --> 00:15:07,880
hits sze six times every morning that's

395
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:09,680
saying something if you're wondering

396
00:15:07,880 --> 00:15:12,320
whether you're capable of doing this

397
00:15:09,680 --> 00:15:14,199
trust me you absolutely are it's not

398
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:15,399
about being an expert it's about

399
00:15:14,199 --> 00:15:17,040
understanding that sometimes the

400
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,000
simplest approaches are the most

401
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:23,320
effective plus you'll save yourself time

402
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,399
money and mental energy after all if you

403
00:15:23,320 --> 00:15:27,639
can make a sandwich you already have the

404
00:15:25,399 --> 00:15:29,199
skills to feed your chickens and if you

405
00:15:27,639 --> 00:15:31,000
figured out how to reheat pizza so

406
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:33,800
without burning it you're basically a

407
00:15:31,000 --> 00:15:35,759
pro now let's dive into what this

408
00:15:33,800 --> 00:15:38,120
grain-free experiment really does for

409
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,959
your chickens over time think of it like

410
00:15:38,120 --> 00:15:43,800
this when you swap fast food for a Clean

411
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:46,000
home-cooked Diet your body feels better

412
00:15:43,800 --> 00:15:48,480
right the same principle applies to

413
00:15:46,000 --> 00:15:50,880
chickens after a few weeks on the Amish

414
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,800
method your flock will look and feel as

415
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,720
rejuvenated as if they just returned

416
00:15:52,800 --> 00:15:57,079
from a spar treat one of the first

417
00:15:54,720 --> 00:15:59,440
things I noticed was their feathers a

418
00:15:57,079 --> 00:16:01,720
well-fed happy chicken has a noticeable

419
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:04,279
glow were at least their plumage looks

420
00:16:01,720 --> 00:16:06,959
fantastic it's like replacing a Shabby

421
00:16:04,279 --> 00:16:09,480
old sweater with a brand new fluffy one

422
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:12,480
no more ragged or patchy looking birds

423
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,079
instead they were sleek and stylish

424
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:17,319
honestly if chickens had a fashion show

425
00:16:15,079 --> 00:16:19,360
mine would have been on the runway their

426
00:16:17,319 --> 00:16:21,319
new found confidence and vibrant Health

427
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:23,360
were clear then there was the egg

428
00:16:21,319 --> 00:16:26,480
production while I wasn't expecting a

429
00:16:23,360 --> 00:16:28,199
miracle the Amish diet didn't disappoint

430
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,959
not only did the quantity of eggs

431
00:16:28,199 --> 00:16:33,279
increase but the quality also improved

432
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,399
significantly the yolks were richer the

433
00:16:33,279 --> 00:16:37,639
shells were sturdier and my chickens

434
00:16:35,399 --> 00:16:39,639
just seemed genuinely happier cracking

435
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:42,160
open one of those deep golden yolks felt

436
00:16:39,639 --> 00:16:44,120
like getting a little piece of sunshine

437
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:46,000
all of this came from swapping expensive

438
00:16:44,120 --> 00:16:49,120
grain feed for something closer to their

439
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:51,519
natural diet I was genuinely impressed

440
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:54,360
here's an interesting fact chickens on a

441
00:16:51,519 --> 00:16:55,800
grain-free diet often lay up to 15% more

442
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:58,959
eggs than those on traditional

443
00:16:55,800 --> 00:17:00,839
grain-based diets that huge but when

444
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:03,680
you're collecting eggs every morning it

445
00:17:00,839 --> 00:17:05,400
adds up and it's definitely satisfying

446
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,199
it made me feel like I was running a

447
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:09,760
boutique Egg Farm another big plus was

448
00:17:08,199 --> 00:17:12,679
how much healthier the chickens were

449
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,880
overall they needed fewer vet visits had

450
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:17,000
fewer health issues and caused me far

451
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,120
less stress when chickens aren't

452
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,280
overloading on grains they're less

453
00:17:19,120 --> 00:17:23,679
likely to become overweight develop

454
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,839
fatty liver disease or turn into those

455
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:29,559
lethargic grumpy hens that just sit

456
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,200
around instead mine became active alert

457
00:17:29,559 --> 00:17:34,280
and fully engaged in their environment

458
00:17:32,200 --> 00:17:36,520
chickens that forage and scratch around

459
00:17:34,280 --> 00:17:39,400
naturally are much healthier and believe

460
00:17:36,520 --> 00:17:41,280
me much happier too every morning they

461
00:17:39,400 --> 00:17:43,160
practically bounced out of the co-op

462
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:45,440
eager to hunt for bugs or Peck at the

463
00:17:43,160 --> 00:17:47,840
scraps I gave them it was like they

464
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,880
turned into little chicken athletes

465
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:51,799
here's the real game changer fewer

466
00:17:49,880 --> 00:17:54,120
health problems mean fewer trips to the

467
00:17:51,799 --> 00:17:57,159
vet nobody enjoys dealing with sick

468
00:17:54,120 --> 00:17:58,960
chickens not them and definitely not me

469
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:00,640
no chicken wants to be hauled off to to

470
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:03,440
the vet when they could be out enjoying

471
00:18:00,640 --> 00:18:05,240
the sunshine and chasing Grasshoppers

472
00:18:03,440 --> 00:18:07,480
and let's not even talk about those vet

473
00:18:05,240 --> 00:18:08,919
bills thanks to the Amish method the

474
00:18:07,480 --> 00:18:11,280
need for vet visits dropped

475
00:18:08,919 --> 00:18:13,799
significantly and my wallet was just as

476
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:16,120
happy as my chickens in short the

477
00:18:13,799 --> 00:18:18,360
benefits of this Method Keep piling up

478
00:18:16,120 --> 00:18:20,559
and they're not just temporary once your

479
00:18:18,360 --> 00:18:24,039
chickens start thriving on this diet the

480
00:18:20,559 --> 00:18:24,039
rewards are long lasting
