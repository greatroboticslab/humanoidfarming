  "text": "hey all Mike here from allamerican.org now you may remember a long time ago I did a video on how to find tools made in the USA and today we are revisiting that category but more specifically talking about gardening tools [Music] now you may be wondering Mike why the heck are we talking about gardening duels in the dead of winter and that's really for two reasons one is that you should always be paying attention to your garden but second of all it is the slow season for a lot of these businesses and what better way to support grade made in the USA companies than really supporting them during their slow period of the year when they're also likely running some sales so you may be able to create get a great deal as well so per usual also written about this exact same topic so check the description below for a link to that article and head over to allamerican.org for all of our research on shopping American made first off when it comes to materials there's a few different things you need to look out for over here one is that a lot of gardening tools are going to be made of some sort of tempered steel or stainless steel now there's a lot of great material suppliers for this raw material in the US so you should have no problem finding great gardening tool brands that are sourcing their steel from U.S suppliers now you also want to look at the other materials within the tools as well if it's a hand tool the handle is likely going to be made out of something like rubber or plastic good news is there are plenty of great suppliers of those raw materials as well so generally the gardening tools category is one where you can find a lot of brands that are not only doing a lot of their assembly and Manufacturing here but are also sourcing a lot of their raw materials from U.S suppliers as well which is not always the case for a lot of subcategories of tools now in order to find the country of origin you can always give the brand a call if you're shopping online if they don't list the country of origin on their website or shoot us a mess with your dollamerican.org and we'll help you find out out or if you're shopping in store we have some U.S legislation on our side that basically dictates that the country of origin be labeled on the product or packaging so you should see it clearly labeled when you're shopping around Home Depot or Lowe's or any other store that you're looking at I have a full explainer video with those tips and more which I'll make sure to link in the description below as well as the cards at the top of the video If you haven't seen that one yet alright now that we've covered a couple of tips on material sourcing let's get into a few of those great American-made brands that are making some awesome gardening tools right here in the USA first up is Rogue hoe tools now this company also goes by projo manufacturing they are based out of London Kansas and make some great gardening tools more specifically hose they're a family-owned business that got started in 1990 and they really began as just a simple Christmas gift from one family member to another and that has evolved today to a product line of over 60 different tools that you can use in your garden they have a lot of different varieties to choose from from so if you need a really durable hoe made from tempered steel and is super environmentally friendly definitely check out roko tools next up is Bully tools bully tools is based in Steubenville Ohio and makes a ton of different styles of tools for your garden or lawn these guys offer shovels rakes diggers and pretty much everything in between so no matter what type of tool you need for your garden or lawn these guys will probably have it I find these guys to be a really good value for your dollar they have 11 gauge American Steel in a lot of their heavy duty tools at a really affordable price next up is Wilcox All Pro Tools Wilcox makes some great gardening tools everything from your travels and diggers to your weeders and Scoops their diggers in particular are really reliable they're made from stainless steel and not just their diggers but all of their products are made from 100 US Source materials next up is Fisher blacksmithing Fisher blacksmithing is based out of Bozeman Montana and as the name suggests they hand craft all of their gardening tools using traditional blacksmithing techniques their products are made using steel heated in a forge and then shaped over an anvil using a hammer and tongs they're then set into American Walnut handles they have a really pretty look to them and are going to last you a lifetime and the last few Brands I'll mention in today's video Cobra head makes a really popular weeder and cultivator Garden works also makes a really reliable travel to give you another option there and then earth box if you're looking for some planters makes some really solid ones out of their facility as well as far as the big Brands and the gardening tools industry and where they're actually made I feel like I've covered those pretty extensively in some of my other YouTube videos particularly the shorter videos on the channel as well as some of the full length videos on different tool categories so make sure to check those out for popular brands like Cobalt and DeWalt and others that are also making hand tools
