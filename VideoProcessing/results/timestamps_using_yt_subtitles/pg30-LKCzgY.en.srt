00:00:00,320 --> 00:00:05,120
So much of Australia's story is to do

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,879
with water. There's often too much or

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,440
too

4
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:11,360
little. Drought is a constant

5
00:00:08,440 --> 00:00:14,480
threat. Cattleman Randall Crosia

6
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:19,199
averages just three good years in 10.

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:21,520
Yeah. Well, it's uh 24,000 km or 6

8
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:23,519
million acres. Well, it's meant to be

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:24,560
the size of of Belgium, so to say, but

10
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:27,279
I've never been there, so I couldn't

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:29,840
tell you.

12
00:00:27,279 --> 00:00:32,559
Randall manages Anna Creek Station. the

13
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:35,399
world's largest cattle property. It

14
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:38,520
survives on 8 in of rain a

15
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,960
year, if it comes at

16
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:44,399
all. We live in a desert, so it always

17
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:47,800
looks like it's dry, although uh most of

18
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,239
the stuff that grows here is very

19
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:52,960
nutritious. We don't need very much rain

20
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,920
to make it spring to life, you know, and

21
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:59,960
it um it's a very productive country if

22
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,960
if you get the water on it.

23
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:05,920
Across twothirds of Australia, no rivers

24
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:08,680
flow, just parched channels flooded

25
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,360
fleetingly by

26
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,580
rain, which hasn't come to Anna Creek in

27
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,560
4

28
00:01:13,580 --> 00:01:17,600
[Music]

29
00:01:15,560 --> 00:01:20,000
years. From when we get a decent

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:21,759
rainfall until the dams go dry, we've

31
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:23,150
got about probably 9 to 12 months

32
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,479
maximum.

33
00:01:23,150 --> 00:01:25,680
[Music]

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,520
Well, that's the way this country is,

35
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,240
you know. She is she's got to learn to

36
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,439
live with it a bit and uh go along with

37
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,560
it. You can't go against it. You'll

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,560
never win.
