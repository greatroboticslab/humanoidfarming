00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
n

6
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:39,399
just a few years ago I was right where

7
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:41,920
you are trying to figure out how to

8
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,719
build an affordable Greenhouse structure

9
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:45,520
now just a few years later and I've

10
00:00:43,719 --> 00:00:47,719
built four of these green houses that

11
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,079
I'm standing in right now and in this

12
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:53,000
video I'm going to show you an

13
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:55,359
affordable DIY Greenhouse so easy anyone

14
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,640
can build it with no experience or prior

15
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:00,359
knowledge you'll also learn how to build

16
00:00:57,640 --> 00:01:02,359
scissor door end walls install a Wi-Fi

17
00:01:00,359 --> 00:01:04,439
controlled irrigation system with

18
00:01:02,359 --> 00:01:05,840
rainwater catchment and make sure you

19
00:01:04,439 --> 00:01:07,880
watch it till the end cuz I'm going to

20
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,680
show you how I built all this and didn't

21
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,159
pay a single dollar and you might be

22
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,040
able to also hey what's up everybody I'm

23
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:16,360
Chef Mikey welcome back to Chef's

24
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,200
Harvest Farm I'm a former executive chef

25
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:20,560
who turned my gardening hobby into a

26
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:22,840
full-time business when I started

27
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:24,880
growing food I knew nothing about

28
00:01:22,840 --> 00:01:27,680
gardening I also knew nothing about

29
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:30,240
building green houses I started with one

30
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:32,399
little raised bed box garden that filled

31
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,119
with soil that I bought at Home Depot

32
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,560
and I started growing seedlings under

33
00:01:34,119 --> 00:01:38,560
grow lights in my basement my first

34
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:40,720
Greenhouse was a swing set that I found

35
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,320
in the trees behind my house I'll go

36
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:43,880
over a few of the options that I

37
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:45,640
researched before I built this

38
00:01:43,880 --> 00:01:47,520
greenhouse but if you want to fast

39
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:49,320
forward to the build on this greenhouse

40
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,479
you can fast forward to this time in the

41
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:53,680
video so I bought some greenhouse

42
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,360
plastic from greenhousemegastore.com

43
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:58,360
threw it over the top of the swing set

44
00:01:56,360 --> 00:02:00,680
and held it down with bricks and rocks

45
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:02,399
or whatever I could find at the time and

46
00:02:00,680 --> 00:02:04,799
this Got Me by for a little bit while I

47
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,520
taught myself to grow food but as you

48
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,880
can imagine there were many days when

49
00:02:06,520 --> 00:02:10,560
I'd come home from work and the

50
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:13,040
greenhouse plastic had blown away so I

51
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,440
started researching how to build a

52
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:17,840
greenhouse I had very little money to

53
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,440
invest I looked at the cheap Amazon and

54
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,800
Walmart options but I needed something a

55
00:02:20,440 --> 00:02:24,680
little more heavy duty at this point I'd

56
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,519
kind of started selling veggies at work

57
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:28,800
and I was kind of flirting with the idea

58
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:30,120
of turning it into a business so I knew

59
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,920
I needed something that would be

60
00:02:30,120 --> 00:02:34,519
Dependable stand up to the elements

61
00:02:32,920 --> 00:02:38,120
strong enough to use the structure for

62
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:40,640
trellising and possible snow loads so I

63
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,599
started looking at DIY options I saw

64
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:44,680
some people on YouTube making Hoops out

65
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,599
a PVC pipe and then installing

66
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:49,280
greenhouse plastic over the PVC pipes

67
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,120
and this seemed like a great option for

68
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:53,120
me I thought it seemed like something I

69
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,680
might have the skill set to figure out

70
00:02:53,120 --> 00:02:57,640
and it seemed like I could purchase all

71
00:02:54,680 --> 00:03:00,239
the materials rather easily but as I did

72
00:02:57,640 --> 00:03:03,000
more research I learned that when PVC

73
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:05,519
and greenhouse plastic touch each other

74
00:03:03,000 --> 00:03:07,720
and are exposed to UV light there's a

75
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,920
chemical reaction that will degrade the

76
00:03:07,720 --> 00:03:13,239
greenhouse plastic very

77
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:15,760
quickly and also PVC is not made to

78
00:03:13,239 --> 00:03:17,560
withstand elements so over time it'll

79
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,959
degrade rather quickly from being

80
00:03:17,560 --> 00:03:22,480
exposed to extreme heat sunlight and

81
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,400
cold and your structure will most likely

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:26,120
not be usable anymore in just a few

83
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:29,200
short

84
00:03:26,120 --> 00:03:31,280
years so then I saw the cattle panel

85
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:33,000
Greenhouse and I think this is a really

86
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:35,439
cool option if you just want something

87
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:37,280
really small but it would not be a good

88
00:03:35,439 --> 00:03:40,319
option for anything with high ceilings

89
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,599
or that's wider than like 5 or 6 fet so

90
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,760
it's a great option but just not what I

91
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,680
was looking for so if you've used either

92
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,439
of these methods successfully let us

93
00:03:46,680 --> 00:03:50,560
know in the comments so people can read

94
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,040
the comments and then they can get some

95
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:53,920
feedback from some people who have

96
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,439
actually used these methods because I

97
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,360
just researched them and I never

98
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,959
actually used them next I learned that

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:02,400
many green houses are made made out a

100
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:04,680
chain link fencing top Rail and that

101
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,239
most of the hardware is also parts from

102
00:04:04,680 --> 00:04:09,560
chain link fencing people use chain link

103
00:04:07,239 --> 00:04:12,159
fencing top Rail and bend the Hoops

104
00:04:09,560 --> 00:04:14,480
using a hoop Bender you can buy a kit

105
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,280
from bootstrap farmer where they'll send

106
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,160
you all of the hardware you need to put

107
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:20,199
it together and then you have to go to

108
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:22,680
Home Depot or Lowe's and buy the chain

109
00:04:20,199 --> 00:04:25,199
link fencing top Rail and lumber and

110
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:27,600
bend the top rail yourself using a hoop

111
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,960
Bender but I wasn't too sure about my

112
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,120
skill set in this at the time this would

113
00:04:29,960 --> 00:04:35,240
be a viable option for me and trips to

114
00:04:32,120 --> 00:04:37,120
Home Depot and Lowe's just didn't sound

115
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:39,360
attractive it seemed like there was a

116
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,960
lot of room for error plus what are you

117
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:43,160
going to do walk around Home Depot and

118
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,320
lows with 1,000 lbs of Steel and Lumber

119
00:04:43,160 --> 00:04:46,720
in your cart like nah there's got to be

120
00:04:45,320 --> 00:04:49,520
an easier

121
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,039
way a perfect example of this is that

122
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,759
when I was building the end walls on

123
00:04:51,039 --> 00:04:55,600
this greenhouse I ran out of

124
00:04:52,759 --> 00:04:58,280
self-tapping screws so I ran to loads to

125
00:04:55,600 --> 00:04:59,639
get some more well I got back I tried

126
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:02,160
the screws and they were not

127
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:04,560
self-tapping so I had to go back return

128
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,560
them get the right ones and luckily

129
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,680
Lowe's is only 5 minutes from the farm

130
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:10,400
here so it's not a big deal for me but

131
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:11,919
you can see how that would get costly if

132
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:14,000
you had to run back and forth all the

133
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,000
time to Lowe's and it wasn't very close

134
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,319
for

135
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,520
you so then I started Googling

136
00:05:18,319 --> 00:05:22,199
Greenhouse companies and most of the

137
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,080
websites I could find didn't actually

138
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:26,520
post their prices it's like you have to

139
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,600
send them a request for a quote and then

140
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,039
I got these quotes back and they're like

141
00:05:28,600 --> 00:05:33,039
the $10,000 range and that just wasn't

142
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,160
feasible for me at the

143
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:37,520
time but then I learned about this

144
00:05:35,160 --> 00:05:39,720
company called farmer friend and they'll

145
00:05:37,520 --> 00:05:42,479
ship you a kit with all the hardware and

146
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:45,800
chain link fencing top rail already bent

147
00:05:42,479 --> 00:05:47,560
to size in a kit on a pallet and I did

148
00:05:45,800 --> 00:05:49,600
some research and I decided this was

149
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,319
going to be the best option for me no

150
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,639
trips to Home Depot or Lowe's for

151
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:55,840
supplies no trying to figure anything

152
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,199
out everything you need just comes

153
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:01,080
together with instructions including the

154
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:03,000
greenhouse plastic they have two styles

155
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,160
of what they call caterpillar tunnels

156
00:06:03,000 --> 00:06:07,440
they're quanset which is rounded like

157
00:06:05,160 --> 00:06:09,520
this one here or they Gothic which is

158
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:11,880
what I just built and I have three of

159
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:13,840
them I like the gothic style better cuz

160
00:06:11,880 --> 00:06:16,720
it allows for more height on the sides

161
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:20,240
and in the middle and then they come in

162
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,199
2550 or 100t lengths I have four of

163
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:26,520
these in total right now and they're all

164
00:06:22,199 --> 00:06:28,199
50 ft lengths and 16 ft wide the ones I

165
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,479
have are the pro kits which means they

166
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,360
have a solid piece of chain link fencing

167
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:36,240
top rail down the center and it also has

168
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:38,720
12-in lift kits with wind bracing on all

169
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:41,080
the corners this model currently sells

170
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,080
for about

171
00:06:41,639 --> 00:06:46,360
$2500 then they do sell a more basic kit

172
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:48,759
which is literally just hoops and the

173
00:06:46,360 --> 00:06:50,599
hardware to attach plastic and rather

174
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,720
than the solid pipe down the middle to

175
00:06:50,599 --> 00:06:54,840
hold it all together it's just held

176
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,479
together with a strap and this model

177
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:01,160
costs about $2,000 right now so honestly

178
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:02,520
I just spend and the extra $500 for the

179
00:07:01,160 --> 00:07:07,319
peace of mind that you have a little

180
00:07:02,520 --> 00:07:07,319
extra support in Wind rain and

181
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:13,080
snow I'm building this greenhouse in an

182
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,919
already established no till Garden so

183
00:07:13,080 --> 00:07:17,160
the day before we built it these beds

184
00:07:14,919 --> 00:07:19,000
had crops in them so the first step for

185
00:07:17,160 --> 00:07:21,639
me was to harvest the crops and get the

186
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:24,280
entire area cleaned

187
00:07:21,639 --> 00:07:26,520
out then we just ratee the area as

188
00:07:24,280 --> 00:07:28,039
smooth as possible because I've got two

189
00:07:26,520 --> 00:07:30,080
of these tunnels right next to each

190
00:07:28,039 --> 00:07:32,160
other I had to move everything over and

191
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
I actually lost a bed to account for the

192
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:36,319
additional flow of watershed in between

193
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,199
the tunnels so just put some thought

194
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,840
into where all the extra water is going

195
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:41,560
to go this is going to be different for

196
00:07:39,840 --> 00:07:44,400
everyone but it's something you

197
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,400
definitely need to think about now my

198
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:49,639
entire Garden is on an 8% slope and I've

199
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:51,680
built the entire Garden facing down the

200
00:07:49,639 --> 00:07:53,759
slope so that water runs in between the

201
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:55,720
tunnels and away from the garden so I

202
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,840
don't really experience any wash out

203
00:07:55,720 --> 00:07:59,560
when it rains with this method and I've

204
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,759
also dug a ditch in between clean the

205
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:04,159
tunnels and line them with wood chips

206
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,879
and this helps with erosion control so

207
00:08:04,159 --> 00:08:08,960
if anything does wash away it's wood

208
00:08:05,879 --> 00:08:10,759
chips and not soil particles I do end up

209
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,360
putting additional wood chips in between

210
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:16,199
the tunnels a couple of times a year but

211
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:18,039
this but I do this in all of my Pathways

212
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,919
around the farm so it's just a normal

213
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:23,039
part of my operational

214
00:08:20,919 --> 00:08:25,080
practices the context in which you're

215
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:26,840
building your high tunnel could be very

216
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:28,720
different from mine but it's important

217
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,800
that you deal with any grass and weeds

218
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,440
before you start building your tunnel

219
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,399
one of the great things about this style

220
00:08:32,440 --> 00:08:36,800
of greenhouse is the ground does not

221
00:08:34,399 --> 00:08:39,479
need to be perfectly level like I said

222
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:42,360
I'm on a 8% slope and I've never tilled

223
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,600
my soil or had it graded I've just red

224
00:08:42,360 --> 00:08:46,200
it and otherwise I'm just working with

225
00:08:44,600 --> 00:08:47,800
what I have but you might need to

226
00:08:46,200 --> 00:08:50,240
prepare your ground

227
00:08:47,800 --> 00:08:52,560
accordingly once we got the area cleaned

228
00:08:50,240 --> 00:08:55,640
out I had one person measure out the

229
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:57,839
corners and pound in 3ft pieces of rebar

230
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,120
to Mark the corners once we had it

231
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,600
Square I had her pound rebar in every 5

232
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,120
ft which is the hoop spacing we're going

233
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,079
with on these tunnels Meanwhile my

234
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:10,519
friend Dawn and I were putting the hoops

235
00:09:08,079 --> 00:09:12,560
together every other hoop on this build

236
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:14,880
gets a piece of wind bracing installed

237
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:17,160
at the top so we're careful to install

238
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:19,680
them in the correct order and then lean

239
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,760
them up against my shed in the order in

240
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:24,279
which they will be installed so when we

241
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:26,440
install them all we need to do is easily

242
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,079
walk them into place it's just a

243
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:30,480
headache to install if you don't have

244
00:09:28,079 --> 00:09:33,320
them staged in the correct

245
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,279
order so the next step my friends and I

246
00:09:33,320 --> 00:09:37,440
just walk them into place the entire

247
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,760
process up until this point only took

248
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,399
about 2 hours and the skeleton of the

249
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:44,120
structure is up next I installed the

250
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,720
center Pearl in down the middle and I

251
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:48,800
just left it Loose then I go back and

252
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,120
tighten everything ensuring that they're

253
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:54,160
all exactly 5 ft apart once the center

254
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:56,120
post is installed I zip tied the

255
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,720
irrigation lines for the sprinkler

256
00:09:56,120 --> 00:10:01,000
system to the pipe it's much easier to

257
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:03,880
install any additional Hardware like

258
00:10:01,000 --> 00:10:06,720
irrigation or trellising wire before you

259
00:10:03,880 --> 00:10:08,480
put the plastic on I did also install

260
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:10,360
trellising wire at this point because

261
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:12,480
I'm planning to grow indeterminant

262
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:14,720
tomatoes in this tunnel next

263
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,720
season one thing I could never seem to

264
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,680
figure out when researching how to build

265
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,279
a greenhouse is how do they attach the

266
00:10:18,680 --> 00:10:23,240
plastic to the greenhouse Well turns out

267
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:25,360
there's a piece of Hardware made

268
00:10:23,240 --> 00:10:27,880
specifically for this purpose and it's

269
00:10:25,360 --> 00:10:30,120
called channel lock and wiggle wire and

270
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:32,440
you can buy this stuff at Amazon or any

271
00:10:30,120 --> 00:10:34,519
greenhouse supply store so I usually

272
00:10:32,440 --> 00:10:36,880
just buy it from Amazon I'll leave a

273
00:10:34,519 --> 00:10:38,680
link for everything in this build below

274
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:40,480
including a link to the kit and

275
00:10:38,680 --> 00:10:42,839
irrigation

276
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:45,279
supplies the next big step is getting

277
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,079
the plastic on one thing to always be

278
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:49,279
careful of when building any type of

279
00:10:47,079 --> 00:10:52,000
greenhouse structure is that you want

280
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:54,680
the screws bolts in any hardware to be

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:57,560
facing inwards so when you install the

282
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:59,360
plastic you don't rip it it comes on a

283
00:10:57,560 --> 00:11:02,160
roll and we just rolled it out out to

284
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:03,800
the length we needed and then we cut it

285
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,360
then the four of us pulled it over the

286
00:11:03,800 --> 00:11:08,399
top pretty easily I used wiggle wire to

287
00:11:06,360 --> 00:11:11,079
hold it in place on the top when making

288
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,160
the final adjustments and then the

289
00:11:11,079 --> 00:11:15,519
Plastics just held down by rope which

290
00:11:13,160 --> 00:11:17,320
zigzags down the tunnel Back in Forth

291
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:19,880
connecting to the carabiners at the

292
00:11:17,320 --> 00:11:21,600
bottom of each hoop this is what secures

293
00:11:19,880 --> 00:11:23,959
the plastic to the structure so it

294
00:11:21,600 --> 00:11:26,079
doesn't flop around in the wind and then

295
00:11:23,959 --> 00:11:28,360
it also allows you to lift up the sides

296
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:29,959
for ventilation and then this is it this

297
00:11:28,360 --> 00:11:31,800
is what they say you on the pallet it's

298
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:34,040
just the bones of the structure and then

299
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:35,720
the plastic to go over top of it

300
00:11:34,040 --> 00:11:37,839
basically they take the headache out of

301
00:11:35,720 --> 00:11:39,639
trying to build your own from scratch

302
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,720
and then send you all these parts on a

303
00:11:39,639 --> 00:11:43,720
pallet and then the rest is up to you

304
00:11:41,720 --> 00:11:46,279
you can customize the structure to be

305
00:11:43,720 --> 00:11:48,519
whatever you want it to be now you do

306
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:52,000
need to be able to manage a pallet that

307
00:11:48,519 --> 00:11:53,959
weighs about 1,000 to 3,000 lb I do have

308
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:57,800
a small tractor with fork lifts but it

309
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:59,560
only lifts about 700 lb so what I do is

310
00:11:57,800 --> 00:12:01,959
just message Farmers for friend and have

311
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:03,800
them ship it to a local Freight Hub and

312
00:12:01,959 --> 00:12:06,040
then I go pick it up with my truck and

313
00:12:03,800 --> 00:12:07,920
have them put it in the back of my truck

314
00:12:06,040 --> 00:12:10,800
then I drive my truck to a place it's

315
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,160
easier to unload using my tractor this

316
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,839
way I'm not out in the middle of the

317
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:16,199
street trying to unload a tractor

318
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:18,760
trailer with a under sufficient tractor

319
00:12:16,199 --> 00:12:20,480
for the job and I can just take my time

320
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:21,680
to make sure everything's unloaded

321
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,480
safely and

322
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,959
carefully the next day I had my friend

323
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,480
Max come back and the two of us measured

324
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:32,720
out beds and walkways and re built them

325
00:12:29,480 --> 00:12:35,959
using my typical no till methods where I

326
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:38,839
just put compost 3 to 4 in deep in the

327
00:12:35,959 --> 00:12:40,720
beds and wood chips in the walkways then

328
00:12:38,839 --> 00:12:42,760
I did all the finishing touches of

329
00:12:40,720 --> 00:12:44,240
setting up the irrigation and building

330
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:47,040
the end walls

331
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,920
myself so since we zip tied the

332
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:51,880
irrigation Mainline to the center

333
00:12:48,920 --> 00:12:53,680
pearlin before we installed the plastic

334
00:12:51,880 --> 00:12:55,639
all that was left for me to do was

335
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:58,040
install the water filter with pressure

336
00:12:55,639 --> 00:13:00,399
reducer hook into the water line and

337
00:12:58,040 --> 00:13:03,120
flesh out the system before installing

338
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,480
the sprinkler heads the overhead

339
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
irrigation system is a kit that you can

340
00:13:05,480 --> 00:13:09,959
buy from Farmer's

341
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:13,199
friend and all of the drip irrigation I

342
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:15,240
get from a company called drip depot.com

343
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:18,199
which is where I typically get all of my

344
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:20,680
Irrigation Supplies but whatever you do

345
00:13:18,199 --> 00:13:22,560
definitely do not Overlook irrigating

346
00:13:20,680 --> 00:13:24,639
your Greenhouse since it will never rain

347
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,880
in there otherwise you will need to

348
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,120
water everything by hand I have overhead

349
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:32,440
Sprinklers and RP irrigation installed

350
00:13:30,120 --> 00:13:34,639
in all of my green houses so that I have

351
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:37,199
maximum control over the moisture in

352
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:39,199
them and I have it all controlled using

353
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:42,320
Wi-Fi controlled

354
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:44,639
timer so I can control every aspect of

355
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,760
my irrigation from my phone wherever I

356
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,000
have an internet connection it's

357
00:13:46,760 --> 00:13:51,519
actually a super simple setup it's just

358
00:13:49,000 --> 00:13:54,880
a beehive timer from orbits that plugs

359
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:56,759
into a regular hose adapter on my house

360
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,880
and it comes with this little Hub that

361
00:13:56,759 --> 00:14:01,639
plugs into any wall outlet

362
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:04,079
download the app and you're up and

363
00:14:01,639 --> 00:14:06,040
running the entire Wi-Fi controlled

364
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,480
timer was only about

365
00:14:06,040 --> 00:14:11,360
$150 and it is well worth the investment

366
00:14:09,480 --> 00:14:14,199
I can't tell you how many trips to the

367
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:16,880
water faucet this inexpensive piece of

368
00:14:14,199 --> 00:14:18,759
infrastructure has saved me and then I

369
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:21,079
also have all of the drip lines on my

370
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:23,800
green houses tapped into a line that is

371
00:14:21,079 --> 00:14:26,279
fed from my rainwater catchment tank

372
00:14:23,800 --> 00:14:29,000
hooked up to the gutters on my house but

373
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:30,920
it only holds 500 gallons of water right

374
00:14:29,000 --> 00:14:33,240
now so it's also hooked into to the

375
00:14:30,920 --> 00:14:36,120
Wi-Fi controlled system to supplement

376
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,079
with City water as needed this system is

377
00:14:36,120 --> 00:14:40,440
a working progress but I'll definitely

378
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,880
be posting a video about the irrigation

379
00:14:40,440 --> 00:14:44,839
system soon now it's around Christmas

380
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:47,880
and New Year's at the time of installing

381
00:14:44,839 --> 00:14:49,800
all this so it's pretty cold out however

382
00:14:47,880 --> 00:14:52,120
I did manage to have a little bit of a

383
00:14:49,800 --> 00:14:54,399
warm spell with temps in the 50s during

384
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:56,480
the irrigation setup but it's not

385
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:58,279
recommended to install Irrigation in the

386
00:14:56,480 --> 00:15:00,040
winter because it's very difficult to

387
00:14:58,279 --> 00:15:02,560
work with with the plastic tubing when

388
00:15:00,040 --> 00:15:04,839
it's cold it will Kink which causes

389
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,160
stress points which will eventually lead

390
00:15:04,839 --> 00:15:09,120
to leaks in your line so generally

391
00:15:07,160 --> 00:15:11,240
speaking you will want to install it on

392
00:15:09,120 --> 00:15:13,560
a warm day with Temps at least in the

393
00:15:11,240 --> 00:15:15,800
70s but since I needed to get this

394
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:18,079
installed I used a blowtorch to lightly

395
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:20,399
heat up the tubing so that it's more

396
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,000
pliable then I use it to expand the

397
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,199
connection points for easier

398
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:26,279
installation these connections can be

399
00:15:24,199 --> 00:15:28,839
very challenging to work with when it's

400
00:15:26,279 --> 00:15:30,959
cold after I got the irrigation all

401
00:15:28,839 --> 00:15:33,639
dialed in now it's time to wrap it all

402
00:15:30,959 --> 00:15:35,519
up with the scissor door end walls now I

403
00:15:33,639 --> 00:15:37,480
did not make this up or anything like

404
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:39,959
that I got the plans from Johnny's

405
00:15:37,480 --> 00:15:42,759
selected seeds which is where I order

406
00:15:39,959 --> 00:15:44,480
about 90% of all my seeds from I'll

407
00:15:42,759 --> 00:15:46,440
leave a link in the description but they

408
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:48,560
have pretty detailed instructions on

409
00:15:46,440 --> 00:15:51,160
their website and hopefully with this

410
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:53,880
video it helps you put it all

411
00:15:51,160 --> 00:15:55,839
together so the first step is to get the

412
00:15:53,880 --> 00:15:58,079
supplies you can order them off the

413
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,360
internet probably but I just went to

414
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,560
Home Depot for these supplies you will

415
00:16:00,360 --> 00:16:05,079
need these clips which Johnny sells for

416
00:16:02,560 --> 00:16:07,720
like $10 each but I just buy the clips

417
00:16:05,079 --> 00:16:10,519
from Amazon and they're like $20 for 10

418
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,000
of them so we're basically building four

419
00:16:10,519 --> 00:16:15,480
separate doors Two on each end and they

420
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:17,440
will open like a curtain the first step

421
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:20,120
is to get four pieces of chain link

422
00:16:17,440 --> 00:16:22,199
fencing top Rail and measure the tallest

423
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,600
point of your tunnel and cut them

424
00:16:22,199 --> 00:16:27,959
accordingly I bought 10 1/2t pieces and

425
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:30,279
I cut them to 9 ft making sure to cut

426
00:16:27,959 --> 00:16:33,079
off the s edged end because then I took

427
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:35,160
the 18-in piece that I cut off and I

428
00:16:33,079 --> 00:16:37,519
climbed up the ladder and installed it

429
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:38,959
into the piece of top rail that we used

430
00:16:37,519 --> 00:16:41,440
as the center

431
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:43,959
pearing I secured it with a self-tapping

432
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:46,920
screw then I just drilled a hole in the

433
00:16:43,959 --> 00:16:48,800
9t piece of top Rail and inserted what

434
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:51,240
they call a tension band that I got from

435
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:53,519
the fencing aisle in Home Depot and held

436
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,000
it all together with a carriage bolt now

437
00:16:53,519 --> 00:16:57,600
my top rail has a loop on it and I can

438
00:16:56,000 --> 00:16:59,680
hang it from the piece that I just

439
00:16:57,600 --> 00:17:01,920
inserted into into the end of the center

440
00:16:59,680 --> 00:17:04,000
pearling which is held on with some more

441
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:06,199
self-tapping screws so it doesn't slip

442
00:17:04,000 --> 00:17:08,640
off the end of the pipe I took the other

443
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:10,559
swedged end that we cut off and I pound

444
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,000
that one into the ground right next to

445
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:15,280
where the doors come together this is

446
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,839
how we will secure the doors closed

447
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:19,839
using a wire tie then I measured the

448
00:17:17,839 --> 00:17:21,880
plastic and I cut it to sides to fit

449
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,679
each door separately I climbed the

450
00:17:21,880 --> 00:17:25,679
ladder and attach the plastic to the

451
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:28,000
peak and hold it in place with a few

452
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:30,039
Wiggles of the wiggle wire then as I

453
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:32,280
come down down the ladder I attach the

454
00:17:30,039 --> 00:17:34,919
plastic to the inside of the 9- Ft piece

455
00:17:32,280 --> 00:17:36,880
of top rail door using the clips that I

456
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,640
purchased from

457
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,880
Amazon so the door is locked in place by

458
00:17:39,640 --> 00:17:44,039
the wire tie so it doesn't move with the

459
00:17:41,880 --> 00:17:46,080
plastic attached and I can stretch it

460
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:47,520
over to the side where I can install it

461
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:50,559
into the channel

462
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,000
lock once I have it attached I can go

463
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:54,760
and make adjustments as needed now I can

464
00:17:53,000 --> 00:17:57,159
pull it tight and install the wiggle

465
00:17:54,760 --> 00:17:59,159
wire all the way up in the same channel

466
00:17:57,159 --> 00:18:01,760
lock that's holding down the greenhouse

467
00:17:59,159 --> 00:18:04,280
plastic I find I can usually Jam about

468
00:18:01,760 --> 00:18:06,600
three wiggle wires deep in one channel

469
00:18:04,280 --> 00:18:08,559
lock and you want to make sure you start

470
00:18:06,600 --> 00:18:11,600
at one end and finish at the other

471
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:13,480
pushing out any slack as you go do not

472
00:18:11,600 --> 00:18:15,280
start at both ends and meet in the

473
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:18,440
middle you'll end up with a crinkled

474
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,320
door that could catch wind or hold water

475
00:18:18,440 --> 00:18:22,360
once I had it installed into the channel

476
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:24,880
lock then I could go back to the clips

477
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:27,039
and make any adjustments as necessary

478
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,840
and then I secure each clip with one

479
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:30,679
self-tapping screw

480
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:32,960
now to hold it all together I picked up

481
00:18:30,679 --> 00:18:34,080
these heavy duty picture frame hanger

482
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:36,600
looking

483
00:18:34,080 --> 00:18:38,039
thingies I found them in the aisle with

484
00:18:36,600 --> 00:18:40,159
bungee cords I think they're for

485
00:18:38,039 --> 00:18:42,360
securing bungee cords or something like

486
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,039
that but I attach this with self-tapping

487
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,799
screws on the outside of the tunnel over

488
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,440
the plastic then I just tie it with a

489
00:18:47,799 --> 00:18:52,000
piece of extra rope from the wind

490
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:54,039
bracing on the inside of the tunnel once

491
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:56,240
you get the first one done you can go

492
00:18:54,039 --> 00:18:58,640
ahead secure it open so you can work on

493
00:18:56,240 --> 00:19:00,960
the next one and repeat these steps on

494
00:18:58,640 --> 00:19:03,159
all four doors it takes me about 30

495
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:05,720
minutes per door to install them once I

496
00:19:03,159 --> 00:19:07,640
have everything staged but total time

497
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:09,320
spent on the end walls was pretty much

498
00:19:07,640 --> 00:19:12,480
most of the day since I had to go to

499
00:19:09,320 --> 00:19:14,039
Home Depot twice I'll also share with

500
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,080
you another type of end wall that I've

501
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:18,080
built on my Nursery tunnel but I would

502
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:21,360
not recommend this type of end wall for

503
00:19:18,080 --> 00:19:23,280
several reasons first it's made of wood

504
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:25,159
so the wood will eventually rot and need

505
00:19:23,280 --> 00:19:27,720
to be replaced it will not stand the

506
00:19:25,159 --> 00:19:30,400
test of time otherwise these structures

507
00:19:27,720 --> 00:19:32,000
will pretty much much last a lifetime

508
00:19:30,400 --> 00:19:33,960
but the main reason I don't like this

509
00:19:32,000 --> 00:19:36,120
style of end wall is because it blocks

510
00:19:33,960 --> 00:19:37,840
the sides of the tunnels on the ends

511
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:39,960
which makes it difficult to use the

512
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:42,840
paper pot transplanter and the Jang

513
00:19:39,960 --> 00:19:45,640
Cedar which are my two main planting

514
00:19:42,840 --> 00:19:47,960
tools they also took me twice as long to

515
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:50,919
build there's far more measuring cutting

516
00:19:47,960 --> 00:19:53,200
screwing and overall work involved and

517
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:55,679
they do not allow for maximum air flow

518
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:57,840
through the tunnel when open the scissor

519
00:19:55,679 --> 00:20:00,240
door option is by far the easiest

520
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:02,760
cheapest and most efficient end wall

521
00:20:00,240 --> 00:20:04,559
option I've come up with but let people

522
00:20:02,760 --> 00:20:07,120
know in the comments if you disagree and

523
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:09,799
have a better option we should be aware

524
00:20:07,120 --> 00:20:11,919
of now this is the fourth one of these

525
00:20:09,799 --> 00:20:14,039
that I've built and all of the other

526
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,400
three I did completely by myself With a

527
00:20:14,039 --> 00:20:19,000
Little Help From My wife or a friend to

528
00:20:16,400 --> 00:20:21,760
put the plastic on so it's definitely

529
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:23,799
possible to build this by yourself but I

530
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:26,760
figure however you look at it it's about

531
00:20:23,799 --> 00:20:28,600
30 to 40 hours worth of Labor total

532
00:20:26,760 --> 00:20:30,679
including installing the end walls and

533
00:20:28,600 --> 00:20:33,159
irrigation which obviously goes a lot

534
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:35,520
faster with more people but in my

535
00:20:33,159 --> 00:20:37,480
context the ground was already prepared

536
00:20:35,520 --> 00:20:39,280
so depending on your context it could

537
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,960
take a little longer and you may need to

538
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:43,200
do some ground

539
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,120
workor but the great thing about these

540
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:47,600
tunnels is that the ground does not need

541
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,880
to be perfectly level or flat and

542
00:20:47,600 --> 00:20:52,400
honestly none of my tunnels are perfect

543
00:20:49,880 --> 00:20:54,440
construction I always find flaws in my

544
00:20:52,400 --> 00:20:57,440
construction something isn't perfectly

545
00:20:54,440 --> 00:20:59,159
straight looks crooked but the truth is

546
00:20:57,440 --> 00:21:01,320
that once I put put the plastic on and

547
00:20:59,159 --> 00:21:03,520
start growing crops I never think about

548
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:06,080
those imperfections again the plants

549
00:21:03,520 --> 00:21:07,799
don't care and often times good enough

550
00:21:06,080 --> 00:21:09,000
is good enough when it comes to these

551
00:21:07,799 --> 00:21:11,320
types of

552
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:13,840
structures so as promised let me tell

553
00:21:11,320 --> 00:21:15,720
you how I built this absolutely free in

554
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:17,760
fact I actually turned a profit from

555
00:21:15,720 --> 00:21:20,440
building this High tunnel there's a

556
00:21:17,760 --> 00:21:22,799
department within the USDA called the

557
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:26,159
nrcs which stands for the national

558
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:29,640
resource conservation program the soil

559
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:32,880
conservation Act was passed April 27th

560
00:21:29,640 --> 00:21:35,039
1935 amid the Dust Bowl leading to the

561
00:21:32,880 --> 00:21:38,720
creation of the soil conservation

562
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:41,840
service now known as the nrcs and The

563
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:43,880
nrcs Works within Agriculture and any

564
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,799
type of natural resource conservation

565
00:21:43,880 --> 00:21:49,120
you can think of they offer High tunnel

566
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:52,279
grants within their equip program to

567
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:54,120
assist with soil erosion and I heard of

568
00:21:52,279 --> 00:21:56,039
this program before but I just figured

569
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:57,480
it was for bigger farms and that I was

570
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:59,960
too small and they wouldn't take me

571
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:01,880
serious ly but after I paid out of

572
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:03,600
pocket for the first three I figured

573
00:22:01,880 --> 00:22:05,679
what the heck let me walk in there and

574
00:22:03,600 --> 00:22:08,640
talk to these people so I just walked

575
00:22:05,679 --> 00:22:10,440
into my local County USDA office and

576
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:12,480
told them I wanted to apply for a high

577
00:22:10,440 --> 00:22:15,039
tunnel Grant they seemed thrilled that I

578
00:22:12,480 --> 00:22:17,600
was there I think it's an underutilized

579
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:19,240
program and there's a lot that goes into

580
00:22:17,600 --> 00:22:21,360
actually receiving the grant that's

581
00:22:19,240 --> 00:22:23,440
completely out of your control but I

582
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:25,440
will say this there's some basic rules

583
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:28,039
and regulations it's the government

584
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:29,440
you're dealing with here but it can pay

585
00:22:28,039 --> 00:22:31,919
dividends to make these people your

586
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:34,440
friends I've openly invited them to my

587
00:22:31,919 --> 00:22:36,440
operation which they love coming here I

588
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:38,320
think my property serves as a model of

589
00:22:36,440 --> 00:22:40,520
what can really be done on a small piece

590
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:42,520
of land I've also recommended the

591
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:44,480
program to some of my friends who have

592
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:46,919
also received the grants and I think

593
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:48,799
they really appreciate that because if

594
00:22:46,919 --> 00:22:50,640
they don't use the funds allocated by

595
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:53,120
the government then they lose the funds

596
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,960
for the following year and I've already

597
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:57,159
applied for another high tunnel Grant

598
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,080
which I've not been approved for yet so

599
00:22:57,159 --> 00:23:01,720
stay tuned for another potential

600
00:22:59,080 --> 00:23:03,480
Greenhouse build in the future but my

601
00:23:01,720 --> 00:23:05,159
point is that a lot of people are stand

602
00:23:03,480 --> 00:23:07,159
office just because they work for the

603
00:23:05,159 --> 00:23:09,400
government but these people are here to

604
00:23:07,159 --> 00:23:11,760
help you be successful once I was

605
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:15,240
approved they came out do a site

606
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:17,159
evaluation and the USDA rule states that

607
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:19,840
they will not put grant funds towards a

608
00:23:17,159 --> 00:23:23,080
high tunnel on land that is more than a

609
00:23:19,840 --> 00:23:26,799
5% grade and my entire Garden is on an

610
00:23:23,080 --> 00:23:28,200
8% slope they came out surveyed it and

611
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,840
told me I would have to have have the

612
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,600
land graded and I explained to them in

613
00:23:30,840 --> 00:23:36,000
detail my noil systems which rely

614
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:38,640
heavily on wood chip mulch for erosion

615
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:40,559
control and that having the land graded

616
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:43,760
is going to be more detrimental to the

617
00:23:40,559 --> 00:23:46,120
soil Health than being on an 8% slope I

618
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:49,000
mean I spent the last 5 years making the

619
00:23:46,120 --> 00:23:51,159
soil in my backyard like potting soil I

620
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:53,080
told them that is not worth the money to

621
00:23:51,159 --> 00:23:56,400
have a skid steer back here and they

622
00:23:53,080 --> 00:23:57,919
said okay let me send that to the top

623
00:23:56,400 --> 00:24:01,240
and because of my no tail practice

624
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:03,679
practices which rely heavily on mulches

625
00:24:01,240 --> 00:24:06,120
they got the head of the nrcs to approve

626
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:08,559
my high tunnel to be installed on an 8%

627
00:24:06,120 --> 00:24:10,880
slope so I share this with you because

628
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,400
it's not always easy you might hit some

629
00:24:10,880 --> 00:24:15,960
speed bumps the whole process took about

630
00:24:13,400 --> 00:24:18,080
a year it's a lot of work and they're

631
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:20,679
not just going to hand you money you're

632
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:22,640
not entitled to anything you need to put

633
00:24:20,679 --> 00:24:25,440
the money up front and then once you

634
00:24:22,640 --> 00:24:28,360
build it they will generously reimburse

635
00:24:25,440 --> 00:24:30,559
you and they pay by the square foot so

636
00:24:28,360 --> 00:24:33,520
for instance one of my friends took his

637
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:36,520
Grant and built a $116,000 heated

638
00:24:33,520 --> 00:24:38,640
greenhouse and they paid for $8,000 of

639
00:24:36,520 --> 00:24:40,760
it and then he paid the rest out of

640
00:24:38,640 --> 00:24:42,640
pocket and I think that's often how it

641
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:45,000
works the grant usually pays for a

642
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,840
portion not the whole thing but I

643
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:48,640
thought the opposite I thought well I

644
00:24:46,840 --> 00:24:51,480
can probably build this for less than

645
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:54,600
they pay and I did so I actually profit

646
00:24:51,480 --> 00:24:57,200
a $0000 for building this greenhouse and

647
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:59,399
at the end of the day the nrcs invested

648
00:24:57,200 --> 00:25:01,279
a prettyy large sum of money into my

649
00:24:59,399 --> 00:25:03,720
business through several grants that I

650
00:25:01,279 --> 00:25:05,880
don't need to pay back but one last

651
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:08,919
thing to understand is that the grants

652
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:11,679
are for the erodable land upon which it

653
00:25:08,919 --> 00:25:14,480
is built it is not for you personally or

654
00:25:11,679 --> 00:25:16,720
your business so if I sell my house the

655
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,480
greenhouse that was paid for with the

656
00:25:16,720 --> 00:25:22,120
grant money will have to come with the

657
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:24,360
house but there are time limitations

658
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:26,840
after like 5 years then I could take it

659
00:25:24,360 --> 00:25:29,799
with me one quick announcement before I

660
00:25:26,840 --> 00:25:33,200
sign off I've leased a new farm for the

661
00:25:29,799 --> 00:25:36,240
2024 season so stay tuned to find out

662
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:38,440
how I leased a farm for $0 and see how

663
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,240
I'm going to turn this new property into

664
00:25:38,440 --> 00:25:43,360
a no till Oasis all right everyone

665
00:25:41,240 --> 00:25:45,240
