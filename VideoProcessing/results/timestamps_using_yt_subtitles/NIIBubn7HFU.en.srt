Hampton Farms Canon country we're gonna

14
00:03:13,739 --> 00:03:17,640

15
00:03:16,019 --> 00:03:20,640
I'm going to step in behind it these are

16
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:24,480
Virginia type peanuts that we grow

17
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:26,700
Hampton farms for in shells the best the

18
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
best in shell peanuts around had a great

19
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,780
growing season this year so uh let's

20
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:32,780

foreign

22
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,720
as you can see these peanuts grow under

23
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:57,120
the ground

24
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:59,340
and what our farmer is doing right now

25
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,500
is what's called a peanut Digger and

26
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:03,780
they dig them up out of the ground and

27
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:05,280
it inverts them throws them up to the

28
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:08,120
sunlight for two or three days where

29
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,860
they do some field drying and in about

30
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,280
72 hours it'll probably be in here with

31
00:04:10,860 --> 00:04:18,359
the peanut combine and pick the pick the

32
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:20,299
pods off the vines and put into a drying

33
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:24,620
trailer so this is

34
00:04:20,299 --> 00:04:24,620
absolutely a beautiful crop here
