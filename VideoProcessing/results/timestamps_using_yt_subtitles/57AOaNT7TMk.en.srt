00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:11,799
traditional farming these methods

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,200
represent the old and the new each with

5
00:00:11,799 --> 00:00:16,199
its own philosophy and techniques each

6
00:00:14,200 --> 00:00:18,359
offers a unique set of advantages and

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:21,160
disadvantages sparking debate about

8
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,160
which method Reigns Supreme Hydroponics

9
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:25,439

10
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,439
higher yields and efficient water use

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,320
while traditional farming relies on -

12
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,640
tested practices and natural soil

13
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:32,480

17
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:40,760
we will explore how Hydroponics can

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:42,120
thrive in urban settings and how

19
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,000
traditional farming supports

20
00:00:42,120 --> 00:00:46,920
biodiversity and Rural economies by

21
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:48,640
understanding the nuances of each we can

22
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:50,800
better determine which approach best

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:53,199
suits our needs and the future of food

25
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:57,840
agronomists and farmers will guide us in

26
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:00,399
this exploration this exploration is not

27
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:02,879
about crowning a Victor instead it seeks

28
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,760
to provide a balanced view recognizing

29
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,200
that both methods have their place in

00:01:04,760 --> 00:01:09,119
the agricultural landscape instead it

31
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:11,360

32
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,280
weaknesses of each approach empowering

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,439
individuals to make informed decisions

34
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:18,040
about the food they consume and how it

35
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,280
is produced by examining case studies

36
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,600
and real world applications we can see
