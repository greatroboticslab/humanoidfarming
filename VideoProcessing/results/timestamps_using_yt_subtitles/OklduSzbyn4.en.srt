hey what's up everybody I'm Chef Mikey

5
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:23,160
welcome back to Chef's Harvest Farm I'm

6
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,720
sitting in my raised bed garden today

7
00:00:23,160 --> 00:00:27,240
and today I'm going to be planting these

8
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:29,320
zucchini plants and marold plants over

9
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:31,640
in this raised bed I'm going to plant

10
00:00:29,320 --> 00:00:33,399
these Direct through this mulch but the

11
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:35,559
cool thing about this mulch is that this

12
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:38,520
mulch was grown here and the roots are

13
00:00:35,559 --> 00:00:40,520
still attached feeding the microbiology

14
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,559
in the soil while at the same time

15
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:44,840
mulching the soil to protect it from the

16
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,559
Sun and in this video I'm going to show

17
00:00:44,840 --> 00:00:49,239
you how to grow your own mulch using

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:53,160
cover crops in your raised bed garden

19
00:00:49,239 --> 00:00:53,160
let's go do it first

20
00:00:55,060 --> 00:00:58,259
[Music]

21
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:10,000
just got my five gallon bucket of uh

22
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:11,960
peas and oats cover crop here and I'm

23
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,840
just going to broadcast it right on top

24
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:16,520
of the soil the oats are going to grow

25
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,680
straight up and then the peas climb up

26
00:01:16,520 --> 00:01:22,720
the oats you know it's just going to be

27
00:01:18,680 --> 00:01:25,520
like a four or 5 foot tall big mass of

28
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:28,439
cover crop it's been about 3 months

29
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,680
since I seated the raised garden beds

30
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:33,720
over here and so so today I'm going to

31
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,880
terminate them so this bed's peas and

32
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:38,200
oats right here which is what you

33
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:41,520
watched me do and then this bed got

34
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,360
planted to some mustard cover crops and

35
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:46,240
the peas and oats I'm going to crimp

36
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,000
them down so they'll stay like a mulch

37
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,200
on top of the raised bed and then I'm

38
00:01:49,000 --> 00:01:53,880
just going to plant directly into the

39
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
terminated cover crop and to do that

40
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,520
with the peas and oats because I want it

41
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,159
as mulch on top I'm just going to like

42
00:01:58,520 --> 00:02:03,799
crimp it using this it's like a tomato

43
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:06,119
stick I'm just going to step on it and

44
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:09,280
then I'm going to tarp the whole

45
00:02:06,119 --> 00:02:10,640
area and leave it tarp for like 2 weeks

46
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:12,920
and then it's all going to be dead when

47
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:35,760
we come back

48
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:37,440
[Music]

49
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:39,080
okay so the next step I'm going to water

50
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:42,159
it in pretty good and then I'm just

51
00:02:39,080 --> 00:02:44,040
going to pull the silage tarps over so

52
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:46,680
it's super important that if you're not

53
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,879
familiar with this process they're using

54
00:02:46,680 --> 00:02:52,000
the right tarp it's not just like a tarp

55
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:54,920
from Home Depot they're UV treated tarp

56
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:57,120
so I'm not super concerned about um like

57
00:02:54,920 --> 00:02:59,959
micr Plastics ending up in the soil or

58
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:02,400
anything because these tarps are made in

59
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:03,640
designed to be sitting out in the sun

60
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:04,840
but so yeah make sure you use the

61
00:03:03,640 --> 00:03:07,239
correct tarp you could also use

62
00:03:04,840 --> 00:03:09,760
greenhouse plastic and other than those

63
00:03:07,239 --> 00:03:12,159
two materials I wouldn't use anything

64
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,920
else and so I'm going to water it in

65
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:15,879
first and then pull the tarps back cuz

66
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,799
the tarps are way more effective when

67
00:03:15,879 --> 00:03:22,200
it's wet underneath so I'm going to tarp

68
00:03:18,799 --> 00:03:24,000
this whole area including all this area

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:25,959
where the fence is kind of a problem

70
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,680
area where I have to mow and I have to

71
00:03:25,959 --> 00:03:30,519
move it every time I'm just going to

72
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:35,200
tarp this try to kill this grass and

73
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:35,200
possibly just fill it all in with wood

74
00:03:40,890 --> 00:03:45,040
[Music]

75
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:55,760
chip all right so it's been exactly two

76
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:57,799
weeks since we laid the tarp down over

77
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,159
the raised bed cover crop so I'm going

78
00:03:57,799 --> 00:04:00,319
to pull it off and we'll see what it

79
00:03:59,159 --> 00:04:01,560
looks like

80
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,480
all right y'all so you can kind of see

81
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:05,439
what it looks like when I move the tarp

82
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,040
over it's like completely dead and the

83
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:10,560
mulch is just right on top of the raised

84
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:12,560
bed garden so now I'm going to like

85
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,159
clean up the whole area I'm going to

86
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:15,680
take my little flame weer here it just

87
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,320
hooks up it's just a torch that hooks up

88
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,919
to a propane tank I'm just going to like

89
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,560
kill all the little weeds that are

90
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:22,840
around in the area I'm going to hit it

91
00:04:21,560 --> 00:04:24,720
with my weed eater first and I'm going

92
00:04:22,840 --> 00:04:26,400
to Flame weed it off and then I'm just

93
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:29,919
going to like fill in the whole area

94
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:29,919
with wood chips

95
00:04:30,820 --> 00:04:37,630
[Music]

96
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:48,360
so what I'm going to do is I'm just

97
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,840
going to pull this mulch aside it's like

98
00:04:48,360 --> 00:04:53,680
pretty thick and I'm just going to like

99
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,560
make myself a little hole and then I'm

100
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,639
just going to put a little handful of

101
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:58,960
compost in the hole just to make sure

102
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,000
that the plant has like all the

103
00:04:58,960 --> 00:05:04,440
nutrition in there it needs and then I'm

104
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:04,440
going to take my zucchini

105
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:09,160
plant bury him in the

106
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,440
hole and then I just move the mulch kind

107
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,919
of back and that's it so this raised bed

108
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,199
was actually cover cro to mustard which

109
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:25,080
I use to like suppress soilborne

110
00:05:22,199 --> 00:05:28,080
pathogens they suppress like pathogenic

111
00:05:25,080 --> 00:05:30,520
nematodes soil born diseases and

112
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,639
pathogens like uh you know tomato bite

113
00:05:30,520 --> 00:05:33,800
things like that so I'm just going to

114
00:05:31,639 --> 00:05:35,720
plant these molds into this bed really

115
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:36,960
just like attract pollinators to my

116
00:05:35,720 --> 00:05:38,560
garden and everything I don't really

117
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,960
need them to produce me any sort of

118
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,960
income it's mostly just for my wife and

119
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:43,960
I
