just about the Heat or is there a deeper secret behind their Obsession beyond their love for Spice Chinese Farmers have developed unique methods to cultivate and harvest Chili Peppers how do they grow these vibrant fiery red peppers that spice up millions of meals every day join us as we uncover the Journey of this National Spice from Farm to Table and explore why Chili Peppers have become an Irreplaceable part of Chinese life [Music] spicy the chili growing process begins with selecting highquality seeds these seeds undergo treatments such as soaking in warm water and germination stimulation before being sewn in modern Farms green houses and automated nurseries help control temperature and humidity ensuring uniform and healthy seedling growth seed trays are placed on automated Conveyor Systems that provide precise watering and nutrient distribution this ensures each plant receives optimal conditions for strong development after 20 to 30 days in the nursery seedlings are ready to be transplanted into the fields traditionally Farmers planted chilies by hand but today automated transplanting machines have revolutionized the process by digging furrows and placing seedlings at consistent intervals covering roots with a thin layer of soil for protection integrating drip irrigation systems to supply water and nutrients automatically optimizing growth with modern technology chili farming has become more efficient increasing yields while conserving water and fertilizer for sustainable [Music] agriculture after 3 to 4 months chilies are ready for Harvest depending on their intended use fresh or dried chilies Farmers choose the most suitable harvesting [Music] method large scale Farms use modern chili harvesting machines to speed up collection these machines either cut the plant or shake it to dislodge the fruits then filter and gather them into containers while this method reduces labor costs it has not yet completely replaced manual labor [Music] for premium chili varieties or when careful selection is required manual harvesting remains essential workers pick each chili by hand to prevent damage to the plant and ensure the highest quality despite advancements in automation manual harvesting continues to play a vital role especially for specialty chilies that require careful handling spicy [Music] after harvesting chilies are

significantly improving both yield and quality onions are cultivated from seeds or bulbs and to ensure uniform growth modern Farms utilize automated seedling systems in specialized greenh houses or nurseries onion seeds are sewn with high Precision using machines allowing seedlings to develop healthily drip irrigation systems and temperature control help maintain stable moisture levels creating optimal conditions for young plants to [Music] [Laughter] thrive once the plants reach a height of around 15 cm they are transplanted into the fields Advanced onion planting machines ensure precise spacing between plants allowing their roots to Anchor firmly into the soil for optimal growth automated irrigation systems continue to provide water and nutrients as needed enabling onions to grow robustly with minimal manual [Music] labor during harvest season instead of relying on labor intensive manual methods large Farms use specialized onion harvesting machines these machines efficiently pull onions from the ground remove excess soil and trim unnecessary leaves the harvested onions are then placed on conveyor belts for sorting packaging and distribution to wholesale markets or processing plants with the support of modern machinery onion farming has become more efficient ensuring the highest quality produce reaches Consumers Electric [Music] truck by combining traditional expertise with modern technology onion farming and harvesting have not only increased productivity but also ensured the highest product quality from vast fields to family dining tables onions are not
