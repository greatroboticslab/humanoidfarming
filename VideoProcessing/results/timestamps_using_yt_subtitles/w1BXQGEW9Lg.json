  "text": "[Music] hello my name is Matt Lacroix I'm the marketing manager for Massey Ferguson hey equipment and if you haven't met the best silage cutter Baylor's in the market let me introduce you to the RB Series loading mesh into your RB series is really easy we have a convenient ladder that folds down you can hop up onto the platform a storage roll goes here and under the side shield here we show that in a minute but to load the mesh all you have to do is flip your mesh over in there now let's go up here and see how the mesh system works so you have your mesh in the holder cradle you flip it over into its working position your out your mesh through these bars and you go across this foam roller here this foam roll or may look like you're gonna take it to a kid's pool actually it has a very good use and what it does it spreads the mesh evenly across the entire Bell width now that we've loaded our mesh the ladder folds about easily with your platform and since safety is always key remember your tailgate shut off valve is here we have it in the lock position now so will not open and close before you unlock it since we're in this area we'll talk about the split gearbox here the split gearbox is original design to us and what it does it evenly transfers the power from your pto to each side of the baler therefore you're equally driven on both sides the pickup on the RB series is very heavy-duty let me show you some key features that makes this a really great pickup so you have a wind guard roller here helps keep that prop mat compressed as you go in and along the wind row we've got offset teeth on the ends now you may ask probably have offset teeth the reason being is we have these augers back here these augers going to move the crop over because the pickup is wider than the bill chamber so it's going to move the crop over so these teeth are offset so it constantly feeds that auger is there waiting to the next set of teeth comes in and from this angle you can see the front of our rotor these are silage cutter round balers so that means the rotor is gonna spin and pull crop across the knives now when we look at service in a little bit we'll get to see a better view of the knives so once you've loaded your mesh upfront you need to put some tension on that mesh so it doesn't free will you can use this handle here and you have two different lobes depending on what size mesh you load into it since these Baylor's are four feet wide you can use a 48 inch or 52 inch these Baylor's hold three rolls of mesh to storage one being used to very unique features of our RB series is protection of your knives when they're engaged also the Hydra flex floor and the drop floor our knives are controlled by hydraulics they're hydraulically controlled up and the hydraulically protected if you come across an obstruction such as a rock in the field as you're going through the field your window may not be perfect even all the way across so you'll have different amounts of crop coming into your pickup that's why we have the hydro flex floor this floor moves up and down as the windrow density changes throughout the field now if you ever do come across an obstruction they cannot fit through there and it gets plugged don't worry no do you get out of the cab from the monitor in the cab you can automatically lower the floor what will happen is the knives will disengage themselves the floor will come down you reengage your PTO the material that is lodged will go into the bell chamber then you raise the floor back up re-engage your knives and away you go all of us have had to dig out of the chamber that's plugged in August and it's super hot this will keep that from happening now I have the tailgate locked out always make sure safety first you lock out your tailgate before you service your knives or any part of your bill chamber as you can see here we have four endless belts for positive traction now let's look into the knives these Baylor's come standard with 17 knives you can engage zero knives eight knives nine knives or 17 now if you want a different combination other than those you have to come back here and manually remove the knives now if for some reason you want to keep the knives out always you can get these optional blanks to put in there let me show you how the process is done to remove your knives slide this back and there's a holder on the front and back as you can see it holds in the front and the rear and the a magnet that holds it and lined up for you and to put a blank in goes in this way this goes on your front bar and once you get on that bar slides in place the RB series comes with 17 serrated knives and since these are serrated if you do need to sharpen them you'd do that from the backside only and I would suggest go ahead and get ordering 17 more knives so you can keep a fresh set with you at all times and there is storage on side the baler for that this is the knife locking handle here it is in the lock position and then we move it to the unlock position to remove the knives when you look at the back of the baler here you may see these circles and wonder what those circles are for when you actually are using these Baylor's in the field you run the tailgate and float the reason we run the tailgate and float is as the bail grows that tailgate sinks down as you can see and it moves down and that keeps constant tension on the springs on the side to keep your chains lubricated we have a reservoir here a pump down here and it automatically pumps oil into your lines we have a combination of brushes and pads on your chains to keep them lubricated and running smoothly to make sure your mesh is applied effectively we have a powered mesh roller so what this does it powers the mesh into the chamber to get it started quickly and effectively while we're here we can also look at our mesh tensioning system there's a couple of changes you can make in here to make your mesh tighter or looser depending on your needs to learn more about the RB series of silage cutter Baylor's or the best-selling hay equipment in the world please visit your local Massey Ferguson or Heston dealer or visit Massey Ferguson us",
