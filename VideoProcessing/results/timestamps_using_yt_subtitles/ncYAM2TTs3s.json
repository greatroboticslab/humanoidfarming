  "text": "generically named computer assistant what is the current temperature right now it's 96 degrees fahrenheit hey it's rob and i'm a sucker for punishment so i am out here in the backyard i have uh received my hopefully last shipment of plants other than one which is coming as a replacement for one that died in the last shipment i want to try and repot these and get them stuck out front i've got seven seven jalapenos and then four more reapers some uh trinidad scorpions and some ghost peppers uh i do have some ghost peppers already i mean these are these are not exotics by any means they're uh they're hot peppers but uh i wanna try and put them in pots and i got some new pots that i want to try are these i think these are the two gallon uh yeah it's hard to tell and it says 105 st so you know i'd say it's a it's a 105 st i have no idea what that means but these might just be the one gallon i am not entirely sure but i think they are big enough for maintaining the root system of a pretty healthily growing pepper plant and i'm gonna try uh you know this is my first time really doing a large pepper grow in pots so we'll see how it works out this is my soil mixing system i have a concrete mixture that i put the dirt and whatever else in and i mix it around for a while make sure that it's pretty thoroughly mixed up and then i can dump it in the weed barrel the wheelbarrow and put it into the pots i know that sounds exciting doesn't it [Applause] that's enough for a pretty decent start on these pots i don't want to take all the soil out of this because i might have more that i'm going to be doing but i just uh when i'm done with it i'll end up putting it back in here until i can get a large you know five gallon pail to be able to store it in one it's got a nice convenient lid that isn't cracked i made that mistake what i want to do with these is fill them up to within about four inches of the top maybe a little bit deeper than that good couple shovelfuls give it a nice bottom a little bit more i'm going to pack this down just a little bit not a lot uh to give it a base for the plants to sit on so i'm going to do this with the first eight already some little plants growing in here this is the easiest way i've found of doing transplants into pots first of all we take the plant that we are transplanting uh these are i got from bonnie plants which are pretty good you want to break up the soil a little bit tease the roots out get them so that they're you know kind of running around in the in the soil a little bit looser and then just pile in dirt around the outside it's so much easier than trying to dig a hole in what was you know in soil that you put in a pot i like to fill these not quite up to the top and make a sort of a moat a little depressive moat around the roots like that keeping the stem and the edges up it helps to you know slice the water in a little bit although it's not that important and of course keep the steaks in so that i know what the what the peppers are because until they start sprouting peppers it's really difficult to tell sometimes they don't want to come out very well oh look at the roots on this one that's lovely and by doing this you're going to do some damage to the roots but they will grow back very well i like to keep these pots uh that the plants came in because they're still in pretty good shape and i can use these for sprouting seeds for next year i am going to need to get more soil because i still have 15 more of these to go 16 if you include the one that's coming all right this is what i've got so far for plants and pots get these growing in here now there is one thing that i don't really like about well a couple things i don't particularly like i do have some growing in in these which have had surprisingly good results over the past few years it's kind of amazing that they don't need nearly as much soil as you think they do although these go down into the dirt i mean they they grow roots down into the soil so they get plenty uh but these guys i have to weed and that's okay it's not a lot but you know it's enough of a pain in the butt because i do have a lot of a lot of pots growing here and then of course there is the uh the in-ground garden now i'm using this uh this house wrap as oh look at the ants i am using this house wrap as a weed block and it's more weatherproof than the normal weed block that you see over there but it really cuts down on the weeding uh there's some stuff that will grow under there creeping charlie in particular but uh you know i've got quite a few plants in here and they are doing quite okay now one of the nice things is i set up this water irrigation system with the soaker hoses and that has done remarkably well in keeping these guys watered right now i've got it i think dialed into about 30 minutes once a day and there are four zones and they all run at different times so it's not over saturating all the soil at one time it's kind of spreading the love i am going to have to do some more weeding in the you know on the periphery and some of that but uh this is i'm not sure what i'm going to do with this yet uh ideally this would go into the territory of a whole house air conditioner but that's probably not going to happen anytime soon so i might end up moving creating a mulch pile back here a compost pile because right now these are my compost bins uh it's all leaves and organic material i mean the tea bags are tea bags are all biodegradable so they will eventually degrade down the little metal staples in there are steel and they will degrade into iron which is actually fairly good for plants it's not in huge huge levels so it's not going to be toxic at all these guys these tall boys are something else i got these from frostbed peppers and he grew them he started them really early i think around uh super bowl weekend i think is when he said he started him so they got a pretty good head start and uh they seem to be doing okay i was a little worried that they might have some issues because they're so tall but they seem to be standing up for themselves pretty well yeah i know there's traffic noise there's not much i can do about it because there are cars on the road i've got 15 more 16 technically to put in pots i'm not going to do it today because i am out of soil to put in the pots i'm going to have to go to the hardware store tomorrow they're closed already it's a little later in the evening so you know a little cooler which is nice but i'm going to try and do those tomorrow weather permitting and see if i can get all of them planted one of the nice things about growing in pots is that as the plants grow bigger i can move them and i can give them more space and i can rotate them around in different areas so that they can get more or less sun as needed uh i don't know this is my first year doing anything quite this big so we're gonna give it a shot and see how it goes anyway uh i'm gonna do the other ones tomorrow i'm not going to do them tonight because it's still pretty freaking hot and i'm tired i'll see you guys next time peace",
