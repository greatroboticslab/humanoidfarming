00:00:05,810 --> 00:00:09,370
So, whether you’re looking for garden tools
for yourself or someone else who may have

2
00:00:09,370 --> 00:00:13,100
some gardening accessibility issues, there
are a variety of tools on the market

3
00:00:13,100 --> 00:00:15,140
these days.

4
00:00:15,140 --> 00:00:20,000
One of the early ones that came out were tools
that had these arched handles to them.

5
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,519
And they give a little bit more leverage for
people who may have arthritis or some mobility

6
00:00:24,519 --> 00:00:26,869
issues in their hands and their wrists.

7
00:00:26,869 --> 00:00:31,220
There are some more tools on the market now
that have a longer handle to them so they

8
00:00:31,220 --> 00:00:35,360
could be used from a wheelchair or from a
standing point.

9
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:39,170
And they also have extendable handles.

10
00:00:39,170 --> 00:00:44,170
There are also some hand tools that you can
use on the ground that will give you accessibility

11
00:00:44,170 --> 00:00:48,730
into shrubbery that’s oftentimes difficult
to get into.

12
00:00:48,730 --> 00:00:54,380
And then we also have watering tools that
will help you reach plants to water them either

13
00:00:54,380 --> 00:00:59,490
from a standing or a sitting position, or
to reach plants that are overhead and to make

14
00:00:59,490 --> 00:01:01,490
sure that you can get water to them.

15
00:01:01,490 --> 00:01:05,880
Many different garden centers will carry different
brands and different accessibility tools,

16
00:01:05,880 --> 00:01:08,119
but you can ask them to shop for them.

17
00:01:08,119 --> 00:01:11,500
We also have a publication that was put together
by one of our retired specialists just a few

18
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:13,350
few years ago.

19
00:01:13,350 --> 00:01:18,460
And if you’re looking for tools for accessibility
you can also order some of them from suppliers

20
00:01:18,460 --> 00:01:19,460
online.

21
00:01:19,460 --> 00:01:24,300
With the university of Wyoming Extension,
I’m Donna Hoffman, From the Ground Up.
