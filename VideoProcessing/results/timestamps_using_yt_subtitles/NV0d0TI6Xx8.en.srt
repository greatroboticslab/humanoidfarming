1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,240
set up with the solar panels. 18 panels,

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:10,440
550 W

3
00:00:05,240 --> 00:00:14,320
each. I show you later equipment I'm

4
00:00:10,440 --> 00:00:15,560
using. Another detail to be off the grid

5
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,880
is

6
00:00:15,560 --> 00:00:20,439
Starlink. We got internet from Starling.

7
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:22,920
Works really

8
00:00:20,439 --> 00:00:25,960
well. Another view of the

9
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:29,960
panels with our

10
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:29,960
amazing view.

11
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:33,279
And there's the

12
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:39,320
ocean. So this is my basic setup. This

13
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:43,800
is 7 kilow

14
00:00:39,320 --> 00:00:47,280
inverter. I have my 10 kW battery

15
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:50,879
lithium. Another one 10 kow battery

16
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:53,120
lithium. So basically 20 kilow. Another

17
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:57,680
interesting fact, we collect rain water

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,680
from our flat roof that goes directly
