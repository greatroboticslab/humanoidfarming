in this episode we're going to talk

3
00:00:05,560 --> 00:00:09,960
about America's favorite vegetable at

4
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:11,759
least to grow in their garden and that's

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,080
the Tomato tomatoes are going to have to

6
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:16,680
be planted after the last frost they do

7
00:00:14,080 --> 00:00:19,560
not tolerate Frost and they really like

8
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:21,880
warm soil and air temperatures the

9
00:00:19,560 --> 00:00:24,560
tomato is Gardener's favorite vegetable

10
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:26,519
to grow for several reasons first off

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,279
they're just downright good to eat they

12
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:30,400
go with many different things in many

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,840
different ways there are literally

14
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:33,559
hundreds of different varieties of

15
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,320
tomatoes there's yellow ones there's red

16
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:37,079
ones and everything in between it's

17
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:39,640
great to can tomatoes and use them all

18
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,480
year long one thing to really remember

19
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:44,399
about tomatoes is they're going to use a

20
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:46,120
lot of water tomatoes need to be watered

21
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,399
deep and they need to be watered pretty

22
00:00:46,120 --> 00:00:50,120
often more often than most other things

23
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,359
and in many places in Wyoming in order

24
00:00:50,120 --> 00:00:54,879
to get a tomato you're going to have to

25
00:00:52,359 --> 00:00:56,800
either start the seed inside or buy

26
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,120
pretty big bedding plants when you when

27
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,199
you go to plant your garden when we uh

28
00:00:59,120 --> 00:01:02,879
talk about how productive the tomato is

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,720
you can see here these tomato plants

30
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:07,479
have cages around them um these tomatoes

31
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,040
are going to grow up and these these

32
00:01:07,479 --> 00:01:10,560
cages are going to support them because

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:12,640
there's going to be hopefully so many

34
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:15,240
tomatoes on there that will need that

35
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:17,479
support of course in my family it's just

36
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,920
hasn't been summer until we pick a pick

37
00:01:17,479 --> 00:01:21,320

38
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,240

39
00:01:21,320 --> 00:01:24,960
