1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,380
is are you rolling is this rolling is

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:06,380
this are we on TV right now is this live

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,880
this broken wire right here is totally

4
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:13,380
my fault but this is small potatoes

5
00:00:11,880 --> 00:00:15,660
compared to this other gentleman that

6
00:00:13,380 --> 00:00:18,060
emailed me recently he's got a broken

7
00:00:15,660 --> 00:00:20,880
tractor for sale so this guy here that's

8
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:23,640
my problem okay so I installed a summit

9
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,260
diverter on here a few years ago and um

10
00:00:23,640 --> 00:00:27,599
I don't know what the heck I was doing

11
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:28,800
but I did not strap that thing up and

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,320
kind of secure it the way that I should

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,920
have and so that cable that wire was

14
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,380
hanging down and at some point recently

15
00:00:34,920 --> 00:00:39,420
they got snagged and it tore right off

16
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:42,360
so I've got a repair job to do on the

17
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,460
1025r and so this is a crazy one of

18
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,020
those things that just happens that

19
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,480
you just can't plan for this kind of

20
00:00:46,020 --> 00:00:49,980
thing right and so this gentleman emails

21
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,620
me and says hey

22
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:55,559
I've got a tractor ran away down a hill

23
00:00:52,620 --> 00:00:57,360
rammed into a tree both the rear axles

24
00:00:55,559 --> 00:00:59,340
are broken off of it

25
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:00,960
he was able to get a brand new tractor

26
00:00:59,340 --> 00:01:02,820
and take his loader and swap it out to

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,140
the brand new 1025r he still loves a

28
00:01:02,820 --> 00:01:06,960
1025r

29
00:01:04,140 --> 00:01:09,119
but now he's got a tractor that's kind

30
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,740
of in pieces and shambles only 280 hours

31
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,659
on it you know and I've had some of my

32
00:01:10,740 --> 00:01:14,880
own pain over the years especially back

33
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:16,680
when I I bought and sold a lot of used

34
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,439
equipment I I've mentioned this story

35
00:01:16,680 --> 00:01:22,200
before the John Deere 2320 and you know

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,659
I own that machine for like an hour's

37
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:25,860
worth of time on it and you know kind of

38
00:01:24,659 --> 00:01:27,360
went through checked everything out

39
00:01:25,860 --> 00:01:29,460
everything was good to go a customer had

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,200
come and actually handed me a check and

41
00:01:29,460 --> 00:01:33,659
purchased that tractor but he couldn't

42
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,579
pick it up for a while like a week or

43
00:01:33,659 --> 00:01:37,140
something until he was in his new place

44
00:01:35,579 --> 00:01:38,880
or had a trailer or whatever it was so

45
00:01:37,140 --> 00:01:40,560
anyway I was just moving that piece of

46
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:42,420
equipment around to get it out of the

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,220
way when all of a sudden it stopped

48
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:46,439
working

49
00:01:44,220 --> 00:01:48,780
if you know the 2320 and a couple other

50
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:51,000
models as well that U-joint back there

51
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:53,040
on the on the drive shaft will go there

52
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:55,079
weren't um instructions on how to grease

53
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,060
that or that you needed to grease it uh

54
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,220
there weren't zerks on the earlier

55
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,740
generation of the earlier model years of

56
00:01:59,220 --> 00:02:04,920
that and anyway catastrophic failure

57
00:02:01,740 --> 00:02:08,280
sheared off inside the transaxle housing

58
00:02:04,920 --> 00:02:10,140
about a 4 500 repair a thousand of that

59
00:02:08,280 --> 00:02:12,239
which was parts and the rest was Labor

60
00:02:10,140 --> 00:02:14,760
to disassemble and then reassemble and

61
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:17,819
so for me I weighed both options I

62
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,560
weighed paying the 4 500 to fix that and

63
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,620
then sell it and get whatever I could

64
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:25,200
out of it or discounting the price down

65
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:27,840
and selling it as is and and kind of

66
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,819
fingers crossed hoping for somebody I I

67
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,680
positioned it in a way that is this is a

68
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:33,060
great deal I made it enticing enough to

69
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,459
be a great deal for somebody who is

70
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:37,140
Handy and has the time to pay just a

71
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:39,000
thousand dollars in parts and then

72
00:02:37,140 --> 00:02:41,400
there's that Gap there right there's a 3

73
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,379
500 that's kind of

74
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:45,959
flexible right how much is your time

75
00:02:43,379 --> 00:02:47,819
worth and and so essentially I lost less

76
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,980
money selling it in as is condition

77
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:51,900
versus if I would have

78
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,400
had it all fixed and sold it in fully

79
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:54,840
working condition I just disclosed

80
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:56,400

told them I kind of help him

93
00:03:15,300 --> 00:03:18,840
um get rid of the the broken tractor on

94
00:03:17,400 --> 00:03:19,980
however he decides to sell it now if I

95
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:21,420
don't respond to you and it's down the

96
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,040
road in the future sometime I mean this

97
00:03:21,420 --> 00:03:24,720
is going to sell pretty quickly okay

98
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,120
whether he sells the whole thing off or

99
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,180
sells it in Parts but so don't take

100
00:03:27,120 --> 00:03:32,760
offense of that this is this is a end of

101
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:34,680
2022 time frame right now so if you

102
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,980
email me in 2024

103
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:40,260
it's long gone okay but anyway

104
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:42,480
his repair unlike mine that was forty

105
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,159
five hundred dollars was eleven thousand

106
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,080
five hundred dollars

107
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,900
three pair the rear end of this tractor

108
00:03:46,080 --> 00:03:50,040
eleven thousand five hundred dollars I I

109
00:03:48,900 --> 00:03:51,540
almost can't believe that and I don't

110
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:53,340
know the breakdown between the parts and

111
00:03:51,540 --> 00:03:54,599
the labor but um

112
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:57,299
that's like

113
00:03:54,599 --> 00:03:59,220
that's like I don't know 70 or something

114
00:03:57,299 --> 00:04:01,080
the cost of the base the base tractor

115
00:03:59,220 --> 00:04:03,840
itself uh

116
00:04:01,080 --> 00:04:05,819
that's outrageous anyway so you know he

117
00:04:03,840 --> 00:04:07,140
asked what what he should do right just

118
00:04:05,819 --> 00:04:08,700
looking for just looking for people's

119
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:09,900
opinions and so I said well I mean the

120
00:04:08,700 --> 00:04:12,180
easiest thing would be to sell it just

121
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:13,500
as is when one lump sum and to sell it

122
00:04:12,180 --> 00:04:14,879
off and explain what the issue is and

123
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:16,560
what the estimated repairs are and if

124
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,959
you can get a breakdown on the cost for

125
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:20,579
parts versus labor then again you can

126
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,860
kind of do what I did and maybe we can

127
00:04:20,579 --> 00:04:24,540
minimize your losses there I think if

128
00:04:22,860 --> 00:04:26,940
you wanted to maximize the amount of

129
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:28,560
Revenue he could get out of it he could

130
00:04:26,940 --> 00:04:30,300
scavenge the whole thing right just

131
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:33,600
separate out the wheels and the tires he

132
00:04:30,300 --> 00:04:36,780
could even take the hood the seat the

133
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,919
three-point arms just what is this a

134
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:39,919
public PSA

135
00:04:41,880 --> 00:04:46,139
three-point arms okay if you guys are

136
00:04:43,560 --> 00:04:48,840
buying a used John Deere one series with

137
00:04:46,139 --> 00:04:50,580
a backhoe on it make sure you get the

138
00:04:48,840 --> 00:04:51,840
three-point arms with it because they

139
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:54,120
are a

140
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,500
they're a fortune to get if you have to

141
00:04:54,120 --> 00:04:57,000
get Replacements so they're not going to

142
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:59,699
be on the three-point hitch if you have

143
00:04:57,000 --> 00:05:01,680
the backhoe on here they come off so ask

144
00:04:59,699 --> 00:05:03,360
whoever you're buying it from if they

145
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:05,580
have the three-point arms that go along

146
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,979
with it and if they don't

147
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:09,840
find out how much it currently costs and

148
00:05:07,979 --> 00:05:11,580
negotiate that into the deal but anyway

149
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:12,419
most folks don't want to go through that

150
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,040
right they don't want to have to deal

151
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:15,360
you weren't planning on you're not

152
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:16,680
looking to become a junkyard right and

153
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:18,780
scavenge things off and sell them on

154
00:05:16,680 --> 00:05:20,460
eBay or Facebook Marketplace one by one

155
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:21,960
so that's what I would do but I thought

156
00:05:20,460 --> 00:05:23,880
it's worth talking about number one

157
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,500
because I don't really know where

158
00:05:23,880 --> 00:05:27,720
there's many tractor graveyards around

159
00:05:25,500 --> 00:05:29,639
there especially for newer

160
00:05:27,720 --> 00:05:31,919
you know I don't know I mean 2000 year

161
00:05:29,639 --> 00:05:33,479
2000 and newer tractors I don't know if

162
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,620
there's enough of them that are out

163
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,840
there because most of them are probably

164
00:05:34,620 --> 00:05:39,539
still in existence you see you know the

165
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:41,759
old stuff right you know from the 30s

166
00:05:39,539 --> 00:05:42,960
40s 50s 60s all that kind of thing but

167
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:44,639
the new stuff you don't really see any

168
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,139
of that but if there's if there's a

169
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:47,880
location out there or multiple locations

170
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:49,500
that are great resources for folks to

171
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:51,479
find replacement parts

172
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:53,340
you know it's a new wheel from a scrap

173
00:05:51,479 --> 00:05:55,320
yard from something that got rolled or

174
00:05:53,340 --> 00:05:57,539
whatever that'd be great information for

175
00:05:55,320 --> 00:06:00,060
folks to know so leave a comment down

176
00:05:57,539 --> 00:06:01,860
below well anyway I figure I I suppose I

177
00:06:00,060 --> 00:06:04,020
should tell you what happened and so I

178
00:06:01,860 --> 00:06:05,880
had to ask him to get more detail and uh

179
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:07,199
pretty pretty simple story really he

180
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:09,180
says we were blowing leaves with the

181
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,860
tractor the operator backed up to align

182
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,199
with the Royal to use and when he went

183
00:06:10,860 --> 00:06:15,840
to the forward pedal the axle broke and

184
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,240
away he went like down the hill I guess

185
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:19,740
I am curious if he was sitting on the

186
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,300
tractor this whole time that would be

187
00:06:19,740 --> 00:06:22,740
really crazy he says I wish I could have

188
00:06:21,300 --> 00:06:24,120
figured out why this happened or what I

189
00:06:22,740 --> 00:06:26,400
may have done to cause it he sends

190
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:28,199
another photo showing the oil trail from

191
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,419
the point of failure when the axle broke

192
00:06:28,199 --> 00:06:33,360
so like up on top of the hill one of the

193
00:06:30,419 --> 00:06:35,819
axles broke off at that point

194
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:37,440
went down the hill whacked a tree and

195
00:06:35,819 --> 00:06:38,580
the other one broke off folks we are

203
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:53,100
keeping those rear tires planted on the

204
00:06:50,580 --> 00:06:54,720
ground it helps us loader efficiency and

205
00:06:53,100 --> 00:06:56,699
traction too the benefits of rim guard

206

thousand dealers Nationwide find the

212

dealer near you at rimguardsolutions.com

213
00:07:06,900 --> 00:07:11,100
anyway so to sum it up he says this

214
00:07:08,940 --> 00:07:12,539
tractor was serviced regularly as stated

215
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:15,000
in the owner's manual and was in great

216
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:17,340
condition with 280 hours oh it was a

217
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:19,139
2013 model year and it does have a 60

218
00:07:17,340 --> 00:07:20,759
inch mower deck with it as well so I

219
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,259
actually look to see if it might have

220
00:07:20,759 --> 00:07:24,060
had wheel spacers on it because that's

221
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,880
always an interesting topic of

222
00:07:24,060 --> 00:07:29,520
conversation on you know how much the

223
00:07:26,880 --> 00:07:31,860
the spacers really stress the rear axles

224
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,060
there's no wheel spacers on that of

225
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,699
course it just seemed to be some sort of

226
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:37,080
fluke accident that happened there I do

227
00:07:35,699 --> 00:07:38,699
feel like eleven thousand five hundred

228
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:41,400
dollars is

229
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:43,020
is Extreme I don't know maybe I I'm just

230
00:07:41,400 --> 00:07:45,060
not up with the times right now but that

231
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:46,500
seems like highway robbery to replace

232
00:07:45,060 --> 00:07:47,940
that rear end

233
00:07:46,500 --> 00:07:49,440
um so yeah

234
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:51,360
take that for what you will I thought

235
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:52,740
that was a just one of those things that

236
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,780
happens right and I don't know maybe

237
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:56,099
Insurance hopefully insurance covered

238
00:07:54,780 --> 00:07:57,539
that for him

239
00:07:56,099 --> 00:07:59,759
good question for homeowners insurance

240
00:07:57,539 --> 00:08:01,620
policies to to see what is covered on

241
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:03,720
there for completely freak accidents

242
00:08:01,620 --> 00:08:05,160
like that that happen but again I'd like

243
00:08:03,720 --> 00:08:07,919
to know

244
00:08:05,160 --> 00:08:09,360
where do you go to find a new hood for

245
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:10,919
your tractor right I mean I I've seen

246
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,539
them on eBay I mean you can get you can

247
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:13,919
get them from Deer right but if you're

248
00:08:12,539 --> 00:08:15,900
you're always looking for cheaper

249
00:08:13,919 --> 00:08:17,580
alternatives and there'd be a great a

250
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:19,440
great demand for that I have to assume

251
00:08:17,580 --> 00:08:21,900
out there if there was something well

252
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:24,180
known and Consolidated for folks to go

253
00:08:21,900 --> 00:08:27,000
