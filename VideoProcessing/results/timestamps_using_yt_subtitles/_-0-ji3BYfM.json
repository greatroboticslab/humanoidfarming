  "text": "[Music] there's a little bit about my farm i'm located in central iowa about halfway to [Music] um iowa least four acres of land i have about two acres in production and animal production um i sell maybe december and my main business is csa i used to do in person farmers markets i shipped it to online what i call online farm stand which is selling directly to my website and then i do some online consumer co-ops and increasingly entering more wholesale i've been growing for 10 years i also worked for three years on a certified organic farm in heritage which is very close to where i now farm and i'm not currently certified but i am depending on certifying this season and i've always been organically managed familiar with organic standards and i've always tried to follow those uh just some pictures of the farm and this kind of shows i'm going to talk about the different parts of our farm how we manage them we have high tunnels that we manage in a certain way we have uh what i would call more intensive market garden style beds that we manage in a certain way and then we have more uh what i might call like broad acre plasticulture that is that we use so those are all parts of our rotation and cropping system [Music] this past year um so i feel like it's always good to start off a presentation with some disclaimers about what i can what information i can and can't give you um so this is just what i've worked on on farm so far and this system will continue to evolve without seeing how much has evolved into 10 years i've been farming and so obviously all systems are subject to revision over time obviously you can't take the system on one part and draft it on your own personality into lots of different things and what i found is that even small variations in location and climate and soil type can make huge differences in whether a production system is going to work for you or not it's obviously something that works in northern minnesota may not work in central iowa but even something that works in northeast iowa may not work in central iowa so that's don't take any sort of production system and think well this is it because you have to then adapt it to your particular circumstances which are always going to be different and then this is something that i feel like i kind of started to learn at this conference and i'm going to talk about that on the next slide but don't let the perfect be the end really good so i think with crop rotation especially early on i thought i'd have to have a set propertization i haven't had this figured out right away and the truth is that most most farms do not have their crop rotation figured out and that they're changing it over time and that's not a problem it's like you're slowly moving towards your goals and so there's always going to be a gap between your plans and your actual like you know live reality and that's not a problem that's just normal um and i went to a presentation by k jensen here that was probably probably 10 years ago around the time i was trying to farm and she mentioned this idea of the fibonacci spiral so like progress is not linear we tend to think of progress of just being a line or we just move from a to b but actually if our goal is the center of that spiral we're kind of spiraling in towards that goal and so she gave the example of you know day one when you start your farm you're not gonna necessarily have like written standard operating procedures for your workers you know that's not necessarily a realistic goal for like the first day you start farming but maybe by like 10 years you might have that so it's just a good way to think about especially if you're starting out that you're not gonna you're not gonna have things perfectly set from the start you're gonna have to figure things out as you go so i feel like it's always good to sort of interrogate the assumptions that we're thinking you know obviously in organic standards you're supposed to rotate crops so i understand that but you know the question is and it's everyone's favorite answer which is yes or no because i think there's circumstances where we don't rotate rocks and there are circumstances where we do and i think in particular almost no one rotates crops in high tunnels even in organic systems most organic growers i know are growing tomatoes in their high tunnels every single year which is not what you're supposed to do but they're still doing it and so why does it still work well disease pressure builds up over time so growers are usually using greenhouse specific hybrid varieties that are very disease resistant people are moving into grafting in order to deal with disease pressure um and i've also heard that you know you can do that for like 10 to 15 years and then after that point it starts to get more difficult where you can start to see like depletion in your soil that maybe is not apparent at first so um so obviously the most immediate reason why we rotate crops is because because of disease and soil-borne pest carriers year-to-year that's at least you know on my farm that's my my immediate concern when i'm thinking about where do i put my broccoli this year it's i don't want to carry over the black rot from last year's broccoli to into this year's broadway um and i just want to throw out there that you know i've been exposed to this conference and others about new ideas around you can actually prevent disease and pest pressure um if you build up the biological activity your soil and you have complete nutrition for your plants and i i think we're all kind of trying to work towards that but it's not necessarily a realistic again it's not a realistic goal from day one to have that in the situation so we're all still dealing with these disease and pest problems and so yes we need to continue to rotate um so i think the big considerations for crop rotation are our timing so i think rotating differently times gas crops so is it an early crop is it a mid-season crop is it a lake crop how far through the season does it go what kind of window is there for a cover crop before or after that and how will that influence what you can have there afterwards so for example if you have an early crop and then you plant an overwintering cover crop there you probably don't want to have another early crop there in the next year because you're going to have rye or something you're going to determine in the spring so the sequencing of how you see these cash crops and color crops and being able to alternate timing is part of what you're thinking about with the crop rotation um and then there's obviously the fertility the soil the wheat consideration so um there's the whole schematic of heavy feeder light feeder legumes so you have certain types of crops that use a lot of nitrogen certain type of process you can use a little bit of nitrogen and then crops that produce their own and now that's not a realistic rotation for most of us because most of us are you know way over representation of the heavy meters um particularly we always talk about processors always being overrepresented in a lot of vegetable complications so we're obviously not going to grow like equal amounts of each of those but it's something to think about um i think of another considerations that are there's crops that are easy to eat and crops are hard so like carrots and onions our crops are very susceptible to early deep pressure so you probably don't want to put those in your medius field you know you want to think about what was the wheat seed load like there last year did i let a lot of wheat seed fall on the ground that last year probably i don't want to put my carrots there this year versus potatoes that's an easier crowd controlled builds in a little bit more tolerant of weeds so those are things to think about [Music] so this is a this is a map of my farm that we i think this particular map we actually drew up this past year and this shows our field system and kind of how we how our farm is set up and how we rotate through these different fields so uh just to show you the what's called the short fuel north shore south those are what i call the market garden intensive production type bed so those are 100 feet long they're uh the beds are four feet to four and a half foot on the center um we tend to manage those by hand generally like in terms of work we do no-till on these beds which i'll talk a little bit more about we tend to use the bcs walk-behind tractor for preparing the soil although i am increasingly setting them up for tractor um spacing um and they're bare soils we manage them as air soil and then we also grow crops that are higher value and higher turnover in those beds the long field west longfield east and the far field those are set up uh for tractor cultivation and they're set up for laying plastic mulch and so they're longer those are 265 or 270 footbeds so i kind of have a hybrid system on our farm where we have both what i would call like intensive market garden style production and we also have what i would call more like a broad anchor um glass culture tractor rototiller peg system so as i mentioned in the short beds we do shorter maturity higher value props so lettuces spinach carrots beets um things that we can double crop so our goal with that is to get two crops a year at least it's not free um so there tends to be a higher labor input per crop because we're going in there and we're cultivating my hand and we're playing compost potentially so there's a higher labor involve a line to get a higher higher revenue in those in those fields we tend to use compost as the basis for our fertility so we're laying a significant amount of compost and that's part of what we can do with our no-till trial that hannah and i did over the last few years where we actually tested out no-till management versus prototype management and i did that in these heads and so as part of that we were laying down really thick layers of compost and you're using that as the basically a mulch that we're then planting into without rototilling um we usually use overhead irrigation in this in this section and that's partly because we're doing a lot of hand cultivation and if you have irrigation and you can cultivation it's really really annoying to have to work around your irrigation or have to move it out of the way and move it back so we moved to doing overhead irrigation in this in this area that also really helps to germinate in sea so like carrots in particular we've had really two really dry summers and both those summers i've germinated my carrots entirely in irrigation whereas in the past i germinated those with rainfall and so that's been a really big part of being able to control more of our seed germination especially in that summer summer window and as i mentioned we do we control back hands we use a lot of wheel hoes we've set up our spacing so that we can use different types of wheel hose um you know so we tend to do things on two or three rows mostly so that our spacing is sort of standardized and it's easy for us to go into the wheel hose and just will hold the entire field so with the long beds uh longer maturity lower value crops i'm going to show a crop list in my next slide with potatoes um brassicas broccoli brussels sprouts um onions garlic we look at that as we're trying to get a single cash crop and a single cover crop per season so we're trying to basically rotate cash crop cover crop cash drop cover crop and so the cover crops are the basis of our fertility in those fields we're looking to use those rather than compost or something to recycle nutrients into the soil um and so we do use plastic mulch in those fields i don't i'm not set up for cultivation i don't have a cultivated tractor um i have one tractor that i use um where the only cultivation i can do is blind cultivation so it's not very good for actually green crops i can weed the tire traps between the plastic beds but that's a big reason why we use plastic mulch that's not something i necessarily seem to be a practice that we use forever but i have to get to the point where i have the hopefully the experience to be able to get rid of it in those beds we use drip irrigation because we just put them under the plastic bed we lay them at the same time as the plastic mulch and then like i said we'll use the tractor to cultivate the tire tracks between the plastic we'll also do those vultures within them entire cracks so landscape fabric straw mulch or we'll use wheelholes so the picture on the left is our that's germinated carrots like sometime in august and so that's our 100 foot beds you know the more intensive market garden style production and then on the right that's um we're harvesting over winter onions fresher onions in june and so there's also you can see there's garlic and onions on either side of my workers there um and so those are the plastic beds and that's going to take a look at how those two different types of fields look so these are this is the kind of the this is the traditionally then our process i say traditionally is in the last few years this has been what we've rotated through those different beds so as i said we cluster crops so we could grow certain types of crops in the short beds and then we grow a certain type of crops in the long beds um and so as i mentioned the short beds the emphasis is on shorter season generally things that are 60 days no more than 60 days would be you know green beans and some of these things are a little bit longer than that but the idea is that we could grow two of these crops in a season um and then the long beds the goal is just to only get a single crop per year remove the plastic and put cover crop down or have cover crop and then fill that in plastic so one of the big changes we're making this year is we're really tearing down what we're growing um we're trying to increase the amount of diversity of props that we're growing and really focus on the crops that we feel like we grow well have a good demand for them and we can actually grow profitably because we've been dropping crops from our acropolis so the bolden ones and the ones are still growing and they're the ones that are not molded are the ones we decided to drop and by drop i mean we're just not growing them at all or we may be buying them from another producer who has a better system than us so for example getting sweet potatoes from someone who grows like six acres of sweet potatoes they've got tractor systems set up for planting and cultivating they just have a much better system than us and so it doesn't really make sense for us to try to get sweet potatoes given our scale you know equipment so that's this is an evolving part of our farm um but this is just kind of showing you what we're still growing and what we what we've dropped um it does make crop rotation a little bit more challenging um in some ways because we're growing larger amounts of fewer crops and so we've got bigger blocks of products to rotate through the field versus having more diversity that we can rotate smaller groups of crops in the field but what we're looking at is this is kind of how i look at crop rotation we have we have families of crops that we rotate through and this largely has to do with disease you know there's a disease that affects certain families like for example black rot is a disease that affects the brassica family it doesn't affect cucurbits it doesn't affect aluminum um so that's largely what's that based around it's also based a little bit around uh fertility for example so like you know there's similar fertility needs within the nebraska family and similar fertility means within the carrot family um so that is another part of why those are clustered together but when i'm looking at actually making a map of the field and like where things are going to go this is how i'm clustering things and then within each of those clusters i might say okay the property's going to go exactly here the potatoes are going to go exactly here but the first step is just kind of figuring out what block of crops is going to go [Music] and i would say it's more important than the long beds that kind of rotation or really mapping that out with the short beds it tends to be because there's so much turnover in those beds it's a little bit harder to have a set rotation plan for those beds so i still think that through but it's a little bit more fluid in those heads than it is with the long range so and then just to mention the high tunnel so um i have one 30 by 96 high tunnel and so we rotate that we have basically three seasons in that tunnel we have a spring season where we plan you in the next few weeks [Music] typically we plant spinach and lettuce although we do also um sometimes plant arugula and kale and then in the summer we have tomatoes in there generally just tomatoes i also have tried other crops in there and they try other crops in the future but generally it's just tomatoes and then in the fall we'll rip out the tomatoes and we plant spinach and lettuce and then we generally will harvest that up through december and then the spinach will harvest these in january and february so that's kind of the rotation that we have in the high tunnels you can see it's not a it's the same props every year and so part of the problem is with having only one high tunnel it's difficult to have an actual rotation um so i'm hoping over the years to add tunnels and to be able to do more rotation and then having more tunnels would also allow us to potentially have a fallow period so for example we could take one funnel uh let's say they're like three combos we take one tunnel every year we can just grow a cover crop in there so to give it a rest to break up disease cycles break up with cycles um but currently you have only one tunnel we're doing this it's working so far i mentioned there's some pitfalls to that but i'll kind of cross that bridge when i come to it so um so these are the crop families that were rotating in the tunnel you know functionally we're really just rotating lettuce spinach and nightshade and like i said with the tomatoes we're just growing the tomatoes in the same same place um this is just a schematic that i came up with recently to show how we flip the tunnel from one season to another so on the left what you're seeing is this is what it looks like when we have small we have fall and spring greens in the tunnel and so the black strips are landscape fabric and then the green strips are the planted bed and then kind of each row in this spreadsheet is a foot so you see it's 30 feet so this is flipping across the tunnel and so you can see on the edges we have three foot fabric along the edges that's kind of a permanent walkway some growers like grow all the way up to the edges of the tunnel i'm six foot eight it's really hard for me to put right up against the edge of a tunnel and so i like to have a walkway where they can walk all the way around um and then you can see we have the four foot beds and we plant with a paper pot transplanter and that's how we planned our lettuce and spinach so we do six rows on a four foot wide bed which is about eight or nine inches between row it's about as close as you can get the paper pot transplanter between just going down the bed and then we actually generally remove the landscape fabrics we just have a one foot bare soil bed or sorry parasol pathway between the beds that will just wheel hoe for re-control okay so that's fall and spring when we flip into our summer production which is tomatoes we roll out landscape fabric onto those pathways and so we roll it right over the center of the pathway and so we're covering that one foot pathway plus we're covering a foot on either side and so we're narrowing our beds down to two feet wide now so two foot wide stretch and that's where we're planting our tomatoes and most recently we've been planting them in a single row and doing a dump and training into a double leader so we have a single row tomato space one foot apart with a double leader going to a wire that runs the wire would run like right here and right here so right along the edges of the bed running all the way down the length of the high tunnel and so we're training the tomatoes up to that wire um i think that i'm what i'm going to do this year is i'm actually going to do a double row of single leaders because i think i might have basically i think the system i've been using is more for a grafted tomato and i'm not grafting and so i'm moving more towards a double row single liter so i'll be planting instead of planting the tomatoes right down the center i'll be planting them like in a diamond style on either side so they'll be more directly above the wire and then when we flip back into fall production we rip out the tomatoes we take out the landscape fabric usually we irrigate because the soil is quite dry at that point and it's been compacted from us walking up and down the pathways and then we'll broad fork lay down a bunch of compost and then we'll plant our our lettuce and spinach into that and so we've been managing the high tunnel no-till for the last several years but i think it's working really well any questions so far about uh about this or anything else that i've talked about we'll also leave time for questions at the end i probably like shouldn't be showing this from a book but i got this from i got this from andrew medford's book just to show you this is where i got this system from so if you're interested in that i don't know if they have that in the bookstore but you can go check it out but basically showing you how to do this for a bunch of different crops but um so why when you say you think that's for granted can you explain a little bit more of why is it the field it's that the tomato basically doesn't have enough um doesn't have enough productivity to maintain two stems because it will go with grafted varieties it's got much stronger root stock and so it has a stronger root system so it can really produce on two statins and from conversations about the growers and actually if you read the recommendations that's exactly what he said i just kind of skipped over that and so i'm going back to what the recommendation is which if you're not grafting do a single leader because the plant will be able to produce more fruit on that single stem versus if you're trying to train into two stems you're kind of like overtaxing the pumpkin it's like my understanding unless it's crafted so yeah so when you're pulling out the tomatoes and then you kind of pull that landscape fabric off and you're going back into your fall production you said you're using a paper pot transplanter yeah so what are you doing beyond broad forking to prep the planting area in a way that's adequate for the paper pod transplant so yeah the the sequence is i'm remembering it correctly the sequence is we irrigate then we broad fork and then we lay down the compost and then we will either wheel hoe or tilt to use the filter to basically get enough um you have to basically get enough loose soil to be able to run the paper transplanter and i run the vapor pods transplanter on the on the shallowest depth i found that works best especially in the dovetail system because if you run it on a deeper depth of shoe that's just going to catch any quads that are going to be you know underneath there um so that's worked for us some sort of tool to ensure that those paper tops are varied if you're putting them in shallow as you are usually we just we do it as a two-person team and so like others run the paperclock transplant and then someone will just come behind me and they'll just kind of kick soil in around there or use their hands yeah so that's just what that looks like um what the high tunnel looks like with the landscape fabric with the tomatoes in a single row we did some inter planting of beneficial plants of borage marigold basil some other things in there so that's interesting but there's some weeds in there too and we run a double drip tape right along the uh the tomatoes and i just like the double fit that it just gets more water down to work with me and so you can see we use the tama hooks which we don't actually use that system to actually like lower in the tomatoes but i like that for just being able to get it on the wire easily and then we use the plastic tomato clips and we come in and we'll prune the lower parts of the tomato um and we'll prune off any suckers so we're just training the tomatoes to two and like i said i'm going to go to just training under the single deer um and then you know we're pruning kind of throughout the season usually up until about harvest time and then we kind of run out of time and stop pruning at a certain point but it's to just increase the airflow and make sure that it's not a jungle in there um the last farm i worked on we would kind of stop cooking in like may and so you would go in there and it would be like going into it into a jungle and it would be extremely humid and hot and covered in tomato pollen so i try to avoid that but but the pruning labor is sometimes difficult to balance with everything else we're trying to do on the farm and then this is what it looks like in the spring or fall configuration this is this this ball um so you can see there's roughly half spinach and half lettuce i've got some kale in there i'm gonna stop doing kale because we don't plant it early enough to actually get good yield from that we would need to plant it probably in late august or early september to really get nice-sized plants and so i plan to end up planting it too late and these have small kale plants that they don't produce but spinach and lettuce work really well in the window that we make planting which is generally we're planting the end of september or early october so we're ripping out those tomato plants and like mid to late september and then we're replanting in the fall greens in late september early october and then our aim is to have greens in november which is around the time that we have to stop harvesting outdoors so we try to harvest outdoors as long as possible and then we move so with your pathways being so narrow um are you starting at one end and harvesting down yeah no we don't do like the pac-man style or like plant the whole tunnel out um so we do have the pathways to walk down um in this plant the plant grows a little bit into the bed sort of the pathway and even though you're not going to walk into that function of the pathway of the more like 18 inches you know between plants um but yeah it's a little bit difficult with like getting a harvest so generally we kind of harvest and then we're dragging the tote over what we just harvested you know because it's actually hard to get our toes down the pathway itself but it is a little awkward we have hoops in here too and the hoops get in the way so it's always a little bit a little bit awkward harvesting in this kind of style but we want to maximize the non-drawing area i haven't yet found the motivation to try to move towards that kind of pac-man style which is what that means is people plant the entire tunnel like wall to wall there's no pathways and then you just harvest your way through the tunnels you just walk over what you've harvested and that's the way exactly is as many greens as possible into the high tunnel space um so some of the challenge crop rotation i think just growing different amounts of the different families like brassicas are always over represented on those special farms so it's always hard to rotate frosted with other other things and not and try to not grow rosters in the same spot every year um and then like for me my production levels change from every year i mean part of that is you know a beginning farm especially you know as you're growing or as you're changing your markets the amounts you're drawing of things is gonna change and that's gonna that's why that idea that well i'm gonna have a set crop rotation i'm gonna use that well you could have set crop rotation one year and then your market changes or your size changes and you're gonna have to change that um and then i think there's always the unexpected adjustments and it's season for soil conditions we've got to get this in right now and so we're going to plant it somewhere where it maybe wasn't the crop rotation plant but it's just because the soil conditions are right um sometimes you run short on transplants or you know you've planted one less bed of something if you have the transplants so all those things can change um and then i think there's always a question about growing things in blocks so like all the brassicas grow here all the albums grow here versus growing them as a more heterogeneous distribution so like you know sombras is here somehow he's here i think the block system is easier to scheme out it's easier to like plan that way but also you're concentrating potential tests and disease problems in a single block like you're making it very easy for pests to move in and be able to like move from proper topic all the crops in a single family are together um and i'm working in a two-acre field so it's not as though i've literally spread things out that much but even just having something in like for example in that map i showed you in the far field versus in you know the field that's farther um to the west i see differences in how like if i plant my spring cucurbits in one field and i plant my fall compared in another field it takes a while for them to move from from crop to crop so for example like they basically will destroy the spring zucchini and cucumber talking about cucumber wheels and squash bugs and then once that crop is destroyed or i've ripped it out and then they moved to the next one whereas if they were right next to each other i don't know if that would happen i think they would just spread right between each other um so yeah there's probably more to say about that i think there's also considerations of you know being able to interplant with um beneficials um to break up lots of props which also can complicate your propagation um but these are just some basic principles that i try to follow so i mean at the very least you're not growing the same thing in the same soil every year the high tunnel being the exception um you know at least every other year better yet three years i think it's a minimum there's different recommendations for different diseases and different crops you know some people will say three to five years but in general if you're breaking up a pest or disease cycle over a single year i think that's sometimes that's the best you can do depending on how much space you have um being aware of edges where diseases can transfer so i changed the orientation of my fields so they used to run um east-west and i changed them to running north-south and what that meant was now all my beds for one year ran across the previous year's beds and so like there was no way for me to avoid growing broccoli where i've grown broccoli the previous year and so what i found was that was with a black rock transfer so the end of the bed where where like my current bed crossed the old bed that's where the black rock showed up first and then after that year things got better because like it just was that one year where i changed the orientation of the beds um and then obviously if you have identifiable either or uh pest issues that you know um are a problem on your farm learn about the life cycles of those things it might make sense to for example with black route it makes sense to till in your residue into the soil either that fall or early the next spring because the black rod will carry over on the residue um tillage can also help with some insects that overwinter in the soil so if you till in the fall that's generally good practice but if you have a specific problem you're trying to address it can make sense um and then soil testing every year or every other year is important um and then you can adjust your amendments based on the so if that's in the actual needs of the crops you're drawing so actually understanding you know what a could need what do alligators need what are you currently in trying to advance your soil based on the needs of those crops rather than just having maybe a fertility program that you use for the whole farm without regard to the crops you're growing or the particularities of your fields because i know each of my fields has its own particularities one field is kind of high in phosphorus one field is generally lower in organic matter so knowing what each of your fields what the needs are of each of those fields you can try to address them specifically rather than just kind of using a blanket program to address your whole phone so just to talk a little bit about record keeping and the way i do it um i come up with a crop rotation field plan and i just use spreadsheets for this so i kind of have a spreadsheet that's similar to that map i showed you but it's in the spreadsheet form so like each row is a bed in that system i think i have my screenshot of that next and then i want to have my actual crop planting field map so this is my plan and this is what i actually did um and then that crop planting field map becomes my historical record of propagation so if i have ones that have one of those for each year that i can look back this is what i plan to wear in 2021 this is home 20 on my team so i can make actual crop rotation decisions because if you don't remember where you planted things you can't actually make the proper patient decisions and so this is just what that looks like in the spreadsheet so you can see i just you know taken the columns and merged them across the rows and so each of those each of these columns of the bed and i have a little code you know for the bed so like this is that's long field east between the bed 24 um and then i've got this is actually part of my plan for this year so what prop i'm gonna grow sometimes i'll also put in the cover crop that i'm growing in there but this is the plan and so then i'm going to want to capture the actual planting that i did this year because if i just have the plan and i'm going to plan for next year i don't necessarily know if i actually fall through that plan or not or if i had to [Music] so my farm is humbling and service and decor so this is a picture from our first second in our second hand um and um yeah so our we have a two acre field and it's laid out um in six sections about um can you turn up the volume a little bit please oh i think your um yes so this is a picture of planting garlic um so garlic is our our um we have six sections we're entering into year six of our farm so we'll have gone through every single section um after this year and then we'll be re-restarting and next in 2023 we'll be restarting the cycle so um uh allianz is is our first um first section and so we plant our garlic we plant onions shallots um leeks in this section um it's the least uh it's the least number of beds that we need to use of any section so sometimes we stick in um maybe if you want to plant some corn popcorn or something for fun um we'll we'll throw them in the allium section but otherwise we can cover crop about half half of the section during the year um this picture is actually of our no-till system which we started just a couple years ago we started transitioning our farm to no-till so that means we um this yeah this year with maryland we actually put furrows in our no-till beds and then we covered those once we planted the garlic you covered it with samples and that was our method of covering the furrows and then we mulch after that um but yeah our no-till system is basically complex based we build up a bed um we kind of dig out pathways that we can um that are that are permanent and then we can add compost to the bed and create tilt and uh you hear me um they've been having problems i'll just talk really loud can you hear me in the back great kind of okay i'll be as loud as i can um yeah uh i think that's enough on the no-till situation so um alliums most of them come out of the field pretty early um in in the fall or late summer um and so we are then able to cover crowd almost immediately um uh for development of fall so we either put in oats and peas or a rye veg mixture depending on whether we went to overwinter the crop oh yes i'm back so if if we want a cover crop that's going to extend into the spring and grow in the spring then we use ryan fetch and if we want to be able to work the ground immediately in the spring we use something that winter kills like oats and peas we also are usually able to get a round of buckwheat in um which is a summer scrap and we'll kill we'll die at first frost um we're usually able to get a rabbit buckwheat in after the avalanche yes those are garlic's coming up um so this picture is of our cucurbit section um yeah we follow our alliums with cucurbits and um uh the yeah this picture is basically winter squash um will spread over many beds so we have to think about what we're gonna do with the ground that is in between these um these rows of cucurbits um so that that here this picture is when we planted a bunch of lettuce in between was the procurements before they spread out um so that we could kind of get two different crops out of the same same zone and of course it gets complicated uh like we have you have to get the lettuce out before it starts getting overwhelmed by the um by the vines because otherwise it's really a mess to walk around in there our next zone is roots so roots for us include carrots beets um turnips so a bunch of different crop families um the carrot family and the raspberry family but the turnips are yeah and the um yeah so that's that's an interesting thing because the roots are basically that question is basically about our the way we cultivate the crops the way they're grown the kind of season they have rather than what family they're in um so yeah that that's the way we think about and this this is our brazilian section so it's the most full of any of our sections we fill it up every year with cabbage kale broccoli um collards brussels sprouts and kohlrabi uh and so but i think it's the most beautiful of the sections and again thinking about cover cropping we basically are able to cover crop size by bed so our kohlrabi comes out pretty early in the season and we're able to put in a buffy cover crop um there or we're able to even double crop kohlraki before we don't have the same black problem that yeah so uh we're able to kind of fit things in and then always thinking when we plant our fall cover traps okay it is our next craft going to need to go in in this ring or can it wait until june um and in which case we would plant rye or something that would that would really pump up the organic matter [Music] this is a totally messy messy picture um so our our tomato section we also include our our beans in that section because um they kind of have a similar season we want to we want to plant them after all the insurance rates after the soil's worked up um and we plant several different successions of beans so we've been figuring out just kind of trial and error over the years figuring out ways to kind of manage the architecture i guess of our section so that we can harvest the tomatoes easily and the beans won't be too much in the way so yeah we've started kind of alternating tomatoes and beans to just add more variety and more more kind of ability to move around in that section yes and then the final section is our green section so our lettuce are our uh mustard mixes um our spinach and then we also put our peas in the green section again because they kind of match the timing of beans we [Music] as we need to yeah that's my co-farmer also in the greens section [Music] yeah and this is just a picture of buckmint cover crops surrounding like a weenie parsley patch um just thinking about the yeah the timing of cover cropping is a really interesting question that we're always always working out and making sure everything is accessible and that we can just get as much stuff growing um as we can as possible but um without overwhelming our our ideals yeah and i believe that is it so you have plenty of time for questions yeah how are you breaking down and your cover crops doing complete no-till building yes so the question is how are we breaking down cover crops especially when we're doing no-till agriculture um so um a number of different ways we've tried a number of different ways so we've tried just like pulling them out of the bed like leading them out um which is is not actually as bad as it sounds um but it takes a lot of time um the other big thing that i think both jordan and i are trying is uh silent um and using silent sharks to break [Music] oh down yeah so um yeah i mean i think the way that i've done that is i have a flail mower that goes on a bcs and so i'll flail mow it and then lay the blade the tarp down and you know we've we've talked about this and i talked about this with stylish charts but you don't get all that much residue breakdown we found that's sort of how the charts were sold to us i guess for something new because you get a lot of residue breakdown but i find that's not so much the case it just kind of kills what's there and it will start to decompose a little bit i'm actually interested in possibly using clear plastic to try to get more residue breakdown um but yeah because you don't get the residue breakdown i think that like for me if i want a direct seed or a paper pot into there i need to then like break that residue off or do something with it after i pull the tarp off so um yeah we definitely have just covered the um the bed with um with compost like just like kill it with a silent star peel the cover crop and then just cover the bed of the compost and plant directly into that and yeah we don't use a paper fat transmitter we just transplant by fans but it works for us what have you found for your no cell systems in direct seating is that something that you find that you're able to do or is that kind of uh do you have to transition more heavily into the transplant yeah so my co-farmer manages the direct seating and she hates using cedars she just makes a burrow and direct seeds with her hand into it and so we can do that in the no-till system no problem really um what we have from um we actually found that our examination was best when we would make a furrow and just like the picture with the garlic make a furrow we could see it into it and then we just cover it directly with compost and that wasn't the best germination [Music] um it was really just to orient things more for the tractor because if you have 100 foot beds and turn around doing it with the tractor is is terrible so it was just so i didn't have to do as many turnarounds with the tractor yeah so it wasn't necessarily like oh north south is better it was more just because of the way my fields were oriented yes the question is what's the weak kill like with a silent shirt i mean it kills annual weeds very well i think the issue is typically perennials so like we both have some issues with the thistles hollywood's and wine issues so yeah perennials it does not kill perennials unless you leave it in place for like an entire season so but it will kill that very effectively kills annual weeds the question is it will kill the existing growth but as soon as you pull it off more weeds in germany so like i think sometimes in a tillage situation people will till first and then put the part down because they want to like flush the leaves out um before they tarp because you run in the situation when you kill the existing heat growth but then there's a whole another generation that's just going to come off as soon as it's triggered by pulling off the part so yeah and i'll add that we have a big thistle problem so yeah we found that our annual weed pressure is not as bad in an ocean system because we're using we're using a compost as a mulch but our fissile problem is is hugely just coming back and so we try to tarp kind of any part of the farm that doesn't have something growing on it um in a you know for like a three week chunk of time or more we try to put a tarp on just get those thistles stopped for a second [Music] [Music] i do use dutch white clover in other parts of my farm and that's one oh sorry i do use dutch white clover in other parts of my farm and that's one that i've seen other people use in that situation but i've not personally tried it in my growing beds i use it in my like tractor pathways like my access roads yeah i've also never tried a living mulch other than once i tried some clover and um and a bunch of leaves germinated with it and it just didn't make sense that's what i just wheeled it in but i would love to figure that out yes when you guys use the tarps to suppress the cover crops does the temperature affect the effectiveness of the heart if it's early spring yeah i think there's definitely a heat effect with the tarp that can i think that might have an effect on residue breakdown potentially although i'm saying i'd still be satisfied even in the summer but i think the main way the tarp works is by excluding light so i think in the case of the tarp it's not so much that it's heating up the soil is that it's excluding light which that's what's killing things um with clear plastic it's the it's the heat that is actually killing things and breaking down residue [Music] so when you're doing your craft rotations um in the sections that you're doing double crochet you're rotating at the end of the season right so if you have all of your brackets in one section you know like some of us have longer seasons so if you're double cropping multiple times you're not worried about rotating [Music] into a different section at that point you're so you're kind of looking at it from a season perspective are you both looking at it that way in those sections i definitely am year by year here and nowhere else on the farm yeah when the place that i'm double cropping i'm usually changing families but my understanding is like i kind of had i had this question too it's like is crop rotation always between props or is it just between seasons and i think um i don't know maybe best best practices would be yes between crops but i think there is some leeway where like yes you could rotate like you could grow lettuce twice there might be reasons not to do that for other reasons but like you know in terms of an overall crop rotation i think that's mine if you grow to grow things in the same you grow the same family in the same beds same fields in the same year yeah so you might do multiple crops of salanova in the same bed or you do i haven't done that but it's like it's again like because i want to have flexibility if i have to i try not to i try as best i can to rotate between props as i can and usually i've been able to do that but it is something that i would do if i had to yeah in your greenhouse when you said after tomatoes when you go you bring in a ton of compost how many yards of compost in there what what does a tongue mean yeah yeah so um it's i think it's pretty quantifiable it's um we usually lay about an inch over the top of the soil across the bed surface and we do it we move with a tractor bucket and then we'll dump it into it because we can't put the tractor in the tunnel we dump it into the wheelbarrows so we line up three wheel barrels dump the compost into those three wheel barrels and i'm trying to think i have this written down yeah i think you're using probably three to five bucket loads per day if i remember correctly and in general i think i've quantified it but we end up using about a cubic yard per bed it's in general if we're doing that thick mulch layer so we get it delivered you know 40 basically 40 pound loads and that will cover about 40 degrees yeah that's about the rate we're using to get that one inch thick like heavy mulch yeah um [Music] [Music] um the only answer that i know for pre-wheels is just the row cover because it was right when you land the cross you just cover it and with row cover that doesn't have any holes in it and that it moves the two needles um i'm actually trying to figure out the problem when we row cover um uh for flea beetles and it's often on brassicas that are gonna vote really fast especially with that hot um row cover so that's that's hard to kind of negotiate um but yeah my understanding is if it's a flying insect then unless you're able to isolate long distances it doesn't rotation isn't going to matter for that because the flea bills are just going to find your crop they don't necessarily overwinter in the soil or if they do they'll just come up and find the crop so that is less of a crop rotation issue and like hannah saying it's just more physical exclusion and i think that's the case with other pests like cucumber beetles they're just going to come find your cucurbits it doesn't matter if you rotate them [Music] okay um it's not really rotation related but you were talking about the road cover do you have an issue with it blowing off everybody just secure it or not let it rip yes so how do we secure row cover i um yeah in my obsession with excluding free beetles i have uh gone into burying this the side of the recover um and uh so just like continual dirt on all edges of the row cover um and then the problem is if it's a ruble or something and i'm harvesting multiple times um actually it's like putting it back down um under under that row of dirt um after every harvest yeah the other problem with row cover that i've noticed is that it it creates this microclimate that's really kind of luscious and aphids love it and they get all over the straps and that's kind of gross and i have a question for you where do potatoes and sweet potatoes fit into your location we put potatoes in their tomato section [Music] um one thing i also want to i don't know if the person's own room but i was going to see about how we've done direct seating with no-till so it's similar to what i talked about with the high tunnel where we're trying to get enough tilt to be able to run that paper pot transplanter through and we did have issues where you know the cedar is skipping so we're pushing a seater through the soil it's like hitting a hard hand layer but this year i switched to using a jam seeder and it's a lot heavier and it's been a lot better for no till because it can just kind of plow through sections that where earthway is very light will just kind of skip so that's one thing i found that really helps um with direct seeping into a no-till situation or any kind of situation where you have tighter soil or more residue it's just it's a more robust there's probably some vendors who sell that here that you get okay [Applause] we broadcast our cover crops yeah i i broadcast uh with a little like earthquake chest spreader and then i i have a cold attacker so i generally will pack that in or sometimes i'll disc it in i've also tilled it in too with a rototiller um but uh it's not i'm not wild i would would like a better system because there's a lot of passes over the field it'd be nice to be able to do things in a single pass rather than having to do another pass but [Music] do you guys transplant [Music] the okay is do we transplant into the residue of the cover crop um we would only transplant into the residue of a dead cover crop for sure and we would add um we would add a compost mulch over it so it wouldn't it there would be a lot of tilt of that compost um as we as we transplanted so it wouldn't feel like very residue before i plant because generally i'm not using cover crops in those short beds although i'm kind of moving in that direction and i have to do similar things to what hannah's doing like parking it um yeah so the question is how do we get like brassicas like brussels sprouts or stuff that has heavier salt stocks out of the soil if we're not tilling it in um and we have tried multiple things we've tried just pulling the whole thing up and it's it's awkward because it's like frozen in the fall by the time hello hello uh by the time we're pulling the nebraska's out it's like the soil is like frozen and it's really challenging so we we switched to just chopping them off at the soil level um and leaving leaving that root system in there to kind of rot and because we're rotating i think uh our roots come next after after our breast and so we're direct seeding so we just take furrows and if it has worked out [Music] [Music] you",
