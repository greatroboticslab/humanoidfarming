guys how we doing welcome to good works

8
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:40,480
tractors today we are at the butterfly

9
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,680
girl

10
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,000
photography place right the farm so we

11
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,920
have a

12
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,840
lot of projects to tackle out here we

13
00:00:45,920 --> 00:00:48,399
have a berm that we have to move all the

14
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:51,520
dirt

15
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:52,879
the sand out yeah okay okay everything

16
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:54,559
away from the house we got to take and

17
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,719
put it out behind the barn

18
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,079
then we got to tackle some bushes good

19
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:59,840
chance to use the stump wrecker

20
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,039
now the biggest challenge might be what

21
00:00:59,840 --> 00:01:02,800
you see right here i'm going to do

22
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:03,920
something i haven't done before i saw it

23
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,880
before on youtube

24
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:09,040
i think it was hometown acres used his

25
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,479
box blade to rip up and cultivate and

26
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,680
prepare for a garden so we're going to

27
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:13,119
give that a shot here

28
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,640
i don't have any tillers to use right

29
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,240
now so we're going to see what happens

30
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:16,720
it's springtime the garden's got to get

31
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:19,040
planted

32
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:21,119
now in some ways i am risking my life

33
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,280
today there are honeybees out here

34
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:25,119
there's a killer rooster there's even

35
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:26,560
coyotes roaming in the woods

36
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,240
but we're gonna get the project done one

37
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,600
way or another this could be a two-part

38
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,119
series so make sure you stick around

39
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,360
guys i'm proud to be sponsored by borah

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,200
wheel spacers today is the first real

41
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:36,960
opportunity in the field to try them out

42
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,079
and see how they help with the stability

43
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:39,360
we're gonna give it a shot if you're

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,640

okay so first thing we're going to do is

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:11,360
tackle these small garden strips here we

64
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,120
have one more over that way as well

65
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,440
i don't have a tiller like i said so i'm

66
00:02:13,120 --> 00:02:17,280
gonna really pitch this box blade

67
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:18,800
tilt it forward by shortening the top

68
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,400
link and i'm gonna lower down those

69
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:21,920
ripper teeth as far as they go

70
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:23,680
i don't want to use the blade on the

71
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
back of the box plate at all i just want

72
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,879
these teeth to dig down

73
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,480
and scrape and cultivate the ground to

74
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,840
prepare for planting i found this on a

75
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:30,800
forum somewhere i know you guys have

76
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:32,640
done it before

77
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,239
my first time adding some weights right

78
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:35,840
to the box blade

79
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:37,680
i have 70 pound weights hanging on the

80
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:38,959
inside four of them so it adds an extra

81
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:40,720
280 pounds

82
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:42,640
these smaller box blades don't weigh all

83
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,080
that much so i wanted to have some

84
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,760
additional weight we have about 70

85
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,879
pounds with the spiko we have the loaded

86
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,120
tires too so

87
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,480
this should be pretty solid then when

88
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,519
i'm using that front end loader but this

89
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:53,040
is going to be a good project for you

90
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,760
guys you're going to see this box blade

91
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,200
in action

92
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,800
we're going to use the heavy hitch tooth

93
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:57,840
bar as well going to use the brush

94
00:02:56,800 --> 00:02:59,920
crusher after we dig

95
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:01,040
out some shrubs up by the landscaping

96
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:01,920
that we're going to be ripping out

97
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:04,210
and of course we're going to use that

98
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:07,279
stump bucket too

113
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:30,880
all right guys i am going into the

114
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:31,440
danger zone you can see that beehive way

115
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,199
back there

116
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,560
i got a till with this thing right

117
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:38,800
around it so

118
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:39,440
fortunately we had a a full body suit

119
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,320
here

120
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:43,199
so there was an actual honeybee inside

121
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:45,280
here when i put

122
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:53,250
put it on though so hopefully that's the

123
00:05:45,280 --> 00:06:04,319
only one but here we go

125
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840

[Music]

135
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:48,240
so we just got done tilling all three

136
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:49,840
areas with the box blade mainly

137
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:51,840
you know with the scarifier teeth the

138
00:07:49,840 --> 00:07:55,120
shanks that we had all the way down

139
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,800
i won't say it was ideal you can't get

140
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:58,960
super deep you know part of the

141
00:07:56,800 --> 00:07:59,599
challenge with a small tractor it's very

142
00:07:58,960 --> 00:08:01,120
light so

143
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:02,560
i have a four foot box plate on here

144
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:03,440
it's a good reason why you would not

145
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,599
want to have

146
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,440
a five foot in my opinion because when

147
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,960
these shanks are all the way down

148
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
you can see that the wheels just sitting

149
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:11,680
there spinning it doesn't have enough

150
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:12,000
weight to get enough traction to be able

151
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,160
to pull

152
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:16,160
anything further so constantly had to

153
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:18,000
raise up and try to feather it and

154
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,599
you're going over an uneven surface and

155
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,680
so the box blade is

156
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,800
reacting to whatever all four tires are

157
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:24,560
doing and so it's kind of bouncing

158
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,759
around so it's definitely not ideal

159
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,360
but if you need to do something in a

160
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,000
pinch i think the results are plenty

161
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:29,520
good

162
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:32,510
to go ahead and plant with what you have

163
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:35,600
out here but overall i still prefer a

168
00:08:52,839 --> 00:08:55,839
so

169
00:08:55,890 --> 00:08:59,159
[Music]

170
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,519
okay so didn't think about bringing a

171
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:05,600
chainsaw or hedge trimmers

172
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:08,480
so we're going to try to tackle this

173
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,160
without first asking our customer

174
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:11,839
to see if we can borrow a chainsaw from

175
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:12,880
them i could always head back home and

176
00:09:11,839 --> 00:09:14,640
grab one but

177
00:09:12,880 --> 00:09:15,600
i figure what the heck we're right here

178
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,120
we're gonna give it a shot we're gonna

179
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:22,590
see if we can knock these out

180
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:25,849
without going that route

190
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,440
so number one it'd be a good idea to cut

191
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,040
these down just to prevent

192
00:10:29,440 --> 00:10:32,800
branches from whacking the house we've

193
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,399
been lucky so far but

194
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,839
that's the first thing i would say about

195
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:37,040
ripping up the shrubs near the house

196
00:10:35,839 --> 00:10:38,800
number two you gotta be able to attack

197
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
it from other angles so i might have to

198
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,760
get this bush out

199
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,480
to get the banks out of this one there's

200
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:46,000
a couple big rooks back here

201
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:47,600
these front couple were easy but this

202
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:48,160
one's kind of buried underneath that

203
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,240
timber

204
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:52,480
and a lot more soil back here without a

205
00:10:50,240 --> 00:11:01,839
good way to get to it

206
00:10:52,480 --> 00:11:01,839
proving a little more difficult

207
00:11:16,410 --> 00:11:29,090

247
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:03,600
for those of you not familiar with the

248
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:05,519
brush crusher grapple this is the only

249
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:07,199
type of grapple you can get that doesn't

250
00:14:05,519 --> 00:14:08,880
require any additional connections

251
00:14:07,199 --> 00:14:10,720
besides just hooking it up to your front

252
00:14:08,880 --> 00:14:13,120
end loader so there's no hydraulics

253
00:14:10,720 --> 00:14:14,480
no electric that's required you just put

254
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:16,000
it on and you get to work

255
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:17,680
so then you may be wondering how does

256
00:14:16,000 --> 00:14:19,040
this system work without any third

257
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,800
function hydraulics

258
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:22,160
i'm going to show you right now so pay

259
00:14:20,800 --> 00:14:23,680
attention to this stop

260
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:25,199
right here that's on the back side or

261
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:27,040
the bottom side of the loader arm i'm

262
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:29,600
going to lift up on this bottom jaw

263
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:30,079
just to illustrate this point so when i

264
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,639
lift up

265
00:14:30,079 --> 00:14:33,839
on it you can see it's not touching

266
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,920
there so that stop

267
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:37,839
is going to prevent any further motion

268
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,079
of the bottom jaw so this is essentially

269
00:14:37,839 --> 00:14:41,360
where that bottom jaw is going to live

270
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:43,360
you'll see there are some different

271
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,279
positions so you can tweak

272
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:47,199
the angle or the you know the the

273
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:49,760
levelness of the bottom jaw

274
00:14:47,199 --> 00:14:50,800
this top jaw is going to be controlled

275
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:52,560
opening and closing

276
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:53,680
by your curl roll function on your front

277
00:14:52,560 --> 00:14:55,600
end loader so if you're going to dump

278
00:14:53,680 --> 00:14:56,639
out a bucket full of dirt or scoop up a

279
00:14:55,600 --> 00:14:57,920
bucket

280
00:14:56,639 --> 00:14:59,440
this is going to be that same function

281
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:01,480
that controls the open and close of the

282
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,839
grapple this is going to be the model

283
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:04,480
bc4215 it's for the john deere quick

284
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:07,199
attach

285
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,320
there's also the model bc 4200 which is

286
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:10,160
not going to have

287
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:13,040
the center teeth there's going to be a

288
00:15:10,160 --> 00:15:14,480
heavier duty bc 4255

289
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:16,079
not gonna have the center teeth but

290
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:17,040
built a little beefier for the larger

291
00:15:16,079 --> 00:15:18,880
compact tractor

292
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,160
those three are all for the john deere

293
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:21,600
quick attach there is going to be

294
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:24,720
another version the bc

295
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:26,079
4300 for anybody that has a skid steer

296
00:15:24,720 --> 00:15:26,800
quick attach it's going to be gray in

297
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:28,560
color

298
00:15:26,800 --> 00:15:30,560
doesn't have the middle teeth again it's

299
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,639
built a little beefier similar to that

300
00:15:30,560 --> 00:15:34,079
bc

301
00:15:31,639 --> 00:15:35,600
4255 it gets confusing i know but all

302
00:15:34,079 --> 00:15:36,560
the information is on my website good

303
00:15:35,600 --> 00:15:38,240
works tractors

304
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:40,000
we can ship these all over the country

305
00:15:38,240 --> 00:15:41,279
we do it all the time but if you have a

306
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
skid steer quick attach

307
00:15:41,279 --> 00:15:45,279
on kubota mahindra coyote ls the list

308
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:47,920
goes on

309
00:15:45,279 --> 00:15:49,440
look for that bc 4300 so you'll see i do

310
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:51,199
have those third function hydraulics

311
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:52,959
right up front i want to

312
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:54,320
give you guys examples of all sorts of

313
00:15:52,959 --> 00:15:56,079
equipment in action so

314
00:15:54,320 --> 00:15:57,759
just pointing this out that i don't have

315
00:15:56,079 --> 00:15:59,440
anything hooked up here that's the

316
00:15:57,759 --> 00:16:01,920
beauty of the brush crusher is

317
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,600
90 or more of folks don't have these

318
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:05,120
additional hydraulics so you get into a

319
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:06,720
grapple functionality without the

320
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,560
additional cost of the hydraulics or

321
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:10,240
electrical connections or anything else

322
00:16:08,560 --> 00:16:11,759
however if you're dead set on getting

323
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,399
some additional functionality on your

324
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:14,000
tractor

325
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:15,759
i'd encourage you to watch our videos on

326
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:17,279
the summit hydraulic solutions both the

327
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:18,880
diverter kit for the front end

328
00:16:17,279 --> 00:16:20,800
the hydraulic multiplier for the back

329
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:22,399
end the best part is you go to summit

330
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,160
hydraulics you order from them

331
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:37,839
you use code gwt and you're gonna save

332
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:37,839
five percent off your order

00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,039
different attachments on the front today

i saw the barn and i saw the property

385
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:38,640
and

386
00:22:36,159 --> 00:22:40,320
no animals had lived in this field for i

387
00:22:38,640 --> 00:22:42,080
don't know how long but it was like lush

388
00:22:40,320 --> 00:22:42,880
and pristine there was no dirt it was

389
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:45,360
all grass

390
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,640
the barn was perfect and i was like this

391
00:22:45,360 --> 00:22:48,159
is for my horse

392
00:22:46,640 --> 00:22:50,159
i wouldn't want to live anywhere else

393
00:22:48,159 --> 00:22:51,760
now like this is the perfect place and

394
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:55,039
then we just kind of

395
00:22:51,760 --> 00:22:56,799
accumulated that alrighty guys we're

396
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:58,320
back out here day two

397
00:22:56,799 --> 00:23:00,240
we were all here a couple days ago skip

398
00:22:58,320 --> 00:23:01,840
today because of the rain back out

399
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:04,000
friday morning now to finish up you can

400
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,120
see we've got one section of the berm

401
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,640
moved already

402
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:09,039
gonna keep working our way around the

403
00:23:06,640 --> 00:23:10,480
house just keep pile by pile taking it

404
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:10,960
back through a couple of fences back

405
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,320
there

406
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:13,760
have to have somebody man in the gate

407
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:14,799
just because all the animals want to get

408
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:16,559
in and out but

409
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:23,840
that's the destination for the dirt

410
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:23,840
we're gonna get to work

411
00:23:34,510 --> 00:23:37,809
[Music]

412
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:31,089
[Applause]

413
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:47,840
so

414
00:24:51,810 --> 00:24:56,809
[Music]

415
00:25:08,800 --> 00:25:11,960
[Music]

416
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:19,920
so

417
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,920
[Music]

418
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:43,840
uh

419
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:53,760
all right you guys well the amount of

420
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,640
time i had available has expired we got

421
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:58,880
a lot of work done between the first day

422
00:25:56,640 --> 00:26:00,159
and today i don't know six seven hours

423
00:25:58,880 --> 00:26:01,200
worth of work and a couple different

424
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:03,679
periods

425
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,960
uh some gardens tilled up and worked up

426
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:06,240
for planting

427
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,760
got all these shrubs there were some

428
00:26:06,240 --> 00:26:09,440
massive old shrubs that were standing

429
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:11,840
here that we got dug out

430
00:26:09,440 --> 00:26:13,760
really quick with the stump bucket

431
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,520
timbers out with the tooth bar

432
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,360
you know these berms i'm not even sure

433
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:18,400
how many yards of dirt we moved but it

434
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:20,080
was a lot

435
00:26:18,400 --> 00:26:21,600
so a lot of you are curious on how much

436
00:26:20,080 --> 00:26:24,400
to charge for different jobs you know an

437
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,600
hourly rate maybe by a project

438
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:27,600
it is helpful if you can come out and

439
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,400
walk a project but for me that's not

440
00:26:27,600 --> 00:26:29,760
really

441
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,679
an option i just don't have the time to

442
00:26:29,760 --> 00:26:33,679
do it and with bids all over the place i

443
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:35,200
know a lot of you guys don't either so

444
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:37,120
you know i would typically charge

445
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,000
somewhere in the 120 to 150

446
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,320
an hour rate for something like this for

447
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,240
all

448
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:44,080
inclusive work so it's going to depend

449
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,520
on your geographic location as well the

450
00:26:44,080 --> 00:26:47,360
amount of competition you have

451
00:26:45,520 --> 00:26:49,039
the type of work you're doing so this

452
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,400
gives you a good idea though of the

453
00:26:49,039 --> 00:26:51,120
different projects you can knock out

454
00:26:50,400 --> 00:26:52,320
within a

455
00:26:51,120 --> 00:26:54,159
short amount of time if you have the

456
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,600
right tools with you i have an important

457
00:26:54,159 --> 00:26:57,039
question though because i told sheila

458
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,320
that i was going to charge her for this

459
00:26:57,039 --> 00:27:00,480
job i was going to give her a discounted

460
00:26:58,320 --> 00:27:02,320
rate because we're shooting video

461
00:27:00,480 --> 00:27:03,840
but i have something that i really want

462
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,480
instead of cash money so

463
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,400
i have not asked for this yet we're

464
00:27:06,480 --> 00:27:10,320

465
00:27:08,400 --> 00:27:12,080
