  "text": "[Music] the cattle industry has a significant economic impact throughout the Northern Territory the industry was one of the first established Industries in the territory and is made up of a mix of long established family stations through to large corporate organizations that operate on several pastoral leas at a time unlike any other industry the cattle industry has a footprint covering around 45% of the territory's total land area it is an industry providing significant employment opportunities for regional and remote areas of the NT nationally agriculture as a broad Industry Group has been identified as a priority industry due to the high numbers and rates of injury and the Hazardous nature of the work NT work safe has commenced a campaign to assist station owners to reduce the frequency of injuries in the industry from the stations visited so far the industry has demonstrated awareness and commitment to work health and safety this snapshot provides an overview of two station managers on the hazards facing the industry in the territory and their interaction with NT work [Music] safe I'm benen kle uh with tiporary station manager at tiary uh been with with AA company and been with them for been here for 6 months and been with AA for 5 years well I started out as a as a as anyone as a station hand on a on a bigger property um I've been through a few different areas of the industry as I said I've been into the part uh tanning hides and that sort of thing in in that sort of area building machinery in that for the agricultural industry um and moving through on onto the head Stockman rooll overseer and the station man manag the opportunity was given to me uh as a as a station manager in central Queensland on a smaller property um to move to a big move to the bigger property and really go forward in my career and and take on a bigger role AA has at least 12 properties in in the Northern Territory um from brunette on the Barkley right up to the DAR region here and obviously the the abire just out of D we are vertically integrated from a cattle sort of supplyer um into the beef industry we obviously have a lot of station managers so we collectively between us there would be hundreds of years of experience between all the station managers the general managers that have been in the business and right up to CEO turn off here so live exporter was was probably the one of the main ones last year um this year we're just turning off wieners to brunette so this year we'll probably turn off about 8 10,000 wieners down to brunette with our background on the Lakes at brette so yeah so it is it is very vital that our staff are trained and and managed them cattle in a safe manner I think going into the company side of things you focus on safety we want to create a safety culture and that's from the ground up so our our staff telling us what they think uh you know what what is their what is the risk what is the hazards and they have a and they have the opportunity to voice that to their manager or their next in line manager and that comes through to the to the station manager and onto the GMS and onto the board um the board obviously takes it very seriously and they are implementing things um for us this station managers and and we communicate down but we also from a site perspective we want the communication to come up from the from the guys on the ground the station hands to tell us well right at the beginning doesn't matter what aak property you're on you do a onboarding program the moment they sign up um so that will start a week before they actually arrive at the station uh we spend three or 4 days with them we'll go right through all the safe working procedures and everything that we have and we'll actually take them to the yards and we'll work a small M of cattle uh we'll spend a day on the horses uh we'll shoe and we'll do the quad bike assessments and the motorbike assessments and we'll have all that ticked off and we'll have them assessed in the first week and then we work through the training and what we need to go forward with we go through that first initial assessment um we will set a review date on that and that's done by myself or the operations manager I made a very apparent point of that we will talk about safety and we'll have toolbox talks weekly so that's the head Stockman to his staff and that's on a issue that I've risen or something that I've seen as as the manager that I want dealt with to something that one of the station staff have actually brought to me and said I need this communicated up toolbox talks go up to a safety meeting that we will generally have once a month and then uh we have a bigger broader you know with 27 staff we have a full safety meeting every 3 months I think outside the box um I'm only young and I and I look look for things uh since since my management here I've identified a few areas that I need to work on um this year I'm offering a safety incentive to the staff um so if they come to me with near misses uh any incidents and anything that they want to bring forward there's a there's an initiative there for them we understand the policies and procedures coming from NT work safe and we we identifying the issues and um seeking you know ways to limit them mainly and this is what we've identified uh with AO is the you know the cattle the horses and the and the motorbikes and the mastering as our main areas but we certainly don't forget about the me mecs The Cook The Gardener they're all involved the maintenance manager they're all involved in what we do here for safety we have the low stress stock handling that all the station staff here been through and that is something that everyone is aware of and does very well when you're talking about the wieners we handle the wieners with low stress and we keep them heers they come back next year as as Joiner heers so they've been handled properly they come back the next year as a wet care theyve been through the yards properly low stress handling uh the staff know how to handle them properly cuz we we put them through the low stress handling School schs but does it actually you know does it actually stop instance of when you're working with a live animal um it'll be very hard to say well you know just that alone and a set of Standards alone would would work in every every case we have a cattle handling procedure um we go through it with them how to shut the gates properly how to yard up properly and all that um that is something we do and we tick off and and all our staff aware of what risks and Hazards are involved around the cattle and around the cattle yards back back back so this is where we you know this is where we can go back to those B we did need to get the training and the horsemanship skills to a to a better level here at tiary we felt we had the expertise to do it instead of getting someone external and paying for that um we felt we had the expertise and we'd share that with our staff so we went from first round to you know young Green rers from that is they been all the staff of going from a from a level to the next level I've initiated this year that we've brought a new Quad baret it's speed limited to 35 km hour they do have rollover protection systems on them uh I've made a conscious decision that myself the operations manager and the head Stockman are the only ones allowed to Master on quad bikes other staff are allowed to fence on them aao policies that all Riders of quad bikes and and two wheelers have to have a helmet on they are commy assessed and they reassessed every 6 months to get their attitude right on a quad bike is what I'm after um but part of it is slowing the bikes down and the training and we haven't had a quad bike incident this year mastering out in a lot of like fixed scrub country and in a remote area um of implemented GPS units that actually they use as two ways in GPS if they get lost uh something happens they fall off a horse they press a button on the GPS and we know their exact location definitely retention is one of our biggest things that we we're identifying and and we're working with at AO you know obviously we keep someone he understands the property and he understands our policies and the motorbikes the horses all that's at a at a level that we want them to be at to keep them here we are looking at offering incentives and and getting that retention rate cuz the cattle industry and in general the egg industry is a industry that can only keep people for one year 2 years we have a budget and I have to I have to report to uh general managers on what my budget is and what I put my money into but looking at the safety side of things there's things that you don't compromise you measure what is it going to save me in Lost Time staff incidents all that sort of stuff but when you look outside this box it a few things well you weigh up your options and most of the time it'll tell you that you're better off doing it no matter what the cost is NT work safe come out a month ago I found it very interactive very positive so it wasn't about uh what we were doing wrong it was about just identifying things uh looking at areas that we can we we can work on the positive for me was it was just an open discussion some of the issues that were raised um just minor ones that we just off off the cuff conversation um I've gone and addressed them and I think you know it's that outside Outsiders perspective the second set of eyes um that just show you look this is something that you could work with the regulations and that do I fully understand all of them we have people that do that for me as a manager for AO I have someone that does that for me but on the ground uh the helping and the communication from NT work safe is is what we need well we may not always be able to get out there uh to assist the guys on the ground and have a look in that at at their at their location we are still contactable by uh phone and obviously we've got email website as well a lot of information on the website that can assist stations and that but by all means they can give any work safer call and be asked to speak to an inspector and we will provide whatever we can to assist business and better understanding um Health work health and safety uh my name's Cameron kroo I am the manager at man BL station um you I've been with CPC for about 13 years uh growing my role through the rank starting as a first year Jack through to head Stockman and becoming an overseer now station manager here at mamboo previously to that 5 years before I ran a stock Camp here as a head Stockman for 2 and 1 half years I come across here when I was 17 running away from home and wanting to get into the industry it's all I know all I want to ever do consolidate pastoral company has 17 places across Australia through um the territory uh the kimbery region in wa and through Central Queensland and the North Queensland it's operations that cattle go to export to Indonesia from Windham and Darwin um and and then yeah domestic markets through Queensland Man bl's part in CPC um historically with CPC it's it's just been a breeding facility but in the last couple of years we're starting to transition um so it's a value adding Place cattle coming here um to grow value add kilograms and then to move them out over the wet season when as a as a shortage of cattle to go go to market on man and blue we have 11 to 13 staffs throughout the year starting with myself as a manager below me we have a head Stockman and a leading hand a couple of second years and and a couple of First Years to keep fresh blood coming through all the time other staff we have is a Borman the cook he provides meals keeps everyone fed get everyone towing a line in the kitchen keep them on side my wife is she's the administration person and as well as she also takes a wider role on and accompany as a training coordinator our um our youngest people our new recruits each year they they seem to be the ones getting hurt the most and I it's wider across the whole industry um I think you know it's a little bit to do with ego going straight out of school getting away from your parents and getting full of confidence you know showing off in front of your mate so you know basically that's why we we got to train our people we got to we got to get them going and get them thinking right get a get a culture developed so they're they're thinking about what they're doing and they not just racing into things and getting themselves hurt at the end of the day that's that's where safety really comes into its own it can be very tough to handle you know I was young like that once myself I know exactly what I was like um but basically just I think you just got to just got to work through it your first couple of weeks are your hardest you just got to work through it and really you know get them thinking um you know all the training we doing constant reminders you know toolbox to each each month um and and having meetings just just just making them aware you know we might we might have been lucky and not got to had any incidents but just making aware the incidents that are happening when we um our employees to first start with a company we run them through an induction process um it it takes place out at the Charles D University cther campus and some of it on man blue itself here um at at um at the rural College they they do their first aid certificate chemical certificates some maintenance training they have qualified mechanics um so you know they're experts in their field so they they provide us with that service then the horsemanship side of it um this year we we had four groups rang from beginners to the more experienced Riders throughout them um and they came out here to mamboo and U we basically um just stepped them through some basic horse riding we asked them to do a self assessment of their Ro riding then we had a couple of horses around that are Fairly reliable horses you know they're quiet and nothing's going to go wrong with them got them catching them and um you riding them and safely handling basically getting getting them them take their hips away so they're not horses not kicking and just working with the animal and then they do about 3 days of that mind you they're not they're not totally right to go for the job but they've got to start and they know how to keep themselves safe uh safe so yeah they can improve from there um and with the low stress stock handling they go right down to basic stuff for opening shutting Gates moving cattle making sure cattle have water and moving cattle around the yard safely so everything you know can be as safe as possible we're trying to um basically develop a culture here of um just having an understanding and an awareness for safety but because we basically live all live here together um you know it's our home as well as our workplace I think we're just trying to develop an awareness and understanding and start to take responsibility of where we are when it when it comes to safety um yeah it's a joint effort for all of us not just just me barking down the shots to to my staff our RS have being cattle horses and motorbikes after the induction training program of horses myself and my head Stockman we assess assess our own stuff here on Manalo again um and just watch them ride and allocate horses to the their level and then just step through the training like that that's ongoing the horsemanship training all year it's it's a constant Improvement like I still got Improvement we all do so with motorbikes um we carry out we do some training with Charles Darwin with their motorbike experts and then then basically they we come out here and I only try to allocate one or two people to ride the motorbike and then we step them through make sure they're all right they got you know they know how to ride safely motorbike is a big risk because you can be out in a padic riding around on a MOBA cattle and there's a log lying in Long Grass and that's all it takes you might only be idling along and you can fall off and and injure injure yourself so just trying to get awareness into them and um you know just understand that um you know there could be an issue and we're trying to trying to avoid it I believe low stress stock handling definitely uh takes away a lot of the risk it'll never totally take it away cuz we we're dealing with animals at the end of the day and they can be unpredictable I think it's a huge advant manage our um our stock only come into the yard some twice a year some only once a year and a small percentage only every couple of years so um using low stress techniques as long as we we stick to it all the time each year the ATT of the cattle just improve they're used to being handled in a good way you know they become easy to put through the yard become a pleasure to put through the yard like I um I remember when I first started um in the Northern Territory chasing cattle in they used to see you be in the stockyard and Gates would fly back open cattle running back over the top of you I've heard of incidents in the last 5 6 years but I haven't actually seen a cow run back and smash a gate in the last 5 years we've been using quad bikes for as long as I can remember there's been quads around um but at current at current stage cuz they're being identified as such a danger I think they will become phased out the sidebyside ATV we got um yeah it'll probably that'll that'll take over and um you know replace a quad by it's being an alternative use and seem to be a bit safer you know seat belt and have a roof on it for Roll by protection that so I think I definitely feel that's a way things will go all our staff have run through chemical training at CDU they do their uh chemer or the other equivalents you know cuz chemicals are are a part of it but yeah we've got a process where everyone goes through that training and when they come onto the station and they have to undertake some Camel handling we've got records there have to keep you know they're recording what they're doing where they're doing it and what what they're doing it for in our our chemical shed we have the MSDS sheets on hand um for all our chemicals that we use um they're provided there for the staff if they an incident happens and know how to treat it um how to use it what PPE they need to use for it uh we also have it on hand in the office so there's a second copy available work safe and um were out earlier this year they basically just did a had a visit and um yeah just ran had to look at things and what what we're doing to try and uh mitigate our risk it was fairly daunting expecting them to come cuz from what you know in the industry have heard of other places and in the past yeah they're coming to kick your bum really um that's what that's what the general feel was of it but when they turned up it was really good we just stepped through the paces of it um doing we first we um just did a bit of a basic induction with them and then talked about our policies and procedures and just worked walked around and they just had a look at things and yeah it was fairly smooth I think it was good mainly peace of mind and knowing maybe they're not so bad you know they're they they're probably just trying to help too and do their job rather than um bullly into into things yeah definitely having work safe um coming on board this year and the role of being you know there as an advisor and it's being there to help us rather than hammer us um it's definitely like we got all the policies and procedures in place and um you know them coming on board and supporting what we're doing you know it it gives you a lot lot of confidence in knowing that uh what you're doing is right and your people you know people are the key at the end of the day we do make money out of cattle but you know you can't do none of that without your people um so at the end of the day if they they're able to come home safe um and our policies and that are helping that happen you know I definitely think it's it's it's better rather than worse you know definitely moving forward I don't believe uh it's it's got to be an expensive task I believe that some of the systems uh that they can be implemented on on site are rather simple and can be maintained with minimum of fuss it's it's um and I think uh by doing so you're going to reduce the number of uh incident rates on your uh on your farm or your station and in industrywide level if that uh if those incident rates uh begin to fall over a period of time that can only be good for the industry both in a productivity sense as well as their bottom line uh I've been involved in uh Insurance in underwriting and broking uh for the last 40 odd years and uh of those spent many years offering services to the uh Cattleman's Association of the Northern Territory when you do o health and safety there's not immediate returns it's a longterm plan program you you need to implement it and then reap the rewards as you go forward it's not instantaneously because whilst you might have had 5 years of bad claims and implement the o health and safety Service uh program you to to get a better work safe situation the problem is that you've still got 5 years of really bad record so you've got to get rid of that so you got to have one year good one year maybe bit better or or not as bad and then the insurance company can and then work with you to see that yes you're on the right track then the benefits of the savings will come if anybody's looking for Quick Fix it's not going to happen that way it's going to be a long-term situation obviously given that the Northern Territory does have a vast uh land mass in that and some of these stations are quite remote uh it's not just restricted to us coming out there and uh visiting them uh while we we intend to try and do that as part of the campaign uh if they uh require any um advice or uh anything in relation to uh work health and safety then obviously we have the ability to through our website and telephone and everything else the uh the hotline to give us a call and say hi and let us know what their um concerns are or whether they require any further information and we can provide them with whatever we can just because they make contact with us doesn't mean that they they've caught our attention or anything like that we encourage uh people if they want to uh find out more about work health and safety then by all means contact us it doesn't mean that you're going to have an inspect on your door the next day or anything like that but uh we we'll do whatever we can to um try and help them with their uh with their concern or provide them with what information they require I think there needs to be more of that I'd welcome them back and and I would walk them through any and say look you know where can you help me here instead of saying what am I doing wrong where can you help me and then you know authorized by the Northern Territory government daan",
