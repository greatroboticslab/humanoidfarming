1
00:00:04,300 --> 00:00:10,630
an overview innovation platforms and I

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,040
recall from this morning's opening

3
00:00:10,630 --> 00:00:14,530
question of who is in the room about

4
00:00:12,040 --> 00:00:17,380
ninety percent of the room has had some

5
00:00:14,530 --> 00:00:19,720
exposure to innovation platforms yeah

6
00:00:17,380 --> 00:00:25,029
some just heard of it and others have a

7
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:26,829
fairly good grasp of it so we had a

8
00:00:25,029 --> 00:00:28,419
definition of innovation in the morning

9
00:00:26,829 --> 00:00:31,840
there's another one on the screen in

10
00:00:28,419 --> 00:00:34,450
front of you as the process of technical

11
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:36,699
social and institutional change that

12
00:00:34,450 --> 00:00:38,829
results from the interaction amongst

13
00:00:36,699 --> 00:00:40,750
multi-layered sources of knowledge and

14
00:00:38,829 --> 00:00:43,690
its transformation into new things

15
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:45,730
projects or practices applied in a

16
00:00:43,690 --> 00:00:50,769
specific institutional and cultural

17
00:00:45,730 --> 00:00:53,219
context very broad definition the

18
00:00:50,769 --> 00:00:58,629
ingredients of innovations if you like

19
00:00:53,219 --> 00:01:01,050
our dialogue ensuring incentive and

20
00:00:58,629 --> 00:01:03,309
resources to develop businesses

21
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:06,610
reflection so that we can have double

22
00:01:03,309 --> 00:01:09,220
loop learning and acting at various

23
00:01:06,610 --> 00:01:12,010
levels it was mentioned in this

24
00:01:09,220 --> 00:01:15,010
morning's presentation by Bernie that

25
00:01:12,010 --> 00:01:17,380
Singapore has you know wonderful science

26
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:20,560
park and innovation networks and so on

27
00:01:17,380 --> 00:01:22,750
but no agriculture yeah this is not a

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,480
phenomenon that's unique to agriculture

29
00:01:22,750 --> 00:01:28,510
and in fact in industry and commerce we

30
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:32,050
find that quite a lot businesses get

31
00:01:28,510 --> 00:01:35,590
together create science parks and

32
00:01:32,050 --> 00:01:37,270
business hubs in order to bring similar

33
00:01:35,590 --> 00:01:42,460
industries together and spur their

34
00:01:37,270 --> 00:01:44,890
innovations so a lot of that revolves

35
00:01:42,460 --> 00:01:47,920
around putting universities are in the

36
00:01:44,890 --> 00:01:51,100
Institute's companies near markets and

37
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,130
letting them develop incubate idea

38
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:56,620
startup startups and also easy access to

39
00:01:54,130 --> 00:02:00,670
enabling environment so access to

40
00:01:56,620 --> 00:02:02,920
capital and good legal protection in

41
00:02:00,670 --> 00:02:04,930
terms of patents and so on and so forth

42
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:08,050
and when you put that together your

43
00:02:04,930 --> 00:02:10,090
start seeing a lot of growth in the

44
00:02:08,050 --> 00:02:13,060
agricultural innovation system a lot is

45
00:02:10,090 --> 00:02:14,440
borrowed from that so organizations and

46
00:02:13,060 --> 00:02:17,170
individuals will come to

47
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,630
to generate the fuse and adopt new

48
00:02:17,170 --> 00:02:22,210
knowledge so basically working together

49
00:02:19,630 --> 00:02:24,820
pulling together delivering together

50
00:02:22,210 --> 00:02:29,260
that's that's one of the mantras off of

51
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:32,490
this approach the innovation platform

52
00:02:29,260 --> 00:02:34,810
can be physical or it can be virtual

53
00:02:32,490 --> 00:02:37,300
it's essentially a form that's

54
00:02:34,810 --> 00:02:39,610
established to facilitate the

55
00:02:37,300 --> 00:02:42,460
interactions and learning amongst the

56
00:02:39,610 --> 00:02:45,460
various stakeholders and it can be from

57
00:02:42,460 --> 00:02:47,800
a commodity chain analysis or it can be

58
00:02:45,460 --> 00:02:49,540
form a natural resource management but

59
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:52,390
there would be a topic that brings

60
00:02:49,540 --> 00:02:54,610
people together people will will not and

61
00:02:52,390 --> 00:02:55,960
frankly should not come together just

62
00:02:54,610 --> 00:02:57,700
for the sake of it unless they have a

63
00:02:55,960 --> 00:03:00,970
purpose that would not be very

64
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:06,400
sustainable yeah we have to work to

65
00:03:00,970 --> 00:03:10,030
maintain interest so since ninety

66
00:03:06,400 --> 00:03:13,240
percent of you have some exposure to the

67
00:03:10,030 --> 00:03:14,860
topic I'd like you in small groups and

68
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:17,470
actually by small groups I mean groups

69
00:03:14,860 --> 00:03:21,010
of two so turn around to your neighbor

70
00:03:17,470 --> 00:03:23,410
and talk for it says five but will make

71
00:03:21,010 --> 00:03:25,900
it to talk for two minutes about who

72
00:03:23,410 --> 00:03:29,350
uses innovation platforms how do they

73
00:03:25,900 --> 00:03:31,330
work and what process you typically find

74
00:03:29,350 --> 00:03:32,770
and what are the main benefits and

75
00:03:31,330 --> 00:03:35,050
constraints you don't have to cover all

76
00:03:32,770 --> 00:03:37,780
four but talk about one of these four or

77
00:03:35,050 --> 00:03:40,090
one or two of these for 42 minutes with

78
00:03:37,780 --> 00:03:44,400
someone next to you group of three it's

79
00:03:40,090 --> 00:03:44,400
okay sorry

80
00:03:52,060 --> 00:03:56,380
so a quick question on who uses

81
00:03:54,550 --> 00:04:05,069
innovation platforms who would like to

82
00:03:56,380 --> 00:04:05,069
come in on that okay microphone please

83
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:13,750
all stakeholders okay which means what

84
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:18,209
the actors depart partners in the whole

85
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:25,229
system okay can you give some examples

86
00:04:18,209 --> 00:04:33,639
researchers farmers policymakers private

87
00:04:25,229 --> 00:04:37,830
sector market-driven thank you what

88
00:04:33,639 --> 00:04:37,830
about what do they do how do they work

89
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:49,090
integrating the knowledge I mean

90
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:52,479
integrating the advances knowledge that

91
00:04:49,090 --> 00:04:54,639
means innovation platforms okay thank

92
00:04:52,479 --> 00:04:57,039
you very much somebody else add to that

93
00:04:54,639 --> 00:05:01,289
in terms of how they work with somebody

94
00:04:57,039 --> 00:05:01,289
else like to offer us more insights

95
00:05:01,740 --> 00:05:09,010
maybe they have to walk between ended

96
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:13,770
after work in convergence partnership

97
00:05:09,010 --> 00:05:17,460
collaboration cooperation and salsa yes

98
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:19,840
can somebody tell me what is the typical

99
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:23,729
constraints what are some of the typical

100
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,729
constraints of innovation platform

101
00:05:27,090 --> 00:05:33,520
probably sometimes it's very difficult

102
00:05:29,260 --> 00:05:37,240
to arrive in a certain conclusion given

103
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:39,130
period of time yes for instance what is

104
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:45,660
another constraint that can be linked to

105
00:05:39,130 --> 00:05:45,660
that please use the microphone

106
00:05:47,780 --> 00:05:52,830
probably conflict of interest yes we can

107
00:05:51,090 --> 00:05:57,210
have conflicts of interest in these

108
00:05:52,830 --> 00:06:02,819
groups can also be very expensive you

109
00:05:57,210 --> 00:06:05,370
know and the group thing okay so you

110
00:06:02,819 --> 00:06:07,879
have a problem whatever that problem

111
00:06:05,370 --> 00:06:10,439
might be you come together so you start

112
00:06:07,879 --> 00:06:13,199
the first thing that you do is you

113
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:15,539
initiate the platform and if you don't

114
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,599
have one then you together with the

115
00:06:15,539 --> 00:06:20,669
platform decide on the focus yeah even

116
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,800
though I already had a problem here

117
00:06:20,669 --> 00:06:26,400
we're still going to discuss it and

118
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:28,560
agree together on on the focus we then

119
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:31,250
are going to identify what the options

120
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,279
that are available to us to tackle that

121
00:06:31,250 --> 00:06:38,639
we're going to then test and refine

122
00:06:34,279 --> 00:06:40,650
solutions once we have our solutions we

123
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:43,409
might need to develop capacities in

124
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:46,580
order to be able to implement those

125
00:06:43,409 --> 00:06:48,930
solutions and take them up to scale as

126
00:06:46,580 --> 00:06:52,349
we're doing that we're going to analyze

127
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:55,440
and learn from our experience then the

128
00:06:52,349 --> 00:06:58,770
cycle will go on yeah so this is a

129
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:04,529
typical model of an innovation platform

130
00:06:58,770 --> 00:07:06,960
cycle you can look at that also in terms

131
00:07:04,529 --> 00:07:10,289
of a breakdown of themes and issues to

132
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:11,719
reflect upon so you have one example

133
00:07:10,289 --> 00:07:14,039
here in terms of composition

134
00:07:11,719 --> 00:07:17,759
coordination power resource and

135
00:07:14,039 --> 00:07:20,219
monitoring and specific sub issues that

136
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,990
you need to consider I'm not going to go

137
00:07:20,219 --> 00:07:24,029
into all of those now but you'll have

138
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:26,310
them in your materials when you are

139
00:07:24,029 --> 00:07:29,099
considering from a policy perspective

140
00:07:26,310 --> 00:07:31,319
from an extension to to have one you can

141
00:07:29,099 --> 00:07:34,379
use that as a checklist to think have we

142
00:07:31,319 --> 00:07:36,990
given these matter of thoughts yeah and

143
00:07:34,379 --> 00:07:40,110
I'm also going to provide you with a

144
00:07:36,990 --> 00:07:42,360
number of alternative authors who have

145
00:07:40,110 --> 00:07:46,289
looked at this and come came up with

146
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:48,240
different phases so some have six some

147
00:07:46,289 --> 00:07:50,729
have seven some high five but they're

148
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,209
all extremely similar in in their

149
00:07:50,729 --> 00:07:57,270
process it does not matter which one you

150
00:07:54,209 --> 00:07:57,940
subscribe to it does matter that you

151
00:07:57,270 --> 00:08:00,190
actually

152
00:07:57,940 --> 00:08:03,640
one that you are following and checking

153
00:08:00,190 --> 00:08:05,290
that you have a good checklist that

154
00:08:03,640 --> 00:08:08,040
you're not forgetting critical steps

155
00:08:05,290 --> 00:08:10,690
along the way especially if this is a

156
00:08:08,040 --> 00:08:13,090
relatively new concept for the

157
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:17,290
organization that is promoting or

158
00:08:13,090 --> 00:08:21,340
facilitating the platform it's a dynamic

159
00:08:17,290 --> 00:08:22,720
process so the focus can change the

160
00:08:21,340 --> 00:08:25,270
membership can change the

161
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:28,480
responsibilities can change just because

162
00:08:25,270 --> 00:08:30,820
you met this morning to discuss what to

163
00:08:28,480 --> 00:08:33,190
do with the forest between addison ababa

164
00:08:30,820 --> 00:08:35,229
does not mean that that same group will

165
00:08:33,190 --> 00:08:38,409
always and only work on that forest

166
00:08:35,229 --> 00:08:40,840
issue yeah so it's important to keep

167
00:08:38,409 --> 00:08:44,380
that in mind in terms of the process

168
00:08:40,840 --> 00:08:46,870
that we follow some of the main benefits

169
00:08:44,380 --> 00:08:49,270
is that it facilitates dialogues and

170
00:08:46,870 --> 00:08:51,640
understanding and upward communication

171
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,400
it can help reach better informed

172
00:08:51,640 --> 00:08:59,530
decisions it can also help make

173
00:08:54,400 --> 00:09:01,600
innovative research possible which one

174
00:08:59,530 --> 00:09:04,360
of these would you consider to be the

175
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:06,550
most enticing benefit so think now

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,810
really for from your own perspective

177
00:09:06,550 --> 00:09:12,940
your organization if you go back and you

178
00:09:09,810 --> 00:09:14,920
pitch your boss I want to us to

179
00:09:12,940 --> 00:09:18,100
experiment with an innovation platform

180
00:09:14,920 --> 00:09:20,170
approach what is the reason that you

181
00:09:18,100 --> 00:09:24,250
find most enticing there's no right or

182
00:09:20,170 --> 00:09:25,720
wrong here okay interesting so the room

183
00:09:24,250 --> 00:09:28,030
is fairly split and all of these are

184
00:09:25,720 --> 00:09:30,760
good reasons but the top reason from

185
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:35,340
this group do we have a tie in first

186
00:09:30,760 --> 00:09:39,700
place between facilitating dialogue and

187
00:09:35,340 --> 00:09:42,430
enabling innovative research yeah is

188
00:09:39,700 --> 00:09:44,050
that because is that because you feel

189
00:09:42,430 --> 00:09:47,200
that in your systems you're not seeing

190
00:09:44,050 --> 00:09:49,690
enough of those this is a question that

191
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,180
I have when I see these results who is

192
00:09:49,690 --> 00:09:56,740
thinking why is it the most important

193
00:09:52,180 --> 00:09:59,140
but we're not here to only look at the

194
00:09:56,740 --> 00:10:01,330
good and the beautiful we also need to

195
00:09:59,140 --> 00:10:03,250
consider the constraints it's always

196
00:10:01,330 --> 00:10:05,530
important because in the real world we

197
00:10:03,250 --> 00:10:08,200
look at the trade-offs so some of the

198
00:10:05,530 --> 00:10:09,550
constraints include that you really need

199
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:11,529
full buying from all

200
00:10:09,550 --> 00:10:16,060
the members and that can be very

201
00:10:11,529 --> 00:10:19,269
difficult and costly to implement and we

202
00:10:16,060 --> 00:10:22,570
need tangible outputs to sustain members

203
00:10:19,269 --> 00:10:26,019
and commitment this is especially true

204
00:10:22,570 --> 00:10:29,200
when you want to involve farmers in the

205
00:10:26,019 --> 00:10:31,480
private sector so I mean a farmer will

206
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:34,269
not continue to come to a meeting to sit

207
00:10:31,480 --> 00:10:38,290
and discuss for the sake of it unless he

208
00:10:34,269 --> 00:10:40,600
or she sees a tangible benefit yeah it's

209
00:10:38,290 --> 00:10:44,260
usually researchers and government

210
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:46,959
officials who are more you know happy to

211
00:10:44,260 --> 00:10:48,820
come and sit and talk but that's usually

212
00:10:46,959 --> 00:10:50,880
because either they're doing research on

213
00:10:48,820 --> 00:10:53,290
that so it's part of their work or

214
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,450
they're representing and that's also

215
00:10:53,290 --> 00:10:56,890
part of the work but for other groups

216
00:10:55,450 --> 00:10:59,589
you really have to make sure that

217
00:10:56,890 --> 00:11:03,779
they're getting value for money this is

218
00:10:59,589 --> 00:11:07,000
important because if you don't get that

219
00:11:03,779 --> 00:11:08,740
people drop out and what that means is

220
00:11:07,000 --> 00:11:10,690
that topics that don't give an immediate

221
00:11:08,740 --> 00:11:13,510
benefit for example natural resource

222
00:11:10,690 --> 00:11:16,029
management issues might have a harder

223
00:11:13,510 --> 00:11:18,550
time sustaining innovation platforms

224
00:11:16,029 --> 00:11:20,680
unless you link it directly to an

225
00:11:18,550 --> 00:11:22,089
economic benefit which means that you

226
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,630
will need to be more aware of how you

227
00:11:22,089 --> 00:11:28,180
address these issues it can also be

228
00:11:25,630 --> 00:11:32,079
difficult to monitor and evaluate in a

229
00:11:28,180 --> 00:11:34,329
systematic way it's about people coming

230
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,310
together sitting together talking right

231
00:11:34,329 --> 00:11:38,529
how do you evaluate where is something

232
00:11:36,310 --> 00:11:40,390
really happened maybe today there was a

233
00:11:38,529 --> 00:11:42,279
breakthrough but it looks like just

234
00:11:40,390 --> 00:11:46,810
every other meeting people SAT around

235
00:11:42,279 --> 00:11:48,670
the table and talked so again my

236
00:11:46,810 --> 00:11:50,200
question to you from the reasons which

237
00:11:48,670 --> 00:11:52,839
are from the constraints which are on

238
00:11:50,200 --> 00:11:55,029
the screen which one do you find the

239
00:11:52,839 --> 00:11:57,959
biggest most crippling effect or

240
00:11:55,029 --> 00:12:02,440
limitation of an innovation platform

241
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:06,060
okay here we have a clear decision which

242
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:06,060
is difficult and costly to implement

243
00:12:08,280 --> 00:12:17,170
learning alliances piloted by the

244
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:20,080
central international who are equal to a

245
00:12:17,170 --> 00:12:23,740
topical or the International Institute

246
00:12:20,080 --> 00:12:29,170
for tropical agriculture based in cali

247
00:12:23,740 --> 00:12:32,170
in Colombia in Latin America designed in

248
00:12:29,170 --> 00:12:34,960
the early 2000s a solution for

249
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:37,060
challenges of out scaling it quickly

250
00:12:34,960 --> 00:12:39,100
evolved into vehicles for strategic

251
00:12:37,060 --> 00:12:41,140
Learning and capacity development and

252
00:12:39,100 --> 00:12:44,170
there an approach for building

253
00:12:41,140 --> 00:12:46,330
multi-stakeholder innovation systems so

254
00:12:44,170 --> 00:12:49,150
essentially something very similar in

255
00:12:46,330 --> 00:12:54,760
its origins and objectives to an

256
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:56,250
innovation platform if you look at the

257
00:12:54,760 --> 00:12:59,140
definition that's on the screen

258
00:12:56,250 --> 00:13:01,810
involving research donors development

259
00:12:59,140 --> 00:13:04,510
policy makers bringing together to share

260
00:13:01,810 --> 00:13:06,730
good practice it sounds very similar to

261
00:13:04,510 --> 00:13:09,190
the definitions of innovation platforms

262
00:13:06,730 --> 00:13:13,060
that we have been discussing so

263
00:13:09,190 --> 00:13:20,590
essentially they are different names for

264
00:13:13,060 --> 00:13:24,640
very very similar processes again at the

265
00:13:20,590 --> 00:13:26,860
IP or learning alliance works at various

266
00:13:24,640 --> 00:13:29,620
levels so you can work on it at the

267
00:13:26,860 --> 00:13:32,520
local level at the methyl regional level

268
00:13:29,620 --> 00:13:32,520
or the macro level

269
00:13:37,459 --> 00:13:43,519
so when we talked about innovation

270
00:13:40,699 --> 00:13:48,519
platforms originating in industry and

271
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:51,410
business but which part of the concept

272
00:13:48,519 --> 00:13:54,050
that we see in business did not

273
00:13:51,410 --> 00:13:58,670
necessarily translate translate well

274
00:13:54,050 --> 00:14:00,589
into agriculture is it that a the aim of

275
00:13:58,670 --> 00:14:03,290
improving the livelihoods of all

276
00:14:00,589 --> 00:14:07,459
stakeholders be the involvement of

277
00:14:03,290 --> 00:14:10,639
diverse sectors see sharing of knowledge

278
00:14:07,459 --> 00:14:12,879
and technology or D the emphasis on

279
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,879
high-tech

280
00:14:22,389 --> 00:14:29,600
yes overwhelmingly correct so an

281
00:14:25,850 --> 00:14:31,310
innovation platform in agriculture does

282
00:14:29,600 --> 00:14:32,839
not have to be about high tech and in

283
00:14:31,310 --> 00:14:37,610
fact most of the time it's not about

284
00:14:32,839 --> 00:14:40,970
Isaac which are the following positive

285
00:14:37,610 --> 00:14:42,649
outcomes would you not anticipate from

286
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,790
an innovation platform or Learning

287
00:14:42,649 --> 00:14:51,070
Alliance a increased number of patents

288
00:14:46,790 --> 00:14:53,000
be greater relevance to farmers need see

289
00:14:51,070 --> 00:14:57,070
mobility of knowledge tools and

290
00:14:53,000 --> 00:14:57,070
approaches or D enhanced learning

291
00:15:08,950 --> 00:15:21,890
only 18 okay yes you would typically not

292
00:15:19,220 --> 00:15:28,520
expect to find patterns emerging out of

293
00:15:21,890 --> 00:15:31,459
an innovation platform evening is there

294
00:15:28,520 --> 00:15:33,529
much difference between so is there is

295
00:15:31,459 --> 00:15:35,120
the statement says there is negligible

296
00:15:33,529 --> 00:15:38,000
difference between an innovation

297
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:41,740
platform and a Learning Alliance would

298
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,740
you find this statement true or false

299
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:54,120
interesting

300
00:15:55,710 --> 00:16:04,290
you want to do it again yes it's a true

301
00:16:01,230 --> 00:16:07,250
statement yeah we just went over there

302
00:16:04,290 --> 00:16:09,870
their main characteristics and we saw a

303
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:11,520
large amount of similarities in the

304
00:16:09,870 --> 00:16:13,500
approach bringing over the multiple

305
00:16:11,520 --> 00:16:17,790
actors working together to find solution

306
00:16:13,500 --> 00:16:23,580
to spur innovation so it's very very

307
00:16:17,790 --> 00:16:26,850
similar systems okay any open-ended

308
00:16:23,580 --> 00:16:30,050
questions about module three the

309
00:16:26,850 --> 00:16:30,050
innovation platforms
