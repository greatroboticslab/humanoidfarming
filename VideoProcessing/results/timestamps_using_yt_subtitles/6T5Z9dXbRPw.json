  "text": "an overview innovation platforms and I recall from this morning's opening question of who is in the room about ninety percent of the room has had some exposure to innovation platforms yeah some just heard of it and others have a fairly good grasp of it so we had a definition of innovation in the morning there's another one on the screen in front of you as the process of technical social and institutional change that results from the interaction amongst multi-layered sources of knowledge and its transformation into new things projects or practices applied in a specific institutional and cultural context very broad definition the ingredients of innovations if you like our dialogue ensuring incentive and resources to develop businesses reflection so that we can have double loop learning and acting at various levels it was mentioned in this morning's presentation by Bernie that Singapore has you know wonderful science park and innovation networks and so on but no agriculture yeah this is not a phenomenon that's unique to agriculture and in fact in industry and commerce we find that quite a lot businesses get together create science parks and business hubs in order to bring similar industries together and spur their innovations so a lot of that revolves around putting universities are in the Institute's companies near markets and letting them develop incubate idea startup startups and also easy access to enabling environment so access to capital and good legal protection in terms of patents and so on and so forth and when you put that together your start seeing a lot of growth in the agricultural innovation system a lot is borrowed from that so organizations and individuals will come to to generate the fuse and adopt new knowledge so basically working together pulling together delivering together that's that's one of the mantras off of this approach the innovation platform can be physical or it can be virtual it's essentially a form that's established to facilitate the interactions and learning amongst the various stakeholders and it can be from a commodity chain analysis or it can be form a natural resource management but there would be a topic that brings people together people will will not and frankly should not come together just for the sake of it unless they have a purpose that would not be very sustainable yeah we have to work to maintain interest so since ninety percent of you have some exposure to the topic I'd like you in small groups and actually by small groups I mean groups of two so turn around to your neighbor and talk for it says five but will make it to talk for two minutes about who uses innovation platforms how do they work and what process you typically find and what are the main benefits and constraints you don't have to cover all four but talk about one of these four or one or two of these for 42 minutes with someone next to you group of three it's okay sorry so a quick question on who uses innovation platforms who would like to come in on that okay microphone please all stakeholders okay which means what the actors depart partners in the whole system okay can you give some examples researchers farmers policymakers private sector market-driven thank you what about what do they do how do they work integrating the knowledge I mean integrating the advances knowledge that means innovation platforms okay thank you very much somebody else add to that in terms of how they work with somebody else like to offer us more insights maybe they have to walk between ended after work in convergence partnership collaboration cooperation and salsa yes can somebody tell me what is the typical constraints what are some of the typical constraints of innovation platform probably sometimes it's very difficult to arrive in a certain conclusion given period of time yes for instance what is another constraint that can be linked to that please use the microphone probably conflict of interest yes we can have conflicts of interest in these groups can also be very expensive you know and the group thing okay so you have a problem whatever that problem might be you come together so you start the first thing that you do is you initiate the platform and if you don't have one then you together with the platform decide on the focus yeah even though I already had a problem here we're still going to discuss it and agree together on on the focus we then are going to identify what the options that are available to us to tackle that we're going to then test and refine solutions once we have our solutions we might need to develop capacities in order to be able to implement those solutions and take them up to scale as we're doing that we're going to analyze and learn from our experience then the cycle will go on yeah so this is a typical model of an innovation platform cycle you can look at that also in terms of a breakdown of themes and issues to reflect upon so you have one example here in terms of composition coordination power resource and monitoring and specific sub issues that you need to consider I'm not going to go into all of those now but you'll have them in your materials when you are considering from a policy perspective from an extension to to have one you can use that as a checklist to think have we given these matter of thoughts yeah and I'm also going to provide you with a number of alternative authors who have looked at this and come came up with different phases so some have six some have seven some high five but they're all extremely similar in in their process it does not matter which one you subscribe to it does matter that you actually one that you are following and checking that you have a good checklist that you're not forgetting critical steps along the way especially if this is a relatively new concept for the organization that is promoting or facilitating the platform it's a dynamic process so the focus can change the membership can change the responsibilities can change just because you met this morning to discuss what to do with the forest between addison ababa does not mean that that same group will always and only work on that forest issue yeah so it's important to keep that in mind in terms of the process that we follow some of the main benefits is that it facilitates dialogues and understanding and upward communication it can help reach better informed decisions it can also help make innovative research possible which one of these would you consider to be the most enticing benefit so think now really for from your own perspective your organization if you go back and you pitch your boss I want to us to experiment with an innovation platform approach what is the reason that you find most enticing there's no right or wrong here okay interesting so the room is fairly split and all of these are good reasons but the top reason from this group do we have a tie in first place between facilitating dialogue and enabling innovative research yeah is that because is that because you feel that in your systems you're not seeing enough of those this is a question that I have when I see these results who is thinking why is it the most important but we're not here to only look at the good and the beautiful we also need to consider the constraints it's always important because in the real world we look at the trade-offs so some of the constraints include that you really need full buying from all the members and that can be very difficult and costly to implement and we need tangible outputs to sustain members and commitment this is especially true when you want to involve farmers in the private sector so I mean a farmer will not continue to come to a meeting to sit and discuss for the sake of it unless he or she sees a tangible benefit yeah it's usually researchers and government officials who are more you know happy to come and sit and talk but that's usually because either they're doing research on that so it's part of their work or they're representing and that's also part of the work but for other groups you really have to make sure that they're getting value for money this is important because if you don't get that people drop out and what that means is that topics that don't give an immediate benefit for example natural resource management issues might have a harder time sustaining innovation platforms unless you link it directly to an economic benefit which means that you will need to be more aware of how you address these issues it can also be difficult to monitor and evaluate in a systematic way it's about people coming together sitting together talking right how do you evaluate where is something really happened maybe today there was a breakthrough but it looks like just every other meeting people SAT around the table and talked so again my question to you from the reasons which are from the constraints which are on the screen which one do you find the biggest most crippling effect or limitation of an innovation platform okay here we have a clear decision which is difficult and costly to implement learning alliances piloted by the central international who are equal to a topical or the International Institute for tropical agriculture based in cali in Colombia in Latin America designed in the early 2000s a solution for challenges of out scaling it quickly evolved into vehicles for strategic Learning and capacity development and there an approach for building multi-stakeholder innovation systems so essentially something very similar in its origins and objectives to an innovation platform if you look at the definition that's on the screen involving research donors development policy makers bringing together to share good practice it sounds very similar to the definitions of innovation platforms that we have been discussing so essentially they are different names for very very similar processes again at the IP or learning alliance works at various levels so you can work on it at the local level at the methyl regional level or the macro level so when we talked about innovation platforms originating in industry and business but which part of the concept that we see in business did not necessarily translate translate well into agriculture is it that a the aim of improving the livelihoods of all stakeholders be the involvement of diverse sectors see sharing of knowledge and technology or D the emphasis on high-tech yes overwhelmingly correct so an innovation platform in agriculture does not have to be about high tech and in fact most of the time it's not about Isaac which are the following positive outcomes would you not anticipate from an innovation platform or Learning Alliance a increased number of patents be greater relevance to farmers need see mobility of knowledge tools and approaches or D enhanced learning only 18 okay yes you would typically not expect to find patterns emerging out of an innovation platform evening is there much difference between so is there is the statement says there is negligible difference between an innovation platform and a Learning Alliance would you find this statement true or false interesting you want to do it again yes it's a true statement yeah we just went over there their main characteristics and we saw a large amount of similarities in the approach bringing over the multiple actors working together to find solution to spur innovation so it's very very similar systems okay any open-ended questions about module three the innovation platforms",
