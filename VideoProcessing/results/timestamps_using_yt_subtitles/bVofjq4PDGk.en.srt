1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:04,240
do you know what an agronomist does

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:04,960
agronomists are plant and soil

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:06,799
scientists

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,960
who conduct experiments to find better

5
00:00:06,799 --> 00:00:11,040
ways to manage our farms

6
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:12,960
most agronomists work outdoors from time

7
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,400
to time and you'd need to be prepared to

8
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:16,400
get your hands dirty

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,320
you'll be working alongside farmers

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:19,680
researching ways to boost crops control

11
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:20,960
pests and weeds and protect the

12
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,480
environment

13
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,400
this means you'll need to collect

14
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:25,840
samples perform experiments advise

15
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:26,480
farmers about the ways they can improve

16
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,920
their work

17
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:29,279
and you'll also be working with others

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:30,320
to increase sustainable farming

19
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,840
practices

20
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,680
agronomists need to be interested in

21
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:34,960
science and farming and you'll also need

22
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:35,360
to be able to communicate well with

23
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,360
others

24
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,879
so you can share your findings as an

25
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:39,760
agronomist you'll need to be able to

26
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:41,040
visit farms

27
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,200
although you may not need to live in a

28
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:45,039
rural location you don't have to go to

29
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:46,879
university to become an agronomist

30
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:48,960
but you will probably need a vocational

31
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,640
or tafe qualification to get started

32
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:52,719
most agronomists work full-time during

33
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,640
normal business hours and around one in

34
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,480
four agronomists are women

35
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,160
it's a small industry but it's growing

36
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,280

agronomists

38
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,320
if you're interested in science and

39
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,479
farming see if you can find work

40
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,240
