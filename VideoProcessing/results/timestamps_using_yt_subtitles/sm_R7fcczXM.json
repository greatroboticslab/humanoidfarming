  "text": "once again thanks for thanks for inviting me it's it's fun to be here I did spend i am at Oregon State University now and but I spent 18 years at Montana State University so I kind of know the the the Northern Plains and had a lot of exposure to some of the animal agriculture out there so my my talk is adopting policies and priorities that might help encourage some of these these activities that we'd like to see and I guess one other observation that I had is you know just walking outside in the in the lobby in the 10 years that I've been or 12 years or more than I've been seriously doing climate change there's been a sea change in terms of what's happening in terms of people not yet not embracing as much as but seeing the economic opportunities associated with some of these changes and that's a really good thing it's going to you know 15 20 years ago I was doing climate change research in Montana and a group of growers gave us a t-shirt and the t-shirt said Montanans for climate change and it showed people shivering and things like that and so it was a it was a very different environment that it will question why we do in climate change and I think that has been a really kind of a theme going on here is that you know there's winners and losers there's some people that will benefit from this and I think what we need to do as a whole is to is to try to design policies that are also climate smart policies and that will speak to the benefits of doing both of those ok so the themes I want to talk about once again I will probably not spend a lot of time on this but just what do we mean by this climate smart agriculture concept some of the policies and goals and how do we get there and once again integrating economics as we've heard in many of the presentations this morning is really critical it's got to be economically viable economically sustainable or you know then it's just an exercise if not and so we really need to pay attention to that background of course science has always led to better policy we'd like to see it lead to better policy faster but I think that's been the history of this integrated research but the details are important as I said we need to know how do we integrate across the sciences and there's been like I said a lot of work in the economics area that I'm involved in on efficiency as well as other values that we that we care about poverty vulnerability natural capital ecosystems and so we can just move a little bit from that okay so climate smart agriculture is kind of a very recent term it's been defined by FAO in 2010 and it's composed of basically three pillars there one is to increase sustainability sustainably increased production productivity and incomes adopt and build resilience and then deal with the greenhouse gas emissions wherever possible and I think this was a form of yours too we're looking for that sweet spot that we can and hopefully it's a little bit bigger than the red one that you showed I'd like to see that being expanded so why is it needed we heard this from the earlier presentations as well is that we're going to have to feed a larger population we've got climate change happening and that can lead to reductions in many cases and lower incomes in very vulnerable areas and so a lot of the CSA climate smart agriculture was very concerned not just with the US but with what's happening in developing countries and people that are pretty much living on the margin and once again in 2005 agriculture did account for about 13 and a half percent of the GHG emissions so the approach then for the climate smart agriculture is basically coordinated efforts toward these resilient pathways but we got to do that in the following way we've got to build this evidence which i think is what Megan it was just great to see your study and see some of the other studies that have been out here in terms of building evidence identifying viable options and tools that will assess these different technologies and then also as we all know you've got to increase the local institutional effectiveness we've got a force to some kind of coherence between climate energy and AG policies and then we've got a link on climate and agricultural financing this is incredibly important at the end it's not a new approach it's been around under different names there's a short history there like I said it really has been in the last five years that it's been kind of recast as this climate smart egg as opposed to just dealing with the changing climate or wood sustainability and resilience it's this is kind of a nice schematic here it shows that it builds on what was first referred to as sustainable development poverty reduction environmental risk and then it's also come under the little more encompassing name of a green economy where we're looking at carbon emission reductions resource use efficiency enhancements and now today's version is more of a climate smart agriculture and I think that's because of two concerns one is not just dealing with the environmental concerns and sustainable development concerns but also this issue with food security and agricultural production improvement so looking at a little bit broader and putting all of all the pieces together here so there's been this kind of a schematic that's not mine I borrowed it from John beddington in the this schematic really talks about these goals of climate smart agriculture in terms of a safe operating space and the safe operating space really is from a very you know high level view is we want to sort of increase that sweet spot or that safe operating space in there such that the bigger it is the more resilient we as a planet we as a society will be in terms of being able to adopt to more changes going on and things like that so if if that sweet space and that safe space is really the space that's sustainable is very small then we're kind of pretty fragile in terms of some of the some of the things we have so those three lines there the orange lines are basically represent some relationship between food production and climate change so the climate change due to the food system means that as we get more climate change happening oh I'm sorry as we get more food production occurring under the existing technologies we're going to see more climate change or more greenhouse gas emissions occurring the the global food needs one is a graph that just represents our food needs in a temporal sense as population increases and then finally the maximum food production is just is trade-off between food production and climate change so we can play around with those graphs and so what we can look at here is that if we want to look at the global food needs under a changing climate what we can oops what's happening here okay right so what we're looking at is policies that might try to shift that curve down such that we are increasing the safe space by looking at new global food needs and what would some of those be kind of eliminating the waste in the food chain being able to make better use of the food that we have okay so for any given climate at any given climate or whether point in time we can actually the food needs from the primary production would be reduced because we're having less waste going on if we're looking at how to improve maximum food production we'd be shifting this other graph that's a little slow on the uptake here and so improving maximum food production would be looking at policies that would be shifting that curve out and those policies would be things drought management adaptive grazing methods perhaps for agriculture livestock and maybe matching livestock intensities to the environment and then finally the third graph is how to mitigate climate change from agriculture and in this case we'd want to increase that safe space by actually trying to think of it as shifting the the climate change due to the food system graph back and that would be things like mitigation policies and stuff increase on-site greenhouse gas decrease the on-site greenhouse gas emissions capture co2 etc so that's kind of how this this graph has been used so what is the u.s. doing to enhance climate smart agriculture well as as be said and we've got these climate hubs there's a lot of activities going on that really are in the that fall under this umbrella of the climate hubs we've got global research alliances feed the future climate clean air and then the u.s. global climate change initiative these are all pieces really important pieces of what's happening in the policy avena to promote a more sustainable climate smart agriculture so this alliance has been the most recent of these lists of global efforts and it's a number of countries at a number of organizations the problem is it doesn't have a lot of teeth to it there's nothing mandatory about this it's all voluntary and I'll talk a little bit about that in a few minutes so the key characteristics once again it's voluntary however it's trying to develop these enabling environments that would encourage the adoption of some of these approaches and it's also engaging with business foundations and civils on society etc so joining to a little more policies in the US so the question that we ask in a lot of the research I do is so what about the farm bill what's happening with the policies that we currently have in the farm bill do they incentivize resilience to climate stresses that are consistent with climate smart agriculture what types of tools policy tools might be available to promote a more climate smart agriculture and most importantly what do we need to know and what do we know and how is that gap being being filled so the farm bill everybody here knows it's basically the primary AG policy tool there's different titles in the farm bill 12 of them the ones I circled are primarily the ones that work to deal with some of the climate smart agriculture the three orange ones deal with commodity programs conservation and crop insurance and then we have a research title in the farm bill which indirectly is probably the strongest piece of legislation that we have to continue to fund some of the research that's needed meg and I think you know yours are the great example of this type of policy and then the distributions so I looked a little bit at some of these different titles and in the farm bill and the + next to it means that i think it is moving us in the direction of climate smart agriculture so conservation compliance basically limits conservation requirements to crop insurance premiums etc the farms that have highly available lands or wetlands have to follow this conservation program to receive the government payments and so the question is what happens with the conservation compliance it's a shift toward working lands there's an equip program and so in terms of my safe space diagram i think that the conservation can result in an outward shift of the food system curve which is going to increase that safes that um that safe space and helps to stabilize food production so manure management to curb greenhouse gas emissions I'm trying to do a little bit with respect to the the animal agriculture costly but but effective for greenhouse gas emissions is these innovators there's a Douglas great study at WSU that was done around 2010 currently the economic viability hinges on how to finance and the potential revenue so the operating costs versus the capital costs the revenues from somebody operating a digester come from electricity and renewable fuel the fiber products in the nutrients that are by-products carbon credits if they were to exist and then payments for ecosystem enhancements and once again another case of shifting and making that safe space bigger commodity programs I'm just not going to spend a lot of time on these because I think most people are familiar with them but the commodity programs covered commodities include wheat oats barley etc they can cause this safe space to increase perhaps by improving the maximum food production but as we all know there is some downsides with some of the commodity programs and so they s why I have a plus and a minus up there they may increase their income make them more resilient but it doesn't necessarily encourage adaptation to other programs that we may want in to deal with climate change drought management basically the drought management policies could encourage flexibility and increase resilience the earlier paper that Justin did is a great example of what can happen if we were to get proper drought management policies in place or better drought management policies in place and so once again here I think I've got the drought management could also basically increase the safe space by sort of shifting the the maximum food production curve out adaptive management a.m.p grazing management this is another policy short intensive braising followed by long recovery so once again looking at how do we grade so vain how do we graze those lands the claim in some of the studies is that cattle grazing using this amt may increase productivity and store more co2 so that's one of the claims the adaptive it's adaptive touch it is an adaptive type of carbon capture and storage the question is it really hasn't been quantified and in order to quantify those claims we would have to be we would have to be able to go out there and measure the increase or the decrease of the change in soil carbon as a result of this a.m p versus the current system that might be in place and then we need to know the economic dimensions what's happening to the weight of those animals what's happening to some of the products going on and once again this would be a case of increasing that safe space for climate smart agriculture so designing policies just a few more minutes and then take some questions designing policies fundamentals is that incentives matter economists are always coming back to this we need to understand those trade-offs and the opportunity costs I can skip over this okay so some of the tools that we have that we're developing for better informing our policies are both at the landscape level as well as at the farm level so once again ah premise is that farmers and ranchers are the ones that are making the on-the-ground decisions and so I think it's really important that we develop tools for them to use and so that the landscape level these are the ones these big models the swap model the epic model and then we have one at Montana State I mean at Oregon State called the trade-off analysis model it started at Montana State at the farm level these are the ones that we were that have been we've been looking at AG tools or AG biz logic which is the one that be talked about is comes under these farm level decision tools and basically they're designed to help Boaz or van choose make operational choices the AG the AG tools on the on the right-hand side there is basically our software which can which is being developed now web-based and it has a number of sub programs in there AG profit a Gleason AG finance and then AG environment this is once again the same the same flavor and theme that Justin was talking about in terms of what he was looking at so the farm level decision tool this AKA we nicknamed TurboTax platform for two reasons one is that it's going to take information from the growers tax returns and populate it into this program but it's also one that allows the growers to be able to fine tune it for their situation so what has been what are their list of imports what has been their their experience in terms of yields or outputs and so the decision tool has these kind of components to it the first is we want to use this platform to ask questions for the grower to ask questions you know should I change my crop rotation or my raising rates and invest in new equipment or invest in other kinds of inputs based on expected changes in climate and crop yields that may come along with some of the climate changes that was seeing the other thing is it has to it's going to gather this data on their inputs and other spatially relevant data on their yields it's going to take all of that information and run it through the scenario the scenario that we have these sub sub routines that we have using different scenarios to look at basic outcomes and how the economic and environmental outcomes will change as the scenarios change so we've done this with the wheat and this is what he was referring to we ran through this egg tools with them without climate change and we show that yes in order to deal with and adjust to climate change this farmer this farmer would be better off switching his annual propping rotation to something that includes seed oil and canola so once again just comparing those those two bottom circles there so the application so I was thinking a little bit about the application of AG tools to livestock and clocks eved is doing this and I think one of the big pluses of a tool like this is it's going to allow the growers to make sense of all of the data that they have that there and make sense of it on something that means something to their operation and not just here is a typical ranch and so I think trying to drill down and get it to be as relevant as possible so what what we're doing in clocks eva is actually doing this in oregon for some of the livestock operations is setting up these baseline budgets and information making them site-specific talking with growers and with ranchers to decide what are the scenarios that we need to be addressing and then to explore what those under those scenarios are their current operations economically viable incorporate precip forecasts download downscaled climate data and information and then i think step four is really important when I use TurboTax I tend to do a lot of different scenarios on how should I what should I be doing with my income should I be investing it here and here and being able to compare those well AG tools is going to allow a venture or a grower to do the same kind of thing is to be able to say how much better or for worse off would I be if I were to switch how I manage my operation when we see changes in climate coming or changes in play is or changes in technology so it's going to be used in a relative sense as opposed to an absolute sense and being able to allow the grower or the venture to be able to explore those and understand those trade-offs and you know what I can stop here because this is this is kind of repetitive of what other people have I think come up with what is quite far as presented what does climate change mean for agriculture some of the direct and the indirect impacts and so this gives me a flavor of what are the kind of things we need to be modeling and capturing in a tool like AG tools yeah I can just stop there great thanks and I know we have the governor coming on in about five minutes so late okay great one question for me in Western Hemisphere we don't have that much problem with production of agricultural I think the problem is mainly the distribution of it version of the distribution lies in comparison with safe space yeah I don't think it is actually captured that well because that's a much high level issue you know I think you're exactly right you know we talk about food security we probably have plenty of food on aggregate it's just not in the right places at the right time and so I think that that is an area that hasn't been captured at least in that diagram it has been people are paying a lot of attention to it you know or again we're pretty wealthy in terms of you know the outside world looking in but we've got a lot of hunger and a lot of issues and it's you know so it's not just the aggregate that's important it's the distribution and it's looking at the winners and the losers and usually the losers are oftentimes low-income and so paying attention to some of those those concerns as well and not just always feeding more I think the other thing on a little bit on that food demand is you know that there's a lot of effort going on on trying to minimize the waste if you look at some of the statistics on how much food is wasted and thrown away and not consumed or used you know if we can minimize that then the amount of land we need to bring into production or the types of may be much less than we think if we can get some of those numbers down so yeah sure the one I didn't talk about the Toa the landscape level tool will do some of that at a bigger higher landscape and in that one what we actually have is trade-offs between some of the environmental outcomes and then we've modeled the agricultural outcomes as they grow up may produce a commodity as well as produce ecosystem services for example a carbon offsets or that commodity he could make choices or she could make choices between producing some of the grain crops for actual grains versus energy and so there could be those those kinds of things but in but at the landscape level one at the farm level one now but that's a that's a great example one of USDA's new calls for purple not USDA I guess it's USDA is it that the one that has the food food systems energy and water Nexus yeah that one is I think really really important it's hard to yeah we need to capture those complexities on you know what gives there sure Zoomers by encouraging climates labeling and yeah I don't know for sure it's not my area there probably is I guess it's probably something where people are looking at the consumer demand how much more people willing to pay could this be the more interesting part of what you have is you know can this be somehow marketed that this was I guess it gets into the area of sustainable or you know not organic but produced sustainably so I think the climate smart agriculture like I said that whole movement grew out of fao in a lot of concern with developing countries and looking at you know what are the what are the options and what are some of the ways that we can keep that safe space from shrinking down more and more because if we just do business as usual the projections are those those you know curves are going to start condensing in and then that safe space for producing food and sustaining our climate will be shrinking and so the idea is how do we keep it from shrinking down or it's all get to expand yeah all right thanks",
