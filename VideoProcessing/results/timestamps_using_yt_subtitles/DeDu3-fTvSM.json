  "text": "Hey, hey. I'm Sheay Wner and you are listening to the Casual Cattle Conversations Podcast. Whether you are a seasoned rancher or just curious about the cattle world, this podcast dives into the stories, science, and strategies shaping the future of ranching. Let's get started and keep your herd ahead of the herd. Folks, today we are visiting with Devlon Ford from the Noble Research Institute and we are going to be talking about grazing, but more specifically we are going to be talking about some mistakes that producers make that are really impacting their profitability. So, Devlon is very experienced in helping producers create grazing plans that work for their unique operations and improve their bottom line. So he has a lot of expertise and knowledge to share. He's very practical. I learned a lot in this conversation. So I hope you learned a lot too. Now with that I do want to remind you that if you are looking for a speaker for your next event, whether that is a workshop, a keynote, panelist, in person or virtual, I am still taking on slots for 2025. So, you can message me or contact me via my website and just use the contact me form and that goes straight to my email. But with that, let's talk about grazing. Does tax season make you want to bang your head against the wall? Is billing a bad word in your household? Does meeting with your egg lender make your blood pressure rise? Stress a little less with cattle management software, Performance Beef. It tracks important feed, financial, and health data all in one system. The results? You can pull inventories, detailed financials, and invoices in minutes. Get ahead for next year's tax season. Visit performanceelivestockanalytics.com to learn more. All righty. Well, Devon, I am excited to have you on the show today and to talk about grazing because grazing is a topic that I sense that you are passionate about and I know your co-workers are very passionate about as well, but it's just something that always goes over well on the show and is important for ranchers to always be continuing their education on and maybe brushing up on a few things. So, the first thing I always ask guests, and it's maybe not an easy question, but it's sure a fun one to hear responses, is why do you believe in the beef industry? I enjoy working with livestock, cattle, particularly uh got to work cattle with my son and some friends this last weekend for the first time in a long time. And while it was a good day, I mean, it was we was working cattle, but it was a good day. Enjoyable. I just like being around like-minded people like me that want to take care of their livestock and their land. Absolutely. And tell us a little bit more about what you're doing today because you're with the Noble Research Institute, but elaborate a little bit more on your role. My role is I'm one of facilitators. I get to travel around a lot of the US teaching courses primarily our noble grazing essentials course and our business of grazing course get to visit with a lot of producers you know hopefully when they leave our courses they've taken something home that you know from my past experiences and typically every time I leave of course I've taken home something from them so I always tell everybody I'm a lifelong learner I was about 50 when I finally went back and got my master's degree so as we go to these courses and facilitate these programs. We get the opportunity from learn to learn from those producers as well. Well, I always like to visit with lifelong learners. That's part of the reason I started the podcast so that I can continue to be one of those and for all the other lifelong learners who are constantly wanting to learn something new, hear different perspectives. So, when we visited on the phone and we're talking about, you know, what are we going to talk about on this podcast interview, you mentioned that one thing that you either hear producers getting mixed up or that you really focus on in your courses is that difference between carrying capacity and stocking rate. Correct. Correct. I've been several places and quite often people use those two terms interchangeably. They use them for the same thing and they're two very distinct terms, definitions and outcomes on your ranch when used properly. Do you want to take some time to elaborate on the two terms individually? So carrying capacity is based off a mathematical formula. It takes into account grazable acres. It takes into account forge production on those acres and it also takes into account what utilization, how much you want consumed of that forge that's out there. Typically, that's expressed as a percentage. And then on the denominator side, you know, we'll take your livestock weight and multiply it by some intake value. Typically in our classes, just as averages, we'll use like a 2.6% intake per day for that animal. And then you know how many ever days we're planning on grazing. We'll multiply it by that and then divide the numerator by the bottom or the denominator. And that will give us the carrying capacity for our ranch. How many head our ranch will support underneath the terms we put in there. Grazable acres. You know, I hear a lot of people say, \"Oh, granddaddy did it this way and he ran 100 cows and I got the same amount of land.\" Well, you might have the same amount of land and you may not. In one of our classes at the grazing essentials course, we talk about this. We pull up a map that's about 85 acres and 19 years later it's 75 acres just because the oil pad came in, the highway moved south, different things happen. So, and the other thing about is if you're doing the things your granddaddy did, you're probably running bigger cows than your granddaddy did cuz not many people's got a lot of thousand pound cows anymore like my grandfather did. So the forge availability, you know, that's kind of based on your climate, where you're at. If you're more aid, you're probably going to run less forge than say we are here in South Central Oklahoma with 38 average inches of rainfall. So, you know, you're only going to be able to grow so much grass, so much forge for those animals. Utilization, how much we take is one decision as a manager or as an owner that you make in that calculation. you decide what it is that we typically will try to push people to take less than they want to because I've heard the term that's wasting grass if I don't eat it. No grass is ever wasted. It's always useful for something somewhere. Even if it's not ran through a cow, it's going to it'll improve the soil health in future once it lays on the ground and decays. Those nutrients can go back in the soil. On the bottom side of that equation, we talked about cow weight. And we just tell people take the average weight of your cow herd. And typically most people's going to use 1,200 lb cows and then multiply that by the 2.6% intake. I know back in the 80s when I was still in school, undergrad, we talked 3% back there. Kind of the range is 1.9 to 3.5 for cattle. So somewhere in there, you know, depending upon their stage of life cycle they're in, whether they're cving or trying to breed back up, that type of thing, they're going their nutrient requirements is going to be a little bit different on a daily basis. So we just use 2.6 as average. And then you take that number and multiply by the days you plan on grazing. If you plan on grazing forages 365 days a year, that's the number you use, 365. If you've got a stalker operation and you're going to be running 120 days, that's the number you use. Once you do all the math, it'll give you a number and that's the maximum amount of cows that that place will carry underneath those conditions. Stocking rate, on the other hand, is solely a management decision. That is the number of animals that we as managers and owners choose to put on our landscapes. That's how many animals we buy or put on that ranch. So, it's straight up management decision. So, what are the major implications and problems you see when producers are using those two terms interchangeably instead of understanding them for their two separate for being two separate things? Typically what I see happening is when they when they use them interchangeably, they're not really thinking or paying attention to their ranch. Our ranches will teach us a lot of stuff if we just look at it and monitor it and see what happens over time. But if they're using them interchangeably, typically they have not done the calculation to see if their carrying capacity is where it needs to be. You know, they may be low or they may be high on their stocking rate because they haven't calculated their carrying capacity. Support your cattle's health and productivity with Vigertone Minerals.

So when producers are looking to calculate that carrying capacity, I know you just went through what goes into that calculation. Are there other resources in their area that they should turn to to kind of get started on that or is it pretty much a straightforward calculation across the board no matter where they're at? Well, the calculation is the same, but the numbers are going to be different depending upon where you're at, your situation, and your numbers will be different than your ranches, your neighbor ranch's numbers. The grazable acres, you know, people say, \"Well, I own 1,000 acres.\" It's a good deal. I'm glad you do. How much of that is grazable? Well, 1,000 acres is there's no roads on it. There's no barns on it, no lots on it, no houses, very little brush or woods. So that's where people get can get confused there. They figured on how many acres they own, not how many acres an animal can graze on it. Quite often, you know, oil field pads, we have some of those here in South Central or South Central Oklahoma. They don't think about those. They don't think about their lots. You know, if you do have brush, which we do have a lot here in the Cross Timbers region, we do have some control over the brush. we can go in and either strategically clear it with dozer or something like that or you know if we're very progressive and have very a whole lot of patience we could bring in some goats or something else that might eat some of that brush. So that's you know the grazable acres that's where those kind of numbers could come from. Your forge production is one of the hardest numbers for people to come up with. And the way we teach it in class is, you know, if you got history of the ranch, you probably know, you know, I tell everybody when I was on the ranches every day, I might not tell you how many pounds of forge was out there, but I could tell you how long those set of cavs could be in that pasture. So, I was still equating it. I just wasn't thinking about it that way. So, you know, you can visually appraise it and say, \"I've got 4,000 lbs of dry matter here.\" You can take a ruler out there and do some measurements and we've got some methods here at Noble. Uh we've worked with Jim Garish on some our classes and he's helped us out a bunch and you know, we've used a lot of his spreadsheets and tricks and things like that or you know, methods and we can take that measure and do some measuring out in the pastures and we come up with that number. Another good way that I tell a lot of people to do it is they can get on the NRCS web soil survey. It's a free website. Very good to use for some instances and it's it's a good starting place for a lot of things. They can get in there and outline their ranch on that map and it'll give them an average. You know, you can look at a good year or a bad year or an average year. And I suggest either going at the high end of average year and at the low end of bad or the best end of bad year because if you use a good year every year your carrying capacity is going to be too high because we have 38 in average rainfall here in Oklahoma and we might hit that three out of 10. So but that's a good place to get that forge production number just as a base to get started. And then after you've gotten started, you're monitoring your animals, you're monitoring your pastures, you're taking notes, recording down all this information, and that will help you become better the next time you do these calculations. Again, the utilization right rate, a lot of people think they need to take 80 to 100% of their forage, and I would disagree with that. We typically talk around depending upon the type of forge we're talking about 30% on you know some native ranges here in Oklahoma. If we're talking the Bermuda grass we'll be talking a little bit higher than that. If we're talking winter wheat which we have a lot of you know we're talking 60% or so. A lot of those you know those annual type grasses you can sometimes take a little bit more than you can your perennials. But your native perennials they are made to take a little bit and move on down the road and let that plant grow and recover. the livestock number. I I ask a lot of people what their cows weigh and I get a lot of numbers and then I ask how many people's got scales and not a lot of people have scales. So unless you're you make a living buying cattle and know what a cattle weighs, you might miss your cattle weight a little bit. And then daily intake there's you can set it at 2.6 3% either one of those would be fine if you want to be a little bit safer. 3% would be good average number to use. And then the number of days is, you know, that's dependent upon how long you want to graze. If you plan on feeding hay and, you know, energy or protein supplement 60 days, then that number is 305 days. If you've got a lease that runs out in 9 months, you're looking at a 9 month or 270 days. You know, whatever how many ever days you're planning on grazing that landscape where you put that number there. So, like I said, the carrying capacity calculations is some of the hardest math we teach. Okay. So, I really appreciate you walking me through that and the listeners through that and going into more detail there. So, we've talked carrying capacity, stocking rate, and before we started this, you also talked about stocking density. So, do you want to throw that in there, too, and share how that's different than the other two terms we just talked about? Stock density is it's basically the amount of pounds or the pounds of animals that you put on a specific spot. Typically, you know, most people are going to be talking 20,000 lbs of stock density. So, that'd be 21,000 lb cows on an acre. That's 20,000 pounds of stock density per acre. In our classes, typically the last day on our grazing essentials course, we will show our producers what a million pounds of stock density look like. So imagine if you would about 30 cows in a 50 by 50 fence. 50 foot by 50 foot. 30 cows. We leave them there for 1 hour is all we do. And then we'll open the gate and move them. Again, stock density allows us to do a lot of different things. And I'm not telling anybody to go out and do a million pounds of stock density. Anywhere north of 60,000 to 100,000 is pretty good. The higher you get, the more intensively man you have to manage it. So, but stock density is one of the best tools in a grazer's toolbox. One of the things that as animals graze around, you know, they're going after what we call the ice cream plants. They're going after what they really want. And if we give them enough time and enough room, that's what they're going to do. But if we put them down into a smaller area, we're going to convince them that they need to eat something. So they probably need to eat whatever they can get a hold of real quick. So you'll get a little you get a lot more uniform grazing distribution that way. You know, you're using more of your forages that they may normally pass over until the second or third time back through there. Is there an impact on animal performance when we're when you're seeing higher stocking densities in those more intensive systems? One thing we need to remember when we're talking stock density, you know, we're talking pounds of animals and time. And time is a very critical piece of that. With the high higher stock densities, we're putting more nutrient back into the soil, more manure, more urine back into the soil in a smaller area. In other words, they're not able to go a half a mile and loaf at the water and, you know, and spread their manure and urine there around the water or underneath the shade trees. You know, they're putting it on the pasture where it's going to give us the biggest benefit for our operation. The other thing about stock density is it's a tool. You know, we can make those animals eat things that they may not necessarily want to eat. It's not going to hurt them, but they will eat that. I mean, they'll still gain weight on those forges. The other thing it'll do is if we have a lot of dry standing forge that for whatever reason we didn't graze get grazed off or maybe it's a, you know, winter pasture that's, you know, already terminated and went to seed. And we can use stock density to lay that forge that's 2 or 3 foot tall that the cattle are, you know, the stems all dignified. The cattle are not going to eat it. They're going to graze around it. We can use that stock density to then put that taller forge on the ground and get it in closer contact with the soil. So now we're back to feeding the soil and the soil feeds the grass and the grass feeds your cows. So for years when I was managing cattle for Noble on different ranches, I always thought I was a cattle manager or cowboy, whatever you want to call me. Come to find out, what I've since then learned is I'm more of a grass manager and a soil manager than I am the cattle manager. I'm hearing more and more people share that perspective or change in thought, if you will, however you want to describe that. So with all of that, when we're thinking about the profitability of ranches and how grazing systems fit into that, what is that profitability impact if producers are putting too many or too few cattle in their pastures and not, you know, understanding those terms correctly and having that plan, the problem with running more animals are setting our stocking rate above our carrying capacity is we are more than likely going to increase our direct cost to those animals because we're more than likely going to have to feed more substitutional feeding feed hay more protein or more energy. Not to mention what we could potentially do or what we will be doing once we start overg grazing our ranches. You know what when we overg graze our ranches we're you know we're declining the roots in the soil. We're declining the quality of the soil on our ranches because there's no forge there to grow. One of the six soil health principles is always keep living roots. Well, anytime we take a plant and bite it to the point where we remove too many of the leaves off of it, think of those leaves as a solar panel on your charger, fence charger. And what would happen if you covered up half of those solar cells with tape? It wouldn't the charger wouldn't function like it should. Same way with plants. If we remove too many leaves, that plant cannot perform because it doesn't have any solar. So then it starts pulling carbohydrates up out of the roots out of the soil up to the plant for growth. So that's one of the dangers of stocking your ranch above carrying capacity. On the other hand of that for profitability when we start you know stocking rate is the primary determinant of pro profitability. Stocking rate is the primary determinant of profitability. If we stock few too few of animals on that ranch, then we're probably not going to have enough revenue coming in that we can cover our overhead cost as well. So, you know, we have to think about that, too. There's a pretty good curve. You know, the higher the stocking rate, the less production you get with an animal. But there's also, you know, if I'm in a stalker operation, I may choose to, you know, only gain two pounds a day and run more animals than I run fewer animals and gain two and a half. So, you know, stocking rates, that's pretty fine line. And we, you know, I I typically would recommend people to depend upon their forages, the climate they're in, how aid it is, how wet it is, you know, typically set that stocking rate somewhere between 70 maybe 85%. If certain times, you know, if you're doing some winter pasture graze out with some yards, then, you know, you can run that a little bit higher, but just need to be aware that you may need to be selling those animals a little bit quicker than you thought you would. So, you know, a lot of this just kind of goes back to a context of that producer and their goals for their ranch. Do you have big ambitions for your operation, but feel like you get so caught up in the day-to-day fires that you are just spinning in circles? You aren't alone. I've been in your shoes and know just how frustrating it can be. That's why I created Move the Ranch Forward. It's a guide for ranchers. This guide is a PDF that contains the exact process my husband and I use to stay focused on our goals throughout the year, even when life throws us curveballs. You can access move the ranch forward today at casual cattle conversations.com. So, you've touched a little bit on, you know, when you're talking about stocking density and talked about, you know, some of the cool things you can do with that and there's a lot of buzz around some of those more intensive grazing strategies, but there are still a lot of producers who moving cattle every day isn't necessarily feasible or doesn't feel feasible depending on their business plan. So, what tips do you have for producers like that who want to make sure they're still being good stewards of the land and improving those pastures that they're grazing? I totally understand that cuz a couple years ago, me and my wife lived about 45 minutes from where our cattle were. So, basically, I'd checked them about every 3 days. So I would come up and I would move my cattle about every three days. What we typically tell people in wetter climates like we have here in Oklahoma, you know, once you go in there and start grazing an area, within about 3 to 5 days after you first move in there, there'll be new leaves coming up on that plant. And as those new leaves come up, those are the plants and those are the leaves those animals are going to target because it's fresh growth. We all know that fresh young growth is very palatable, very nutritious, and that's what those animals want. So, if we can move them every 3 to 5 days in, you know, a wetter climate, 5 to seven in more aid climate where the grass grows a little bit slower, we're okay. you know, later in the year when, you know, we start moving in towards fall, you know, we might be able to extend that a little bit of time in there just because, you know, the plants aren't growing as fast as they are in the, you know, late spring, early summer. So, you know, we have to make this fit our ranch, fit our lifestyle, and just understand our what our goals are for our ranch. And if our goals are to improve soil health and we have the ability to move every day, great, get after it. If you only have the ability to move once or twice a week, do the best you can, but always remember there are pros and cons to everything we do. So, you know, someone who moves every day, they may improve their ranch faster, but they've got a lot more time invested in it, too. Someone who moves three or five once or twice a week, they'll achieve the same results. It may just take them a little bit longer, but still yet there's quality of life that's involved in all this as well. Well, and I think about myself personally, we have a very we have a diversified operation. So there with the farming and other businesses too. That's something else that we always take into consideration when we think through our grazing plan and breeding groups each summer. Yeah. on our uh business of grazing course we work a lot on a grazing plan and that's one of the things we put in there you know we draw a line on the grazing plan and said you know this we're going to start cving here and you know we're going to start stop cving here and you know I want to go on vacation with my family and we put that in there and we do all this just as you said that way that helps us plan those rotations and our grazing movements and unfortunately uh you know ranching is a great life but It's doesn't always go the way we planned out on paper. So, but by having that grazing plan that allows us to be more adaptive in our management and we can make movements earlier. We talk planning a lot and being very adaptive because it's regenerative ranching and grazing is adaptive grazing. It's not a set in stone dynamic plan. So when you are teaching those courses and helping ranchers create those grazing plans or modify existing ones, what are some other common mistakes that you help people work through or see or maybe it's not a mistake so much as a missed opportunity? You that varies from course to course and participants and that's one of the reasons I love doing what we do is because I get an opportunity to talk to these people, understand their particular situations a little bit better. I was talking to one gentleman and he realized that he was probably overstocked. He was a purebred breeder and he thought, \"Well, I'll plant this crop then I can graze it.\" And I told him, I said, \"Well, that's good. At least you're doing something for the soil that way, but all you're really doing is replacing one feeding for a different type of feeding that you're spending money on. Don't get me wrong, I mean, bell grazing, you know, feeding, there's nothing wrong with feeding hay. I've got plans to do it on our place this year. I've got some areas where the soil is not where I'd like to be and I'd like to put a little cover on it. So, I'm going to do what we call bail gra there and roll some hay out and allow my animals to get there, get around it and eat. I do not plan on taking letting them eat that hay to the ground. I'm going to leave a lot of it behind just kind of put some cover on that soil. So, those are just different types of opportunities we get. And I talked to one lady had a very sizable ranch and she was want to know how to put infrastructure in that on that this one pasture and it was rather large. And I said same way I do it on my 140 acres. I develop a plan and I implement that plan when and as I can. Slow and easy. Anytime we start making ranching too hard, it becomes unfund quickly. Slow and easy. So you recommend producers kind of ease into it a lot of times as they make those changes or I mean that can be case by case too I know but case by case is but typically when we're talking to producers that are ranching and farming a little bit more conventionally we ask them to just get a set of land whether it's you know 10 or 50 or 100 acres whatever and start there on that concentrate on improving that one we typically going to ask them to start with their better plant to do that with. And if there's things they want to try on some other spots, that's fine. But put their concentration and their focus on this one little spot. And then as they get more adaptive and more adjusted to looking at seeing what they're seeing and understanding what they're seeing, they start seeing these improvements. Then that gives them the energy to go to, you know, to expand on out to the rest of their land. You know, that's kind of what me and my wife did at our place. When it comes to infrastructure, I say a little at a time because infrastructure is not cheap. Anytime you build any fence or lay a water line or dig a well, it's there's some dollars involved in there and you know, you need to calculate that out. Make certain you can still cash flow or you know where the money is going to come from. Can you afford it? What's it going to do for you? What's the return on investment going to be? How long is it going to take to pay off? I mean, there's all kinds of considerations especially when you start spending money on your ranch. for producers who are overstocked but maybe fighting that concept of change and how to start and where to start. What are some questions you recommend they ask themselves? Are they over carrying capacity? If they're over carrying capacity, can they reduce the size of their herd? And if if the answer is yes to that, I mean you obviously anybody can reduce their size of the herd, but they have to be willing to do that. You know, I know a lot of purebred breeders and they say it's my genetics that make me profitable. And I will argue with them. It's the decisions they made choosing those genetics that made those genetics profitable. In their mind, it genetics has nothing to do. It's the choices they made in choosing those genetics. So, you know, if we are overstocked, my first recommendation is to start, you know, getting rid of those unproductive, if we're straight cow calf, getting rid of those unproductive cows. If we have multiple enterprises, maybe we're running goats and or sheep or stalkers or cow calf, whatever enterprises we got, evaluate each one of those enterprises to make certain they're all profitable and then choose the mix of enterprises that's going to make us the most money and that we want to mess with and use those enterprises moving forward. setting the carrying capac getting the carrying capacity right and setting stock density appropriately cuz quite often what happens down here is you know everybody's dependent upon that spring rain and then when we don't get that spring rain and we go dry you know we're not going to grow as much forge and now all of a sudden we've got to sell cows and if you want to talk about an emotional decision that's when you decide you have to sell cows in a drought which cows are you going to sell that becomes very emotional to a lot of people. So, you know, if you set your carrying capacity below or I mean set your stocking rate below carrying capacity, then you automatically got a little bit of a buffer in those years that's dry, you may not have to destock at all. You may be able to not destock as much, take out fewer animals. Those years where it we get adequate rain or a lot of rain and we've got a whole lot of forage and you're sitting there thinking, I've got all this forge. What can I do with it? I don't have enough cows. Well, there's opportunities there. you know, we can bring in a a set of yardings and graze in there. We may u be able to bring in some cows that we contract graze on our place. Maybe there's some areas we wanted to do some land improvements and maybe we're going to set aside some land that we've always wanted to burn but just didn't have the forge. So, you know, those gives you opportunities that way. All right. Well, as people go ahead and think about our conversation today, if they want to dive deeper into this or get more information, what resources should they go to or do you recommend? They can always go to our website. It's noble.org. There's some articles. Uh there's a list of our classes that they could attend if they want to do that. I know we've got several coming up in several different states pretty quickly. There's all kinds of other groups that are out there, podcasts such as yourself, YouTube channels, different things like that. The regenerative ranching movement is becoming more mainstained, I mainstay, I believe. So, there's opportunities everywhere to look for information. All right. Well, I really appreciate our conversation today and your willingness to share your knowledge and expertise. For those of you who are listening, you can find the link to the Noble website in the show notes. It's under that description there. It'll be easy for you to find there. And with that, happy ranching, folks.",
