00:00:03,610 --> 00:00:11,440
[Music]

2
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,519
all right i've got the seed

3
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:15,280
what's the seeding rate how deep do i

4
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,520
need to plant this

5
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:19,760
there's a lot of questions around how to

6
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,800
plant cover crop seeds so this one i do

7
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:22,480
want to spend a

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:24,000
decent amount of time on so maybe we'll

9
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,960
just piece this up but

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,640
um how do you find the seeding rate or

11
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:31,039
the bushel weight on the cover crop seed

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,160
that we send out

13
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:37,120
hey you want me to handle that keith or

14
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:39,120
well i'll handle that first part there

15
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,320
when you get

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:44,000
and i don't know i'll throw one out and

17
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,239
hold it up here as dale's talking but

18
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:47,760
when you get the seat analysis sheet

19
00:00:46,239 --> 00:00:50,480
it's going to save the seating rate

20
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,480
right on there

21
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:54,719
and and that will tell you 30 pounds an

22
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:56,800
acre 40 pounds an acre

23
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,079
and if you can't find that all you got

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:59,920
to do is

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,760
is take the number of acres that you're

26
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:03,600
doing the number of pounds of seed that

27
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,360
you have and just do the math

28
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,159
and you'll be able to tell very quickly

29
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:09,840
what your seeding rate needs to be

30
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
setting the drill is going to be a

31
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,000
little bit different deal

32
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:15,759
we are working on and probably won't be

33
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,600
this year but next year

34
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:21,439
um on those analysis reports it's going

35
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,240
to tell you what the bushel weight of

36
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:24,960
your overall

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:26,320
mix is going to be and again that's not

38
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,360
going to tell you how to set your drill

39
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,520
but it's going to be one

40
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,119
factor involved in helping you get close

41
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,560
and get started so

42
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,119
that's what we're printing out and

43
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:36,720
providing on the papers that we send you

44
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,640
and then once you get that then you have

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,880
to actually get that applied to your

46
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,399
drill so dale go ahead and talk about

47
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,360
several different ways that

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,399
the customer can do that yeah i mean

49
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,520
obviously there's

50
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:52,720
there's no drill setting for uh

51
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:57,360
you know a mixture of oats

52
00:01:52,720 --> 00:02:00,159
peas veg radishes uh you know

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,360
there just isn't one and so a lot of

54
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,560
people are confused

55
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:08,080
well how do i set my grill well um

56
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:11,280
box grills meter out seed not

57
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
based on weight but on volume and the

58
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,040
way we

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,120
you know the the english system and that

60
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,879
and american agriculture

61
00:02:17,120 --> 00:02:23,680
of measuring volume is in bushels so

62
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:25,680
it becomes important to determine what

63
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:26,800
is your bushel weight well one way of

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,560
doing that

65
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:31,840
um is to have one of these handy dandy

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:36,480
little bushel weight

67
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:39,040
apparatus and you know

68
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,959
you put seed in here and then you just

69
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,280
move this little

70
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:44,640
balance and it'll tell you your your

71
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:48,560
bushel weight

72
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:51,840
and then you basically find something

73
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:54,319
you know similar on your chart

74
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
of that bushel weight and set your drill

75
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:58,159
that way

76
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:59,120
and another way of doing it is to

77
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:01,360
mathematically

78
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:02,560
calculate go ahead no how much are those

79
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,519
i mean where do you get those

80
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:06,959
i we sell them but how do people get a

81
00:03:05,519 --> 00:03:09,200
hold of those

82
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,959
well i said yeah you said it we sell

83
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,760
them so

84
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,760
how much are they

85
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:18,080
they're like 65 so they're you know

86
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:20,080
they're they're

87
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:21,599
a nice investment because you can use

88
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:23,920
those for planting wheat or

89
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,519
oats or peas they'll work for anything

90
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,760
and they're really easy to use

91
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:28,879
uh they're made out of plastic they're

92
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
fairly tough but

93
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,000
i mean don't run over them so you know

94
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,760
if you have a toolbox

95
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:36,080
or something on your drill we we just

96
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,920
carry we have a big plastic toolbox

97
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:40,080
bolted on the back of our drill and and

98
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,560
that just rides back there all the time

99
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,519
and it'll hold up for many many years if

100
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:45,920
as long as you're not

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:47,280
stepping on it or dropping it stuff like

102
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:49,680
that so 65 bucks

103
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,680
uh you just have to request it and we

104
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:54,159
can send it out with the seed

105
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,040
yeah you can also uh kind of do a

106
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:58,080
mathematical

107
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:58,480
calculation of about what your bushel

108
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,439
weight

109
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,080
is and noah can i share my screen i can

110
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,519
kind of run

111
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,720
through i put about six seven slides

112
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:15,840
together that kind of

113
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:15,840
through the process

114
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:29,840
uh

115
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:39,280
okay so basically i i just put

116
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:42,960
an example here of an op blend

117
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,840
and so you want to convert this to

118
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,400
bushels

119
00:04:43,840 --> 00:04:48,720
so let's just say we have a mix it's 94

120
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,639
pounds of seed per acre

121
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:55,600
64 pounds of oats and 30 pounds of peas

122
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,880
how do you set the drill so let's go

123
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,240
through the procedure

124
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:03,360
so we want to convert that into bushels

125
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:05,680
because drills don't plant pounds

126
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:06,560
they plant bushels they plant a certain

127
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:10,560
volume

128
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:11,600
when you set them so oats are 32 pounds

129
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:15,840
of bushel

130
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:19,520
so the 64 pounds of oats is two bushels

131
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:20,320
the peas are 60 pounds of bushels so 30

132
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,520
pounds

133
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:27,280
is half bushel so the is

134
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:29,280
two total a half bushels and so you just

135
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,840
set the drill to the approximate

136
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:33,440
number of bushels uh two and a half

137
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:40,000
bushels would be

138
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:43,440
80 pounds of oats or 150 pounds of peas

139
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:46,320
two and a half times 32 is 80

140
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:47,600
for the oats two and a half times 60 is

141
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:49,759
150

142
00:05:47,600 --> 00:05:52,080
obviously two completely different

143
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:54,639
numbers but if you do

144
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,520
both those settings you'll find out

145
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,280
they're

146
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,400
almost exactly the same drill setting

147
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,639
even though they're dramatically

148
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,360
different numbers

149
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:07,120
because of the density the but the

150
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,440
completely different busheling

151
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,199
now i want to stress this does not

152
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,720
replace calibration

153
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,639
and so i'll go through a quick

154
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,400
calibration procedure

155
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,960
for a box drill and the things you need

156
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,400
something to catch the seed in scales

157
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:24,880
and of course

158
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:25,440
the drill and a means of raising the

159
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:28,639
drill

160
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:31,520
up if you've got a pole type drill um

161
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:33,360
you'll want to have some jacks a couple

162
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:35,440
jacks to raise it up

163
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:36,400
so that you can spin the drive wheel

164
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:39,520
freely

165
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:41,600
and so here's your procedure um put the

166
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:43,120
seed in the drill

167
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
measure the circumference of your

168
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:48,400
driveway i i probably should have put a

169
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,759
a tape measure measuring tape on there

170
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:51,680
as well

171
00:06:49,759 --> 00:06:53,199
whatever your drive will if it's an end

172
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,000
wheel or you know

173
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:57,199
measure that driveway the distance

174
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,039
around it

175
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:00,479
then raise the drill off the ground

176
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:03,120
whether it's three-point

177
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,720
or jacks uh whatever it takes to get

178
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,880
that drill off the ground so you can

179
00:07:04,720 --> 00:07:10,160
spin the drive wheel

180
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:11,759
place the tarp underneath the drill

181
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:13,680
in the drive wheel i like to do it a

182
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:14,840
hundred times because it makes the math

183
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,170
easier

184
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:19,440
um weigh the seed that's in the tarp

185
00:07:18,170 --> 00:07:23,199
[Music]

186
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,560
and then you just do the math

187
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:28,319
your pounds per acre is you just plug it

188
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:31,039
into this equation

189
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,360
your pounds collected on the tarp and

190
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,919
the

191
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,479
area is going to be your drill width

192
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,840
that's a

193
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:39,199
10 foot drill 30 foot drill times your

194
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,360
tire circumference

195
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,400
your length your width is of course the

196
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:44,240
drill width

197
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:46,000
and the length that you travel during

198
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:49,039
that calibration is going to be

199
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:51,440
your tire circumference times the number

200
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:54,960
of times you spun

201
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,840
and there's 43 560 square feet of an

202
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:59,120
acre

203
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:02,160
so you just convert that

204
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:04,560
area that you planted

205
00:08:02,160 --> 00:08:05,599
to acres and that gives you your pounds

206
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,360
break

207
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,000
so if if anybody you know that this is

208
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:14,319
going to be

209
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:16,720
posted um so you can

210
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,560
review this later if you need to yeah

211
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,800
and i'll note too

212
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,680
dale and i have a plan here we're going

213
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:26,400
to try and get a drill calibration video

214
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,919
made so that it'll be more in depth and

215
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
we'll actually probably do that on our

216
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:32,800
drill so that

217
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:35,200
you'll be able to see that and dale very

218
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:38,880
likely probably just sold about 50 of

219
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,880
those little drill calibrators

220
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,320
because if you want to want to go do all

221
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,160
that math just by submit 65 bucks

222
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:49,120
and yeah for those little deals it's

223
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:53,519
really quick and simple to use

224
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:54,959
yeah and and uh i i used to teach math

225
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,959
and people say well

226
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:58,080
i'll just pay somebody to do this for me

227
00:08:56,959 --> 00:08:59,519
in the future

228
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:01,360
that's that's what you're doing right

229
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:01,680
there that that's what we're doing right

230
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,160
there

231
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:09,760
so yeah um i i found that

232
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:12,560
nobody has time to calibrate a drill

233
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,760
but everybody has time to drive 400

234
00:09:12,560 --> 00:09:16,800
miles to get

235
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:16,800
two more bags of seed

236
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,760
yes so it's better to calibrate

237
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:25,279
than to run out and be scrambling and

238
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:28,160
scraping for seed later

239
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:30,399
it's on the paper and when you get your

240
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:33,680
especially if you're getting a tote bag

241
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,760
if we are shipping that and you look in

242
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,120
the little plastic holder on the tote

243
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,360
it's going to have your address the

244
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:39,920
shipping label in there you have to look

245
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,560
behind

246
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,399
it to get the seed analysis sheet and

247
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,399
that's where the pounds per acre and

248
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:48,320
eventually the bushel wait for

249
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,839
for the overall mix is going to be as

250
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:52,640
well

251
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,839
most of those bags do not have multiple

252
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
plastic holders

253
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:58,800
so we have to put both those pieces of

254
00:09:55,440 --> 00:10:05,140
paper in that one little

255
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:07,200
ziploc bag holder thing on the toe

256
00:10:05,140 --> 00:10:09,279
[Music]

257
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:09,279
