00:00:08,610 --> 00:00:14,340
getting some leaves on them and we've

7
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:15,870

you over here I'm gonna update you what

10
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:22,109
they're doing today is they're hauling

11
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:23,730
off some big brush piles in the dump

12
00:00:22,109 --> 00:00:24,269
truck moving them to the other side of

13
00:00:23,730 --> 00:00:25,560
the farm

14
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:28,289
and we're going to go over here and

15
00:00:25,560 --> 00:00:31,320
basically direct traffic not direct

16
00:00:28,289 --> 00:00:33,750
traffic out in the road but actually

17
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:35,760
direct them to what we want them to do

18
00:00:33,750 --> 00:00:37,260
with these huge rocks out on the pond

19
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,600
and I'll show you we're gonna go over

20
00:00:37,260 --> 00:00:41,100
here we're gonna put huge rocks out on

21
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:43,200
the pond so we'll have a place to like

22
00:00:41,100 --> 00:00:45,030
hop rock to rock to go fishing you want

23
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:47,550
to finish the project off nicely we want

24
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:49,170
to have beautiful landscape and part of

25
00:00:47,550 --> 00:00:52,320
finishing this land clearing project

26
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:54,000
behind me here is landscaping so we put

27
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:55,260
some big stones up here and we'll just

28
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,610

35
00:01:53,679 --> 00:01:57,409
alright guys we're gonna follow the

36
00:01:56,450 --> 00:02:00,560
excavator

37
00:01:57,409 --> 00:02:03,189
over here actually we're gonna beat the

38
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,189
excavator over

39
00:02:04,030 --> 00:02:07,840
so he's coming down the hill here with

40
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:10,270
the excavator and all this may seem kind

41
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:13,210
of silly to you but it's what I want and

42
00:02:10,270 --> 00:02:16,080
I want to be able to hop rock to rock

43
00:02:13,210 --> 00:02:18,490
out here and fish in my fish pond so

44
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,010
that's what I want so let's watch him do

45
00:02:18,490 --> 00:02:25,470
it I'm gonna direct rock traffic should

46
00:02:21,010 --> 00:02:28,810
be fun can't have fun what good's life

47
00:02:25,470 --> 00:02:31,420
send him right there take that one and

48
00:02:28,810 --> 00:02:34,720
set it out as the next step and then

49
00:02:31,420 --> 00:02:37,360
we'll take bigger and bigger out to the

50
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:39,670
next steps leave about that much space

51
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:42,220
in between them if you can this guy's

52
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:43,900
looking at me like I'm an idiot paying

53
00:02:42,220 --> 00:02:48,790
200 bucks an hour here and I want to

54
00:02:43,900 --> 00:02:50,590
have some fun with it folks don't forget

55
00:02:48,790 --> 00:02:51,940
click that like button down there just

56
00:02:50,590 --> 00:02:54,220
pound it pound that like button right

57
00:02:51,940 --> 00:02:55,660
now boom hit it okay it helps the

58
00:02:54,220 --> 00:02:57,040
channel a whole lot help support the

59
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,540
channel and helps get these videos out

60
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:01,170

61
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:01,170
alright

[Music]

64
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:37,870
the pond is swallowing them up more than

65
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:40,150
I thought it would if the danger here is

66
00:04:37,870 --> 00:04:42,940
that the excavator could actually tip

67
00:04:40,150 --> 00:04:45,600
over into the pond but we got bulldozers

68
00:04:42,940 --> 00:04:45,600
we can get it out

69
00:04:46,610 --> 00:04:51,280
these boulders are thousands of pounds

70
00:05:12,090 --> 00:05:14,930
biscuit biscuit

00:05:41,570 --> 00:05:44,730
[Music]

72
00:06:00,529 --> 00:06:06,819
this is the most dangerous rock it's the

73
00:06:02,659 --> 00:06:06,819
biggest one it runs a risk of tipping

74
00:06:21,260 --> 00:06:24,590
I don't know if you saw that or not he

75
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:27,160
told me if it starts the tip I'm

76
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:27,160
dropping it

77
00:07:07,770 --> 00:07:12,120
I told them to just start piling rocks

78
00:07:09,960 --> 00:07:14,759
just start making a big pile out in the

79
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:16,770
water back here and hopefully by the end

80
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:18,599
of the pile you'll finish off with some

81
00:07:16,770 --> 00:07:20,069
nice big smooth rocks it's gonna be

82
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:21,479
really cool I might even mount like a

83
00:07:20,069 --> 00:07:24,780
fighting chair out there where you can

84
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:28,190
just sit down and rotate fish catch a

85
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,190
big bass be awesome

86
00:07:54,870 --> 00:08:00,920
I think a little more thought needs to

87
00:07:59,190 --> 00:08:03,690
go into this

88
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:05,910
they just keep sinking up or falling

89
00:08:03,690 --> 00:08:07,590
over in the water I think probably the

90
00:08:05,910 --> 00:08:09,300
best thing to do would have been to put

91
00:08:07,590 --> 00:08:11,040
the really rough rocks on the bottom and

92
00:08:09,300 --> 00:08:13,920
make a pile and then put the pretty rock

93
00:08:11,040 --> 00:08:15,360
on the top while we're working here guys

94
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:18,630
I'll tell you what's going on today

95
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,880
today most of the burn piles on this

96
00:08:18,630 --> 00:08:22,500
side of the farm have gone out and

97
00:08:20,880 --> 00:08:24,480
what's happening is these picking up

98
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:26,430
these burn piles and he's taking them

99
00:08:24,480 --> 00:08:28,290
over across on the other side of the

100
00:08:26,430 --> 00:08:30,720
farm with the dump truck and what we're

101
00:08:28,290 --> 00:08:32,880
doing there is eventually once they get

102
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:34,560
cold once they're not burning anymore we

103
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:35,910
have a big gully and we're gonna fill in

104
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:37,350
that gully now we're not gonna make

105
00:08:35,910 --> 00:08:39,510
pasture out of that gully we're just

106
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:41,520
gonna fill in that gully with the old

107
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:43,080
stumps and stuff like that just makes

108
00:08:41,520 --> 00:08:44,430
sense so that's why you'll see in the

109
00:08:43,080 --> 00:08:47,750
drone footage I'll walk you through and

110
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:47,750
talk you through what's going on there

112
00:09:07,780 --> 00:09:11,770
[Music]

113
00:09:15,730 --> 00:09:19,760
one of the cool things about doing this

114
00:09:17,840 --> 00:09:22,010
right here is that it's gonna make good

115
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,630
fish habitat and it's also going to make

116
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:26,090
a place for the turtles to crawl up on

117
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,560
so what a beautiful farm beautiful place

118
00:09:26,090 --> 00:09:29,560
and good habitat for wildlife

119
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:40,380
so we're about to wrap it up right here

120
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,270
we got one more rock we're gonna put on

121
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:44,280
here it's a big old flat rock that's

122
00:09:42,270 --> 00:09:45,840
about it so we'll take you over with the

123
00:09:44,280 --> 00:09:47,790
drone walk you through what's going on

124
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,700
the process that's going on the thought

125
00:09:47,790 --> 00:09:52,650
process and see you next time hopefully

126
00:09:50,700 --> 00:09:54,630
we'll be digging with a disc harrow to

127
00:09:52,650 --> 00:09:56,100
try to loosen up the land and then we'll

128
00:09:54,630 --> 00:09:58,830
run over it with the seed drill a

129
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:00,750
no-till seed drill would be real fun so

130
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:03,570
come on back and see me all right so you

131
00:10:00,750 --> 00:10:05,640
stand on the Stoney Ridge guys all right

132
00:10:03,570 --> 00:10:07,770
so we've got a view of the farm right

133
00:10:05,640 --> 00:10:10,290
here and this is just an overview across

134
00:10:07,770 --> 00:10:11,610
from our house if you look up right in

135
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:13,320
the center of your screen that's the

136
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:16,200
next area that we're gonna be clearing

137
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:17,550
off for field for pasture and you see a

138
00:10:16,200 --> 00:10:20,160
couple hay bales in the middle of the

139
00:10:17,550 --> 00:10:21,810
field this spot we're traveling over

140
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:23,700
right now was a spot that was gully

141
00:10:21,810 --> 00:10:26,280
washed and we had him fixed that we're

142
00:10:23,700 --> 00:10:29,130
gonna drill seed down in that and we'll

143
00:10:26,280 --> 00:10:34,440
pop over the dump truck here and watch

144
00:10:29,130 --> 00:10:37,310
the caterpillar 963 B go at it here it's

145
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:40,380
a cab model six-cylinder caterpillar

146
00:10:37,310 --> 00:10:43,980
basically he's scooping up remnants of

147
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:46,800
where we had a fire and pretty much

148
00:10:43,980 --> 00:10:49,140
he'll just go along all the way through

149
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,150
the farm anywhere they're remnants of

150
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:52,800
where we had a fire he's scooping it up

151
00:10:51,150 --> 00:10:54,930
putting it in the dump truck and taking

152
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,750
it over to a gully on the back side of

153
00:10:54,930 --> 00:11:00,540
the farm and dumping them out and then

154
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,240
pushing them over into the gully to fill

155
00:11:00,540 --> 00:11:05,610
that in just a spot on the farm where we

156
00:11:03,240 --> 00:11:07,500
needed a hole filled in and it's better

157
00:11:05,610 --> 00:11:09,600
than leaving them out there in the

158
00:11:07,500 --> 00:11:12,030
middle of the field for another two

159
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:14,820
years like the previous piles they all

160
00:11:12,030 --> 00:11:16,770
just kind of set out there so pretty

161
00:11:14,820 --> 00:11:18,990
good shot of the caterpillar at work

162
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:20,580
right here and that's it just want to

163
00:11:18,990 --> 00:11:23,190
let you guys know what's going on here

164
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:25,770
stay tuned for the next vlog or so and

165
00:11:23,190 --> 00:11:27,960
you'll see the progress as things have

166
00:11:25,770 --> 00:11:31,410
gone on they'll clean this up and we'll

167
00:11:27,960 --> 00:11:34,260
take a huge disc harrow and drag over

168
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:35,850
the fields and loosen the dirt and then

169
00:11:34,260 --> 00:11:40,310
we'll go through and seed it so the next

170
00:11:35,850 --> 00:11:40,310
vlog should be cleaning up the fields
