  "text": "[Music] and honor at Antonio's farm and I've been farming here for ever since 2012 I have good years and bad years but this year is look like it's going to be a better year than last year so I'm [Music] happy well I have here raspberries corn and strawberries then some blueberries but the blueberry plants were small so they probably take another three years to be able to harvest some and some sweet corn is coming and peppers tomatoes becoming some and that's about it but what I really interest is in berries I'm a berry guy well because this what I've been growing for the last six years you know raspberries and strawberries and now I'm trying blueberries but kind of difficult to grow because I never grown before so I don't know what the and puts to put it on but I'm leing little by little well my great grandfather was agriculture my grandpa then my dad and now myself so we've been in generation in agriculture for a while we from Mexico you know we were farming over there a long time and then year 2000 uh no 1972 I came over here when I was 18 years old and then I started working in ores grown pears then I work for 28 years around here around here in the and then two year 2000 I quit working in or and then I started growing my own bches then little by little I just became to be a produce more and more and now I I produce around 4 acres and that's how yeah 4 acres and that's how I started so I'm in this business ever since 2006 I was I started over there in Sans Valley then I farm over there for about 5 years then I mve over here 2012 then I've been here ever since yeah I've been putting some food liers you know horse food liers in there and messed it up with the soil and the soil is looking great now so and then un organic so I don't use any chemical fertilizers or pesticides whatsoever so I just do fertilizer I me uh uh what do you call it [Music] those manur yeah I SC those in the fall so that way if you be any problems the so you clean them out so and then that's how I do it I have some problems with the bugs you know they sometimes they eat 25% but then I get the 75% myself and that's how it's been working but I learn that if you keep a healthy plants then the bags leave him alone strawberries you know I just I work for somebody before I start growing it this is back in the year 2000 I was working for this guy I don't remember his name but he was in the Apple gate area so he was a strawberry growing so I work for him for three different seasons then I learned some then year year 26 I started growing my own and I've been ruing making mistakes and there and I've been uh growing St ever since well no I buy the plants first then after that then then the starts I just transplanted every year then when they get four or five years old then I get new ones I order some more new plants and planting and do another four years and then rotate it that's it so this is my second year and different brighty than for The Last 5 Years because this is no brighty and seems to me it's working really well because you can see the size of the ber is pretty good size and this bright is everywhere so once it's adult they just keep it producing all the way to October and you have upic well where do you sell your products I sell my products at the farmers grow yeah Farmers Market three days a week iand Co-op and shopping cart but I haven't done that for the last two years because we had a bad years not not enough water so I hoping I get back again in a year or two but I usually do you pick but this year I don't think I'm be going to be able because I don't have enough so some guy calling me that he wanted 20,000 lb no I don't even answer him because shoot no I don't have that me I don't know where he was from but he left me a message he he was interested in buy strawberries he go he wanted 20,000 lb way too much fun my wife my kids they helped me doing Harvest but the rest I do myself you know planting and weeding and all that irrig I do myself because I have it tractor and I have good implements I can take care and I can do that myself s Valley I was farming over there back and I I started over there 2006 and work all the way to 2010 but I was not enough water in there I was pretty R so I was irrigating three pounds you know so we get it a good good heavy rainy year then we sto out water but when I was a light year raining so then it was same problem we last two years so then I move over here and I was plenty water for the next four years I think yeah and then last year in the year before we we start having the same problem not an hour but this year it look like it's is going to be enough enough water I just last all my strawberries that I had before because they they die and some of got disease because being so right not an hour and early spring and lay fall that will these all new plants that that I planted in this planting in uh last June so I just plant this little area here to get new plants and then the rest I grab the plants for here and Transplant them over there and the other fields right over there so you can see this B 12 rows in there and I have another area I can put some more later whenever I get enough plants and up above are the raspberry and then yeah then I have raspberries over there The Raspberries got a little hurt too you can see the area in the m and how the ton and jell they're dying too because of that but they're going to come back once I keep them water enough for now on they getting new new starts coming we I grow some masac my wife make a toras tamales you know so this year I did it that because I I was have extra L because you know takes a little a whole year to fill it up with the strawberries but usually when I grow most is strawberries and raspberries but this year you know I didn't had enough plants for the whole field so I grow a little corn here and there just to keep everything F and peppers too peppers I have some peppers that I grow for people you know and sometimes I make a salsa for my myself for the winter yeah so you know we've been living off the farm my family and I so I don't hire people cuz this is a family farm and my my children don't want to be a farmer they they think it's too much work so they don't want to be getting a stu like me working all the time is lot of work sometimes it's not enough money you know so but I do because I like it and I enjoy eat what I grow and if something be coming later hard time to get it food then I can grow my own so I'm not afraid of that cuz I can grow food so probably never happen but I'm prepared oh that's right I'm not make it a lot of money but enough just to survive sometimes I got to borrow some money for my friends not a lot because I never want to get involved with the banks because then in a bad year I know I can lose my business so it's really hard for me but I'm happy that I still UNS survive that's the way yeah that's the way yeah so and I'm making a lot of money but sometimes I just make enough to survive then sometimes when the in the winter time then I work for somebody else doing pruning so I can make it money for to eat in that time so I'm not dependent all by the farm so I do a lot of pruning fruit trees because I after I harvest the corn till it end and prepareing for for the garlet because the garlet I plant them in October and November I put some in in October CLE teres because it's four teres so I do four two and then November I do the other two then that way I can have a little Oly garet for them there's a three-year-old plants but for the last two years they didn't grow any because I didn't put enough water I was just keeping alive and and I'm happy I did because I was using drip just to make him survive but now it's pling water so I've been giving him enough so you can see I have no grown sometimes it's a 10 in long already so I'm happy they're coming see then these blueberries for their down one brighty Orly is calling chanders and for here up is another seven row this call it aoras and they coming in a later like in September October so I I have different varies they grow different time so that way I can have a little long season because if I get a whole bunch all in once it's no no work for me because I sell so much in each market so I like have a little bit but long process and then over here I plant last year seven chore RS at blackberry tnet and they like this ground boy they they doing really good look at they already have a little fruit so Tas because those who grow great and I I like that this is my raspberry patch and you can see all those RADS in there last year they were really solid road but I lost all those plants because for the Run being so right no water last year so and then you can see the rest of the plants and there some are dying but there's going to be new stars coming up always I always do so all these roads they come not going to replant it in a fall that way they can get it gone yeah I want to get some more plants after of this to and then fill it up that way see see how next year it will be here so it turn like a campus so I put it all the way around and look at the difference in the plants they look beautiful they like that and the fruga little l and these are organic 100% I never use no chemical feres or pesticides good stuff good and tasty that's why I like to be a farmer because nothing tastes better than from the bind to your mouth [Music]",
