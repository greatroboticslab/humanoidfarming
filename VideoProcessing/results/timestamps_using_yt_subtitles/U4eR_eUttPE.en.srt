2
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,279
I'm M dresser I own old turtle farm it's

3
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,080
located in East Hampton Massachusetts

4
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,840
and this is my assistant Farm manager

5
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:35,079
David

6
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:38,440
Shane old turtle farm is an 18 Acre Farm

7
00:00:35,079 --> 00:00:40,920
we have 12 acres of crop Land We Market

8
00:00:38,440 --> 00:00:43,680
mainly through a CSA with a little extra

9
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:48,280
going to some local grocery stores we

10
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:50,160
have 146 shares this season feeding 227

11
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,480
families cover crops are a real

12
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,879
important part of our farm we keep half

13
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,280
of our land in cover crop we use it

14
00:00:54,879 --> 00:01:00,079
mainly for our fertility program since

15
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:02,160
we don't use a lot of other types of f

16
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,680
ility here on the farm we also use it

17
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,840
for weed suppression we graze our layers

18
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,400
on

19
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,920
it we have a flock of layers that we

20
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:14,040
pasture on our cover crop throughout the

21
00:01:10,920 --> 00:01:16,720
season they are um Freer ranged within

22
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,560
an electric net that's moved every two

23
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:22,640
weeks and housed in Mobile coups that we

24
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:26,960
move every day they do um a lot of bug

25
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:29,240
control for us as well as create some

26
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:31,960
fertility we have a system whereby we

27
00:01:29,240 --> 00:01:35,560
have um cover crop next to crop so we

28
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:35,560
use it for beneficial habitats as

29
00:01:45,479 --> 00:01:52,079
well our field space is divided into

30
00:01:48,320 --> 00:01:54,880
sections of 30 beds there's a section of

31
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:58,200
cash crop bordered by two sections of

32
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,200
cover crop the next season those are are

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,759
rotated such that the cash crops are now

34
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,039
in sections where there was a cover crop

35
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:08,959
each of our sections U contains 30

36
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:12,120
permanent beds they're mostly 300 ft

37
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:13,760
long by 45 in Center to Center we also

38
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:17,720
keep these permanent beds exactly where

39
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:19,519
they are we use a a spater um and drive

40
00:02:17,720 --> 00:02:22,160
only on the pathways work walk only on

41
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:23,720
the pathways so the beds always remain

42
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:24,959
the same whether they're in cover crop

43
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:29,280
or in cash

44
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:30,599
crop after our cash crop we would seed

45
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,160
with Ryan

46
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:37,720
or just dry as the season gets colder um

47
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:41,040
then the middle of next season around

48
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:43,840
July that Ryan vet would be put down and

49
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,120
put into uh a cover crop that would

50
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:50,720
winter kill such as oats and peas or

51
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:53,239
sudex this section was in uh cash crop

52
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:56,800
earlier in the season and it's now been

53
00:02:53,239 --> 00:02:58,959
spaded down and put into Ryan VCH we are

54
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,519
on a permanent bed system so the

55
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:03,200
pathways always stay stay in the same

56
00:03:00,519 --> 00:03:05,120
place and the bed is planted with cover

57
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:08,159
crop we keep the pathways clean so that

58
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,920
we're able to find the bed the next

59
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:14,799
year uh we use a permanent bed system

60
00:03:10,920 --> 00:03:17,319
mainly to reduce compaction and to help

61
00:03:14,799 --> 00:03:20,440
with maintain good soil structure we

62
00:03:17,319 --> 00:03:23,480
sewed this the middle of August and we

63
00:03:20,440 --> 00:03:28,360
go by beds so Ryan vetch usually gets

64
00:03:23,480 --> 00:03:31,640
put down um 5 lb of rye and 2 lbs of VCH

65
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,480
per bed and since we go bed by bed we

66
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:34,680
just mix the seed according to the

67
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:36,159
number of beds we're going to put down

68
00:03:34,680 --> 00:03:38,840
at that

69
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:41,159
time this Ryan vetch will be allowed to

70
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:42,680
grow until it starts to head out and

71
00:03:41,159 --> 00:03:47,200
then it will be mowed we usually have to

72
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:49,319
mow twice for the Rye and then allow the

73
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:52,040
vet to come back through and flour and

74
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,360
we mow again for the vet and then it

75
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:58,480
will be spaded down and put into a

76
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:00,799
winter kill cover crop such as oats and

77
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:03,200
peas this is is the equipment we use for

78
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,480
planting our cover crop simple drop

79
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:07,640
Cedar that we purchased from Market farm

80
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:09,640
implement it's made by shaper Brothers

81
00:04:07,640 --> 00:04:12,079
it's adjustable according to the size

82
00:04:09,640 --> 00:04:14,519
seed that um you're putting down we

83
00:04:12,079 --> 00:04:16,919
incorporate it with a basket weeder we

84
00:04:14,519 --> 00:04:18,639
use a pipe on the back of the tractor

85
00:04:16,919 --> 00:04:21,440
that drags along the bed and that helps

86
00:04:18,639 --> 00:04:23,560
to create the compaction necessary for U

87
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:25,680
faster seed

88
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:28,960
germination this is a field of oats and

89
00:04:25,680 --> 00:04:32,560
peas was seated in the mid mid August

90
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:36,160
after space in down Ryan VCH the beds

91
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:39,600
are seated to about 5 lb of premixed

92
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,400
oats and peas per bed any of the legumes

93
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,680
that we put down we do inoculate them

94
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:44,840
prior to

95
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:48,240
seaing the other um part of our

96
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:50,479
fertility system is compost so um we

97
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:53,440
have to buy our compost in it's rather

98
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:56,560
expensive so we have been um using a lot

99
00:04:53,440 --> 00:04:58,320
of lagoons in our cover crop and hopes

100
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,639
and hoping to uh reduce the amount of

101
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:01,639
compost we have to use

102
00:05:12,720 --> 00:05:16,479
we've been experimenting with a

103
00:05:14,039 --> 00:05:19,800
combination of sudex and red clover

104
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:21,759
planted after a cash crop the sudex will

105
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:24,639
winter kill and then the red clover will

106
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:27,199
come back through uh in the spring and

107
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:30,160
remain through the next season the sudex

108
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:33,639
was put in after cash crop the middle of

109
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:36,919
August the seaing rate is um 3 lb of

110
00:05:33,639 --> 00:05:40,759
suex to 2 lbs of red clover per

111
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:42,000
bed sudex gives us a lot of biomass and

112
00:05:40,759 --> 00:05:44,240
then the red clover gives us the

113
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:47,120
nitrogen and red clover is something

114
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:48,880
that we can leave in throughout the next

115
00:05:47,120 --> 00:05:51,560
year we do not have to till it down and

116
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:54,280
put it into a crop that will winterkill

117
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:57,440
because couple times of Mowing and by

118
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,880
the following spring there's not so much

119
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,520
left it goes down very easy after the

120
00:05:59,880 --> 00:06:03,520
sudex is winterkilled this is what the

121
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:06,479
field will look like the sudex was left

122
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,919
in place the red clover has been mowed

123
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:11,360
four times through the season will be

124
00:06:08,919 --> 00:06:14,800
left here until spring when it will be

125
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:16,720
spaded down and put into a cash crop the

126
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:18,840
timing of the planting of sudex is very

127
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,199
important this sudex was planted in the

128
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,960
middle of August when it was still quite

129
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,520
warm this bed of sudex was planted two

130
00:06:24,960 --> 00:06:28,440
weeks later when it had started to cool

131
00:06:26,520 --> 00:06:30,639
off so it's obvious there's going to be

132
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:33,639
a substantial difference and the biomass

133
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:35,840
created by the sudex this section is an

134
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:37,880
example of needing to respond to uh

135
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,680
something that didn't work correctly it

136
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,199
was seeded into sudex and red clover

137
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:45,680
last year but this spring the red clover

138
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:49,039
didn't come through very well so in

139
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:51,599
order to um reduce our weed problem we

140
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:55,160
spaded the Clover in and planted it into

141
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,560
straight sudex the end of May we got a

142
00:06:55,160 --> 00:07:00,160
great stand of sudex and this has been

143
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,599
mowed three times

144
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:07,280
um has created a very good weed

145
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,280
suppressive situation
