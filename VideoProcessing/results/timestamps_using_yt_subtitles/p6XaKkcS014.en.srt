audience for these webinars we'll be

24
00:00:53,829 --> 00:00:57,399
collecting your questions throughout the

the questions in the chat box along the

29
00:01:03,219 --> 00:01:06,909
way and then we'll probably wind up

30
00:01:05,290 --> 00:01:10,110

Dilek strengthens extension in Feed the

127
00:05:13,570 --> 00:05:19,090
Future and aligned countries through

128
00:05:16,450 --> 00:05:22,540
three interlay interrelated sets of

129
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:24,490
activities these are Diagnostics studies

130
00:05:22,540 --> 00:05:27,010
such as we're presenting today on the

131
00:05:24,490 --> 00:05:30,970
private sector extension we've also done

132
00:05:27,010 --> 00:05:33,010
10 or 11 studies on assessments of

133
00:05:30,970 --> 00:05:35,410
extension in Feed the Future countries

134
00:05:33,010 --> 00:05:37,240
we also get involved in pilot

135
00:05:35,410 --> 00:05:39,640
engagements on the ground in different

136
00:05:37,240 --> 00:05:41,950
countries implementing best practices

137
00:05:39,640 --> 00:05:43,990
that we found through the Diagnostics

138
00:05:41,950 --> 00:05:46,540
and then we bring all the learning from

139
00:05:43,990 --> 00:05:49,360
the Diagnostics and engagements to the

140
00:05:46,540 --> 00:05:51,250
extension community in countries and

141
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:55,960
globally through communities of practice

142
00:05:51,250 --> 00:05:58,090
such as we're doing today so let me dive

143
00:05:55,960 --> 00:06:00,400
right in I think Julie mentioned that we

144
00:05:58,090 --> 00:06:03,130
want to summarize lessons learned and

145
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:05,980
also options to expand private sector

146
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:09,190
extension and advisory services we call

147
00:06:05,980 --> 00:06:11,680
it EAS at times through future US aid

148
00:06:09,190 --> 00:06:15,610
projects but also other investments and

149
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:17,500
the study inputs are including a global

150
00:06:15,610 --> 00:06:20,320
literature review I'll touch on that

151
00:06:17,500 --> 00:06:23,620
briefly and also a rapid desk review of

152
00:06:20,320 --> 00:06:28,210
US aid investments in 28 Feed the Future

153
00:06:23,620 --> 00:06:31,180
and aligned countries as I'm sure you're

154
00:06:28,210 --> 00:06:32,889
aware extension is recognized as

155
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:35,639
essential for program

156
00:06:32,889 --> 00:06:37,930
who are trying to transform AG systems

157
00:06:35,639 --> 00:06:40,689
governments and other investors who want

158
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:43,150
to address global social and economic

159
00:06:40,689 --> 00:06:46,900
development objectives such as reducing

160
00:06:43,150 --> 00:06:49,509
food insecurity poverty etc and both

161
00:06:46,900 --> 00:06:51,819
public and private organizations are

162
00:06:49,509 --> 00:06:55,749
active in extension and advisory

163
00:06:51,819 --> 00:06:58,029
services in most countries just to

164
00:06:55,749 --> 00:07:00,039
define for you who are we talking about

165
00:06:58,029 --> 00:07:02,529
with private sector actors and you'll

166
00:07:00,039 --> 00:07:04,629
hear excellent examples from Robert and

167
00:07:02,529 --> 00:07:06,550
Jean Michel we're talking about

168
00:07:04,629 --> 00:07:09,360
basically all the non-governmental

169
00:07:06,550 --> 00:07:12,969
actors so we're talking about both

170
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:16,120
nonprofit and for-profit entities these

171
00:07:12,969 --> 00:07:18,400
includes civil society and NGOs who are

172
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:22,029
trying to advance their organisational

173
00:07:18,400 --> 00:07:24,490
mandate it includes input suppliers and

174
00:07:22,029 --> 00:07:25,900
other for-profit entities they want to

175
00:07:24,490 --> 00:07:28,089
sell products they want to please their

176
00:07:25,900 --> 00:07:30,310
customers it includes people like

177
00:07:28,089 --> 00:07:32,499
product buyers who are trying to get

178
00:07:30,310 --> 00:07:35,770
adequate supplies of good quality

179
00:07:32,499 --> 00:07:37,419
commodities we also have consultants and

180
00:07:35,770 --> 00:07:40,509
consulting firms who are selling their

181
00:07:37,419 --> 00:07:42,669
services the media are also often

182
00:07:40,509 --> 00:07:45,759
for-profit marketing information

183
00:07:42,669 --> 00:07:47,710
services and then we have producer

184
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:50,889
organizations who want to service or

185
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:52,810
represent their groups interests so

186
00:07:50,889 --> 00:07:55,120
we'll be hearing about them in more

187
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:57,750
detail from my presentation and the case

188
00:07:55,120 --> 00:08:00,490
studies the private sector has always

189
00:07:57,750 --> 00:08:02,860
complimented public sector extension and

190
00:08:00,490 --> 00:08:04,599
advisory services and you might notice

191
00:08:02,860 --> 00:08:06,430
in the report and then the presentation

192
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,629
that we talk a lot about the public

193
00:08:06,430 --> 00:08:12,520
sector still and that comes because of

194
00:08:09,629 --> 00:08:14,979
the portfolio review that we did we saw

195
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:18,279
a strong role still of the public sector

196
00:08:14,979 --> 00:08:20,250
they important to complement the private

197
00:08:18,279 --> 00:08:22,750
sector and essential really to meet

198
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:24,430
objectives of different development

199
00:08:22,750 --> 00:08:26,080
partners and so that's why you hear

200
00:08:24,430 --> 00:08:29,680
about the public sector in this private

201
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:33,729
sector webinar but I'd like to jump also

202
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:35,440
into the literature review why the

203
00:08:33,729 --> 00:08:37,870
private sector why private sector

204
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,060
extension and advisory services well

205
00:08:37,870 --> 00:08:42,000
there's a lot of potential for private

206
00:08:40,060 --> 00:08:44,800
sector in terms of providing

207
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,720
sustainability of extension services of

208
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:49,089
meeting needs of farmers

209
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,970
I'll mention a few of these here they do

210
00:08:49,089 --> 00:08:54,970
increase profits to both the service

211
00:08:51,970 --> 00:08:57,550
provider and to the clientele of the

212
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:59,709
farmer so their shared value there it's

213
00:08:57,550 --> 00:09:02,560
also used to strengthen long term

214
00:08:59,709 --> 00:09:04,360
business relationships private sector is

215
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:06,220
good for promoting innovation and

216
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:09,189
service delivery including the use of

217
00:09:06,220 --> 00:09:11,949
ICTs and the private sector helps to

218
00:09:09,189 --> 00:09:14,259
ensure adequate quantities and quality

219
00:09:11,949 --> 00:09:17,139
of market products and they do

220
00:09:14,259 --> 00:09:20,379
participate as as financers as service

221
00:09:17,139 --> 00:09:22,480
providers as users of extension and

222
00:09:20,379 --> 00:09:25,629
advisory services and we saw that most

223
00:09:22,480 --> 00:09:28,959
US aid extension and advisory service

224
00:09:25,629 --> 00:09:33,220
projects implement by using private

225
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:34,959
contractors or grantees in addition to

226
00:09:33,220 --> 00:09:38,019
the potential of private sector there's

227
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:40,089
of course limitations as well and of

228
00:09:38,019 --> 00:09:42,370
course one of these is that they need

229
00:09:40,089 --> 00:09:44,110
cost recovery they're trying to get

230
00:09:42,370 --> 00:09:46,750
their cost back and even make some money

231
00:09:44,110 --> 00:09:49,779
in providing these services and as a

232
00:09:46,750 --> 00:09:51,939
result the coverage isn't always perfect

233
00:09:49,779 --> 00:09:54,189
it's sometimes limited to people who can

234
00:09:51,939 --> 00:09:56,170
afford to pay for services to people

235
00:09:54,189 --> 00:09:58,839
with the higher value crops and other

236
00:09:56,170 --> 00:10:01,689
products sometimes there's a perceived

237
00:09:58,839 --> 00:10:04,180
or an actual conflict of interest for

238
00:10:01,689 --> 00:10:06,129
people like maybe some input providers

239
00:10:04,180 --> 00:10:08,680
who people think are just trying to flog

240
00:10:06,129 --> 00:10:10,240
their product without necessarily you

241
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,540
know caring about the bigger picture of

242
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:16,029
what the producers need there's also the

243
00:10:13,540 --> 00:10:17,800
case that many extension providers from

244
00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:20,379
the private sector actually lack

245
00:10:17,800 --> 00:10:23,199
experience they lack capacity and

246
00:10:20,379 --> 00:10:25,509
interest in extension and advisory

247
00:10:23,199 --> 00:10:27,309
service provision there's also the issue

248
00:10:25,509 --> 00:10:28,990
of the nature of innovations you know

249
00:10:27,309 --> 00:10:31,660
there's the public versus the private

250
00:10:28,990 --> 00:10:33,730
goods and so certain innovations are

251
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:36,790
better for the private sector because

252
00:10:33,730 --> 00:10:38,649
commercialization is possible and then

253
00:10:36,790 --> 00:10:40,540
there's other goods such as public goods

254
00:10:38,649 --> 00:10:43,870
natural resource management and so forth

255
00:10:40,540 --> 00:10:47,829
that is less interesting for the private

256
00:10:43,870 --> 00:10:50,110
sector so that's quickly a review of the

257
00:10:47,829 --> 00:10:52,269
literature we want to make time for the

258
00:10:50,110 --> 00:10:55,630
case studies but now I want to walk into

259
00:10:52,269 --> 00:10:57,610
the portfolio review we looked at 28

260
00:10:55,630 --> 00:10:59,500
feed the future and aligned countries

261
00:10:57,610 --> 00:11:00,430
they're listed here and we've been in

262
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:03,190
touch with many

263
00:11:00,430 --> 00:11:05,980
of you we looked at a hundred and thirty

264
00:11:03,190 --> 00:11:09,820
three projects from the year 2010 to

265
00:11:05,980 --> 00:11:11,890
2019 and these projects that we looked

266
00:11:09,820 --> 00:11:14,950
at these programs were actually quite

267
00:11:11,890 --> 00:11:17,589
complex they had on average three point

268
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:20,230
six different components or objectives

269
00:11:17,589 --> 00:11:23,380
and some had more than ten so it's quite

270
00:11:20,230 --> 00:11:26,020
a lot that they were taking on only five

271
00:11:23,380 --> 00:11:28,209
of the projects were solely extension

272
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:31,209
and advisory services and these two of

273
00:11:28,209 --> 00:11:32,950
these were actually implemented by USDA

274
00:11:31,209 --> 00:11:35,890
the United States Department of

275
00:11:32,950 --> 00:11:37,750
Agriculture and about five to ten

276
00:11:35,890 --> 00:11:39,880
percent of the funding of these projects

277
00:11:37,750 --> 00:11:43,420
were for the extension and advisory

278
00:11:39,880 --> 00:11:46,209
services component so that's an overview

279
00:11:43,420 --> 00:11:52,060
of what we looked at for the portfolio

280
00:11:46,209 --> 00:11:55,149
review what we found we looked at first

281
00:11:52,060 --> 00:11:57,700
of all some design considerations when

282
00:11:55,149 --> 00:12:01,600
we looked at these 28 countries and 133

283
00:11:57,700 --> 00:12:04,089
projects design of programs is important

284
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,070
because it establishes the base for

285
00:12:04,089 --> 00:12:08,890
investment success or failure it

286
00:12:06,070 --> 00:12:11,709
determines the nature and extent of the

287
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:14,410
impact and what we found is there appear

288
00:12:11,709 --> 00:12:17,080
to be some significant design issues for

289
00:12:14,410 --> 00:12:19,180
extension and advisory services and for

290
00:12:17,080 --> 00:12:22,600
effective private sector participation

291
00:12:19,180 --> 00:12:24,400
in the systems the first of these is

292
00:12:22,600 --> 00:12:26,890
that there appeared to be a weak

293
00:12:24,400 --> 00:12:29,140
analytical base for design a lot of the

294
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:31,930
planning seem to have been maybe ad hoc

295
00:12:29,140 --> 00:12:33,790
done by contractors and grantees during

296
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:36,250
planning or as they started

297
00:12:33,790 --> 00:12:37,959
implementation and it didn't seem like

298
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:40,800
the strategy and approach was

299
00:12:37,959 --> 00:12:43,480
necessarily linked to some evidence base

300
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:46,029
relatedly we didn't find much of an

301
00:12:43,480 --> 00:12:49,180
evidence base for the content that was

302
00:12:46,029 --> 00:12:50,829
being promoted so we weren't sure why

303
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:52,959
these innovations were being promoted

304
00:12:50,829 --> 00:12:57,250
and how they were linked back to the

305
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:59,890
needs from the clientele thirdly as I

306
00:12:57,250 --> 00:13:02,079
mentioned the projects are quite complex

307
00:12:59,890 --> 00:13:04,240
you know there's a lot of activities in

308
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,420
many of these projects there's extension

309
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:09,430
services financial services input supply

310
00:13:07,420 --> 00:13:11,920
producer organizations irrigation

311
00:13:09,430 --> 00:13:13,810
mechanization market development all of

312
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:14,259
these are needed to enable change at the

313
00:13:13,810 --> 00:13:16,869
farm

314
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:19,179
but of course with so much complexity so

315
00:13:16,869 --> 00:13:22,109
much going on it's hard to give due

316
00:13:19,179 --> 00:13:24,910
attention to the extension component

317
00:13:22,109 --> 00:13:26,949
specifically and then we found very

318
00:13:24,910 --> 00:13:29,529
ambitious targets many of these were

319
00:13:26,949 --> 00:13:30,850
actually met or even exceeded but one

320
00:13:29,529 --> 00:13:33,609
wonder is when you're trying to reach

321
00:13:30,850 --> 00:13:35,649
such large targets in clientele does it

322
00:13:33,609 --> 00:13:39,220
compromise the quality and the intensity

323
00:13:35,649 --> 00:13:41,739
of the services so those are some design

324
00:13:39,220 --> 00:13:44,619
considerations we also looked at some of

325
00:13:41,739 --> 00:13:46,209
the implementation considerations too

326
00:13:44,619 --> 00:13:49,229
and as I mentioned we found this

327
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:52,239
surprisingly strong reliance on public

328
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:54,459
extension and advisory services this was

329
00:13:52,239 --> 00:13:57,189
true in almost all the projects even

330
00:13:54,459 --> 00:13:58,929
those with weak extension services and

331
00:13:57,189 --> 00:14:02,559
of course it's necessary to gain access

332
00:13:58,929 --> 00:14:05,229
to communities validate legitimacy and

333
00:14:02,559 --> 00:14:07,899
of course to provide content backup and

334
00:14:05,229 --> 00:14:10,779
so forth but that was found across the

335
00:14:07,899 --> 00:14:12,749
board in terms of methodologies very

336
00:14:10,779 --> 00:14:14,769
traditional we found farmer training

337
00:14:12,749 --> 00:14:16,749
demonstration field days and a

338
00:14:14,769 --> 00:14:19,019
sprinkling of others like mass media

339
00:14:16,749 --> 00:14:21,069
Affairs and so forth which is fine

340
00:14:19,019 --> 00:14:24,220
traditional methodologies are great

341
00:14:21,069 --> 00:14:27,009
where they work and as you see in point

342
00:14:24,220 --> 00:14:29,919
three radio was very common and very

343
00:14:27,009 --> 00:14:32,410
effective but we found limited

344
00:14:29,919 --> 00:14:35,769
applications of other information and

345
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:38,230
communication technologies or ICTs and

346
00:14:35,769 --> 00:14:40,089
effective communication is really at the

347
00:14:38,230 --> 00:14:42,519
heart of extension and advisory services

348
00:14:40,089 --> 00:14:46,689
so we might want to consider other

349
00:14:42,519 --> 00:14:48,910
applications of ICTs fourthly subsidies

350
00:14:46,689 --> 00:14:51,459
for inputs were very common they're

351
00:14:48,910 --> 00:14:53,769
often used to encourage adoption which

352
00:14:51,459 --> 00:14:55,749
is great but they are well known to

353
00:14:53,769 --> 00:14:56,889
distort market decisions and to be

354
00:14:55,749 --> 00:14:59,919
unsustainable

355
00:14:56,889 --> 00:15:02,439
of course most EAS programs are

356
00:14:59,919 --> 00:15:04,539
essentially subsidies themselves so then

357
00:15:02,439 --> 00:15:05,949
the issue becomes what do we subsidize

358
00:15:04,539 --> 00:15:10,089
how much and for how long

359
00:15:05,949 --> 00:15:12,309
and then lastly decentralization was a

360
00:15:10,089 --> 00:15:15,399
common issue 15 countries had

361
00:15:12,309 --> 00:15:18,579
decentralized their public systems while

362
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:21,839
carrying potential benefits they can be

363
00:15:18,579 --> 00:15:24,220
really chaotic disruptive they give new

364
00:15:21,839 --> 00:15:26,259
responsibilities it requires you know

365
00:15:24,220 --> 00:15:28,000
different financial arrangements

366
00:15:26,259 --> 00:15:30,550
different budgeting and so forth

367
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:38,379
so it's it's quite a long process and

368
00:15:30,550 --> 00:15:40,629
takes a lot of thinking we then looked

369
00:15:38,379 --> 00:15:43,389
at the different project roles that we

370
00:15:40,629 --> 00:15:45,459
found across the board and we found that

371
00:15:43,389 --> 00:15:47,649
producer organizations were ubiquitous

372
00:15:45,459 --> 00:15:51,339
they were used in all of the projects in

373
00:15:47,649 --> 00:15:53,350
all the countries most projects or

374
00:15:51,339 --> 00:15:55,480
evaluation reports that we looked at

375
00:15:53,350 --> 00:15:57,519
identified them as needed strengthening

376
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:00,250
but very little was actually provided

377
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,779
and now you'll hear more from John

378
00:16:00,250 --> 00:16:03,790
Michell about the use of producer

379
00:16:01,779 --> 00:16:07,180
organizations in the project he's

380
00:16:03,790 --> 00:16:08,920
presenting contact lead farmers farmer

381
00:16:07,180 --> 00:16:10,930
volunteers there's many different names

382
00:16:08,920 --> 00:16:12,579
these were also ubiquitous and they're

383
00:16:10,930 --> 00:16:14,379
important because they link the

384
00:16:12,579 --> 00:16:17,589
providers and the communities they

385
00:16:14,379 --> 00:16:19,629
expand the reach but of course you know

386
00:16:17,589 --> 00:16:21,220
there's there's issues with them which

387
00:16:19,629 --> 00:16:24,100
we can discuss if we have time at the

388
00:16:21,220 --> 00:16:26,379
end as well and then you'll be hearing

389
00:16:24,100 --> 00:16:28,389
more from Robert about the input dealers

390
00:16:26,379 --> 00:16:30,670
but they were very common as well across

391
00:16:28,389 --> 00:16:32,529
the board there's a strong common

392
00:16:30,670 --> 00:16:34,809
interest for promoting the use of inputs

393
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,240
from both you know the projects and the

394
00:16:34,809 --> 00:16:39,189
input providers themselves but we did

395
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:42,370
find that the capacity the range of

396
00:16:39,189 --> 00:16:50,019
services of input providers was often

397
00:16:42,370 --> 00:16:53,079
limited I want to move now to just

398
00:16:50,019 --> 00:16:55,809
talking about how can we invest what do

399
00:16:53,079 --> 00:16:58,329
we want to promote so that we can expand

400
00:16:55,809 --> 00:17:00,790
and strengthen private sector extension

401
00:16:58,329 --> 00:17:05,020
and advisory services what interventions

402
00:17:00,790 --> 00:17:07,209
can we bring in and I realize this is a

403
00:17:05,020 --> 00:17:11,049
very long list but I'm gonna talk about

404
00:17:07,209 --> 00:17:13,209
each of these points one by one excuse

405
00:17:11,049 --> 00:17:16,809
me so firstly I think this is a big

406
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:20,199
systems area we need to develop national

407
00:17:16,809 --> 00:17:22,600
extension policies and strategies or if

408
00:17:20,199 --> 00:17:25,089
they are already developed they need to

409
00:17:22,600 --> 00:17:27,579
be strengthened and implemented so the

410
00:17:25,089 --> 00:17:30,220
coherent public sector policies on

411
00:17:27,579 --> 00:17:32,020
extension are key they provide an

412
00:17:30,220 --> 00:17:34,630
enabling environment they either enable

413
00:17:32,020 --> 00:17:36,669
or disable private sector to come in and

414
00:17:34,630 --> 00:17:39,010
so they're very important and one

415
00:17:36,669 --> 00:17:41,770
intervention here for funders whether

416
00:17:39,010 --> 00:17:44,830
there may be programs or projects or fun

417
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:47,679
of any type including government you can

418
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:50,050
support formulation of national

419
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:53,530
extension and advisory service policies

420
00:17:50,050 --> 00:17:56,410
a second intervention is to strengthen

421
00:17:53,530 --> 00:17:59,590
the public sector this as I said before

422
00:17:56,410 --> 00:18:02,320
is a bit counterintuitive but the public

423
00:17:59,590 --> 00:18:05,290
sector really serves as a backbone of

424
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,179
the full extension and advisory service

425
00:18:05,290 --> 00:18:09,730
system so it's important to have a

426
00:18:07,179 --> 00:18:13,390
strong public sector so that we can have

427
00:18:09,730 --> 00:18:16,660
a strong private sector as well thirdly

428
00:18:13,390 --> 00:18:18,540
we need to improve support services for

429
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:21,550
extension these include things like

430
00:18:18,540 --> 00:18:24,400
training research subject matter

431
00:18:21,550 --> 00:18:27,010
specialists backstopping communications

432
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:30,120
monitoring and evaluation and so forth

433
00:18:27,010 --> 00:18:33,580
this is important for the private sector

434
00:18:30,120 --> 00:18:35,470
fifthly we want to strengthen producer

435
00:18:33,580 --> 00:18:37,720
organizations they are private sector

436
00:18:35,470 --> 00:18:40,179
entities they're key players for

437
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:42,850
effective and sustainable extension

438
00:18:40,179 --> 00:18:44,800
systems and I think more intentional

439
00:18:42,850 --> 00:18:47,200
effort is needed to bring more

440
00:18:44,800 --> 00:18:49,270
innovative approaches and to develop

441
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:50,710
further these organizations and I think

442
00:18:49,270 --> 00:18:54,490
we'll hear more about that from Jean

443
00:18:50,710 --> 00:18:56,830
Michel the sixth point is to strengthen

444
00:18:54,490 --> 00:18:58,860
the input suppliers they were also an

445
00:18:56,830 --> 00:19:01,330
important element for private sector

446
00:18:58,860 --> 00:19:04,660
extension and here we want to focus on

447
00:19:01,330 --> 00:19:06,610
improving professionalism management

448
00:19:04,660 --> 00:19:09,340
quality consciousness and things like

449
00:19:06,610 --> 00:19:11,620
that there's other private sector

450
00:19:09,340 --> 00:19:13,750
providers also that needs strengthening

451
00:19:11,620 --> 00:19:16,240
number seven we need we need to

452
00:19:13,750 --> 00:19:19,450
strengthen potential private sector

453
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,740
providers who might be weak it might be

454
00:19:19,450 --> 00:19:22,720
more efficient it might be more

455
00:19:20,740 --> 00:19:25,000
preferable to strengthen their capacity

456
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:27,730
give them business plans and business

457
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:30,490
models before expecting them to engage

458
00:19:27,730 --> 00:19:34,210
effectively in provision of EIS

459
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:37,059
themselves number eight we want to

460
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:38,890
strengthen quality certification system

461
00:19:37,059 --> 00:19:41,200
so when we're talking about the private

462
00:19:38,890 --> 00:19:43,929
sector we want to pay attention to the

463
00:19:41,200 --> 00:19:45,670
quality the objectivity the

464
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:48,460
qualifications of these different

465
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:50,559
providers and their accountability and a

466
00:19:48,460 --> 00:19:53,080
possibility here might be to fund

467
00:19:50,559 --> 00:19:55,390
technical assistance training or

468
00:19:53,080 --> 00:19:58,030
development costs for a system

469
00:19:55,390 --> 00:20:00,940
to establish standards to register

470
00:19:58,030 --> 00:20:02,799
certified extension providers I think

471
00:20:00,940 --> 00:20:06,730
Roberts gonna touch on that in his

472
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:09,549
presentation from Uganda and then number

473
00:20:06,730 --> 00:20:12,190
9 there's a need to strengthen and to

474
00:20:09,549 --> 00:20:14,470
establish stakeholder consultation

475
00:20:12,190 --> 00:20:16,540
programs things like innovation

476
00:20:14,470 --> 00:20:18,929
platforms where you bring together the

477
00:20:16,540 --> 00:20:22,360
public sector the private sector

478
00:20:18,929 --> 00:20:24,429
researchers agribusiness farmers to

479
00:20:22,360 --> 00:20:27,760
address specific problems or

480
00:20:24,429 --> 00:20:31,390
opportunities and then there's the issue

481
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,950
of subsidies so you know you might want

482
00:20:31,390 --> 00:20:36,669
to subsidize so that you're promoting

483
00:20:32,950 --> 00:20:38,830
adoption or uptake of innovations early

484
00:20:36,669 --> 00:20:41,710
in a project so you might want to think

485
00:20:38,830 --> 00:20:43,660
about strategically subsidizing and give

486
00:20:41,710 --> 00:20:47,049
things maybe for free or subsidized

487
00:20:43,660 --> 00:20:49,330
initially or or to get things going but

488
00:20:47,049 --> 00:20:51,190
be aware and have a sort of an exit

489
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,750
strategy for how you're gonna phase that

490
00:20:51,190 --> 00:20:57,309
out in the end and then finally the last

491
00:20:54,750 --> 00:20:59,950
investment intervention I think is to

492
00:20:57,309 --> 00:21:02,049
actually directly fund extension

493
00:20:59,950 --> 00:21:05,040
delivery and this is especially the case

494
00:21:02,049 --> 00:21:07,540
where it might be appropriate for

495
00:21:05,040 --> 00:21:10,150
post-crisis countries fragile states

496
00:21:07,540 --> 00:21:12,760
where you're serving disadvantaged

497
00:21:10,150 --> 00:21:15,730
populations or in natural resource

498
00:21:12,760 --> 00:21:17,740
conservation programs so these kinds of

499
00:21:15,730 --> 00:21:20,130
programs have an advantage that there's

500
00:21:17,740 --> 00:21:24,070
a direct link between the funding and

501
00:21:20,130 --> 00:21:25,840
the clientele and their impacts the

502
00:21:24,070 --> 00:21:29,230
disadvantage on the other hand is that

503
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:31,929
they're generally time can time limited

504
00:21:29,230 --> 00:21:36,940
not sustainable and they're limited in

505
00:21:31,929 --> 00:21:39,429
terms of scale as well one more slide

506
00:21:36,940 --> 00:21:41,860
and then I'll talk about how delet can

507
00:21:39,429 --> 00:21:44,080
come in and help some of the missions

508
00:21:41,860 --> 00:21:46,350
and so forth on this but we sort of

509
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,340
 these four recommendations

510
00:21:46,350 --> 00:21:51,960
according to four different scenarios

511
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:55,000
from a very weak public and weak private

512
00:21:51,960 --> 00:21:57,730
extension system to a very strong and

513
00:21:55,000 --> 00:21:59,980
strong public and strong private system

514
00:21:57,730 --> 00:22:02,380
and if you look in the report on the on

515
00:21:59,980 --> 00:22:04,870
the left that you can download you'll

516
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:07,750
find preliminary recommendations for

517
00:22:04,870 --> 00:22:09,429
each of the 28 countries the 28

518
00:22:07,750 --> 00:22:11,990
portfolios that

519
00:22:09,429 --> 00:22:14,299
of course these recommendations are

520
00:22:11,990 --> 00:22:17,120
highly tentative because this was a

521
00:22:14,299 --> 00:22:19,610
rapid review for detailed analysis is

522
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:23,000
needed but we can offer that I'll tell

523
00:22:19,610 --> 00:22:26,389
you in a minute how so starting in the

524
00:22:23,000 --> 00:22:30,110
top box if you have a weak public and a

525
00:22:26,389 --> 00:22:32,000
weak private system like in post crisis

526
00:22:30,110 --> 00:22:34,010
countries those with limited economic

527
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:36,260
development you might want to have

528
00:22:34,010 --> 00:22:39,080
direct delivery so you want to address

529
00:22:36,260 --> 00:22:41,690
these immediate needs and you want to

530
00:22:39,080 --> 00:22:43,730
focus probably on capacity development

531
00:22:41,690 --> 00:22:47,360
as a high priority especially that of

532
00:22:43,730 --> 00:22:49,159
producer organizations moving down to

533
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:52,279
the second row if you do have a weak

534
00:22:49,159 --> 00:22:54,710
public but a strong private system this

535
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:57,049
is probably rare if it exists at all but

536
00:22:54,710 --> 00:22:59,720
you can think about pockets of strong

537
00:22:57,049 --> 00:23:01,850
private sector extension maybe in

538
00:22:59,720 --> 00:23:04,340
countries that have plantation crops or

539
00:23:01,850 --> 00:23:06,559
something like that here you want to

540
00:23:04,340 --> 00:23:08,600
establish the necessary foundation you

541
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:11,990
want to provide capacity for the public

542
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:14,380
sector as a priority and in the third

543
00:23:11,990 --> 00:23:17,210
scenario where you have a strong public

544
00:23:14,380 --> 00:23:19,850
but a weak private sector extensions

545
00:23:17,210 --> 00:23:21,740
here's where you want to target support

546
00:23:19,850 --> 00:23:24,049
to strengthen the private sector and

547
00:23:21,740 --> 00:23:26,169
have support services strengthened

548
00:23:24,049 --> 00:23:29,330
technical specialist support and

549
00:23:26,169 --> 00:23:31,610
communications as well and then lastly

550
00:23:29,330 --> 00:23:34,039
if you're in a fortuitous situation that

551
00:23:31,610 --> 00:23:36,919
has a strong public and a strong private

552
00:23:34,039 --> 00:23:38,809
sector you have the basis for a strong

553
00:23:36,919 --> 00:23:41,480
and effective national system and

554
00:23:38,809 --> 00:23:43,820
activities here from donors and other

555
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:46,519
funders should strengthen capacities but

556
00:23:43,820 --> 00:23:49,309
also focus on coordination and may be

557
00:23:46,519 --> 00:23:52,370
gaps in serving underserved clientele as

558
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:54,830
well so the takeaway here that we really

559
00:23:52,370 --> 00:23:58,010
want to give you from the report is that

560
00:23:54,830 --> 00:24:01,070
this is a call to investment in national

561
00:23:58,010 --> 00:24:02,600
extension and advisory service system

562
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,460
development so looking at the whole

563
00:24:02,600 --> 00:24:07,549
picture all the different providers from

564
00:24:04,460 --> 00:24:09,320
a pluralistic environment I think the

565
00:24:07,549 --> 00:24:11,750
system development is key for

566
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:15,169
sustainability efficiency effectiveness

567
00:24:11,750 --> 00:24:17,929
of the private sector and it's been

568
00:24:15,169 --> 00:24:19,730
neglected in the past with inadequate

569
00:24:17,929 --> 00:24:23,000
attention to local capacity development

570
00:24:19,730 --> 00:24:25,309
and to analytical work in extension

571
00:24:23,000 --> 00:24:28,460
and advisory services there's a lot more

572
00:24:25,309 --> 00:24:30,530
recommendations in the overview that you

573
00:24:28,460 --> 00:24:32,419
can download and in the file the full

574
00:24:30,530 --> 00:24:35,210
file as well that I hope you'll take a

575
00:24:32,419 --> 00:24:36,830
look at and give us comments on I just

576
00:24:35,210 --> 00:24:39,770
want to close here before I turn it back

577
00:24:36,830 --> 00:24:41,900
to Julie with mentioning that D Lake the

578
00:24:39,770 --> 00:24:44,890
developing local extension capacity

579
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:47,809
project can assist us aid missions with

580
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:51,500
analyses further analysis like a deep

581
00:24:47,809 --> 00:24:53,210
dive into why the private sector is not

582
00:24:51,500 --> 00:24:55,520
working or how it can be strengthened we

583
00:24:53,210 --> 00:24:58,159
can help with project design review

584
00:24:55,520 --> 00:25:00,590
scopes of works or help with workshops

585
00:24:58,159 --> 00:25:03,440
for project design and implementation

586
00:25:00,590 --> 00:25:06,169
suggest consultants and even do

587
00:25:03,440 --> 00:25:08,809
evaluation of extension and advisory

588
00:25:06,169 --> 00:25:11,630
service activities so with that I'm

589
00:25:08,809 --> 00:25:13,039
gonna pause let Julie see if there's

590
00:25:11,630 --> 00:25:15,860
some key questions we want to answer

591
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:24,679
before turning over to Robert to present

592
00:25:15,860 --> 00:25:26,000
the case study on Uganda great thank you

593
00:25:24,679 --> 00:25:29,090
so much Kristin for that excellent

594
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:32,470
presentation we've had a few questions

595
00:25:29,090 --> 00:25:39,460
come in at all to you before we move on

596
00:25:32,470 --> 00:25:41,809
let's see do t-pain former USAID member

597
00:25:39,460 --> 00:25:43,640
asked do you have any sense of the

598
00:25:41,809 --> 00:25:46,669
number of farmers reached by various

599
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,559
approaches in this study radio is of

600
00:25:46,669 --> 00:25:51,169
course common and effective do you have

601
00:25:48,559 --> 00:25:59,929
any numbers on other digital tools or

602
00:25:51,169 --> 00:26:03,200
services Thanks hi hi Judy I knew we'd

603
00:25:59,929 --> 00:26:05,419
hear from you on the digital side we

604
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:07,250
don't have specific we'd we didn't

605
00:26:05,419 --> 00:26:10,340
aggregate as to the number reached by

606
00:26:07,250 --> 00:26:12,919
different tools and approaches in all

607
00:26:10,340 --> 00:26:15,919
from the the review the portfolio review

608
00:26:12,919 --> 00:26:18,860
it was reported that 89 million farmers

609
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:20,330
were reached so it was a huge reach but

610
00:26:18,860 --> 00:26:23,059
I think it was through all the different

611
00:26:20,330 --> 00:26:25,309
methods and of course radio Reach is

612
00:26:23,059 --> 00:26:28,010
probably by far the most of them but we

613
00:26:25,309 --> 00:26:30,140
don't have specific information at the

614
00:26:28,010 --> 00:26:33,909
at this report level of how many were

615
00:26:30,140 --> 00:26:33,909
reached by the different digital tools

616
00:26:40,660 --> 00:26:47,740
great thank you and a question from

617
00:26:43,930 --> 00:26:50,260
Gordon OTN Oh ones are how do you assess

618
00:26:47,740 --> 00:26:52,300
the strength weakness of an extension

619
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:54,280
and advisory service public or private

620
00:26:52,300 --> 00:26:59,890
is there a specific tool that you use

621
00:26:54,280 --> 00:27:02,290
for assessing then thanks Gordon

622
00:26:59,890 --> 00:27:04,690
we don't have a specific tool I think

623
00:27:02,290 --> 00:27:07,600
there's people working on these types of

624
00:27:04,690 --> 00:27:10,060
issues we can sort of use the elements

625
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:12,550
that I've outlined here in in the

626
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:15,550
presentation and the report and if you

627
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:18,100
go to download the huge report the big

628
00:27:15,550 --> 00:27:20,890
full report we have sort of a decision

629
00:27:18,100 --> 00:27:22,660
tree at the end which can help you see

630
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:26,500
which direction you should go in in

631
00:27:22,660 --> 00:27:28,300
order to intervene but I can I can talk

632
00:27:26,500 --> 00:27:31,360
to you maybe I can use the chat box

633
00:27:28,300 --> 00:27:34,050
after and talk about some other

634
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:36,100
initiatives that are going on to assess

635
00:27:34,050 --> 00:27:44,440
extension in general not just private

636
00:27:36,100 --> 00:27:47,230
sector great thank you I think we'll

637
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,230
throw in one or two more short questions

638
00:27:47,230 --> 00:27:52,330
and then if you also wouldn't mind

639
00:27:50,230 --> 00:27:54,730
helping to answer some in the chat box

640
00:27:52,330 --> 00:27:59,920
once Robert gets underway

641
00:27:54,730 --> 00:28:02,680
let's see Liz so go to asked do you have

642
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:04,150
any scenario time scales for how long it

643
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:07,150
would take to implement some of these

644
00:28:04,150 --> 00:28:11,640
best fit recommendations assuming some

645
00:28:07,150 --> 00:28:11,640
regionality or shared environment etc

646
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:18,880
scenario timelines everything takes

647
00:28:16,090 --> 00:28:22,060
longer than you expect

648
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,920
for instance I I'm based in South Africa

649
00:28:22,060 --> 00:28:25,960
and I have been assisting or I had

650
00:28:23,920 --> 00:28:28,300
assisted with the development of a

651
00:28:25,960 --> 00:28:31,900
national extension policy and it took

652
00:28:28,300 --> 00:28:33,940
years I know you you know Uganda has

653
00:28:31,900 --> 00:28:36,640
been going through something similar and

654
00:28:33,940 --> 00:28:39,610
Malawi is in the in the process of sort

655
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:41,140
of revising their national policy it

656
00:28:39,610 --> 00:28:44,050
takes a long time and you have to be

657
00:28:41,140 --> 00:28:46,840
ready you know for sort of the long haul

658
00:28:44,050 --> 00:28:48,320
in some of these systems development

659
00:28:46,840 --> 00:28:51,680
areas in

660
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:54,230
terms of regionality yeah I'm assuming

661
00:28:51,680 --> 00:28:58,460
you're talking about learning across the

662
00:28:54,230 --> 00:29:02,980
region but yeah I think we always need

663
00:28:58,460 --> 00:29:02,980
to plan for longer longer than we expect

664
00:29:16,290 --> 00:29:23,750
[Music]

665
00:29:19,330 --> 00:29:27,020
you have any any plans perhaps for a

666
00:29:23,750 --> 00:29:30,320
question from Erna Abidine are there any

667
00:29:27,020 --> 00:29:34,490
plans for how to link this USAID funded

668
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:37,070
program to any nonprofit NGOs outside of

669
00:29:34,490 --> 00:29:40,550
US aid or or to other entities outside

670
00:29:37,070 --> 00:29:43,070
of US aid or outside of it free yeah

671
00:29:40,550 --> 00:29:45,890
thanks yeah so so the developing local

672
00:29:43,070 --> 00:29:48,080
extension capacity is a is a Feed the

673
00:29:45,890 --> 00:29:50,450
Future project that's focused on Feed

674
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:52,850
the Future countries those are listed

675
00:29:50,450 --> 00:29:54,380
I'll share the link or somebody can

676
00:29:52,850 --> 00:29:55,280
share the link in the chat box in a

677
00:29:54,380 --> 00:29:58,820
moment what the Feed the Future

678
00:29:55,280 --> 00:30:02,480
countries are but we do work with other

679
00:29:58,820 --> 00:30:05,780
partners depending on what the needs are

680
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:08,800
in that country so for instance in

681
00:30:05,780 --> 00:30:11,390
Nigeria we worked with a private sector

682
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:14,510
company that wasn't you know part of

683
00:30:11,390 --> 00:30:16,310
Feed the Future necessarily and in other

684
00:30:14,510 --> 00:30:19,460
countries we've been working with with

685
00:30:16,310 --> 00:30:21,410
NGOs in Bangladesh for instance so it's

686
00:30:19,460 --> 00:30:25,550
not you know we can link up with other

687
00:30:21,410 --> 00:30:28,280
with other nonprofit entities depending

688
00:30:25,550 --> 00:30:31,070
on you know the joint interests the the

689
00:30:28,280 --> 00:30:33,640
shared objectives in the country where

690
00:30:31,070 --> 00:30:33,640
we're working

691
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,269
great Thank You Christian in the

692
00:30:41,799 --> 00:30:45,009
interest of time I think we can move

693
00:30:43,269 --> 00:30:47,590
along but we will continue to address

694
00:30:45,009 --> 00:30:50,409
questions in the chat box and at the end

695
00:30:47,590 --> 00:30:54,909
of the presentation so next we'll move

696
00:30:50,409 --> 00:31:02,970
along to Robert and yang for his portion

697
00:30:54,909 --> 00:31:05,139
of the presentation Thank You Julia

698
00:31:02,970 --> 00:31:05,980
Thank You Julie and thanks a lot

699
00:31:05,139 --> 00:31:09,669
Christian for that wonderful

700
00:31:05,980 --> 00:31:11,320
presentation I am also very super

701
00:31:09,669 --> 00:31:13,210
excited to talk about extension after

702
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:15,759
spending 90 years trying to find ways to

703
00:31:13,210 --> 00:31:18,909
make it cheaper and affordable to most

704
00:31:15,759 --> 00:31:20,950
care FAMAS the late norman borlaug used

705
00:31:18,909 --> 00:31:22,450
to tell us I actually work for Sasakawa

706
00:31:20,950 --> 00:31:24,580
epic Association before I joined

707
00:31:22,450 --> 00:31:26,889
harmonics if you say take technology

708
00:31:24,580 --> 00:31:29,799
closer to the farmers in terms of

709
00:31:26,889 --> 00:31:32,169
innovations and information and instead

710
00:31:29,799 --> 00:31:35,139
employers find means of doing that so

711
00:31:32,169 --> 00:31:36,909
that can be sustainable over the years

712
00:31:35,139 --> 00:31:42,129
we try so many models with my man

713
00:31:36,909 --> 00:31:43,929
league's approach the these quality

714
00:31:42,129 --> 00:31:46,629
community-based by setting by another

715
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:49,659
day as soon as we stop funding it it all

716
00:31:46,629 --> 00:31:51,940
stops so we start taking how do we do it

717
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:54,610
better and that's what I want to share

718
00:31:51,940 --> 00:31:56,620
with you today we all know in extension

719
00:31:54,610 --> 00:31:59,139
the biggest cost is not wages or salary

720
00:31:56,620 --> 00:32:02,679
the biggest cost is logistics and

721
00:31:59,139 --> 00:32:06,850
training actually logistic takes 58% of

722
00:32:02,679 --> 00:32:12,000
all extension delivery both public and

723
00:32:06,850 --> 00:32:15,070
private sector extension systems now

724
00:32:12,000 --> 00:32:17,169
let's talk about the public a second

725
00:32:15,070 --> 00:32:18,549
delivery system in Uganda I'm sure it's

726
00:32:17,169 --> 00:32:21,610
not different from any other countries

727
00:32:18,549 --> 00:32:25,539
we we do have a ratio of extension

728
00:32:21,610 --> 00:32:27,429
worker to Pharma at one one one

729
00:32:25,539 --> 00:32:30,789
essential worker to want other iterate

730
00:32:27,429 --> 00:32:33,370
farmers may be unconscious like utopia I

731
00:32:30,789 --> 00:32:34,960
can't find one to 500 meaning we are not

732
00:32:33,370 --> 00:32:39,610
reaching out to farmers in a proper way

733
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:41,860
and if we take a look at the advert the

734
00:32:39,610 --> 00:32:43,360
private sector you know the private

735
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:45,759
sector has about four models they

736
00:32:43,360 --> 00:32:47,679
promote the family led model which is

737
00:32:45,759 --> 00:32:49,809
mostly to improve formal situation and

738
00:32:47,679 --> 00:32:53,080
offer them better opportunities which I

739
00:32:49,809 --> 00:32:55,059
did for 14 years and to empower farmer

740
00:32:53,080 --> 00:32:58,029
and we the donors keep on finding aids

741
00:32:55,059 --> 00:33:01,659
as soon as we pull out it it goes back

742
00:32:58,029 --> 00:33:03,759
to the same way we met it the global

743
00:33:01,659 --> 00:33:06,879
sourcing module is a welder modules

744
00:33:03,759 --> 00:33:09,610
across in big commodities mostly to

745
00:33:06,879 --> 00:33:12,519
secure life supplies and have like

746
00:33:09,610 --> 00:33:16,509
impact on on farmers but it also have

747
00:33:12,519 --> 00:33:18,129
their drawbacks mostly you find there's

748
00:33:16,509 --> 00:33:21,429
a high rates of side selling by the same

749
00:33:18,129 --> 00:33:23,739
producers and it sometimes offer the

750
00:33:21,429 --> 00:33:26,139
systems of commercial service to these

751
00:33:23,739 --> 00:33:28,749
farmers then you have the local traders

752
00:33:26,139 --> 00:33:31,539
models they are very efficient in

753
00:33:28,749 --> 00:33:33,759
sourcing they reach the farmer home they

754
00:33:31,539 --> 00:33:37,029
these guys you find on bicycle go to

755
00:33:33,759 --> 00:33:39,039
Amazon to pick up one bag of maize but

756
00:33:37,029 --> 00:33:41,830
did there's always issue of mistrust

757
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:43,690
among each of them and and definitely

758
00:33:41,830 --> 00:33:46,059
always causing problems between farmers

759
00:33:43,690 --> 00:33:48,249
and traders then we'll have the

760
00:33:46,059 --> 00:33:49,779
specialized models like Christy

761
00:33:48,249 --> 00:33:52,450
mentioned about consultants

762
00:33:49,779 --> 00:33:54,429
yeah just are the ones trying to improve

763
00:33:52,450 --> 00:33:57,820
and innovate I gotta buy the chains use

764
00:33:54,429 --> 00:34:00,580
of ICT user means over here for mass but

765
00:33:57,820 --> 00:34:02,950
make it for profits but is also his own

766
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:06,249
drawbacks is have high initial cost of

767
00:34:02,950 --> 00:34:07,690
investment so we keep on thinking how do

768
00:34:06,249 --> 00:34:11,169
we do it in an effective and affordable

769
00:34:07,690 --> 00:34:13,000
way I was the chief of party of a

770
00:34:11,169 --> 00:34:15,369
project called the commodity production

771
00:34:13,000 --> 00:34:18,399
market activity Uganda that ended in

772
00:34:15,369 --> 00:34:21,639
March 2018 and then we decided to

773
00:34:18,399 --> 00:34:24,579
combine all of these models together

774
00:34:21,639 --> 00:34:26,770
they form a late models the specialized

775
00:34:24,579 --> 00:34:29,710
models the local traders and the global

776
00:34:26,770 --> 00:34:32,139
sourcing and we find a commonality among

777
00:34:29,710 --> 00:34:34,119
all this we try to find out we the last

778
00:34:32,139 --> 00:34:36,159
person the rich other farmer in all

779
00:34:34,119 --> 00:34:39,040
these models they all have alcohol and

780
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:42,399
agents and why do we decide to work with

781
00:34:39,040 --> 00:34:46,210
such people we believe the biggest

782
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:48,669
problem in supply chain is size selling

783
00:34:46,210 --> 00:34:52,450
and reaching out from us on terms of

784
00:34:48,669 --> 00:34:54,280
quality and quantity so but but working

785
00:34:52,450 --> 00:34:56,740
with the same guys that does in most

786
00:34:54,280 --> 00:34:59,349
Harbach which are the traders may be we

787
00:34:56,740 --> 00:35:02,799
able to improve the system by a coaching

788
00:34:59,349 --> 00:35:04,630
and mentoring them so on that our

789
00:35:02,799 --> 00:35:06,080
program we can what we call the village

790
00:35:04,630 --> 00:35:09,800
agent model

791
00:35:06,080 --> 00:35:14,030
and this height works is a market-driven

792
00:35:09,800 --> 00:35:17,210
approach we first engaged a market pool

793
00:35:14,030 --> 00:35:19,040
the market pool means the end buyer the

794
00:35:17,210 --> 00:35:21,950
person that signals what he wants in

795
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:25,040
terms of quantity and quality is at an

796
00:35:21,950 --> 00:35:27,230
exporter or or an buyer or likes

797
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:29,720
processing companies then he and the

798
00:35:27,230 --> 00:35:32,870
five traders traders can be cooperatives

799
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:34,880
or modernizations hoppers organizations

800
00:35:32,870 --> 00:35:37,250
or miss Morley traders individual

801
00:35:34,880 --> 00:35:39,920
traders and these same contracts and say

802
00:35:37,250 --> 00:35:41,870
okay this is what we want to do this is

803
00:35:39,920 --> 00:35:44,290
the amount of maize or coffee or beans I

804
00:35:41,870 --> 00:35:46,430
like to buy so can you please make up

805
00:35:44,290 --> 00:35:48,650
how you gonna do the production contract

806
00:35:46,430 --> 00:35:51,280
if you have signed a contract with the

807
00:35:48,650 --> 00:35:53,810
exporter and each other and advice

808
00:35:51,280 --> 00:35:56,180
relate agent who a lawyer to him

809
00:35:53,810 --> 00:35:57,980
remember the village agent is the one

810
00:35:56,180 --> 00:36:01,010
that lives in the village with it with

811
00:35:57,980 --> 00:36:04,340
your farmer easy one to push to call the

812
00:36:01,010 --> 00:36:06,680
shack the coyote the long shot that give

813
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:08,120
loans to farmers and high rates but he

814
00:36:06,680 --> 00:36:10,370
knows every farmer in the village

815
00:36:08,120 --> 00:36:12,440
because he stays in there and he is a

816
00:36:10,370 --> 00:36:14,810
point of entry because he moves from

817
00:36:12,440 --> 00:36:17,210
home to home to pick a bag of maize or

818
00:36:14,810 --> 00:36:20,330
two bags of maize so if you train those

819
00:36:17,210 --> 00:36:22,580
ones to provide extension in terms of

820
00:36:20,330 --> 00:36:24,770
production and marketing services maybe

821
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:26,930
we're able to be able to improve the

822
00:36:24,770 --> 00:36:30,080
life of the farmer because remember I

823
00:36:26,930 --> 00:36:30,950
said the biggest cost in extension is

824
00:36:30,080 --> 00:36:34,100
logistics

825
00:36:30,950 --> 00:36:36,230
this agent go from home to home to pick

826
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,690
back up maze without being paid but I

827
00:36:36,230 --> 00:36:40,580
get it Commission for do units so they

828
00:36:38,690 --> 00:36:42,710
are being motivated by based on the

829
00:36:40,580 --> 00:36:44,150
volume they collect and which they get

830
00:36:42,710 --> 00:36:49,880
paid by their traders in terms of

831
00:36:44,150 --> 00:36:52,220
Commission so what we do as CPM we call

832
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:53,870
it the comma to push on magnet IVA T we

833
00:36:52,220 --> 00:36:55,880
mentor and coach them in different

834
00:36:53,870 --> 00:36:57,650
services on the up pre-production

835
00:36:55,880 --> 00:37:00,110
production and post office emergency

836
00:36:57,650 --> 00:37:01,880
services and part of them we would train

837
00:37:00,110 --> 00:37:04,430
them to be crop insurance agents because

838
00:37:01,880 --> 00:37:06,140
it was demand for crop insurance we

839
00:37:04,430 --> 00:37:08,090
train them to be Impuls of supply

840
00:37:06,140 --> 00:37:11,120
services because they can actually

841
00:37:08,090 --> 00:37:14,060
forecast demand between the needs Alfama

842
00:37:11,120 --> 00:37:15,860
and seed companies they provide planted

843
00:37:14,060 --> 00:37:18,350
services they were training winning

844
00:37:15,860 --> 00:37:19,730
services we are traded in fortune

845
00:37:18,350 --> 00:37:21,380
services but I

846
00:37:19,730 --> 00:37:23,060
agent takes only four to five of these

847
00:37:21,380 --> 00:37:27,020
services to get yourself a Popeye the

848
00:37:23,060 --> 00:37:30,079
wall yeah let me tell you what makes it

849
00:37:27,020 --> 00:37:32,930
interesting for them to do it the agent

850
00:37:30,079 --> 00:37:35,230
makes an average of four thousand

851
00:37:32,930 --> 00:37:39,380
dollars in profits from doing this

852
00:37:35,230 --> 00:37:40,460
twenty services and that's a motivation

853
00:37:39,380 --> 00:37:42,650
that drives them to reach out to the

854
00:37:40,460 --> 00:37:45,050
farmers knowing fully well the more

855
00:37:42,650 --> 00:37:46,849
farmers will improve their production

856
00:37:45,050 --> 00:37:50,270
the more Commission I get from my trader

857
00:37:46,849 --> 00:37:53,390
and how did it deliver services to

858
00:37:50,270 --> 00:37:55,369
farmers because they are used to Vince

859
00:37:53,390 --> 00:37:56,540
from us at the home so individual

860
00:37:55,369 --> 00:37:59,060
farmers it was easy for them to

861
00:37:56,540 --> 00:38:00,829
understand to do but we incorporate

862
00:37:59,060 --> 00:38:03,560
things like ammunition videos on their

863
00:38:00,829 --> 00:38:05,810
tablets I think Christian has been

864
00:38:03,560 --> 00:38:08,570
talked about edited means of linking

865
00:38:05,810 --> 00:38:11,119
from us we develop animation videos to

866
00:38:08,570 --> 00:38:13,310
help them pass the message in a very

867
00:38:11,119 --> 00:38:14,990
eloquent way to promise because you know

868
00:38:13,310 --> 00:38:17,150
most of us who are not well trained

869
00:38:14,990 --> 00:38:18,890
extension workers so we have to make

870
00:38:17,150 --> 00:38:22,070
sure the messages is clear and able to

871
00:38:18,890 --> 00:38:24,260
divide they also promote do a second

872
00:38:22,070 --> 00:38:26,329
delivery by doing one called demand

873
00:38:24,260 --> 00:38:28,190
created demonstrations these are the

874
00:38:26,329 --> 00:38:30,200
typical demonstrations they have signed

875
00:38:28,190 --> 00:38:32,510
contract with input companies but this

876
00:38:30,200 --> 00:38:34,730
is to create demand so they can make

877
00:38:32,510 --> 00:38:36,380
money from it and they often provide

878
00:38:34,730 --> 00:38:38,540
direct service to farmers by going there

879
00:38:36,380 --> 00:38:41,510
to spray take care of the coffee and

880
00:38:38,540 --> 00:38:44,780
wait for them amazing other methods we

881
00:38:41,510 --> 00:38:47,420
use was user I see I see because

882
00:38:44,780 --> 00:38:49,099
definitely they are very versatile in in

883
00:38:47,420 --> 00:38:51,109
communicating in their local languages

884
00:38:49,099 --> 00:38:53,329
so we translate that with the mission of

885
00:38:51,109 --> 00:38:55,099
Agriculture all the essential materials

886
00:38:53,329 --> 00:38:57,430
into local languages for them to achieve

887
00:38:55,099 --> 00:39:00,200
delivered from us and it's often to use

888
00:38:57,430 --> 00:39:02,329
the nice group training I'm home visit

889
00:39:00,200 --> 00:39:05,089
among all these associate degree methods

890
00:39:02,329 --> 00:39:07,400
they use the individual visits and all

891
00:39:05,089 --> 00:39:09,050
visits was the most common among which

892
00:39:07,400 --> 00:39:10,930
was effective to reach out the numbers

893
00:39:09,050 --> 00:39:13,430
of Hamas

894
00:39:10,930 --> 00:39:18,109
how did they make money and sustain a

895
00:39:13,430 --> 00:39:20,119
model and a bag of on one bad or

896
00:39:18,109 --> 00:39:23,000
fatality cell and agent make within five

897
00:39:20,119 --> 00:39:24,440
to six dollar profits so meaning if I

898
00:39:23,000 --> 00:39:27,020
have to read from a problem for me I

899
00:39:24,440 --> 00:39:32,790
said 20 bucks or fertilizers that means

900
00:39:27,020 --> 00:39:34,860
I can be able to get 100 dollars

901
00:39:32,790 --> 00:39:36,990
and how I will surely get his money

902
00:39:34,860 --> 00:39:38,910
remember every seed company or

903
00:39:36,990 --> 00:39:41,310
fertilizer company needs to reach out to

904
00:39:38,910 --> 00:39:45,090
the plumber the cost of the reaching out

905
00:39:41,310 --> 00:39:47,520
to the farmer is almost around 35% so

906
00:39:45,090 --> 00:39:49,710
this money is now half of it is not

907
00:39:47,520 --> 00:39:51,270
given to the agent because Dave we find

908
00:39:49,710 --> 00:39:53,790
out where the farm as a and they would

909
00:39:51,270 --> 00:39:56,490
deliver it but Reza to the farmer at his

910
00:39:53,790 --> 00:40:00,690
doorstep and also provide were called

911
00:39:56,490 --> 00:40:02,610
and better services and this was worked

912
00:40:00,690 --> 00:40:04,530
well and in terms of soy testing they

913
00:40:02,610 --> 00:40:07,050
provide such tests in the mill at five

914
00:40:04,530 --> 00:40:09,420
dollars what would this site testing

915
00:40:07,050 --> 00:40:11,340
companies they had like my fear is when

916
00:40:09,420 --> 00:40:13,500
they spray the megabyte 0.5 dollars in

917
00:40:11,340 --> 00:40:20,580
every liter they make money along the

918
00:40:13,500 --> 00:40:23,370
chain every service they provide overall

919
00:40:20,580 --> 00:40:26,160
I was like to measure impact and say

920
00:40:23,370 --> 00:40:29,060
okay as it's making any changes in the

921
00:40:26,160 --> 00:40:31,740
period of five years from 2013 to 2018

922
00:40:29,060 --> 00:40:34,140
we found a lot of changes are out goes

923
00:40:31,740 --> 00:40:37,740
truth just quick to the slide that was

924
00:40:34,140 --> 00:40:41,190
about their districts tension our target

925
00:40:37,740 --> 00:40:43,380
was to reach our two numbers of Hamas

926
00:40:41,190 --> 00:40:46,920
who have applied new technologies our

927
00:40:43,380 --> 00:40:49,710
baseline was 52,000 but but because the

928
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:51,780
extension ID built agent model work

929
00:40:49,710 --> 00:40:54,090
effectively we're able to reach by for a

930
00:40:51,780 --> 00:40:56,130
ninety six thousand the a great numbers

931
00:40:54,090 --> 00:40:59,370
of family agent was around to hundreds

932
00:40:56,130 --> 00:41:03,030
of per agent meaning closer and easy

933
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:05,130
tool to manage the investment by the

934
00:41:03,030 --> 00:41:08,610
private sector because they found that

935
00:41:05,130 --> 00:41:11,160
they could get more supplies and more a

936
00:41:08,610 --> 00:41:14,490
better quality they invested in things

937
00:41:11,160 --> 00:41:17,520
like prison facilities they invested in

938
00:41:14,490 --> 00:41:19,950
things like a provide loans to trade us

939
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:22,500
to buy more and you know the see the

940
00:41:19,950 --> 00:41:24,720
inputs delivery oh by a pillar of five

941
00:41:22,500 --> 00:41:26,160
years this agent was able to sell 5

942
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,180
million dollars worth of inputs that

943
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:31,170
reach out to farmer

944
00:41:27,180 --> 00:41:32,870
and we did a survey trying to find out

945
00:41:31,170 --> 00:41:36,300
how many this farmers actually an

946
00:41:32,870 --> 00:41:37,770
apposite benefits of using inputs we

947
00:41:36,300 --> 00:41:41,340
found our seventy percent of these

948
00:41:37,770 --> 00:41:44,840
people appreciate them village agent

949
00:41:41,340 --> 00:41:44,840
driven service to them in a better way

950
00:41:45,510 --> 00:41:51,520
now in every model there's things that

951
00:41:49,840 --> 00:41:53,950
can make it's filled and I've talked

952
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:56,050
about this more during our inception

953
00:41:53,950 --> 00:41:57,850
period we found out most people tend to

954
00:41:56,050 --> 00:42:00,310
see the traders at the battery put to

955
00:41:57,850 --> 00:42:02,140
work weights and most donors and angels

956
00:42:00,310 --> 00:42:04,120
don't want to associate with them but if

957
00:42:02,140 --> 00:42:07,320
you look at the value chain it trader

958
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:10,420
has been there all these days and

959
00:42:07,320 --> 00:42:11,590
meaning we can work with the traders to

960
00:42:10,420 --> 00:42:15,070
reach out to farmers because yet it

961
00:42:11,590 --> 00:42:16,420
closes in that model to a farmer if it

962
00:42:15,070 --> 00:42:18,580
do not refuse to work with the middle

963
00:42:16,420 --> 00:42:21,160
actors the VA would not work because

964
00:42:18,580 --> 00:42:24,430
every farmer sees the donors and NGOs as

965
00:42:21,160 --> 00:42:26,370
the next ATM machine meaning they look

966
00:42:24,430 --> 00:42:29,920
for free services they are looking for

967
00:42:26,370 --> 00:42:31,990
dependence on a subsidized ation if

968
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,620
there's no access to finance it will not

969
00:42:31,990 --> 00:42:36,580
work and if there's no lack of

970
00:42:34,620 --> 00:42:39,130
instrument to import production in

971
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:41,020
practice and behaviors among Aptos the

972
00:42:39,130 --> 00:42:45,610
model would not walk so all this was

973
00:42:41,020 --> 00:42:47,920
considered we are trying to do this what

974
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:50,050
have you learned there must be a link

975
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:52,510
here buyer you can owe increase

976
00:42:50,050 --> 00:42:55,330
production without selling it out will

977
00:42:52,510 --> 00:42:57,910
it adjust it to be trained about it's a

978
00:42:55,330 --> 00:43:00,430
visa offer the job decrypt must be

979
00:42:57,910 --> 00:43:02,470
passive as formal well must be willing

980
00:43:00,430 --> 00:43:05,890
to pay for service in cash or in kind at

981
00:43:02,470 --> 00:43:08,590
the same time of delivery ICT is key to

982
00:43:05,890 --> 00:43:11,200
reduce costs of transaction and there

983
00:43:08,590 --> 00:43:11,980
must be a behavior change strategy for

984
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:16,600
all Aptos

985
00:43:11,980 --> 00:43:17,980
work together over the years the

986
00:43:16,600 --> 00:43:21,010
government of Uganda adopted the model

987
00:43:17,980 --> 00:43:22,210
and then it was under idea called

988
00:43:21,010 --> 00:43:25,000
international approach to extension

989
00:43:22,210 --> 00:43:26,440
policy where you have all essential

990
00:43:25,000 --> 00:43:29,440
services both public and private sector

991
00:43:26,440 --> 00:43:31,930
come to work together and the government

992
00:43:29,440 --> 00:43:34,660
fraternity right now they are providing

993
00:43:31,930 --> 00:43:36,430
support to certify these agents they

994
00:43:34,660 --> 00:43:38,710
provide allies for their staff to reach

995
00:43:36,430 --> 00:43:40,060
out to this agent and also provide the

996
00:43:38,710 --> 00:43:44,050
essential material for this agent to

997
00:43:40,060 --> 00:43:45,970
walk on the private sector this support

998
00:43:44,050 --> 00:43:47,230
is the assertion of workers which

999
00:43:45,970 --> 00:43:50,140
depends to enumerate them to organize

1000
00:43:47,230 --> 00:43:52,240
training I also supported us vh2

1001
00:43:50,140 --> 00:43:54,520
decimated knowledge and conduct

1002
00:43:52,240 --> 00:43:56,560
demonstrations and it is a perfect way

1003
00:43:54,520 --> 00:43:58,000
where you find - straighten both public

1004
00:43:56,560 --> 00:43:59,080
and private sector

1005
00:43:58,000 --> 00:44:01,900
we know the purpose of Mendoza have

1006
00:43:59,080 --> 00:44:03,970
sufficient money of funds to reach out

1007
00:44:01,900 --> 00:44:05,140
to farmers but the private sector is

1008
00:44:03,970 --> 00:44:06,790
with feisty-pants

1009
00:44:05,140 --> 00:44:09,070
to support a double session water had to

1010
00:44:06,790 --> 00:44:15,430
trim agents who in turn chain the

1011
00:44:09,070 --> 00:44:17,380
farmers and it's easy to manage so what

1012
00:44:15,430 --> 00:44:20,620
is unique about the agent village agent

1013
00:44:17,380 --> 00:44:23,110
model is market driven service

1014
00:44:20,620 --> 00:44:24,600
appropriate to farmer because the agents

1015
00:44:23,110 --> 00:44:27,910
leaves the same trick with the farm

1016
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:29,350
inputs genuine inputs because the agent

1017
00:44:27,910 --> 00:44:31,510
is screwed up to the farm and there's no

1018
00:44:29,350 --> 00:44:33,460
way he don't sell fake fake inputs

1019
00:44:31,510 --> 00:44:35,890
compared to stockists wolves in town

1020
00:44:33,460 --> 00:44:38,170
there's real-time guidance they form a

1021
00:44:35,890 --> 00:44:40,360
character to refer to the to the agent

1022
00:44:38,170 --> 00:44:43,480
who would live next door to him is

1023
00:44:40,360 --> 00:44:45,610
self-sustaining because the agent mixed

1024
00:44:43,480 --> 00:44:52,690
money with it was working and it creates

1025
00:44:45,610 --> 00:44:53,700
employment I like to talk about the top

1026
00:44:52,690 --> 00:44:56,080
takeaways here

1027
00:44:53,700 --> 00:45:00,180
remember all key for actors should be

1028
00:44:56,080 --> 00:45:02,770
involved exporter traders agent and fama

1029
00:45:00,180 --> 00:45:05,230
technology is key as innovations to

1030
00:45:02,770 --> 00:45:07,380
deliver better services a man should be

1031
00:45:05,230 --> 00:45:10,630
willing to pay for service in Pinal -

1032
00:45:07,380 --> 00:45:13,600
the most beautiful incentives around

1033
00:45:10,630 --> 00:45:16,270
service delivery racial building is fee

1034
00:45:13,600 --> 00:45:18,010
based on trust and loyalty you need to

1035
00:45:16,270 --> 00:45:21,460
enhanced against knowledge in relevant

1036
00:45:18,010 --> 00:45:27,150
fields and answer to finance by all the

1037
00:45:21,460 --> 00:45:27,150
form a Aptos is team thank you very much

1038
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:33,130
wonderful thank you so much Robert will

1039
00:45:31,390 --> 00:45:34,780
pause here for a few questions for you

1040
00:45:33,130 --> 00:45:38,710
as we've had some great questions for

1041
00:45:34,780 --> 00:45:42,340
you come in the first one that I'll ask

1042
00:45:38,710 --> 00:45:44,500
you is from mark blackish who asks what

1043
00:45:42,340 --> 00:45:47,470
do you think of the strategy for the

1044
00:45:44,500 --> 00:45:49,750
Ministry of Ag in Uganda to lead on the

1045
00:45:47,470 --> 00:45:51,460
village agent model do you think this

1046
00:45:49,750 --> 00:45:53,680
should be a joint initiative with the

1047
00:45:51,460 --> 00:46:00,700
Ministry of Trade industry and

1048
00:45:53,680 --> 00:46:02,050
cooperative thank you Mark yes I believe

1049
00:46:00,700 --> 00:46:04,320
it should be joint effort between the

1050
00:46:02,050 --> 00:46:06,220
Ministry of choice you take the lead of

1051
00:46:04,320 --> 00:46:10,150
trying to promote the village against

1052
00:46:06,220 --> 00:46:11,980
model in this aspect because this false

1053
00:46:10,150 --> 00:46:13,900
trade falls under the mission of trade

1054
00:46:11,980 --> 00:46:15,970
and definitely walk into the district

1055
00:46:13,900 --> 00:46:18,220
commercial business but the myths about

1056
00:46:15,970 --> 00:46:20,470
culture can provide ETA to improve the

1057
00:46:18,220 --> 00:46:22,960
production petabytes remember this model

1058
00:46:20,470 --> 00:46:24,820
is both production and marketing the

1059
00:46:22,960 --> 00:46:26,440
brush size is where the missile culture

1060
00:46:24,820 --> 00:46:28,619
tried to make sure to improve the yields

1061
00:46:26,440 --> 00:46:31,510
by training the VHD provided right

1062
00:46:28,619 --> 00:46:33,490
services the McArdle part is where the

1063
00:46:31,510 --> 00:46:36,220
myth of trade takes object trading

1064
00:46:33,490 --> 00:46:38,619
compañero bit but overall it was with

1065
00:46:36,220 --> 00:46:40,810
joint initiative right now

1066
00:46:38,619 --> 00:46:42,359
we definitely had a joint initiative

1067
00:46:40,810 --> 00:46:45,130
between the Minister of Trade and

1068
00:46:42,359 --> 00:46:47,500
industries and the Michelin culture and

1069
00:46:45,130 --> 00:46:49,000
a miss of local governments these are

1070
00:46:47,500 --> 00:47:08,530
three key partners what take initiative

1071
00:46:49,000 --> 00:47:10,540
in this from Jonathan Hobson how do you

1072
00:47:08,530 --> 00:47:16,470
ensure that the village agent model

1073
00:47:10,540 --> 00:47:23,380
promotes improved cultural practices I

1074
00:47:16,470 --> 00:47:25,330
believe thanks Jonathan the assistant of

1075
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:29,560
a bridge agent is based on a two-way

1076
00:47:25,330 --> 00:47:32,590
walking with the with a farmer because

1077
00:47:29,560 --> 00:47:34,420
input is part of it but remember inputs

1078
00:47:32,590 --> 00:47:37,060
alone cannot really buddy the yield you

1079
00:47:34,420 --> 00:47:40,780
want so he was traded from us to adopt

1080
00:47:37,060 --> 00:47:42,820
better practices and in doing so he's

1081
00:47:40,780 --> 00:47:45,730
ensure that better yields is there so

1082
00:47:42,820 --> 00:47:48,520
the training they get from things like

1083
00:47:45,730 --> 00:47:50,680
donors like a like a car program and

1084
00:47:48,520 --> 00:47:52,030
also a miserable culture is true for

1085
00:47:50,680 --> 00:47:54,310
them to train to finance better to use

1086
00:47:52,030 --> 00:47:56,290
the inputs input is not already and

1087
00:47:54,310 --> 00:47:58,540
means we have a lot to do with in it

1088
00:47:56,290 --> 00:48:00,730
most of this agent are also involved in

1089
00:47:58,540 --> 00:48:03,700
output marketing while they do both ways

1090
00:48:00,730 --> 00:48:05,320
input and output marketing so they have

1091
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:07,300
to make sure that he used is sourced and

1092
00:48:05,320 --> 00:48:08,800
for them for the farmers to get more

1093
00:48:07,300 --> 00:48:11,500
yield so they can buy more from the

1094
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,420
farmers so definitely beyond inputs they

1095
00:48:11,500 --> 00:48:16,180
have to train from us on how to improve

1096
00:48:13,420 --> 00:48:18,910
but therefore our practices and the

1097
00:48:16,180 --> 00:48:20,290
return let me be honest with you they do

1098
00:48:18,910 --> 00:48:23,020
it because of the motivation of getting

1099
00:48:20,290 --> 00:48:25,590
more more yields from the farmers by

1100
00:48:23,020 --> 00:48:25,590
training these people

1101
00:48:28,680 --> 00:48:34,869
thanks so much over another couple of

1102
00:48:32,799 --> 00:48:39,190
questions I'll combine a couple from

1103
00:48:34,869 --> 00:48:41,470
Gordon ones re and from Henry Perry what

1104
00:48:39,190 --> 00:48:44,079
are some of the risks associated with

1105
00:48:41,470 --> 00:48:46,359
the village agents for example monopoly

1106
00:48:44,079 --> 00:48:49,119
in the village biased towards some

1107
00:48:46,359 --> 00:48:51,059
farming families trust or mistrust and

1108
00:48:49,119 --> 00:48:53,910
how did the project handle these risk

1109
00:48:51,059 --> 00:48:56,980
and kind of in a similar vein what is

1110
00:48:53,910 --> 00:49:01,869
one way to eliminate people's mistrust

1111
00:48:56,980 --> 00:49:02,230
of agents in this model thank you very

1112
00:49:01,869 --> 00:49:04,119
much

1113
00:49:02,230 --> 00:49:06,339
as I said one of the kitchens need to do

1114
00:49:04,119 --> 00:49:09,099
is you have to have a behavior change

1115
00:49:06,339 --> 00:49:10,630
strategy in place but the mistress has

1116
00:49:09,099 --> 00:49:11,349
been a long way you cannot change

1117
00:49:10,630 --> 00:49:14,380
overnight

1118
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:16,480
so during the program we try to create

1119
00:49:14,380 --> 00:49:18,160
internship between traders and farmers

1120
00:49:16,480 --> 00:49:20,170
bring them together to understand what

1121
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:22,540
are the key problems affecting the

1122
00:49:20,170 --> 00:49:25,740
relationships we spend over two years

1123
00:49:22,540 --> 00:49:28,630
doing that after five years and when the

1124
00:49:25,740 --> 00:49:31,030
pharmacy that he needs the agents more

1125
00:49:28,630 --> 00:49:33,369
and the agency DePalma then he had

1126
00:49:31,030 --> 00:49:35,170
people call a lawyer and Trust and we

1127
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:37,210
develop some materials that have system

1128
00:49:35,170 --> 00:49:39,460
to able to understand the biggest

1129
00:49:37,210 --> 00:49:42,720
problem in mistrust between an agent and

1130
00:49:39,460 --> 00:49:45,910
a farmer is Chile as it's cheating

1131
00:49:42,720 --> 00:49:47,950
most from us will say triggers cheats

1132
00:49:45,910 --> 00:49:50,470
off by tampering with his skills and

1133
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:52,540
moisture doesn't say from us cheetahs by

1134
00:49:50,470 --> 00:49:54,960
adding stones in a bag so we decided to

1135
00:49:52,540 --> 00:49:57,339
tap out the skills but when you build a

1136
00:49:54,960 --> 00:49:59,049
very good bigger chain strategy teaching

1137
00:49:57,339 --> 00:50:01,000
everybody the reason why you are trying

1138
00:49:59,049 --> 00:50:03,760
to cheat each other is because your

1139
00:50:01,000 --> 00:50:05,710
production is not efficient and if we

1140
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,630
here here is going to train you how to

1141
00:50:05,710 --> 00:50:09,819
produce better in so are we getting

1142
00:50:07,630 --> 00:50:12,220
eight bags of maize and an acre you can

1143
00:50:09,819 --> 00:50:13,480
definitely get twenty bucks an acre so

1144
00:50:12,220 --> 00:50:15,880
why do you decide to cheat by adding

1145
00:50:13,480 --> 00:50:16,809
those two each and this in turn returns

1146
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:18,640
back to the agent

1147
00:50:16,809 --> 00:50:22,119
it doesn't to tamp out the with the

1148
00:50:18,640 --> 00:50:27,099
woody scale anymore now how do you

1149
00:50:22,119 --> 00:50:28,990
reduce monopoly now I'm tell you from us

1150
00:50:27,099 --> 00:50:30,970
knows what to do there's no issue

1151
00:50:28,990 --> 00:50:33,339
monopoly a farmer live in a village with

1152
00:50:30,970 --> 00:50:34,930
different shoes would walk with the

1153
00:50:33,339 --> 00:50:36,670
there are no good agents and in no bad

1154
00:50:34,930 --> 00:50:38,470
agents they know where as we assisted

1155
00:50:36,670 --> 00:50:39,400
them in kind of their need so is the

1156
00:50:38,470 --> 00:50:42,250
choices made up to the

1157
00:50:39,400 --> 00:50:44,920
mama and the family decide who to work

1158
00:50:42,250 --> 00:50:46,779
with in a village you may find about

1159
00:50:44,920 --> 00:50:49,299
four agents working for different

1160
00:50:46,779 --> 00:50:52,180
traders or you may find one age for

1161
00:50:49,299 --> 00:50:54,190
traders at one village agent working for

1162
00:50:52,180 --> 00:50:56,440
one trader but the pharma is wise enough

1163
00:50:54,190 --> 00:51:07,480
to decide we want to walk with Miss on a

1164
00:50:56,440 --> 00:51:09,940
JPL's build a long time ago great thank

1165
00:51:07,480 --> 00:51:11,589
you so much Robert let me toss out one

1166
00:51:09,940 --> 00:51:22,210
or two more questions to you before we

1167
00:51:11,589 --> 00:51:28,480
move on who sustains the cost of the

1168
00:51:22,210 --> 00:51:31,900
ICTs and data storage in your model the

1169
00:51:28,480 --> 00:51:35,349
pharmacist changes with the trailer the

1170
00:51:31,900 --> 00:51:40,180
data collected currently right now from

1171
00:51:35,349 --> 00:51:42,760
as a pain about $2 $2 to get a land to

1172
00:51:40,180 --> 00:51:44,950
get the Lance profile the land size the

1173
00:51:42,760 --> 00:51:48,160
data collect from them it was about $2

1174
00:51:44,950 --> 00:51:52,000
and I believe $2 is like a five kilos of

1175
00:51:48,160 --> 00:51:54,250
maize all right what now often traders

1176
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,109
pay for this on behalf of the farmer and

1177
00:51:54,250 --> 00:52:00,400
adopted from the amazement at delivering

1178
00:51:56,109 --> 00:52:03,309
it so and that data is kept by a company

1179
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:06,549
called Orion and other ones in settle

1180
00:52:03,309 --> 00:52:08,920
and this is high source in itself but in

1181
00:52:06,549 --> 00:52:10,809
Uganda the actual cost for pulling that

1182
00:52:08,920 --> 00:52:12,700
data is only two dollars which is

1183
00:52:10,809 --> 00:52:14,410
sometimes five kilos of maize or two

1184
00:52:12,700 --> 00:52:16,960
pillars of beans and it should happen

1185
00:52:14,410 --> 00:52:18,549
wide and PMPA with the pharma and adopt

1186
00:52:16,960 --> 00:52:26,380
is when if I'm eyes delivering it goes

1187
00:52:18,549 --> 00:52:28,329
to him great thank you Robert in the

1188
00:52:26,380 --> 00:52:30,819
interest of time I think we'll move on

1189
00:52:28,329 --> 00:52:33,640
to our next case study and next

1190
00:52:30,819 --> 00:52:35,049
presenters but Robert please do take a

1191
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:36,819
look at the additional questions that

1192
00:52:35,049 --> 00:52:38,799
have come in for you in case you can

1193
00:52:36,819 --> 00:52:40,779
answer some of the chatbox and of course

1194
00:52:38,799 --> 00:52:43,180
we can also answer some more at the end

1195
00:52:40,779 --> 00:52:44,950
of the presentation so I'd like to pass

1196
00:52:43,180 --> 00:52:47,619
the microphone over to Jean Michelle

1197
00:52:44,950 --> 00:52:51,789
buzzard who has another case study for

1198
00:52:47,619 --> 00:52:52,840
us so Michelle okay hello Julie thank

1199
00:52:51,789 --> 00:52:58,450
you

1200
00:52:52,840 --> 00:53:01,230
can you hear me yes you sound clear okay

1201
00:52:58,450 --> 00:53:02,410
great well hello everyone from Senegal

1202
00:53:01,230 --> 00:53:06,340
okay

1203
00:53:02,410 --> 00:53:08,620
so this is about the Senegal net found

1204
00:53:06,340 --> 00:53:10,720
by project which actually was closed out

1205
00:53:08,620 --> 00:53:13,210
last June

1206
00:53:10,720 --> 00:53:16,150
Senegal natal bag was a feed the future

1207
00:53:13,210 --> 00:53:18,730
value chain activity that targeted the

1208
00:53:16,150 --> 00:53:23,140
Nogales three main cereals rice maize

1209
00:53:18,730 --> 00:53:25,720
and millet it came after a predecessor

1210
00:53:23,140 --> 00:53:29,260
project called project cotton economy

1211
00:53:25,720 --> 00:53:31,630
that had successfully tested a bottom-up

1212
00:53:29,260 --> 00:53:33,400
approach that relied on local farmer

1213
00:53:31,630 --> 00:53:36,820
organizations for the delivery of

1214
00:53:33,400 --> 00:53:39,820
extension and value change services so

1215
00:53:36,820 --> 00:53:41,950
Nathon buys goal was to scale the

1216
00:53:39,820 --> 00:53:44,680
adoption of technologies and practices

1217
00:53:41,950 --> 00:53:49,510
that were identified as promising and

1218
00:53:44,680 --> 00:53:52,510
that network model was expected to be

1219
00:53:49,510 --> 00:53:55,600
scaled up now not owned by as the

1220
00:53:52,510 --> 00:53:59,050
project had a very ambitious coverage

1221
00:53:55,600 --> 00:54:02,260
target the idea was to cover forty

1222
00:53:59,050 --> 00:54:03,820
percent on average of the household the

1223
00:54:02,260 --> 00:54:06,930
rural household with its zone of

1224
00:54:03,820 --> 00:54:12,490
influence which is quite large it also

1225
00:54:06,930 --> 00:54:16,210
had ambitious technical goals for

1226
00:54:12,490 --> 00:54:19,060
example achieving widespread Geographic

1227
00:54:16,210 --> 00:54:22,060
and population coverage making sure that

1228
00:54:19,060 --> 00:54:24,970
adoption of technologies was lasting

1229
00:54:22,060 --> 00:54:28,000
across the board and that all of this

1230
00:54:24,970 --> 00:54:29,830
results in systemic transformation in

1231
00:54:28,000 --> 00:54:32,440
the delivery of production post harvest

1232
00:54:29,830 --> 00:54:35,880
and financial services so we were really

1233
00:54:32,440 --> 00:54:38,500
looking at something transformational

1234
00:54:35,880 --> 00:54:40,840
however apart from direct technical

1235
00:54:38,500 --> 00:54:42,790
assistance and facilitation the project

1236
00:54:40,840 --> 00:54:45,280
was only able to rely on the

1237
00:54:42,790 --> 00:54:48,400
subcontracting fund with a focus on

1238
00:54:45,280 --> 00:54:54,810
local service contracts and we did not

1239
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:58,110
have any grant facility so wait wait

1240
00:54:54,810 --> 00:54:58,110
here we go

1241
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:02,880
sorry I went through that first

1242
00:55:01,080 --> 00:55:06,030
insurance slide but the most important

1243
00:55:02,880 --> 00:55:09,330
one is the next one so strategically to

1244
00:55:06,030 --> 00:55:12,500
be able to achieve that scaling and and

1245
00:55:09,330 --> 00:55:16,590
also having in-depth technology adoption

1246
00:55:12,500 --> 00:55:18,750
we the project established its total

1247
00:55:16,590 --> 00:55:20,790
footprint during the first year I mean

1248
00:55:18,750 --> 00:55:24,119
right from the start this gave it for

1249
00:55:20,790 --> 00:55:26,100
seasonal cycle over which targeted

1250
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:27,810
communities could progressively adopt

1251
00:55:26,100 --> 00:55:30,600
technologies and practices while

1252
00:55:27,810 --> 00:55:32,820
expanding their membership through what

1253
00:55:30,600 --> 00:55:36,510
you know is today called scaling in

1254
00:55:32,820 --> 00:55:39,180
process the project then selected

1255
00:55:36,510 --> 00:55:40,980
therefore selected a base of 120 pre

1256
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:43,980
established producer networks made up

1257
00:55:40,980 --> 00:55:48,119
mainly of cooperatives but also some

1258
00:55:43,980 --> 00:55:50,880
very local NGOs and a handful of SME

1259
00:55:48,119 --> 00:55:52,890
aggregators that relied exclusively on

1260
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:57,510
small holder sourcing in a structured

1261
00:55:52,890 --> 00:56:00,030
way now these networks were contracted

1262
00:55:57,510 --> 00:56:02,070
on a year-to-year basis to be the ones

1263
00:56:00,030 --> 00:56:04,470
that deliver productivity training and

1264
00:56:02,070 --> 00:56:06,990
develop new value change services in an

1265
00:56:04,470 --> 00:56:09,420
independent way now under these

1266
00:56:06,990 --> 00:56:11,900
contracts that works typically needed to

1267
00:56:09,420 --> 00:56:16,290
set up a homegrown extension team

1268
00:56:11,900 --> 00:56:18,540
composed of a database manager field

1269
00:56:16,290 --> 00:56:22,530
agent and leaf farmers who acted as

1270
00:56:18,540 --> 00:56:26,910
village contact points the database

1271
00:56:22,530 --> 00:56:29,670
managers and the database managers and

1272
00:56:26,910 --> 00:56:31,950
the field agent roles required advanced

1273
00:56:29,670 --> 00:56:34,619
literacy and the ability to adopt IT

1274
00:56:31,950 --> 00:56:36,869
technologies and so were generally

1275
00:56:34,619 --> 00:56:39,270
recruited locally by the networks

1276
00:56:36,869 --> 00:56:42,510
amongst the zones young educated youth

1277
00:56:39,270 --> 00:56:46,020
there are some even in the most remote

1278
00:56:42,510 --> 00:56:47,730
area but the minimum schooling level was

1279
00:56:46,020 --> 00:56:51,600
set at tenth grade level and that was

1280
00:56:47,730 --> 00:56:58,650
sufficient to ensure competent database

1281
00:56:51,600 --> 00:57:00,440
managers so as we said you know the

1282
00:56:58,650 --> 00:57:03,180
project picked us on the technological

1283
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:05,970
portfolio that was inherited from this

1284
00:57:03,180 --> 00:57:09,740
year but that eventually evolved the

1285
00:57:05,970 --> 00:57:12,470
idea here is was to have the network's

1286
00:57:09,740 --> 00:57:15,780
progressively become

1287
00:57:12,470 --> 00:57:18,540
trusted market agents at their community

1288
00:57:15,780 --> 00:57:21,840
level the result that has been partially

1289
00:57:18,540 --> 00:57:23,940
attained under the method and the

1290
00:57:21,840 --> 00:57:27,030
predecessor project so this market

1291
00:57:23,940 --> 00:57:28,920
driven extension went beyond strict

1292
00:57:27,030 --> 00:57:31,260
economic messaging and sought to

1293
00:57:28,920 --> 00:57:33,330
strengthen the agency of the farmer

1294
00:57:31,260 --> 00:57:35,370
based organizations within the value

1295
00:57:33,330 --> 00:57:39,150
chain so really make them full-fledged

1296
00:57:35,370 --> 00:57:40,710
market actors several these packages

1297
00:57:39,150 --> 00:57:43,140
were adapted from national extension

1298
00:57:40,710 --> 00:57:45,030
technical documents the regulations

1299
00:57:43,140 --> 00:57:46,920
research material technical

1300
00:57:45,030 --> 00:57:49,260
recommendations but also inspired by

1301
00:57:46,920 --> 00:57:52,380
private sector practices and

1302
00:57:49,260 --> 00:57:54,690
requirements so that output could

1303
00:57:52,380 --> 00:57:58,110
conform to norm by the end of the

1304
00:57:54,690 --> 00:58:00,390
project this footprint and the networks

1305
00:57:58,110 --> 00:58:04,740
had developed his own of influence

1306
00:58:00,390 --> 00:58:07,560
footprint of 5000 field based agents who

1307
00:58:04,740 --> 00:58:10,560
provide services to more than 150,000

1308
00:58:07,560 --> 00:58:13,620
farmers and generally the ratio for the

1309
00:58:10,560 --> 00:58:16,170
contact points is 1 to 30 and 150 for

1310
00:58:13,620 --> 00:58:18,450
one to 50 which is a you know an

1311
00:58:16,170 --> 00:58:21,000
efficient way of ensuring constant

1312
00:58:18,450 --> 00:58:24,480
outreach the representation of women

1313
00:58:21,000 --> 00:58:29,660
within the extension system this private

1314
00:58:24,480 --> 00:58:29,660
extension system is still far from

1315
00:58:43,230 --> 00:58:49,570
well hi everyone I have we have also

1316
00:58:46,750 --> 00:58:51,190
lost to Jean Michel temporarily he's

1317
00:58:49,570 --> 00:58:54,730
joining us from Senegal and so there may

1318
00:58:51,190 --> 00:58:56,500
be an issue with his phone if you

1319
00:58:54,730 --> 00:58:58,450
wouldn't mind hanging tight for just a

1320
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,700
moment while we tried to get him back

1321
00:58:58,450 --> 00:59:02,470
that would be excellent gotta roll with

1322
00:59:00,700 --> 00:59:05,190
the punches on these webinars though the

1323
00:59:02,470 --> 00:59:08,730
ones been so great so far so we're

1324
00:59:05,190 --> 00:59:08,730
trying to get him back

1325
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:24,670
hello where are we at did you pick up I

1326
00:59:20,670 --> 00:59:24,970
really lost maybe 30 seconds of yours

1327
00:59:24,670 --> 00:59:26,680
again

1328
00:59:24,970 --> 00:59:28,480
I was talking about I was talking about

1329
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:35,760
gender disparity did you hear about that

1330
00:59:28,480 --> 00:59:39,190
I kid that's a good place to pick up

1331
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:41,830
okay so the representation of women in

1332
00:59:39,190 --> 00:59:46,030
the system is not at parity

1333
00:59:41,830 --> 00:59:49,510
20% of database managers are women and

1334
00:59:46,030 --> 00:59:52,360
23% of field agents and 18% of Lee

1335
00:59:49,510 --> 00:59:54,130
farmers now by comparison 40% of the

1336
00:59:52,360 --> 00:59:57,550
total farmer population reached by the

1337
00:59:54,130 --> 00:59:59,830
project were women so that comes from

1338
00:59:57,550 --> 01:00:02,950
various factors first well corn millet

1339
00:59:59,830 --> 01:00:05,200
and irrigated rice are traditionally

1340
01:00:02,950 --> 01:00:09,910
male-dominated commodities rain-fed rice

1341
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:12,910
itself is a women's crop with 64% of

1342
01:00:09,910 --> 01:00:15,250
women practicing it but the key element

1343
01:00:12,910 --> 01:00:17,380
was the differing literacy levels

1344
01:00:15,250 --> 01:00:20,110
amongst genders and that played a role

1345
01:00:17,380 --> 01:00:22,930
and as did the requirements for mobility

1346
01:00:20,110 --> 01:00:25,390
between communities which favors men for

1347
01:00:22,930 --> 01:00:27,520
the field agent roles however the

1348
01:00:25,390 --> 01:00:31,350
improving rural literacy with young

1349
01:00:27,520 --> 01:00:40,020
women is gradually changing that profile

1350
01:00:31,350 --> 01:00:42,460
now now the approach here since we were

1351
01:00:40,020 --> 01:00:44,920
establishing a footprint for continuity

1352
01:00:42,460 --> 01:00:48,520
the idea was to provide continuous

1353
01:00:44,920 --> 01:00:50,890
facilitation and gradually have networks

1354
01:00:48,520 --> 01:00:54,300
progress in terms of competencies and

1355
01:00:50,890 --> 01:00:55,550
autonomy so you the initial objective

1356
01:00:54,300 --> 01:00:58,430
was

1357
01:00:55,550 --> 01:01:02,300
to have farmers work with their

1358
01:00:58,430 --> 01:01:04,970
membership to achieve a productivity

1359
01:01:02,300 --> 01:01:09,130
level that were that produced consistent

1360
01:01:04,970 --> 01:01:12,170
surpluses gradually progressing to

1361
01:01:09,130 --> 01:01:15,140
developing sound input financing plans

1362
01:01:12,170 --> 01:01:17,720
and marketing plan finding

1363
01:01:15,140 --> 01:01:19,850
intensification solutions in terms of

1364
01:01:17,720 --> 01:01:22,490
mechanization practices and gradually

1365
01:01:19,850 --> 01:01:24,620
you know being able to manage a web of

1366
01:01:22,490 --> 01:01:27,050
various contractual arrangements with

1367
01:01:24,620 --> 01:01:30,140
banks insurance companies input

1368
01:01:27,050 --> 01:01:32,570
providers it arise even developing

1369
01:01:30,140 --> 01:01:36,920
linkages with the National Extension

1370
01:01:32,570 --> 01:01:41,030
Service to do information exchange now

1371
01:01:36,920 --> 01:01:44,120
this required learning element so we the

1372
01:01:41,030 --> 01:01:46,370
project facilitated learning meet you

1373
01:01:44,120 --> 01:01:49,460
know from year to year various networks

1374
01:01:46,370 --> 01:01:52,720
with me at the regional and the crop

1375
01:01:49,460 --> 01:01:55,430
level to exchange best practices and

1376
01:01:52,720 --> 01:01:57,890
would discuss issues such as seed

1377
01:01:55,430 --> 01:02:00,650
variety performance we discussed quality

1378
01:01:57,890 --> 01:02:02,690
standards pricing thresholds climate

1379
01:02:00,650 --> 01:02:06,620
response strategies and in the end would

1380
01:02:02,690 --> 01:02:08,420
adopt their internal functioning to take

1381
01:02:06,620 --> 01:02:14,270
account of the various recommendations

1382
01:02:08,420 --> 01:02:17,410
that they made themselves now an

1383
01:02:14,270 --> 01:02:20,480
innovative element of the program was to

1384
01:02:17,410 --> 01:02:24,050
download completely the data processing

1385
01:02:20,480 --> 01:02:29,530
work at the farmer level using very

1386
01:02:24,050 --> 01:02:33,310
basic data services off-the-shelf or

1387
01:02:29,530 --> 01:02:38,840
open source and having the farmers

1388
01:02:33,310 --> 01:02:44,090
manage it themselves so that really had

1389
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:48,230
a big impact in building trust and and

1390
01:02:44,090 --> 01:02:50,630
building competency it turned the farmer

1391
01:02:48,230 --> 01:02:53,690
led intention into it that's a driven

1392
01:02:50,630 --> 01:02:56,810
process people were talking in numbers

1393
01:02:53,690 --> 01:02:59,180
it's establishing sowing thresholds in

1394
01:02:56,810 --> 01:03:02,360
terms of duration at a certain number of

1395
01:02:59,180 --> 01:03:04,670
millimeters you know and assessing

1396
01:03:02,360 --> 01:03:07,010
yields with high precision and even

1397
01:03:04,670 --> 01:03:08,410
doing crosshair comparisons I mean I've

1398
01:03:07,010 --> 01:03:11,110
been told that so

1399
01:03:08,410 --> 01:03:14,260
one assisted a crop meeting and said

1400
01:03:11,110 --> 01:03:16,360
that he was surprised to have farmers

1401
01:03:14,260 --> 01:03:18,910
regular farmers talking about their

1402
01:03:16,360 --> 01:03:21,930
three-year yield profile and saying how

1403
01:03:18,910 --> 01:03:25,180
they were progressing now the data

1404
01:03:21,930 --> 01:03:28,690
getting data processing services at the

1405
01:03:25,180 --> 01:03:31,300
farmer level was also a stage program it

1406
01:03:28,690 --> 01:03:32,620
was like a learning activity that had

1407
01:03:31,300 --> 01:03:34,600
networks

1408
01:03:32,620 --> 01:03:36,790
start with a profiling phase like

1409
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:39,130
learning how to profile their membership

1410
01:03:36,790 --> 01:03:41,740
so working with static databases but

1411
01:03:39,130 --> 01:03:44,050
that were descriptive and enabled them

1412
01:03:41,740 --> 01:03:47,020
to really monitor who was who and who

1413
01:03:44,050 --> 01:03:49,300
had what in terms of product and

1414
01:03:47,020 --> 01:03:53,080
capacity then fall it was followed by a

1415
01:03:49,300 --> 01:03:56,170
more analytical learning phase where the

1416
01:03:53,080 --> 01:03:57,610
focus was put on how to mine those

1417
01:03:56,170 --> 01:03:59,350
statistics and assess their own

1418
01:03:57,610 --> 01:04:01,840
performance and finally the more

1419
01:03:59,350 --> 01:04:04,900
advanced team's graduated to real-time

1420
01:04:01,840 --> 01:04:06,970
data to support more transactional and

1421
01:04:04,900 --> 01:04:09,040
tracking activities such as like loan

1422
01:04:06,970 --> 01:04:11,770
and insurance application input

1423
01:04:09,040 --> 01:04:14,290
procurement and distribution real-time

1424
01:04:11,770 --> 01:04:16,870
local weather data collection and just

1425
01:04:14,290 --> 01:04:21,550
managing overall crop aggregation now

1426
01:04:16,870 --> 01:04:24,820
these these system did not work in

1427
01:04:21,550 --> 01:04:26,770
vacuum or let's say in just within the

1428
01:04:24,820 --> 01:04:29,860
network I mean throughout the program

1429
01:04:26,770 --> 01:04:32,050
these farmers use this data to enter

1430
01:04:29,860 --> 01:04:35,710
interact with their partners interact

1431
01:04:32,050 --> 01:04:37,870
with government authorities interact you

1432
01:04:35,710 --> 01:04:41,290
know with the environment at large and

1433
01:04:37,870 --> 01:04:42,790
the the effect has been to build a

1434
01:04:41,290 --> 01:04:45,550
climate of trust and really an

1435
01:04:42,790 --> 01:04:48,910
evidence-based climate of discussion

1436
01:04:45,550 --> 01:04:51,490
both with trading partners farmers and

1437
01:04:48,910 --> 01:04:53,050
the government and that was a very

1438
01:04:51,490 --> 01:05:02,290
critical element in terms of

1439
01:04:53,050 --> 01:05:03,880
reinforcement okay NLM is and I'll be

1440
01:05:02,290 --> 01:05:06,310
quick on that one because that's a

1441
01:05:03,880 --> 01:05:10,090
subject in itself but I just want to

1442
01:05:06,310 --> 01:05:11,950
mention that the level of reinforcement

1443
01:05:10,090 --> 01:05:14,650
attained by these farmer organizations

1444
01:05:11,950 --> 01:05:16,450
really made them like independent agents

1445
01:05:14,650 --> 01:05:19,360
in negotiating with the outside world

1446
01:05:16,450 --> 01:05:22,090
and so we call that you know a shift

1447
01:05:19,360 --> 01:05:25,510
from a classic vertical structure

1448
01:05:22,090 --> 01:05:28,630
you have the central organizing firm or

1449
01:05:25,510 --> 01:05:31,690
entity that groups all that and does a

1450
01:05:28,630 --> 01:05:33,760
lot of work on the farmers behalf to a

1451
01:05:31,690 --> 01:05:38,700
system where the farmers are empowered

1452
01:05:33,760 --> 01:05:42,270
to transact with a variety of banks of

1453
01:05:38,700 --> 01:05:45,400
clients of service providers inputs of

1454
01:05:42,270 --> 01:05:50,740
providers and and are able to get the

1455
01:05:45,400 --> 01:05:53,580
best possible price and so that actually

1456
01:05:50,740 --> 01:05:56,440
was very conducive in building value and

1457
01:05:53,580 --> 01:05:59,440
was an essentially a very data-driven

1458
01:05:56,440 --> 01:06:01,450
process just to say that you know these

1459
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,330
farmer organizations on their own like

1460
01:06:01,450 --> 01:06:05,890
managed successfully more than hundred

1461
01:06:04,330 --> 01:06:08,590
fifty million dollars in short-term

1462
01:06:05,890 --> 01:06:11,610
loans thirty-four thousand of them

1463
01:06:08,590 --> 01:06:15,100
managed to access agricultural insurance

1464
01:06:11,610 --> 01:06:18,310
it simulated the emergence of the

1465
01:06:15,100 --> 01:06:20,380
mechanized service providers in terms of

1466
01:06:18,310 --> 01:06:23,830
land preparation and harvesting etcetera

1467
01:06:20,380 --> 01:06:26,020
etcetera that the the indicators are

1468
01:06:23,830 --> 01:06:28,330
interesting and but what's more

1469
01:06:26,020 --> 01:06:30,580
interesting is the agency that the

1470
01:06:28,330 --> 01:06:34,020
networks had in developing those

1471
01:06:30,580 --> 01:06:38,920
linkages and those activities they're

1472
01:06:34,020 --> 01:06:41,560
now the project closed out last June

1473
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:44,410
okay so that's pretty much a hard stuff

1474
01:06:41,560 --> 01:06:46,600
I mean Senegal still eventually will be

1475
01:06:44,410 --> 01:06:49,180
getting feed the future support but this

1476
01:06:46,600 --> 01:06:52,540
season the farmers have been left

1477
01:06:49,180 --> 01:06:54,730
fending for themselves so what happened

1478
01:06:52,540 --> 01:06:57,130
did everything go crashing now you see

1479
01:06:54,730 --> 01:07:00,070
on the slide in that the ia president of

1480
01:06:57,130 --> 01:07:03,010
pepper Maxwell I met with her along with

1481
01:07:00,070 --> 01:07:04,870
a few networks across the country went

1482
01:07:03,010 --> 01:07:07,270
to visit just to see what was going on I

1483
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:10,900
mean for for the current grain team are

1484
01:07:07,270 --> 01:07:12,820
they by they carrying on and what's

1485
01:07:10,900 --> 01:07:14,470
interesting is that the majority of them

1486
01:07:12,820 --> 01:07:17,800
I mean all the ones I visited I know

1487
01:07:14,470 --> 01:07:21,220
that a few smaller organizations don't

1488
01:07:17,800 --> 01:07:24,040
yet have the their full autonomy but

1489
01:07:21,220 --> 01:07:27,100
most of them have been able to maintain

1490
01:07:24,040 --> 01:07:29,950
and grow their service levels of farmers

1491
01:07:27,100 --> 01:07:32,400
they maintain low those who were working

1492
01:07:29,950 --> 01:07:35,320
with loan applications managing

1493
01:07:32,400 --> 01:07:37,450
insurance all these elements

1494
01:07:35,320 --> 01:07:40,060
were maintaining their activity and some

1495
01:07:37,450 --> 01:07:42,640
even had begun diversifying their

1496
01:07:40,060 --> 01:07:44,650
portfolio of activities by monitoring

1497
01:07:42,640 --> 01:07:47,500
horticulture and livestock activities

1498
01:07:44,650 --> 01:07:50,020
each group we surveyed had developed its

1499
01:07:47,500 --> 01:07:52,740
own cost recovery approach through a mix

1500
01:07:50,020 --> 01:07:55,570
of rationalization of the extension team

1501
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:58,240
adaptation of the databases to simplify

1502
01:07:55,570 --> 01:08:00,910
them introduction or increase in

1503
01:07:58,240 --> 01:08:03,250
membership dues and developing service

1504
01:08:00,910 --> 01:08:06,010
charges or specific services such as

1505
01:08:03,250 --> 01:08:09,520
real-time rainfall tracking and GPS

1506
01:08:06,010 --> 01:08:11,740
field surveying some of them had deals

1507
01:08:09,520 --> 01:08:14,790
with the insurance company to have

1508
01:08:11,740 --> 01:08:17,440
Commission on the management of the

1509
01:08:14,790 --> 01:08:21,190
insuring process and you know selling

1510
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:23,970
insurance and also they some of them

1511
01:08:21,190 --> 01:08:26,049
negotiated deals with input supplier and

1512
01:08:23,970 --> 01:08:30,310
allocated a portion of the volume

1513
01:08:26,049 --> 01:08:32,770
rebates to the actual extension work in

1514
01:08:30,310 --> 01:08:37,180
some cases brokerage fees were allowed

1515
01:08:32,770 --> 01:08:39,310
and margins on sale or you know volumes

1516
01:08:37,180 --> 01:08:42,580
allocated to loan reimbursements were

1517
01:08:39,310 --> 01:08:45,040
allocated to the funding system and in

1518
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,200
some cases agreements with buyers

1519
01:08:45,040 --> 01:08:49,810
actually to fund the part of the

1520
01:08:47,200 --> 01:08:52,660
Extension Service were negotiated but

1521
01:08:49,810 --> 01:08:55,390
there's you know this clear a Latina

1522
01:08:52,660 --> 01:08:57,490
that was interesting and that was

1523
01:08:55,390 --> 01:08:59,230
permitted by the agency that the

1524
01:08:57,490 --> 01:09:01,510
network's had and the knowledge level

1525
01:08:59,230 --> 01:09:04,089
they had to develop something that fit

1526
01:09:01,510 --> 01:09:05,740
their own circumstances and I well I'm

1527
01:09:04,089 --> 01:09:07,900
pretty encouraged by that I'm pretty

1528
01:09:05,740 --> 01:09:11,859
happy with that they're doing well now

1529
01:09:07,900 --> 01:09:13,270
where are they gonna go so what's the

1530
01:09:11,859 --> 01:09:17,200
future challenges

1531
01:09:13,270 --> 01:09:19,990
well the network's okay they

1532
01:09:17,200 --> 01:09:21,760
demonstrated a capacity to play a very

1533
01:09:19,990 --> 01:09:24,819
positive role in the delivery of

1534
01:09:21,760 --> 01:09:27,790
extension and more than that value to

1535
01:09:24,819 --> 01:09:29,319
farmers I mean that is what keeps them

1536
01:09:27,790 --> 01:09:31,150
in business the fact that they're

1537
01:09:29,319 --> 01:09:33,520
getting value value in terms of

1538
01:09:31,150 --> 01:09:36,010
productivity value in terms of market

1539
01:09:33,520 --> 01:09:38,230
access but also value in terms of risk

1540
01:09:36,010 --> 01:09:41,260
reduction which is one of the critical

1541
01:09:38,230 --> 01:09:43,870
value points for the very small rain-fed

1542
01:09:41,260 --> 01:09:46,440
challenge farmers that are challenged

1543
01:09:43,870 --> 01:09:49,060
every year by a whole series of risks

1544
01:09:46,440 --> 01:09:53,050
there's an expressed need by them

1545
01:09:49,060 --> 01:09:56,350
to further develop the model to adapt to

1546
01:09:53,050 --> 01:09:58,600
new crops and new services that would

1547
01:09:56,350 --> 01:10:00,910
effectively leverage the power of

1548
01:09:58,600 --> 01:10:03,100
digital technology so there's a demand

1549
01:10:00,910 --> 01:10:06,240
for new technologies adaptive

1550
01:10:03,100 --> 01:10:08,230
technologies that accelerate the system

1551
01:10:06,240 --> 01:10:11,100
what we're seeing is that the inclusion

1552
01:10:08,230 --> 01:10:14,020
of women farmers as fully empowered

1553
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:16,810
agents remains a challenge because of

1554
01:10:14,020 --> 01:10:19,300
the size of the farm but there are

1555
01:10:16,810 --> 01:10:22,090
solutions that are there but they they

1556
01:10:19,300 --> 01:10:25,480
really need to be to be expanded and

1557
01:10:22,090 --> 01:10:29,080
diversified but they they do have a

1558
01:10:25,480 --> 01:10:30,850
market justification all networks see

1559
01:10:29,080 --> 01:10:33,970
the inclusion of their communities use

1560
01:10:30,850 --> 01:10:37,270
as an opportunity especially as far as

1561
01:10:33,970 --> 01:10:38,890
the you know downstream organization of

1562
01:10:37,270 --> 01:10:41,680
the activities such as like data

1563
01:10:38,890 --> 01:10:43,780
collection and the various tracking and

1564
01:10:41,680 --> 01:10:44,650
management activities where youth really

1565
01:10:43,780 --> 01:10:48,130
excel

1566
01:10:44,650 --> 01:10:51,070
however networks it should be said that

1567
01:10:48,130 --> 01:10:53,020
net these networks cannot replace the

1568
01:10:51,070 --> 01:10:55,120
foundational need for public good

1569
01:10:53,020 --> 01:10:58,300
knowledge and services that's provided

1570
01:10:55,120 --> 01:11:01,360
by agronomic research for the regulation

1571
01:10:58,300 --> 01:11:04,150
of the perceived quality and inputs or

1572
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:07,270
the production of meteo data or and

1573
01:11:04,150 --> 01:11:10,810
forecast these networks cannot either

1574
01:11:07,270 --> 01:11:16,540
self-financed roads or improvements in

1575
01:11:10,810 --> 01:11:18,820
rural IT nor can they yet fully finance

1576
01:11:16,540 --> 01:11:20,920
large-scale storage infrastructure so

1577
01:11:18,820 --> 01:11:22,900
government has to interact with these

1578
01:11:20,920 --> 01:11:24,640
groups and and actually they've begun

1579
01:11:22,900 --> 01:11:26,860
doing that in Senegal that's what's

1580
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:28,660
interesting I mean they there are clear

1581
01:11:26,860 --> 01:11:30,940
platforms that have been developed

1582
01:11:28,660 --> 01:11:33,760
between these farmer organizations and

1583
01:11:30,940 --> 01:11:37,780
the various decentralized governance

1584
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:42,970
services and that's very promising USAID

1585
01:11:37,780 --> 01:11:45,340
is also using these networks to to do as

1586
01:11:42,970 --> 01:11:49,540
far as their nutrition program which

1587
01:11:45,340 --> 01:11:51,970
gives them a more resilience role just

1588
01:11:49,540 --> 01:11:57,810
by their skills and permanence in terms

1589
01:11:51,970 --> 01:12:00,520
of organizing local capacity so finally

1590
01:11:57,810 --> 01:12:02,590
what I want to say is that the level of

1591
01:12:00,520 --> 01:12:04,150
self-organization these neat networks

1592
01:12:02,590 --> 01:12:05,890
have it she

1593
01:12:04,150 --> 01:12:08,080
can be leveraged by government to

1594
01:12:05,890 --> 01:12:10,780
maximize the impact of public investment

1595
01:12:08,080 --> 01:12:13,810
and they can become effective relays of

1596
01:12:10,780 --> 01:12:16,120
extension messaging but beyond that they

1597
01:12:13,810 --> 01:12:18,400
are fully empowered value chain actors

1598
01:12:16,120 --> 01:12:21,910
and have to a role to play in that

1599
01:12:18,400 --> 01:12:24,400
domain from now on so okay I'm looking

1600
01:12:21,910 --> 01:12:27,120
forward to your questions and thank you

1601
01:12:24,400 --> 01:12:27,120
for your attention

1602
01:12:30,570 --> 01:12:36,910
great thank you so much Joe Michel let's

1603
01:12:35,140 --> 01:12:38,830
see we have had a couple of questions

1604
01:12:36,910 --> 01:12:41,110
come in for you and then we'll open it

1605
01:12:38,830 --> 01:12:42,670
up to some further questions for all

1606
01:12:41,110 --> 01:12:46,570
three of our presenters and we have

1607
01:12:42,670 --> 01:12:49,900
about 15 minutes left for questions so

1608
01:12:46,570 --> 01:12:52,570
Zoe so mark blackett asked is the farmer

1609
01:12:49,900 --> 01:12:55,120
owned database system available for

1610
01:12:52,570 --> 01:12:57,880
others to use an ongoing our new

1611
01:12:55,120 --> 01:13:02,590
projects to help prevent reinventing the

1612
01:12:57,880 --> 01:13:05,770
wheel in this case yes well what I want

1613
01:13:02,590 --> 01:13:08,890
to say is that there is no software that

1614
01:13:05,770 --> 01:13:12,610
for that market farmer owned database

1615
01:13:08,890 --> 01:13:16,390
system it's actually a hack a hack of

1616
01:13:12,610 --> 01:13:19,570
the various Excel Dropbox and other

1617
01:13:16,390 --> 01:13:22,260
software's the more advanced will work

1618
01:13:19,570 --> 01:13:26,560
with the open source con care platform

1619
01:13:22,260 --> 01:13:30,220
which was engineered into an

1620
01:13:26,560 --> 01:13:34,090
agricultural extension activity system

1621
01:13:30,220 --> 01:13:37,330
and that also is available on open

1622
01:13:34,090 --> 01:13:39,070
source on the web it's more skilled here

1623
01:13:37,330 --> 01:13:41,170
that that's required it's not the the

1624
01:13:39,070 --> 01:13:43,720
software itself various applications

1625
01:13:41,170 --> 01:13:46,450
have been developed and plug into these

1626
01:13:43,720 --> 01:13:50,560
systems but they they are independent

1627
01:13:46,450 --> 01:13:53,140
and freestanding as we speak so they are

1628
01:13:50,560 --> 01:13:55,300
available there will be documentation on

1629
01:13:53,140 --> 01:13:58,420
what they represent they that will be

1630
01:13:55,300 --> 01:14:01,660
available but the the approaches are a

1631
01:13:58,420 --> 01:14:04,060
really open source and based on making

1632
01:14:01,660 --> 01:14:06,520
sure that you have people who can manage

1633
01:14:04,060 --> 01:14:09,100
the data at the local level and this is

1634
01:14:06,520 --> 01:14:12,310
where having farmers that are able to

1635
01:14:09,100 --> 01:14:14,370
handle Excel having you know locally

1636
01:14:12,310 --> 01:14:16,480
based people that can even do

1637
01:14:14,370 --> 01:14:20,140
pivottables and doing pretty

1638
01:14:16,480 --> 01:14:22,750
sophisticated analysis really makes it a

1639
01:14:20,140 --> 01:14:24,580
very very resilient system one of the

1640
01:14:22,750 --> 01:14:27,460
most popular apps now that was a

1641
01:14:24,580 --> 01:14:29,850
byproduct of the digital expansion we

1642
01:14:27,460 --> 01:14:33,910
did is actually what's up you know and

1643
01:14:29,850 --> 01:14:36,780
there's a I think there's a lot of work

1644
01:14:33,910 --> 01:14:40,360
to be done in how to hack together

1645
01:14:36,780 --> 01:14:44,850
interesting application using either

1646
01:14:40,360 --> 01:14:44,850
social media or generic software

1647
01:14:48,300 --> 01:14:54,550
great thank you an interesting question

1648
01:14:51,010 --> 01:14:56,230
just came in from Sara Huber how are

1649
01:14:54,550 --> 01:14:56,950
these farmer organizations in your

1650
01:14:56,230 --> 01:14:59,470
example

1651
01:14:56,950 --> 01:15:00,970
so high-functioning were they selected

1652
01:14:59,470 --> 01:15:03,940
carefully or was there some sort of

1653
01:15:00,970 --> 01:15:05,830
significant training provided and also a

1654
01:15:03,940 --> 01:15:07,570
separate question how were the bank

1655
01:15:05,830 --> 01:15:11,650
loans facilitated and what did they

1656
01:15:07,570 --> 01:15:14,710
cover yeah so that that's the question

1657
01:15:11,650 --> 01:15:17,830
is always that's where some people often

1658
01:15:14,710 --> 01:15:21,040
talk about a senegalese exception in

1659
01:15:17,830 --> 01:15:23,440
terms of organizational development I

1660
01:15:21,040 --> 01:15:26,140
want to say that an organization like

1661
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,840
diplomats for example where you know we

1662
01:15:26,140 --> 01:15:33,910
had Nina there talking about her thing

1663
01:15:28,840 --> 01:15:36,310
is actually made of you know 12 highly

1664
01:15:33,910 --> 01:15:38,590
dysfunctional small farmer groups but

1665
01:15:36,310 --> 01:15:42,820
that at one point decided to join forces

1666
01:15:38,590 --> 01:15:44,980
and asked us to be empowered and manage

1667
01:15:42,820 --> 01:15:47,350
their own thing really you know it's not

1668
01:15:44,980 --> 01:15:50,110
like we invented that it was a reaction

1669
01:15:47,350 --> 01:15:52,870
to a very dysfunctional top-down

1670
01:15:50,110 --> 01:15:55,000
extension system where the lead firm was

1671
01:15:52,870 --> 01:15:57,250
actually taking advantage of his father

1672
01:15:55,000 --> 01:15:59,890
his position and the farmers told us

1673
01:15:57,250 --> 01:16:01,870
rather than dropping the program what if

1674
01:15:59,890 --> 01:16:04,540
we got together and provided our own

1675
01:16:01,870 --> 01:16:07,870
extension so the key word is motivation

1676
01:16:04,540 --> 01:16:10,360
you know and then testing them you want

1677
01:16:07,870 --> 01:16:12,220
to have a basic legal structure you want

1678
01:16:10,360 --> 01:16:14,560
to have had a certain level of

1679
01:16:12,220 --> 01:16:16,720
self-organization but then you want to

1680
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:19,120
give them a motive their initial motive

1681
01:16:16,720 --> 01:16:22,120
will be productivity their initial then

1682
01:16:19,120 --> 01:16:24,760
it follows on as they see that the risk

1683
01:16:22,120 --> 01:16:28,249
is reduced they they'll want to find

1684
01:16:24,760 --> 01:16:29,780
markets they'll want to find financing

1685
01:16:28,249 --> 01:16:32,570
and this is where you know you have

1686
01:16:29,780 --> 01:16:35,210
different middle facilitation components

1687
01:16:32,570 --> 01:16:37,610
that come in but you really want to

1688
01:16:35,210 --> 01:16:41,570
select the farmer organization that have

1689
01:16:37,610 --> 01:16:44,960
a will to succeed and we did capitalize

1690
01:16:41,570 --> 01:16:48,099
on the initial group of 10 or 20 farmer

1691
01:16:44,960 --> 01:16:52,030
organization but where locally it

1692
01:16:48,099 --> 01:16:56,749
generated a series of application and

1693
01:16:52,030 --> 01:16:59,090
n-by-n and and then the idea here is to

1694
01:16:56,749 --> 01:17:02,440
provide continuity and really build them

1695
01:16:59,090 --> 01:17:05,239
up over a period of time but not in

1696
01:17:02,440 --> 01:17:07,219
theoretical capacity building but

1697
01:17:05,239 --> 01:17:10,760
capacity building that is oriented

1698
01:17:07,219 --> 01:17:13,909
towards very clear value proposition by

1699
01:17:10,760 --> 01:17:19,880
farmers and that really really creates a

1700
01:17:13,909 --> 01:17:21,860
momentum for the bank loans well the

1701
01:17:19,880 --> 01:17:25,460
bank loan essentially for the farmer

1702
01:17:21,860 --> 01:17:27,170
organizations cover inputs okay there

1703
01:17:25,460 --> 01:17:29,449
has been other series of bank loan we

1704
01:17:27,170 --> 01:17:32,119
facilitated for their clients what's

1705
01:17:29,449 --> 01:17:37,849
interesting with the bank loan is to to

1706
01:17:32,119 --> 01:17:41,179
develop the the to make it happen was to

1707
01:17:37,849 --> 01:17:43,699
develop how can I say collateral

1708
01:17:41,179 --> 01:17:46,579
strategies and risk management strategy

1709
01:17:43,699 --> 01:17:50,300
and so this is where inventory

1710
01:17:46,579 --> 01:17:52,969
collateral system not necessarily

1711
01:17:50,300 --> 01:17:55,489
warehouse receipts but collateral

1712
01:17:52,969 --> 01:17:57,499
systems that are oriented towards quick

1713
01:17:55,489 --> 01:18:02,360
trading you know warehouse receipt is

1714
01:17:57,499 --> 01:18:05,479
about waiting collateral loans are more

1715
01:18:02,360 --> 01:18:08,479
about securing the reimbursement by

1716
01:18:05,479 --> 01:18:10,820
stocks that are then transferred on to a

1717
01:18:08,479 --> 01:18:13,579
buyer and there you have interlocking

1718
01:18:10,820 --> 01:18:15,170
credit mechanisms so that that has been

1719
01:18:13,579 --> 01:18:17,599
documented on the project there will be

1720
01:18:15,170 --> 01:18:20,539
further documentation on how we did that

1721
01:18:17,599 --> 01:18:26,869
but this system that secures the product

1722
01:18:20,539 --> 01:18:31,999
by quality products really is a very

1723
01:18:26,869 --> 01:18:35,059
powerful way of growing of growing loans

1724
01:18:31,999 --> 01:18:37,340
of growing finance in a secure way AG

1725
01:18:35,059 --> 01:18:41,539
insurance is also very important I mean

1726
01:18:37,340 --> 01:18:45,619
the especially for rain-fed zones having

1727
01:18:41,539 --> 01:18:48,920
that protects the farmer in the bank as

1728
01:18:45,619 --> 01:18:51,889
to the loan reimbursement against the

1729
01:18:48,920 --> 01:18:55,400
climate event was also a very very

1730
01:18:51,889 --> 01:18:58,429
powerful tool to boost volumes in those

1731
01:18:55,400 --> 01:19:01,579
areas and that's actually very popular

1732
01:18:58,429 --> 01:19:04,130
with women's organizations to protect

1733
01:19:01,579 --> 01:19:06,949
the meager amount that they will put to

1734
01:19:04,130 --> 01:19:09,559
adopt input these kinds of index

1735
01:19:06,949 --> 01:19:11,179
insurance based on rainfall have gone a

1736
01:19:09,559 --> 01:19:19,369
long way with them it's actually very

1737
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:20,570
popular thanks so much Don Michele we

1738
01:19:19,369 --> 01:19:23,360
have about ten minutes left for

1739
01:19:20,570 --> 01:19:26,269
questions but before we ask a few more I

1740
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:28,369
wanted to open up our ending polls for

1741
01:19:26,269 --> 01:19:30,860
all of you to answer we'd appreciate if

1742
01:19:28,369 --> 01:19:33,800
you would just take a moment to chime in

1743
01:19:30,860 --> 01:19:36,110
on these polls and to let us know how we

1744
01:19:33,800 --> 01:19:37,429
can continue to improve our Agri links

1745
01:19:36,110 --> 01:19:39,829
webinars going forward

1746
01:19:37,429 --> 01:19:41,659
and as a reminder for any of you who do

1747
01:19:39,829 --> 01:19:44,150
need to leave early we will be sending

1748
01:19:41,659 --> 01:19:46,460
you the recording the transcript and

1749
01:19:44,150 --> 01:19:48,409
some additional resources from this

1750
01:19:46,460 --> 01:19:49,969
presentation by email and encourage you

1751
01:19:48,409 --> 01:19:51,949
to share it with your colleagues if you

1752
01:19:49,969 --> 01:20:00,949
think that they would be interested as

1753
01:19:51,949 --> 01:20:03,710
well right let's see me show we had a

1754
01:20:00,949 --> 01:20:06,559
question from Stafford Francis mom bola

1755
01:20:03,710 --> 01:20:09,199
about sustainability what are the

1756
01:20:06,559 --> 01:20:10,909
incentives for the network leaders to

1757
01:20:09,199 --> 01:20:14,179
continue to maintain their networks

1758
01:20:10,909 --> 01:20:18,650
after closeout are they paid or and if

1759
01:20:14,179 --> 01:20:20,420
so who pays them well the the farmer

1760
01:20:18,650 --> 01:20:22,789
what's interesting with this is that the

1761
01:20:20,420 --> 01:20:25,610
leaders are all farmers themselves you

1762
01:20:22,789 --> 01:20:27,469
know so they have an interest in

1763
01:20:25,610 --> 01:20:29,900
developing this pooling and this

1764
01:20:27,469 --> 01:20:32,690
grouping so you know they're not huge

1765
01:20:29,900 --> 01:20:35,210
farmers but there'll be farmers who who

1766
01:20:32,690 --> 01:20:37,820
have graduated to from let's say two

1767
01:20:35,210 --> 01:20:40,340
hectares to let's say 15 hectares

1768
01:20:37,820 --> 01:20:43,329
some of them will you know own a tractor

1769
01:20:40,340 --> 01:20:47,059
and they they're actually you know very

1770
01:20:43,329 --> 01:20:50,900
community-based people and so for them

1771
01:20:47,059 --> 01:20:53,170
you know the the organization it's not

1772
01:20:50,900 --> 01:20:56,230
just a simple business venture

1773
01:20:53,170 --> 01:21:00,160
it does have a social aspect to it okay

1774
01:20:56,230 --> 01:21:02,910
and the the leadership it's not just one

1775
01:21:00,160 --> 01:21:06,580
person's usually a group of people and

1776
01:21:02,910 --> 01:21:09,490
who together you know manage this so

1777
01:21:06,580 --> 01:21:13,510
they make their money in there with

1778
01:21:09,490 --> 01:21:15,760
their product some of them are let's say

1779
01:21:13,510 --> 01:21:18,490
certified seed producers so the group

1780
01:21:15,760 --> 01:21:21,760
also provides them with a ready market

1781
01:21:18,490 --> 01:21:25,300
and you know they will get involved in

1782
01:21:21,760 --> 01:21:28,350
sales and all that also but you know

1783
01:21:25,300 --> 01:21:32,440
it's it's really a very grassroots

1784
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:34,660
vision on things and and then they these

1785
01:21:32,440 --> 01:21:36,940
organization then negotiate with the

1786
01:21:34,660 --> 01:21:40,060
outside world but you know in terms of

1787
01:21:36,940 --> 01:21:42,910
needs you know they they have income

1788
01:21:40,060 --> 01:21:45,280
expectations that are very reasonable

1789
01:21:42,910 --> 01:21:47,830
for people who are present in those

1790
01:21:45,280 --> 01:21:50,440
communities and in those environments

1791
01:21:47,830 --> 01:21:53,170
and that's what makes it so powerful

1792
01:21:50,440 --> 01:21:57,040
it's the same thing for the field agents

1793
01:21:53,170 --> 01:21:59,830
people who know I t understand IT but

1794
01:21:57,040 --> 01:22:04,680
are used to living in those conditions

1795
01:21:59,830 --> 01:22:04,680
who do not want to migrate back to city

1796
01:22:11,700 --> 01:22:17,530
thank you Joe Michel and I think on top

1797
01:22:14,350 --> 01:22:20,010
of just one final quick question to you

1798
01:22:17,530 --> 01:22:22,960
from Judy Payne wondering if you

1799
01:22:20,010 --> 01:22:26,320
capitalized on enabling farmers being

1800
01:22:22,960 --> 01:22:28,390
able to compare their own data which of

1801
01:22:26,320 --> 01:22:30,220
course would open up some questions why

1802
01:22:28,390 --> 01:22:32,770
is that other farmer more productive

1803
01:22:30,220 --> 01:22:34,180
than me comparing numbers could be an

1804
01:22:32,770 --> 01:22:35,680
interesting way of promoting learning

1805
01:22:34,180 --> 01:22:40,390
and she was wondering if she did any of

1806
01:22:35,680 --> 01:22:43,450
that yes that was the big thing that was

1807
01:22:40,390 --> 01:22:45,760
it you know when you when the data is

1808
01:22:43,450 --> 01:22:49,120
shared amongst the farmers within the

1809
01:22:45,760 --> 01:22:52,600
community not in the project and then a

1810
01:22:49,120 --> 01:22:55,060
guy's wife sees on the on a flip chart

1811
01:22:52,600 --> 01:22:57,030
that she's actually making more than her

1812
01:22:55,060 --> 01:23:00,910
husband in terms of maize production

1813
01:22:57,030 --> 01:23:02,680
well that raises interesting discussions

1814
01:23:00,910 --> 01:23:05,590
and when you see that the neighboring

1815
01:23:02,680 --> 01:23:08,110
Network have higher yields that creates

1816
01:23:05,590 --> 01:23:11,740
also interesting discussions so that's

1817
01:23:08,110 --> 01:23:13,930
why you know this stage discussion based

1818
01:23:11,740 --> 01:23:17,140
on data was so important and really

1819
01:23:13,930 --> 01:23:19,030
starting at community level and we found

1820
01:23:17,140 --> 01:23:21,010
that farmers actually can understand

1821
01:23:19,030 --> 01:23:23,800
histograms you know I mean they they

1822
01:23:21,010 --> 01:23:25,930
understand distribution curves and

1823
01:23:23,800 --> 01:23:28,360
things like that they really do after a

1824
01:23:25,930 --> 01:23:31,540
while and they start talking into very

1825
01:23:28,360 --> 01:23:33,420
precise terms and so that's what's so

1826
01:23:31,540 --> 01:23:36,610
powerful with it is that the

1827
01:23:33,420 --> 01:23:39,580
data processing look is very short and

1828
01:23:36,610 --> 01:23:43,200
the the information remains within the

1829
01:23:39,580 --> 01:23:46,690
community but gradually also can is

1830
01:23:43,200 --> 01:23:49,690
consolidated and transmitted to the

1831
01:23:46,690 --> 01:23:51,820
government extension system also and who

1832
01:23:49,690 --> 01:23:59,800
actually prizes that data because it's

1833
01:23:51,820 --> 01:24:01,960
so it's actually very accurate wonderful

1834
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:04,090
thank you we have still about five

1835
01:24:01,960 --> 01:24:06,520
minutes to squeeze in some questions I

1836
01:24:04,090 --> 01:24:08,110
wish that we were we could keep going

1837
01:24:06,520 --> 01:24:09,580
forever or that we were all at

1838
01:24:08,110 --> 01:24:11,560
networking in person because it's been

1839
01:24:09,580 --> 01:24:13,060
so great to see the engagement that's

1840
01:24:11,560 --> 01:24:14,920
been going on in the chat box

1841
01:24:13,060 --> 01:24:16,780
some people challenging each other's

1842
01:24:14,920 --> 01:24:18,790
comments asking each other questions

1843
01:24:16,780 --> 01:24:21,070
it's really wonderful so thank you to

1844
01:24:18,790 --> 01:24:22,900
our audience you are the most important

1845
01:24:21,070 --> 01:24:26,050
part of any Agri links webinar and we

1846
01:24:22,900 --> 01:24:31,410
really appreciate your engagement before

1847
01:24:26,050 --> 01:24:33,880
we officially wrap up I think our last

1848
01:24:31,410 --> 01:24:36,220
question or two that came in closer to

1849
01:24:33,880 --> 01:24:42,640
the beginning of our presentation that I

1850
01:24:36,220 --> 01:24:46,720
think you know still proves relevant so

1851
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:49,270
a question from Ilan Gilbert perhaps

1852
01:24:46,720 --> 01:24:51,790
first director you Kristen in some

1853
01:24:49,270 --> 01:24:53,800
countries development projects seriously

1854
01:24:51,790 --> 01:24:56,560
blur the lines between public and

1855
01:24:53,800 --> 01:24:58,570
private extension with HR moving back

1856
01:24:56,560 --> 01:25:00,160
and forth which complicates the

1857
01:24:58,570 --> 01:25:07,810
institutional strengthening and

1858
01:25:00,160 --> 01:25:11,080
sustainability across the board hi yes

1859
01:25:07,810 --> 01:25:12,910
thanks for that question I was just

1860
01:25:11,080 --> 01:25:15,280
about to write the answer and I was

1861
01:25:12,910 --> 01:25:17,950
hoping you were still on but yes we we

1862
01:25:15,280 --> 01:25:20,350
have seen this as a big problem in many

1863
01:25:17,950 --> 01:25:22,750
countries where you know there's this

1864
01:25:20,350 --> 01:25:25,330
so-called poaching or so-called brain

1865
01:25:22,750 --> 01:25:28,270
drain often people moving from the

1866
01:25:25,330 --> 01:25:30,460
public sector to work for NGOs or

1867
01:25:28,270 --> 01:25:34,180
projects or the private sector and so

1868
01:25:30,460 --> 01:25:36,520
forth and I guess I would say two major

1869
01:25:34,180 --> 01:25:38,770
lessons here one is the need to

1870
01:25:36,520 --> 01:25:41,050
strengthen both simultaneously so we

1871
01:25:38,770 --> 01:25:42,970
talked a lot about strengthening public

1872
01:25:41,050 --> 01:25:45,040
and private sector the producer

1873
01:25:42,970 --> 01:25:49,180
organizations the input suppliers the

1874
01:25:45,040 --> 01:25:51,520
public people and so forth secondly this

1875
01:25:49,180 --> 01:25:53,860
is an issue of incentives and it goes

1876
01:25:51,520 --> 01:25:56,470
back to the overall professionalization

1877
01:25:53,860 --> 01:25:58,720
of extension and advisory services and I

1878
01:25:56,470 --> 01:26:00,580
think that's something many public

1879
01:25:58,720 --> 01:26:02,320
services in particular need to pay

1880
01:26:00,580 --> 01:26:05,560
attention to and we have some examples

1881
01:26:02,320 --> 01:26:08,020
from Uganda and South Africa on that

1882
01:26:05,560 --> 01:26:10,810
related to regulation certification and

1883
01:26:08,020 --> 01:26:15,250
all these things but incentives are so

1884
01:26:10,810 --> 01:26:17,800
poor for rural extension agents who work

1885
01:26:15,250 --> 01:26:21,100
for for government or you know district

1886
01:26:17,800 --> 01:26:24,990
or federal systems or whatever this this

1887
01:26:21,100 --> 01:26:24,990
needs to be looked at and improved

1888
01:26:31,860 --> 01:26:39,640
great Thank You Kristen um

1889
01:26:34,330 --> 01:26:41,950
and let's see ha ha

1890
01:26:39,640 --> 01:26:43,900
so we've had so many great questions and

1891
01:26:41,950 --> 01:26:45,570
we've been I think answering as many of

1892
01:26:43,900 --> 01:26:48,340
them as we could and we will certainly

1893
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:50,050
be sharing the chatbox transcripts with

1894
01:26:48,340 --> 01:26:52,960
the presenters after the fact in case

1895
01:26:50,050 --> 01:26:55,510
there's any opportunity to include a few

1896
01:26:52,960 --> 01:27:00,760
more questions in our post-event

1897
01:26:55,510 --> 01:27:03,670
resources and I also have a few more

1898
01:27:00,760 --> 01:27:12,430
that I will copy and paste some written

1899
01:27:03,670 --> 01:27:15,790
answers as soon as we wrap up perhaps

1900
01:27:12,430 --> 01:27:19,240
maybe the last question I know that Joe

1901
01:27:15,790 --> 01:27:20,980
Michele that you touched on gender

1902
01:27:19,240 --> 01:27:22,510
integrate integration but it's always a

1903
01:27:20,980 --> 01:27:24,100
question that comes up with Julie

1904
01:27:22,510 --> 01:27:25,990
every other links webinar people are

1905
01:27:24,100 --> 01:27:28,630
wanting more information about how to

1906
01:27:25,990 --> 01:27:31,780
integrate gender concerns into

1907
01:27:28,630 --> 01:27:34,540
programming and Lea on the kinga at the

1908
01:27:31,780 --> 01:27:36,790
beginning asked how do extension

1909
01:27:34,540 --> 01:27:40,840
advisory services ensure gender

1910
01:27:36,790 --> 01:27:42,940
integration into their program and there

1911
01:27:40,840 --> 01:27:46,120
was someone who wanted to just elaborate

1912
01:27:42,940 --> 01:27:48,850
more on what you said so perhaps you

1913
01:27:46,120 --> 01:27:53,880
could touch on a couple of important

1914
01:27:48,850 --> 01:27:55,810
gender issues before we wrap up yes okay

1915
01:27:53,880 --> 01:27:58,390
one thing I want to say that was

1916
01:27:55,810 --> 01:28:01,630
interesting is we check the age of the

1917
01:27:58,390 --> 01:28:04,660
death dates and the field agents who

1918
01:28:01,630 --> 01:28:08,680
work with data and what's interesting is

1919
01:28:04,660 --> 01:28:10,480
that men were 30 years old on average

1920
01:28:08,680 --> 01:28:13,810
and women were actually younger they

1921
01:28:10,480 --> 01:28:17,770
were 28 and also what we saw is that

1922
01:28:13,810 --> 01:28:20,640
even though in Cosimo's witness literacy

1923
01:28:17,770 --> 01:28:23,740
was very low when you look at the

1924
01:28:20,640 --> 01:28:27,430
younger generation there's like a

1925
01:28:23,740 --> 01:28:31,360
literacy surge for the you know the 10

1926
01:28:27,430 --> 01:28:34,960
to 18 year old who eventually become

1927
01:28:31,360 --> 01:28:37,390
candidates for being future field agents

1928
01:28:34,960 --> 01:28:39,700
and and hold these kind of of management

1929
01:28:37,390 --> 01:28:42,760
capacity so what I want to say is that

1930
01:28:39,700 --> 01:28:43,190
even if in I mean in the poor countries

1931
01:28:42,760 --> 01:28:45,410
that

1932
01:28:43,190 --> 01:28:48,350
the case and so I really encourage

1933
01:28:45,410 --> 01:28:52,070
projects to be poised for that for that

1934
01:28:48,350 --> 01:28:55,870
little that way of literate and trained

1935
01:28:52,070 --> 01:28:58,520
women like I said you know 10th grade is

1936
01:28:55,870 --> 01:29:00,710
accessible I mean for pretty

1937
01:28:58,520 --> 01:29:03,530
sophisticated data processing you can

1938
01:29:00,710 --> 01:29:05,510
for field agent level it can be less

1939
01:29:03,530 --> 01:29:07,190
than that and you really want to

1940
01:29:05,510 --> 01:29:08,960
integrate them in there one of the

1941
01:29:07,190 --> 01:29:12,440
elements are saying is that for Williams

1942
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,470
organization women have generally

1943
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:18,410
smaller plot sizes and are concentrated

1944
01:29:15,470 --> 01:29:21,200
in various pools of areas and and that

1945
01:29:18,410 --> 01:29:23,750
requires having a strategy that adapted

1946
01:29:21,200 --> 01:29:28,280
to that so so that because they have

1947
01:29:23,750 --> 01:29:32,210
less mobility so you can have more you

1948
01:29:28,280 --> 01:29:35,840
know responsible field agents per basin

1949
01:29:32,210 --> 01:29:39,500
and rather than having a multi Basin

1950
01:29:35,840 --> 01:29:44,300
approach so that's also another another

1951
01:29:39,500 --> 01:29:47,930
element but I also want to say that the

1952
01:29:44,300 --> 01:29:51,260
the strongest network leaders are

1953
01:29:47,930 --> 01:29:53,990
generally women it's in the top

1954
01:29:51,260 --> 01:29:56,720
management posts that's been our

1955
01:29:53,990 --> 01:29:59,720
experience and that's why you really

1956
01:29:56,720 --> 01:30:02,990
want to promote that that integration

1957
01:29:59,720 --> 01:30:05,270
and all that I think another domain that

1958
01:30:02,990 --> 01:30:08,240
can be very strong in bringing women

1959
01:30:05,270 --> 01:30:11,240
into those extension system is that

1960
01:30:08,240 --> 01:30:14,690
those networks want to co-op young

1961
01:30:11,240 --> 01:30:16,820
people and and very often like women's

1962
01:30:14,690 --> 01:30:18,260
group will co-op young women I mean you

1963
01:30:16,820 --> 01:30:20,900
want to make sure that that happens

1964
01:30:18,260 --> 01:30:23,630
what's important is is really to promote

1965
01:30:20,900 --> 01:30:26,120
that integration throughout the program

1966
01:30:23,630 --> 01:30:28,340
and that's where projects have a role to

1967
01:30:26,120 --> 01:30:34,100
play but once they've been in the system

1968
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:36,800
for a few for a few cycles the women

1969
01:30:34,100 --> 01:30:38,330
then develop entrepreneurial programs

1970
01:30:36,800 --> 01:30:40,820
and a bit like what Robert was

1971
01:30:38,330 --> 01:30:43,880
describing you know some of them migrate

1972
01:30:40,820 --> 01:30:46,250
and and can become village agents

1973
01:30:43,880 --> 01:30:51,320
connected with banks with insurance

1974
01:30:46,250 --> 01:30:53,120
companies with input distributors a bit

1975
01:30:51,320 --> 01:30:53,920
like that I mean the networks are are

1976
01:30:53,120 --> 01:30:55,720
kind of

1977
01:30:53,920 --> 01:30:58,570
but they're also a ready market for

1978
01:30:55,720 --> 01:31:00,580
those entrepreneurial businesses for

1979
01:30:58,570 --> 01:31:02,200
youth and women are very good in that I

1980
01:31:00,580 --> 01:31:04,930
just want to say that the young woman

1981
01:31:02,200 --> 01:31:07,960
you saw in the slide I presented is now

1982
01:31:04,930 --> 01:31:10,980
as graduated from being a database

1983
01:31:07,960 --> 01:31:14,080
manager for a write company and is now

1984
01:31:10,980 --> 01:31:16,870
created her own company as a write

1985
01:31:14,080 --> 01:31:22,980
aggregator she she actually owns a car

1986
01:31:16,870 --> 01:31:25,690
now wonderful thank you John Michelle

1987
01:31:22,980 --> 01:31:27,010
all right we are 2 minutes past the hour

1988
01:31:25,690 --> 01:31:29,350
so we're going to go ahead and

1989
01:31:27,010 --> 01:31:31,060
