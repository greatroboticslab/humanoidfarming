1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
hey everyone did you just buy your first

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:04,560
tractor and are unsure what implements

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:06,240
to buy

4
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,240
stay tuned with us here at the clinch

5
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,760
river homestead because we're going to

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,400
talk about the top three

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:12,960
implements that you must have for your

8
00:00:12,400 --> 00:00:14,920
farm

9
00:00:12,960 --> 00:00:30,580
or homestead or your new tractor

10
00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:37,360
purchase roll it

11
00:00:30,580 --> 00:00:40,399
[Music]

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,800
okay so i think the very first implement

13
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,340
that we must talk about

14
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:47,920
is right here

15
00:00:45,340 --> 00:00:49,840
[Music]

16
00:00:47,920 --> 00:00:52,480
so this implement called a brush hog or

17
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:54,719
bush hog it's made by titan implements i

18
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:57,840
think it's their medium duty model

19
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
and it's a six foot brush hog i think

20
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:00,160
this is

21
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:01,280
probably the number one implement that

22
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:02,239
you're going to want to have for your

23
00:01:01,280 --> 00:01:03,520
homestead

24
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,879
if you're enjoying the content you're

25
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:05,280
watching today and would love to see

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:07,119
more

00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,119
hit that subscribe button and tick that

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:11,119
little bell you'll get notified on all

29
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,920
of our videos just like this

30
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:15,280
because every homestead has grass demo

31
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:18,159
and every homestead

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,439
has brush to clear and it's an ongoing

33
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:21,680
process so i think

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,200
this right here is your top one

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:27,360
must-have

36
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:30,560
number two

37
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:31,040
so the second must-have implement that i

38
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
think

39
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:35,040
every new tractor owner should have is

40
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,439
this beauty right here

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,400
here's a six-foot titan implements box

42
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,759
blade

43
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:44,479
it has a just as the term

44
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:46,479
refers it has a blade right in the back

45
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:49,280
of this thing here so that you can

46
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,320
scrape up the ground it also has rippers

47
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,920
on the front here

48
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:53,680
so that you can really dig into that

49
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,399
ground the other cool thing with the box

50
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,560
blade

51
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
you could use it as a reverse front end

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,079
loader so

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
not only can you pull with a box blade

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,040
but you can push

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,479
on the other end on the back side

56
00:02:03,040 --> 00:02:05,600
because there's a blade on the back of

57
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
this too

58
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,679
it's amazing what you can accomplish

59
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,160
with a box blade

60
00:02:09,679 --> 00:02:14,800
so if you have a lot of gravel if you

61
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,720
have a lot of dirt roads

62
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:18,640
or if you just have areas that you need

63
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:19,360
to clear on your property to make paths

64
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:21,360
with

65
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,280
this is probably going to be your number

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
one implement for that

67
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:26,879
so i think this qualifies as your number

68
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,440
two

69
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:30,480
implement that is a must-have on your

70
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,599
homestead

71
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:37,840
just the versatility that this thing has

72
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,840
so let's move on to number three

73
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:44,319
so the number three top implement that

74
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,280
you must have

75
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:49,200
for your homestead or farm now a lot of

76
00:02:47,280 --> 00:02:51,280
people are going to say wait a minute

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
pallet forks what in the world am i

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,720
going to do with pallet forks well let

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,959
me tell you something

80
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,319
that thing right behind me there that's

81
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:00,879
a grapple

82
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
pallet forks can do a lot of the same

83
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:03,840
work

84
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
that you can do with a grapple if you

85
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:08,319
need to pick up

86
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:10,319
logs if you're picking up brush

87
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:11,760
heck if you got to pick up big bales of

88
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,879
hay

89
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:15,599
pallet forks can do it if you need to

90
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,560
move

91
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:19,360
a trailer or something with a hitch on

92
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:21,840
it

93
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:23,760
you can put a ball on the front fork and

94
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:26,159
use the front end of your tractor

95
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:27,200
to move that implement around or that

96
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:29,280
trailer around

97
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,720
the other thing that these pallet forks

98
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:32,319
are really awesome

99
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,080
is they're adjustable and most of your

100
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,480
pallet forks are adjustable

101
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,680
so you can move these in or out

102
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:39,920
depending on

103
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:40,879
what you need to use it for so this

104
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,239
right here

105
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:46,720
is a titan implement pallet fork

106
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,360
my top three must-have for your farm

107
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:51,519
homestead or your new tractor purchase
