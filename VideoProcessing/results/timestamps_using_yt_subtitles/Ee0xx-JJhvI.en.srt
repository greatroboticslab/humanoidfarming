00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,640
what are your thoughts on sustainability

2
00:00:02,360 --> 00:00:06,240
and this kind of sustainability movement

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:08,760
in agriculture how would you kind of

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,200
frame that up well that's a great

5
00:00:08,760 --> 00:00:13,280
question because I'm also uh on the

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:15,000
Texas peanut producers board and I'm on

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:18,279
a couple of committees that do

8
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:20,800
sustainability now so it's so creative

9
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,560
where A's been you know we used to do

10
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,279
all chemical fertilizers and even on my

11
00:00:23,560 --> 00:00:29,039
operation now we do a lot of manure or

12
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:31,119
compost my son actually does a lot of

13
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:33,920
compost where we don't do any kind of

14
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,120
natural fertilizer so we've spread 3 to

15
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:38,320
four tons on our peanuts which that's a

16
00:00:36,120 --> 00:00:40,399
sustainability issue is chemical

17
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,920
fertilizers you know and we use them on

18
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,840
our Organics down here also you know our

19
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:45,840
