00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,600
[Music]

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:05,200
stockpiling tall fescue for winter

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:07,919
grazing is definitely the most

4
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:10,080
economical feeding strategy for cow calf

5
00:00:07,919 --> 00:00:11,440
operations in kentucky but we're always

6
00:00:10,080 --> 00:00:12,880
going to need a little bit of hay in our

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:14,799
feeding operation

8
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:16,800
and it's important to understand the

9
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:18,240
quality of the hay that you're feeding

10
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,400
when you understand the quality of the

11
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:21,760
hay you're feeding you can supplement

12
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,519
that hay so that you don't lose

13
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:25,519
condition on your cows

14
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,720
now when we sample hay we need to sample

15
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:30,080
it by a lot

16
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:33,040
and a lot is one field

17
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,160
and one harvest of hay so say for

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,960
example

19
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:38,239
field a cutting first cutting would be

20
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,160
one lot of hay

21
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:42,160
that needs to be sampled separately from

22
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:44,160
say the second cutting from that field

23
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,840
or the third cutting from that field or

24
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,360
the first cutting from another field so

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,559
we sample by the lot

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,760
that's really important and the second

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:53,600
thing that's really important is that we

28
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,160
get a good sample and we do that by

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:57,120
using

30
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:58,879
a coring tool so we don't want to just

31
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,239
take a piece of hand pull it out of the

32
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:02,000
sample and send it in for

33
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,600
pull it out of the bale and send it in

34
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,840
for analysis

35
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:07,680
we want to actually take a bale core and

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:08,960
when we sample a lot we'd like to get

37
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,159
somewhere between

38
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:14,400
15 and 20 cores per halot

39
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,360
and then we composite those samples

40
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,920
together

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,759
mix them up and send the whole sample in

42
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:21,200
for analysis and i'll show you why we

43
00:01:19,759 --> 00:01:24,720
want to send the whole sample in

44
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:26,240
in a minute after we core a few bales

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
so it's important when we're sampling

46
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:29,520
hay that we use a probe to sample the

47
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:31,360
hay with

48
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:32,880
for round bales we want to sample hay

49
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
from the side

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,799
and for rectangular bales large square

51
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,759
barrels or small square bells we want to

52
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,680
sample the bales from the end

53
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:43,119
and again we want to get 20 cores per

54
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:45,200
lot

55
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,799
and then submit all those cores to the

56
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:55,200
lab and do not separate them

57
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:56,799
into a smaller size sample

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,399
one of the important things to remember

59
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:00,240
when we take a heat sample is that we

60
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,360
want to submit the whole sample so never

61
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,719
subdivide it

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,240
you want the lab to grind the whole

63
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:05,520
sample and the reason why is if you look

64
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,280
at the bottom there's lots of little

65
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:09,360
fine material at the bottom

66
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:11,120
when we separate it we often grab just

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,000
this coarse material and that really

68
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,280
changes the

69
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,800
quality analysis of this forage so it's

70
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,360
important to submit the whole sample and

71
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:21,200
let them grind it into a homogenous

72
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
size and then they can subdivide it at

73
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,120
the lab

74
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,319
all right so once we get the sample

75
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:28,959
taken out in the field

76
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:30,879
it will come into the lab and then we

77
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:32,879
will dry the sample overnight

78
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,480
so the procedure for doing that is that

79
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:36,480
we take the sample from

80
00:02:34,480 --> 00:02:40,959
our our bag from the field and we

81
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,959
transfer preferred into a paper sack

82
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,640
and we want to make sure we get the

83
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:47,599
whole sample in there

84
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:50,640
and that we don't miss any of the fine

85
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:53,760
material in the bottom of the bag okay

86
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:55,360
once we get the sample in here

87
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,280
we'll weigh it on the scale and we'll

88
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,640
record what we call the fresh weight on

89
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:02,660
the bag

90
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,840
so this sample weighs 49.9 grams

91
00:03:02,660 --> 00:03:07,440
[Applause]

92
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,159
we'll just write that right on our bag

93
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,920
okay once we get the sample weighed

94
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,920
we'll place that sample in the dryer

95
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,440
overnight the dryer is set to around 55

96
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:24,159
degrees celsius which would be the

97
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:26,239
equivalent of about 130 degrees

98
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,560
and we'll dry it overnight now drive any

99
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,640
remaining moisture in that sample off

100
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,319
and we'll be able to determine the

101
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:33,360
driveway of the sample the reason that

102
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:36,319
we need the

103
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:38,159
dry matter on the sample is that all the

104
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:39,440
rations are balanced on the dry matter

105
00:03:38,159 --> 00:03:41,280
basis

106
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,480
all right it's been overnight and we're

107
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,239
getting the sample out again and we're

108
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,840
going to re-weigh it to determine the

109
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:47,840
dry matter

110
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:51,440
all right so once we get the dry weight

111
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,799
on this we'll copy the dryer weight down

112
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,799
and record it on our data sheet

113
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:58,080
all right now we're going to head up to

114
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,920
the grinding uh facility and we're going

115
00:03:58,080 --> 00:04:01,920
to grind this sample to get it ready for

116
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,439
forage quality analysis

117
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:04,959
all right so we've got our sample that

118
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:08,319
we've dried overnight

119
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:10,720
in the lab and we're ready to grind it

120
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:12,720
at this point in time so we use a two

121
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:14,560
stage grinding process we grind through

122
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:15,599
a wiley mill through a two millimeter

123
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,440
screen first

124
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,519
and then we'll grind through a second

125
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:22,720
grinder called a ud

126
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:29,600
cyclone sample mill for our second stage

127
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:32,560
of grinding

128
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:35,840
i'm going to open this up any things

129
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:35,840
that are left we'll put in this

130
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,440
okay and then we'll undo this sample

131
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:44,240
collection bottle

132
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:48,160
and just dump that in there and now we

133
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:50,160
have a pretty homogeneous sample

134
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,360
so instead of having a lot of large

135
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:53,840
particles and small

136
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,160
particles it's pretty much all two

137
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,320
millimeters or less

138
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,639
okay so we're now going to grind through

139
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:03,120
a ud cyclum sample mill

140
00:05:00,639 --> 00:05:05,520
and this is the second grinder this has

141
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:08,720
a one millimeter screen in it

142
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:08,720
so we're going to go ahead and turn this

143
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:11,840
on

144
00:05:12,530 --> 00:05:17,950
[Music]

145
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:27,919
so we've ground it through the ud cyclum

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:30,000
sample mill now we're going to transfer

147
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,360
that ground sample which is very fine

148
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,039
almost like a powder now

149
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:36,880
into our sample bag okay the goal of the

150
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,960
grinding process is to go from a

151
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,960
heterogeneous sample so a sample with

152
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:43,680
large and small pieces in it

153
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:45,440
to a very homogeneous sample and that's

154
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,520
what we've done here you can see that

155
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:50,160
all the particles are now about the same

156
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,560
size and here less than one millimeter

157
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,120
all right so we started with a hay bale

158
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,319
and we used a hayprobe to get a cord

159
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:59,280
sample

160
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,160
we took that cord sample into the lab we

161
00:05:59,280 --> 00:06:02,479
weighed it

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,400
dried it and re-weighed it and then we

163
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:06,240
went up to our grinding facility and we

164
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,759
ground that sample through a two-stage

165
00:06:06,240 --> 00:06:10,000
grinding process

166
00:06:07,759 --> 00:06:11,199
and we ended up with this which is

167
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:13,840
essentially the hay

168
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:15,520
but in a powder form now we're ready to

169
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,680
analyze this hay for

170
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:19,199
forage quality and we're going to use a

171
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:20,800
technique called near-infrared

172
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:23,199
spectroscopy

173
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
and what we do is we take a cell we call

174
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,880
these ring cups

175
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:34,160
it has a quartz glass in the bottom and

176
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:36,720
we dump that sample into this cell then

177
00:06:34,160 --> 00:06:40,639
we put a foam back in there just to hold

178
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,639
that forged tight against the glass

179
00:06:45,280 --> 00:06:49,039
and we just brush the excess forged dust

180
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
off of there

181
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,639
and we're ready to take this to the near

182
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,599
furred spectrophotometer

183
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:57,680
and analyze it all right about 80

184
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,599
percent of the samples that are analyzed

185
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,599
for forage quality in the united states

186
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,759
are analyzed using a technology called

187
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,840
near infrared spectroscopy

188
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:07,680
and essentially what the near infrared

189
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:10,720
spectrophotometer does is it

190
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:12,240
takes light and it shines light in the

191
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,479
near infrared spectrum

192
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:16,800
onto the sample and then it measures

193
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,720
what gets reflected back

194
00:07:16,800 --> 00:07:19,840
and then we can correlate what gets

195
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,479
reflected back

196
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,759
to different forage quality parameters

197
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,160
very precisely

198
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,840
for example crude protein acid detergent

199
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,240
fiber neutral detergent fiber

200
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,000
digestibility and so forth so

201
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:34,240
right now we're ready to analyze this

202
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,280
sample so we're going to go ahead and

203
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,240
put the sample

204
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:38,240
into the machine

205
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:45,840
and then we'll come up here and hit scan

206
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:51,520
so now we have the sample scanned we

207
00:07:49,759 --> 00:07:52,160
need to go in and predict that sample

208
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:54,400
using a

209
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:55,599
an equation that's maintained by the

210
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,680
near infrared

211
00:07:55,599 --> 00:08:00,240
spectroscopy consortium so it's an

212
00:07:57,680 --> 00:08:03,280
equation that's based on wet chemistry

213
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,960
and then reference back to the near

214
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:07,039
infrared spectrum

215
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:08,479
so these are the results so in this file

216
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,680
we have 12 samples the

217
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,639
the 13 samples the 13 sample is a sample

218
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:14,639
that we just scanned

219
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,160
and each one of these windows is

220
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,720
different this is dry matter

221
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:23,360
we've got 91 almost 92 percent dry

222
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,680
matter in this particular sample

223
00:08:23,360 --> 00:08:27,759
we can go down to crude protein we've

224
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,680
got about 11 and a half percent crude

225
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,440
protein in this sample

226
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,279
and we have a whole bunch of different

227
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:34,640
constituents on this list that we can

228
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:40,479
look at

229
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:43,599
and find out their digestibility or um

230
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,720
or fiber content now we've got our

231
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:46,399
sample taken

232
00:08:44,720 --> 00:08:48,000
and we send it into the lab and we got

233
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:50,560
our results back

234
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:52,240
now the hay sampling is really worthless

235
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,000
unless we actually do something with

236
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,560
those results so what we want to do

237
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:59,279
is we want to use those results to help

238
00:08:56,560 --> 00:09:01,519
us manage our hay feeding program

239
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,360
and so what we get back we'll get an

240
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:05,040
estimate of energy and an estimate of

241
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,959
crude protein and then a dry matter

242
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:09,519
value for each one of those samples

243
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,040
and we can take that information and put

244
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:15,120
it into what we call

245
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:18,720
the uk cow forage supplement tool

246
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:20,959
and what this is is is a way that we can

247
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,880
figure out how much of a supplement we

248
00:09:20,959 --> 00:09:24,800
may or may not need to feed with that

249
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:26,880
particular lot of hay

250
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:29,279
so what to use this we need the dry

251
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:31,120
matter of the hay

252
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:33,200
we need the crude protein value the

253
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:34,800
neutral detergent fiber

254
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:36,959
that's an estimate of how much of that

255
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:38,560
hay the animal can actually eat

256
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:40,399
and then we need an estimate of the

257
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:41,680
energy and that's total digestible

258
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:44,640
nutrients

259
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:46,240
and those will all be on your your hay

260
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:48,800
results when you get it back from the

261
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:50,160
forged testing lab

262
00:09:48,800 --> 00:09:52,000
and then the last thing we need to know

263
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,640
is a stage of production of the of the

264
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:54,800
cow

265
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:56,399
is she lactating with a calf or is she

266
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,320
dry

267
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,160
if we have that information we can put

268
00:09:58,320 --> 00:10:02,640
that into the supplement tool which is

269
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:04,160
available online

270
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:05,519
or you can go to your extension office

271
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:06,160
and your extension agent can help you

272
00:10:05,519 --> 00:10:08,640
with it

273
00:10:06,160 --> 00:10:10,959
and i've got a couple examples here so

274
00:10:08,640 --> 00:10:15,120
in this particular example

275
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:17,760
we've got a hay lot that has 8.6

276
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,959
crude protein that's a pretty pretty low

277
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,600
crude protein

278
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:24,800
and it's got an energy value or a tdn

279
00:10:21,600 --> 00:10:26,399
value of 53 so that's pretty low also

280
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:28,480
so this is definitely going to need some

281
00:10:26,399 --> 00:10:32,560
supplement when we put this information

282
00:10:28,480 --> 00:10:35,360
in our hay supplementation tool

283
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:37,040
it spits out a a number of different

284
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,680
supplements and how much of each one of

285
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:42,160
those supplements we would need to feed

286
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,519
to meet the requirements of a lactating

287
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:45,839
brood cow

288
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:48,240
so for example uh if we were going to

289
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:50,880
feed soybean hulls we'd have to feed

290
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:53,839
the hay as much as it could eat plus

291
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:55,680
10.6 pounds of soybean holes per day for

292
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,519
this particular hay lot

293
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:00,880
now keep in mind this hay was a pretty

294
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,720
low low quality hay

295
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,800
the second halo i just wanted to mention

296
00:11:02,720 --> 00:11:05,360
to you was was a much higher quality hay

297
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:08,079
lot

298
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:09,920
we had a crude protein concentration of

299
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:11,440
over 12 percent

300
00:11:09,920 --> 00:11:13,760
which should meet the crude protein

301
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:16,800
requirements of a lactating brew cow

302
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:20,320
and then we had an energy or a tdn value

303
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,240
of around 58.7 per percent

304
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,760
uh the requirement would be around 60

305
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:25,760
percent for a lactating brood capsule

306
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,920
just a little bit low in energy

307
00:11:25,760 --> 00:11:29,040
and as a result of the higher hay

308
00:11:27,920 --> 00:11:31,920
quality

309
00:11:29,040 --> 00:11:33,200
instead of having to feed 10.6 pounds of

310
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,760
soybean holes

311
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:37,200
we would only need to feed around two

312
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:39,040
pounds of soybean holes for this

313
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:41,360
particular lot of hay

314
00:11:39,040 --> 00:11:49,920
to keep to supply the nutrients that a

315
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:49,920
lactating brew cow needs
