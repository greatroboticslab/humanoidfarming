1
00:00:00,979 --> 00:00:07,610
once again thanks for thanks for

2
00:00:03,330 --> 00:00:09,840
inviting me it's it's fun to be here I

3
00:00:07,610 --> 00:00:13,410
did spend i am at Oregon State

4
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:16,740
University now and but I spent 18 years

5
00:00:13,410 --> 00:00:20,070
at Montana State University so I kind of

6
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,960
know the the the Northern Plains and had

7
00:00:20,070 --> 00:00:26,660
a lot of exposure to some of the animal

8
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:30,660
agriculture out there so my my talk is

9
00:00:26,660 --> 00:00:32,940
adopting policies and priorities that

10
00:00:30,660 --> 00:00:36,180
might help encourage some of these these

11
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:38,700
activities that we'd like to see and I

12
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,680
guess one other observation that I had

13
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:45,180
is you know just walking outside in the

14
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:47,160
in the lobby in the 10 years that I've

15
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,219
been or 12 years or more than I've been

16
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,350
seriously doing climate change there's

17
00:00:50,219 --> 00:00:56,309
been a sea change in terms of what's

18
00:00:52,350 --> 00:00:57,989
happening in terms of people not yet not

19
00:00:56,309 --> 00:01:00,030
embracing as much as but seeing the

20
00:00:57,989 --> 00:01:01,590
economic opportunities associated with

21
00:01:00,030 --> 00:01:03,390
some of these changes and that's a

22
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:06,479
really good thing it's going to you know

23
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:10,170
15 20 years ago I was doing climate

24
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:14,040
change research in Montana and a group

25
00:01:10,170 --> 00:01:16,710
of growers gave us a t-shirt and the

26
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,479
t-shirt said Montanans for climate

27
00:01:16,710 --> 00:01:20,580
change and it showed people shivering

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,250
and things like that and so it was a it

29
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,200
was a very different environment that it

30
00:01:23,250 --> 00:01:27,240
will question why we do in climate

31
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:30,150
change and I think that has been a

32
00:01:27,240 --> 00:01:31,159
really kind of a theme going on here is

33
00:01:30,150 --> 00:01:33,180
that you know there's winners and losers

34
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,650
there's some people that will benefit

35
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,750
from this and I think what we need to do

36
00:01:34,650 --> 00:01:38,880
as a whole is to is to try to design

37
00:01:36,750 --> 00:01:40,950
policies that are also climate smart

38
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:44,310
policies and that will speak to the

39
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,979
benefits of doing both of those ok so

40
00:01:44,310 --> 00:01:48,630
the themes I want to talk about once

41
00:01:46,979 --> 00:01:50,700
again I will probably not spend a lot of

42
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:52,890
time on this but just what do we mean by

43
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:56,189
this climate smart agriculture concept

44
00:01:52,890 --> 00:01:58,049
some of the policies and goals and how

45
00:01:56,189 --> 00:02:00,479
do we get there and once again

46
00:01:58,049 --> 00:02:01,799
integrating economics as we've heard in

47
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:04,229
many of the presentations this morning

48
00:02:01,799 --> 00:02:06,180
is really critical it's got to be

49
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,060
economically viable economically

50
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:11,069
sustainable or you know then it's just

51
00:02:09,060 --> 00:02:11,850
an exercise if not and so we really need

52
00:02:11,069 --> 00:02:15,600
to pay attention

53
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:17,910
to that background of course science has

54
00:02:15,600 --> 00:02:20,850
always led to better policy we'd like to

55
00:02:17,910 --> 00:02:23,640
see it lead to better policy faster but

56
00:02:20,850 --> 00:02:26,220
I think that's been the history of this

57
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:27,870
integrated research but the details are

58
00:02:26,220 --> 00:02:30,420
important as I said we need to know how

59
00:02:27,870 --> 00:02:32,430
do we integrate across the sciences and

60
00:02:30,420 --> 00:02:34,830
there's been like I said a lot of work

61
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:39,750
in the economics area that I'm involved

62
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:41,640
in on efficiency as well as other values

63
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,480
that we that we care about poverty

64
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:48,000
vulnerability natural capital ecosystems

65
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,830
and so we can just move a little bit

66
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,900
from that okay so climate smart

67
00:02:49,830 --> 00:02:55,740
agriculture is kind of a very recent

68
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:58,230
term it's been defined by FAO in 2010

69
00:02:55,740 --> 00:03:00,710
and it's composed of basically three

70
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:03,420
pillars there one is to increase

71
00:03:00,710 --> 00:03:05,450
sustainability sustainably increased

72
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:09,750
production productivity and incomes

73
00:03:05,450 --> 00:03:11,520
adopt and build resilience and then deal

74
00:03:09,750 --> 00:03:13,670
with the greenhouse gas emissions

75
00:03:11,520 --> 00:03:16,200
wherever possible and I think this was a

76
00:03:13,670 --> 00:03:18,150
form of yours too we're looking for that

77
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,860
sweet spot that we can and hopefully

78
00:03:18,150 --> 00:03:21,660
it's a little bit bigger than the red

79
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,660
one that you showed I'd like to see that

80
00:03:21,660 --> 00:03:25,980
being expanded so why is it needed we

81
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:28,020
heard this from the earlier

82
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:29,970
presentations as well is that we're

83
00:03:28,020 --> 00:03:32,790
going to have to feed a larger

84
00:03:29,970 --> 00:03:34,230
population we've got climate change

85
00:03:32,790 --> 00:03:36,390
happening and that can lead to

86
00:03:34,230 --> 00:03:39,720
reductions in many cases and lower

87
00:03:36,390 --> 00:03:41,790
incomes in very vulnerable areas and so

88
00:03:39,720 --> 00:03:44,310
a lot of the CSA climate smart

89
00:03:41,790 --> 00:03:46,920
agriculture was very concerned not just

90
00:03:44,310 --> 00:03:48,840
with the US but with what's happening in

91
00:03:46,920 --> 00:03:52,350
developing countries and people that are

92
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:56,160
pretty much living on the margin and

93
00:03:52,350 --> 00:03:58,290
once again in 2005 agriculture did

94
00:03:56,160 --> 00:04:02,940
account for about 13 and a half percent

95
00:03:58,290 --> 00:04:06,180
of the GHG emissions so the approach

96
00:04:02,940 --> 00:04:09,510
then for the climate smart agriculture

97
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:13,860
is basically coordinated efforts toward

98
00:04:09,510 --> 00:04:15,690
these resilient pathways but we got to

99
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:17,489
do that in the following way we've got

100
00:04:15,690 --> 00:04:19,799
to build this evidence which i think is

101
00:04:17,489 --> 00:04:21,630
what Megan it was just great to see your

102
00:04:19,799 --> 00:04:22,919
study and see some of the other studies

103
00:04:21,630 --> 00:04:24,770
that have been out here in terms of

104
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:27,259
building evidence

105
00:04:24,770 --> 00:04:29,840
identifying viable options and tools

106
00:04:27,259 --> 00:04:32,449
that will assess these different

107
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:34,879
technologies and then also as we all

108
00:04:32,449 --> 00:04:37,879
know you've got to increase the local

109
00:04:34,879 --> 00:04:39,639
institutional effectiveness we've got a

110
00:04:37,879 --> 00:04:43,370
force to some kind of coherence between

111
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:45,500
climate energy and AG policies and then

112
00:04:43,370 --> 00:04:47,840
we've got a link on climate and

113
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:51,169
agricultural financing this is

114
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:53,449
incredibly important at the end it's not

115
00:04:51,169 --> 00:04:57,409
a new approach it's been around under

116
00:04:53,449 --> 00:04:59,389
different names there's a short history

117
00:04:57,409 --> 00:05:01,819
there like I said it really has been in

118
00:04:59,389 --> 00:05:04,699
the last five years that it's been kind

119
00:05:01,819 --> 00:05:08,150
of recast as this climate smart egg as

120
00:05:04,699 --> 00:05:10,490
opposed to just dealing with the

121
00:05:08,150 --> 00:05:14,449
changing climate or wood sustainability

122
00:05:10,490 --> 00:05:17,569
and resilience it's this is kind of a

123
00:05:14,449 --> 00:05:20,409
nice schematic here it shows that it

124
00:05:17,569 --> 00:05:22,699
builds on what was first referred to as

125
00:05:20,409 --> 00:05:25,490
sustainable development poverty

126
00:05:22,699 --> 00:05:27,919
reduction environmental risk and then

127
00:05:25,490 --> 00:05:29,840
it's also come under the little more

128
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,819
encompassing name of a green economy

129
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,430
where we're looking at carbon emission

130
00:05:31,819 --> 00:05:37,340
reductions resource use efficiency

131
00:05:34,430 --> 00:05:39,349
enhancements and now today's version is

132
00:05:37,340 --> 00:05:40,940
more of a climate smart agriculture and

133
00:05:39,349 --> 00:05:42,919
I think that's because of two concerns

134
00:05:40,940 --> 00:05:47,240
one is not just dealing with the

135
00:05:42,919 --> 00:05:49,099
environmental concerns and sustainable

136
00:05:47,240 --> 00:05:52,729
development concerns but also this issue

137
00:05:49,099 --> 00:05:55,219
with food security and agricultural

138
00:05:52,729 --> 00:05:57,169
production improvement so looking at a

139
00:05:55,219 --> 00:05:59,990
little bit broader and putting all of

140
00:05:57,169 --> 00:06:01,909
all the pieces together here so there's

141
00:05:59,990 --> 00:06:05,750
been this kind of a schematic that's not

142
00:06:01,909 --> 00:06:10,279
mine I borrowed it from John beddington

143
00:06:05,750 --> 00:06:13,669
in the this schematic really talks about

144
00:06:10,279 --> 00:06:17,090
these goals of climate smart agriculture

145
00:06:13,669 --> 00:06:19,009
in terms of a safe operating space and

146
00:06:17,090 --> 00:06:23,930
the safe operating space really is from

147
00:06:19,009 --> 00:06:26,300
a very you know high level view is we

148
00:06:23,930 --> 00:06:28,669
want to sort of increase that sweet spot

149
00:06:26,300 --> 00:06:31,069
or that safe operating space in there

150
00:06:28,669 --> 00:06:33,380
such that the bigger it is the more

151
00:06:31,069 --> 00:06:36,979
resilient we as a planet we as a society

152
00:06:33,380 --> 00:06:37,880
will be in terms of being able to adopt

153
00:06:36,979 --> 00:06:40,700
to

154
00:06:37,880 --> 00:06:43,040
more changes going on and things like

155
00:06:40,700 --> 00:06:45,380
that so if if that sweet space and that

156
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:48,500
safe space is really the space that's

157
00:06:45,380 --> 00:06:50,720
sustainable is very small then we're

158
00:06:48,500 --> 00:06:53,510
kind of pretty fragile in terms of some

159
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:56,870
of the some of the things we have so

160
00:06:53,510 --> 00:06:59,900
those three lines there the orange lines

161
00:06:56,870 --> 00:07:02,060
are basically represent some

162
00:06:59,900 --> 00:07:04,550
relationship between food production and

163
00:07:02,060 --> 00:07:07,670
climate change so the climate change due

164
00:07:04,550 --> 00:07:10,850
to the food system means that as we get

165
00:07:07,670 --> 00:07:12,380
more climate change happening oh I'm

166
00:07:10,850 --> 00:07:15,040
sorry as we get more food production

167
00:07:12,380 --> 00:07:16,910
occurring under the existing

168
00:07:15,040 --> 00:07:18,740
technologies we're going to see more

169
00:07:16,910 --> 00:07:22,010
climate change or more greenhouse gas

170
00:07:18,740 --> 00:07:23,840
emissions occurring the the global food

171
00:07:22,010 --> 00:07:28,520
needs one is a graph that just

172
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:31,580
represents our food needs in a temporal

173
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,740
sense as population increases and then

174
00:07:31,580 --> 00:07:35,660
finally the maximum food production is

175
00:07:33,740 --> 00:07:38,240
just is trade-off between food

176
00:07:35,660 --> 00:07:40,580
production and climate change so we can

177
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,500
play around with those graphs and so

178
00:07:40,580 --> 00:07:46,310
what we can look at here is that if we

179
00:07:42,500 --> 00:07:49,430
want to look at the global food needs

180
00:07:46,310 --> 00:07:54,290
under a changing climate what we can

181
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:56,900
oops what's happening here okay right so

182
00:07:54,290 --> 00:08:00,920
what we're looking at is policies that

183
00:07:56,900 --> 00:08:04,220
might try to shift that curve down such

184
00:08:00,920 --> 00:08:06,710
that we are increasing the safe space by

185
00:08:04,220 --> 00:08:08,090
looking at new global food needs and

186
00:08:06,710 --> 00:08:09,560
what would some of those be kind of

187
00:08:08,090 --> 00:08:12,140
eliminating the waste in the food chain

188
00:08:09,560 --> 00:08:14,750
being able to make better use of the

189
00:08:12,140 --> 00:08:18,280
food that we have okay so for any given

190
00:08:14,750 --> 00:08:22,190
climate at any given climate or whether

191
00:08:18,280 --> 00:08:25,970
point in time we can actually the food

192
00:08:22,190 --> 00:08:29,000
needs from the primary production would

193
00:08:25,970 --> 00:08:31,790
be reduced because we're having less

194
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:34,729
waste going on if we're looking at how

195
00:08:31,790 --> 00:08:39,200
to improve maximum food production we'd

196
00:08:34,729 --> 00:08:41,900
be shifting this other graph that's a

197
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:44,300
little slow on the uptake here and so

198
00:08:41,900 --> 00:08:46,280
improving maximum food production would

199
00:08:44,300 --> 00:08:50,150
be looking at policies that would be

200
00:08:46,280 --> 00:08:51,680
shifting that curve out and those

201
00:08:50,150 --> 00:08:54,290
policies would be things

202
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:56,270
drought management adaptive grazing

203
00:08:54,290 --> 00:08:58,820
methods perhaps for agriculture

204
00:08:56,270 --> 00:09:01,940
livestock and maybe matching livestock

205
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:04,220
intensities to the environment and then

206
00:09:01,940 --> 00:09:07,670
finally the third graph is how to

207
00:09:04,220 --> 00:09:09,320
mitigate climate change from agriculture

208
00:09:07,670 --> 00:09:12,140
and in this case we'd want to increase

209
00:09:09,320 --> 00:09:16,459
that safe space by actually trying to

210
00:09:12,140 --> 00:09:18,589
think of it as shifting the the climate

211
00:09:16,459 --> 00:09:20,450
change due to the food system graph back

212
00:09:18,589 --> 00:09:23,630
and that would be things like mitigation

213
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:26,810
policies and stuff increase on-site

214
00:09:23,630 --> 00:09:29,899
greenhouse gas decrease the on-site

215
00:09:26,810 --> 00:09:34,970
greenhouse gas emissions capture co2 etc

216
00:09:29,899 --> 00:09:37,790
so that's kind of how this this graph

217
00:09:34,970 --> 00:09:40,040
has been used so what is the u.s. doing

218
00:09:37,790 --> 00:09:43,820
to enhance climate smart agriculture

219
00:09:40,040 --> 00:09:45,920
well as as be said and we've got these

220
00:09:43,820 --> 00:09:49,070
climate hubs there's a lot of activities

221
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:51,500
going on that really are in the that

222
00:09:49,070 --> 00:09:55,910
fall under this umbrella of the climate

223
00:09:51,500 --> 00:09:58,430
hubs we've got global research alliances

224
00:09:55,910 --> 00:10:00,200
feed the future climate clean air and

225
00:09:58,430 --> 00:10:05,839
then the u.s. global climate change

226
00:10:00,200 --> 00:10:08,000
initiative these are all pieces really

227
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:10,490
important pieces of what's happening in

228
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:14,930
the policy avena to promote a more

229
00:10:10,490 --> 00:10:17,930
sustainable climate smart agriculture so

230
00:10:14,930 --> 00:10:21,800
this alliance has been the most recent

231
00:10:17,930 --> 00:10:24,200
of these lists of global efforts and

232
00:10:21,800 --> 00:10:27,770
it's a number of countries at a number

233
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:29,240
of organizations the problem is it

234
00:10:27,770 --> 00:10:31,370
doesn't have a lot of teeth to it

235
00:10:29,240 --> 00:10:33,470
there's nothing mandatory about this

236
00:10:31,370 --> 00:10:34,910
it's all voluntary and I'll talk a

237
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,279
little bit about that in a few minutes

238
00:10:34,910 --> 00:10:41,300
so the key characteristics once again

239
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,670
it's voluntary however it's trying to

240
00:10:41,300 --> 00:10:46,550
develop these enabling environments that

241
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:50,750
would encourage the adoption of some of

242
00:10:46,550 --> 00:10:52,880
these approaches and it's also engaging

243
00:10:50,750 --> 00:10:57,420
with business foundations and civils on

244
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:59,670
society etc so

245
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:02,160
joining to a little more policies in the

246
00:10:59,670 --> 00:11:04,050
US so the question that we ask in a lot

247
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,210
of the research I do is so what about

248
00:11:04,050 --> 00:11:08,250
the farm bill what's happening with the

249
00:11:06,210 --> 00:11:11,760
policies that we currently have in the

250
00:11:08,250 --> 00:11:14,640
farm bill do they incentivize resilience

251
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:17,220
to climate stresses that are consistent

252
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:19,770
with climate smart agriculture what

253
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:22,500
types of tools policy tools might be

254
00:11:19,770 --> 00:11:25,790
available to promote a more climate

255
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:29,070
smart agriculture and most importantly

256
00:11:25,790 --> 00:11:31,560
what do we need to know and what do we

257
00:11:29,070 --> 00:11:35,040
know and how is that gap being being

258
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:36,930
filled so the farm bill everybody here

259
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:39,900
knows it's basically the primary AG

260
00:11:36,930 --> 00:11:43,110
policy tool there's different titles in

261
00:11:39,900 --> 00:11:45,390
the farm bill 12 of them the ones I

262
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:48,450
circled are primarily the ones that work

263
00:11:45,390 --> 00:11:50,850
to deal with some of the climate smart

264
00:11:48,450 --> 00:11:53,070
agriculture the three orange ones deal

265
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:54,930
with commodity programs conservation and

266
00:11:53,070 --> 00:11:57,570
crop insurance and then we have a

267
00:11:54,930 --> 00:11:59,780
research title in the farm bill which

268
00:11:57,570 --> 00:12:02,850
indirectly is probably the strongest

269
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:04,920
piece of legislation that we have to

270
00:12:02,850 --> 00:12:06,450
continue to fund some of the research

271
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:08,670
that's needed meg and I think you know

272
00:12:06,450 --> 00:12:12,270
yours are the great example of this type

273
00:12:08,670 --> 00:12:13,710
of policy and then the distributions so

274
00:12:12,270 --> 00:12:17,640
I looked a little bit at some of these

275
00:12:13,710 --> 00:12:19,980
different titles and in the farm bill

276
00:12:17,640 --> 00:12:21,810
and the + next to it means that i think

277
00:12:19,980 --> 00:12:23,880
it is moving us in the direction of

278
00:12:21,810 --> 00:12:27,870
climate smart agriculture so

279
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:31,110
conservation compliance basically limits

280
00:12:27,870 --> 00:12:34,710
conservation requirements to crop

281
00:12:31,110 --> 00:12:36,960
insurance premiums etc the farms that

282
00:12:34,710 --> 00:12:39,350
have highly available lands or wetlands

283
00:12:36,960 --> 00:12:42,890
have to follow this conservation program

284
00:12:39,350 --> 00:12:45,660
to receive the government payments and

285
00:12:42,890 --> 00:12:48,900
so the question is what happens with the

286
00:12:45,660 --> 00:12:51,180
conservation compliance it's a shift

287
00:12:48,900 --> 00:12:54,420
toward working lands there's an equip

288
00:12:51,180 --> 00:12:58,020
program and so in terms of my safe space

289
00:12:54,420 --> 00:12:59,970
diagram i think that the conservation

290
00:12:58,020 --> 00:13:02,280
can result in an outward shift of the

291
00:12:59,970 --> 00:13:05,700
food system curve which is going to

292
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:09,390
increase that safes that um that safe

293
00:13:05,700 --> 00:13:09,990
space and helps to stabilize food

294
00:13:09,390 --> 00:13:12,779
production

295
00:13:09,990 --> 00:13:15,000
so manure management to curb greenhouse

296
00:13:12,779 --> 00:13:19,200
gas emissions I'm trying to do a little

297
00:13:15,000 --> 00:13:23,250
bit with respect to the the animal

298
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:25,250
agriculture costly but but effective for

299
00:13:23,250 --> 00:13:27,839
greenhouse gas emissions is these

300
00:13:25,250 --> 00:13:31,880
innovators there's a Douglas great study

301
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:35,010
at WSU that was done around 2010

302
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:36,750
currently the economic viability hinges

303
00:13:35,010 --> 00:13:39,029
on how to finance and the potential

304
00:13:36,750 --> 00:13:42,600
revenue so the operating costs versus

305
00:13:39,029 --> 00:13:44,850
the capital costs the revenues from

306
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:47,070
somebody operating a digester come from

307
00:13:44,850 --> 00:13:48,810
electricity and renewable fuel the fiber

308
00:13:47,070 --> 00:13:51,180
products in the nutrients that are

309
00:13:48,810 --> 00:13:54,420
by-products carbon credits if they were

310
00:13:51,180 --> 00:13:56,580
to exist and then payments for ecosystem

311
00:13:54,420 --> 00:13:59,070
enhancements and once again another case

312
00:13:56,580 --> 00:14:02,940
of shifting and making that safe space

313
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:04,140
bigger commodity programs I'm just not

314
00:14:02,940 --> 00:14:06,180
going to spend a lot of time on these

315
00:14:04,140 --> 00:14:08,850
because I think most people are familiar

316
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:11,310
with them but the commodity programs

317
00:14:08,850 --> 00:14:14,760
covered commodities include wheat oats

318
00:14:11,310 --> 00:14:17,339
barley etc they can cause this safe

319
00:14:14,760 --> 00:14:19,800
space to increase perhaps by improving

320
00:14:17,339 --> 00:14:21,510
the maximum food production but as we

321
00:14:19,800 --> 00:14:24,600
all know there is some downsides with

322
00:14:21,510 --> 00:14:27,390
some of the commodity programs and so

323
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:29,490
they s why I have a plus and a minus up

324
00:14:27,390 --> 00:14:31,829
there they may increase their income

325
00:14:29,490 --> 00:14:34,290
make them more resilient but it doesn't

326
00:14:31,829 --> 00:14:38,190
necessarily encourage adaptation to

327
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:41,190
other programs that we may want in to

328
00:14:38,190 --> 00:14:43,320
deal with climate change drought

329
00:14:41,190 --> 00:14:46,529
management basically the drought

330
00:14:43,320 --> 00:14:49,470
management policies could encourage

331
00:14:46,529 --> 00:14:51,630
flexibility and increase resilience the

332
00:14:49,470 --> 00:14:55,110
earlier paper that Justin did is a great

333
00:14:51,630 --> 00:14:57,510
example of what can happen if we were to

334
00:14:55,110 --> 00:14:59,100
get proper drought management policies

335
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,300
in place or better drought management

336
00:14:59,100 --> 00:15:05,339
policies in place and so once again here

337
00:15:03,300 --> 00:15:07,649
I think I've got the drought management

338
00:15:05,339 --> 00:15:11,910
could also basically increase the safe

339
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:17,690
space by sort of shifting the the

340
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:17,690
maximum food production curve out

341
00:15:18,350 --> 00:15:25,130
adaptive management a.m.p grazing

342
00:15:21,570 --> 00:15:25,130
management this is another

343
00:15:25,700 --> 00:15:31,710
policy short intensive braising followed

344
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:34,170
by long recovery so once again looking

345
00:15:31,710 --> 00:15:37,260
at how do we grade so vain how do we

346
00:15:34,170 --> 00:15:40,080
graze those lands the claim in some of

347
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:44,100
the studies is that cattle grazing using

348
00:15:40,080 --> 00:15:47,070
this amt may increase productivity and

349
00:15:44,100 --> 00:15:50,310
store more co2 so that's one of the

350
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:53,580
claims the adaptive it's adaptive touch

351
00:15:50,310 --> 00:15:56,040
it is an adaptive type of carbon capture

352
00:15:53,580 --> 00:15:58,770
and storage the question is it really

353
00:15:56,040 --> 00:16:01,440
hasn't been quantified and in order to

354
00:15:58,770 --> 00:16:03,090
quantify those claims we would have to

355
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,860
be we would have to be able to go out

356
00:16:03,090 --> 00:16:08,100
there and measure the increase or the

357
00:16:04,860 --> 00:16:11,220
decrease of the change in soil carbon as

358
00:16:08,100 --> 00:16:12,990
a result of this a.m p versus the

359
00:16:11,220 --> 00:16:15,450
current system that might be in place

360
00:16:12,990 --> 00:16:17,160
and then we need to know the economic

361
00:16:15,450 --> 00:16:19,020
dimensions what's happening to the

362
00:16:17,160 --> 00:16:23,720
weight of those animals what's happening

363
00:16:19,020 --> 00:16:25,920
to some of the products going on and

364
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:28,380
once again this would be a case of

365
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,350
increasing that safe space for climate

366
00:16:28,380 --> 00:16:33,630
smart agriculture so designing policies

367
00:16:31,350 --> 00:16:35,910
just a few more minutes and then take

368
00:16:33,630 --> 00:16:38,490
some questions designing policies

369
00:16:35,910 --> 00:16:41,310
fundamentals is that incentives matter

370
00:16:38,490 --> 00:16:43,110
economists are always coming back to

371
00:16:41,310 --> 00:16:46,400
this we need to understand those

372
00:16:43,110 --> 00:16:49,470
trade-offs and the opportunity costs I

373
00:16:46,400 --> 00:16:51,090
can skip over this okay so some of the

374
00:16:49,470 --> 00:16:55,680
tools that we have that we're developing

375
00:16:51,090 --> 00:16:58,350
for better informing our policies are

376
00:16:55,680 --> 00:17:01,760
both at the landscape level as well as

377
00:16:58,350 --> 00:17:05,700
at the farm level so once again ah

378
00:17:01,760 --> 00:17:06,690
premise is that farmers and ranchers are

379
00:17:05,700 --> 00:17:08,910
the ones that are making the

380
00:17:06,690 --> 00:17:10,770
on-the-ground decisions and so I think

381
00:17:08,910 --> 00:17:13,350
it's really important that we develop

382
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:16,110
tools for them to use and so that the

383
00:17:13,350 --> 00:17:19,290
landscape level these are the ones these

384
00:17:16,110 --> 00:17:21,390
big models the swap model the epic model

385
00:17:19,290 --> 00:17:23,220
and then we have one at Montana State I

386
00:17:21,390 --> 00:17:25,320
mean at Oregon State called the

387
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,710
trade-off analysis model it started at

388
00:17:25,320 --> 00:17:31,350
Montana State at the farm level these

389
00:17:28,710 --> 00:17:35,010
are the ones that we were that have been

390
00:17:31,350 --> 00:17:37,230
we've been looking at AG tools or AG biz

391
00:17:35,010 --> 00:17:42,030
logic which is the one that

392
00:17:37,230 --> 00:17:44,370
be talked about is comes under these

393
00:17:42,030 --> 00:17:46,559
farm level decision tools and basically

394
00:17:44,370 --> 00:17:51,059
they're designed to help Boaz or van

395
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:54,660
choose make operational choices the AG

396
00:17:51,059 --> 00:17:57,830
the AG tools on the on the right-hand

397
00:17:54,660 --> 00:18:01,110
side there is basically our software

398
00:17:57,830 --> 00:18:04,100
which can which is being developed now

399
00:18:01,110 --> 00:18:07,230
web-based and it has a number of sub

400
00:18:04,100 --> 00:18:09,600
programs in there AG profit a Gleason AG

401
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:14,370
finance and then AG environment this is

402
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:16,470
once again the same the same flavor and

403
00:18:14,370 --> 00:18:19,559
theme that Justin was talking about in

404
00:18:16,470 --> 00:18:22,200
terms of what he was looking at so the

405
00:18:19,559 --> 00:18:24,870
farm level decision tool this AKA we

406
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:26,700
nicknamed TurboTax platform for two

407
00:18:24,870 --> 00:18:30,270
reasons one is that it's going to take

408
00:18:26,700 --> 00:18:33,270
information from the growers tax returns

409
00:18:30,270 --> 00:18:35,400
and populate it into this program but

410
00:18:33,270 --> 00:18:38,640
it's also one that allows the growers to

411
00:18:35,400 --> 00:18:41,160
be able to fine tune it for their

412
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,870
situation so what has been what are

413
00:18:41,160 --> 00:18:46,340
their list of imports what has been

414
00:18:42,870 --> 00:18:50,250
their their experience in terms of

415
00:18:46,340 --> 00:18:52,530
yields or outputs and so the decision

416
00:18:50,250 --> 00:18:54,390
tool has these kind of components to it

417
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:57,870
the first is we want to use this

418
00:18:54,390 --> 00:18:59,429
platform to ask questions for the grower

419
00:18:57,870 --> 00:19:02,429
to ask questions you know should I

420
00:18:59,429 --> 00:19:04,799
change my crop rotation or my raising

421
00:19:02,429 --> 00:19:07,350
rates and invest in new equipment or

422
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:09,750
invest in other kinds of inputs based on

423
00:19:07,350 --> 00:19:11,580
expected changes in climate and crop

424
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:14,640
yields that may come along with some of

425
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:16,260
the climate changes that was seeing the

426
00:19:14,640 --> 00:19:21,900
other thing is it has to it's going to

427
00:19:16,260 --> 00:19:24,480
gather this data on their inputs and

428
00:19:21,900 --> 00:19:26,490
other spatially relevant data on their

429
00:19:24,480 --> 00:19:29,190
yields it's going to take all of that

430
00:19:26,490 --> 00:19:32,669
information and run it through the

431
00:19:29,190 --> 00:19:35,669
scenario the scenario that we have these

432
00:19:32,669 --> 00:19:38,760
sub sub routines that we have using

433
00:19:35,669 --> 00:19:40,980
different scenarios to look at basic

434
00:19:38,760 --> 00:19:42,960
outcomes and how the economic and

435
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:49,020
environmental outcomes will change as

436
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:50,640
the scenarios change so we've done this

437
00:19:49,020 --> 00:19:53,790
with the wheat and this

438
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:58,260
is what he was referring to we ran

439
00:19:53,790 --> 00:20:03,720
through this egg tools with them without

440
00:19:58,260 --> 00:20:07,170
climate change and we show that yes in

441
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:11,250
order to deal with and adjust to climate

442
00:20:07,170 --> 00:20:14,400
change this farmer this farmer would be

443
00:20:11,250 --> 00:20:17,610
better off switching his annual propping

444
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:19,800
rotation to something that includes seed

445
00:20:17,610 --> 00:20:24,750
oil and canola so once again just

446
00:20:19,800 --> 00:20:27,780
comparing those those two bottom circles

447
00:20:24,750 --> 00:20:28,560
there so the application so I was

448
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:30,690
thinking a little bit about the

449
00:20:28,560 --> 00:20:32,970
application of AG tools to livestock and

450
00:20:30,690 --> 00:20:35,370
clocks eved is doing this and I think

451
00:20:32,970 --> 00:20:38,250
one of the big pluses of a tool like

452
00:20:35,370 --> 00:20:41,910
this is it's going to allow the growers

453
00:20:38,250 --> 00:20:44,550
to make sense of all of the data that

454
00:20:41,910 --> 00:20:46,710
they have that there and make sense of

455
00:20:44,550 --> 00:20:49,290
it on something that means something to

456
00:20:46,710 --> 00:20:52,410
their operation and not just here is a

457
00:20:49,290 --> 00:20:53,880
typical ranch and so I think trying to

458
00:20:52,410 --> 00:20:56,760
drill down and get it to be as relevant

459
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:58,440
as possible so what what we're doing in

460
00:20:56,760 --> 00:21:00,510
clocks eva is actually doing this in

461
00:20:58,440 --> 00:21:02,940
oregon for some of the livestock

462
00:21:00,510 --> 00:21:04,740
operations is setting up these baseline

463
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:09,570
budgets and information making them

464
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:12,330
site-specific talking with growers and

465
00:21:09,570 --> 00:21:14,760
with ranchers to decide what are the

466
00:21:12,330 --> 00:21:17,580
scenarios that we need to be addressing

467
00:21:14,760 --> 00:21:19,380
and then to explore what those under

468
00:21:17,580 --> 00:21:21,920
those scenarios are their current

469
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:24,720
operations economically viable

470
00:21:21,920 --> 00:21:26,850
incorporate precip forecasts download

471
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:29,970
downscaled climate data and information

472
00:21:26,850 --> 00:21:33,980
and then i think step four is really

473
00:21:29,970 --> 00:21:36,480
important when I use TurboTax I tend to

474
00:21:33,980 --> 00:21:38,550
do a lot of different scenarios on how

475
00:21:36,480 --> 00:21:40,740
should I what should I be doing with my

476
00:21:38,550 --> 00:21:42,720
income should I be investing it here and

477
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,800
here and being able to compare those

478
00:21:42,720 --> 00:21:48,720
well AG tools is going to allow a

479
00:21:45,800 --> 00:21:51,900
venture or a grower to do the same kind

480
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:55,590
of thing is to be able to say how much

481
00:21:51,900 --> 00:22:00,600
better or for worse off would I be if I

482
00:21:55,590 --> 00:22:03,660
were to switch how I manage my operation

483
00:22:00,600 --> 00:22:04,559
when we see changes in climate coming or

484
00:22:03,660 --> 00:22:06,749
changes in play

485
00:22:04,559 --> 00:22:08,759
is or changes in technology so it's

486
00:22:06,749 --> 00:22:11,460
going to be used in a relative sense as

487
00:22:08,759 --> 00:22:13,769
opposed to an absolute sense and being

488
00:22:11,460 --> 00:22:15,600
able to allow the grower or the venture

489
00:22:13,769 --> 00:22:19,620
to be able to explore those and

490
00:22:15,600 --> 00:22:22,110
understand those trade-offs and you know

491
00:22:19,620 --> 00:22:24,450
what I can stop here because this is

492
00:22:22,110 --> 00:22:27,509
this is kind of repetitive of what other

493
00:22:24,450 --> 00:22:30,210
people have I think come up with what is

494
00:22:27,509 --> 00:22:32,100
quite far as presented what does climate

495
00:22:30,210 --> 00:22:34,110
change mean for agriculture some of the

496
00:22:32,100 --> 00:22:35,700
direct and the indirect impacts and so

497
00:22:34,110 --> 00:22:37,289
this gives me a flavor of what are the

498
00:22:35,700 --> 00:22:41,840
kind of things we need to be modeling

499
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:41,840
and capturing in a tool like AG tools

500
00:22:42,230 --> 00:22:49,619
yeah I can just stop there great thanks

501
00:22:47,580 --> 00:22:58,470
and I know we have the governor coming

502
00:22:49,619 --> 00:23:06,830
on in about five minutes so late okay

503
00:22:58,470 --> 00:23:06,830
great one question for me

504
00:23:08,049 --> 00:23:14,750
in Western Hemisphere we don't have that

505
00:23:11,030 --> 00:23:18,770
much problem with production of

506
00:23:14,750 --> 00:23:21,830
agricultural I think the problem is

507
00:23:18,770 --> 00:23:25,700
mainly the distribution of it version of

508
00:23:21,830 --> 00:23:31,370
the distribution lies in comparison with

509
00:23:25,700 --> 00:23:33,110
safe space yeah I don't think it is

510
00:23:31,370 --> 00:23:36,470
actually captured that well because

511
00:23:33,110 --> 00:23:38,270
that's a much high level issue you know

512
00:23:36,470 --> 00:23:40,429
I think you're exactly right you know we

513
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:43,970
talk about food security we probably

514
00:23:40,429 --> 00:23:45,799
have plenty of food on aggregate it's

515
00:23:43,970 --> 00:23:48,559
just not in the right places at the

516
00:23:45,799 --> 00:23:50,330
right time and so I think that that is

517
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:53,030
an area that hasn't been captured at

518
00:23:50,330 --> 00:23:55,100
least in that diagram it has been people

519
00:23:53,030 --> 00:23:57,620
are paying a lot of attention to it you

520
00:23:55,100 --> 00:23:59,299
know or again we're pretty wealthy in

521
00:23:57,620 --> 00:24:02,299
terms of you know the outside world

522
00:23:59,299 --> 00:24:05,120
looking in but we've got a lot of hunger

523
00:24:02,299 --> 00:24:06,770
and a lot of issues and it's you know so

524
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,860
it's not just the aggregate that's

525
00:24:06,770 --> 00:24:11,600
important it's the distribution and it's

526
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:13,720
looking at the winners and the losers

527
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:16,880
and usually the losers are oftentimes

528
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,669
low-income and so paying attention to

529
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:22,820
some of those those concerns as well and

530
00:24:19,669 --> 00:24:24,470
not just always feeding more I think the

531
00:24:22,820 --> 00:24:26,929
other thing on a little bit on that food

532
00:24:24,470 --> 00:24:29,929
demand is you know that there's a lot of

533
00:24:26,929 --> 00:24:31,700
effort going on on trying to minimize

534
00:24:29,929 --> 00:24:33,650
the waste if you look at some of the

535
00:24:31,700 --> 00:24:36,860
statistics on how much food is wasted

536
00:24:33,650 --> 00:24:39,289
and thrown away and not consumed or used

537
00:24:36,860 --> 00:24:41,270
you know if we can minimize that then

538
00:24:39,289 --> 00:24:44,630
the amount of land we need to bring into

539
00:24:41,270 --> 00:24:46,730
production or the types of may be much

540
00:24:44,630 --> 00:24:50,590
less than we think if we can get some of

541
00:24:46,730 --> 00:24:50,590
those numbers down so yeah sure

542
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:11,710
the one I didn't talk about the Toa the

543
00:25:09,220 --> 00:25:15,270
landscape level tool will do some of

544
00:25:11,710 --> 00:25:17,740
that at a bigger higher landscape and in

545
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:19,420
that one what we actually have is

546
00:25:17,740 --> 00:25:23,050
trade-offs between some of the

547
00:25:19,420 --> 00:25:25,630
environmental outcomes and then we've

548
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:29,230
modeled the agricultural outcomes as

549
00:25:25,630 --> 00:25:32,980
they grow up may produce a commodity as

550
00:25:29,230 --> 00:25:35,380
well as produce ecosystem services for

551
00:25:32,980 --> 00:25:37,540
example a carbon offsets or that

552
00:25:35,380 --> 00:25:40,020
commodity he could make choices or she

553
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:42,670
could make choices between producing

554
00:25:40,020 --> 00:25:45,970
some of the grain crops for actual

555
00:25:42,670 --> 00:25:47,920
grains versus energy and so there could

556
00:25:45,970 --> 00:25:50,400
be those those kinds of things but in

557
00:25:47,920 --> 00:25:55,240
but at the landscape level one at the

558
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:59,740
farm level one now but that's a that's a

559
00:25:55,240 --> 00:26:03,220
great example one of USDA's new calls

560
00:25:59,740 --> 00:26:05,080
for purple not USDA I guess it's USDA is

561
00:26:03,220 --> 00:26:08,320
it that the one that has the food food

562
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:10,150
systems energy and water Nexus yeah that

563
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:13,000
one is I think really really important

564
00:26:10,150 --> 00:26:15,280
it's hard to yeah we need to capture

565
00:26:13,000 --> 00:26:22,470
those complexities on you know what

566
00:26:15,280 --> 00:26:22,470
gives there sure

567
00:26:22,509 --> 00:26:27,509
Zoomers by encouraging climates

568
00:26:29,700 --> 00:26:34,400
labeling and

569
00:26:32,450 --> 00:26:37,400
yeah I don't know for sure it's not my

570
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:38,930
area there probably is I guess it's

571
00:26:37,400 --> 00:26:41,030
probably something where people are

572
00:26:38,930 --> 00:26:44,390
looking at the consumer demand how much

573
00:26:41,030 --> 00:26:46,370
more people willing to pay could this be

574
00:26:44,390 --> 00:26:48,980
the more interesting part of what you

575
00:26:46,370 --> 00:26:52,040
have is you know can this be somehow

576
00:26:48,980 --> 00:26:55,250
marketed that this was I guess it gets

577
00:26:52,040 --> 00:26:58,760
into the area of sustainable or you know

578
00:26:55,250 --> 00:27:01,850
not organic but produced sustainably so

579
00:26:58,760 --> 00:27:04,280
I think the climate smart agriculture

580
00:27:01,850 --> 00:27:08,690
like I said that whole movement grew out

581
00:27:04,280 --> 00:27:11,540
of fao in a lot of concern with

582
00:27:08,690 --> 00:27:12,680
developing countries and looking at you

583
00:27:11,540 --> 00:27:14,420
know what are the what are the options

584
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:19,190
and what are some of the ways that we

585
00:27:14,420 --> 00:27:21,620
can keep that safe space from shrinking

586
00:27:19,190 --> 00:27:24,590
down more and more because if we just do

587
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:27,290
business as usual the projections are

588
00:27:24,590 --> 00:27:30,200
those those you know curves are going to

589
00:27:27,290 --> 00:27:33,860
start condensing in and then that safe

590
00:27:30,200 --> 00:27:35,690
space for producing food and sustaining

591
00:27:33,860 --> 00:27:38,330
our climate will be shrinking and so the

592
00:27:35,690 --> 00:27:43,610
idea is how do we keep it from shrinking

593
00:27:38,330 --> 00:27:46,540
down or it's all get to expand yeah all

594
00:27:43,610 --> 00:27:46,540
right thanks
