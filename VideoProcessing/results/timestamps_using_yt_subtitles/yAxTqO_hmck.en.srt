00:00:14,920 --> 00:00:17,920
so

00:00:18,000 --> 00:00:39,250

4
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:45,840
oh

00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:46,439
yes

00:01:40,580 --> 00:01:46,439
[Music]

11
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:54,880
morning chaps welcome along to the vlog

12
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:59,040
that chunk up there there

13
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:01,280
is a piece of one by one five mil steel

14
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,200
which i ordered along with all this

15
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
stuff on the floor

16
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,640
when i ordered the treads they were the

17
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,560
treads the angle line were the treads

18
00:02:06,640 --> 00:02:11,039
for the staircase

19
00:02:08,560 --> 00:02:13,599
and the idea is to increase the

20
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,400
dimensions of this little welding table

21
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:18,160
i mean we've got by with it so far but

22
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:19,440
now i've changed the orientation of the

23
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:21,840
workshop

24
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,599
i think we can actually fit a larger

25
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
welding table in there

26
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,360
which means that we can reposition this

27
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,080
massive vise

28
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,200
and just have a better workflow around

29
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,720
this area

30
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,400
i'm also going to put the new welding

31
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:37,440
table on wheels and

32
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:39,360
everything in the workshop apart from

33
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,160
the built-in stuff like this cabinet

34
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:41,840
here

35
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,319
will be mobile and we can move them

36
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,480
around if we need to make a bit more

37
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,080
space put them out there

38
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,720
into the brewery space and then bring

39
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,959
them back in when we're finished

40
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:54,080
so that is a job on the list but it

41
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:55,760
isn't for today

42
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:58,319
today's job is going to be to finish off

43
00:02:55,760 --> 00:03:00,159
the staircase which we have nearly done

44
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,840
there's just a few trims to go around

45
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,400
the edge of the

46
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,120
oak flooring and then that is put to bed

47
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,319
i can come

48
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:10,560
back out of the workshop out of the pub

49
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,560
then

50
00:03:10,879 --> 00:03:14,959
and as you can see the saw's missing

51
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:16,319
from over here that's next door

52
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:19,040
we can start to put all these little

53
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,480
bits away and probably start to crack on

54
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,560
with another job

55
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,159
and one of those other jobs is i would

56
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:27,840
like to make

57
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:30,720
a mixing paddle for the mash tun

58
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:32,319
using one of these plaster mixers

59
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:34,640
relatively cheap

60
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:37,120
from tool station so if i burn it out

61
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:40,879
it's not a big expense

62
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:44,879
the drawback of course is the uh

63
00:03:40,879 --> 00:03:47,599
mixing arm is galvanized steel

64
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,560
no good really for putting in the mash

65
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
or

66
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:52,400
you know having to go through an acid

67
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,959
wash

68
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:57,040
caustic wash and the like the caustic

69
00:03:54,959 --> 00:04:00,159
will strip the zinc off straight away

70
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:04,400
so that's something that we cannot do

71
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:07,200
so i bought some little bits of

72
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:08,400
stainless steel bar which are down there

73
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,920
at the moment

74
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:16,239
but we've got like a i think

75
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:19,280
16 mil shaft and then some 10 mil

76
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:20,959
smaller pieces of steel which will bend

77
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,479
we'll try and either emulate what we've

78
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,240
got here because this does a

79
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:27,280
pretty good job of mixing plastic so it

80
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,919
should do a good job of mixing grain

81
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,880
and fail that if it's uh not working

82
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,720
quite as well

83
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:34,800
we'll weld on some little paddle flaps

84
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:37,520
or something like that to agitate

85
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,240
the mash a little bit more and we might

86
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,320
even

87
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:44,639
at some point be expanding this project

88
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:45,919
to something that can bolt onto the top

89
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:49,199
of the mash tun

90
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:51,280
so it wouldn't be at risk of getting wet

91
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:56,080
because of course if i drop this in

92
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:59,440
i have to run away of course it will be

93
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,400
it will be situated and uh implemented

94
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,440
via

95
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:07,440
a ground fault uh gfi

96
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:10,479
d so where i don't get electrocuted

97
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:12,880
you know an rcd residual current device

98
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:14,080
whatever they're called but at the

99
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,280
moment we're going to use it

100
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:18,800
manually when it's made just got to weld

101
00:05:17,280 --> 00:05:22,320
up the components

102
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,639
and make sure everything fits i wonder

103
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:27,199
if i could just use

104
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,840
a bit of threaded bar stainless steel

105
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:31,039
threaded bar

106
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,440
well we'll see we'll come to this

107
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:35,120
project another time but this is one

108
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:35,840
that's on the list so i'm just going

109
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,440
over

110
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,560
all the steel that was delivered the

111
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,000
other day and that obviously involves

112
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:45,520
the new welding table the angle iron for

113
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,800
the treads upstairs

114
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,520
and some stainless steel for a badass

115
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:56,320
mash tun mixing paddle and the heavens

116
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:56,320
have opened

117
00:05:56,560 --> 00:06:02,400
oh my goodness well it's a good job

118
00:05:59,919 --> 00:06:06,000
we've got this uh

119
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:11,120
massive tent that nobody's

120
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:11,120
enjoying frigging locked down

121
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:17,919
so as soon as it's freezing cold and wet

122
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:20,000
outside the rain has stopped now though

123
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:22,560
i've got a little bit of threaded bar

124
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,000
that we spoke about this morning

125
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:26,639
we're about to cut it on that little

126
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,919
pencil line

127
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:32,560
with the grinding disk and i'm going to

128
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:35,840
set about trying to make

129
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:38,000
a mixing paddle for the mash tun

130
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:40,479
hopefully this will work i think we're

131
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:42,400
going to need some

132
00:06:40,479 --> 00:06:43,919
more bar than what showing i don't know

133
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:44,960
we'll see we'll see we don't know until

134
00:06:43,919 --> 00:06:47,360
we brew

135
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:48,639
but what i do know is that i can't find

136
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:52,160
any

137
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:54,560
m14 threaded rod to weld onto the end

138
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,840
so we're gonna have to kind of do a

139
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:58,319
little bit of bodging

140
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,599
and get the original stick here cut it

141
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:02,240
off around there

142
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:02,880
weld it onto the new piece so we can

143
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:07,039
screw it

144
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:09,440
in and out of the mixer and then

145
00:07:07,039 --> 00:07:11,520
with any look we'll be able to just

146
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:12,720
spray some lacquer or some liquid galv

147
00:07:11,520 --> 00:07:15,599
on there

148
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,599
just so this doesn't come into contact

149
00:07:15,599 --> 00:07:18,880
with any cleaning fluids

150
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,520
but it shouldn't be a problem because

151
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,199
we'll have just a little top section

152
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,599
there like that

153
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:26,240
that's going to be going straight into

154
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,039
this bit

155
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,080
so there shouldn't be too much

156
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:34,479
galvanized

157
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,479
carbon steel on the whole shebang

158
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:40,400
meaning less risk of rust and thing

159
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,160
so i'm going to set up the grinder we'll

160
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:45,280
chop this bar off

161
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:48,160
and then we'll cut down this thin rod

162
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,720
and see if we can bend it into the

163
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,000
correct

164
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,960
shape so i've

165
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:55,919
managed to clamp the stainless into the

166
00:07:54,960 --> 00:08:00,080
vise

167
00:07:55,919 --> 00:08:00,080
let's bring the original over

168
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:05,599
so we've obviously increased the size

169
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:08,960
that goes without saying doesn't it

170
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:11,199
go big or go home and we managed to

171
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:14,000
put a bit of a bend on it's relatively

172
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:17,039
equal but not perfect

173
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:19,039
in fact it might end up being too big

174
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:20,160
and then we've nipped these two corners

175
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,440
down here

176
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,919
and made them one

177
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,360
i am worried that we're not gonna have

178
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:30,639
enough

179
00:08:27,360 --> 00:08:31,599
uh steel but we shall see and then now i

180
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:35,440
have to try and

181
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:39,039
reorientate the base section the steel

182
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:41,839
and put some of these uh

183
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:43,839
helical flutes into it i don't think

184
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,600
this is going to work out

185
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:47,360
as symmetrical and as nice as i'd

186
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:51,120
actually want it to but

187
00:08:47,360 --> 00:08:53,279
fingers crossed we get a bit closer

188
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:54,720
i'm telling you i'm telling you boys and

189
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,839
girls

190
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:59,600
that looks a lot better than it did 10

191
00:08:57,839 --> 00:09:03,920
minutes ago

192
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:06,880
so i think that will do for

193
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,320
a mixing paddle i've got the shaft on

194
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,560
vertical

195
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,600
the tines whilst they aren't bent

196
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:16,000
perfectly

197
00:09:11,600 --> 00:09:19,839
are pretty damn close to what we had

198
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,640
here previously a lot of fetlin has gone

199
00:09:19,839 --> 00:09:23,200
into that

200
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:24,399
a heck of a lot but you know what that's

201
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:27,360
about as close

202
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,959
as you can get with something like that

203
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:30,800
and there was a point when i was putting

204
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:32,880
it together that i thought

205
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,839
this is going to end up in the [ __ ]

206
00:09:32,880 --> 00:09:36,959
bucket

207
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:38,480
but thankfully we pulled through so now

208
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:41,040
all i have to do i've chopped this

209
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:44,320
section off the uh the connector for the

210
00:09:41,040 --> 00:09:48,480
mixer we've just got to stick this

211
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,480
up on the top there weld that on

212
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,920
get some of this galv off as well so it

213
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:53,600
doesn't bother me i'm going to put a

214
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:55,360
bevel on there so we get a nice tight

215
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,760
weld onto it

216
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:59,040
um and then go around and fill it until

217
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,720
it comes flush with the rest of the

218
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:03,600
parent metal

219
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:04,480
just to give it plenty of strength so

220
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:06,959
we'll be back

221
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:07,839
when that's done so you should be able

222
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,959
to see now

223
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,120
both of these tips have been sharpened

224
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,120
like pencil

225
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:16,240
so when we weld these two pieces

226
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,480
together

227
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:20,320
we can get right down into the root of

228
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:22,240
the steel right into the heart if you

229
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:25,920
think of it as a tree

230
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,720
that means we'll be making sure that

231
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:29,920
it's as

232
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:31,839
strong a joint as possible

233
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:33,519
i have to figure out now a way of

234
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:34,560
squaring it up i think what i'm going to

235
00:10:33,519 --> 00:10:37,600
do

236
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:40,640
is stick it in the corner

237
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:43,600
of a piece of angle iron and of course

238
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:46,720
that will mean that it's going to be sat

239
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,920
level all the way across uh i'll show

240
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,680
you what i mean i think i've got a

241
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,320
little bit over here

242
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,079
that should be short enough here we are

243
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,440
look

244
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:58,640
so provided there's no swarf in the

245
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:00,880
corners

246
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:02,640
and there does seem to be a little bit

247
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,079
it should sit level so i'll just clear

248
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:05,200
this swarf out and i'll show you what i

249
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:08,800
mean

250
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:11,920
so here's the setup angle iron

251
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:14,000
clamped both sides which means that this

252
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,680
bar now will run parallel to the angle

253
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,519
iron provided of course with making the

254
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:18,880
assumption that the angle iron is

255
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:22,160
straight

256
00:11:18,880 --> 00:11:23,760
and then over here we've got the same

257
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:27,519
thing

258
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,680
but with the tiny little uh

259
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:30,880
bolt section just hidden away in there

260
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:33,120
look

261
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:35,760
and what we're looking for now this is

262
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:39,360
tricky because

263
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:42,560
the diameter of these two are

264
00:11:39,360 --> 00:11:45,920
different so i'm having to kind of bodge

265
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:49,680
this up a little bit and i am winging it

266
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:52,800
to provide the right

267
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:56,000
kind of uh distance here

268
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,639
off the base of the steel in order

269
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:00,480
for this this is too much up in order

270
00:11:58,639 --> 00:12:04,240
for this to

271
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:07,920
line up with the center

272
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:10,639
of that piece of steel there

273
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:12,240
maybe if i zoom in just a touch more

274
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:15,040
you'll be able to see

275
00:12:12,240 --> 00:12:17,440
what we're aiming for so there's the gap

276
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,720
and we do want a little gap in between

277
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:20,560
because we're gonna bridge that with a

278
00:12:18,720 --> 00:12:22,959
bit of steel

279
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,079
and then we're gonna fill the rest of

280
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,760
this

281
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:29,279
up with filler rod until it's flush with

282
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:33,760
the parent metal

283
00:12:29,279 --> 00:12:36,880
and hopefully we get a straight

284
00:12:33,760 --> 00:12:38,480
fitting now i'm not going to know

285
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:40,480
straight off the bat i'm just going to

286
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:43,360
wing it as close as i can get it

287
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:43,680
put a little bit of filler in there then

288
00:12:43,360 --> 00:12:47,360
go

289
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:50,000
over to the machine itself screw it in

290
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:50,880
give it a few tweaks pull the trigger

291
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,440
ooh

292
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:54,399
and see how we get on and that's as good

293
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,959
as it's going to get

294
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:57,920
so i'm going to go and fill this and

295
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:02,320
hopefully

296
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:06,240
it comes out exactly how we want it to

297
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:09,360
complete there we have it i'm trying to

298
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:11,200
prop up the uh

299
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:13,040
the camera so we can get some shots here

300
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:15,839
i don't have a tripod

301
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,560
that's the finished article i haven't

302
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:19,279
hit it with

303
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,160
a grinder or anything yet or even

304
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:22,240
cleaned it up

305
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:24,399
so i hope you can see it's probably not

306
00:13:22,240 --> 00:13:28,399
the best angle to be fair

307
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:29,839
but i'm limited in what i can do

308
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:32,000
in terms of propping the phone up

309
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:36,560
somewhere so

310
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:38,880
here we go let's screw this bad boy

311
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:40,800
onto the mixer oh damn i mean i've never

312
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:45,040
smacked myself in face with it then

313
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:47,440
not if it's all that right

314
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:50,000
that is attached that will go into the

315
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:50,000
mash tun

316
00:13:51,839 --> 00:14:03,839
and that is mixing

317
00:14:11,390 --> 00:14:14,460
[Music]

318
00:14:14,839 --> 00:14:21,600
okay

319
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:23,760
well if that don't do the trick

320
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:25,040
i don't know what will there we go let

321
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:29,519
me uh

322
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:33,040
take the camera i've actually got it

323
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:37,360
oh jesus i've got it in the uh

324
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:40,320
in the vice of all things

325
00:14:37,360 --> 00:14:41,600
but what do you reckon folks mixing

326
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,720
paddle

327
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,320
a harry brew 69

328
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,480
you can probably buy one of these in

329
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:49,440
stainless steel for 40 quid from bloody

330
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:51,519
ebay

331
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,279
i know i didn't look surely it's not

332
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:54,240
going to be a meter long like this one

333
00:14:53,279 --> 00:14:57,839
is

334
00:14:54,240 --> 00:14:59,600
in fact it's longer than a meter but

335
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:01,839
that didn't cost me a lot in steel

336
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:03,279
probably about 12 pound in steel for the

337
00:15:01,839 --> 00:15:04,959
stock

338
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,720
and then a little bit of welding and

339
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:10,320
let's face it

340
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:12,000
with an argon tank like that

341
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,600
well we can afford to do a little bit of

342
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:14,959
spot welding here and there but i think

343
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:18,079
that's fantastic

344
00:15:14,959 --> 00:15:19,839
that concludes today's project well

345
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:21,680
several projects actually we've finished

346
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:25,120
the stairs off

347
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:26,639
we've got this done and uh

348
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:28,399
that was a project i didn't think i was

349
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,040
going to get to today

350
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:32,560
now before i go i did want to say a

351
00:15:31,040 --> 00:15:35,360
couple of things

352
00:15:32,560 --> 00:15:36,959
too mainly to mr andrew lynch who's been

353
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:40,240
watching

354
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:42,959
um waiting for me to review his

355
00:15:40,240 --> 00:15:44,639
wonderful beers which he was kind enough

356
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:48,160
to send to me

357
00:15:44,639 --> 00:15:48,880
so we've got the uh well that's the

358
00:15:48,160 --> 00:15:52,839
cider

359
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:54,240
there this is the hokum stomp oatmeal

360
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:58,000
porter

361
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,079
and what's this here the elvish juice

362
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
dude i'm gonna get stuck into these over

363
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:04,240
christmas

364
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:05,199
uh a couple of people know but not many

365
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:08,800
i've been doing

366
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:10,240
a bit of a crash diet uh i'm hundreds of

367
00:16:08,800 --> 00:16:14,399
how i was

368
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:15,120
105 kilograms knocking on the door of 17

369
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,639
stone

370
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:18,800
and quite frankly i thought it was about

371
00:16:16,639 --> 00:16:20,839
time i shifted a little bit to that

372
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,240
uh so i've been doing this diet and it's

373
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:24,079
worked

374
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:25,440
i've dropped quite a few kilograms in

375
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:28,399
about three weeks

376
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:30,720
