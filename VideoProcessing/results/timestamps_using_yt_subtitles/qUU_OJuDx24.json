  "text": "first thing we got to go do is check the Big Joe herd they've been in the Burn Unit since the post working I had this little inspiration to bring back the Wild Turkey population here you don't want to keep them in a small pin we need to do something different so muris and I just got something we're moving our turkeys in it today hey guys welcome back to cross timers bison I want to thank happy Farmer for sponsor today's video Marissa AR super excited if you guys don't already know we rais wild turkeys so mariss and I just got something that's going to make a huge difference for our turkey ranching first thing we got to go check the Big Joe herd like I said they've been in the burn unit for about a week or two we've checked them on them we checked on them several times but I'm going to take them some hay and I'm going to try to move them to the 9 acres and then into pasture 4 which is where recently we've been cleaning out a pond in there because it was completely dry well two large rains have surprised us so much and filled the sucker up which means now we can rotate our bison in there they can start Grazing In that pasture since it's had rest they'll have water now in their new cleaned out Pond and also I'm going to give them some grassy alphaalpha and some native hay roll it out for them have plenty of to munch on so the Big Joe herd hasn't seen the feed truck in a couple of weeks so I bet they're excited to see me I see them right here over the hill oh yeah here they come what are you doing over here silly boy so what's interesting here is I just rolled out two bells of hay so what we're doing is I'm rolling out some hay just kind of giving them plenty to eat what I did was I rolled out two bells of hay over there some long strips on some grass that uh some ground that needs to be covered it's some very short grazed low grass and so I'm trying to get some coverage on it but so I rolled out a native and then I rolled out alphaalpha and then to kind of draw them back back in from the Burn Unit obviously it worked and then I this morning I just rolled out a native hay and then I rolled out Alfalfa Bill and so I rolled all that out they've got plenty to eat it's all spread out everywhere for them the interesting thing is I rolled out that native over there and maybe it's just because I'm over here and this goofy guy but I rolled out the this right here is Grassy Alfalfa right through here and so far that's what they're liking so that's interesting it's good to know that they're liking this grassy alphaalpha it's got a little bit more protein in it actually it has a lot more protein in it we've got anywhere from 20 to 24% on this grassy alphalpha compared to the native hay I rolled out there um which that cow she's over there eating it um which is about 6 or 7% protein so that's good stuff and get them through the winter and they need this protein especially uh when we're getting our first days of freezing so just give you a little background information what we did is I had this little inspiration to bring back the Wild Turkey population here in southern Oklahoma especially here at the Ponderosa used to be lots of wild turkeys and when I say wild turkeys I'm talking about the Easterns and mostly the Rio Grands I want to try to contribute and get the turkey population going again here so what I did was is in April and May of 2024 I bought some wild turkey eggs online had them shipped to us we incubated them and out of the 30 we only had seven struggled a little bit I heard that wild turkeys are hard to incubate and hatch out so we only ended up with seven so our goals kind of Switched a little bit we've got three hands and four Toms and what we wanted to do with that as we kind of changed our mind we said well we're going to keep them we asked you guys and you recommended this we kept these adults and we're going to wait till the spring again when these hens hopefully start laying eggs for the first time ever we're going to keep the eggs we're going to incubate them we're going to do a better job and hopefully get a big group of turkeys and then we'll let a big flock of them go out here on the Ponderosa yes wild turkeys and bison back together again that's what we're doing so what we did was is mariss and I we don't want to keep them in a small pin which we've had them there for a while and I said we need to do something different I like the mobile units I wanted to try to do something where we can move them around right they're wild turkeys let's do the best we can to keep them wild essentially living off the land with some help from us right some feed some clean water those things uh because this is basically our breeding stock here and so what we did as we reached out to the mobile chicken coups from Happy farmer this is what we got it is going to be so awesome we're going to show you guys all the things that we can do with this we're going to move it around the Ponderosa so this mobile chicken unit from Happy farmer came in on a big 18-wheeler semi truck my skid steer was actually out in the field so I used the Hydro Bed to unload this long pallet of all the parts and all the equipment to set up this mobile chicken unit so the next thing was is to put this thing together so we could get these turkeys in there as quick as possible Marissa and I did this together I would highly recommend using at least two people for this project just because this is a 10x8 mobile unit we got one of the largest mobile units just because we're dealing with a a larger bird instead of just chickens this is definitely made for chickens there's several different sizes on the happy fer website that you can pick from but Marissa and I put this together t teamed it and it actually wasn't bad at all took a little bit of time working together obviously start with the sides got the sidewalls completed got our angles then we started putting on our Rafters and then the main beam of course you're going to get the instructions there's also some videos online that Marissa and I used to kind of get an idea of what it was supposed to look like and how it's supposed to put together so we did use the videos online as well all the bolts and nuts come in separate packages and they're marked for you so you know what bolts you're going to be using for different parts of this pin once we got the door on and the main hole frame of this chicken pin built we moved it a little bit closer to the barn where we actually going to move our turkeys in it so we didn't have to take the turkeys very far and we're going to put them in an area where we're going to be able to rotate kind of around the front yard sort of inside the pond D Roa but of course what makes this mobile is how these tires come up and down this is a neat and easy concept that they came up with and this thing is not heavy at all this whole system is so light I can already tell it's going to be a great way for us to move the turkeys around so once we did that we got it set stationary and then we put the tarp this is a heavy duty tarp and I think it will last a long time two three four it's pretty simple Brooks and her cousin AJ are out here with us helping us put on this canvas and then they're going to help us move these turkeys to their new PIN all right now's the time we got the turkey pin completely built we're not going to mess with the water system right now because uh we're in freezing temperatures and looks like a really awesome and nice water system so we're not going to mess with it right now but it'll be very handy and super nice especially in the warmer temperatures but we've got to get the turkeys out of this pin and move them into their new mobile pin we can't wait to do that so this is the uh fun part getting in with these uh wild turkeys okay girl hey about had an escape artist good night Nancy one are you good with just taking one at a time one at a I think that sounds like a good idea I got seven I know I don't want to be responsible for the uh and I got ni I'm going to watch it go get the bucket out of [Applause] [Applause] there I bullet okay y'all wait

the hens are a little bit uh got a little bit more blood in them I guess some wild blood and the toms those Toms are the first ones that come up and eat they're first ones that come up to you in the pin but those hands they're a little bit of more skittish yeah very skittish so that one time my mayor may not have let one of the turkeys out out it was probably a Tom well yeah you hope I think so the H are just a little bit more little bit more golly you going to take some of those just give me a better home there babe oh her band's about to come off you want me to go get some BCE scripts or

Brooks are you not Manning your post let oh you're in trouble [Music] now open the gate for me she could have in the cage I it so it's fine it's fine oh yeah they're fine hold ons hold on so we've got six in there so far two hands four times this is the last hand the hands like I said are the most skittish and uh these suckers are athletic and fast so it's hard to just catch them it's easier if you get them by both legs and then kind of drag them and catch their body cuz they'll they'll they'll get you were you transporting a f better oh she's F bullet man if you don't get their feet you lose glad it's you and not me see when you get them by their feet they kind of come here come here here come here come here I got you let's see this number see this number four do their heads ever get like

neck I was talking about all on its head kind of what yeah I don't know will they come in or they stay sort of blue like that on the hands I don't know look into one more hey Morgan what's up girl cor

now hold on Dad's setting this one free there they go two much bigger pin four whoa that one's a big one isn't it they're fluffy aren't they five seven you got seven good job babe Happy farmer pin right here mobile turkey chicken unit Dr babe heck yeah so we've got roosting bars right here here back there all the diagonal are roosting bars These Bars can be used to hang feet off of right here and a water system and so we're going to eventually have a water system that'll attach right here to this and it'll be able to ran through there and it'll be an automatic gravity flow water system but right now we're in freezing temps and we're not going to mess with it right now so excited about this so we can just pop up the wheels and now since they're here in our yard basically of the Ponderosa we'll just be able to pick it up and move it all throughout the yard here can even go out in the pasture but we're going to let them acclimate to this so far because they've been in that small pin for a while and deserve to be in something bigger so I want to thank happy Farmer for sponsoring our video today we cannot wait to use this mobile unit of course we're going to show you guys keep you updated with it and we're just happy to have our wild turkeys in this new 10 x18 pin if you're interested in a lightweight mobile chicken turkey or duck unit check them out at happy farmer.com these guys are little unsure about what is going on hey [Music] Blackjack Maya where are you think girl all right hey buddy thank you guys for watching us we'll see you soon we keep on Bon ranching",
