  "text": "[Music] Okay. So about four years ago, our path crossed and he's popularly known in the eastern region for cultivating crops like rubber, cocoa, and plantain. is an interesting get together again. And today we are not just going to talk about the old things but something new that has happened which has to do with coconut nursery production. And seated next to me to tell me more about this business and what got him into it iswamiame and [Applause] aka I don't want to mention that oneame. Nice meeting you again. Nice meeting you. Oh my goodness. It's been 4 years already. Yeah. So, how has it been? It's been great. It's been great. I understand the difficulties we all have in this country, but we all count. I'm counting my blessings. It's been great. Great. Great. Let's refresh the memory of those who might not have seen your story four years ago. Um, your schooling days in UK and then you got back to Ghana and then refused to go. When we want to go, me I want to go. Let's get to know briefly again who Kqaame is for the purpose of those who have not seen the interviews we've done four years ago. Uhwame I'll simply say somebody who is so passionate about agric um I think coming September will be my 12th year of being being in agriculture being a farmer 12th year right so I think the journey started somewhere in 2012 when I decided to go into rubber so currently I have about 94 acres of rubber then I moved into cocoa which I'm doing about 160 acres of cocoa mhm M um I like the challenge so I decided to take on something very different and that is coconut. So um I think among all these two three um the three cups that I'm planting coconut is something that I really enjoy. Oh really? And um yeah I think I really really enjoy doing coconut. Okay. Um not just because of how sweet coconut taste but I I think it's a lovely tree crop. Okay. And I think people need to really understand more about coconut. So I mean we here to just breathe. Awesome. Awesome. Awesome. Um talking about a sweetness and a lovely crop. Is that what made you got started or something else? Um I think it's more of diversification. Okay. Where I was looking at diversifying and looking for something different to do. Um as I said the first focus was to do rubber then cocoa. I've done a lot of things you know. I don't really want to talk about it like in vegetables almost a lot of things but I think um I chanced on coconut I mean where I realized was something that Ghanaians were really patronizing so the interest I mean got to me so I decided to just um diversify into coconut as well okay and how will you describe the experience so far it's been great um I know a lot of people want to get go into agriculture and I would say coconut is um somehow one the easiest treatment. Okay. Um I mean I say easiest not to say that it's easy to do but then if you follow the right procedures and the right methods, it's not that difficult. Okay. And then a lot of Ghanaians are I can I realize we are we don't have the time. Most of the people who want to go into agriculture one way or the other don't have the time to be a farm throughout 24/7. Exactly. Um I think coconut is one of the farms that you can have where you can be a bit absent because it doesn't really demand you know doesn't demand a lot but then as I said you need to get it right okay you can't just do it anyhow you know you can't just do it I understand with all the three cups having it been cocoa coconut guava mango cashew it all demands time lifewise coconut but then with my experience I think it's one of the things that most people can invest in where they can feel very relaxed and you know visit the farms as to when they make the time to go there. So yeah a lot of people are interested in coconut farming um especially because of its profitability and also the endless benefit that you get from coconut. However, most people also get it wrong especially when they are going to buy the seedling for planting. And so I want want us to touch on how can a novelist or even someone is already into farming but want to diversify like you have done. How am I able to identify a hybrid and non-hybrid coconut seedling? A very good question. I would want to go back a little bit to share how I even got into coconut nursery. Go ahead. So I think 2017 that was when I wanted to embark on um having a coconut farm. Um, fortunately I I like to do farms on a large scale. I don't really believe in 2, three, four, five acres. Not to say, okay, if you want to have an acre coconut farm is bad, but then I was looking at doing coconut up to about 200 acres. Okay. So the seedling selection as to what exactly I'm planting was something I was very very interested in. Not to say there weren't nursery operators around. I saw a lot of them. Yeah. But then when the right questions I call it right question because I did my research I I asked they are not able to really give me the answers to the question that I'm asking them. So I think it was a bit difficult for me when it comes to um um getting my siblings for my coconut farm. You know like the rubber was easy because um right where I have my rubber farms there's a company RPG rubber plantation Ghana so they have the siblings. at the cocoa farm you know we have a subsidiary for cocoa that's the um SPDC production department who goes to the um producing the seedlings for us but with the coconut I realized there was nothing like that you know so that's when I met one um aonomist Dr. who I met you know through research. Okay. Who explained things to me um who gave me some numbers then I embarked on it. Yeah. But prior to that I still went ahead to purchase some few seedlings from some few natural places but subsequently I started nursing my own siblings in my farm just to transplant them into my field into the field. Exactly. So I think I had a lot of interest. I mean when people came to the farm they saw my siblings and are you selling them? Are you selling them? And I started giving them um exactly what got me to start this nursery. So with a lot of experience the question going back to the question you asked me how do you identify between the hybrid the hybrid because I get it a lot when you go to a typical um nezri or n operator who is selling coconut. I mean the the first question people ask is I want hybrid. I want hybrid. I want the one that that germinates within that start producing food within three years within five years and it's a very difficult it's a very good question but how do you it's kind of impossible impossible to identify a hybrid seedling by just picking the nut. It's impossible because you have to be in the farm you have to see the tree to where the nut is coming from. You can easily identify a hybrid tree. So out of the hybrid tree, you get the hybrid nuts. And I was a bit shocked because mean you go out there to the N operators asking them is it hybrid? They will tell you yes, it's hybrid. Sometimes it's true. I'm not saying and I'm not trying to say that they're lying. But how are you sure these are hybrid seeds? So that's when I was a bit excited because I was picking my nuts from a hybrid farm. I was producing my own nursery for my own farm. So I I have all the benefit a hybrid farm can have in my farm. So you can't identify unless you're in the farm. Sometimes you can try to use the the overallness of the of the of the nuts, but it's still not doesn't make any sense to me. You have to be in the farm, okay, to really know whether this nurses it's hybrid or not. You have to be in the farm to really identify. M if not I don't see any way you can identify between a hybrid and another hybrid farm not a hybrid there's no way it's practically impossible so you have to be in the farm see the tree and that's why so let me go back to it usually when you read more about coconut they will tell you that it's it's better and it's ideal to nurse seedlings out of a farm that is about 20 years plus it's not because of anything one you So when you have a a hybrid farm that's about 20 years, you can clearly see its features. You can see the nuts, you can see the tree itself, right? You can really identify that is hybrid or not. Okay? Cuz if you start using coconut that is about five, six, seven years when it starting to to cultivate as a cultivar to cultivate um produce leisurely, it's kind of difficult to identify it. So usually it's better that you have a farm that is about 25 30 years. Most of my farms, you know, and to to add it up, I I hardly produce I don't even produce my nurses in Ghana. Okay. They all from Ivory, okay? You know, and most of my farms are uh usually 60 years, 40 years, 35 years. Okay? And you can see a 35 year old farm that has that height, okay? And you can easily identify and they'll tell you this same farm is 35 years, but it's not hybrid. You can see how tall okay the the whole farm is and let me just butress with and end it with that question that why do people even want hybrid signals why why hybrid does it mean the other nurseries are not good they are good they're equally good but you know the term hybrid I mean hybrid in the sense that anything hybrid is kind of is taken through a process where one is a bit resistant to diseases one is a bit robust is susceptible to diseases and all that And the most important thing about hybrid is hybrid coconut is the maturity. Okay. As to when when you plant it and how long it will take to get the fruit. So I think that answers the question. You need to be in the hybrid farm. Okay. To know that this farm is hybrid before you can pick a nut. If not, it's impossible. Okay. So what's the capacity of this production center? Yeah. Currently here we have we had about 40,000. Okay. But we've been moving them out. So now we have about 20 27,000 over here. Okay. So what we have here are they all hybrid or nonhybrid? All hybrid siblings or pure proper hybrid siblings. All right. And I I think I I want to backress with this where I even prefer people to come to my farm. You know I have 170 acre coconut farm. Oh yeah. Sure. So usually when people come over here, I tell them you don't have to even listen to all that I have to say to you. But if you have the opportunity, visit my farm, see what I've done, then you can at least speak to it. Okay? It's all hybrid. Pure hybrid. Okay. Now, when you drive around Ghana, you see bits and pieces of coconut here and there. Some tall, some short and all that. But where do coconut grow best in Ghana? in what soil and what are some of the regions you can mention? A very important question and you see um farming is supposed to be taken very serious and sometimes it baffles me when people get up one day probably make some money and you know they just want to plant something not to say I mean Ghana you can plant coconut everywhere but there are ideal locations there are there are places where it's better let me talk about the soil so with spoil soil you're looking at a well drained let me just well drained sandy soil okay and to say sandy soil I know when we went to JSS they thought about the properties of a sandy soil exactly where it's loose right it's not sticky you know it's not sticky it's loose it's it's it has a very low I mean low water retaining capacity what it means is it can drain water pretty fast okay um coconut does well in a well drained sandy soil Okay. And not to say that the other lands can't thrive well with coconut. It can. Okay. But then just say you want to do coconut on a very large commercial scale, thousand acres, 500 acres. These things are necessary. You can't just get up and say you have a,000 acre land. So you want to start planting coconut. So you just start. No. So I I believe that we need to do the right thing when it comes to agric. Okay. Because it's expensive, right? And we get frustrated when it doesn't work, but then because of the the things we take for granted, we have to be very careful when it comes to choosing a site for coconut. As I said, it's practically possible for coconut to thrive in any part of our country. But then you're looking at production, you know, you're looking at production. That's why specifically it stated that well drained sandy soil you know is best and ideal and to the regions the regions you know um it has to be a place where rainfall pattern is massive like you know a very good rainfall areas. So talking about the central the central regions and all that is ideal and that is where we get most of the coconut from the western regions as well they are all close to the coastal side. So realistically can conclude by saying yeah all the sand soil within those areas are almost you know not to say coconut doesn't do well let's say like a region coconut would do well over there but it's a bit different you barely find the right sandy you know the sea kind of land around region it's better to do it over there as well but on a large commercial farm you need to really take in consideration what kind of land and just to add up Um, it's not necessarily you have to do your test. Mhm. You see, Ghanaians, I realize cuz I meet a lot of farmers. Let me just tell you what happened about 2 weeks ago where a farmer, I call him a farmer. No, he doesn't live in Ghana. He lives in Canada. And um he got my contact. He called me and he's been calling me to go visit his farm. Okay. He has about 60 acre of coconut farm somewhere in Oda. And I couldn't make it cuz I was very busy. Yeah. So he was sent to Ghana somewhere in May and um he called me that when he comes if I can get opportunity to visit. So yeah I he came around and we visit his farm and to my surprise the things I saw over there was a bit like this is very serious you know and the farm is about six seven years and it's very poor. So from I think he got it wrong from from eating the seedlings. They got it wrong from the planting distance. They got it wrong with the soil. They got it wrong with everything. Oh my. So you see all the investment that he's putting he's put into this farm with the time and he is okay. He doesn't really need much. He's just excited to be a farmer. But then it's so depressing to to to go through something like this. So I think the right questions needs to be asked. You know the right soil needs to be you know used when you're getting into coconut farming. You just don't get up and say coconut does well. People can even plant coconut in water you know in water mashy areas. No you don't it's not done. Okay. You know coconut is just like any other tree just like cocoa. It needs a well like a well you know very good soil to go very well. Yeah. So I think that's a place where the soil is more sandy a very good pattern. Coconut needs a lot of water, you know. Not to say the water should be retained around the coconut, but the the soil should be able to drain a lot of water. It shouldn't hold the water. Exactly. All right. Right. So I'm sure you're seeing a lot of interviews about coconut on our channel but this has become very important for us to reiterate and you know educate you before because most of you are wasting money or losing very very good amount of money uh because you lack knowledge because you don't have the right people to buy from I'm going for a quick breather when I come back will tell me more about if I have just one acre and I want to go into coconut production or farming How many seedlings will I be needing to actually do my one acre farm? I'll be right back. Stay [Music] tuned. Thanks for staying. If you're just tuning in, you're watching the Ghanaian farmer. We encourage you to share your views globally. If you're watching us, you have any question, you have any contribution, share with us. But this is about how you can identify the quality, the right type of coconut seedling to buy for your farm. Don't go waste your money and come back crying. But before went on break, I was asking if I have just one acre, it's a test case and I want to go and plant, how many nuts are we looking at? Okay. So, an acre of coconut with a spacing of 7.5 m and that is actually an ideal spacing 7.5 m and that's about 25 ft. Okay. Will be able to accommodate about 705 trees. Okay. 70 to 75 trees, right? Uh most people come and they will tell you, I have an acre. I want to put about 120. You advise them no too much. It doesn't work that way. Okay? you know uh what you put on the ground is what you get. So that is the preferred and required you know um um um planting distance and the quantity that is used. So at a distance of um 7.5 m apart um um that's about 25 ft. Okay. You have close about 70 to 75 trees. Okay. On an acre of land. Okay. Is there a special way of planting coconut in the soil? Is there any special way? Yes. Um there isn't any special way you know I think when it comes to general farming a lot of people probably will show you how to do this how to do that but you would have to try and find something that works for you okay you see we don't have irrigations in Ghana we don't even irrigate our farms right so finding a means to plant coconut that will sustain it that will help a tribe better sometimes you would have to try and coin your own You understand? So what I do specifically usually I mean I consult for a lot of farms and I help them in planting their coconut you know coconut we even call coconut as um a thirsty tree cuz it needs water. Not to say that there there's supposed to be so much water around it but it needs water at least every 2 weeks after planting it needs to be watered. Okay. So um there isn't any special way of planting coconut. um sometimes when it comes to general farming. Yeah. And that as I said, I've been a farmer for the past 12 years. Every September was my 12th year. And sometimes my friends don't even believe that. You would have to find your own way. Coin your own way. Do things you think is working for you. You don't you don't just go out there and watch a video on YouTube someone doing something and you want to replicate that same thing. You know, the lands are different. M so try and find ways and means to to do things you think is benefiting you. So one of the things I do when I'm planting coconut is how I dig my hole. Okay. You know I dig the hole such that it's so big where I have a lot of space around it. Put the coconut in the middle. Yeah. Cover the soil. Yeah. Cover the coconut with the soil. But then there's still a lot of there's a lot of space around it. What does that do? See, we don't irrigate our fun. Yes. And see the rainfall patterns are pretty poor sometimes. So you need coconut. As I said, coconut is usually called the testy tree. It needs water to dry very well. So leaving that space around the coconut tree when it rains sort of like you have some water collected around it. So it means if it's not going to rain for even a month or even two weeks, you have that space around the coconut being very moist which will aid in proper growing of your coconut tree. Okay. So there isn't any kind of like special way of planting coconut but you do things that will help you things that will make your farm do well. So you need to find ways. As I said farming is not something you can learn and say you are done learning. You learn every day. You keep learning. You keep learning every day. So there isn't any special way as in somebody trying to tell you it can work. If somebody is trying to demonstrate something to you it mean the person have tried it but it doesn't mean when you try it it's going to work for you. Okay. So that is my way. try and dig the hole that big. Put the coconut in the middle. Leave a bit of space around it where there will be some water collected when it rains. At least if it's not raining. Yeah, it will still use that water. Okay, that's interesting. I've not seen that before, but I can't wait for him to demonstrate for us to see. That's a tip for you. So, when it come to the nursery, if I buy the nuts, how long does it take for me to start seeing the leaves shooting? Great. M so we start coconut by picking the dry nuts. Okay. Usually it's advisable that the nut drops themsel you know it's usually not advisable to climb the tree to pluck dry nuts. Um in terms you it has to be well dried before it can germinate. Okay. If it's not well dry it will never germinate. Okay. So usually when we go to some of the farms that we we we start our nurseries from M um usually we don't have enough nuts so we are forced to climb the trees to pluck some of the dry nuts and to our surprise um over times the nuts start gating even on top of the tree. Oh really? You can see it protrudes just a little bit. Okay. Whilst it's still hanging on the tree and then that's one of the difference between the hybrid and the non-hybrid seedlings. I think the hybrid seedlings have a very soft shell sort of where germinations are pretty easy. So if you happen to have a nut that is already germinated, it means easy to go. It means within some few months, it goes really fast. But the germination is a problem. There are times you can go under a typical tree, you have about let's say 100 nuts, dry nuts dropped. Yeah. Out of these 100 nuts, you can have let's say 30 germinated. Okay. And it's just natural. It's not something out of anything. Yeah. you know, so you have to notch it. Usually we call what we call notching. Notching is where we cut just a bit. Okay. Let's pick one that you've cut. So something like this. Okay. So we notch this coconut. You know, coconut has this shell. Yeah. Where when there's water poured on it, it will just drop off. They won't get into the coconut. You're trying to force water into the coconut to aid germination. Okay. So the whole idea of notching where we cut a bit of this space is to get water into the into the coconut where it can aid fast germination. Okay. Right. So when germination starts it takes close to about 6 months transplanting it gets to the height where you can transplant the coconut. Okay. So from let's say from the time you pick the nut to transplanting it's about 6 months. Okay. Yeah. So what it takes 6 month here before a farmer comes to buy. Exactly. Oh my I see. Okay. So when I'm coming to buy the nuts to go and transplant, what time of the day do you recommend I come by to to buy my nuts? Yeah. Um this is a general question where I'll answer for all tree crops. Okay. And these are the mistakes we do as farmers as well. Yes. Tree crops, you know, mostly predominantly in Ghana, we don't irrigate them. Okay. What it means is we plant them early part of the year when the rain setting. Yeah, there isn't any particular day as in planting in the morning or in the afternoon but it should be planted early I mean the month we know somewhere in April May we start getting rains in Ghana okay it's ideal to plant any tree okay be it rubber be it cocoa be it cashew coconut very early what you're trying to do is to help this tree crop to establish very well so it means when you plant them early let's say you plant it by May you're done planting your seedlings. It means it gets all the rains. That's you know we call them the Ghana we have the major rainy season and the minor. Exactly. So the major rainy season is usually between April, May, June, July. Then we have a bit of a drought. Then August, September, October, November we have the minor rainy season. So if you plan early, it means you have all this rain from you know May, June, July all the way through to about December. Yeah. So, you have a wellestablished tree crop, whether being coconut or cocoa or something like that. I I get a lot of people who come around somewhere, you know, in September and they want to buy seedlings to go plant cuz we start nursing seedlings somewhere September, October. That's when we start doing our preparations. And I tell them, it's not ideal because you're not sure cuz we are entering the minor, we are in the minor season and there's going to be drought. Yeah. So as to a specific time of planting, no but it needs to be planted early. At least your land preparation should start early. You know by January, February, March, you should be done. You with your land preparation by May you have to finish planting your seedlings. Okay? And that will help you have a very good um seedling growing for for you. But what if I have irrigation? That is also okay. But you know there is something different. There's a big difference between natural rainfall and irrigation. Yes, you can't 100% rely on irrigation, especially with tree crops, you know, it doesn't really need a lot of water. If you can add irrigation to your tree crops like coconut, there you go. It's excellent. It's ideal. You can you can you can it does really well. Okay, you know, but then because you don't want to spend so much money, sometime not say it's not necessary, it's very necessary if you have the finances to have an irrigated coconut farm. It's a plus for you. All right. But then if you plant it early and it's well established by November, December, why you don't even need any irrigation? In that case, how long then after my transplanting will I be waiting to start plucking and selling or enjoying my coconut? Yeah, I I get this question a lot. A lot of questions people come over here. My brother, how long am I going? You know, I heard there is one that even someone even said there's one that is even two years start getting coconut. Coconut. See, um And this not to say anything. Coconut as I said earlier thrives really well in sandy well drained sandy soil, right? And with the hybrid seedlings you're looking at between 3 to 5 years. 3 to 5 years. In my farms, in some of my farms, I demonstrated where when I planted the seedlings, yeah, when I transplanted, I took I took note of it when we did the transplant. Um in one of my farms about 5 acre farm like a plot where I demarcated and did the planting we realized that we had about 60% okay of the seedlings giving us flowers after the third year oh about 60% okay you see when somebody comes over here probably they want to buy like one seedling or two or three and buying three seedlings and planting them and expecting maybe for it to give you fruits in let's say three years and four years it's usually not realistic. I say it's not realistic because if you're doing a whole a whole plantation like a big farm you know the soil nutrients is completely different from each part of the soil like it's land you can have a big land but the nutrients at one particular spot is completely different you know so it's usually proper and ideal to have some quantity of seedlings where you can now be very sure that are these really good quality seedlings you can use one seedling or two seedling that you planted in your house as a yastic to say it's not a good quality seedling maybe the soil that you even planted the seedling on it it's not good it's not good quality right and you ask how long I said 3 to 5 years I know with the hybrid seedlings after the third year you see signs of flowers okay you see signs of flowers after the third year but let me add this it doesn't matter if you buy a hybrid seedlings and you don't go through the proper things you need to do for the coconut to thrive well. Okay. Everything needs to be met. You know, proper planting, everything has to be equal. All right. So, if everything is done well, I mean farming, somebody say farming is too risky. Of course it is. Everything is risky. Everything is risky everywhere. If you can do it right, if you can do it very well, be guaranteed that at least. And if you know you are buying a right proper seedling it's a very important and that's one of the things people neglect not just with coconut in everything we do having it being vegetables or anything you know you have people it all start from the seed. Exactly. You need the right seed to get the right you know I mean whatever the outcome is to get something better out of it. So why compromise on the on the on the initial initial I mean nursery you don't compromise. Cuz if you compromise on the nursery, everything you're doing, whether it's 2 years or 3 or 5 years, is all compromised. Struggle. Okay. Since you have a coconut farm, you should be in the best place to tell me how many fruits am I likely to get on one plant? And of course, what would be the lifespan of a coconut tree? So, um, ideally it varies from region to region. I said when I go to Ivory Coast where we start our nursing and I see the kind of farms they have with the kind of maintenance they are giving the farms and you see the typical coconut tree with a lot of nuts on it. I can't say you can have that same thing probably when you plant it. That's why I said it varies from origin. on the average when the coconut is starts after let's say the fifth year I mean it's so tender and so young on the tree to carry a lot of trees I mean coconut a lot of nuts at a time you know it's so tender it's still young so it can't hold a lot of I mean coconut you know coconut is very heavy exactly so when they are very young you don't expect much but in the full maturity we're looking at between let's say 5 to 15 years when the coconut is well established. You are confident that you should you shouldn't have anything less than 100 nuts in a year. Okay. In a year between 70 to 100 on one on one tree. Okay. 70 to 100 and it can go all the way to 150. I went to a farm and I counted not less than 120 120 nuts on each of the of the tree that I Oh yeah. Okay. I counted not less than 120 nuts right on each tree. But as I said, you can't say because you have 120 when you come by the seedlings and you go plant it, you also expect to have 120 your care, your maintenance, your farm practices. The soil is a big determinant. So it's not always about what you do. Sometimes you do everything right, but you still not get that, you know, expected um, you know, what you're looking for. You probably want to get 130 a tree, right? But then I know that at least a poor farm that is probably taken care of. I mean a poor soil that is well probably taken care of, the right fertilizer and all that. I mean I think you should probably get something above 70 to 100. Okay. Per tree for a year. Okay. A year. Okay. And the lifespan will be how long can a coconut tree coconut usually we call it the three generation. Three generation means when you plant it, your kids will come eat it and your kids kids will come eat it. Usually they say about 60 70 years but then it can go more than 100 years but you know in in in farming there's something called viability it's not economically viable after some years because probably you be giving it too much care too much attention where the fruit that is giving you can't complement how much you're making out of it so it becomes not economically viable at some point I mean I'm sure maybe after 70 80 years it's proper to probably start a farm all over Okay. Yeah. Okay. Do coconut need fertilizer and are there any specific fertilizer that coconut need? Yes, coconut needs fertilizers just like any other tree. Um people say yeah. But then um I think one of the easiest um um um fertilizers you can find around which is available is a chicken man. It responds so well to chicken. Okay. Yeah. Okay. I don't think it's a heavy feeder fertilizer. I don't think so. All right. That's why it's a very robust plant. That's why I like it. It's robust and it's not too difficult to do. Okay. So, with just a little fertilizer, as I said, you can do the some of the inorganic fertilizers. Okay. The MPKs are all good for coconut. But I prefer people doing more of the organic where they can embed a lot of the chicken manure around the coconut. You know, it keeps that space around the coconut very moist. Okay. Cuz it likes that. Yeah. So in as much as you can give it fertilizer like the NPKs like the 1515 it's also okay to give the organic money like inorganic man inorganic um fertilizers and to add it to butress it do you know we give coconut salt salt drink is it the big ones or the adan salt okay so you wonder why coconut thrive so well at the shop yeah exactly keta adan you have coconut and they are there for years. So coconut does well having given it salt because you probably will bring coconut to your farm, there's no salt content in the soil. So I I read extensively and I started doing it in my farm and I saw the response. A lot of people complain so much about my farm is not doing well. There are too many um um diseases here and there and I think salt is a cure. I see. It all depends on how you apply it apply it. We would go to his farm for him to show us that Exactly. Because um and this is something that um yeah I consult a lot sometimes for free. I like I love to do it and people have so many issues on their farms and I get there and it's something very simple simple okay something very simple to do you know and because usually they are not there and they leave the farm for farm managers to take care of them they're not able to identify this salt plays a very good role in coconut by applying it around the roots. Some you can even put a little bit of you grind it and put a little bit into the leaves. It does really well. Okay. You mentioned disease. Are there any disease that affected coconut? How do I prevent or cure it? Great. So um um coconut I realize usually predominantly it's um the root rot usually caused by fungus. Okay. Um coconut is sweet. So you have every every insect like you know even rodents Yeah. attacking coconut. It's a sweet I mean crop so you need to really take care of it very well. One of the diseases that I find easy attacking coconut is the root rot where usually when you're planting the seedling um you have a bit of termites and some you know in the soil. So they end up chewing the the the the root which to prevent the coconut from growing it ends up killing the coconut. So the root rot which there is a way to to to solve that issue with the root root rot and I see more of people complaining more of the wevils you know getting into the like you know the middle part of the coconut chewing the middle part that is supposed to germinate that's supposed to grow very well I mean there are easy ways to kill these things but then just to add it up I went to somebody's farm who was complaining about this issue of having you know chewing their coconut. But I go to the farm and the farm was all bushy. A lot of weeds. Okay. So you can't cail these weevils whilst you have a lot of weeds in your Exactly. Where do you expect the weevils to go when you treat them? The moment you treat them, they will just jump into the the next one. The bush. The bush where they will hide. Yes. So your coconut farm should be free. Okay. And it's a basic principle. The moment you can keep it weight free where there aren't many waste you won't have a lot of insects hiding into into the bush which will end up going into your coconut to to call it. So sometimes it's not really about focusing so much on the coconut, but it's about focusing so much on the kind of things you need to do in the farm, the maintenance, the reading, right? It's not really about the coconut cuz as as I said, the aronomic practices are very key. Okay. So once I have to wait for 3 years plus to start harvesting my first fruit, is there any form of or any type of crop I can intercrop with my coconut? And at what stage of the coconut am I allowed to do my intercropping? Very very good question. Very very good question. Um I understand Ghanaians usually don't have a lot of farm lands. Yeah. So they like to intercrop cropping we call it. Um yes coconut you can do some intercropping. Yeah. But it has to be some specific crops. Okay. And I would generalize by saying vegetables things like tubers like cava. Yum. Nope. Okay. I don't subscribe to those things because they are so heavy feeders on fertilizers. I mean sorry on nutrients on nutrients. So I usually don't subscribe people intercropping tubers or cripping plants like you know within coconut but anything like vegetables um vegetables like tomatoes, garden eggs, okra these can be planted within coconut. Okay. And it can be done right after you even plant plant a coconut, you know. But as I said, not to say that casaba will have anything bad on coconut. Yeah, I visit somebody's farm like that. He's planted co I mean casabas throughout his farm. Okay, he has a big farm and it was full of cassaba. And I told him, boss, it's not done. And he said, nothing has happened to my farm. And I said, nothing will happen to your farm. I'm not saying the cava will kill your coconut. It won't kill it but the cassava will deplete the soil so much that no matter no matter the fertilizer you introduce you introduce to the coconut it won't do well. Okay. You know there are some key nutrients in the soil that is not replenished. You can replenish them. It takes time. That's why we have what we call the pharaoh period in agriculture. Exactly. You just have to leave the soil to just stay on itself and it just regain it. You can never introduce any fertilizer to get that nutrients that is lacking in the soil. That's why I say it's not advisable to plant crops like cava, yam and other things in the coconut. Let me just backress by saying coconut needs sunlight. Okay, sunlight, plain sunlight. You go to people's farms and you see coconut under trees, under shades, coconut need at least 6 hours of sunlight. Okay. So it's not something you have to go through the processes and if you do it well you enjoy it. Are there any challenges associated with coconut uh production? Um just as I mentioned earlier with the diseases that can be eliminated somehow it can be controlled and it needs to be controlled early. Um apart from that I would say the drums um usually as I said you have to plan early. Yeah. So if you plan early your chances of having a successful farm is higher but then if you have to wait and plant start planting somewhere September October you know not to say it's bad but you're not sure exactly of the rain patterns. Yeah if you have irrigation that you asked earlier that is okay you can plant it and you know you can irrigate your your seedlings when you when you transplant them. So these are the challenges that people face. It's expensive. It's not cheap. M it's not cheap. So I not even the nurses farming is expensive and I expect people to do it right. Get it right from the start and you enjoy it. In as much there are frustrations in it. You don't want to be frustrated so much. So try take your time. If you're not ready, don't even start. I tell people if you're not ready, don't start. It's okay to say I want to start something small. But then have it in your mind that even that small thing is challenging. That small that you want to start is challenging. So be ready, be emotionally prepared before you get into into okay. I know you are into the farming and the nursery production but give and take. If you are asked to make a choice, will you stick to the nursery production and forfeit the farming or you you do the farming for you one not both. So I I I I I wasn't really looking forward to having a coconut nursery. Was never part of my plan. I never even envisaged or thought about it. Okay. Um so I remember somewhere 2020 when I started my nursery in my my time. Choose one. When I started my I had this agree director me and he saw my ne and he loved him. Okay. and he told me just do a lot of this and without you know and I was a bit hesitant but then I started doing it and it's giving me the opportunity to you know what advise people tell people what to do the farming practice and all that I'm sure if it was just my farm I wouldn't have that opportunity so it makes it very difficult and you need to have the farm okay and have the nursery to compliment because if somebody comes over here you usually I like them to visit the farm so they before they come. All right. Okay. How much is one? Call me. You don't have to say this on. Okay. Okay. Okay. So, so, so um let us know your location and how we can find you. So, we have we have three nursery sites. We have three nursery sites. One in Bas um not too far from We have one on the Asaman stretch. um that is at Samanu stretch and we have one in Kofaridia. Okay. So we have nursery sites in all these locations and we supply nationwide. Okay. Right. We supply nationwide. Um people within our inkling let's say within eastern region usually we do what we call free distribution free supply when you purchase from us some quantity. And um we also don't only sell we give consultancies. Okay. We advise people on what to do and um yeah, as I said, if you buy some quantity, you do free delivery. We do. Your number, please, so that we'll be able to reach out to you. 0537 22574 0537 22574 Yeah. And we're here for you. Okay. So, that's it. Thanks for mentioning the number and how we can reach out to you. But finally any tips or advice to give to those who are already in it, those who are yet to start so they can get it right because you had said it already. It's expensive being small or big farm. It is expensive. Yeah. Uh simply put, I would say get it right from the start. By getting it right, it means the right seedling. Ask the right questions when you're going to buy the seedlings, you know. Um everything not just even farming starts with the how you started but farming specifically is with respect to the seedling that you're planting being a plantain being a cocoa being a coconut so you need to get the seedling right the neur has to be right and when we say get it right I mean you don't really have a lot of control you probably won't have the opportunity to raise your own neur I did for myself that is really successful for me but then wherever ever it is you're purchasing your seedlings from, try and ask the right questions. Cuz if it's wrong, if you get it wrong, then you're doomed. Then it's going to be very difficult for you. So ask the right questions and and and I think you can be very successful at being I mean get into coconut farming. Yeah. And I I inreat I intreat people to get into it. Um as I said earlier that coconut happens to be one of the farms to me. I know people will dispute that that you can do and relax but that is if you can do it well well properly planned farm where you don't necessarily have to be in the farm always okay unlike some of the other tree crops I'm a cocoa farmer and I know what goes into cocoa it's tedious it's very difficult right rubber farm before I started tapping rubber is so tedious but coconut unfortunately is not that difficult and I I I relied on I I I say it's not difficult because of the things the processes that are put in place studing well planting well pegging well even the lining and pegging has been done very well and if all these are met you are in for for a very beautiful journey in coconut okay and um coconut is good I entreat people to go into it yeah okay so let's use just one acre for an example um how much am I likely to make out of one acre coconut farm. Wo. Wo. So, um, coconut I would say is lucreative, okay? Cuz it's a demanding commodity. You know, people drink coconut everywhere in Ghana and it's one of the things that I can bet you that when you plant it, you certainly get the market for it. So, um, like like I said earlier, an acre of coconut, you're looking at around 75 trees, 75 acres. And I said earlier that a tree can give you maximum. It can give you up to about 150. But being realistic, we can limit ourselves that okay, you're going to be a very good farmer. You go through all the right farming practices. So you're targeting to have at least 100 nuts per tree for your coconut. Let's just use that average. But as I said, it's not 100. It can be even less. That is depend on how you take care of your farm. But let's say you are a good farmer. You're going to go through the right processes and the right practices to probably get at least 100 per tree. So, simply you can multiply 100 nuts by 75 trees. When you do that, how much how much do you get? 100. Uh, please wait. You know me, I like money. 100 multiply by 75 trees. Hey, how much is that? How how many siblings are that? So, it means you're going to get what? 7, 500 nuts. Yes. A year. Yes. I don't know how much in Ara times I buy coconut for six cities. Ah, it's CD. Sometimes I buy five cities. No, it's CCD. Right now, they've read budget. Exactly. So, let's say let's say you're not even going to sell it yourself in you just looking for let's say half of money. So, you're probably going to sell it for even half of that price for three cities. So, multiply 7,500 by three by three. Hey, it means you have what? 22,500 per acre of coconut. And this is you doing an acre five trees. So if you want to do let's say 50 acres. Yes. You multiply 22500 by 50. How much do you get? Hey 1 billion. One means you make 1 million 1 million 1 million00. The G people say 1 million. Exactly. It means you can make a million cities out of coconut. 50 acre coconut farm. But there are conditions to it. Of course it's not that it's not magic. have 50 acres and you make 1 million cities, you can make a million cities out of a 50 acre coconut farm. But it all depends on what you do to the your management. The management is a key. It plays a key role in your success. Okay. Yeah. All right. So, you know what we're going to do? I'm going to organize a webinar forwame and myself so we can delve detail because there are still questions I wanted to ask him. you know this goes live on TV here in Ghana and then you watch the rest on YouTube so let's consume this information okay and then we would organize a webinar for uhwame he has rubber he has coconut cocoa and many other things let's do a webinar so he enlightening us all the questions you have you would meet him one on one and then we'll conclude with my name is Nam this has been the Ghanaian farmer his number was mentioned in the interview take your time pick the number call him and he'll be there to help you. Thank you very much for watching. Thank you very much for having us. Thank you. [Music]",
