1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,180
this was the first Pastor that Dad and I

2
00:00:03,120 --> 00:00:08,400
introduced rotating to introduce that

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,800
into our operations that was kind of an

4
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,320
eye-opener for my father because he was

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:15,839
one of them old school you just turn

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,900
them out they'll do their thing it took

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,699
him a few years because I'd turn out the

8
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,560
same time and my calves would always

9
00:00:20,699 --> 00:00:25,500
come home bigger because the weaning

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,420
weights as far as rotational grazing is

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:31,519
just phenomenal that's been a

12
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,519
significant boost to our operation
