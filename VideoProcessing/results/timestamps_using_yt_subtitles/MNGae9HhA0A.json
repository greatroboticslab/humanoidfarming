  "text": "[Music] [Music] farmers often ask whether they can combine their inoculant with seed applied pesticides when they're sowing their legumes in fact this was a leading issue when we did a survey a number of years ago that farmers really wanted to know more about this topic so we're doing some research on this at the university of adelaide and we're part way through that research what we've found so far is that of the fungicides and the insecticide that we've tested that thyram is particularly toxic to the inoculant bacteria so we haven't found any inoculant bacteria that are not killed by thyram and also this goes to p pickle tea which contains thyram as an active ingredient plus evershield which is almost the same as p pickle tea so thyram and people tea are the two seed applied pesticides to watch for and we have some evidence from the lab and also from the field that the fungicides quite toxic to the bacteria and can reduce nodulation substantially so what we're suggesting is that farmers separate out the inoculant from the seed by putting either a granule in furrow or putting a liquid stream in furrow if they've got the capability of doing that either a peat slurry or a suspension of the easy rise freeze-dried bacteria in 2018 we did a field trial on the air peninsula at the minipa in the manipur region and the treatments consisted of peas coated with fungicide pickle tea or not coated with pea pickle tea then we added a peat formulation of inoculant or a freeze-dried formulation of inoculant called easy rise and we put the inoculant on either 24 hours before sowing or one or two hours before sowing really the only treatment that gave us decent nodulation was peach with no fungicide the other treatments just failed to deliver on nodulation and in fixation in that field trial the fungicide was quite detrimental to nodulation the other thing to note about that trial was that the conditions were really dry so we think that having that dry soil stress plus the pesticide stress on seed the combination of that really affected the nodulation and in fixation if a farmer does really want to coat the seed after applying the fungicide we've got a number of suggestions as to how to cope with that stress one is to double the number of bacteria double the dose of bacteria on the seed so we get a better chance of good nodulation and to sow as soon as possible after coating the inoculant because that will also lead to greater numbers surviving so into moist soil if you possibly can as ideal conditions and also finally go into a paddock where you've already grown that legume and have that inoculant before so you'll get a decent background to start with we hope so that should minimise any problems of the toxicity [Music] you",
