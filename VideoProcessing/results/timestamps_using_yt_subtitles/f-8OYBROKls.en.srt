00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,240
in this country

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,200
in the last 70 years many achievements

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:09,120
are there

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
we have built businesses we have built

6
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:13,599
industry our scientists

7
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:14,400
are going to mars but of all these

8
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,760
things

9
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,960
the most significant achievement for us

10
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:23,519
is that our poor farmer

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,560
without any infrastructure hardly any

12
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:26,800
technology

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,000
just with traditional knowledge he's

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
been feeding

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:31,199
over a billion people this is not a

16
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,330
small thing

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:36,079
but we are taking that away from him

18
00:00:33,330 --> 00:00:39,360
[Music]

19
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:41,760
today go out and ask anybody any farmer

20
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,480
how many of them want their children to

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:47,440
go into farming

22
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,760
it is less than 15 percent in another 20

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,320
years 25 years you will see

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,190
you will not know how to grow food in

25
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:54,719
this country

00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,760
[Music]

27
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,600
in the last 12 years three lakh farmers

28
00:00:57,760 --> 00:01:03,600
have committed suicide

29
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:06,720
even in a war that many people don't die

30
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:08,080
this is happening essentially because of

31
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,360
the investment

32
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,640
that goes into irrigation projects and

33
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:16,640
inability to access market i was just

34
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,200
talking to a tamilnadu farmer

35
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,080
who is 27 years of age he says he has

36
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:26,640
sunk nine

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:28,720
borewells in three and a half acres

38
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,079
he's never going to make it he has to

39
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,920
either sell the land

40
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:34,560
or run away from the village or hang

41
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,560
from a tree

42
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,119
it's very important that farming is made

43
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,920
into an attractive process

44
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,920
economically very attractive process so

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,880
that youth will get engaged

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:49,040
with farming this will only happen if

47
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:51,520
the irrigation and the marketing large

48
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:54,159
companies take it up

49
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:55,040
these two things can never be addressed

50
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,640
unless

51
00:01:55,040 --> 00:02:01,840
there is scale one reason

52
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:04,159
why rural population can never scale up

53
00:02:01,840 --> 00:02:06,479
is because the land holdings are so

54
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,479
small

55
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:11,360
with that level of land there is no way

56
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:14,720
to invest

57
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,920
or to organize or to you know be able to

58
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,640
leverage the market

59
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:20,080
there is no possibility so one solution

60
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,520
that we are asking for

61
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:26,319
is to form large-scale farmers producers

62
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,319
organizations

63
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,599
see if let us say ten thousand farmers

64
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,400
came together

65
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,160
as a farmer's producers organization if

66
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,840
ten thousand farmers came together

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:41,280
let's say on an average three four acres

68
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:43,920
if they own also it's 30 40 000 acres

69
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,760
this does not mean integration of land

70
00:02:43,920 --> 00:02:48,239
just aggregation of irrigation

71
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:49,360
and aggregation of marketing forces and

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,400
aggregation

73
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:54,000
of value addition aspects of the

74
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,160
agricultural produce

75
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:57,120
if land is properly demarcated and

76
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,000
irrigated and

77
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,760
irrigation is managed by a company

78
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,640
nearly 500 million people

79
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:05,760
they will be available for ancillary

80
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:08,319
alternate

81
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,760
and value addition activity if you

82
00:03:08,319 --> 00:03:10,800
provide the necessary skills and

83
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:13,200
opportunities

84
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:13,920
and bank loans and stuff you will spawn

85
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:19,840
a whole

86
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,840
revolution in the rural india

87
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:25,200
and if marketing is also taken over by

88
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:27,680
companies which are capable of doing

89
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:28,640
this far more focuses on just producing

90
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
food

91
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:34,720
it is very easy within three years time

92
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:35,360
that you can multiply agricultural

93
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
income

94
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:38,879
in terms of economic value at least by

95
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:39,920
300 percent

96
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,239
and we've been appealing to the

97
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,959
government because in this country

98
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:45,760
individual agricultural income is not

99
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:47,519
taxed

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,440
but if you organize yourself as a

101
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:50,080
farmer's producers organization you get

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:52,640
30

103
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,680
tax fortunately in this budget they

104
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:56,000
responded

105
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,319
that the tax on the fpo has been taken

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:58,319
away

107
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,720
we have a farmer's producer organization

108
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,280
here coimbatore i gave

109
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:07,200
three young people three smartphones

110
00:04:05,280 --> 00:04:10,159
they just renegotiate the produce

111
00:04:07,200 --> 00:04:11,340
every day with this the farmer's income

112
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,520
has doubled

there are many things to be done on the

ground but if we handle this one thing

119
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:17,440
india's economy the agricultural economy

120
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:21,120
can go up 200 to 300

121
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:21,120
in a matter of three to four years time

122
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:26,000
an enhancement of rural economy means

123
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:28,960
enhancement of economic possibilities

00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,440
for 65 percent of india's population

125

00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:41,360
have to pitch in

131
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:43,360
and this will be lucrative for the

132
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
corporates this will be

133
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:47,039
very fulfilling for the social

135
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,320

india

141

right

143
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:07,840

coming five years

149

150
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:24,400
that we mentioned to be a part of this

151
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:36,000
and see how we can make this happen in

this country you
