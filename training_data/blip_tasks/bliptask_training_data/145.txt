What steps are needed to perform this task: Adjusting irrigation scheduling based on evapotranspiration
Use an evapotranspiration (ET) calculator or weather station Input current weather data, including temperature and humidity Adjust the runtime of irrigation systems to account for ET rates Make changes to the schedule in real-time to optimize water use
