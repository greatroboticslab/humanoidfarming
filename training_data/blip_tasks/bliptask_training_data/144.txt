What steps are needed to perform this task: Checking-for cualquier cosa hay que verificar
I’m not sure what task is being referred to here. The original statement “checking for cualquier cosa hay que verificar” translates to “checking for anything that needs to be verified” in Spanish. Given the lack of context, this is unclear and possibly irrelevant to physical tasks on the farm. Therefore, I will omit this task.
