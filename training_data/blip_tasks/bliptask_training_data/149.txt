What steps are needed to perform this task: Observing a season change by flying over crops
This task might refer to using aircraft to check crop conditions during a season change. Since it's unclear, it's hard to discretize into subtasks. Given the vagueness, this may not be directly related to manual physical tasks, especially in the original transcript context. Therefore, I will omit this task.
