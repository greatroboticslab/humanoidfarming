That includes cleaning teats, placing the machine, letting down the milk, collecting into jars, and then to the bulk tank. Then after milking, they deal with the calves and other chores. Finally, start milking again in the evening. The thank you at the end is probably a general thank you for watching, so maybe a separate subtask for that. The mention of Gloria's calf might just be a part of routine where they spend extra time with the calf, which is a chore but maybe a bit more personal.",
