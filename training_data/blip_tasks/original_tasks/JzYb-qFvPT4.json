                "Understand precision farming department functions \u2013 Eric highlights the precision farming department's role in Johnson Tractor, which has grown from part-time to two full-time staff and an intern.",
                "Recognize growth of precision farming team \u2013 The department has expanded over three years, indicating increasing demand for precision farming expertise.",
                "Explain integration of precision farming into tractor systems \u2013 Precision farming is becoming a standard feature, akin to other tractor components, requiring technicians to know how monitors and other equipment interact.",
                "Describe custom solutions for specialty crop farmers \u2013 The team provides tailored solutions, such as shutoff controls, to prevent waste in expensive crops like seed corn.",
                "Address cost considerations for premium crops like seed corn \u2013 Farmers use shutoff controls to avoid overlapping and wasting expensive inputs (e.g., seed corn) to protect their investments.",
                "Implement row shutoff controls for efficient planting \u2013 New technologies simplify row shutoff procedures, allowing operators to set up hoppers and plant without frequent manual adjustments."
