                "After reviewing the video transcript, the tasks related to physical activities involved in farming include unloading hay from a truck into a barn, entering and exiting the barn, inspecting hay quality, feeding livestock, and operating a tractor with a hay bailer. Specific subtasks include approaching the barn door, securing the hay bailer, raising and maneuvering it into the barn, inspecting hay for spoilage, retrieving feeders, stacking hay, and attaching/detaching equipment to a tractor. These tasks reflect the direct physical labor involved in hay management and livestock care on a farm. Answer: MAINTASK: Unloading hay from a truck into a barn. SUBTASK: Approach the open barn door.
