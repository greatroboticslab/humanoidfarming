So I generalized it as farm tasks using standing terms. However, realizing this is homeowner-specific, I shifted the tasks to the appropriate categories. Given the lack of direct farming reference, the output will purely be tasks from the transcript related to entering a contaminated area with protective clothing, spraying chemicals, waiting, then exiting and using steam, which resembles farm work such as applying treatments or sanitizing equipment.",
