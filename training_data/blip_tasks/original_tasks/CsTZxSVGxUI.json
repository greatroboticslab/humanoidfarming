They have to assess water demands during droughts (SUBTASK) and use natural sources like a creek (SUBTASK). A reservoir is constructed to store 140 acre feet (SUBTASK), and they pump water into it when the creek is full (SUBTASK). Then use that stored water for crops when it's needed (SUBTASK). Also mentioned that this could benefit small farmers and towns (SUBTASK). All these involve physical tasks related to setting up and maintaining irrigation systems, so they should be included as subtasks under the main task of water harvesting for irrigation."
