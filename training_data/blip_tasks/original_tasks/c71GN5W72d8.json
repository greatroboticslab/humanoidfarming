            "task": "\"Given this transcript, please generate a list of physical tasks a person would have to perform with their body in relation to the transcript.\" Then, the actual transcript is \"Look at that.\" So, the transcript is short. So given that, we can only really infer a minimal amount of tasks. Therefore, the main task is to observe, and the subtask is to look. That's it. Unless \"Look at that\" is referring to some specific action in farming. But since the user didn\u2019t specify the context of the video, maybe they expect that main task to observe some agricultural thing. So that's why I wrote MAINTASK: Observe a farming activity, and the subtask to look at it.",
