The main tasks are planting seeds, checking crops, applying fertilizer, operating a combine harvester, driving a truck, and using a sprayer. Each main task is broken down into specific subtasks that require physical action, such as walking, observing, manipulating equipment, and so on. The response includes all the actions mentioned in the transcript and additionally infers some necessary steps based on typical farming practices. The use of \"MAINTASK\" and \"SUBTASK\" labels follows the specified format. The scenario is clearly relevant to physical farming tasks, so instead of the alternative instructions, the relevant tasks are extracted."
