Under Task 1, subtasks include recognizing Earth's water composition, challenges in distribution, agricultural usage, and the role of climate change. Subtasks for Task 2 focus on blockchain technology for water systems, historical data tracking, and the need for international cooperation. These tasks collectively outline the key aspects discussed in the transcript regarding water scarcity and potential solutions.",
