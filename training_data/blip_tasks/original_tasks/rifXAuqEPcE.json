Relevant physical tasks a person would need to perform include operating an electric tractor (MAINTASK), such as steering, attaching tools, and driving equipment (SUBTASKs). Tasks also include preparing and sowing cover crops using a seed drill or mower (SUBTASKs), managing weeds through mechanical and chemical methods (SUBTASKs), irrigating crops during dry periods (SUBTASK), and monitoring environmental conditions affecting yield (SUBTASK). Additionally, tasks related to farm management involve operating a CSA program (MICY TASK), coordinating member involvement (SUBTASK), rotating fields and integrating livestock (SUBTASKs), as well as processing value-added products like fermented vegetables (MAINTASK involving SUBTASKs like collecting and fermenting vegetables, ensuring food safety, and distributing products). Soil testing and analyzing organic matter (SUBTASK) contribute to broader farm management and sustainability goals (MAINTASK). Tasks are structured to reflect the physical labor involved in sustainable agriculture practices and farm operations."
