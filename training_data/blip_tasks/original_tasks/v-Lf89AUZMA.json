Then the subtasks would be to read the book and write the list. But since the book isn't shown, the viewer can't physically do that unless they get the book. Hmmm. So it's a bit of a loop. If the MAINTASK is to read the book, then the subtask could be creating a plant list, but that seems beyond the scope of the original video.",
