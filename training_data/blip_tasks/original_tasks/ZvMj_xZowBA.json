Subtasks include container selection, location, organic soil, spacing, watering, drainage, and pest monitoring. Additionally, the benefits (mobility, reduced water, easy pest management) can be noted, but as ancillary information. Community engagement (comments, subscribing) is more of the video's goal, not physical tasks. Hence, the answer should focus on the actual activities a person would perform. However, when I created the original answer, I included the three tasks with subtasks as per the direction. Let me confirm:",
