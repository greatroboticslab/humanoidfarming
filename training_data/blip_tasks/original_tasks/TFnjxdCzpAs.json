The focus is on the conservation practices which involve hands-on tasks like diverting water, building structures for storage, applying plans, etc. Therefore, breaking it down as above makes sense. If someone was to create such a list of tasks for a video on these topics, these would be the key ones. Then, for each task, you could outline more specific steps. However, since the user asked to just generate tasks, this should suffice. The answer includes the MAINTASKs and SUBTASKs as described."
