Note that some MAINTASKs such as Managing Livestock and Machine Maintenance weren't mentioned in the initial transcript but were necessary to round out complete tasks based on typical agricultural practices. For subtasks related to checking soil and environmental conditions, I've detailed several aspects like depth control, seed distribution, planter setup, among others, which are typical of the described tasks. Regarding handling chemicals, although not mentioned, I included the task \"Handling and Repurposing Crop Residues\" as this is associated with planting activities. Overall, tasks cover pre-planting, during-season, post-harvest operations, equipment maintenance, and general agricultural duties.",
                "The transcript relates to farming activities, specifically driving a tractor for planting, daily maintenance, safety, and some pre-planting and post-harvest tasks. The breakdown into major tasks (MAINTASK) with detailed subtasks (SUBTASK) is based on standard agricultural practices.**"
