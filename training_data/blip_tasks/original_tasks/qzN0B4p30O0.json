Therefore, accept the MAINTASK/Dancing on a farm with animals and each dance move as subtasks. At the same time, in the transcript\u2019s relevance check, note that the video is framed in a farm setting but the tasks are dancing, which is not directly linked to agriculture. However, the instructions require that tasks should be based on the transcript, so regardless of actual relevance, the focus should be on the dance moves listed.",

            "task": "the main task could be leading the animal dance on the farm. So human is leading the animals, which requires direction. Hence, MAINTASK: Leading an animal dance on the farm. Subtasks would be giving commands (e.g., \"Gallop, gallop\") which the animals perform. The person is giving direction as part of the dance. However, the transcript doesn't indicate that the humans are directing, just that someone (Daddy) is saying \"More little animals\" after each dance. Maybe a parent is leading the children, but the primary action is following the dance steps. Therefore, possibly I need to consider that subtasks include not just the movements but also following the beat or commands. If a person is to perform this in real life, they have to both follow the choreography and maybe also participate in the group movement.",
