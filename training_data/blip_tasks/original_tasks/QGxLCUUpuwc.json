Wait, but is maintaining eye contact a physical task? That might be more of a social cue. Hmm. Let me check whether the behavior of the speaker is described. The transcript just has \"Thank you\" repeated. So I might have to base the tasks on typical expressions of gratitude. So when someone says thank you, they often make eye contact, lean forward slightly, nod, smile, raise their arms if it's more enthusiastic. So each of those could be considered a task. So the main task would be to express gratitude (with multiple subtasks), including the non-verbal gestures."
