                "Received video transcript. The transcript describes a series of agricultural tasks performed during a day in a farm. The main activities include operating and maintaining farm equipment, such as a hay baler, tractor, and sprayer; handling hay bales (loading, moving, stacking); tending to livestock (hay feeding, water checking, pasture observation); adjusting equipment to soil and weather conditions (fence repair, irrigation, pest control); general farm management (checking hay moisture, applying fertilizer, crop monitoring). Given the detailed content, I've structured the video's key tasks into specific physical actions a person would perform. Each MAINTASK corresponds to a main activity, with SUBTASKs breaking down the physical steps involved. For example, \"Operating a tractor\" encompasses starting the engine, attaching equipment, and driving through fields. The sub-tasks follow a logical sequence of what a farm worker would need to do. The hay-related tasks (loading, unloading, stacking) involve assessing bale size, lifting, walking, and precise carrying. Livestock care includes feeding, checking water, and observing behavior. The crop management tasks (weeding, irrigation, fertilizer application) require specific techniques like cutting weeds, distributing water, and applying chemicals. Repair tasks (fence, machine) involve locating issues, gathering materials, and executing repairs. The support tasks (attaching trailer, tire pressure check) are also included. However, the transcript mentions \"hay going through a baler,\" but if there's no explicit setup or operation described, maybe that part was just background. Also, the hay steering through the baler might be part of the baler's operation, not a task the person does. A second thought: since the video shows a day in the life of a farmer, including various tasks, the list provided includes a wide range of agricultural activities involving physical labor. The tasks are diverse but likely represent typical day-to-day responsibilities. To confirm relevance, since the transcript is about a farm, all the tasks relate to farming or agricultural operations, matching the initial instruction. Therefore, I've categorized all identified tasks under MAINTASKs, each requiring physical action and relevant to agricultural work. If there were any non-agricultural activities, they might not be included here, but given the entire transcript is about a farm environment, the entire list is valid."
