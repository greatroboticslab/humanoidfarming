                "operating a forklift would include checking the load, driving to the trailer, making sure the bales are secure. These are physical actions that involve the person's body. Similarly, with the sprayer, they would need to be in the aircraft (if aerial sprayer) or on the ground with the sprayer. The milking machine requires them to physically attach to the cow, operate the machine, clean up afterwards. Right, all these involve physical tasks that the person has to perform with their body. The tasks need to be relatable to the transcript. So going through the list above, I think all these are relevant if they're part of agricultural activities. Let me check if there's any other tasks mentioned in the transcript I might have missed. Let me recall: the initial part was about moving bales with a forklift, then loading them onto a trailer. Then it talked about loading hay into a silo. Then planting corn, applying herbicide, harvesting soybeans, planting wheat, testing pH, milking cows, preparing hay (maybe piling/stacking?), applying fertilizer, building berms, repairing pipes, operating a seed planter, cultivating corn, terminating cover crops. The roller coaster for terminating cover crops \u2013 yeah, that's a tool I've heard of in agronomy. Each of these is a separate physical task that someone might perform on a farm. For example, operating a combine to harvest soybeans would include driving the combine into the field, setting up the header, operating the threshing mechanism, cleaning the grain, etc. Maybe unloading grain, but that's part of the task. But combining would typically involve on-farm storage or transport, so okay. Similarly, constructing earth berms \u2013 building them is a physical task that involves manual labor or machine operation depending on scale. Repairs, especially on farms, involve soldering, welding, or general mechanical work. So even repairs would be on the list. Let me also think: the user said \"physical tasks a person would have to perform with their body.\" This rules out tasks that are, say, administrative or only require supervision. For example, debugging computer systems wouldn't be included. So all tasks need to involve physical labor. So moving bales, climbing silos, driving tractors, operating equipment like sprayers or combines, milking cows, handling livestock \u2013 all these are physical tasks where you have to use your body. The transcript seems to cover a wide range of agricultural activities, so that makes it easy; each activity is a potential main task. Now, what's the format for the answer? The user says \"Final Answer:\" followed by the list of maintasks and subtasks. Each maintask starts with \"MAINTASK:\" followed by the main task description, then subtasks start with \"SUBTASK:\" underneath. Each subtask should be a specific action related to the main task. So making sure each subtask is something a person needs to do physically. For example, under \"operate a forklift,\" subtasks include sitting in seat, starting engine, operating forks, driving, lowering, and securing. Okay, this seems right. Let me check the original instruction again: \"Please generate a list of physical tasks a person would have to perform with their body in relation to the transcript.\" So the list should be of physical tasks, no non-farming tasks. So far, all the tasks derived from the transcript relate to agriculture, so I don't think we need the \"!!!TRANSCRIPT_IRRELEVANT\" thing. So once I verify each task is farming-related and physical, I can input them here. I need to do this systematically. Let's go through each task I listed earlier:",
