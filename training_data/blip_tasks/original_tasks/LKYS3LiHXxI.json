                "Check tire pressure or condition? (The original mention was of installing a new tire, but in MAINTASKs linked to driving or general tasks, like driving the tractor, we don't specify tasks about maintaining the tractor, unless the tractor had a specific issue requiring a new tire. For the final MAINTASKs, perhaps it's better to not mention specific maintenance activities except in individual SubTasks. If you want to combine that, then you might want to clarify. If you opt to have tasks at a higher level of generality, then perhaps Firewood collection and storage is a MAINTASK, with SubTasks of cutting and stacking. If newness of the tire was a part of a different task, like preparing the tractor for work in the fields, so an embedded subtask, then maybe this original point is supplementary. Given the transcript mentions Dima is tired, and you listed the likely reasons for his tiredness, the way his day was divided into parts: home (breakfast), cows (milk, clean, feed, inseminate), field work (plant, weed, irrigation), orchard, chickens, honey making, hay, maintenance, driving, cleaning, check health, firewood cutting, etc. Therefore, these are the separate tasks that tie back to the fatigue. It's essential to note that the motor actions described in the subtasks correspond to physical tasks Dima would have to perform in a day of farm work, based on the transcript. To make sure that the mentioned tasks are physically demanding. For a majority of these, moving heavy equipment like tractors, leading cattle, managing various crops, repairing tasks, and manual labor in gardening and orchards contribute significantly to fatigue. Additionally, the coordination required for artificial insemination, handling bees, and other specific farming practices would require attention to detail and physical strain, which can contribute to someone being tired."
