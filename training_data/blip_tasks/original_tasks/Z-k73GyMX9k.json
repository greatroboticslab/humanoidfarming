            "task": "how they're grown, how to grow them, their uses. So the main tasks would be planting, growing, and using the peppers. Let me break it down. First, there's a bunch of tasks related to planting and caring for the plants. That would be one main task. Then, once they're grown, there's using them in cooking. Hmm. So I should list the planting and care tasks under one maintask, then harvesting and cooking under another. Let me check: the transcript mentions starting seeds indoors, which is planting, then taking care of them until they're mature. Then harvesting and using them. So two maintasks? Or combine them? Think: Each main task should represent a general category. Starting seeds and transplanting are part of initial setup and ongoing care. Maybe combine them under \"Growing Sriracha Pepper Plants\"? Then the culinary uses are another main task. That seems right. So MAINTASK: Planting and caring for Sriracha pepper plants (with subtasks like starting seeds, transplanting, watering, etc.) Then MAINTASK: Using Sriracha peppers in the kitchen (subtasks like stir-fries, sauces, pickling). Also, the transcript mentions that they're easy to grow but need the right conditions. So part of \"caring\" would be ensuring proper conditions, like sun and soil. Probably good. Additionally, there's a bit about pest resistance and companion planting. Maybe those are subtasks under care? Yeah, because pest management and companion planting are part of maintaining plant health. Okay, so that gives me tasks for planting, ongoing care including pest control, and then harvesting and using. Let's tally that.",

            "task": "one for growing and caring (with subtasks like planting, pest management, watering), and one for culinary uses (harvesting and using in recipes). Maybe also mention that starting seeds is part of growing. So MAINTASK: Planting and caring for Sriracha pepper plants: then could have subtasks like starting seeds in trays, transplanting to garden, spacing plants, mulching, regular watering, companion planting, pest control, harvest timing. Then MAINTASK: Using Sriracha peppers in cooking: subtasks like harvesting, preparing for different uses (sauces, stir-fries, pickling, etc.), and preserving. Then I also need to check if the transcript mentions fertilizer, but it doesn't. It's more about soil conditions and perhaps regular watering, which isn't fertilizing. But under \"Watering\" could imply fertilizing is part of it? Wait, but the transcript doesn't specify. It just says to keep the soil moist. So you would water regularly, which might involve fertilizers, but the transcript isn't specific. So maybe I shouldn't include fertilizing as a separate task here. For the purposes of this exercise, we have to create tasks based purely on the transcript's information. Since the transcript doesn\u2019t mention fertilizing, we can skip it. If in reality, you would need to fertilize, but it's not part of the given information, so we shouldn't include it.",
