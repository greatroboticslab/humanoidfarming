                "Explain the center pivot system, including its circular coverage area and linear move variations.",
                "Compare the pressure requirements of different sprinkler systems (e.g., big gun vs. impact sprinklers).",
                "Discuss system components such as main lines, laterals, and sprinkler nozzles, and their spacing.",
                "Outline design objectives for sprinkler irrigation systems, including uniform application, required depth of application, and avoiding soil runoff.",
                "Explain the importance of uniformity in application and how it affects deep percolation and runoff.",
                "Highlight the trade-offs between system economics and performance in different agricultural settings."
