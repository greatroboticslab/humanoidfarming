The tasks are directly related to farming, specifically combine operation, which is a critical aspect of grain harvesting. Therefore, the final list of MAINTASKs and SUBTASKs are presented above. Considering the answer, and that the key was to \"generate a series of *physical* tasks a person would have to perform with their body\", and the transcript maybe being cut-off, but likely referring to a combine operation, here's the answer."
