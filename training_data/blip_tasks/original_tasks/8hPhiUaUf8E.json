Then MAINTASK: Provide content creation feedback. SUBTASKS: Acknowledge viewers, invite questions. That seems to flow. So the transcript is relevant to farming, specifically greenhouse operations, so no need to flag it as irrelevant. The user is talking about crop protection (the greenhouse) in a farming context."
