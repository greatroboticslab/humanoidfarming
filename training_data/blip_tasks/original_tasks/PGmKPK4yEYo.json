                "The process involves selecting the right wire, surveying the area, trenching, attaching the wire to valves, protecting the connections, and testing. The wire must be buried directly without conduit, protected from damage, and connections must be waterproof. Testing is done by isolating each wire to identify its corresponding zone. The video includes branding and customer support promotions. However, the main focus is on the physical tasks of setting up the irrigation system."
