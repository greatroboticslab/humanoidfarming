Then people started following. So I would generate content that makes fun of him being clueless, but acting like a farmer. But in the end, people were interested because it was an unexpected image. Maybe there's market for parody or satire around fitness influencers/unrealistic physiques interacting with farm life. That's a niche, but there might be some niche.farmtwitter or something",

However, since the original transcript is mostly about the idea, reactions, and success of the content, perhaps even the described physical activity is more conceptual. It's challenging to find clear physical tasks, so given the instructions, I might have to default to recognizing it as irrelevant or, if necessary, to flag it.",
