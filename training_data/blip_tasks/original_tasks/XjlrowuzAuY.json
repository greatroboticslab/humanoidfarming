Wait, the transcript mentions \"Great good\" at the end, but that's probably just encouragement or agreement. So the main points are operating equipment and managing the farm. Let me confirm: Susan is a farmer, her show is \"Working Our Best,\" so she does physical tasks involving farming, and she also manages her team. Therefore, the two main tasks would be: operating farming equipment (with subtasks of driving, planting, maintaining) and managing the farm (subtasks of communication, crop management, operations), and maybe even decision-making.",
