            "task": "MAINTASK: After transcribing the video's discussion on grain drying, storage, and safety, I synthesized a series of physical tasks essential for farmers. These tasks cover grain handling from harvest to storage, emphasizing dry-down methods, safety measures, and monitoring grain conditions. Subtasks include assessing moisture levels using meters, determining optimally dry harvesting times, employing various drying techniques, and safely storing grain with proper aeration and monitoring systems. Additionally, the transcript highlights the importance of preventing slips and falls, adhering to lockout/tagout procedures, and managing confined space hazards. These tasks and subtasks are directly relevant to the agricultural practices discussed, ensuring a practical guide based on the speakers' expertise.",
            "subtasks": [
                "** Monitor crop maturity and moisture content regularly.",
                "** Reference weather forecasts and growing degree days for dry-down estimates.",
                "** Adapt drying strategies based on current and predicted weather conditions (e.g., October's prospects).",
                "** Harvest corn, soybeans, and sunflower at 13% moisture for soybeans, adjusting proactive drying methods.",
                "** Wait for optimal conditions if drying rates are insufficient (e.g., November).",
                "** Plan drying costs and propane availability during peak harvest (e.g., late October/early November).",
                "** Utilize high-temperature dryers for corn, limiting to 21% moisture to prevent over-drying.",
                "** Employ natural air drying for soybeans and sunflower in favorable October conditions.",
                "** Calculate energy costs for propane-powered dryers (0.022 per bushel per point).",
                "** Monitor grain temperature and moisture levels at least every two weeks.",
                "** Prevent mold growth by managing cutting room and fire hazards.",
                "** Schedule winterposed aeration and grain movement in spring-drying scenarios.",
                "** Use ground-open access lids for safe bin entry (if available).",
                "** Implement lockout/tagout procedures for grain handling equipment maintenance.",
                "** Prepare safety harnesses and lifelines when working at heights.",
                "** Address confined space hazards through regular inspections and training.",
