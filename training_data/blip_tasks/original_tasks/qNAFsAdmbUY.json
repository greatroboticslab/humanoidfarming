She mentions a lot of tasks related to farm management, especially in preparation for bad weather. I need to break this down into tasks that a person would have to do\u2014probably the farmer or someone on the farm. Let\u2019s start with the main task, which is developing and implementing a paddock grazing plan for wintering livestock, right? That's MAINTASK.",
