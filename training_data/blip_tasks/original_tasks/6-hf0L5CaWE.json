                "Examine the wheel bearing and note the disintegration due to water exposure.",
                "Disassemble the bearing hole and clean the axle shaft and spindle.",
                "Position the wheel bearing assembly to access the rear of the wheel.",
                "Use a steel bar and hammer to remove the old wheel bearing by tapping into the removal notches.",
                "Remove the old bearing pieces and save them for reinstallation.",
                "Prepare the new wheel bearing components (hub, race, axle dust seal), apply grease, and position the widest portion facing outward.",
                "Use a steel bar and hammer to install the new bearing, ensuring even tapping for proper seating.",
                "Remove the old dust seal and install the pre-greased new dust seal, packing it with grease.",
                "Assemble the inner bearing part into the hole and pre-grease the rubber seal before installation.",
                "Replace the washer and install the castellated nut, aligning the first cotter key hole and securing it with a bent cotter pin.",
                "Adjust the wheel bearing for the appropriate amount of play (minimal free movement) to prevent overheating and potential damage.",
                "Reattach any loose components, such as dust caps, to complete the wheel bearing replacement.",
                "They have to start by examining the existing problem. The first line says \"Looks like we got a problem Houston. My wheel fell off. I didn't even realize it until it fell off.\" So step 1 would be noticing the issue (SUBTASK 1: Examine the wheel and identify the problem of the bearing falling off). Then they mention the reason: the bearings disintegrated due to water. So next, they would need to clean up the area where the bearing was (SUBTASK 2: Remove broken bearing pieces and clean the affected areas, like the axle shaft and bearing holes).",
                "Use a steel bar and hammer to remove the old bearing by tapping into the notches on the bearing hub). They note it took 8 taps to get it out. Once out, there's the old bearing pieces to save for reinstallation.",
                "Prepare the new bearing components, apply grease, and install them into the wheel's bearing hole, oriented correctly). Then they talk about using a flat steel block and hammer to drive the new bearing into place, hitting it evenly (8:15 in the video). So SUBTASK 7: Use a driving tool (flat steel block) and hammer to press the new bearing hub into the hole, ensuring proper seating.",
                "Grease and replace the dust seal, ensuring it is seated properly). The inner part of the bearing is already in the hole, so they have to pre-grease the rubber part of the dust seal before setting it in.",
                "Assemble the bearing with the castellated nut and cotter key, ensuring proper fit but with controlled play to avoid overheating). Then finally, put the dust cap back on and check everything is secure (which is SUBTASK 10: Reattach dust caps and any other components to complete the replacement)."
