Therefore, the initial answer had tasks that were perhaps less specific to the provided transcript. The revised version now includes five main tasks (Plant seed potatoes, provide garden update, manage pests, garden care, and adjust planting strategies) which are more reflective of the entire conversation. Each main task is broken down into subtasks that align with the transcript content. -**Final Answer**",
