Each of these are complex enough to be a main task. The \"\u751f\u957f\" (growing) of the plant involves multiple steps. If asked to perform the task, you'd need to do all these. So, that's my breakdown. Does that look correct? Yes, it should cover the major physical tasks involved in planting and growing firecracker chili peppers as described in the transcript. Estimated tasks completed based on the steps provided. The transcript is relevant, so the final part is to confirm the answer. The user says \"provide a series of tasks based on the transcript,\" so yeah, that's what we have here. So the output is as outlined above.",
