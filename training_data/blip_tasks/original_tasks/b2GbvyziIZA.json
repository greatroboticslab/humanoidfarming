They need to set up the plants on a table (SUBTASK), examine the leaves and flowers (SUBTASK), talk about sunlight and watering (SUBTASK), mention fertilizing and pest control (SUBTASK), describe pruning and repotting (SUBTASK), and discuss propagating plants (SUBTASK). They also touch on indoor care like providing sun and proper watering (SUBTASK) and managing overwintering (SUBTASK). For pest and disease management (MAINTASK), they need to look for yellowing leaves (SUBTASK) and check for pests (SUBTASK). The main tasks include plant maintenance, care, and troubleshooting (MAINTASK). The transcript is relevant to agriculture and gardening (>>>ACCEPT)."
