                "Starting with continuous or season-long grazing (SUBTASK). The speaker describes it as one large pasture where livestock are kept all year. Advantages include simplicity and high productivity, but disadvantages like difficulty in managing a large area and overgrazing of preferred plants.",
                "Next, deferred rotation system (SUBTASK). Here, multiple pastures are rotated; each is left ungrazed for part of the time. The subtasks could be designing the rotation schedule and ensuring animals are moved regularly. They mentioned benefits like improved riparian areas and wildlife habitat, but lower animal performance.",
                "Then rest rotation system (SUBTASK). This involves deferring a pasture for a full year. The challenge is higher stocking rates leading to overgrazing on regrowth, but plants get a long rest period.",
                "Short duration, high intensity grazing (SUBTASK) seems the most intensive. The system where pastures are grazed multiple times in a short period, possibly to mimic large herds. This would involve frequent animal movements and possibly higher animal densities.",
                "Decisional or management-intensive systems (SUBTASK) are about flexible grazing based on the best forage available. This could mean moving herds to new pastures whenever conditions change. It requires constant monitoring and decision-making. Examples given include best pasture systems, complementary systems, and seasonal suitability. For instance, follow-the-green systems where herds move with growing seasons."
