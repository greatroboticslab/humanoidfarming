However, a few sub-tasks might relate to homesteading (e.g., feeding animals, checking pool safety) or general farm chores. However, due to the emphasis on non-farming content, especially the significant portion dedicated to song lyrics, video editing, and personal thoughts, I've included these as part of the overall task but noted the limited relevance. The final note explains the ambiguity in agricultural content."
