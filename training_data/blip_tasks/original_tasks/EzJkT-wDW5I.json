Then based on that, applying manure efficiently. \"We can give you information on efficient use of manure such as when and how much to apply.\" So MAINTASK: Applying manure efficiently based on soil tests. The farmer would have to figure out how much to apply. That's probably a subtask: Calculating the appropriate amount of manure to apply based on soil tests. Then the idea of not overapplying because it's not only money wasted but also bad for the environment. So MAINTASK: Avoiding over-application of fertilizers/manure for environmental reasons. Subtasks might include: Monitoring environmental impact, adjusting application rates. Also, they mention that over-applying is as bad as underapplying. So the farmer has to be precise. They also say \"to get the pasture where we need to get it,\" which might require applying just enough.
