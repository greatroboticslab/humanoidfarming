Key tasks include adjusting the trailer coupling, loading the trailer with harvested crops, connecting and operating a baler, driving the semi tractor to the loading dock, maintaining tire pressure, and evaluating the day's work. Each main task is broken down into specific subtasks to outline the physical actions required. The list assumes that these tasks are performed manually by an operator, focusing on the bodily movements and operations involved. Tasks are grouped under MAINTASK headers followed by their respective SUBTASKS for clarity."
