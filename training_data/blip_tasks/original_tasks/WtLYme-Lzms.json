                "Apply fumigants (e.g., picloram, Tellone C35) before planting to control soil-borne pathogens and weeds.",
                "Use the Florida three-way fumigation (picloram + K-PEME) for better weed and pathogen control.",
                "Apply pre-emergent herbicides (e.g., Chateau, dubl-Duo) under plastic mulch to control broadleaf weeds and grasses.",
                "Use Chateau at 3-4 oz/a for effective weed control, considering persistence and safety.",
                "Address ragweed parthenium resistant to common herbicides using alternative strategies like hand weeding.",
                "Utilize cover crops during fallow period (April-June) to suppress weed growth and soil health.",
                "Manage nutsedge with cultivation and glyphosate applications, considering its resistance to some cover crops.",
                "Relay cropping (e.g., planting peppers in strawberry beds) to maximize yield through integrated crop rotation.",
                "Employ integrated weed management strategies combining multiple tools (e.g., fumigation, herbicides, cover crops) for long-term effectiveness."
