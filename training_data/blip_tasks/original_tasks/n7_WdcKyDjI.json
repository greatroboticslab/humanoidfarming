                "For collection and preparation, yes, collecting the manure and bedding, and then making a balanced pile. Then composting involves building the pile, turning it, monitoring. Curing is just waiting and monitoring. Mixing amends. Applying. Yeah, that covers all the steps. So the main task is the entire process, and the subtasks are each step. Since it's all about physical activities related to farming, this should be good. The answer should be a box with the main task and the subtasks listed under MAINTASK and SUBTASK respectively."
