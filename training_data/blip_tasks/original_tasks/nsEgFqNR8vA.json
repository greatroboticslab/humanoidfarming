Since the question is to **generate tasks based on the transcript**, regardless if the physical acts aren't present. But the instructions state **\"Give one task per line. Write MAINTASK: before every task.\"** but to also keep in mind that if the video is irrelevant, say so in capital letters. However, the transcript **does** mention physical activity such as driving to the farm and talking with farmers. So the discussion does include some physical tasks (traveling to the field, interacting with farmers), even if it's just talking about them. So if the video itself doesn't show the actual tasks being performed, but talks about them, the tasks could be based on their plan. Therefore, the transcript is not entirely irrelevant.",
