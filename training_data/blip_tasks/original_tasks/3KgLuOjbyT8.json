                "theoretical and practical. So, maybe separate those into subtasks. The theoretical part is lectures on the research done locally, so topics like grafting tomatoes and peppers on different rootstocks, their performance against stresses. IPM is also covered, explaining why it's better to use grafting as the first line of defense. Then the practical part is where they do hands-on grafting. Also, farmers immediately apply what's taught, suggesting_SUBTASK: recognizing the farmer's engagement and recommendations. Another subtask could be applying the principles taught on their own farms. But first, it's important to note that the training is part of a broader effort by the Ministry of Agriculture and WUSC. But since that's more about the organization, maybe not directly a person's task, so maybe filtered out. The main person in the video is Ryan O'Brien from the Ministry, so perhaps the transcript is from an interview or report about the event. But according to the instructions, I have to base the tasks on the transcript alone, so focusing on what participants would do. So the MAINTASK is participation in the workshop, then theoretical and practical components. But also, the maintenance of knowledge for food security and better practices. I thought about adding a subtask for downloading information, but that might be stretching. The principles taught are to be immediately applied, so maybe that's a subtask. Additionally, the response from farmers has been encouraging, which shows engagement, so that's good. Recommendations for varieties and immediate application show farmers are learning and acting on the knowledge. So perhaps making farmer recommendations is a subtask. But in any case, the transcript is about the vegetable grafting workshop, its contents, and the enthusiastic response. So, all these components would form the main task and subtasks. Let's list them again."

Since the transcript is about a vegetable grafting workshop, which is directly about farming techniques, which is relevant, so there's no need for the !!!TRANSCRIPT_IRRELEVANT. Hence, the transcript is relevant. The reason is it's about a training workshop on agricultural techniques, which is directly helpful to farmers in terms of improving practices and knowledge.",
