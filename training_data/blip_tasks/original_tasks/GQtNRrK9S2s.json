Then, within that, several subtasks related to construction, irrigation, end walls, etc. The irrigation system and scissor doors are given significant attention in the video, as the farmer explains in detail how he set these up, so those tasks are well-suited to be MAINTASKs. But given all the elements, maybe \"Install greenhouses (structure, irrigation, and doors)\" would be a starting MAINTASK? Hmm... Alternatively, as the video is titled an \"affordable DIY greenhouse,\" maybe the maintenance and setup tasks are the key, with building the structure being a subtask. Hmm. I'm a bit stuck here. Let me think. Since the whole video is about building and detailing the setup of the greenhouse, the main task is building the greenhouse, with subtasks being structure construction, irrigation, end walls, etc. Then, perhaps, maintaining the irrigation and structure would be separate tasks, but in this context, the video was about the first-time build. So, maybe the primary task is \"Build and set up an affordable DIY greenhouse\" with various subtasks. Alternatively, I could split subtasks to align with the main MAINTASKs mentioned in the video.",
