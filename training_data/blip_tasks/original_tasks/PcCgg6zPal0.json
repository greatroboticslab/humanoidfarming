The answer has organized the tasks into main categories (planting, watering, staking, fertilizing) each with specific sub-tasks. S_hilarimark doesn't directly question the relevance; the transcript is clearly about vegetable gardening, which is permissible. All entries are carefully extracted from the text, ensuring the tasks correspond to actionable steps someone would physically perform when gardening for tomatoes. Code verification includes checking for presence of specific keywords (e.g., \"planting,\" \"watering,\" \"fertilizing\") that justify the tasks.",
