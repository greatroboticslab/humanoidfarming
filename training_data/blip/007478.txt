They have to start by examining the existing problem. The first line says "Looks like we got a problem Houston. My wheel fell off. I didn't even realize it until it fell off." So step 1 would be noticing the issue (SUBTASK 1: Examine the wheel and identify the problem of the bearing falling off). Then they mention the reason: the bearings disintegrated due to water. So next, they would need to clean up the area where the bearing was (SUBTASK 2: Remove broken bearing pieces and clean the affected areas, like the axle shaft and bearing holes).
