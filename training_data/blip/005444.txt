The "MAINTASK" provides a high-level description of the event's purpose, while each "SUBTASK" delves into the specific responsibilities and content addressed by the speakers and panelists, ensuring a comprehensive list of physical tasks related to the virtual event. The numbering system allows for clear organization and tracking of each task's relation to the broader event. For example, Subtasks under MAINTASK are broken down into key sections like keynote presentations, farmer stories, and panel discussions, each with their own specific tasks (e.g., Sren Sndergaard's presentation, Derek Acevedo's insights, Doug Kiesling's sustainability practices, etc.).
