The transcript is irrelevant, so no tasks can be generated. However, the instruction specifically says to separate tasks by new lines and give MAINTASK: for each, followed by subtasks. But since I can't do that, I will state that all is irrelevent. But in any case, the user's root request canâ€™t be filled unless given the transcript.
