The instructions say to write MAINTASK followed by the main task. If there is relevant content here, like someone describing a farming task, then we can break it down into subtasks. But here, given the ambiguity and lack of clear relevance to farming, maybe the right course is to acknowledge that the transcript is irrelevant.
