What is zero-shot learning?
assistant
Zero-shot learning is a type of machine learning where a model is trained on a labeled dataset and then used to make predictions or classifications for new data points that have not been seen during the training phase. In other words, it involves making inferences about unseen objects, tasks, or concepts based on information learned from similar but distinct ones.

In traditional supervised learning, a model is trained using a labeled dataset consisting of both features (input) and corresponding labels (output). During testing, the model uses these previously learned patterns to predict the label of an unseen input sample. However, in zero-shot learning, the model has never seen the specific classes, tasks, or categories of the test data during its training phase. Instead, it relies on the transferability of knowledge gained from other, related but not identical
