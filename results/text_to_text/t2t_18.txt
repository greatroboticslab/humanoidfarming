Explain fine-tuning a vision-language model.
assistant
Fine-tuning a vision-language model, such as one that combines elements of both visual and textual information, is the process of adjusting the model's parameters on a specific dataset to improve its performance for a particular task. This is often done after the model has been trained on a general-purpose dataset or pre-trained on a large collection of text and images.

Hereâ€™s a step-by-step guide to fine-tuning a vision-language model:

### 1. Pre-Training
Vision-language models like **CLIP**, **ViT**, **DeiT**, and **DINO** start from being pre-trained on a combination of image and text data. These models learn general features that can represent both images and text. The pre-training phase helps the model understand the relationships between visual and textual data.
