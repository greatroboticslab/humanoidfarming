Describe reinforcement learning.

Reinforcement learning (RL) is a type of machine learning where an agent learns to perform tasks through trial and error interactions with its environment. The core idea behind RL is to have the agent learn a policy, which is a mapping from situations to actions that maximizes some notion of cumulative reward over time. This learning process involves the following key components:

1. **Agent**: The RL system that learns to make decisions by interacting with the environment.

2. **Environment**: The world in which the agent operates, providing feedback in the form of rewards or penalties based on the actions taken.

3. **State**: The current situation of the environment as perceived by the agent. The state is often represented by a vector of numbers and depends on the specific problem domain but always provides information about past and present
