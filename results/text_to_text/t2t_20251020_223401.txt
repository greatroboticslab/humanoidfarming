Explain contrastive learning.

Contrastive learning is an approach in machine learning that focuses on teaching models to distinguish between pairs of similar and dissimilar items. The idea behind this technique is to improve the model's ability to generalize by understanding the subtle differences and similarities within data.

The core concept of contrastive learning can be traced back to unsupervised learning techniques, where the model learns representations that encode the data but without explicit labels for each instance. Contrastive learning explicitly encourages the model to create representations that are dissimilar for items that are far apart in the data space (i.e., they belong to different classes) and similar for items that are close together (i.e., they share common features).

In practice, contrastive learning works as follows:

1. **Data Representation**: Given a dataset, you create a representation
