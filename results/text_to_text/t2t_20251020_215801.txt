What is computer vision?
assistant
Computer vision is an interdisciplinary field that uses computers to gain high-level understanding of digital images or videos. It has the ability to interpret and understand the content within images and videos with enough accuracy for humans to make some form of logical decision from it.

This technology involves using cameras, image sensors, or video cameras to capture the images or videos, and then applying various algorithms to process and analyze them. Computer vision applications can be found in various fields such as healthcare, transportation, security, retail, etc. Some examples of computer vision include facial recognition, object detection, image classification, text recognition, and more.

The main goal of computer vision is to provide machines with the ability to “see” and understand the world around them just like humans do, but at a much faster rate and with higher accuracy.
