Summarize climate change effects on farming.
assistant
Climate change is significantly affecting agriculture in numerous ways, impacting both smallholder farmers and large-scale agricultural operations globally. Here are some key effects:

1. **Temperature Changes**: Rising temperatures can lead to shifts in the growing seasons of crops, making it challenging for farmers to time planting and harvesting effectively. This can also stress plants, leading to reduced yields.

2. **Precipitation Patterns**: Climate change alters precipitation patterns, which can result in either more frequent and severe droughts or increased intensity and frequency of heavy rainfall events. These extremes make water management crucial for farmers, as they struggle to balance irrigation needs with changing rainfall availability.

3. **Extreme Weather Events**: The frequency and intensity of extreme weather events such as heatwaves, droughts, floods, and storms have increased, directly affecting crop production
