Artificial Intelligence (AI) refers to the simulation of human intelligence processes by computer systems. These processes include learning, reasoning, and self-correction. AI systems can learn from experience, identify patterns, make decisions, and solve problems at a level that can be considered intelligent.

AI encompasses various technologies and techniques such as machine learning, natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, and expert systems. Machine learning involves algorithms that can improve their performance based on data. Natural language processing enables machines to understand, interpret, and generate human language. Computer vision allows machines to interpret visual information for applications like image recognition and video surveillance. Robotics involve creating robots that can perform tasks autonomously or semi-autonomously. Expert systems are designed to emulate the decision-making ability of a human expert in specific domains.
