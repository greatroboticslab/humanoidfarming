Explain how neural networks learn.
assistant
Neural networks learn through a process called backpropagation, which is essentially an algorithm that adjusts the weights of the network to minimize the error between the network's output and the desired output.

Hereâ€™s a simplified step-by-step explanation of how this works:

1. **Input Layer**: The data enters the network through the input layer. Each node in the input layer represents one feature of the input data.

2. **Hidden Layers**: The nodes in the hidden layers are responsible for learning different features or combinations of features from the input data. These nodes apply transformations to their inputs using activation functions such as the sigmoid function, ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit), or others. The number of hidden layers and the number of nodes in each layer can affect the learning capacity of the network.
