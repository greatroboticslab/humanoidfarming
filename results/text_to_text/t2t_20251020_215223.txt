What is transfer learning?
assistant
Transfer learning is a technique in artificial intelligence where a model's learned knowledge from one task or domain (called the "source domain") is applied to another related task or domain (called the "target domain"). The goal of transfer learning is to improve the performance of a model on the target task without having to train it from scratch, thus saving time and computational resources.

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **Source Model**: A pre-trained model is first trained on a large dataset for a task that is similar to the target task. For example, if you want to build a model to classify images of cats, you might use a pre-trained model that was originally designed to classify a broader set of objects or even a completely different type of data.

2. **Transfer**: The weights of the source
