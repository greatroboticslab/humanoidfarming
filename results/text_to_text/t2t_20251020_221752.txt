Autonomous navigation is the ability of a vehicle, be it a car, drone, or a robot, to move from one location to another without human intervention. It involves a series of technologies and algorithms that enable the system to perceive its environment, plan a path, and control the movement to reach the destination. This technology is crucial in various applications such as self-driving cars, drones for delivery services, and autonomous robots in industries like manufacturing.

### Key Components of Autonomous Navigation:

1. **Sensors:**
   - **Laser Scanners (LIDAR):** Used to map the surroundings by emitting laser beams and measuring their return time to determine distance.
   - **Camera Sensors:** Capture images or videos of the environment to help the system identify objects, navigate roads, and recognize traffic signals
