Describe edge computing.
assistant
Edge computing is a distributed computing model that brings computing resources and data processing closer to the edge devices (such as IoT devices, smartphones, etc.) rather than concentrating these resources in a centralized cloud data center. The goal of edge computing is to reduce latency, enhance data privacy, and improve overall system efficiency by processing data on the edge devices themselves.

In traditional computing models, data is often processed in a central location, such as a cloud server or a data center. This approach can introduce significant latency due to the need for data to be transmitted over long distances between the edge device and the central location. For example, if an IoT device needs to process data in real-time, it may have to wait for the data to be transferred to the cloud before processing, which can lead to delays that may not
