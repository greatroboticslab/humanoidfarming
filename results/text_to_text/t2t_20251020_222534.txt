What is multimodal learning?
assistant
Multimodal learning refers to the acquisition of knowledge from multiple types of data or representations simultaneously, as opposed to the traditional unimodal learning approach where learning is based on a single type of data, such as images, text, or audio.

In multimodal learning, learners can perceive and understand information from different sources using techniques that combine different modalities, such as vision, hearing, touch, and even language. Multimodal learning combines visual, auditory, and textual information together, which allows for a richer understanding and context for the learner.

This approach has become increasingly important in fields such as computer vision, natural language processing (NLP), and machine learning, as it allows machines to interpret and understand human language, images, sounds, and other forms of data more effectively.
