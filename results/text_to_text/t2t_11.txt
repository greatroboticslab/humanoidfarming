What is prompt engineering?
assistant
Prompt engineering refers to the practice of crafting effective and precise prompts to elicit specific and desired responses from AI models, particularly those based on large language models (LLMs). It involves:

1. **Clarity**: Ensuring the prompt is clear and unambiguous so that the AI model can understand exactly what you want it to do or what information you need.

2. **Relevance**: Making sure the prompt is relevant to the task at hand. A prompt that is too broad or not specific enough can lead to irrelevant or incorrect outputs.

3. **Length and Complexity**: Balancing the length and complexity of the prompt. Sometimes, more detailed and longer prompts can help the model understand the context better, while overly complex prompts might confuse the model.

4. **Formatting**: Using appropriate formatting and structure
