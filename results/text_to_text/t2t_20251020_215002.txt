How does deep learning work?

Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses multi-layered neural networks to recognize patterns and learn from large datasets. Here's a simplified overview of how it works:

1. **Neural Networks**: Deep learning leverages artificial neural networks, which are modeled after the human brain. These networks consist of interconnected nodes called "neurons" arranged in layers. Each neuron takes input data, performs a computation on it using weights, and passes the result to the next layer.

2. **Input Layer**: The first layer, known as the input layer, receives raw data such as images, text, or numerical values.

3. **Hidden Layers**: Between the input layer and the output layer, there are one or more hidden layers. These layers are where the learning happens. Each neuron in a hidden
