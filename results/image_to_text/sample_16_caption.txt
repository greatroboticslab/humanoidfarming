The image shows a railroad track with two lit traffic lights, indicating that the train is approaching a crossing. The tracks are situated on a gravel bed and have wooden barriers flanking both sides. There are piles of rocks and gravel surrounding the tracks for protection. In the background, there's a rocky landscape with vegetation, extending towards the ocean. Several palm trees are visible, suggesting a coastal or coastal-like environment. There are also some buildings or structures near the water's edge, and a road with a signpost can be seen in the distance. The sky appears to be clear with a light blue hue, indicating a sunny day.
