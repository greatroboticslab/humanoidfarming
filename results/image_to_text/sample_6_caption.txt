The photo shows a collection of vintage, wooden toothbrushes displayed on a wooden shelf or stand. The toothbrush handles are long and slender, resembling traditional wooden brushes used for painting or writing. 

In the background, there is a small wooden box with a brown label that reads "Finest Choice Boneless Salt Codfish" and mentions it as being from New York National Stores. The text on the box appears to be in a rustic, hand-lettered font, adding to the vintage aesthetic of the scene. Additionally, there is a small sign or card that reads "2" placed next to the toothbrushes, possibly indicating a price or size.
