1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:11,040
I started my journey actually at South

2
00:00:08,550 --> 00:00:12,780
Dakota State University and ended up

3
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:14,910
getting a degree in botany because I

4
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:18,480
like to study of plants then I spent

5
00:00:14,910 --> 00:00:22,890
about 20 years with the USDA and most of

6
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:24,900
it was ARS and doing research I was the

7
00:00:22,890 --> 00:00:26,789
technician under the research around the

8
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:31,109
Cheyenne I was born in Brookings South

9
00:00:26,789 --> 00:00:34,110
Dakota and so we focused on no-till

10
00:00:31,109 --> 00:00:37,350
mainly diverse rotations and how they

11
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:40,140
impact crops and then that transitioned

12
00:00:37,350 --> 00:00:42,989
into a lot of cover crop research well

13
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:44,820
ahead of the popularity I think we're

14
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:47,329
seeing with cover crops especially in

15
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:47,329
South Dakota

16
00:00:50,280 --> 00:00:55,199
the agronomist for Olsen custom farms

17
00:00:52,890 --> 00:00:58,289
now I'm based out of Hendricks Minnesota

18
00:00:55,199 --> 00:01:03,149
but we've have farms in in South Dakota

19
00:00:58,289 --> 00:01:05,820
as well before I got to the farm they

20
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:09,659
had acquired a small seed business and

21
00:01:05,820 --> 00:01:14,940
so they started raising some certified

22
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:17,700
oats and spring wheat with me joining

23
00:01:14,940 --> 00:01:19,890
the farm we had other crops like

24
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:22,350
sunflowers and then of course corn

25
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:25,259
soybeans a little bit of alfalfa hay and

26
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:30,569
then they have forages that are devoted

27
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:33,179
to the to the feedlot operation and so

28
00:01:30,569 --> 00:01:36,030
one of the the first opportunities that

29
00:01:33,179 --> 00:01:38,880
I've seen joining Olson custom farms was

30
00:01:36,030 --> 00:01:42,030
to stretch our rotation out to take that

31
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:45,240
power diversity and make it work for us

32
00:01:42,030 --> 00:01:47,759
because it's free it just involves more

33
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:50,190
management but that's what I'm that the

34
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:54,080
farm for is to help with that management

35
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:57,780
and execute those cropping plans so now

36
00:01:54,080 --> 00:02:02,340
we're trying to move from not just corn

37
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:05,429
soybeans but rather a corn soybean small

38
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:09,000
grain a cereal crop right now that's old

39
00:02:05,429 --> 00:02:12,510
spring wheat or winter rye so now we've

40
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:15,270
got this diverse set of situation where

41
00:02:12,510 --> 00:02:17,819
the corn sees a different previous crop

42
00:02:15,270 --> 00:02:20,910
but also a different moisture balance in

43
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:23,160
the soil the community that we set up

44
00:02:20,910 --> 00:02:26,160
for it in the soil with the cover crops

45
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:28,190
I look for many benefits to come out of

46
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:30,840
it it's a little too early to tell but

47
00:02:28,190 --> 00:02:33,420
since I come from research and I've seen

48
00:02:30,840 --> 00:02:36,620
it be successful I'm pretty confident

49
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:39,200
that we can be successful

50
00:02:36,620 --> 00:02:42,200
and like any management we have to take

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:45,470
an account the cost of our cover crop

52
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:49,780
seed and what it cost the seed but I'm

53
00:02:45,470 --> 00:02:53,959
looking at it that will offset those

54
00:02:49,780 --> 00:02:56,360
expenses with reductions in applied in

55
00:02:53,959 --> 00:02:59,599
organic fertilizer that's my goal for

56
00:02:56,360 --> 00:03:02,900
the farm is to bring our level of

57
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:05,810
applied in organic fertilizer reduce it

58
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:08,900
by forty to fifty percent that would be

59
00:03:05,810 --> 00:03:11,560
a good goal it's an ambitious goal but I

60
00:03:08,900 --> 00:03:14,650
think it's very attainable

61
00:03:11,560 --> 00:03:14,650
