  "text": "bushes here one on the other side of the tree not this fall but last fall now one was a full Bush and everyone was a dormant start from Tractor Supply so we had one this was the start here and then the other one was a full on Bush now this is an invasive monovic this is a non-invasive type of Wisteria which here in the South with Syria can be very invasive you'll see it all over the highways climbing through trees my mom has it in her backyard her house is over 100 years old and she has what appears to be beautiful beautiful Wisteria Vines but they will take over your trees if they can jump onto your house they will take over your house anything they could climb on they will take over and they can really choke out a lot of ecosystems that you don't want them to and that is the main problem with invasive things is when they grow places you don't want them to yeah my non-invasive Vines will not do that they will stay where you put them you can cut them back they will grow where you want Instagram which is excellent unfortunately the difference is that you do have to help them to climb now once they are truly truly truly established they will start to find a little bit we're going to climb up in the tree a little bit um now I bought mine from a nursery here in town and they told me all the differences between the invasive and the non-invasive I did a whole video on this I will link it down below um but again the main difference is you have to help it climb until it gets truly established and that can take a couple years so these whips that are coming off of those branches off of line here they need help climbing the tricks they can't really do it on their own you can see that they are Outlets along the ground I will do it a clip right here to show you it goes all the way over there's a really really long lip on the other side of the tree going along the ground by the garden so all of those will help going around the tree it's a little funny but they grow really fast this is one Summer's worth of grow th these are still fairly blue Vines I've only got one season of wounds out of them this year and that one season was about five to ten rooms um the the ones at the nursery were beautiful they had hundreds of ones so maybe next year it's grown so much this year it's grown you know almost 10 times more than it grew last week at this season so today all we're going to be doing is taking these little u-shaped snails do you change nails and we're going to be helping to attack the vine in place up around the tree so that it can grow now the whole reason I am growing these now on this tree is that history is a is not doing supervised it's probably not going to make it forever I'm not going to get this however this is a big experiment when I move out of this house I will be taking house with needs a modular house but when I move this tree will probably come down and so the whole idea of this is to try it out see our non-invasive lines ever house we plant them somewhere where they become an issue so for today I'm going to take our Hammer to go take your nails and help guide these lines up around the tree and if you have a tree that is super important to you and is not as sure a lot of your sturdier trees will take Nails in the bar some kids so if you make sure you can ask at your Nursery look for someone to ask and your teacher try um you know wrote me twine around the branches to help keep guiding them upwards and giving them a growing support until they can reach something up top to Anchor them into the tree something that's a lot less detrimental than that that I'm not worried about we're using Nails I've been doing this for almost two years now and we have had no issues but we are getting to the point where we really need a top where I can't reach and so on in the driveway now is my tall brother we've got a top brother and a tall ladder we're gonna get this guy taken care of so let's get started gonna be a lot of me stretching divides of him putting the nails on all right so you're gonna place it right over the Vine yeah and you'll hammer it in just until it is really in the bark when you can you want to leave enough room for the vine to still kind of move around and grow and that's it just keep on pulling them up the tree [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] foreign [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] all right we got everything put up the tree my phone overheated so I don't know how much of it y'all saw but we've got the big whip put up you can see it up at the top it went all the way to the top of the tree and all the little ones are woven in now I try to weave them so that the leaves are front face out because they grow with front face out but you can see will doesn't know that so he just puts him up so he's got some back face ones but it's okay they go all the way up oh that one probably could have been tacked better you can see the end there but you know what it's fine and instead of literally the one whip we had around at the beginning of the Season we have a whole trunk full and I'm really hoping that means next year we will have a whole tree of blooms this is time when buying an invasive Vine that would climb on its own sounds really good but for the two years it's been installed that I've had it planted I'm falling over I only had to do this two three times now obviously you saw the whips I should have done this at least two times this season and I haven't so that's part of it um but lots of growth this year so I'm calling that a win I'm gonna go inside and get cool because it's hot hot out here my brother has already left he has he has finished his uh brotherly Duty for the day I will see y'all in the next project bye stay cool",
