  "text": "hello my name is Leonor Rodriguez I am a professor of Technical University of Madrid and today I will be introducing a little bit the elements for the D irrigation systems what do you need to know when designing re Iration system in an ecological Orchard organic Orchard the orchard that we be on belongs to the Technical University of Madrid and the faculty of the engineer agricultural engineering school and we will see here the different elements that the systems need to be aware of their characteristics and they function it first things you need to think of is about where the water is how the water will be conveying to the different small Orchards and if we are talking about this irrigation systems you need to know that water will move along the circular pipe as this one and the whole section will be filling with water that means that pressure along the pie will be higher than atmospheric pressure Now we move on to see where the water comes out in this particular or water comes to this point from the central water uh company of Madrid it's called Canal Isel sea this Lo in a special places afterwards there is various underneath the soil the different pipe and it comes out in this point you will see here this is a hyraulic Val this this one over here this is open or close bar that goes forward to connect another five B of different material this one is fibro cemento and the other one is polyethylen the diameter of this material is 40 mm and it comes along to the whole length of the F showing the pressure at this point but in this case it is connected with a pressure regulator what do we mean a pressure regulator here the pressure of this pip could be as high as 17 and water M col so that is too high for uh Bri Iration system so in that case if we need a very high pressure more than 20 or 30 H water met colum we will need to use that pressure regulat device in the point where the distribution pi ends afterwards we'll continue to the head or the tail of the different areas from the small Bri irrigation system on this aricultural oras and that five will be the same diameter and the same material that's this one you see over here this is also bared let's move to see which are the typical elements for adri irrigation systems but first of all let me reminded how much water you need to apply B irrigation system how to calculate the water requirements or each plants in different Orchards it will depend on variables such as climb precipitation solar radiation wind soil structure texture organic matter and the physiological behavior of each crop there are public programs to calculate this CLW requirements such as the crossw by file that everyone can take Link into those H specifical web download the program and calculate the water requirements for each gr and and each location we know that information what should we do what should we do next next is decide which type of irrigation system we need for our organic torture like that we need a very efficient irrigation systems if we think of the barriers type of irrigations method where we think of the surface irrigation method is really too complicate nowadays you can do it we can think of the splink regation method but uh for that Horticultural C is not worth it since we have a many a evaporation losses and we also need a very high pressure so the best irrigation methods should be th irrigation methods this Iration method it also has the advantage doesn't be affected by wind so in the specifical locations where the wind is could be a problem that's the the method to go and the efficiencies really very very high is the the management of the system is well organized this so what are the typical elements forre irrigation system they are the drippers these are different type of drippers that's this online emitter emitter and they had the advantage in case you will need several dischs you can't do it with this small tube we have a inal line emitters means that the path is cuted both ends and inserted within the emitter and the most typical models are the integrated model like that all of them have in common our Labyrinth structure as you can see here you will see that this a Laing with um protu and different angles what does this is required for as we think of the three Iration system is a localizing system that mean water deserts drop by drop near the plant and the pipe has a pressure over the atmospheric pressure that's mean over One bars we need an element to L to drop off all pressure that means to keep it close to atmospheric pressure what are these elements usually the Labyrinth so the water comes into this lence moves along and then the discharge from the different Outlet usually one or two houret and when it is discharged this is atmospheric pressure so that means that water uh can't like it it it wear a drop you can also try a home if you have a pile like this by pressure try to punch it a small hole you will see that there is a jet free jet coming out that doesn't mean that even though you have the same diameter outl from the meter this H the meters and the one in the PIP you won't see the same effect this is UN localized because the labyrint and this is not localized this a typical FL we observe that uh you have a really tiny SE no more than 2 mm between 1 and 2 mm there so this is one of the disadvantage of this system you have to be aware that water is doesn't carry a small minerals with this so a small organic matter that can PL those section that means that emit with the plug it and the discharge will be lower than expected in order to avoid that disadvantage you have to add to the system a filter the most typical system for this irrigation system is the dick filters this is a very fine disc press it together water comes from the outer part and the all the material that this coning with the water stay in the greenest part of the of the this and the clean water can to the inner part and move to the irrigation units well we know the elements and now a question to answer is what should be the optimum this chart for the meter well you can have in the market from 1 L per hour till 8 to 10 L per hour so this is a a wi interval range what you say when we are dealing with pressure don't forget to leave a pressure G like that at the beginning of the irrigation unit that's the typical if this is liid and you can go there so it's time what the pressure is otherwise you want to do that yes a l a pressure button over there and go with a digital manometer like this Sy time you want and going with this element that is connected to the digital monometer punch it into the bottom outlet and measure the pressure finally we need a volume meter like that that's the Walmart volume meter it can be used for progamming the irrigation or yes simple to pay the bill of water that will canalot everyone or two mon for this irrigation system we have to an integrated model no compensating 2.2 L per hour this is the a design of the meter that goes inside the pipe now let's move to the orchin and see how the irrigation unit is as you remember this was the point with the pressure Reg and the pressure gut to know which is the regulator the pressure at this time and and in at every moment remember this system has a pressure over 40 water colon meter even 60 water colon meter because it comes to the general water networking from the city of M you wouldn't have this pressure and that's probably you may have in in in feel located at the Summers of the big cities you probably will have to install a little pond at the beginning of the whole system in this case we don't need it we we need the contrary we need to to drop off some energy because the the the pressure is really high and then it will just we keep it there let's say between one and two bars we move with the same diameter for p 4 mm and we need to think of the best design for this CH and this Orchards first you have to make all the L settles for the plants that's the first thing you need to be decided once this is done the Iration system needs to cover all the water Closs water requirements for that needs what should be the best designs for this specific case we have try and calculate different options and the best we found in terms of Energy savings is the one that takes the same P for water distribution all along to the middle area between this small clots and the left and right clots that go in the middle to the middle cor of the here and from here is a split with two Tes on two different containers each containers will dgate four different blocks so we have one container inting this four blocks behind this other container will irrigate this other four clock and finally this is a symmetry just think of in the v solution taking into account symmetry as much as possible according to the Topography of the field and this last two the the the lateral with move the final P will be this one here and there is a coat elbows that moves one to the left one to the right and from here they will distribute water from these four blocks and behind from the other four blocks so once we have the p 40 mm SP here we need to change diameters usually for the tertiary Pi this is this one 25 mm and from the tertiary Pi we have the Cherry pip that goes very close to the blocks we'll move to the end of the plot down end of the plot and in the middle part we rise a little bit with a different diameter polyethylen P this is usually from 12 mm to 16 and we have an open and close B to open and close the water so each container will get water for every four plots but you have to be aware that water comes from the start point that means that you have unlimited water so in order to make a right programing to irrigate simultaneously one two three or four flock or even more you won't have to surpass the quantity of water delivered by the a start point you can irrigate simultaneously with as many units as Water Supplies we see here in the container two different elements that um may be very useful for this types of irrigation one is the electro valve for irrigation programming this types of program me is by time you said that the time of irrigation this is the open BX for here this valve open and the irrigation will go on to the different sub genit and we have also in that case this element this is a pressure reductor we say that at the beginning it was a regulator pressure that was H setup to 2.2 bars and this one reduce the pressure at that point to 1.1 so that means that water that comes along this tary pip will have no more than 1.2 bars the the other element beond the electr and the pressure reactors is the volumeter meter so it will lock all the volume of water us it in its irrigation afterwards we move along we have the open and closed wall we saw before and this is our small irrigation unit it is compon of the tertiary p and four laterals in that case the distribution water is in the middle we could have Chen other designed taking the distribution of water either in one side on the other what will be the advantage or Distributing the water that way means that the pressure is more compensated in both ends so we have the laterals the laterals goes from one end to the downstream end the emit expansions are choing according to the CR physiological requirements the cross planting in this case is 30 cm apart for a typical D Rion units at the end of its lateral we have a plaque to stop the water running but in the skates we have a non branched design that means that the end of the lateral are connected to another part that means that water moving from the upper stream going to the down stream will move downwards and can go to reverse we attend with this Ty of design that the pressure variability is you know as higher so that will mean that we have a more water distribution uniformity and more efficiency so finally we don't need to forget what is the pressure of each irrigation unit so that means that we need a point where we should with the pressure it that case we are using the pressure button and will be locating in a uni pip that case how can we do that we to use the puncher is that here we can buy the puncher in it small store gardening store or supermarket and we open a hole we inserted and this is a measure meter the volume meter is also a meter so don't forget for every meter located in a uniform pip otherwise the reading you will be taking will be outrange you never know this is will be lower or higher than this should be I hope you can enjoy this brief explanation and probably you can try doing yourself in your bget thank you for l",
