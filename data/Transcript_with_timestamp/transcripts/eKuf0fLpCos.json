  "text": "welcome to ndsu extension that's north dakota state university extension we provide our programs for everyone today's program is background in cattle fall 2021 a series for cattle producers looking at backgrounding their cattle today's talk will be feeds alternative feeds and costs of gain by carl hoppe extension livestock specialists located at the carrington research extension center part of ndsu our new crop calves in 2021 are on the ground and are being presently weaned and the weather has changed and we're looking forward to a new feeding season of course that brings challenges so that um we have to consider what happened last year and i always have to comment that our feed prices continue to follow the corn price and it might even be higher because of the drought that we had in 2021 as you can see in this picture our corn crop was pretty small and people even turned cows out on their field just to have something to eat and it's been a challenge for us cattle producers in north dakota but we move on and i'd just like to go a little walk through history here in 2017 our corn prices were actually less than three dollars a bushel and that drug the rest of our other feeds down as well alfalfa hay was eighty dollars a ton grass hay was at 65 wheat meds or around 95. uh we had barley malt sprouts at that time 115 or corn prices around 3 30 a ton the canola mills of 186 a ton and dry distillers was on par at 113 per ton all based off the corn price that was in 2017 and near um four years ago so now uh let's or five years ago now let's look at what happened in 2018 prices remained almost the same 2019 corn price moved up a little bit maybe 30 40 cents and all the rest of the feeds increased accordingly in 2020 feed prices remain somewhat the same so just when you think you've got a trend going here of years of lower feed costs for cattle 2021 shows up and our price of corn is 575 a bushel that's because of national demand not because of the local drought just because the national demand now alfalfa hay has increased up to 175 dollars a ton in some places it might be 200 250 a ton depending upon the quality of the alfalfa um grass say is a 128 125 a ton uh wheat middlings 190 soy hauls is a new product available in north dakota because the processing industries are making it more available and there's more of them in north in the north dakota region and it's being priced at 165. uh corn silage uh 55 a ton just because our corn price has gone up canola meal is surprisingly somewhat constant from previous years but dry distillers grains has increased correspondingly just like the way corn has so this year our feed costs have increased drought makes it a difficult year and we have been struggling for feed for cattle producers that were out of feed they probably sold cows they weaned off calves early fed them early this particular program really focuses on the fall weaning cows the ones that scraped by with enough feed worked on their harvest and now that the weather has changed somewhat in november weaning is now progressing on these april mayborn calves one thing i got to note in north dakota is that we have a lot of different crop processing plants across the state we have corn distilleries for making ethanol which creates the byproduct corn distillate grains located throughout north dakota as well as into south dakota north dakota also has quite a few wheat mills wheat middling or wheat mills for making wheat mids located in grand forks carrington minot fairmont i always have to point out that our the state mill and elevator in grand forks is the single largest mill in the world in one location that just underscores how much wheat mailings are produced on that plant and mostly shipped out of state uh we have uh sugar uh factories uh processing across the state mostly in the red river valley but some out in sydney montana these particular plants produce uh beet pulp usually wet they can also produce beet tailings but a lot of that's being now moved up to grand forks to the ethanol refinery that's specifically made for uh fermenting uh the sugars out of beet tailings and of course we have a couple of potato processing plants and we have a wet corn milling facility down at wahpeton we just have a plethora of processing co-products available in north dakota a lot of those are being shipped out of state but we do have some local demand and there create an opportunity for us for cattle feeders in north dakota i said earlier here's a description of what we actually have we got five plants produced distillers grains we have five mills to produce wheat mint leaves we've got one in-state plant that produces soy hulls uh we have one plant that produces corn gluten feed these are all high moderate protein thirty anywhere from eighteen to 30 protein soy haul's around 12 and these are all have a highly fermentable fiber all the starch has been removed for the most part and what's left over is fermentable fiber we do have like i said beet tailings and beet pulp and we do have a wide variety of meals available like cannoli meal linseed meal sunflower meal corn gluten meal and soybean meal available for feeds if we need protein addition to the rations these are all co-products these are things that are produced by our plants of course we have protein sources on our that we produce on farm like soybeans or alfalfa hay or sunflowers those are all filled peas and lentils are all play things that can produce protein as well as energy on farm and should be considered in a ration screenings just a word of screenings be careful if you're bringing in screenings from out of state the type of weed seeds they might have things like palm or amaranth could be in those and you can definitely start a problem on your feed yard if you're feeding that type of feed and allowing weeds to grow in the future let me just make a point here about our daily nutrient costs i received an email this morning that talked about uh how high the protein content was in his creep feed and wanting to have exceptional gains in his calves and while protein's important the most important part is the energy cost we spend more in energy costs per day than we do protein costs it takes energy preventable fiber starch even some proteins are metabolized free energy takes energy to put growth on an animal so if we just look at things in general say that i did some math here it takes around 14 pounds of edm which is a measurement of energy content to uh put weight gain on a 700 pound steer uh this would cost about a little over a dollar a day in pro in energy costs look at protein costs there would be well almost a dollar a day however we don't pay for all the protein we buy the energy first and then a lot of protein comes along free for in other words corn is nine percent protein we buy the corn for the energy content but we get nine percent protein basically for free so we need to do is buy additional protein to boost up that corn so it has enough protein to maintain the gain we want there's a lot of words to say but really we're feeding that type of ration we need to provide another six tenths of a pound of crude protein and if we do the math cost per pound of protein at 42 cents that means we need to provide an extra 25 cents a day in protein costs so it costs a dollar a day for the energy and another 25 cents for additional protein and then of course that pales to the water cost and be all means that's water cost per day please consider your water quality and water availability that's some of the cheapest gain you can have on a in a particular cowherd i'd like to look at some math here when it comes to feed value we've got four different feed stuffs canola meal wheat meds corn grain and distillers grains um colonel mill is known for its crude protein at 38 wheat meds is 17 percent corn is low at eight and a half percent distillers grains is around 26.6 percent or almost 30 percent on the dry matter basis they all have different energy calculations um distillers grains is actually high since it's got uh some fat in it more than what corn grain would and uh the rest of these feeds all are you know not considered zany's resources like corn is there's different costs so we see canola mill is 255 a ton which hasn't changed wheat meds are now up to 190 corn grain at 206 and distillers at 230 dollars a ton so if we're looking cost per pound our cheapest feed is going to be this year wheat mids look at cost per pound of protein our cheapest feed obviously is canola milk that's what we buy it for is for its protein but if you look at cost per pound of energy our cheapest source again is wheat middlings although corn and distillate grains are ranked right in their side by side as being somewhat competitive as an energy source that's why distilled grains is used as high percent a lot of our rations please let me talk about feed issues for fall 2021. our biggest issue this year is how drought affected our feeds nitrate accumulation has occurred may have decreased but be sure to test your speeds for nitrates the forages the grains you don't need to but the forages certainly do the co-products probably don't need to measure those as well but any forage that you were raised on farm should be tested for nitrates this year and if it's over 1500 parts a million nitrate nitrogen it should be decreased it should be diluted with other feeds that are lower nitrate nitrogen high nitrates can lead to basically death and in pregnant cows it can lead to aborted fetuses so nitrates are not to be ignored when it comes to rations be sure to do a feed test to find out where yours are at and try to feed under 15 so the average of the ration delivered to the cattle is under 1500 parts per million nitrate nitrogen if you're using a bell ring then your haze and that bell ring should certainly be under that fifteen hundred parts per million nitrate nitrogen for calves or otherwise i know some calves prefer to eat grain and not come over and eat uh prefer to eat hay and not eat grain and of course if the nitrate nitrogen was quite high and that's all they're eating you would end up with death loss so the other thing a person should do is sample feeds for feed just for for doing a feed analysis a feed test on them with the drought there's been a very a lot of variability in the type of feeds we have out there so uh feed testing is always important this year it's a big deal some guys have been putting up hays or forages that have a lot of weeds in them try to limit that to your calves just because intake is driven by palatability some of these weeds aren't very palatable and calves may not eat them of course so uh our corn seemed to mature for people that were actually able to get corn grain that seemed like it was a heavy test weight so that'll ensure that there's uh some good energy content in our corn uh for guys that put up uh corn silage early because the drought and the plants just not grown there is a higher percent water in them so be sure to do a feed test so you know what type of moisture content is added so we can adjust the dry matter uh consumption accordingly actually dry matter is going to remain the same but we'll have to increase the amount of corn size based on the higher water content as i mentioned earlier our hays are highly variable between fields when it comes to feed tests so using book values or even just one test on one particular load of feed just really doesn't show what's what could be out there so there's a lot of variability out there encourage you to feed test and know what you have especially when you're trying to do rates of gains for calves our feed costs are quite a bit higher this year i talked about that earlier it's 70 percent higher compared to the last few years um availability appears to be okay however if you're in demand for quite a bit of feed should probably figure out how to get that locked up some places might need a contract other places might need money paid for the contract up front to guarantee supply but this year having it on hand might be the best route to make sure you actually have the feed big costs and freight is always an issue when you're hauling feed around but this year with the feed transportation programs available within north dakota and the usda there might be some subsidy going on there or help in paying for the transportation costs for things bought outside the normal grain is high that's not a localized drought demand that's a national demand and of course whenever grain prices go up hey prices go up as well but when you're in a drought hey prices because of how difficult they are to transport long distances uh they go up as well so that becomes a big challenge on trying to find haze at a reasonable price for feeding cattle i'd like to go through some rations now i've got 12 different rations to discuss in this particular slide if you look at these rations we first start off with a grass hay supplemented with some wheat mitts we're looking at two pounds a day gain um it would take around 13 pounds of grass hay and supplement seven pounds of wheat meds and it would cost a dollar 48 per day with a feed cost per pound to gain at uh 74 cents now if you want to pick up our gain from two pounds up to 2.6 pounds we're going to have to throw in a little alfalfa hay for the protein and energy and increase the wheat meds up to 10 percent also we have to increase the calcium in the ration and we did that with the alfalfa a well our feed costs went up another extra 20 cents a day because of this ration but our feed cost goes down 10 cents per pound again now the same thing holds true when we start looking at using grass hay and wheat mids at a higher amount at 12 pounds we're looking at 2.8 pounds per day gain we have to include the limestone to offset the high phosphorus content of wheat mids and you'll see that it costs almost the same as the previous ration with two tenths of a pound better gain which means our feed cost per pound of gain actually went down you'll see this in the next slides too where feed costs go down as our gain increases now remember on this particular ration we're talking a dollar 66 a day let's look at some other rations now here's an alfalfa corn alfalfa hay corn silage ration you got the king of forages in in corn sides and the queen of forages and alfalfa hay they'll blend to do together at that amount could give at eight pounds alfalfa hay and 29 pounds of corn size you get 1.8 pounds per day average daily gain uh it'd cost you a buck and a half a day but your feed costs are at 83 cents now if you have a little corn grain in there and some wheat meds uh take out the corn sides you put in alfalfa hay so six pounds of grass saved four pounds of alfalfa hey two pounds of corn and eight pounds of wheat man so give you 2.6 pounds per day gain 65 cent cost to gain 1.69 boy that's very similar to that other ration that was provided earlier now if we go with one that looks for a little bit better average daily gain at three pounds um we'll find out that uh where you're feeding four pounds of grass hay four pounds alfalfa six pounds of corn grain and six pounds of wheat mitts in other words we went from two pounds of corn grain up to six pounds our feed costs went up accordingly to a dollar eighty but our feed cost per pound a gain is now the lowest at five ninety six another action we have here is just a dry ration of alfalfa hay and corn grain 13 pounds of alfalfa hay with seven pounds of corn grain gave us a 2.3 pounds per day gain 77 cost to gain a dollar 86 per day oh that's getting kind of expensive well now let's look at a ration that we don't have much for grass hay or other feeds we're just going to use alfalfa and corn grain and when we're feeding that amount of corn grain we have to provide an additional protein supplement and a bagged feed works quite well for that 3.2 pounds per day gain which has pushed these calves along pretty good our cost of gain is 6.96 at 69 cents which is uh competitive but our costs per day are now 230. 230 2.23 cents again we're over three pounds a day gain now if you want to increase that gain a little bit higher and feed less alfalfa and more corn grain are at three and a half pounds per day gain uh we're going to end up with our two and a quarter per day feed cost which is just a couple pennies more for uh the 3.5 average daily gain versus 3.2 and our feed costs are the lowest of six point at 64 cents per pound to gain things to remember feet cost decreases energy increases excuse me as the grain uh increases in the orac should say the average daily gain of the rash of that provides from the ration is increased well okay now let's look at grass hay with a little bit of distillers grains to be added as protein and energy now this is a 1.7 average daily gain only it's the cheapest is a buck and a half a day but our feed cost is at 82 cents now if we put a little corn into that ration at four pounds and take out some of the hay we're going to get 2.8 pounds per day gain 1.73 a day is what the cost is with a 61 61 cost gain definitely workable but not our one of our cheaper rations if you want a little bit better gain at 3.4 uh we're using grasshay corn grain distillers grains and limestone 3.4 average daily gain find out this is one of our lowest cost feed per cost to gain and at a dollar 86 per day and that's 3.4 in the earlier slide we're at three we're above threes and it was over two two and a quarter a day for feed costs so in this particular example you can see that going from just a little bit of corn grain up to a little bit more and just changing the dynamics of the ration really improved our feed conversion or increased our average daily gain quite a bit just a small difference of adding three more pounds of corn grain and taking out the grass hay and of course we had to include limestone to increase the calcium content of this ration because this tillage grains is high in in phosphorus and corn grain is high in phosphorus as well let me just make a few comments on rate of gain goals if we're looking for oil roll ascending cattle to the grass market making stockers out of these cattle backgrounding them at less than two pounds per day gain that's what we call low rate of gain medium rates again usually two to three pounds i like to call these as your grow cattle without adding extra fat to them or putting on condition they just have a nice growth and frame once you go brighter than three pounds per day average day of the gain if you do that more than 45 60 days you're going to end up with calves that add a little bit more flesh to them and when that happens you may reduce subsequent feedlot performance and cattle buyers know that so they will discount accordingly however if you know the genetics behind the cattle they can do this type of game without any loss of performance you need to know what what you're buying and know this best way to do that is know the historical performance of cattle and go that direction if you're going to feed cattle i always encourage you to target the gain with a balanced ration said earlier as you increase the protein and energy you get better feed efficiency and better average daily gains so one of my examples here is to if you want three pounds a day for 60 days that'd be 180 pounds or we can do it a different way and that is we want to get a pound and a half day gain for 120 days it really depends upon what your market weight and date is going to be and how you wish to feed cattle sometimes there's changes in the market that allow you to uh run cattle at a lower average daily gain to pick up a higher price so even though the feed costs might not be as efficient the market gain will more than offset that and provide an opportunity for you and if this is all home raised feeds then again the cost might be quite a bit lower than it would be if it was purchased out on the uh market just opportunity cost would be uh what you'd have to consider that always like to have people think about co-products and i talked about where they're located in north dakota if you need an info sheet of where they're sourced at and prices and phone calls to call please contact your local county extension agent they should have a list that i put together that they can provide to you that's your local account extension agent in north dakota if you can contract fees usually there's summer lows that you can work around anytime you have to haul at long distances that really reduces your price competitiveness although this year with the transportation assistance program that might make a little bit of difference on what your cost might be usually we look at high fiber high fiber and actually they're good in protein as well when we background cattle things like wheat meds and distillers grains work quite well in a background ration for adding a little extra protein and since it's not starch baits they provide extra fiber in the ration as well which can somewhat limit the gain that we're looking for always encourage you to do a great job of feeding management that means feed bunks that don't have too much feed left in them but aren't empty as well provide some bedding on cold days that'll make a nice environment for calves we've got research of the carrington research extensions and other shows that does affect your feed efficiency and marbling in cattle uh depending upon how big they've been then how their environment is while they've been growing clean water is always a must if you're going to put calves on feed please try to reduce the amount of moldy feeds you have so that might discourage intake obviously healthy calves grow better than sick calves try to look at ration changes slowly use step up ratchets as an example be sure to balance the ration for the weight gain for the weight and type of cattle that you have and of course like i said earlier consider your rate of gain goals calves that gain 3 pounds per day gain may not show any discount at the marketplace while other groups of calves might please consider the type of calf when you're looking at your rate rating goal if you're trying to improve feed per gain with cattle look at ionophores that'll increase your income your improvement that'll improve the feed efficiency by five to seven percent uh the omniforester mints and the bovita the trade names you can use implants do the same thing five to seven percent unless you're an increase in average daily gain and your feeding feed efficiency will improve seven to twelve percent if you're not in a natural program implants work well and there are feed uh additives like her medicine bovita declinate chloride that can control coccidiosis so if you've ever had coccydiosis outbreak in a cow in a calf crop you'll certainly want to avoid that at all costs because that can certainly ruin your your growth and feed to gain when you have a coccidious outbreak and coccidiosis is a stress related disease so coccidity are always in cattle but when there's enough stresses they can come pathogenic then you end up with your bloody scar issue or nervous coxy issues and of course those can be real problems in a feed yard just like to summarize here that this year we've got higher feed prices it happens every year though but that's higher average daily gains usually have lower cost per pound of gain be sure to consider what feeds you use because there's lots of different options out there and as i did earlier on some of these examples some of these feed costs are priced quite a bit lower so sometimes a corn grain ration is not your cheapest average daily gain or cost per pound again it might include a curl pro a co-product obviously co-products are high in protein and fiber and can help are a nice addition to a ration you start feeding too much though you'll have to make sure the ration is balanced for calcium phosphorus just because the high phosphorous loads concentrations that are in co-products and of course good management always leads to great calf gain",
