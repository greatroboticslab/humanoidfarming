  "text": "hi everyone this is a read it told myself arm this video is about rainwater collection so this is a Quonset hut building that is 40 feet wide by 80 feet long and it's right beside our seedling production greenhouse and we have very saline well water so we're catching rainwater off of one half of the Quonset hut with this gutter just simply anchored into the side of the Quonset with concrete anchors I think we initially did it with lead slugs and ultimately had to replace them with the expansion bolt type of concrete anchors but now it it holds pretty well and whenever it rains the Quonset structure drips into the trough and then the first step here at the outlet it goes down and there's a T facing downwards in the ABS I think it's four inch EVs looks like three or four three apparently and that T goes into a dead-end shunt pipe which runs down and down and down in this little trench always graded and then here's the outlet of that little shunt and you probably can't see but down here is a tiny hole drilled in it and that allows this what's called a roof washer or a first flush diverter it fills up with the first dirty pollen and dust filled first flush of water that lands on roof comes down down the trough through the tea flows down into the shunt pipe fills the first flush diverter and then thereafter the water can continue on into the sump for transfer but that first dirty flow of water goes into the first flush diverter and then in between rainfall events it trickles out through the tiny hole in it so once the diverter is full water flows over here into a sump a nylon stocking as a basic filter for particulate and then ordinary cheap sump pump there's also a stock water here in their stock tank water heater that we use in the early spring to thaw out the block of ice that forms in here in the winter so that we can start running the rainwater collection system earlier rather than having to wait until the ice thaws naturally so then the sump pump runs up through the blue pipe and blue pipes attached to the filler with a cam coupler this one here is overflow should we ever get more than 2,100 gallons so this is a 9,000 litre opaque reservoir which is about 3000 gallons and for every rainfall event here based on the roof surface area if we get a millimeter of rain we get a hundred liters of water for 10 millimeters of rain we get a thousand litres of water so 10 millimeters of rain is like half an inch not quite probably three quarters of an inch of rain is to just know it's like 7/16 of an inch of rain so you have to do 2.5 millimeters of water would be an inch for an inch of rain we get 2500 liters of water which is about I don't know 20 500 litres is I can't figure what that is in gallon but you can see care of this morning's condensation that there's currently between is about 500 gallon of water sitting in the rainwater tank and the ball valve really outlet open and this hose runs over here and into the green house in the green house comes in through the wall and it's one of the two possible sources for this jet pump which is our booster pump to provide pressure here in the greenhouse or watering all of our greenhouse stuff so inside the greenhouse installation looks like this there is a an indoor reservoir here a thousand litre cube and then there's that this connection between the cube and the inbound rainwater and the jet pump so that you can choose which one you're using in the really early spring we start by filling the cube and using that until the weather is warm enough to let us open the valve and use the rainwater system so that's all of our greenhouse water supply for our seedling greenhouse and it makes a huge difference to the quality and health of our seedlings to be able to use rainwater rather than our saline well water which certain things like tomatoes or even more particularly peppers these are happy looking peppers because we've had lots of rain and rainwater this spring but peppers are super sensitive to the salinity needed the disaster when we don't have rain water for them so this is a April stage April 27th this is what our seedling greenhouse looks like in late April I'll do another video about this overhead washing thing which we call this flying sis tune do that in a separate video voila",
