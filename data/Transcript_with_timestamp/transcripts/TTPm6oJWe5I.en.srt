[Music]

2
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:39,809
while farming anyway as a way of life

3
00:00:36,980 --> 00:00:42,210
it's not a job it's a way of life you're

4
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:46,229
gonna be a bottom entity that's how you

5
00:00:42,210 --> 00:00:50,250
have to look at it and organics

6
00:00:46,229 --> 00:00:51,659
definitely is you have to open from my

7
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:54,089
personal point of view is you have to

8
00:00:51,659 --> 00:00:55,829
work with nature of course within

9
00:00:54,089 --> 00:00:59,699
organic farming is a whole spectrum

10
00:00:55,829 --> 00:01:02,489
you're getting some organic farmers who

11
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:04,589
just see that not using chemicals as

12
00:01:02,489 --> 00:01:06,960
they is the answer but they're still

13
00:01:04,589 --> 00:01:09,630
using the industrial model of inputs and

14
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:13,380
outputs in their in their head and then

15
00:01:09,630 --> 00:01:15,569
you get fertility that you have to start

16
00:01:13,380 --> 00:01:17,670
seeing the farm as a whole and has to be

17
00:01:15,569 --> 00:01:19,890
a balance there and that is one of the

18
00:01:17,670 --> 00:01:23,810
main principles of a biodynamic farm

19
00:01:19,890 --> 00:01:27,420
that behind this concept you have that

20
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,369
it it has to be not bringing in inputs

21
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:31,110
from outside that you see that the whole

22
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:33,840
farm is a kind of whole which has to be

23
00:01:31,110 --> 00:01:35,399
in balance but you have to be able to be

24
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:38,849
use all the feed for your animals of

25
00:01:35,399 --> 00:01:40,410
that farm that they in turn will if you

26
00:01:38,849 --> 00:01:42,660
have the right balance of animals will

27
00:01:40,410 --> 00:01:45,060
produce enough manure so different sorts

28
00:01:42,660 --> 00:01:47,610
to maintain and increase the fertility

29
00:01:45,060 --> 00:01:49,709
on the farm the important for in

30
00:01:47,610 --> 00:01:51,989
biodynamic is to have the farmers in

31
00:01:49,709 --> 00:01:54,030
organism so the farm is able to produce

32
00:01:51,989 --> 00:01:57,060
all its own manure and it put a label to

33
00:01:54,030 --> 00:01:59,099
produce its own fertility what people do

34
00:01:57,060 --> 00:02:01,410
here which is much more efficient of

35
00:01:59,099 --> 00:02:03,509
course is then to use the clover to feed

36
00:02:01,410 --> 00:02:06,929
it to your ruminants to your cattle to

37
00:02:03,509 --> 00:02:09,360
your sheep you know to your cows and

38
00:02:06,929 --> 00:02:12,870
they in return give you when you are

39
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,170
it's very important that we all try and

40
00:02:12,870 --> 00:02:22,040
go as organic as possible

41
00:02:15,170 --> 00:02:23,690
for the health of everyone and I think

42
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:25,970
to try and reduce the amount of

43
00:02:23,690 --> 00:02:28,910
chemicals that we're using because

44
00:02:25,970 --> 00:02:30,530
firstly if the food is not organic

45
00:02:28,910 --> 00:02:32,000
you're eating a lot of chemicals anyway

46
00:02:30,530 --> 00:02:34,910
and then there's lots of chemicals used

47
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:38,390
to grow that food so if you can go

48
00:02:34,910 --> 00:02:44,750
organic then it would reduce the damage

49
00:02:38,390 --> 00:02:49,040
to the environment and then on top of

50
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:51,860
that in biodynamic farming there is the

51
00:02:49,040 --> 00:02:53,989
concept of the preparations which are I

52
00:02:51,860 --> 00:02:56,930
think enhancing the manure to a way that

53
00:02:53,989 --> 00:03:01,640
the manure is able to really support the

54
00:02:56,930 --> 00:03:03,680
plant life for it to support the animals

55
00:03:01,640 --> 00:03:06,560
and the people that live on the farm and

56
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,060
feed of the farm so again in creating

57
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:12,440
this cycle of health and sustainability

58
00:03:08,060 --> 00:03:14,500
by having the cows eating grass that is

59
00:03:12,440 --> 00:03:16,880
suitable for them that is healthy and

60
00:03:14,500 --> 00:03:18,620
then this money also goes into the

61
00:03:16,880 --> 00:03:21,079
vegetable garden this money also goes

62
00:03:18,620 --> 00:03:23,540
into producing grain in cereals which

63
00:03:21,079 --> 00:03:30,480
then is fed the people through through

64
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:33,780
the farm shop with organic food

65
00:03:30,480 --> 00:03:36,870
it's a very whole environment that you

66
00:03:33,780 --> 00:03:39,390
grow up in so everything is affecting

67
00:03:36,870 --> 00:03:41,430
that food and I think that makes you

68
00:03:39,390 --> 00:03:42,510
very aware of your environment and what

69
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:46,050
you're bringing in and what you're

70
00:03:42,510 --> 00:03:50,130
putting out so I think to learn to grow

71
00:03:46,050 --> 00:03:55,430
organically is vital for how you treat

72
00:03:50,130 --> 00:03:58,440
the tree and I think if you experience

73
00:03:55,430 --> 00:04:00,599
the goodness that the organics brings in

74
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,150
to your food into your environment then

75
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:06,319
you start to see what else needs to be

76
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:06,319
done around you

77
00:04:10,200 --> 00:04:20,250
cows biodynamically which means that all

78
00:04:18,570 --> 00:04:22,440
of their food comes from our own farm

79
00:04:20,250 --> 00:04:25,350
and it's all grown organically and we

80
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:27,270
use biodynamic preparations the cows

81
00:04:25,350 --> 00:04:29,250
have their horns which we feel is very

82
00:04:27,270 --> 00:04:32,430
important for the digestive systems

83
00:04:29,250 --> 00:04:36,570
which is also reflected in the milk and

84
00:04:32,430 --> 00:04:39,690
the milk is more nutritious and they get

85
00:04:36,570 --> 00:04:43,050
to be outside all through year of the

86
00:04:39,690 --> 00:04:45,539
year and in the summer months spring

87
00:04:43,050 --> 00:04:48,090
summer autumn that they're out on grass

88
00:04:45,539 --> 00:04:50,940
eating grass which is most natural way

89
00:04:48,090 --> 00:04:55,110
for a cow and you can really taste in

90
00:04:50,940 --> 00:04:58,590
the milk that it is sort of fresher more

91
00:04:55,110 --> 00:05:00,030
nutritious and a lot of milk which is

92
00:04:58,590 --> 00:05:02,100
you know blended for many different

93
00:05:00,030 --> 00:05:04,550
farms in which is an organic I think the

94
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:08,610
future is definitely for people to see

95
00:05:04,550 --> 00:05:11,400
not just organic or production but a

96
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:14,460
small-scale small-scale production which

97
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:16,860
is much more manageable for people and

98
00:05:14,460 --> 00:05:18,479
is able to employ more people and

99
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:21,780
empower more people as to where their

100
00:05:18,479 --> 00:05:23,849
food come from and to have healthy food

101
00:05:21,780 --> 00:05:26,099
and have a stronger connection with

102
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:28,530
their food because with industrial

103
00:05:26,099 --> 00:05:30,090
farming we have lost connection with the

104
00:05:28,530 --> 00:05:32,250
source of our food and the quality of

105
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:33,960
our food one person can go to sue and

106
00:05:32,250 --> 00:05:37,470
buy pepper doesn't matter what time of

107
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:39,150
the year we are able to import fruit and

108
00:05:37,470 --> 00:05:41,010
vegetables from all over the world and

109
00:05:39,150 --> 00:05:42,770
we don't think about where food comes

110
00:05:41,010 --> 00:05:44,620
from and how much effort goes into it

111
00:05:42,770 --> 00:05:49,930
but in this farm

112
00:05:44,620 --> 00:05:51,910
it's a small farm 200 acre farm the

113
00:05:49,930 --> 00:05:53,890
people who are fed from this farm that

114
00:05:51,910 --> 00:05:55,600
people are in touch with this farm it's

115
00:05:53,890 --> 00:05:59,860
much more in touch with the food I eat

116
00:05:55,600 --> 00:06:02,470
mainly vegetarian some fish and I tend

117
00:05:59,860 --> 00:06:05,410
to buy from local farmers markets only I

118
00:06:02,470 --> 00:06:09,760
hardly ever enter a supermarket anymore

119
00:06:05,410 --> 00:06:14,830
and eat mainly organic food mainly

120
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:20,200
vegetarian I was vegetarian completely

121
00:06:14,830 --> 00:06:22,150
for it was only two years but I will eat

122
00:06:20,200 --> 00:06:23,710
the meat from this farm or from our

123
00:06:22,150 --> 00:06:26,080
sister farm table house because it's

124
00:06:23,710 --> 00:06:27,790
biodynamic I know the people looking

125
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:30,610
after the animals and I know what food

126
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:33,190
they're eating and they're their

127
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:34,810
environment that they've grown up in so

128
00:06:33,190 --> 00:06:37,060
as long as I know that I'm happy to eat

129
00:06:34,810 --> 00:06:40,960
the meat I became vegetarian when I was

130
00:06:37,060 --> 00:06:46,000
six so I haven't eaten meat in a long

131
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:47,860
time and I think probably if I wasn't

132
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:50,590
already vegetarian then I would probably

133
00:06:47,860 --> 00:06:52,660
eat organic and biodynamic meat but I

134
00:06:50,590 --> 00:06:56,140
don't really have any need for meat now

135
00:06:52,660 --> 00:07:00,420
so I stay vegetarian I was vegetarian as

136
00:06:56,140 --> 00:07:03,610
a child the whole family was vegetarian

137
00:07:00,420 --> 00:07:08,830
but I own eat organic meat really oh by

138
00:07:03,610 --> 00:07:12,490
dynamically vegetarian methods which are

139
00:07:08,830 --> 00:07:14,920
available which can show that we're not

140
00:07:12,490 --> 00:07:17,200
just talking about minerals and pure

141
00:07:14,920 --> 00:07:19,600
substance but there are forces in our

142
00:07:17,200 --> 00:07:22,180
food and working in nature and one of

143
00:07:19,600 --> 00:07:25,680
those methods was developed by Pfeiffer

144
00:07:22,180 --> 00:07:28,690
when he developed the chromatography and

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:32,830
I'm dr. Callisto as well with the

146
00:07:28,690 --> 00:07:36,700
crystallization method and by using that

147
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:40,120
method you can see other than just the

148
00:07:36,700 --> 00:07:42,580
chemical constituents of something but

149
00:07:40,120 --> 00:07:45,430
it actually shows completely different

150
00:07:42,580 --> 00:07:48,520
picture depending on how alive or dead

151
00:07:45,430 --> 00:07:51,760
it is if there are forces in that or not

152
00:07:48,520 --> 00:07:55,030
and and these pictures are quite

153
00:07:51,760 --> 00:07:57,880
objective and it's absolutely clear you

154
00:07:55,030 --> 00:07:58,570
can take a dead soil and take a sample

155
00:07:57,880 --> 00:08:00,580
from that

156
00:07:58,570 --> 00:08:03,070
and one which has been enlivened of that

157
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:05,140
same soil with compost and by dynamic

158
00:08:03,070 --> 00:08:08,320
methods and it creates a completely

159
00:08:05,140 --> 00:08:13,030
different picture each farm is a small

160
00:08:08,320 --> 00:08:15,970
community of friend colleagues for being

161
00:08:13,030 --> 00:08:19,930
interested in organic agriculture and

162
00:08:15,970 --> 00:08:21,610
what the farm does here is to do with

163
00:08:19,930 --> 00:08:24,490
the fact that you can involve the

164
00:08:21,610 --> 00:08:27,040
community in it and also when you work

165
00:08:24,490 --> 00:08:29,560
with biodynamic agriculture organic

166
00:08:27,040 --> 00:08:32,979
agriculture they're actually producing

167
00:08:29,560 --> 00:08:36,790
food that people can trust so after I

168
00:08:32,979 --> 00:08:39,610
became more interested in organic food

169
00:08:36,790 --> 00:08:40,479
and growing my own food and cooking my

170
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:44,800
own food

171
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:47,920
I got also interested in what isn't

172
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:53,230
organic or the conventional and and the

173
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:55,600
use of GMOs and me personally I'm

174
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,760
completely against using GMOs when

175
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,050
you're cooking or or eating or anywhere

176
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:02,350
because they unfortunately are

177
00:08:59,050 --> 00:09:06,070
everywhere plant is genetically modified

178
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:10,410
it's missing a vital part of the life of

179
00:09:06,070 --> 00:09:14,440
the plant and when you consume that

180
00:09:10,410 --> 00:09:17,680
you're also missing that vital part of

181
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:20,770
life yeah I personally don't believe or

182
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:23,410
believe in GMOs because of the health

183
00:09:20,770 --> 00:09:25,810
benefits of wealth for people and for

184
00:09:23,410 --> 00:09:31,270
the for the planet as a whole I don't

185
00:09:25,810 --> 00:09:35,280
think there that's gene-splicing is an

186
00:09:31,270 --> 00:09:38,560
advantage I haven't seen proof of it

187
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:40,750
getting better yields the only potential

188
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:43,360
downsides I think and which is why I

189
00:09:40,750 --> 00:09:47,490
avoid it is that it'll have an effect on

190
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:50,310
us do you know food I think is a

191
00:09:47,490 --> 00:09:52,170
limiting food source

192
00:09:50,310 --> 00:09:54,630
and limit your diet it limits the

193
00:09:52,170 --> 00:09:57,090
variety you can eat and it makes you

194
00:09:54,630 --> 00:10:01,770
very dependent on the seed companies

195
00:09:57,090 --> 00:10:03,870
that produce this GMO seed you can't

196
00:10:01,770 --> 00:10:08,090
save the seed you can't grow next year

197
00:10:03,870 --> 00:10:10,830
from the same seed so for me that raises

198
00:10:08,090 --> 00:10:13,040
questions about how good it is for you

199
00:10:10,830 --> 00:10:16,650
if it yes it's not fertile enough to

200
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:21,300
produce its own seed that is viable then

201
00:10:16,650 --> 00:10:23,190
to eat foods like that I don't know how

202
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:25,460
good that is for your body the

203
00:10:23,190 --> 00:10:28,200
Terminator gene in it which means that

204
00:10:25,460 --> 00:10:30,450
the plant is not able to produce seeds

205
00:10:28,200 --> 00:10:32,820
for the next generation how does that

206
00:10:30,450 --> 00:10:35,910
affect also honor on a material level on

207
00:10:32,820 --> 00:10:37,770
a nutrient level maybe there is nothing

208
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:41,160
there it's the same as organic or

209
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:42,900
biodynamic soya but for me from a

210
00:10:41,160 --> 00:10:45,660
quality point of view ask the question

211
00:10:42,900 --> 00:10:47,280
how does it affect my own fertility if

212
00:10:45,660 --> 00:10:49,350
I'm eating food that is not able to

213
00:10:47,280 --> 00:10:52,530
carry its offspring is not able to

214
00:10:49,350 --> 00:10:55,290
produce the next generation is God is

215
00:10:52,530 --> 00:10:57,510
that not just only not able to is got a

216
00:10:55,290 --> 00:11:00,990
gene that that is a terminator that

217
00:10:57,510 --> 00:11:04,560
kills it the the risk of cross

218
00:11:00,990 --> 00:11:07,230
contamination not only from one plant or

219
00:11:04,560 --> 00:11:10,200
the other but from one plant to bacteria

220
00:11:07,230 --> 00:11:13,320
to other organisms and so on and so on

221
00:11:10,200 --> 00:11:15,780
it's a you don't know what you are

222
00:11:13,320 --> 00:11:18,000
unleashing you have no idea but what one

223
00:11:15,780 --> 00:11:21,330
thing is absolutely sure whatever you do

224
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:24,270
it's completely irreversible you will

225
00:11:21,330 --> 00:11:26,880
never be able to stop it again once it's

226
00:11:24,270 --> 00:11:29,790
out there it will be out there if it's

227
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,800
working out in a bad way there's no way

228
00:11:29,790 --> 00:11:35,580
to reverse this process I'm very

229
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:38,880
suspicious of GMOs I have to say I

230
00:11:35,580 --> 00:11:42,260
always try to buy from local farms when

231
00:11:38,880 --> 00:11:44,760
I don't get my food from my own farm and

232
00:11:42,260 --> 00:11:47,220
then I know I can trust the food I know

233
00:11:44,760 --> 00:11:50,370
that I can talk to the farmers and see

234
00:11:47,220 --> 00:11:51,870
how it was made and you know understand

235
00:11:50,370 --> 00:11:55,279
the attitude of the people who made it

236
00:11:51,870 --> 00:12:00,000
so that's really important to me

237
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:02,700
GMOs have clearly you know they've

238
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,650
historically they've been associated

239
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:08,640
with using pesticides

240
00:12:04,650 --> 00:12:11,460
they've been associated with you know

241
00:12:08,640 --> 00:12:14,570
infertility of seeds and things like

242
00:12:11,460 --> 00:12:16,830
that and exploitation of farmers so

243
00:12:14,570 --> 00:12:21,330
personally they're clear with them as

244
00:12:16,830 --> 00:12:22,980
much as I can but also in the UK as well

245
00:12:21,330 --> 00:12:24,990
as in a lot of countries sometimes

246
00:12:22,980 --> 00:12:27,089
unless you are buying organic it's

247
00:12:24,990 --> 00:12:29,940
impossible to know because they don't

248
00:12:27,089 --> 00:12:33,660
label that something has got GMOs in it

249
00:12:29,940 --> 00:12:36,029
so that makes it very hard to always be

250
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:38,190
certain and the last thing is that it

251
00:12:36,029 --> 00:12:41,010
you know now a time and time again it

252
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:43,589
proves that GMO doesn't work again it's

253
00:12:41,010 --> 00:12:47,820
the question of sustainability the fact

254
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:50,220
that I saw maybe a field of of GMO corn

255
00:12:47,820 --> 00:12:52,710
and it's grown a good crop one year it

256
00:12:50,220 --> 00:12:55,230
doesn't mean that it will go food every

257
00:12:52,710 --> 00:12:57,690
year a lot of GMO crops have proved to

258
00:12:55,230 --> 00:13:01,350
fail they don't have higher yields but

259
00:12:57,690 --> 00:13:04,560
and they still need to have pesticides

260
00:13:01,350 --> 00:13:06,720
herbicides and fungicides and the result

261
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,830
of it is then you get resistant strains

262
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:15,660
like the super weeds like and and this

263
00:13:10,830 --> 00:13:17,550
just becomes a it just becomes an

264
00:13:15,660 --> 00:13:19,110
accelerating process so if you get super

265
00:13:17,550 --> 00:13:21,029
weeds then you need to use more poisons

266
00:13:19,110 --> 00:13:22,650
and more poisons and then you need the

267
00:13:21,029 --> 00:13:24,270
weeds get stronger and stronger and

268
00:13:22,650 --> 00:13:25,860
you're not really solving the problem

269
00:13:24,270 --> 00:13:28,350
the problem is not really solved well if

270
00:13:25,860 --> 00:13:30,360
you create a balanced ecological system

271
00:13:28,350 --> 00:13:31,980
and acknowledge the fact that there will

272
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:34,589
be weeds that they will be pests and

273
00:13:31,980 --> 00:13:37,230
there will be diseases but to keep it in

274
00:13:34,589 --> 00:13:39,420
in a balanced way I think it's much more

275
00:13:37,230 --> 00:13:44,040
healthier slightest interest in going

276
00:13:39,420 --> 00:13:46,920
back to growing your own food or buying

277
00:13:44,040 --> 00:13:49,550
from local growers you should try and do

278
00:13:46,920 --> 00:13:49,550
it because

279
00:13:50,810 --> 00:13:57,570
to me that is the future basically when

280
00:13:55,260 --> 00:14:00,270
you live in a city and you live just

281
00:13:57,570 --> 00:14:03,300
with technology all around you where

282
00:14:00,270 --> 00:14:06,750
life is so very so fast-paced you

283
00:14:03,300 --> 00:14:10,290
actually gradually completely lose your

284
00:14:06,750 --> 00:14:13,980
identity and you completely lose a sense

285
00:14:10,290 --> 00:14:16,830
of what life really is about so for me

286
00:14:13,980 --> 00:14:19,050
the journey of returning back to nature

287
00:14:16,830 --> 00:14:21,900
and to working with the soil and with

288
00:14:19,050 --> 00:14:24,630
plants every day has just been an

289
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:27,450
amazing journey like I have had so many

290
00:14:24,630 --> 00:14:30,780
moments in the last year year and a half

291
00:14:27,450 --> 00:14:33,740
where I felt so content and so connected

292
00:14:30,780 --> 00:14:39,600
and where I've really been able to feel

293
00:14:33,740 --> 00:14:41,700
joy just being with color with yeah

294
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:48,390
sounds of nature there's so much more

295
00:14:41,700 --> 00:14:50,340
than just nutrition that you get so if

296
00:14:48,390 --> 00:14:52,620
you have a chance and I would say try

297
00:14:50,340 --> 00:14:55,820
and leave that bubble where you're

298
00:14:52,620 --> 00:14:59,040
completely blinded and numbed by

299
00:14:55,820 --> 00:15:02,840
technology and just try and go back to

300
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:05,520
nature wherever you can find it really

301
00:15:02,840 --> 00:15:09,570
it I think it states the only way for

302
00:15:05,520 --> 00:15:11,580
its small scale growing a lot of small

303
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:14,490
farms aren't able to grow and specialize

304
00:15:11,580 --> 00:15:17,940
in certain things and but grow also a

305
00:15:14,490 --> 00:15:22,290
wide variety of food in vegetables it's

306
00:15:17,940 --> 00:15:28,230
also fun you know it is I wouldn't

307
00:15:22,290 --> 00:15:32,280
choose it if it wasn't I like it's very

308
00:15:28,230 --> 00:15:34,230
seasonal it's very rhythmic you always

309
00:15:32,280 --> 00:15:35,040
have the most amazing food right at your

310
00:15:34,230 --> 00:15:36,630
fingertips

311
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:38,250
so I would definitely recommend everyone

312
00:15:36,630 --> 00:15:40,800
get into farming but it is really hard

313
00:15:38,250 --> 00:15:45,529
work and obviously if you're doing

314
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:48,829
farming and do organic farming because

315
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:51,320
if you are a young person living in a

316
00:15:48,829 --> 00:15:53,660
city and you have a desire to find out

317
00:15:51,320 --> 00:15:57,170
what it's all about you just need to go

318
00:15:53,660 --> 00:16:00,589
onto websites like the woof websites or

319
00:15:57,170 --> 00:16:03,050
help X or there are so many resources on

320
00:16:00,589 --> 00:16:06,230
the internet now that can allow you to

321
00:16:03,050 --> 00:16:08,180
go and stay on organic farms in your own

322
00:16:06,230 --> 00:16:10,820
country even you don't have to travel

323
00:16:08,180 --> 00:16:14,510
around the world but that you can go and

324
00:16:10,820 --> 00:16:17,029
stay at places like that and get an

325
00:16:14,510 --> 00:16:21,170
experience volunteering for a few months

326
00:16:17,029 --> 00:16:24,889
or even for a few weeks that would be a

327
00:16:21,170 --> 00:16:28,040
great thing to do or alternatively try

328
00:16:24,889 --> 00:16:30,649
and find in your own City if there are a

329
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:33,620
lot months available community projects

330
00:16:30,649 --> 00:16:35,959
community allotments like here in the UK

331
00:16:33,620 --> 00:16:37,760
we have quite a lot of those projects

332
00:16:35,959 --> 00:16:39,560
and even while I was still working in an

333
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:42,290
office I used to go and volunteer on

334
00:16:39,560 --> 00:16:44,630
Sunday afternoons try and find some of

335
00:16:42,290 --> 00:16:46,920
these projects and help thee allow these

336
00:16:44,630 --> 00:16:49,829
projects to help you spark

337
00:16:46,920 --> 00:16:53,579
something we need to change your

338
00:16:49,829 --> 00:16:56,989
lifestyle I really understand organics

339
00:16:53,579 --> 00:16:56,989
is about just five

340
00:16:59,870 --> 00:17:01,930
you

341
00:17:08,619 --> 00:17:11,909
[Music]

342
00:17:16,849 --> 00:17:29,559
[Music]

343
00:18:19,470 --> 00:18:21,530
you

344
00:19:47,080 --> 00:19:53,679
hi this is Bart from the no plot

345
00:19:50,110 --> 00:19:55,950
no pod or today we're here at rounder

346
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:59,230
organic farms with out of silverstein

347
00:19:55,950 --> 00:20:01,330
Meyer and at was going to take us on a

348
00:19:59,230 --> 00:20:04,330
tour of this organic farm and teach us

349
00:20:01,330 --> 00:20:08,030
some of the tricks that he uses

350
00:20:04,330 --> 00:20:10,040
crops without pesticides or fertilizers

351
00:20:08,030 --> 00:20:15,470
now most people when they keep chickens

352
00:20:10,040 --> 00:20:17,630
they may not even have a single - you

353
00:20:15,470 --> 00:20:44,540
can build a roosting pet and you kept

354
00:20:17,630 --> 00:20:48,260
all the manure it's very cool see all

355
00:20:44,540 --> 00:20:51,110
the manure that's accumulating great

356
00:20:48,260 --> 00:20:52,430
fertilizer so basically if you look

357
00:20:51,110 --> 00:20:54,800
around in this room that is the only

358
00:20:52,430 --> 00:20:56,930
spot the chickens have to sit even

359
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:58,490
awhile other than the nesting boxes but

360
00:20:56,930 --> 00:21:00,590
if you look like above the nesting boxes

361
00:20:58,490 --> 00:21:01,910
how we did that slope over there that's

362
00:21:00,590 --> 00:21:04,070
so they can't sit up there

363
00:21:01,910 --> 00:21:06,050
I see they really spend all their time

364
00:21:04,070 --> 00:21:07,790
when they're in here sitting over there

365
00:21:06,050 --> 00:21:09,560
okay that's why all the manure

366
00:21:07,790 --> 00:21:11,690
accumulates over there and then there's

367
00:21:09,560 --> 00:21:13,040
a trap door something is a trap door on

368
00:21:11,690 --> 00:21:14,870
the outside of the building you lift up

369
00:21:13,040 --> 00:21:17,420
and you can shovel that manure out okay

370
00:21:14,870 --> 00:21:19,370
how long does it take to collect that

371
00:21:17,420 --> 00:21:21,440
much I mean that's like a year that's a

372
00:21:19,370 --> 00:21:23,660
year okay depends on how many chickens

373
00:21:21,440 --> 00:21:26,120
you have and but supposedly they're like

374
00:21:23,660 --> 00:21:29,900
70 to 80% or more of their manure is

375
00:21:26,120 --> 00:21:32,120
being dropped right there okay and that

376
00:21:29,900 --> 00:21:34,820
manure is pretty concentrated very

377
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:40,520
concentrated hot fertilizer you probably

378
00:21:34,820 --> 00:21:43,520
want to let it sit okay and I see

379
00:21:40,520 --> 00:21:45,350
compost to that for a year how much

380
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:47,540
coverage would you get out of that much

381
00:21:45,350 --> 00:21:48,710
fertilizer well I mean usually when I'm

382
00:21:47,540 --> 00:21:51,290
spreading and I'm just spreading like a

383
00:21:48,710 --> 00:21:55,780
quarter inch you know on surface and

384
00:21:51,290 --> 00:21:55,780
soil are 500 pounds per acre okay

385
00:21:55,950 --> 00:22:00,540
you don't really eat you this whole body

386
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:39,490
let's go around back here okay door that

387
00:22:26,590 --> 00:23:01,660
they can get in and out of here huh over

388
00:22:39,490 --> 00:23:37,900
the fence out here okay and they took

389
00:23:01,660 --> 00:24:32,080
over the edge okay so okay your tractor

390
00:23:37,900 --> 00:24:34,900
over with the bucket yeah the remnants

391
00:24:32,080 --> 00:24:37,300
of the veggies you know yep and leaving

392
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:39,700
their fertilizer for us very nice so

393
00:24:37,300 --> 00:24:42,819
that's part of it

394
00:24:39,700 --> 00:24:42,819
[Applause]

395
00:24:44,940 --> 00:24:50,469
and then I'm kind of a big believer and

396
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:53,799
just for taking care of your soil and

397
00:24:50,469 --> 00:24:56,739
then if you have healthy soils that most

398
00:24:53,799 --> 00:24:58,119
for the most part most soils have a lot

399
00:24:56,739 --> 00:25:00,190
of the nutrients that the plants need

400
00:24:58,119 --> 00:25:02,469
and a lot of times when you have poor

401
00:25:00,190 --> 00:25:06,190
growth that's because plants can't get

402
00:25:02,469 --> 00:25:08,289
at the nutrients that they need okay so

403
00:25:06,190 --> 00:25:10,389
a lot of times just by working your

404
00:25:08,289 --> 00:25:13,210
soils by tilling them by irrigating them

405
00:25:10,389 --> 00:25:16,659
well in our case irrigation spreading

406
00:25:13,210 --> 00:25:18,700
some manure you'll you'll start to

407
00:25:16,659 --> 00:25:20,499
improve the soil over the years of just

408
00:25:18,700 --> 00:25:22,659
just the factor of aerating them you

409
00:25:20,499 --> 00:25:23,950
know just telling them growing some kind

410
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:26,109
of a crop even if you're just growing a

411
00:25:23,950 --> 00:25:32,619
cover crop like a crop that's just to

412
00:25:26,109 --> 00:25:34,839
improve the soil okay clover or alfalfa

413
00:25:32,619 --> 00:25:36,489
and then later in the season just mow

414
00:25:34,839 --> 00:25:39,039
that down or till that back into the

415
00:25:36,489 --> 00:25:41,139
soil okay and that process kind of helps

416
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,059
rejuvenate the soils and so part of what

417
00:25:41,139 --> 00:25:44,889
I'm doing is I've got you know 15 acres

418
00:25:43,059 --> 00:25:48,190
but I may be growing veggies on five

419
00:25:44,889 --> 00:25:50,950
acres and and the other acreage each

420
00:25:48,190 --> 00:25:52,210
year is is either fallow it's unused or

421
00:25:50,950 --> 00:25:57,700
it's been some kind of a cover crop

422
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:59,469
that's growing so and I sort of have

423
00:25:57,700 --> 00:26:01,359
this slow approach I'm not real big on

424
00:25:59,469 --> 00:26:03,549
fertilizers I kind of feel like the

425
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:05,080
chemical fertilizers time to pump things

426
00:26:03,549 --> 00:26:07,330
up they increase the amount of water

427
00:26:05,080 --> 00:26:08,859
that the plans I've taken crop gets

428
00:26:07,330 --> 00:26:11,379
bigger but I don't think it necessarily

429
00:26:08,859 --> 00:26:13,179
makes it taste better and I don't think

430
00:26:11,379 --> 00:26:15,129
that if you're not in a hurry

431
00:26:13,179 --> 00:26:18,399
then you get the same kind of yields

432
00:26:15,129 --> 00:26:19,719
without the chemical fertilizers it just

433
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:21,999
takes a look maybe a little bit longer

434
00:26:19,719 --> 00:26:23,769
for the plants to reach maturity but I

435
00:26:21,999 --> 00:26:25,179
think they're healthier I think

436
00:26:23,769 --> 00:26:27,899
sometimes if your plants are growing too

437
00:26:25,179 --> 00:26:27,899
fast they're weak

438
00:26:34,700 --> 00:26:40,080
so I kind of had this idea that plants

439
00:26:37,950 --> 00:26:42,929
like people have an immune system and

440
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:45,929
that that they have a resistance to

441
00:26:42,929 --> 00:26:49,620
things like pests but if they're weak

442
00:26:45,929 --> 00:26:51,559
the pests will have at them and you see

443
00:26:49,620 --> 00:26:54,929
that we I see that in the field because

444
00:26:51,559 --> 00:26:56,730
often the ends of my badge the far ends

445
00:26:54,929 --> 00:26:58,350
are the part where the pests do the most

446
00:26:56,730 --> 00:26:59,820
damage and a part of that is the

447
00:26:58,350 --> 00:27:02,429
pressure coming from outside the field

448
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:03,690
but part of is that the the ones the

449
00:27:02,429 --> 00:27:05,220
plants that are growing at the ends of

450
00:27:03,690 --> 00:27:08,460
the beds are always the weakest because

451
00:27:05,220 --> 00:27:10,620
they get trampled as you walk you know

452
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:12,419
cut the corners with the tractor or they

453
00:27:10,620 --> 00:27:13,770
don't get weeded as well or they don't

454
00:27:12,419 --> 00:27:15,960
get watered as well because they're at

455
00:27:13,770 --> 00:27:18,390
the edge of the irrigation set so those

456
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:20,970
plants are weaker to begin with and then

457
00:27:18,390 --> 00:27:23,220
that weakness translates into them

458
00:27:20,970 --> 00:27:24,330
having more pressure from pests huh

459
00:27:23,220 --> 00:27:26,630
that's interesting

460
00:27:24,330 --> 00:27:29,400
I got that from one of my teachers who

461
00:27:26,630 --> 00:27:36,150
was really into the whole immune system

462
00:27:29,400 --> 00:27:39,299
and immunities when they're weak and you

463
00:27:36,150 --> 00:27:42,590
definitely see that as plants start to

464
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:44,910
decline the pests kind of will move in

465
00:27:42,590 --> 00:27:46,559
the other thing big thing that we're

466
00:27:44,910 --> 00:27:50,580
doing out here for pests really is not

467
00:27:46,559 --> 00:27:52,230
mono cropping you know I do have some

468
00:27:50,580 --> 00:27:55,080
crops like corn maybe we'll have a

469
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:57,240
quarter acre of it but for the most part

470
00:27:55,080 --> 00:28:02,700
you know what you see little patches yes

471
00:27:57,240 --> 00:28:05,370
the row of that field that are that are

472
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:08,640
mostly just grown for the birds that

473
00:28:05,370 --> 00:28:10,679
like them I grow there's a couple of

474
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:14,760
crops that I grow like dill and cilantro

475
00:28:10,679 --> 00:28:16,650
that I will let go to flower and those

476
00:28:14,760 --> 00:28:19,410
flowers will attract beneficial insects

477
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:22,710
okay but the big thing about having the

478
00:28:19,410 --> 00:28:24,929
diversity is just that you're you're

479
00:28:22,710 --> 00:28:27,510
reducing the habitat for the for the bad

480
00:28:24,929 --> 00:28:29,730
insects for your past so if you have a

481
00:28:27,510 --> 00:28:32,309
you know 10 acres of corn and then you

482
00:28:29,730 --> 00:28:33,780
have a pests it likes corn they're just

483
00:28:32,309 --> 00:28:35,490
going to flourish in there and go crazy

484
00:28:33,780 --> 00:28:36,540
in your corn but if you just have a

485
00:28:35,490 --> 00:28:37,679
little passion then you have something

486
00:28:36,540 --> 00:28:39,630
else to have something else that there's

487
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,299
different pests that like each different

488
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:44,100
crop so you're sort of giving them less

489
00:28:42,299 --> 00:28:46,300
territory to move in

490
00:28:44,100 --> 00:28:47,710
and at least in our climate a lot of the

491
00:28:46,300 --> 00:28:49,840
pests actually they they emigrate and

492
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:51,910
each year they don't overwinter here so

493
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:53,980
each year they have to come find you

494
00:28:51,910 --> 00:28:55,030
and if you've just got a little bit of

495
00:28:53,980 --> 00:28:56,280
this and a little bit of that it's

496
00:28:55,030 --> 00:28:58,990
harder for them to find you

497
00:28:56,280 --> 00:29:01,150
very loose yeah and then of course

498
00:28:58,990 --> 00:29:03,160
you're also you're putting yourself at

499
00:29:01,150 --> 00:29:06,160
less risk in terms of failure if you

500
00:29:03,160 --> 00:29:08,140
have one crop that fails out of 25 crops

501
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:10,210
that you're growing it's not as much a

502
00:29:08,140 --> 00:29:12,280
problem as if you're just going to crops

503
00:29:10,210 --> 00:29:15,040
and you lose one of them so that's

504
00:29:12,280 --> 00:29:16,600
another way that diversity helps so it

505
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:18,970
sounds like diversity is a big part of

506
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:21,610
your strategy all the way around it is

507
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:25,270
and also for nutrients per pass for

508
00:29:21,610 --> 00:29:26,830
diseases soil diseases so diversity also

509
00:29:25,270 --> 00:29:28,600
plays into rotation where you're not

510
00:29:26,830 --> 00:29:31,290
growing the same crop in the same land

511
00:29:28,600 --> 00:29:31,290
over and over again

512
00:30:44,820 --> 00:30:47,820
cauliflower

513
00:30:57,500 --> 00:31:03,960
and there's the Crucifier CA which is

514
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:07,490
like the or Brassica brassicas they're

515
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:13,140
called broccoli cauliflower kale cabbage

516
00:31:07,490 --> 00:31:16,170
all those are in that same family let's

517
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:17,970
see what other vegetable crops are there

518
00:31:16,170 --> 00:31:24,299
there's the alliums which is like the

519
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:38,429
onions the garlic shallots leeks all

520
00:31:24,299 --> 00:31:40,440
those other smelling I look I've got a

521
00:31:38,429 --> 00:31:42,360
book that's a little more of a guy that

522
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:44,790
would give us like all the information

523
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:46,200
but but the idea is that each you know

524
00:31:44,790 --> 00:31:47,640
there really aren't that many different

525
00:31:46,200 --> 00:31:50,730
plant families that we have I think in

526
00:31:47,640 --> 00:31:52,530
justify vegetables and they each one of

527
00:31:50,730 --> 00:31:55,380
those plant families as you get to know

528
00:31:52,530 --> 00:31:57,210
them as a farmer they really are this is

529
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:59,160
very similar you know broccoli grows

530
00:31:57,210 --> 00:32:05,010
very similar to cauliflower they like

531
00:31:59,160 --> 00:32:25,260
the same conditions they use the same so

532
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:26,910
really that plays into a very nice the

533
00:32:25,260 --> 00:32:29,610
other thing we do for passes we use

534
00:32:26,910 --> 00:32:34,110
these this reamain material that's gonna

535
00:32:29,610 --> 00:32:35,610
be hard to come by in order stuff

536
00:32:34,110 --> 00:32:37,679
through the mail but that is a like a

537
00:32:35,610 --> 00:32:39,419
fabric it's probably something they

538
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,010
could make very similar but like we have

539
00:32:39,419 --> 00:32:44,910
problems with a certain pass that gets

540
00:32:41,010 --> 00:32:46,559
on our soft leafed like the taut soy's

541
00:32:44,910 --> 00:32:48,299
and the BOK Choy's of stuff it's the

542
00:32:46,559 --> 00:32:51,059
flea beetle will just eat those up so we

543
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:52,950
cover those crops with this very thin

544
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:56,070
kind of fabric it's an agricultural

545
00:32:52,950 --> 00:32:59,150
fabric rimae and it allows the air and

546
00:32:56,070 --> 00:32:59,150
the water and the sunlight

547
00:33:00,410 --> 00:33:57,800
you have some of that around crawl

548
00:33:44,900 --> 00:34:01,160
around the breakers but it's just much

549
00:33:57,800 --> 00:34:02,480
much less okay so that's what it sounds

550
00:34:01,160 --> 00:34:04,330
like is that you're never going to

551
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:06,620
eliminate your pass on an organic farm

552
00:34:04,330 --> 00:34:10,550
but doing everything you can to

553
00:34:06,620 --> 00:34:13,610
interrupt their lifecycle yep yep and

554
00:34:10,550 --> 00:34:15,800
you know people some people are you know

555
00:34:13,610 --> 00:34:17,390
we we have the benefit of growing in a

556
00:34:15,800 --> 00:34:19,010
desert climate so we don't really have

557
00:34:17,390 --> 00:34:23,060
the kinds of best measures that some

558
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:29,540
people have but like our organic fruit

559
00:34:23,060 --> 00:34:31,250
tree growers and they're spraying some

560
00:34:29,540 --> 00:34:33,830
kind of an oil that has some kind of a

561
00:34:31,250 --> 00:34:35,870
plant extract in it that's sick to those

562
00:34:33,830 --> 00:34:38,240
bugs you know okay and it's organic

563
00:34:35,870 --> 00:34:39,770
because it's made with organic source

564
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:41,600
materials that still sort of be very

565
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:43,790
intensive it requires a lot of

566
00:34:41,600 --> 00:34:45,800
intervention yeah mostly what I'm doing

567
00:34:43,790 --> 00:34:48,650
is doesn't require a lot of intervention

568
00:34:45,800 --> 00:34:51,830
I'm mostly succeeding by the diversity

569
00:34:48,650 --> 00:34:53,510
like I mentioned and volume and also

570
00:34:51,830 --> 00:34:57,940
choosing it to grow here where there's

571
00:34:53,510 --> 00:34:57,940
not a lot of pests various yeah

572
00:35:05,430 --> 00:35:11,890
do you bring in beneficial insects you

573
00:35:08,950 --> 00:35:14,050
know I have before but for the most part

574
00:35:11,890 --> 00:35:15,820
I've kind of stopped doing that it's

575
00:35:14,050 --> 00:35:17,290
really most effective when you when

576
00:35:15,820 --> 00:35:21,340
you're in like a greenhouse and you can

577
00:35:17,290 --> 00:35:23,020
keep them from flying away you know and

578
00:35:21,340 --> 00:35:24,460
they do sell like you can get these bags

579
00:35:23,020 --> 00:35:26,290
of ladybugs and you go and you spread

580
00:35:24,460 --> 00:35:28,330
them and they're ravenous when they come

581
00:35:26,290 --> 00:35:31,120
and and then you just watch them go to

582
00:35:28,330 --> 00:35:34,150
work but later they're kind of gone okay

583
00:35:31,120 --> 00:35:35,800
move on unless there's something

584
00:35:34,150 --> 00:35:37,900
most of what I try to do is just again

585
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,520
create that habitat for them so when I

586
00:35:37,900 --> 00:35:41,950
grow these breaks of dill and cilantro

587
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:43,930
and the ladybugs are drawn to that and

588
00:35:41,950 --> 00:35:47,560
then they'll they'll go out and find

589
00:35:43,930 --> 00:35:49,510
other food okay so dill and cilantro or

590
00:35:47,560 --> 00:35:51,640
your big favorites for a favorites there

591
00:35:49,510 --> 00:35:52,750
there in Umbra philaret family I was one

592
00:35:51,640 --> 00:35:56,410
family we didn't talk about the

593
00:35:52,750 --> 00:35:58,810
character in that family what else is in

594
00:35:56,410 --> 00:36:03,220
that family I'm bull philaret

595
00:35:58,810 --> 00:36:05,410
it's and and they make they all make a

596
00:36:03,220 --> 00:36:06,040
similar kind of flower that's it's like

597
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:09,640
an umbrella

598
00:36:06,040 --> 00:36:12,540
okay I'm bull comes from and and those

599
00:36:09,640 --> 00:36:12,540
flower heads

600
00:36:27,039 --> 00:36:33,440
that's dill okay that's the classic

601
00:36:30,470 --> 00:36:35,599
humble family so there's quite a few

602
00:36:33,440 --> 00:36:37,309
plants that have that same shaped

603
00:36:35,599 --> 00:36:39,230
sometimes they're white sometimes a

604
00:36:37,309 --> 00:36:47,240
yellow but they always have that kind of

605
00:36:39,230 --> 00:36:49,880
open up you know okay and do you plant

606
00:36:47,240 --> 00:36:52,910
the dill in with other crops directly no

607
00:36:49,880 --> 00:36:55,130
but what happens is it goes to seed

608
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:57,499
every year okay every year it's kind of

609
00:36:55,130 --> 00:36:59,630
just comes up wherever it and if I don't

610
00:36:57,499 --> 00:37:02,180
weed it out then it's it's there

611
00:36:59,630 --> 00:37:04,999
okay in this case I specifically left

612
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,039
this I mowed over the tops and most of

613
00:37:04,999 --> 00:37:08,839
this potatoes to knock the weeds down

614
00:37:07,039 --> 00:37:13,690
but I didn't know this people would want

615
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:13,690
deal for their pickling projects I say

616
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:39,920
that worked out what do we have grown

617
00:37:22,009 --> 00:37:42,259
over here that kind of diversity is more

618
00:37:39,920 --> 00:38:10,460
just about people enjoying the different

619
00:37:42,259 --> 00:38:12,289
colors we see these sections that's one

620
00:38:10,460 --> 00:38:23,180
other thing that happens that works

621
00:38:12,289 --> 00:38:24,380
against okay so I'll clump together

622
00:38:23,180 --> 00:38:25,609
these breasts because even though

623
00:38:24,380 --> 00:38:29,410
ideally maybe they would be more

624
00:38:25,609 --> 00:38:29,410
separated you know these are all

625
00:38:36,450 --> 00:38:41,310
to get water Dalton and that's probably

626
00:38:45,860 --> 00:38:49,050
[Music]

627
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:20,130
okay rocks in our soil

628
00:39:38,310 --> 00:39:41,400
[Music]

629
00:39:53,350 --> 00:39:58,530
[Music]

630
00:40:07,000 --> 00:40:10,719
[Music]

631
00:40:29,059 --> 00:40:37,099
have things come up in onedrive now over

632
00:40:35,569 --> 00:40:38,749
over like several years of farming

633
00:40:37,099 --> 00:40:40,759
you'll start to see different types of

634
00:40:38,749 --> 00:40:45,619
weeds that you didn't have before just

635
00:40:40,759 --> 00:40:56,989
because they're your soil okay and what

636
00:40:45,619 --> 00:40:58,579
types of things can you deal with where

637
00:40:56,989 --> 00:41:00,679
I can get the tractor set up and and

638
00:40:58,579 --> 00:41:03,079
tear through there with blades behind my

639
00:41:00,679 --> 00:41:19,429
wheels and and get a lot of the weeds

640
00:41:03,079 --> 00:41:24,109
that way but for most of the crops use

641
00:41:19,429 --> 00:41:26,059
in this pulling motion towards you the

642
00:41:24,109 --> 00:41:28,219
biggest thing that I found about weeding

643
00:41:26,059 --> 00:41:30,439
is that the timing is really critical

644
00:41:28,219 --> 00:41:31,939
you have to leave before the weeds get

645
00:41:30,439 --> 00:41:37,099
too big or you wind up doing a lot more

646
00:41:31,939 --> 00:41:39,019
work and so getting to the weeds at just

647
00:41:37,099 --> 00:41:42,169
the right point is really important in

648
00:41:39,019 --> 00:41:44,029
terms of being efficient also the

649
00:41:42,169 --> 00:41:45,650
moisture level of the soil is really

650
00:41:44,029 --> 00:41:48,079
important when you're weeding so in our

651
00:41:45,650 --> 00:41:50,599
climate where it's dry and we can

652
00:41:48,079 --> 00:41:53,390
control the moisture level you know I

653
00:41:50,599 --> 00:41:57,289
try to make sure that the soil that

654
00:41:53,390 --> 00:41:59,779
we're we're cultivating hoeing is not

655
00:41:57,289 --> 00:42:02,089
soaking wet because it'll just the mud

656
00:41:59,779 --> 00:42:03,890
will just clog up your tool you also

657
00:42:02,089 --> 00:42:05,539
don't want it to be super super dry

658
00:42:03,890 --> 00:42:07,579
because the soil just gets hard when

659
00:42:05,539 --> 00:42:08,839
it's dry but it's got to be kind of

660
00:42:07,579 --> 00:42:11,509
somewhere in between a little bit of

661
00:42:08,839 --> 00:42:13,489
moisture and then right after we

662
00:42:11,509 --> 00:42:16,039
cultivate we want the weeds that have

663
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:18,140
been cut up to just bake in the Sun so

664
00:42:16,039 --> 00:42:21,109
we don't want to irrigate for another

665
00:42:18,140 --> 00:42:23,390
day or two after we wheat okay then we

666
00:42:21,109 --> 00:42:24,679
can start to irrigate again you know

667
00:42:23,390 --> 00:42:26,390
where you're where you're in a climate

668
00:42:24,679 --> 00:42:28,789
where you're relying on rain you have to

669
00:42:26,390 --> 00:42:30,619
really like be on top of okay like

670
00:42:28,789 --> 00:42:32,689
today's the day we've got a weed today

671
00:42:30,619 --> 00:42:34,819
because the conditions are right

672
00:42:32,689 --> 00:42:36,300
so the weeding is most effective limit

673
00:42:34,819 --> 00:42:38,040
conditions are

674
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:41,490
the weeds are at the right height the

675
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:43,050
moisture levels right so to me being

676
00:42:41,490 --> 00:42:44,550
really successful about weeding is just

677
00:42:43,050 --> 00:42:46,710
keeping at it all season kind of

678
00:42:44,550 --> 00:42:48,630
starting early I start when the weeds

679
00:42:46,710 --> 00:42:49,920
are just like tiny tiny weeds and you

680
00:42:48,630 --> 00:42:51,690
can barely see them and we just start

681
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:53,190
and it's very quick like you just weed a

682
00:42:51,690 --> 00:42:57,390
whole pad in almost no time because

683
00:42:53,190 --> 00:43:00,570
there's not much but still it makes a

684
00:42:57,390 --> 00:43:03,630
difference so I just kind of try to

685
00:43:00,570 --> 00:43:04,830
start early and stay on top of it how

686
00:43:03,630 --> 00:43:07,860
often do you weave

687
00:43:04,830 --> 00:43:09,990
well you know it's it's kind of like a

688
00:43:07,860 --> 00:43:12,150
part of our season like early in the

689
00:43:09,990 --> 00:43:14,040
season we're doing green house work and

690
00:43:12,150 --> 00:43:16,620
field prep work then were to get into

691
00:43:14,040 --> 00:43:18,540
planting big time and usually by the

692
00:43:16,620 --> 00:43:20,070
middle of May we're almost done with our

693
00:43:18,540 --> 00:43:21,060
planting and we're really getting into

694
00:43:20,070 --> 00:43:22,380
weeding and then we have a period of

695
00:43:21,060 --> 00:43:25,230
about like a month and a half where

696
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:26,610
that's like all we do and I hire a crew

697
00:43:25,230 --> 00:43:28,140
I bring people in to help us with

698
00:43:26,610 --> 00:43:30,870
weeding because it's a big labor need

699
00:43:28,140 --> 00:43:33,150
but we suddenly have and then it kind of

700
00:43:30,870 --> 00:43:34,530
goes on you know it kind of trickles in

701
00:43:33,150 --> 00:43:37,590
and it gets really big and then it kind

702
00:43:34,530 --> 00:43:39,600
of goes on for almost the rest of the

703
00:43:37,590 --> 00:43:41,160
season it kind of slows down towards the

704
00:43:39,600 --> 00:43:43,320
end because we stop leading certain

705
00:43:41,160 --> 00:43:44,910
crops and other crops we have to weed

706
00:43:43,320 --> 00:44:06,270
again or maybe you know a second or

707
00:43:44,910 --> 00:44:10,670
third time okay what do we have here and

708
00:44:06,270 --> 00:44:10,670
they don't Trump on the crops too bad

709
00:44:20,330 --> 00:44:25,250
and how many turkeys do you have out

710
00:44:23,040 --> 00:44:25,250
here

711
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:41,870
are there any artichokes oh yeah here a

712
00:44:38,300 --> 00:44:48,500
couple on the plant you can see the

713
00:44:41,870 --> 00:44:51,290
ladybugs all over really cool you got

714
00:44:48,500 --> 00:44:54,590
the ladybugs that are eating the aphids

715
00:44:51,290 --> 00:44:56,120
and the other thing you get is so much

716
00:44:54,590 --> 00:44:59,270
right now that you get ants that farm

717
00:44:56,120 --> 00:45:01,040
the aphids the ants there's an ant they

718
00:44:59,270 --> 00:45:02,810
bring the aphid eggs up and they put

719
00:45:01,040 --> 00:45:05,180
them on the plant and then they come

720
00:45:02,810 --> 00:45:08,570
back and they harvest the little baby

721
00:45:05,180 --> 00:45:10,130
aphids to eat okay and then the the

722
00:45:08,570 --> 00:45:11,810
ladybugs kind of key in on it and

723
00:45:10,130 --> 00:45:14,690
there's a lot of wasps that come in too

724
00:45:11,810 --> 00:45:16,850
and I mean these plants right now I

725
00:45:14,690 --> 00:45:18,290
think it's just kind of cooled down so

726
00:45:16,850 --> 00:45:19,670
it's slowed down but in the middle of

727
00:45:18,290 --> 00:45:24,940
the summer I was just like crazy to

728
00:45:19,670 --> 00:45:28,250
barely walk in here insects everywhere

729
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:30,320
and so ladybugs are pretty much your

730
00:45:28,250 --> 00:45:34,030
primary beneficial around here it seems

731
00:45:30,320 --> 00:45:34,030
like they're a big beneficial for sure'

732
00:45:39,760 --> 00:45:44,180
to get really tough so what I'm trying

733
00:45:42,680 --> 00:45:46,220
to do here is Hill it up I'm trying to

734
00:45:44,180 --> 00:45:48,200
use the tracker to bury these things

735
00:45:46,220 --> 00:45:50,630
with dirt and then that'll sort of

736
00:45:48,200 --> 00:45:54,050
blanch them and make them turn white and

737
00:45:50,630 --> 00:45:57,070
tender hopefully nice I can almost smell

738
00:45:54,050 --> 00:45:57,070
the peanut butter and raisins

739
00:46:08,660 --> 00:46:24,750
that's good so this whole section here

740
00:46:22,460 --> 00:46:27,960
is all being irrigated with this drip

741
00:46:24,750 --> 00:46:31,560
tape and this is like the most efficient

742
00:46:27,960 --> 00:46:35,040
way to irrigate the waters just pushed

743
00:46:31,560 --> 00:46:37,440
down into the tube and there's little

744
00:46:35,040 --> 00:46:40,230
holes that are kind of pre-drilled into

745
00:46:37,440 --> 00:46:43,680
this seam it allows the water to dribble

746
00:46:40,230 --> 00:46:45,240
out and so for the whole run there's

747
00:46:43,680 --> 00:46:47,430
like a little bit of water dribbling out

748
00:46:45,240 --> 00:46:49,020
every 12 inches and the lines stay on

749
00:46:47,430 --> 00:46:53,730
for a long time like five or six hours

750
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:55,800
until it's saturated it's very efficient

751
00:46:53,730 --> 00:47:17,450
you're not watering you know in between

752
00:46:55,800 --> 00:47:37,200
the bed so they don't so anyway that's

753
00:47:17,450 --> 00:47:39,450
drip tape and so you've got some main

754
00:47:37,200 --> 00:47:41,040
pipes and then you keep branching down

755
00:47:39,450 --> 00:47:45,290
branching down and the drip tapes

756
00:47:41,040 --> 00:47:52,440
obviously at the end of the whole chain

757
00:47:45,290 --> 00:47:55,830
yeah we have a really big berry that

758
00:47:52,440 --> 00:48:01,020
comes up in Judy's risers

759
00:47:55,830 --> 00:48:09,210
every 40 feet and then on these risers I

760
00:48:01,020 --> 00:48:11,430
can either go with a sprinkler line PPC

761
00:48:09,210 --> 00:48:14,010
pipe and then go into the drip tapes

762
00:48:11,430 --> 00:48:35,280
okay so it goes to PVC up at the other

763
00:48:14,010 --> 00:48:37,770
end there okay do you have one of the

764
00:48:35,280 --> 00:48:47,450
drip tapes starting off from the PVC

765
00:48:37,770 --> 00:48:52,850
somewhere yeah okay it looks like well

766
00:48:47,450 --> 00:48:56,040
and all I really do is I wasn't working

767
00:48:52,850 --> 00:48:58,590
it's a very simple system I I drill a

768
00:48:56,040 --> 00:49:01,290
hole in the PVC it's slightly smaller

769
00:48:58,590 --> 00:49:08,340
than the outside diameter is - okay Mike

770
00:49:01,290 --> 00:49:14,070
ran the tube in there drip tape and Fram

771
00:49:08,340 --> 00:49:15,690
that you've been there and then you just

772
00:49:14,070 --> 00:49:17,640
pinch off both ends of the drip tape

773
00:49:15,690 --> 00:49:19,260
yeah I decided I'm not okay

774
00:49:17,640 --> 00:49:20,310
they do make special fittings for all

775
00:49:19,260 --> 00:49:21,840
this stuff you know they make a special

776
00:49:20,310 --> 00:49:28,110
fitting for this bar they make a special

777
00:49:21,840 --> 00:49:35,790
fitting for this kind of cheap way of

778
00:49:28,110 --> 00:49:38,970
doing it if it works that's what the

779
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:41,390
line first fill it up we go down make

780
00:49:38,970 --> 00:49:41,390
sure it's not

781
00:50:20,610 --> 00:50:27,220
and I know that most types of sweet corn

782
00:50:23,880 --> 00:50:30,190
for modern farming have been bred so

783
00:50:27,220 --> 00:50:33,130
that there's only one year per block of

784
00:50:30,190 --> 00:50:38,350
corn that's probably true is is that how

785
00:50:33,130 --> 00:50:41,369
this corn is or no no this okay and what

786
00:50:38,350 --> 00:50:41,369
variety of corn assist

787
00:50:52,830 --> 00:51:00,300
oh yeah sunflowers sunflowers are really

788
00:51:22,560 --> 00:51:38,350
trend pull it okay look what some of

789
00:51:35,710 --> 00:51:40,420
them are bigger it's the type do you

790
00:51:38,350 --> 00:51:43,210
have different varieties in here yeah a

791
00:51:40,420 --> 00:51:45,010
lot of different varieties so this man

792
00:51:43,210 --> 00:51:49,119
my little label say what the boys are

793
00:51:45,010 --> 00:51:52,920
Atlas Danvers and Nan tez those are the

794
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:52,920
three varieties in this bed okay

795
00:52:05,130 --> 00:52:17,950
the water there you go

796
00:52:14,979 --> 00:52:23,289
yeah yeah look at that that's a

797
00:52:17,950 --> 00:52:26,799
healthy-looking carrot mmm lots carrot

798
00:52:23,289 --> 00:52:29,950
still he picked some basil and scallions

799
00:52:26,799 --> 00:52:31,450
okay there's the rest of the beans those

800
00:52:29,950 --> 00:52:33,640
were highly productive and we had to

801
00:52:31,450 --> 00:52:38,229
just stop picking them cuz we just kind

802
00:52:33,640 --> 00:52:39,609
of ran out of labor so these are onions

803
00:52:38,229 --> 00:52:45,099
you were showing us one of the onions

804
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:46,809
you this picture from I plant them from

805
00:52:45,099 --> 00:52:49,809
little onion transplant so someone else

806
00:52:46,809 --> 00:52:52,359
grows them from seed they probably start

807
00:52:49,809 --> 00:52:53,739
them in the fall they overwinter them

808
00:52:52,359 --> 00:52:55,719
and then I when I buy them in the spring

809
00:52:53,739 --> 00:53:00,009
for transplanting they're just tiny

810
00:52:55,719 --> 00:53:03,609
little onion shoes this this was like mm

811
00:53:00,009 --> 00:53:06,039
okay and what is this maybe an eighth of

812
00:53:03,609 --> 00:53:10,390
an acre or something no not even now it

813
00:53:06,039 --> 00:53:17,489
would be well about about 24 beds per

814
00:53:10,390 --> 00:53:17,489
acre and it was just okay

815
00:53:21,390 --> 00:53:25,260
here we've got a bunch of lettuce

816
00:53:25,470 --> 00:53:40,180
is there anything tricky about the

817
00:53:27,610 --> 00:53:42,400
lettuce tender I plant it over and over

818
00:53:40,180 --> 00:53:45,520
and over again okay that's the big

819
00:53:42,400 --> 00:53:48,990
secret it's just always having a fresh

820
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:51,550
crop so I have a lot of land here so I

821
00:53:48,990 --> 00:53:53,440
fill up a new section and plant a new

822
00:53:51,550 --> 00:54:05,850
section of salad about every week in

823
00:53:53,440 --> 00:54:08,590
December okay maybe two weeks go by okay

824
00:54:05,850 --> 00:54:40,590
and so your greenhouse is mainly for

825
00:54:08,590 --> 00:54:47,770
starting stuff melons

826
00:54:40,590 --> 00:54:51,030
do not really ripen up very well okay at

827
00:54:47,770 --> 00:54:54,310
the end and open on the sides it will

828
00:54:51,030 --> 00:54:57,330
retain a huge amount plus of course it's

829
00:54:54,310 --> 00:54:57,330
much hotter in there during the day

830
00:55:07,160 --> 00:55:09,220
you

831
00:55:14,180 --> 00:55:16,240
you

832
00:55:16,760 --> 00:55:46,820
okay so you basically just have two

833
00:55:19,110 --> 00:55:49,400
tractors and these are set up to weed

834
00:55:46,820 --> 00:55:54,180
the three rows that we throw in our beds

835
00:55:49,400 --> 00:55:56,250
so these blades work the soil the the

836
00:55:54,180 --> 00:55:58,530
wheel and this back are kind of rolling

837
00:55:56,250 --> 00:56:00,780
along floating along okay these brackets

838
00:55:58,530 --> 00:56:04,200
allow the plates to go to move up and

839
00:56:00,780 --> 00:56:06,060
down I see and then this is this is

840
00:56:04,200 --> 00:56:07,200
cutting into the soil so the idea is

841
00:56:06,060 --> 00:56:09,270
this is just below the surface of the

842
00:56:07,200 --> 00:56:11,490
soil this area here is being left

843
00:56:09,270 --> 00:56:13,590
untouched in between those two blades

844
00:56:11,490 --> 00:56:15,870
but but this is being cultivated this is

845
00:56:13,590 --> 00:56:18,480
being cultivated and so there's three

846
00:56:15,870 --> 00:56:20,280
lines that are left three parallel lines

847
00:56:18,480 --> 00:56:26,610
and those are the where the crops are

848
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:28,890
this marker so when we're when we're

849
00:56:26,610 --> 00:56:30,090
planting I will mark the fields with

850
00:56:28,890 --> 00:56:32,090
these and that will give us three

851
00:56:30,090 --> 00:56:33,930
furrows and then we'll drop our

852
00:56:32,090 --> 00:56:35,490
transplants that we've grown like our

853
00:56:33,930 --> 00:56:37,560
broccoli transplants or our lettuce

854
00:56:35,490 --> 00:56:39,570
transplants into those three furrows

855
00:56:37,560 --> 00:56:42,600
okay then we can come back with front

856
00:56:39,570 --> 00:56:44,670
part and weed it without hitting you

857
00:56:42,600 --> 00:56:45,780
know if you if you're not hitting one

858
00:56:44,670 --> 00:56:50,550
row you're not hitting the other two

859
00:56:45,780 --> 00:56:52,470
rows right because they're parallel and

860
00:56:50,550 --> 00:56:53,790
then also with the big tractor the other

861
00:56:52,470 --> 00:56:55,170
thing that I do that we didn't talk

862
00:56:53,790 --> 00:56:57,510
about is I do some direct seeding of

863
00:56:55,170 --> 00:56:59,970
that so I've got three Cedars that I put

864
00:56:57,510 --> 00:57:02,040
on the on the bar on the bat and I can

865
00:56:59,970 --> 00:57:05,680
fill those up with carrot seeds like I

866
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:07,089
was there are corn or beets or

867
00:57:05,680 --> 00:57:09,339
there's a whole bunch of different crops

868
00:57:07,089 --> 00:57:11,140
that I direct so these beans all those

869
00:57:09,339 --> 00:57:12,760
things I'll dump those seats in the

870
00:57:11,140 --> 00:57:13,960
cedar and then drive down and then

871
00:57:12,760 --> 00:57:16,510
that's putting the seed right below the

872
00:57:13,960 --> 00:57:18,970
surface of the soil again the spacing on

873
00:57:16,510 --> 00:57:21,609
those three rows would match the spacing

874
00:57:18,970 --> 00:57:23,920
of these and this may see my cultivators

875
00:57:21,609 --> 00:57:27,970
okay I'm able to go back and do the

876
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:29,440
cultivating Louis we still cultivate

877
00:57:27,970 --> 00:57:31,569
everything by hand but this allows us to

878
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:32,319
come through very quickly I can you know

879
00:57:31,569 --> 00:57:36,279
in a couple hours

880
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:37,720
go cultivate a whole acre and you know

881
00:57:36,279 --> 00:57:39,970
it's not a hundred percent thorough but

882
00:57:37,720 --> 00:57:41,710
it's a eighty ninety percent kind of

883
00:57:39,970 --> 00:57:43,510
thing and then come back by hand to

884
00:57:41,710 --> 00:57:47,260
finish this job off well it seems like a

885
00:57:43,510 --> 00:57:53,710
neat little tractor let's go see your

886
00:57:47,260 --> 00:57:55,329
double digger okay series of eight lays

887
00:57:53,710 --> 00:58:00,160
mine does it come in different widths

888
00:57:55,329 --> 00:58:01,900
and what happens is the blades make a

889
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:04,779
motion kind of like this they shop

890
00:58:01,900 --> 00:58:07,119
straight down and then they they kind of

891
00:58:04,779 --> 00:58:09,369
loop back they're making a circular

892
00:58:07,119 --> 00:58:12,339
motion and what happens is they're

893
00:58:09,369 --> 00:58:13,809
they're chopping up the soil as you move

894
00:58:12,339 --> 00:58:16,240
forward very very slowly with the

895
00:58:13,809 --> 00:58:18,160
tractor they're slicing off like maybe a

896
00:58:16,240 --> 00:58:20,650
half inch or an inch of a trench that

897
00:58:18,160 --> 00:58:22,450
you're working and they go down for ten

898
00:58:20,650 --> 00:58:24,819
or twelve inches maybe even more and

899
00:58:22,450 --> 00:58:27,819
then as they make their backward motion

900
00:58:24,819 --> 00:58:30,460
they catch the top half of that tilling

901
00:58:27,819 --> 00:58:34,440
depth maybe five or six inches and they

902
00:58:30,460 --> 00:58:34,440
they fling it backwards

903
00:58:39,539 --> 00:58:47,890
pulverized and just like you get with a

904
00:58:45,130 --> 00:58:53,710
rototiller now if it's too dry it'll be

905
00:58:47,890 --> 00:58:55,059
you know it won't rise once your content

906
00:58:53,710 --> 00:58:58,059
really is very critical on this

907
00:58:55,059 --> 00:59:00,400
implement okay but if the conditions are

908
00:58:58,059 --> 00:59:02,410
right what you wind up with is you know

909
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:05,470
you wind up with soil but you can stick

910
00:59:02,410 --> 00:59:09,490
your arm down to your elbow it's loose

911
00:59:05,470 --> 00:59:11,710
down that far the bottom half of that

912
00:59:09,490 --> 00:59:14,380
tilling death has been loosened the top

913
00:59:11,710 --> 00:59:17,200
half has been actually blended they

914
00:59:14,380 --> 00:59:19,200
don't get mixed together okay whereas a

915
00:59:17,200 --> 00:59:21,510
roto tiller would just mix them

916
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:22,710
part of what you're doing with the whole

917
00:59:21,510 --> 00:59:24,060
thing I was talking about like the life

918
00:59:22,710 --> 00:59:25,950
of the soil and trying to keep your

919
00:59:24,060 --> 00:59:27,960
soils healthy you know most of the life

920
00:59:25,950 --> 00:59:29,490
of your soil is just in those top couple

921
00:59:27,960 --> 00:59:31,290
of inches that's where all the

922
00:59:29,490 --> 00:59:33,810
biological activity where the oxygen is

923
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:36,900
permeating the worms are doing their

924
00:59:33,810 --> 00:59:38,910
cycling up and down so when you when you

925
00:59:36,900 --> 00:59:40,349
wrote a tilling or tilling down 8 or 10

926
00:59:38,910 --> 00:59:42,630
inches and you're sort of blending it

927
00:59:40,349 --> 00:59:44,070
all up it's not that you're killing it

928
00:59:42,630 --> 00:59:46,410
but you're losing sort of your

929
00:59:44,070 --> 00:59:50,180
concentration of your life you know so

930
00:59:46,410 --> 00:59:50,180
if you can try to avoid that it's better

931
00:59:56,990 --> 01:00:00,100
[Music]

932
01:00:51,500 --> 01:00:55,970
sometimes the old technology works

933
01:00:53,670 --> 01:00:55,970
better

934
01:00:59,950 --> 01:01:06,200
and then to something I guess okay on

935
01:01:03,800 --> 01:01:12,260
the bottom of the bed there that all

936
01:01:06,200 --> 01:01:14,260
moves and as the chain runs there's like

937
01:01:12,260 --> 01:01:17,270
a beater arm somewhere that pushes yeah

938
01:01:14,260 --> 01:01:19,880
pushes this big wheel around okay just

939
01:01:17,270 --> 01:01:21,800
like one notch at a time and that turns

940
01:01:19,880 --> 01:01:29,570
the chain that is this all driven from

941
01:01:21,800 --> 01:01:32,990
the tires from the tires and you have

942
01:01:29,570 --> 01:01:41,450
control over various aspects of it with

943
01:01:32,990 --> 01:01:42,770
these levers okay but supposedly one of

944
01:01:41,450 --> 01:01:46,359
them what control like how much was

945
01:01:42,770 --> 01:01:47,660
letting out and control how fast it was

946
01:01:46,359 --> 01:01:57,290
moving

947
01:01:47,660 --> 01:02:00,070
I see neat piece of equipment how old

948
01:01:57,290 --> 01:02:00,070
would you guess that is

949
01:02:07,780 --> 01:02:11,410
[Laughter]

950
01:02:24,620 --> 01:02:28,490
