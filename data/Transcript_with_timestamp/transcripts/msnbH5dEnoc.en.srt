Garlic is widely cultivated in

California, especially in the Gilroy

the world with its dry climate, fertile

00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:15,120
soil, and advanced farming practices,

6
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:17,920
California has become the largest garlic

00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:19,920
producing state in the US. Garlic is not

8
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,160
only an essential culinary ingredient,

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,240
but also a high-v value agricultural

10
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,320
product, contributing hundreds of

11
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:27,760
millions of dollars to the US economy

12
00:00:26,320 --> 00:00:30,560
each year through both domestic

13
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:33,120
consumption and export. Despite advances

14
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:35,280
in agricultural technology, garlic

15
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,920
harvesting is still primarily done by

16
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:40,559
hand. Immigrant laborers with swift and

17
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:43,280
resilient hands bend under the scorching

18

19

skilled workers are an indispensable

21
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,480
part of the agricultural supply chain,

00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,160
playing a vital role in maintaining the

00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:24,080

has significantly improved efficiency

00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:33,600
and reduced manual labor. Across the

vast fields of California, specialized

30
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,520
garlic planters are used to evenly

31
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,640
distribute garlic cloves into

32
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,640
wellprepared soil beds. These machines

33
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:45,119
precisely control the spacing and depth

34
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:48,119
of each clove, ensuring optimal

35
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,799
conditions for growth. Thanks to this

technology, multiple hectares of garlic

37
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,960
can be planted within just a few hours,

most small and medium farms still rely

primarily immigrants from countries like

Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, and

hardship, crossing borders in search of

69
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:43,440

documentation or work temporarily under
