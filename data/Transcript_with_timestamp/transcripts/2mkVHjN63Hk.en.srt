1
00:00:00,420 --> 00:00:06,180
these skies are finally blue in my UK

2
00:00:03,780 --> 00:00:08,160
tropical style garden and the daytime

3
00:00:06,180 --> 00:00:10,920
and even nighttime temperatures are

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:13,320
staying nice and warm

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,120
all of those hearty resilient plants

6
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:17,699
that Shrugged off the harsh weather

7
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,279
conditions of winter are thriving in

8
00:00:17,699 --> 00:00:23,580
these conditions my euphorbia cross

9
00:00:20,279 --> 00:00:26,519
pasteri is in full bloom and the Ants

10
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:29,939
are absolutely loving its sweet nectar

11
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,700
my papaya is in full flour and the Hardy

12
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:37,559
bananas are reaching for the skies

13
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:40,079
however there is a problem in Paradise I

14
00:00:37,559 --> 00:00:45,180
encounter this stress-inducing problem

15
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:47,940
at the same time every single year my

16
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:50,760
garden is surrounded by boundary walls

17
00:00:47,940 --> 00:00:53,160
and Boundary fences limiting the amount

18
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:55,260
of space that I've got available to grow

19
00:00:53,160 --> 00:00:57,660
plants in and I'm sure this isn't

20
00:00:55,260 --> 00:01:00,120
something that I suffer alone

21
00:00:57,660 --> 00:01:02,579
so many of us are restricted in our

22
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:04,739
growing space and as spring turns into

23
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:08,960
summer we can really feel those

24
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,960
limitations with everything growing away

25
00:01:14,299 --> 00:01:19,500
so how do I overcome these space

26
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:22,140
limitations when growing a tropical

27
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,180
style Garden here in the UK now small

28
00:01:22,140 --> 00:01:26,939
gardens don't mean you have to limit

29
00:01:24,180 --> 00:01:29,280
yourself as much as you might think over

30
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:31,380
the years I found a number of ways to

31
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,900
increase the amount of plants that I can

32
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:36,900
grow in a limited space and I'm going to

33
00:01:33,900 --> 00:01:39,180
share some of those tricks with you now

34
00:01:36,900 --> 00:01:42,320
so for the first trick we're going to

35
00:01:39,180 --> 00:01:45,540
turn to rain forests for inspiration

36
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,460
rainforests grow in layers and by

37
00:01:45,540 --> 00:01:49,079
planting our garden in layers we're

38
00:01:47,460 --> 00:01:50,840
going to be able to utilize everything

39
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,399
that we can learn from a rainforest

40
00:01:50,840 --> 00:01:55,560
plants don't all grow at the same height

41
00:01:53,399 --> 00:01:58,380
in the same conditions they've evolved

42
00:01:55,560 --> 00:02:00,600
to thrive in different niches and by

43
00:01:58,380 --> 00:02:02,640
understanding that we can really

44
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,340
maximize the space that we've got to

45
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,220
grow plants in our Gardens

46
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:11,280
so let's break these layers down we're

47
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:15,780
going to look at ground cover plants sub

48
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:17,520
shrubs shrubs and then trees just like

49
00:02:15,780 --> 00:02:18,599
you'd get in a rainforest

50
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,959
so

51
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:24,300
ground cover plants plants like Hardy

52
00:02:21,959 --> 00:02:26,640
and patience or this Saxy Fraga

53
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,540
stolonifera which has proven Hardy in my

54
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,780
UK Garden a sarum europeais and so many

55
00:02:30,540 --> 00:02:35,459
more provide good ground cover for what

56
00:02:33,780 --> 00:02:38,280
you might think a difficult growing

57
00:02:35,459 --> 00:02:40,500
conditions they stay small and compact

58
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:42,900
so you can squeeze them underneath

59
00:02:40,500 --> 00:02:45,120
larger plants

60
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:48,000
then we're going to move up a layer to

61
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:49,680
sub shrub plants now in this group I

62
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,720
would put things like Ferns and

63
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:53,580
herbaceous perennials anything that's

64
00:02:51,720 --> 00:02:55,800
going to grow and fill that void between

65
00:02:53,580 --> 00:02:58,500
the ground cover plants and the bottom

66
00:02:55,800 --> 00:03:00,780
of your larger shrubs so in this group

67
00:02:58,500 --> 00:03:02,900
in a tropical style Garden I would

68
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:06,300
include things like persicaria

69
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:09,239
collocages and ferns

70
00:03:06,300 --> 00:03:11,879
many of these sub shrub plants have

71
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,519
adapted to tolerate partial shade so

72
00:03:11,879 --> 00:03:16,680
plants like colic ages and ferns will

73
00:03:14,519 --> 00:03:19,560
thrive in these conditions and you will

74
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:22,260
have a healthy second layer

75
00:03:19,560 --> 00:03:24,480
let's move up another layer to find more

76
00:03:22,260 --> 00:03:26,879
planting opportunities we're going to

77
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:29,760
look at shrubs now shrubs are usually

78
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:31,860
Woody plants that are multi-branched in

79
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:34,980
a tropical style Garden we're looking at

80
00:03:31,860 --> 00:03:37,260
things like fatiers and sambucus

81
00:03:34,980 --> 00:03:39,420
there is so many plants that you can

82
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:42,360
choose from but these plants will fill

83
00:03:39,420 --> 00:03:47,280
the gap between your herbaceous exotic

84
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:50,459
perennials and the canopy of the trees

85
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:54,180
and that brings us to our next layer the

86
00:03:50,459 --> 00:03:56,099
canopy of trees now trees will climb for

87
00:03:54,180 --> 00:03:59,519
the skies and you can find trees to suit

88
00:03:56,099 --> 00:04:01,980
Gardens of all sizes many trees tolerate

89
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:03,659
pruning really well so if you stay on

90
00:04:01,980 --> 00:04:05,879
top of your job list you can keep those

91
00:04:03,659 --> 00:04:09,959
trees the perfect size for your garden

92
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,720
no matter what size it is in my garden I

93
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,959
grow the loquat tree I've got a mountain

94
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:18,900
papaya and this beautiful Golden Leaves

95
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:21,720
Catalpa big non Theodis the common name

96
00:04:18,900 --> 00:04:24,900
is the golden Indian bean tree and I

97
00:04:21,720 --> 00:04:27,419
speak so much about this Roost tree that

98
00:04:24,900 --> 00:04:30,479
forms the central canopy they are really

99
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:32,520
easy to grow and really tough just watch

100
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:36,360
out for root suckers this one is

101
00:04:32,520 --> 00:04:38,639
actually restricted by an old pond liner

102
00:04:36,360 --> 00:04:41,100
see how many planting opportunities

103
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,320
we've got just by breaking down the

104
00:04:41,100 --> 00:04:47,100
available space into a number of layers

105
00:04:43,320 --> 00:04:50,460
we have ground cover plants sub shrubs

106
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:53,340
shrubs and trees and there are thousands

107
00:04:50,460 --> 00:04:55,440
of plants to choose from no matter what

108
00:04:53,340 --> 00:04:57,419
style of garden you're growing I

109
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:00,300
personally love tropical Style Plants as

110
00:04:57,419 --> 00:05:02,040
you can see my next trick to maximize

111
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:05,160
the amount of plants you can grow in a

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,139
limited space is to use something that

113
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:09,380
can break free from the restrictions of

114
00:05:07,139 --> 00:05:12,419
layers we're going to plant climbers

115
00:05:09,380 --> 00:05:14,940
climbers will grow up through the layers

116
00:05:12,419 --> 00:05:17,400
and you don't need a wide open space

117
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:20,040
because they will go vertical up

118
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:24,199
whatever support you give them so things

119
00:05:20,040 --> 00:05:26,880
like clematis or Jasmine make fantastic

120
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:28,919
climbing plants and Jasmine will

121
00:05:26,880 --> 00:05:31,800
fragrance your garden when it's in full

122
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:33,360
bloom ours smells fantastic in the

123
00:05:31,800 --> 00:05:36,720
height of Summer

124
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:38,580
and again there are a wide array of

125
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
Evergreen climbers that you can use so

126
00:05:38,580 --> 00:05:42,660
that when the rest of the garden might

127
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,539
look a bit tired in Winter you've still

128
00:05:42,660 --> 00:05:48,720
got some fantastic foliage to look at

129
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:50,820
and my final trick especially for a

130
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,419
tropical style Garden is to use

131
00:05:50,820 --> 00:05:57,720
epiphytes epiphytes are plants that grow

132
00:05:54,419 --> 00:06:00,600
on larger living plant hosts so things

133
00:05:57,720 --> 00:06:03,120
like my tropical bromeliads these plants

134
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:05,100
are adapted to survive without soil

135
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:07,620
around the roots they actually use the

136
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:09,539
roots to attach onto bigger plants now

137
00:06:07,620 --> 00:06:11,759
there are some that are borderline Hardy

138
00:06:09,539 --> 00:06:14,580
in the UK but I use a lot of these as

139
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:17,039
summer displays and it just adds so much

140
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,660
height in limited space I'm so pleased

141
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,759
that I've used them in this narrow

142
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,160
border that flanks the side of the

143
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,800
Garden Path by utilizing available

144
00:06:23,160 --> 00:06:29,160
vertical space it's really helped give

145
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:32,220
that Lush jungly feel

146
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,800
I hope this selection of tips that I use

147
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:37,080
to maximize the growing space in my own

148
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:38,880
small tropical style Garden has helped

149
00:06:37,080 --> 00:06:40,919
inspire you whether you're growing in a

150
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:44,520
garden or in a balcony or in a courtyard

151
00:06:40,919 --> 00:06:46,500
this will even apply to house plants not

152
00:06:44,520 --> 00:06:49,199
all plants need to be grown in their own

153
00:06:46,500 --> 00:06:51,300
individual pots you can combine them to

154
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,560
create your own miniature indoor

155
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:54,720
rainforest
