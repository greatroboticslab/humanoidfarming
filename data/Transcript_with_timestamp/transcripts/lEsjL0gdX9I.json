  "text": "[Music] I was in Bihar East India last week I was talking to some of the women farmers Erie has been working with and they told me there were two things that transform their life significantly in the in the recent years first was their recognition as farmers in their own right record getting that identity that might seem trivial to a lot of us I think we take it for granted but these women have been toiling on their rice fields for years and generations and have never been recognized as farmers they were just unpaid family labor and as a result they had no access to inputs no access to technologies no access to credit Norland and they remained in that purchase cycle of low productivity and poverty and incomes and when they started working with Erie engaging in the participatory technology development and evaluation programs they got access to technologies like let's say machine transplanting of rice direct trading of rice using good agronomic practices you know managing good nurseries for healthy seedlings and so on and so on and as a result they gained a lot of confidence and started using these practices and now they're recognized as knowledgeable and progressive farmers in their own right by their households by their communities they saved a lot of time and energy and they're able to use that time now to take care of their children's education look after the household better would also take care of themselves and their being and they said that has made a significant difference in their lives improved productivity gave them more income and some women saw the economic opportunity as they started using those Transplant airs so in their collective in their self-help group they came together and then started they bought a machine transplanter and started a custom hiring center so when they are providing machine transplanting services to other farmers within their village but also outside and earning some income at the same time they are also filling a gap that exists in service provision and as a result these women are now also being recognized as budding business woman and they've gained a lot of credibility and respect in their communities I mean I was talking to some of the men in those villages and they were so proud of their wives their daughters and daughters-in-law who were doing this to put it in context Bihar is a very patriarchal society has been just for these women to break those social norms and take on roles that were traditionally done by men I mean driving a machine in the rice field not heard of before wasn't easy they faced a lot of sneers and jeers when they started well they were met people who asked who do you think you are men what are you even trying to do but then they persevere they persisted and and they managed to do that mainly because they stayed and worked as a collective being in that group give them that power as a result some a lot of these women now have access to inputs have access to technologies you know they can rent land a lot of them have bank accounts they can get loans and they are able to make decisions on what to produce what to sell way to sell and how to use the income they earned and that is an example of how targeting technology is right and using the right process to get them to Berman can make a significant difference in power relations within the households within the communities and within the society [Music]",
