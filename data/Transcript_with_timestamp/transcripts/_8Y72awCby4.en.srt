1
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,320
we are

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,200
marilyn jo hannah from rose common berry

3
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:16,800
farm

4
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:19,840
we are located in brutal dallas county

5
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:23,039
outside of linden iowa we

6
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:23,760
grow strawberries and raspberries

7
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:26,800
currently

8
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,880
and are looking at expanding into other

9
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:31,439
berries for future years

10
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:32,640
we grow our strawberries in a somewhat

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:34,399
unique

12
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,559
situation they're day neutral

13
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:37,440
strawberries so we treat them as an

14
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,600
annual and

15
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:43,840
plant new ones every spring for harvest

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:46,079
somewhere between first harvest starts

17
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,480
from july 1st to july

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,480
20th depending on the year a little bit

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:53,440
but what really makes our

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,000
strawberry system unique is that we grow

21
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:57,680
them in

22
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,239
vertical upright hydroponic tower so

23
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:00,800
there's

24
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,719
no bending over and picking off the

25
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,879
ground everything is done from

26
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,320
knee high to head height this is our

27
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:08,000
second year of

28
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,520
production on the farm last year was

29
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,040
just kind of getting things

30
00:01:09,520 --> 00:01:12,560
up and going and getting a lot of

31
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:15,200
infrastructure

32
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,000
built we had some definitely major

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:18,240
challenges

34
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:19,920
last year which the sierra grant is

35
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:23,280
actually helping us figure out

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,240
this year we have about nine acres

37
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,000
across the whole

38
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:29,280
farm that we own and right now we just

39
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:31,840
have crops in

40
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,720
basically about three quarters to one

41
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:35,280
acre

42
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:36,240
the strawberries that we have we had

43
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:38,880
about 17

44
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:40,000
000 out there when we started this

45
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,600
spring again but that's

46
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:46,079
all in you know a half acre size

47
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,159
we have three weeks of rain literally

48
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:51,119
every single day so you'll find a few

49
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:52,799
empty potholes and things out there but

50
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,759
that's a really good

51
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:57,360
comparison of what works well under

52
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:58,399
flooding and drought conditions because

53
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,560
we've had

54
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:01,759
flood condition well not flood last year

55
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:03,200
but we had

56
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,560
a lot of rain last year during the

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,560
growing season we had constant

58
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,479
preliminary trials set up

59
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,640
we've had basically now at this point

60
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:11,440
three weeks up until today when we

61
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,560
record it

62
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:15,280
of bone dry weather um and so i think

63
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:16,319
we're growing

64
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:19,200
we're going to learn a lot of good

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:20,959
information from the trial this year

66
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
and we already have we've started

67
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:25,440
collecting some of our data

68
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,319
and can easily see a difference between

69
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:28,800
certain

70
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:29,520
of our trials of our different media as

71
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:32,160
far as

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:33,040
different take rates so we're seeing

73
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,920
some

74
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,959
plant size plant health and labor that's

75
00:02:35,920 --> 00:02:38,480
involved

76
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:39,760
how can we mechanize some of this and

77
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:41,200
we'll talk about all that as we go

78
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,200
through the individual

79
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:46,800
pots we have 15 rows of our towers out

80
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,239
here

81
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,879
we have 10 rows that are 60 towers each

82
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:54,080
roughly give or take and then five that

83
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:57,360
are 40

84
00:02:54,080 --> 00:03:00,800
in our smaller field and in each of the

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:04,080
towers so each of the 60 or 40 there are

86
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:07,120
five of these cloverleaf

87
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:10,159
pots that just stack snap

88
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:13,519
together and so each pot

89
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,720
holds four plants so then for each tower

90
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:16,959
it's 20

91
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,400
obviously multiplied out for the field

92
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:21,040
itself

93
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,400
in our trial we have four different

94
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
media types

95
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,080
that are in the middle of our field our

96
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,760
big field

97
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:33,200
so we can see side-by-side comparisons

98
00:03:29,760 --> 00:03:33,760
of what they look like compared to each

99
00:03:33,200 --> 00:03:36,480
other

100
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,920
the field that you see behind us it's

101
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,720
basically we had to put together a

102
00:03:37,920 --> 00:03:42,080
trellis

103
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:44,640
to hold the pots up they're all um it's

104
00:03:42,080 --> 00:03:45,599
half inch conduit with uh inch and a

105
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,640
half

106
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:49,120
inch and a quarter or something like

107
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,280
that pvc that holds the tower

108
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:52,480
or the pots up off the ground at knee

109
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:54,959
height there

110
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,840
um because we're on a windy location we

111
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:57,760
had to go through

112
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,760
and add some end posts and some ground

113
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:01,120
stakes and a couple eight foot t-post

114
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:02,799
staggered throughout

115
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,799
with a high tensile wire there's not

116
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,560
really any tension on that wire but just

117
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:07,519
something to hold those conduit from

118
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,640
moving

119
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:13,920
around you'll notice that our rows are

120
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:15,519
north and south here it the property

121
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,120
actually doesn't quite

122
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,560
look like it is north and south the way

123
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,560
we're sitting here but it actually is

124
00:04:18,560 --> 00:04:22,160
sitting fairly close to north-south

125
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:23,600
and the reason that they're set there

126
00:04:22,160 --> 00:04:24,880
are set up like that way is so that the

127
00:04:23,600 --> 00:04:28,080
morning sun can come

128
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:30,400
up and trans and move over and actually

129
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,040
catch

130
00:04:30,400 --> 00:04:34,560
basically three sides of the towers over

131
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:37,199
the course of the day in order

132
00:04:34,560 --> 00:04:38,639
to get uniform growth in uniform

133
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:40,479
ripening

134
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,680
it is a management type thing that we

135
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:42,160
have to do though is go through and

136
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,000
rotate

137
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:48,400
those pots uh 180 degrees once a day

138
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:49,600
we do that for sunlight we do that to

139
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,560
give the plants a little bit of a break

140
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:53,600
from the wind

141
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,639
and irrigation and irrigation water flow

142
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,199
distribution

143
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:58,080
through the towers this is our first

144
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,360
trial

145
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:04,000
um this is a mix of the

146
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:05,440
chips that we saw hydrating before that

147
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,919
was in the bag

148
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:08,960
not ground up though it's just the chips

149
00:05:07,919 --> 00:05:11,919
and then it's a mix

150
00:05:08,960 --> 00:05:12,960
of the peat material that we saw

151
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:16,000
hydrated

152
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:16,560
and it's mixed at one part p three parts

153
00:05:16,000 --> 00:05:20,240
chips

154
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:20,800
i believe um so the peat holds the water

155
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,680
the cheap

156
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,160
chips give us drainage the chips

157
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
actually

158
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,479
ebb and flow a little bit of nutrients i

159
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,720
think as well i can't

160
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,280
100 verify that so pros to this media is

161
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:36,800
it's

162
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
fairly well drained and you can easily

163
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,840
change drainage by adding

164
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
more peat to that mix to suit your needs

165
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,840
right now we're finding about similar

166
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:46,560
water usage across the board from all

167
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:48,880
our media

168
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:50,880
out here i don't know that that will

169
00:05:48,880 --> 00:05:53,039
hold through as plants start to

170
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:54,800
size up though the next treatment here

171
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,680
is the peat that we

172
00:05:54,800 --> 00:05:59,039
had so the ground up peat mixed up with

173
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,120
the chips that we have

174
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:02,479
but the chips are also ran through the

175
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:06,080
chipper shredder

176
00:06:02,479 --> 00:06:10,319
thing um i think we're at one part pete

177
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:13,199
and three parts of uh ground up chips

178
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:14,080
out here the chips themselves are pretty

179
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:16,880
well

180
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,319
drained and get pretty dry and there

181
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:21,600
that one is a great option

182
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:22,479
for wet years so we wanted to see if we

183
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:25,520
could find

184
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:27,039
that same material and make it to be a

185
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,240
little bit more suitable for

186
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:31,039
a wet year yeah you end up with a ton of

187
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,160
labor

188
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,759
i mean because you're already running

189
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:34,080
stuff for the chipper then you gotta

190
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,360
back

191
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:38,720
mix it with the peat and it doesn't

192
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:40,960
store well so it's not something we can

193
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:44,240
do during the off season

194
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:46,400
i've got iron chlorosis on

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
some of these some of these leaves so i

196
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:49,199
still need to fold fully refeed it and

197
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,319
things like that and account for some of

198
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,000
the

199
00:06:50,319 --> 00:06:55,199
excess of bleaching that the other media

200
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,880
has so i'm not gaining anything

201
00:06:55,199 --> 00:06:58,319
by adding the extra labor to this media

202
00:06:56,880 --> 00:06:59,520
so this one will never be seen on this

203
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,120
farm again

204
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,800
another media that's in this trial this

205
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:05,199
one is the

206
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:07,120
chips that we had and then ran through

207
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:10,080
the chipper shredder mulcher

208
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,599
thing and it's just a nice fine grain

209
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:14,000
material that we saw

210
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:15,680
earlier the reason that we like this one

211
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:18,880
is it's very well drained

212
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:20,400
so we get into a wet year water moves

213
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:21,360
down through here and these strawberries

214
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:22,960
are never wet

215
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,720
in fact we got a half inch of rain this

216
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:26,319
morning we may

217
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:28,800
if it gets sunny and warm out we may

218
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:30,639
have to irrigate this afternoon

219
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:32,880
and i should mention all of these are on

220
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,919
a twice a day irrigation cycle that's

221
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,800
the way we're set up

222
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:38,080
the challenges on it though is the

223
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:40,240
nutrients run out

224
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,759
and then you end up with iron deficiency

225
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:45,039
so you can see i've got

226
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:46,639
some iron deficiency here so it becomes

227
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,199
really critical to make sure that you're

228
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:51,120
managing putting just enough water on to

229
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,960
get everything hydrated but not too much

230
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,400
and leaching excess out

231
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:56,400
and then coming back in you're going to

232
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:59,759
have to do some foliar feeding after

233
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:00,960
rain falls labor-wise the stuff is

234
00:07:59,759 --> 00:08:04,560
really easy to

235
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:06,720
hydrate it's really easy to tip

236
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:08,560
other than it takes time right time is

237
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:13,199
the worst part of the labor with this

238
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:15,520
it's planting into it is really easy

239
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:17,520
it really doesn't take much time at all

240
00:08:15,520 --> 00:08:20,800
it's so fine that you can just

241
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:22,720
pop plant right in really it's

242
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,720
the time that it takes to hydrate and

243
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:27,280
run everything through the

244
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,960
wood chipper finally we have our peat

245
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,479
and perlite mix this is again more

246
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:32,399
closer to what's generally used for

247
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,440
hydroponic strawberries and flat

248
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,800
culture beds

249
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:40,240
this is nice because you can pre-mix it

250
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:41,200
and put it all together and run it

251
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:43,599
through an auger

252
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,959
or a pot filler i mean this is designed

253
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,240
to go through a pot filler

254
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:49,600
it's also the cheapest overall of all

255
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:51,680
the different types of media

256
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:53,120
and the lowest labor of all the

257
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,360
different types of media

258
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:57,279
going to a what i think is a little bit

259
00:08:55,360 --> 00:09:00,560
higher quality

260
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:03,519
p media going to a higher ratio

261
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,470
of perlite in there and perlite is going

262
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:06,399
to

263
00:09:04,470 --> 00:09:08,000
[Music]

264
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,760
detract water so it's going to shed

265
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:11,279
water away from the plants

266
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:13,600
it's actually working out pretty well

267
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:17,760
for us the challenge on it

268
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,560
is it dries out and so when it dries out

269
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:21,279
it blows

270
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:22,880
and so we have peat and perlite that's

271
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:24,240
flown all over the place out of here

272
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:28,399
it's hard to keep it

273
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:29,839
wet on a windy windy day inside a

274
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:31,600
greenhouse or a high tunnel where we

275
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:32,560
could provide wind protection this would

276
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,240
be great

277
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:35,680
because it would never blow around it'd

278
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:37,760
be pretty easy to

279
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,360
manage and keep in place water flow and

280
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:42,560
distribution across these

281
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:44,120
it's a pots throughout the tower by far

282
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,519
this is the best

283
00:09:44,120 --> 00:09:46,800
[Music]

284
00:09:45,519 --> 00:09:48,560
again it's going to be your better

285
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:50,000
option when you get into a droughty

286
00:09:48,560 --> 00:09:52,399
situation like we've had last couple

287
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:55,360
weeks we get into a wet period

288
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:56,720
we may end up struggling again so we'll

289
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:58,240
have to see how that goes

290
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,920
the other thing that i like about this

291
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,839
is that you can direct seed and plant

292
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,399
other things into it pretty easily

293
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,279
one other thing to note with the peat

294
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:07,839
and perlite

295
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:10,399
is i had commented on the ease in

296
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:13,920
planting into the chipped up stuff

297
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:14,800
this is even easier i think i had timed

298
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,160
at one point

299
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:22,240
and we were able to plant an entire

300
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:22,959
tower in a minute which means on a long

301
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:25,440
road you got an

302
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:26,880
hour planting which is fast i mean you

303
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:30,079
can do a short row like this

304
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:32,399
one person in 45 minutes right and our

305
00:10:30,079 --> 00:10:36,480
reports will all reflect actual

306
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:39,920
person hours per per unit

307
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:42,230
but it's fast so what led us to the sare

308
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,079
farmer rancher program

309
00:10:42,230 --> 00:10:45,760
[Music]

310
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:47,600
one of the challenges with growing

311
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:50,880
strawberries in these vertical upright

312
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:52,720
towers is um

313
00:10:50,880 --> 00:10:54,800
water distribution water holding

314
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:58,800
capacity in these towers

315
00:10:54,800 --> 00:11:02,880
oftentimes you will see the bottom

316
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:06,880
pots of these towers get too much water

317
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,880
and uh they go um

318
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:11,680
the start showing signs of iron

319
00:11:08,880 --> 00:11:14,959
chlorosis boron deficiency

320
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,720
and it's very difficult to manage water

321
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:18,079
distribution and nutrient distribution

322
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:21,279
through those vertical

323
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:22,959
towers looking at the sare

324
00:11:21,279 --> 00:11:24,640
projects looking at a lot of the other

325
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:26,160
research nobody's really doing a lot of

326
00:11:24,640 --> 00:11:28,800
research on these vertical

327
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:30,160
towers they're all flat dead based

328
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:31,440
systems whether it's

329
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:33,839
farmer ranchers or whether it's

330
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,640
university research

331
00:11:33,839 --> 00:11:37,680
we had a very specific question that we

332
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,560
wanted to

333
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:40,959
answer very specific to our farm but

334
00:11:40,560 --> 00:11:43,200
it's

335
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:45,200
applicable to people that are growing

336
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:48,720
vertical strawberries across

337
00:11:45,200 --> 00:11:51,600
across the country um and then

338
00:11:48,720 --> 00:11:53,040
knowing krista um poking around and

339
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:53,680
asking some questions about how we go

340
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:55,360
about

341
00:11:53,680 --> 00:11:57,839
go about doing this whether we can make

342
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:58,560
it work for us that's kind of what drove

343
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,839
us to

344
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:03,680
actually taking a chance to write

345
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:05,120
a project for the sare farmer rancher

346
00:12:03,680 --> 00:12:07,279
grant here in the north central

347
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:08,880
region how easy or how difficult that is

348
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:10,959
i'm a little bit biased because i write

349
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,320
grants on a fairly regular

350
00:12:10,959 --> 00:12:15,440
basis but again we knew what problem

351
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:17,760
that we

352
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:19,200
wanted to address and we were able to

353
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:21,920
sit down

354
00:12:19,200 --> 00:12:24,639
and go through that process for the sare

355
00:12:21,920 --> 00:12:26,959
farmer rancher grant

356
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:28,639
i think we started writing it and we set

357
00:12:26,959 --> 00:12:29,839
it aside for about six months at

358
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:32,399
one point because we knew we were going

359
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:34,560
to apply but it wasn't around

360
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:36,320
but i spent a few hours one night kind

361
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:37,600
of throwing ideas together and starting

362
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:38,480
to figure out what our plots are going

363
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,160
to look like

364
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,240
and then when we came back to actually

365
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:45,519
write it and finish putting it together

366
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
it was not difficult one of the more

367
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:49,040
challenging

368
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:51,279
parts of the proposal although i found

369
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:53,279
it to be really valuable was to go back

370
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:56,079
and look at what the other sarah folks

371
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:57,839
had been doing in other regions we found

372
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:58,639
a lot of good information that was being

373
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:00,399
done

374
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:03,200
in other places and we were able to talk

375
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:05,839
about what else is being done

376
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,440
and how or why it's not relevant to us

377
00:13:05,839 --> 00:13:09,519
but we did find some tips and tricks and

378
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,200
some information that we pulled

379
00:13:09,519 --> 00:13:13,519
from those and we'll actually be able to

380
