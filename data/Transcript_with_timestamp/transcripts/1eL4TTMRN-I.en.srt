February is ideal this gives them a head

19
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,680
start before the outdoor growing season

20
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:55,719
begins Begin by filling seed trays with

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,199
a high quality seed starting mix use a

22
00:00:55,719 --> 00:01:00,960
seed starting mix moisten it and plant

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,079
seeds about a/4 inch deep it's important

24
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,560
to ensure the mix is evenly moist but

25
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,159
not water logged this creates the

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:09,360
perfect environment for seeds to

27
00:01:07,159 --> 00:01:11,680
germinate place your seed trays in a

00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,799
is insufficient grow lights can provide

32
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:24,439
the necessary illumination keep the soil

33
00:01:21,799 --> 00:01:27,079
consistently moist but not soggy

34
00:01:24,439 --> 00:01:29,280
overwatering can lead to root rot while

35
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,560
underwatering can cause the seedlings to

36
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:32,880
dry out

37
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:35,600
a gentle misting or careful watering can

38
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:38,320

lights they need at least 14 16 hours of

90
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,519
light each day to grow well if natural

91
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,400
sunlight is limited using grow lights

92
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:46,080
can ensure they get the necessary light

93
00:03:45,400 --> 00:03:48,959
for

February gives it a head start this

122
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,919
early start is crucial because broccoli

123
00:05:02,840 --> 00:05:07,759
needs a long growing season to develop

124
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,960
its full flavor and nutritional profile

125
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:12,280
and ensures it has ample time to mature

126
00:05:09,960 --> 00:05:14,680
before the summer heat sets in the heat

127
00:05:12,280 --> 00:05:16,960
can cause broccoli to bolt or flour

128
00:05:14,680 --> 00:05:19,639
prematurely which affects its taste and

129
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:22,120
texture use a highquality seed starting

130
00:05:19,639 --> 00:05:24,800
mix moisten it and make sure it is well

131
00:05:22,120 --> 00:05:27,319
draining to prevent root rot sew seeds

132
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:29,199
about a/ in deep planting them at the

133
00:05:27,319 --> 00:05:31,720
right depth ensures they have the best

134
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:33,720
chance to germinate and grow strong

135
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:35,800
broccoli seedlings prefer cooler

136
00:05:33,720 --> 00:05:38,840
temperatures which helps them develop

137
00:05:35,800 --> 00:05:43,120
sturdy stems and healthy leaves around

138
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:45,199
60 to 65° F maintaining this temperature

139
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:48,000
range is key to preventing stress and

140
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:50,960
promoting steady growth keep the soil

141
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:53,800
consistently moist but not water logged

142
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:55,759
overwatering can lead to fungal diseases

143
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,400
so it's important to strike the right
