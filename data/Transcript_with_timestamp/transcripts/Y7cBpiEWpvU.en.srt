00:00:16,920 --> 00:00:20,460
environmental and energy study Institute

9
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:22,619
and today our look at the farm bill

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:26,100
continues with conservation practices

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,080
from farms to forests and wetlands

12
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:29,760
you could say perhaps that we saved the

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:31,439
best for last in other words we've

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:34,079
conserved

15
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,880
the LA the best briefing for last that's

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,380
about as punny as we're gonna get today

17
00:00:35,880 --> 00:00:39,360
if you came to the forestry briefing

18
00:00:37,380 --> 00:00:40,920
there was a lot a lot better puns but

19
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:44,100
just wanted to at least get that out

20
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:45,899
there also like to say huge thanks to

21
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:48,300

22
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:50,340

together for this really excellent

25
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:56,640
conversation eesi was founded in 1984 on

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:58,079
a bipartisan basis by members of

27
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,239
Congress to provide educational

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
resources to policy makers about climate

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,199
change topics that means next year is

30
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:05,600
our 40th anniversary and we're still

31
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,040
going strong

32
00:01:05,600 --> 00:01:10,200
briefings like this are probably the

33
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:13,200
highest profile thing we do we do a lot

34
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:15,299
of briefings and we cover lots of topics

35
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,860
even Beyond Farm Bill topics so while

36
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:18,840
this is a five-part series about the

37
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:20,460
farm bill we've also recently covered

38
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:22,820
Department of Energy's nuclear energy

39
00:01:20,460 --> 00:01:25,619
programs office of Energy Efficiency and

40
00:01:22,820 --> 00:01:27,119
renewable energy programs we did a

41
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,799
four-part congressional climate Camp

42
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:30,600
series earlier this year we looked at

43
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,220
public polling about climate change we

44
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:34,320
talked about non-cot in-house gas

45
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:36,180
emissions and other pollutants the

46
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,759
budget and Appropriations process so not

47
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,979
just substance also process and then

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,560

we do briefings we also do a lot of

83
00:02:49,560 --> 00:02:54,599
writing we do a lot of articles for

84
00:02:52,440 --> 00:02:56,220
example we do fact sheets we just

85
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:57,780
released a fact sheet

86
00:02:56,220 --> 00:02:59,400
couple weeks ago about heavy duty

87
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,800
electric vehicles it's a real it's a

88
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:03,540
must read we just posted one today about

89
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,980
the renew America's nonprofits program

90
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:07,440
which was enacted as part of the

91
00:03:04,980 --> 00:03:11,040
infrastructure investment jobs act we do

92
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,319
side by side by side comparisons of uh

93
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,760
eventually when we get House and Senate

94
00:03:13,319 --> 00:03:16,260
marks of the farm bill we'll compare

95
00:03:14,760 --> 00:03:18,180
that with existing law to help you

96
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:19,680
compare not just what the two Chambers

97
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,599
are proposing to do but also how those

98
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:23,700
compare to each other we do a lot of

99
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:25,680
issue briefs if you haven't read our

100
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:27,300
sustainable Aviation emissions or

101
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:29,459
sustainable aviation fuel Aviation

102
00:03:27,300 --> 00:03:32,640
emissions issue brief that's one of our

103
00:03:29,459 --> 00:03:34,019
most popular resources so pretty much if

104
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,000
your boss comes to you and has a

105
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:37,980
question about a climate change topics

106
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,959
I would go dollars to Donuts that we

107
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,400
have a resource from the last year or

108
00:03:39,959 --> 00:03:43,739
two that will help you answer those

109
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:46,140
questions and do it in a non-partisan

110
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,299
science-based way if you like what

111
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:51,120
you're seeing visit us online all of our

112
00:03:48,299 --> 00:03:53,159
resources are free and available uh if

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:54,659
you visit us and my colleagues and I

114
00:03:53,159 --> 00:03:57,000
we're all wearing our little lapel pins

115
00:03:54,659 --> 00:03:58,500
and so if you have questions that we

116
00:03:57,000 --> 00:04:00,659
don't you know whether it's conservation

117
00:03:58,500 --> 00:04:02,280
topics or other things catch up with me

118
00:04:00,659 --> 00:04:03,599
and Molly and Nicole and others we'll

119
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:04,980
all be hanging out after the briefing

120
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:06,180
and we'd love to get to know you and

121
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:08,760
learn a little bit more about your

122
00:04:06,180 --> 00:04:10,500
interests and your boss's priorities

123
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:12,480
the conservation title of the farm bill

124
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,400
is what brings us here today and that's

125
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,959
because it contains important programs

126
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:18,239
and policies that help agricultural

127
00:04:15,959 --> 00:04:19,320
producers Forest managers and Rural

128
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,239
communities take advantage of

129
00:04:19,320 --> 00:04:22,979
opportunities to reduce greenhouse gas

130
00:04:21,239 --> 00:04:25,979
emissions and build resilience to

131
00:04:22,979 --> 00:04:27,720
climate impacts and that happens while

132
00:04:25,979 --> 00:04:29,880
also generating other benefits for

133
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:32,419
example improved water and air quality

134
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,380
soil Health biodiversity and jobs

135
00:04:32,419 --> 00:04:35,880
conservation of public-private working

136
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:37,800
and non-working lands can take many

137
00:04:35,880 --> 00:04:40,080
forms from regenerative agricultural

138
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:41,580
practices to conservation easements and

139
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,139
our All-Star panel today will help

140
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:45,360
everyone understand what that looks like

141
00:04:43,139 --> 00:04:47,520
in practice and some things that you

142
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:49,919
might be thinking about as a House and

143
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:51,840
Senate start to really get to work on

144
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:54,060

145
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,040

taken over the past year to prepare for

227
00:08:04,199 --> 00:08:08,580
the upcoming Farm Bill reauthorization

228
00:08:06,380 --> 00:08:10,319

00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:14,819
listening tour and I don't have enough

Auction just so many things and many of

236
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,259
the agriculture professionals that I've

237
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:33,719
spoken to uh mention the need for us to

238
00:08:31,259 --> 00:08:35,219
protect our lands so that Future Farmers

239
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:37,380
and producers can support their

240
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:41,159
businesses and families as well as our

241
00:08:37,380 --> 00:08:43,800
economy for generations to come and that

242
00:08:41,159 --> 00:08:46,140
includes combating climate change and

243
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:47,940
extreme weather events like flooding and

244
00:08:46,140 --> 00:08:50,160
drought which can devastate our

245
00:08:47,940 --> 00:08:52,440
agricultural community in Kansas and

246
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,660

instrumental in achieving this goal this

250
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:04,260
includes the conservation Reserve

251
00:09:01,740 --> 00:09:07,320
program and the Environmental Quality

252
00:09:04,260 --> 00:09:09,600
incentives program which gives farmers

253
00:09:07,320 --> 00:09:11,880
and producers the tools to mitigate the

254
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:14,100
effects of climate change in their

255
00:09:11,880 --> 00:09:16,140
communities and to ensure that they can

256
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:18,180

00:13:33,959 --> 00:13:39,660
program land access for a new generation

376
00:13:37,139 --> 00:13:42,600
of farmers Business technical assistance

377
00:13:39,660 --> 00:13:44,339
Farm viability and smart solar and I

378
00:13:42,600 --> 00:13:46,260
left some resources on the front table

379
00:13:44,339 --> 00:13:48,660
about that but like I said I'm going to

380
00:13:46,260 --> 00:13:50,040
focus on sound farming practices and

381
00:13:48,660 --> 00:13:52,860
I've been asked to give a one-on-one

382
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:54,600
what they are why they matter and the

383
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:55,980
programs that support them and then I

384
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,660
can't help myself talking about the farm

385
00:13:55,980 --> 00:13:58,800
bill given where we are in the time of

386
00:13:57,660 --> 00:14:00,839
year

387
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:03,180
so first what is soil Health how many

388
00:14:00,839 --> 00:14:05,279
folks are familiar with soil health

389
00:14:03,180 --> 00:14:07,560
definition practices great well then I'm

390
00:14:05,279 --> 00:14:09,660
glad I included this slide so the

391
00:14:07,560 --> 00:14:11,399
definition of soil Health from the

392
00:14:09,660 --> 00:14:15,360
natural resources conservation service

393
00:14:11,399 --> 00:14:17,700
at USDA or nrcs is the ability of soil

394
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:21,060
to function as a living ecosystem that

395
00:14:17,700 --> 00:14:23,880
supports plants animals and humans and

396
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:27,540
then here this very large graphic from

397
00:14:23,880 --> 00:14:30,180
nrcs as well depicts the four principles

398
00:14:27,540 --> 00:14:32,360
that farmers and ranchers may follow to

399
00:14:30,180 --> 00:14:34,980
improve their soil health so that's

400
00:14:32,360 --> 00:14:37,560
maximizing biodiversity that can look

401
00:14:34,980 --> 00:14:40,560
like integrating animals into Crop

402
00:14:37,560 --> 00:14:42,540
Production or diversifying crop rotation

403
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:44,399
growing more crops

404
00:14:42,540 --> 00:14:47,279
reducing disturbance so that can look

405
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,339
like no-till as congresswoman David's

406
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,680
mentioned or reduced tillage maximizing

407
00:14:50,339 --> 00:14:54,680
cover like planting cover crops in the

408
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:57,360
off season in between cash crops

409
00:14:54,680 --> 00:15:00,120
maximizing living Roots like planting

410
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:03,060
cover crops or planting perennials

411
00:15:00,120 --> 00:15:05,519
so there's your soil Health 101

412
00:15:03,060 --> 00:15:07,860
why does soil Health matter so many

413
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:11,699
benefits from soil Health to the farmers

414
00:15:07,860 --> 00:15:12,899
to communities and to the taxpayer as

415
00:15:11,699 --> 00:15:14,519
well and I'll talk about each of these

416
00:15:12,899 --> 00:15:17,399
in turn so

417
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:19,860
top graphic you see here is from aft's

418
00:15:17,399 --> 00:15:21,899
soil Health case studies ESI has

419
00:15:19,860 --> 00:15:25,920
resources which will link you to these

420
00:15:21,899 --> 00:15:28,199
on the website we found that over time

421
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,699
investment in soil Health practices can

422
00:15:28,199 --> 00:15:32,459
generate a three to one return on

423
00:15:29,699 --> 00:15:34,740
investment for producers can take a few

424
00:15:32,459 --> 00:15:37,079
years to find that benefit that return

425
00:15:34,740 --> 00:15:38,100
on investment but it's quite good as you

426
00:15:37,079 --> 00:15:40,680
can see

427
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:42,959
there was also a 2021 study that showed

428
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:45,000
under extreme drought conditions that a

429
00:15:42,959 --> 00:15:46,620
one percent increase in soil organic

430
00:15:45,000 --> 00:15:47,940
matter which is a chief soil Health

431
00:15:46,620 --> 00:15:50,699
indicator

432
00:15:47,940 --> 00:15:54,120
can increase yields under those drought

433
00:15:50,699 --> 00:15:56,639
conditions by 33 bushels so soil Health

434
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,839
practices promote resilience how many of

435
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:00,120
you are seeing more extreme weather

436
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,860
across the country

437
00:16:00,120 --> 00:16:03,240
right I see a lot of head nodding a lot

438
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:05,459
of hands going up

439
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,019
under drought and flood conditions these

440
00:16:05,459 --> 00:16:08,940
practices are super important for

441
00:16:07,019 --> 00:16:09,779
helping build resilience on a farm or

442
00:16:08,940 --> 00:16:12,839
Ranch

443
00:16:09,779 --> 00:16:15,420
and to stabilizing yields under those

444
00:16:12,839 --> 00:16:17,760
conditions co-benefits for communities

445
00:16:15,420 --> 00:16:19,980
improved water quality reduce soil

446
00:16:17,760 --> 00:16:22,560
erosion on the farm keeps it out of our

447
00:16:19,980 --> 00:16:24,000
our rivers and our waterways flood

448
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,040
mitigation same reason water

449
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,600
infiltration into the soils keeps it

450
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:29,940
away from impervious surfaces and

451
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:32,160
communities and increased carbon

452
00:16:29,940 --> 00:16:34,199
sequestration to help fight climate

453
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,959
change literally drawing carbon from the

454
00:16:34,199 --> 00:16:39,779
air into the soil

455
00:16:36,959 --> 00:16:41,880
and I mentioned taxpayers I'm sure many

456
00:16:39,779 --> 00:16:45,000
of your bosses care about taxpayer

457
00:16:41,880 --> 00:16:48,000
dollars in 2019 the economic research

458
00:16:45,000 --> 00:16:49,920
service at USDA came out with a study

459
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,800
that looked at the expected cost

460
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,240
increases to crop insurance from climate

461
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:55,920
change and extreme weather and they

462
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,920
found that under a business's usual

463
00:16:55,920 --> 00:17:02,220
scenario expectations for those costs to

464
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:04,380
increase by 37 percent this Century but

465
00:17:02,220 --> 00:17:06,600
if Farmers adopt adaptation practices

466
00:17:04,380 --> 00:17:08,699
such as soil Health practices it could

467
00:17:06,600 --> 00:17:11,040
go down significantly to only as much as

468
00:17:08,699 --> 00:17:13,199
22 percent so these are really important

469
00:17:11,040 --> 00:17:14,760
for a lot of different reasons

470
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:17,220
but

471
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:21,720
they're not very widely adopted for

472
00:17:17,220 --> 00:17:23,220
example as of 2017 only six percent of

473
00:17:21,720 --> 00:17:25,500
eligible Acres that could have been

474
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:28,199
planted with cover crops were

475
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:29,400
leaving 94 percent of Acres bare in the

476
00:17:28,199 --> 00:17:32,040
off season

477
00:17:29,400 --> 00:17:34,200
why is that

478
00:17:32,040 --> 00:17:36,179
farmers are working really hard to feed

479
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:38,580
their families to feed their communities

480
00:17:36,179 --> 00:17:41,039
and they face a lot of important

481
00:17:38,580 --> 00:17:43,380
barriers that need to be overcome to

482
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,299
changing from tried and true methods and

483
00:17:43,380 --> 00:17:46,919
adopting new practices and Management

484
00:17:45,299 --> 00:17:49,380
Systems

485
00:17:46,919 --> 00:17:50,820
chief of which cost cost of new

486
00:17:49,380 --> 00:17:54,419
equipment

487
00:17:50,820 --> 00:17:57,660
cost of seed cost in time figuring out

488
00:17:54,419 --> 00:18:00,299
how to do things risk perceived or real

489
00:17:57,660 --> 00:18:03,419
risk of yield loss

490
00:18:00,299 --> 00:18:05,580
information gaps and barriers what do I

491
00:18:03,419 --> 00:18:07,500
do how do I know how to do it no access

492
00:18:05,580 --> 00:18:09,960
to the right information or lack of

493
00:18:07,500 --> 00:18:12,059
knowing where to look cultural barriers

494
00:18:09,960 --> 00:18:14,160
so it may just not be what has been done

495
00:18:12,059 --> 00:18:16,020
though I will acknowledge there are many

496
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,340
producers that have been doing practice

497
00:18:16,020 --> 00:18:19,799
that have been practicing these

498
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:21,720
practices for centuries even and then

499
00:18:19,799 --> 00:18:23,340
insecure land tenure I mentioned that

500
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:25,500
sometimes it can take time for these

501
00:18:23,340 --> 00:18:27,419
practices to pay off how many of you

502
00:18:25,500 --> 00:18:29,940
rent or have rented in your in your

503
00:18:27,419 --> 00:18:31,980
lives you're less apt to invest in

504
00:18:29,940 --> 00:18:34,320
improvements if you're renting right

505
00:18:31,980 --> 00:18:36,480
versus if you're owning because it's not

506
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,760
going to really benefit you per se over

507
00:18:36,480 --> 00:18:41,780
the long term so insecure land tenure is

508
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:41,780
important to address as well

509
00:18:42,059 --> 00:18:45,960
what we're here to talk about today

510
00:18:43,320 --> 00:18:48,660
there are programs that are out there to

511
00:18:45,960 --> 00:18:50,880
address so many of these barriers and

512
00:18:48,660 --> 00:18:52,679
I'm going to talk about nrcs programs

513
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:54,780
today

514
00:18:52,679 --> 00:18:56,880
conservation Reserve program this is

515
00:18:54,780 --> 00:19:01,020
administered by the Farm Service Agency

516
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:03,780
or FSA this is a

517
00:19:01,020 --> 00:19:05,820
term retirement program that provides

518
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,039
Farmers with rental payments if they

519
00:19:05,820 --> 00:19:09,419
were to enter into a CRP contract for a

520
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:11,039
length of time

521
00:19:09,419 --> 00:19:13,140
the rest of these are administered by

522
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:16,080
nrcs so you've got the Environmental

523
00:19:13,140 --> 00:19:18,179
Quality incentives program which invests

524
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:22,320
in shorter term contracts to address

525
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:24,179
identified resource concerns on the farm

526
00:19:22,320 --> 00:19:25,980
then you've got the conservation

527
00:19:24,179 --> 00:19:29,640
stewardship program just kind of like

528
00:19:25,980 --> 00:19:32,160
the next level graduation step two this

529
00:19:29,640 --> 00:19:34,080
invests in longer term contracts perhaps

530
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,179
around five years to invest in

531
00:19:34,080 --> 00:19:38,220
maintaining those practices and adding

532
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,440
new enhancements

533
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:42,299
the asep program agricultural

534
00:19:40,440 --> 00:19:44,640
conservation easement program which my

535
00:19:42,299 --> 00:19:46,860
colleague Chris coffin works on invests

536
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:47,940
in permanently protecting Farmland this

537
00:19:46,860 --> 00:19:50,520
also can help with Farmland

538
00:19:47,940 --> 00:19:51,780
affordability and access and then the

539
00:19:50,520 --> 00:19:53,880
regional conservation partnership

540
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,919
program which invests in Regional or

541
00:19:53,880 --> 00:19:59,160
Watershed scale

542
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:02,220
um projects that are proposed by RCP

543
00:19:59,160 --> 00:20:03,720
folks who apply to the program to

544
00:20:02,220 --> 00:20:06,000
implement conservation on a regional

545
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:08,880
scale and maybe in more innovative ways

546
00:20:06,000 --> 00:20:10,980
that's the ideal for the program

547
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:13,260
this pie chart gives you an idea of the

548
00:20:10,980 --> 00:20:15,480
funding relative funding for each of

549
00:20:13,260 --> 00:20:18,360
these programs in the last Farm Bill

550
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:20,520
so you can see CRP was about a third

551
00:20:18,360 --> 00:20:22,340
and same with equip about a third of all

552
00:20:20,520 --> 00:20:25,559
the funding that went to these programs

553
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:28,799
CSP about a quarter and then a smaller

554
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:31,799
share for rcpp and for ASAP and for

555
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:34,200
equip and CSP in particular producers to

556
00:20:31,799 --> 00:20:36,179
gain access to that financial assistance

557
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,760
to overcome those cost barriers they

558
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:40,500
need to work with somebody who is

559
00:20:38,760 --> 00:20:42,720
qualified to provide them with technical

560
00:20:40,500 --> 00:20:45,600
assistance so that could be an nrcs

561
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:47,520
staff person it could be someone else

562
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:50,220
that nrcs has entered into agreement

563
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:52,260
with aft has some of those planners on

564
00:20:50,220 --> 00:20:53,940
staff and they work with the producer

565
00:20:52,260 --> 00:20:55,559
directly to identify what are the

566
00:20:53,940 --> 00:20:59,280
resource concerns that you want to work

567
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:02,580
on what practices that nrcs supports

568
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:04,740
funding for can we invest in and then

569
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,299
helps them find financial assistance for

570
00:21:04,740 --> 00:21:08,580
those

571
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:09,780
hopefully everybody's clear on the 101

572
00:21:08,580 --> 00:21:12,720
so

573
00:21:09,780 --> 00:21:15,059
um back last year aft uh held Farm Bill

574
00:21:12,720 --> 00:21:16,380
workshops with farmers and ranchers

575
00:21:15,059 --> 00:21:18,960
across the country with service

576
00:21:16,380 --> 00:21:20,340
providers researchers and others and we

577
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,160
learned a little bit about what's

578
00:21:20,340 --> 00:21:25,020
working really well and what where we

579
00:21:23,160 --> 00:21:28,440
have opportunities for improvement for

580
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:29,940
these programs and so I've written a

581
00:21:28,440 --> 00:21:31,620
white paper with my colleagues and we

582
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:33,419
just released this last week I have a

583
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:35,880
few copies in writing here if folks want

584
00:21:33,419 --> 00:21:38,760
to grab them after but also available

585
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,640
from ESI by link

586
00:21:38,760 --> 00:21:43,559
and at a very high level

587
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:46,159
these are locally LED locally

588
00:21:43,559 --> 00:21:49,380
implemented programs with well-vetted

589
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:51,780
science-based standards so if you want

590
00:21:49,380 --> 00:21:53,159
to practice no-till there are

591
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:55,620
science-based ways that they have

592
00:21:53,159 --> 00:21:57,600
identified for you to do that

593
00:21:55,620 --> 00:21:59,640
on the needs for improvement they're

594
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:01,260
highly over subscribed a lot more demand

595
00:21:59,640 --> 00:22:04,200
than funding available

596
00:22:01,260 --> 00:22:05,820
and perhaps even more demand for

597
00:22:04,200 --> 00:22:08,340
technical assistance than agents

598
00:22:05,820 --> 00:22:11,280
available link the application processes

599
00:22:08,340 --> 00:22:13,440
Farmers have reported facing gaps in

600
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:16,679
support whether it be by production type

601
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:18,600
or region some Equity challenges we

602
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:20,700
heard a lot from small scale producers

603
00:22:18,600 --> 00:22:23,580
small operations that they struggle to

604
00:22:20,700 --> 00:22:25,500
access this assistance and there there's

605
00:22:23,580 --> 00:22:27,360
some limited room to invest in

606
00:22:25,500 --> 00:22:30,059
Innovation because they're supporting

607
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:32,340
the really tried and true practices with

608
00:22:30,059 --> 00:22:34,740
the exception of rcpp and conservation

609
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:36,720
Innovation grants within the equip

610
00:22:34,740 --> 00:22:40,200
program

611
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:42,840
for example between 2010 and 2020 only

612
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:46,200
30 percent of equip applications were

613
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:48,600
able to be funded so less than a third

614
00:22:46,200 --> 00:22:49,919
and there was also a study released in

615
00:22:48,600 --> 00:22:54,840
2020

616
00:22:49,919 --> 00:22:59,400
that showed that between 2009 and 2018

617
00:22:54,840 --> 00:23:01,200
only 17 to 27 percent of funding from

618
00:22:59,400 --> 00:23:02,580
equip one towards soil Health practices

619
00:23:01,200 --> 00:23:04,919
so they're investing in a lot of

620
00:23:02,580 --> 00:23:08,280
different resource concerns so just a

621
00:23:04,919 --> 00:23:10,500
small share of the overall pot there

622
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:12,240
we have developed some goals

623
00:23:10,500 --> 00:23:14,460
recommendations that I'll just touch on

624
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:16,380
briefly you can find more information in

625
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:18,480
our white papers

626
00:23:16,380 --> 00:23:21,059
um and those like I said those links are

627
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,820
available from eesi and our goals in

628
00:23:21,059 --> 00:23:26,220
this Arena are to support producers in

629
00:23:23,820 --> 00:23:28,200
increasing long-term adoption of

630
00:23:26,220 --> 00:23:30,720
conservation practices that will improve

631
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:32,340
soil Health address climate change build

632
00:23:30,720 --> 00:23:34,679
resilience

633
00:23:32,340 --> 00:23:37,200
to make nrcs programs more accessible

634
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:39,360
and equitably available and to benefit

635
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:40,679
or to build sorry farmer to Farmer

636
00:23:39,360 --> 00:23:42,299
learning networks and I'll say a little

637
00:23:40,679 --> 00:23:45,120
bit more about that

638
00:23:42,299 --> 00:23:47,700
so first on our checklist providing

639
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:49,860
sustainably increased funding to meet

640
00:23:47,700 --> 00:23:52,320
farmer demand for conservation financial

641
00:23:49,860 --> 00:23:54,900
and technical assistance the inflation

642
00:23:52,320 --> 00:23:56,760
reduction act injected a lot of funding

643
00:23:54,900 --> 00:24:01,500
into these programs but that funding

644
00:23:56,760 --> 00:24:03,240
sunsets in 2026. so you know solving the

645
00:24:01,500 --> 00:24:05,220
longer term how do we meet the funding

646
00:24:03,240 --> 00:24:07,140
demand problem hopefully something we

647
00:24:05,220 --> 00:24:08,820
can do this farm bill and streamlining

648
00:24:07,140 --> 00:24:12,799
program implementation and like I said

649
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:12,799
you can find more on this here

650
00:24:13,380 --> 00:24:19,140
oh there's some uh animation okay so

651
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:21,780
increasing support for Farmer to Farmer

652
00:24:19,140 --> 00:24:23,880
learning we see this as kind of the

653
00:24:21,780 --> 00:24:25,320
missing piece we're investing in

654
00:24:23,880 --> 00:24:27,360
technical assistance and financial

655
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:29,900
assistance it helps with cost barriers

656
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:32,460
this can help with information barriers

657
00:24:29,900 --> 00:24:35,159
cultural barriers can even help with

658
00:24:32,460 --> 00:24:37,919
land tenure farmer to Farmer learning is

659
00:24:35,159 --> 00:24:39,780
so critical to this conversation it

660
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:41,400
really helps to overcome the adoption

661
00:24:39,780 --> 00:24:44,400
barriers by having someone with

662
00:24:41,400 --> 00:24:47,760
first-hand experience address perceived

663
00:24:44,400 --> 00:24:50,580
risks to yield and more that may prevent

664
00:24:47,760 --> 00:24:53,340
a farmer from trying a new practice it's

665
00:24:50,580 --> 00:24:54,720
as much about what doesn't work as what

666
00:24:53,340 --> 00:24:56,760
does

667
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:58,620
this is already happening organically

668
00:24:56,760 --> 00:25:01,980
across the country informally formally

669
00:24:58,620 --> 00:25:03,960
in coffee shops Etc in the field

670
00:25:01,980 --> 00:25:07,020
according to a survey that we did in New

671
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:09,000
England over 50 percent of farmers that

672
00:25:07,020 --> 00:25:10,919
we surveyed were learning about

673
00:25:09,000 --> 00:25:12,840
conservation from other farmers and

674
00:25:10,919 --> 00:25:14,700
that's something we hear across the

675
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,620
country ask any farmer Rancher where do

676
00:25:14,700 --> 00:25:18,120
you learn about conservation nine times

677
00:25:16,620 --> 00:25:19,620
out of ten first thing they'll say is

678
00:25:18,120 --> 00:25:21,600
another farmer

679
00:25:19,620 --> 00:25:23,400
so we have a proposal to build this into

680
00:25:21,600 --> 00:25:25,679
the farm bill there's more information

681
00:25:23,400 --> 00:25:27,840
on the front table or I can provide it

682
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:30,480
creating a program that provides

683
00:25:27,840 --> 00:25:32,940
matching funds for state and tribal soil

684
00:25:30,480 --> 00:25:35,220
health programs so there are Innovations

685
00:25:32,940 --> 00:25:37,679
happening there are locally LED programs

686
00:25:35,220 --> 00:25:39,779
being developed at the state level I can

687
00:25:37,679 --> 00:25:42,240
we have another white paper on that that

688
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:44,580
gives you tons of examples of that we've

689
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,320
done a webinar as well you can find more

690
00:25:44,580 --> 00:25:49,020
information on that or just ask me

691
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,539
creating a program in the farm bill to

692
00:25:49,020 --> 00:25:53,520
match those funds to augment them helps

693
00:25:51,539 --> 00:25:56,880
to augment Innovation for locally LED

694
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:59,220
programs build off of nrcs programs and

695
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:02,159
to fill gaps for example many states

696
00:25:59,220 --> 00:26:03,840
invest in equipment purchase for soil

697
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:06,419
Health practice adoption and that's a

698
00:26:03,840 --> 00:26:08,460
really big key barrier

699
00:26:06,419 --> 00:26:09,720
oh and I should also mention there are a

700
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:11,520
couple of bills the agriculture

701
00:26:09,720 --> 00:26:12,960
resilience act includes this in the bill

702
00:26:11,520 --> 00:26:15,779
and there was a bill introduced last

703
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:18,960
week by Representatives Gallagher Nunn

704
00:26:15,779 --> 00:26:20,460
and Huffman uh it's called the noemits

705
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,440
act that includes a proposal for this

706
00:26:20,460 --> 00:26:24,419
and the area was introduced by Senator

707
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:26,580
Heinrich and representative Pingree

708
00:26:24,419 --> 00:26:29,460
amongst others and you can see on this

709
00:26:26,580 --> 00:26:31,380
memo just incredibly broad support I

710
00:26:29,460 --> 00:26:35,340
have a little pointer incredibly broad

711
00:26:31,380 --> 00:26:37,559
support for this across the country

712
00:26:35,340 --> 00:26:39,419
finally I mentioned we heard small scale

713
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:41,220
operations struggle to access some of

714
00:26:39,419 --> 00:26:44,520
these programs so we've been working

715
00:26:41,220 --> 00:26:47,400
with Senator Booker Representatives

716
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:50,220
um I'm sorry I just my card but I can

717
00:26:47,400 --> 00:26:52,799
remember Representatives uh Strickland

718
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:54,419
Adams and McGovern to introduce a bill

719
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:56,880
which was introduced recently the office

720
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:59,640
of small farms establishment Act

721
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,740
that would basically look through USDA

722
00:26:59,640 --> 00:27:03,659
program policies and make sure that

723
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:06,120
small-scale producers are able to access

724
00:27:03,659 --> 00:27:09,659
not just conservation programs but all

725
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:11,640
the services that USDA provides

726
00:27:09,659 --> 00:27:13,740
and so I encourage you to keep in touch

727
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,179
this is my contact information you can

728
00:27:13,740 --> 00:27:16,919
look on our website for all these

729
00:27:15,179 --> 00:27:19,140
resources and like I said some of them

730
00:27:16,919 --> 00:27:20,820
are available through eesi we're also

731
00:27:19,140 --> 00:27:23,039
working on crop insurance and

732
00:27:20,820 --> 00:27:25,080
conservation happy to talk about that

733
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:28,080
and like I said ASAP land access

734
00:27:25,080 --> 00:27:31,220
Business technical assistance and solar

735
00:27:28,080 --> 00:27:31,220
and thank you so much

736
00:27:31,310 --> 00:27:36,360
[Applause]

737
00:27:34,380 --> 00:27:38,039
for your fabulous presentation and if

738
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,299
anyone would like to revisit that

739
00:27:38,039 --> 00:27:41,179
fabulous presentation I have two

740
00:27:39,299 --> 00:27:43,559
suggestions one would be to go to

741
00:27:41,179 --> 00:27:45,059
esi.org and download all the great

742
00:27:43,559 --> 00:27:46,380
materials and presentation materials

743
00:27:45,059 --> 00:27:48,360
that Samantha just presented and

744
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:50,340
referred to you could also watch the

745
00:27:48,360 --> 00:27:51,360
archived webcast will be up in a few

746
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:52,980
days so if you want to go back and

747
00:27:51,360 --> 00:27:54,659
revisit anything that Samantha just said

748
00:27:52,980 --> 00:27:57,299
or anything that our other panelists are

749
00:27:54,659 --> 00:27:59,760
about to say that resources available to

750
00:27:57,299 --> 00:28:01,740
you including the the white paper that

751
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:03,480
you that you mentioned

752
00:28:01,740 --> 00:28:06,299
um our second panelist today is Eileen

753
00:28:03,480 --> 00:28:08,640
Shader Eileen is the director of river

754
00:28:06,299 --> 00:28:10,440
Restoration in American rivers in 2015

755
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,240
she relocated to her home state of

756
00:28:10,440 --> 00:28:14,700
Pennsylvania where she leads American

757
00:28:12,240 --> 00:28:17,220
River's National floodplain flood plain

758
00:28:14,700 --> 00:28:19,020
restoration program Eileen spent most of

759
00:28:17,220 --> 00:28:20,279
her career at American rivers advocating

760
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,919
to Congress and the federal government

761
00:28:20,279 --> 00:28:25,559
to support sound floodplain management

762
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:26,880
policies prior to joining American River

763
00:28:25,559 --> 00:28:28,380
she held positions at the National

764
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,500
Wildlife Federation the National

765
00:28:28,380 --> 00:28:33,480
Environmental trust and U.S EPA Eileen

766
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,159
is a certified floodplain manager and

767
00:28:33,480 --> 00:28:37,679
works to reconnect rivers to their flood

768
00:28:35,159 --> 00:28:40,380
Plains and restore natural floodplain

769
00:28:37,679 --> 00:28:42,419
habitats my lean the clicker is yours

770
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:44,220
take it away thank you thank you very

771
00:28:42,419 --> 00:28:46,980
much

772
00:28:44,220 --> 00:28:48,539
thank you

773
00:28:46,980 --> 00:28:50,039
there we go

774
00:28:48,539 --> 00:28:52,200
um thank you very much for having me and

775
00:28:50,039 --> 00:28:53,940
really appreciate the opportunity uh to

776
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:57,179
participate in this briefing and talk

777
00:28:53,940 --> 00:28:59,279
about uh the farm bill and conservation

778
00:28:57,179 --> 00:29:01,200
practices so

779
00:28:59,279 --> 00:29:05,100
um today I'm going to focus on

780
00:29:01,200 --> 00:29:06,200
um a program that is technically an

781
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:11,700
emergency

782
00:29:06,200 --> 00:29:14,460
Protection Program under the nrcs but in

783
00:29:11,700 --> 00:29:17,840
reality is a conservation program and

784
00:29:14,460 --> 00:29:17,840
how it is applied so

785
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:22,620
um if you're not familiar with American

786
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:24,840
Rivers we are a premier National River

787
00:29:22,620 --> 00:29:27,120
conservation organization that works to

788
00:29:24,840 --> 00:29:28,679
protect wild rivers restore damaged

789
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,240
rivers and conserve clean water for

790
00:29:28,679 --> 00:29:32,100
people in nature

791
00:29:30,240 --> 00:29:34,460
um and then Stan mentioned I lead our

792
00:29:32,100 --> 00:29:37,860
national floodplain restoration program

793
00:29:34,460 --> 00:29:39,659
uh which is uh focused on working with

794
00:29:37,860 --> 00:29:42,480
partners and communities across the

795
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:45,899
country to implement nature-based

796
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:46,820
Equitable and multi-benefit floodplain

797
00:29:45,899 --> 00:29:50,100
management

798
00:29:46,820 --> 00:29:52,440
programs and projects so that can

799
00:29:50,100 --> 00:29:54,659
include anything from we have staff

800
00:29:52,440 --> 00:29:57,240
working directly on the ground to

801
00:29:54,659 --> 00:30:01,260
reconnect rivers to their floodplains

802
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:03,659
restore natural habitat to working at uh

803
00:30:01,260 --> 00:30:06,179
advancing state level programs that

804
00:30:03,659 --> 00:30:09,179
support multi-benefit projects that both

805
00:30:06,179 --> 00:30:11,220
reduce flood risk and ReStore Habitat

806
00:30:09,179 --> 00:30:13,919
for floodplain dependent species

807
00:30:11,220 --> 00:30:15,899
and working on federal policy

808
00:30:13,919 --> 00:30:17,940
initiatives like the farm bill and Water

809
00:30:15,899 --> 00:30:19,980
Resources development act and National

810
00:30:17,940 --> 00:30:21,840
flood insurance program but today we're

811
00:30:19,980 --> 00:30:24,419
going to talk about floodplain easement

812
00:30:21,840 --> 00:30:25,200
under the nrcs

813
00:30:24,419 --> 00:30:28,679
um

814
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:29,760
my colleague Olivia Dorothy who lives in

815
00:30:28,679 --> 00:30:32,100
Illinois and leaves our Mississippi

816
00:30:29,760 --> 00:30:36,539
River program wasn't able to be here

817
00:30:32,100 --> 00:30:39,360
today but she led the effort to produce

818
00:30:36,539 --> 00:30:41,580
a report on the multiple benefits of

819
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:43,919
floodplain easements that looked at

820
00:30:41,580 --> 00:30:46,880
their use within the Upper Midwest

821
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:49,320
states the Upper Mississippi and then

822
00:30:46,880 --> 00:30:51,779
assessed how floodplain easements are

823
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:54,120
utilized and how some of the challenges

824
00:30:51,779 --> 00:30:55,919
with that program so

825
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:57,480
um if you are

826
00:30:55,919 --> 00:30:58,559
well one thing I would say about the if

827
00:30:57,480 --> 00:31:00,679
you're not familiar with the floodplain

828
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:04,980
easement program

829
00:31:00,679 --> 00:31:08,100
essentially it works where the nrcs will

830
00:31:04,980 --> 00:31:10,820
put their voluntary program we'll put an

831
00:31:08,100 --> 00:31:12,620
easement on a flood-prone land

832
00:31:10,820 --> 00:31:15,799
agricultural land

833
00:31:12,620 --> 00:31:19,320
and then the landowner

834
00:31:15,799 --> 00:31:21,059
enters an agreement with the nrcs to

835
00:31:19,320 --> 00:31:23,520
restore that land to more natural

836
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:26,340
conditions so we're restoring the

837
00:31:23,520 --> 00:31:28,200
hydrology so that the water is able to

838
00:31:26,340 --> 00:31:30,720
soak into the ground restoring natural

839
00:31:28,200 --> 00:31:34,260
habitat and Native vegetation in order

840
00:31:30,720 --> 00:31:38,059
to improve the capacity of that that

841
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:38,059
land to provide benefits to society

842
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:43,020
uh when we talk about flood Plains I

843
00:31:40,679 --> 00:31:45,179
know many people think about a flood

844
00:31:43,020 --> 00:31:47,340
plain as the hundred year uh as

845
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:49,679
floodplain as defined by the national

846
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:52,020
flood insurance program and where you

847
00:31:49,679 --> 00:31:53,580
might need insurance but for our

848
00:31:52,020 --> 00:31:56,460
purposes we're talking about it more as

849
00:31:53,580 --> 00:31:58,919
an ecosystem or a landscape so the lands

850
00:31:56,460 --> 00:32:02,820
next to rivers and water bodies that

851
00:31:58,919 --> 00:32:05,159
gets flooded on a regular basis and uh

852
00:32:02,820 --> 00:32:07,260
some people think that flood Plains are

853
00:32:05,159 --> 00:32:09,480
interchangeable with Wetlands that's not

854
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:11,340
quite correct you can have Wetlands on a

855
00:32:09,480 --> 00:32:13,500
flood plain but not all flood Plains are

856
00:32:11,340 --> 00:32:16,740
wetlands flood Plains tend to have much

857
00:32:13,500 --> 00:32:18,480
more diverse ecosystems there will be

858
00:32:16,740 --> 00:32:20,820
some standing water there may be some

859
00:32:18,480 --> 00:32:24,539
side channels and streams there may be

860
00:32:20,820 --> 00:32:27,000
some areas of high elevation with

861
00:32:24,539 --> 00:32:29,340
different kinds of trees and and Native

862
00:32:27,000 --> 00:32:31,260
vegetation and one of the most amazing

863
00:32:29,340 --> 00:32:34,320
things about flood Plains is that many

864
00:32:31,260 --> 00:32:38,039
of our Wildlife and Fish and birds are

865
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:40,380
evolved to exist on a flood plain some

866
00:32:38,039 --> 00:32:42,899
part of their lives cycle depends on

867
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:45,919
access to a floodplain in order for them

868
00:32:42,899 --> 00:32:48,600
to thrive so they're really really

869
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:52,260
undervalued or underappreciated I should

870
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:54,299
say ecosystem within our within our

871
00:32:52,260 --> 00:32:56,039
nation and the world

872
00:32:54,299 --> 00:32:58,020
um and one of the great things about

873
00:32:56,039 --> 00:33:00,179
floodplains is they provide so many

874
00:32:58,020 --> 00:33:01,500
different benefits to society when they

875
00:33:00,179 --> 00:33:02,940
especially when they're in their natural

876
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:05,279
condition

877
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:08,039
um they are able to sequester carbon

878
00:33:05,279 --> 00:33:10,559
into deep root systems of native uh

879
00:33:08,039 --> 00:33:13,620
species or native plant species

880
00:33:10,559 --> 00:33:15,720
um they help to clean and capture

881
00:33:13,620 --> 00:33:18,059
um Clean Water by capturing excess

882
00:33:15,720 --> 00:33:21,299
nutrients of nitrogen and phosphorus and

883
00:33:18,059 --> 00:33:23,760
and these these uh pollutants that we're

884
00:33:21,299 --> 00:33:27,360
trying so hard to try and manage within

885
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:29,640
many of our agricultural waterways

886
00:33:27,360 --> 00:33:32,039
um and they're really amazing places for

887
00:33:29,640 --> 00:33:34,860
fish and wildlife which then produce

888
00:33:32,039 --> 00:33:38,960
recreational opportunities which are

889
00:33:34,860 --> 00:33:38,960
economic drivers for many communities

890
00:33:39,179 --> 00:33:44,399
so what made us start looking at

891
00:33:41,460 --> 00:33:46,799
floodplain easements as a program that

892
00:33:44,399 --> 00:33:49,559
maybe needed some improvements

893
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:53,220
um so our Interest really was sparked by

894
00:33:49,559 --> 00:33:55,500
um this one incident in um dog tooth

895
00:33:53,220 --> 00:33:57,260
Bend which is uh in Southern Illinois

896
00:33:55,500 --> 00:33:59,720
it's a

897
00:33:57,260 --> 00:34:03,600
area this is the Mississippi river

898
00:33:59,720 --> 00:34:07,140
flowing down here and this is a very

899
00:34:03,600 --> 00:34:09,560
heavy agricultural area this Levy

900
00:34:07,140 --> 00:34:13,139
District I believe is about 17 000 Acres

901
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:15,359
farmed in corn corn and soybeans and

902
00:34:13,139 --> 00:34:18,119
they experience regular flooding it's a

903
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:20,520
it's protected by a levy and we saw Levy

904
00:34:18,119 --> 00:34:22,379
breaches just happening over and over at

905
00:34:20,520 --> 00:34:24,179
this place in short because the

906
00:34:22,379 --> 00:34:26,940
Mississippi River wants to cut through

907
00:34:24,179 --> 00:34:28,619
there so it was a place where the the

908
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:30,780
river wants to go where it wants to go

909
00:34:28,619 --> 00:34:35,639
and it's going to take out that Levee

910
00:34:30,780 --> 00:34:38,220
and it did multiple times in 2016 the

911
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,139
Army Corps of Engineers decided that

912
00:34:38,220 --> 00:34:42,300
they weren't going to read about Levy

913
00:34:40,139 --> 00:34:45,179
anymore it was just not economically

914
00:34:42,300 --> 00:34:48,060
feasible to continue doing this and that

915
00:34:45,179 --> 00:34:50,760
they needed a new approach

916
00:34:48,060 --> 00:34:52,020
so for the farmers that are left in this

917
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:54,179
area

918
00:34:52,020 --> 00:34:56,159
um what can they do with their land what

919
00:34:54,179 --> 00:34:58,140
options do they have so many of them

920
00:34:56,159 --> 00:34:59,760
started looking at conservation programs

921
00:34:58,140 --> 00:35:02,400
and could they put this land into

922
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,720
permanent conservation since they just

923
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:06,960
weren't going to be able to farm it

924
00:35:03,720 --> 00:35:08,940
anymore I mean this is uh part of this

925
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:11,040
area after repetitive flooding I mean

926
00:35:08,940 --> 00:35:14,220
it's just like sand dunes there's just

927
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:16,800
all sorts of material deposited all over

928
00:35:14,220 --> 00:35:18,960
the place and well that's not a wetland

929
00:35:16,800 --> 00:35:22,619
doesn't qualify for Wetland Conservation

930
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:25,740
programs so what else can they do so we

931
00:35:22,619 --> 00:35:28,680
started looking at floodplain easements

932
00:35:25,740 --> 00:35:30,180
um but the challenge is that there was

933
00:35:28,680 --> 00:35:32,400
no money in the floodplain easement

934
00:35:30,180 --> 00:35:34,500
program that was available for them so

935
00:35:32,400 --> 00:35:36,960
some Farmers started applying

936
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:39,920
um and we're told that there wasn't an

937
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:39,920
opportunity right then

938
00:35:40,020 --> 00:35:44,099
part of the challenge is that the way

939
00:35:42,540 --> 00:35:48,900
that this program operates as an

940
00:35:44,099 --> 00:35:50,700
emergency program is that funding is

941
00:35:48,900 --> 00:35:52,560
only appropriated and goes into the

942
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,780
program when there's sort of a major

943
00:35:52,560 --> 00:35:57,180
disaster declared so when there's like a

944
00:35:54,780 --> 00:35:59,280
Stafford act declaration if anybody's

945
00:35:57,180 --> 00:36:01,619
aware of how that works

946
00:35:59,280 --> 00:36:03,900
um and

947
00:36:01,619 --> 00:36:05,820
if there's no disaster declared there's

948
00:36:03,900 --> 00:36:07,619
no money put into the program so even if

949
00:36:05,820 --> 00:36:10,020
Farmers apply they're not going to be

950
00:36:07,619 --> 00:36:11,280
able to access the funding

951
00:36:10,020 --> 00:36:13,260
um when we looked at the Upper

952
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:15,000
Mississippi river States we found that

953
00:36:13,260 --> 00:36:19,020
over the last decade even though there

954
00:36:15,000 --> 00:36:21,540
was over 2500 agricultural disasters so

955
00:36:19,020 --> 00:36:25,320
in these rural areas there's flooding

956
00:36:21,540 --> 00:36:27,480
disasters only one time had there been a

957
00:36:25,320 --> 00:36:30,200
funding allocated to the floodplain

958
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:30,200
easement program

959
00:36:30,780 --> 00:36:33,420
when we looked a little deeper and I'm

960
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:35,820
going to throw a couple of different

961
00:36:33,420 --> 00:36:38,220
graphs at you but looked a little deeper

962
00:36:35,820 --> 00:36:39,420
at the data one of the things we saw was

963
00:36:38,220 --> 00:36:40,859
that

964
00:36:39,420 --> 00:36:43,800
um

965
00:36:40,859 --> 00:36:46,579
the enrollment of floodplain easements

966
00:36:43,800 --> 00:36:48,540
within this program over the years

967
00:36:46,579 --> 00:36:50,880
pretty low

968
00:36:48,540 --> 00:36:53,760
um so uh you know a couple of years

969
00:36:50,880 --> 00:36:56,420
where we had a funding allocated and a

970
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:59,220
decent number of floodplain easements

971
00:36:56,420 --> 00:37:01,339
enrolled for the most part I mean we're

972
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:03,300
looking at under 50 easements being

973
00:37:01,339 --> 00:37:06,740
implemented every year and this is

974
00:37:03,300 --> 00:37:06,740
across the country for these numbers

975
00:37:07,619 --> 00:37:11,820
when you compare that to the number of

976
00:37:09,660 --> 00:37:15,359
agricultural disasters that are declared

977
00:37:11,820 --> 00:37:17,400
in counties in agricultural areas it's a

978
00:37:15,359 --> 00:37:19,560
very small amount of easements that are

979
00:37:17,400 --> 00:37:21,599
available in these areas that are being

980
00:37:19,560 --> 00:37:24,380
flooded particularly ones that are

981
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:24,380
flooded regularly

982
00:37:25,020 --> 00:37:29,820
so one question that folks ask then is

983
00:37:27,900 --> 00:37:31,560
well if people aren't getting easements

984
00:37:29,820 --> 00:37:33,900
is it because there's not demand

985
00:37:31,560 --> 00:37:36,119
um and that's not accurate um there's

986
00:37:33,900 --> 00:37:37,500
definite demand when you look at the

987
00:37:36,119 --> 00:37:39,540
number of

988
00:37:37,500 --> 00:37:41,640
um Farmers that have applied to put

989
00:37:39,540 --> 00:37:43,020
their their land into a floodplain

990
00:37:41,640 --> 00:37:45,240
easements

991
00:37:43,020 --> 00:37:49,859
um there's a significant unmet demand

992
00:37:45,240 --> 00:37:52,500
and this doesn't just apply to the Upper

993
00:37:49,859 --> 00:37:54,660
Mississippi States if we've pulled some

994
00:37:52,500 --> 00:37:56,880
preliminary numbers from all states

995
00:37:54,660 --> 00:37:59,280
across the country and

996
00:37:56,880 --> 00:38:01,680
um these track that there's always a

997
00:37:59,280 --> 00:38:03,300
significant amount of applications and

998
00:38:01,680 --> 00:38:05,400
just not enough money and availability

999
00:38:03,300 --> 00:38:07,079
to go around so there are just

1000
00:38:05,400 --> 00:38:09,839
definitely a number of farmers around

1001
00:38:07,079 --> 00:38:11,700
the country who do

1002
00:38:09,839 --> 00:38:14,280
these are farmers who just don't want to

1003
00:38:11,700 --> 00:38:15,780
deal with their land flooding over and

1004
00:38:14,280 --> 00:38:18,180
over and over

1005
00:38:15,780 --> 00:38:20,220
um so it's we're talking about Farmers

1006
00:38:18,180 --> 00:38:22,800
that voluntarily want to put their land

1007
00:38:20,220 --> 00:38:25,020
into to a better use rather than just

1008
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:28,760
continue to farm and then get crop

1009
00:38:25,020 --> 00:38:28,760
insurance payouts every couple of years

1010
00:38:29,820 --> 00:38:33,060
um

1011
00:38:30,660 --> 00:38:34,859
can't see this one up here but um just a

1012
00:38:33,060 --> 00:38:37,160
couple of other things um points I

1013
00:38:34,859 --> 00:38:39,480
wanted to make is that flooding is

1014
00:38:37,160 --> 00:38:41,520
continuing to increase we all know this

1015
00:38:39,480 --> 00:38:43,920
giving more severe

1016
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:45,900
um and the cost associated with flooding

1017
00:38:43,920 --> 00:38:47,579
and repetitive flooding continue to

1018
00:38:45,900 --> 00:38:49,079
increase due to climate change I think

1019
00:38:47,579 --> 00:38:51,359
this is a point hopefully we're all well

1020
00:38:49,079 --> 00:38:53,160
aware of and when that happens that also

1021
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:56,180
means that our payouts for things like

1022
00:38:53,160 --> 00:38:58,619
crop insurance and that it's damages to

1023
00:38:56,180 --> 00:39:02,300
crops is going to continue to increase

1024
00:38:58,619 --> 00:39:02,300
as the years move on

1025
00:39:03,180 --> 00:39:09,060
um within the Upper Mississippi river

1026
00:39:05,579 --> 00:39:11,520
um we've seen that uh the producers are

1027
00:39:09,060 --> 00:39:14,460
particularly hit by flooding we're

1028
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:17,220
talking damages and and payouts in the

1029
00:39:14,460 --> 00:39:21,079
billions of dollars for many of our our

1030
00:39:17,220 --> 00:39:21,079
most heavily agricultural States

1031
00:39:21,720 --> 00:39:26,280
um and this then applies to the cost to

1032
00:39:24,119 --> 00:39:28,380
taxpayers Across the Nation

1033
00:39:26,280 --> 00:39:32,160
um in terms of how much is being paid

1034
00:39:28,380 --> 00:39:34,740
out in crop insurance and in the funding

1035
00:39:32,160 --> 00:39:38,119
for responding to floods and responding

1036
00:39:34,740 --> 00:39:38,119
to disasters every year

1037
00:39:38,520 --> 00:39:41,040
but when we're talking about the

1038
00:39:39,480 --> 00:39:43,140
floodplain easement program it's not

1039
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:45,660
just about cost although that's

1040
00:39:43,140 --> 00:39:46,740
certainly one reason to be interested in

1041
00:39:45,660 --> 00:39:48,720
this

1042
00:39:46,740 --> 00:39:50,760
um for American Rivers we are of course

1043
00:39:48,720 --> 00:39:52,740
interested in conserving and restoring

1044
00:39:50,760 --> 00:39:55,800
more natural flood Plains for those

1045
00:39:52,740 --> 00:39:58,619
benefits that can provide to society

1046
00:39:55,800 --> 00:40:01,859
so just a couple to touch on

1047
00:39:58,619 --> 00:40:05,160
um wetlands in particular are incredibly

1048
00:40:01,859 --> 00:40:08,820
effective at helping to store water

1049
00:40:05,160 --> 00:40:11,400
convey flood waters slow down how the

1050
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:12,780
water is moving through a watershed the

1051
00:40:11,400 --> 00:40:15,780
more Wetlands you have within a

1052
00:40:12,780 --> 00:40:17,760
watershed the slower your flood waters

1053
00:40:15,780 --> 00:40:20,160
will move Downstream and it will help

1054
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:23,220
reduce the damages to communities and to

1055
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:26,000
infrastructure Downstream

1056
00:40:23,220 --> 00:40:28,520
uh I mentioned nutrient pollution before

1057
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:31,380
many of our conservation

1058
00:40:28,520 --> 00:40:33,420
programs don't count floodplain

1059
00:40:31,380 --> 00:40:37,619
restoration as a best management

1060
00:40:33,420 --> 00:40:41,160
practice even though much of the um the

1061
00:40:37,619 --> 00:40:44,119
scientific literature demonstrates that

1062
00:40:41,160 --> 00:40:46,500
they do an incredible job at capturing

1063
00:40:44,119 --> 00:40:51,119
nitrogen and phosphorus and helping us

1064
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:52,560
reduce our or improve our water quality

1065
00:40:51,119 --> 00:40:54,780
um and these the orange ones up there is

1066
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:58,020
floodplain restoration compared to many

1067
00:40:54,780 --> 00:41:01,200
of the other best management practices

1068
00:40:58,020 --> 00:41:03,300
and then I mentioned before uh flood

1069
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,760
plains as being really key in helping

1070
00:41:03,300 --> 00:41:07,380
with biodiversity and restoring and

1071
00:41:05,760 --> 00:41:08,760
protecting some of our most vulnerable

1072
00:41:07,380 --> 00:41:09,599
species

1073
00:41:08,760 --> 00:41:11,640
um

1074
00:41:09,599 --> 00:41:13,680
I mentioned before that some of our our

1075
00:41:11,640 --> 00:41:15,720
species are really floodplain dependent

1076
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,599
when um there's some really amazing

1077
00:41:15,720 --> 00:41:20,820
research that's been done where

1078
00:41:17,599 --> 00:41:22,260
endangered many endangered fish send

1079
00:41:20,820 --> 00:41:24,300
their their

1080
00:41:22,260 --> 00:41:25,619
um spend part of their life on a

1081
00:41:24,300 --> 00:41:27,240
floodplain

1082
00:41:25,619 --> 00:41:29,339
um at Key times and that's really

1083
00:41:27,240 --> 00:41:30,599
important because it's slower water it's

1084
00:41:29,339 --> 00:41:32,520
much more

1085
00:41:30,599 --> 00:41:34,740
um there's more food there's much more

1086
00:41:32,520 --> 00:41:37,680
shelter and that can help them to grow

1087
00:41:34,740 --> 00:41:40,079
faster and Thrive and having access to

1088
00:41:37,680 --> 00:41:42,000
floodplains within our watersheds where

1089
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:44,579
we have a lot of endangered species can

1090
00:41:42,000 --> 00:41:48,480
be really important aspect to help with

1091
00:41:44,579 --> 00:41:49,859
that recovery of those different species

1092
00:41:48,480 --> 00:41:52,020
so one of the things that American

1093
00:41:49,859 --> 00:41:53,280
Rivers has been doing is talking with

1094
00:41:52,020 --> 00:41:56,040
different offices about the

1095
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,280
opportunities to try and enhance the use

1096
00:41:56,040 --> 00:42:01,400
of the floodplain easements program a

1097
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:04,619
couple of uh key

1098
00:42:01,400 --> 00:42:06,240
areas where we see an opportunity one is

1099
00:42:04,619 --> 00:42:08,820
to figure out how to get this program

1100
00:42:06,240 --> 00:42:12,079
funded on an annual basis so it's not

1101
00:42:08,820 --> 00:42:15,420
going to be just dependent on having

1102
00:42:12,079 --> 00:42:17,880
Congress allocate funding when there's a

1103
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,220
major disaster declared we need to get

1104
00:42:17,880 --> 00:42:23,760
money into this program annually so that

1105
00:42:20,220 --> 00:42:24,480
it's available when when Farmers need it

1106
00:42:23,760 --> 00:42:26,760
um

1107
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,520
second would be making sure that farmers

1108
00:42:26,760 --> 00:42:32,099
have an opportunity every year to enroll

1109
00:42:29,520 --> 00:42:36,300
um as we've seen these unmet um unmet

1110
00:42:32,099 --> 00:42:37,740
need and uh opportunity to have

1111
00:42:36,300 --> 00:42:40,740
um the farmers that need it in any

1112
00:42:37,740 --> 00:42:44,160
particular year be able to access and

1113
00:42:40,740 --> 00:42:45,839
apply can help us help them address

1114
00:42:44,160 --> 00:42:47,220
their needs of how they need to manage

1115
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,740
their land

1116
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:51,720
um and a third idea is uh to really be

1117
00:42:49,740 --> 00:42:54,119
able to focus on some of the most

1118
00:42:51,720 --> 00:42:55,440
repetitive flooded properties so the

1119
00:42:54,119 --> 00:42:58,020
ones that

1120
00:42:55,440 --> 00:43:00,599
um are are experiencing some of the most

1121
00:42:58,020 --> 00:43:03,180
repetitive payouts in crop insurance or

1122
00:43:00,599 --> 00:43:05,220
experiencing the most investment in

1123
00:43:03,180 --> 00:43:09,180
terms of Emergency Response funding

1124
00:43:05,220 --> 00:43:12,180
those are easy opportunities to be able

1125
00:43:09,180 --> 00:43:15,000
to adapt to climate change and ensure

1126
00:43:12,180 --> 00:43:17,220
that we are investing our funds

1127
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:19,680
appropriately while having an

1128
00:43:17,220 --> 00:43:21,660
opportunity to protect and restore the

1129
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:24,839
land around them so

1130
00:43:21,660 --> 00:43:26,940
um that is about it um I have uh our

1131
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,760
reports that we published on this we

1132
00:43:26,940 --> 00:43:31,920
have some copies out on the front desk

1133
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:34,099
and happy to take any questions thank

1134
00:43:31,920 --> 00:43:34,099
you

1135
00:43:35,819 --> 00:43:39,599
that was great I

1136
00:43:37,500 --> 00:43:40,980
we want it to stand up rather than sit

1137
00:43:39,599 --> 00:43:43,140
down and I'm glad I did because that

1138
00:43:40,980 --> 00:43:44,640
catfish photo I think if I had been

1139
00:43:43,140 --> 00:43:46,200
sitting in the front row I would have I

1140
00:43:44,640 --> 00:43:48,359
would have shrieked a little bit that's

1141
00:43:46,200 --> 00:43:50,220
a big catfish

1142
00:43:48,359 --> 00:43:51,780
um as a quick reminder

1143
00:43:50,220 --> 00:43:53,520
um we have some questions coming in from

1144
00:43:51,780 --> 00:43:54,839
our online audience so if you're in our

1145
00:43:53,520 --> 00:43:57,060
online audience and you have a question

you can send us an email the email

1147
00:43:57,060 --> 00:44:02,040
address to uses ask that's ask esi.org

1148
00:44:00,540 --> 00:44:03,780
and of course for folks in the room

1149
00:44:02,040 --> 00:44:05,280
we'll have them we'll be able to take

1150
00:44:03,780 --> 00:44:06,119
questions after our fourth panelists

1151
00:44:05,280 --> 00:44:08,640
today

1152
00:44:06,119 --> 00:44:11,880
our third panelist however is Paula

1153
00:44:08,640 --> 00:44:13,680
Yvette Bonita Carrero uh she's with us

1154
00:44:11,880 --> 00:44:16,319
today on behalf of the Hispanic access

1155
00:44:13,680 --> 00:44:18,359
foundation's Latino climate Council and

1156
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,700
she's a licensed agronomist with a focus

1157
00:44:18,359 --> 00:44:22,920
in animal behavior and Welfare she

1158
00:44:20,700 --> 00:44:25,260
explores the socioeconomic limitations

1159
00:44:22,920 --> 00:44:26,760
to achieving food security and how those

1160
00:44:25,260 --> 00:44:28,560
issues can be addressed through

1161
00:44:26,760 --> 00:44:30,720
Community engagement agriculture

1162
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:32,040
extension programs and education thank

1163
00:44:30,720 --> 00:44:35,119
you so much for joining us today I'm

1164
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:35,119
looking forward to your presentation

1165
00:44:36,599 --> 00:44:41,060
hello to all and thank you for being

1166
00:44:38,819 --> 00:44:43,680
here today my name is

1167
00:44:41,060 --> 00:44:45,839
I mentioned I'm an agronomist an animal

1168
00:44:43,680 --> 00:44:48,660
scientist and an educator from our

1169
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,640
Puerto Rico my areas of Interest are

1170
00:44:48,660 --> 00:44:53,220
integrating social Equity food

1171
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,680
accessibility and creating agriculture

1172
00:44:53,220 --> 00:44:57,359
engagement and extension by creating

1173
00:44:55,680 --> 00:44:59,040
better connection with the farmers and

1174
00:44:57,359 --> 00:45:02,339
producers and the communities they serve

1175
00:44:59,040 --> 00:45:04,560
I have wait let me let me put my

1176
00:45:02,339 --> 00:45:05,280
presentation real quick

1177
00:45:04,560 --> 00:45:08,880
um

1178
00:45:05,280 --> 00:45:10,920
perfect awesome so I have been a part of

1179
00:45:08,880 --> 00:45:13,020
Academia and I have also engaged in

1180
00:45:10,920 --> 00:45:15,359
public policy but most importantly I've

1181
00:45:13,020 --> 00:45:18,119
been part I've been working in the field

1182
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,400
as an agronomist both in areas of the

1183
00:45:18,119 --> 00:45:23,220
DMV and in Puerto Rico and something

1184
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:25,800
that I realized in both situations is

1185
00:45:23,220 --> 00:45:28,380
that there is a clear gap between the

1186
00:45:25,800 --> 00:45:30,780
efforts that Academia and public policy

1187
00:45:28,380 --> 00:45:32,760
do towards the Improvement of

1188
00:45:30,780 --> 00:45:35,160
Agriculture versus how that is

1189
00:45:32,760 --> 00:45:37,619
translated into the producers and the

1190
00:45:35,160 --> 00:45:40,020
farmers it is crucial to reduce these

1191
00:45:37,619 --> 00:45:42,000
gaps because and visibilize the issues

1192
00:45:40,020 --> 00:45:43,680
that these producers and Farmers point

1193
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:45,660
forward because at the end of the day

1194
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,520
thanks to them we have food in our table

1195
00:45:45,660 --> 00:45:50,240
so that's what I'm going to be talking

1196
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:53,579
about today I'm going to be focusing on

1197
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:55,760
Productions and pharmacological products

1198
00:45:53,579 --> 00:45:57,839
in Puerto Rico and how they have

1199
00:45:55,760 --> 00:46:00,599
implemented conservation practices

1200
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,460
before I begin I want to thank all the

1201
00:46:00,599 --> 00:46:04,560
farmers and producers who took the time

1202
00:46:02,460 --> 00:46:07,099
to have these conversations with me as

1203
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:09,780
well as team member of the USDA

1204
00:46:07,099 --> 00:46:11,700
Caribbean climate Hub and The Institute

1205
00:46:09,780 --> 00:46:13,560
of agricology thanks to them I have this

1206
00:46:11,700 --> 00:46:16,560
presentation

1207
00:46:13,560 --> 00:46:18,540
so there is no clear definition of

1208
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,940
agroecology but rather a set of

1209
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:22,220
disciplines and knowledge that and how

1210
00:46:20,940 --> 00:46:25,619
they're integrated

1211
00:46:22,220 --> 00:46:28,140
agroecology takes ecological concepts

1212
00:46:25,619 --> 00:46:31,440
and applies them into farming it is a

1213
00:46:28,140 --> 00:46:34,859
global movement that emphasizes

1214
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:36,960
um ancestral and Campesino knowledge and

1215
00:46:34,859 --> 00:46:38,400
it's honored and applied and it breaks

1216
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:40,680
away from the industrialized

1217
00:46:38,400 --> 00:46:42,800
industrialized Paradigm where there's a

1218
00:46:40,680 --> 00:46:45,900
hierarchy of who are the experts are

1219
00:46:42,800 --> 00:46:47,700
it's basically a multifactorial approach

1220
00:46:45,900 --> 00:46:49,020
an inclusive approach to the way we

1221
00:46:47,700 --> 00:46:50,640
produce food

1222
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:53,760
agroecology

1223
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:56,460
and it's in prioritizes long-term

1224
00:46:53,760 --> 00:46:59,520
economic viability by ensuring that all

1225
00:46:56,460 --> 00:47:01,380
parts of the economic production of food

1226
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:03,599
is considered whether it's marketing

1227
00:47:01,380 --> 00:47:06,000
technology distribution and

1228
00:47:03,599 --> 00:47:09,480
accessibility it also prioritizes

1229
00:47:06,000 --> 00:47:11,520
conservation by protecting and

1230
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:15,300
regeneration regenerating our natural

1231
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,640
resources it looks for Technical and and

1232
00:47:15,300 --> 00:47:19,319
Technical

1233
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:22,500
ways to use our energy more practically

1234
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:25,920
and also it tries to stem away from

1235
00:47:22,500 --> 00:47:28,500
external inputs agroecology all the and

1236
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:30,599
centers around social Equity because it

1237
00:47:28,500 --> 00:47:33,960
promotes dignified salaries for the

1238
00:47:30,599 --> 00:47:36,000
workers It Centers an uplift previously

1239
00:47:33,960 --> 00:47:37,740
marginalized communities like black

1240
00:47:36,000 --> 00:47:40,020
indigenous people of color who are

1241
00:47:37,740 --> 00:47:41,700
farmers and producers and aims towards

1242
00:47:40,020 --> 00:47:44,220
food sovereignty which is not the same

1243
00:47:41,700 --> 00:47:45,660
as food security food sovereignty is a

1244
00:47:44,220 --> 00:47:48,540
fundamental right for everybody

1245
00:47:45,660 --> 00:47:50,940
everybody to have accurate adequate

1246
00:47:48,540 --> 00:47:53,160
culturally appropriate affordable and

1247
00:47:50,940 --> 00:47:55,260
healthy food and It Centers the people

1248
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:58,800
as the decision makers for their

1249
00:47:55,260 --> 00:48:01,859
agricultural systems and their food

1250
00:47:58,800 --> 00:48:04,260
I'm sorry I move a lot so I'm gonna try

1251
00:48:01,859 --> 00:48:05,880
to work on that so

1252
00:48:04,260 --> 00:48:08,460
there are multiple conservation

1253
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:10,380
practices I cannot name all of them so

1254
00:48:08,460 --> 00:48:11,400
I'm going to focus on the ones that the

1255
00:48:10,380 --> 00:48:14,760
Farms that I will be talking about

1256
00:48:11,400 --> 00:48:17,099
focuses so agroecology mimics natural

1257
00:48:14,760 --> 00:48:19,560
ecosystem and that way they have more

1258
00:48:17,099 --> 00:48:22,500
resilient and diverse systems they

1259
00:48:19,560 --> 00:48:25,920
diversify the crops and by adding local

1260
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:28,500
native plants and cover crops which

1261
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:30,599
usually are deep rooted perennials that

1262
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:33,119
provide structure integrity and

1263
00:48:30,599 --> 00:48:36,660
nutrients to the soil by diversifying

1264
00:48:33,119 --> 00:48:39,119
these crops they build stronger

1265
00:48:36,660 --> 00:48:40,800
um lands that the differentiate from

1266
00:48:39,119 --> 00:48:42,960
monocropping the things that we usually

1267
00:48:40,800 --> 00:48:45,060
see in industrial Agriculture and

1268
00:48:42,960 --> 00:48:47,460
monocropping make plans

1269
00:48:45,060 --> 00:48:49,500
vulnerable and more dependent on

1270
00:48:47,460 --> 00:48:52,200
external inputs like herbicides

1271
00:48:49,500 --> 00:48:55,380
plagocytes and synthetic fertilizer

1272
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:58,319
contrast to Industrial agriculture

1273
00:48:55,380 --> 00:49:01,200
agroecology uses organic matter as a

1274
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:02,940
natural fertilizer of the soil adequate

1275
00:49:01,200 --> 00:49:06,540
water management is crucial for

1276
00:49:02,940 --> 00:49:09,359
agroecology as we are facing a very real

1277
00:49:06,540 --> 00:49:12,240
Water Crisis it focuses on reducing

1278
00:49:09,359 --> 00:49:14,280
Water waste reducing soil erosion and

1279
00:49:12,240 --> 00:49:16,800
also preparing the land for inclement

1280
00:49:14,280 --> 00:49:18,900
weathers like mentioned before of floods

1281
00:49:16,800 --> 00:49:21,000
and droughts and lastly the

1282
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:23,940
reintegration of livestock is crucial

1283
00:49:21,000 --> 00:49:26,700
for agroecology given that we do need to

1284
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:30,980
follow the thought of more crops less

1285
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:30,980
land more outputs less land

1286
00:49:31,319 --> 00:49:35,880
so now I'm going to take the opportunity

1287
00:49:33,359 --> 00:49:37,319
and talk and highlight some of the

1288
00:49:35,880 --> 00:49:38,940
projects that are happening in Puerto

1289
00:49:37,319 --> 00:49:41,099
Rico

1290
00:49:38,940 --> 00:49:43,319
these projects are usually small scale

1291
00:49:41,099 --> 00:49:44,819
and family products so I want to point

1292
00:49:43,319 --> 00:49:47,400
that out as well

1293
00:49:44,819 --> 00:49:49,440
so I am working with this this farm

1294
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:52,020
right now it's called Finca El Simon and

1295
00:49:49,440 --> 00:49:54,540
lares is a family operated farm that

1296
00:49:52,020 --> 00:49:56,700
practices sustainable agriculture by

1297
00:49:54,540 --> 00:49:59,880
integrating animal husbandry and

1298
00:49:56,700 --> 00:50:02,640
vegetable farming their main purpose and

1299
00:49:59,880 --> 00:50:05,040
focus is the reintegration of livestock

1300
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:07,740
particularly this native cattle breed

1301
00:50:05,040 --> 00:50:09,660
called the India criolla this breed is

1302
00:50:07,740 --> 00:50:12,240
adapted to the tropical climate but is

1303
00:50:09,660 --> 00:50:14,099
also a dual purpose breed where the

1304
00:50:12,240 --> 00:50:16,500
catalysts used for milk which they

1305
00:50:14,099 --> 00:50:18,900
produce cheese and merchandise it as

1306
00:50:16,500 --> 00:50:20,940
well as the oxen is used for plowing or

1307
00:50:18,900 --> 00:50:23,640
tillage of the land this is much more

1308
00:50:20,940 --> 00:50:26,040
less aggressive than heavy machinery is

1309
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,960
cost effective and The Oxen are

1310
00:50:26,040 --> 00:50:29,339
fertilizing the soil with their manure

1311
00:50:27,960 --> 00:50:33,359
as they walk

1312
00:50:29,339 --> 00:50:36,300
so other than this cattle breed they

1313
00:50:33,359 --> 00:50:39,359
also integrate a variety of crops they

1314
00:50:36,300 --> 00:50:41,760
do Grace rotations to the Landis and

1315
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:45,420
saturate they do conscious tree clearing

1316
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:47,760
for to promote native trees and practice

1317
00:50:45,420 --> 00:50:50,579
silver pasture they also have other

1318
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:53,460
types of husbandry like cattle like

1319
00:50:50,579 --> 00:50:55,980
goats chickens and turkeys and they're

1320
00:50:53,460 --> 00:50:57,839
also part of the making of compost which

1321
00:50:55,980 --> 00:51:00,000
then they in fact use from crop

1322
00:50:57,839 --> 00:51:02,940
harvesting so it's a cyclical practice

1323
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:06,119
that they do and their mission is to

1324
00:51:02,940 --> 00:51:08,280
protect this cattle breed promote the

1325
00:51:06,119 --> 00:51:10,500
oxen plowing which is a cultural

1326
00:51:08,280 --> 00:51:13,619
practice that has been lost and stem

1327
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:15,960
away from heavy machinery use

1328
00:51:13,619 --> 00:51:17,819
this other Farm is called fin kaplanito

1329
00:51:15,960 --> 00:51:20,220
in Las Marias it's a non-profit

1330
00:51:17,819 --> 00:51:22,680
educational project they have multiple

1331
00:51:20,220 --> 00:51:24,900
conservation practices from permaculture

1332
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:27,059
to bioconstruction but they have a

1333
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:28,680
really smart water management system

1334
00:51:27,059 --> 00:51:30,660
because they're in the mountainous area

1335
00:51:28,680 --> 00:51:33,240
and we know that mountainous area when

1336
00:51:30,660 --> 00:51:36,599
there's heavy rainfall water falls with

1337
00:51:33,240 --> 00:51:39,660
a lot of energy so they follow the soil

1338
00:51:36,599 --> 00:51:42,300
and embarmed approach as well as counter

1339
00:51:39,660 --> 00:51:45,119
farming oswail is basically a grassline

1340
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:47,640
depression that allows the water to pass

1341
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,740
through and dissipates this energy and

1342
00:51:47,640 --> 00:51:53,640
it prevents runoff when the when there's

1343
00:51:49,740 --> 00:51:55,920
Heavy Rain the barns are land Earth

1344
00:51:53,640 --> 00:51:57,480
walls that are close to the ditch and

1345
00:51:55,920 --> 00:51:59,460
they're in charge of retaining that

1346
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:02,339
water and allowing to infiltrate the

1347
00:51:59,460 --> 00:52:04,619
soil this in addition to Contour farming

1348
00:52:02,339 --> 00:52:06,780
which is basically preparing terrorists

1349
00:52:04,619 --> 00:52:08,880
or plowing the land in a way that

1350
00:52:06,780 --> 00:52:11,760
follows the natural landscape and and

1351
00:52:08,880 --> 00:52:13,319
slopes this reduces erosion it makes it

1352
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:16,440
easier to work in the land because your

1353
00:52:13,319 --> 00:52:18,359
fall playing the the landscape and

1354
00:52:16,440 --> 00:52:20,760
integrated is a passive Water Management

1355
00:52:18,359 --> 00:52:22,619
tool that should be implemented in many

1356
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:25,579
other places that have the issue with

1357
00:52:22,619 --> 00:52:25,579
droughts and flooding

1358
00:52:25,800 --> 00:52:30,300
so now I'm going to mention other Farms

1359
00:52:28,200 --> 00:52:32,880
that are specifically benefiting from

1360
00:52:30,300 --> 00:52:35,880
the USDA conservation programs

1361
00:52:32,880 --> 00:52:38,339
so this Las thinkas in Rio Grande is a

1362
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:40,980
woman-owned agribusin status focused on

1363
00:52:38,339 --> 00:52:42,720
the the racing of cattle for meat when

1364
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:45,960
they first acquire their land it wasn't

1365
00:52:42,720 --> 00:52:48,540
prepared for agriculture but thank you

1366
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:50,940
thankfully to the USDA nrca conservation

1367
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:52,619
program they have had the opportunity to

1368
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:55,020
begin the efforts to reach their goals

1369
00:52:52,619 --> 00:52:56,640
some of the things this is some of them

1370
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,099
they have they received a couple of them

1371
00:52:56,640 --> 00:53:01,680
but one of them some of them was the

1372
00:52:59,099 --> 00:53:03,900
tree shop site propagation program that

1373
00:53:01,680 --> 00:53:05,819
allowed them to start planting trees to

1374
00:53:03,900 --> 00:53:06,960
create shade and reduce heat stress in

1375
00:53:05,819 --> 00:53:09,420
animals

1376
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:13,339
prescribed Grayson which basically is

1377
00:53:09,420 --> 00:53:16,440
harvesting and maintaining healthy

1378
00:53:13,339 --> 00:53:18,720
pastures while maintaining soil healthy

1379
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:20,700
soils and you do that while having

1380
00:53:18,720 --> 00:53:23,640
grazing animals

1381
00:53:20,700 --> 00:53:25,740
forage and biomass planting to improve

1382
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:28,559
pasture quality the pasture that they

1383
00:53:25,740 --> 00:53:30,420
had had low possibility palatability and

1384
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,940
low nutritional value so they're trying

1385
00:53:30,420 --> 00:53:35,460
to create Nate to add native pastures

1386
00:53:32,940 --> 00:53:37,980
that are better for the animals

1387
00:53:35,460 --> 00:53:40,260
their beef fruit the fruit beef

1388
00:53:37,980 --> 00:53:42,420
production is a niche market in Puerto

1389
00:53:40,260 --> 00:53:44,819
Rico and they Center it in the

1390
00:53:42,420 --> 00:53:48,119
protection of Natural Resources

1391
00:53:44,819 --> 00:53:50,099
and focusing on animal well-being and

1392
00:53:48,119 --> 00:53:52,020
creating good Quality Meats so it's

1393
00:53:50,099 --> 00:53:54,300
important to promote

1394
00:53:52,020 --> 00:53:57,000
um conscious agroecological animal

1395
00:53:54,300 --> 00:53:59,160
production not only Crop Production

1396
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:03,319
because we need to eat right

1397
00:53:59,160 --> 00:54:03,319
so the last one I want to talk about is

1398
00:54:04,940 --> 00:54:10,440
there are pioneers in Puerto Rico for

1399
00:54:07,319 --> 00:54:13,200
agroecological farming and education

1400
00:54:10,440 --> 00:54:15,960
they basically do all the practices that

1401
00:54:13,200 --> 00:54:18,240
I mentioned before but most importantly

1402
00:54:15,960 --> 00:54:21,420
they have been classified as primer

1403
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,339
Farmland by the nrcs program due to its

1404
00:54:21,420 --> 00:54:26,520
soils with high fertility and excellent

1405
00:54:23,339 --> 00:54:27,720
agroecological output less than five

1406
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,720
percent of the world have

1407
00:54:27,720 --> 00:54:32,339
disclosification and I have to remind

1408
00:54:30,720 --> 00:54:34,500
you how small

1409
00:54:32,339 --> 00:54:36,480
Puerto Rico is so that's really

1410
00:54:34,500 --> 00:54:39,900
impressive so the conservation and

1411
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:42,240
protection of this soil is crucial they

1412
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:45,240
also produce over 21

1413
00:54:42,240 --> 00:54:48,000
000 pounds of food in 2021 in just a

1414
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:51,359
three acre land so they service prove

1415
00:54:48,000 --> 00:54:53,520
that sustainable agroecology can fit

1416
00:54:51,359 --> 00:54:55,559
communities and it's done in a really

1417
00:54:53,520 --> 00:54:56,520
small space so the opportunities are

1418
00:54:55,559 --> 00:54:58,640
endless

1419
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:00,839
they also offer a

1420
00:54:58,640 --> 00:55:03,599
agricological promoter course which I'm

1421
00:55:00,839 --> 00:55:05,760
taking right now which is an intensive

1422
00:55:03,599 --> 00:55:07,920
theoretical and practical course that

1423
00:55:05,760 --> 00:55:09,780
teaches all audience how to start a

1424
00:55:07,920 --> 00:55:12,839
vegetable garden from scratch

1425
00:55:09,780 --> 00:55:14,819
the principles of agroecology and the

1426
00:55:12,839 --> 00:55:17,220
students work in different farms around

1427
00:55:14,819 --> 00:55:19,380
the area I feel that this type of

1428
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:21,660
courses should be implemented worldwide

1429
00:55:19,380 --> 00:55:23,760
whether you want to have a project or

1430
00:55:21,660 --> 00:55:26,520
not because there is an urgency to shift

1431
00:55:23,760 --> 00:55:28,800
our agriculture production and people

1432
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:31,260
Everybody Eats the more people are aware

1433
00:55:28,800 --> 00:55:32,220
of our situation the larger scope we can

1434
00:55:31,260 --> 00:55:34,500
impact

1435
00:55:32,220 --> 00:55:36,660
they've also benefited from nrcs

1436
00:55:34,500 --> 00:55:39,000
conservation program although their Farm

1437
00:55:36,660 --> 00:55:41,040
as you can see is open we do have

1438
00:55:39,000 --> 00:55:42,900
variations in weather in Puerto Rico we

1439
00:55:41,040 --> 00:55:45,660
have an intense dry season and intense

1440
00:55:42,900 --> 00:55:48,300
rainy season a rainy season

1441
00:55:45,660 --> 00:55:50,700
is hard to produce we have incidents of

1442
00:55:48,300 --> 00:55:52,680
mold and plaques and it just is hard to

1443
00:55:50,700 --> 00:55:54,660
maintain so thanks to the high tonal

1444
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,059
initiative they were able to create a

1445
00:55:54,660 --> 00:55:59,220
shaded structure with a waterproof roof

1446
00:55:57,059 --> 00:56:01,079
that allow for stabilities in the crops

1447
00:55:59,220 --> 00:56:03,599
and allowed for them to be able to

1448
00:56:01,079 --> 00:56:05,640
produce even more types of crops that

1449
00:56:03,599 --> 00:56:07,160
are that do not depend on the actual

1450
00:56:05,640 --> 00:56:10,680
season while still practicing

1451
00:56:07,160 --> 00:56:13,079
agroecological practices

1452
00:56:10,680 --> 00:56:14,579
so like everything there are challenges

1453
00:56:13,079 --> 00:56:16,559
I'm first going to talk about the

1454
00:56:14,579 --> 00:56:18,420
challenges in Puerto Rico and then talk

1455
00:56:16,559 --> 00:56:20,460
about challenges in general

1456
00:56:18,420 --> 00:56:23,220
so we are currently going through a land

1457
00:56:20,460 --> 00:56:25,800
access and land tenure crisis like Sam

1458
00:56:23,220 --> 00:56:28,500
mentioned it is gentrification and

1459
00:56:25,800 --> 00:56:30,300
displacement have spiked the prices of

1460
00:56:28,500 --> 00:56:33,180
land making it really inaccessible for

1461
00:56:30,300 --> 00:56:35,160
the Puerto Rican sunlit in the island it

1462
00:56:33,180 --> 00:56:39,000
is not feasible for everybody to put out

1463
00:56:35,160 --> 00:56:41,640
a loan to buy a land because of a farm

1464
00:56:39,000 --> 00:56:43,559
is a high risk investment so people are

1465
00:56:41,640 --> 00:56:46,859
struggling to have tenure because it's

1466
00:56:43,559 --> 00:56:48,059
not really feasible to to rent a land

1467
00:56:46,859 --> 00:56:51,000
that you're not promised that you're

1468
00:56:48,059 --> 00:56:52,980
gonna save your rewards also entries

1469
00:56:51,000 --> 00:56:54,900
like the land of authorities don't

1470
00:56:52,980 --> 00:56:57,540
really have an accurate census of the

1471
00:56:54,900 --> 00:56:59,220
available land so and Bureau credit

1472
00:56:57,540 --> 00:57:01,740
limitations really makes the process

1473
00:56:59,220 --> 00:57:03,300
even more arduous and tedious secondly

1474
00:57:01,740 --> 00:57:05,160
and while we've been struggling for

1475
00:57:03,300 --> 00:57:07,559
centuries are austerity measures like

1476
00:57:05,160 --> 00:57:09,839
the Jones act it really limits the scope

1477
00:57:07,559 --> 00:57:12,599
from which producers can compete at the

1478
00:57:09,839 --> 00:57:15,480
market when we have second class lower

1479
00:57:12,599 --> 00:57:17,460
quality imported food in the supermarket

1480
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:20,099
that will not ever be able to compete

1481
00:57:17,460 --> 00:57:22,460
with good quality organic produce that

1482
00:57:20,099 --> 00:57:25,140
are the formal agriculturists are doing

1483
00:57:22,460 --> 00:57:27,960
also it really limits and inhibits their

1484
00:57:25,140 --> 00:57:31,020
opportunity to export their goods

1485
00:57:27,960 --> 00:57:33,420
other issues are we need to increase the

1486
00:57:31,020 --> 00:57:36,000
public policy to protect Farmers from

1487
00:57:33,420 --> 00:57:39,240
inclement weather and natural disasters

1488
00:57:36,000 --> 00:57:41,040
we need to update our curriculum in

1489
00:57:39,240 --> 00:57:42,839
universities that are specialized in

1490
00:57:41,040 --> 00:57:44,520
agriculture so we can have degrees that

1491
00:57:42,839 --> 00:57:47,280
are specific for regeneratory

1492
00:57:44,520 --> 00:57:48,720
agriculture social economy social

1493
00:57:47,280 --> 00:57:50,819
economic disparities and

1494
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:53,400
inaccessibilities have made processed

1495
00:57:50,819 --> 00:57:55,260
food more common than fresh food so

1496
00:57:53,400 --> 00:57:57,780
that's another issue that we face as

1497
00:57:55,260 --> 00:58:00,119
well that the as the dwindling practice

1498
00:57:57,780 --> 00:58:02,160
of eating seasonally

1499
00:58:00,119 --> 00:58:05,880
and lastly and the reason why we're here

1500
00:58:02,160 --> 00:58:08,880
we need to expand how much the reach of

1501
00:58:05,880 --> 00:58:11,579
Agriculture farmers and and incentivize

1502
00:58:08,880 --> 00:58:13,859
them for the conservation practices

1503
00:58:11,579 --> 00:58:16,440
and this is because conservation Farm

1504
00:58:13,859 --> 00:58:18,960
practices involve many types of people

1505
00:58:16,440 --> 00:58:20,880
and needs there is a need for Technical

1506
00:58:18,960 --> 00:58:22,440
and educational assistance performance

1507
00:58:20,880 --> 00:58:25,859
because not everybody has access to

1508
00:58:22,440 --> 00:58:27,599
computer social media not everybody and

1509
00:58:25,859 --> 00:58:29,520
we shouldn't focus on the people that

1510
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:31,440
have that access to be able to implement

1511
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:35,220
this is where agriculture extension

1512
00:58:31,440 --> 00:58:38,040
comes into place we have to focus our

1513
00:58:35,220 --> 00:58:39,000
we need to focus on small-scale Regional

1514
00:58:38,040 --> 00:58:41,760
production

1515
00:58:39,000 --> 00:58:43,680
and to conclude intensive and

1516
00:58:41,760 --> 00:58:46,200
conventional agriculture that we've seen

1517
00:58:43,680 --> 00:58:48,720
for the last 60 years is not a viable

1518
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,160
production of food it has proven that

1519
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:51,960
it's not capable of feeding our

1520
00:58:50,160 --> 00:58:54,180
communities and has caused irreparable

1521
00:58:51,960 --> 00:58:55,980
damage to our ecosystem now more than

1522
00:58:54,180 --> 00:58:58,140
ever we need to uplift the communities

1523
00:58:55,980 --> 00:58:59,520
and the farmers that are doing our

1524
00:58:58,140 --> 00:59:02,400
feeding our communities are working

1525
00:58:59,520 --> 00:59:03,799
against food insecurity and food deserts

1526
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:06,059
wow

1527
00:59:03,799 --> 00:59:09,180
regenerating regenerating our natural

1528
00:59:06,059 --> 00:59:11,520
resources agroecology is not an idea it

1529
00:59:09,180 --> 00:59:13,260
is not a concept it is an applicable and

1530
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:15,240
effective practice that could protect

1531
00:59:13,260 --> 00:59:17,300
our natural resources and feed our world

1532
00:59:15,240 --> 00:59:21,960

um be asked any question that you think

1608
01:02:32,880 --> 01:02:38,819
may not be politically correct or an

1609
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:41,460
uncomfortable it does seem like

1610
01:02:38,819 --> 01:02:43,859
sometimes as tribal people we're still

1611
01:02:41,460 --> 01:02:46,200
held under a glass

1612
01:02:43,859 --> 01:02:49,680
um that there's that um I'm still to

1613
01:02:46,200 --> 01:02:52,460
this day get the question of you know uh

1614
01:02:49,680 --> 01:02:55,380
that we don't exist so I'm really

1615
01:02:52,460 --> 01:02:58,020
thankful and honored to be here as well

1616
01:02:55,380 --> 01:03:00,180
as I'm sure if you were here when Dwayne

1617
01:02:58,020 --> 01:03:01,980
Sherman was giving his presentation he

1618
01:03:00,180 --> 01:03:04,579
definitely stole the show

1619
01:03:01,980 --> 01:03:07,200
so honorable strategies as a company

1620
01:03:04,579 --> 01:03:09,059
organization that helps tribes and

1621
01:03:07,200 --> 01:03:10,619
outside organizations with tribal

1622
01:03:09,059 --> 01:03:14,460
engagement

1623
01:03:10,619 --> 01:03:16,920
we um if you see here on the on the

1624
01:03:14,460 --> 01:03:19,400
screen or maybe it's not their own

1625
01:03:16,920 --> 01:03:19,400
that's it

1626
01:03:19,619 --> 01:03:23,880
so I I just wanted to share a little bit

1627
01:03:22,260 --> 01:03:27,059
about these photos

1628
01:03:23,880 --> 01:03:28,619
um that's actually a young girl from the

1629
01:03:27,059 --> 01:03:31,799
um Pine Ridge Indian Reservation that's

1630
01:03:28,619 --> 01:03:35,700
where horse she's an amazing horse

1631
01:03:31,799 --> 01:03:37,440
um her horsemanship is amazing but um

1632
01:03:35,700 --> 01:03:39,420
you know

1633
01:03:37,440 --> 01:03:41,760
they obviously struggle with a lot of

1634
01:03:39,420 --> 01:03:44,400
issues and they are huge Farmers but

1635
01:03:41,760 --> 01:03:47,220
they deal with a lot of water issues

1636
01:03:44,400 --> 01:03:50,640
um the picture of the basket is

1637
01:03:47,220 --> 01:03:52,680
um a basket of the Whirlwind and it's in

1638
01:03:50,640 --> 01:03:55,920
regards to perpetual motion

1639
01:03:52,680 --> 01:03:58,859
and that our people believe in and when

1640
01:03:55,920 --> 01:04:00,599
it comes to our gathering rights um we

1641
01:03:58,859 --> 01:04:02,880
have still difficulties to the to this

1642
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:04,760
day so I wanted to be able to show you

1643
01:04:02,880 --> 01:04:07,680
just a little bit about us as a people

1644
01:04:04,760 --> 01:04:10,559
I'm going to

1645
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:12,839
stay pretty close to my time I think and

1646
01:04:10,559 --> 01:04:15,059
and just FYI

1647
01:04:12,839 --> 01:04:16,740
being on Tribal Council

1648
01:04:15,059 --> 01:04:20,280
and I'm sure this is a way for you guys

1649
01:04:16,740 --> 01:04:21,599
as well we're always insured or when we

1650
01:04:20,280 --> 01:04:25,020
provide a presentation or someone

1651
01:04:21,599 --> 01:04:28,200
provides a presentation to us uh

1652
01:04:25,020 --> 01:04:29,520
it's direct here's the information

1653
01:04:28,200 --> 01:04:31,260
um although I'm a little jealous because

1654
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:32,640
there are some really great pictures I

1655
01:04:31,260 --> 01:04:35,339
was like man I should add more pictures

1656
01:04:32,640 --> 01:04:37,020
but I did not I'm just really I'm

1657
01:04:35,339 --> 01:04:39,420
actually stepping back a little bit

1658
01:04:37,020 --> 01:04:41,520
OnePlus strategies also we are the

1659
01:04:39,420 --> 01:04:43,799
ambassadors of

1660
01:04:41,520 --> 01:04:46,500
um the nation of Hawaii the nation of

1661
01:04:43,799 --> 01:04:48,839
Hawaii is that who I'm out of Oahu

1662
01:04:46,500 --> 01:04:51,839
Ottawa Manolo obviously there's a lot of

1663
01:04:48,839 --> 01:04:53,839
people for the nation of Hawaii but this

1664
01:04:51,839 --> 01:04:57,180
specific group is responsible for

1665
01:04:53,839 --> 01:04:59,160
re-establishing the rapuno and they are

1666
01:04:57,180 --> 01:05:00,660
total Sovereign so if you want more

1667
01:04:59,160 --> 01:05:04,079
information on that I can share that as

1668
01:05:00,660 --> 01:05:07,079
well so what I wanted to do was kind to

1669
01:05:04,079 --> 01:05:09,140
kind of take you back because I always

1670
01:05:07,079 --> 01:05:13,440
want to make sure that people understand

1671
01:05:09,140 --> 01:05:14,940
the beginning in order for you to learn

1672
01:05:13,440 --> 01:05:16,079
um how to walk you had to start at the

1673
01:05:14,940 --> 01:05:17,520
beginning

1674
01:05:16,079 --> 01:05:18,480
in order to learn you how to start at

1675
01:05:17,520 --> 01:05:21,420
the beginning

1676
01:05:18,480 --> 01:05:24,240
so that's extremely important for me

1677
01:05:21,420 --> 01:05:26,819
and it is amazing that a lot of people

1678
01:05:24,240 --> 01:05:28,619
in regards to when they talk about

1679
01:05:26,819 --> 01:05:30,420
manifest destiny

1680
01:05:28,619 --> 01:05:34,200
that's actually one of the first things

1681
01:05:30,420 --> 01:05:36,180
that we as tribal people learn

1682
01:05:34,200 --> 01:05:37,980
um about Manifest Destiny not too many

1683
01:05:36,180 --> 01:05:39,900
people really understand the definition

1684
01:05:37,980 --> 01:05:42,420
to that

1685
01:05:39,900 --> 01:05:44,400
um my young daughter my son and my

1686
01:05:42,420 --> 01:05:46,500
nieces and nephews understand manifest

1687
01:05:44,400 --> 01:05:48,359
destiny

1688
01:05:46,500 --> 01:05:50,760
um and I won't go into the definitions

1689
01:05:48,359 --> 01:05:51,299
and and please if you guys get a chance

1690
01:05:50,760 --> 01:05:54,599
um

1691
01:05:51,299 --> 01:05:56,880
you'll really grasp a concept

1692
01:05:54,599 --> 01:05:58,920
about our tribal people if you

1693
01:05:56,880 --> 01:06:02,640
understand the different arrows that had

1694
01:05:58,920 --> 01:06:04,680
gone through and um in this is I'm going

1695
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,940
to tie it into the farm bill and

1696
01:06:04,680 --> 01:06:08,940
conservation

1697
01:06:05,940 --> 01:06:10,619
so quickly after Manifest Destiny

1698
01:06:08,940 --> 01:06:12,119
there's Discovery and Conquest treaty

1699
01:06:10,619 --> 01:06:13,740
making you know I don't have to read

1700
01:06:12,119 --> 01:06:16,680
them to you but the removal and

1701
01:06:13,740 --> 01:06:19,559
relocation act that has a really huge

1702
01:06:16,680 --> 01:06:22,500
effect on us in regards to

1703
01:06:19,559 --> 01:06:24,660
um taking action Regard in in farming

1704
01:06:22,500 --> 01:06:26,579
because when you remove a people from a

1705
01:06:24,660 --> 01:06:30,559
land and then you put them on a smaller

1706
01:06:26,579 --> 01:06:35,579
one they then have to create another way

1707
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:39,299
to address or their feed their families

1708
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:41,880
and then we have a cultural tie we have

1709
01:06:39,299 --> 01:06:46,140
a cultural tied to the land

1710
01:06:41,880 --> 01:06:48,119
the land that we sit on is tells a

1711
01:06:46,140 --> 01:06:51,059
creation story of the people that were

1712
01:06:48,119 --> 01:06:53,880
here this was their beginning place

1713
01:06:51,059 --> 01:06:57,240
and so there's there's a large

1714
01:06:53,880 --> 01:06:59,760
uh and there's a disconnect so for

1715
01:06:57,240 --> 01:07:02,280
allotment and assimilation

1716
01:06:59,760 --> 01:07:05,339
that was uh again at a difficult time

1717
01:07:02,280 --> 01:07:07,799
for us to try to re-engage back into

1718
01:07:05,339 --> 01:07:10,559
um into farming into agriculture into

1719
01:07:07,799 --> 01:07:12,619
supplying for our life and and for our

1720
01:07:10,559 --> 01:07:15,720
people the regular

1721
01:07:12,619 --> 01:07:18,240
reorganization act and self-government

1722
01:07:15,720 --> 01:07:20,700
uh was an opportunity for us to be able

1723
01:07:18,240 --> 01:07:22,559
to re-establish who we are although it

1724
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,660
didn't really

1725
01:07:22,559 --> 01:07:26,760
um happen that way and then you suffered

1726
01:07:24,660 --> 01:07:29,280
the termination act the termination act

1727
01:07:26,760 --> 01:07:31,380
where there were tribes where they were

1728
01:07:29,280 --> 01:07:33,839
just no longer in existence

1729
01:07:31,380 --> 01:07:36,539
the United States government said

1730
01:07:33,839 --> 01:07:39,299
you're no longer a people

1731
01:07:36,539 --> 01:07:41,579
and um so that was devastating

1732
01:07:39,299 --> 01:07:43,799
and then we came obviously to the

1733
01:07:41,579 --> 01:07:45,720
self-determination act and um that is

1734
01:07:43,799 --> 01:07:47,579
actually to the present time

1735
01:07:45,720 --> 01:07:50,220
so again I'm you know I'm not going to

1736
01:07:47,579 --> 01:07:52,740
go into details to them but when we talk

1737
01:07:50,220 --> 01:07:56,400
about the federal responsibility and the

1738
01:07:52,740 --> 01:07:59,160
power of Indian Affairs we as tribes

1739
01:07:56,400 --> 01:08:02,220
and I'm sure many of you everything how

1740
01:07:59,160 --> 01:08:04,079
many of you met with tribal leaders or

1741
01:08:02,220 --> 01:08:08,099
tribal staff

1742
01:08:04,079 --> 01:08:09,480
not too many of them so although tribal

1743
01:08:08,099 --> 01:08:11,160
leadership doesn't want to meet with

1744
01:08:09,480 --> 01:08:12,780
staffers they want to meet with you know

1745
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:14,700
the representatives but I think it's

1746
01:08:12,780 --> 01:08:17,100
extremely important that you do engage

1747
01:08:14,700 --> 01:08:19,380
it's extremely important for you to

1748
01:08:17,100 --> 01:08:22,319
engage with what is happening with the

1749
01:08:19,380 --> 01:08:24,239
tribes so

1750
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,920
the federal government has a fiduciary

1751
01:08:24,239 --> 01:08:29,279
responsibility

1752
01:08:25,920 --> 01:08:31,080
to address tribes and you know I don't

1753
01:08:29,279 --> 01:08:36,199
need to go into detail what you guys

1754
01:08:31,080 --> 01:08:36,199
know about us as tribes but so um

1755
01:08:36,239 --> 01:08:42,179
the next page is I wanted to give you

1756
01:08:39,060 --> 01:08:42,960
guys a little bit of insight on on

1757
01:08:42,179 --> 01:08:46,560
um

1758
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:49,319
our phases or just phases of Engagement

1759
01:08:46,560 --> 01:08:50,900
sorry go on here here it is these are my

1760
01:08:49,319 --> 01:08:52,440
notes

1761
01:08:50,900 --> 01:08:54,179
so

1762
01:08:52,440 --> 01:08:56,219
um

1763
01:08:54,179 --> 01:08:58,140
I think that's probably one of the the

1764
01:08:56,219 --> 01:09:00,199
hardest things for

1765
01:08:58,140 --> 01:09:03,490
the outside communities to understand

1766
01:09:00,199 --> 01:09:03,839
and this isn't our this is in regards to

1767
01:09:03,490 --> 01:09:04,620
[Music]

1768
01:09:03,839 --> 01:09:07,560
um

1769
01:09:04,620 --> 01:09:08,940
a process and and understanding the

1770
01:09:07,560 --> 01:09:11,580
tribe's needs

1771
01:09:08,940 --> 01:09:13,859
especially around now that there's a

1772
01:09:11,580 --> 01:09:15,179
there's a huge interest in in tribes and

1773
01:09:13,859 --> 01:09:18,179
conservation it's not just an interest

1774
01:09:15,179 --> 01:09:21,120
you have DOI stating that we as tribes

1775
01:09:18,179 --> 01:09:24,319
have a place and we need to be heard

1776
01:09:21,120 --> 01:09:24,319
so um

1777
01:09:24,600 --> 01:09:30,259
and and I don't know if any of you guys

1778
01:09:27,060 --> 01:09:34,500
know in here that there are over there's

1779
01:09:30,259 --> 01:09:36,359
574 tribes within the United States

1780
01:09:34,500 --> 01:09:37,799
um that doesn't mean that that includes

1781
01:09:36,359 --> 01:09:39,779
all of them obviously I'm not talking

1782
01:09:37,799 --> 01:09:41,640
about the ones that have been terminated

1783
01:09:39,779 --> 01:09:43,080
so there are some states that don't have

1784
01:09:41,640 --> 01:09:45,299
trials but that doesn't mean that that

1785
01:09:43,080 --> 01:09:47,460
was in tribal land at one time so when

1786
01:09:45,299 --> 01:09:49,920
you engage with tribes

1787
01:09:47,460 --> 01:09:50,880
um the phases of it or I call it phases

1788
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:53,100
but

1789
01:09:50,880 --> 01:09:56,640
you know tribes are

1790
01:09:53,100 --> 01:09:58,380
um tribes are key to the success success

1791
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,000
of conservation

1792
01:09:58,380 --> 01:10:03,060
and the efforts for the with the United

1793
01:10:00,000 --> 01:10:05,460
States is is trying to establish the

1794
01:10:03,060 --> 01:10:06,840
reason why is we

1795
01:10:05,460 --> 01:10:08,699
have

1796
01:10:06,840 --> 01:10:10,199
um we have we hold the knowledge and

1797
01:10:08,699 --> 01:10:12,179
it's not just the tribes here it's the

1798
01:10:10,199 --> 01:10:14,340
indigenous people but we hold the

1799
01:10:12,179 --> 01:10:16,820
knowledge of traditional ecological

1800
01:10:14,340 --> 01:10:16,820
knowledge

1801
01:10:16,920 --> 01:10:21,540
I've heard tribal leaders say well if

1802
01:10:19,679 --> 01:10:23,820
they would have listened to us

1803
01:10:21,540 --> 01:10:25,140
then that probably wouldn't happen right

1804
01:10:23,820 --> 01:10:28,020
the flooding probably wouldn't happen

1805
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:30,600
the burns probably wouldn't happen

1806
01:10:28,020 --> 01:10:34,080
um you know we would have had a lot more

1807
01:10:30,600 --> 01:10:35,699
to you know to sustain our our people

1808
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:37,260
and that's just not the people of the

1809
01:10:35,699 --> 01:10:39,300
reservation but that's the people of

1810
01:10:37,260 --> 01:10:40,860
this United States

1811
01:10:39,300 --> 01:10:44,159
so

1812
01:10:40,860 --> 01:10:46,260
um again these are just suggestions

1813
01:10:44,159 --> 01:10:48,719
and I said it earlier to initiate

1814
01:10:46,260 --> 01:10:52,380
conversation among small groups tribal

1815
01:10:48,719 --> 01:10:55,380
leaders tribal technical experts but I

1816
01:10:52,380 --> 01:10:56,940
can ensure that you understand that it

1817
01:10:55,380 --> 01:10:58,800
is extremely important to talk to the

1818
01:10:56,940 --> 01:11:01,860
right tribal person

1819
01:10:58,800 --> 01:11:03,239
do not assume that Binet is here

1820
01:11:01,860 --> 01:11:06,179
speaking for all of Indian country

1821
01:11:03,239 --> 01:11:08,460
because I in no way can do that

1822
01:11:06,179 --> 01:11:11,100
or am I even allowed to do that

1823
01:11:08,460 --> 01:11:12,719
so it's extremely important to find the

1824
01:11:11,100 --> 01:11:15,600
proper one and I know that's a little

1825
01:11:12,719 --> 01:11:16,380
difficult because our world is pretty

1826
01:11:15,600 --> 01:11:18,900
um

1827
01:11:16,380 --> 01:11:20,520
can get a little crazy but um you know

1828
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:22,739
you have people like myself and I know

1829
01:11:20,520 --> 01:11:24,420
you guys have talked to tribal people so

1830
01:11:22,739 --> 01:11:26,780
I'm really excited that they did mention

1831
01:11:24,420 --> 01:11:26,780
that

1832
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:34,260
and and when you go into the next phase

1833
01:11:29,940 --> 01:11:35,760
so the first phase of that is engagement

1834
01:11:34,260 --> 01:11:37,739
and hearing the stories of the people

1835
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:38,699
the second phase would be

1836
01:11:37,739 --> 01:11:40,560
um

1837
01:11:38,699 --> 01:11:43,500
again that were important to

1838
01:11:40,560 --> 01:11:44,880
conservation efforts into oh that's the

1839
01:11:43,500 --> 01:11:47,100
same thing isn't it but it's feedback

1840
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:48,060
right I'm sorry that's the same thing

1841
01:11:47,100 --> 01:11:50,400
I'm like

1842
01:11:48,060 --> 01:11:52,920
I think I copy and pasted the wrong

1843
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:55,140
things I apologize you guys but I don't

1844
01:11:52,920 --> 01:11:57,480
need that phase two is just comments and

1845
01:11:55,140 --> 01:11:59,699
feedback you want to be able to engage

1846
01:11:57,480 --> 01:12:02,760
with tribes to hear what their story is

1847
01:11:59,699 --> 01:12:03,900
you want to have them tell you their

1848
01:12:02,760 --> 01:12:05,340
issues

1849
01:12:03,900 --> 01:12:08,159
um how many of you in here know about

1850
01:12:05,340 --> 01:12:10,500
tribal water rights

1851
01:12:08,159 --> 01:12:12,960
it's huge that is going to be a game

1852
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:15,000
changer when it comes to the farm bill

1853
01:12:12,960 --> 01:12:17,699
in conservation

1854
01:12:15,000 --> 01:12:18,780
that that I would

1855
01:12:17,699 --> 01:12:21,239
um

1856
01:12:18,780 --> 01:12:23,159
do your do your studying on that because

1857
01:12:21,239 --> 01:12:25,199
it's extremely important and they're all

1858
01:12:23,159 --> 01:12:30,300
different for every every tribe

1859
01:12:25,199 --> 01:12:32,280
so um my tribe is was in a 45-year Water

1860
01:12:30,300 --> 01:12:35,280
lawsuit against the federal government

1861
01:12:32,280 --> 01:12:36,960
we there was five of us the Soboba tribe

1862
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:39,679
which is out in Southern California they

1863
01:12:36,960 --> 01:12:43,199
were in the 73-year

1864
01:12:39,679 --> 01:12:45,060
lawsuit which again

1865
01:12:43,199 --> 01:12:47,040
uh

1866
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:48,900
water rights is described that we as

1867
01:12:47,040 --> 01:12:51,360
tribes would have that but

1868
01:12:48,900 --> 01:12:54,120
it was obviously taken from us

1869
01:12:51,360 --> 01:12:56,880
so in regards to like step three and um

1870
01:12:54,120 --> 01:12:58,620
which is in the next next steps once you

1871
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:01,800
do engagement once you do conversation

1872
01:12:58,620 --> 01:13:04,620
once you hear the story and you build

1873
01:13:01,800 --> 01:13:06,600
um you maybe collaboratively build

1874
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:10,380
policy

1875
01:13:06,600 --> 01:13:11,699
but you also Implement what was what was

1876
01:13:10,380 --> 01:13:14,760
established

1877
01:13:11,699 --> 01:13:17,540
and um those are those are things that

1878
01:13:14,760 --> 01:13:21,179
I've seen in being extremely successful

1879
01:13:17,540 --> 01:13:23,880
in uh conservation efforts USDA I know

1880
01:13:21,179 --> 01:13:26,520
nrcs is everywhere and they're doing

1881
01:13:23,880 --> 01:13:30,600
some amazing jobs but again out of the

1882
01:13:26,520 --> 01:13:33,480
574 tribes maybe 20 of those tribes are

1883
01:13:30,600 --> 01:13:37,260
seeing those efforts and so again my

1884
01:13:33,480 --> 01:13:39,659
goal here today is to emphasize on uh

1885
01:13:37,260 --> 01:13:40,800
engagement emphasize in learning your

1886
01:13:39,659 --> 01:13:44,100
community

1887
01:13:40,800 --> 01:13:45,780
um and and understanding that you don't

1888
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:47,520
have

1889
01:13:45,780 --> 01:13:51,239
um you may not have all the answers or

1890
01:13:47,520 --> 01:13:53,880
you may not know who to go to but

1891
01:13:51,239 --> 01:13:56,239
I'd like to Simply say is there's 50

1892
01:13:53,880 --> 01:13:56,239
states

1893
01:13:57,000 --> 01:14:02,340
there's 50 governors

1894
01:13:59,940 --> 01:14:04,500
there's 574

1895
01:14:02,340 --> 01:14:07,080
tribes

1896
01:14:04,500 --> 01:14:07,980
pretty sure not all 574 tribes get to

1897
01:14:07,080 --> 01:14:09,540
talk to

1898
01:14:07,980 --> 01:14:11,400
whether it be the president or the

1899
01:14:09,540 --> 01:14:14,179
Congress or the Senate so

1900
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:18,239
it would be nice but I can understand

1901
01:14:14,179 --> 01:14:20,699
the difficulty of a program or a

1902
01:14:18,239 --> 01:14:22,980
representative in in wanting in needing

1903
01:14:20,699 --> 01:14:23,580
to talk to individuals

1904
01:14:22,980 --> 01:14:26,239
um

1905
01:14:23,580 --> 01:14:26,239
so

1906
01:14:27,420 --> 01:14:31,800
well wrong one sorry

1907
01:14:29,880 --> 01:14:35,940
um

1908
01:14:31,800 --> 01:14:38,520
so the in in the past probably three

1909
01:14:35,940 --> 01:14:40,679
years I've been doing a lot of work in

1910
01:14:38,520 --> 01:14:43,560
regards to national monuments

1911
01:14:40,679 --> 01:14:47,400
land conservations

1912
01:14:43,560 --> 01:14:50,520
um different efforts in in developing

1913
01:14:47,400 --> 01:14:52,260
policies around that even most recently

1914
01:14:50,520 --> 01:14:54,420
uh discussion at the National Congress

1915
01:14:52,260 --> 01:14:56,040
American Indians on the farm bill and

1916
01:14:54,420 --> 01:14:58,860
the need for water rights

1917
01:14:56,040 --> 01:15:00,719
but um this is something I wanted to

1918
01:14:58,860 --> 01:15:02,460
provide you guys kind of like as an

1919
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:04,620
Insight you know to learn the purpose

1920
01:15:02,460 --> 01:15:07,980
and the process of of public lands and

1921
01:15:04,620 --> 01:15:10,620
their efforts you know that's what

1922
01:15:07,980 --> 01:15:12,900
should be either conveyed to the tribes

1923
01:15:10,620 --> 01:15:15,360
or having an understanding of what the

1924
01:15:12,900 --> 01:15:17,760
tribes are how they're looking at it and

1925
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,500
then another part is to learn from one

1926
01:15:17,760 --> 01:15:21,719
another and learn from tribes what they

1927
01:15:19,500 --> 01:15:22,980
see as opportunities to collaborate on

1928
01:15:21,719 --> 01:15:24,540
protecting lands and other natural

1929
01:15:22,980 --> 01:15:30,000
resources that are important to the

1930
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:32,280
tribe and to ngos and USD USDA efforts

1931
01:15:30,000 --> 01:15:34,320
and advocacy groups and I mentioned that

1932
01:15:32,280 --> 01:15:35,460
because the

1933
01:15:34,320 --> 01:15:37,620
um

1934
01:15:35,460 --> 01:15:40,980
as just most recently

1935
01:15:37,620 --> 01:15:43,400
we when you talk about water rights and

1936
01:15:40,980 --> 01:15:46,140
then you talk about lack of access of

1937
01:15:43,400 --> 01:15:46,920
fishing or

1938
01:15:46,140 --> 01:15:51,300
um

1939
01:15:46,920 --> 01:15:53,460
or any any foods one of the things that

1940
01:15:51,300 --> 01:15:57,120
I think salmon brought it up

1941
01:15:53,460 --> 01:16:00,480
was oh no it was um Elaine Elaine is

1942
01:15:57,120 --> 01:16:03,120
like right Eileen excuse me was the

1943
01:16:00,480 --> 01:16:05,760
um was talking about

1944
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,080
flood Plains

1945
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:08,880
so

1946
01:16:07,080 --> 01:16:12,239
and this is again I'm just going to give

1947
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:14,219
you guys examples because it does affect

1948
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,719
all of us in different ways

1949
01:16:14,219 --> 01:16:18,239
the

1950
01:16:15,719 --> 01:16:20,040
live view to zero tribe was up in from

1951
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:24,420
upper Michigan

1952
01:16:20,040 --> 01:16:27,600
they are affected by the damning of some

1953
01:16:24,420 --> 01:16:28,679
of their lakes and they now lack wild

1954
01:16:27,600 --> 01:16:30,480
rice

1955
01:16:28,679 --> 01:16:31,500
which was a main source of food for

1956
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:35,580
their people

1957
01:16:31,500 --> 01:16:37,380
they now lack walleye the main source of

1958
01:16:35,580 --> 01:16:41,640
food for their people

1959
01:16:37,380 --> 01:16:44,520
and like every culture food

1960
01:16:41,640 --> 01:16:45,659
the land the animals ties in to our Our

1961
01:16:44,520 --> 01:16:48,719
Lives

1962
01:16:45,659 --> 01:16:51,960
they are also suffering from being shot

1963
01:16:48,719 --> 01:16:53,580
at by simply fishing

1964
01:16:51,960 --> 01:16:56,400
off of their

1965
01:16:53,580 --> 01:16:57,840
um their traditional lands it may not be

1966
01:16:56,400 --> 01:17:00,120
their land but

1967
01:16:57,840 --> 01:17:03,360
they have the rights and so they're

1968
01:17:00,120 --> 01:17:07,500
dealing with that in 2023

1969
01:17:03,360 --> 01:17:09,179
amazing but it you know what happens so

1970
01:17:07,500 --> 01:17:11,100
um extremely important to hear the

1971
01:17:09,179 --> 01:17:13,199
issues that you know tribes are dealing

1972
01:17:11,100 --> 01:17:14,699
with when it comes to

1973
01:17:13,199 --> 01:17:16,860
um

1974
01:17:14,699 --> 01:17:18,300
again the different the issues that are

1975
01:17:16,860 --> 01:17:19,920
happening

1976
01:17:18,300 --> 01:17:22,440
um so

1977
01:17:19,920 --> 01:17:24,179
to emphasize uh the next one is to

1978
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:25,320
emphasize on the significance of tribal

1979
01:17:24,179 --> 01:17:27,900
involvement going forward in

1980
01:17:25,320 --> 01:17:29,159
conservation efforts and to convey ways

1981
01:17:27,900 --> 01:17:31,380
tribes can be involved and stay

1982
01:17:29,159 --> 01:17:33,060
connected that's extremely important

1983
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:35,699
because

1984
01:17:33,060 --> 01:17:37,440
as tribes or

1985
01:17:35,699 --> 01:17:41,219
governing the rest of their people's

1986
01:17:37,440 --> 01:17:42,739
lives they now have to address this new

1987
01:17:41,219 --> 01:17:47,640
thing that's coming about

1988
01:17:42,739 --> 01:17:49,380
and um most of the tribes well not most

1989
01:17:47,640 --> 01:17:51,840
tribes you have level different levels

1990
01:17:49,380 --> 01:17:54,840
of tribes right not all tribes have

1991
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:57,300
this large budget or not all tribes have

1992
01:17:54,840 --> 01:18:01,980
this extensive structure of government

1993
01:17:57,300 --> 01:18:04,140
not all tribes have the technical

1994
01:18:01,980 --> 01:18:05,940
assistance or the funding you know to do

1995
01:18:04,140 --> 01:18:08,640
those type of things there are some

1996
01:18:05,940 --> 01:18:11,280
tribes that are only 12 members

1997
01:18:08,640 --> 01:18:12,540
there are some tribes that are 75 000

1998
01:18:11,280 --> 01:18:16,380
members

1999
01:18:12,540 --> 01:18:18,840
and and so it's it's it's there's

2000
01:18:16,380 --> 01:18:20,100
they're so diverse

2001
01:18:18,840 --> 01:18:21,300
so

2002
01:18:20,100 --> 01:18:23,340
um

2003
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:25,980
and again and one other thing I think

2004
01:18:23,340 --> 01:18:27,540
it's extremely important is you know

2005
01:18:25,980 --> 01:18:29,460
in strengthening tribal engagement

2006
01:18:27,540 --> 01:18:31,980
consultation and capacity building

2007
01:18:29,460 --> 01:18:34,320
implementation and process to ensure

2008
01:18:31,980 --> 01:18:36,179
that whether it be conservation efforts

2009
01:18:34,320 --> 01:18:37,980
or in regards to the farm bill as well

2010
01:18:36,179 --> 01:18:40,380
as efforts are responsive and engaging

2011
01:18:37,980 --> 01:18:43,380
with tribal communities engagement is

2012
01:18:40,380 --> 01:18:45,659
key so what should tribes expect to

2013
01:18:43,380 --> 01:18:47,760
engage with and this is not just with

2014
01:18:45,659 --> 01:18:50,100
NGO and conservationists but also UCA

2015
01:18:47,760 --> 01:18:52,739
communities

2016
01:18:50,100 --> 01:18:55,020
in groups is helping shape the planning

2017
01:18:52,739 --> 01:18:57,300
process and be used to develop the

2018
01:18:55,020 --> 01:19:00,320
management and develop management plans

2019
01:18:57,300 --> 01:19:04,500
for conservation efforts

2020
01:19:00,320 --> 01:19:06,540
tribes historically have been

2021
01:19:04,500 --> 01:19:08,880
have policies

2022
01:19:06,540 --> 01:19:11,340
in laws written form and then it's put

2023
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:13,500
in front of them and say here you go try

2024
01:19:11,340 --> 01:19:16,140
I wrote this for you now you have to

2025
01:19:13,500 --> 01:19:18,719
abide by it it is extremely important to

2026
01:19:16,140 --> 01:19:20,880
have the tribes at the table to be able

2027
01:19:18,719 --> 01:19:23,219
to develop those policies and it's a

2028
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:25,380
tribes will collaborate with others

2029
01:19:23,219 --> 01:19:27,420
because I obviously you guys are doing

2030
01:19:25,380 --> 01:19:29,699
it and we obviously need to talk because

2031
01:19:27,420 --> 01:19:32,360
I'm totally gonna send your name out to

2032
01:19:29,699 --> 01:19:32,360
everybody I know

2033
01:19:32,820 --> 01:19:37,500
um so it's extremely important because

2034
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:39,600
it you know talking to a lot of tribes

2035
01:19:37,500 --> 01:19:41,760
that I work with you know that's the

2036
01:19:39,600 --> 01:19:43,260
that's the last thing they want is not

2037
01:19:41,760 --> 01:19:44,760
to be involved in a policy that's

2038
01:19:43,260 --> 01:19:46,260
supposed to oversee

2039
01:19:44,760 --> 01:19:49,080
um any lands or traditional lands that

2040
01:19:46,260 --> 01:19:52,199
they're that they're addressing or

2041
01:19:49,080 --> 01:19:54,900
concerns and so and then one final thing

2042
01:19:52,199 --> 01:19:57,800
is

2043
01:19:54,900 --> 01:20:01,020
as we start to work on these

2044
01:19:57,800 --> 01:20:03,780
policies and plans

2045
01:20:01,020 --> 01:20:06,719
the burden or maybe it's a conservation

2046
01:20:03,780 --> 01:20:09,320
effort the burden now lays on the tribes

2047
01:20:06,719 --> 01:20:09,320
shoulders

2048
01:20:09,620 --> 01:20:16,739
where is the funding going to come from

2049
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:18,840
when the tribes are asked to even review

2050
01:20:16,739 --> 01:20:21,960
a document maybe they don't have legal

2051
01:20:18,840 --> 01:20:23,280
counsel to even do that so that is

2052
01:20:21,960 --> 01:20:24,840
something that has to be really

2053
01:20:23,280 --> 01:20:29,040
considered is

2054
01:20:24,840 --> 01:20:32,159
you may be expecting the tribe to

2055
01:20:29,040 --> 01:20:34,380
have a seat at the table but

2056
01:20:32,159 --> 01:20:36,300
where's the funding and the expectation

2057
01:20:34,380 --> 01:20:38,219
coming from

2058
01:20:36,300 --> 01:20:41,060
and

2059
01:20:38,219 --> 01:20:43,380
just the tribe have that capacity so

2060
01:20:41,060 --> 01:20:46,679
tribes need assistance in funding

2061
01:20:43,380 --> 01:20:49,739
technical assistance assistance training

2062
01:20:46,679 --> 01:20:52,679
and capacity building to address the

2063
01:20:49,739 --> 01:20:54,780
asks of either ngos conservations

2064
01:20:52,679 --> 01:20:58,140
um goals and efforts it's extremely

2065
01:20:54,780 --> 01:20:59,460
important I am I've asked a couple of

2066
01:20:58,140 --> 01:21:01,199
different people and told them that was

2067
01:20:59,460 --> 01:21:03,179
coming and the biggest thing they said

2068
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:05,580
is if you're going to talk to the

2069
01:21:03,179 --> 01:21:06,960
staffers ensure that they understand to

2070
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:09,239
carry the message

2071
01:21:06,960 --> 01:21:12,239
that

2072
01:21:09,239 --> 01:21:14,640
funding is extremely important

2073
01:21:12,239 --> 01:21:17,880
and capacity

2074
01:21:14,640 --> 01:21:19,739
and to understand the structure of the

2075
01:21:17,880 --> 01:21:22,440
individual tribe that you're working

2076
01:21:19,739 --> 01:21:24,600
with or the individual community

2077
01:21:22,440 --> 01:21:26,580
so

2078
01:21:24,600 --> 01:21:28,980
am I on time because you can cut me off

2079
01:21:26,580 --> 01:21:31,980
anytime

2080
01:21:28,980 --> 01:21:34,080
share this and

2081
01:21:31,980 --> 01:21:36,840
um

2082
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:37,860
so we were extremely honored when

2083
01:21:36,840 --> 01:21:40,500
um

2084
01:21:37,860 --> 01:21:42,420
representative Deb Holland

2085
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:44,179
um and secretary I'm sorry secretary Deb

2086
01:21:42,420 --> 01:21:47,400
Holland was

2087
01:21:44,179 --> 01:21:50,520
placed at the Bureau of Indian Affairs

2088
01:21:47,400 --> 01:21:53,040
so the comment that she says

2089
01:21:50,520 --> 01:21:55,320
is

2090
01:21:53,040 --> 01:21:57,780
our community our communities deserve

2091
01:21:55,320 --> 01:22:01,080
fresh air to breathe clean water to

2092
01:21:57,780 --> 01:22:03,320
drink and and a livable planet but right

2093
01:22:01,080 --> 01:22:03,320
now

2094
01:22:03,420 --> 01:22:09,360
in action on climate change is putting

2095
01:22:06,600 --> 01:22:12,560
everything at risk particularly in

2096
01:22:09,360 --> 01:22:12,560
communities of color

2097
01:22:13,380 --> 01:22:17,699
and so I saw that and I thought you know

2098
01:22:15,420 --> 01:22:18,600
you can't help but repeat that several

2099
01:22:17,699 --> 01:22:23,580
times

2100
01:22:18,600 --> 01:22:25,800
the the the the uh below the the couple

2101
01:22:23,580 --> 01:22:26,780
paragraphs that I put in there are

2102
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:29,699
actually

2103
01:22:26,780 --> 01:22:31,260
statements from the chairman of the Fort

2104
01:22:29,699 --> 01:22:33,960
Mohave tribe

2105
01:22:31,260 --> 01:22:36,480
chairman Tim Williams they most recently

2106
01:22:33,960 --> 01:22:37,880
were able to establish

2107
01:22:36,480 --> 01:22:39,960
um evict

2108
01:22:37,880 --> 01:22:40,640
which is

2109
01:22:39,960 --> 01:22:43,380
um

2110
01:22:40,640 --> 01:22:45,659
uh for their people what was their

2111
01:22:43,380 --> 01:22:47,460
beginning place and it was an it was an

2112
01:22:45,659 --> 01:22:50,760
amazing opportunity

2113
01:22:47,460 --> 01:22:52,080
to help preserve the land so

2114
01:22:50,760 --> 01:22:55,440
um just really quickly these are just

2115
01:22:52,080 --> 01:22:58,500
examples of USDA I know I'm getting shut

2116
01:22:55,440 --> 01:23:02,040
cut for a time here and then

2117
01:22:58,500 --> 01:23:04,260
um a couple others there's the Ute the

2118
01:23:02,040 --> 01:23:06,659
Cheyenne

2119
01:23:04,260 --> 01:23:08,400
um Cheyenne River and then that's my

2120
01:23:06,659 --> 01:23:11,880
name but

2121
01:23:08,400 --> 01:23:13,739
I just wanted to add really fast I tried

2122
01:23:11,880 --> 01:23:16,580
to when I thought about the 12 minutes I

2123
01:23:13,739 --> 01:23:16,580
was like holy crap

2124
01:23:16,800 --> 01:23:21,719
um

2125
01:23:17,840 --> 01:23:24,179
but in regards to the insurance

2126
01:23:21,719 --> 01:23:25,920
one of the things that I wanted to make

2127
01:23:24,179 --> 01:23:28,500
sure that people understand is that when

2128
01:23:25,920 --> 01:23:29,520
it comes to tribal land we sometimes

2129
01:23:28,500 --> 01:23:32,480
can't

2130
01:23:29,520 --> 01:23:35,219
have house insurance or flood insurance

2131
01:23:32,480 --> 01:23:36,420
because of the way that our land is

2132
01:23:35,219 --> 01:23:40,020
established

2133
01:23:36,420 --> 01:23:42,600
so when I ex when I share the importance

2134
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:45,420
of really understanding the tribes it

2135
01:23:42,600 --> 01:23:48,620
really is important to understand each

2136
01:23:45,420 --> 01:23:52,380
tribe and its individual capacity

2137
01:23:48,620 --> 01:23:54,600
because it's we don't have the luxuries

2138
01:23:52,380 --> 01:23:56,400
you know not all of us are you know um

2139
01:23:54,600 --> 01:23:58,440
you know at that point but again there

2140
01:23:56,400 --> 01:24:00,780
are a majority of us that can't afford

2141
01:23:58,440 --> 01:24:02,900
that so

2142
01:24:00,780 --> 01:24:07,650
so that's my name uh that's my company

2143
01:24:02,900 --> 01:24:13,960
and I'm I hope I helped out

2144
01:24:07,650 --> 01:24:13,960
[Applause]

2145
01:24:16,980 --> 01:24:22,140
read all the time American Indian

2146
01:24:18,960 --> 01:24:25,040
American Justice it's by blind delorea

2147
01:24:22,140 --> 01:24:25,040
he writes a lot of

2148
01:24:28,920 --> 01:24:32,640
all right

2149
01:24:30,420 --> 01:24:34,080
um we have maybe time for one or two

2150
01:24:32,640 --> 01:24:36,000
quick questions from the audience if

2151
01:24:34,080 --> 01:24:39,719
there is one I'm not sure if there is

2152
01:24:36,000 --> 01:24:42,000
but we are at time unfortunately

2153
01:24:39,719 --> 01:24:43,380
um I think since maybe since it's been a

2154
01:24:42,000 --> 01:24:46,140
little while since we've heard Samantha

2155
01:24:43,380 --> 01:24:48,060
and Eileen uh especially since you were

2156
01:24:46,140 --> 01:24:50,100
our first two panelists let's wrap up

2157
01:24:48,060 --> 01:24:52,440
with a quick lightning round

2158
01:24:50,100 --> 01:24:53,520
um question before we end for the

2159
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,960
afternoon and that lightning round

2160
01:24:53,520 --> 01:24:56,820
question is

2161
01:24:54,960 --> 01:24:59,100
we've covered a lot of ground today

2162
01:24:56,820 --> 01:25:00,540
I suspect there are lots of things we

2163
01:24:59,100 --> 01:25:02,820
could suggest to improve when it comes

2164
01:25:00,540 --> 01:25:04,679
to conservation programs but

2165
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:06,560
you could change one thing

2166
01:25:04,679 --> 01:25:09,239
with existing programs to promote

2167
01:25:06,560 --> 01:25:11,219
conservation what would that one thing

2168
01:25:09,239 --> 01:25:13,199
be Samantha we'll start with you and

2169
01:25:11,219 --> 01:25:14,280
then we'll go down the line and I'm

2170
01:25:13,199 --> 01:25:16,400
really interested in what you have to

2171
01:25:14,280 --> 01:25:16,400
say

2172
01:25:16,500 --> 01:25:21,780
can y'all hear me great

2173
01:25:19,440 --> 01:25:25,500
thanks again for all the time today

2174
01:25:21,780 --> 01:25:27,960
thank you for to ESI for having us I

2175
01:25:25,500 --> 01:25:29,420
would say especially after hearing my

2176
01:25:27,960 --> 01:25:31,800
colleagues speak

2177
01:25:29,420 --> 01:25:34,679
there's a lot of information in the

2178
01:25:31,800 --> 01:25:36,420
white paper hope you all grab a copy

2179
01:25:34,679 --> 01:25:40,020
read it but

2180
01:25:36,420 --> 01:25:41,280
our proposal to support farmer to Farmer

2181
01:25:40,020 --> 01:25:44,340
learning

2182
01:25:41,280 --> 01:25:48,239
seems most relevant especially to be

2183
01:25:44,340 --> 01:25:50,360
moving outside of the sort of existing

2184
01:25:48,239 --> 01:25:53,340
technical assistance really

2185
01:25:50,360 --> 01:25:55,800
science-based strategies and to provide

2186
01:25:53,340 --> 01:25:58,020
some capacity building for communities

2187
01:25:55,800 --> 01:26:01,560
that are historically marginalized from

2188
01:25:58,020 --> 01:26:03,980
accessing those programs so I would say

2189
01:26:01,560 --> 01:26:06,540
building up more farmer to Farmer

2190
01:26:03,980 --> 01:26:08,940
engagement and learning providing

2191
01:26:06,540 --> 01:26:10,440
funding for those purposes and capacity

2192
01:26:08,940 --> 01:26:12,679
building that would be my number one

2193
01:26:10,440 --> 01:26:12,679
thing

2194
01:26:14,880 --> 01:26:18,480
um I think we can there's probably a

2195
01:26:17,100 --> 01:26:21,360
million different suggestions we could

2196
01:26:18,480 --> 01:26:23,580
make about how to make all these

2197
01:26:21,360 --> 01:26:26,880
programs easier to work with and things

2198
01:26:23,580 --> 01:26:30,239
like increased sustainable funding

2199
01:26:26,880 --> 01:26:32,580
um but for for me and um for American

2200
01:26:30,239 --> 01:26:36,420
Rivers I think one of the the

2201
01:26:32,580 --> 01:26:38,219
key changes that we would love to see

2202
01:26:36,420 --> 01:26:42,600
within many of the conservation programs

2203
01:26:38,219 --> 01:26:45,900
within nrcs is to align them to be to

2204
01:26:42,600 --> 01:26:48,659
work with rivers and recognize Rivers as

2205
01:26:45,900 --> 01:26:50,400
a dynamic part of our ecosystem and that

2206
01:26:48,659 --> 01:26:52,739
land around them the flood Plains and

2207
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:55,920
the riparian areas as being really

2208
01:26:52,739 --> 01:26:57,840
critical to the health of our society

2209
01:26:55,920 --> 01:27:00,179
and our clean water

2210
01:26:57,840 --> 01:27:01,620
um so doing things like enhancing the

2211
01:27:00,179 --> 01:27:04,020
floodplain easement program and

2212
01:27:01,620 --> 01:27:05,940
improving that and making sure that all

2213
01:27:04,020 --> 01:27:07,620
of our other conservation programs work

2214
01:27:05,940 --> 01:27:11,040
with the rivers and help to protect and

2215
01:27:07,620 --> 01:27:13,340
restore them as valuable ecosystems that

2216
01:27:11,040 --> 01:27:13,340
they are

2217
01:27:15,960 --> 01:27:21,960
hello okay so

2218
01:27:19,380 --> 01:27:24,060
um I want to mention because of the

2219
01:27:21,960 --> 01:27:26,159
gentrification and displacement that I

2220
01:27:24,060 --> 01:27:28,139
mentioned before this is usually caused

2221
01:27:26,159 --> 01:27:30,420
by Americans coming from the United

2222
01:27:28,139 --> 01:27:32,460
States as well as the Jones act that was

2223
01:27:30,420 --> 01:27:36,900
imposed by our Colonial

2224
01:27:32,460 --> 01:27:39,120
impose well Colonial status so I feel

2225
01:27:36,900 --> 01:27:41,880
like conservation programs should

2226
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:44,520
prioritize on create a type of senses

2227
01:27:41,880 --> 01:27:46,440
that prioritizes farmers that are from

2228
01:27:44,520 --> 01:27:48,360
Puerto Rico living in Puerto Rico as a

2229
01:27:46,440 --> 01:27:51,360
type of preparation because we are a

2230
01:27:48,360 --> 01:27:53,340
little bit behind than other farmers in

2231
01:27:51,360 --> 01:27:54,840
the U.S because we have struggles we

2232
01:27:53,340 --> 01:27:57,179
have to go like through a couple of

2233
01:27:54,840 --> 01:27:59,280
struggles before we get to even knowing

2234
01:27:57,179 --> 01:28:01,380
about this conservation programs so

2235
01:27:59,280 --> 01:28:03,480
create an accurate senses of who because

2236
01:28:01,380 --> 01:28:04,860
basically if I am from an American that

2237
01:28:03,480 --> 01:28:07,260
moves to Puerto Rico and creates an

2238
01:28:04,860 --> 01:28:09,600
irocological project I can benefit from

2239
01:28:07,260 --> 01:28:11,280
a USDA conservation program just like a

2240
01:28:09,600 --> 01:28:14,159
humble family from the middle from a

2241
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:16,260
rural part of the country so creating

2242
01:28:14,159 --> 01:28:18,780
that reparation and that

2243
01:28:16,260 --> 01:28:20,960
type of responsibility towards the

2244
01:28:18,780 --> 01:28:23,760
people that have been

2245
01:28:20,960 --> 01:28:27,360
basically marginalized in these programs

2246
01:28:23,760 --> 01:28:30,060
is important and also understanding that

2247
01:28:27,360 --> 01:28:33,000
is equity and not equality when it comes

2248
01:28:30,060 --> 01:28:34,920
to Puerto Rico in relations to us

2249
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:36,719
Benet you put a lot of things on the

2250
01:28:34,920 --> 01:28:39,420
table that we could euphemistically call

2251
01:28:36,719 --> 01:28:40,920
opportunities for improvement uh but

2252
01:28:39,420 --> 01:28:42,659
like to give you the last word of our

2253
01:28:40,920 --> 01:28:45,239
briefing today

2254
01:28:42,659 --> 01:28:47,400
thank you I would

2255
01:28:45,239 --> 01:28:50,280
um ask that

2256
01:28:47,400 --> 01:28:53,540
it take a Grassroots effect with in

2257
01:28:50,280 --> 01:28:56,940
conservation effort because

2258
01:28:53,540 --> 01:28:59,820
of what it creates which is opportunity

2259
01:28:56,940 --> 01:29:03,540
equity and

2260
01:28:59,820 --> 01:29:06,840
growth but it also causes a riff

2261
01:29:03,540 --> 01:29:09,000
and so you have large farmers who are

2262
01:29:06,840 --> 01:29:11,820
looking at it in a different way and

2263
01:29:09,000 --> 01:29:13,980
it's affecting their their bottom line

2264
01:29:11,820 --> 01:29:17,340
but there has to be an understanding so

2265
01:29:13,980 --> 01:29:19,800
I would ask for that holistic approach

2266
01:29:17,340 --> 01:29:21,120
to be a main point

2267
01:29:19,800 --> 01:29:23,280
thank you very much

2268
01:29:21,120 --> 01:29:24,840
um we had a tremendous panel today I

2269
01:29:23,280 --> 01:29:28,040
think our panelists deserve a round of

2270
01:29:24,840 --> 01:29:28,040
applause for their contribution

2271
01:29:29,840 --> 01:29:34,500
