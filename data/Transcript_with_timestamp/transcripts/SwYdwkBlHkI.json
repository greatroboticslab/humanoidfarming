  "text": "things I wanted to talk about today are how to get started in homesteading and self-sufficiency you can't really just jump in and expect things to work it just it does not work that way and so I wanted to do this series kind of like some tips how I got started not only in a home setting and self-sufficiency there's some light but basically how to become debt-free and about six years it's taken me you know could take you longer it could take you shorter but when I started I had a plan and that plan is what is crucial and let me kind of back you up to the beginning and hopefully that'll help you so I bought property a house with some land with the intentions of eventually a home setting and becoming self-sufficient and also becoming debt-free and when I bought the land it was never a homestead before is actually a vacation home the guy toonder for 20 years it's on a lake and basically they come out and spend weekend or two a year and for the most time it was not lived in and they mowed the grass and that's really about all they really ever did and actually according to some of the neighbors they didn't really weather grass that I wasn't either but doesn't either here nor there so things that I think are crucial to allowing me to get to where I'm at in such a quick manner or that first when I bought the house I did not do anything at all for the first year and that wasn't intentional because I wanted to walk the property and keeping a high on what was in bloom and what I was seeing for the first year because it changes as the seasons change you know everything else changes also and I was trying to also put together an idea like where I wanted to have a chicken coop where I wanted to have goats and where I was going to put rabbits and where the garden was going to be at and you know all these things and my original plans had to change because during that first year I found like nut trees that had I just acted on a whim and did what I wanted to do from the start without taking that year break and paying attention I would have cut down nut trees that are a natural source of you know food I would have cut down wild blueberries and blackberries that are also a source of food you know I probably get a gallon or more of blueberries and blackberries from the wild plants not counting what I've planted myself in the nuts and there were some fruit trees three different mulberry trees that you know had I had I done my plan originally without knowing they were there I probably would have cut them down because they just look like trees that weren't on very well and also I found two plums up close to the mailbox that really look like they were dead until till that first spring when they come to life and I was like oh it's something growing on there and as time went on I realized it was a plum natural wild plum tree and I Mary come pump so anyways that's what I did I took one year and I didn't do anything I just observed observed the property I would take walks at least once a week sometimes almost every day I would just take a walk and I take a piece of paper and I kind of like sketched out the property and when I find places I would mark it on my paper and literally it got to be so much that I started taking a GPS and dropping waypoints B just so that I could find hey there were nuts on the ground here where's the nut yeah you know go back and look go back and find the nut tree and you know that kind of helped a lot and I'm glad I did that because it totally changed my original layout of the property and it allowed me to plan where to put the rabbit hutch without destroying any natural food or where to put the chicken coop or where to put the goats or you know where to put the garden where to put the orchard all that stuff once I knew what was here naturally that was edible then I could plan around that without destroying it all right so that's the first tip live on your land for a year and observe it through all the seasons that's the first tip the second tip I want to talk about is have a game plan and basically what I did was I kind of knew what I wanted and I'm just like everybody else I'm kind of impatient at times and I want everything yesterday but homesteading is expensive so you need to have a plan in a budget for homesteading I'll get it you know where all this is gonna talk about that but there's gonna be more things too so I started with a spreadsheet and I started with simple stuff like where am I gonna put the garden I thought the garden was pretty important right off the bat that was one of the first things I did and then right after that was chickens and really knowing what I know now I probably would have went with rabbits next instead of the chickens but no matter to kind of touch on why that happened though is pound for pound when you look at the cost to raise rabbits and the food they eat before they're ready to harvest is much less so than what it is for a chicken so chickens you got to have like six months before they even start laying eggs where rabbits you know you can harvest them after a few weeks after they're born they don't really eat a lot as much or you know not as much as chickens they're easier to maintain and pound-for-pound the rabbits beat chickens every time and I'm still firm believer and act five or six years now on the homestead I'm a firm believer that I probably you know doing it over again I would have got rabbits but for I got chickens all right so having a plan what I did was I created a spreadsheet and I put down goals for each year and then I estimated what each one of those goals would cost me to do and I'm gonna tell you right now homesteading is not cheap like unless you bought an existing home set if you're starting from like I did a your home setting from scratch which means there wasn't a chicken coop on the property there wasn't goat barns there wasn't rabbit hutches none that stuff so you're starting from scratch let me give you some figures and these aren't exactly you know if you want the exact figures I'll tell you these are just estimates what I know to be true it cost me about twenty four hundred dollars for me to build my chicken coop and run by myself that's what it cost me in materials and you know time was you know quite a bit of tongue it was it was actually spread out over a month because it rained almost every day that month so I would get an hour to you know more work done every day over a month but you know if if I was going to build it and have a really good solid weather week probably would have taken me four or five maybe six days to build it the rabbit hutch cost me about three hundred dollars to build so another reason why I would have started with rabbits way cheaper to get started the rabbit hutch is way cheaper to build than a chicken coop is and and they produce more faster so that's another reason why I would I serve the rabbits the goats the goat is surprising how much its cost I've got two of the three sections of the goat barn done and the goat the fencing the goat barn that I've got done already the fencing and the goats have cost me almost eight thousand dollars now eight thousand dollars five goats you know so although that's expensive I think the rabbits so the rabbit hutch you know 300 dollars and in the rabbits I paid about a hundred dollars for three rabbits give or take so I had $400 in the rabbits and the the first chickens that I got the chicken coop and run cost me $2,400 I didn't pay anything for the chickens so you're looking at $400 vs. $2,400 plus I had to feed them chickens for six months before I ever got the first egg where the rabbits only had to feed for two months and I already had nine rabbits ready to go in the freezer so that's kind of how that worked the garden I've probably got four or five thousand dollars in my raised bed garden and you know materials cost money soil amendments cost money the fence cost money to keep out the deer all that stuff cost money so what I did though was instead of doing all at once I broke it down into every year I created a budget you know what I had income wise what my bills cost what was left over how much of that that I was going to put into the homestead part and then another section of that I put into paying off excess debt because I was working on multiple goals I wanted to homestead that was one goal I also wanted to be debt-free within a certain amount of time that was a second goal and then I had all these projects to do around the homestead to get you know all this stuff done without getting deeper in debt so that's the other thing you got to do you got to not get deeper in debt do this with cash money so you know these people that I see that are posting all the time like how much money can we make off our homestead of this is our first year should not even be your first work because you should keep your job as a way to finance your homestead until you get an income coming in so that's gonna be the third tip is you need a source of income Wow your homesteading weather you know if you're married and you're a couple at least one of you should work maybe both of you should because that first year you're not going to be doing anything you're just going to be observing right because we are following step one you're just gonna observe what's on your property so that you don't go mess something up another thing was only a homestead I had a bunch of dandelions that only grow in one spot of my yard and that's where I had originally planned to put the garden had I put the garden there there would not have been dandelions for me to make the underlying jelly with kind of the same way with red buds now there's a lot of Red Bud trees on my property but a lot of those trees would have got cut down because I had originally planned to put the orchard somewhere entirely different than where it was and my original goal was to go in and cut down all the trees that was currently there and then build a new orchard in its place and if I would have done that I would have cut down several nut trees several red buds you know there was just other other reasons why so that first step is the most important the second step is figuring out a way to finance your goals without going into more debt keeping a job you got to keep a job the the way that I bought this property and have done everything that I've done so I come here I did the gardens I did the rabbits I did the chickens I've done the bees I down the be expansion I've done over 70 fruit trees I've done hundreds of berries so many berries I've lost track I don't even try to count them no more the fruit trees are simple I can just go one two three four or five so that you know on down the line until they're all counted berries I've got them everywhere I've planted berries I don't even forgot about berries but all that stuff takes time and you might say you know it's probably gonna take me about two days to build the chicken coop and it you can have bad weather and it'll take you a month and if you are really tight on your schedule then you're not gonna stay within your schedule and you're gonna get aggravated because things are over-budget and you didn't get everything you done you wanted to do so make sure you include some down time over a lot on the amount of time that you it's gonna take I've seriously gotten any more where if I think something's gonna take eight hours I just multiply by ten and that he's surprised how often had actually works out so you know I thought it was gonna take eight hours but it ended up taking Haiti and that's pretty realistic and that's not a lack of experience that's just dealing with things like weather and just stuff that can go wrong on you know on the homestead an animal gets sick I've had to happen numerous time they just totally mess up my plans for that day or the next couple of days so that's another tip what else can we talk about getting out of debt I did something so when I started to do this a lot of people started telling me about Dave Ramsey and I never followed his I never followed his like the way he does it but what I found out was the way that I did it was pretty close instead of doing snowball I did Avalanche and I kind of did it on my own and I created a spreadsheet to help me track my expenses and budget and what I'm spinning out and my goals and all that stuff so I got some spreadsheets all linked to in the description if I don't forget if you hear it in the video and it's not there remind me I've actually got blank ones ready to go you guys have the goats they're like going crazy because they hear me talking they're just gonna have to wait that's kind of like what I wanted to discuss this is gonna be a multi-part series because I can already tell I'm at 16 minutes now and I try to keep my videos you know relatively low so through editing but there's gonna be a second part to this video this is only the first part I have several series planned I basically just touched on the three things that I felt is super important for you to do if you want to get into home setting and self-sufficiency and do it without failing because I'm gonna be honest with you I am now all my sixth year and if all goes well I will be 100% debt-free and about between 12 and 17 months kind of hard to tell at this coronavirus the only thing I want is my house everything else I pay cash for or I charge it to a card and I pay the card off that month so you can do it you just have to stay focused and you have to have a plan and you have to know what you want to do that's for what I really wanted to say was you have to you have to know what you want to do you have to have a plan and you have to have some money to back it with and as long as you have those three things home setting and self-sufficiency lifestyle is pretty easy to do so stick around for the next episode of this coming up soon don't forget to like subscribe share my videos if you found this useful and if you have any questions don't hesitate to ask in the comments",
