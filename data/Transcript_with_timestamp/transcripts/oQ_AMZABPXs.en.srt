1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:06,359
so here I am with my wisteria vine I

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:08,790
love this fine because wisterias will

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,280
bloom if they get very little water very

4
00:00:08,790 --> 00:00:14,250
little fertilizer but they do need sun

5
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,630
now the fragrance is intoxicating and a

6
00:00:14,250 --> 00:00:19,500
lot of people ask about when to prune

7
00:00:15,630 --> 00:00:21,720
wisteria pruning after blooming but I

8
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,810
want to introduce you to another vine

9
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,210
that will flower in part shade or even a

10
00:00:24,810 --> 00:00:29,760
mostly shaded situation and it is called

11
00:00:27,210 --> 00:00:34,050
a cobija so come with me we're going to

12
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,180
meet a key be divine okay so this is a

13
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:38,879
key via this one is called the chocolate

14
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:41,460
a cobija because it smells as sweet as

15
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:44,370
chocolate I love this vine it has very

16
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,920
intricate blooms and has a very very

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:49,050
long bloom time this fine starts

18
00:00:46,920 --> 00:00:51,930
blooming Oh probably around April and

19
00:00:49,050 --> 00:00:55,020
will bloom up until probably close to

20
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:57,000
June so here is a nice advantage of a

21
00:00:55,020 --> 00:01:00,000
cobija vine you can take your pruning

22
00:00:57,000 --> 00:01:02,699
clippers and when it's in most beautiful

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,680
bloom it smells the sweetest that's when

24
00:01:02,699 --> 00:01:07,140
you go out and you remove some of the

25
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:09,570
dead foliage because a cobija vine in

26
00:01:07,140 --> 00:01:11,340
the northwest is semi evergreen so you

27
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,010
can see the new foal just nice and green

28
00:01:11,340 --> 00:01:15,630
and healthy but right up here these are

29
00:01:14,010 --> 00:01:17,040
the leaves that are larger because

30
00:01:15,630 --> 00:01:18,540
they've been on the plant all year and

31
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:20,490
they've got you a little bit of winter

32
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,920
damage and so it's nice just to be able

33
00:01:20,490 --> 00:01:24,540
to come in break those off and because

34
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:26,970
this vine is already covering the

35
00:01:24,540 --> 00:01:29,159
structure when I see these these

36
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:31,350
tendrils that are you know big and long

37
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,110
and shooting up straight up they're easy

38
00:01:31,350 --> 00:01:36,540
to just break off as well and that's

39
00:01:34,110 --> 00:01:38,180
form of pruning as well so this is a

40
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:41,460
vine that you can clean up and proved

41
00:01:38,180 --> 00:01:44,100
right when it's in flour and then that

42
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:47,280
way it controls the size of the vine so

43
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,290
a key be mine a great flowering vine for

44
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,290
a semi shaded location
