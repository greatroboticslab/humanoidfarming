When gardening and caring for onions and garlic,
there is sometimes confusion on what exactly

2
00:00:13,690 --> 00:00:14,690
to do.

3
00:00:14,690 --> 00:00:19,110
For garlic, we always want to top the plants
to help build the bulbs.

4
00:00:19,110 --> 00:00:22,460
For onions, however, we do not want to cut
or top them.

5
00:00:22,460 --> 00:00:26,759
If we find onions in our garden that look
similar to these, with flowers, we want to

6
00:00:26,759 --> 00:00:28,490
pull them immediately.

7
00:00:28,490 --> 00:00:33,360
If we have onions that have not flowered,
we want them to continue growing naturally

8
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,450
until the stalks have fallen over by themselves.

9
00:00:36,450 --> 00:00:42,230
We’ll want to make sure to pull them out
on a hot, dry sunny day like we have today.

10
00:00:42,230 --> 00:00:46,970
Once we have pulled the onions, we’ll want
to leave the stalks on and let them cure naturally

11
00:00:46,970 --> 00:00:49,680
in a cool, dry place for two to three weeks.

12
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,449
After that time, we’ll then want to cut
the stalks about one to two inches above the

13
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:56,580
bulb, and then we can use them for storage.

14
00:00:56,580 --> 00:01:01,799
We’ll want to store the healthy onions by
themselves, avoiding any damaged or diseased

15
00:01:01,799 --> 00:01:04,280
onions with the healthy ones.

16
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:08,880
Some varieties may last two to three months,
while others many only last one to two weeks.
