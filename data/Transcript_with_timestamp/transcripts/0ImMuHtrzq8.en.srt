let's get this party started you know

37
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,000
what i want to start off on a high note

38
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:05,840
i don't want to be a debbie downer just

39
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:07,439
talk about the bad stuff so i want to

40
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:09,280
give some love to the sub compact

41
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,680
tractors in general those are one of my

42
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,680
absolute favorite sub markets the

43
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:15,360
subcompact submarket

44
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
that's out there today they have kind of

45
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,200
revolutionized and just transformed the

46
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,600
whole compact tractor world in general

47
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,600
the 1025r i think is leading the charge

48
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:25,119
with innovation the ease of connection

49
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:26,960
of their loader of their bucket of their

50
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,360
mower deck of their backhoe just all

51
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:30,880
around is just top notch the kubota bx

52
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,320
is right on its heels really coming out

53
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,720
with some good innovations but for me

54
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,079
the 10 25 is second to none all right we

55
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,759
gave you something sweet it's time to

56
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,360
take that medicine here we go now make

57
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,560
sure you stick around because there are

58
00:01:39,360 --> 00:01:42,399
two tractors that are going to be on

59
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,240
this list that i would not take if they

60
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,000
were free and i refuse to sell them

61
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,520
anymore at my dealership before we get

62
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,439
to that i want to share something about

63
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,799
the tractor industry in general you know

64
00:01:49,439 --> 00:01:52,240
something a lot of us don't really know

65
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,240
you see it come up on forums from time

66
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:55,759
to time but there's really very few

67
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:57,520
parent manufacturers there's a lot of

68
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,680
tractor brands that are out there but

69
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,600
they all roll up to just a handful of

70
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:03,200
actual manufacturers that are making the

71
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:04,560
chassis the transmission and the engines

72
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:06,240
all right to give you a few examples of

73
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:07,920
what i'm talking about let's talk about

74
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,000
the manufacturer de dong which is a

75
00:02:07,920 --> 00:02:12,000
korean company they are the parent

76
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,160
manufacturer of the brand their primary

77
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:15,680
brand i would say which is coyote in

78
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,760
fact they are now manufacturing the

79
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,760
recently reintroduced bobcat line of

80
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,680
compact tractors and they also had their

81
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:23,520
name on the mccormick lineup as well now

82
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,280
they may not produce every single model

83
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,480
within another brand's lineup but they

84
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:28,400
are going to have their fingers on it

85
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,000
tym is another interesting one of course

86
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,160
they do have their own brand but they

87
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:33,920
are also making tractors for branson for

88
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,239
rural king they used to make them for

89
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:37,360
cabela's bad boy the list goes on

90
00:02:36,239 --> 00:02:38,879
there's a lot of other smaller

91
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
manufacturers as well that they white

92
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:43,440
label for it's just interesting to know

93
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,800
how one company can represent so many

94
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,879
sub brands and then we're going to have

95
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,000
another pretty good sized company lsm

96
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:50,319
trim which of course is going to make

97
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:52,239
the ls lineup of tractors but they also

98
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,239
have their fingers on the cnh brands as

99
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,480
well so your case tractors your new

100
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,560
holland tractors mccormick farm trax

101
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,760
some other brands and again this is not

102
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,360
all of their tractors that they're

103
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
making but there could be certain series

104
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:04,560
certain sub compacts or compact models

105
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,159
that they have and this isn't

106
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:08,000
necessarily a bad thing because it means

107
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:09,360
that perhaps if you have one of these

108
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
other dealers that are near you maybe

109
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,040
you have a new holland but you have an

110
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,200
ls tractor i had this happen a while

111
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:17,760
back i actually purchased an ls tractor

112
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:19,760
i think it was a 47 48 horsepower

113
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,920
tractor it came with a new holland

114
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:23,920
manual and the parts were

115
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,000
one for one the identical the same exact

116
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:27,519
thing so it could work to your advantage

117
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:29,360
to have one of these brands that works

118
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
with a lot of different

119
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:32,239
white label partners that they have

120
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,159
because it can make it a lot easier for

121
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:35,760
you to find parts if needed and there is

122
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:37,680
one that a lot of john deere haters like

123
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,360
to point to as well which is that yanmar

124
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,440
makes attractors for john deere well i

125
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:42,879
do know that for a short period of time

126
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:45,280
in history i think it was the early

127
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:47,200
2000s that was the case yanmar was

128
00:03:45,280 --> 00:03:49,599
making the tractors for john deere but

129
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,959
that's not the case anymore yes yanmar

130
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:52,400
does supply the engines and they've

131
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:54,239
supplied the engines for pretty much

132
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:56,400
every john deere compact for decades and

133
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:58,000
decades they're an excellent top-tier

134
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,200
diesel engine manufacturer and you

135
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,439
should be proud to have one in your

136
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:03,120
tractor but the persistent comment that

137
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,040
yanmar is still making john deere

138
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:06,959
tractors just simply isn't true and it's

139
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:08,159
getting kind of old guys okay so first

140
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:09,519
up on the list we're going to combine

141
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,360
these two groups which are going to be

142
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:12,799
rental tractors and auction tractors

143
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,400
i've seen my fair share of rental

144
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:16,000
tractors over the years and i can tell

145
00:04:14,400 --> 00:04:17,919
you one thing's for sure they don't get

146
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:19,519
worked very easy you have all sorts of

147
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,120
different operators that are on there

148
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:23,040
running for a weekend running for a day

149
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,400
renting for a couple hours maybe a week

150
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,240
whatever it is they don't care they're

151
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,000
just working it to get their job done

152
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,759
they have varying levels of experience

153
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:31,840
with the equipment now most quality

154
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:33,680
rental companies do have good mechanics

155
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,240
on hand they service they inspect they

156
00:04:33,680 --> 00:04:38,560
repair they're on a good program to make

157
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:40,080
sure it's maintained as needed but still

158
00:04:38,560 --> 00:04:41,919
that doesn't diminish the fact that you

159
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,680
have so many different operators so many

160
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:45,840
different scenarios that that tractor is

161
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:47,919
being used in for me that is a situation

162
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,440
i want to avoid now oftentimes you find

163
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,360
those tractors going up for auction and

164
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:52,880
that kind of ties us into that but

165
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,320
typically if you're seeing tractors

166
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:56,320
going on auction that means that they've

167
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
been sitting on a dealer lot or some

168
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,680
other location for a period of time and

169
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,360
no matter what they do when they lower

170
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:03,039
that price they're not able to get it

171
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,479
sold and typically at some point that

172
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,080
sales manager is going to say i want to

173
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:07,280
get it off my books and clear it out and

174
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,039
they're going to take it to auction and

175
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,400
let it sell for whatever it goes for but

176
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,080
if they couldn't get it sold while it

177
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:13,759
was on their dealer lot there's got to

178
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:14,960
be a reason for it and typically it is

179
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:16,400
not going to be the price it's going to

180
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,320
mean that there's something else going

181
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,000
on with it there and for me i don't want

182
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,080
to inherit those problems now i used to

183
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:23,680
buy tractors on rare occasion from

184
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
auctions if i wanted to get a certain

185
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,360
series or a certain model in and i've

186
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:28,800
all but eliminated that i haven't bought

187
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:30,560
a tractor from an auction in years

188
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,240
anymore i found that you don't get very

189
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:34,560
good deals out there i found that many

190
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:36,240
auctions put a surcharge or a buyer's

191
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:38,960
fee or some kind of a premium that can

192
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,479
be anywhere from 10 to 20 depending what

193
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,160
it is which is just gonna drive that

194
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:43,680
price up even higher i think that's

195
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,440
something that a lot of buyers go into

196
00:05:43,680 --> 00:05:47,280
it not realizing as well now it's not

197
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
that you can't find a steal of a deal

198
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:51,039
from time to time at an auction but for

199
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:52,080
the most part they are so popular

200
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:53,680
there's so many guys that know what

201
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
they're doing you're just not gonna find

202
00:05:53,680 --> 00:05:57,680
those great values okay next up pretty

203
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:00,080
much everybody in the compact tractor

204
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:01,680
market wants a tractor with a loader of

205
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:03,120
the hundreds or maybe it's thousands of

206
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,639
tractors that i've sold over the years i

207
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,400
can think of two of them that guys did

208
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:07,919
not want the loaders on that we removed

209
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:10,080
the loaders took them off and sold those

210
00:06:07,919 --> 00:06:11,759
separately every other tractor has had a

211
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:13,120
loader sold with it sometimes we've

212
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,720
bought tractors and then added the

213
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:16,560
loaders ourselves to them if we can make

214
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:18,960
the numbers work but that's very

215
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:20,560
challenging and i always encourage folks

216
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,000
do not buy a tractor i just had this

217
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,720
conversation with a gentleman the other

218
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:25,039
day

219
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:26,800
he found a gem of a deal a beautiful

220
00:06:25,039 --> 00:06:28,560
john deere 790 tractor but it didn't

221
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:29,919
have a front end loader on it you can't

222
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,600
buy a new one you can get a new

223
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:33,039
aftermarket but if you're looking in the

224
00:06:31,600 --> 00:06:34,319
used market you're trying to save some

225
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,160
money so if you're saving money on a

226
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,840
used tractor you want to find a nice

227
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:39,520
used loader to match up with that and

228
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:40,800
have your savings all around well it's

229
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
almost like finding a needle in a

230
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,080
haystack when you're trying to find a

231
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:45,520
used loader to match your tractor

232
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:47,039
typically you don't want to have that

233
00:06:45,520 --> 00:06:48,800
shipped in so it has to be within

234
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,240
driving distance of where you're at it

235
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:51,759
needs to include the right brackets all

236
00:06:50,240 --> 00:06:53,120
the right components to go along with it

237
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:54,319
and then of course the price has to be

238
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:55,599
right too and if you're looking at

239
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:57,919
something a little bit older like that

240
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:59,520
john deere 790 it's not made anymore

241
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:01,280
there's no replacement series that have

242
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,720
a compatible loader to put on there that

243
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,639
means that all those folks that have a

244
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,319
john deere 790 without a loader are

245
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,000
constantly keeping eyeballs on the

246
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:10,319
market looking all over craigslist and

247
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,240
facebook to try to see if one pops up in

248
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:13,599
their area so it's gonna drive the price

249
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,840
up you're gonna have to jump on it right

250
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:18,319
away it can be a long and tedious search

251
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:19,680
so using the 790 as an example all those

252
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,360
folks out there in the market right now

253
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,880
that have that tractor model without a

254
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:24,800
loader are constantly checking the

255
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,479
market on craigslist and facebook to see

256
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,000
what's out there what's available that's

257
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,520
going to drive the costs up i've heard

258
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
of guys searching for months and months

259
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,360
sometimes years and years just to find a

260
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:35,120
loader to add onto their tractor trust

261
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,120
me you're going to be a lot better off

262
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:38,800
passing on that 790 without the loader

263
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:40,160
to find the right machine with a loader

264
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:42,080
already on it you're going to be a lot

265
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:43,680
happier now on top of loaders you got to

266
00:07:42,080 --> 00:07:45,039
make sure you have a quick attached

267
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:46,879
connection between the end of that

268
00:07:45,039 --> 00:07:49,039
loader and your bucket you do not want

269
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,120
to have a pin that bucket it's another

270
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,800
item i'm asked about constantly which is

271
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:54,560
can you sell me a conversion kit to make

272
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,160
my pin bucket into a quick attach

273
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:57,840
whether that's john deere or skid steer

274
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:00,240
quick attach it's a very expensive

275
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:02,319
proposition to do that after the fact if

276
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,840
you're ordering new try to get that

277
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,360
option built right in don't get one of

278
00:08:03,840 --> 00:08:07,039
the goofy quick attaches that some of

279
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:08,879
these manufacturers offer stick with the

280
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:10,400
big ones primarily the skid steer quick

281
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:12,639
attach and even if you're looking in the

282
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,080
used market as well pay close attention

283
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:15,440
ask that question if you can't clearly

284
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:16,720
see it in the pictures

285
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:18,080
make sure you have a quick attached

286
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:20,639
bucket that's going to allow you to put

287
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,720
on a set of pellet forks a snow pusher a

288
00:08:20,639 --> 00:08:24,479
grapple a bail spear all sorts of

289
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:26,000
different attachments very quickly and

290
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:27,840
easily it's going to open up a lot of

291
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:29,520
options you won't regret it now i'm as

292
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,800
big a fan of old tractors as the next

293
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,120
guy there's just something about a

294
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,640
classic tractor chris and i grew up with

295
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:36,560
a ford eight and a nine end up at my

296
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:38,560
grandpa's farm but you know what those

297
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:40,800
old timers just had a special skill set

298
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,440
that unfortunately i did not inherit and

299
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,959
so a lot of you guys out there you get

300
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,720
nostalgic i think right you see these

301
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:48,160
cheaper price points of tractors like

302
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,080
that eight ended at nine and you think

303
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:52,080
that's what i want to have the downside

304
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,760
is is that they typically require more

305
00:08:52,080 --> 00:08:55,839
maintenance than modern tractors and so

306
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,760
you need to have that skill set but you

307
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,279
also need to have the ability to get

308
00:08:57,760 --> 00:09:00,959
those replacement parts when you need to

309
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:02,480
which can be harder and harder to find

310
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,680
but as with anything typically if it's

311
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,959
going to be older it's going to have

312
00:09:03,680 --> 00:09:06,399
more downtime which means you're

313
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:08,080
spending more of your time working on

314
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,760
your tractor instead of working with

315
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,120
your tractor getting your projects done

316
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:12,959
and i get a lot of folks i want to trade

317
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:15,120
those tractors in on the newer tractors

318
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,320
that i sell and i don't want to take

319
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:17,200
those on trading you know we want to

320
00:09:16,320 --> 00:09:18,720
sell

321
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:20,240
clean lower equipment here we're very

322
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,839
specific on what we want to carry so

323
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,360
this isn't knocking those older tractors

324
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,120
if you're a handy guy and you can figure

325
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:26,480
it out i'd encourage you to get one but

326
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,160
for a lot of folks these days that are

327
00:09:26,480 --> 00:09:29,600
just now moving out to the country they

328
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:31,360
weren't blessed with that skill set just

329
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:33,360
like i'm not so i'd stick to the modern

330
00:09:31,360 --> 00:09:34,640
day tractors now on that note even for

331
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:36,480
you guys buying the newer tractors

332
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:39,920
whether that's john deere kubota coyote

333
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:41,440
mahindra ls bobcat you name it you still

334
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,680
want to have that dealer support that's

335
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:45,360
nearby these newer tractors have longer

336
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:46,880
warranties on them long powertrain

337
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,640
warranties many of them are five six

338
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:49,920
seven years long so if something does go

339
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,920
wrong you want to be able to take it in

340
00:09:49,920 --> 00:09:54,320
quickly to your dealer that's hopefully

341
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:56,320
not 100 or 200 miles away have them

342
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,760
repair under warranty minimize the cost

343
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:59,040
to you out of pocket you know if you

344
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:00,399
don't want to handle your service on

345
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:02,000
your own as well it's nice to have them

346
00:10:00,399 --> 00:10:03,519
right around the corner at least in the

347
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:05,360
next town over so you can take it in

348
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:06,880
there have those oil changes the regular

349
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:08,240
maintenance done now fortunately in the

350
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,680
day and age that we live in if you can

351
00:10:08,240 --> 00:10:10,880
handle the simple maintenance yourself

352
00:10:09,680 --> 00:10:12,959
which a lot of you guys can with

353
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:14,880
greasing with oil changes and air

354
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,160
filters and whatnot for most of us these

355
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,240
tractors are typically going to require

356
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,000
one major service interval a year which

357
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,000
can be done on a saturday afternoon and

savings they'll ship it right to you all

367
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:39,680
right now i promised you a couple of

368
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:41,440
specific models and these are going to

369
00:10:39,680 --> 00:10:43,600
carry over from that old video these

370
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,680
still remain true i want to make sure

371
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,800
that you avoid these tractors i know

372
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:48,800
you're going to hear some folks out

373
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:50,160
there that don't have an issue but this

374
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:51,839
is a big chunk of money that you're

375
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:53,519
spending on a tractor and i think

376
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,279
there's so many other models out there

377
00:10:53,519 --> 00:10:57,120
so many similar models that you can

378
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,360
avoid these ones if you find a good deal

379
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
on it it's a good deal for a reason okay

380
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:04,480
so the first model that you want to

381
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:07,360
avoid if you can is the kubota b3350

382
00:11:04,480 --> 00:11:09,360
just google that model kubota b3350 and

383
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,800
then put the word problems after it

384
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:13,040
you're gonna have hours of reading

385
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,640
material they just have issues up and

386
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:16,959
down the board with their dpf their

387
00:11:14,640 --> 00:11:18,959
regen it's just a constant battle yes

388
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:20,720
there's some stories of it being covered

389
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,160
under warranty but there's a lot more

390
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,000
stories of it not being covered under

391
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,680
warranty if you want to get that series

392
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:28,399
but save a little bit of money look for

393
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,720
the kubota b2650 or you can look at the

394
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:34,000
new generation now the kubota lx series

395
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:35,440
the lx 2610 and the lx 3310 both of

396
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:37,279
those are going to perform very well for

397
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,440
you just do yourself a favor and avoid

398
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,200
the 3350. now john deere's not off the

399
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:43,120
hook here either they do have a problem

400
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:45,519
child of their own and i was bit by this

401
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,320
one myself several years ago in fact i

402
00:11:45,519 --> 00:11:50,480
had a john deere 2320 and had that model

403
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,839
that specific tractor sold actually i

404
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:53,440
was still working out of this garage

405
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:55,279
we're standing in right now at my house

406
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:57,040
and i had just taken that tractor moved

407
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,000
around to the back of the house to get

408
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
it out of the way for a little bit of

409
00:11:58,000 --> 00:12:01,440
time when i went to turn that tractor

410
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:03,600
back on and move it back up this way

411
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:05,760
guess what i heard a loud clanking noise

412
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:07,680
right underneath the floorboard i turned

413
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,040
the tractor off i hopped off and looked

414
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:11,200
underneath and there was just hydraulic

415
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,600
oil spilling down i had sheared off the

416
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:15,040
drive shaft where the u-joint is at and

417
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,040
the way that mine broke just happened to

418
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:19,040
break inside the trans axle so this

419
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:20,720
turned out to be over a four thousand

420
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:22,160
dollar repair i had to notify the

421
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,480
customer who had bought the tractor but

422
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,079
not taken delivery yet and in turn they

423
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:27,760
wanted to cancel that i don't blame them

424
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:29,120
at all and i sold that tractor for parts

425
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:30,560
to somebody handy who could fix it on

426
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,160
their own and another john deere model

427
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:34,560
that had similar problems for a few

428
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:38,320
years was the john deere 2305 so again

429
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:40,399
2320 2305 do your homework on those if

430
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,079
they had the u joints replaced it's not

431
00:12:40,399 --> 00:12:43,920
going to be much of an issue the problem

432
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,399
was that there was no instruction in the

433
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:47,839
manual that told owners to grease those

434
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
u-joints which were tucked way up

435
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:51,279
underneath there there was no easy way

436
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,720
to access it no way to really know about

437
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,399
it and so they would dry out they would

438
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,320
seize up they would fail mine just

439
00:12:54,399 --> 00:12:58,639
happened to fail in the most

440
00:12:56,320 --> 00:13:00,240
expensive way so again i'd encourage you

441
00:12:58,639 --> 00:13:01,760
just plug those models in and type the

442
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,600
word problems after you're going to have

443
00:13:01,760 --> 00:13:05,120
all sorts of reading material you know

444
00:13:03,600 --> 00:13:06,800
if you think the deal is too good to be

445
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:08,320
true there's probably a reason why it's

446
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:10,560
priced so low just to get rid of it and

447
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:12,160
at the very least ask that seller the

448
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:13,920
questions ask them if these parts were

449
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:15,279
replaced what the service history was

450
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:17,120
like what they know about it because

451
00:13:15,279 --> 00:13:18,800
maybe they did something to correct that

452
00:13:17,120 --> 00:13:20,240
problem ahead of time but the last thing

453
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:21,600
you want to do is get yourself into an

454
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:22,959
