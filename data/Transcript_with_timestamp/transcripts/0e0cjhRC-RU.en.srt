uncle duke is hanging out with the girls

00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:18,790
in the treehouse

4
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:21,480
and it's the cutest thing

00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:34,960
and tasks it's being

10
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:37,120
a good boy with his mom over there

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,120
so i was talking to

12
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,160
this lady and she was asking me

13
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:45,200
questions about my experience but at

14
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:48,719
this point i been loving what's been

15
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:52,079
happening when the moms raised the kids

16
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:55,360
they are super sweet and they are super

17
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,079
tame and they want human interaction

18
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:58,879
because we do take the time to go with

19
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,840
them

20
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:04,400
and spend time with them not only every

21
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:06,240
morning but every afternoon

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,960
so when i get them out the first thing

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:12,560
in the morning i sit down with them i

24
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:15,280
just climb all over me i pet them i get

25
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,200
all that energy out of them

26
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:20,560
and then by the time they're kind of

27
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:23,280
done with me they want to go explore

28
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,000
play in their tree house or something

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:29,119
like that then that is when i get my

30
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:31,119
clue i pick up my stuff and go

31
00:01:29,119 --> 00:01:33,600
they spend most of the day with their

32
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,680
moms and playing around and trying to

33
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,720
pick up fights really with everyone in

34
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:39,040
the pen

35
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,600
at least the boy is

36
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,320
but when i come in the afternoon they

37
00:01:41,600 --> 00:01:47,360
are kind of done with the herd and they

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:48,720
want that human attention again and so i

39
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:51,439
give it to them

40
00:01:48,720 --> 00:01:53,759
we have a great time the girls like to

41
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,640
fall asleep on my lap or my daughter's

42
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,000
lap

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,799
it is the craziest thing that they

44
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,680
really enjoy spending time with us

45
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:05,280
but by six o'clock i've been putting

46
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:07,759
them in at seven

47
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,560
but by six o'clock they're kind of all

48
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,800
waiting by the gate so we go in and we

49
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,200
spend time with them

50
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,080
the little kids are kind of sleepy so

51
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:19,760
they do play but then at some point lay

52
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,280
down and they

53
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:25,280
they kind of let you know that they're

54
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:27,920
attire so we let them sleep on our laps

55
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,360
while we pet them and we wait for seven

56
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,200
o'clock and then

57
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,160
they all go in with our moms and their

58
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:34,959
pens

59
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:37,920
and you know they have as much milk as

60
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,040
they want at this point i'm not milking

61
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,599
i was milking but really it didn't work

62
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:46,160
as planned because i don't have a

63
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,720
separate area for milking and it was

64
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:52,319
stressful for the mom because the babies

65
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:55,120
wanted to nurse i had to clip the rest

66
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:58,879
of the coats duke was not having the

67
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:02,000
clipping and so once the boys move out

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,200
we'll be able to do something separate

69
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,440
and

70
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:06,560
we'll be able to get things done really

71
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,480
in there

72
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:10,560
i'm not worrying about

73
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,879
how much milk they're gonna produce i

74
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,920
see they have full udders

75
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:18,879
and even if they're not

76
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:21,840
amazing quantities of milk

77
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:23,680
i just need some grace at this time and

78
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,720
understand this is our first year with

79
00:03:23,680 --> 00:03:27,200
goads

80
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,640
and we're doing the best that we can

81
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:30,799
so even though i don't have any

82
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:32,959
experience with bottle babies i think

83
00:03:30,799 --> 00:03:35,280
that the experience that i have with our

84
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,640
moms raising them

85
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,200
it's

86
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:42,239
great really and

87
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,959
i don't think i would separate and

88
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,680
bottle feed in order to have a more

89
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,920
friendly goat maybe for other reasons

90
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:55,439
health reasons a mom rejecting her baby

91
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:57,519
but right now i this is my experience

92
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,319
and i thought i'd share it it might be

93
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,519
something that changes in the future but

94
00:04:00,319 --> 00:04:03,360
right now

95
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:05,120
i really love

96
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:07,920
that they're okay with being with the

97
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:10,400
herd and they're okay being with us

98
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:13,040
and they're super sweet and super loved

99
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:14,959
you know they want your love

100
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:20,040
but at the same time it's not like i

101
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:20,040
have to babysit them 24 7.

102

[Music]

103
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:54,680
now if you know what that is let me know

104
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:54,680
what kind of bird is that

105
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:00,400
it's like it's coughing or something

106
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,039
