1
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:07,440
hello everybody

2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639
keith burns and davis bailey here with

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:10,000
green cover seed

4
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,920
we're going to give you a quick plot

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
tour uh we call these this our

6
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,519
overwintering plots davis

7
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:17,920
tell us a little bit about how the plots

8
00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:21,039
were set up and when they were planted

9
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,640
these plots were planted september 30th

10
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:26,240
it was

11
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:26,800
we wanted to focus mostly on the cereals

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,400
and the

13
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,080
legumes that we use in over wintering

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,719
mixes we tried a few

15
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,320
brassicas mixed in with some clovers and

16
00:00:32,719 --> 00:00:35,920
we didn't see exceptional sand there

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,480
just a little bit too late

18
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,160
but again we have the overwintering

19
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,320
cereals and grasses

20
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:43,760
the legumes here right now we're in the

21
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,039
clovers and we've got

22
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:50,640
four clovers here we've got

23
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:53,520
fixation blanca clover kentucky pride

24
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,039
crimson clover right here i'm standing

25
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:57,199
in the yellow clover

26
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,079
and then we've got the big red clover a

27
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,960
newer variety for

28
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:01,600
us so several things that we're really

29
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:03,280
going to stress

30
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:04,960
and point out as we work our way through

31
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,960
this number one

32
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,720
this was probably planted later than

33
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:10,479
what we would want if we wanted to try

34
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:12,320
to establish clovers

35
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
and you'll see that the clovers aren't

36
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:16,240
the greatest thing that we have out here

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
uh but it's it's a you know in a

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:20,479
september beginning of october

39
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,000
is a realistic time for when uh we would

40
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,280
plant a lot of cover crops

41
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:28,560
in a typical fall uh the second thing is

42
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:32,320
we got to record cold levels this winter

43
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,520
i know my thermometer said 34 below zero

44
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:36,000
one morning so we were extraordinarily

45
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:39,040
cold

46
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,720
but you cannot tell that from these

47
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,040
plots we had some of the best

48
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,439
overwintering that we've ever had and

49
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,560
that goes to show you how powerful of an

50
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:49,200
insulator snow

51
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:51,840
is because when we got that cold we had

52
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:53,840
probably 12 to 16 inches of snow

53
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,479
really laid nicely across all these

54
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,759
plots and we had

55
00:01:55,479 --> 00:01:58,640
extraordinary overwintering ability in

56
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:00,640
fact

57
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,159
this crimson clover that i'm standing in

58
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:03,680
this happens to be kentucky pride

59
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:05,119
crimson clover

60
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:06,719
this is probably one of the nicest

61
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,720
stands of crimson clover

62
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:10,959
we've ever had over winter and i would

63
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:11,760
say i've probably only seen crimson over

64
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:14,800
winter here

65
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,560
maybe three out of the last 12 years and

66
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,680
and that tells you

67
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:21,680
how good that snow was at insulating

68
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
things because we would not see this

69
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:25,040
even in a relatively mild winter with no

70
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,879
snow cover

71
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,200
so the so the crimson clover is

72
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:32,160
obviously the fastest growing clover

73
00:02:29,200 --> 00:02:34,319
uh it's it's the biggest so far it's got

74
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:36,640
a really good stand kentucky pride is an

75
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:37,360
improved version of a dixie type crimson

76
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:39,519
clover

77
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:40,800
so i'm excited to see how this looks and

78
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,120
how this works

79
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:45,200
the bellonsa clover next to it here and

80
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,879
this is not surprising balance is a kind

81
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:50,000
of a slow starter

82
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:52,319
it's it's going to look slow but once

83
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,160
it starts growing and kicking in it's

84
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:55,840
really going to grow fast and it will

85
00:02:54,160 --> 00:02:58,319
overtake this crimson clover and the

86
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:00,239
amount of biomass produced this spring

87
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,360
we will be out here to give periodic

88
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,400
updates

89
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,920
and show how this is growing and which

90
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:07,920
one is kind of catching up

91
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,680
uh the yellow blossom too late for it to

92
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:10,239
really establish so i'm not surprised

93
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,239
that

94
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,239
uh there's not a lot out there there's

95
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,360
there's some it's sporadic it's not the

96
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:17,680
greatest stand

97
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,280
but again for yellow blossom we would

98
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,360
want to probably establish that

99
00:03:19,280 --> 00:03:23,120
uh the end of august would really be

100
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,599
more ideal on that

101
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:27,680
and then the red clover a perennial type

102
00:03:25,599 --> 00:03:29,200
clover so it's going to come on it'll

103
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,080
probably fill in

104
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:32,400
but again a poor stand again just far

105
00:03:32,080 --> 00:03:34,400
far

106
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:35,840
too late to really get it established

107
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:37,120
right so

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,120
you know sometimes when we do these

109
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:40,560
plots we want to demonstrate things that

110
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,159
we don't recommend

111
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
and and this is why we wouldn't

112
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:44,959
recommend putting these clovers in this

113
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,879
late

114
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:49,360
because you're just not going to have

115
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:51,680
the best chance of success on those

116
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:53,280
right yeah when we came out here

117
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,920
beginning of march

118
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
it's april 15th right now so about a

119
00:03:55,920 --> 00:03:59,200
month ago

120
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:01,200
i was surprised to see that the only

121
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:02,799
clover that was visible at that time was

122
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,560
the crimson clover

123
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,879
as you think about it it's not quite as

124
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,439
surprising because if it is the fastest

125
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:12,239
growing clover which it is

126
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:12,720
since we had that nice blanket of snow

127
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:14,560
it

128
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,079
over wintered exceptionally well and so

129
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:17,919
it makes sense that we see it

130
00:04:16,079 --> 00:04:19,519
with the best stand right here right now

131
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:21,120
like you said i think we expect that

132
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,320
fixation to kick in a little bit later

133
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,240
we'll come back in a couple weeks and

134
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,639
give you an update on this

135
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:28,479
okay these next set of plots are winter

136
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:30,639
peas which again

137
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,919
are not the most reliable overwintering

138
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:35,040
legume for us but

139
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:36,960
again with the snow that we had

140
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
these are some of the nicest winter peas

141
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,919
that we've had as well davis tell us

142
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,560
what we got planted here

143
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,479
we have three strips here two of the

144
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:45,520
strips these first two are austrian

145
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,280
winter peas

146
00:04:45,520 --> 00:04:49,520
the first strip is planted at one and a

147
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:51,199
half inches deep the second strip where

148
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:52,000
keith is standing is two and a half

149
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:54,240
inches deep

150
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:56,639
and then where i'm standing here are our

151
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,520
new wyo winter peas and what depth were

152
00:04:56,639 --> 00:04:58,720
those planted at

153
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,720
they were planted at two and a half

154
00:04:58,720 --> 00:05:02,800
inches and a half also and one of the

155
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
reasons that we wanted to plant them

156
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,600
deeper

157
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,440
is that typically to get a winter peat

158
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,479
over winter the deeper you plant it the

159
00:05:07,440 --> 00:05:09,680
better it is

160
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,680
because you got to keep the growing

161
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,280
point under the ground to keep it from

162
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:14,960
freezing off and so

163
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:17,120
we would have expected in a normal

164
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,960
winter for these deeper planted ones

165
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,800
to look better than the shallow planted

166
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:22,479
ones at an inch and a half

167
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,000
but they look fine but again that's

168
00:05:22,479 --> 00:05:26,320
because we had we had the snow

169
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:28,160
cover and so you know there's there's

170
00:05:26,320 --> 00:05:30,639
maybe some subtle differences i

171
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:32,320
i think the wild winters maybe look a

172
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,720
little bit nicer a little

173
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,160
more even stand and what the wild

174
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
winters are

175
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:41,199
it is a fairly new variety developed by

176
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:43,840
the university of wyoming thus the name

177
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:45,680
uh it is a selection out of austrian

178
00:05:43,840 --> 00:05:47,440
winter peas so they're not going to look

179
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,280
a lot different but they've been

180
00:05:47,440 --> 00:05:52,479
selected to overwinter

181
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:54,240
uh in cold dry winters they were you

182
00:05:52,479 --> 00:05:56,000
know developed there in laramie wyoming

183
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:57,520
on the high plains and so

184
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
we think that it's going to be a better

185
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,960
pea our growers of these really like

186
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,360
them they like them better than the

187
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,960
regular austrians they have overwintered

188
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:07,280
consistently now

189
00:06:04,960 --> 00:06:09,120
for three years up in northern nebraska

190
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:10,880
where one of our growers are at

191
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:12,160
and so we're pretty excited about them

192
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:14,160
we think that it's going to be

193
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:15,199
our winter pea of the future you know

194
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:18,240
again for right now

195
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:20,080
if you look davis you can see there's a

196
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:23,520
number of these plants that have

197
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,000
some some burning on on the

198
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:27,759
down at the base i'm guessing that some

199
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:29,199
of the early growth that was out here

200
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:30,880
probably got cold enough to where it

201
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,440
froze off part of that

202
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,880
but again a win a peak and freeze

203
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:36,960
everything above the ground

204
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,479
off as long as the growing point under

205
00:06:36,960 --> 00:06:41,199
the ground has not frozen

206
00:06:38,479 --> 00:06:42,720
it will keep growing new shoots out and

207
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,319
so i'm guessing that what we're seeing

208
00:06:42,720 --> 00:06:46,000
is some of the early growth that kind of

209
00:06:44,319 --> 00:06:46,880
got singed a little bit with some cold

210
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,479
weather

211
00:06:46,880 --> 00:06:50,080
but they've grown out of it just fine

212
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,280
and i think they're going to continue to

213
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:53,199
to grow and

214
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:54,960
and we've actually behind these trees

215
00:06:53,199 --> 00:06:55,360
over here we have a few acres that we

216
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,199
may

217
00:06:55,360 --> 00:06:59,520
let grow out and see if we can harvest

218
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:02,080
some of these wild winter peas as well

219
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:02,560
yeah even where you see the frost damage

220
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:04,240
you see

221
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,639
new shoots like keith is talking about

222
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,120
but you also see out of that same chute

223
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:11,840
actually significant growth even though

224
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,840
we've got the brown leaves below it

225
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:15,199
so right next to the winter peas we have

226
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:17,840
winter lentils

227
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,440
these are morton winter lentils it's

228
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,240
actually the only variety that i'm aware

229
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:24,639
of that is a true winter lentil

230
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:25,840
lentils are in the same family as peas

231
00:07:24,639 --> 00:07:28,000
and vetch

232
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:31,039
they are kind of the less aggressive

233
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
cousin i guess i would say to vetch

234
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:34,800
we've actually seen pretty good

235
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,080
consistent winter hardiness out of these

236
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:37,759
winter lentils

237
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:39,199
and again this year is no exception

238
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,599
pretty good stand

239
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:42,319
lentils are never going to take over a

240
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,639
plot

241
00:07:42,319 --> 00:07:46,800
they don't vine like a vetch does they

242
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:48,080
kind of stay a little bit more contained

243
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:49,919
within themselves

244
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,199
but they're a really good companion crop

245
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,199
you're not going to get great weed

246
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,879
control from lentils by themselves

247
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:56,160
so we would never unless you're trying

248
00:07:54,879 --> 00:07:58,479
to grow them for seed we would never

249
00:07:56,160 --> 00:08:01,039
want to see you put lentils in alone

250
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,560
but they're a nice companion crop to

251
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:04,400
other mixes that you would do

252
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,680
so we sell more spring lentils and

253
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:07,840
winter lentils

254
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,720
but these winter lentils did really well

255
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:10,800
this year

256
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,639
yeah certainly something to put in a mix

257
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:15,599
because you can see it establishes

258
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:17,440
beautifully but if you're wanting to

259
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:18,319
plant a cover crop primarily for weed

260
00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:20,879
suppression

261
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,759
i certainly wouldn't count on lentils

262
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:23,440
alone

263
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,599
all right davis now we come to hairy

264
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:27,840
vetch cherryvatch

265
00:08:25,599 --> 00:08:29,840
know we touted as the most reliable

266
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:32,080
overwintering of all legumes

267
00:08:29,840 --> 00:08:33,599
and and again we had good snow cover so

268
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:35,200
a lot of it did over winter

269
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:36,959
uh but we've got we've got some

270
00:08:35,200 --> 00:08:38,640
interesting things to look at here in

271
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:41,839
the harry vetches so go ahead and

272
00:08:38,640 --> 00:08:43,519
and tell us what we've got planted here

273
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:45,760
right next to the cereals there we've

274
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,600
got woolly pod vetch

275
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:50,160
oftentimes we would consider that here

276
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,000
in nebraska more of a spring vetch

277
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:54,000
really good drought resistance and we

278
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:55,120
use it in a lot of places in the country

279
00:08:54,000 --> 00:08:58,000
a lot of different times of the year i

280
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:59,760
think next to it is spanish vetch and

281
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,320
i'll let you talk more about that one

282
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,279
but then as we get into the true hairy

283
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:06,880
vetches here

284
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:10,240
we have a you merit i'm standing in the

285
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:12,640
montana hairy vetch then next to me is

286
00:09:10,240 --> 00:09:14,080
the winter king and next to that in

287
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,839
between

288
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:17,360
the winter king and the lentils is

289
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:18,800
purple bounty

290
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:20,720
yeah so i'll just kind of compare and

291
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:21,360
contrast these a little bit so starting

292
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,440
over

293
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:24,480
uh with the woolly pod like like davis

294
00:09:23,440 --> 00:09:26,800
said it it's

295
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:30,480
it's actually not a true winter annual

296
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:33,519
it's a very cold tolerant spring annual

297
00:09:30,480 --> 00:09:35,279
again some of the best overwintering

298
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,440
wooly pod veg that we've seen if you're

299
00:09:35,279 --> 00:09:39,600
going to plant a vetch in the springtime

300
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:41,839
it's one of the most aggressive fastest

301
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:43,440
growing biggest biomass vetches you can

302
00:09:41,839 --> 00:09:45,360
plant in the spring

303
00:09:43,440 --> 00:09:47,200
the spanish fetch frankly is a little

304
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
disappointing to me this is

305
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:50,320
hairy vetch that we brought in from

306
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,080
spain

307
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:53,760
we knew that it probably doesn't have as

308
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:55,600
good a cold tolerance

309
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,200
and we're seeing that even you know it

310
00:09:55,600 --> 00:09:59,200
has less cold tolerance

311
00:09:57,200 --> 00:10:00,880
evidently than even wooly pod i think

312
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:02,640
it's going to be a good batch as long as

313
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,399
we keep it further south to where the

314
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:06,560
winters are going to be more mild it's

315
00:10:04,399 --> 00:10:08,399
definitely a less expensive one

316
00:10:06,560 --> 00:10:10,959
so we're going to just keep it in the

317
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,920
south the two nicest ones

318
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:16,160
out here by far as we look at the plots

319
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:18,160
are they are the au merit

320
00:10:16,160 --> 00:10:20,240
in what we call our montana vetch and

321
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:21,279
and the montana vetch is obviously grown

322
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,079
in montana

323
00:10:21,279 --> 00:10:24,800
au merit is a is a fairly new hairy

324
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:27,279
vetch

325
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:29,040
uh it in the previous plots that we've

326
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:29,920
had it's the best hairy vetch that i've

327
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,320
ever seen

328
00:10:29,920 --> 00:10:34,160
uh we'll see how it does this year i i

329
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,279
say it in the montana are looking pretty

330
00:10:34,160 --> 00:10:37,440
similar right now

331
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,200
we are doing some seed production on au

332
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,399
merit this year we got licensed to be

333
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,240
able to do some of that

334
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
so we've never had very good supply of

335
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,720
it so i'm excited to have better supply

336
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,480
of both of these vetches they're both

337
00:10:46,720 --> 00:10:49,920
very aggressive growing they both have

338
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:51,680
overwintered quite well

339
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,680
eu merit looks a little better right

340
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:56,560
here in this area but as i look

341
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:58,000
down uh through the strips i'd say you

342
00:10:56,560 --> 00:10:59,839
know they're they're very similar the

343
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:00,720
montana bench maybe is even a little

344
00:10:59,839 --> 00:11:02,800
better

345
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:04,720
right now down that way so we'll we'll

346
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,279
really monitor this

347
00:11:04,720 --> 00:11:09,279
keep an eye on it and then we'll

348
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:11,200
definitely be collecting biomass samples

349
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:13,200
of a lot of these as well to see what

350
00:11:11,200 --> 00:11:15,920
kind of nitrogen fixation

351
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:17,440
production we've gotten in biomass

352
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:20,640
accumulation

353
00:11:17,440 --> 00:11:22,560
the winter king winter king is a variety

354
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:25,200
that was developed more for

355
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:26,800
eastern wet winters where they don't get

356
00:11:25,200 --> 00:11:27,680
as cold but they're going to have more

357
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:29,839
freeze thaw

358
00:11:27,680 --> 00:11:32,959
cycles that's a little bit different

359
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:34,959
type of overwintering mechanism needed

360
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,120
i will see if it fills in it it doesn't

361
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,640
look as good as these others right now

362
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:40,240
there's a stand there it just doesn't

363
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:42,480
have quite as much growth

364
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,560
and then the purple bounty one over here

365
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:46,160
uh it's touted as being the earliest

366
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:48,320
hairy vetch on the market

367
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:50,240
uh i would predict that we'll see it

368
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:51,920
bloom earlier than all these others but

369
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:53,920
we want to keep a really close eye on

370
00:11:51,920 --> 00:11:56,160
that and we'll make good notes

371
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:58,240
of when we see each one of these bloom

372
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:01,040
to verify that that really is one of the

373
00:11:58,240 --> 00:12:03,519
earliest maturing vetches on the market

374
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:04,480
the winter king last year we had it in

375
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:06,880
our plots

376
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:08,160
and it looked about the same here in

377
00:12:06,880 --> 00:12:11,680
comparison to the other

378
00:12:08,160 --> 00:12:13,360
vetches but it actually came on these

379
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,800
next few weeks a little bit quicker than

380
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:16,639
some of the others and so i

381
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,480
expect that one too even though it looks

382
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:20,480
the furthest behind out of these four

383
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,160
um i'm excited to see that in a couple

384
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:23,120
weeks yeah that'll be good to see how

385
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:25,519
they how they doing

386
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:27,200
over the next several weeks all right

387
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:28,800
now we come to the king of all cover

388
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,279
crops and that's cereal rye

389
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:32,480
cereal rye is the most widely used cover

390
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,800
crop

391
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,480
both within green cover seed and also

392
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:37,360
within the cover crop industry as a

393
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:39,839
whole

394
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,880
mostly because you it's so cold tolerant

395
00:12:39,839 --> 00:12:43,760
it's so aggressive

396
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:44,240
growing this time of year in the spring

397
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,800
it just

398
00:12:44,240 --> 00:12:48,320
can't be beat when it comes to that now

399
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:50,399
we've told many of you

400
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:52,399
many times that there's a big difference

401
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:53,279
between l albon rye which is where i'm

402
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,440
standing

403
00:12:53,279 --> 00:12:56,959
and all other types of rye and this is

404
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:58,720
going to be a great video

405
00:12:56,959 --> 00:13:00,160
to show that we're not just blowing

406
00:12:58,720 --> 00:13:03,200
smoke when we say that

407
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,880
it's actually true this albon ride again

408
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:06,320
all planted at the same time right at

409
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,440
the very end of september

410
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:11,440
this elbon right here is you know 18 to

411
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,760
20 inches tall

412
00:13:11,440 --> 00:13:14,560
what we have over here is ryman rye

413
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:17,519
which is a

414
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:19,440
would be considered a northern canadian

415
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:22,639
dakota type rye

416
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:24,720
it is about 12 to 14 inches

417
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,720
at the most and then where davis is

418
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:28,560
standing here is our yankee rye

419
00:13:26,720 --> 00:13:30,160
which again is more of that northern

420
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:32,160
type and it's

421
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:34,639
it's about i would say it's similar to

422
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:38,079
the rhyme and maybe just slightly taller

423
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:41,199
but just elbon was bred for

424
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:44,000
oklahoma it was bred for maximum

425
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:44,639
fall growth and very very fast spring

426
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:46,160
growth

427
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:47,920
and you can definitely see that if you

428
00:13:46,160 --> 00:13:49,600
want something that's going to give you

429
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:51,760
the most growth the fastest in the

430
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:54,160
spring elbon is your go-to rye

431
00:13:51,760 --> 00:13:55,199
davis what's your observations here yeah

432
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,079
if you're wanting

433
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:59,519
quick growth as soon as possible maybe

434
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:01,040
you're grazing cattle early in the

435
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
spring

436
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,639
elbon is a man amongst boys when it

437
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:07,680
comes to ryze and all other

438
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:10,240
all other forage options really

439
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:11,760
but i think we talked too about how it's

440
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:14,720
not necessarily just about

441
00:14:11,760 --> 00:14:16,560
early growth or biggest growth maybe

442
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:19,680
maybe some of these uh

443
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:21,120
shorter stature options right now um fit

444
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,800
better in a

445
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:24,160
in a roller crimping situation for

446
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:26,000
hitting a different window

447
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,000
yeah yeah if you're if you're not

448
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:30,480
planting corn until the middle of may

449
00:14:28,000 --> 00:14:31,839
this stuff may be too far ahead for you

450
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,839
you may need to go with either a

451
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:35,920
northern rye or even a triticale which

452
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:38,639
we'll look at here next

453
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,320
this can get out too far ahead of you

454
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:42,160
but again for the cattle guy that wants

455
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,399
grazing as soon as possible

456
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:45,600
man you just can't beat albon for that

457
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,839
and and again it's

458
00:14:45,600 --> 00:14:49,519
you know it's winter hardiness is proven

459
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:51,680
uh you know could you take it up to

460
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:54,560
canada and have overwintering every year

461
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:55,680
i don't know uh but you know certainly

462
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
for nebraska

463
00:14:55,680 --> 00:14:59,440
and south and and we're growing it in

464
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:01,680
south dakota we've got growers growing

465
00:14:59,440 --> 00:15:03,600
albon forests up in the dakotas

466
00:15:01,680 --> 00:15:05,519
so we know it moves north but it's just

467
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,120
hard to beat when it comes to that early

468
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:08,720
fast aggressive growth

469
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,440
and this will be the first one that will

470
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:12,000
be to a stage where it can reliably roll

471
00:15:11,440 --> 00:15:14,160
down

472
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:15,600
as well so again we'll continue to

473
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:17,120
monitor this and we'll see what the

474
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,680
differences are here in a couple of

475
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:20,480
weeks

476
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,800
one other note on these ryes you have to

477
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:23,519
look

478
00:15:20,800 --> 00:15:25,920
pretty hard in these rows to find a weed

479
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:27,760
whereas in some of the other rows uh

480
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,600
the weeds even from the camera are

481
00:15:27,760 --> 00:15:31,600
probably a little bit more visible

482
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:33,360
um here there's just a big difference

483
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:34,800
and it's not just a matter of this being

484
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:37,040
taller and you can't see them

485
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:38,720
um it's just significantly better at

486
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:40,320
weed suppressing

487
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:41,680
all right now we're in the triticale

488
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:43,680
plots and i think we've got five

489
00:15:41,680 --> 00:15:45,680
different types of triticale here so

490
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:46,959
davis go ahead and set the table on what

491
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:49,920
we've got planted here

492
00:15:46,959 --> 00:15:51,680
next to keith there we have forage fx

493
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:54,079
1001

494
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:55,839
right here is thor triticale i'm

495
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:59,279
standing in the fridge

496
00:15:55,839 --> 00:16:00,639
next to me here is the 813 and then we

497
00:15:59,279 --> 00:16:02,959
have surge

498
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:04,720
as the last of these five so i'll just

499
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,120
tell you a little bit of the background

500
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,120
on

501
00:16:05,120 --> 00:16:08,160
on all these first of all they all

502
00:16:07,120 --> 00:16:09,680
they'll look great

503
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,279
uh they all came through the winter

504
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,839
really well uh

505
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,480
they're they're obviously smaller

506
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:16,560
shorter

507
00:16:14,480 --> 00:16:17,839
less growth than the rye uh not

508
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:19,920
surprising it's what we

509
00:16:17,839 --> 00:16:21,040
would expect you know we're only looking

510
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:24,000
at uh you know

511
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:26,000
8 to 10 inches of growth right now but

512
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:26,880
we know that that's just how triticale

513
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,920
is so

514
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,759
the forage fx 1001

515
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:34,079
is one of the nicest triticales i've

516
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:35,600
seen especially as you go from where we

517
00:16:34,079 --> 00:16:37,360
are here in nebraska

518
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:38,880
and you go north this this thing was

519
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:41,040
bred in montana

520
00:16:38,880 --> 00:16:42,480
and it's a real workhorse it's it's

521
00:16:41,040 --> 00:16:44,399
truly a

522
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:46,560
beardless triticale it's going to be a

523
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:48,480
really beautiful smooth looking crop

524
00:16:46,560 --> 00:16:51,680
when it heads out

525
00:16:48,480 --> 00:16:53,440
and very good growth and and tonnage it

526
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:55,680
you know again they all overwintered

527
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:58,399
great because we had that snow cover

528
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:59,920
had we had more of an open uh ground

529
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:02,000
when it got so cold

530
00:16:59,920 --> 00:17:03,759
i would have expected this one to look

531
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,199
the best it's going to have the best

532
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:08,000
cold hardiness of any of these

533
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:11,039
triticales in my opinion

534
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:14,400
uh the thor thor is

535
00:17:11,039 --> 00:17:16,480
a brand new one from trical

536
00:17:14,400 --> 00:17:18,079
which we we grow a lot of tri-cal

537
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,039
products

538
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:23,839
thor is a new one that is fully

539
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:26,559
facultative and what facultative means

540
00:17:23,839 --> 00:17:28,559
is that it can act as a spring type or

541
00:17:26,559 --> 00:17:30,720
it can act as a winter type so it can

542
00:17:28,559 --> 00:17:32,720
vernalize go dormant and come back in

543
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,320
the spring like it's done here

544
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,679
but we could be planting we're selling

545
00:17:34,320 --> 00:17:38,080
thor to people and they're planting it

546
00:17:35,679 --> 00:17:39,520
right now it does not have to vernalize

547
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:40,960
in order to give you all the growth

548
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:43,280
potential that it has

549
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,120
so it's a very versatile one we're

550
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:46,960
pretty excited about it it's going to be

551
00:17:45,120 --> 00:17:49,200
a replacement for the surge

552
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:51,039
they look fairly similar it's a newer

553
00:17:49,200 --> 00:17:53,039
type triticale though so it's got better

554
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,919
disease resistances

555
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:57,840
bred into it so we anticipate this one

556
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,320
being a really good replacement for the

557
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,720
surge that we've had

558
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:04,720
this is fridge fridge is just kind of

559
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:06,960
the old school standby

560
00:18:04,720 --> 00:18:09,520
it's a public variety so you know you

561
00:18:06,960 --> 00:18:11,280
may see more people selling it

562
00:18:09,520 --> 00:18:13,039
typically what we see with fridge is

563
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,880
it's always kind of there

564
00:18:13,039 --> 00:18:16,559
but it's never going to yield or have

565
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:17,840
the performance and i think you can even

566
00:18:16,559 --> 00:18:20,000
see that here

567
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:21,919
it just it's not as robust it's not as

568
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,039
green it's not as tall

569
00:18:21,919 --> 00:18:26,799
as these other newer type varieties

570
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:28,320
but if you're not looking to maximize

571
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:30,720
your forage and you're just looking for

572
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:33,360
a little bit less expensive triticale

573
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:34,640
the fridge is not a bad way to go and

574
00:18:33,360 --> 00:18:36,640
then we come to 813

575
00:18:34,640 --> 00:18:38,480
813 has has been our top selling

576
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:39,120
triticale over the last four or five

577
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,720
years

578
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:43,600
it's kind of been one of the flagship

579
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:47,200
products in the tri-cal lineup

580
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:50,640
we grow and sell lots of 813.

581
00:18:47,200 --> 00:18:52,799
813 is partially facultative so

582
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:55,280
when you plant it in the spring it's not

583
00:18:52,799 --> 00:18:56,960
going to be as good as thor or surge

584
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,600
but it's going to be better than fridge

585
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,799
or any of the cereal rise for sure

586
00:18:59,600 --> 00:19:04,480
as you move this south it has because

587
00:19:02,799 --> 00:19:06,880
it's partially facultative

588
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:08,559
it will have more fall growth in the

589
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:10,320
south and it will get going in the

590
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:13,200
spring a little quicker than a true

591
00:19:10,320 --> 00:19:13,919
winter type uh like the like the forage

592
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:16,799
fx

593
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:19,760
i wouldn't take that one south uh as far

594
00:19:16,799 --> 00:19:21,360
as what i would take 813 or the thor so

595
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:23,039
again excited to see what this is going

596
00:19:21,360 --> 00:19:23,679
to look like as we grow out a little bit

597
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:26,160
more

598
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:26,880
and then of course the surge surge has

599
00:19:26,160 --> 00:19:29,280
been our

600
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:30,799
facultative or spring treated cayley for

601
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,160
a number of years now

602
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:34,480
we're going to be phasing that out

603
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:36,720
because we're replacing it with the thor

604
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:38,559
all right davis now we're standing in in

605
00:19:36,720 --> 00:19:40,000
the wheat plots and typically we don't

606
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:42,400
think of wheat

607
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:44,559
as being as much of a forage crop as

608
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:45,600
what rye or triticale but these first

609
00:19:44,559 --> 00:19:47,520
two

610
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:48,720
are our forage wheats they've been

611
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:51,039
specially

612
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:52,320
bred to have a lot of forage so tell us

613
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,679
the difference

614
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,440
in the types of wheats that we have here

615
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:57,840
tell us what we got planted right there

616
00:19:55,440 --> 00:20:00,480
is the t173 wheat

617
00:19:57,840 --> 00:20:01,520
and then here is the willow creek this

618
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,840
may be the later

619
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,919
maturing one so the t-173 is a little

620
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:09,679
bit taller right now

621
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,520
but i think the willow creek might

622
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:12,400
actually be tillered just a little bit

623
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:15,039
more

624
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,159
as from a distance you see it more as a

625
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:17,840
carpet rather than

626
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:20,159
being able to see the defined rows with

627
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,200
the t-173

628
00:20:20,159 --> 00:20:26,400
and then over here we've got gore wheat

629
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,799
and hard red wheat yeah so just

630
00:20:26,400 --> 00:20:30,679
real briefly davis is you're exactly

631
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,720
right this is a fairly new wheat the

632
00:20:30,679 --> 00:20:34,640
t173

633
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,159
a forage wheat and actually a lot of

634
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:38,080
people are growing this one for grain

635
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,159
too it's it's done pretty well

636
00:20:38,080 --> 00:20:42,159
uh these forage wheats especially this

637
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:44,240
willow creek right where i'm standing

638
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,679
the the place where we would use willow

639
00:20:44,240 --> 00:20:48,799
creek is when we want

640
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:50,880
a a winter cereal like this

641
00:20:48,799 --> 00:20:53,280
and we want to have grazing as deep into

642
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:56,720
the late spring early summer as possible

643
00:20:53,280 --> 00:20:58,559
this is the longest maturing

644
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:00,240
of all of the cereals in this plot and

645
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:01,120
when we come out here several weeks

646
00:21:00,240 --> 00:21:02,640
later

647
00:21:01,120 --> 00:21:04,400
you're just going to see that this one

648
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,840
is going to look a little slower

649
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:07,440
it's just because it's got a longer

650
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:08,640
growing season it will eventually

651
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:10,720
probably be as big as

652
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,640
many of the ryes and triticales it's

653
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,400
just going to take longer to get there

654
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,320
and so the reason you'd want to do that

655
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,919
is if you're staging your grazing

656
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:19,520
you would have a willow creek field to

657
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:21,520
go to last

658
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,520
that would be the main advantage of it

659
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,120
the t173 is definitely going to be a

660
00:21:23,520 --> 00:21:27,360
better fit from nebraska

661
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:29,520
and south the willow creek may be a

662
00:21:27,360 --> 00:21:31,840
better fit from nebraska and north

663
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,600
kind of kind of yet to be seen willow

664
00:21:31,840 --> 00:21:37,520
creek has montana genetics the t-173

665
00:21:35,600 --> 00:21:39,760
i think is coming from this either

666
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,400
kansas or oklahoma i'm not 100

667
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:44,240
sure gore is probably one of the most

668
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,159
widely used uh

669
00:21:44,240 --> 00:21:47,600
beardless and by the way these are all

670
00:21:46,159 --> 00:21:50,400
beardless except for this

671
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:52,159
just regular hard red winter wheat gore

672
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:54,880
is probably the most widely used

673
00:21:52,159 --> 00:21:56,400
beardless and it's actually a soft red

674
00:21:54,880 --> 00:21:59,200
winter wheat

675
00:21:56,400 --> 00:22:00,960
used in oklahoma and south we put it in

676
00:21:59,200 --> 00:22:02,400
our plots up here not necessarily

677
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:04,320
expecting a lot

678
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:06,720
because a lot of years we would see

679
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:08,400
significant winter kill damage on it

680
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:10,080
but again with the snow cover we're not

681
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:11,200
seeing that this year so it'll be

682
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:13,919
interesting to see

683
00:22:11,200 --> 00:22:15,919
how it grows out and it compares a very

684
00:22:13,919 --> 00:22:18,559
good grazing weed it's widely used

685
00:22:15,919 --> 00:22:20,400
across the state of oklahoma for grazing

686
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,600
and then of course just regular hard red

687
00:22:20,400 --> 00:22:23,039
winter wheat that

688
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,440
you know guys would plant this would be

689
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,159
more of a grain type and not a forage

690
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,760
type so

691
00:22:26,159 --> 00:22:30,240
as these grow we'll be able to kind of

692
00:22:27,760 --> 00:22:31,520
compare growth stages and biomass

693
00:22:30,240 --> 00:22:33,520
accumulations

694
00:22:31,520 --> 00:22:34,559
all right winter oats davis these aren't

695
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,960
supposed to overwinter

696
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:38,240
here in nebraska we kind of we put them

697
00:22:36,960 --> 00:22:39,760
in every year

698
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:41,360
just to show people that you shouldn't

699
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:42,640
plant them this far north if you want

700
00:22:41,360 --> 00:22:44,400
them to overwinter

701
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:46,000
and again the snow cover is proving us

702
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,559
wrong so we didn't have a great

703
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:50,400
test of winter hardiness but it goes to

704
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:52,799
show you if you have snow cover

705
00:22:50,400 --> 00:22:53,760
temperature really doesn't matter we've

706
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,280
got the cossack

707
00:22:53,760 --> 00:22:59,280
black oats here which are very popular

708
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,080
especially in the south it's more of a

709
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:04,159
forage type oat than a regular white oat

710
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,200
we wouldn't plant these generally in the

711
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:06,880
spring

712
00:23:05,200 --> 00:23:08,880
we would be planting these in the late

713
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:09,440
summer and letting them grow deeper into

714
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:12,400
the winter

715
00:23:09,440 --> 00:23:14,320
excellent forage oat is probably going

716
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:14,880
to give you more biomass and tonnage

717
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:17,600
than a

718
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:19,919
white spring oat overall when planted in

719
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,600
you know that august type time frame

720
00:23:19,919 --> 00:23:24,640
and then bob winter oats is just kind of

721
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:27,919
an old standby uh winter white oat

722
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:29,600
they both look really pretty good um

723
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:31,280
you know i you know we'll see how they

724
00:23:29,600 --> 00:23:32,880
grow the one thing that i

725
00:23:31,280 --> 00:23:35,039
have noticed right here and if you're

726
00:23:32,880 --> 00:23:37,280
looking not nearly as good a weed

727
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:38,480
control as what we saw over in the rye

728
00:23:37,280 --> 00:23:40,320
plots you just want to make a few

729
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:43,840
comments on that

730
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:45,600
yeah i mean maybe it's a little bit of

731
00:23:43,840 --> 00:23:47,440
the allopathic effect

732
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,880
maybe it's a little bit i would say

733
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:52,880
mostly just because

734
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,880
it's not as full it's not as tall so

735
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,120
it's simply not suppressing the weeds as

736
00:23:54,880 --> 00:24:00,159
well from that standpoint

737
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,080
i think the cossack oats are just a

738
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:03,679
little bit fuller

739
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:05,840
filling the road gaps just a little bit

740
00:24:03,679 --> 00:24:06,240
more than we have here in the bob oats

741
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:08,240
but

742
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,919
like you said last year we had these in

743
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:13,840
the plots and we had pretty much nothing

744
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:15,440
winter barley davis tell us what we've

745
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:17,679
got here

746
00:24:15,440 --> 00:24:19,520
keith is standing in the valor barley

747
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:22,720
and i'm here in the 919

748
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:25,279
barley the 919 is probably the one that

749
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,520
we use more of right now

750
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:28,559
but what do you see for differences in

751
00:24:27,520 --> 00:24:31,440
genetics

752
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:33,279
yeah you know they look fairly similar

753
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,200
right now

754
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:37,120
it's a little hard to tell the valor

755
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:37,440
maybe looks like it has a bit of an edge

756
00:24:37,120 --> 00:24:39,360
but

757
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,200
you know we'll see as they go along

758
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:42,640
valor is a fairly new one we don't know

759
00:24:41,200 --> 00:24:44,240
a lot about it yet we've

760
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:47,679
had some production done down in

761
00:24:44,240 --> 00:24:49,840
oklahoma on it it looks pretty promising

762
00:24:47,679 --> 00:24:52,159
919 has kind of been our stand by winter

763
00:24:49,840 --> 00:24:53,120
barley but it's kind of susceptible to

764
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,760
smut

765
00:24:53,120 --> 00:24:57,600
in in the springtime as it grows and

766
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:59,279
matures so we're looking for something

767
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:00,480
that maybe has a little better disease

768
00:24:59,279 --> 00:25:02,960
resistance

769
00:25:00,480 --> 00:25:04,720
we don't know valor is that 919 comes

770
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:06,400
out of the university of nebraska winter

771
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,320
barley breeding program

772
00:25:06,400 --> 00:25:09,919
and i know that they've got some coming

773
00:25:08,320 --> 00:25:10,400
that are going to be replacements for

774
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:12,000
this

775
00:25:10,400 --> 00:25:14,000
there's lots of winter barleys on the

776
00:25:12,000 --> 00:25:14,720
market out there the thing that make

777
00:25:14,000 --> 00:25:16,880
these two

778
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:18,320
unique is that they're beardless they're

779
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:19,600
beardless barleys and if you've ever

780
00:25:18,320 --> 00:25:21,760
seen winter barley

781
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:23,600
that's not beardless i mean you're

782
00:25:21,760 --> 00:25:26,320
talking about a beard those things have

783
00:25:23,600 --> 00:25:28,000
you know five six eight inch long beards

784
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,240
would be very dangerous to graze

785
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,600
them be would not make very good hay

786
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:34,880
because of those long

787
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:36,240
beards and so the only barleys that we

788
00:25:34,880 --> 00:25:37,760
want to offer are going to be the

789
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,919
beardless barleys because

790
00:25:37,760 --> 00:25:41,679
a lot of what we sell goes into grazing

791
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:43,440
and forage type mixes so

792
00:25:41,679 --> 00:25:44,960
we're only looking at those there's like

793
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:46,720
say there's lots of other barleys out

794
00:25:44,960 --> 00:25:50,080
there but the beardless ones

795
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:51,360
there's not that many of all right and

796
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:54,080
and finally we have

797
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:56,480
annual ryegrass this is a winterhawk

798
00:25:54,080 --> 00:25:58,159
annual ryegrass which is a example of a

799
00:25:56,480 --> 00:26:00,159
diploid type

800
00:25:58,159 --> 00:26:01,919
which are the most winter hardy of all

801
00:26:00,159 --> 00:26:04,960
annual rye grasses but

802
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,559
annual ryegrasses as a family just are

803
00:26:04,960 --> 00:26:07,679
not going to be nearly as winter hardy

804
00:26:06,559 --> 00:26:09,760
as the rest of

805
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:11,679
the cereals and you can see that i mean

806
00:26:09,760 --> 00:26:13,520
this actually looks pretty good

807
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:15,679
for being planted at the end of

808
00:26:13,520 --> 00:26:16,640
september one of the keys to getting

809
00:26:15,679 --> 00:26:20,159
annual rye grass

810
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:22,000
over winter is getting it established

811
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,840
unlike rye which you can throw out there

812
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:24,960
in december and it's going to be fine

813
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:27,200
this time of year

814
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:28,720
annual ryegrass has to get some root

815
00:26:27,200 --> 00:26:30,960
system established

816
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:33,600
in order to survive through the winter

817
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:36,159
and so planted the end of september

818
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,640
is not as good of time as if you could

819
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:40,960
get it planted early september

820
00:26:38,640 --> 00:26:41,919
in having good rye grass establishment

821
00:26:40,960 --> 00:26:43,919
so you know

822
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,760
for for all things considered this isn't

823
00:26:43,919 --> 00:26:47,600
bad and it will fill in it's it's going

824
00:26:45,760 --> 00:26:50,960
to grow pretty aggressively here

825
00:26:47,600 --> 00:26:53,279
once it warms up it's just not a

826
00:26:50,960 --> 00:26:54,080
it's not as popular especially in drier

827
00:26:53,279 --> 00:26:56,400
areas

828
00:26:54,080 --> 00:26:57,919
because a lot of annual ryegrass has

829
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:59,520
flown on

830
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:01,279
in the eastern corn belt because the

831
00:26:59,520 --> 00:27:02,000
rains that they get they can get it

832
00:27:01,279 --> 00:27:04,080
coming up

833
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:06,000
before they harvest the corn then they

834
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:06,960
can get that earlier establishment and

835
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,320
they have

836
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:12,159
a better overwintering success so what

837
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:14,880
are you seeing here davis

838
00:27:12,159 --> 00:27:15,360
yeah last year again when we didn't have

839
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,679
the

840
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:18,799
winter cover the snowfall that we had

841
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:20,720
this year

842
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:22,720
we didn't see much of this winter hawk

843
00:27:20,720 --> 00:27:25,760
again that's probably mostly timing

844
00:27:22,720 --> 00:27:29,039
as opposed to the plant itself

845
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:30,720
but pretty decent right here probably

846
00:27:29,039 --> 00:27:32,399
one that we would put more so

847
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:34,000
in a mix with some other grasses and

848
00:27:32,399 --> 00:27:35,360
some other options rather than counting

849
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:37,120
on it alone

850
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:38,960
we really like it for compaction

851
00:27:37,120 --> 00:27:40,559
breaking though and we put it in many

852
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:42,960
compaction breaking mixes

853
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:44,559
uh both the diploid and the tetraploid

854
00:27:42,960 --> 00:27:45,679
options yeah it's got a very deep root

855
00:27:44,559 --> 00:27:47,840
system so even though

856
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:49,600
it's even when we come back out here

857
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,640
later it's going to be the shortest of

858
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:52,640
all of these

859
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,960
it may still have just as deeper roots

860
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:57,360
as any of them it's very deep rooting

861
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,720
and that's one of its uh most attractive

862
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,760
features

863
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:05,760
all right so now we have three

864
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:07,520
different combinations of albon rye

865
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:09,919
and harry vetch and i'm assuming this is

866
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,080
probably the montana hairy vetch

867
00:28:09,919 --> 00:28:13,440
it's what we probably most commonly use

868
00:28:12,080 --> 00:28:14,880
here uh and

869
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,919
and we're not going to go into a lot of

870
00:28:14,880 --> 00:28:20,559
detail in this episode we're evaluating

871
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:22,159
uh what kind of nitrogen production what

872
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,840
kind of weed suppression

873
00:28:22,159 --> 00:28:25,440
and what kind of biomass we're going to

874
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,520
get from different rates of

875
00:28:25,440 --> 00:28:28,640
l bond rye and hairy vet so we've got a

876
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:31,440
strip here

877
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:33,360
strip here and a strip over here and you

878
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:36,640
know as i'm looking at this rye

879
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:38,960
you know it's it's 18 to 20 inches tall

880
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:40,720
i i actually i was measuring the other l

881
00:28:38,960 --> 00:28:42,720
but i think it's a little taller

882
00:28:40,720 --> 00:28:44,880
than the other l bond that's over there

883
00:28:42,720 --> 00:28:46,720
and the vetch is significantly

884
00:28:44,880 --> 00:28:48,080
bigger and taller than the monoculture

885
00:28:46,720 --> 00:28:50,720
vetch davis what's your

886
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,399
your initial thoughts on this yeah we've

887
00:28:50,720 --> 00:28:52,720
got the three rates like he said we've

888
00:28:52,399 --> 00:28:56,720
got

889
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:59,840
20 pounds hairy vetch 20 pounds rye 15

890
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,320
vetch i believe 30 rye and then we've

891
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:03,520
got

892
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:06,000
50 rye 10 vetch

893
00:29:03,520 --> 00:29:07,440
yeah it's amazing just seeing the

894
00:29:06,000 --> 00:29:08,880
difference of the vetch

895
00:29:07,440 --> 00:29:12,559
when it's able to have something to

896
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:14,240
climb it at least looks a lot taller

897
00:29:12,559 --> 00:29:15,600
we'll see if we actually have a

898
00:29:14,240 --> 00:29:18,559
different amount of

899
00:29:15,600 --> 00:29:19,360
biomass we'll do some biomass cuttings

900
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:22,080
of these

901
00:29:19,360 --> 00:29:23,919
and test the carbon nitrogen ratio we

902
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,480
really liked last year how the

903
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:27,600
hairy vetch and rye crimped together and

904
00:29:26,480 --> 00:29:29,840
so we'll see

905
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,520
what the results show in a couple months

906
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:33,919
again very good stands

907
00:29:31,520 --> 00:29:36,320
a little really looking forward to what

908
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:38,159
we see as these grow out

909
00:29:36,320 --> 00:29:40,320
at the end of every plot we have to have

910
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,159
what we call the vacuum cleaner mix so

911
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:42,960
davis explain what we've got going on

912
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:45,600
here

913
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:49,200
as we're planting these plots we planted

914
00:29:45,600 --> 00:29:51,360
all the grasses first and the legumes

915
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:52,399
what we do as we're vacuuming out the

916
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,039
drill

917
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:56,000
that the reservoir is filling up with

918
00:29:55,039 --> 00:29:58,080
all the seeds

919
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:59,600
we mix that up at the end and then we

920
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:01,840
plant it and we've got it around the

921
00:29:59,600 --> 00:30:04,720
back side of the strips as well

922
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:06,320
and it's a great way to just showcase

923
00:30:04,720 --> 00:30:07,679
what happens when we plant things in

924
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:09,279
diversity because

925
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:12,080
here we've got all the different kinds

926
00:30:09,279 --> 00:30:15,360
of cereals i see rye grass in here

927
00:30:12,080 --> 00:30:18,559
we have hairy vetch and peas which

928
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:21,600
again like we maybe saw in the mixes

929
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:23,440
or the rye and veg combinations it's

930
00:30:21,600 --> 00:30:24,159
just climbing it has something to climb

931
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:27,840
so it's

932
00:30:24,159 --> 00:30:30,720
it appears taller it fills in

933
00:30:27,840 --> 00:30:31,440
really nicely we even have winter

934
00:30:30,720 --> 00:30:34,799
lentils

935
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,360
and the clovers in here just a little

936
00:30:34,799 --> 00:30:38,880
bit

937
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:40,960
so it's just beautiful and i think it

938
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:43,200
provides a lot of good grazing

939
00:30:40,960 --> 00:30:44,480
maybe a little bit more balanced ration

940
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,640
and

941
00:30:44,480 --> 00:30:47,919
this i mean as you look down the road

942
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,559
too it's just

943
00:30:47,919 --> 00:30:51,120
exceptional growth and i think this one

944
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:52,480
would be

945
00:30:51,120 --> 00:30:53,679
good to take some samples on a little

946
00:30:52,480 --> 00:30:55,440
bit later yeah i mean there's just such

947
00:30:53,679 --> 00:30:57,679
great power and diversity

948
00:30:55,440 --> 00:30:59,200
and again as we as davis said we'll take

949
00:30:57,679 --> 00:31:00,640
the samples

950
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:03,120
i wish there was a better way we could

951
00:31:00,640 --> 00:31:03,679
sample the roots and the root exudates

952
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:05,360
and the

953
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,519
biology that's surrounding that

954
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:08,000
rhizosphere i don't know that we have

955
00:31:07,519 --> 00:31:10,240
the

956
00:31:08,000 --> 00:31:11,279
the technology to to really do that

957
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,320
effectively yet

958
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,840
it's coming i think but we just we know

959
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:19,280
that this is doing great things for the

960
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:25,909
soil because of all this diversity

961
00:31:19,280 --> 00:31:25,909
[Music]

962
00:32:57,120 --> 00:32:59,200
