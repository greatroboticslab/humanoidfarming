1
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,139
To successfully compete in a growing

2
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:12,120
market, dairy farms are focused on

3
00:00:10,139 --> 00:00:14,700
production efficiency, a significant goal

4
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,560
of which is digital technology. One

5
00:00:14,700 --> 00:00:18,480
farm that has successfully implemented

6
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,160
digital technology is located in the

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,400
Almaty region of southern Kazakhstan and has been

8
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,859
operating since 2002. Digitalization

9
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,779
arrived here only 11 years after its

10
00:00:25,859 --> 00:00:30,480
launch.

11
00:00:27,779 --> 00:00:33,660
Humans are not needed there. The operator only

12
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,000
enters to ensure that the cow enters, and the

13
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:38,160
rest is

14
00:00:36,000 --> 00:00:40,760
done by a robot. The milking process itself is handled by a robot. The total number of

15
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:40,760
 

16
00:00:41,420 --> 00:00:47,399
head of milk is 2,020, of which 600 are dairy cows. The

17
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:50,399
farm produces 20 tons of milk per day, or

18
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:52,100
about 33 liters per cow. To

19
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,660
service such a herd in the old-fashioned way, a

20
00:00:52,100 --> 00:00:57,120
large staff would be required: technicians,

21
00:00:54,660 --> 00:01:01,280
veterinarians, milkmaids, and cleaners. Today, the

22
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:01,280
main work is done by equipment. The

23
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:06,060
cow on the farm is surrounded by

24
00:01:03,979 --> 00:01:07,979
automated systems: water

25
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:10,020
is supplied in an automatic drinker, manure is removed by a

26
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:12,540
scraper unit, and combs are activated by

27
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,400
touch. In addition, the animal

28
00:01:12,540 --> 00:01:17,240
is constantly under constant

29
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:17,240
computer surveillance. The

30
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:23,840
cows have collars on their legs and

31
00:01:21,420 --> 00:01:25,979
motion sensors that simplify the work.  The

32
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,680
work of veterinarians

33
00:01:25,979 --> 00:01:31,920
turns out to be such a reason: we learn that a

34
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:34,080
cow is walking, and the assemblator looks at the

35
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:37,860
computer and can find out that the cow is

36
00:01:34,080 --> 00:01:39,720
walking and can be inseminated. All data on

37
00:01:37,860 --> 00:01:41,400
each animal in the herd is collected and

38
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,860
analyzed in the herd management program. The

39
00:01:41,400 --> 00:01:46,220
company's management has already felt the

40
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:49,259
benefits of introducing digital technologies:

41
00:01:46,220 --> 00:01:51,600
saving time and money. This can be

42
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:55,079
seen in the example of feeding.

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:56,479
When a cow approaches the robot,

44
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:59,880

45
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:03,240
separate feed is given to her, and it turns out that for each

46
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:05,399
cow this is individual. For example, if

47
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:08,220
this person were to give, he would not know.

48
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:09,959
For example, how much feed to give this cow,

49
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,120
since he does not know how much she is

50
00:02:09,959 --> 00:02:15,300
milking at the moment, and it turns out that the

51
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:18,660
robot completely calculates this and

52
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,780
gives her what she gives milk for, that is what they

53
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:23,300
give her feed for. It turns out that if, for example, a

54
00:02:21,780 --> 00:02:26,340
cow is given

55
00:02:23,300 --> 00:02:28,680
45-50 liters, yes, the amount of

56
00:02:26,340 --> 00:02:31,140
this feed should be two kilograms,

57
00:02:28,680 --> 00:02:33,840
if a little less, it turns out to be one and a half

58
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:37,280
kilograms, thereby we benefit from

59
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:39,739
not wasting feed just like that

60
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,640
[music] on the

61
00:02:39,739 --> 00:02:44,160
opposite side of Kazakhstan in the

62
00:02:41,640 --> 00:02:46,440
northern Kazakhstan region since 2019,

63
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:49,640
similar technologies have been introduced  Another

64
00:02:46,440 --> 00:02:49,640
dairy farm

65
00:02:50,120 --> 00:02:57,200
before approaching

66
00:02:52,940 --> 00:02:57,200
We traveled from Kazakhstan

67
00:02:59,050 --> 00:03:05,480
[music]

68
00:03:00,739 --> 00:03:05,480
We decided to build a modern

69
00:03:06,500 --> 00:03:10,200
automated garden management system

70
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,300
on a dairy farm in many ways similar

71
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:14,159
to another example, it also tracks

72
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:16,319
all the herd indicators and controls, in

73
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:18,599
particular, feeding, women make up

74
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,580
almost half of the farm workers play an

75
00:03:18,599 --> 00:03:22,560
important role in managing the system and

76
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:26,760
programs.

77
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:31,620
This is all the information after feeding,

78
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:33,599
it is transmitted via Wi-Fi to the main

79
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:35,060
computer here I can already look at the

80
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:38,659
reports,

81
00:03:35,060 --> 00:03:41,280
say for today or for

82
00:03:38,659 --> 00:03:43,620
yesterday, the

83
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,720
data for each animal is stored in

84
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:47,879
digital form, specialists know how much

85
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:49,980
milk each cow produces and what

86
00:03:47,879 --> 00:03:54,360
she eats, this information is especially

87
00:03:49,980 --> 00:03:58,140
useful when making a decision about the fall,

88
00:03:54,360 --> 00:04:01,459
we have such a report on nesterus,

89
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,920
these are the cows that have not been inseminated,

90
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,560
although they should have already been inseminated,

91
00:04:04,920 --> 00:04:10,340
there are, let's say, those cows that

92
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:14,360
have calved, she is already

93
00:04:10,340 --> 00:04:17,940
74 days old, she should have been inseminated a long time ago,

94
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:20,820
but she has not yet come into heat,

95
00:04:17,940 --> 00:04:23,520
that is, she either needs to be put on treatment

96
00:04:20,820 --> 00:04:25,020
or she needs to be looked at

97
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:27,419
[music]

98
00:04:25,020 --> 00:04:28,919
at this dairy commodity company, they also

99
00:04:27,419 --> 00:04:31,440
appreciated the economic advantages of

100
00:04:28,919 --> 00:04:33,300
digital technologies, which are expressed in  There are no

101
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:36,620
savings in staff time,

102
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:36,620
consumables, wages,

103
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:44,699
expenses, family expenses for effective

104
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:47,639
insemination, that's more and more, there are

105
00:04:44,699 --> 00:04:50,580
fewer overruns in our herd,

106
00:04:47,639 --> 00:04:52,500
and this accordingly affects the

107
00:04:50,580 --> 00:04:55,820
lactation period, the lactation period, and accordingly, the

108
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:55,820
economy as a whole, and so on,

109
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,199
for dairy farmers to

110
00:05:00,860 --> 00:05:07,080
achieve success in today's world.

111
00:05:03,919 --> 00:05:10,400
That is why successful dairy farmers

112
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:10,400
closely monitor the emergence of

113
00:05:16,190 --> 00:05:21,940
