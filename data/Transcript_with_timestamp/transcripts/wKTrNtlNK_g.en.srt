1
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:06,629
people are concerned about pesticide

2
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:08,429
safety they've heard stories about

3
00:00:06,629 --> 00:00:10,769
people getting cancers or other

4
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:12,750
illnesses due to the pesticide exposure

5
00:00:10,769 --> 00:00:14,280
and so we're gonna talk a little bit

6
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:16,770
about the time in which people get

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,720
exposed to those chemicals most often

8
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:20,460
that is going to be during the mixing

9
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:22,800
and loading portion of your pesticide

10
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,420
application one of the things we take a

11
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,730
look at is that are you using your

12
00:00:24,420 --> 00:00:28,019
personal protective equipment many of

13
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:29,730
the labels are actually most of the

14
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:31,050
labels are going to tell you what

15
00:00:29,730 --> 00:00:33,030
personal protective equipment is

16
00:00:31,050 --> 00:00:34,590
required if it's going to be chemical

17
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:36,510
resistant gloves if it's gonna be

18
00:00:34,590 --> 00:00:38,610
goggles or a face mask or maybe it's

19
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,010
that you wear long sleeve shirts or

20
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:43,649
maybe in this particular case a Tyvek

21
00:00:41,010 --> 00:00:45,570
suit when you're making certain

22
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:50,160
applications within your pesticide and

23
00:00:45,570 --> 00:00:52,770
program so mixing and loading why is it

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,660
so dangerous it's like most of us can

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:56,280
understand the concept if we stick the

26
00:00:54,660 --> 00:00:57,710
hose into a spray tank that there's

27
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:00,270
water that's going to go into the tank

28
00:00:57,710 --> 00:01:02,940
where we see most of the problem is

29
00:01:00,270 --> 00:01:04,830
though as we take our chemical we mix it

30
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,159
we measure it and then I will suddenly

31
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,869
want to watch it go into a spray tank

32
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,060
and then we get splashed back into our

33
00:01:09,869 --> 00:01:14,040
eyes unto our face and we have very high

34
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:17,280
concentrations of chemical to get on to

35
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:19,350
our body so you need to have the

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:22,310
personal protective equipment on to

37
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:25,259
protect yourself from those exposures

38
00:01:22,310 --> 00:01:26,490
also in mixing and loading we want to

39
00:01:25,259 --> 00:01:29,700
make sure that you're going to do things

40
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:32,220
correctly North Dakota like many states

41
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:35,130
puts out a weed control guy there's

42
00:01:32,220 --> 00:01:37,799
actually a formula on page 96 that will

43
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:38,430
tell you which of the products goes in

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,460
first

45
00:01:38,430 --> 00:01:44,579
and so apples is the formula that we use

46
00:01:41,460 --> 00:01:46,409
in agitate then you put the different

47
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:48,450
chemicals and add to the

48
00:01:46,409 --> 00:01:51,179
into the spray-paint in a particular

49
00:01:48,450 --> 00:01:53,520
order when we go out we start spraying

50
00:01:51,179 --> 00:01:55,350
you have to realize that even though it

51
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:57,329
chemical might be a restrictive use

52
00:01:55,350 --> 00:01:59,670
which is bidipi seen on the front of the

53
00:01:57,329 --> 00:02:01,770
label right by the label made these

54
00:01:59,670 --> 00:02:04,229
chemicals are going to be more dangerous

55
00:02:01,770 --> 00:02:06,030
because they're more persistent however

56
00:02:04,229 --> 00:02:09,390
that does not mean the general use of

57
00:02:06,030 --> 00:02:11,519
pesticides don't come with the gun with

58
00:02:09,390 --> 00:02:13,500
risk many of us had the conversation

59
00:02:11,519 --> 00:02:16,080
about glyphosate is it dangerous or is

60
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:18,110
it not dangerous so we are going to try

61
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:21,030
to teach you here is that it is your

62
00:02:18,110 --> 00:02:23,579
responsibility if you haven't received a

63
00:02:21,030 --> 00:02:26,099
pesticide license you're basically

64
00:02:23,579 --> 00:02:29,280
saying that you are going to read and

65
00:02:26,099 --> 00:02:30,750
follow the label many Extension agents

66
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,420
are people that have taught pesticide

67
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:35,489
classes emphasize that the label is the

68
00:02:33,420 --> 00:02:37,530
law and it's something that you have to

69
00:02:35,489 --> 00:02:41,190
do as an individual producer or

70
00:02:37,530 --> 00:02:42,629
applicator is to read it again I wish we

71
00:02:41,190 --> 00:02:44,940
would talk more with the general

72
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,069
applicators as well because the big

73
00:02:44,940 --> 00:02:49,980
story is about glyphosate which is not

74
00:02:47,069 --> 00:02:51,930
restricted use but there is still still

75
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,880
potential risk with it and it's because

76
00:02:51,930 --> 00:02:55,349
people don't read the label the chemical

77
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,359
companies has spent millions of dollars

78
00:02:55,349 --> 00:03:00,180
to figure out how to keep the

79
00:02:57,359 --> 00:03:02,609
applicators safe during those chemical

80
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,280
applications and now it's your job to

81
00:03:02,609 --> 00:03:08,180
read and follow the label like good

82
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,180
applicators would
