the Fig Tree scientifically known as FAS

17

00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:30,000
fig trees do not flower in the same way

00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:33,119
as apple and peach trees they the

22
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:35,240

23
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,799

34
00:02:12,080 --> 00:02:18,680
provide let's find out fig trees can be

00:02:15,519 --> 00:02:21,879
propagated in a variety of ways normally

00:02:18,680 --> 00:02:24,800
this plant is propagated by Farmers by

00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:28,879
grafting or cuting cuttings are selected

38
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:33,879
precisely about 20 to 30 cm bit long and

39
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:36,280
0.5 to 0.7 cm in thick the farmer

40
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:40,159
carefully cuts and plants these cuttings

41
00:02:36,280 --> 00:02:42,680
in pots fig trees thrive in both indoor

00:02:40,159 --> 00:02:45,400

ideal time for planting once your indoor

00:02:49,080 --> 00:02:54,879
transfer the rooted cuting to a larger

combination of macro and micro nutrients

49
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:07,440
when planting fig trees Outdoors choose

50
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:10,319
a time in Springs or early fall and make

51
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:12,760
sure the tree receives full sun when

52
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,400
choosing a planting site remember that

53
00:03:12,760 --> 00:03:18,640
fig trees have the ability to grow Deep

summer and again in Fall figs are only

63
00:03:45,080 --> 00:03:51,720
harvested when fully ripe because they

64
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:54,239
do not ripen further after picking
