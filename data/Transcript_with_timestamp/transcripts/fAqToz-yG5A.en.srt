1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,319
guys there are five things that I wish I

2
00:00:02,250 --> 00:00:05,960
knew before I started my urban homestead

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,429
it would have saved me so much time

4
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:11,160
energy and effort if I had just known

5
00:00:08,429 --> 00:00:24,330
these five things and today I'm sharing

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:25,800
them with you I'm so glad you're here

7
00:00:24,330 --> 00:00:27,420
today because today I've got another

8
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:29,939
video that is part of the collaboration

9
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:31,859
with my friends Victoria our groceries

10
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,110
Josh of the city set and Kira of

11
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:36,239
homestead dreaming and together we even

12
00:00:34,110 --> 00:00:38,070
homesteaders are working diligently to

13
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,260
make content for you guys to help you

14
00:00:38,070 --> 00:00:41,760
guys get started growing food wherever

15
00:00:40,260 --> 00:00:43,410
you may be whether you're in the city

16
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,390
the suburbs or the country you

17
00:00:43,410 --> 00:00:47,640
absolutely can be growing food wherever

18
00:00:45,390 --> 00:00:49,590
you find yourself and we want to be able

19
00:00:47,640 --> 00:00:51,239
to provide you guys with information

20
00:00:49,590 --> 00:00:53,190
that we wish that we had when we got

21
00:00:51,239 --> 00:00:55,289
started and today's video is all about

22
00:00:53,190 --> 00:00:57,059
that share with you the five things that

23
00:00:55,289 --> 00:00:59,059
I wish I knew before I built my urban

24
00:00:57,059 --> 00:01:03,090
homestead item number one on the agenda

25
00:00:59,059 --> 00:01:05,400
poop I wish I had started with in buy

26
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:08,040
poop I mean worm castings because for me

27
00:01:05,400 --> 00:01:09,720
that is my livestock animal that is what

28
00:01:08,040 --> 00:01:12,420
I use here on the homestead to make

29
00:01:09,720 --> 00:01:14,939
everything from using worm castings to

30
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:16,860
brewing aerated worm tees you guys

31
00:01:14,939 --> 00:01:18,509
haven't seen any of my aerated 40 videos

32
00:01:16,860 --> 00:01:22,350
you need to go check those out because

33
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,670
literally it changes the life of plants

34
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,990
and I don't understand why more people

35
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:27,210
don't use it I think people are just

36
00:01:24,990 --> 00:01:30,000
like a little confused by worms and and

37
00:01:27,210 --> 00:01:31,650
worm tease but seriously like so many

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,930
bioavailable nutrients that it

39
00:01:31,650 --> 00:01:35,220
absolutely dramatically changes the

40
00:01:33,930 --> 00:01:37,470
health of my plants in soil

41
00:01:35,220 --> 00:01:38,909
yeah not recommended enough so that is

42
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:40,680
what we use here on our urban home set

43
00:01:38,909 --> 00:01:43,290
and I wish I had gotten started with

44
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:45,600
more worms sooner before building

45
00:01:43,290 --> 00:01:47,729
anything before building the garden

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,189
before getting any garden beds like hoop

47
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:52,380
like I needed to start with poop now we

48
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:54,479
finally have a really sweet worm bin set

49
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,759
up and make teas all the time I use

50
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,219
castings all the time but as you guys

51
00:01:56,759 --> 00:02:01,020
know compost takes time so it's

52
00:01:59,219 --> 00:02:02,070
important in my opinion to get started

53
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:04,980
with that first

54
00:02:02,070 --> 00:02:06,810
okay number two item number two that I

55
00:02:04,980 --> 00:02:09,360
wish I had known before building my

56
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:12,480
urban homestead I wish I had gotten

57
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:15,390
started growing food in grow bags like

58
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:17,310
grow bags are really underrated a lot of

59
00:02:15,390 --> 00:02:19,800
people are still just starting to get to

60
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,690
know what grow bags are and I honestly

61
00:02:19,800 --> 00:02:23,550
was like no like I don't want grow bags

62
00:02:21,690 --> 00:02:25,890
I want my beautiful garden beds but

63
00:02:23,550 --> 00:02:28,620
here's the thing if I had just been a

64
00:02:25,890 --> 00:02:31,320
little bit more open to using grow bags

65
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,910
and not being so set on having my garden

66
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:34,680
beds and like growing and beautiful

67
00:02:32,910 --> 00:02:37,200
garden beds that I loved I could have

68
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,709
started growing food sooner I could have

69
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,240
started growing food or my family Wow I

70
00:02:40,709 --> 00:02:44,430
was building the garden beds the garden

71
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:45,870
beds took me about two months to build

72
00:02:44,430 --> 00:02:47,760
if you want to see that whole process

73
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:49,580
I'll link it up above we've got garden

74
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:51,990
bed plans for you which you can download

75
00:02:49,580 --> 00:02:53,880
these are really simple garden beds to

76
00:02:51,990 --> 00:02:56,190
build and yet they took me a really long

77
00:02:53,880 --> 00:02:57,750
time I had just said I'm gonna get some

78
00:02:56,190 --> 00:02:59,400
grow bags I'm gonna get some great soil

79
00:02:57,750 --> 00:03:00,870
because that is a benefit of using grow

80
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:04,380
bags is you can use really high quality

81
00:03:00,870 --> 00:03:05,880
soil and you can control it so much

82
00:03:04,380 --> 00:03:08,580
better that way you know you're not so

83
00:03:05,880 --> 00:03:10,800
worried about other diseases within your

84
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,769
garden beds bags in general are a much

85
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:15,570
easier way to grow because everything is

86
00:03:13,769 --> 00:03:17,850
contained in that bag you can move it if

87
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:20,130
you need to move it I think it's like

88
00:03:17,850 --> 00:03:23,100
personally I found that disease is much

89
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,870
more easily controlled in grow bags so I

90
00:03:23,100 --> 00:03:26,580
really recommend grow bags if I had

91
00:03:24,870 --> 00:03:29,910
started with them I could have been

92
00:03:26,580 --> 00:03:31,410
growing food way sooner then how long it

93
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:34,080
took me to grow these beds and then

94
00:03:31,410 --> 00:03:35,640
plant the beds so I can't recommend it

95
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,100
enough I would have started with grow

96
00:03:35,640 --> 00:03:40,260
bags so if and when we move to our new

97
00:03:38,100 --> 00:03:42,930
property you know that I will be

98
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:44,370
starting our food in grow bags and I

99
00:03:42,930 --> 00:03:44,980
would recommend it to anybody else who's

100
00:03:44,370 --> 00:03:47,290
just start

101
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,769
as well oh my goodness okay number three

102
00:03:47,290 --> 00:03:52,599
is such an important one pollinators so

103
00:03:50,769 --> 00:03:54,940
a lot of us people who are interested in

104
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:57,819
growing food we think of just the food

105
00:03:54,940 --> 00:04:00,190
plants however pollinator plants are

106
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:01,660
just as important because not only do

107
00:04:00,190 --> 00:04:03,250
they add Beauty to your garden but

108
00:04:01,660 --> 00:04:05,260
they're going to invite the pollinators

109
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:06,879
to do the work of pollinating for you

110
00:04:05,260 --> 00:04:09,250
unless you want to be out in your garden

111
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,319
every day hand pollinating you know

112
00:04:09,250 --> 00:04:13,989
doing squash sex tapping on your

113
00:04:11,319 --> 00:04:15,489
Tomatoes like unless you're really into

114
00:04:13,989 --> 00:04:16,449
the Hat you want to be out there doing

115
00:04:15,489 --> 00:04:18,760
that every day

116
00:04:16,449 --> 00:04:21,010
get some pollinator friendly native to

117
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,150
your area flowers and I doing that

118
00:04:21,010 --> 00:04:24,460
you're gonna invite things like

119
00:04:22,150 --> 00:04:27,039
hummingbirds and bees and butterflies

120
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:29,830
and by doing that you're building an

121
00:04:27,039 --> 00:04:31,090
ecosystem in that ecosystem is also

122
00:04:29,830 --> 00:04:32,949
going to support what you're doing with

123
00:04:31,090 --> 00:04:34,419
food and slowly but surely you're gonna

124
00:04:32,949 --> 00:04:36,639
have this beautiful cycle out in your

125
00:04:34,419 --> 00:04:39,070
garden so take it from me don't just

126
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:41,080
focus on food production plants but also

127
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:42,699
focus on beautiful flowers that are

128
00:04:41,080 --> 00:04:44,530
going to invite pollinators into your

129
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:46,780
garden and essentially do the work for

130
00:04:44,530 --> 00:04:49,479
you alright let's talk a little bit

131
00:04:46,780 --> 00:04:50,800
about watering now a lot of people based

132
00:04:49,479 --> 00:04:53,139
on where you live have different

133
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,030
watering setups out here in zone 10 in

134
00:04:53,139 --> 00:04:57,639
Southern California we are technically a

135
00:04:55,030 --> 00:05:00,460
chaparral climate we are technically

136
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:02,979
very desert like out here and so that

137
00:05:00,460 --> 00:05:04,900
means that most days are hot and dry we

138
00:05:02,979 --> 00:05:08,320
have like 300 days of sunshine here in

139
00:05:04,900 --> 00:05:09,669
San Diego and that means that my number

140
00:05:08,320 --> 00:05:12,190
one priority when it comes to growing

141
00:05:09,669 --> 00:05:15,280
food is tending to our soil now I could

142
00:05:12,190 --> 00:05:17,229
do a whole other video on soil care soil

143
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,370
health and I think we should do that and

144
00:05:17,229 --> 00:05:20,770
I would love to do that for you guys

145
00:05:18,370 --> 00:05:22,539
another time but this the short and

146
00:05:20,770 --> 00:05:24,700
sweet of it is this is that when we're

147
00:05:22,539 --> 00:05:26,860
growing food and growing any plant for

148
00:05:24,700 --> 00:05:29,349
that matter we our stewarding the soil

149
00:05:26,860 --> 00:05:31,960
it's really about soil if you don't have

150
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:33,550
good soil you don't got much so it's

151
00:05:31,960 --> 00:05:33,930
really important to care for that soil

152
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:36,150
so

153
00:05:33,930 --> 00:05:38,070
how do we care for that soil well part

154
00:05:36,150 --> 00:05:41,580
one is making sure that it has adequate

155
00:05:38,070 --> 00:05:45,030
moisture to do this I first installed a

156
00:05:41,580 --> 00:05:46,940
drip line and a drip line is great there

157
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:50,639
are benefits to that for sure

158
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:53,250
however I found that using soaker hoses

159
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,199
is more effective in water disbursement

160
00:05:53,250 --> 00:05:58,710
and keeping like an even watering

161
00:05:55,199 --> 00:06:00,479
situation going on my garden I also come

162
00:05:58,710 --> 00:06:03,060
back through and I make sure to handle

163
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:04,770
water on the really hot dry days I do it

164
00:06:03,060 --> 00:06:09,150
at night because I learned from a friend

165
00:06:04,770 --> 00:06:11,580
that she said therefore my friend Sarah

166
00:06:09,150 --> 00:06:14,310
over at simple sanctuary that it's

167
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:15,960
better to water in the evenings and the

168
00:06:14,310 --> 00:06:18,210
saying goes something like this water in

169
00:06:15,960 --> 00:06:20,310
the morning if you need to survive water

170
00:06:18,210 --> 00:06:22,169
in the evening if you want to thrive and

171
00:06:20,310 --> 00:06:23,699
so in the evenings now my new thing is

172
00:06:22,169 --> 00:06:25,800
coming around and making sure that the

173
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:28,050
soil is evenly moist because when we

174
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:31,050
lock in that moisture we're locking in

175
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:33,210
the soil biome the ecosystem that's

176
00:06:31,050 --> 00:06:35,070
growing underneath the soil and I'm sure

177
00:06:33,210 --> 00:06:37,979
a lot of you guys know this but roots

178
00:06:35,070 --> 00:06:41,699
and fungi communicate and the better

179
00:06:37,979 --> 00:06:43,380
that communication network is the better

180
00:06:41,699 --> 00:06:45,599
your plants are going to be that's where

181
00:06:43,380 --> 00:06:47,310
that beautiful mycorrhizae forms where

182
00:06:45,599 --> 00:06:49,050
that plant health is really established

183
00:06:47,310 --> 00:06:51,300
it starts with the roots and with soil

184
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:53,430
and the better you can keep it evenly

185
00:06:51,300 --> 00:06:55,919
moist not too moist and not too dry just

186
00:06:53,430 --> 00:06:57,960
evenly moist the better your plants are

187
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:59,669
gonna be so I really wish that I had

188
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:01,320
started with soaker hoses I have found

189
00:06:59,669 --> 00:07:03,509
those to be a much better solution for

190
00:07:01,320 --> 00:07:06,780
my situation out here in San Diego and

191
00:07:03,509 --> 00:07:08,340
so ten feet and I recommend them to I

192
00:07:06,780 --> 00:07:09,030
recommend them to friends when they ask

193
00:07:08,340 --> 00:07:11,610
me

194
00:07:09,030 --> 00:07:13,440
should I water my garden now on the note

195
00:07:11,610 --> 00:07:16,050
of soaker hoses there are many kinds of

196
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:17,970
soaker hoses I have very low grade very

197
00:07:16,050 --> 00:07:19,650
cheap soaker hoses and that's simply

198
00:07:17,970 --> 00:07:21,900
because we've had to do everything on a

199
00:07:19,650 --> 00:07:23,340
budget you know I still kind of consider

200
00:07:21,900 --> 00:07:24,960
us newlyweds even though we've been

201
00:07:23,340 --> 00:07:26,430
married three years like our budget has

202
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:28,140
been very tight for a long time we're

203
00:07:26,430 --> 00:07:31,020
very minimalistic we're very frugal like

204
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:33,060
we really only spend where we have to

205
00:07:31,020 --> 00:07:34,560
spend to make things work and so I

206
00:07:33,060 --> 00:07:36,780
wanted to be able to do this garden on

207
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,690
as best of a budget as possible and for

208
00:07:36,780 --> 00:07:41,460
me using the cheaper end the lower grade

209
00:07:39,690 --> 00:07:43,350
ones is not that big of an issue for

210
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:45,240
right now especially when you know it's

211
00:07:43,350 --> 00:07:47,010
just low production for my family and I

212
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:50,340
and a lot of this is still like a

213
00:07:47,010 --> 00:07:52,380
learning game for me so anyway there are

214
00:07:50,340 --> 00:07:54,060
many kinds of soaker hoses there's

215
00:07:52,380 --> 00:07:56,400
really low grade that's what I have for

216
00:07:54,060 --> 00:07:57,810
now it's fine we'll upgrade later on and

217
00:07:56,400 --> 00:08:01,050
then there's really high grade like

218
00:07:57,810 --> 00:08:02,730
bpa-free like thicker hoses I have the

219
00:08:01,050 --> 00:08:04,590
quarter inch like low grade ones right

220
00:08:02,730 --> 00:08:05,970
now but there's thicker hoses from like

221
00:08:04,590 --> 00:08:08,460
gardeners supply that I would really

222
00:08:05,970 --> 00:08:10,110
love to upgrade to one day and so when

223
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:11,910
the time is right we will upgrade but

224
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:14,100
for now this gets the job done and I

225
00:08:11,910 --> 00:08:15,720
really enjoy soaker hoses opposed to

226
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:18,120
drip line just because for me it offers

227
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,280
a more even watering situation number

228
00:08:18,120 --> 00:08:22,890
five and part two - the whole soil

229
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:24,990
conversation is mulch oh my goodness

230
00:08:22,890 --> 00:08:26,700
mulch now a lot of you probably already

231
00:08:24,990 --> 00:08:28,260
know that mulch is super-important

232
00:08:26,700 --> 00:08:30,750
however

233
00:08:28,260 --> 00:08:32,490
this is my note on mulch mulch is really

234
00:08:30,750 --> 00:08:34,530
important for your garden if you don't

235
00:08:32,490 --> 00:08:37,830
already know that mulch is what's going

236
00:08:34,530 --> 00:08:40,290
to help keep your garden beds or your

237
00:08:37,830 --> 00:08:41,760
garden evenly moist it's going to help

238
00:08:40,290 --> 00:08:43,260
lock in that moisture and keep

239
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:44,580
temperatures cool in the summer and then

240
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:45,900
it's going to help irregular the

241
00:08:44,580 --> 00:08:48,210
temperature in the winter as well

242
00:08:45,900 --> 00:08:50,160
keeping those roots more warm than they

243
00:08:48,210 --> 00:08:52,200
would be without the most on them

244
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:53,580
mulch is so so so important and

245
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:55,410
depending on where you live there will

246
00:08:53,580 --> 00:08:58,950
be different mulches available to you

247
00:08:55,410 --> 00:09:00,870
now here is what I recommend experiment

248
00:08:58,950 --> 00:09:02,130
with different mulches I wish that I had

249
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:04,500
gotten like four or five different

250
00:09:02,130 --> 00:09:06,810
mulches and experimented with them it

251
00:09:04,500 --> 00:09:08,580
literally has taken experimenting with I

252
00:09:06,810 --> 00:09:10,890
think this is May sixth mulch that I've

253
00:09:08,580 --> 00:09:12,360
tried he's moving out here I finally

254
00:09:10,890 --> 00:09:13,860
found one that I like finally my

255
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:16,740
neighbors brought over some composted

256
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:19,710
mulch that they got from a local place I

257
00:09:16,740 --> 00:09:23,010
think it's called El Corazon composting

258
00:09:19,710 --> 00:09:24,780
facility anyway so far I'm really liking

259
00:09:23,010 --> 00:09:26,910
it and it's been a really great mulch

260
00:09:24,780 --> 00:09:28,710
for me in this particular climate and

261
00:09:26,910 --> 00:09:30,810
area it allows enough water to get

262
00:09:28,710 --> 00:09:33,090
through without suffocating the plans

263
00:09:30,810 --> 00:09:34,280
been a really great mulch for me so far

264
00:09:33,090 --> 00:09:36,180
steps I would definitely recommend

265
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:37,740
experiment with mulch it's really

266
00:09:36,180 --> 00:09:39,240
important for soil health all the way

267
00:09:37,740 --> 00:09:40,860
around it's gonna keep your soil evenly

268
00:09:39,240 --> 00:09:42,480
moist it's gonna regulate that

269
00:09:40,860 --> 00:09:44,610
temperature it's gonna protect the soil

270
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:47,700
biome it's gonna protect all of the

271
00:09:44,610 --> 00:09:49,200
little bacteria mycorrhizae and fungi

272
00:09:47,700 --> 00:09:51,000
that are communicating in there so mulch

273
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:52,710
is really important make sure that you

274
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,880
find one that you like and experiment

275
00:09:52,710 --> 00:09:55,500
with different kinds of mulch to see

276
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:55,900
what does best in your climate and your

277
00:09:55,500 --> 00:09:58,210
area

278
00:09:55,900 --> 00:10:01,390
and I suppose we'll throw in a bonus

279
00:09:58,210 --> 00:10:03,190
line which is keep a good attitude there

280
00:10:01,390 --> 00:10:05,740
have been times where this has been a

281
00:10:03,190 --> 00:10:08,890
really challenging endeavor to build an

282
00:10:05,740 --> 00:10:10,930
urban homestead but it's been an amazing

283
00:10:08,890 --> 00:10:13,090
endeavor and being able to keep a

284
00:10:10,930 --> 00:10:14,830
positive attitude about it has helped me

285
00:10:13,090 --> 00:10:16,530
I think get a lot farther than I would

286
00:10:14,830 --> 00:10:19,390
have if I had gotten discouraged or

287
00:10:16,530 --> 00:10:21,520
frustrated or annoyed and ways that I do

288
00:10:19,390 --> 00:10:23,050
that is by you know asking for a hug

289
00:10:21,520 --> 00:10:25,180
when I need one on the tough days but I

290
00:10:23,050 --> 00:10:26,200
have plants that have disease or where

291
00:10:25,180 --> 00:10:28,810
it was just a really long day of

292
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:30,880
building things asking for help when I

293
00:10:28,810 --> 00:10:32,830
need it and making sure that I get

294
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,480
enough water and rest those are super

295
00:10:32,830 --> 00:10:35,680
important things to to staying healthy

296
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:38,320
and staying positive

297
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,890
