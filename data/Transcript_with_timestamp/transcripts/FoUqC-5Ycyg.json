  "text": "thanks Nate to cut the glass let's go hey guys want talk they're good tire obviously on this tire so in this video I am gonna show you how to remove the who you'll find a pump jar find it all and hopefully patch it and get it working as good as new guy he's not I got the wheel off of the tractor the first thing you need to do is obviously Jack the tractor up somehow this is why I do I usually just tilted on its axis fairly and it's just a minefield tractor push up the side rest against something in the back there and you know a couple of steadies underneath and that we even get this wheel off okay so on most lawn tractors you just saw a plastic cup over the hop here so simply a first cause option is cooler off she just prized off okay so in this case all we have here is the here's the axle is retaining clip and that water so all we need to do is just forced us quite out so we're using something like a a small screwdriver like this just leave a lot and push it over and do a boozer like i just off there once you do that take the wash it off and that we all can then be way Koval hopefully yeah you may find that yours use me of our attaining not you know it's just a normal mop on there or it may have a split pen realize you were just off to you know remove this poppin similar situation and and just get the wheel off okay so it should just be a simple case of sorry jiggling the wheel off so just okay it's obviously the first thing you need to do is a complete tie up so you can either use our compressor or in this case I'm just use my my basic or pump yeah that's perfectly adequate for a track that they are so come pop okay so obviously get adopt a substantial pressure to where the air walking over the wall there's opposite h\u00e4lln\u00e4s tear somewhere so we'll get up to pressure and although it's the move the next stage okay so what we want to do now is we need to get some sort of solution soapy solution so all I've got years on old just a little spraying off our flasher many like household it sort of displease that you get or you can buy one you know bonito ever um a little water in it and quite a lot of air philia liquid or you know any sort of detail gent and what what I do is just spray it all over the tire and just to see where we can see the leaking so it's basically a homemade leak detector will spit all over the tire and then hopefully you'll see the air bubbles come out and then out that way we'll be able to find a leak so just you know don't hang about just spray a lot a lot of this on keeps fill in the tail so you should soon see the week you know yes he says yeah see you there commas picking up see the bubbles there [Music] so that's what you're looking for you're looking for our you know obvious escape of here and then the tire see you there okay so again just clear it quickly see the big bubble here but we'll check again see familiar souvenir that's the idea so keep my eye on it what I'm gonna do is dry this off in the market with a marker that was marked at the seahorse of just mark a couple of white marks yeah see the hole there that took my finger yes it was a tool kit here the repair kit yeah they're all type 2 here which he just pierced through the hole and just got a robbed and that cleans the area we've got two here whoever thread through the actual plugs these are the clothes that affect fillets are rubber strips yeah I was I'm sorry glee alright good in the inside I thought it was a rubber off string or something effectively they thread to do this to you force it through the tire and then pull us over and it leaves it the plug and then you turn off and that's that's effect where I'll show you how we did I know okay so what you want to do firstly I want to get this draw tool obviously will establish where the hallways so what do is just stab the stroll through the hole and just you know pool and I notice they sort of fail the area unclean the area so now maybe saw me out comes open we do that spot so just get it and twist that who out quickly [Music] and again pull it out and just repeat this process you know five or six times they've got a nice clear haul hoping you got close up here's a handle here's a tool go in there and see that stick out slowly [Music] so effectively failing the all okay so I do know is the move when he steps on this packaging I saw just pull this out no we need to do is just thread this through this eyelet here you see this ila just thread this through it's pretty tough courses quick sake usually robbery so it's really Stefano let's get it roughly halfway okay so how this works is top edge of the eye it's obviously sealed so that allows you to force down into the tire but the top edge of the eyelet if you can see it's not joined so once you give that plug into the tire and pull forcefully back you know and the tool we are this obviously is opening and wheeshes a tool but leaves the plug in the tire and all them and see that and they're not so faithfully it trim the plug pump it up check for leaks and that should be us demonstrate that no here's what we're gonna do we're gonna this is just the droll oh just mark them with a Wohlers so we're gonna take this out and we're gonna twist this end a short distance and then yank it out quickly I wasn't sure you know take this out [Music] finger wall with us push your hand will go if you can see that it's probably I don't know halfway in and then we need to do is just yank there so forcefully and quickly like that well that leaves your with is using the plug stock and the wall I'm associate marked that mark that's what we need to do you know it was just trim knees all the little off the tread wear with our craft knife and we'll probably take it up again spray it with solution and just make sure the week's gone okay so just got one of these craft knifes what do you know is just trim these off hopefully when you're doing this these nurseries are sharp so don't there / they tell you again and we'll be back to square one but all I'm doing here is this I've got I just bore the tread hold on the one end of the clog and just gently so just gently cough just pumped up yeah we'll just split some solution I know yeah and see it's totally sealed [Music] look it's a puncture fixed I'll get this up to pleasure and we'll get the wheel back on one more okay look wheels off just use all that grease er doesn't bother you don't have any of it I'm just doing it because it feels off and then simply set the wheel back on okay sobs they want to get the wheel back on washer on start clip in the groove these up here I walk on pliers to squeeze this orange [Music] that's a really quick top cut back on the Scott yeah nut sauce that's it done okay guys that's it fixed perfect if they liked the video in any way please give it a thumbs up I'll leave links in the description to all the the tools used especially that appear cut and the new here likes these types of videos please subscribe my channel go ahead and subscribe there any comments please leave in the comments guys I always answer comments [Music]",
