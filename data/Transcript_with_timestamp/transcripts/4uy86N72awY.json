  "text": "time we're gonna go through some of the question and answers there's been several posted on the QA farms some have been answered in text form but we're gonna go through them orally here as well let's go bill first one of the questions was on well I think this question ended up going to both both bill and Doug but you know the the waist being land applied and I think the alligator's you showed us the demonstration of the irrigation duck bill are there some of the solid material some of the solid solid matter from the nutrients well you know reality there the biggest part of waste that we get from fishes after processing and there's there's actually two things we do with that well is more than that we we have a large mink industry here and that that's one of the primary one of the best resources to use for the mink industry whether whether you like mink or not farming but but that's one thing we have a large company here that makes fish hydrolysate and I actually make that two and basically it's it's digesting the everything that you don't eat so that's the head though the innards and scales everything the skin whatever you don't eat is digested in a cold digestion process and you make fish hydrolysate which is quite a bit different than the stuff you can buy in the store this is a it doesn't smell as bad it's not cooked or any of the nutrients taken out of it so it's uh if you can buy fish hydrolysate made that way it's an organic supplement and and people that are in the the gardening business the flower gardens and the vegetable gardens they just love it and then they can also be used for also feels and you can be written guys with the deer farms you might be interested also love it because are there food plots are as a high priority item and I'm trying to think of another but anyway I also have the high school's use it in hydroponics so we can take fish I draw the sate and use it directly and get rid of all the other fertilizers and they they actually like it better than any other first synthetic fertilizer that they've bought so but then the other side of that is you can directly apply fish waste right and soil to and that's in large processing facilities that's what they do so there's it's almost nothing wasted on that site with alligator farming the waste the nutrient material can be land applied and you demonstrate an irrigation system have you seen alligator manure being applied using other systems yes all right yeah actually Ron one of the things he was doing was trying to precipitate although he was not really looking that as a as a fertilizer more of an industrial source of phosphate the I was looking at the analyses the if you had some kind of solid separation the solid portion of the the pond waste was almost all phosphorus and pretty good that it's basically all phosphorus and then the liquid portion is about looks like about a hundred to one PK into the phosphate so it's uh if you could separate the solids and store it in a way that would or maybe digest it so they wouldn't smell so much that would make a very good phosphorus fertilizer that could be transported long ways and for cropping systems the through irrigation basically if you separate the solids then you you could apply to an irrigation system like a center pivot so I know there's no there's nothing that would keep you from using that other than the odor control thanks Brandon to you Doug just brought up transportation of manure and the moisture content all the manure plays into that you compared the moisture content between the different types of servants you want to comment on that and and the application of that transport transport ability of the manure I will and that was one question that came up when the QA typed in and I tried there's fun about a minute ago one of the big things would see especially in the county where I am in Texas is we used to be the largest dairy capital in Texas if since moves to the Panhandle the big thing about dairy especially dairy manure dairy excellent the limitation is water content it is only viable for a couple of miles and after that the break-even no longer make sense for application so we're not even as worried with yes there are environmental regulations there environmental concerns one application but a lot of that environmental concern becomes we only have a finite area where it can be applied and then we can't apply it any further that's really and I can't say that any deer farming operations are making use of this right now but that's where I see the next big thing the big opportunity is this is a dry manure you don't have the energy input of drying it down before it can be used so we've got already made products that all it needs to be done is transport thank you Bill a question to you reiterating and that came through the through the Q&A with aquaculture what are thoughts about keeping prices competitive with foreign markets such as Southeast Asia well you know right now 90 some percent of everything that we do is import it it is it's strange very difficult to get our arms on it and I've been working on that for about twenty years fortunately I'm raising a product it doesn't have any competition but I the biggest one I see is that people are are growing as tilapia and a lot of them are are doing tilapia or they have to do it indoors or even for assault but tilapia is warm water I think about 80 degrees is optimum but when you come to process it's almost none of it is process the United States and that's a killer they have another double set of bones and I've been trying to figure out what to do with it because of all the big markets are the big tilapia producers that I know of none of them sell their fish process and that means that they all have to go to live markets and and I never even would have thought of that but so you're you're strapped with a large trucking live fish to live markets and there's only a few big cities that can take large quantities of that so that I mean that's just one species I know for a long long time and I'm straying out of my my expertise in catfish farmers were doing real well and then they had import problems and they had some serious problems but it's always going to be a problem and and I work with the North Central Regional aquaculture center I'm on their board and we are constantly looking for species to raise that we can do economically and that's the key so as you saw in my church a lot of the fish that we're raising now are non-indigenous species to our our state and we're trying to do more and more shrimp is coming in I think Marcus first shrimp will be very strong if we can get the technology down if we can get the perch going that'll be big we're working on walleye too and the perch and a walleye earned there's no competition from agent imports at all so I mean there's gotta pick your species but you have to pick your economics too and it's not that simple I don't know about the rest of the audience but through all three presentations I kept hearing some very strong similarities to those species we are a lot more familiar with Doug a question for you as I look outside my window here in Minnesota is the snowstorm and the blizzard has started why are the alligators in Louisiana generally kept under roots I think when I was researching for this I think most of the ones in Florida are also kept under roof I think it's because they they won't escape for one thing and the other thing is probably they get a better product if they can control the climate heat is you saw those buildings were very well insulated but I don't think heat is that big of a problem for them particularly if they have the sprinklers but they get a better control over the the leather which is their moneymaker mostly brand another question for you with with the in Texas or larger region if you're familiar with it what is the the main for the different species of servants what what is the main purpose of raising room is it for the hunting or is it for the for the meat rather the hunting is always going to be the biggest deal especially in this state but I know in other areas to big-game ranchers have popped up and it's becoming a bigger thing we're losing some public lands so there are not as many native populations we've gotten disease issues chronic wasting disease being the biggest one among service they're taking out some of the wild populations so it's going to be the big game army marketable meat it's always going to take a second place to it if for no other reason than the markets not seeing any more questions come up in the QA so I think well we'll start wrapping it up here I want to thank our three speakers Brandon Doug and Bill for sharing their sharing their background and their insights into these less than typical species for the rest of us",
