00:00:00,390 --> 00:00:06,930
hi everyone this is a read it told

2
00:00:03,899 --> 00:00:10,410
myself arm this video is about rainwater

3
00:00:06,930 --> 00:00:14,610
collection so this is a Quonset hut

4
00:00:10,410 --> 00:00:18,210
building that is 40 feet wide by 80 feet

5
00:00:14,610 --> 00:00:21,570
long and it's right beside our seedling

6
00:00:18,210 --> 00:00:25,260
production greenhouse and we have very

7
00:00:21,570 --> 00:00:30,510
saline well water so we're catching

8
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:35,180
rainwater off of one half of the Quonset

9
00:00:30,510 --> 00:00:39,210
hut with this gutter just simply

10
00:00:35,180 --> 00:00:41,910
anchored into the side of the Quonset

11
00:00:39,210 --> 00:00:44,579
with concrete anchors I think we

12
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:47,879
initially did it with lead slugs and

13
00:00:44,579 --> 00:00:51,930
ultimately had to replace them with the

14
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:55,340
expansion bolt type of concrete anchors

15
00:00:51,930 --> 00:00:59,460
but now it it holds pretty well and

16
00:00:55,340 --> 00:01:02,370
whenever it rains the Quonset structure

17
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:07,110
drips into the trough and then the first

18
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:10,380
step here at the outlet it goes down and

19
00:01:07,110 --> 00:01:13,470
there's a T facing downwards in the ABS

20
00:01:10,380 --> 00:01:16,470
I think it's four inch EVs looks like

21
00:01:13,470 --> 00:01:20,909
three or four three apparently and that

22
00:01:16,470 --> 00:01:24,090
T goes into a dead-end shunt pipe which

23
00:01:20,909 --> 00:01:29,450
runs down and down and down in this

24
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:33,079
little trench always graded and then

25
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:37,689
here's the outlet of that little shunt

26
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:44,000
and you probably can't see but

27
00:01:37,689 --> 00:01:48,350
down here is a tiny hole drilled in it

28
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:52,609
and that allows this what's called a

29
00:01:48,350 --> 00:01:56,869
roof washer or a first flush diverter it

30
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:59,659
fills up with the first dirty pollen and

31
00:01:56,869 --> 00:02:03,549
dust filled first flush of water that

32
00:01:59,659 --> 00:02:06,020
lands on roof comes down down the trough

33
00:02:03,549 --> 00:02:08,239
through the tea flows down into the

34
00:02:06,020 --> 00:02:11,810
shunt pipe fills the first flush

35
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:16,549
diverter and then thereafter the water

36
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:20,000
can continue on into the sump for

37
00:02:16,549 --> 00:02:23,000
transfer but that first dirty flow of

38
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:25,280
water goes into the first flush diverter

39
00:02:23,000 --> 00:02:27,160
and then in between rainfall events it

40
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,380
trickles out through the tiny hole in it

41
00:02:27,160 --> 00:02:37,720
so once the diverter is full water flows

42
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:40,940
over here into a sump a nylon stocking

43
00:02:37,720 --> 00:02:47,150
as a basic filter for particulate and

44
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:51,799
then ordinary cheap sump pump there's

45
00:02:47,150 --> 00:02:54,260
also a stock water here in their stock

46
00:02:51,799 --> 00:02:56,720
tank water heater that we use in the

47
00:02:54,260 --> 00:02:59,120
early spring to thaw out the block of

48
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,920
ice that forms in here in the winter so

49
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,829
that we can start running the rainwater

50
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:07,730
collection system earlier rather than

51
00:03:03,829 --> 00:03:11,180
having to wait until the ice thaws

52
00:03:07,730 --> 00:03:16,400
naturally so then the sump pump runs up

53
00:03:11,180 --> 00:03:19,340
through the blue pipe and blue pipes

54
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,670
attached to the filler with a cam

55
00:03:19,340 --> 00:03:28,370
coupler this one here is overflow should

56
00:03:22,670 --> 00:03:34,220
we ever get more than 2,100 gallons so

57
00:03:28,370 --> 00:03:38,720
this is a 9,000 litre opaque reservoir

58
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:40,819
which is about 3000 gallons and for

59
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:43,010
every rainfall event here based on the

60
00:03:40,819 --> 00:03:45,760
roof surface area if we get a millimeter

61
00:03:43,010 --> 00:03:51,140
of rain we get a hundred liters of water

62
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:54,319
for 10 millimeters of rain we get a

63
00:03:51,140 --> 00:03:57,410
thousand litres of water so 10

64
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,269
millimeters of rain is like half an inch

65
00:03:57,410 --> 00:04:05,780
not quite probably three quarters of an

66
00:03:59,269 --> 00:04:07,610
inch of rain is to just know it's like

67
00:04:05,780 --> 00:04:11,299
7/16 of an inch of rain so you have to

68
00:04:07,610 --> 00:04:16,699
do 2.5 millimeters of water would be an

69
00:04:11,299 --> 00:04:19,579
inch for an inch of rain we get 2500

70
00:04:16,699 --> 00:04:24,169
liters of water which is about I don't

71
00:04:19,579 --> 00:04:27,350
know 20 500 litres is I can't figure

72
00:04:24,169 --> 00:04:30,460
what that is in gallon but you can see

73
00:04:27,350 --> 00:04:34,849
care of this morning's condensation that

74
00:04:30,460 --> 00:04:37,849
there's currently between is about 500

75
00:04:34,849 --> 00:04:40,970
gallon of water sitting in the rainwater

76
00:04:37,849 --> 00:04:47,240
tank and the ball valve really outlet

77
00:04:40,970 --> 00:04:52,610
open and this hose runs over here

78
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:57,199
and into the green house in the green

79
00:04:52,610 --> 00:04:59,900
house comes in through the wall and it's

80
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:02,830
one of the two possible sources for this

81
00:04:59,900 --> 00:05:05,060
jet pump which is our booster pump to

82
00:05:02,830 --> 00:05:10,699
provide pressure here in the greenhouse

83
00:05:05,060 --> 00:05:12,949
or watering all of our greenhouse stuff

84
00:05:10,699 --> 00:05:17,150
so inside the greenhouse installation

85
00:05:12,949 --> 00:05:20,180
looks like this there is a an indoor

86
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:24,800
reservoir here a thousand litre cube and

87
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:27,440
then there's that this connection

88
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:31,190
between the cube and the inbound

89
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:33,229
rainwater and the jet pump so that you

90
00:05:31,190 --> 00:05:37,639
can choose which one you're using in the

91
00:05:33,229 --> 00:05:41,060
really early spring we start by filling

92
00:05:37,639 --> 00:05:42,979
the cube and using that until the

93
00:05:41,060 --> 00:05:45,460
weather is warm enough to let us open

94
00:05:42,979 --> 00:05:48,590
the valve and use the rainwater system

95
00:05:45,460 --> 00:05:50,330
so that's all of our greenhouse water

96
00:05:48,590 --> 00:05:53,419
supply for our seedling greenhouse and

97
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:55,729
it makes a huge difference to the

98
00:05:53,419 --> 00:05:58,699
quality and health of our seedlings to

99
00:05:55,729 --> 00:06:00,440
be able to use rainwater rather than our

100
00:05:58,699 --> 00:06:05,020
saline well water which certain things

101
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:09,110
like tomatoes or even more particularly

102
00:06:05,020 --> 00:06:10,580
peppers these are happy looking peppers

103
00:06:09,110 --> 00:06:14,599
because we've had lots of rain and

104
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:17,120
rainwater this spring but peppers are

105
00:06:14,599 --> 00:06:20,120
super sensitive to the salinity needed

106
00:06:17,120 --> 00:06:25,099
the disaster when we don't have rain

107
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:27,889
water for them so this is a April stage

108
00:06:25,099 --> 00:06:31,040
April 27th this is what our seedling

109
00:06:27,889 --> 00:06:33,170
greenhouse looks like in late April

110
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,740
I'll do another video about this

111
00:06:33,170 --> 00:06:40,640
overhead washing thing which we call

112
00:06:36,740 --> 00:06:41,470
this flying sis tune do that in a

113
00:06:40,640 --> 00:06:44,470
separate video

114
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:44,470
voila
