1
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:17,920
hi

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,560
i'm threshing wheat and this last couple

3
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:22,400
weeks i've been harvesting

4
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,320
and threshing wheat grinding it into

5
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,880
flour and uh

6
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:28,560
i've finally gotten a system that i

7
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,080
think is working pretty efficiently

8
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,000
so i'll share that with you later in the

9
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:33,760
video but this whole episode is going to

10
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,640
be devoted to the wheat harvest

11
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,480
which takes up a significant amount of

12
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,680
time but it also nets us a large amount

13
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:42,079
of calories

14
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:43,120
and this wheat would have been planted

15
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:45,200
last fall

16
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,960
when fossil fuels were widely available

17
00:00:45,200 --> 00:00:47,440
and then as fast fossil fuels crashed

18
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:50,719
through the

19
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:52,399
spring the wheat grew up and just sat

20
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:53,440
there and was not able to be harvested

21
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,320
so i had to come

22
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,320
and harvest it by hand using using uh

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:58,960
very minimal fossil fuels i did use my

24
00:00:58,320 --> 00:01:01,199
truck

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,879
to move all of the the stuff back to my

26
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:05,199
house but it was only a mile so

27
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:06,880
you know we used a minimal amount of gas

28
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:09,119
really to get this job done

29
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:11,119
and now i'm in the process of threshing

30
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,880
this is about half of what

31
00:01:11,119 --> 00:01:14,560
i harvested so i'm about halfway through

32
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,920
the threshing

33
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,920
i'll take you through it as i go

34
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,400
but uh welcome to this week in food

35
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:27,840
magedon

36
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
where we're harvesting wheat

37
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,600
hi you usually don't see me here until

38
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:49,040
the end of the video

39
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:50,159
but i thought i'd jump on just in case

40
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,119
there's some new viewers to the

41
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,600
foodmageddon

42
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:54,399
series because of this wheat video and i

43
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:54,960
just want to let you know what we're

44
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,079
doing

45
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:59,920
basically um we are simulating the

46
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:02,640
collapse of fossil fuels

47
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
in uh today's food system so back in

48
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:04,880
january

49
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,479
we started weaning ourselves off of

50
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,239
fossil fuels as if there was some sort

51
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:09,520
of fossil fuel crisis

52
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,120
luckily this worked out really well

53
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,480
because we were really prepared for

54
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:15,200
covid hitting

55
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,720
and essentially by september we will be

56
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:17,280
completely cut off from the outside

57
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,080
world

58
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:21,200
and the only food that we can add to our

59
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:23,840
pantry will be

60
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,040
from what we are able to get ourselves

61
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,319
with human power

62
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:31,920
around our house so part of that process

63
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:35,760
is harvesting uh the wheat from a nearby

64
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:37,599
farm and you may see me talk about how

65
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:40,160
if fossil fuels disappeared

66
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,920
um this is what we would have to do in

67
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,480
actual terms as if it was actually

68
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:44,160
happening

69
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:46,239
because what this series is meant to be

70
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:48,400
is a window into an alternative reality

71
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,200
where fossil fuels have collapsed

72
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:52,800
so i'll make some links here you can go

73
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:53,920
back to the beginning and start watching

74
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:55,200
uh from the beginning if you're

75
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:58,080
interested we have week

76
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,680
we have episodes almost every week um

77
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,920
telling about how we prepared

78
00:02:59,680 --> 00:03:04,239
what we're doing and how we're coping uh

79
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:04,959
with the loss of fossil fuels in our

80
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:06,319
food system

81
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:08,480
which i think is a really important

82
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:09,360
thing to consider um especially with the

83
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:10,959
disruptions in

84
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,480
the food system we've seen since the

85
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:14,720
coronavirus has been

86
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,879
has been happening so uh yeah have a

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,720
look back and i hope you'll subscribe

88
00:03:16,879 --> 00:03:20,959
and share this with some friends so

89
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:23,040
thanks for watching

90
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:24,319
it's time to harvest wheat this was

91
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:27,760
planted last

92
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:29,599
fall on my neighbor's property but now

93
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:31,120
you didn't have fossil fuels how would

94
00:03:29,599 --> 00:03:34,080
you harvest it

95
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,720
and luckily i happen to have the tools

96
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:37,280
to do it

97
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:37,840
so we're going to be harvesting about a

98
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,440
tenth of an

99
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,280
acre and i'm going to be letting you

100
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:42,879
know exactly how much work it is to

101
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
harvest a tenth of an acre a tenth of an

102
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:46,239
acre

103
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,519
is about three hundred and 4350 square

104
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:50,879
feet

105
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,920
and it should have enough uh about eight

106
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:56,000
bushels

107
00:03:51,920 --> 00:03:59,040
uh worth of wheat which will be

108
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:01,120
450 pounds of grain

109
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,879
we'll see how it goes well i've done

110
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,120
half a row out of six and i already have

111
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,480
a big appreciation for

112
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,120
uh not only the people that could do

113
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,840
this well hundreds of years ago but also

114
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:12,000
the modern

115
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:13,360
machines that you know could do this

116
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,479
with fossil fuels uh

117
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:17,199
because it's a lot of work and also a

118
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:20,560
lot of skill

119
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:23,759
so uh don't take this

120
00:04:20,560 --> 00:04:25,120
as a good instruction this is just me

121
00:04:23,759 --> 00:04:27,040
practicing and learning how to do it

122
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,080
maybe by the by the end of this week

123
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:30,160
i'll have a good

124
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,080
good rhythm and pattern down but my goal

125
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,199
basically is to use this scythe

126
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:37,199
to cut and cradle as much weed as i can

127
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,880
and drop it neatly into a pile with all

128
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,440
the heads on one side

129
00:04:38,880 --> 00:04:57,840
and all the stubby tails on the other

130
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:57,840
doesn't always work out

131
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:13,889
[Music]

132
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:24,400
it's quicker i'm finding if i make a

133
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:27,919
foul

134
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,919
a foul throw to just come and fix it

135
00:05:27,919 --> 00:05:31,440
and i'm getting a lot of shatter which

136
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,600
means a lot of

137
00:05:31,440 --> 00:05:34,960
grain is falling out on the ground

138
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,560
because the heads are shaking and it's

139
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,840
knocking the grain loose

140
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:43,440
problem is this grain's too dry

141
00:05:39,840 --> 00:05:44,880
i should have harvard this week ago

142
00:05:43,440 --> 00:05:46,479
i don't have that background knowledge

143
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,199
that someone 100 years ago would have

144
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:50,560
had

145
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,560
to know that i should have done it

146
00:05:50,840 --> 00:05:53,840
earlier

147
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:07,840
so

148
00:06:10,850 --> 00:06:14,939
[Music]

149
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:26,319
so

150
00:06:21,150 --> 00:06:26,319
[Music]

151
00:06:50,690 --> 00:06:54,740
[Applause]

152
00:07:06,850 --> 00:07:10,079
[Music]

153
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,870
so

154
00:07:17,010 --> 00:07:20,870
[Music]

155
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,039
now believe it or not doing all this

156
00:07:24,560 --> 00:07:27,840
maybe five minutes with the side that's

157
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,319
the easy part

158
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,919
now i have to bundle them into sheaths

159
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,880
and this is dwarf wheat you can see how

160
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:35,280
short it is

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,880
thanks to norman borlaug and the 1960s

162
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:39,280
who developed this dwarf wheat

163
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,160
we can grow a lot more wheat on the head

164
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:43,440
of each

165
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:44,479
stock than we used to be able to if this

166
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:47,599
wheat were as tall

167
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,599
as old wheat was then it would lodge the

168
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,520
head would be too heavy for the strand

169
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:53,759
and it would knuckle it would lodge in

170
00:07:51,520 --> 00:07:55,599
the ground and become useless

171
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,520
so they shortened the wheat it was a

172
00:07:55,599 --> 00:07:58,000
japanese dwarf variety they broke cross

173
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:00,560
spread it

174
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:02,240
shortened the wheat and now you can grow

175
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,360
tons of wheat on each stock

176
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:07,039
however i can't do what i used to do

177
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,599
which was use the stock itself

178
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,840
as a binder for a sheep of wheat or a

179
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:14,160
clump a group of wheat that you'd

180
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:15,919
bind together you just use the wheat

181
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,199
itself to do it this is too short so i

182
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,039
have to use twine which is kind of

183
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:22,000
annoying

184
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:22,560
but now i have to bind all this together

185
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:24,720
now in

186
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:26,160
days long ago when people actually mowed

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:28,720
their own wheat like this

188
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:30,240
this would be the job of two binders for

189
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:32,800
every one

190
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:33,760
mower because you can mow twice as fast

191
00:08:32,800 --> 00:08:36,320
as you can bind

192
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:38,159
so usually it would be the husband

193
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,479
generally doing the siding

194
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,320
the more evenly you mow this the easier

195
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,159
it is for the binders

196
00:08:42,320 --> 00:08:46,320
so you had to be as skillful as possible

197
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:48,399
not to upset

198
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:50,399
the people that had to come after you

199
00:08:48,399 --> 00:08:53,440
and and clean it all up

200
00:08:50,399 --> 00:08:55,040
and then the wife and older older kids

201
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,839
helping with the binding and the younger

202
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,399
kids

203
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:59,760
they'd be picking up off the ground

204
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:01,200
these loose heads

205
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
and stuffing them in a sack these are

206
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:04,399
gleanings you may have heard in the

207
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,600
bible

208
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:09,440
or maybe old accounts of agriculture

209
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:10,720
gleanings in fields this is what you

210
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:12,320
pick up off the ground that's not

211
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:13,680
attached to the stock anymore

212
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,399
and biblically you're supposed to leave

213
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:18,720
it for poor people and the birds

214
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,760
i may or may not do that i might just

215
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:21,600
pick it up myself

216
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:23,760
so we'll see we'll maybe get some kids

217
00:09:21,600 --> 00:09:26,959
out here soon to help me

218
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:30,000
help me with this so after about eight

219
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:31,600
hours of harvesting total i have all

220
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,920
these sheaves of wheat

221
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:35,680
which are bundles of wheat piled in my

222
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
garage

223
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:39,839
and i have to process them into grain as

224
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:42,000
quickly or process them to get the grain

225
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,080
out as quickly as possible

226
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,080
each one of these heads has

227
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,959
grains and chaff in them and so i have

228
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:54,160
to

229
00:09:50,959 --> 00:09:57,440
essentially do that to all

230
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:59,120
every single head to get the grain out

231
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,200
and the process to get that grain out is

232
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:02,480
called threshing and there's

233
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,320
many different ways to do it the

234
00:10:02,480 --> 00:10:05,440
traditional way would be to put this all

235
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,959
on a

236
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:12,160
on the ground and beat it with flails

237
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:14,480
um or have oxen

238
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,640
trod over them until they knock all the

239
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:18,000
heads loose or have kids jump on it or

240
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:19,040
beat it with sticks there's all kinds of

241
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:20,320
different ways to do it depending on

242
00:10:19,040 --> 00:10:23,760
where you are in the world

243
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:24,720
another kind of low budget way to do it

244
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,640
if you have

245
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,000
a small plot of of wheat that you want

246
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:31,519
to work

247
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:34,240
is to use just a clean tub

248
00:10:31,519 --> 00:10:36,079
so this is a clean garbage bin i have

249
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:39,360
never used it for garbage it's only for

250
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,160
food and food related processing

251
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:43,440
so if i take this sheath open it up and

252
00:10:42,160 --> 00:10:44,560
this is why it's important to get all

253
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:47,920
the heads

254
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:50,160
on one side of the sheath and all the

255
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:51,600
the straw on the other side so you don't

256
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:54,880
have to

257
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,200
go through later and pick through and

258
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,720
make sure that it's aligned see here i

259
00:10:57,200 --> 00:11:00,000
have to turn

260
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,399
grab all these heads and turn them

261
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:02,399
around

262
00:11:04,640 --> 00:11:08,399
so that they're all aligned to one end

263
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:10,959
and this increase

264
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:11,839
this is what really increases the time

265
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,200
to process

266
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:17,040
so it really behooves you

267
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:19,279
to make sure you align all the grain

268
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,079
really carefully in the field

269
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:25,040
to save yourself time later and then

270
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:30,320
really i just take

271
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,320
these heads of grain and beat them

272
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:37,360
beat them on both sides and you can see

273
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,720
the grain heads are still here but

274
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:42,720
there's no grain left in

275
00:11:38,720 --> 00:11:44,399
them all of the very dry seeds

276
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,000
have dropped out so now that's just

277
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,839
straw straw

278
00:11:46,000 --> 00:11:49,760
straw is when it doesn't have any seeds

279
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:52,480
in it hay is when it does

280
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:54,560
so now it's straw this is hay and this

281
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,920
is straw technically speaking

282
00:11:54,560 --> 00:12:01,279
so we could do that a lot but um

283
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:04,639
i've built a flailing

284
00:12:01,279 --> 00:12:06,720
uh a flailing machine basically

285
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,760
that can be run by bicycle i'm gonna use

286
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,000
a motor

287
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:11,279
an electric motor because it's just me

288
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,680
you need two people to operate if you

289
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,279
run it with a bicycle

290
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:17,360
but it's right behind me here so let's

291
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,639
have a look at that so over here i have

292
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:21,839
essentially what amounts to

293
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:24,720
a large octagonal drum

294
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:26,639
and right now i have it set it this can

295
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:28,079
close but right now i have stops in here

296
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:31,839
and i'll show you why later

297
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:35,440
so what you can do is put in your wheat

298
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,320
here close it latch it and then ride a

299
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,959
bicycle

300
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,079
and it turns a series of flails and shut

301
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,120
inside and i'll show you that in a

302
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,200
minute

303
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:44,639
i have it set up right now with this

304
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:47,040
opening so that i can

305
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:48,720
let it run and i will stick the sheaves

306
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:50,560
of wheat in as you'll see but this is a

307
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:53,440
little bit of a modification to run as a

308
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:54,800
one person operation as opposed to a

309
00:12:53,440 --> 00:12:56,800
a two-person operation you could run it

310
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,200
as a batch meaning you put it in

311
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:00,000
run it for a set amount of time and then

312
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:02,160
clean it out

313
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,600
i'm gonna run it continuously and just

314
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:08,160
keep putting heads in until it's full

315
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:09,760
um so what this is essentially is a

316
00:13:08,160 --> 00:13:13,360
central axel

317
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,880
with these flails that uh spin in kind

318
00:13:13,360 --> 00:13:18,560
of a worm pattern

319
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:21,680
so it pushes everything this way

320
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:25,360
and then this the seeds and chaff

321
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:27,600
fall down uh this

322
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:28,639
this open slot in the in the on the side

323
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:30,800
so i add

324
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:32,160
things over here and it gets beaten as

325
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:33,680
they move down

326
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:35,839
and then i have to clear out all the

327
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:39,360
straw and the excess chaff

328
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:41,120
but most of this or almost all the seeds

329
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,120
and some of the chaff falls down through

330
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:45,519
this gap and uh you're not supposed to

331
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,839
run it with it open

332
00:13:45,519 --> 00:14:02,320
but we'll do it here just for fun so you

333
00:13:47,839 --> 00:14:04,079
can see

334
00:14:02,320 --> 00:14:05,920
now this gets to be very dusty so i'm

335
00:14:04,079 --> 00:14:09,279
going to wear a respirator

336
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:13,760
and i'm going to tie my hair up with a

337
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:15,440
bandana to keep the dust out of my hair

338
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,639
that here comes the respirator which

339
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:18,240
makes it a little hard to talk plus

340
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:20,560
it'll be loud anyway

341
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:22,160
but essentially what i'm going to do is

342
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,480
take from my

343
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:26,800
wheat over here and then as this is

344
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,440
spinning put the heads of grain in

345
00:14:26,800 --> 00:14:30,399
and those flails will knock the wheat

346
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:32,800
right off of it

347
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:34,320
then i can pull the straw out and put it

348
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:37,519
in that

349
00:14:34,320 --> 00:14:45,839
waiting wheelbarrow so

350
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:45,839
here we go

351
00:14:50,310 --> 00:15:15,040
[Music]

352
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:18,399
okay so oh sorry get my respirator off

353
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:18,399
okay so now that i've run it

354
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:22,160
in here we've got

355
00:15:22,240 --> 00:15:25,120
a chopped

356
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,440
and straw stuff on top i can just take

357
00:15:27,199 --> 00:15:31,199
out because all the grain

358
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:34,000
is falling to the bottom so i can pretty

359
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:34,000
safely just

360
00:15:34,320 --> 00:15:38,480
grab this stuff and chuck it out

361
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:43,279
what's left in here is just grain and

362
00:15:40,959 --> 00:15:43,279
chap

363
00:15:43,860 --> 00:15:49,920
[Applause]

364
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:49,920
and i'll just sweep all that grain

365
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:58,000
down a little gap there

366
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:58,000
take the straw out

367
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:11,519
there we go ready for the next batch

368
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,519
underneath then

369
00:16:12,800 --> 00:16:19,600
is the bucket now this is full

370
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,199
of chaff and seeds so i'm going to run

371
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:23,120
it through a sorter

372
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:24,639
and then we'll do some winnowing and

373
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:26,480
we'll do some winnowing to get to the

374
00:16:24,639 --> 00:16:28,399
grain

375
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,560
and now we have the sorting machine

376
00:16:28,399 --> 00:16:34,839
which is a series

377
00:16:30,560 --> 00:16:38,240
of boxes basically with different sizes

378
00:16:34,839 --> 00:16:41,759
of screening them from

379
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:45,279
quarter inch to eighth inch

380
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:46,160
to window screen below and each one is

381
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,920
going to separate

382
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:52,399
out different sizes of seeds or chaff

383
00:16:49,920 --> 00:16:54,240
and what i want

384
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:56,560
is to save everything that comes out of

385
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:59,040
this gap so at the bottom of this chute

386
00:16:56,560 --> 00:17:00,480
i have a bucket that will catch

387
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,720
hopefully

388
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,240
most of the grain that's going to come

389
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,360
through so let's have

390
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,360
a look to see here

391
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:32,080
and now i can use

392
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:35,440
on the side here i've got a handle

393
00:17:32,080 --> 00:17:36,480
now so my angle isn't very steep so i

394
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:39,440
get a lot

395
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:40,880
that gets stuck up here and a lot of

396
00:17:39,440 --> 00:17:42,880
this is chaff but we'll get rid of that

397
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,840
on the next go through

398
00:17:42,880 --> 00:17:53,360
all right now i have my bucket of mostly

399
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:53,360
similar sized chaff and then underneath

400
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:58,160
are a whole bunch of seeds that are kind

401
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,880
of hard to see

402
00:17:58,160 --> 00:18:02,480
okay and now i have a widowing tower so

403
00:18:00,880 --> 00:18:05,600
essentially what this is

404
00:18:02,480 --> 00:18:08,400
so a fan sucking in air

405
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:09,679
it blows it up this tower and then back

406
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,240
out so there's

407
00:18:09,679 --> 00:18:13,520
good wind coming out right here now what

408
00:18:12,240 --> 00:18:16,799
happens

409
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,880
is i pour the chaff and the wheat

410
00:18:16,799 --> 00:18:20,240
into this hopper and it has a little

411
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:22,720
door a choke

412
00:18:20,240 --> 00:18:24,400
door that i can adjust here so it'll

413
00:18:22,720 --> 00:18:27,360
just let out a trickle

414
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:29,520
of the chaff and the wheat and the seeds

415
00:18:27,360 --> 00:18:32,080
will drop down in here

416
00:18:29,520 --> 00:18:32,960
and as they drop the wind will blow the

417
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:36,080
chaff

418
00:18:32,960 --> 00:18:38,000
up and out and down here the heavier

419
00:18:36,080 --> 00:18:40,799
wheat seeds will fall

420
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:41,600
and drop there's a screen here that

421
00:18:40,799 --> 00:18:44,400
catches them

422
00:18:41,600 --> 00:18:45,200
and then drops them into this bucket

423
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:47,360
this is

424
00:18:45,200 --> 00:18:48,880
a more a fancier way to do it than you

425
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,919
could i could just

426
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,240
sit with a bucket underneath the fan and

427
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:53,840
then

428
00:18:52,240 --> 00:18:55,840
pour the other bucket but that needs a

429
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:58,160
lot more attention and time

430
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:11,840
this only should take one or two passes

431
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:11,840
and the grain should be cleaned

432
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,559
at this point it's pretty clean that's

433
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:39,840
some here

434
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:39,840
i can just kind of

435
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:46,000
i finally gotten a system that i think

436
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:48,160
is working pretty efficiently

437
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:49,280
so i'll share that with you so the first

438
00:19:48,160 --> 00:19:52,900
step i take

439
00:19:49,280 --> 00:19:54,880
is i use my trusty uh threshing tub here

440
00:19:52,900 --> 00:19:57,919
[Applause]

441
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,160
and i grab a sheaf of wheat

442
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:01,280
and you know i've done this different

443
00:20:00,160 --> 00:20:02,480
ways in

444
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:04,799
other parts of the videos you'll see

445
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:05,520
where i can feed this directly into my

446
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,880
thresher

447
00:20:05,520 --> 00:20:09,200
but i'm finding this to be a more

448
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:10,080
efficient use of my time so what i do is

449
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:14,000
i hold it over

450
00:20:10,080 --> 00:20:17,679
my bucket by straddling it

451
00:20:14,000 --> 00:20:20,480
and then i just cut the heads off

452
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:22,159
now if this wheat has been bundled

453
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,280
really nicely and all the heads are on

454
00:20:22,159 --> 00:20:26,720
one side

455
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:30,640
i can get by with just cutting the top

456
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:34,000
half or so of the

457
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:37,440
the sheath into this bucket but

458
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,960
in many cases i end up having to

459
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:42,640
cut this wheat into quarters and just

460
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:44,640
throw it all in because the heads get

461
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:48,159
dispersed throughout the entire

462
00:20:44,640 --> 00:20:51,280
length of the sheath in future years

463
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:53,120
i might uh make more

464
00:20:51,280 --> 00:20:54,960
effort to make sure that everything is

465
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:56,799
aligned in the field

466
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:58,080
because that would mean i have to thresh

467
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:00,960
half the amount

468
00:20:58,080 --> 00:21:02,640
of wheat or half the amount of straw so

469
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:03,919
i still have a lot of heads in here

470
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:05,919
sometimes if there's only a few i'll

471
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:09,360
pick them out so now

472
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:12,640
i take this bucket full of

473
00:21:09,360 --> 00:21:13,440
cut up straw and drop it into my

474
00:21:12,640 --> 00:21:16,080
thresher

475
00:21:13,440 --> 00:21:18,320
and i can do about half a sheaf at a

476
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,320
time

477
00:21:18,480 --> 00:21:21,600
otherwise it gets overloaded and it

478
00:21:19,840 --> 00:21:22,559
won't thresh properly there's not enough

479
00:21:21,600 --> 00:21:26,159
space in there

480
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:28,640
close that up turn on two

481
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,880
switches i turn on the fan which i'll

482
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:33,679
show you in a minute

483
00:21:30,880 --> 00:21:34,960
the fan blows the chaff away as it falls

484
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,080
out from underneath saving me the

485
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:37,919
windowing step

486
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:45,840
that you've seen elsewhere in the video

487
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:45,840
and then i turn on the motor

488
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:54,159
30 seconds seems to be about plenty

489
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,360
then i can check look through and find

490
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,720
some heads

491
00:21:55,360 --> 00:22:00,159
and give him a feel if i

492
00:21:58,720 --> 00:22:02,480
try three of them and they're all

493
00:22:00,159 --> 00:22:06,159
threshed then i consider it to be

494
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:09,919
done yep all the heads are off

495
00:22:06,159 --> 00:22:09,919
so now this just goes in my

496
00:22:10,840 --> 00:22:16,480
wheelbarrow

497
00:22:12,130 --> 00:22:20,559
[Music]

498
00:22:16,480 --> 00:22:20,559
and the process continues i'll add more

499
00:22:22,960 --> 00:22:27,520
to the progression machine and start it

500
00:22:24,480 --> 00:22:30,960
back up

501
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:33,440
so what happens here is wheat and chaff

502
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:34,799
fall out of this this vent here in the

503
00:22:33,440 --> 00:22:37,120
bottom of the thresher

504
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,840
they hit here and the chaff is blown

505
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:40,000
away

506
00:22:37,840 --> 00:22:41,200
by this fan which i have on running on

507
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,520
the high speed

508
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:45,440
this is a trash can lid this is my food

509
00:22:43,520 --> 00:22:47,280
trash can that never actually uses

510
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:49,039
gets trash on it it's just a big

511
00:22:47,280 --> 00:22:50,080
container of food safe plastic that i

512
00:22:49,039 --> 00:22:54,080
keep clean

513
00:22:50,080 --> 00:22:57,360
um and this ends up obviating

514
00:22:54,080 --> 00:22:58,799
both the sorting that you saw as well as

515
00:22:57,360 --> 00:23:00,320
the winnowing for the most part i'll

516
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,840
have to winnow it a couple times

517
00:23:00,320 --> 00:23:03,280
but i don't need to use my big winnowing

518
00:23:01,840 --> 00:23:05,280
tower i have all this extra equipment

519
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,960
that i don't actually need to use now

520
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:23,840
so that's fun so here let me uh turn

521
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:23,840
this on and we can see it in action

522
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:39,200
and there's a little bit to toss out but

523
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:41,360
for the most part

524
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:43,200
this does a pretty good job with about

525
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:45,039
80 to 90 percent

526
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:47,039
of the chaff i usually have to deal with

527
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,000
so

528
00:23:47,039 --> 00:23:53,919
makes pretty clean and pretty quick work

529
00:23:50,000 --> 00:23:53,919
of the the rest of the winnowing process

530
00:23:55,840 --> 00:23:59,120
i take the half windowed

531
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:08,159
bucket our lid and pour it into a bucket

532
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:09,520
and then later i'll winnow this for the

533
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,960
remaining

534
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:14,960
small amount of of chaff that remains in

535
00:24:16,840 --> 00:24:21,520
here

536
00:24:18,799 --> 00:24:22,880
not fully clean but pretty close just a

537
00:24:21,520 --> 00:24:25,840
couple of rounds of winnowing will get

538
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:25,840
that ready to use

539
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:33,760
and now i'm in the garage i'm building a

540
00:24:31,440 --> 00:24:35,279
stand that's going to go behind my

541
00:24:33,760 --> 00:24:39,520
stationary bike

542
00:24:35,279 --> 00:24:40,080
to grind wheat and other things into

543
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:47,010
flour

544
00:24:40,080 --> 00:24:58,730
or other ground seeds

545
00:24:47,010 --> 00:24:58,730
[Music]

546
00:24:58,840 --> 00:25:12,739
so

547
00:25:00,350 --> 00:25:12,739
[Music]

548
00:25:15,039 --> 00:25:19,520
okay now what i have is my finished

549
00:25:19,600 --> 00:25:27,919
stand with my grain mill mounted here

550
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,400
and my wheel v-belt that turns down

551
00:25:27,919 --> 00:25:31,039
there

552
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:33,120
so what i need to do now is connect the

553
00:25:31,039 --> 00:25:38,159
belt

554
00:25:33,120 --> 00:25:39,919
so this is a variable length belt

555
00:25:38,159 --> 00:25:41,360
because this is kind of a long

556
00:25:39,919 --> 00:25:44,480
connection it's about seven

557
00:25:41,360 --> 00:25:46,720
feet of belt that i need

558
00:25:44,480 --> 00:25:48,480
and most belts aren't seven feet long

559
00:25:46,720 --> 00:25:49,039
plus i'd have to cut a hole in this to

560
00:25:48,480 --> 00:25:51,120
make

561
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,520
to get it through so this variable

562
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:55,760
length belt just seemed to be like

563
00:25:53,520 --> 00:25:58,559
the best solution to all of my all of

564
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,559
life's problems

565
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:05,360
other than the fact they are kind of

566
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:07,919
annoying to get set up but once they're

567
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:11,279
set up they're great

568
00:26:07,919 --> 00:26:13,679
they have less vibration supposedly

569
00:26:11,279 --> 00:26:15,440
than a regular belt and again this is

570
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:17,039
not a how-to blog so i'm not going to go

571
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:21,600
through

572
00:26:17,039 --> 00:26:22,840
the exact way to deal with these belts

573
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:26,799
because there are people with more

574
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,799
expertise on them than me

575
00:26:27,520 --> 00:26:32,799
but suffice it to say it's a whole bunch

576
00:26:29,200 --> 00:26:36,400
of links of a polymer

577
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,279
a polymer plasticine type thing

578
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:41,440
and they link together in a pretty

579
00:26:39,279 --> 00:26:43,840
clever way

580
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:44,960
got two there links through it's got

581
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:47,840
little notches

582
00:26:44,960 --> 00:26:49,360
and they're pretty cool uh so look up a

583
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:52,080
variable

584
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,360
or a link to b v belt on youtube and you

585
00:26:52,080 --> 00:26:54,559
can find all kinds of videos about how

586
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:57,919
they work

587
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:57,919
and what they're about um

588
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:04,960
i'll link to one here if i get around to

589
00:27:02,880 --> 00:27:06,960
it

590
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:09,039
all right the nice thing is i can put it

591
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,760
right through a hole without cutting

592
00:27:09,039 --> 00:27:14,880
a slot right because i have it in a in a

593
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:14,880
closed hole in the wood

594
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:20,000
the fewer openings i have the less place

595
00:27:18,840 --> 00:27:22,320
for

596
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:24,399
flour and other bits to get everywhere

597
00:27:22,320 --> 00:27:25,840
because

598
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,520
everything that gets covered in flour

599
00:27:25,840 --> 00:27:29,600
will attract rodents and then once you

600
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,440
get rodents you get feces and urine

601
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:32,880
and then it makes it unsterile and unfit

602
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,399
to use

603
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,000
so i really do want to keep this stuff

604
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,360
as

605
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:40,320
cleanable as possible and having a more

606
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:49,279
enclosed house

607
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:52,159
housing is one way to do that

608
00:27:49,279 --> 00:27:52,159
there we go let's see

609
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:58,240
hey it's turned the right way and

610
00:27:55,919 --> 00:27:58,240
everything

611
00:28:01,360 --> 00:28:08,240
now we have to limit this to 300 rpms

612
00:28:04,960 --> 00:28:13,200
so now i need to count how many

613
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,200
rpms this takes for every spin of this

614
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,919
cool it's only five that's awesome that

615
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:21,440
means i can turn

616
00:28:17,919 --> 00:28:21,440
at a much more comfortable pace

617
00:28:25,360 --> 00:28:31,840
oh yeah that's much better than using my

618
00:28:28,840 --> 00:28:31,840
arm

619
00:28:33,440 --> 00:28:37,520
and now i take that cleaned grain that i

620
00:28:36,000 --> 00:28:41,279
just cleaned

621
00:28:37,520 --> 00:28:42,559
all these bits of of wheat

622
00:28:41,279 --> 00:28:45,600
and i'm going to put them on top of this

623
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:50,640
hopper and fit these

624
00:28:45,600 --> 00:28:50,640
stainless steel burrs on my mill

625
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:58,000
i've kind of jerry-rigged

626
00:28:54,640 --> 00:29:01,279
a little hopper with a spout

627
00:28:58,000 --> 00:29:03,200
here it could be a little more permanent

628
00:29:01,279 --> 00:29:04,799
once i get it exactly how i want it but

629
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:07,919
for now

630
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:10,559
i'm going to do it with this

631
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,360
and again this can be run by a bicycle

632
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:13,039
and

633
00:29:11,360 --> 00:29:14,880
all winter i anticipate i will be

634
00:29:13,039 --> 00:29:18,240
running it with a bicycle so i can

635
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:21,360
have some exercise when i'm stuck inside

636
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:23,360
on the snowy snowy days

637
00:29:21,360 --> 00:29:25,440
but for today i'm going to run it on an

638
00:29:23,360 --> 00:29:29,760
electric motor

639
00:29:25,440 --> 00:29:34,720
powered by our solar panels and battery

640
00:29:29,760 --> 00:29:41,840
so now i will fill this hopper

641
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:41,840
with about three quarts of grain

642
00:29:44,960 --> 00:29:49,520
now usually i'm only going to grind this

643
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:51,360
right before i use it so i'm about to

644
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,960
use this flower

645
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:55,840
otherwise i just keep it in the berry

646
00:29:52,960 --> 00:29:57,360
form in these buckets in my basement

647
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:09,840
but since i'm going to use this flour

648
00:29:57,360 --> 00:30:09,840
i'm going to grind it now

649
00:30:16,820 --> 00:30:45,679
[Music]

650
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,200
okay now it's time to use the flower and

651
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:49,520
so this is

652
00:30:47,200 --> 00:30:51,440
some of the flower eye ground and this

653
00:30:49,520 --> 00:30:52,720
is not whole wheat flour this is whole

654
00:30:51,440 --> 00:30:54,720
grain flour

655
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:55,840
and i'm finding that it is much more

656
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:57,200
difficult to bake with

657
00:30:55,840 --> 00:31:01,360
than white flour that you buy at the

658
00:30:57,200 --> 00:31:03,440
grocery store the main reason is

659
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:05,200
when you're baking with white flour and

660
00:31:03,440 --> 00:31:07,279
you need it right we all

661
00:31:05,200 --> 00:31:08,559
most of us know that uh kneading it

662
00:31:07,279 --> 00:31:10,159
forms the gluten which are

663
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:12,640
chains kind of think of them as like

664
00:31:10,159 --> 00:31:13,919
elastic bands that form

665
00:31:12,640 --> 00:31:16,399
in the structure and that's what gives

666
00:31:13,919 --> 00:31:19,679
it that that bready

667
00:31:16,399 --> 00:31:21,360
consistency that we like the bran

668
00:31:19,679 --> 00:31:24,159
and the the germ and the other things

669
00:31:21,360 --> 00:31:26,960
that are left in the flower

670
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:27,840
act like little glass shards so imagine

671
00:31:26,960 --> 00:31:29,840
you have

672
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:32,159
a bowl full of rubber bands that you

673
00:31:29,840 --> 00:31:33,519
want to make the gluten right and then

674
00:31:32,159 --> 00:31:34,240
you throw a bunch of glass in there and

675
00:31:33,519 --> 00:31:36,559
you need it

676
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:38,240
it cuts all those bands to bits and so

677
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,880
you don't have that nice gluten

678
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,640
structure that you generally would want

679
00:31:40,880 --> 00:31:44,559
so i've had to adapt and i still don't

680
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:46,960
have a good handle on baking with this

681
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:49,519
yet so i'm still learning

682
00:31:46,960 --> 00:31:51,200
one tip that i did learn is that when

683
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:53,519
you

684
00:31:51,200 --> 00:31:54,880
mix it instead of putting your water and

685
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:55,440
your flour together and mixing right

686
00:31:54,880 --> 00:31:56,880
away

687
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,880
you want to let it sit for about 10

688
00:31:56,880 --> 00:32:00,320
minutes and that weakens and breaks up

689
00:31:58,880 --> 00:32:02,080
the brand and the other bits that would

690
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,600
otherwise break the gluten down it it

691
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:05,440
causes them to soften

692
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:06,799
and breaks less of your gluten so that's

693
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:08,720
one tip i've learned

694
00:32:06,799 --> 00:32:10,960
from the internet but i still have a lot

695
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:11,840
of adjustments to make in my usual bread

696
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,320
making process

697
00:32:11,840 --> 00:32:15,360
so i'm just gonna make a simple

698
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:17,840
sourdough

699
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,080
and here i have my sourdough starter

700
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:24,640
that i mixed last night it's active

701
00:32:20,080 --> 00:32:28,399
so i'll take my mixing bowl

702
00:32:24,640 --> 00:32:30,320
my scale and now i'll add a pound and a

703
00:32:28,399 --> 00:32:32,960
half of the whole grain flour

704
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:33,840
and then i'm gonna add a half a pound of

705
00:32:32,960 --> 00:32:35,360
white flour

706
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,279
just to give me a little extra wiggle

707
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:40,720
room and then i'm going to add

708
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:43,679
four ounces of this starter into a well

709
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,240
in the middle and then a tablespoon of

710
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:46,399
salt

711
00:32:44,240 --> 00:32:47,519
and since this is a two pound loaf i'm

712
00:32:46,399 --> 00:32:51,679
going to do

713
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:54,799
about 70 percent hydration so i will add

714
00:32:51,679 --> 00:32:58,240
a pound of water it's 50

715
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,840
and then another five ounces

716
00:32:58,240 --> 00:33:01,519
of water and then i'll mix that up real

717
00:32:59,840 --> 00:33:02,960
lightly just so kind of mixed in and

718
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:11,580
then i'll let it sit

719
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:12,880
for 10 minutes before kneading

720
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:16,240
[Music]

721
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:16,240
all right it's been 10 minutes

722
00:33:19,760 --> 00:33:23,760
and instead of just letting this mixer

723
00:33:22,159 --> 00:33:26,559
run or kneading it

724
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:28,240
continuously i'm just going to knead it

725
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:29,679
for a minute and let it rest for a

726
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:30,399
minute knead it for a minute let it rest

727
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:32,559
for a minute that if

728
00:33:30,399 --> 00:33:34,159
in effect has the same effect as needing

729
00:33:32,559 --> 00:33:36,480
it for 10 minutes if i do

730
00:33:34,159 --> 00:33:39,840
that on off on off for 10 minutes it's

731
00:33:36,480 --> 00:33:39,840
going to be the same effect

732
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,080
now instead of using my usual kneading

733
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:09,200
method it's risen some i'm going to

734
00:34:06,080 --> 00:34:11,599
just stretch and pull the dough

735
00:34:09,200 --> 00:34:13,280
trying to build up the gluten and the

736
00:34:11,599 --> 00:34:15,760
structure

737
00:34:13,280 --> 00:34:17,599
if i need it i'm afraid i'm going to

738
00:34:15,760 --> 00:34:18,800
overwork the dough really easily just

739
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,839
because of the

740
00:34:18,800 --> 00:34:22,639
the different nature of this so just

741
00:34:21,839 --> 00:34:35,839
draw

742
00:34:22,639 --> 00:34:35,839
and pull over

743
00:34:38,720 --> 00:34:41,250
i'll let that do a little more rising

744
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:44,360
now

745
00:34:41,250 --> 00:34:44,360
[Music]

746
00:34:45,359 --> 00:34:52,639
and now i'm oiling up a pan

747
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:55,359
and drop the dough into it now that it's

748
00:34:52,639 --> 00:34:55,359
risen again

749
00:34:56,560 --> 00:35:00,000
never mind the noise of the fire truck

750
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:03,839
being pushed around

751
00:35:00,000 --> 00:35:03,839
the floor over there

752
00:35:04,880 --> 00:35:10,800
so the goal is to give this a little bit

753
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,079
of a structure so i'm using the pan

754
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:14,000
i haven't gotten to the point where i

755
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:17,839
have enough control over this dough

756
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,839
to make a freestanding loaf

757
00:35:17,920 --> 00:35:24,480
but hopefully

758
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:28,640
the pan will give this enough

759
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:30,300
form that it will keep all of its

760
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:33,760
nice bubbles inside

761
00:35:30,300 --> 00:35:36,720
[Music]

762
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:38,480
let's see if i can if i can shape this

763
00:35:36,720 --> 00:35:41,599
thing it's pretty wet

764
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:45,839
and i don't want to overwork it because

765
00:35:41,599 --> 00:35:45,839
we'll just tear all the gluten

766
00:35:50,480 --> 00:35:57,949
[Music]

767
00:36:02,800 --> 00:36:08,480
that is one wet loaf

768
00:36:06,079 --> 00:36:10,240
i guess i could challenge reduce the

769
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:11,760
challenge on myself by making a drier

770
00:36:10,240 --> 00:36:14,640
loaf but

771
00:36:11,760 --> 00:36:14,640
all right let's get a

772
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,640
flower covered tea towel over that to

773
00:36:17,200 --> 00:36:21,839
rise

774
00:36:18,640 --> 00:36:26,000
they also say that it's possible

775
00:36:21,839 --> 00:36:27,760
to sieve out

776
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:30,000
white flour from this and you lose about

777
00:36:27,760 --> 00:36:31,520
a third of the content

778
00:36:30,000 --> 00:36:35,119
so i haven't tried this before but let's

779
00:36:31,520 --> 00:36:35,119
see yeah

780
00:36:36,880 --> 00:36:44,240
yep that would do it so here's all that

781
00:36:40,000 --> 00:36:46,560
bran and germ

782
00:36:44,240 --> 00:36:54,240
and other things left over from the

783
00:36:46,560 --> 00:36:55,680
grinding process

784
00:36:54,240 --> 00:36:58,800
so i can make brand muffins and other

785
00:36:55,680 --> 00:37:02,079
hearty things by adding that back in

786
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:03,440
and then here's the white flour oh yeah

787
00:37:02,079 --> 00:37:06,560
definitely

788
00:37:03,440 --> 00:37:09,359
so maybe i will

789
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:10,430
try baking with the white flour someday

790
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:11,680
but for now

791
00:37:10,430 --> 00:37:14,800
[Music]

792
00:37:11,680 --> 00:37:14,800
let's mix it all back in

793
00:37:20,079 --> 00:37:24,160
okay it's as risen as it's gonna get

794
00:37:24,960 --> 00:37:29,680
425 and fingers crossed

795
00:37:31,280 --> 00:37:36,000
well definitely not my greatest loaf of

796
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:38,800
bread

797
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:39,520
needs workshopping to work with this new

798
00:37:38,800 --> 00:37:42,320
flower

799
00:37:39,520 --> 00:37:44,000
is it getting better are you learning oh

800
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,119
yeah for sure

801
00:37:44,000 --> 00:37:48,960
yeah uh it's just that

802
00:37:47,119 --> 00:37:51,040
so used to cooking with baking with

803
00:37:48,960 --> 00:37:52,400
regular flour i did i did try and sift

804
00:37:51,040 --> 00:37:55,359
some of that some of it out and i

805
00:37:52,400 --> 00:37:57,520
totally can do that so

806
00:37:55,359 --> 00:38:00,079
i just did have you tried doing the

807
00:37:57,520 --> 00:38:00,079
overnight

808
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,839
same same thing yeah

809
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:13,440
it's all that sharp you know the bran

810
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,280
and the stuff and the gluten

811
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:17,760
you know what i should do is try and do

812
00:38:15,280 --> 00:38:19,359
justice i'll sift an entire loaf

813
00:38:17,760 --> 00:38:20,800
and do just white bread from the stuff

814
00:38:19,359 --> 00:38:21,920
that i've harvested just to see how that

815
00:38:20,800 --> 00:38:23,200
goes

816
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:25,680
and then i'll have all that bran we can

817
00:38:23,200 --> 00:38:28,960
do things with like i don't know

818
00:38:25,680 --> 00:38:31,040
brand muffins which are yummy oh

819
00:38:28,960 --> 00:38:33,839
melted over the sides and now it's stuck

820
00:38:31,040 --> 00:38:33,839
in here

821
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:46,000
yeah this one took a beating oh

822
00:38:43,839 --> 00:38:47,920
i mean the bread the the crumb itself

823
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:49,680
looks fine but the top

824
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:51,119
well that was not my finest baking hour

825
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:52,240
i used to work in a bakery i can

826
00:38:51,119 --> 00:38:53,680
actually bake bread

827
00:38:52,240 --> 00:38:55,520
um and i have other videos that i'll

828
00:38:53,680 --> 00:38:57,920
link to here and here about

829
00:38:55,520 --> 00:38:58,560
making sourdough starter and also uh

830
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:00,720
baking

831
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,880
baking bread so have a look at those for

832
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:07,040
a little more successful

833
00:39:02,880 --> 00:39:07,040
yeah a little more successful baking

834
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,160
yeah well that's all we have this week

835
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:13,520
thanks for joining us for this episode

836
00:39:12,160 --> 00:39:15,760
of foodmageddon i hope

837
00:39:13,520 --> 00:39:17,760
uh you learned a little bit about what

838
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:19,200
it takes to process wheat into flour and

839
00:39:17,760 --> 00:39:21,040
the amount of work

840
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,640
we take for granted when we buy a

841
00:39:21,040 --> 00:39:23,359
10-pound bag of flour at the grocery

842
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:26,400
store

843
00:39:23,359 --> 00:39:28,000
um wheat's been a

844
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:30,000
this has been a goal for me for for

845
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:30,720
years to do this um so i've been really

846
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:32,560
excited

847
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:34,400
uh and enjoying it for the most part but

848
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,200
i imagine that if i had to do this every

849
00:39:34,400 --> 00:39:38,720
year

850
00:39:35,200 --> 00:39:42,000
uh it would be it would become

851
00:39:38,720 --> 00:39:43,680
quite the chore um anyway uh

852
00:39:42,000 --> 00:39:45,440
