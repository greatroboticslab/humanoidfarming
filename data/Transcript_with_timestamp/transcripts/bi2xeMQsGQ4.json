  "text": "of the entomology graduate student\norganization I'd like to introduce dr. David Pimentel first I want to thank all\nthe organizations that helped co-sponsor dr. Pimentel visit including the ISU\nlectures program the graduate college the pesticide management and the\nEnvironment Program the Leopold Center for sustainable agriculture within the\nLeopold Center the IPM that's integrated pest management issued team the\nbioethics program and the Center for agricultural and rural development lots\nof organizations we couldn't have done it without all of them and this wide\nrange of organizations reflects dr. Pimentel his wide range of interests to\ndescribe dr. Pimentel to you I have to start by describing his scientific\ncredentials which are pretty extensive he's currently a professor of entomology\nwhich is the study of insects at Cornell University 50% of his appointment is in\nthe department of entomology to accommodate his wide range of\ninterests the other 50% of his appointment is as a professor at large\nof Agricultural Sciences including such things as energy use soil erosion this\nis the only such appointment at Cornell so someone with a unusually wide breadth\nof interests he served as the chairman of the animala G department at Cornell\nfor six years he has authored over 400 scientific and technical papers\nincluding having written two books and having helped edit another 14 books so\nin other words this is someone who is really excelled in pretty much all the\nways in which scientists measure success but that's not the main reason why the\nentomology graduate student organization invited him to speak tonight what really\ndistinguishes dr. Pimentel is his willingness to take risks\nand what I mean by that is his willingness to take public stands on\ncontroversial issues this is something that not a lot of scientists will do\nit's it's not necessarily the safest road to professional recognition but\nit's something that dr. Pimentel has done consistently by his example dr.\nPimentel shows us that scientists have a special responsibility to educate the\npublic because it's you the public that's going to have to make the\ndecisions about where the balance lies between the costs and the benefits of\npesticide use and we're very pleased to have dr. Pimentel here tonight to give\nyou some of the information that you're going to need to make those decisions\nthis topic tonight will be economic and ecological benefits of sustainable\nagriculture thank you again for a very kind\nintroduction I hope I'll live up to it I'm going to\ntake one aspect of sustainable agriculture for emphasis and that's on\nthe subject of pest control and I will have a few other things in there but I\nthink it well illustrates some of the problems we have the challenges and also\nsome of the opportunities we have to change the system and make agriculture\nenvironmentally sound and I'm going to try to keep this to about 45 minutes so\nthat we can have some time for questions I will be using slides to illustrate the\npoints that I hope to make if you could turn those on then I put these this\nfirst slide on to emphasize one point that we have I think we can make out\nwith I think the side lights on it but anyway it's that we one major problem\nand challenge that we have is trying to provide food for a rapidly growing\npopulation and is that the one this doesn't seem to work\ncan you either we're disconnected or did you change it or I did okay anyway the\nworld population is 5.5 billion and where we add a quarter of a million\npeople to the earth every 24 hours a quarter of a million that have to be fed\nand we already have a problem in feeding the numbers that we already have 1.6\nbillion humans are malnourished on Earth today with 2 billion living in poverty\nbut even the u.s. did I do that a you did you did all right\nthank you I'll rely on you now the United States in 1850 had 23 million\npeople or less than the population of New York State today in 1990 we went to\n250 million and my must admit that my number of 20 year 2070 is incorrect that\nought to be because the world population says I made this the u.s. population so\nI made this slide during the last three years has increased its well do both due\nto immigration and rate of reproduction in the u.s. is now 1.1 percent per year\nand so that should read now year 2050 that we will have a half a billion\nhumans in the United States assuming they don't increase further next slide\nnow our goal accosted in is to produce high-quality food in the US and\nelsewhere to feed people and the next slide a few people appreciate the fact\nthat the average American consumes 1,500 pounds of food per year and I've got the\ncalories in the so for three-quarters of a ton of food per person per year in the\nUS and the next slide we should be eating only about a thousand pounds of\nfood per year and this shows you where that excess is going that's part of our\nnational strategic petroleum reserve next slide now to focus a little bit on\non some of the pests and they do cause an enormous loss to our food system not\nonly in the US but worldwide next slide although they're attractive I suppose\nsitting in your corn it's not a great benefit if you want to save that corn\nnext slide worldwide there are about 67,000 pests that tried that che\nshare our food and that doesn't include the rodents or the mammals and the birds\nand the plant pathogens obviously dominate the system next slide now to\ntry to control these pests and limit their destruction of our food enormous\namounts of pesticide are used next slide 2.5 million tons worldwide and the u.s.\nuses about a half a million tons pesticide in one way that we waste\npesticide is the way we apply the material for example by aircraft if\nyou're spraying and I want to emphasize now this is under ideal conditions and\nvery seldom do they apply pesticides from aircraft fly under ideal conditions\nonly fifty percent gets into the target area I'm not talking to the target pests\nof the crop I'm talking in the target area and the new technology that's being\nadopted in aircraft application is called ulv are also low volume and in\nthose cases only twenty five percent gets into the target area and so the\nrest of this goes drifting off into our environment to cause problems that I'm\ngoing to talk about in a moment next slide now the actual amount of pesticide\nthat reaches target pests is less than one tenth of one percent which means the\nrest of it is again in our environment although a lot of this is in the target\narea but is still in our environment of course some of that will move out of the\ntarget area in addition next slide now in general pesticides do have a benefit\nwe in the u.s. spend 4.1 billion dollars annually in pesticides and it's\nestimated we save about 16 billion dollars in crops thus for every dollar\ninvested we get about four dollars in return but I\nI emphasize now that does not include however the public health and\nenvironmental costs of using pesticides these are the direct benefits and do not\ninclude any of the costs social or environmental that are involved in using\npesticides and I'm going to get into that issue in a moment next slide now in\nthe US we lose in other words despite the use of the 500,000 kilos the\npesticide that we use we lose 37% of all potential production to insects diseases\nand weeds and incidentally the world figure is 35% now the reason in part we\nuse a large quantities of pesticide but still lose on average slightly more than\nthe world is the difference in cosmetic standards for example a lot of the\nfruits and vegetables that you see on the Guatemalan market or in India would\nnot be saleable in the US so this is all based on saleable products and this is\nin part why our losses are slightly higher than the average in the world\nnext slide now some interesting data that indicates some of the problems that\nwe're having and mismanage when I term it is the crop losses due to insects and\nthese are USDA data in 1945 before we started using the new synthetic\ninsecticides we were losing about seven percent of our crops to insects and\ntoday am i standing in the way of this projector the law all right let me stand\nover a little bit you can still hear me okay all right they sighs in 1945 when we we did not use any\nsynthetic insecticide that's when we started and we were losing 7% of our\ncrops to insects in 1992 after insecticide use it increased tenfold\ncrop losses according to the US Department of Agriculture now 13 percent\nin other words nearly a two-fold increase in crop losses due to insects\nwith a tenfold increase in insecticide use now you might say how the hell could\nthat happen well the reason is for the most part changes in agricultural\ntechnology some changes in cosmetic standards and their pesticide resistance\nand a few other problems next slide and destruction of natural enemies and and\nso forth the next slide also illustrates a little bit better using corn as an\nexample related to the agricultural changes in agricultural technology in\n1945 for example almost zero insecticide was used in in corn production and today\ncorn is the largest user of insecticides in the nation VDOT cotton about 4 years\nago now next slide when we started with 1945 most of the corn was grown in\nrotation and we didn't have a problem with the corn rootworm complex of\ninsects and today about half the corn has grown in rotation and half is not\nnext slide and now with corn being the largest user of insecticides there's\nbeen over a thousand fold increase in insecticide use in corn production in\nthe US and again going back to you da next slide the data that corn losses\nto insects according to the USDA have gone from 3.5 percent to 12 percent with\na thousandfold increase in insecticide use and it's primarily due to a change\nin agricultural technology that is moving away from crop rotations next\nslide now our land is extremely important to\nus and I wish I could have spent some time on the on the soil degradation and\nsoil erosion problem but I'll leave that for a another time but land is extreme\nnext slide if you people appreciate the fact that 99% of the world's food comes\nfrom the land less than 1% comes from the oceans and freshwater aquatic\nsystems and so we should be very concerned about the our soils and the\ndegradation of these soils by erosion and various other means including highway construction urbanization and so\nforth and you'd appreciate the problem in part\nthat during a 30-year period from 1945 in 1975 of just agricultural land from\nhighways and urbanization we blacktopped over the equivalent area larger than the\nstate of Ohio that's just highways and urbanization\nand if you took all the areas that would blacktop over over that period it would\nbe both Ohio and Pennsylvania but the agricultural land alone was greater than\nthe state of Ohio next slide now when we do apply pesticides as I mentioned by\naircraft and especially if they're near housing areas and so forth you do have\nthe serious drift problem and the impact of pesticides on the public is\nsignificant next slide is world data from w-h-o the total number of human\npesticide poisonings worldwide is or about a million with 20,000 deaths in\nthe u.s. we also have a problem next slide the human pesticide poisoning\nsixty seven thousand it's more than sixty seven thousand each year twenty\nseven deaths and the estimated cancer associated with pesticides aprox list\nabout ten thousand per year so it is a significant public health problem in the\nu.s. not as severe in the rest of the world but certainly it's it's it's\nimportant next slide now we also when we use pesticide in particular insecticides\nwe do destroy some of the natural enemies and this costs us money the next\nslide gives an estimate of the cost to the nation that's us in the destruction\nof natural enemies estimated to be five hundred and twenty million or about a\nhalf a billion dollars next slide and then pesticide resistance these are\nworld figures about five hundred and four species of insects that are\nresistant and well close to 900 total species pests that have become resistant\nand this is a very important problem in the US as elsewhere in the world next\nslide nope I guess I didn't have that number but anyway the estimated cost of\nresistance in the United States is 1.4 billion dollars annually John and this\nis due to the extra pesticides as to treatments increased crop losses due to\nthe resistance problem it's certainly a major environmental\nproblem and then of course pesticides do get into streams and lakes and destroy\nfish and this is totally an under estimate but it would be somewhere in\nthe neighborhood of thirty million the realistic figure is probably three or\nfour times that next slide and then when we do use insecticides in particular\nhoney bees and wild bees are killed and that is a cost to the April culturalist\nand it's also a cost to agriculture from the point of view of reduced pollination\nwild bees and honey bees are important to pollinating about thirty billion\ndollars worth of agricultural crops annually and a conservative estimate is\nthat the impact of pesticides on tame or honeybees and wild bees is about over\nthree hundred million dollars annually next slide and then some other\ninteresting effects that you can get when you're using pesticides is using if\nyou use an herbicide for example 2 4 D on a crop such as corn that it creates\nother pest problems that is it may help control the weeds but you do create some\nother pest problems and these are data on corn showing that with 2 4 d it\nrecommended dosages that the corn leaf aphid population was nearly three times\non the treated corn that is treated with herbicide than on the untreated and\nanother next slide the corn borers for example were significantly more abundant\non the treated corn that is with 2 4 d then the untreated and furthermore these\ncorn borers grew 33% larger on the 2 4 d corn and produced 33% more eggs than the\ncorn borers the untreated corn and we also checked\nit out on to diseases corn leaf blight and corn smut disease and both was\nsignificantly increased well actually the corn lost its\nresistance the southern corn leaf blight when we exposed it to 240 and the corn\nsmut disease was 5 times larger on the treated corn those are the only\norganisms we looked at but it does show you the significance of the interaction\nof some of these pesticides in the impact on pests next slide I'll skip\nthat's in part some of the changes that we observe and then birds Osprey and\nvarious other birds that do become exposed to pesticides next slide the\nestimate is that pesticides are causing about two billion dollars worth of\ndamage to birds using a very conservative estimate that I explained\nto if you liked it some time next slide and then groundwater and well water\ncontamination and I understand that it's a serious problem here in Iowa also it's\nestimated that if we did an adequate job of monitoring well water and groundwater\nfor pesticides that it would cost a nation 1.3 billion dollars annually I\nremember that's strictly monitoring it's not doing anything about the problem\nnext slide and then of course pesticides do reduce species diversity and it's\nestimated worldwide that it's not used just due to pesticides but due to all\nthe factors such as removal of forests that we're losing about 150 species per\nday due to our various changes that humans are causing next slide now the\ntotal environmental cost of using pesticides back to the United\nStates we estimate to be at least eight billion or another way to put it more\nthan eight billion dollars annually so it is a significant cost now pesticides\nstill are benefi benefits in terms of economics if you factor that in on the\ncost benefit originally I told you that you get $4 returned for dollar invested\nwell if you would factor even this 8 billion now I realize that this is a\nconservative figure this 8 billion but if you factor it in it still turns out\nthat pesticides are a net benefit for the nation\nnow I'd learn a turn next slide to what we can do in managing our pest control\ntechnology to improve it and hopefully make it more profitable next slide and\nthe basic principles that I have it related to sustainable agriculture is\nthat we make maximum use of our biological resources and to minimize our\nenergy inputs in the system in other words actually minimizing our management\nof these resources next slide and related to sustainable agriculture in a\nstudy that one study that we made it does take more labor especially if\nyou're going to make use of livestock manure and the recycling in the system\nand that is one major problem in the u.s. is that we're not making effective\nuse of that manure is polluting our water polluting our surface waters and\nwasting a very valuable resource next slide and we can confuse consumers\nparticular model situation related to corn we were able to buy some a being\nselective of the tractors and the equipment that we had reduced\nthe total fuel input from 115 litres per hectare to 70 major well about 40%\nreduction in fuel inputs next slide and then our actual corn yield in this\nparticular system we are actually able to increase the yield in the sustainable\nsystem we were using a crop rotation system here and so that we were able to\nget a higher yield and with no insecticide being used in this\nparticular system next slide now as far as energy goes we were able to in fact\nreduce the total energy inputs by 1/2 that is from seven point eight million\nkilocalories per hectare to 3.7 million Killa Killa calories per hectare reduce\nsoil erosion from 20 tons per hectare to one and obviously reduce the water\nrunoff and reduce the amount of pesticide being used in this particular\nsystem next slide now dollar-wise it was also the cost of\nproduction were reduced from five hundred and twenty three dollars per\nhectare to three hundred and fifty two dollars per hectare and that does\ninclude the additional labor xx sorry 20 percent more labor that we had in that\nsystem next slide now related to pesticides for\ncountries if you include on a character Ontario in Canada as a country I have\nmade the decision to reduce pesticide use by 50 percent and Denmark was the\nfirst country to do that and sweden ii and sweden in 1992 or last year it\nalready achieved their 50 percent reduction in pesticide use and this year\nthey've implemented another program to another 50% reduction in pesticide use\nwell what we did at Cornell was to make a study I think there's 40 different\ncrops and all of the non chemical technologies that exist and then examine\naren't asked well two questions could we in the United States implement a program\nto reduce pesticide use by 50 percent and how much would it cost and that's\nwhat technologies we already have available similar to course that Sweden\nor Denmark or Netherlands are implementing next slide well skip next\none now what one of the things we want to do a course in your trying to reduce\npesticide use is make better use of your natural enemies such as this a fat lion\nthat you see here next slide and that makes making judicious use of\npesticides this is the potato beetle and using crop rotations and short season\npotatoes anyway there are a lot of different technologies that we can use\nto deal with some of these serious pests next slide and I'm not talking about\ntotal elimination of pesticides I'm talking about reducing the amounts that\nare that have to be used through implementation of non chemical controls\nthrough the judicious use of pesticides and crop rotations are a benefit not\nonly to insect control but diseases and weeds and obviously help reduce soil\nerosion and soil degradation next slide and then because one weapon that we have\nin pest control against insects is using some of the diseases that affect them on\nthe slide here you see the the one on your left the caterpillar\non your left is a healthy cabbage looper the cabbage looper on your right is one\nof the whitish one is full of virus crystals and these virus crystals have\nlooked like pure crystals under the microscope and that animal is totally\npacked with virus crystals and it's a highly pathogenic virus if you take two\ncaterpillars well such as the next slide 24 hours later this is the cat l and if\nyou just take two caterpillars like that and you mix them in a hundred gallons of\nwater and spread it over an acre of land you can kill 98% of the cabbage loopers\nthat are present there so it's a very effective highly pathogenic organism\nunfortunately even though every one of us in this room was eaten the virus in\nour coleslaw or lettuce and so forth and not affected us or at least not that we\nknow APA is still not approved the use of this virus yet next slide now there\nare a lot of and I'm not going to go through all the loads that's just a list\nof some of the non chemical controls that are available to us that we can use\nand implement to reduce pesticide use and you can't there isn't any one of\nthem that is perfect and what we should be doing is being very selective and\nusing those that are most appropriate and I guess that what Professor Pedigo\nsaid is very appropriate there is no silver bullet for pest control and we\nought to be using a combinations depending on the particular situation\nthe pest and the environment the crop and and so forth next\nslide but it does illustrate the complexity that we're dealing with and\nthis is a shot in Kansas that the lake professor painter provided me showing\nyou wheat on the right here the susceptible to the hessian fly and we on\nyour left that is resistant to the hessian fly and so this is one more\ntechnology that is available to us and can be used effectively depending on the\ncrop depending on the pests and so forth next slide now I'll skip that one the\nnext one that's well anyway I know what the what I hope to be my last slide is\nthat that we could achieve a 50% reduction in pesticide use in the United\nStates you can turn the lights on and without a reduction in yield without a\nchange in cosmetic standards and that we could do this with an increase in food\nprices of only 0.6% now what I also emphasize that this calculation of a\npoint six percent increase in food costs implementing a 50% reduction in\npesticide use does not include the benefits of public health of reducing\npesticides on public health or reducing pesticides on the environment if you\ntake into consideration those benefits Aventa costs I in general there should\nbe a net benefit to society by reducing pesticide use by 50 percent and it can\nbe done as a one country has already achieved their\n50% reduction in three others are unwell on their way to achieving this 50%\nreduction so this is not something that is pie in the sky I'd be happy to answer\nquestions very well I guess we got quite a bit of time no way good\nany comments a question I what are two bits of information in Central America\nwhere we were working on cotton because the I was going to say the workers were\ncareless I should really put it the other way around that is that the\nmanagers of these firms were very careless they sprayed these workers\nwhile they were in there in the field they allowed to fit their field workers\nto go into the field to pick cotton or weed right after the fields have been\ntreated and so that they were getting wet with the pesticide in there that of\ncourse we don't do in the US but even in the US right after DDT was banned and\nthere was an increase in paradigm and several of these other more toxic\nmaterials there was about a three-fold increase in the number of deaths in the\nu.s. now one has to say if we were careful there shouldn't be these deaths\nbecause we know how to handle it safely and so forth but of course accidents do\ndo happen and in Central America we also would know how to handle it but it's not\nbeing done and I'm not just blaming Central America there is the curse\nthat's where I mentioned Central America only because we worked there for a while yes and of course you know that has problems\nbecause I know I'm sweet in some of these other countries some of these\ntoxic materials and so that's there's no good way for we were using the same\nmaterials or reducing the materials to achieve really amount of the frequency\nand so forth is still there it's just that yeah materials more active with\nappeared oh that there was a reduction when in corn we haven't talked to the\npyrethroids so really you know it's not sure\nyeah yeah that's a that's a good point and by rejoyce have their problems in\nviola yes to make the shift yeah you couldn't do it overnight well I'd say in\ngeneral sustainable agriculture is more knowledge intensive so it takes more\nknowledge now to do that of course it means that you've got the training\npeople to use this new knowledge in new approaches and that would take time to\nachieve a sweet knitted in five years some of the other countries are have\nplans to do it in about 10 years but it's not substituting alternative\ntechnologies but chemicals will take training ten dollars yes there would be no increase fertilizer\nuse know we didn't decrease to fertilize the use in that sustainable system that\nwe had there through use uh well first of all keeping the soil in place that is\npreventing 20 tons of soil being lost from the land you know each ton of soil\nhas about four kilos of nitrogen plus other nutrients but making use of\nlivestock manure in that particular system not did cost us in labor of\ncourse to do that but as far as reducing the pesticide no there was no impact on\nthe fertilizer I would say we on corn there was decreased energy but I\nwouldn't want to say that for all the other crops because we now know we have\nto really look at that crop by crop in general I would guess that it it\nwouldn't increase the amount of energy but I wouldn't want to say that a\ndecrease in either at this at this moment yes the question here is Sweden and Denmark\nappear to be progressive and will we ever in the United States achieve this\ntype of a change I think we will but if I look for the DD banning DD T is the\nmodel decision then I would say it takes us 10 years after Sweden to get to the\npoint where we will make a similar decision but I think the climate is\ncertainly coming and remember this change in Sweden and Denmark did not\ncome from agriculture or entomologist it came from the politicians listening to\nthe people now already in the United States and the survey by Food and Drug\nAdministration I didn't know there was 97 and 96 percent some of that vicinity\nall the public are concerned about pesticides in their food today growing\nconcern in the credibility of EPA has dropped significantly yes and so there is this climate and\npressure to trying to do something about it in and certainly once we see the\nsuccess of Sweden and Denmark and Norway - although they haven't passed\nlegislation that they certainly well on their way and the Netherlands and the\nprovince of Ontario incidentally in Ontario the specialist who's in charge\nof reducing as implementing the program to reduce pesticide use\nI thought the farmers would be resistant to this and he talked about opposite he\nsaid the Pirates are highly supportive of this whole program to reduce\npesticide use and he said the three reasons one pesticides cost of money -\nthey're the ones that are applying these toxic materials and they're being\nexposed their families being exposed and three they also have a concern about the\nenvironment I must admit I didn't expect this talk about all three not just the\nlast one but they're really highly supportive of this program out there I\ndon't know about Sweden and Denmark well it never asked a question there someone\nelse had a question yes sir herbicides insecticides and punishment\nright and then the actual reduction that we look at paper in achieving this\nreduction we could achieve the greatest reduction in herbicides second and\ninsecticides and lease fungicides and you know price supports is playing a\nvery important role in reducing crop rotation and it's also played a very\nimportant role in separating livestock production from integrated with grain\nproduction and so there's a whole array and the marketing orders as far as\nchanging cosmetic standards not that that's important in the brain so much\nbut there's been a whole array of factors that the government I'm talking\nabout federal government has played a very important role in encouraging soil\nerosion and cryogen fertilizer use and encouraging pesticide use and so one\nfirst step would be to get the damn government straightened out and\nsupportive of sustainable agriculture in reducing our reliance on chemicals and\nthat would be the very first step and let me yellow and indicate in I think we\ncould go beyond a 50% reduction if you will allow changes in the price supports\nand deficiency payments and marketing orders and you'll also allow this to use\npesticides at dosages that are effective instead of using the label dosages on\nthe pan and I indicated mentioned this afternoon I have one of\nmy past students in Galway he's working with true and he is demonstrated clearly\nthat in using certain insecticides that using one-fifth or one-tenth the dosage\nis on the label he can get more effective control and I want to imply\nmore effective control because he's a lot he can save the natural enemies and\nmake use of them in the pest control system so now if you'll let me do some\nresearch and determine the appropriate dosages we could go further than that\nreduction if you will allow me all those changes combat extent his marketing\nprice apart and getting the proper dosage I think we could go to a\nseven-year",
