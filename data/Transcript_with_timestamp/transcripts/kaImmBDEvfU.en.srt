00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:07,359
kelly robertson granular csa with

3
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,000
precision crop services

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:13,759
so kelly in your updates you talk about

5
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:16,960
goal so what is go gold g-o-a-l that

6
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:19,520
means get out and look get out of the

7
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:21,039
cab of the tractor the sprayer

8
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,800
get out the field

9
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:24,560
look at what your tillage tool is doing

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,160
look at what your planter is doing look

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,480
at your seed depth

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,640
you know all of those things don't rely

13
00:00:28,480 --> 00:00:32,320
on all those monitors and fancy gadgets

14
00:00:30,640 --> 00:00:34,960
we've got in the cab

15
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,960
uh or or looking you know six feet above

16
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:38,719
the ground from a glass bubble thinking

17
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:41,280
you know that everything's okay you need

18
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,719
to get out and look it also means get

19
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:44,800
out of the pickup

20
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:46,879
yeah so if you're driving by a field and

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,120
something doesn't look right stop the

22
00:00:46,879 --> 00:00:50,399
pickup literally get out and walk across

23
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:52,719
the field yes

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,640
so planting depth i know

25
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,320
you know everybody's got the old timer

26
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:58,399
pocket knife they pull out and that's

27
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,559
how deep they plant or you know the old

28
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,280
knuckle method that's how we d deeply

29
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:06,560
plant or we use our digging tool about

30
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:09,280
our planting dev so what else can we do

31
00:01:06,560 --> 00:01:11,200
about checking planting down so if you

32
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,720
want to look at your

33
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,040
your planting depth and you want to look

34
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,280
at sidewall compaction or how your row

35
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:20,080
units are doing typically what we use is

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,520
a is a measuring tool like this

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
and you get out here and you start

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,000
digging around well when you're doing

39
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,560
this

40
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,080
you're disturbing a lot of what has

41
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:29,840
happened

42
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,280
as a result of the planter or the

43
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,280
tillage tool going through the field so

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:35,600
you don't get a good idea of that so one

45
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:37,840
of the things we are going to use today

46
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:40,240
is just this leaf blower to just start

47
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:42,240
kind of blowing the loose soil off of

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,079
where the row unit went so that we can

49
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,240
look at the the job the row unit was

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,240
doing what the closing wheels were doing

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,640
and how the seeds placed in the seed

52
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:51,640
trench so

53
00:01:51,790 --> 00:02:05,980
[Applause]

54
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:27,650
[Applause]

55
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,280
so here's an instance where we could see

56
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:41,920
several different things going on in the

57
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:44,480
in the row unit so right here you notice

58
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,640
after we blew the the this off that we

59
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:49,840
noticed this line here and that's where

60
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
his two by two uh nitrogen is going next

61
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:52,560
to the uh

62
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,800
next to the row

63
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:56,720
uh here we have the seed trench as you

64
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:58,879
can see

65
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:00,400
so we've got a little bit maybe just a

66
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:02,720
little bit of sidewall compaction but

67
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:04,480
notice it is loose for the most part it

68
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:06,959
didn't blow out with the

69
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:08,480
with the leaf blower but it is loose the

70
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:10,720
other thing that you can notice if you

71
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:12,640
look really closely as you can see where

72
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,159
the spike closing wheels

73
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,480
have ran

74
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:19,040
down through this unit so

75
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:21,440
overall we've got about a two

76
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,879
inch and a half two inch around two inch

77
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:23,920
planting depth

78
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,840
um

79
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:28,000
not seeing a whole lot of information

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,000
here or evidence that shows me that

81
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:31,920
we've got much if any compaction

82
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:34,400
happening

83
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:36,400
but i mean this is a good way to look at

84
00:03:34,400 --> 00:03:38,560
what your role units are doing

85
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,239
and the conditions that you planted into

86
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:41,840
to determine what kind of compaction you

87
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:44,400
might have

88
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,040
