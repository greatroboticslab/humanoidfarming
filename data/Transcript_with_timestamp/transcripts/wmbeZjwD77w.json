if I could take you around and show you just what a general day is here on the Stony Ridge Farm so we'll set these goodies right here they'll probably blow off on the ground wind is whipping at about 20 M an hour and uh we've got a little bit of work to do so I've got the Unicorn Dodge truck sitting out here big te we're going to be in that tractor in just a minute we got cows to feed track uh four-wheelers to move tractors to move all sorts of fun stuff so and we got to make a road trip it's going to be a fun day go ahead and the kenel go ahead in the kennel I've got a cinder block on top of my dog food uh container here and if you guys don't know these make the best ever food containers for Animals these are the brute food containers and this is my little concoction of CBD oil so I'll give Buddy a little scoop right here he doesn't mind the flavor of the CBD oil I think it kind of stinks I think he really likes it so we'll just dab a little bit on there that's probably uh plenty for Mr Buddy and into the food bowl we go ready happy boy free such a smart dog just a great animal I hate that uh that he's doing so badly but you know about the time a dog gets good you know what I mean by the time a dog gets perfect it's about the time they start having health problems and I really hate that we're going to be taking the Unicorn Dodge here in just a little bit on a road trip so stick around let's grab the ATV we're going to run up to the shop open the garage door I'm having trouble the wind catches this door this is a crappy situation right here I need to put an automatic door closer on here that's coming soon oh in this bag are oil filters for my ATVs and I keep a stockpile of oil filters and a few things on the four-wheeler here so let's fire this puppy up this is a blue Becon [Applause] on close that garage door back or the cats will get in there shut her down Beaver every day I take up a new tiny load of tools these are called ratchet scrunch they're awesome chainsaw tool and we'll go on inside the shop real quick here open the door aloro okay ratchet scrunch goes in the catch all table you guys have one of those and this is my Honda oil filters and Honda parts dump all those oil filters in there and I can't throw stuff away I have a problem throwing stuff away so I just got motor oil in my mouth I'll save this so when I uh take some beef to a beef customer I have a nice bag good heavy duty bag from the Honda place this is where the beef for the farm is kept I'm running a little bit low on beef right now however I am going to take out uh as you guys can see the freezer is almost totally empty I'm going to take out uh got a ribeye or two I think I'm going to take out I've got these are my last RI eyes right here and uh I think I'm going to take a few out let them thaw this is a ribeye right I'm having a with my Butcher and the reason I can't sell my beef is because of my butcher this is not a ribeye that is a ribeye okay that is a ribeye that's a New York strip but that says ribeye on it that says ribeye on it and that's a New York strip that's not a ribeye what else we got down here I don't know those I don't think those are ribe eyes this is a ribeye that's what do you guys think I'm a little disappointed you know what let's just use that bag it's a good thing we got that bag ain't it I'm going to take and load my freezer up at the house nice chuck roast I'll throw that in the uh insta pot and I'll have some good food for tomorrow excuse my mess this shop is a wreck it's always a wreck I come in I work and I

Milwaukee M18 tire pump you'll see why we need that in a second all right um I need my battery charger and my portable power station is somewhere somewhere shammers so this is not sponsored by the way this is a blue Eddie portable power station we'll turn it we got 100% power right here just unplug that guy that's going out with us that's heavy now if I can just remember what I did sun's really bright today if I can remember what I did with my battery charger I've got a hundred of them but one works best it works better than all the rest and it's just a little cheapy here it is so I've got it over here keeping the vent track battery topped off we'll be mowing here pretty soon there we go unplug responsibly you'll see what this is for in just a second all right stay I know there's something else I needed but I can't remember what it is you know how that is there's something else I needed from in here and I'll remember it about the time I get over to the cows H well let's just give you a quick shop tour while we're in here this is a mess this is my shop and it's a total absolute disaster of a mess it won't be that way for long and if you guys follow the channel this might be interesting to you this is where I do some of my videos right here and we've got lighting lighting lighting uh and this Mount right here which holds a microphone and a camera and then we've got a table right here where we do a lot of work so I rebuilt the chainsaw on that table and I do a lot of stuff like that that's what I need to do I got a chainsaw scenario going on out here I'm going to grab me a pair of gloves glovis we're going to go out to the outdoor kitchen this is the outdoor kitchen from Carolina Barn builders awesome awesome outdoor kitchen that's called a gather Grill I'll post a link this is the coolest Grill I've ever seen underneath here we got a griddle and a grate and you build a fire and this thing rotates around so it's like a lazy Susan it's patio furniture and it's a grill it's expensive and it's worth it I did a chainsaw video out here gosh months ago and the chainsaw has been sitting here ever since so let's put the chainsaw back together real quick this is that tool that I just brought in it's called a ratchet scrinch it's a ratcheting scrinch chainsaw tool really cool I was out here working on chainsaws trying to get everything ready for winter and like I said it's been several months uh since I was out here got a big gooey ooey gooey mess off every chainsaw leaks Bar Oil if you guys know a secret to make them not leak let me know it's just every chainsaw I have all right this is a husa 460 Rancher the first chainsaw I bought when I bought the farm ouch good good right let's make sure this puppy fires up good pull our choke chain breake contact oh come on right on it's all I need to see now put our Scabbard on gra all of our tools you guys hear the cows mooing I can hear them it's like your babies crying you can hear them even in

the grease off this table too tubble towels good for everything this thing is gross you don't use tub of towels you just ain't living right the cows are over there mooing and it makes me very suspect

you guys in the video description we'll get this guy up and rolling you simply put it on there and you can set it and forget it so I going to turn it on I have a memory I've set set it at 40 PSI that's it set it forget it walk away when we get back my tire will be up unless it's off the rim [Music] [Applause] [Music] this is George George has got a battery issue let me show you real quick George's battery is dead as a door nail that's how we call it here in the southern regions of the United States reason he's dead is because I left a switch on thanks Josh good job make more work for yourself already got the hood up and I tried to jump this off of the jump box the other day battery was too dead to jump with a jump box so this is the solution and it's really cool this is a power station portable battery bank I will post a link to it it's the elite 200 and all I do is take my battery charger set it right up here so I plug it in and then I hook it up and it'll charge this car battery all the way back up to full charge with fingers crossed I didn't destroy the battery plug it in negative positive power on 99% AC power on you're hooked up to our battery we have 1.6 volts sh put that thing on the slow charge right bring our Hood down put this food over here looks like Buddy's having a little bit of a fun time lounging what you doing friend hey boy what you doing friend

not happy campers right now y content clear prop you charge now oh hard LIF Clyde hard LIF [Music] really windy over here looks like I've got a mineral block already out in this little pasture we'll scoop it up and take it to the cows they are probably balling because they want their minerals there we go cows are all right there now there there's buzzards in the air above the cows this means there could be a situation with a pregnant cow huh let's see hey bud hey big bud uh-oh fourwheeler there we go hey big bud you okay this morning huh you okay good boy good boy all right want to try this want try some salt block or you want to butt it you want to butt it with your head or you want to try it we'll check that out there this is the one that's balling that's Cindy I don't know why she's crying but she just going to have to cry every day I roll out hey to the cows today they get an afternoon bail tomorrow they get a bail in the morning and in the evening so we're stretching out three ba over two days they get a bail and a half every day that's how it works and they're ready you guys hungry woo dude that cow is peeing and the wind's blowing so hard the pee blew and hit me in the face yuck Lew Lew the farm runs on ATVs low pressure talk about that in a second this is a Greg Judy bail un roller green pastors farm.net you guys are GRE Judy fans tell them you saw me talking about them on Stony Ridge all right we're going to back up we'll hook up to this hay B [Applause] [Music] that Cindy is really fussy over there she normally not like that oh it's a tight squeeze I'm too fat here we [Music] go come on sometimes the hay bale sticks to the ground pretty good raises the fourwheeler up off the ground a little bit timbero w [Music] [Laughter] come on little girls come on kids come on kiddos this is called net wrap these are all net wrapped Bales they keep better Outdoors than a twine wrapped bail okay take the net wrap off cows can get that in their stomach we got to be careful not let them get any in their stomach make them sick could kill them shake it up stuff it on the fourwheeler unhook the great Duty bail unroller take my arm tip it up and we unroll you kids ready for some snacks hey butthead how are you this morning little good girl [Music] [Music] so that's how we unroll the hat to the cow it's pretty simple takes about 10 minutes a day keeping 50 cows like this and it's round about 50 typically takes me somewhere between 30 minutes to an hour a day depending on whether I film a live stream uh now typically I'll hook up to another bail but today we're running and gunning we got work to do so we're going to leave it alone and get it in the morning first thing 7 [Applause] a.m. oh that's good that's good [Music] workout 10 WS 2 we're ready for the next bail now you want real farm chores you want real world I pick up 10 rocks a day every day no matter what every day at least 10 rocks on the farm so we're on a quick Rock hunting Journey you see I've got some rocks here we're going to toss those in a gully in a second all right all right here we go one oh come on come on here two [Laughter] three four five 6 7 8 9 10 overachiever Award right here I get my gold star today let's take them and Chuck them over in the ditch good cows good girls and [Music] boys quick head count we got 10 babies I counted them there's Tammy wait a minute another bonus Rock hot dog a man that was a miss this is my video game for the day right right some people are gamous I'm just a rock picker uper see all the hay that scattered out on the land right here along with a lot of manure on the land what this does is allows us to farm regeneratively okay there's Hay all down through here in gullies and ditches and on the top of the hill think about it okay we're putting the hay up on the top of the hill the cows eat on the top of the hill they poop eat on the top of the hill and it rains and the nutrients wash down the hill a't that cool it's a lot of knowing and doing and smars going on these are remnants over in here you see a bunch of rocks that's remnants from an old Tobacco Barn that used to be right here and simply going to pull right up here shut her down Beford we're going to Chuck these rocks over in that there ditch we keep chucking rocks in the ditch the rain comes in we get a little erosion the dirt catches next thing you know that ditches a flat spot we got more pasture what hey Stony Ridge farmer don't you have a rock picker how come you ain't using a machine to pick those rocks up I can't ride around here all day picking up little bitty rocks with a machine there's not a machine for everything on the farm that's a common misconception these Mega Farms make folks think that everything's done from the seat of a tractor and it's just not the case on a small farm guys share your stories with me it's not the [Applause] case all right cook my electric fence back that's my fence charger this is pretty cool check it out going to have links to this soon this is a electric fence monitor from sensor Tech got guys awesome I can tell every day every morning when my fence is working and when it's not working and actually that setup right there shuts itself down at about midnight and starts back up at sunrise every morning I had no idea until last night this is a first day trying that new sensor way cool let's get back on the blue Becon we're going to go back and we'll move the uh tire pump to another tire [Music] those two blue balls that you see floating right there two little blue things that tells me my water system is working properly we're also checking the water system over on the other side where the cows were too long as those two blue balls are sticking up like they should be then we know the water system is working all the water on the farm is pumped via solar so we have a solar well it only works during the daytime so so the cows have enough water storage in those tanks to keep them watered overnight they don't really drink a lot at [Music] night just riding by the chicken coop there I can tell they need a little bit of water we're going to get feeding water here in just a little bit might check the honey bees real quick too we lost one beehive this year but there was still honey in there and I'm letting the bees gobble that honey down check it [Music] out there's a lot of bees man I ain't hanging out for [Music] that let's check on this truck see if that battery got any more voltage we may have to give it a boost because I really killed that battery and it's not a new battery and it's a Walmart never start battery too let's see what we got well says 12 volts already 80% charge no no way no way we're going to boost it hit it with a booster no way it's 80% charge that quick find that hard to believe let's just see no way here we go yeah right my sneaking suspicion is this battery is so fried this truck has been sitting here and I haven't used it very much I've just been working on it and fixing it it's actually going to be sold here soon great truck 5.0 L but uh it's not a AGM battery there we go uh 50 L I just don't drive it I don't use it I've got too many vehicles as it is and uh I think it'll make some young man or some young woman a good truck or somebody a great farm truck too yeah let's check on the tires on Uncle Jesse [Music] lock would you look at that would you look at that we're all pumped up and it shut itself off how much battery do we have left three bars awesome put our valve stem cap back on this truck has really crappy tires this is going to be in future videos um I just haven't had time to work on it I need to make time to work work on it really all right this one is a pain and you know what to find the oh there it is okay we got to go up around and backwards let's see how this works there you go there you go little friend memory 40 PS on Just for Giggles let's see if Uncle Jesse will fire up man I think Uncle Jesse might just fire up okay got a pull choke here and Uncle Jesse's keys aren't in here so we can't have fun a the fun police ran I know where his keys are let's go get the keys and see if Uncle Jesse will start oh keys please yeah this thing sucks shifting another chore I needed to do we got a lot of high wind last night this is all old Lumber that I reclaimed these are all Oak boards and such they came out of a barn that was here on the farm and I've got Oak uh hand hun logs up under here all up under there right so all that stuff is going to be future uh construction materials for the barn dominium that we're going to be building out here I hope you're subscribed to the channel let's get this covered up so it doesn't rot and go to waste stinky just like that trash bag I can't throw stuff away I just can't do it I just see potential in everything I don't know why that'll catch up with me one day or when I have grandkids that have to clean this place out oh the dual tires are pain in the butt to get air in a come on there we go uh so I got to climb down here and get the other Tire if I can I know it's around here somewhere shammers shammers there it is right in there go memory 40 hit it look at them tires it's a bad set of tires oh all right what do y'all think Uncle Jesse going to start or is Uncle Jesse's battery super dead too oldie but goody call this truck Uncle Jesse because it looks like Uncle Jesse's truck from Dukes of Hazard I don't know kind of fun what's life without a little fun she's a four on the floor buddy come on back here we go that ain't the right key here we go yeah yeah yeah might be out of gas fuel pump fuel pump man come on there buddy gosh we should not give up on this let's go get a gas can just in case glug glug glug I spy Uncle Jesse has an issue a drip drip drip from the tube there got to replace that I said we put a splash in the carbonators come on now oh let's see that this truck has a dull heavy this is the dirtiest engine bay of any vehicle you've ever seen guaranteed look at that oh man let's try it without putting gas cuz it's so nasty I got to super clean this entire thing look at that that is so gross come on now Jesse oh let me down number two attempt number two choke pum that gas battery's a little weak this dude's got very little gas in it it ain't got no gas in it oh come come on now Jesse all right this ought to make that starter sing baby put that jump box on there here we go yeah you're ripping it now rip it and rip it baby to the floor oh man come on Jesse this Gulu box has a boost feature hit that boost button that makes it that thing sling it started to sling that motor around come on Jesse come on little I know what I need to do wonder if I have enough fuel in that gas can let's open up this here breather thingy make sure ain't no squirrels in it air filters seen better days get a little L of water in that carburetor a little bit of that spark of juice in there just a little there you go bud just a little come on go okay here we go Senor yeah Daddy it's a fuel issue for sure fired right up soon as I got fuel I wonder if the choke is you ripping it come on give her some gas it's got to get fuel all the way from the empty gas tank all the way into here we know it runs I can't give up what do you guys think should we give up should we go get another can of gas we're eating up some battery on this Gulu oh yep got a leak here that thing spraying gas all over me you ain't living right unless you get a little 9 and3 Octane on you get her done all right I'm not sure how much gas went in the gas tank and how much gas went in the floorboard got to get that filler neck handled got to pour it all there we go get a little bit in there gosh poured it all in the truck nobody ever accused me of being that bright here we go come on baby I didn't have the choke on before come on baby just keep running just keep on that's six gallons in there it should pick it up fuel pump pick it up bro bro do I have to go down and get another like thing of gas I don't want to do that it's flooded I can smell it all right well we know Uncle Jesse runs and we've overheated the uh jump box stay tuned for a future video this truck has a dump bed and I need to just clean it up get it squared away and uh use it on the farm it's a dump truck man great dump truck I bought it from my neighbor actually did a little horse trading for it oh well see what she says 1% we'll put her own engine starter she said ready oh no no no she not ready all right we're going to let that charge while we go we got to grab a tractor across the farm here bring it up here and get it filled with fuel that way it's good to go we're going to be running the Sawmill [Music] tomorrow this door is about to make me mad man it what happened was the wind caught it it sprung it it broke this hook right here that holds it in place I just need to go buy a new one I think but what happened it sprung the hinges all the way back and now it's not shutting like it should oh now it shuts like it should oh man good it's getting a grab when it's real cold outside these steel buildings tend to swell and shrink and sometimes I'll find that door just blown open and it just basically tries to rip it off I was saying we're going to go over the other side of the farm and uh grab a tractor and bring it over here but I think we're going to take the fuel to the Tractor not the tractor to the fuel this is the Unicorn Dodge truck this is my fuel set up right here and uh it's a little bit janky janky shanky that's okay now the reason I call this the Unicorn Dodge it could be more of a unicorn if it was a sixspeed and a one ton douly but it's not contact but it is a cumings baby she sounds good so why am I filling up this tractor it seems unnecessary right well I'm going up to Virginia that's what the Virginia folks call it Virginia Virginia and and we are going to fill up the fuel tank in the back of the truck here because fuel is about 20 cents cheaper per gallon in Virginia than it is in North Carolina uh we're going to use off-road diesel but it's still cheaper up there it may be under three bucks a gallon yeah I'll fill this diesel tank up probably three times a year and that's all the fuel that I'll need for the year here on the Stony Ridge cows do most of the work but I got to come in and clip behind the cows Sawmills way over here this is my land that's my neighbors's land we're pretty cool I take care of their property for them most of the time um they just reimburse me for fuel I've talked to them about leasing uh their pasture for the cows and at some point we may do that or May moh but for right now I'm just mowing it keeping it up keep it pretty the cast loader is right over here I'll show you guys what a cast loader is this is why I didn't drive my nice truck down through here it's muddy right here and that truck just got a wash job try to keep my trucks clean at least the ones that I use anyway if y'all remember we'll get you a little footage right here of uh building this bridge built this bridge last year while we're walking this is the log yard there's some trees down here I've got to get cut up you'll see that in a future video These are logs that are going to go on the Saw Mill all this is going to be milled into 2x4s so we can finish out the Tool Crib in the mega shop that you guys were just in just a minute ago this is the cast loader and this is the wood meiser lt40 and I've already been over here making a little bit of lumber you can tell but this is a job for tomorrow cast loaders from TNA Distributing we got a triel grapple on the cast loader that we're moving our logs and all of our brush with we're going to have a big old bonfire pretty soon pretty awesome this is a mini articulating loader meaning it bends in the middle so it's just a mini loader cast mini loader um again from topnotch equipment out of Minnesota contact yeah and it's way low on fuel I ran out of gas in this thing one time not fun not cool and don't don't don't leave the door open I busted the glass out of it one time too so check it out when you steer see how the tire gets closer okay we got a loader and then we got a button on here that extends the loader so the boom extends our uh forward and reverse is right there and that's just how easy a cast loader works very fun my fuel light is on on this thing which means not good got to get over there and get this thing filled up the reason I didn't uh drive it across the farm was cuz I was afraid I was going to run out of fuel with it this thing will turn on a dime check it out there's a sawmill I mean look at that that's so [Music] cool hit it yeeh this thing's a little sensitive on fueling up up it does not like full trigger pressure when I fill it up it'll kick back a little bit so I got to be careful you know what I just noticed a little something here the tire is low on this so I just so happened to bring over the tire pump we're going to go ahead and fill this tire up see a little bit low right there well a lot of bit low that's pretty soft again if you don't have one of these pumps on your farm you just need one even around the house we're going to go to 24 PSI ask me how I know I've I've had to fill that tire of at least 20 times just got a slow leak okay it's cool [Music] be careful don't mess up my pretty [Music] truck let's give the news baby [Music] [Music] oh let me show you something this looks like a 2000 Dodge commercial man this truck is so nice ain't she pretty gosh told them when they bury me dig a hole big enough for this truck and put me in it right here clear prop we're off to Rural King and here's what we're picking up at the Rural King oil is cheaper there I'm picking up hydraulic fluid for the Gale rt210 and it says hydraulic fluid capacity 21.5 Gall and I got all the specs right right here so I get the right stuff things are cheaper at Rural King it's worth a drive we just passed Martinsville Speedway right back there got some pretty cool arcade tractors sitting out here I wonder if anybody will recognize their friend Stony Ridge Farmer in the store here today fingers crossed this used to be Kmart my brother used to work here at Kmart back in the day and uh had a lot of fun in this parking lot doing donuts in the snow after hours back in my high school days got my wallet this one's going to be expensive I know it is uh I have to question the sanity of Starbucks you know Starbucks has a brand new Starbucks right here in the Rural King parking lot they ain't Starbucks people come on now come on here this is going to get pricey save five bucks though I like it all right I got to read my specs hvv LPD 46 hydraulic 0530 I guess it's 5W30 [Music] boys and girls that one stung that's a $500 bill right there ouch ouch ouch let's see how much fuel we pump it's going to be an expensive day again I did buy two batteries I happen to know there's a new F350 coming to the farm stay tuned for a future video we're rescuing a 7.3 L Power Stroke F350 you guys are going to love it por rinds that's my vice can't go in ryal king without getting a snack all right let's pump some diesel woo that was expensive off-road diesel $35 cents baby yeah I put diesel power service in it every single time no matter what ever since I've been doing that I have had no fuel problems on the farm before I did that I had fuel problems all the time I'll post a link I use this with every tank no matter what guys one half of these will do about 50 gallons this says it treats up to 250 gallons it's 100-gallon tank see how expensive this gets $222 that's a $700 day let's go get on the tractor and get busy mowing man I got a 10-minute drive home h go eat be free be free I love him chickens mhm Let's Get Busy mowing water uh-oh that water bottle too big oh man oh there's my there it is
