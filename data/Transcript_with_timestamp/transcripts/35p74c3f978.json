focus of this presentation is that many variables that should be considered when assessing farms land and farm infrastructure for a rental or purchase our presenters this evening are Ben Waterman and Cathy roof Ben Waterman coordinates the land access program at the center for sustainable agriculture and provides free consulting services to landowners and farmers on natural resource management farm Enterprise startup foreign land conservation land use regulations and farm tenure Ben works closely with UVM extensions new farmer project to develop our educational resources for small farmers and the startup stages of their business Cathy roof is co-director for of land for good New England nonprofit that specializes in working land access our sons last all right specializes in working on land access and farm succession she's worked for over two decades on beginning farmer and farm land tenure issues she also coordinates the Northeast sustainable agriculture working group so welcome and and Cathy thanks Jesse and I welcome everyone to part two of this webinar series Kathy and I will be presenting although I have the majority of time on the floor for this part of the webinar series that kathy will chime in when as needed or or whenever you feel the need Kathy feel free to chime in before we start just curious again where is everyone from if you could enter into the chat box just just the state that you are from once again that would be really helpful give everyone a chance to practice using the chat box there okay can everyone hear me no one no one's entering anything into the chat box here so use this smiley face if you can hear me great so let's let's try it this way then use the smiley face again if you're if you're farming in Vermont or if you live in Vermont and how about New Hampshire New York massachusetts couple people Rhode Island Connecticut has anyone from anywhere else where are you from melville okay well thanks it's it's good to know where people are coming from which will try to give it seems like for the most part we're all from the Northeast region or New England so we'll try to relay some information that's pertinent to everyone here feel free to stop me at any time or into your questions in the chat box as our slides go on we'd love to to try to cater this presentation to to your needs into your questions so again feel free to use the chat box and if we can't get to your questions immediately we will try to address them as the webinar goes on so a brief recap of part 1 of the webinar series a couple weeks ago Katherine I went over basic land access concepts and we went through a wide variety of options that farmers can pursue to acquire land and gain access to it and one main take-home message from that part 1 of the webinar series was that you don't have to own land to acquire it and various lease arrangements and other scenarios can enable you to get onto the land with without necessarily purchasing it and last webinar we also went through the types of leases and what what is incorporated in a typical lease and we also touched on a little bit about where to search for fun land but tonight's webinar will center around readiness concepts and planning and preparing for farm tenure and we'll also go through assessing particular parcels the tools and resources you can use to learn much more about a particular site that you are interested in so to get ready does everyone recognized the group on the right here this is this is the temptations initially I was going to come out and sing their song get ready but as Cathy do you want to go ahead and sing that song to get things going here and get ready no and I guess there's only three of us with the microphone Jessie would you like to sing get ready all right well let me try all right here get ready cause here I come Twitter Leedy and Twitter lead um look out baby cause here I come how was it I'm job hey just try to get everyone's attention here so I you can either clap or use some of these icons if you like the little song there so getting ready for farm land tenure involves various things that we're going to be discussing in the next half hour or 45 minutes before we get into the principles involved in assessing particular properties so so briefly we're going to be talking about determining whether or not land is your limiting factor we talked about evaluating your needs versus you wants integrating family values considering ownership costs this this is a big one right here it's a lot of times beginning farmers underestimate how much it's going to cost them actually to own land or what are the costs involved in actually leasing land they needless to say I have enormous implications for moving your farm business forward we're going to go through a farm land purchase and leasing considerations that can be integrated into a business plan and we'll also look at if you're looking to acquire a farm through purchase we'll look at how to prepare for approaching a loan officer or obtaining a loan to do so so as land acquisition right for you um you know what what really is your your limiting factor in in in moving your farm business forward or your your your family life forward a lot of times there are other things that might be holding a new farmer back and and land might not be on the top of that list so there are other typical challenges that are associated with that are that are the typical barriers to starting up a farm it could be lack of production knowledge and skills it could be you don't have markets that are developed yet you know the huge one is there's not enough time it's that's not talked about a lot but the truth is for a lot of beginning farmers there's just no time to work on the farm because they have to oftentimes work off the farm so it is is addressing the land axis very going to be the first thing that's most important to moving your business forward and that's that's the main question you know what so if if it's if lack of production knowledge and skills is the main barrier then maybe before looking into acquiring land it's best to look into the various apprenticeship programs or even get a job on a farm so you really hit the ground running once you do acquire land capital there's there's not there's not as much as a fine line between lack of capital lack of land that kind of go hand in hand but oftentimes you can get financing or capital to start a business that's that's not centered on the land piece you don't need 40 or 100 or 200 acres of land necessarily to start a business with making productive use of your assets and capital and it's needless to say it's really important to filter out your needs from your wants now this is assuming that that you're that you have already identified that you're limiting factor is indeed land access or at least it's a major limiting limiting factor for you now what what type of land or what what type of tenure situation or scenario is going to fulfill your needs in terms of let of what what is most limiting to you what type of land you need in other words so this is otherwise known as the minimalist strategy if you're really focusing on what it is you need out of a property and it's kind of counterintuitive but if you can sort of filter down what you actually need out of a property or out of a farm tender situation it actually opens up more 10-year opportunities that's really a counterintuitive but the fact is that the real viable opportunities are going to open up to you when they're more based on what you need and when and they're more based on the scale of business that you're at so north other other words there be more realistic opportunities available for you if you can really focus on what you need out of a property versus what you want everyone wants the the farm property that's on the cover of all the magazines but could you are you going to be able to manage that type of property when you get onto it even in the long term is it something that you could grow into those are questions that are worth asking from the get-go in terms of garner garnering support for your farm operation you might be reaching out to community members for financing you might be approaching loan offers once you do get access to land you might be reaching out to two loan officers to extend you a loan and my experience has been that people are much more willing to support an operation that they know is making more less than you know they have too much to handle so that's something to keep in mind and then of course in terms of protecting yourself from unexpected costs they're huge costs associated with owning and in leasing more more land that you need more land that you can use productively so in order to protect yourself from that risk it's good to really focus on what what you need this is a checklist that's available in holding ground which kathy had a huge part in in writing this is a guide to northeast prime land tenure and stewardship it's currently available for sale at the New England small farms Institute bookstore and this page is page 31 out of that text i highly recommend everyone getting ahold of this if they are serious about acquiring land either through lease or purchase or alternative other alternative means it goes through all sorts of scenarios all different options in in acquiring land and this is a great checklist that can guide you through some of the considerations that you can make and I apologize to everyone because the the text might not be readable here but the way Kathy's laid it out here is that you're really you're looking at each of these factors whether it be location land-based climate infrastructure housing or the history of the land and you're you're assessing for your particular situation whether or not each of these factors is necessary to your to your farm operation or your family ambitions whether or not they're these factors are desirable or optional so you know it's really it's sometimes it's tough to go to keep in your head all of the considerations that that can be made when looking into respect really at your potential for running off of viable farm operation once you do acquire land so this kind of lays everything out on one page for you to use Family Values is not often considered people are very excited usually to start farming to get onto the land but you really in some cases committing to a long-term endeavor and it can be important you know this is this is a great picture of a happy family um you know I not sure who the farmer would be in this picture but I'm sure the rest of the people would appreciate being close to the farmer you know maybe helping out throughout retirement no that's that's the case I uh I don't know if Jesse mentioned in a small bio when we started out but I'm trying to establish a small fruits farm and my father has expressed the desire to work on it throughout his retirement so I'm gonna be putting my dad to work hopefully um but it's hard to do that when you're far away needless to say there are complicated issues involved in in figuring out what's best for the entire family you know not often times it's not a line necessarily with what's best for the farm business but it's definitely good to keep in mind that the things might be in balance I've heard a lot from farmers who are established and say I wish I had settled down closer to family or in some cases I you know I wish I hadn't settled this close to my family yeah I wish I at least they there at least a half hour away instead of 15 minutes and banging down my door every day but so I think you guys get the point there as I mentioned before considering ownership costs oftentimes farmers don't consider every cost that goes into owning land so this would be specific to those out in our audience here that are looking to purchase land and we'll talking a little bit about how this applies to if you're leasing land but for the most part there are several ownership costs two types of ownership costs depreciation is when you are when something is degrading and value over time and this this applies to infrastructure on the form this does not apply to land land as an asset that is well known to not depreciate you can't you can't declare in your taxes that your land is depreciating land generally stays at its as its present value or appreciates in value whereas barnes fencing equipment and other infrastructure tend to depreciate in value just over time they're going to rust and they're going to wear down and that's considered a cost to whoever is owning that piece of equipment was ever zoning that that that piece of infrastructure it's not necessarily a tangible cost you're not going to be paying someone else for for the depreciation costs but when it comes time to selling an asset that you own you're going to be getting a lot less for it over time as it depreciate interest commonly amongst agriculture economists interest is an opportunity cost so this is this is not really referring to the cost associated with paying down a mortgage interest in this case is referring to the opportunity cost for owning land in other words if if one of you or a farm owner purchases a property for a hundred thousand dollars you could have used that hundred thousand dollars at the Wall Street of the stock market or you could have invested that hundred thousand dollars in the CD and you would have been been getting three percent interest on that so that's considered an opportunity cost that you're missing out when you lock up your capital or your hundred thousand dollars in a piece of land repairs and maintenance I've been living by this statement here everything works great until it breaks I there there is definitely truth to it and and there's there's a definite cost associated with repairing and maintaining any equipment or infrastructure that you have on the farm and we'll go in a little bit more detail about that in the following slides taxes on property now this is one of the most underestimated ownership costs for people that are new to acquiring land they can be taxes on your property can be significant it's it's a lot easier these days or in some cases assume you have good credit or you might have some collateral ah'd easier to get financing for the loan to purchase property but the question is whether or not you can pay taxes on that property over the long term and there are ways to assess your tax hit or your potential tax hit that is going to be associated with a particular property and we'll talk about that in a little bit and lastly insurance again if you if you're going to be owning a farm you're going to need insurance on your property whether that be casualty insurance or liability insurance in some cases if you're inviting the public onto your forum and those can be considered ownership costs is everyone still with me is it please use the smiley face feel free to use the chat box and enter your questions as they come up so a little bit more detail about ownership costs when you're talking about infrastructure equipment and buildings you can use this this equation it's known as or this formulas known as the dirty five and that's again going back to the previous slide you can see the DDI the are the t in the eye it's this slide just gives formulas to how to assess those exact costs so if you're looking at depreciation you're looking at if you're looking at the depreciation on the tractor the original cost might be $20,000 the salvage value might be one thousand dollars when it's all said and done when you're when you're ready to sell it so you divide that over its useful life so you're basically taking the the the original cost of the item and determining how many years it's going to take for it to lose all its value and you're breaking down the costs over that many years and for interest you're looking at the original cost minus salvage value divided by two you're basically looking at the the average value of your investment whatever whatever money you're going to have the owner is going to have locked away in the asset you're looking at the average value of that asset over time and then you're multiplying that by the interest rate that's you know that the going interest rate which which does fluctuate but again this is an opportunity cost so you know it would depend on the period that you're looking at and I'm assuming you could take an average interest rate to determine an actual opportunity interest cost for repairs generally speaking of the this the repairs can be one to two percent of the replacement costs for buildings now this is based on formulas that agricultural economists have done all over the nation they've done surveys of farmers about how much are you spending per year on on repairing and maintaining buildings beyond the average has been one to two percent how much have has farmers have been spending per year on repairing and maintaining machinery average has been about three to five percent of costs now obviously your particular situation might differ and you know depending on the particular tractor you're looking at there a particular building repairs and maintenance might not be these actual numbers but these are the averages taxes for buildings you're looking at the property tax rate which is going to be determined at the town level and you're looking at the assessed value which again is determined that the town level but it's yeah I'm not sure how it is in other states but towns here in Vermont they have each town has their own appraisers and Lister's that will come out to your property and assess the value you know they'll list it in the grand list of the town and then they'll tax you based on the the going rate and insurance again a general formula you're looking at the replacement cost for buildings on the one percent of that replacement cost is generally what you're going to be paying in insurance and for equipment again to ensure that equipment you're looking at the average value times about one percent so I know that's a little bit complicated and might not be applicable to your situation right now but it's a good thing to keep in mind if you do if it ever does come down to figuring the actual ownership costs and as will mention a few minutes landowners if you look into leased land land owners will going to want to be assessing their actual costs for only land so they can try to determine a cash rental rate to charge a tenant farmer so they'll be looking at this formula in detail and it's good to know what a landlord is going to be looking at to try to find some middle ground doing the number that they determine from this formula and the number that you'll be able to handle through your business or the going market rental rate and we'll talk about that in a minute or two getting a little ahead of ourselves here sorry about oh sorry everyone I think I hit the wrong key here and went to the end of the slideshow just bear with me here so again the dirty five formula is one way that landlords can estimate now this is this is relevant to if you're leasing it's a situation if you're looking to lease a property you're trying to determine a price to pay per year per acre for cash rental on the land owners are might be using this dirty five formula to estimate how much they could charge you as a farmer tenant and in most cases all of those ownership costs put together the depreciation interest repairs taxes and insurance oftentimes all those costs put together are going to be way more than a farmer can actually pay based on their enterprise plan so if one hundred percent of these costs cannot be covered by the farmer what percentage of the cost can be and that's for you guys to determine if you are farmer looking to lease land it is suggested that you determine what you are actually able to pay for cash rent so this involves the careful estimation of what you are going to be returning from your farm business per acre and it also involves a careful estimation of what you need to live what your what are your family needs and how much is your family or your or you yourself spending per month on all of your living expenses and then you can determine what you're able to pay for cash rent aside we've outlined a basic formula here your neck now this is not for a cur but you use just generally speaking for the whole deal your net returns before your lease payment this is from your farm business and net returns being your income after all of your expense all of your other expenses are paid such as fertilizer in such as seed and and whatnot it's going to be that net return minus the percent that you need to reinvest into your farm operation that you plan to reinvest into your farm operation over time minus your family needs equals how much is left over that you could afford to pay in your total cash lease payment so these are some some basic business planning principles that can go into figuring out how much you can handle for for cash rent and it it enables you to develop a middle ground between what you can handle or my or i should say between what you might want to pay for for lease land and between that and what a landowner might want to charge you and then number three there is is careful examination of cash flow so you need to know when you'll be able to pay a landlord the lease payment you need to know when cash is going to be available in your particular business cycle if it's you know if you're going to have a horde of cash in October after you've you've sold all your produce in September then you know maybe that's the time to schedule your lease payment instead of in in February when there's when cash flow is next to nothing again they can't really overemphasize as a farmer you need to know what you're able to handle financially and in terms of purchase it goes the same way are you able to handle the purchase based on your off farm income based on the income that you'll gain from the farm Enterprise once you do purchase land and are you able to handle so between that you're off farm income you're on farm income and your savings are you able to handle the down payment on the purchase of land are you able to handle the closing costs you are if you have a real estate agent involved you can be paying them three percent plus or minus if you have an attorney involved you might be paying anywhere from four hundred to a thousand dollars in closing costs you know and you have and there's other costs associated with getting financing depending on the terms of the loan that you might be getting to purchase land need to make sure that you can handle all of these costs and then and then of course your monthly mortgage payment based on your income and can you handle these ownership costs a lot of times number two they're the monthly mortgage payment the banks will make sure that based on your income you can handle that that payment based on your cash flow from off farm income or based on the farm business they're going to they're going to be reluctant to extend you alone unless they know that you can handle that payment but rarely do banks make sure that you're going to be able to handle ownership costs there you know they a good loan officer will ask you if you can handle taxes and insurance and repairs and all the equipment and maintenance that you have for the farm so number three is really something up for you guys to keep an eye on closely you should be keeping an eye on all these but number three won't be handed to you on a silver platter you can really be need to do some research on your own some general business planning considerations for leasing you can get a tax deduction based on you on the money you're paying in cash rental per year that's why it often makes sense to lease land you're actually you're paying less taxes by deducting your your expense of making your lease payment and again you have to time your cash flow for your lease payment schedule that's important you need to have cash on hand for other factors that are going to be involved in your leasing land you're going to be paying liability insurance in most cases if you're leasing you're gonna have to cover minor repairs and regular maintenance so it's great to know or to plan beforehand to know that you have that cash cash on hand and again for capital improvements this is something that you would it could be assessed at the point of considering which particular improvements that you might be undertaking at a particular property you need to know if you're going to be making that investment that's generally start-up costs if you're if you're making a capital improvement you know it's not considered as a business expense but if you're going to be making a significant investment in in a capital B let's say you're building a greenhouse in a particular property that you're leasing or you're adding on to a barn it pays to know where that money is coming from and what the strategies that is going to be for retaining equity and that infrastructure improvement once it is made in other words if you're paying for a twenty-thousand-dollar barn improvement and if you're leasing that land what's going to happen when you when the lease term expires how are you going to be recouped for your investment that you've made as the farmer tenant and lease terms as kathy went over in the last webinar the terms of your lease can specify what what is the formula for determining how tenant farmer can get repaid for their investment and what are the terms that that go along with that so these are just the 5 CS of credit if you if you do decide to approach the loan office of Finance here for credit in order to purchase a property a conventional loan officer is going to be evaluating your case based on these five criteria it easier to remember the 5 CS of credit and again this is for most conventional lenders whether it be the Farm Service Agency state agricultural credit corporations or commercial banks they're going to be looking at your character capital conditions collateral capacity now character lenders will be judging you based on what you know how professional you are presenting yourself they're going to be for the most part trying to get a sense of how well you know your business if you're looking to acquire a farm in order to run a business you need to really know your business well and so they're going to be asking you questions about how you pertaining to how we try to get a gauge and how well you know your business for the boat for the most part though lenders use the objective credit score to do to as a major measure of your character lenders don't like to make character judgments because they you know they can get a really bad rep for not extending a loan based on someone's race or ethnicity or sex or and so on so lenders do like to use the objective measure of your credit score when it comes to judging your character in the context of whether or not you can handle alone so I guess the bottom line there is that if your credit is poor and you hope to get a loan it's worthwhile to try to build your credit and I'm definitely not an expert in where to go to to to get help with that I don't know if Cathy have you run into that at all just general resources where for that farmers can tap into to help build their credit back to help build their credit back if they have bad credit not not really not any more so than anybody else here in Vermont we have a central vermont Community Action Council various community based economic development organizations that work with with people on their taxes they work with people counseling family budgeting there are various community based organizations that that offer free financial counseling that you could go to to help build your credit back up I'm here in Vermont I'm not sure about the rest of the region here so moving on to capital lenders are going to need to know that what's on your balance sheet they're going to need to know that do you have assets that exceed the amount that you're that you are taking out a loan for are you primary they're going to be looking at what kind of debt you have already do you have do you have too much debt to be taking on more and that go that ties into capacity are you going to have the capacity to actually repay a loan and this is based on your income streams based on your off-farm income based on your info on farm income and whether or not you could afford monthly loan repayments and sometimes a lot of the agricultural land lenders will extend an interest-only loan for the first couple years if they know that your business model is not is not such that it can cover principal and interest just to start out I know farm does that across the region and I recently met with an FSA loan officer and they do that as well that's something to inquire into if you don't have a capacity to repay principal and interest you can get an interest only loan that will convert into a regular term loan or sometimes a balloon payment based on your capacity to repay the loan conditions is just referring to what what are the basic market conditions that surround the type of business that you're that you're trying to start you know does it make sense to grow bananas in the Northeast if you go to a loan officer and you want to have a banana papaya operation are they going to extend you a loan for that are the conditions right for that maybe not or maybe you have a secret that you that no one knows about yet I think there's a lot of potential for example to grow fish in greenhouses here in the Northeast I'm not sure how crazy I'd sound if I took that idea to a loan officer but but I guess if you could prove that conditions are such that allow for fish culture and greenhouses and that you've really done your research again kind of time back to the character issue then then you'll get good marks for the for the conditions aspect and collateral you you're going to need to you know most loans for from conventional lenders are securitized meaning that you you must put up collateral to guarantee the loan if you have to default on a loan the bank has right to just to liquefy your assets and use that to repay the loan so they can be looking at again what what kind of capital do you have do you already have own real estate you already own assets do you already own livestock and what is saleable what what is the the what are the the liquidity or replacement cost for each of the assets that you own or what are what are the values rather for each of the assets that you own and and could they be repossessed and sold in order for the bank or the lender to recoup the investment that they've made a new in the form of a loan so on to the second part of this webinar take a 30 second break to stretch anyone's like to grab a fresh of fresh air or stretch a little bit now's the time then there was a question earlier I'm just going to get back to that just about when you were talking about the percent reinvested into the farm being part of the calculation for what you can afford wondering if that should just be part of the general farm budget so that your net returns would have already accounted for that that was always back I don't know if you can address that or would that you know investment actually be um something that the landowner would be you know deducting fearless because you're you know investing in improving their land or their infrastructure for that matter I'm sorry Jessie could you rephrase that question sure cuff is a little lengthy but um if you scroll back in the chat box there was a question from Susan Peters about the percent reinvested into the farm operations you were saying that that should be subtracted when people are trying to figure out how much they can afford to pay in the lease and it looks like Susan was just wondering shouldn't that you know reinvestment into the farm already to be part of your farm budget and already included so that your net returns would reflect that I think she was looking questioning why that wasn't already you know incorporated when you're figuring out your net returns from the farm yeah it's it's the same general concept they your your net your net income from your farm operation is going to be revenues minus expenses so that's the only reason why I separated those to the the amount the the money that you're going to take after all expenses are paid and reinvest into your farm operation is not usually considered an expense that's the only reason I I I separated it out it's it's good it's great for farmers to think about income reinvested into their farm operation as an actual expense and have a regular habit of reinvesting in come into their farm business but it's you know it's generally perceived as something that happens after you've figured for your fixed and operating expenses of the farm business so it's right so this is beyond just you know maintenance and doing what you need to do to get your your crop to market this is reinvestment that that's going to improve improve the land or infrastructure so and I guess the question is when the landowners somehow be responsible for that or accounting for that if you're actually improving their property sure if if you are actually improving their property than you then it's definitely not a cost so it would be factored into into that kind of equation a little bit differently if you can somehow value of the improvement that you're making you can definitely deduct that from a cash rental payment that you're negotiating Cassie can I just comment on that I think it depends on the nature of the agreement between the landlord and the tenant if you're making an improvement that the landlord is not willing to accept a shared cost or the residual value of it then it would be your expense and appreciated or whatever and I'm not a business person but in terms of the nature of the relationship between the landlord and the tenant that would be true on the other hand as landlord might be willing to either share in the cost of it for a sign that your cost as Ben was saying it take that into consideration when the lease fee is being calculated so it wouldn't be automatically one way or the other I don't think okay I'm signing off yeah and thanks Cathy and these these formulas that we're using in these methods that can be used to determine a cash rental rate or not are not only set in stone they're really just references for for both landowners and farmers to use two reference points to use in the negotiation process of determining a fair rental rate it really depends on the priorities of both the landowner and the farmer and the needs of both the farmer in the landowner to determine an actual working cash rental rate and we we went over this in the last webinar I'm not sure if we want to take time to go through that again the various ways to determine a cash rental rate I know it's a popular question so if we if anyone wants to speak up if they'd like to go over that again please let me know or else we'll just go through the next set of slides and I'm just scrolling through the chat box here until I haven't just catch up here for another minute dance break good I'm glad someone was dancing and we definitely can get copies of the slides is that right Jessie you want to address that question will you be sending out a follow-up email to everyone here for a link to the recording of this presentation or I'm not sure if you send out the actual PowerPoint slides to participants okay so proper so when you're assessing a particular let's say you have gone through all the preparedness concepts and you're you're ready to really home in and look at particular parcels of land whether you're leasing whether you plan to purchase or whether you plan to get onto the land in any of the other ways that Kathy mentioned in the last webinar so there are basic things to look at you want to be looking at natural features of the land and you can really get into depth into and some science into looking at the natural features that exist it's really a fascinating discipline you want to take a close look at whatever infrastructure exists you want to take a close look at whatever Barnes exists or whatever fencing exists or whatever equipment that might be available to you to assess what needs to go into that what what kind of repairs and maintenance what kind of major overhauls need to go into that on what are the costs you know we talked about this already what are the costs they're going to be associated with owning or or using that piece of equipment or infrastructure the financial considerations we'll talk a little bit more about taxes and how to assess taxes on a particular property where to go to do that and some of the other considerations involved in that and we'll also talk about community and surroundings so as you probably all know there are lots of natural variations in in farm in farmland and land in general it these are just some of them on the list soil is is a huge one and we'll talk about that how you can assess soils will go on a little web torus is that if that works for you guys in a minute here topography microclimates is often underestimated what's what are what are the different hardiness zones this ties into climate you need to know what what hardiness zone you're looking in what what if you if you plan on doing vegetables or fruit trees or other crops what what hardiness zones can they be grown in but within each RT is known there's going to be micro climates are you on a south-facing slope that's going to that's going to warm up first in the spring if you're going fruit trees that might have implications for frost for having your flowers and fruit cheese be susceptible to frost bite because everything thaws out on the south-facing hillside first but then you get one or two freak freezes and then all your flowers are gone you know you really want to look at the topography and how they tie into micro climates water is huge what how you know if water if water does not exist it maybe not might not be a parcel that's worth looking at or at least if it does not exist what are the costs that that you might have to take on in drilling a well or in gaining asset access to water from other sources there's a lot that can be done with spring development and I've gotten this question a lot lately a a piece of online can have a sheep on the hillside and that can be your water source but you do need to assess what what needs to be done to that is it feasible to develop a spring out of that water source can you dig a trench on the on the hillside there and funnel more water into a reservoir Natural Resource Conservation Service is an excellent resource they have plans and schematics for how you can go about doing that and you might be able to get you might be able to consult with an NRCS specialists in your state or your County who might be able to come out to the to the farm that you're looking at and assess how water resources can be conserved how flow of spring can be Springs there can be increased how you might be able to tap into river resources and you know enable yourself to be independent from town or village water and and utilize the water that exists on site vegetation a big question or a common question is is it is it feasible to clear forests you know we have we have really cheap forest land that that's evelio we this this land is being sold for next to nothing and if we buy that land we can just clear the forest and that I am NOT a forester I'm not a logger so the the actual costs associated with clearing forests the actual impacts of clearing forests would depend on what's there to begin with but generally speaking I tell people that it's often not cost-effective to clear forests that exists it's the the money that you're going to save in the purchase price of land is not going to surpass what you're going to spend in clearing for us in the environmental degradation that's going to ensue from you clearing a particular piece of property and then again it depends on your timeline if your look if you're doing if you're talking about a short-term lease it's often yeah I haven't haven't come across any cases where it's really worth it to clear for us to enable cropping but if you do have a longer term horizon it might be feasible to do that little by little more about soils can you guys see my arrow here and maybe I can use this thing here you can see my little wand here you are looking at soil profiles we're looking what exists underneath the surface of the soil you're going to be if you're going out to assess particular property you me walk in the land and oh no slide or one visible hmm is anyone that that can see my wand here can anyone else see my wand hey Ben to use that you actually need to click it'll put a there you go a dot and that's going to move over time you click to a new spot okay well that's the surface of the soil we're looking at and this is the the the depth of the soil this is about we're looking at about two feet underneath the surface right here at that dot maybe about three feet right underneath there and obviously if you're standing right here you might not be able to to understand what exists right here I do suggest that if you're if you're seriously considering owning or leasing a piece of property that you obtain permission from the owner before you before you start probing into soil but you do take the time and energy to probe down into the soil whether that be digging a small ditch with this shovel whether that be using some of the tools they're shown here this is a small two foot soil probe that can be used for taking tiny little corium about the size of your your thumb you can get small soil cores if you if you probe down about a foot or two this is a bucket auger and this can be used for probing down about 5 or 6 feet depending on the the length of the handle here are and a lot of times University land-grant universities have these NRCS soil scientists have these they might be able to come out to your site it costs about one hundred fifty dollars two to three hundred dollars this this bucket augers is a lot more expensive than this this piece of equipment here is about thirty dollars that can be used and of course a garden shovel works but you want to obtain permission to be able to look at the soils that you might be dealing with this soil here is going to have tremendously different implications using the soil than this would this this year is is known as into Saul it's a very young soil it's extremely nutrient deficient it's extremely sandy it might be great for some uses if you can amend enough nutrients but because it is well drained this soil on the other hand is is a I think it's a picture from the Midwest the breadbasket region where it's a tremendously vertel soil this is probably what you're going to be seeing more in the northeast of New England areas it's a little bit younger of a soil it's going to be a probably a lot more sandy than you then you'd find out in the Midwest but oftentimes you do find this soil on the right side is is a visit you can see the cracks down the middle here is due to the high clay content and you know this is gonna be a tremendous the Clay's of tremendously heavy soil that's going to be very hard to work especially in the spring so it really pays to dig down from the surface get to feel the soils that you'd be working with get to know them a little better and don't let your soils be a secret um so let's talk a little bit more about assessing soils you can use the online web soil survey as a tool for assessing site soils and we'll try to launch a little web tour here and see if this works bear with me for a second here okay so please indicate with the smiley faces as you can see this page the usda nrcs you see it Jessica so so great you guys can see this this is a tremendously useful tool that's offered by united states department of agriculture and natural resource conservation service and what the Natural Resource Conservation Service has done all over the nation is that they've surveyed soils I'm sorry that's some of you can't see this hopefully we can get that resolved sweet so they've surveyed soils all over the nation they did this back in the 60s when there's a big effort isn't as a civilian conservation corps or some big federal program that enabled soil scientists to go out all over the nation and catalog soils and since then the the surveys have gotten a more detailed and and they become digitized which is a great advantage for us online users you can go into into the web soil survey the click on this screen button here um and try this so I I've tried this before of a webinar it's tough to to go through this but you can click on the state where your way you're in you can use the navigation tools over on the left to enter your address and what you do first is you enter your address your area of interest which means you're basically I'm sorry I can't display this over the webinar but you're basically the once you type in an address or location will give you an aerial map and you can draw a rectangle using this first screen here you can draw a rectangle or a shape over the area where you're looking to assess as the property you're interested in and then within that rectangle it will divide up the different soil types and you can then investigate the soil types that exist there you can click on the tabs here you can click on the soil map and again i'm sorry i can't do that but you can you can click on the soil data explorer to learn a lot more about the potential for the particular soils that are on site there if you know the series name let me try to launch another web tour here for the sake of time I'm not going to get into the nitty-gritty of soil series but basically if you could every soil series has an every soil type down to the most detailed classification has a series name associated with it you know and their conventional names based on geography it might be the state bird or something like that is the name of the soil it might be the town name where the soils predominantly exist but once you have that soil series name you can enter it you can do and you go to the nrcs Natural Resource Conservation Service website and you you can do a search there for for for soils series description and you can enter in the soil series name and get a full description of the soil and how it acts what kind of drainage it has what kind of crops grow there in the native habitat and all kinds of other other factors you know how deep the soil is to bedrock into water table what kind of soil is it is a sandy soil is a clay soils are predominated by silt you can really learn a ton from knowing what soil series exists in the particular parcels that you're interested and again you can do some detailed probing and again have permission before you do this and try to cover up the holes that you've dug for building purposes if you are looking to lease or own land and you and you know that you might need buildings most states have permitting requirements for erecting buildings for for making the for building dwellings especially and the permits usually relate to what kind of septic systems what kind of wastewater disposal systems are going to need to be installed on-site according to the regulations that each state has so in Vermont here it's the Department of Environmental Conservation wastewater management division that handles those permanent regulations and there's you know it's in all of these states it's these are laws that have been passed so this is public information you can have dig into the law that was passed related to the requirements that are needed to install a septic system and you can say okay if I want to put a one bedroom house I'm going to need to build this size septic system that's all that's all been written into law at one time or another and then the states have various permitting processes to in order to for the state to give the go-ahead for you to build or not but it really all depends on soils so the the particular soils that exists on site are going to determine the potential for building potential for for installing a septic system or a potable water supply system so oftentimes if you're looking to purchase if you're set to purchase land the before you actually sign a contractor you'll sign the purchase and sales agreement which is a contract that says you're going to purchase the property based on the contingency that the site passes a percolation test based on the soils will exist there so that's you know that's often a condition that will exist within your purchase contract and it's generally not wise to to purchase a property if you don't know that it's going to percolate that it's going to pass these certain tests that are going to allow you for building some cases you might not care at all you might not have you might not really care about building or the potential do so in that case this does not apply there are other ways to assess various natural features or properties in Vermont we have a service that's it's an online service that's run by the agency of natural resources I'm not sure if other states have this kind of service but you you're able to get online and search through all of these if you have a particular property in mind you're you're able to build through all of these variables and learn more about your particular property again there be an aerial map associated with it with your search and you can have different layers and determine whether or not storm water permits are needed if the areas have been demarcated as wildlife habitat or not if there's sensitive wetlands there if there's legal permits that have been issued according to environmental uses all kinds of things can be learned about properties by using that service again you want to assess the quality of infrastructure that you're going to be dealing with well whether how much are you going to be how much do you estimate putting into repairing and maintaining all the equipment that you're about to acquire or make use of or all the buildings that you're about to inhabit or use as storage sheds what what are you going to have to do what's what are you going to have to build their what kind of roof are you going to have to repair and you know what's what are the repairs and manage and how can they be distinguished from the major overhauls and upgrades that need to happen this is important especially if you're developing a lease agreement to agree with with the landowner what is considered a major overhaul versus a routine maintenance of most commonly the farmer tenant is expected to handle route between and cover the cost of routine maintenance and repairs whereas if it's a major overhaul that's going to considerably alter the value of an asset if it's a major repair you're replacing an engine and a tractor or something that's going to really increase the value of that tractor by three thousand dollars or it's it's it's obviously a major overhaul the landowners usually are expected to cover that cost unless you have a specific agreement otherwise so a lot of times it's obvious but the bottom line is that a lot of times it's not and it's really worthwhile to have a conversation about what is maintenance what what needs to be repaired and what needs to be overhauled in a major way and again there there are some permitting issues involved in major construction if you are building a road for instance to access a particular property you might need to look into the town permitting regulations there might be state permits involved in disturbing a certain amount of soil in Vermont for example if you disturb more than one acre of soil on with the development you need a special permit you need an act 250 you need to go through and an act 250 permit with sediment and erosion control plans in place so back to the tax issue and this might sound repetitive but again it's extremely important to assess what are the taxes you be paying on a particular parcel and this speaks to if you're purchasing a little bit more than if you are leasing again going back a few slides you get even get a tax deduction if you're leasing land if you're if you own land you're going to be paying a lot of Texas and again a vermont-based example there is a special program here that allows farmers in certain cases to get a significant tax benefit if they are actively farming here in Vermont it's called the Vermont use value appraisal program and you can get information about that at the Vermont State Department of taxes as you can get information at the various State Department of taxes wherever you're from or wherever you're you're looking at properties and at the department of taxes you'll find eligibility requirements for getting into these tax benefit programs for example in Vermont if you're going to enroll agricultural land that land has to be producing two thousand dollars worth of income for with regard sorry gross revenue for the farmer per year once once the farmer on that land is making more than two thousand dollars a year from agricultural products the land can be enrolled in the tax benefit program that means the town is not going to be able to assess that land at fair market value for taxes here land is often test it about ten to twenty percent a fair market value for tax purposes that's you know it's a significant savings to get into these tax benefit programs for forest land another example here in Vermont you need more than 25 acres of continued contiguous forest land in order for you to enroll that land in the tax benefit program farm buildings can be a step assessed at zero percent tax value it again it all depends on the particular program where you reside or where you're looking and there is potential for housing for farm employees to be taxed at zero percent base in other words housing for our employees is not text if it's enrolled in the tax benefit program and this this is for example here and promote this is special to are specific to where there's a and employee relationship this would not apply for a tenant for a farmer who's renting a house on a piece of farmland if you're renting a house that and you're not an employee of a farm you know that that house is going to still be taxed at normal fair market value but again that's a Vermont specific example I don't know if caffeine olds any more about the other states programs or if there any if there's any major differences to what I just mentioned Kathy are you available ok I'll come back to that let's see the town office is a wealth of information if you're talking about taxes you can get at at the town you can get the exact map and the exact acreage that the town's going off of for you know what what what the acreage is of the particular parcel that they're assessing it's not necessarily the actual acreage that exists on a particular parcel for actual acreage you're going to need to have a professional soil or a professional survey done of the land but oftentimes the towns will have estimates of acres that are very very close to those at those surveyed measurements you know oftentimes there was a survey that was done 50 years ago or a hundred years ago so the the amount of acreage at the town is taxing might be plus or minus but you can get all that information at the town office you can get aerial maps of the properties that you're looking at that often helps if you're walking properties to understand what kind of patches of pasture exists here and what kind of patches of forest exist there and where are the exact of the actual borders you can get current title information you know this is important if you you know you need to know that the person you're dealing with actually owns the land it's not you're not dealing with the uncle or something and someone comes home from Florida and all of a sudden you're leasing their land and they don't know about it at the town office you can ascertain that the person who you're dealing with actually has title to the land and this is something that attorneys will access if they're doing a title search on to make sure there aren't any other encumbrances on the land they'll go through all the town records and really look closely at at this item zoning regulations you can get that information at the town in a lot of states there is a right to farm law where agriculture is not zoned against in other words they're at least in Vermont so I'm sorry in Vermont there there isn't any zoning regulations that would preclude anyone from farming in any particular location everyone has a right to farm assuming that you're not posing a hazard to public health but there are nuisance laws that can go into effect that that farmer should should be aware of in other words even though there's no regulation to to prohibit anyone from farming if the farmer comes in two moves into an area and is new there and starts running an operation that it is obviously detracting from other bordering properties owners ability to enjoy the use of their land then the farmer can fall victim to a nuisance lawsuit so just address this question here I've heard many tales of issues with easements and grandfather roads crossing farmland and how to address this area this is this is another crucial bit of information that can be accessed at the town office you definitely need to know if there's any easements whatsoever on a particular property and you can't you know you can't really if there is an easement on a particular property that's a legal right for another on't for another person to you know access to you if there if it's an easement for a road there that person is gonna have legal ability to use that road no matter what if it's a power company they're going to have the legal right to own the land that the power lines go through even if even though they're running through your land so I guess the only way to address this area is to have knowledge of the particular terms that are associated with that easement to know exactly how many feet within either side of the power pole for example are covered within that easement and to understand who owns the easement and what attitude they're going to have about you acquiring the rest of the property that surrounds that that area that's applicable to the easement so did that answer your question Nate comparable sales data this is a way to determine the fair market value of a particular property this kind of information I've been told is available at the town offices I'm not I haven't ever gone to the towns and asked them to see records of recent sales I'm not sure how far back they keep records this might be different from town to town but essentially real estate agents when they go to appraise a particular property this is the kind of they're going to the town records or the state records and they're they're accessing this kind of data to to determine a fair market value for a particular property they're basing that fair market value on the sales the sale prices of comparable properties in the area and I've been told that this is something you can do on your own although I'm not sure again it would probably depend on from town to town what kind of data is available and how it's available but this is essentially something that a real estate agent would do which is another not so bad idea if you are looking to purchase a piece of property to get a real estate agent of yours on board to represent you so they can they're going to be the experts at determining the fair price to pay for a particular property it's hard to go in alone I know the tendency is to be reluctant to pay three percent in a commission just to have a real estate agent help you through some listings that you could access on your own but sometimes it pays especially if the real estate agent can really confirm the the fair price that could that can be paid for particular property that may might be a lot less than you would ordinarily pay if you were trying to determine that fair market value on your own so are there any other questions before I move on are there any that I have not addressed yeah I think we're going to be wrapping up in about 10 minutes here 830 is our cutoff time I appreciate everyone bearing with us up to now I hope that you're getting something out of this ah this is a great thing to not be shy about if you're trying to assess the particular property it's a don't be shy to talk with neighbors and and and people who have been who know the land would prove and hunting on a particular property for for ages throughout generations we really know the ins and outs on how a property acts over time you know I throughout the seasons all the people who live right around your neighbors there or people with that kind of local knowledge exist and you know it's really a great thing to be able to talk with him if they're willing so just to jump back here a little bit can tax records Dave to be used to assess potential value of a property they could if you know the tax rate for a particular town at least the town Lister's are going to have the value of a property that they have assessed there that you know I might it's probably easier in other words to go directly to the town lister and figure out what is the value of the land that they're basing the tax on because they have assessed the property and they have assessed the fair market value of the property at some time or another it might have been seven years ago it might have been just last year that's something you need to ask so in other words the value that the real estate sisters at the town level and work for the town office of have appraised might not be the actual fair market value of the land the land owner might be able to get a lot more for that right now based on the market conditions or orb or it might be even let you know less value depending on the situation but at least you can use that that basic list value that the the appraisers at the town level that have used and if you're savvy you can use the tax form those two to arrive at that figure up as well there are resources for help in filing for current you status in Vermont at least it's the county foresters who are that resource the county foresters job is to administer and check up on all of the current use management plans so when you when someone doesn't roll into a tax benefit program they usually submit a management plan that states how they're going to manage the forest for productivity and how are they you know what they're doing to AG land and so on and here in Vermont it's the county foresters that that have files on all the properties and manage that information from time to time they'll actually visit properties are checked up on whether management plans are being enforced so the county foresters can really walk you through what it takes to enroll in current use they might be able to help you figuring out what figure out whether or not you're eligible and then that the county foresters will refer you to consulting foresters and these are consulting land use planners they're you know they're they're not always just foresters but they have experience in helping people enroll in the current use plans the Vermont woodlands Association has certified Forester consultants you know most towns have someone or most areas have someone that's experienced in consulting with private landowners on whether or not they're eligible for current use I'm assuming the same case in other states yeah the main goal of these tax benefit programs is to keep the land open and productive so there is if it's not private consulting foresters it's going to be some other agricultural service provider organization that can assist you in support you as a landowner whose will it is to keep the land open and productive you know that might be a state agency of Agriculture it might be a cooperative extension service you know I can definitely help anyone that's something that I do I I know the the basic ins and outs of the Vermont current use burger and I consult with with farmers and landowners I'd be happy to talk with anyone hear about that at any time so again back to community don't don't be afraid to partner are sorry don't be afraid to talk with current tenants but at the same time be sensitive that they are not always obligated to share information with you you have to be sensitive to the fact that if you're looking to lease land if there's a current tenant there already that tenant might not know that the landowner wants to lease land to you you know and maybe not least as much land to the current tenant as as before you have to be sensitive to that fact when you approach current tenants and and you know it's just approach the matter was some respect and humility um you know and I think it's always good to ask the landowner or the tenants if it would be okay to to access records or talk with them from time to time so we're running out of time here I'll just sift through this quickly here's another resource that's available at UVM extensions new farmer project this is going through various considerations this is a checklist that's similar to the one that we brought up earlier that's in holding ground it goes through all detailed considerations and assessing properties here are some additional resources these are organizations you can go to if you have any other questions about any of the topics that were covered in either of these two webinars um this is specific to Vermont intervale center here is in chittenden county then for good has an associate Mike ghia who works at a wyndham county in vermont he's all over the state here but land for good is generally a new england-based organization Cathy you maybe you can speak to a little bit more about what you guys offer because I have you guys also on this last slide here again land for good is a tremendous resource they're based in the New England states no Cathy if you work throughout New York as well but northeast beginning farmers project is out of Cornell University Extension they're a great resource to go to to learn more about land access and tenure issues international farm transition Network has lists as organizations that do listing and linking programs all over the nation and then again we're available here at UVM extension and there's there's some other educational resources available in the land access tool shed at this URL here at UVM extensions new farmer project website official and thank you yeah land for good does have a land here program which does focus on helping seekers we have offer individual consulting lease drafting we helped non-farming landowners recruits beginning farmers so for I mean farm speakers so that helps on the other end we do have a couple of online tools lease templates we think tutorial a full course on land acquisition will be online and we serve to six New England states we do a teeny bit of work in New York but we're really focusing on building our partnerships in in New England Thanks well thanks Cathy wood that will journeyer Jesse had some more yeah I just wanted to say thank you so much Ben and Kathy for joining us this evening and for all of you who participated I do want to ask you and before you go on to other things if you can take a minute and fill out this survey I'm going to send you the link right now we do really appreciate feedback on these webinars and also other things that you might be interested in seeing webinars on and that kind of thing so you can follow that link it's just super quick survey and we'd love your input so thanks everyone thanks Cathy and Ben and we will be sending you some follow-up information if you put your email in the chat box if you haven't done that already go ahead and put your email in there we'll send you a link to the recording of this presentation also where the PDF of the presentation is and that kind of thing all right folks thanks so much you",
