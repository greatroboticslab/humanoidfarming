2
00:00:07,240 --> 00:00:11,900
the dealing with the dry forums brings

3
00:00:09,710 --> 00:00:14,000
together keynote speakers one of whom is

4
00:00:11,900 --> 00:00:17,000
a grain producer as well as a leading

5
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:20,000
local agronomist drew pendous II so my

6
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:22,640
main talk today was on staff and and

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,109
some of the impacts during a drought so

8
00:00:22,640 --> 00:00:25,730
it's not only the business owners and

9
00:00:24,109 --> 00:00:28,160
the farmers doing it tough during the

10
00:00:25,730 --> 00:00:30,320
drought the the key thing that people

11
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,640
forget about is what your staff are

12
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:33,770
feeling as well because they're going

13
00:00:31,640 --> 00:00:34,970
through similar issues you know they're

14
00:00:33,770 --> 00:00:37,310
worried about their jobs and their

15
00:00:34,970 --> 00:00:38,930
security same as the farmers are they're

16
00:00:37,310 --> 00:00:41,210
worried about income and how they're

17
00:00:38,930 --> 00:00:43,190
going to get through this dry period so

18
00:00:41,210 --> 00:00:45,940
some of the big issues we we run into

19
00:00:43,190 --> 00:00:48,770
with staff is keeping their enthusiasm

20
00:00:45,940 --> 00:00:50,149
to the point where we you probably need

21
00:00:48,770 --> 00:00:52,550
to involve your staff and some of the

22
00:00:50,149 --> 00:00:54,710
decision making during the drive period

23
00:00:52,550 --> 00:00:57,500
more than you have before just to keep

24
00:00:54,710 --> 00:00:59,000
them abreast of what's going on some of

25
00:00:57,500 --> 00:01:00,500
the things that a lot of people are

26
00:00:59,000 --> 00:01:03,410
doing is there's a lot of infrastructure

27
00:01:00,500 --> 00:01:07,520
then looked at with staffs a lot more

28
00:01:03,410 --> 00:01:08,930
fencing a lot more soil works erosion

29
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:11,299
control stuff like that that they

30
00:01:08,930 --> 00:01:13,790
normally don't put a lot of emphasis on

31
00:01:11,299 --> 00:01:15,860
but to keep their staff on they're doing

32
00:01:13,790 --> 00:01:17,330
those sort of things still a big cost to

33
00:01:15,860 --> 00:01:19,220
the business but coming out of the

34
00:01:17,330 --> 00:01:20,960
drought should make their decisions a

35
00:01:19,220 --> 00:01:22,180
lot better if going forward having

36
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,250
making sure they've got good water

37
00:01:22,180 --> 00:01:27,680
structures when spraying does start

38
00:01:25,250 --> 00:01:29,780
again when it does rain they've got a

39
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,909
really good system in place so there's a

40
00:01:29,780 --> 00:01:34,040
lot of funding for courses at the moment

41
00:01:31,909 --> 00:01:35,450
which is free through rural assistance

42
00:01:34,040 --> 00:01:37,610
and stuff like that so that's a really

43
00:01:35,450 --> 00:01:39,320
good thing we're getting into but other

44
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:41,810
regions are doing similar things there's

45
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:44,119
been a few study to us some people went

46
00:01:41,810 --> 00:01:46,070
over to India and a lot of gone to

47
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,810
America just doing study tours and going

48
00:01:46,070 --> 00:01:49,909
on those sort of things one of the big

49
00:01:47,810 --> 00:01:52,520
things we've done is making sure people

50
00:01:49,909 --> 00:01:54,290
to koala days now out of their time take

51
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:55,640
the families away spend time with the

52
00:01:54,290 --> 00:01:58,369
kids and all that sorting because we can

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:02:00,350
do it now we're not under a huge work

54
00:01:58,369 --> 00:02:01,850
pressure and the hours of time and doing

55
00:02:00,350 --> 00:02:04,460
those sort of things and I think that's

56
00:02:01,850 --> 00:02:06,890
really key for mental health is to get

57
00:02:04,460 --> 00:02:08,630
yeah your family won't they do something

58
00:02:06,890 --> 00:02:11,250
different for a while

59
00:02:08,630 --> 00:02:14,910
if you put stuff off during this hard

60
00:02:11,250 --> 00:02:16,410
time what happens when it does break you

61
00:02:14,910 --> 00:02:17,790
know they're going to be hard to find

62
00:02:16,410 --> 00:02:19,950
stuff there's a lot of people moving to

63
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:22,650
this to the cities during this dry time

64
00:02:19,950 --> 00:02:25,050
if they've been put off and I can't see

65
00:02:22,650 --> 00:02:27,450
those people coming back so that's a big

66
00:02:25,050 --> 00:02:30,810
consideration on every decision you make

67
00:02:27,450 --> 00:02:32,370
and if you take the short-term view it

68
00:02:30,810 --> 00:02:34,830
may come back and cause a lot of

69
00:02:32,370 --> 00:02:37,170
problems going for but every farm is

70
00:02:34,830 --> 00:02:39,810
different and everyone's got a different

71
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:41,490
situation and some farms there isn't

72
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,220
that there's no extra work a lot of

73
00:02:41,490 --> 00:02:46,020
people are finding other jobs for their

74
00:02:44,220 --> 00:02:48,090
staff with the equipment they got like

75
00:02:46,020 --> 00:02:49,290
excavators and dozers and trucks and

76
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:51,390
stuff like that and they're finding

77
00:02:49,290 --> 00:02:53,460
other jobs contracting work to do with

78
00:02:51,390 --> 00:02:55,200
their staff or they're finding an

79
00:02:53,460 --> 00:02:57,240
alternative jobs for periods of time

80
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,220
during this dry period so when it does

81
00:02:57,240 --> 00:03:01,110
break they're still able to come back on

82
00:02:59,220 --> 00:03:05,280
farm we can still do our management

83
00:03:01,110 --> 00:03:08,610
decisions have good time one of the

84
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:10,650
other key things to remember is that you

85
00:03:08,610 --> 00:03:12,420
know it's not on staff it's not just

86
00:03:10,650 --> 00:03:14,100
yourself and the people working on the

87
00:03:12,420 --> 00:03:16,170
farm but it's also the wives within the

88
00:03:14,100 --> 00:03:19,860
business because they take a lot of

89
00:03:16,170 --> 00:03:22,440
burden in this and quite often that oh I

90
00:03:19,860 --> 00:03:24,720
see they get neglected in these period

91
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,810
of times or the husband brings home all

92
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:29,520
their troubles and no one gives those

93
00:03:27,810 --> 00:03:31,110
considerations to the wives because

94
00:03:29,520 --> 00:03:32,850
they're taking that burden just as much

95
00:03:31,110 --> 00:03:34,709
as everyone else and to the point where

96
00:03:32,850 --> 00:03:37,260
some of the kids are going back to

97
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:39,630
school and they're worried that their

98
00:03:37,260 --> 00:03:41,070
father and mother are struggling and

99
00:03:39,630 --> 00:03:43,370
they're going home and they're taking

100
00:03:41,070 --> 00:03:45,270
that back to their schooling

101
00:03:43,370 --> 00:03:47,910
so this is the worst drought we've

102
00:03:45,270 --> 00:03:51,180
actually seen in history in this region

103
00:03:47,910 --> 00:03:53,160
but yeah just be prepared it's probably

104
00:03:51,180 --> 00:03:54,390
the key to getting through this and we

105
00:03:53,160 --> 00:03:56,910
will we will get through it because

106
00:03:54,390 --> 00:04:01,440
we're resilient and with our it's this

107
00:03:56,910 --> 00:04:03,240
it's the way we are go to the
