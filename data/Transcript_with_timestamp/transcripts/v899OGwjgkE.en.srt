1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,339
good morning modern stutters it's a

2
00:00:02,610 --> 00:00:08,340
balmy 19 degrees out this morning

3
00:00:05,339 --> 00:00:12,059
gotta love winter speaking of winter we

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:15,480
need to prep our chicken coop for winter

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:17,730
let's get that finished this morning I'm

6
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:40,140
gonna go over to one of the tents and

7
00:00:17,730 --> 00:00:42,780
pick out the chicken wire believe and

8
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:57,510
hope I have a roll of chicken wire in

9
00:00:42,780 --> 00:01:02,760
here yes I do I'm not super worried

10
00:00:57,510 --> 00:01:04,049
about keeping critters out of this part

11
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:05,610
of the chicken run this will be the

12
00:01:04,049 --> 00:01:07,979
chicken run except they'll be in here

13
00:01:05,610 --> 00:01:09,570
during the day so I'm not too concerned

14
00:01:07,979 --> 00:01:11,700
about predators during the day accreta

15
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:14,040
me locked up at night in New York City

16
00:01:11,700 --> 00:01:16,920
that's predator proof so what I want to

17
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:20,450
do today is make it so the chickens stay

18
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:20,450
in and they can't get out

19
00:02:11,890 --> 00:02:16,190
fourme up here in northern New Hampshire

20
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:19,069
the winter chicken coop is more about

21
00:02:16,190 --> 00:02:20,780
function how do we get the coop to

22
00:02:19,069 --> 00:02:23,209
function well and do what we needed to

23
00:02:20,780 --> 00:02:25,220
do throughout the winter where we don't

24
00:02:23,209 --> 00:02:27,290
have to spend a lot of the money run

25
00:02:25,220 --> 00:02:29,510
electricity for heat lives and further

26
00:02:27,290 --> 00:02:32,569
water is how do we get the chickens to

27
00:02:29,510 --> 00:02:34,970
thrive in the normal conditions without

28
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:37,870
having to baby them we don't want to

29
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:37,870
have to do that here

30
00:02:46,260 --> 00:02:49,449
[Applause]

31
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,340
I found the tarps that cover lumber

32
00:04:07,800 --> 00:04:13,590
piles at the lumber yard where they last

33
00:04:11,340 --> 00:04:15,870
a while so they have a white site and a

34
00:04:13,590 --> 00:04:18,690
black side so depending on what purpose

35
00:04:15,870 --> 00:04:21,810
you use it for you might want to have

36
00:04:18,690 --> 00:04:23,190
different sides out and so for our one

37
00:04:21,810 --> 00:04:24,450
of our shooting tractors that the

38
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:27,840
chickens are in the summertime we have

39
00:04:24,450 --> 00:04:29,610
the white reflect the Sun this being a

40
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,410
winter chicken coop I'm going to put the

41
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:34,820
black out so it attracts the Sun it

42
00:04:31,410 --> 00:04:34,820
should help heat up the green

43
00:04:55,690 --> 00:05:00,319
[Applause]

44
00:04:56,190 --> 00:05:00,319
[Music]

45
00:05:02,470 --> 00:05:27,640
oh that's my mistake I thought this tarp

46
00:05:25,480 --> 00:05:31,660
was 16 feet long

47
00:05:27,640 --> 00:05:33,990
only a 12-footer man oh well I'll use it

48
00:05:31,660 --> 00:05:33,990
for now

49
00:05:42,210 --> 00:05:45,399
[Applause]

50
00:05:47,180 --> 00:05:50,430
[Music]

51
00:06:09,300 --> 00:06:14,170
well that's definitely a disappointment

52
00:06:11,920 --> 00:06:16,690
I thought all the tops I had were 16

53
00:06:14,170 --> 00:06:19,360
feet long I'm going to go buy two new

54
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:22,330
ones now one for the chicken coop and

55
00:06:19,360 --> 00:06:24,970
one for the pigs not doing that today we

56
00:06:22,330 --> 00:06:27,250
don't have time for that but let's let

57
00:06:24,970 --> 00:06:31,180
the chickens out feed them let's go give

58
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:34,270
the pig some more hay it's gonna be fun

59
00:06:31,180 --> 00:06:37,180
I bet who else is gonna like this hot

60
00:06:34,270 --> 00:06:38,920
water outdoors Beckett it's going to be

61
00:06:37,180 --> 00:06:43,410
all the animals this winter they'll be

62
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,410
able to have hot water to drink

63
00:06:52,780 --> 00:06:55,890
[Applause]

64
00:07:16,729 --> 00:07:29,990
I like putting the grain right down

65
00:07:27,949 --> 00:07:32,569
topper where I want the animals to

66
00:07:29,990 --> 00:07:35,330
scratch check through and eat we want to

67
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,909
start turning all this hay for us so

68
00:07:35,330 --> 00:07:39,229
it's why we're feeding them right here

69
00:07:36,909 --> 00:07:41,499
we want to encourage that kind of

70
00:07:39,229 --> 00:07:44,960
behavior in our animals

71
00:07:41,499 --> 00:07:47,930
I'm hoping this keeps them in if it does

72
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:50,330
we can bring the Icelandic chickens in

73
00:07:47,930 --> 00:07:52,430
over to the winter chicken coop I bet

74
00:07:50,330 --> 00:07:54,589
they'll love being able to be the bigger

75
00:07:52,430 --> 00:08:26,599
flock and stay warmer when it gets

76
00:07:54,589 --> 00:08:27,110
