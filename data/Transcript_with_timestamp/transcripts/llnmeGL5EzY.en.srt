hi I'm Doug Barrett from the ellenwood

2
00:00:01,829 --> 00:00:07,340
ldi store and i'm here to talk today on

3
00:00:04,529 --> 00:00:11,210
the proper ballasting of the tractor and

4
00:00:07,340 --> 00:00:14,400
the proper air inflation of the tires

5
00:00:11,210 --> 00:00:18,060
what we have we're wanting to maintain a

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:20,640
two to four percent slip when setting up

7
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:22,140
our tractor for the proper demo so to do

8
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:24,269
that we've got to go in and we've got to

9
00:00:22,140 --> 00:00:27,420
get our air pressure set properly from

10
00:00:24,269 --> 00:00:30,420
tire to tire and also on the back the

11
00:00:27,420 --> 00:00:33,510
proper inflation will basically put

12
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:36,390
three bars on the ground solid on the

13
00:00:33,510 --> 00:00:38,610
ground that will be what you look

14
00:00:36,390 --> 00:00:40,230
forward and you can adjust from that by

15
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:42,989
whatever piece of equipment that you've

16
00:00:40,230 --> 00:00:44,820
got on the back of the attractor the

17
00:00:42,989 --> 00:00:46,680
other thing will have will be proper

18
00:00:44,820 --> 00:00:49,079
ballasting which is going to be our

19
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,289
weight issues we're going to have weight

20
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,879
on the inside of our duels and we can

21
00:00:52,289 --> 00:00:55,770
set different weights for that plus

22
00:00:53,879 --> 00:00:58,820
we'll have weights on the front of the

23
00:00:55,770 --> 00:01:02,509
tractor and we can do that

24
00:00:58,820 --> 00:01:02,509
