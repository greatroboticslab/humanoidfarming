  "text": "all right guys what is going on today we are talking quick hitches for your tractor we're gonna try to keep it brief free today just explain what these quick hitches are how they can help you why they're so popular we're gonna try to hit a lot of highlights about quick hitches and just give you some differences in some similarities to help you make a better decision I'm going to attempt to answer why you may want a quick hitch for your tractor but let's be real this is just what I had an inventory here okay so there's four different manufacturers right here these are four different quick hitches that all essentially do the same thing for you this is not a complete representation of what's on the market right now it's just what I had in inventory at the time I always want to provide objective information and that can be challenging being a dealer for just some of these quick hitches here because obviously I'll make money if I sell you the ones that I represent right however part of my business model is to sell things that are a good value so whatever dollar amount that you're spending you're getting a very good value for that dollar amount otherwise it just doesn't make sense to me why would you want to buy it I say all of that to say I try to be objective some of this is subjective I just can't help it but I want to give you an honest assessment and I'll just give you my opinion on why I sell these certain quick itches and I don't the others some of them I just don't have the opportunity to all I want to do is answer some of those questions and let you make that decision we're gonna get started here in just a second but really quick if you haven't done so yet hit that subscribe button below also if you just google good works tractors you'll find my facebook page head there if you're on facebook click like I put a lot of cool stuff on there as well i'm also on instagram so follow me on there and last but not least follow good works tractors calm i'd love to put together a tractor package for you show you an attachment answer any question you might have good works tractors calm all right here we go okay so i want to start off by saying there's one thing i'm not gonna talk about and that is how to hook up a quick hitch to your tractor or hook up a quick hitch to your attachment i have done some other what i think are pretty good videos about that i'm gonna post links above here so at some point this video here if you want to watch how to use a quick hitch or how to hook it up to your tractor click on one of those links and you can check that out as well after you're done watching this video it's an easy process to do but it's kind of a process in and of itself and i don't want to take time away from just kind of going over what these are in general here and answering some specific questions about them okay first up let's go over the similarities here now you're gonna see all these look extremely similar and they should and there's a reason for that there's an a sae specification that controls the dimensional spacing of these quick hitches and so there's going to be tolerances within there that they have to conform to so every quick hitch you see here in every quick hitch on the market should conform to that a sae specification if you don't see where it says that and occasionally I might not put that in my description as well just ask a question to the manufacturer or to me or to your dealer and they can confirm that it was built in that a sae specification oftentimes you're going to hear about compatibility issues between quick hitches and attachments that don't match together they don't meet they don't fit together like they're supposed to and on a rare occasion even I will have that happen with either an attachment or a quick hitch so within this specification it's a pretty tight parameter that these quick hitches and the attachments all have to fit within and so you have a spacing measurement that's going to be between these lower links down here and then you also have a spacing measurement that's going to go from the lower links to the upper link so you will see that all these quick hitches are gonna have bolt holes that are on the top link okay to allow you to adjust it up and down that's gonna aid in compatibility and flexibility with the attachments so I said on occasion I do have something that doesn't match up well there it's a quick hitch or the attachment or a combination of both the match just isn't there and so again with these tolerances being so tight and so narrow with everything having to fit and match up occasionally you are gonna have an attachment that doesn't quite just fit the bill you know and so you can accomplish that by a couple of ways either shave off a little bit of material sometimes even just a little bit of paint or you can simply send it back get a new one and hopefully that cures the problem however I'm telling you 99 out of 100 probably more like 999 out of a thousand times I don't have an issue with this okay I brought the camera down low here that way you can see what I want to talk about next and that is gonna be the cross bracing or the support between the top and the side as you can see pretty chunky and beefy on some of these okay these black ones here you can see in the corners there a lot of chunky bracing the imesh doesn't actually have that kind of same a little bit of racing but not the same amount this is a land pride up here okay and you can see there's some cross bracing there just a thin plate of steel on the far side alright and so all of these quick hitches will be rated for at least up to 40 horsepower if not higher I've used them on many four series tractors without issue so I think you know as with a lot of farm equipment they are also term over built before what they're gonna be on and I don't really think you're gonna have much of an issue unless you are really just pushing the limits of your tractor so the difference there in the cross bracing just shows you one of the ways that these quick itches can be constructed differently while remaining within the same dimensional tolerances of that ASAE specification one of the other big ways that they can vary is by weight and that's what we're gonna do next we're gonna go ahead and weigh each one of these quick hitches and we'll show you how much they weigh you know what before we weigh these we're gonna go ahead and give you a little background information on these quick hitches here so number one these are all category one three-point quick hitches okay so they're not going to be category two no limited cat1 so like the smaller land prides are not included in here this is all apples to apples to apples to apples as best as possible okay so now let me tell you about each one of these quick itches here in particular mountain on my 1025 here is gonna be a work saver quick hitch this is manufactured in the USA and Litchfield Illinois okay so now for the sales pitch so there's a few reasons why I like these work favorite quick hitches and why I choose to sell them I can sell a lot of different manufacturers I really love selling these work saver quick hitches so reason one they're gonna include a set of these bushings these bushings are required they're gonna go on the bottom pins of any attachment that you put on your three-point hitch okay so you really want to have a set of these bushings for every attachment that you're gonna hook up to your three-point hitch yes some guys will take these off and put them on to the next attachment however that really defeats the purpose of having a quick hitch in the first place which is efficiency so the work saver is gonna include linchpins here while the I match for sure includes cotter pins these are just a nice convenience to have if you're attaching and detaching your quick hitch a lot of folks just leave their quick hitch on and never comes off but if you need to attach it to a non package compatible attachment you want to take the quick hitch off or maybe have a backhoe you want to put on something along those lines it's nice to have a really easy pin to work with here versus the kind that once you kind of deform it it's a real pain to kind of work with and get it back together to go through the hole and you got to use the wires you know what I mean so it's just a nice convenience it's not the end of the world they'll both get the job done but just a nice touch by work saver work saber includes what's called a floating top link or floating top link adapter something along those lines you'll hear it called multiple things and so this opens up the versatility so if you do have some non quickhitch compatible attachments you can put this in place of the top hook that's on the quick Ajit's elf and get a lot of flexibility there up and down that kind of thing so I'll show you what I mean so the last reason I really like these work saver quick hitches is that they include this extra bracket here called a top link adapter and you can put this on you can take off that hook which I've done here you can take this hook off okay that would normally go right in here and you can put this on and this is a floating top link adapter here and it allows you almost infinite adjustment to hook up to a top link on an attachment okay so if you have a specifically a non-quick hitch compatible attachment or something that just has a really goofy top link to it you can put this on you can actually shorten your draw bars as much as possible so this kind of angles in so it's not sticking out extending way beyond the vertical point if you don't want it to and make it work so this is also included with the work saver quick hitch so a nice bonus from work savers the fact that they're manufactured in Litchfield Illinois right here in the USA okay so this one here is Al and pride QH 15 it came in on an L Series Kubota a while back this kind of kept it on hand so folks you'll see what they are and you'll see it's got the multiple holes in the top link which is a great feature as well to adjust that top link up and down or the top hook I should say very similar construction to the others you'll note that difference there in the cross bracing underneath take a look at the backside here so you can see that look on the far side and then right there okay this guy here is the popular John Deere I match the nice thing is you can get these in green I can't sell the work savers in green unfortunately take a look at the cross-bracing there okay again multiple locations to adjust that top hook very similar construction this guy here is at our River this is very similar to a Harbor Freight quickhitch okay good channeling their cross bracing really the rest of its similar in construction again he had the adjustment there for the top hook okay so we're gonna weigh these now I put this piece of steel here simply because they're u-shaped and I want something to open up at the top up here let the legs hang down and hopefully rest on here and then I zeroed out the scale so 0.0 right now with this piece of steel on here as well okay so the land pride QH 15 weighs in at 68 point four pounds next up here is the John Deere I match okay sixty five point eight pounds okay this one here is the Tar River quick hitch this is similar to a Harbor Freight okay you'll see 50 6.0 pounds okay last one up here is the work saver quick hitch 71 point two for the work saver quick hitch okay alright so those kind of results are ones that speak for themselves you can see what the weight is you can see what you're paying for then right so weights kind of speak for themselves right you know I mean you can kind of tell with more cross bracing you would think that the work saver would weigh more than the I match and the land pride however the work saver looks very similar to the tar river but what was there there was a 15 16 pound difference between the work saver and the tar river the work saver ended up being the heaviest out of the bunch there so perhaps that's attributed to more cross bracing perhaps a little bit thicker steel something along those lines okay so I'm going to go ahead and grab a critical dimension here on all of these which is a centerline to centerline of the lower link points here I'm really not worried about lower to upper because all of these again have the adjustable positions here so you really have a lot of flexibility with them they're more concerned about left to right on the two lower links let's see what the work saver reads here we're looking at about twenty eight and a quarter next here we'll do the land pride and again this is very approximate you know don't hold me to it but we're very close here 28 and a quarter-inch now let's do the John Deere I match the John Deere I match is about 28 and a half Center to Center let's take a look at the tar river there tar river is 28 and a half as well Center to Center okay so what we can see here is they're all within a quarter inch and that's again I'm just put it down and run the tape across I'm not exactly I'm trying to get close to center to center there but it's not this is not scientific okay this is just to get you close enough and I can tell you that a quarter inch is close enough for this measurement here okay so now let's touch on cost or price and I really don't want to put specific prices in here because this video lasts for years and years and prices fluctuate and change over time however I can say that if we're gonna compare new to new - new - new - new I don't know how all four of them across the board new I can tell you that that tar river similar to a Harbor Freight is going to be at the lowest end price point okay this can be the cheapest one you can get then you step up to another tier which is really where the work saver and the I match and the land prides and a lot of the more quality more robust manufactured quick hitches are gonna be at and I can tell you that what I found is the land pride is the most expensive with the I match following closely behind it and then the work saver being actually the cheapest among those three and so again you get the work saver with that floating top link adapter which sometimes is valuable sometimes not that you get that extra set of bushings and you also get the convenience of those pins which some of them come with and some of them don't but it's just nice to know that the work saver does and again those work savers are made in the USA right in the Litchfield Illinois which is a bonus I know buddies aren't all the options but I thought four was a pretty good representation at some different levels and price points and manufacturers especially some from the major manufacturers out there with John Deere and Kubota and their sister companies or partner companies with their attachments so I felt like it was a pretty fair representation hey make sure you leave a comment below I'd love to hear from you I get things wrong sometimes we all learn something new every day when we get smarter but some of these things speak for themselves today and I'll let you make your own decision on the right quick hitch for you",
