management the biology of soil health

16
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:47,039
we have three outstanding speakers to

17
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,480
share information with you today both on

18
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:50,879
a broader

19
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,879
scale with respect to understanding the

20
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,120
biology of soil health as well as giving

21
00:00:52,879 --> 00:00:56,320
some specific information on a research

22
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:57,440
project that's been

23
00:00:56,320 --> 00:00:59,280
underway at the university of

24
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,160
wisconsin-madison for the past three

25
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
years

26
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:03,760
so we have joining us today dr matt

27

rourke who is a professor in the

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:07,680
department of soil science

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,040
and the state extension specialist in

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,439
soil fertility

31
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,040
we have dr teal potter who was a

32
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,720
postdoctoral researcher at the

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:16,720
university of wisconsin-madison

34
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,759
and is now at washington state

35
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:19,920
university

36
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:21,520
and miranda sakura who is an associate

37
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:23,159
research specialist in the department of

38
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:24,720
soil science here at the university of

39
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:26,640
wisconsin-madison

40
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,640
so i am going to hand it right off to

41
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:30,880
them they have a lot to share and we are

42
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,000
hoping to get a lot of questions from

43
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
the audience

44
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,680
um if you have questions please type

45
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:39,119
them in the chat

46
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:42,159
function in the sivant app we will

47
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,840
uh take questions throughout um

48
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,840
we may wait till pauses between the

49
00:01:43,840 --> 00:01:47,280
speaker or address them at the end but

50
00:01:45,840 --> 00:01:50,320
certainly as we go along

51
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:52,479
um ask your questions in the chat we

52
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:54,320
also have some interactive questions so

53
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:55,840
be looking out for that i will

54
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,520
let you know when those questions are in

55
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:59,119
the chat because we'd like to get your

56
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,680
opinion and your thoughts on

57
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,799
on some issues as well so with that i

58
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,880
will turn it over

59
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:09,920
to dr ruark thank you dr silva

60
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:10,800
so first off um yes i highly encourage

61
00:02:09,920 --> 00:02:14,160
everyone uh

62
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:15,680
ask questions so i found that uh you

63
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,400
know these virtual formats are a little

64
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,640
different right

65
00:02:16,400 --> 00:02:20,560
and it'll be a lot more fun with more

66
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:23,599
questions that we get so

67
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,599
uh overall uh the the title of our

68
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,200
presentation or organic row crop

69
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:28,080
management and the biology of soil

70
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:29,920
health

71
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:31,120
and today we're gonna cover we're gonna

72
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:32,800
have three different sections i'm gonna

73
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:34,160
talk a little bit to start on just an

74
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,400
overview of soil health and

75
00:02:34,160 --> 00:02:38,800
just the perspective on soil health that

76
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:41,040
we know where we're coming from on it

77
00:02:38,800 --> 00:02:42,560
uh miranda is going to talk about

78
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:43,599
managing for soil health and organic

79
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,280
production systems

80
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:47,360
so a little bit more specifics on

81
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:49,920
management and based on some

82
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:51,200
on-farm survey work we've done and then

83
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,879
teal is going to get into a deeper

84
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:55,440
understanding of soul microorganisms and

85
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
what they do

86
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:02,879
so the overview of of soil health

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:04,879
and so i would imagine

88
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,480
as everyone thinks about soil health you

89
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,080
know everyone might have a little

90
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:09,599
different take on it and so i always

91
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:11,760
like to use this slide

92
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:12,879
uh put together by my my friend steve

93
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:14,480
coleman

94
00:03:12,879 --> 00:03:16,159
you know what does the soil a healthy

95
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:17,200
soil consist of right and i'm sure

96
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:20,239
everyone on this

97
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:21,280
on this uh zoo meeting here can think

98
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:23,360
about

99
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,319
you know several things of how they

100
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:26,879
would describe

101
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,519
a healthy soil right and so some of

102
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:30,400
these might be

103
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:30,879
might be have sufficient nutrients good

104
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:33,599
tilth

105
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,560
good workability sufficient rooting

106
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:37,760
depth

107
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:41,760
good drainage few pathogens

108
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:45,040
but um plenty of beneficial soil biota

109
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:47,760
low weed pressure no harmful toxins

110
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,040
to the crop and brazil uh and resilience

111
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,560
to degradation

112
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,239
now you know uh what's interesting about

113
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:54,720
this is none of this

114
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,159
none of these are connected to one

115
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,640
specific measurement per se

116
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,120
right so it's about healthy soil is

117
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:02,560
about what we want

118
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,959
and how that what the charac these

119
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,840
bigger characteristics are of the soil

120
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,959
so we all i put this together to kind of

121
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:10,560
get out

122
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:12,400
what we've done in soil health from a

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,319
soil science perspective is we have

124
00:04:12,400 --> 00:04:15,439
devolved it a little bit into soil

125
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:17,120
testing

126
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:18,479
and so you're just starting with this

127
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,799
idea up to the left this fluffy

128
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,919
definition conception of soil health

129
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,520
we know soil health is good um but

130
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,280
really is it about what are the specific

131
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:28,320
things we want from the soil we had that

132
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:30,080
list before but i

133
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,360
you know in theory there would be a

134
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,560
hundred or more things we might want

135
00:04:31,360 --> 00:04:34,639
from the soul right

136
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:36,720
and maybe a better way to capture that

137
00:04:34,639 --> 00:04:37,120
is the idea of ecosystem services what's

138
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:40,639
that

139
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:42,240
service that soil is providing

140
00:04:40,639 --> 00:04:43,759
but what we really need to do and we're

141
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:44,479
going to work over here on this side of

142
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:46,320
the world

143
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,960
the specific soil measurements what do

144
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:50,800
we need to measure about the soil

145
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:52,720
that does connect in some way to the

146
00:04:50,800 --> 00:04:55,040
things we want from the soil

147
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:56,000
and then also in a perfect world that

148
00:04:55,040 --> 00:04:57,680
these specific soil

149
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,520
measurements may connect to agronomic

150
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,360
decision making meaning if

151
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:03,280
you could quantify if you could get a

152
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,880
certain measurement of your soil

153
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:06,400
would can you know that you're able to

154
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:07,680
achieve higher yields

155
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,600
would you be able to reduce your

156
00:05:07,680 --> 00:05:10,160
nutrient inputs would you be able to

157
00:05:09,600 --> 00:05:14,000
reduce

158
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:16,639
your your need for

159
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:18,000
other inputs to manage pests and disease

160
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,680
then you have this side of the world

161
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,039
with crop management and all these crop

162
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,440
management effects that are

163
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,199
that are affecting these specific crop

164
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:26,720
measurements or crop management effects

165
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,600
that might be affecting the ecosystem

166
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,039
services so

167
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,880
you can see there it can get a little

168
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:32,320
fuzzy in here um

169
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:33,759
so i want to just make sure everyone

170
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:36,000
when we're thinking about it we do have

171
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:38,160
these things we want from the soil

172
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:39,440
but we also need to identify if soil if

173
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:41,120
the science of soil health is going to

174
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,560
advance we need to be able to identify

175
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:43,919
what we should be measuring and what

176
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:49,440
would be things that

177
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:51,120
we can measure in a relatively easy way

178
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:52,800
so you know we talk about ecosystem

179
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:53,440
services here's another kind of big

180
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:55,199
example of

181
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,720
all these other things that you know we

182
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:58,240
could list too the idea of carbon

183
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:02,000
sequestration

184
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:03,520
uh flood regulation um

185
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:05,280
foundation for human infrastructure you

186
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:07,120
know all of these different things

187
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:09,280
so it's there's so many things but it's

188
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:10,960
hard to capture like the idea of is it a

189
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,240
habitat for microorganisms well what

190
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:15,360
would you measure

191
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,160
to to know that and you might want to

192
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,400
measure

193
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:20,080
several things and that's the thing so

194
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:23,680
soil health is multivariate

195
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:25,840
by nature and so there's many properties

196
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
uh that can or should be measured and we

197
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:28,319
probably can't sum it up with a single

198
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:31,039
number so this is our

199
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:32,160
this is our great challenge so many of

200
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,600
you have probably seen these

201
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,360
this figure we use it all the time

202
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:36,800
there's three circles and in the middle

203
00:06:35,360 --> 00:06:38,400
you know with the physical aspects of

204
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:39,680
soil the chemical properties the soil

205
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:41,199
and the biological

206
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:42,880
properties of soil and in the middle

207
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,560
where they all intersect that soil

208
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:47,039
health

209
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,560
okay so we have all these things and you

210
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:50,000
know we can kind of break it down well

211
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:51,840
chemical properties of soil these are

212
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,440
well studied they're easy to measure any

213
00:06:51,840 --> 00:06:53,919
soil test lab can tell you you know

214
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:56,400
about

215
00:06:53,919 --> 00:06:57,680
you know extractable nutrients they're

216
00:06:56,400 --> 00:06:59,440
the aspect of soils that we've been

217
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:00,960
studying probably the longest

218
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,199
um people have been studying soil

219
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:04,800
chemistry for well over 100 years

220
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:06,560
and we know what to do with those values

221
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:09,039
if you get a you know

222
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,479
a ph measurement or soil nutrient levels

223
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:13,199
we can utilize that to

224
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:15,199
to you know to make lime recommendations

225
00:07:13,199 --> 00:07:17,520
or nutrient recommendations

226
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,880
the physical aspects of soil you know

227
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,120
things like aggregation

228
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:22,400
compaction porosity they're well

229
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:24,800
understood

230
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:26,000
uh they're not necessarily easy to

231
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:28,240
measure because it

232
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:30,160
involves you know field evaluations but

233
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,080
they're often things you can see so if

234
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:32,400
you have compacted soil or you have poor

235
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:34,560
in

236
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,599
you know poor infiltration that's me

237
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:35,919
something that you're going to be able

238
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,039
to

239
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:41,120
you know sense about your soil so um

240
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:43,039
we may not you know there are things

241
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:45,759
that you can physically see and

242
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:47,280
and understand then it leaves us with

243
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:49,360
this biological measurement of soul and

244
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:52,319
that's been the big missing piece of

245
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:53,440
um soil testing for a long time it's not

246
00:07:52,319 --> 00:07:55,360
i'm going to say it's not well

247
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:57,120
understood it's pretty complex

248
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:59,039
it's we can say there's certain things

249
00:07:57,120 --> 00:08:00,479
that are easy to measure

250
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,080
but it's not we're not quite sure

251
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:02,879
exactly what to measure yet we're doing

252
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:04,960
a lot of

253
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:08,800
testing of specific measurements to kind

254
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:11,120
of bring into our soil testing world

255
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,960
so as we think about all of these things

256
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:14,800
um you know connecting that function to

257
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:16,879
indicator and maybe i should have that

258
00:08:14,800 --> 00:08:18,160
arrow going the other way

259
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:20,160
you know if we want to manage it we need

260
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:21,199
to be able to measure it so if we want

261
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,800
to measure those

262
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:24,800
functions if we want to manage for those

263
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,319
functions we need to pick indicators

264
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:28,560
you can see this there's a laundry list

265
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:29,520
of things here uh for chemical physical

266
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,039
and biological

267
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:33,360
and so we've got to pair down on which

268
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:35,120
which ones we're going to use

269
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,800
uh the other aspect of a good soil

270
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,719
health indicator this is

271
00:08:36,800 --> 00:08:40,080
from a paper put out a few years ago and

272
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,760
i thought they did an excellent job

273
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,440
in terms of describing you know what we

274
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,040
want it needs to be evidence-based so we

275
00:08:43,440 --> 00:08:46,640
need to have some research on it

276
00:08:45,040 --> 00:08:48,640
it needs to be sensitive to changes in

277
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:50,320
management meaning that if

278
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,680
you know if you're going to change a

279
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,120
management practice if you're going to

280
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,040
add a management practice if it doesn't

281
00:08:53,120 --> 00:08:56,160
really it's not really affected by

282
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:57,200
management it's not going to be a good

283
00:08:56,160 --> 00:08:59,760
sole authenticator

284
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:01,279
it's not going to give you a sense of uh

285
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:03,120
if you're going up or down

286
00:09:01,279 --> 00:09:04,640
needs to be accurate and precise meaning

287
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:05,440
it has to have good scientific methods

288
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:07,600
behind it

289
00:09:05,440 --> 00:09:09,279
it needs to be cost effective which

290
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,640
really means it needs to be able to be

291
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:15,200
conducted in a soil test lab and um

292
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:16,399
there's certain uh tests that are pretty

293
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:18,800
expensive

294
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:19,519
probably don't fit into our soil testing

295
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:22,640
lab

296
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:24,000
world that easily um so they're probably

297
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:25,200
going to come it's going to be limited

298
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:27,360
in its use

299
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:29,600
and then lastly it has value and that

300
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:33,600
gets the idea of can we connect it to

301
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:35,120
something um some decision making

302
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:37,600
process right it might even just be as

303
00:09:35,120 --> 00:09:39,360
simple as did my yield potential go up

304
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:41,120
uh can it be connected to nutrients can

305
00:09:39,360 --> 00:09:42,000
it be connected to other decision making

306
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:46,800
for other

307
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:46,800
uh you know other disease or or

308
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,399
pest pressures

309
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:54,160
so the part that i want to kind of kind

310
00:09:52,399 --> 00:09:55,200
of circle in on here is this idea that

311
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:56,880
well

312
00:09:55,200 --> 00:09:58,000
most of these measurements one of the

313
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,880
big things we want to do is to get at

314
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:01,360
this idea of

315
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:02,720
a specific measure of organic matter now

316
00:10:01,360 --> 00:10:05,200
i'm sure a lot of you already getting

317
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:07,600
soil organic matter by loss on ignition

318
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,959
from soil test labs but it might be that

319
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:12,160
might not be the best

320
00:10:08,959 --> 00:10:12,959
uh indicator of soil health so because

321
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:15,279
there's different

322
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,240
parts of the organic matter and how fast

323
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,959
they cycle

324
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:19,760
so we have this idea that there's this

325
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:21,680
most of this

326
00:10:19,760 --> 00:10:23,519
organic matter is in this passive pool

327
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:25,600
where it doesn't cycle very fast the

328
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,200
turnover is decades or centuries

329
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:29,760
we have another pool that's the slow

330
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,279
pool that's years to decades of turnover

331
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:33,040
then we have this idea that there's this

332
00:10:31,279 --> 00:10:34,720
active pool of organic matter and that

333
00:10:33,040 --> 00:10:37,040
might be something we're interested in

334
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:37,760
so represents recently deposited organic

335
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,480
material

336
00:10:37,760 --> 00:10:42,320
with that involves a lot of rapid

337
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,640
decomposition and cycling

338
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:45,600
of carbon and nutrients so carbon which

339
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:47,920
would be

340
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:49,200
available to the soil microorganisms and

341
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:49,920
nutrients would be available to the

342
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,079
organisms

343
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
and the plant so it represents you know

344
00:10:52,079 --> 00:10:55,360
can represent anywhere between 10 to 15

345
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:57,040
percent of the organic matter and this

346
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:58,079
is a turnover that might happen within a

347
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:00,640
growing season

348
00:10:58,079 --> 00:11:02,079
so this active pool of organic matter

349
00:11:00,640 --> 00:11:03,839
can be considered an integrator of

350
00:11:02,079 --> 00:11:05,519
biology and chemistry

351
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,000
and we're going to talk a lot today

352
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,399
about two specific ways we can get at

353
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:12,000
that

354
00:11:08,399 --> 00:11:13,360
active pool and i'm going too fast

355
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:15,600
so there's two different ways we can get

356
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:18,000
at this active pool so the first one

357
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,360
is a soil incubation and this is the

358
00:11:18,000 --> 00:11:20,880
idea we're going to let the microbes

359
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:22,800
tell us what's going on

360
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:23,920
so for example in this case we're going

361
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:25,680
to take soil

362
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:27,760
we're going to we're going to incubate

363
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:28,560
it at a standard temperature and

364
00:11:27,760 --> 00:11:29,839
moisture

365
00:11:28,560 --> 00:11:32,000
in this case we're going to measure the

366
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:33,600
carbon dioxide production over time

367
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:36,560
so meaning we're going to uh let the

368
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:38,240
microbes uh consume that active pool

369
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,760
produce co2 we're going to measure that

370
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,200
increase in co2

371
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:42,720
so that's that's one way to go but it

372
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
does take time in this case this would

373
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:46,959
be a 24-hour

374
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,240
uh incubation some incubations might

375
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:50,720
might be recommended for

376
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,480
maybe three days so it's a it does take

377
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,399
some time to get that

378
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:56,079
the other idea is is there a chemical

379
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,399
extractions can we extract that

380
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,320
active carbon pool in the same in the

381
00:11:58,399 --> 00:12:02,240
same way we might extract soil test

382
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,760
phosphorus or potassium to get at some

383
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:05,360
sort of availability

384
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:07,440
and there is there's a there's a

385
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:09,519
permanganate oxidizable carbon sometimes

386
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,000
called poxy you might actually hear it

387
00:12:09,519 --> 00:12:12,959
actually

388
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:13,519
called active carbon and it's a quick

389
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:15,360
method

390
00:12:13,519 --> 00:12:17,200
and these extractions then can be easily

391
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,360
conducted by soil test lab so we have

392
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:22,880
two different approaches we've got the

393
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:22,880
uh we have the

394
00:12:23,040 --> 00:12:27,760
incubation approach and the chemical

395
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:27,760
extraction approach

396
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,200
uh so there's two uh interesting papers

397
00:12:35,839 --> 00:12:38,639
that have come out recently that i've

398
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,120
talked about some of the value of these

399
00:12:38,639 --> 00:12:40,959
organ

400
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:43,200
of organic matter and organic matter

401
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:44,959
pools so the first one on the left is

402
00:12:43,200 --> 00:12:46,480
this global meta-analysis on the

403
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:47,680
relationship between organic matter and

404
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:50,560
crop yields

405
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:51,040
and that connected uh organic matter

406
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,480
with

407
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:54,079
corn and wheat yields we're saying that

408
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:55,839
as organic matter increases

409
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,680
up to four percent so do corn and wheat

410
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,680
yield so overall there's a benefit to

411
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:01,680
increasing organic matter

412
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:02,800
and uh especially as it's tied to

413
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:07,839
production

414
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,839
but uh um

415
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:14,079
but it uh but it's it's still the

416
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:16,639
uh the big organic matter pool right so

417
00:13:14,079 --> 00:13:18,959
it's it's that great integrator

418
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,240
now the the other paper that that has

419
00:13:18,959 --> 00:13:21,920
come out uh

420
00:13:20,240 --> 00:13:23,680
improved soil biological health

421
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,000
increases corn grain yield

422
00:13:23,680 --> 00:13:28,079
and here we're saying roughly a 20

423
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,440
increase in soil health metrics which

424
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:32,079
include that

425
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:33,440
extractable carbon and the total carbon

426
00:13:32,079 --> 00:13:35,279
soil together

427
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:36,880
lead to a five percent increase in yield

428
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:40,720
so all of our indicators

429
00:13:36,880 --> 00:13:42,639
at this kind of growth scale here

430
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,639
are indicating that as we improve soil

431
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,000
health and and build organic matter

432
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,720
that's going to help our production

433
00:13:46,000 --> 00:13:48,880
systems

434
00:13:46,720 --> 00:13:49,760
so now now grant now this is very this

435
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:51,839
is a broad

436
00:13:49,760 --> 00:13:53,120
take on this right so uh what the

437
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:53,680
research you're going to hear today is

438
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,440
going to

439
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,800
is going to get this is we've taken a

440
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,360
more regionalized approach to

441
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:00,880
understanding that that relationship

442
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,880
and then lastly then so those are the

443
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:04,240
those are the simple measurements

444
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,720
and then the question is is there more

445
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:07,920
value in more complex biological

446
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:09,680
measurements

447
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:11,839
and so with this is this is one of the

448
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,240
big things we're studying on a lot

449
00:14:11,839 --> 00:14:16,320
of of our research is well there are

450
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:17,040
these more sophisticated measurements we

451
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:19,120
can do

452
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:20,639
such as soul amplicon sequencing that

453
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:24,079
can tell us which

454
00:14:20,639 --> 00:14:25,519
bacteria and fungi are present we can do

455
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,120
soil metagenomics

456
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:29,120
so it gets at what the bacteria and

457
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,480
fungi are capable of doing

458
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:35,279
uh we can also do soil meta uh

459
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,720
transcript dot mix uh that gets to what

460
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,920
the bacteria and fungi are

461
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:41,279
actively doing now uh and so

462
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,800
you might hear some of these terms a

463
00:14:41,279 --> 00:14:44,320
little bit later so we have the idea of

464
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,839
like what are these simple measurements

465
00:14:44,320 --> 00:14:47,440
are they providing value

466
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:48,720
and then do we is there something else

467
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,959
we can learn by having these more

468
00:14:48,720 --> 00:14:52,240
biological uh more complex biological

469
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:55,360
measurements taken

470
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:57,519
and what can we learn from them so as we

471
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:58,720
kind of have more discussions today so

472
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:00,959
soil health

473
00:14:58,720 --> 00:15:02,240
um is a young emerging field that needs

474
00:15:00,959 --> 00:15:04,560
refinement

475
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:06,240
uh our angle that it needs soil type and

476
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:07,600
region specific recommendations and

477
00:15:06,240 --> 00:15:10,079
that's hopefully what we're

478
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:11,279
we're gonna demonstrate today uh to a

479
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,440
certain extent

480
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:15,360
uh it might need crop specific

481
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:17,920
recommendations that might be

482
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:19,040
um you know do grain crops and vegetable

483
00:15:17,920 --> 00:15:21,279
crops may differ

484
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,320
uh in terms of of how they're responding

485
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,680
to soil health

486
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:25,600
certainly we do recommend it should be

487
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:27,040
evaluated over time you know i haven't

488
00:15:25,600 --> 00:15:29,120
talked about the idea of

489
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,880
soil health as a metric you know is it

490
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,680
something to see where you're going are

491
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:35,759
you increasing maintaining or decreasing

492
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,959
it needs to be connected to all s

493
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,079
aspects

494
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,040
of uh of i should say output which is

495
00:15:40,079 --> 00:15:44,560
yield and quality so that does tie to

496
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,759
vegetable and fruit production

497
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:51,199
as well so um

498
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,480
with that uh we do have a question um

499
00:15:51,199 --> 00:15:58,160
that would like to pose to the group

500
00:15:54,480 --> 00:16:01,040
uh before uh miranda starts to talk and

501
00:15:58,160 --> 00:16:02,639
the question is if you had funds

502
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:04,399
is i make sure this is the right one if

503
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:05,839
anyone's okay if you have funds to

504
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:08,000
implement or adjust one management

505
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:09,600
practice to improve soil health

506
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:11,120
what management practices would you

507
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,720
prioritize and

508
00:16:11,120 --> 00:16:14,720
uh dr silva is going to put that up in

509
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:17,600
the chat and um

510
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,279
and we encourage you you all to answer

511
00:16:17,600 --> 00:16:21,680
yeah i think i put it in this

512
00:16:19,279 --> 00:16:22,560
i think i put it in the live q a so you

513
00:16:21,680 --> 00:16:25,360
can see

514
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:27,199
it and what we'd like you to do and

515
00:16:25,360 --> 00:16:28,720
we're hoping to use the upvote function

516
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:31,040
but i'm not sure if that's going to work

517
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,199
um ideally if we were live teal does an

518
00:16:31,040 --> 00:16:34,560
awesome job doing live polls as part of

519
00:16:33,199 --> 00:16:38,240
the presentation

520
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:39,440
but if if you can um put one of these

521
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,399
letters in

522
00:16:39,440 --> 00:16:42,720
as a question so we can get a sense of

523
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,720
where

524
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:46,880
you might want to prioritize that would

525
00:16:44,720 --> 00:16:50,320
be awesome kind of a fun way to

526
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:51,360
to see um what people are thinking um so

527
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:54,560
we'll give that a shot

528
00:16:51,360 --> 00:16:57,519
trying some novel things with the

529
00:16:54,560 --> 00:16:57,519
q a function

530
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:04,079
while we're waiting for that for a

531
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:05,600
minute we do have one other question

532
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:07,520
in the chat do you want to look at that

533
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,039
right now matt

534
00:17:07,520 --> 00:17:10,720
uh the one that aaron just posted that

535
00:17:09,039 --> 00:17:12,959
says uh

536
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,720
with respect to biological testing

537
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:16,799
indicators could you not start with

538
00:17:14,720 --> 00:17:18,000
doing biomass assessments of the soil at

539
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:19,839
the root zone

540
00:17:18,000 --> 00:17:21,839
for major member components of the soil

541
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:24,959
food web for example

542
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:28,319
uh f to b ratios decomposers

543
00:17:24,959 --> 00:17:31,840
symbionts nutrients cyclers etc

544
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:32,160
so yeah so the answer is yes the problem

545
00:17:31,840 --> 00:17:34,000
is

546
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:35,919
i would put those in the category of

547
00:17:34,000 --> 00:17:38,240
more complex measurements

548
00:17:35,919 --> 00:17:40,640
um to get that information and these are

549
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:42,320
becoming i mean these are routine

550
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,400
uh i mean these are analyses that we can

551
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:45,280
do you know pretty easily in an academic

552
00:17:44,400 --> 00:17:48,640
setting

553
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:51,840
um but our more expensive tests uh

554
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:55,280
for um for soil test labs to

555
00:17:51,840 --> 00:17:57,360
implement as of now as of now um so

556
00:17:55,280 --> 00:17:59,039
the the big the big struggle we have in

557
00:17:57,360 --> 00:18:00,559
soil health and soil health testing is

558
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:03,840
that idea between

559
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:05,039
uh cost and benefits so there are places

560
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:05,919
where you could probably get this

561
00:18:05,039 --> 00:18:07,200
information

562
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:09,440
but it's going to be certainly a lot

563
00:18:07,200 --> 00:18:11,440
pricier it is not these aren't rapid

564
00:18:09,440 --> 00:18:13,679
tests that can be incorporated uh easily

565
00:18:11,440 --> 00:18:14,880
necessarily into sole test labs so

566
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:17,440
and i think you're going to be we're

567
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:20,880
going to see some more discussion on

568
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:20,880
those types of measurements later on

569
00:18:21,039 --> 00:18:24,960
oh people are putting in answers all

570
00:18:23,039 --> 00:18:26,320
over the board which is so interesting

571
00:18:24,960 --> 00:18:29,280
as well as options

572
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:29,919
under clarifying the other of grazing

573
00:18:29,280 --> 00:18:32,080
and

574
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:43,840
improving soil texture so this is

575
00:18:32,080 --> 00:18:43,840
awesome i love the interaction here

576
00:18:44,240 --> 00:18:48,160
so so with that and and i and i hope uh

577
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:49,280
i think uh

578
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:52,320
this is gonna be great hopefully we can

579
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:54,559
keep that um all the comments coming in

580
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:57,440
so that i'm gonna turn it over to uh to

581
00:18:54,559 --> 00:19:00,480
miranda socorro

582
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:02,080
all right thanks matt um so matt gave us

583
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:04,480
a place to start in terms of

584
00:19:02,080 --> 00:19:06,160
thinking about what soil health is and

585
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,760
how do we measure it and make sense of

586
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,280
it right

587
00:19:07,760 --> 00:19:10,960
we also heard from y'all about what

588
00:19:09,280 --> 00:19:12,160
management you'd prioritize for soil

589
00:19:10,960 --> 00:19:14,240
health and apparently our list didn't

590
00:19:12,160 --> 00:19:16,320
encompass it all and of course it didn't

591
00:19:14,240 --> 00:19:18,000
um but now we're going to delve into how

592
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,520
to answer the questions that we want to

593
00:19:18,000 --> 00:19:20,960
know about biological self how are we

594
00:19:19,520 --> 00:19:23,039
how are you doing that

595
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:25,120
so we want to know things like how do we

596
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,640
design soil health assessments

597
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:30,960
that give us useful information to

598
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:33,280
make farm management decisions and what

599
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,960
management decisions should we make

600
00:19:33,280 --> 00:19:37,120
that would give us desired biological

601
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
functions

602
00:19:37,120 --> 00:19:40,400
well i hate to break it to y'all but

603
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,960
there isn't a single approach that gives

604
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,840
us it all

605
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,600
as matt said it's pretty complicated um

606
00:19:43,840 --> 00:19:47,600
but researchers they're taking multiple

607
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:49,440
approaches to understand what's the most

608
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,400
important factors for biological soil

609
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:53,280
health

610
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:55,760
so whether that is related to the

611
00:19:53,280 --> 00:19:58,080
cropping system its diversity

612
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,960
um what kind of management is being

613
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:02,559
utilized on the farm by the farmers

614
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:04,559
and what's going on with the soil and

615
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:07,280
its inhabitants

616
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:08,880
so each approach has its own strengths

617
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:10,000
and weaknesses but we'll look at three

618
00:20:08,880 --> 00:20:12,000
research projects

619
00:20:10,000 --> 00:20:15,360
that are happening in wisconsin as case

620
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:15,360
studies and some lessons learned

621
00:20:17,679 --> 00:20:21,679
all right so the three research

622
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:22,480
approaches we will look at today cover a

623
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,640
huge range

624
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:27,360
in terms of how realistically they

625
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:29,520
represent what would happen on a farm

626
00:20:27,360 --> 00:20:31,440
the closest we can get to reality is the

627
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:34,000
field survey approach

628
00:20:31,440 --> 00:20:34,799
so this utilizes fields on working farms

629
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,840
compared to

630
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:39,919
fields on agricultural research stations

631
00:20:37,840 --> 00:20:41,440
so there's no experimental treatments or

632
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:43,840
prescribed management practices

633
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:45,679
implemented it is more so a survey of

634
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:47,440
management that is already happening on

635
00:20:45,679 --> 00:20:49,919
the farm

636
00:20:47,440 --> 00:20:50,880
so with that management that's happening

637
00:20:49,919 --> 00:20:52,640
we can explore

638
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,400
and try to explain differences in soil

639
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:57,280
health measurements by the different

640
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:59,440
management practices happening

641
00:20:57,280 --> 00:21:00,799
at the other end of the spectrum we have

642
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:03,120
greenhouse experiments

643
00:21:00,799 --> 00:21:04,000
so greenhouses are really controlled

644
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:07,280
settings

645
00:21:04,000 --> 00:21:09,200
we can make sure that the crop growing

646
00:21:07,280 --> 00:21:10,880
conditions are optimal or at least not

647
00:21:09,200 --> 00:21:12,400
limiting so that we can look at

648
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:13,919
microbial community effects

649
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:15,440
and processes that are they are

650
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:18,240
performing and how that affects the

651
00:21:15,440 --> 00:21:18,240
crops themselves

652
00:21:19,520 --> 00:21:23,440
also in these greenhouse experiments we

653
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:25,760
can really limit external factors so

654
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:26,559
that we can focus on specific questions

655
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:27,919
to

656
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,919
things like microbial community

657
00:21:27,919 --> 00:21:32,000
composition and the functions that they

658
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:34,799
perform

659
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,400
so in the middle of these two are field

660
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:38,720
scale and plot scale

661
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:41,840
experimental trials that occur on

662
00:21:38,720 --> 00:21:44,640
agricultural research stations

663
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:46,559
so these kinds of trials determine the

664
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:48,080
effect of specific management practices

665
00:21:46,559 --> 00:21:50,000
or cropping systems

666
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,240
on whatever we're interested in in this

667
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:54,960
case biological soil health

668
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:56,880
so on one side we have the farm fields

669
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:59,440
which represent

670
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:59,919
the most realistic situation but it's

671
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:01,520
really

672
00:21:59,919 --> 00:22:03,120
complicated there's a lot of factors and

673
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:04,080
variation involved

674
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:05,600
because there's so much different

675
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:07,200
management and different soils on

676
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:08,559
different fields

677
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:10,880
but this makes them really interesting

678
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:13,280
to understand and identify trends and

679
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:15,360
what's happening on these farms

680
00:22:13,280 --> 00:22:17,760
but as i said they're complex there's a

681
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:20,080
lot of noise to sift through

682
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:21,679
because of those differences so it's

683
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,799
hard to pinpoint

684
00:22:21,679 --> 00:22:28,000
what are the key things happening

685
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:30,000
for those kinds of studies you need a

686
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,240
lot of fields to participate so that we

687
00:22:30,000 --> 00:22:33,760
can kind of mitigate that effect

688
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:35,600
but in the controlled greenhouse

689
00:22:33,760 --> 00:22:38,240
experiments you get rid of a lot of that

690
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:40,960
noise to answer those specific questions

691
00:22:38,240 --> 00:22:42,400
but then we are limited to the kinds of

692
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:45,840
questions that we can ask

693
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:45,840
so it's a smaller subset

694
00:22:48,080 --> 00:22:52,720
all right so first we're going to look

695
00:22:51,039 --> 00:22:55,039
at a field survey

696
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:56,400
so remember field surveys utilize the

697
00:22:55,039 --> 00:22:59,600
differences in management

698
00:22:56,400 --> 00:23:02,559
already happening on working farms

699
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:03,919
but also has the field differences and

700
00:23:02,559 --> 00:23:06,840
soil characteristics

701
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:09,520
as important characters factors to

702
00:23:06,840 --> 00:23:12,320
identify

703
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,080
so in this case we are interested in

704
00:23:12,320 --> 00:23:15,200
important factors for biological soil

705
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:17,600
health

706
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:19,039
field surveys don't necessarily look at

707
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:21,360
change over time

708
00:23:19,039 --> 00:23:22,159
but they are more so a survey of what is

709
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:24,559
contributing

710
00:23:22,159 --> 00:23:25,200
to differences between fields and what

711
00:23:24,559 --> 00:23:28,400
is

712
00:23:25,200 --> 00:23:28,400
making those contributions

713
00:23:28,720 --> 00:23:32,320
so an example of this is a sare funded

714
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,200
project in the southwest driftless area

715
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,159
of wisconsin

716
00:23:33,200 --> 00:23:37,440
that is down here in this southwest

717
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:40,640
corner of wisconsin

718
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:42,880
um worked with 16 organic grain and

719
00:23:40,640 --> 00:23:45,039
dairy farms

720
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,279
so um we worked with them to evaluate

721
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:50,720
how differences in soil characteristics

722
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:54,720
things like texture and ph as well as

723
00:23:50,720 --> 00:23:54,720
management affect biological soil health

724
00:23:56,320 --> 00:24:03,200
so we visited the farms in 2018 and 2019

725
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:04,799
to take soil samples at 124 fields

726
00:24:03,200 --> 00:24:07,039
they were taken in spring before the

727
00:24:04,799 --> 00:24:08,799
planting of the next cash crop

728
00:24:07,039 --> 00:24:10,559
each field was following a corn year so

729
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:13,120
that we controlled for what the previous

730
00:24:10,559 --> 00:24:16,320
crop was

731
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:18,000
trying to mitigate some of that noise

732
00:24:16,320 --> 00:24:20,480
all right so in the upper right you see

733
00:24:18,000 --> 00:24:22,080
that there's a an icon that indicates

734
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:24,159
we're talking about field surveys

735
00:24:22,080 --> 00:24:25,919
um teo will also be presenting results

736
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:28,480
on the field survey so that's a way to

737
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:28,480
let you all know

738
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:34,240
all right so for the study we obtained a

739
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:36,640
detailed history from the farmers of the

740
00:24:34,240 --> 00:24:38,400
previous five years of management

741
00:24:36,640 --> 00:24:40,159
so that's related to the cropping

742
00:24:38,400 --> 00:24:42,320
sequence and its diversity

743
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:44,720
as well as the tillage management

744
00:24:42,320 --> 00:24:47,520
tillage management and manure management

745
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,880
utilized on the fields we also got some

746
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:50,960
more long-term information

747
00:24:48,880 --> 00:24:52,880
such as how long have the fields been

748
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:55,520
organic and what was their previous use

749
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:55,520
to organic

750
00:24:56,520 --> 00:25:00,880
[Music]

751
00:24:58,880 --> 00:25:02,559
to obtain data on field soil

752
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:03,679
characteristics we use the publicly

753
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,279
available

754
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,480
soil data from nrcs's web soil survey

755
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:11,039
so you might have seen something like

756
00:25:08,480 --> 00:25:12,960
this before if you try to utilize nrcs's

757
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,480
tool to look at your own soil

758
00:25:12,960 --> 00:25:16,080
it's an online platform with

759
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:17,919
location-based data

760
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:20,400
that's from soil mapping of the united

761
00:25:17,919 --> 00:25:22,240
states the information obtained from

762
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:23,840
here is primarily soil factors that are

763
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:27,600
outside of the farmer's control

764
00:25:23,840 --> 00:25:29,840
like soil texture and its classification

765
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,679
something we want to know is what soil

766
00:25:29,840 --> 00:25:33,360
characteristics are the most influential

767
00:25:31,679 --> 00:25:35,360
on biological soil health

768
00:25:33,360 --> 00:25:37,279
so that soil health assessments when you

769
00:25:35,360 --> 00:25:40,000
send in a sample

770
00:25:37,279 --> 00:25:41,760
to get soil health testing those

771
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:43,760
assessments take into account the soil

772
00:25:41,760 --> 00:25:45,440
differences

773
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,360
that are outside of the farmer's control

774
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:49,919
so we can rate them among peers

775
00:25:47,360 --> 00:25:51,440
you can get more accurate assessments

776
00:25:49,919 --> 00:25:53,279
because not all soils have the same

777
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:56,080
capacity for soil health

778
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:57,679
and specifically for certain functions

779
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:00,799
so we need to include these differences

780
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:04,000
when we rate how well a field is doing

781
00:26:00,799 --> 00:26:06,000
so is if like a is a field um

782
00:26:04,000 --> 00:26:07,840
median or less or less than a third of

783
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:09,679
its potential or is it meeting greater

784
00:26:07,840 --> 00:26:10,880
than two-thirds of its potential

785
00:26:09,679 --> 00:26:13,200
you know those are some things we want

786
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:13,200
to know

787
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:17,600
all right so matt gave a little intro

788
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:18,720
into some of the indicators that we

789
00:26:17,600 --> 00:26:20,320
measure but

790
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:22,000
we're going to talk about four specific

791
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:26,080
ones so one of those is

792
00:26:22,000 --> 00:26:28,159
permanent oxidizable carbon or epoxy

793
00:26:26,080 --> 00:26:30,000
so this one is related to carbon as matt

794
00:26:28,159 --> 00:26:30,799
was saying and it measures the readily

795
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:33,039
available

796
00:26:30,799 --> 00:26:35,200
fraction of soil carbon that microbes

797
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:37,840
can use as an energy source

798
00:26:35,200 --> 00:26:40,240
basically it represents how much food do

799
00:26:37,840 --> 00:26:42,240
microbes have easy access to to perform

800
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,600
their key soil functions

801
00:26:42,240 --> 00:26:45,600
how much resource do they have

802
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:49,360
the other method matt was talking about

803
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:51,600
is mineralizable carbon

804
00:26:49,360 --> 00:26:53,200
so this is a measure of that co2 release

805
00:26:51,600 --> 00:26:54,240
by microbes as a result of their

806
00:26:53,200 --> 00:26:56,880
activity

807
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,400
so just like how we release co2 when

808
00:26:56,880 --> 00:27:01,200
we're performing functions we're going

809
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:04,000
for a walk we're going for a run

810
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,840
we release different amounts of co2 the

811
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:07,840
harder we work

812
00:27:14,480 --> 00:27:19,919
all right we also measured autoclave

813
00:27:17,600 --> 00:27:22,080
citrate extractable protein

814
00:27:19,919 --> 00:27:23,919
so this is soil protein and that's the

815
00:27:22,080 --> 00:27:26,000
largest nitrogen fraction

816
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,200
of soil organic matter in the soil and

817
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:29,679
that fraction the

818
00:27:27,200 --> 00:27:30,960
microbes they can convert that via

819
00:27:29,679 --> 00:27:33,520
decomposition

820
00:27:30,960 --> 00:27:35,279
to plant available forms of nitrogen so

821
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,070
represents bioavailable nitrogen that

822
00:27:35,279 --> 00:27:39,279
might be crop available

823
00:27:37,070 --> 00:27:40,799
[Music]

824
00:27:39,279 --> 00:27:42,799
while another measure we use is

825
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:45,200
potentially mineralizable nitrogen

826
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:47,360
so this measures the rate by which

827
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:49,600
microbes convert

828
00:27:47,360 --> 00:27:51,520
that organic form of nitrogen to plant

829
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:53,039
available forms so also getting that

830
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:55,679
bioavailable nitrogen but

831
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,799
asking more so how fast are microbes

832
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,799
able to turn over that nitrogen

833
00:27:58,799 --> 00:28:03,679
so this gives us some informations in

834
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:06,000
terms of some biological soil fertility

835
00:28:03,679 --> 00:28:07,840
as well as carbon dynamics happening as

836
00:28:06,000 --> 00:28:10,559
well how are we moving towards

837
00:28:07,840 --> 00:28:10,559
organic matter

838
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,200
all right um we're now going to look at

839
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,120
a snapshot of the management that's

840
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:20,000
happening on these fields

841
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:20,559
so in this management is only what was

842
00:28:20,000 --> 00:28:22,399
happening

843
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:24,720
in the previous five years before the

844
00:28:22,399 --> 00:28:26,559
samples were taken

845
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,399
so to a lot of the farmers for utilizing

846
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,000
management practices that aim at

847
00:28:28,399 --> 00:28:32,080
preventing soil erosion

848
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,250
limiting soil disturbance and overall

849
00:28:32,080 --> 00:28:34,640
improving soil health

850
00:28:33,250 --> 00:28:36,159
[Music]

851
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,360
and you know it might be performing more

852
00:28:36,159 --> 00:28:39,120
multiple functions like that like

853
00:28:37,360 --> 00:28:42,320
providing nitrogen

854
00:28:39,120 --> 00:28:44,000
so 79 of the fields had a perennial crop

855
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,520
within the last five years and that was

856
00:28:44,000 --> 00:28:47,279
primarily alfalfa

857
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,200
so both providing perennial cover and

858
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:51,200
nitrogen biologically

859
00:28:53,440 --> 00:28:57,440
seventy-six percent of fields had prone

860
00:28:55,279 --> 00:29:00,640
to legume cover and twenty percent had

861
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:00,640
annual legume cover

862
00:29:02,320 --> 00:29:07,120
also you might notice here that um

863
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:08,480
the fields were pretty split in their

864
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:11,039
cover crop use so

865
00:29:08,480 --> 00:29:14,559
a little over 50 of the fields had

866
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:14,559
covered a winter cover crop

867
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:18,080
less than 20 of the fields utilize

868
00:29:16,960 --> 00:29:19,919
minimum tillage

869
00:29:18,080 --> 00:29:22,080
over the five-year period which we

870
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:25,120
defined as a disc implement or

871
00:29:22,080 --> 00:29:26,399
shallower tillage implement and you also

872
00:29:25,120 --> 00:29:28,480
see that about 20

873
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:29,520
of fields had at least one year of

874
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:32,880
no-till

875
00:29:29,520 --> 00:29:36,480
um within the five years

876
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:37,679
and most of the fields applied manure so

877
00:29:36,480 --> 00:29:38,559
that was one of the things that was

878
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:41,039
pretty consistent

879
00:29:38,559 --> 00:29:42,240
between fields but overall you see that

880
00:29:41,039 --> 00:29:44,720
there's a lot of different management

881
00:29:42,240 --> 00:29:46,559
practices happening on the skills

882
00:29:44,720 --> 00:29:48,080
but does this lead to measurable soil

883
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,200
health differences does it tell us

884
00:29:48,080 --> 00:29:51,200
something about management

885
00:29:51,360 --> 00:29:54,399
we're going to look at a subset of

886
00:29:52,720 --> 00:29:55,190
management practice data to tell the

887
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:58,720
overall story

888
00:29:55,190 --> 00:30:00,960
[Music]

889
00:29:58,720 --> 00:30:02,720
so over the five year period the number

890
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:05,360
of years of legume cover

891
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:07,360
perennial cover or a winter cover crop

892
00:30:05,360 --> 00:30:09,120
did not produce a measurable effect

893
00:30:07,360 --> 00:30:10,640
on these four biological measurements

894
00:30:09,120 --> 00:30:12,720
that we measured

895
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:15,120
the number of manure applications didn't

896
00:30:12,720 --> 00:30:18,720
have an effect either

897
00:30:15,120 --> 00:30:18,720
but what about some other practices

898
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:22,399
it did i identify a few management

899
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:25,039
practices but

900
00:30:22,399 --> 00:30:26,720
all of the effects were small so the

901
00:30:25,039 --> 00:30:29,679
biggest relationship identified

902
00:30:26,720 --> 00:30:30,399
was with crop diversity so as crop

903
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:34,080
diversity

904
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:37,120
increased epoxy pmn and ace

905
00:30:34,080 --> 00:30:39,360
increased however at most

906
00:30:37,120 --> 00:30:40,559
it explained less than six percent of

907
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:42,640
the differences

908
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:43,679
um in soil health measurements between

909
00:30:42,640 --> 00:30:45,360
fields

910
00:30:43,679 --> 00:30:48,159
um and that is seen by these r squared

911
00:30:45,360 --> 00:30:50,480
values um you can measure like

912
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:52,159
take these r squared values times them

913
00:30:50,480 --> 00:30:53,440
by a hundred and that basically tells

914
00:30:52,159 --> 00:30:56,399
you the percent

915
00:30:53,440 --> 00:30:57,440
that um the number of different crops is

916
00:30:56,399 --> 00:31:00,880
able to explain

917
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:00,880
in these proxy values

918
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,159
so what you're seeing is that less than

919
00:31:05,360 --> 00:31:09,519
six percent

920
00:31:06,159 --> 00:31:11,200
of epoxy differences in proxy

921
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:12,799
is explained by crop traversing so

922
00:31:11,200 --> 00:31:15,440
there's this leftover

923
00:31:12,799 --> 00:31:16,960
94 percent that is from other factors

924
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:19,840
such as soil characteristics and

925
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:19,840
management

926
00:31:21,679 --> 00:31:26,000
you can also see that how long a field

927
00:31:23,360 --> 00:31:29,120
has been certified organic

928
00:31:26,000 --> 00:31:31,919
had small effects so hoxie as

929
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:33,919
um as the length that they've been

930
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:35,679
certified organic increased epoxy

931
00:31:33,919 --> 00:31:39,840
increased and ace increased

932
00:31:35,679 --> 00:31:41,360
but it was very small so uh these small

933
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:43,679
effects you know they're they're a bit

934
00:31:41,360 --> 00:31:46,080
disheartening um

935
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:47,600
but let's look at this a little bit more

936
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:49,919
in detail

937
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:52,559
so we're going to focus in on that

938
00:31:49,919 --> 00:31:56,559
duration of organic management piece to

939
00:31:52,559 --> 00:31:58,480
kind of think on us more so in the study

940
00:31:56,559 --> 00:32:00,159
farms they ranged from being in

941
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:02,799
transition to organic

942
00:32:00,159 --> 00:32:04,480
to having over 27 years of organic

943
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:07,039
management

944
00:32:04,480 --> 00:32:08,720
so that's quite a long range even with

945
00:32:07,039 --> 00:32:11,679
this long range

946
00:32:08,720 --> 00:32:13,120
less than four percent of differences in

947
00:32:11,679 --> 00:32:16,799
soil health values

948
00:32:13,120 --> 00:32:20,159
this case epoxy and ace were explained

949
00:32:16,799 --> 00:32:20,159
by how long they've been organic

950
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:26,960
so there's a leftover 96 percent

951
00:32:23,840 --> 00:32:28,159
again that is explained more so by

952
00:32:26,960 --> 00:32:29,840
other factors such as soil

953
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:32,240
characteristics and other management

954
00:32:29,840 --> 00:32:35,039
practices that are happening on the farm

955
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:36,799
farms are really complex systems and

956
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:38,240
they're managed differently for a number

957
00:32:36,799 --> 00:32:40,240
of reasons

958
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,000
so there is more variation captured on

959
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:45,120
working fields then it recommended

960
00:32:42,000 --> 00:32:45,120
experimental trials

961
00:32:46,159 --> 00:32:50,559
although i don't think you know there's

962
00:32:48,799 --> 00:32:53,360
still an important message here

963
00:32:50,559 --> 00:32:54,720
right the important message is that

964
00:32:53,360 --> 00:32:56,480
management practices

965
00:32:54,720 --> 00:32:58,320
and soil characteristics are more

966
00:32:56,480 --> 00:33:00,880
critical than time

967
00:32:58,320 --> 00:33:01,360
there's some young fields that have

968
00:33:00,880 --> 00:33:04,240
really

969
00:33:01,360 --> 00:33:06,240
high biological soil health and there's

970
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:09,200
some older fields with low

971
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:11,120
biological soil health so understanding

972
00:33:09,200 --> 00:33:11,760
which management practices contributed

973
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:14,320
the most

974
00:33:11,760 --> 00:33:16,320
to the high soil health values is really

975
00:33:14,320 --> 00:33:20,000
critical into

976
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,000
improving biological soil health

977
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:27,440
to make things a little bit more

978
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:29,679
complicated something we should remember

979
00:33:27,440 --> 00:33:30,720
is that not all soils have the same soil

980
00:33:29,679 --> 00:33:33,600
health potential

981
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:35,360
regardless of management this is due to

982
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,120
soil properties that are outside of the

983
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:39,440
farmer's control

984
00:33:37,120 --> 00:33:41,440
for example ball saws soils formed under

985
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:43,440
historical prairie cover have higher

986
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:45,679
soil organic matter than several other

987
00:33:43,440 --> 00:33:48,720
common wisconsin soils

988
00:33:45,679 --> 00:33:50,000
used for agricultural production and

989
00:33:48,720 --> 00:33:51,760
this is due to the long-term

990
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:52,559
contributions of that prairie's root

991
00:33:51,760 --> 00:33:55,279
system

992
00:33:52,559 --> 00:33:55,919
turning over those roots and leaving

993
00:33:55,279 --> 00:33:59,200
behind so

994
00:33:55,919 --> 00:34:00,799
organic matter so soil health

995
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:01,840
assessments need to account for these

996
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:04,880
differences in soil

997
00:34:01,840 --> 00:34:07,840
potential to properly rate current field

998
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:07,840
soil health values

999
00:34:08,399 --> 00:34:12,000
using the publicly available soil data

1000
00:34:10,639 --> 00:34:14,000
we found that the u.s soil

1001
00:34:12,000 --> 00:34:15,520
classification system was useful for

1002
00:34:14,000 --> 00:34:16,800
explaining differences in soil health

1003
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:18,560
values

1004
00:34:16,800 --> 00:34:20,159
this is important as we can separate

1005
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:22,079
soils into different groups

1006
00:34:20,159 --> 00:34:23,839
by their classification to rate their

1007
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359
soil health according to their true

1008
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:27,520
potential

1009
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:29,760
so on the screen is a map of the

1010
00:34:27,520 --> 00:34:31,040
classifications represented in the study

1011
00:34:29,760 --> 00:34:32,159
we're talking about in the driftless

1012
00:34:31,040 --> 00:34:35,200
region

1013
00:34:32,159 --> 00:34:38,000
so of the 124 fields in the study

1014
00:34:35,200 --> 00:34:39,679
the soils there's about i think five

1015
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,240
soil classifications

1016
00:34:39,679 --> 00:34:43,200
represented in the study and that makes

1017
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,560
up a majority

1018
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:50,079
of the acreage in the driftless area

1019
00:34:46,560 --> 00:34:51,919
um so basically we have a study with

1020
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,200
really well represented soils of the

1021
00:34:51,919 --> 00:34:55,119
driftless region

1022
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:57,119
so that suggests that we can use these

1023
00:34:55,119 --> 00:35:02,880
soil classifications for benchmarking

1024
00:34:57,119 --> 00:35:06,960
soil health in this region

1025
00:35:02,880 --> 00:35:08,880
okay so that was talking about

1026
00:35:06,960 --> 00:35:10,960
on-farm studies now we're going to

1027
00:35:08,880 --> 00:35:12,800
transition to experimental plot trials

1028
00:35:10,960 --> 00:35:14,880
with a focus on long-term research

1029
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:17,040
trials

1030
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:19,440
so this utilizes field scale and plot

1031
00:35:17,040 --> 00:35:21,359
scale experiments with replicated plots

1032
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:22,320
so repeated areas with the same

1033
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:24,400
management

1034
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:25,240
and it looks at the effect of management

1035
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,560
over time

1036
00:35:25,240 --> 00:35:28,160
[Music]

1037
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:29,440
in arlington wisconsin there's a

1038
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,000
long-term research trial known as the

1039
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:31,920
wisconsin

1040
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,200
integrated cropping systems trial or

1041
00:35:31,920 --> 00:35:35,599
wixed

1042
00:35:33,200 --> 00:35:38,160
and it was established in 1989 so

1043
00:35:35,599 --> 00:35:40,400
there's over 31 years of data

1044
00:35:38,160 --> 00:35:41,520
of how this management has affected the

1045
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:44,880
soil that's there in

1046
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:48,079
other qualities so this trial

1047
00:35:44,880 --> 00:35:49,200
specifically its purpose is to evaluate

1048
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,839
the productivity

1049
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:53,920
profitability and environmental impact

1050
00:35:51,839 --> 00:35:54,560
of organic and conventional agricultural

1051
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:59,119
practices

1052
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,720
in the upper midwest

1053
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,920
the plots they're about three quarters

1054
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:07,040
of an acre size so they're trying to

1055
00:36:03,920 --> 00:36:09,359
get near um to that field scale size

1056
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:13,839
to better represent the reality of what

1057
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:13,839
would happen on a farm

1058
00:36:14,240 --> 00:36:17,839
now going into what the cropping systems

1059
00:36:16,079 --> 00:36:18,720
are there are six common cropping

1060
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:21,200
systems

1061
00:36:18,720 --> 00:36:22,960
of the upper midwest chosen to look at

1062
00:36:21,200 --> 00:36:24,400
their long-term effects so the first

1063
00:36:22,960 --> 00:36:26,640
three in the top row

1064
00:36:24,400 --> 00:36:28,160
we have cash grain systems so this is

1065
00:36:26,640 --> 00:36:30,160
continuous corn

1066
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:31,200
a corn soybean rotation with minimum

1067
00:36:30,160 --> 00:36:33,599
tillage

1068
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,440
and a organic cash grain system which

1069
00:36:33,599 --> 00:36:37,920
has corn soybeans to wheat and red

1070
00:36:35,440 --> 00:36:37,920
clover

1071
00:36:38,240 --> 00:36:42,400
so the bottom three represent dairy

1072
00:36:40,960 --> 00:36:43,920
forage systems

1073
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:46,720
so we have a conventional system that

1074
00:36:43,920 --> 00:36:48,800
goes from corn to three years of alfalfa

1075
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:49,920
our organic forage system that goes from

1076
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:52,079
corn to

1077
00:36:49,920 --> 00:36:54,160
an oats nursing crop with alfalfa and

1078
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:55,839
one more year of alfalfa

1079
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:59,599
and then the last one is a highly

1080
00:36:55,839 --> 00:36:59,599
managed rotationally grazed pasture

1081
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,240
so the catchphrase systems and dairy

1082
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,839
forged systems

1083
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:10,400
they differ in their inclusion of

1084
00:37:07,839 --> 00:37:12,640
perennials so with dairy forage systems

1085
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:14,320
there's more perennials represented

1086
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:16,400
the inclusion of perennials also

1087
00:37:14,320 --> 00:37:18,079
inherently reduces disturbance so

1088
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:20,400
these broad categories differ in these

1089
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:22,320
two ways

1090
00:37:20,400 --> 00:37:23,680
you can also see that especially for the

1091
00:37:22,320 --> 00:37:25,599
cash grain systems that there's a

1092
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:27,359
gradient in crop diversity

1093
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:29,839
so we're able to ask questions about

1094
00:37:27,359 --> 00:37:31,520
that as well

1095
00:37:29,839 --> 00:37:33,119
for both the cash grain and the dairy

1096
00:37:31,520 --> 00:37:34,880
forge systems there's an organic system

1097
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:36,640
represented

1098
00:37:34,880 --> 00:37:40,320
so we're able to ask questions about

1099
00:37:36,640 --> 00:37:40,320
organic and conventional management

1100
00:37:41,119 --> 00:37:48,720
so here's a snapshot looking at year 27

1101
00:37:44,560 --> 00:37:51,680
of this project so in the 27th year

1102
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:53,200
we have pmn mineralizable carbon epoxy

1103
00:37:51,680 --> 00:37:54,240
measured these biological soil health

1104
00:37:53,200 --> 00:37:56,720
indicators

1105
00:37:54,240 --> 00:37:58,720
and what was found out is that the dairy

1106
00:37:56,720 --> 00:38:01,520
forage systems had the highest

1107
00:37:58,720 --> 00:38:03,760
biological soil health values

1108
00:38:01,520 --> 00:38:05,200
and primarily the rotationally grazed

1109
00:38:03,760 --> 00:38:08,160
pasture had the highest

1110
00:38:05,200 --> 00:38:10,160
out of all of these cropping systems so

1111
00:38:08,160 --> 00:38:11,680
the rotationally grazed pasture

1112
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:13,920
is a much different system than the

1113
00:38:11,680 --> 00:38:17,200
others as it has continuous living cover

1114
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:18,480
with no disturbance the living mat

1115
00:38:17,200 --> 00:38:20,160
protects the soil

1116
00:38:18,480 --> 00:38:22,400
and the roots are constantly sloughing

1117
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:22,400
off

1118
00:38:22,560 --> 00:38:27,760
and that material that root is fueling

1119
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:30,160
the soil system

1120
00:38:27,760 --> 00:38:33,839
um so the other cropping systems that

1121
00:38:30,160 --> 00:38:36,560
had higher biological health the

1122
00:38:33,839 --> 00:38:38,000
dairy forage systems they had more

1123
00:38:36,560 --> 00:38:41,680
perennial cover

1124
00:38:38,000 --> 00:38:47,839
so also less disturbance and more living

1125
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:47,839
roots presented represented

1126
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:52,960
yeah so specifically these derivative

1127
00:38:50,079 --> 00:38:55,599
foreign systems they had more of that

1128
00:38:52,960 --> 00:38:56,079
active carbon pool that carbon source of

1129
00:38:55,599 --> 00:38:58,560
few

1130
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:00,640
food for microbes they had higher

1131
00:38:58,560 --> 00:39:02,240
microbial activity and they had a higher

1132
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:05,599
rate of converting

1133
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:06,240
that organic nitrogen to plant available

1134
00:39:05,599 --> 00:39:09,280
forms

1135
00:39:06,240 --> 00:39:12,079
so the organic systems did not

1136
00:39:09,280 --> 00:39:12,480
have better biological soil health than

1137
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:14,720
the

1138
00:39:12,480 --> 00:39:15,599
conventional systems within those bins

1139
00:39:14,720 --> 00:39:19,359
of cash grain

1140
00:39:15,599 --> 00:39:22,079
and dairy forage um

1141
00:39:19,359 --> 00:39:23,119
yeah but the experimental trial was able

1142
00:39:22,079 --> 00:39:26,079
to

1143
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:27,680
capture this effect of perennial cover

1144
00:39:26,079 --> 00:39:29,839
which wasn't previously found in the

1145
00:39:27,680 --> 00:39:31,520
on-farm study

1146
00:39:29,839 --> 00:39:33,440
so that these experimental trials are

1147
00:39:31,520 --> 00:39:36,400
able to get rid of some of that noise

1148
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:39,760
that we see on farm studies

1149
00:39:36,400 --> 00:39:40,400
to like capture more management

1150
00:39:39,760 --> 00:39:43,839
practices

1151
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,839
and that's something we saw here

1152
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:48,240
miranda it looks like there was one

1153
00:39:46,640 --> 00:39:50,160
question about whether you have any

1154
00:39:48,240 --> 00:39:52,960
plots in the green bay or fox river

1155
00:39:50,160 --> 00:39:52,960
valley areas

1156
00:39:53,520 --> 00:39:58,960
this study did not it was specifically

1157
00:39:55,680 --> 00:40:00,800
looking in the driftless area to kind of

1158
00:39:58,960 --> 00:40:02,720
so we have the effect of different soil

1159
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:05,599
characteristics to like look at that

1160
00:40:02,720 --> 00:40:06,480
but also we didn't want to have super

1161
00:40:05,599 --> 00:40:08,319
different soils

1162
00:40:06,480 --> 00:40:10,640
so we kind of limited that way but i

1163
00:40:08,319 --> 00:40:13,280
know that maybe matt can talk about this

1164
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:15,920
later that there's been a wider

1165
00:40:13,280 --> 00:40:17,520
study all over wisconsin and somewhat in

1166
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:18,800
minnesota

1167
00:40:17,520 --> 00:40:20,720
but that's mostly focused on

1168
00:40:18,800 --> 00:40:22,560
conventional systems

1169
00:40:20,720 --> 00:40:23,760
so if that's of interest we can talk

1170
00:40:22,560 --> 00:40:26,560
about that

1171
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,960
maybe later all right there's a couple

1172
00:40:26,560 --> 00:40:30,560
other

1173
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:30,560
questions coming in

1174
00:40:30,880 --> 00:40:34,000
if there can be more information about

1175
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:37,440
the

1176
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:37,680
specific practices on farms specifically

1177
00:40:37,440 --> 00:40:39,440
if

1178
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:40,880
we can give the names maybe we can't

1179
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,560
give the names but maybe at least

1180
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:43,839
specific practices particularly if

1181
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,640
there's any doing

1182
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:47,119
rotational grazing i think as these were

1183
00:40:46,640 --> 00:40:50,000
i think

1184
00:40:47,119 --> 00:40:52,319
all pretty much not all but most organic

1185
00:40:50,000 --> 00:40:54,560
dairy farms that many of them would have

1186
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:58,400
had rotational grazing

1187
00:40:54,560 --> 00:41:00,560
as part of their management

1188
00:40:58,400 --> 00:41:02,319
yeah that's right so a lot of them are

1189
00:41:00,560 --> 00:41:04,960
organic dairy

1190
00:41:02,319 --> 00:41:07,760
so they did have pastures but we didn't

1191
00:41:04,960 --> 00:41:10,079
sample from them we were more focused on

1192
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,000
these organic row crop systems and how

1193
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:15,119
those specific fields were rotating

1194
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:16,560
but there was a field or there's

1195
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:19,920
multiple fields that

1196
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,800
was transitioned from a conventional

1197
00:41:19,920 --> 00:41:23,839
pasture system

1198
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:24,880
to an organic grain system and those

1199
00:41:23,839 --> 00:41:27,280
fields

1200
00:41:24,880 --> 00:41:28,720
um it's been like 10 years since they

1201
00:41:27,280 --> 00:41:30,240
were that conventional pasture system

1202
00:41:28,720 --> 00:41:32,079
but they had higher biological soil

1203
00:41:30,240 --> 00:41:34,800
health values just because they were

1204
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:36,880
a pasture at least that's my

1205
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:38,000
interpretation of it it wasn't many

1206
00:41:36,880 --> 00:41:41,920
fields but

1207
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:41,920
um yeah

1208
00:41:42,160 --> 00:41:46,160
thanks miranda and there's another

1209
00:41:44,160 --> 00:41:46,800
question and and matt i don't know if

1210
00:41:46,160 --> 00:41:48,960
you want to

1211
00:41:46,800 --> 00:41:51,200
chime in on this one too from other

1212
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:54,319
studies that you have done

1213
00:41:51,200 --> 00:41:57,760
with um at wixed but there's a

1214
00:41:54,319 --> 00:42:00,240
clarifying question as to the date the

1215
00:41:57,760 --> 00:42:02,160
wix data that the chemicals that were

1216
00:42:00,240 --> 00:42:02,800
applied in the conventional forage

1217
00:42:02,160 --> 00:42:05,040
system

1218
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:09,440
versus the organic didn't seem to be

1219
00:42:05,040 --> 00:42:09,440
impacting soil health in a negative way

1220
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:15,680
um in in terms of the

1221
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:16,560
indicators that we've measured right so

1222
00:42:15,680 --> 00:42:20,319
in terms of the

1223
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:20,319
of the thing so you know what

1224
00:42:20,880 --> 00:42:26,640
the so i guess that that is correct so

1225
00:42:24,480 --> 00:42:29,359
we didn't see a difference in in our

1226
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:32,160
the conventional system there is one

1227
00:42:29,359 --> 00:42:36,319
year of corn with three years of alfalfa

1228
00:42:32,160 --> 00:42:37,760
versus uh the organic system is one year

1229
00:42:36,319 --> 00:42:40,800
of corn with

1230
00:42:37,760 --> 00:42:41,520
uh two years of alfalfa so it's a longer

1231
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,040
set of

1232
00:42:41,520 --> 00:42:46,560
perennialization um

1233
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:48,960
those sort of factors kind of work out

1234
00:42:46,560 --> 00:42:51,760
the biggest differences tended to be

1235
00:42:48,960 --> 00:42:53,440
from cropping system right so going from

1236
00:42:51,760 --> 00:42:54,480
the grain cropping systems to those

1237
00:42:53,440 --> 00:42:57,280
cropping systems

1238
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:58,720
so the nuance of it uh we couldn't we

1239
00:42:57,280 --> 00:43:01,760
couldn't pull out so

1240
00:42:58,720 --> 00:43:02,319
um it seemed to be the broader carbon

1241
00:43:01,760 --> 00:43:05,520
input

1242
00:43:02,319 --> 00:43:08,000
and soil disturbance and manure input

1243
00:43:05,520 --> 00:43:11,040
effects that would have had the biggest

1244
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:14,640
benefit in terms of the

1245
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:17,200
the simple biological health indicators

1246
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,839
that make sense and teal mentioned that

1247
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:22,400
she's gonna

1248
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:26,079
talk a little bit about that too

1249
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:29,359
um so another question related to

1250
00:43:26,079 --> 00:43:31,520
wix the forage systems appear to give

1251
00:43:29,359 --> 00:43:40,319
better soil health numbers but how

1252
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:43,520
significant are those differences

1253
00:43:40,319 --> 00:43:45,920
how significant uh it

1254
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:47,680
right what is you know i'm sorry what is

1255
00:43:45,920 --> 00:43:48,880
significant mean right so is it mean

1256
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,520
that it's

1257
00:43:48,880 --> 00:43:52,319
um static they were statistically

1258
00:43:51,520 --> 00:43:53,920
significant

1259
00:43:52,319 --> 00:43:56,240
do they matter you know what do they

1260
00:43:53,920 --> 00:44:00,400
connect to um

1261
00:43:56,240 --> 00:44:02,000
in terms of any of these ecosystem

1262
00:44:00,400 --> 00:44:05,119
services

1263
00:44:02,000 --> 00:44:06,079
i don't know i don't know um those sort

1264
00:44:05,119 --> 00:44:08,160
of

1265
00:44:06,079 --> 00:44:10,079
that sort of stuff we don't have that

1266
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:12,400
quite connected

1267
00:44:10,079 --> 00:44:12,400
um

1268
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:16,480
that's not a very satisfying answer i

1269
00:44:15,200 --> 00:44:19,440
know the uh what

1270
00:44:16,480 --> 00:44:20,880
the i know it just gets into such a a

1271
00:44:19,440 --> 00:44:22,880
goofy little trick of

1272
00:44:20,880 --> 00:44:24,480
this is you know one location and it's

1273
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:26,160
very soil specific right if you're

1274
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,800
already working on a nice

1275
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:30,000
deep malasal soil that you kind of beat

1276
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,680
the heck out of

1277
00:44:30,000 --> 00:44:33,119
you know maybe it's just these broader

1278
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:33,839
ships and these subtle ships don't

1279
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:35,920
really

1280
00:44:33,839 --> 00:44:38,319
don't really matter but even the even

1281
00:44:35,920 --> 00:44:40,079
our biological health and our

1282
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:42,319
uh grain systems was still probably

1283
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:45,680
pretty good um

1284
00:44:42,319 --> 00:44:47,520
so what does it connect to um

1285
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:48,800
i don't uh i don't have a good answer

1286
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:51,200
for that i'm sorry

1287
00:44:48,800 --> 00:44:53,920
that relates to another question matt

1288
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,079
that's kind of along those same lines

1289
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:57,920
what is the soil type on the arlington

1290
00:44:56,079 --> 00:44:58,880
farm and do you think the results would

1291
00:44:57,920 --> 00:45:02,720
have been the same

1292
00:44:58,880 --> 00:45:06,160
comparatively on the boone sand of the

1293
00:45:02,720 --> 00:45:06,160
person asking the question

1294
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:14,319
so the what our one of our goals

1295
00:45:12,079 --> 00:45:15,359
you know one of miranda's goals and one

1296
00:45:14,319 --> 00:45:18,000
of our goals for

1297
00:45:15,359 --> 00:45:20,240
other soil health projects is to create

1298
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:21,599
these baseline measurements because

1299
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:23,760
you know obviously as miranda showed

1300
00:45:21,599 --> 00:45:25,520
there's so much inherent the inherent

1301
00:45:23,760 --> 00:45:29,119
properties of soil

1302
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,040
do have a syllabus controlling factor on

1303
00:45:29,119 --> 00:45:33,119
on your your baseline soil health

1304
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:36,000
measurement so it really

1305
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:37,440
uh i would pare it down to even like

1306
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:39,040
miranda's work is

1307
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,440
some of the best on the subject because

1308
00:45:39,040 --> 00:45:44,839
it's so geographically and so

1309
00:45:41,440 --> 00:45:48,000
soil um specific focused

1310
00:45:44,839 --> 00:45:49,680
um yes in general

1311
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,280
sandy soils will have lower soil health

1312
00:45:49,680 --> 00:45:54,880
values than uh

1313
00:45:51,280 --> 00:45:57,200
you know silt loam prairie derived soils

1314
00:45:54,880 --> 00:45:58,800
so as we think about how are we

1315
00:45:57,200 --> 00:46:00,720
splitting these out in terms of what a

1316
00:45:58,800 --> 00:46:01,440
baseline what's an expected value and

1317
00:46:00,720 --> 00:46:05,359
then within

1318
00:46:01,440 --> 00:46:07,200
each soil texture uh soil classification

1319
00:46:05,359 --> 00:46:08,000
system how much can you influence it

1320
00:46:07,200 --> 00:46:10,319
based on

1321
00:46:08,000 --> 00:46:11,359
based on measurement and then at the end

1322
00:46:10,319 --> 00:46:13,040
of the day

1323
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,160
what does it connect to and so we have

1324
00:46:13,040 --> 00:46:15,520
all of these things that you know i

1325
00:46:14,160 --> 00:46:16,960
talked about up front that we're still

1326
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:18,880
we are still scratching the surface on

1327
00:46:16,960 --> 00:46:21,200
it so right now we have a pretty good

1328
00:46:18,880 --> 00:46:23,520
handle on the the relative importance of

1329
00:46:21,200 --> 00:46:24,960
inherent properties versus management

1330
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:26,160
properties in which direction these

1331
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,680
management properties

1332
00:46:26,160 --> 00:46:30,560
or the management might affect soil

1333
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:32,079
health um and generally speaking it fits

1334
00:46:30,560 --> 00:46:34,800
it fits the general narrative more

1335
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:38,079
carbon inputs less soil disturbance

1336
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:38,800
um although not all those um necessarily

1337
00:46:38,079 --> 00:46:41,280
or

1338
00:46:38,800 --> 00:46:42,400
um were found significant in miranda's

1339
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:44,720
work

1340
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,839
but then the trick is what does it mean

1341
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:46,480
what does it mean for your cropping

1342
00:46:45,839 --> 00:46:48,640
system to

1343
00:46:46,480 --> 00:46:50,400
to do this and is that something you'd

1344
00:46:48,640 --> 00:46:52,319
want to manage for or are you just

1345
00:46:50,400 --> 00:46:54,240
do you just want to manage because

1346
00:46:52,319 --> 00:46:56,560
reducing tillage means reducing

1347
00:46:54,240 --> 00:46:57,599
you know fuel costs and reduces and we

1348
00:46:56,560 --> 00:46:59,280
know it reduces

1349
00:46:57,599 --> 00:47:01,920
uh you know sold disturbance and

1350
00:46:59,280 --> 00:47:04,000
improves the soil so

1351
00:47:01,920 --> 00:47:05,760
uh this is i know it becomes a bit of a

1352
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,800
circular argument but that's really kind

1353
00:47:05,760 --> 00:47:09,280
of where we're at

1354
00:47:06,800 --> 00:47:10,960
we haven't fully connected all of these

1355
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:11,680
these measurements the soil health

1356
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:14,000
measurements

1357
00:47:11,680 --> 00:47:15,520
to uh some sort of benefit where you

1358
00:47:14,000 --> 00:47:17,520
talk about those

1359
00:47:15,520 --> 00:47:19,119
if you want if it's significance is a

1360
00:47:17,520 --> 00:47:21,280
significant difference for what

1361
00:47:19,119 --> 00:47:23,280
and ideally be in my mind one of the big

1362
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:25,839
ones would be for plant health and plant

1363
00:47:23,280 --> 00:47:25,839
production

1364
00:47:27,359 --> 00:47:33,119
there's a couple questions related to

1365
00:47:30,000 --> 00:47:37,280
soil testing

1366
00:47:33,119 --> 00:47:40,240
both you know how useful

1367
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,000
the usual soil tests are for the average

1368
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:44,559
organic farmer that maybe they're

1369
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:47,440
they're not very helpful

1370
00:47:44,559 --> 00:47:48,000
give a specific recommendation for soil

1371
00:47:47,440 --> 00:47:51,760
tests

1372
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:54,400
and how often an average organic

1373
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:55,599
rotation with alfalfa corn soy and

1374
00:47:54,400 --> 00:47:58,720
clover

1375
00:47:55,599 --> 00:48:01,119
should soil test and specific

1376
00:47:58,720 --> 00:48:02,800
not only in terms of what tests but are

1377
00:48:01,119 --> 00:48:05,760
there

1378
00:48:02,800 --> 00:48:08,000
what are the best soil test labs in

1379
00:48:05,760 --> 00:48:10,079
michigan was specifically

1380
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,640
recommended so what's the ideal panel of

1381
00:48:10,079 --> 00:48:14,960
indicators what should people test for

1382
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:16,319
um how often should they test what left

1383
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:18,400
should they send to maybe we should have

1384
00:48:16,319 --> 00:48:20,960
you give another talk matt specifically

1385
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:20,960
on on

1386
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:24,000
test labs i mean i would always

1387
00:48:22,640 --> 00:48:26,400
recommend you know i was just like a

1388
00:48:24,000 --> 00:48:28,960
routine test test your nutrient levels

1389
00:48:26,400 --> 00:48:30,880
you know i think testing over time i

1390
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,240
think is really where the real value is

1391
00:48:30,880 --> 00:48:35,680
for a lot of

1392
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:37,760
uh a lot of this so having you know

1393
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:39,520
in general we recommend sampling every

1394
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:40,960
four years but you know sampling every

1395
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:42,319
other year might be good the more data

1396
00:48:40,960 --> 00:48:44,559
you can build

1397
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:46,400
and then graph that across time which

1398
00:48:44,559 --> 00:48:48,000
direction are you going with your

1399
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,760
nutrient levels in your soil with your

1400
00:48:48,000 --> 00:48:52,640
organic matter

1401
00:48:49,760 --> 00:48:54,640
and um any soil biological tests so a

1402
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:56,160
lot of these soil biological tests are

1403
00:48:54,640 --> 00:48:57,599
being incorporated into different soil

1404
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,760
test labs so you might be able to find

1405
00:48:57,599 --> 00:49:01,040
some test labs that are doing something

1406
00:48:59,760 --> 00:49:03,040
i kind of like it especially if you're

1407
00:49:01,040 --> 00:49:04,000
just sort of looking at stuff over time

1408
00:49:03,040 --> 00:49:06,000
again you know i say we don't know

1409
00:49:04,000 --> 00:49:07,200
exactly what to do with that numbers

1410
00:49:06,000 --> 00:49:09,119
there's some

1411
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:11,920
labs that might want to connect it to

1412
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:14,160
nutrient availability

1413
00:49:11,920 --> 00:49:15,040
i don't know i i don't know i don't have

1414
00:49:14,160 --> 00:49:17,760
any data to

1415
00:49:15,040 --> 00:49:20,079
support that but i do like the idea of

1416
00:49:17,760 --> 00:49:21,920
using that to monitor it over time

1417
00:49:20,079 --> 00:49:23,680
um and i think sometimes in today's

1418
00:49:21,920 --> 00:49:24,079
world i really honestly think with all

1419
00:49:23,680 --> 00:49:26,160
these

1420
00:49:24,079 --> 00:49:28,240
climate extremes we're facing i think

1421
00:49:26,160 --> 00:49:30,160
maintaining soil health is still as big

1422
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:31,920
of a win as increasing soil health

1423
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:34,160
so everything anything we can do to to

1424
00:49:31,920 --> 00:49:36,240
not further be reducing soil health

1425
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:37,760
i think that's this a win for us so if

1426
00:49:36,240 --> 00:49:38,400
you can be if you can increase that's

1427
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:40,480
great but

1428
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,000
even to know you are maintaining soil

1429
00:49:40,480 --> 00:49:43,520
health uh with your

1430
00:49:42,000 --> 00:49:46,160
with your cropping system and management

1431
00:49:43,520 --> 00:49:47,760
practices is a good thing to know

1432
00:49:46,160 --> 00:49:50,000
well there's some more questions but i

1433
00:49:47,760 --> 00:49:52,079
think that some of these might relate to

1434
00:49:50,000 --> 00:49:54,079
what teal's going to talk about

1435
00:49:52,079 --> 00:49:56,079
so what i think i'll do is hold off on

1436
00:49:54,079 --> 00:49:57,680
the questions please keep

1437
00:49:56,079 --> 00:50:00,160
typing in questions though these are

1438
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:03,119
great questions um but i think i'm gonna

1439
00:50:00,160 --> 00:50:04,400
um hold off have teal present her

1440
00:50:03,119 --> 00:50:05,680
information because again i think it

1441
00:50:04,400 --> 00:50:07,359
will inform some of these other

1442
00:50:05,680 --> 00:50:10,319
questions and then we can go back to the

1443
00:50:07,359 --> 00:50:10,319
q a from there

1444
00:50:11,119 --> 00:50:16,800
sounds good so can you see my screen

1445
00:50:14,400 --> 00:50:16,800
are we good

1446
00:50:20,880 --> 00:50:25,280
all right um so i'm teal i have been

1447
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:28,640
working on some of the

1448
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:30,559
same data sets as miranda so you'll see

1449
00:50:28,640 --> 00:50:32,160
those icons in the corner of my slides

1450
00:50:30,559 --> 00:50:33,680
as well

1451
00:50:32,160 --> 00:50:35,200
but i'm going to talk a little bit more

1452
00:50:33,680 --> 00:50:38,400
about the biological

1453
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:40,720
component of soil health

1454
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:42,319
and getting into the details of what we

1455
00:50:40,720 --> 00:50:43,440
we are trying to answer some of these

1456
00:50:42,319 --> 00:50:46,240
questions of

1457
00:50:43,440 --> 00:50:46,800
how does this living component of the

1458
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:49,760
soil

1459
00:50:46,800 --> 00:50:50,720
connect to these soil health indicators

1460
00:50:49,760 --> 00:50:54,240
that we

1461
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,960
know are sensitive to management know

1462
00:50:54,240 --> 00:50:57,920
have you know pretty inexpensive ways to

1463
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,160
measure

1464
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,680
but we still have a lot to do like matt

1465
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,440
was saying to connect this

1466
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:05,599
in and find out what is the useful

1467
00:51:03,440 --> 00:51:08,800
information that we need

1468
00:51:05,599 --> 00:51:12,160
moving forward

1469
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,079
so you know we do

1470
00:51:12,160 --> 00:51:15,599
microbes are important they are the ones

1471
00:51:14,079 --> 00:51:17,520
processing

1472
00:51:15,599 --> 00:51:19,920
decomposing the organic matter in the

1473
00:51:17,520 --> 00:51:23,119
soil to make it available for plants

1474
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:24,720
and also storing it in carbon so we do

1475
00:51:23,119 --> 00:51:29,359
want to use our microbes

1476
00:51:24,720 --> 00:51:32,000
to um and make their function

1477
00:51:29,359 --> 00:51:33,920
stronger so for reasons like disease

1478
00:51:32,000 --> 00:51:37,040
pressure

1479
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:40,640
reducing chemical inputs helping get

1480
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:42,319
maximum yields in our fields and

1481
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:43,839
it is pretty complicated as i know

1482
00:51:42,319 --> 00:51:46,400
you've heard but i'm going to show you

1483
00:51:43,839 --> 00:51:49,920
some of my research to illustrate this

1484
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:51,040
so and there are microbes and other

1485
00:51:49,920 --> 00:51:53,440
biota that

1486
00:51:51,040 --> 00:51:55,280
can contribute to a lot of different

1487
00:51:53,440 --> 00:51:59,200
functions in the soil

1488
00:51:55,280 --> 00:52:01,200
so in contributing to soil health

1489
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:02,400
disease suppression plant drought

1490
00:52:01,200 --> 00:52:04,640
resistance

1491
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:05,680
plant nutrient acquisition carbon

1492
00:52:04,640 --> 00:52:08,640
sequestration

1493
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:10,640
nutrient mineralization so making those

1494
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,359
carbon and nitrogen

1495
00:52:10,640 --> 00:52:15,359
phosphorus available to the plants and

1496
00:52:13,359 --> 00:52:16,480
water use

1497
00:52:15,359 --> 00:52:18,240
these are some of the functions we're

1498
00:52:16,480 --> 00:52:21,359
talking about when we're thinking about

1499
00:52:18,240 --> 00:52:24,480
the microbial component

1500
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:25,599
and a lot of what you may hear of a lot

1501
00:52:24,480 --> 00:52:29,040
of the products

1502
00:52:25,599 --> 00:52:31,359
that you see that are microbial focus

1503
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,119
are focused on microbes that have

1504
00:52:31,359 --> 00:52:35,280
specific

1505
00:52:32,119 --> 00:52:36,800
relationships with the plants

1506
00:52:35,280 --> 00:52:38,720
so you've probably heard about

1507
00:52:36,800 --> 00:52:42,160
mycorrhizal fungi

1508
00:52:38,720 --> 00:52:45,280
which trade plants plant roots carb

1509
00:52:42,160 --> 00:52:48,480
they trade nitrogen phosphorus

1510
00:52:45,280 --> 00:52:51,760
water for carbon sapr

1511
00:52:48,480 --> 00:52:54,800
troves are taking nutrients

1512
00:52:51,760 --> 00:52:59,040
from plants rhizobia these are bacteria

1513
00:52:54,800 --> 00:53:00,960
that fix nitrogen for plants some plants

1514
00:52:59,040 --> 00:53:02,400
endophytes are microbes there's a bunch

1515
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:04,960
of microbes that live in

1516
00:53:02,400 --> 00:53:06,559
plant tissues and then pathogens you

1517
00:53:04,960 --> 00:53:06,800
know we got to remember that pathogens

1518
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:08,559
are

1519
00:53:06,800 --> 00:53:09,839
microbes too they're part of this

1520
00:53:08,559 --> 00:53:12,960
microbial

1521
00:53:09,839 --> 00:53:14,640
microbiome in your soils they're fungi

1522
00:53:12,960 --> 00:53:17,440
and bacteria so we're thinking

1523
00:53:14,640 --> 00:53:19,359
i'm thinking about all these symbionts

1524
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:21,440
that have specific relationships with

1525
00:53:19,359 --> 00:53:24,319
plants

1526
00:53:21,440 --> 00:53:24,880
um but then there's a lot that's going

1527
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:27,760
on

1528
00:53:24,880 --> 00:53:28,960
for mediating how they mediate plant

1529
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:31,440
responses

1530
00:53:28,960 --> 00:53:32,319
and so for an example we think of

1531
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,359
mycorrhizae

1532
00:53:32,319 --> 00:53:38,240
mycorrhizal fungi

1533
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:39,359
as this great mutualist so plants

1534
00:53:38,240 --> 00:53:41,040
benefiting

1535
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:43,280
microbes are benefiting they're trading

1536
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:45,520
nutrients but

1537
00:53:43,280 --> 00:53:47,599
in certain conditions if the plant

1538
00:53:45,520 --> 00:53:50,319
doesn't need those nutrients

1539
00:53:47,599 --> 00:53:51,920
say phosphorus the microbe is in the

1540
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,559
microbes are still attached

1541
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:56,400
they can steal carbon from the plant so

1542
00:53:54,559 --> 00:53:59,520
we do need to understand

1543
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:00,720
this microbiome better because it's not

1544
00:53:59,520 --> 00:54:02,880
as simple as

1545
00:54:00,720 --> 00:54:03,839
mycorrhizae are good for your plants

1546
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:07,200
right they can

1547
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:09,839
start stealing your plants carbon

1548
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,760
and what i'm most interested in is

1549
00:54:09,839 --> 00:54:13,760
thinking about this whole context most

1550
00:54:11,760 --> 00:54:15,599
of these microbes are not symbionts

1551
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:17,599
they are free living microbes that are

1552
00:54:15,599 --> 00:54:19,839
in the soil they might

1553
00:54:17,599 --> 00:54:20,800
be associated with plant roots in that

1554
00:54:19,839 --> 00:54:22,400
they're

1555
00:54:20,800 --> 00:54:25,599
they're getting nutrients that those

1556
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:27,760
plant roots are secreting into the soil

1557
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:28,960
but they might not be pathogens or

1558
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:31,680
mutualists

1559
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:33,440
and they are competing with plants and

1560
00:54:31,680 --> 00:54:36,480
completing with pathogens

1561
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:38,319
for nutrients in the soil so

1562
00:54:36,480 --> 00:54:40,160
taking the big picture view is important

1563
00:54:38,319 --> 00:54:41,440
but it makes it really complicated when

1564
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:43,839
we know that there's

1565
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:45,920
you know more than 10 000 species in a

1566
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:47,680
single teaspoon of soil

1567
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:50,079
so i'll show you how we're getting at

1568
00:54:47,680 --> 00:54:53,119
some of this complexity and trying to

1569
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:55,680
distill it down

1570
00:54:53,119 --> 00:54:57,920
and you know we do know that there is

1571
00:54:55,680 --> 00:55:01,760
lots of evidence that farming practices

1572
00:54:57,920 --> 00:55:04,079
can impact soil biology so

1573
00:55:01,760 --> 00:55:04,799
this is important to know there's a lot

1574
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:06,960
of studies

1575
00:55:04,799 --> 00:55:08,640
tons of studies that have shown this but

1576
00:55:06,960 --> 00:55:11,040
it's not always

1577
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,720
and the responses vary by soil type and

1578
00:55:11,040 --> 00:55:15,680
climate

1579
00:55:12,720 --> 00:55:17,440
and the responses are not always huge

1580
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,960
not even usually huge

1581
00:55:17,440 --> 00:55:23,680
so there's a lot of reasons to focus on

1582
00:55:20,960 --> 00:55:25,119
a small area

1583
00:55:23,680 --> 00:55:27,200
but it is important to know in a

1584
00:55:25,119 --> 00:55:29,520
specific area whether management

1585
00:55:27,200 --> 00:55:31,280
practices do have consistent effects on

1586
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:34,160
biology

1587
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,960
within a region before we ask does it

1588
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:38,720
matter

1589
00:55:34,960 --> 00:55:38,720
right go to that next step

1590
00:55:38,799 --> 00:55:44,480
and so going to our

1591
00:55:42,559 --> 00:55:47,119
our field survey you can see the icon in

1592
00:55:44,480 --> 00:55:49,520
the corner that miranda talked about

1593
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,960
we asked how does organic farming change

1594
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:53,200
soils over time

1595
00:55:50,960 --> 00:55:53,200
and

1596
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:59,200
to do this we use these fields that had

1597
00:55:57,680 --> 00:56:02,000
been under organic management for

1598
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:04,799
different lengths of time

1599
00:56:02,000 --> 00:56:06,559
and we measured does this change soil

1600
00:56:04,799 --> 00:56:08,240
health indicators

1601
00:56:06,559 --> 00:56:10,000
you know what i'm interested in taking

1602
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,720
this a step further is can we measure

1603
00:56:10,000 --> 00:56:12,720
differences

1604
00:56:10,720 --> 00:56:15,359
in the biological community the living

1605
00:56:12,720 --> 00:56:15,359
communities

1606
00:56:15,440 --> 00:56:20,079
and we did this with um all these fields

1607
00:56:18,160 --> 00:56:21,280
from across all these farms and because

1608
00:56:20,079 --> 00:56:23,599
there's a lot of noise

1609
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:24,559
um differences among farms and soil

1610
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:28,400
types

1611
00:56:24,559 --> 00:56:30,720
um we did need a lot of samples

1612
00:56:28,400 --> 00:56:32,799
so the question here is you know no

1613
00:56:30,720 --> 00:56:35,440
one's done this before just seeing

1614
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:36,240
whether organic farming has a consistent

1615
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:39,680
effect

1616
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:42,240
on microbes before we can ask you know

1617
00:56:39,680 --> 00:56:43,680
what are they doing is it helping us and

1618
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:45,680
we don't know if that's a consistent

1619
00:56:43,680 --> 00:56:47,599
increase they just keep going up or if

1620
00:56:45,680 --> 00:56:49,440
it plateaus after a certain number of

1621
00:56:47,599 --> 00:56:52,000
years

1622
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:53,839
or maybe it goes up and goes down we

1623
00:56:52,000 --> 00:56:58,000
need to explore this

1624
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:00,960
and so this is what we did

1625
00:56:58,000 --> 00:57:02,960
on 124 field samples to hopefully see

1626
00:57:00,960 --> 00:57:05,200
some pattern among the noise

1627
00:57:02,960 --> 00:57:06,240
and here's the data right here so also

1628
00:57:05,200 --> 00:57:08,319
with biology

1629
00:57:06,240 --> 00:57:09,920
consistent with some of the measurements

1630
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:11,680
or the measurements that miranda told

1631
00:57:09,920 --> 00:57:15,200
you about

1632
00:57:11,680 --> 00:57:18,480
we just see no pattern

1633
00:57:15,200 --> 00:57:19,440
and so there could be high fungal

1634
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:21,760
species for

1635
00:57:19,440 --> 00:57:22,720
as one example we measured biomass we

1636
00:57:21,760 --> 00:57:26,079
measured

1637
00:57:22,720 --> 00:57:26,880
this for bacteria as well but there's a

1638
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:28,720
lot

1639
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:30,720
going on here right so there was

1640
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:32,319
probably tillage in the past history and

1641
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:34,319
there's tillage still happening on

1642
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:37,280
organic farms

1643
00:57:34,319 --> 00:57:39,760
the manure inputs are variable among the

1644
00:57:37,280 --> 00:57:42,880
farms

1645
00:57:39,760 --> 00:57:44,720
your rotations a lot of these farms are

1646
00:57:42,880 --> 00:57:48,319
doing similar crop rotations

1647
00:57:44,720 --> 00:57:49,760
but different sequences um

1648
00:57:48,319 --> 00:57:51,440
and so what to me this tells me one

1649
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:54,000
thing that's definitely different is

1650
00:57:51,440 --> 00:57:56,319
whatever pesticides or whatever

1651
00:57:54,000 --> 00:57:58,319
non-organic certified inputs

1652
00:57:56,319 --> 00:58:00,160
those do not seem to have a consistent

1653
00:57:58,319 --> 00:58:03,680
effect either those are breaking down

1654
00:58:00,160 --> 00:58:05,200
pretty rapidly and we're not detecting

1655
00:58:03,680 --> 00:58:08,319
that early on

1656
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:09,599
or you know there's a lot of microbes

1657
00:58:08,319 --> 00:58:11,200
out there that's what i'm always

1658
00:58:09,599 --> 00:58:14,400
thinking about

1659
00:58:11,200 --> 00:58:17,680
so there's a lot more that is being

1660
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:21,040
influenced at the field scale than

1661
00:58:17,680 --> 00:58:22,319
specific certified organic management

1662
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,799
practices

1663
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:27,680
so this is interesting and also brings

1664
00:58:24,799 --> 00:58:27,680
to the point that

1665
00:58:28,880 --> 00:58:32,160
these long-term field studies are really

1666
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:35,119
helpful to

1667
00:58:32,160 --> 00:58:36,400
seeing like within a region and very

1668
00:58:35,119 --> 00:58:39,359
precise

1669
00:58:36,400 --> 00:58:41,200
consistent management can we see effects

1670
00:58:39,359 --> 00:58:42,880
so we can understand when those

1671
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,400
when those might be important and what

1672
00:58:42,880 --> 00:58:46,240
is driving it

1673
00:58:44,400 --> 00:58:48,720
interestingly this paper just came out

1674
00:58:46,240 --> 00:58:50,400
this year that shows

1675
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,160
inconsistent effects of agriculture

1676
00:58:50,400 --> 00:58:54,880
practices on soil fungi

1677
00:58:52,160 --> 00:58:57,359
fungal communities across 12 european

1678
00:58:54,880 --> 00:58:59,280
long-term experiments

1679
00:58:57,359 --> 00:59:01,119
and a lot of these have been going for

1680
00:58:59,280 --> 00:59:04,799
over a hundred years

1681
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:07,839
so this is in belgium uk hungary

1682
00:59:04,799 --> 00:59:10,319
and denmark and you can see that just on

1683
00:59:07,839 --> 00:59:13,599
these outer

1684
00:59:10,319 --> 00:59:16,319
venn diagram loops there's pretty high

1685
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,119
highly different numbers in the uk they

1686
00:59:16,319 --> 00:59:22,960
had 124 fungal species

1687
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:25,200
in hungary they had 878 right so

1688
00:59:22,960 --> 00:59:26,720
determining whether that matters

1689
00:59:25,200 --> 00:59:27,760
probably is something you'd want to

1690
00:59:26,720 --> 00:59:30,640
focus on

1691
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:32,319
within your cropping system and thinking

1692
00:59:30,640 --> 00:59:35,680
about how it changes over time

1693
00:59:32,319 --> 00:59:37,599
because we see this variability

1694
00:59:35,680 --> 00:59:41,440
so with that i'm going to share a little

1695
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:43,839
bit what i found from the long term

1696
00:59:41,440 --> 00:59:47,040
trial that miranda also talked about

1697
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:50,319
looking at the biological components

1698
00:59:47,040 --> 00:59:54,079
from that system the wisconsin

1699
00:59:50,319 --> 00:59:54,079
integrated cropping system trial

1700
00:59:54,240 --> 00:59:57,359
and we measured it took samples from

1701
00:59:56,799 --> 01:00:00,640
five

1702
00:59:57,359 --> 01:00:05,760
of the six cropping systems that

1703
01:00:00,640 --> 01:00:09,280
are represented of the region

1704
01:00:05,760 --> 01:00:11,760
and we did also find

1705
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:13,599
a lot of miranda's work showed that

1706
01:00:11,760 --> 01:00:16,640
there's differences in poxc

1707
01:00:13,599 --> 01:00:20,319
and a lot of these indicators and

1708
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:21,760
we also found that among these cropping

1709
01:00:20,319 --> 01:00:23,119
systems there were significant

1710
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:26,160
differences

1711
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:28,559
in the continuous corn especially

1712
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:32,559
between continuous corn the most the two

1713
01:00:28,559 --> 01:00:32,559
extremes continuous corn and pasture

1714
01:00:32,880 --> 01:00:36,319
we also saw this for biomass so we

1715
01:00:34,720 --> 01:00:38,559
didn't see it for bacteria that was

1716
01:00:36,319 --> 01:00:40,559
significant differences but for biomass

1717
01:00:38,559 --> 01:00:41,839
we saw the same pattern for fungi and

1718
01:00:40,559 --> 01:00:45,200
bacteria

1719
01:00:41,839 --> 01:00:49,200
lowest biomass microbial biomass and

1720
01:00:45,200 --> 01:00:53,920
continuous corn similar

1721
01:00:49,200 --> 01:00:56,720
for the organic cash grain system

1722
01:00:53,920 --> 01:00:58,559
and quite a bit higher but we had some

1723
01:00:56,720 --> 01:01:00,880
questions for matt early on that

1724
01:00:58,559 --> 01:01:02,079
is really important to address you know

1725
01:01:00,880 --> 01:01:04,000
what

1726
01:01:02,079 --> 01:01:06,000
what do these measure what do these

1727
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:08,079
differences mean how much change is

1728
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:11,599
meaningful

1729
01:01:08,079 --> 01:01:15,359
so comparing our pasture um

1730
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:18,480
versus corn we can ask well

1731
01:01:15,359 --> 01:01:20,079
what can 68 additional species do for us

1732
01:01:18,480 --> 01:01:22,240
right and that is too broad a question

1733
01:01:20,079 --> 01:01:24,240
for a scientist to do anything with we

1734
01:01:22,240 --> 01:01:25,200
have to focus in a little bit so maybe

1735
01:01:24,240 --> 01:01:28,079
we could ask

1736
01:01:25,200 --> 01:01:31,760
does 68 additional species increase

1737
01:01:28,079 --> 01:01:31,760
organic matter decomposition

1738
01:01:32,240 --> 01:01:37,920
and another thing to note here is we're

1739
01:01:35,280 --> 01:01:38,720
talking about you know 68 species that's

1740
01:01:37,920 --> 01:01:40,880
i don't know

1741
01:01:38,720 --> 01:01:42,400
how to think about that so i don't know

1742
01:01:40,880 --> 01:01:45,040
if you can think about that

1743
01:01:42,400 --> 01:01:46,640
in a in a useful way but we are talking

1744
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:49,520
about 68 species

1745
01:01:46,640 --> 01:01:49,920
in a quarter of a gram of soil right

1746
01:01:49,520 --> 01:01:52,079
it's

1747
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:53,280
it's very small scale what we're able to

1748
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,920
measure

1749
01:01:53,280 --> 01:01:57,440
in the lab so these are super diverse

1750
01:01:55,920 --> 01:01:59,440
systems

1751
01:01:57,440 --> 01:02:01,760
i just wanted to make that note because

1752
01:01:59,440 --> 01:02:06,880
that's what we're talking about

1753
01:02:01,760 --> 01:02:08,720
um so to answer this question

1754
01:02:06,880 --> 01:02:10,000
um ecologists think that about this two

1755
01:02:08,720 --> 01:02:12,079
different ways

1756
01:02:10,000 --> 01:02:13,839
how what does increased species

1757
01:02:12,079 --> 01:02:16,319
diversity

1758
01:02:13,839 --> 01:02:16,960
mean what could it mean functionally

1759
01:02:16,319 --> 01:02:18,480
well

1760
01:02:16,960 --> 01:02:20,880
one of the predominant ways in which we

1761
01:02:18,480 --> 01:02:22,599
think about that is more species

1762
01:02:20,880 --> 01:02:25,520
means more types of microbial

1763
01:02:22,599 --> 01:02:28,640
metabolisms

1764
01:02:25,520 --> 01:02:30,960
oops which means more

1765
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:33,200
efficient decomposition you have

1766
01:02:30,960 --> 01:02:35,359
microbes that are decomposers

1767
01:02:33,200 --> 01:02:36,720
and i had a question about that there

1768
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,720
are so many different types of

1769
01:02:36,720 --> 01:02:39,839
decomposers there's decomposers that

1770
01:02:38,720 --> 01:02:43,039
focus on lignin

1771
01:02:39,839 --> 01:02:43,920
on cellulose on proteins on tons of

1772
01:02:43,039 --> 01:02:45,920
different things

1773
01:02:43,920 --> 01:02:47,119
so if you have more different types of

1774
01:02:45,920 --> 01:02:50,400
metabolisms

1775
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:53,680
you might get corn stalks

1776
01:02:50,400 --> 01:02:55,440
turned into you know salvaging that

1777
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:57,280
little bit of nitrogen in them

1778
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:58,720
or at least feeding the microbes more

1779
01:02:57,280 --> 01:03:02,559
efficiently

1780
01:02:58,720 --> 01:03:05,599
the other main hypothesis

1781
01:03:02,559 --> 01:03:06,319
is that more species if you have more

1782
01:03:05,599 --> 01:03:08,880
species

1783
01:03:06,319 --> 01:03:10,480
you're in a huge pool of species you're

1784
01:03:08,880 --> 01:03:12,880
more likely to have a few

1785
01:03:10,480 --> 01:03:14,160
that are really good at whatever you

1786
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,359
want to decompose

1787
01:03:14,160 --> 01:03:19,760
or whatever your function is so along

1788
01:03:17,359 --> 01:03:22,079
with the other soil health indicators

1789
01:03:19,760 --> 01:03:23,200
there's this general thinking that more

1790
01:03:22,079 --> 01:03:25,680
is better

1791
01:03:23,200 --> 01:03:26,880
and but here for microbes here's the

1792
01:03:25,680 --> 01:03:29,359
thinking behind it

1793
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:30,559
and these are things that we can test

1794
01:03:29,359 --> 01:03:33,200
and i'll show you a little bit

1795
01:03:30,559 --> 01:03:34,559
but i'm going to briefly bring this back

1796
01:03:33,200 --> 01:03:39,680
to biomass

1797
01:03:34,559 --> 01:03:42,960
so in this case the question might be

1798
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:45,039
you know does this difference matter

1799
01:03:42,960 --> 01:03:46,000
and probably most of you are not you

1800
01:03:45,039 --> 01:03:48,720
know you want to

1801
01:03:46,000 --> 01:03:49,839
grow cash crops so maybe your question

1802
01:03:48,720 --> 01:03:52,000
is not

1803
01:03:49,839 --> 01:03:53,599
how much better is it if i don't tell at

1804
01:03:52,000 --> 01:03:54,640
all and i just have pasture your

1805
01:03:53,599 --> 01:03:56,480
question might be

1806
01:03:54,640 --> 01:03:57,680
if i change my practices a little bit

1807
01:03:56,480 --> 01:04:01,520
and i want to

1808
01:03:57,680 --> 01:04:05,119
grow corn organically does 19

1809
01:04:01,520 --> 01:04:08,480
millimoles more of biomass

1810
01:04:05,119 --> 01:04:10,160
or 38 millimoles of microbial cells what

1811
01:04:08,480 --> 01:04:12,319
can that do for us

1812
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,400
to focus that in maybe your question

1813
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:16,400
might be does a difference in six

1814
01:04:14,400 --> 01:04:20,799
millimoles matter for long-term

1815
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:24,240
carbon storage well interestingly

1816
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:27,039
the hypothesis here is that more biomass

1817
01:04:24,240 --> 01:04:28,160
actually does contribute more stable

1818
01:04:27,039 --> 01:04:30,960
carbon

1819
01:04:28,160 --> 01:04:31,359
for long-term carbon storage and this is

1820
01:04:30,960 --> 01:04:35,200
something

1821
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:38,160
i didn't appreciate much until recently

1822
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:38,720
but there is a lot of great science

1823
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:41,599
happening

1824
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:42,240
recently that has been showing that a

1825
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:46,880
huge

1826
01:04:42,240 --> 01:04:48,079
contributor to stable carbon in soils is

1827
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:51,359
actually

1828
01:04:48,079 --> 01:04:54,160
the cell walls of micro bodies

1829
01:04:51,359 --> 01:04:55,039
so dead more microbes means more dead

1830
01:04:54,160 --> 01:04:57,599
microbes

1831
01:04:55,039 --> 01:04:59,440
that are actually recalcitrant forms of

1832
01:04:57,599 --> 01:05:00,400
carbon in the soil that don't break down

1833
01:04:59,440 --> 01:05:02,720
easily

1834
01:05:00,400 --> 01:05:05,119
so i think that's pretty interesting

1835
01:05:02,720 --> 01:05:07,680
that we're finding that

1836
01:05:05,119 --> 01:05:09,760
they break down less quickly than most

1837
01:05:07,680 --> 01:05:14,079
plant

1838
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:16,319
plant tissues so

1839
01:05:14,079 --> 01:05:18,160
i do want to follow up with this you

1840
01:05:16,319 --> 01:05:21,280
know i asked this question

1841
01:05:18,160 --> 01:05:22,880
is a increase better can we detect a

1842
01:05:21,280 --> 01:05:23,839
difference in something we might be

1843
01:05:22,880 --> 01:05:25,520
interested in

1844
01:05:23,839 --> 01:05:27,680
so we actually did this study in the

1845
01:05:25,520 --> 01:05:29,599
greenhouse which is pretty rare

1846
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:32,720
but i'm going to tell you a little bit

1847
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:36,400
about that study now

1848
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:38,240
so for this study we're interested in

1849
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,000
you know how does soil management affect

1850
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:41,839
soil microbes and then

1851
01:05:40,000 --> 01:05:43,440
bringing that back to something we're

1852
01:05:41,839 --> 01:05:46,319
interested in like plant yields

1853
01:05:43,440 --> 01:05:48,000
crop yields so we went back to some of

1854
01:05:46,319 --> 01:05:51,039
the fields that we

1855
01:05:48,000 --> 01:05:54,880
surveyed in the field survey

1856
01:05:51,039 --> 01:05:56,240
study and collected soils from them

1857
01:05:54,880 --> 01:05:58,880
and we use them in a greenhouse

1858
01:05:56,240 --> 01:05:58,880
experiment

1859
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,000
and this can allow us to ask this more

1860
01:06:02,720 --> 01:06:06,720
specific question right

1861
01:06:04,000 --> 01:06:08,319
because we can get all these soil

1862
01:06:06,720 --> 01:06:09,440
microbes from different places in a

1863
01:06:08,319 --> 01:06:12,559
controlled setting

1864
01:06:09,440 --> 01:06:12,559
and test their function

1865
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:18,240
so the question here was do soil micro

1866
01:06:16,720 --> 01:06:18,960
microbial communities from different

1867
01:06:18,240 --> 01:06:23,200
farms

1868
01:06:18,960 --> 01:06:23,200
influence crop growth differently

1869
01:06:24,160 --> 01:06:27,599
and we really are interested in whether

1870
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,720
they affect

1871
01:06:27,599 --> 01:06:32,960
crop growth differently but to really

1872
01:06:30,720 --> 01:06:34,960
see this we wanted to give the microbes

1873
01:06:32,960 --> 01:06:36,720
a functional test

1874
01:06:34,960 --> 01:06:38,400
this might not be enough to detect

1875
01:06:36,720 --> 01:06:40,319
anything so what we do

1876
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:43,920
we did is we give them different forms

1877
01:06:40,319 --> 01:06:46,240
of organic forms of nitrogen and urea

1878
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:48,000
and see if the microbes can decompose

1879
01:06:46,240 --> 01:06:50,400
these organic

1880
01:06:48,000 --> 01:06:52,960
sources of nitrogen differently so we

1881
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:55,200
added the same amount of nitrogen

1882
01:06:52,960 --> 01:06:56,799
even those different amounts of biomass

1883
01:06:55,200 --> 01:07:00,640
and we wouldn't expect

1884
01:06:56,799 --> 01:07:02,319
to see differences in urea because

1885
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:04,079
well the microbes don't need to

1886
01:07:02,319 --> 01:07:06,079
decompose that at all

1887
01:07:04,079 --> 01:07:08,160
that is readily available for plants to

1888
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:10,480
take up but these other ones we thought

1889
01:07:08,160 --> 01:07:13,359
we might see some differences

1890
01:07:10,480 --> 01:07:15,599
so here i'm going to share a quick video

1891
01:07:13,359 --> 01:07:17,920
this is a 40 second video on

1892
01:07:15,599 --> 01:07:20,240
this the methods on this greenhouse

1893
01:07:17,920 --> 01:07:20,240
setup

1894
01:07:23,280 --> 01:07:27,680
so this is showing we went out to the

1895
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,720
fields collected soils

1896
01:07:27,680 --> 01:07:33,200
we sterilized soil for the background

1897
01:07:30,720 --> 01:07:35,119
soil in the pots from a local soil

1898
01:07:33,200 --> 01:07:36,960
added that to the back of the pots the

1899
01:07:35,119 --> 01:07:40,000
95 of the volume

1900
01:07:36,960 --> 01:07:41,039
added live soil as five percent of the

1901
01:07:40,000 --> 01:07:43,039
pots

1902
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,319
so from the different farms and then on

1903
01:07:43,039 --> 01:07:47,200
top of that we added an

1904
01:07:44,319 --> 01:07:48,480
equal amount of nitrogen in the forms of

1905
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,200
urea manure

1906
01:07:48,480 --> 01:07:54,400
clover and sorghum sudan grass and then

1907
01:07:51,200 --> 01:07:57,920
we had the microbes decompose that

1908
01:07:54,400 --> 01:08:01,200
and then the corn was at a v4 stage we

1909
01:07:57,920 --> 01:08:01,920
harvested the experiment and dried the

1910
01:08:01,200 --> 01:08:05,200
plants

1911
01:08:01,920 --> 01:08:08,559
and weighed the plants so that was

1912
01:08:05,200 --> 01:08:08,880
a very quick method section there and as

1913
01:08:08,559 --> 01:08:11,599
we

1914
01:08:08,880 --> 01:08:13,280
expected we didn't see that different

1915
01:08:11,599 --> 01:08:14,880
communities microbial communities from

1916
01:08:13,280 --> 01:08:18,159
different farms we didn't see

1917
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:20,080
any effect on plant growth on corn or

1918
01:08:18,159 --> 01:08:23,759
rye growth

1919
01:08:20,080 --> 01:08:26,159
in the urea addition pots

1920
01:08:23,759 --> 01:08:27,440
we interesting we also did not see any

1921
01:08:26,159 --> 01:08:30,560
differences among

1922
01:08:27,440 --> 01:08:33,600
farms for clover and manure which had a

1923
01:08:30,560 --> 01:08:36,839
similar carbon to nitrogen ratio

1924
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:39,359
but we did see that it mattered which

1925
01:08:36,839 --> 01:08:43,279
microbes some microbial communities

1926
01:08:39,359 --> 01:08:47,040
allowed for more corn and rye growth

1927
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:49,600
and so how we're thinking about that

1928
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,480
is that you actually might need more

1929
01:08:49,600 --> 01:08:53,759
complex

1930
01:08:50,480 --> 01:08:56,880
or more diverse microbial communities

1931
01:08:53,759 --> 01:09:00,159
to efficiently break down the lignin

1932
01:08:56,880 --> 01:09:03,759
the cellulose this

1933
01:09:00,159 --> 01:09:05,679
tougher form of nitrogen

1934
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:08,319
to make that available to the plants and

1935
01:09:05,679 --> 01:09:10,640
some communities might do that better

1936
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:12,400
perhaps that is related to management

1937
01:09:10,640 --> 01:09:13,279
and what those fields were receiving

1938
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:15,199
recently

1939
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:17,679
i haven't looked at that to see if we

1940
01:09:15,199 --> 01:09:21,600
can detect that

1941
01:09:17,679 --> 01:09:23,839
so wrapping it up here

1942
01:09:21,600 --> 01:09:25,520
we can say that soil biology does matter

1943
01:09:23,839 --> 01:09:29,359
these processes are done by

1944
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:31,120
soil microbes but biology is persistent

1945
01:09:29,359 --> 01:09:33,120
if you're in the midwest you have a ton

1946
01:09:31,120 --> 01:09:34,480
of microbes in your soil so we're really

1947
01:09:33,120 --> 01:09:36,400
interested in

1948
01:09:34,480 --> 01:09:38,719
detecting small changes and thinking

1949
01:09:36,400 --> 01:09:38,719
about

1950
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:43,040
small changes i think that's my personal

1951
01:09:41,120 --> 01:09:45,120
perspective

1952
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:46,880
i do think that understanding biology

1953
01:09:45,120 --> 01:09:48,319
better may be able to

1954
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,279
help us understand soil health

1955
01:09:48,319 --> 01:09:51,279
indicators better

1956
01:09:52,719 --> 01:09:58,880
but i think a take home i would

1957
01:09:56,000 --> 01:10:01,199
like to say is that we're not at a point

1958
01:09:58,880 --> 01:10:03,440
where we can give specific advice on how

1959
01:10:01,199 --> 01:10:04,960
to manage your microbial community to

1960
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:07,600
get these benefits

1961
01:10:04,960 --> 01:10:08,400
but the best practices we have for soil

1962
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:11,280
health

1963
01:10:08,400 --> 01:10:11,920
are likely to help your microbes so if

1964
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,120
you're

1965
01:10:11,920 --> 01:10:18,719
having your fields covered more

1966
01:10:15,120 --> 01:10:22,080
doing minimal tillage as possible

1967
01:10:18,719 --> 01:10:25,040
doing things to build so organic

1968
01:10:22,080 --> 01:10:25,360
material in your fields those are things

1969
01:10:25,040 --> 01:10:28,560
that

1970
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:31,440
feed the microbial communities right so

1971
01:10:28,560 --> 01:10:32,080
more diversity and more biomass on your

1972
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,080
fields

1973
01:10:32,080 --> 01:10:35,679
is going to get you more microbes and

1974
01:10:34,080 --> 01:10:38,000
more diverse microbes

1975
01:10:35,679 --> 01:10:39,520
so i think that's kind of where we're at

1976
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:44,000
happy to answer some

1977
01:10:39,520 --> 01:10:47,360
questions thanks teo

1978
01:10:44,000 --> 01:10:51,280
um and related to that last point

1979
01:10:47,360 --> 01:10:55,840
um there was a question

1980
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:57,360
um is is there either through your work

1981
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:00,000
or through other work that you know an

1982
01:10:57,360 --> 01:11:02,560
inverse correlation between the amount

1983
01:11:00,000 --> 01:11:05,760
of tillage and the amount of fungi

1984
01:11:02,560 --> 01:11:07,840
um hearing that tillage is bad for

1985
01:11:05,760 --> 01:11:08,719
fungal communities and may be related to

1986
01:11:07,840 --> 01:11:10,560
that

1987
01:11:08,719 --> 01:11:12,000
and again that this may not be measured

1988
01:11:10,560 --> 01:11:14,800
in this study but maybe from other

1989
01:11:12,000 --> 01:11:15,679
literature if you do have tillage how

1990
01:11:14,800 --> 01:11:18,239
fast

1991
01:11:15,679 --> 01:11:20,719
quickly do those fungal communities

1992
01:11:18,239 --> 01:11:23,600
recover

1993
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:24,400
how bad is tillage that is a great

1994
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,880
question

1995
01:11:24,400 --> 01:11:28,719
um i'm actually starting some new work

1996
01:11:26,880 --> 01:11:30,560
in a new postdoc position that's going

1997
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,320
to be tilling up some

1998
01:11:30,560 --> 01:11:33,760
fields that haven't been tilled in 10

1999
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:36,640
years to see if we can

2000
01:11:33,760 --> 01:11:38,080
measure that on a fine finer scale

2001
01:11:36,640 --> 01:11:41,040
there's been some work on it

2002
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:42,640
and in general the thinking among the

2003
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:45,679
science we do have

2004
01:11:42,640 --> 01:11:46,640
is that um you know tillage does

2005
01:11:45,679 --> 01:11:50,239
decrease

2006
01:11:46,640 --> 01:11:52,080
fungal biomass um it has

2007
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,000
maybe slight negative effects on

2008
01:11:52,080 --> 01:11:56,560
diversity but there is

2009
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,760
enough variation among the studies that

2010
01:11:56,560 --> 01:12:01,040
um

2011
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:04,480
it's it's not super consistent

2012
01:12:01,040 --> 01:12:06,000
um how fast it happens so i do

2013
01:12:04,480 --> 01:12:07,440
that is a great question on recovery

2014
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,640
that's exactly what we're going to test

2015
01:12:07,440 --> 01:12:10,640
and do these

2016
01:12:08,640 --> 01:12:13,040
fine scale measurements over short

2017
01:12:10,640 --> 01:12:16,560
periods of time to try and track that

2018
01:12:13,040 --> 01:12:19,360
recovery the thinking behind the

2019
01:12:16,560 --> 01:12:20,320
fungi specifically is that the fungal

2020
01:12:19,360 --> 01:12:23,760
bodies are these

2021
01:12:20,320 --> 01:12:25,840
networks of mycelium of hyphae

2022
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,880
and so the tillage breaks them up and

2023
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,120
parts will not

2024
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,960
recover very super quickly as opposed to

2025
01:12:29,120 --> 01:12:34,719
bacteria which are so tiny

2026
01:12:30,960 --> 01:12:37,120
that um that their bodies are not going

2027
01:12:34,719 --> 01:12:39,360
to get broken up by tillage

2028
01:12:37,120 --> 01:12:40,320
but i would say that from what i'm

2029
01:12:39,360 --> 01:12:43,840
seeing that

2030
01:12:40,320 --> 01:12:46,960
fungi diversity actually does recover

2031
01:12:43,840 --> 01:12:50,000
decently well after

2032
01:12:46,960 --> 01:12:53,199
one one tillage event

2033
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:54,880
that's about all i have for if maybe if

2034
01:12:53,199 --> 01:12:55,440
you could expand on that a little bit

2035
01:12:54,880 --> 01:12:58,719
more

2036
01:12:55,440 --> 01:13:01,199
teal um talking more generally about

2037
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,960
you know as you get an estimate of the

2038
01:13:01,199 --> 01:13:06,159
fungal

2039
01:13:02,960 --> 01:13:09,280
biomass how does like

2040
01:13:06,159 --> 01:13:12,400
general fungal activity differ from amf

2041
01:13:09,280 --> 01:13:15,520
specifically in its function in

2042
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:18,640
the soil um amf

2043
01:13:15,520 --> 01:13:21,360
being a symbiont that we know helps with

2044
01:13:18,640 --> 01:13:24,000
phosphorus acquisition water acquisition

2045
01:13:21,360 --> 01:13:25,199
but more of the function of fungal and

2046
01:13:24,000 --> 01:13:29,600
the fungal activity more

2047
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:33,920
broadly in the the soil community

2048
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:35,520
yeah so the mycorrhizal fungal species

2049
01:13:33,920 --> 01:13:37,679
those are dependent on the plant for

2050
01:13:35,520 --> 01:13:40,880
their carbon so that's the main

2051
01:13:37,679 --> 01:13:42,480
difference is that the fungi in the soil

2052
01:13:40,880 --> 01:13:45,600
they have a different metabolism and

2053
01:13:42,480 --> 01:13:48,960
that they get carbon from breaking down

2054
01:13:45,600 --> 01:13:49,840
organic matter some type of organic

2055
01:13:48,960 --> 01:13:52,880
matter

2056
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:56,400
just like a lot of the bacteria do

2057
01:13:52,880 --> 01:13:58,239
and so the symbiont you can

2058
01:13:56,400 --> 01:14:00,400
measure you know actually something

2059
01:13:58,239 --> 01:14:03,360
that's interesting is mycorrhizal fungi

2060
01:14:00,400 --> 01:14:05,360
our dna is i the techniques i use are

2061
01:14:03,360 --> 01:14:06,560
these dna sequencing techniques to get a

2062
01:14:05,360 --> 01:14:08,800
snapshot of

2063
01:14:06,560 --> 01:14:10,560
everybody in the community and those are

2064
01:14:08,800 --> 01:14:13,679
actually biased against

2065
01:14:10,560 --> 01:14:14,000
the mycorrhizal fungi so i can i do not

2066
01:14:13,679 --> 01:14:16,880
feel

2067
01:14:14,000 --> 01:14:17,600
comfortable looking at my data set and

2068
01:14:16,880 --> 01:14:20,719
saying

2069
01:14:17,600 --> 01:14:22,000
what how mycorrhizae you're doing that

2070
01:14:20,719 --> 01:14:24,080
is the case where you

2071
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:25,120
probably want to go look at the roots

2072
01:14:24,080 --> 01:14:28,400
themselves

2073
01:14:25,120 --> 01:14:31,040
and do it that way which is not

2074
01:14:28,400 --> 01:14:32,560
easy you know it that is a pretty hard

2075
01:14:31,040 --> 01:14:35,679
method to

2076
01:14:32,560 --> 01:14:38,239
do well but just thinking broadly

2077
01:14:35,679 --> 01:14:40,239
the fungi i think of fungi the free

2078
01:14:38,239 --> 01:14:41,840
living fungi in the soil similarly to

2079
01:14:40,239 --> 01:14:43,520
what i do is bacteria they're doing a

2080
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:46,880
lot of the similar

2081
01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:49,600
decomposition functions and

2082
01:14:46,880 --> 01:14:52,880
are competing with bacteria and plants

2083
01:14:49,600 --> 01:14:52,880
for some of those nutrients

2084
01:14:53,040 --> 01:14:56,719
thanks teal and this question maybe it

2085
01:14:56,080 --> 01:14:58,400
relates

2086
01:14:56,719 --> 01:15:00,080
and this could go to any of you with

2087
01:14:58,400 --> 01:15:04,080
respect to enhancing

2088
01:15:00,080 --> 01:15:07,600
soil aggregation through practices but

2089
01:15:04,080 --> 01:15:09,840
the question relates to armoring the

2090
01:15:07,600 --> 01:15:12,320
soil against extreme rainfall events

2091
01:15:09,840 --> 01:15:14,640
obviously more perennials fare better

2092
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:18,480
but what else can we do differently

2093
01:15:14,640 --> 01:15:21,760
in grain systems no takers on that

2094
01:15:18,480 --> 01:15:23,440
well okay so just collecting my thoughts

2095
01:15:21,760 --> 01:15:25,199
here but i'm happy yeah if anyone else

2096
01:15:23,440 --> 01:15:28,159
wants to chime in too but

2097
01:15:25,199 --> 01:15:29,840
i think see this just gives me an

2098
01:15:28,159 --> 01:15:32,480
opportunity to delve into some

2099
01:15:29,840 --> 01:15:33,440
soil science really deep discussion so

2100
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:36,159
the idea of how

2101
01:15:33,440 --> 01:15:37,760
water is held into soils is driven by

2102
01:15:36,159 --> 01:15:39,520
the texture of the soil right we all

2103
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:41,440
know that right sandier soils

2104
01:15:39,520 --> 01:15:43,360
don't hold on to as much but also about

2105
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:45,520
the idea of the aggregation

2106
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,360
and the soil aggregates so soil soil

2107
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:48,480
that has less disturbance over time is

2108
01:15:47,360 --> 01:15:50,719
going to be able to build more

2109
01:15:48,480 --> 01:15:52,400
aggregates and then um and then be able

2110
01:15:50,719 --> 01:15:54,640
to hold on to water

2111
01:15:52,400 --> 01:15:55,920
um between aggregates you know if you

2112
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,480
have these stable aggregates it's going

2113
01:15:55,920 --> 01:16:01,520
to create a better environment so

2114
01:15:58,480 --> 01:16:03,120
so anything you can do um

2115
01:16:01,520 --> 01:16:04,960
you know in grain systems so there's the

2116
01:16:03,120 --> 01:16:07,199
trick to building aggregates is reduce

2117
01:16:04,960 --> 01:16:10,800
disturbance but we also need to

2118
01:16:07,199 --> 01:16:11,600
um bring in more organic matter as well

2119
01:16:10,800 --> 01:16:14,560
to help

2120
01:16:11,600 --> 01:16:16,239
basically be the uh you know to build

2121
01:16:14,560 --> 01:16:17,840
organic matter

2122
01:16:16,239 --> 01:16:20,239
let me phrase i'm going to rephrase it

2123
01:16:17,840 --> 01:16:22,480
the idea of building more organic matter

2124
01:16:20,239 --> 01:16:23,600
that's going to be stable and and stay

2125
01:16:22,480 --> 01:16:24,880
in your soils the idea of

2126
01:16:23,600 --> 01:16:26,719
you're adding carbon to your soil but

2127
01:16:24,880 --> 01:16:27,920
you're keeping it there in that stable

2128
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,239
aggregate form so

2129
01:16:27,920 --> 01:16:32,800
generally speaking building soil organic

2130
01:16:30,239 --> 01:16:34,560
matter connects to that process

2131
01:16:32,800 --> 01:16:36,239
so then in grain systems we've got to

2132
01:16:34,560 --> 01:16:39,280
figure out a way to

2133
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:42,159
get more organic matter inputs

2134
01:16:39,280 --> 01:16:43,520
into our grain systems right so dairy

2135
01:16:42,159 --> 01:16:45,600
systems

2136
01:16:43,520 --> 01:16:46,640
have a little bit of a leg up more root

2137
01:16:45,600 --> 01:16:49,120
biomass from

2138
01:16:46,640 --> 01:16:50,880
perennials we do have manure inputs

2139
01:16:49,120 --> 01:16:51,520
maybe more opportunities for cover crop

2140
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:54,640
use

2141
01:16:51,520 --> 01:16:55,920
if it's if it's corn and soybean focused

2142
01:16:54,640 --> 01:16:58,159
don't we lose a little bit of our

2143
01:16:55,920 --> 01:16:59,920
ability there so um if we have some

2144
01:16:58,159 --> 01:17:00,640
small grains and rotation that gives us

2145
01:16:59,920 --> 01:17:02,800
some

2146
01:17:00,640 --> 01:17:04,400
um that gives us more opportunities to

2147
01:17:02,800 --> 01:17:06,560
get cover crops so it's about thinking

2148
01:17:04,400 --> 01:17:08,159
about your overall system and all their

2149
01:17:06,560 --> 01:17:10,640
their crops they have a rotation how can

2150
01:17:08,159 --> 01:17:13,920
you are there places where you can

2151
01:17:10,640 --> 01:17:17,199
add carbon into your soil through manure

2152
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:18,239
or cover crops really based on your

2153
01:17:17,199 --> 01:17:20,080
cropping system

2154
01:17:18,239 --> 01:17:22,320
it is a great it is a big challenge for

2155
01:17:20,080 --> 01:17:24,719
us in in our organic grain systems

2156
01:17:22,320 --> 01:17:25,840
and that's a great segue for this next

2157
01:17:24,719 --> 01:17:27,679
question

2158
01:17:25,840 --> 01:17:29,360
which i think is a really good question

2159
01:17:27,679 --> 01:17:32,239
to answer in the next 10 minutes or at

2160
01:17:29,360 --> 01:17:34,320
least give some perspective

2161
01:17:32,239 --> 01:17:36,400
which you just mentioned they're matt

2162
01:17:34,320 --> 01:17:38,640
intensifying cover crops and adding

2163
01:17:36,400 --> 01:17:41,440
biomass to the soil

2164
01:17:38,640 --> 01:17:42,159
but generally from this work that

2165
01:17:41,440 --> 01:17:44,880
miranda

2166
01:17:42,159 --> 01:17:45,360
teal described if you had to distill

2167
01:17:44,880 --> 01:17:48,880
down

2168
01:17:45,360 --> 01:17:51,840
some suggestions of how this work

2169
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:54,080
might help inform farmers to make

2170
01:17:51,840 --> 01:17:55,440
decisions with respect to enhancing

2171
01:17:54,080 --> 01:17:58,320
their soil health and

2172
01:17:55,440 --> 01:17:59,800
their soil biological soil health what

2173
01:17:58,320 --> 01:18:03,679
would be some practice

2174
01:17:59,800 --> 01:18:03,679
recommendations that you might make

2175
01:18:08,960 --> 01:18:15,440
uh sir can you repeat that

2176
01:18:12,320 --> 01:18:18,080
so from this work if you were going to

2177
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:20,000
advise farmers what changes and

2178
01:18:18,080 --> 01:18:22,880
practices that they might

2179
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:25,199
implement on their farms to enhance soil

2180
01:18:22,880 --> 01:18:27,040
health and soil biology

2181
01:18:25,199 --> 01:18:28,960
what would you recommend and you had

2182
01:18:27,040 --> 01:18:31,280
mentioned intensifying cover crops and

2183
01:18:28,960 --> 01:18:34,400
adding biomass into the soil but

2184
01:18:31,280 --> 01:18:36,880
suggestions like that

2185
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:38,400
well the the joke i like to make is the

2186
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:40,159
best way to increase your soil health is

2187
01:18:38,400 --> 01:18:42,560
to start a dairy

2188
01:18:40,159 --> 01:18:43,679
all right so um because there you're

2189
01:18:42,560 --> 01:18:44,480
gonna have opportunities to use your

2190
01:18:43,679 --> 01:18:47,920
perennials and

2191
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:49,120
and manures um i i i don't know if i

2192
01:18:47,920 --> 01:18:51,199
have a good

2193
01:18:49,120 --> 01:18:53,360
answer to that question aaron i think

2194
01:18:51,199 --> 01:18:56,080
that we have these

2195
01:18:53,360 --> 01:18:57,679
big shifts you know in inherent soil

2196
01:18:56,080 --> 01:19:00,719
health among

2197
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:04,000
soil types for like a better term

2198
01:19:00,719 --> 01:19:06,719
and we have these shifts between

2199
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:08,880
basically farm operations green annual

2200
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:11,040
grain based operations versus

2201
01:19:08,880 --> 01:19:12,400
uh perhaps animal agriculture-based

2202
01:19:11,040 --> 01:19:14,080
systems that have some level of

2203
01:19:12,400 --> 01:19:18,480
perenniality to them

2204
01:19:14,080 --> 01:19:19,120
um that's not that's not a very good

2205
01:19:18,480 --> 01:19:20,800
answer

2206
01:19:19,120 --> 01:19:22,960
the otherwise it everything then

2207
01:19:20,800 --> 01:19:24,719
devolves into really i think

2208
01:19:22,960 --> 01:19:27,360
i think all of the work that we've

2209
01:19:24,719 --> 01:19:30,800
presented today does support

2210
01:19:27,360 --> 01:19:34,080
these the general push of of reducing

2211
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:35,040
uh reducing soil disturbance and keeping

2212
01:19:34,080 --> 01:19:37,600
the soil covered and

2213
01:19:35,040 --> 01:19:38,320
increasing the carbon inputs into soil

2214
01:19:37,600 --> 01:19:41,040
so

2215
01:19:38,320 --> 01:19:41,679
what does that look like i i don't know

2216
01:19:41,040 --> 01:19:43,440
if there's a

2217
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:45,199
i don't have a general record i don't

2218
01:19:43,440 --> 01:19:46,880
have a general recommendation for that

2219
01:19:45,199 --> 01:19:48,320
you know usually and i would probably

2220
01:19:46,880 --> 01:19:50,640
guess the same thing for miranda and

2221
01:19:48,320 --> 01:19:52,159
teal and even you right when you

2222
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,199
thinking about different farm operations

2223
01:19:52,159 --> 01:19:55,120
and chatting with different people

2224
01:19:53,199 --> 01:19:57,280
everyone has a slightly different

2225
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:58,480
uh approach to management so figuring

2226
01:19:57,280 --> 01:20:01,600
out how it works but

2227
01:19:58,480 --> 01:20:05,360
working within those processes

2228
01:20:01,600 --> 01:20:08,960
working within those i don't know uh

2229
01:20:05,360 --> 01:20:10,560
principles yeah so

2230
01:20:08,960 --> 01:20:12,400
this is not too much different from the

2231
01:20:10,560 --> 01:20:15,360
side five sole health principles right

2232
01:20:12,400 --> 01:20:17,360
so keeping the soil covered adding

2233
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,880
maximizing carbon additions back into

2234
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:21,679
the soil and

2235
01:20:18,880 --> 01:20:22,000
reducing soil disturbance you know and i

2236
01:20:21,679 --> 01:20:24,800
was

2237
01:20:22,000 --> 01:20:26,239
i was yes and so and i was always uh not

2238
01:20:24,800 --> 01:20:27,440
skeptical but because those we

2239
01:20:26,239 --> 01:20:28,880
generally think that's true it's just

2240
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,920
like how are they you know these are

2241
01:20:28,880 --> 01:20:31,600
general things

2242
01:20:29,920 --> 01:20:33,040
how true are they and i guess most of

2243
01:20:31,600 --> 01:20:34,080
this work is really kind of cycle back

2244
01:20:33,040 --> 01:20:35,920
to like yes

2245
01:20:34,080 --> 01:20:37,120
they're they are directionally correct

2246
01:20:35,920 --> 01:20:39,040
they do they

2247
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:41,679
they they're they're uh those are the

2248
01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:44,800
those are the principles and

2249
01:20:41,679 --> 01:20:46,000
um the the work that that then you know

2250
01:20:44,800 --> 01:20:48,000
teal's getting into is like

2251
01:20:46,000 --> 01:20:50,320
all those the beneficials and the more

2252
01:20:48,000 --> 01:20:52,239
detailed work that's really the future

2253
01:20:50,320 --> 01:21:00,719
of how does how to specifically manage

2254
01:20:52,239 --> 01:21:02,400
for some specific things

2255
01:21:00,719 --> 01:21:04,239
i agree with matt about those general

2256
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:06,239
principles i didn't highlight

2257
01:21:04,239 --> 01:21:08,159
um in the management practices i showed

2258
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:09,679
but in our field survey

2259
01:21:08,159 --> 01:21:12,080
we did see like we looked at the number

2260
01:21:09,679 --> 01:21:14,719
of passes from fall to spring

2261
01:21:12,080 --> 01:21:16,320
and then um there was a relationship a

2262
01:21:14,719 --> 01:21:18,320
very very weak relationship again

2263
01:21:16,320 --> 01:21:19,760
because there's so much noise but

2264
01:21:18,320 --> 01:21:21,840
the less tillage you had the less

2265
01:21:19,760 --> 01:21:24,320
tillage passes you had the higher

2266
01:21:21,840 --> 01:21:24,960
your soil protein values were so again

2267
01:21:24,320 --> 01:21:26,400
it's like

2268
01:21:24,960 --> 01:21:28,080
it's really hard to measure these things

2269
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:30,639
but we kind of have this like

2270
01:21:28,080 --> 01:21:31,280
you know common sense idea of like what

2271
01:21:30,639 --> 01:21:32,639
to do

2272
01:21:31,280 --> 01:21:34,800
but it's like how do you implement that

2273
01:21:32,639 --> 01:21:38,400
within your particular operation right

2274
01:21:34,800 --> 01:21:38,400
like you have your own ways

2275
01:21:39,600 --> 01:21:43,120
yeah and so there's a lot of questions

2276
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:45,120
about manure um

2277
01:21:43,120 --> 01:21:47,520
so maybe and that i know you've done a

2278
01:21:45,120 --> 01:21:50,639
lot of work on this on the conventional

2279
01:21:47,520 --> 01:21:51,440
side of things as well but questions

2280
01:21:50,639 --> 01:21:55,199
about

2281
01:21:51,440 --> 01:21:58,400
how liquid manure

2282
01:21:55,199 --> 01:22:02,080
applications might differ from

2283
01:21:58,400 --> 01:22:06,800
um other manure

2284
01:22:02,080 --> 01:22:10,480
via grazing or bedding pack perhaps

2285
01:22:06,800 --> 01:22:12,800
and how if heavy manure could actually

2286
01:22:10,480 --> 01:22:14,560
decrease soil health particularly

2287
01:22:12,800 --> 01:22:17,760
perhaps if that was anaerobic

2288
01:22:14,560 --> 01:22:17,760
liquid manure

2289
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:22,239
well i'm and uh teal miranda i don't

2290
01:22:21,679 --> 01:22:25,040
want to

2291
01:22:22,239 --> 01:22:26,480
uh if you have any thoughts please uh i

2292
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,520
will so here's my thoughts on this and

2293
01:22:26,480 --> 01:22:29,520
that's

2294
01:22:27,520 --> 01:22:31,440
it's about the carbon input so we when

2295
01:22:29,520 --> 01:22:32,960
we apply liquid dairy manure we're not

2296
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:34,880
applying a lot of carbon

2297
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:36,000
as much obviously as when we're applying

2298
01:22:34,880 --> 01:22:37,760
solid manure

2299
01:22:36,000 --> 01:22:39,360
so it really if we could ever like

2300
01:22:37,760 --> 01:22:40,880
balance out that carbon they're equal

2301
01:22:39,360 --> 01:22:42,639
but generally speaking

2302
01:22:40,880 --> 01:22:44,080
liquid dairy manure it's everything's

2303
01:22:42,639 --> 01:22:44,880
been worked over more it's more

2304
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:47,600
available

2305
01:22:44,880 --> 01:22:48,639
it stimulus get that quick stimulation

2306
01:22:47,600 --> 01:22:50,159
um

2307
01:22:48,639 --> 01:22:51,280
but the long-term you know there's still

2308
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:52,719
there's some evidence even with

2309
01:22:51,280 --> 01:22:54,880
long-term use of

2310
01:22:52,719 --> 01:22:56,400
of the slow building so generally

2311
01:22:54,880 --> 01:22:58,400
speaking we tend to think about the

2312
01:22:56,400 --> 01:22:59,360
composted manure the solid manures tend

2313
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:02,800
to have

2314
01:22:59,360 --> 01:23:06,080
um maybe a bigger benefit in terms of

2315
01:23:02,800 --> 01:23:07,840
uh maybe long-term soil health building

2316
01:23:06,080 --> 01:23:10,159
but it might just simply be based on the

2317
01:23:07,840 --> 01:23:11,760
fact that we're adding more carbon to

2318
01:23:10,159 --> 01:23:14,639
the soil with those

2319
01:23:11,760 --> 01:23:16,000
manures so um and it's a slower they

2320
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:18,080
tend to break down a little bit

2321
01:23:16,000 --> 01:23:20,960
a little bit slower compared to liquid

2322
01:23:18,080 --> 01:23:22,719
dairy manure uh in terms of making the

2323
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,360
soil go anaerobic i mean you would have

2324
01:23:22,719 --> 01:23:25,440
to apply

2325
01:23:23,360 --> 01:23:27,199
quite a bit and pack it down pretty

2326
01:23:25,440 --> 01:23:30,639
tight um

2327
01:23:27,199 --> 01:23:31,360
um perhaps uh person asked the question

2328
01:23:30,639 --> 01:23:33,600
as a specific

2329
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:35,440
yeah i think um and i don't know if this

2330
01:23:33,600 --> 01:23:38,320
came up in any of the literature

2331
01:23:35,440 --> 01:23:39,040
review for this work um and maybe this

2332
01:23:38,320 --> 01:23:41,199
is the way i'm

2333
01:23:39,040 --> 01:23:43,199
interpreting it is maybe just the suite

2334
01:23:41,199 --> 01:23:44,320
of microbes that are in an anaerobic

2335
01:23:43,199 --> 01:23:47,760
dairy manure

2336
01:23:44,320 --> 01:23:51,520
versus the microbes that may

2337
01:23:47,760 --> 01:23:55,600
be part of a

2338
01:23:51,520 --> 01:23:55,600
other manure management

2339
01:23:55,840 --> 01:23:59,120
and maybe this goes back to the

2340
01:23:57,120 --> 01:24:00,800
mechanism of why manure benefits it's

2341
01:23:59,120 --> 01:24:02,560
more of the carbon editions than the

2342
01:24:00,800 --> 01:24:04,719
the microbes being applied to the soil

2343
01:24:02,560 --> 01:24:08,800
directly but is there

2344
01:24:04,719 --> 01:24:11,360
a difference there as well

2345
01:24:08,800 --> 01:24:11,920
there's a question related to ph too how

2346
01:24:11,360 --> 01:24:16,800
ph

2347
01:24:11,920 --> 01:24:18,719
might drive soil communities

2348
01:24:16,800 --> 01:24:20,080
yeah i have done quite a bit of

2349
01:24:18,719 --> 01:24:23,920
literature review on

2350
01:24:20,080 --> 01:24:27,199
manure effects on microbial communities

2351
01:24:23,920 --> 01:24:29,440
and soil health and it is one that's

2352
01:24:27,199 --> 01:24:31,520
really interesting it's like

2353
01:24:29,440 --> 01:24:33,199
adding manure is a great resources to

2354
01:24:31,520 --> 01:24:35,040
have to get carbon

2355
01:24:33,199 --> 01:24:36,880
more carbon on your field to feed the

2356
01:24:35,040 --> 01:24:39,199
microbes to build

2357
01:24:36,880 --> 01:24:40,880
soil organic matter that does seem to be

2358
01:24:39,199 --> 01:24:44,960
great what's interesting

2359
01:24:40,880 --> 01:24:47,199
is that in different long-term studies

2360
01:24:44,960 --> 01:24:48,960
that are specifically interested in

2361
01:24:47,199 --> 01:24:52,639
testing the effects of manure

2362
01:24:48,960 --> 01:24:55,280
we see different microbial species

2363
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:56,239
or taxa dominate in these different

2364
01:24:55,280 --> 01:24:59,679
systems that

2365
01:24:56,239 --> 01:25:03,280
are probably more about the soil type

2366
01:24:59,679 --> 01:25:06,159
and the uk experiment versus the wix

2367
01:25:03,280 --> 01:25:06,880
experiment we did but that is one thing

2368
01:25:06,159 --> 01:25:09,679
that

2369
01:25:06,880 --> 01:25:10,239
is is coming out of these data is that

2370
01:25:09,679 --> 01:25:12,480
you have

2371
01:25:10,239 --> 01:25:15,679
even at the the largest scale that we

2372
01:25:12,480 --> 01:25:18,480
can look at the phyla level

2373
01:25:15,679 --> 01:25:20,639
there are pretty big differences in who

2374
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:22,960
is dominating those communities

2375
01:25:20,639 --> 01:25:24,840
so we have a lot of work to do if we're

2376
01:25:22,960 --> 01:25:27,840
going to understand

2377
01:25:24,840 --> 01:25:30,159
um which of those are decomposers of

2378
01:25:27,840 --> 01:25:32,560
which types of materials

2379
01:25:30,159 --> 01:25:34,239
and can is that even is knowing that

2380
01:25:32,560 --> 01:25:36,880
information going to get us

2381
01:25:34,239 --> 01:25:38,000
a little bit further in management

2382
01:25:36,880 --> 01:25:40,719
recommendations

2383
01:25:38,000 --> 01:25:42,560
if it is it's probably going to be small

2384
01:25:40,719 --> 01:25:44,320
and there is a clarification to that too

2385
01:25:42,560 --> 01:25:46,400
which is really helpful in that this is

2386
01:25:44,320 --> 01:25:47,040
actually related to a question that came

2387
01:25:46,400 --> 01:25:48,719
up

2388
01:25:47,040 --> 01:25:50,639
i know that you were answering earlier

2389
01:25:48,719 --> 01:25:52,639
this week on a different topic but

2390
01:25:50,639 --> 01:25:54,719
whether that manure could potentially

2391
01:25:52,639 --> 01:25:55,679
bring in too much nitrogen that would

2392
01:25:54,719 --> 01:25:58,960
actually

2393
01:25:55,679 --> 01:26:02,719
more rapidly cycle c so too much n in

2394
01:25:58,960 --> 01:26:02,719
the manure burning up the carbon

2395
01:26:06,840 --> 01:26:09,840
um

2396
01:26:10,000 --> 01:26:14,719
i i i need to uh think about this for a

2397
01:26:12,239 --> 01:26:14,719
second so

2398
01:26:15,920 --> 01:26:19,120
i only have a long complicated answer

2399
01:26:17,840 --> 01:26:22,159
for that because so

2400
01:26:19,120 --> 01:26:24,000
in general i understand the point right

2401
01:26:22,159 --> 01:26:24,639
if we if we add a lot of nitrogen to

2402
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:26,480
soil

2403
01:26:24,639 --> 01:26:27,920
we stimulate the microbial activity the

2404
01:26:26,480 --> 01:26:31,040
microbes then

2405
01:26:27,920 --> 01:26:32,800
uh stop becoming nitrogen limited

2406
01:26:31,040 --> 01:26:35,679
and then can perform more tasks by

2407
01:26:32,800 --> 01:26:38,800
decomposing more organic matter

2408
01:26:35,679 --> 01:26:40,000
so the so the so the trade-off in our

2409
01:26:38,800 --> 01:26:42,639
agricultural systems

2410
01:26:40,000 --> 01:26:43,360
is we're also so we're applying the the

2411
01:26:42,639 --> 01:26:45,120
nitrogen

2412
01:26:43,360 --> 01:26:47,679
and it and it's feeding the microbes it

2413
01:26:45,120 --> 01:26:48,560
also uh can lead to feeding the plant so

2414
01:26:47,679 --> 01:26:52,800
as long as we're

2415
01:26:48,560 --> 01:26:54,480
getting still a benefit in terms of more

2416
01:26:52,800 --> 01:26:56,320
like in a corn system if you're in if

2417
01:26:54,480 --> 01:26:58,159
you're able to increase yields with your

2418
01:26:56,320 --> 01:27:00,560
input with your nitrogen input

2419
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,360
so you are still returning more carbon

2420
01:27:00,560 --> 01:27:04,000
you could

2421
01:27:01,360 --> 01:27:06,239
it could have a net neutral effect right

2422
01:27:04,000 --> 01:27:07,679
so the the trouble so but the but the

2423
01:27:06,239 --> 01:27:10,320
overall point is interesting right if

2424
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:11,679
we're adding nitrogen without carbon

2425
01:27:10,320 --> 01:27:14,880
um there's a negative effect but

2426
01:27:11,679 --> 01:27:18,080
sometimes we can get that carbon

2427
01:27:14,880 --> 01:27:20,320
through that plant process um and that's

2428
01:27:18,080 --> 01:27:22,159
what we've noticed in in some systems

2429
01:27:20,320 --> 01:27:23,760
uh as long as we're civil to maintain

2430
01:27:22,159 --> 01:27:25,840
that now the the you know i'm

2431
01:27:23,760 --> 01:27:27,280
complimenting you know manure quite a

2432
01:27:25,840 --> 01:27:28,719
bit here in terms of its benefit on the

2433
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:30,320
carbon side but obviously

2434
01:27:28,719 --> 01:27:31,920
i want to acknowledge there are some

2435
01:27:30,320 --> 01:27:33,280
obviously limitations in terms of

2436
01:27:31,920 --> 01:27:34,800
nitrogen and phosphorus and their

2437
01:27:33,280 --> 01:27:36,000
effects on the environment with manure

2438
01:27:34,800 --> 01:27:37,199
that we need to manage so i would be

2439
01:27:36,000 --> 01:27:39,440
more concerned about

2440
01:27:37,199 --> 01:27:41,679
managing for those principles first i

2441
01:27:39,440 --> 01:27:45,280
think we're applying within the realm of

2442
01:27:41,679 --> 01:27:46,320
of proper nutrient needs i think then

2443
01:27:45,280 --> 01:27:49,440
that's

2444
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:50,080
beneficial going beyond that uh is

2445
01:27:49,440 --> 01:27:53,360
probably

2446
01:27:50,080 --> 01:27:54,960
where bad things happen all around

2447
01:27:53,360 --> 01:27:56,800
yeah that's an interesting and

2448
01:27:54,960 --> 01:28:00,480
interesting question

2449
01:27:56,800 --> 01:28:03,600
um there's a question related to if if

2450
01:28:00,480 --> 01:28:07,280
anyone is um uh

2451
01:28:03,600 --> 01:28:10,239
any comments on um

2452
01:28:07,280 --> 01:28:13,280
uh ryze's ryze's why can't i

2453
01:28:10,239 --> 01:28:16,400
say that word rise of

2454
01:28:13,280 --> 01:28:18,239
and how that just i don't i know that

2455
01:28:16,400 --> 01:28:20,719
wasn't tested within the scope of this

2456
01:28:18,239 --> 01:28:21,760
research but any comments in

2457
01:28:20,719 --> 01:28:24,939
general

2458
01:28:21,760 --> 01:28:24,939
[Music]

2459
01:28:26,000 --> 01:28:32,560
all right my work hasn't been um

2460
01:28:29,199 --> 01:28:35,440
at that level of function of

2461
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,320
the metabolisms of different microbes so

2462
01:28:35,440 --> 01:28:39,360
i'm not

2463
01:28:36,320 --> 01:28:41,440
i'm not super familiar on how management

2464
01:28:39,360 --> 01:28:44,880
or anything would affect rhizophy

2465
01:28:41,440 --> 01:28:46,960
or eating of roof

2466
01:28:44,880 --> 01:28:48,000
all right um so we're at the top of the

2467
01:28:46,960 --> 01:28:51,199
hour um

2468
01:28:48,000 --> 01:28:53,520
thank you all for a really

2469
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:55,760
informative presentation on on so many

2470
01:28:53,520 --> 01:28:58,159
different aspects of

2471
01:28:55,760 --> 01:29:00,000
soil biology and soil health and

2472
01:28:58,159 --> 01:29:03,600
particularly as it relates to

2473
01:29:00,000 --> 01:29:06,880
organic grain and dairy systems

2474
01:29:03,600 --> 01:29:10,239
um so with that

2475
01:29:06,880 --> 01:29:10,719
um can i make my final oh yeah of course

2476
01:29:10,239 --> 01:29:12,639
matt

2477
01:29:10,719 --> 01:29:14,159
just as we wrap this up just you know as

2478
01:29:12,639 --> 01:29:16,080
you think about those three circles

2479
01:29:14,159 --> 01:29:18,159
and why soil biology hasn't been

2480
01:29:16,080 --> 01:29:20,639
incorporated i i hopefully this

2481
01:29:18,159 --> 01:29:22,080
you know it's it's it's a huge challenge

2482
01:29:20,639 --> 01:29:24,080
we've done a lot of work

2483
01:29:22,080 --> 01:29:26,080
just to you know and our main results

2484
01:29:24,080 --> 01:29:28,719
are now we feel really comfortable

2485
01:29:26,080 --> 01:29:30,159
that you know this is the this is the

2486
01:29:28,719 --> 01:29:32,560
correct direction

2487
01:29:30,159 --> 01:29:35,040
and then but we still need more work by

2488
01:29:32,560 --> 01:29:37,199
miranda and teal right to get at those

2489
01:29:35,040 --> 01:29:38,480
very specific things and that's going to

2490
01:29:37,199 --> 01:29:39,840
be the grand challenge for a lot of soil

2491
01:29:38,480 --> 01:29:40,239
science research but it's not going to

2492
01:29:39,840 --> 01:29:42,639
come

2493
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:44,400
quickly but we appreciate everyone's

2494
01:29:42,639 --> 01:29:46,800
patience

2495
01:29:44,400 --> 01:29:47,920
it's an exciting area there's a lot that

2496
01:29:46,800 --> 01:29:50,320
we still

2497
01:29:47,920 --> 01:29:53,360
have to learn but it's exciting to see

2498
01:29:50,320 --> 01:30:07,840
this this research coming out and

2499
01:29:53,360 --> 01:30:07,840
appreciate the efforts of all of you

2500
01:30:10,600 --> 01:30:20,320
