2
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,559
good morning and welcome to Wholesome

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,080
roots today I want to tell you a little

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:16,199
bit about how to start a food Forest on

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,840
the cheap the best way to do this is

6
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:23,119
rather than buying big PL fullsize trees

7
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:27,160
and shrubs and plants is to get seeds

8
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:31,160
and cuting from friends it's a very very

9
00:00:27,160 --> 00:00:33,640
easy way to get items for free that you

10
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:35,160
can grow in your own garden I have a

11
00:00:33,640 --> 00:00:37,760
bunch of paaw seeds that I'm going to be

12
00:00:35,160 --> 00:00:40,760
starting today paaw seeds need to be

13
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,399
used fresh and stored in the

14
00:00:40,760 --> 00:00:45,160
refrigerator through the

15
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:46,399
winter after you have harvested them so

16
00:00:45,160 --> 00:00:48,079
when you harvest them out of the fruit

17
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:50,760
you remove all of the fruit off of the

18
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:53,000
seed put them into a Ziploc baggie with

19
00:00:50,760 --> 00:00:56,039
some Pete Moss that's been dampened so

20
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,239
that they stay moist in your fridge so

21
00:00:56,039 --> 00:00:59,160
that they get cold

22
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,680
stratification and are ready to be

23
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,160
planted in the spring

24
00:01:00,680 --> 00:01:05,760
so I'm going to be planting some paaw

25
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:08,520
from fruit that I got from a friend I'm

26
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:11,040
going to be planting some other things

27
00:01:08,520 --> 00:01:13,240
as well that friends have sent me so

28
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,840
basically what I did is I put a post on

29
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:17,439
Facebook I said does anybody have any

30
00:01:14,840 --> 00:01:19,119
seeds or cuting of any fruit trees that

31
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,960
they would be willing to share with me

32
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,159
and I got a huge response and a bunch of

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:26,640
people have sent me some cuting and some

34
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,720
seeds and it didn't cost them anything

35
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:31,119
but postage because these things are

36
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:33,040
free so look around you when you're

37
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,479
driving down the road and you see an Old

38
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,159
Homestead that has fruit trees ask them

39
00:01:35,479 --> 00:01:39,960
about getting cuting that nine times out

40
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:41,880
of 10 they don't even harvest the fruit

41
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:44,520
off of that tree anyway and they'd be

42
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:46,000
glad to let you trim a few branches off

43
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,960
these are just some of the cuting that

44
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:51,360
I've been able to receive when I

45
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:54,320
requested if anybody had any fruit

46
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:56,719
cuting I could get and here we are

47
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,240
starting our own fruit Orchard we're

48
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:02,360
preparing the area for our food Forest

49
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:05,759
right here in our vegetable garden we

50
00:02:02,360 --> 00:02:07,439
decided the best location for our food

51
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,479
was to be as close to everything else

52
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:11,720
that we work with every day one of the

53
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,840
main principles of permaculture is using

54
00:02:11,720 --> 00:02:18,000
what you have and keeping things simple

55
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:21,560
and easy and keeping your zones in the

56
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:23,480
correct order so having our Orchard way

57
00:02:21,560 --> 00:02:25,480
back on the other side of our property

58
00:02:23,480 --> 00:02:28,200
way on the other side where nobody ever

59
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,040
goes was not the best idea when we

60
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,519
originally planted it so we'll be moving

61
00:02:30,040 --> 00:02:35,080
whatever fruit trees have survived the

62
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:36,720
deer damage up into this location with

63
00:02:35,080 --> 00:02:38,920
all of our understory fruit trees

64
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,640
planted underneath them so we're doing

65
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,280
layers we're going to have some tall

66
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:46,319
trees some shrubs and bushes some Vines

67
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:48,840
and some gr ground

68
00:02:46,319 --> 00:02:50,760
cover so that we have a perfect

69
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,879
permaculture Community growing in our

70
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,480
garden now these won't just be fruit

71
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:59,280
trees and bushes we're also going to

72
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,280
have comrey and artichoke and all kinds

73
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,920
of interesting in things growing in that

74
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,959
Community to help keep it healthy and

75
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:07,840
strong and

76
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:10,280
thriving it's important to keep in mind

77
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,280
that every type of fruit has a different

78
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:13,519
set of

79
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,280
circumstances that it likes to grow by

80
00:03:13,519 --> 00:03:17,040
whether it's from a cutting or seed so

81
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,239
make sure you research each one of those

82
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:21,360
fruits that you're planning on starting

83
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,440
from seed or cuting to make sure that

84
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,720
you're taking care of them properly for

85
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:28,680
instance the pawpaw has to be kept wet

86
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,159
and cold for a cold stratification there

87
00:03:28,680 --> 00:03:32,120
are some seeds that are going to need to

88
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:33,519
be soaked beforehand there are some

89
00:03:32,120 --> 00:03:35,959
seeds that are going to need to be

90
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,680
nicked and have their seed coat

91
00:03:35,959 --> 00:03:42,000
Disturbed before you plant them some

92
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:45,040
cuting are easy to take and will do very

93
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:48,080
well for you others have to be grafted

94
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:49,319
onto a root stock so do a little bit of

95
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,640
research about the plants that you're

96
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:54,200
looking at starting before you begin to

97
00:03:51,640 --> 00:03:57,159
make sure that you get even more success

98
00:03:54,200 --> 00:04:00,200
in your garden I also got some free Paw

99
00:03:57,159 --> 00:04:03,120
Paw seeds from Kentucky State University

100
00:04:00,200 --> 00:04:06,159
anybody can get free seeds from the

101
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:08,959
University as they have them available

102
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:11,040
so I will leave a link down below for

103
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,400
more information on that so you can get

104
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:16,440
your free paaw seeds to start your own

105
00:04:13,400 --> 00:04:20,720
paaw Grove all right so I

106
00:04:16,440 --> 00:04:22,759
have almost completely filled my tray

107
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:25,479
this is a deep root always want to do

108
00:04:22,759 --> 00:04:27,199
deep root pots especially for paaw

109
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:29,720
because they have a tap route I have

110
00:04:27,199 --> 00:04:32,000
then poked holes with my fingers to make

111
00:04:29,720 --> 00:04:35,520
make it deeper paaw seeds like to be

112
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:37,280
planted at least 3 in deep so I've

113
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:39,919
soaked them in some water just to get

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,919
them started this morning and I'm just

115
00:04:39,919 --> 00:04:44,240
going to go ahead and put a seed in each

116
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:46,320
one of these

117
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:49,320
cells and hope that they're all going to

118
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,320
workow

119
00:04:49,400 --> 00:05:08,000
[Music]

120
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,840
I'm actually going to go ahead and

121
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:21,280
double the seeds because I don't need

122
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:24,400
this many paw paws and um some of them

123
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,400
kind of have some spots on them that I'm

124
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,840
curious if they may be a little bit

125
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:32,199
damaged so I'm going to go ahead

126
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:35,240
and double seed what I have left in this

127
00:05:32,199 --> 00:05:38,680
bag so that I'll have a fresh tray to

128
00:05:35,240 --> 00:05:38,680
plant my Kentucky seeds

129
00:05:39,080 --> 00:05:46,400
in any extra paaw plants that I will not

130
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:50,639
be planting here I can share with fellow

131
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:52,680
gardeners in my area and make sure that

132
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,759
you always remember that if you start a

133
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:59,440
little bit extra you can help spread the

134
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,360
gardening movement with other gardeners

135
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:05,400
by sharing your extra plants that's

136
00:06:02,360 --> 00:06:07,599
something I really stress and try to do

137
00:06:05,400 --> 00:06:10,319
as much as possible I've had so many

138
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:14,520
people share their plants with me and I

139
00:06:10,319 --> 00:06:17,319
try to pay it forward by sharing plants

140
00:06:14,520 --> 00:06:19,919
with other gardeners in my area some of

141
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:22,110
these could possibly even be shipped if

142
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,599
I am really

143
00:06:22,110 --> 00:06:26,400
[Applause]

144
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:27,800
careful so that almost doubled the

145
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:30,880
entire seed

146
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:33,599
tray actually I think it's going to just

147
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:35,479
about only going to be shy a few cells

148
00:06:33,599 --> 00:06:39,000
so that's going to

149
00:06:35,479 --> 00:06:41,160
be good to go I'm going to cover fill

150
00:06:39,000 --> 00:06:43,360
the cells the rest of the way up water

151
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:47,000
it in and I'm going to put it

152
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:49,440
outside it is good for paaw seeds to be

153
00:06:47,000 --> 00:06:52,160
in the cold and they will germinate as

154
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:54,240
the temperatures warm up and they can

155
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:56,780
take a while to germinate so I'll just

156
00:06:54,240 --> 00:07:00,170
have to be patient

157
00:06:56,780 --> 00:07:00,170

164
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:31,800
just got to get some rain water with

165
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:33,759
collected to water them in and we're

166
00:07:31,800 --> 00:07:36,199
good to go I'm just going to leave them

167
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:39,639
and let the mother nature take care of

168
00:07:36,199 --> 00:07:39,639
them from here

[Music]

171
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:08,879
all right so I've got my warm

172
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:11,360
temperature things that I am planting in

173
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:13,479
this tray so I've got some goji berry

174
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:16,360
from a friend some meringer from a seed

175
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:18,680
Swap and some hearty orange that I got

176
00:08:16,360 --> 00:08:21,000
from Baker Creek and I just opened it up

177
00:08:18,680 --> 00:08:23,080
and look they're already sprouting so

178
00:08:21,000 --> 00:08:25,240
I'm going to have to be very careful

179
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:28,000
with those so I don't break off any of

180
00:08:25,240 --> 00:08:33,120
those little tiny

181
00:08:28,000 --> 00:08:34,719
babies so here we are with all of our

182
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:38,599
seeds

183
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:41,959
sewn watered in all of our cuting

184
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:46,279
growing this is how you start a food

185
00:08:41,959 --> 00:08:49,480
Forest I have a big huge thank you to

186
00:08:46,279 --> 00:08:52,959
the friends that have sent us seeds and

187
00:08:49,480 --> 00:08:56,000
cuting and allowed us to get this

188
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:57,880
started and I will be sharing seeds and

189
00:08:56,000 --> 00:09:00,000
cuting in the future with more and more

190
00:08:57,880 --> 00:09:04,320
people I hope that this is inspired you

191
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:07,440
to start your own food Forest using free

192
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:10,120
things that you can get from Friends

193
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:12,640
neighbors I mean really anywhere you

194
00:09:10,120 --> 00:09:14,480
could even post on Facebook in some of

195
00:09:12,640 --> 00:09:15,839
the marketplaces and there's lots of

196
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
people who are willing to give away

197
00:09:15,839 --> 00:09:21,440
these things for free so don't stop

198
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:23,519
