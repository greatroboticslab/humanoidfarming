  "text": "anyway I'm going to talk about uh some of the capturing and the utilization of the nutrients and I'm going to talk about it a lot from the standpoint of people that have moved from open feed lots to these types of facilities some of the things that are different some of the considerations that you need to make that are are going to make things some of the big differences um with an open feed lot you can uh do chores probably once every six months as far as scraping and cleaning out the barns or cleaning out the pens and so forth it needs to be very timely in these barns um so it becomes part of weekly chores uh also you are in close proximity with the c um when you're moving moving in there with equipment and I take it nobody wants to scrape these barns by hand right okay you're going to be in there with the cattle um different cattle are going to behave differently but often times they become more and more accustomed to the uh tractors the equipment in there and there's a tendency to bump them especially late late in the uh feeding period when you've got all the money and so forth in and uh you got to be very very careful and think about what you're doing think about the way you design these so that you can clean out the manure on a regular basis and not injure the cattle especially when they're ready to go on the truck tomorrow as far as the nutrients that are out there I guess I'm going to think about them in terms of where they're coming from and we have the two different types we've got the the part that's coming out of the urine um which is going to be mostly all our potassium very soluble in the open lots a lot of times that is lost through run off that comes off the top we're going to be able to cap capture that it does attach quickly to exchange sight so some of the soil and so forth under an open lot will have it otherwise we're going to be capturing that with our bedding ammonia and we've done the study it can but volatilize and often times if you're losing very much ammonia from just your standpoint you can smell if you can smell it a lot that probably means that we've got it leaving it also will attach to the exchange sites on things um cattle produce a lot of species or the organic matter that Parts probably always or very often going to be all captured in our uh facilities that's the part that takes some additional breakdown in order for our plants to use it and it actually contains lots of exchange sites and so if you've got a a piece of property that you've applied manure on year after year often times you'll you'll see that it's able to retain more it has a higher organic matter in it that's because that's where it came from we take a look at at how much the animals produce versus how much we're able to capture in the different systems um reason why in the beded barns we're probably going to be adding around a baale 1,00 to 1200 lb of additional material out there to soak up that urine uh keep things dry and that's why we have a a higher amount here in terms of the capture versus the open lot uh on a a deep pit um we put things down here and this is I get a lot of people asking me when they've done some manure analysis why do you have so much more captured from a deep pit and it's really just a matter of how we Mar measure it okay this is measured in pound per th000 gallons there is in 1,000 gallons there are 4 tons of material so these are actually going to be roughly speaking four times as great as this because of the difference in the way that we're actually measuring when people are building um livestock facilities for cattle um one of the thing salesman often talk about the cost per head space on their facilities yes I'd like you to take a look at it in terms of cost per square foot so that you can evaluate all of these on I'll say the same basis is and also when we move cattle into facilities the facilities are relatively speaking expensive and so we squeeze more animals into less space um we're normally down in in the lower end of this I'll say at least uh uh 40 square ft per head at 40 square ft per head the amount of urine that you get on a daily basis is a/4 inch okay that's with little C that is as much as we get in terms of evaporation on the warm day so a lot of times we're going to have them in here dense enough that you're going to keep everything wet I put this into the paper and it's also up here at the various stocking densities how much depth of a manure do you get in a week and think then about how free frequently you're going to scrape and get that cleaned up okay and over time U that I've been with Iowa State University extension service we move from finished cattle that were 900 to 1,000 head now I I see 14500 lb cattle routinely being that big before they're going to Market when they're that big they produce a lot more manure we've done some things in terms of feeding so that we can still put on muscle on those uh big animals but they're eating a lot of feed they're gaining a lot of weight and they're producing a lot of manure if they're in tight tight uh positions we're looking at a lot of manure being produced at large cattle we're looking at over 5 in per week okay and if you have a cleaning schedule that's on here the difference between The Big C cattle and the little cattle and at the end of the feeding period you need to be on it on on your schedule or adjust your schedule so you you can be on it because being one or two days late is the difference between having cattle that clean and nice and are able to keep their hair coat and those that aren't this is uh why we use the bedding help soak up the manure keep the cattle clean okay change the uh manure from a semi or slurry into a semisolid that we're able to handle something that's at least uh 80% water that sounds like a lot right 20% solids 80% water that will stand up nicely in a manure sprad okay if it gets higher than that it runs out the back gate um what are the cons considerations of course betting has cost involved with it and it's gotten higher over time and especially in years when you have a late wet season when you need betting the most it's going to be the hardest to make and if you can't make it nobody else did and it's going to be very expensive so just put that on your your thing every time you handle it it costs more money storing it costs some money and of course processing helps to improve the surface area so you can soak that stuff the urine up quickly but of course that costs more money uh where do you want to store it uh of course you want to often times have it very close to the bar um and you'd like to keep it high and dry so that you have as Le the least amount of sto spoilage as possible and here we've got it high and dry now uh with uh with these if you are slow and late or also I'll say you you got to make sure that you evaluate how good the quality is of the beding especially late in the year when we've had some de decomposition of it you might need to add a few Bales so we don't end up with a with a cattle that have lost their hair coat they lose the hair coat and they're also going to have to use more of their the feed to control their body temperature especially when it gets cold Bing is going to change with the season and uh with cattle at least a lot of the individuals I'm working with we're feeding uh Cals Cavs in the fall maybe yearlings uh to get another turn through there uh when we bring them in in the fall dealing with the smaller cabs probably start them out on a a little bit uh less hot diet in terms of nutrients and so forth um it's normally dry um the betting is the highest quality we're going to have each year so that we're probably going to start out with using utilizing the least amount at that time as winter goes on hopefully the Cals are growing the quality of bending still good we will have the the occasional snow storms that come through and big openings on our buildings will allow U some of that to come in need to adjust and in increase the amount of bedding when that happens uh spring we're dealing now with bigger cattle normally if we have some uh rain or so forth the bedding is going to be wet so part of its usefulness has already been used up we have that thaw period and high humidity so we're not going to get the the evaporation and we do get the frequent rains so again we're going to have to adjust our Bing upward now uh the last one is Summer and I put this on here for the people that have changed from a open feed lot to a beded barn they tell me that the biggest thing that was a aha moment in in terms of it is you use more bedding in the summer than you did the fall and winter which is the exact opposite if you beded in an open lot you beded during the winter but you never did anything during the summer with these facilities to keep things moving one you've got great big cattle you've got hot conditions the cattle are drinking more some of the uh feed ingredients we have may contain some additional sodium some additional things that cause the animals to drink more more drinking is going to produce more urine needs to be soaked up and often at the very end of the feeding period we're dealing with deterior deteriorated bedding it's pretty much used up so they'll often times use 50% more bedding in the summer than they do in the winter and did not expect that to be um when they started out with the facility uh deep pits um they're going to be under the the slots um when you look at back to where we were in terms of how much manure you're producing if you have a 8 to 10t pit you're going to have to pump that out twice a year in order to have the storage that you need to keep the cattle in there uh and I don't see anybody that's putting in a deep enough pit to make it through one year so you're going to plan on doing that it will tend to be more consistent and you're going to be able to capture that and put that through when you think about building the building with something that you're going to be in there at least weekly probably bi-weekly to uh clean okay and often times with the cattle in there we need to make sure that we've got curbs so we can scrape along the edges make it easy to get done uh push walls for loading up that manure maybe where we're going to place our Manure Spreader so we can put that all together um and then also maybe some extra mirrors on the thing so you can monitor where that cattle are often times we move moving forward slamming the uh tractor into reverse after we've load it up a load and often times We're Not Looking Back where those cattle as they especially get accustomed to the equipment might be very very close to you and end up bumping them uh here's a push wall um and I when I talk about push walls this is going to be a reinforced concrete wall that you can push the loader into it and not worry about breaking anything okay and when you think about uh the equipment that you're going to use for uh for building since these buildings are going to last what 30 40 years look at the equipment that you would like to own not the equipment that you now have cuz it how many of you guys want to buy a small smaller Tractor No Hands oh there's a couple hands somebody wants one anyway so make sure you you reinforce it so that you you won't have the problems and think about the individual you might hire that doesn't have any experience with the tractor that might hit the the top of the push wall uh when he slips the his foot off the clutch uh here's here is a nice curb along this Edge and you will be moving back and forth along there and think about especially when you get down into the really tight ones where there's enough room for the cattle to get back away from it Angie if you guys want to know how big that is Angie right there is our as our marker um as far as storage inside the building versus out inside the building of course it's going to be expensive but it's very convenient um to have some storage inside the building we're probably not going to put it very much there but uh having a couple weeks is uh nice uh it's under roof it's also going to be in a place where you're going to capture everything um can also put it just outside nice uh push walls here also can contain it makes it convenient so you can get the job done even when the weather conditions are poor outside and you need to have be able to do this in all weather conditions with bars okay if we move that off site and uh often times we'll have both but move it away from the barn uh to the field where it's going to be utilized uh it is a second place to manage uh and may be regulations and Community standards and I'll just say I get calls each year somebody says they don't want to smell it next to their house so they moved it out to the field where I'm at um and even if it doesn't quote unquote breed flies it will attract flies and all I say is don't put it in front of the person's house and we've had that happen before but it does help it normally the uh Fields adjacent to our facilities have high nutrient contents those fields that are out a long ways away could really use the p and the K that we are able to capture from um managing it make sure that we're not losing it to the ground uh keep it high and dry um do not stockpile it and grab Waterway and minimize the time that it's out there where we can have losses",
