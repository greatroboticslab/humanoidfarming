  "text": "okay i wanted to provide an update for the strawberry varieties for the state strawberry is probably the the second most popular crop in the state uh second to peaches but uh and there has been increased interest in production of strawberries but for a variety of reasons um we've there's been some a bit of uh hesitancy amongst the growers for one it's cited as being too difficult or expensive and uh you know in having made all of the investment uh there still may not uh be the production of a of a of a uh crop in order to make a profit so as we know the most the the best way to ensure a viable crop is to plant just to plant the varieties that are well adapted first of all to use crops that are well adapted and varieties or cultivars within that crop that are well adapted to the area so there's there's great need in technological advancements and variety selection variety development be that strawberry or regards of the crop that you're growing and there are few with document with the documented adaptability to our area camaros is the big variety that we have is it has global adaptability um but uh but there are it does have its issues there is just a need for other varieties and um varieties are the most one of the most important decisions that you're going to make in variety in crop production so the objective of this study and all of our variety trials is to improve strawberry production by introducing new better adapted strawberry varieties to improve the especially crop market in the state and i want to start off by providing a list of the varieties we looked at 12 varieties this trial has been going on um for about five years not not with all of the same varieties here but we have our albion which is a day neutrals only day neutral in the trial this year again camarosa developed by uc davis and our and camino real which is a variety that growers are becoming familiar with this year because camarosa wasn't available camarosa is our market standard uh it wasn't uh is available this year so many growers had to uh depend on camino real and um i will talk about how it's done in chandler our other variety our other our former market standard and you can see some of the others uh one i wanted to mention rocco and liz those are two that were developed by nc state um great uh glad to have those in again this year uh just to give you an idea of what we did we experimental plots that we had they were all replicated four times and uh each experimental experimental plot was about 20 feet long and that contained about 34 plants per plot which resulted in a in a per acre plant number of about over 12 000 and we planted these on the 23rd of october and of last year and planted on double staggered rose and again 23 12 000 plants per acre randomized complete block design you can see our our double staggered row uh hole puncher hole punching wheel there they also as the holes are being punched into the plastic there's also some water with a little bit of fertilizer entering the planting hole as well we harvested this year we harvested between april 7th and may 18th we harvested 12 times we did use row covers back prior to the event our freeze event in february 15th and those covers remained on the strawberries for about two weeks and uh this is you here are results uh this is looking at the total marketable yield uh per acre for our our strawberries and as you can see uh camarosa as we would expect is still up towards the top but we have a new variety at least new to us fronteras it's a variety that was produced by uc davis and it was did pretty well this year and i i would like to be able to include in our trials next year and again our camp camino real the variety that a number of our growers had to depend on this year uh did did quite well it was very comparable to camarosa as in previous years but we look at the rocco the rock the yield of rocco is it's it's a little bit diminished when compared to the others but rocco was bred to be an early variety and it is uh uh it was meant to be a replacement for sweet charlie and uh it it it does uh does quite well it it has the the production of something that's on par with camarosa for that time of the season and another important variable we looked at is the uh individual berry weight as you can see fronteras again it was the number one yielder and uh fronteras was the largest berry uh the mean size of the berry was at 20 little over 27 almost 27 and a half grams per berry and uh that's a that's a pretty large berry and that's not the largest berry of course we had some large it ranged from a little bit over uh 30 grams uh maybe 33 grams i think some of the larger berries that we saw there and then we can we notice our our market standard camarosa at 21.5 grams now followed by camino real at 19.8 on roughly almost 20 grams for fruit and i was a little bit uh a little bit surprised that uh camino real came in at that uh at that size because early on it looked it appeared that camino real was producing some pretty large berries consistently so but the the data doesn't lie so there you have it um but uh out of all of those varieties what i wanted to do is focus on on our overall top performers and that's again our market standard camino camarosa and camino real which is gaining in popularity and fronteras and i didn't mention ruby june that's another variety that a lot of growers uh are are interested in uh it's been my opinion that uh you know a number of the growers either love ruby june or or hate it and but i think it is growing in popularity uh i don't have it pictured here but we'll discuss that after and just wanted to have this graph here really just to show you uh what happened during the season and uh you know where were these yields you know in um according to the weeks of harvest and so you can see we had a or at least we were it appeared that we were coming off of a peak uh uh at the our first harvest april 7th um and we and it's really odd this year because we had a we had a really big start and we never really recovered in our trials uh we did have a peak another peak as you can see uh we so after that harvest we had a uh just a really pretty significant decline and all of the varieties perform that trended that way and you can see the um the dotted line here is our average average yield for across all berries and um camino real and the gray and i hope you can see these these these colors here these lines but and fronteras and uh camino ria camarosa you can see camarosa appears to be a little bit earlier than fronteras and uh and it's comparable to fronteras in marketable yield and again camille riyal it is more similar i i'd suppose to camerosa in terms of of earliness and i also wanted to take a look at what was going on during the week as we as is pretty common or pretty typical is that we start off with some big berries and as the season progresses we the berries start to tend uh towards the smaller berries and that's because we when we start our primary flowers when we begin those are larger flowers and so larger flowers typically mean a larger berry and we can see that the berries started off here and we did actually see somewhat of a peak in the berry size but it did again it did start to trend down to smaller berries as we as we approach the end of our our harvests so i wanted to focus on specific varieties and this is fronteras it produces really large berries conical shaped berries uh the largest berry that we had as i mentioned was about 32 grams uh the the uh the maturity is a little bit later than camarosa the plant size in in terms of the plant the plant is similar in size to camarosa uh the camarosa does have a it's a large plant and the berries the berries sort of had a uh almost for lack of a better word that the the the color of the redness was almost it tended to be a little bit fluorescent red it was uh just a kind of an extra brilliant red it can't really it wasn't really captured in this picture right here uh but we you really see it in the uh you really see it in the field uh it is a sweet berries it was a pretty pleasant berry pretty taste a pretty pleasant tasting berry uh it had a little bit of tartness now moving on to camino riyal the variety that the growers had to depend on this year uh and the uh out of all the growers i think one was not completely satisfied with camino real i've heard after that other than that i've heard nothing but good things about the variety it is a large it produces a large berry typically and that kind of probably seems to suggest to me that uh what we were seeing in the field and the numbers that we're actually getting for the berry size uh that may suggest that we have quite a bit of variability in the in the and the very individual berry size uh but so as i mentioned it really seems to in the field that really seemed to produce some fairly large berries consistently and it is a berry that is similar camarosa and uh you know it was favorable to most growers and it has a pretty a fairly pleasant taste one of the the downsides of this berry is that uh and the growers really didn't point this out that they they were quite pleased with it but it has a reputation for not being quite as flavorful not being quite as sweet as some of the others but we found that you can improve uh that if the berries are are harvested when they're uh really red but uh you know this is it's not very pretty not a simple thing to do really when you're in the field especially in a you pick operation uh when customers are you know they're finding red berries and they and they picked them but if this berry is left on the plant a little bit longer you can improve on the sweetness and the flavor of the berry uh that brings us to camarosa it had a maximum berry size of a 22 and a half uh it was the top yielder again this year and it has a pretty an excellent flavor it's if you can match it there are some in the trials that have surpassed i think camarosa in flavor but it does have an excellent flavor and it is a excellent yielder a fairly consistent yielder it's usually in the tops every year and that's that's why it's the market standard and the the added variety i wanted to talk about was ruby june it was a variety of much discussion early on as i said at least early on a lot of the growers they either loved it or they hated it we think that there's probably something to do with uh fertility so varieties vary in terms of of their nutrient uh requirements particularly nitrogen and so these might be a higher feeder or it may not require as much nitrogen under but there there is developing information out there on varieties and their um their nutrient requirements this is a variety bred by lesson canyon and this is uh i mean it is i i think it's a fairly good variety it is slightly earlier than camaros in our trials and one thing about this berries uh the plant at least it's a medium-sized plant but the it has a tendency to produce these really large fan type leaves and that's one of the things that sort of stuck out to me the berry is a very good tasting variety it was i found it to be very sweet a very flavorful berry and some of the growers expressed the same the same things in terms of the quality of ruby june oops so well that brings us to the end of the presentation and if you have any questions i'd be happy to entertain them you",
