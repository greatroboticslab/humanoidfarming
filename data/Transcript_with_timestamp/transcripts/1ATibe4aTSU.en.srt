00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:08,240
hi

3
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,760
everyone it's nona grace and i'm from

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,719
western new york

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:13,679
today i'm going to talk about how to

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:16,480
introduce

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,119
a new hand to the hen house i had a

8
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:20,960
comment

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:24,160
that i think it was made by trisha

10
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,240
from becoming me i'll put her link in

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,320
and she i guess she's got a couple new

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:30,320
ones that she'd like to add but doesn't

13
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:33,040
know exactly how you should do it

14
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,239
well when i got dorothy i don't know if

15
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,840
you remember way back

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:37,600
when those of you that have been with me

17
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:39,440
for a while and when i got dorothy and

18
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,160
her seven babies

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,520
i had to introduce her to the hen house

20
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,280
the easiest way

21
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,879
i find to introduce a new hen or any hen

22
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:51,840
to the hen house

23
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,280
is to put them in a dog crate one of the

24
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,719
large dog crates

25
00:00:53,280 --> 00:01:00,000
it's a wire crate and you put that

26
00:00:56,719 --> 00:01:00,879
in i put that right in with the chicken

27
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:03,199
run

28
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,799
so that all the chickens can see and

29
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:07,280
when they're first put in there

30
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:08,320
everybody's paying a lot of attention to

31
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,520
that hen

32
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:12,479
in fact they will try to try to get the

33
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,920
hen

34
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:18,479
and fight with it or pack it

35
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:21,119
but because there's the dog wires in

36
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,159
between they can't get to the hen

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:28,240
or to the new chicken that's being added

38
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:28,799
so after a while they kind of like oh

39
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,119
well

40
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,200
that's that's just her she's in there

41
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:33,600
and they lose interest in her when they

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
lose

43
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,320
interest which takes about three days

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,840
usually

45
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:44,799
then you can open the door and let the

46
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,960
um hand that's inside out if she wishes

47
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:49,680
to come out i just open the door and let

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,799
her decide when she wants to come out

49
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,360
and she will come out

50
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:56,240
or if you find that you don't want to do

51
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:59,600
that my brother has suggested that you

52
00:01:56,240 --> 00:02:02,240
put the hen in the hen house

53
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:03,600
in the dark because when they wake up

54
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:05,520
they'll go oh

55
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,040
were you here all the while i don't

56
00:02:05,520 --> 00:02:08,640
remember you but

57
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,239
they'll they'll pay no attention to it

58
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:11,760
because they'll think that that hen has

59
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:13,040
always been there just they've never

60
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,319
noticed

61
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:18,000
but i think they would notice i really

62
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,280
do so i always put them in the little

63
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:22,400
dog carrier

64
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:25,360
or a dog crate it's a wire cage

65
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:25,840
and this way they can't get to them and

66
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,440
when i

67
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:32,319
introduced little lady i pretty much

68
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,440
had her out there she had the fence

69
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,840
between her like

70
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:37,280
like mr brown has been doing he goes out

71
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,519
and they see him

72
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:41,040
but there's some hens that come out of

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,400
the

74
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,200
enclosed area in the in the fenced-in

75
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,200
area they've

76
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:51,280
found a way to come out and they have

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:53,200
mingled with him a little bit or her a

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:54,879
little bit

79
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,120
when they first started doing it they

80
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,519
would peck mr brown

81
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,560
but this last time they didn't pack at

82
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:03,680
him

83
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:06,319
they just ate right next to like they

84
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,440
pretended that they didn't even see her

85
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:11,840
and they were um actually doing

86
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,959
quite well when he went over by the

87
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:14,959
fence

88
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:16,800
there was a different hen that was i

89
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,239
think it was dorothy that came over

90
00:03:16,800 --> 00:03:22,640
and another white hen came over and

91
00:03:20,239 --> 00:03:25,040
he did a stare for a little bit and she

92
00:03:22,640 --> 00:03:26,799
did a little bit of staring at him

93
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,040
and then he went about his eating and

94
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:31,760
she kind of left him alone

95
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,760
so they're getting used to each other i

96
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,280
did get a question to whether i was

97
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:38,480
going to put mr brown

98
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:39,360
in with the hens and because i'm going

99
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:42,319
on vacation

100
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,440
in june i will have to put mr brown in

101
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,959
with the hens so

102
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,360
he'll be outside so that they can see

103
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,000
him

104
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,720
often and this way when i do put him in

105
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
he will be

106
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,159
safe and if i have to i can always put

107
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,519
him in a dog

108
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:59,040
crate just to make sure that he'll be

109
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,360
all right

110
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:03,040
and that's how you introduce and i have

111
00:04:01,360 --> 00:04:07,040
a message for doyle

112
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:10,080
doyle i know it doyle had made a comment

113
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:12,159
about the water thing

114
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:13,120
when i said you drink your half half of

115
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:16,479
your weight in

116
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:19,600
water it's ounces not pounds

117
00:04:16,479 --> 00:04:21,600
or gallons or whatever

118
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,040
that was funny because he was saying

119
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,560
something but he'd have to drink 10

120
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:28,160
gallons of water

121
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:30,320
no no no no no if it's your half your

122
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:34,960
body weight like if you weigh

123
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:38,639
in and ounces if you weighed 200 pounds

124
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:39,680
you would drink 100 ounces of water if

125
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,800
you were

126
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,759
one or if you're

127
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,240
one fifty fifty years you drink seventy

128
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,000
five

129
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:54,080
pounds ounces and not pounds and not

130
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:56,639
gallons so and i did pretty good today i

131
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:59,919
drank all of mine i think i've got about

132
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,919
um eight more ounces to go and then i

133
00:04:59,919 --> 00:05:04,080
will have mine completed and the

134
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,680
day i still have a few hours left before

135
00:05:04,080 --> 00:05:08,479
i go to bed

136
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:09,360
so that's what i wanted to say and i

137
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,960
hope

138
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,039
that if you want to introduce your

139
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:16,240
chickens to the hen house

140
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:18,080
that you find it easy going

141
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:25,840
and i will talk to you all again

142
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:25,840
