balcony Garden Oasis here are five tips

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:11,080
to help you successfully care for plants

4
00:00:06,879 --> 00:00:11,080
in containers growing

5
00:00:12,440 --> 00:00:16,720
Joy hi plant friends I'm Maria your new

6
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:18,680
best plant friend and I'm here to help

7
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,840
you care for plant successfully but most

8
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:22,600
importantly grow Joy while doing so and

9
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:24,880
there is nothing more joyful than

10
00:00:22,600 --> 00:00:28,800
sitting on your balcony with a mocktail

11
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:31,439
or a cocktail at dusk enjoying scented

12
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:33,280
herbs blow in the wind maybe some cut

13
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,360
flowers I've been balcony gardening for

14
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,760
the last four or five years the first

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,440
balcony I gardened on was 9 Square ft in

16
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:42,920
New York City it was basically this big

17
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:45,039
now I am lucky enough to have this epic

18
00:00:42,920 --> 00:00:48,120
balcony that's about 150 square feet

19
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:50,399
that I grow most of my fruits and

20
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:52,559
vegetables over the summer I have

21
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,920
learned a lot in these four years so I

22
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,600
wanted to go over my top five tips to

23
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,480
help you have a successful first year or

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
maybe second year gardening tip number

25
00:00:59,480 --> 00:01:03,079
one is going to be to utilize your

26
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:05,280
vertical space a lot of balconies you

27
00:01:03,079 --> 00:01:07,680
really don't have that much space right

28
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:10,000
so use every inch that you have as you

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,960
see I'm using my balcony railing in two

30
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,280
different ways I have these hanging

31
00:01:11,960 --> 00:01:17,520
planters that I'm planting on and I also

32
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,439
am actually using it as a trellis so I

33
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:21,360
have little cucumbers here that will

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:23,520
grow and start trellising across the

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,799
balcony also if you don't have a balcony

36
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:27,920
railing that is slatted like this that

37
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:30,040
you can actually use as a trellis make

38
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,880
sure that you use trellises so I'm

39
00:01:30,040 --> 00:01:33,920
planting way more food in this one

40
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:35,960
container because I have a trellis that

41
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,880
the center plant is going to grow up

42
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:39,479
then I can utilize the side space so it

43
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:41,920
doesn't like Bush out and it actually

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,960
grows up and you just can get more bang

45
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,240
for your buck out of one container tip

46
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:46,960
number two if you're growing in

47
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:48,880
containers they're going to dry out

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,719
faster so you need to understand how

49
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:52,320
you're going to sustainably water all of

50
00:01:50,719 --> 00:01:54,320
your plants throughout your summer when

51
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,640
you have travel involved right who

52
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:57,600
doesn't have a million weddings to

53
00:01:55,640 --> 00:01:59,479
attend this summer so you can do that in

54
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:01,640
a couple of different ways if you you

55
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:03,200
could either do self-watering Planters

56
00:02:01,640 --> 00:02:05,000
these are self-watering Planters they

57
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,439
have a watering Reservoir you fill them

58
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:09,039
up with a hose and then these can go

59
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,679
like one or two weeks without having to

60
00:02:09,039 --> 00:02:12,640
water the plants over and over and over

61
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,239
again it's great for if you travel if

62
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,440
you're not going to do that here's a

63
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,800
watering hack that I do when I water my

64
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:20,519
grow bags grow bags particularly are

65
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,440
amazing for container gardening but they

66
00:02:20,519 --> 00:02:25,640
do dry out faster than any other

67
00:02:22,440 --> 00:02:27,920
container out there have two watering

68
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:29,959
cans usually if you have more than one

69
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:31,560
container it's helpful to have one

70
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:33,560
watering can that you're watering in

71
00:02:31,560 --> 00:02:35,640
this will fill up in the sink as you're

72
00:02:33,560 --> 00:02:38,280
watering and then you can swap it out

73
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,200
it'll just make watering less time

74
00:02:38,280 --> 00:02:41,920
consuming if you have two also these

75
00:02:40,200 --> 00:02:43,560
aren't fancy watering cans I literally

76
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,000
bought this at the dollar store a couple

77
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:48,080
of days ago tip number three intensive

78
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,840
plant if you want to grow a kitchen herb

79
00:02:48,080 --> 00:02:52,080
garden on your balcony a lot of people

80
00:02:49,840 --> 00:02:53,480
that's the Gateway into gardening you

81
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,000
have a little balcony with a little bit

82
00:02:53,480 --> 00:02:56,640
of sun you want to grow some herbs

83
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:58,599
there's nothing better than cutting

84
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,000
chives and scrambling them into your

85
00:02:58,599 --> 00:03:03,599
eggs that day or or harvesting fresh cut

86
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:05,959
basil for you know a little garnish or

87
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,840
making your own pesto with so if you are

88
00:03:05,959 --> 00:03:09,680
going to have a kitchen herb garden you

89
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,680
can plant your herbs pretty close

90
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,959
together it's called intensive planting

91
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,080
because you're going to be constantly

92
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,200
harvesting from them you're basically

93
00:03:15,080 --> 00:03:19,599
pring the plant on a weekly basis so you

94
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:22,120
don't need to listen to the guidelines

95
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:24,239
on on the plant tag so in this one

96
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:27,280
container I have oregano parsley

97
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,400
cilantro rosemary thyme Sage micro dorf

98
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:31,519
Tomatoes I have lettuces on the outside

99
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:33,959
I am using every square inch of this

100
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:36,400
planter to get the largest yield of

101
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,239
Edibles that I can because when you're

102
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:40,840
on a balcony you got to make use of your

103
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,560
space right number four be mindful of

104
00:03:40,840 --> 00:03:45,760
the varieties that you choose when

105
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,439
balcony and container gardening I have

106
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,879
an entire salad worth of food in this

107
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,640
one container because I've chosen micro

108
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,200
dwarf varieties when you're at the

109
00:03:52,640 --> 00:03:57,239
Garden Center it's either going to say

110
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:58,959
dwarf variety patio variety or container

111
00:03:57,239 --> 00:04:01,640
variety those are plants that have been

112
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:03,519
intentionally br to have be more smaller

113
00:04:01,640 --> 00:04:06,959
and compact so you can grow them in

114
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:08,959
small spaces as an example this is the

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,599
kitchen minis red velvet micro dworf

116
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:13,319
tomato it's only going to get like 12

117
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,879
Ines tall maybe this big I'll get a ton

118
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,320
of tomatoes off this plant but it's just

119
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,639
going to be super small in here I'm

120
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,199
growing a quick snack cucumber so it's a

121
00:04:19,639 --> 00:04:22,440
Vine it's going to climb up the Trella

122
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:24,800
so it's not going to take up a lot of

123
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,479
space it's going to grow mini cucumbers

124
00:04:24,800 --> 00:04:28,680
right so these are all mini plants I

125
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,759
have a mini um bell pepper plant the

126
00:04:28,680 --> 00:04:32,680
kitchen mini fresh by spites orange

127
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:35,199
sweet pepper and then I also am growing

128
00:04:32,680 --> 00:04:37,360
Tom Thumb lettuce which is like a more

129
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,280
compact lettuce so I have a ton of

130
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:40,560
plants in here and the reason why I can

131
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,479
plant them all together is because

132
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:45,280
they're all micro dorf patio varieties

133
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:46,960
so they're going to take up less space

134
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,080
Also if you want to grow flowers you

135
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:50,360
definitely should if you're trying to

136
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,960
grow food right because if tomatoes need

137
00:04:50,360 --> 00:04:54,639
pollinators to make sure that you get a

138
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:57,720
lot of beautiful fruit so I have small

139
00:04:54,639 --> 00:04:59,720
edible flowers like these violas also if

140
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:01,840
you're looking at the Garden Center make

141
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,840
sure sometimes if you get a Zenia for

142
00:05:01,840 --> 00:05:08,400
example it'll be a container Zenia or a

143
00:05:04,840 --> 00:05:11,199
patio Zenia or you can just look at the

144
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:12,560
tag to see how tall the plant gets if

145
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,320
you're trying to grow a flower I

146
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:17,120
wouldn't grow a flower that gets over

147
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,919
like 12 or 16 inches tall Zenia is a

148
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,520
great example you can buy a Zenia that

149
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:22,919
can get four feet tall or you could buy

150
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:25,520
a Zenia that can get 10 Ines tall so

151
00:05:22,919 --> 00:05:28,560
read the packet before you buy this

152
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:30,639
isn't a packet this is a plant card and

153
00:05:28,560 --> 00:05:32,680
last but not least my find the shade

154
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:35,080
that your balcony railing or other

155
00:05:32,680 --> 00:05:36,800
balconies around you can provide in my

156
00:05:35,080 --> 00:05:39,000
first apartment in New York City when I

157
00:05:36,800 --> 00:05:41,160
had that tiny balcony I mentioned it was

158
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:43,080
an apartment balcony there was a balcony

159
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:45,479
on top of us a balcony below us so we

160
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:49,080
were actually shaded also understand

161
00:05:45,479 --> 00:05:51,720
your exposure so this balcony this uh

162
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:54,720
this is South the the sun rises in the

163
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:56,680
East sets in the west so we get really

164
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:58,560
strong Western Light um these plants

165
00:05:56,680 --> 00:06:00,880
pretty much get direct sunlight for

166
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:02,720
eight hours a day but if you have a

167
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:05,000
balcony that faces the north it's going

168
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:06,800
to be a lower light situation right so

169
00:06:05,000 --> 00:06:09,319
you need to see do I have unobstructed

170
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:12,160
views of the Sun or do I have a balcony

171
00:06:09,319 --> 00:06:14,639
or another building blocking the Sun for

172
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:17,280
my plants and then also what is the

173
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:20,000
railing doing to my plants so if you see

174
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:21,880
this this is an elevated garden so it's

175
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:24,520
amazing because this railing is never

176
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:27,199
going to cast shade on this planter

177
00:06:24,520 --> 00:06:29,240
however my grow bags over here might get

178
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,840
some shade because at the point where

179
00:06:29,240 --> 00:06:32,840
the sun is over there they're going to

180
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:35,759
be in a little bit of a shadow so be

181
00:06:32,840 --> 00:06:38,280
mindful of the exposure of your balcony

182
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:40,240
and then the shade that other elements

183
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:42,479
