  "text": "[Music] in Southeast Asia most rice fields use up to three times more water than the amount needed and suffer 5 to 10% lower yields and reduced Milling output and quality from an even maturing all because most rice fields are not properly leveled a well-level rice field is crucial before planting your crop it leads to even crop growth and ripening uniform water coverage which means Savings in irrigation water and fewer weed problems all leading to a healthier crop maximum yield and even better grain quality traditionally most farmers in Asia use draft animals and two wheel tractors that drag Harrows and leveling boards across the flooded fields to level their land an ideal way of leveling rice fields is through laser leveling laser leveling for Rise is slowly emerging in some Southeast Asian countries such as Vietnam Cambodia and La PDR with laser leveling a laser transmitter plays at a side of the field sends a laser beam to a laser receiver which is attached to a leveling bucket drawn by a tractor the control panel or box mounted on the tractor interprets the signal from the receiver and opens or closes the hydraulic valve which raises or lowers the bucket the bucket then drags and drops soil across the field to make it even the laser receiver signals the adjustments of the leveling bucket accordingly to ensure that the height distance between the soil and the laser signal stays the same making the soil as leveled as possible laser leveling can be done in dry fields thus saving valuable water for growing the crop farmers can do laser leveling during the dry season or when the crop has not grown [Music] yet the international rice Research Institute with support from Trimble Company introduced laser leveling for rise in Vietnam in 2003 by providing equipment and training to the Baku Seeds Center and Nong Lam University the Baku Seeds Center has a network of farmers who grow seeds for laser leveling of these areas farmers pay 50% of the cost while the government covers the remaining 50% since their fields were laser leveled Farmers from garai District of Baku have been enjoying many benefits [Music] foree Mr danganan observed that households that got their fields laser leveled now have better livelihoods and are able to buy the things they need such as pump equipment TV sets and motorcycles such is the case of Mr Fam unl's Family whose lives have changed quite a bit from Simply earning a few additional Vietnamese Dong per [Music] [Music] Hector farmers in anang Province are also now experiencing similar benefits of laser leveling Nan vanan andan fdf's field was the first field laser level in anang in 2006 it took only 2 days to level their 4 Hector field using laser leveling while leveling 0.3 Hector using a buffalo used to take them through 3 to 4 days with a well- leveled field they now use a drum seater for direct seating before it took them 30 person days to manually weed their unleveled 4 hectare field now that they use a drum seeder that plants seeds neatly in rows weeding takes only 4 days using a row weeder with her leveled land fertilizer is spread evenly resing in in less lodging golden apple snails which used to hide in uneven spots can no longer do so they have reduced their fuel for pumping water from 20 to 30 L of diesel to only 7 L for all four hectar they saved even more water from adopting alternate wetting and drying which allows them to alternately flaw their field at times and let it stay dry for a few days danan vanai a farmer who is part of the one must do five reductions program in anjang is also reaping the rewards of a well-level field as he applies the best practices taught in the program for lyuk a progressive farmer from 3on District anang borrowed the laser leveling equipment from Nong Lam University bought his own tractor and Laser leveled all of his 150 hectare Rice Field over the last three [Music] years seed production he says has higher value seed since then his yield has increased by 0.7 ton per Hector and his income by 30% in the future he plans to build more mechanical flatbed dryers and Seed processing equipment Dr F Yu Yen Erie post Harvest consultant estimates that in Vietnam about 300 hectar of Rise Fields have been laser leveled with more than 200 100 hectar in the mechon Delta I think the the news has spread enough uh from the high level official to the ordinary people and uh today I can say that it's an equipment that will change the arure especially the rise arure in a very Major Way in this sector Now with an urgent need to ease the labor shortage by using agricultural machineries such as combine Harvesters laser leveling is being reintroduced in neighboring Cambodia in November 2011 the irrigated rice research Consortium and the Erie Asian development Bank Post Harvest project organized a laser leveling demonstration at the Don Bosco School in batambang Province almost 100 extension workers farmers and students attended the event the goal is to increase ride production and the Royal government yes has just put in place a new policy to improve ride production and also to export me r on our own uh we have to have uh what we call uh appropriate farm management techniques that will range from uh land preparation to harvesting the crop for the policy to be uh successfully implemented uh farmers will have to come back to the technology like Laser Land leveling uh as it is one of the many options or solutions to achieve that goal with combined efforts from National partners and renewed Vigor to promote the technology more farmers in Southeast Asia will benefit from laser leveling and the many advantages it [Music] brings [Music] a n",
