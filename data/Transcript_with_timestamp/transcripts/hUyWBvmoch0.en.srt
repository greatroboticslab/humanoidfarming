00:00:00,560 --> 00:00:04,640
here's a random day in my life as a

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,080
farmer i started by cleaning my room and

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:07,759
then replied to some emails from

4
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:09,679
customers and got some chicken thawing

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,160
for dinner from the freezer before

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:13,200
making a super fast breakfast of eggs

7
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,120
and toast

8
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:17,600
i added some green onions and cheese to

9
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:20,880
this to just make it more flavorful and

10
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,800
it's super quick and delicious

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,560
morning chores then began and i drove

12
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:26,880
down to our shop to pack the curbside

13
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:30,000
pickup orders for the day which i set

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:31,760
out by our farm store for pickup

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,280
after that i fed and watered the chicks

16
00:00:31,760 --> 00:00:35,360
in our brooder which are just over one

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:38,020

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,200
the heat lamps to survive

19
00:00:38,020 --> 00:00:42,800
[Music]

20
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:44,399
naomi just got back from feeding our

21
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:46,079
laying hens with bailey so we both

22
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:48,559
filled four buckets of pig feed for our

23
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,559
16 pigs and then drove out to our north

24
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,719
woods they all came over to see us when

25
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:54,960
we arrived which is so cute and we fold

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,039
up their theater i gave them lots of

27
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:58,719
scratches which they love

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:00,879
and check to make sure their electric

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,399
wire was on and hot and that they were

30
00:01:00,879 --> 00:01:04,399
happy and content before leaving

31
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,119
we then went back to our shop and filled

32
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
five buckets of feed for our five week

33
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:13,439
old meat chickens we brought these out

34
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:14,880
to our east pasture to their mobile

35
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:16,799
prairie schooner and filled their

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,880
feeders and made sure that they had

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:21,040
water and were also content next on the

38
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:22,720
list was moving our flock of sheep

39
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:24,640
naomi and i set up their new area with

40
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,840
electric netting and let them in their

41
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:28,880
new area and then move their pen and

42
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,880
water

43
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:34,640
and turn the fence on to keep them in

44
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:34,640
and predators out as the last step

45
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:41,360
back at our shop naomi and i then packed

46
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,000

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,240

00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:52,560
and we had leftover tacos

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:55,520
and we drove and dropped off all the

51
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,840
orders to be shipped out same day and

52
00:01:55,520 --> 00:01:58,799
as soon as i got back i filmed some

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,119
footage

54
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:03,200
to edit for our customers and ended up

55
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,320
just sitting with the pigs as

56
00:02:03,200 --> 00:02:07,320
they're honestly pretty fun to watch

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:12,160
after that i started dinner and decided

58
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,160
to make something we never eat which

59
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:16,000
turned into homemade chips and fried

60
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:17,599
chicken with green salad

61
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,080
definitely an indulgence but pretty

62
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:20,080
amazing

63
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,760
after dinner i brushed our dog bailey as

64
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:25,599
she's been shedding a lot and it's been

65
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:27,280
on my list and then the last thing of

66
00:02:25,599 --> 00:02:30,760
the day was some formatting i had to do

67
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,760
and that's it
