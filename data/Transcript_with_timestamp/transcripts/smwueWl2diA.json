  "text": "hi i'm albert bates what i'm going to do today is walk you through the process that we use uh here in my community at the farm and at the ecovillage training center to make biochar and we object the objectives of how we do it are to make it very simple and easy and very accessible and low cost it's not perfect in fact it's going to lose some carbon dioxide back to the atmosphere that could be saved if we did it a slightly different way but in the process that we use you don't need very many tools and you can do this yourself at home in a very small area we like to use bamboo because we have a lot of it and because it grows very quickly and so we're going to be using bamboo to make biochar we'll make about two wheelbarrow loads in 45 minutes and i have a lot of bamboo at the moment because it grows fast fastest growing plant on the terrestrial surface of the earth and this is my feedstock for making biochar for cutting bamboo i'm using two simple tools loppers and a saber saw battery powered and i have a lot of bamboo coming into my garden it's been creeping past the fence so now i'm going in and i'm cutting it back i'm going to take it and trim it down and make it suitable for the biochar kiln that i'm going to build and right now i'm just taking it all down and stacking it letting it dry in the sun so it's good and dry before we burn it just those two simple tools loppers and the saber saw now we're cutting the bamboo's uh branches off using the machete that's another tool and after we've done that we can cut the trim it down to size uh using a table saw that we've moved out into the forest there this makes it very easy to trim the bamboo combs down to the right size for to fit our kiln and after we've done that we're going to start the fire we always start from the top down that eliminates smoke so we want to not have smoke coming off and to do that we start a small fire using some paper and kindling and cardboard at the top and then let that work down as we add more bamboo and we're going to be adding bamboo that we've got stacked up here dry and ready to burn until we've completely filled the pit that we've dug and we've dug a pit that's about 1 meter deep and about two meters two and a half meters across and i'm watching the temperature here i'm gonna mark it i want it above 450 degrees and i want it uh somewhere in the 450 to 550 degree range now that we've completely filled the pit and it's starting to turn white i don't want it to go to ash i want it to stay black that's the biochar so it i can't let it go to the final stage where it oxidizes and turns to ash so i've stuck the hose down in the bottom of the fire so that the water rises from the bottom of the pit and comes and steam cleans all the pores after that we move over to the chipper shredder stage i've got a little electric shredder here for compost shredding and we're using that to bring the size of the of the particles down to the size an earthworm could digest now we've built a second pit this one is up by the driveway where i've got still more bamboo to cut back i want to cut it away from the power lines and so we built another pit and we started the same process over again we're letting it go to the point where the pit is full and we're keeping the ash from forming we're anytime we see it turning a little bit white we we spray down with water or add more material and then eventually it gets to the point where we put the hose in the bottom let it steam clean the pores again until we've quenched the fire completely it's come up over the top of the biochar and there's nothing there on the but a pool of wet char if you want to eliminate the electric chipper shredder this is a way to micronize the particles the final stage of microbialization and mineralization uh involve turning the biochar into something suitable for soil and we do that i bought a 30 pickup truck load of composted cow manure and we moved that down to the garden using the tractor where we make a compost pile with the biochar biochar straight out of the kiln is hydrophobic it repels water so we have to moisten it and then we need to add in the microbes the microbial community before we add the biochar to the garden otherwise it will steal it from the garden any kind of substrate can make good biochar if it's a photosynthetic origin when it goes through the kiln it forms new forms of biochar new forms of carbon because carbon bonds to itself at 450 or 500 degrees and it forms ring structures and chain structures and that's why it endures in the soil for hundreds to thousands of years the pyrolysis process itself has many potential yields because it produces heat it's exothermic it loses about half of the carbon back to the atmosphere but it produces all the things you can produce with heat and it saves biochar in the soil carbon in the soil and that goes into the carbon cycle of the soil rather than returning to the atmosphere in oceans so photosynthesis is our key ingredient here that's what takes the carbon out of the atmosphere out of the ocean and now we want to change it into a form that's going to stay in land for thousands of years there are many good designs for using the heat from the process to cook with or to apply to make electricity lots of good designs there for stoves and other implements that make biochar of course if you're doing this a lot or with larger volumes you might want to invest in a little more permanent pit this is the method of the contiki kiln easy online available public domain design and it can make prodigious amounts of biochar as shown here biochar absolutely has to scale if we're going to get out of this century and alive and many companies are already jumping into this space thanks for listening and i hope you will try making biochar yourself it's going to be fun and you'll have a good time and it's simple scalable and shovel ready you",
