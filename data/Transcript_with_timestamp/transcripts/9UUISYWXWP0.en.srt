[Music]

2
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,560
welcome everyone to

3
00:00:15,120 --> 00:00:21,680
our farm scale composting workshop

4
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:25,680
our presenter today is jeff andres

5
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:27,599
chair of yahara pride farms incorporated

6
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,599
he's the board he's out he serves as the

7
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:32,480
chair on the board of directors

8
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:35,360
which in this yahara pride farms is a

9
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,840
farm-led not-for-profit organization

10
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,640
working to improve soil and water

11
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,680
quality

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:43,280
thank you jeff so thank you for having

13
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:44,960
me and thanks to the sponsors for

14
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:48,239
sponsoring this segment of

15
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,879
of the conference uh once stephanie

16
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
first

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:55,120
approached me about speaking um

18
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:56,559
she was talking about the composting and

19
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:58,559
sharing some things

20
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:00,239
with the with the conference and after i

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,840
committed she said i needed to talk for

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,400
90 minutes

23
00:01:01,840 --> 00:01:04,960
so hopefully i've got enough information

24
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:07,439
here and

25
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,080
uh and good information that keeps

26
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,200
everybody

27
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:14,320
energized and and uh

28
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:15,680
into this program and and uh hopefully

29
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:18,000
we all can uh

30
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
get something out of it uh we've been

31
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,560
doing this for a while

32
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:25,759
and uh but uh you know

33
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:27,119
still a lot to learn so um anders barry

34
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:30,320
ridge farms

35
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:33,600
is uh i'm in uh the

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:37,360
uh uh would be the

37
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,960
fourth generation um farmers or

38
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:41,040
third generation fourth generation

39
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:44,640
moving to the fifth generation

40
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:47,040
um this picture here on the farm uh

41
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:49,119
was the the house and the original dairy

42
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:52,720
barn was built by my grandpa and

43
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:53,520
in 1913 the land has been in the family

44
00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,119
since

45
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:01,119
excuse me since uh the late

46
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:04,399
1800s our farm is uh

47
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:08,640
is located in the ohio watershed and

48
00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:11,039
as uh my bio says uh we uh

49
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,879
i also chair the higher pride farms

50
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,000
farmer-led organization

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:18,250
um with the uh

52
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:19,360
where we uh try to

53
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:21,599
[Music]

54
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,040
improve water quality as well soil

55
00:02:21,599 --> 00:02:25,200
health in this region

56
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:26,400
working directly with the farmers and

57
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,760
and we've been

58
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:33,200
in existence since 2012

59
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,400
and the organization has had some great

60
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:36,640
success

61
00:02:34,400 --> 00:02:37,599
our farm is located in the northwestern

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,720
part of the

63
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,480
the watershed uh with the state capitol

64
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,319
uh right in the center of the isthmus of

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,440
the five lakes

66
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:50,480
um very good farmland in this area

67
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:54,480
uh also very uh very

68
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:57,519
a very uh populated area as well um

69
00:02:54,480 --> 00:03:00,000
vast majority of the farmers are dairy

70
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:01,040
mostly in the northern part of the the

71
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,480
watershed

72
00:03:01,040 --> 00:03:07,760
southern part of the watershed is more

73
00:03:04,480 --> 00:03:09,360
crop land and more

74
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:12,560
more maybe some more of the beef and

75
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:12,560
swine down in that area

76
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:18,800
andrus berry ridge farms three equal

77
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:20,400
partners myself

78
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,360
my brother steve and randy and their

79
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:26,400
families uh milking 500 cows

80
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:27,760
approximately 400 heifers 1100 acres of

81
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:31,200
land

82
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,840
grow alfalfa grass soybeans wheat

83
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:35,599
i guess we also sell genetics uh

84
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:39,280
registered herd of cows

85
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,959
uh have some high genomic cows um

86
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:42,720
we've all showed all three families that

87
00:03:40,959 --> 00:03:43,519
showed at the local fairs and the dairy

88
00:03:42,720 --> 00:03:47,120
expo

89
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:49,920
so uh well-rounded farm

90
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:51,440
one of the things that we concentrate on

91
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:52,319
the farm is being good stewards of the

92
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,159
land

93
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:57,519
we use a lot of cover crops we do a lot

94
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,519
of minimum tillage

95
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:06,319
our housing of our livestock calves

96
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:08,799
up to six months are in group pens

97
00:04:06,319 --> 00:04:10,080
we bed with primarily corn stocks ground

98
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,159
corn stouffer

99
00:04:10,080 --> 00:04:14,080
that corn stover is normally chopped

100
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:17,840
twice before we bale it

101
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:22,479
so it's not look overly long and stringy

102
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:25,199
uh it's sized and particle size

103
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,840
you know three to four inches we do use

104
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,080
a little bit of wood shavings with the

105
00:04:26,840 --> 00:04:30,560
calves

106
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:33,199
heifers that are seven months and older

107
00:04:30,560 --> 00:04:35,919
are then introduced to freestalls

108
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:38,639
and we are bedding with uh ground corn

109
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:42,080
cobs and sawdust in those

110
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:47,600
stalls and then all our lactating cows

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:47,600
are are on sand bedding

112
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:55,600
six months all the manure is

113
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:57,440
i should say the manure to six months

114
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,720
and younger and older

115
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:03,600
manures all the all the manure from

116
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,720
the heifers from baby calves until they

117
00:05:03,600 --> 00:05:07,039
have their first calf

118
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,639
is now being composted on the farm in

119
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,320
one way or another

120
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:13,759
uh the manure that from the heifers that

121
00:05:12,320 --> 00:05:18,000
are in the freeze stalls

122
00:05:13,759 --> 00:05:18,000
is hauled daily to a local um

123
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:20,639
um

124
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:27,440
what am i saying local manure digester

125
00:05:24,639 --> 00:05:29,680
where they harvest the methane out of it

126
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,759
we bring back the separated fiber

127
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:33,280
and that goes into the composting

128
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:35,680
process

129
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:39,039
we have enough liquid storage for six

130
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:42,160
months for the lactating cows

131
00:05:39,039 --> 00:05:46,080
what is composting and this is a very

132
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:49,919
basic definition and it's combining

133
00:05:46,080 --> 00:05:53,440
carbon and nitrogen sources together

134
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:56,960
and decay the deco composition

135
00:05:53,440 --> 00:06:00,400
uh uh of the organic matter

136
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:01,360
into a simpler form by introducing these

137
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:04,800
two

138
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:07,120
two uh sources together and

139
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:09,039
by the decaying organic materials then

140
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:11,759
is used for

141
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:14,080
plant fertilizer it's been around for

142
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:18,160
centuries

143
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:20,160
why farm scale composting

144
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,840
number one thing is just drink volumes

145
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:23,759
and concentrate nutrients

146
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:25,840
you also kill pathogens and break down

147
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:27,759
carbon the carbon bedding

148
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,600
and you make nutrients more available to

149
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,160
the growing crops

150
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:33,120
and one of the reasons you are making it

151
00:06:32,160 --> 00:06:35,600
more available

152
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:36,720
is by breaking down the carbon bedding

153
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
which normally

154
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:43,120
in some cases takes up nutrients out of

155
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:43,120
the soil to break it down in the field

156
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:49,039
can be an alternative way to handle

157
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,199
manure other than liquid

158
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:53,520
because the composting process uses a

159
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:57,440
lot of moisture

160
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:59,440
you can you can use you can take some

161
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,840
higher moisture manures and introduce it

162
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:05,759
to the composting process

163
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,759
minimizing the amount of liquid storage

164
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:10,000
one thing that is became very evident in

165
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,880
our research and the work that we've

166
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:13,360
done here

167
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:15,440
is that it converts the soluble

168
00:07:13,360 --> 00:07:17,199
phosphorus in manure to a more stable

169
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:18,960
particulate form that binds to the

170
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,120
carbon in the compost

171
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,400
therefore making it a safer product to

172
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,280
take to the field

173
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:28,960
when you have runoff events it doesn't

174
00:07:25,280 --> 00:07:31,039
tend to move as quickly off the field

175
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,039
uh manurepo manure composting and

176
00:07:31,039 --> 00:07:33,759
renaults is also an alternative way to

177
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,639
store

178
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:37,520
and stack manure um utilizing your

179
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,000
headlands

180
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:42,400
and your fields actually for the storage

181
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,759
versus

182
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:48,240
a manure pit or a structure

183
00:07:45,759 --> 00:07:51,440
allows a wider window for applying

184
00:07:48,240 --> 00:07:54,720
livestock nutrients back on the field

185
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:57,599
we got more ability to spread on on

186
00:07:54,720 --> 00:07:59,199
growing crops in the summertime

187
00:07:57,599 --> 00:08:01,199
a lot of times when you spread liquid

188
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,319
manure it's a fall and

189
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:06,160
and and spring application only a couple

190
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,240
weeks to get it done

191
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,440
compost allows us to get that nutrients

192
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:12,960
out there

193
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:16,639
and more often

194
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:19,199
more days of the year than say liquid

195
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,960
compost has a less less risk to enter

196
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,960
groundwater because of the organic

197
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:26,000
nitrogen

198
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,160
tends not to move as easy and better

199
00:08:26,000 --> 00:08:31,120
avoids potential water quality issues by

200
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:33,279
minimizing the risk of runoff

201
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:34,800
better utilization of nutrients in the

202
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:36,880
farm system

203
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,800
this is something i learned early on is

204
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:40,640
now we have all this nutrients that we

205
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:42,479
have tied up out in our farm field some

206
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:45,920
are higher than others

207
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:48,480
and some fields get manure more often

208
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:51,519
than others in the form of liquid manure

209
00:08:48,480 --> 00:08:52,959
this way we can get manure out to those

210
00:08:51,519 --> 00:08:55,200
fields that don't

211
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:56,640
for instance if they're highly erodible

212
00:08:55,200 --> 00:08:59,279
we can get manure to those

213
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:00,959
fields more often in the form of compost

214
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:03,279
therefore using the higher

215
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:04,720
fertility fields of the farms to

216
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:08,240
actually feed the

217
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:11,519
lower fertility fields in the farm

218
00:09:08,240 --> 00:09:13,040
history of of composting on at barry

219
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:16,560
ridge farms

220
00:09:13,040 --> 00:09:19,360
the first time i

221
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:21,279
was approached about composting was our

222
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:22,240
tenant we have a hog facility that we

223
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:28,160
rent out

224
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:32,160
was the summer of 2000 2014.

225
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:34,800
got a little misprint there um pvp

226
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,399
dv uh was moving through the country at

227
00:09:34,800 --> 00:09:39,760
that time and

228
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,760
they no longer could render

229
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:45,760
mortalities so they were looking for an

230
00:09:43,360 --> 00:09:46,800
alternative way to dispose of their

231
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:49,040
mortalities

232
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:51,600
and they approached me about getting

233
00:09:49,040 --> 00:09:54,720
some corn stock bedding

234
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:58,000
to make some windrows to

235
00:09:54,720 --> 00:10:01,279
embed the the mortalities in to

236
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,720
to compost them and i said i could do

237
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:03,200
one thing better i could supply them

238
00:10:02,720 --> 00:10:05,600
with a

239
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,480
all the betting pack manure they wanted

240
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:09,839
and

241
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:12,959
therefore um we

242
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:14,240
started that process and i was amazed

243
00:10:12,959 --> 00:10:16,720
after

244
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:18,640
a month's worth of time of that

245
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,839
mortality being in that

246
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:22,720
windrow house how it disappeared with

247
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:27,200
very minimal

248
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:30,480
smell ore or attraction of flies

249
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:33,360
the summer of 2015

250
00:10:30,480 --> 00:10:34,079
we were awarded a sare grant and

251
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,880
managing

252
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:38,240
summer we were managing summer packed uh

253
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:41,519
betting pack manure

254
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:41,519
strictly in the summer

255
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:46,000
we we received the grant to offset some

256
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:49,279
costs and

257
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:51,600
experiment with composting with two

258
00:10:49,279 --> 00:10:55,279
other local farmers

259
00:10:51,600 --> 00:10:57,760
and that was to

260
00:10:55,279 --> 00:10:59,519
to help understand a little bit more

261
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:02,800
about what we could do

262
00:10:59,519 --> 00:11:04,240
with the composting what were some of

263
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:07,279
the alternative

264
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:08,480
um well first of all could we make good

265
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:10,399
compost

266
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:12,240
second of all what are the what are some

267
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:13,120
of the things we could use the compost

268
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,000
for

269
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:16,720
one of them was uh potentially some

270
00:11:16,000 --> 00:11:19,760
livestock

271
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:23,200
uh bedding at at some point

272
00:11:19,760 --> 00:11:25,519
at a certain point of the of the process

273
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:27,120
as well as we moved some compost off the

274
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:30,160
farm to another farm

275
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:33,519
that did not have a history of

276
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:37,440
manure or or compost in their

277
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:40,640
farming operation in 2017 we received a

278
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:43,120
community grant to continue composting

279
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:44,079
and to build we also built a new heifer

280
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:47,200
facility

281
00:11:44,079 --> 00:11:48,079
in compost shed so the idea of that

282
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:49,920
grant

283
00:11:48,079 --> 00:11:52,399
was more on the water quality side of

284
00:11:49,920 --> 00:11:55,360
things being involved with uhera pride

285
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,040
and our organization and the community

286
00:11:55,360 --> 00:11:57,839
this area is very concerned with the

287
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,519
five lakes

288
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:01,680
of the water quality and what comes off

289
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:02,800
these farm fields mainly in the form of

290
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:05,360
phosphorus

291
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:06,000
we were wondering if there was a way we

292
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,320
could

293
00:12:06,000 --> 00:12:09,279
potentially make compost move that

294
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,320
nutrients

295
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:15,519
to farms that need it and our

296
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:16,000
our watershed is a perfect example with

297
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,680
the

298
00:12:16,000 --> 00:12:20,560
livestock being in the northern part of

299
00:12:17,680 --> 00:12:22,160
the watershed and very few livestock in

300
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:24,480
the southern part of the watershed

301
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:27,040
how could we potentially work together

302
00:12:24,480 --> 00:12:29,200
and move that nutrients from the farm

303
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:31,920
from those livestock heavy livestock

304
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:38,680
areas to areas that are not getting

305
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:41,920
manure and or organic fertilizer

306
00:12:38,680 --> 00:12:43,120
2018 we designed and built a compost

307
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:47,519
turner

308
00:12:43,120 --> 00:12:50,720
with a local equipment manufacturer or

309
00:12:47,519 --> 00:12:54,399
i should say a fabricator welding shop

310
00:12:50,720 --> 00:12:58,959
that complemented our composting process

311
00:12:54,399 --> 00:13:00,560
and allows us to be much more efficient

312
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:03,120
2019 we worked with a number of

313
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:07,680
different carbon sources in our manure

314
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:09,920
uh we we did a trial with the mmsd the

315
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,320
madison metropolitan sewer district

316
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:13,200
uh with some of their class a bile

317
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,720
solids

318
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:20,079
we worked with some with grass and

319
00:13:16,720 --> 00:13:22,959
straw um

320
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:25,760
betting pack manure separated fiber all

321
00:13:22,959 --> 00:13:28,880
those types of carbon sources

322
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:32,839
and we did a study as far as how

323
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,000
how how they performed in the composting

324
00:13:32,839 --> 00:13:36,399
process

325
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:38,079
2020 we started working with local the

326
00:13:36,399 --> 00:13:41,040
local manure digester

327
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:43,600
to allow us to increase composting to

328
00:13:41,040 --> 00:13:46,639
all our livestock which i said earlier

329
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,240
other than the milk and cows and

330
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:52,160
what that really did was allowed us to

331
00:13:50,240 --> 00:13:53,600
get a little additional moisture out of

332
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:56,160
that manure

333
00:13:53,600 --> 00:13:58,160
before we introduced it to uh the

334
00:13:56,160 --> 00:14:01,279
composting process

335
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:05,040
and now we have all of

336
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:07,040
our young stock manures being

337
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,680
being treated or you could say being

338
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:13,199
processed through the compost

339
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:15,519
system currently we

340
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:17,040
continue to try other ideas that might

341
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:21,519
add value to the

342
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:25,120
agronomic value of compost and

343
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:25,120
how it performs in the field

344
00:14:25,519 --> 00:14:32,639
again the sarah grant we

345
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:34,079
the outcomes uh for the idea of it

346
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:35,839
was to improve the long-term

347
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,760
sustainability of each farm through the

348
00:14:35,839 --> 00:14:38,880
marketing of value-added soil amendments

349
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:42,839
and moving nutrients

350
00:14:38,880 --> 00:14:44,000
out of the phosphorus impaired watershed

351
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:46,240
uh

352
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:47,760
we did that uh with that trial we had

353
00:14:46,240 --> 00:14:50,880
one of the farms that

354
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,320
uh again we hauled the finished compost

355
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:54,399
to a farm in the southern part of the

356
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:55,440
watershed that did not have a manure

357
00:14:54,399 --> 00:15:00,320
history

358
00:14:55,440 --> 00:15:00,320
and we had seen some some results there

359
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,600
we also were looking at

360
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,959
the possibilities of using it for

361
00:15:07,600 --> 00:15:12,560
betting

362
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:14,480
and the the trial included

363
00:15:12,560 --> 00:15:16,240
daily temperature carbon dioxide

364
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:20,320
accumulation

365
00:15:16,240 --> 00:15:23,680
moisture percentages visual evaluation

366
00:15:20,320 --> 00:15:25,920
of the leachate and runoff and steam

367
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:28,079
generated and one of the things that we

368
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:31,920
are learning with the composting

369
00:15:28,079 --> 00:15:32,800
out in the fields on headland stacking

370
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:35,040
or

371
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:36,240
field edge is there's very little

372
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:40,480
leachate

373
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:43,440
and and that is very important

374
00:15:40,480 --> 00:15:45,680
as far as worrying about contaminating

375
00:15:43,440 --> 00:15:48,880
contaminating groundwater

376
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:50,480
um it seems like the the compost

377
00:15:48,880 --> 00:15:53,600
when you're turning the compost

378
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:56,000
regularly it actually

379
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,639
burns up that extra moisture in the

380
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:58,320
water

381
00:15:56,639 --> 00:16:01,120
in a lot of cases actually draws

382
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:04,320
moisture out of the ground

383
00:16:01,120 --> 00:16:06,399
as i said we uh we learned in the sarah

384
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:09,279
grant that at a certain point

385
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:10,720
in the process three or four weeks in

386
00:16:09,279 --> 00:16:13,199
that the compost

387
00:16:10,720 --> 00:16:14,639
uh was in a state that we thought it

388
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:17,120
would actually make

389
00:16:14,639 --> 00:16:19,600
pretty decent bedding at that time it

390
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:24,000
probably was turned four or five times

391
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:27,519
uh had good pathogen kill and we used it

392
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:30,800
in our freestyles for our heifers

393
00:16:27,519 --> 00:16:33,759
one of the problems we had though

394
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,480
because we did we only scrape once a day

395
00:16:33,759 --> 00:16:37,839
our

396
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,920
freestyle alleyways we had some issues

397
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:42,399
with hairy hoof warts with the

398
00:16:39,920 --> 00:16:43,279
with the heifers uh they were drawing a

399
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:46,320
little bit too much

400
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:49,199
moisture into the into the freestalls

401
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,399
and seemed like those hairy hoof it's

402
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:53,440
flourished

403
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:55,839
um in our facility

404
00:16:53,440 --> 00:16:56,880
at the end of the day uh it didn't work

405
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
well for us

406
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:01,600
uh as far as car cow comfort it was

407
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:03,440
great i think in a situation where you

408
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,880
had alley scrapers

409
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:10,160
or a slatted floor i think this could

410
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:13,039
be a pretty good

411
00:17:10,160 --> 00:17:14,319
potential practice or at a minimum being

412
00:17:13,039 --> 00:17:19,839
able to mix that

413
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:19,839
with another carbon source as bedding

414
00:17:21,039 --> 00:17:25,199
the community compost grant from 2017 to

415
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:26,959
2018

416
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:28,799
was funded and retrieved through the

417
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:31,120
clean lakes alliance

418
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:33,520
worked with uw madison on the research

419
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:36,160
side of things

420
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:38,160
evaluate the potential runoff of pea

421
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:40,960
loss on farms during the manure

422
00:17:38,160 --> 00:17:41,520
composting process and the application

423
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:44,880
to crop

424
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:48,880
fields this is where we found out that

425
00:17:44,880 --> 00:17:51,360
there was a transition from from

426
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:53,280
from soluble phosphorus to particulate

427
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:55,919
phosphorus that binds to the carbon

428
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:59,679
within the compost

429
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:02,360
that was something that

430
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:03,520
we didn't realize prior to this and and

431
00:18:02,360 --> 00:18:05,919
[Music]

432
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:07,679
we feel is pretty beneficial for the

433
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:10,400
environments

434
00:18:07,679 --> 00:18:11,520
again we used we also use bedding from

435
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:15,679
the six months and

436
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:18,240
younger the corn stalks straw

437
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:20,480
some wood shavings a little bit of sand

438
00:18:18,240 --> 00:18:25,039
mixed in some of that as well

439
00:18:20,480 --> 00:18:25,039
we were able to

440
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:29,679
get a little better handle on the

441
00:18:27,120 --> 00:18:30,400
expenses of what it was actually costing

442
00:18:29,679 --> 00:18:33,919
us

443
00:18:30,400 --> 00:18:37,360
at that time to do the composting

444
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,200
process that i'll be sharing later

445
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:41,120
the outcomes of the growing of the

446
00:18:39,200 --> 00:18:42,960
compost grant the summary

447
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:44,880
the growing awareness of the spreading

448
00:18:42,960 --> 00:18:46,720
of pack manure and melting snow

449
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:48,240
is not the best way to manage and use

450
00:18:46,720 --> 00:18:50,640
nutrients in the manure

451
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:52,960
so the idea of this was could we take

452
00:18:50,640 --> 00:18:54,960
manure off the farm fields

453
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:56,160
at particularly this time of the year

454
00:18:54,960 --> 00:18:59,120
when people

455
00:18:56,160 --> 00:19:00,400
are needing to get manure off out of the

456
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:02,880
out of the pens

457
00:19:00,400 --> 00:19:04,960
it's thawing can we put it into a

458
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,760
windrow and turn it into compost rather

459
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,160
than

460
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,880
spreading it out on the fields where it

461
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,840
is

462
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,840
highly

463
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:18,240
soluble phosphorus would

464
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:20,480
potentially move with the melting snow

465
00:19:18,240 --> 00:19:23,039
and get into our waterways

466
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:24,720
we also learned that the compost dries

467
00:19:23,039 --> 00:19:28,000
down saving a lot of

468
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:28,880
a lot of hauling costs we're generally

469
00:19:28,000 --> 00:19:31,120
seeing

470
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,760
a reduction of anywhere between 40 and

471
00:19:31,120 --> 00:19:36,480
60 percent in volume

472
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,600
we also learned that composting compost

473
00:19:36,480 --> 00:19:40,960
could be spread

474
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:42,559
on growing crops like alfalfa hay and

475
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:45,600
through our yield monitors on our

476
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:49,120
chopper uh where we harvest the

477
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:52,320
the uh hey we were able to see

478
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:54,160
a little bit of a yield bump um i was

479
00:19:52,320 --> 00:19:55,360
looking more so to see if we'd see a

480
00:19:54,160 --> 00:19:57,280
yield drag

481
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:58,640
if we were doing any damage so being

482
00:19:57,280 --> 00:20:00,480
that we've seen a little bit of a yield

483
00:19:58,640 --> 00:20:03,440
bump and we could detect it

484
00:20:00,480 --> 00:20:05,280
with our our own yield monitoring i felt

485
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:06,240
pretty good about that nutrients being

486
00:20:05,280 --> 00:20:09,200
used out in the

487
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,039
hay fields the other concern when you

488
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:13,440
put it on hay fields is you want

489
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:15,120
the pathogens to be reduced you don't

490
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:18,080
want to be re-harvesting

491
00:20:15,120 --> 00:20:20,480
pathogens especially pathogens that

492
00:20:18,080 --> 00:20:23,200
potentially could lead to herd diseases

493
00:20:20,480 --> 00:20:23,200
like yoni's

494
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,280
again the compost was more flexible for

495
00:20:25,840 --> 00:20:29,440
land application

496
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,039
and now we have the potential of selling

497
00:20:29,440 --> 00:20:35,840
off the farm

498
00:20:31,039 --> 00:20:35,840
our some of our excess nutrients

499
00:20:36,159 --> 00:20:40,960
headland stacking a convenient way to

500
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:42,960
start composting

501
00:20:40,960 --> 00:20:45,679
you could you could headline stack this

502
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:45,679
time of the year

503
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:52,960
another way of being uh uh

504
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:53,840
minima by bit another way to minimize

505
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:56,080
the risk of

506
00:20:53,840 --> 00:20:57,840
nutrients leaving the field and it would

507
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,520
just be a matter of bringing in

508
00:20:57,840 --> 00:21:03,840
the compost turner to aerate that

509
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:06,240
that headland stack or that windrow on

510
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:08,400
the edge of the field

511
00:21:06,240 --> 00:21:10,240
these areas when we sight them we're

512
00:21:08,400 --> 00:21:12,240
usually looking for areas that

513
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:14,480
maybe are high traffic areas that don't

514
00:21:12,240 --> 00:21:17,280
have the yield potential

515
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,960
therefore you're not necessarily taking

516
00:21:17,280 --> 00:21:21,520
land out of production that

517
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:22,480
that could be a net gain to your farm

518
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,520
operation

519
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,720
or your your feed needs

520
00:21:25,520 --> 00:21:29,679
the compost turner uh obviously you need

521
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:33,679
to introduce that

522
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:36,799
oxygen and liquidate the

523
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:37,200
waste gases uh to allow the composting

524
00:21:36,799 --> 00:21:39,840
and

525
00:21:37,200 --> 00:21:41,840
speedy decompress sensation the

526
00:21:39,840 --> 00:21:44,080
composting process how are we going

527
00:21:41,840 --> 00:21:47,679
about composting on our farm

528
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:47,679
as of as of today

529
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:55,840
and i guess the the

530
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:57,039
main thing is when we compost on our

531
00:21:55,840 --> 00:21:59,280
farm we do

532
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:01,520
do it two ways we do some of it on a

533
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:05,440
controlled environment under a roof

534
00:22:01,520 --> 00:22:08,559
and we do some on an outside pad

535
00:22:05,440 --> 00:22:10,799
cement pad where we

536
00:22:08,559 --> 00:22:12,080
uh are a little bit more exposed to the

537
00:22:10,799 --> 00:22:15,760
elements of of

538
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:17,440
uh of the weather and

539
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:19,360
uh to the picture to the right i got

540
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:22,320
actually got a caught a bald eagle

541
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:23,360
uh checking in on what we were doing uh

542
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:25,440
one day

543
00:22:23,360 --> 00:22:26,799
uh i thought it was kind of kind of

544
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:28,799
interesting

545
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:29,919
uh he must have seen it from a bird's

546
00:22:28,799 --> 00:22:32,559
eye view and had to

547
00:22:29,919 --> 00:22:34,400
take a closer look so there is there is

548
00:22:32,559 --> 00:22:37,440
interest in composting

549
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,760
out there and uh

550
00:22:37,440 --> 00:22:41,840
even this fellow was willing to check it

551
00:22:39,760 --> 00:22:41,840
out

552
00:22:43,919 --> 00:22:50,720
where can you compost so

553
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,720
the

554
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:59,120
the uh compost is

555
00:22:56,000 --> 00:23:04,320
we are doing it under a roof uh

556
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:04,320
and that roof is uh um

557
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:08,960
not cemented underneath it's a three

558
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,520
foot a clay

559
00:23:08,960 --> 00:23:12,799
base that was built for this

560
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:16,159
specifically

561
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:18,799
nrcs approved

562
00:23:16,159 --> 00:23:20,480
and then we also do an outside

563
00:23:18,799 --> 00:23:23,919
composting

564
00:23:20,480 --> 00:23:26,799
pad uh that we uh

565
00:23:23,919 --> 00:23:28,080
have a little bit more more material

566
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:30,320
than what we

567
00:23:28,080 --> 00:23:32,960
can do under the roof that's our our

568
00:23:30,320 --> 00:23:35,200
overflow

569
00:23:32,960 --> 00:23:37,120
both work well uh both have some

570
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:40,960
challenges

571
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:44,880
i do see a couple questions here uh

572
00:23:40,960 --> 00:23:48,000
first one being uh any permits needed

573
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:51,520
uh for in and

574
00:23:48,000 --> 00:23:54,640
nutrient management plan

575
00:23:51,520 --> 00:23:59,919
and um

576
00:23:54,640 --> 00:24:03,840
no we we are actually allowed to do

577
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:06,080
up to 4 500 yards

578
00:24:03,840 --> 00:24:08,080
one particular site if you do it on

579
00:24:06,080 --> 00:24:11,760
headline stacking

580
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:14,559
based off of nrcs rules

581
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:15,840
and was there any analysis done of the

582
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:19,520
microbe

583
00:24:15,840 --> 00:24:22,720
composition of the finished compost

584
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:26,080
we have not yet we do have some

585
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:27,120
i do have some tests of trace elements

586
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:33,840
within the

587
00:24:27,120 --> 00:24:33,840
compost on the fertility side

588
00:24:35,360 --> 00:24:39,360
moving forward here's another example of

589
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:41,760
where you compost though some of these

590
00:24:39,360 --> 00:24:45,520
trials we were doing out in the fields

591
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:48,640
here's a example of field edge

592
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:50,880
windrows that were in the field and

593
00:24:48,640 --> 00:24:52,640
if you look at the fields there is no in

594
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:53,520
the field here in the grass growing next

595
00:24:52,640 --> 00:24:56,400
to the

596
00:24:53,520 --> 00:25:00,000
compost you're not seeing any signs of

597
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:03,679
leeching or burning of the grass

598
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:05,600
that's coming out of these wind rolls

599
00:25:03,679 --> 00:25:08,720
the types of manure that we are now

600
00:25:05,600 --> 00:25:10,480
putting into our compost

601
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:11,840
on the left hand side we've got the

602
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:14,960
freestall scraping

603
00:25:11,840 --> 00:25:16,880
so that's the manure that we are

604
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,000
actually taking to the digester right

605
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:21,039
now

606
00:25:18,000 --> 00:25:21,679
that's you can see it's got a a little

607
00:25:21,039 --> 00:25:24,320
bit of a

608
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,679
slump to it it's not straight water by

609
00:25:24,320 --> 00:25:28,159
no means

610
00:25:25,679 --> 00:25:29,039
we can handle it with the the tractor

611
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:31,600
loader

612
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:34,799
bucket we can load it with the tractor

613
00:25:31,600 --> 00:25:38,559
loader we it's not pumpable

614
00:25:34,799 --> 00:25:42,000
so it actually works quite well for

615
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:44,880
the the digester manure

616
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:47,200
we're actually taking a fair amount of

617
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:48,240
methane capability within that manure

618
00:25:47,200 --> 00:25:50,480
because it

619
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:52,480
is a little on the thicker side that

620
00:25:50,480 --> 00:25:56,080
helps offset some of the

621
00:25:52,480 --> 00:25:59,600
cost of transportation to make it

622
00:25:56,080 --> 00:26:01,919
uh viable betting pack

623
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:02,799
manure that's our main carbon source

624
00:26:01,919 --> 00:26:06,000
that's where

625
00:26:02,799 --> 00:26:08,960
a lot of the energy is coming from to

626
00:26:06,000 --> 00:26:10,960
make the compost

627
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:12,880
here's a picture of the separated solids

628
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:14,000
notice that's that's very stackable

629
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,320
that's the

630
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:19,279
the separated um solids parts that come

631
00:26:18,320 --> 00:26:22,840
out of the

632
00:26:19,279 --> 00:26:25,840
the liquid that goes to the to the

633
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:25,840
digester

634
00:26:26,799 --> 00:26:31,360
when we build our windrows we are

635
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:33,120
loading the different types of manure

636
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,080
and what you're seeing here in this

637
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,799
picture is um

638
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:39,360
the tractor or the spreader that we load

639
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:43,120
this

640
00:26:39,360 --> 00:26:46,720
uh this um

641
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,200
manure into is kind of a multi-faceted

642
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,000
machine

643
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:50,559
for us that that same spreader is used

644
00:26:50,000 --> 00:26:53,760
to haul

645
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:55,360
the manure the scrapings to the digester

646
00:26:53,760 --> 00:26:58,720
on a daily basis

647
00:26:55,360 --> 00:27:01,679
hauls the fiber back also builds

648
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:03,679
helps us build the windrows as well as

649
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:05,919
spread the finished compost

650
00:27:03,679 --> 00:27:06,960
so we're this machine we're getting a

651
00:27:05,919 --> 00:27:10,000
lot of use out of

652
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:11,760
on our farm very important when you add

653
00:27:10,000 --> 00:27:14,880
the extra steps

654
00:27:11,760 --> 00:27:18,399
to the composting process

655
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:20,399
so that you have that you're not adding

656
00:27:18,399 --> 00:27:23,120
a lot of equipment cost that's not

657
00:27:20,399 --> 00:27:23,120
being used

658
00:27:26,720 --> 00:27:32,880
the the loader then

659
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:34,720
we load the three different the two

660
00:27:32,880 --> 00:27:36,880
ingredients system we're really only

661
00:27:34,720 --> 00:27:40,480
using two ingredients here now

662
00:27:36,880 --> 00:27:43,039
is the bedding pack manure um

663
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:43,840
and the separated solids after that's

664
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,039
loaded

665
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,600
in the spreader the mix we are using

666
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:52,000
right now

667
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:55,279
is three parts fiber one part

668
00:27:52,000 --> 00:27:56,000
uh bedding pack we then build our

669
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:58,640
windrows

670
00:27:56,000 --> 00:27:59,600
so you can see this we back the spreader

671
00:27:58,640 --> 00:28:02,799
up to

672
00:27:59,600 --> 00:28:05,360
the windrow open the back gate and as we

673
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:08,960
spread it it makes this perfect pyramid

674
00:28:05,360 --> 00:28:12,640
uh this this this uh

675
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:15,919
that is uh basically what we want

676
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:19,039
to make a good compost windrower

677
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:21,919
or to start the composting process uh we

678
00:28:19,039 --> 00:28:24,480
get a good mix of these two materials

679
00:28:21,919 --> 00:28:26,000
uh early on we don't have to turn it to

680
00:28:24,480 --> 00:28:28,640
get this mix

681
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:29,120
usually we are building a windrow week

682
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,840
we are

683
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:33,520
finishing a win roll week based on the

684
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:36,799
amount of manure we have

685
00:28:33,520 --> 00:28:39,279
and so this this

686
00:28:36,799 --> 00:28:41,120
win roll will sit for about a week

687
00:28:39,279 --> 00:28:43,760
before it gets actually turned with the

688
00:28:41,120 --> 00:28:46,320
compost turner

689
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,440
once we start the compost turning uh

690
00:28:46,320 --> 00:28:51,520
process

691
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:55,200
uh we'll turn uh

692
00:28:51,520 --> 00:28:58,480
usually weekly we will hit that sweet

693
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:59,520
sweet spot of when we're got good

694
00:28:58,480 --> 00:29:03,679
temperatures we'll

695
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:07,279
turn five times in the matter of uh

696
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:12,080
two weeks process to maintain that 135

697
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:15,200
degree temperature at all times

698
00:29:12,080 --> 00:29:16,399
here's a site of the finished compost

699
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:19,120
we've got

700
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:20,320
compost outside here you can notice the

701
00:29:19,120 --> 00:29:23,679
strength the

702
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:26,799
the color the size of

703
00:29:23,679 --> 00:29:29,840
the reduction obviously

704
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:32,159
in volume uh and then under the shed

705
00:29:29,840 --> 00:29:34,399
roof here or the compost building

706
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:36,720
the windrow farthest to the right is the

707
00:29:34,399 --> 00:29:41,120
one that's the closest to finish

708
00:29:36,720 --> 00:29:44,960
and the other two are

709
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,960
you know got a couple weeks to go yet

710
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:50,720
transportation and staging of the

711
00:29:47,840 --> 00:29:50,720
compost so

712
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:59,039
our farm we we have land that varies

713
00:29:55,840 --> 00:30:02,320
from two miles to

714
00:29:59,039 --> 00:30:04,159
ten miles from the home farm so

715
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:05,679
we have to transport some of this

716
00:30:04,159 --> 00:30:09,440
compost some

717
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:09,760
a fair distance and when we do it we try

718
00:30:09,440 --> 00:30:12,320
to

719
00:30:09,760 --> 00:30:14,240
load it as efficiently and haul it as

720
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:15,840
efficiently as possible

721
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:18,240
haul it to the field it's going to get

722
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:19,360
spread on so when we get into that field

723
00:30:18,240 --> 00:30:21,440
to spread it

724
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:23,679
that we're not wasting any time that

725
00:30:21,440 --> 00:30:28,480
we're basically loading and spreading

726
00:30:23,679 --> 00:30:28,480
and making full um

727
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:33,360
efficiency of both the loader and the

728
00:30:32,720 --> 00:30:36,080
spreader

729
00:30:33,360 --> 00:30:36,880
when we go into the spreading process

730
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,279
but here

731
00:30:36,880 --> 00:30:40,559
on the right hand side you can see what

732
00:30:39,279 --> 00:30:45,120
a windrow looks like

733
00:30:40,559 --> 00:30:45,120
in the field this time of the year

734
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,000
scrape away the snow so we can put it on

735
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:54,559
basically on top of the dirt and in our

736
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:58,240
situation we don't take it

737
00:30:54,559 --> 00:31:00,799
to uh to a finished

738
00:30:58,240 --> 00:31:01,440
compost state like you'd put in a bag so

739
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,919
it will

740
00:31:01,440 --> 00:31:04,640
heat a little bit yet out in the field

741
00:31:03,919 --> 00:31:08,080
and

742
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,720
i guess you could say it can condition

743
00:31:08,080 --> 00:31:10,960
it or

744
00:31:08,720 --> 00:31:13,279
or just do the last finishing in the

745
00:31:10,960 --> 00:31:13,279
field

746
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:18,000
and then the spreading uh here you see

747
00:31:16,000 --> 00:31:21,600
the same machine

748
00:31:18,000 --> 00:31:23,679
we put spinners into the under the back

749
00:31:21,600 --> 00:31:27,840
of the spreader

750
00:31:23,679 --> 00:31:30,559
able to spread up to about 80 feet

751
00:31:27,840 --> 00:31:30,960
real consistently with this spreader and

752
00:31:30,559 --> 00:31:33,760
this

753
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:35,039
picture shows us spreading it on grassy

754
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:38,240
hayfield

755
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:40,320
and the biggest thing that i've noticed

756
00:31:38,240 --> 00:31:42,880
when we're spreading compost

757
00:31:40,320 --> 00:31:43,679
is that you don't paint the ground like

758
00:31:42,880 --> 00:31:47,760
you do with

759
00:31:43,679 --> 00:31:51,760
when you're typically hauling a manure

760
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,919
with like a slinger spreader or um

761
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:55,200
or a box spreader it's just you don't

762
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:57,919
have the you don't

763
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:59,039
have the volume to do that but yet

764
00:31:57,919 --> 00:32:01,120
you're getting

765
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,640
probably as much nutrients if not more

766
00:32:01,120 --> 00:32:06,159
onto the field

767
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:09,360
and being a lot less visible

768
00:32:06,159 --> 00:32:13,360
visible for the byspan

769
00:32:09,360 --> 00:32:16,720
the public as well any questions here or

770
00:32:13,360 --> 00:32:21,039
some questions to catch up on

771
00:32:16,720 --> 00:32:24,799
okay how do your costs compare to the

772
00:32:21,039 --> 00:32:27,039
traditional soil management so

773
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:29,200
one of what we're finding is here is

774
00:32:27,039 --> 00:32:30,480
that we're actually

775
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,480
we're going to get into it a little bit

776
00:32:30,480 --> 00:32:35,120
later but our

777
00:32:32,480 --> 00:32:35,120
nutrients

778
00:32:35,840 --> 00:32:43,039
i can haul compost to the field

779
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:46,320
much further than i can liquid manure

780
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:49,279
and to get the value out of it so

781
00:32:46,320 --> 00:32:50,799
for instance a load of compost on a

782
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:54,159
straight truck could

783
00:32:50,799 --> 00:32:57,360
probably worth about 600 bucks

784
00:32:54,159 --> 00:33:00,320
in fertilizer value the

785
00:32:57,360 --> 00:33:01,440
same payload and liquid might be about

786
00:33:00,320 --> 00:33:05,120
65

787
00:33:01,440 --> 00:33:08,640
to 80 a load so therefore

788
00:33:05,120 --> 00:33:11,600
i can haul that nutrients further before

789
00:33:08,640 --> 00:33:13,760
the value of that of that nutrients is

790
00:33:11,600 --> 00:33:16,559
gone

791
00:33:13,760 --> 00:33:18,159
we also are seeing reduction in the

792
00:33:16,559 --> 00:33:20,480
amount of fertilizer

793
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,720
we have to put on to the purchase and

794
00:33:20,480 --> 00:33:24,640
put onto fields because we are used

795
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,600
better utilizing the nutrients within

796
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:27,600
the farm system

797
00:33:30,480 --> 00:33:35,279
the challenges with winter composting is

798
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,440
moisture

799
00:33:35,279 --> 00:33:38,399
and that's one of the questions here as

800
00:33:37,440 --> 00:33:42,080
well

801
00:33:38,399 --> 00:33:46,240
and we tend to

802
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:48,080
to in our our setup here is we try to go

803
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:50,840
in with drier

804
00:33:48,080 --> 00:33:52,799
carbon sources to begin with if if

805
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,799
possible um

806
00:33:52,799 --> 00:33:55,840
art of compost generally runs higher in

807
00:33:54,799 --> 00:33:59,200
moisture

808
00:33:55,840 --> 00:34:02,880
in the winter months um there are

809
00:33:59,200 --> 00:34:05,279
some uh opportunities out there

810
00:34:02,880 --> 00:34:08,320
to put aeration under the windrows if

811
00:34:05,279 --> 00:34:12,639
you want to spend the money

812
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:16,879
we turn more often in the winter

813
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:16,879
we also try to

814
00:34:17,119 --> 00:34:22,480
do it in a way that

815
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:24,720
the moisture leaves the pile so i don't

816
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:27,839
like to turn on days where

817
00:34:24,720 --> 00:34:30,800
where it's cold real cold

818
00:34:27,839 --> 00:34:32,560
if we don't have to uh just so that

819
00:34:30,800 --> 00:34:35,839
moisture gets away from

820
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,839
the pile

821
00:34:35,919 --> 00:34:39,760
uh the npk analysis of the finished

822
00:34:38,320 --> 00:34:41,760
compost i'm going to share that a little

823
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:43,440
bit later we have some variation we have

824
00:34:41,760 --> 00:34:46,480
some carbon nitrogen ratios

825
00:34:43,440 --> 00:34:46,879
that i'll be sharing later as and as

826
00:34:46,480 --> 00:34:49,839
well

827
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,839
so

828
00:34:52,000 --> 00:34:58,160
now the economics

829
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,280
this is probably

830
00:34:58,160 --> 00:35:01,599
this is something that's really

831
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:05,680
important to understand

832
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:08,160
and we we performed

833
00:35:05,680 --> 00:35:10,640
some economics early on with the

834
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:12,720
community composting grant

835
00:35:10,640 --> 00:35:14,400
i went through this winter and and i've

836
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:17,440
kind of updated that

837
00:35:14,400 --> 00:35:19,440
to what we're able to be how those

838
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:20,400
economics are working for our farm right

839
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,119
now

840
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:25,680
um now that we've ramped up our our

841
00:35:23,119 --> 00:35:25,680
production

842
00:35:29,119 --> 00:35:34,000
so if you look at the cost analysis of

843
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:39,119
traditional manure handling

844
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:39,119
we have here we have a

845
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,160
chart or a cost breakdown in a couple

846
00:35:42,720 --> 00:35:46,400
different categories i'm going to start

847
00:35:44,160 --> 00:35:48,880
with the top one here

848
00:35:46,400 --> 00:35:50,960
so in this cost analysis we've actually

849
00:35:48,880 --> 00:35:53,200
took the value of the

850
00:35:50,960 --> 00:35:55,200
of the betting stock or the betting that

851
00:35:53,200 --> 00:35:58,640
was going into the manure

852
00:35:55,200 --> 00:36:02,880
and the amount of bales and so forth

853
00:35:58,640 --> 00:36:06,400
and in this case it showed it was 504

854
00:36:02,880 --> 00:36:09,520
uh dollars in value that's probably

855
00:36:06,400 --> 00:36:09,520
going up a little bit

856
00:36:09,920 --> 00:36:15,839
this particular cost analysis was done

857
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:19,040
on basically 467 cubic yards of

858
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:21,680
betting pack manure coming out of the

859
00:36:19,040 --> 00:36:21,680
facility

860
00:36:22,640 --> 00:36:26,000
we go down to the actual cost of

861
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:29,359
scraping

862
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:32,160
and cleaning the barn

863
00:36:29,359 --> 00:36:32,160
and the labor

864
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,760
and then we look at the total cost of

865
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:38,720
the manure

866
00:36:35,760 --> 00:36:39,359
so the total cost to clean out that barn

867
00:36:38,720 --> 00:36:42,480
and

868
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:45,920
build the windrows in this situation

869
00:36:42,480 --> 00:36:46,960
uh or we're just cleaning the barn i

870
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:48,720
should say in this cost

871
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:51,200
scenario and hauling it directly to the

872
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,960
field so the total cost was over three

873
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,160
thousand dollars

874
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:59,200
um but the cost per yard

875
00:36:56,160 --> 00:37:01,440
was six dollars and 51 cents so that's

876
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:05,200
what it would typically cost

877
00:37:01,440 --> 00:37:06,720
to in our if we would be hauling this

878
00:37:05,200 --> 00:37:09,839
cleaning this barn and hauling it

879
00:37:06,720 --> 00:37:09,839
directly to the field

880
00:37:10,400 --> 00:37:13,920
and that's more of the typical way of of

881
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:18,079
handling

882
00:37:13,920 --> 00:37:21,119
betting pack manure if we add the com

883
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:23,760
compost process to it you know we're

884
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,280
going to we've got the turning expense

885
00:37:23,760 --> 00:37:27,280
we have there we should actually have

886
00:37:25,280 --> 00:37:32,079
the facility cost

887
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:37,200
um so um

888
00:37:32,079 --> 00:37:40,560
and then we have the cost of the turner

889
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:44,079
in the top box here

890
00:37:40,560 --> 00:37:47,280
loading the compost at the barn again

891
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:49,280
to move it further out reloading the

892
00:37:47,280 --> 00:37:51,839
compost on the tubby spreader for

893
00:37:49,280 --> 00:37:51,839
spreading

894
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:58,960
that's what we figured the cost there

895
00:37:56,240 --> 00:37:58,960
total cost

896
00:37:59,599 --> 00:38:04,720
the total cost to produce haul and

897
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:05,280
spread the compost it was like forty

898
00:38:04,720 --> 00:38:07,599
eight

899
00:38:05,280 --> 00:38:09,359
hundred and seventy seven dollars you

900
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:10,960
noticed on the page before it was right

901
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:13,440
around three thousand dollars just to

902
00:38:10,960 --> 00:38:17,040
haul it directly to the field

903
00:38:13,440 --> 00:38:20,320
if we take that on a on a

904
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:23,520
on a per cubic yard uh

905
00:38:20,320 --> 00:38:25,520
price to spread the compost to the field

906
00:38:23,520 --> 00:38:27,720
at that time we were estimating it was

907
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:32,079
costing

908
00:38:27,720 --> 00:38:35,280
21.77 cents per cubic

909
00:38:32,079 --> 00:38:39,280
yard to

910
00:38:35,280 --> 00:38:41,520
to haul or to make and haul that compost

911
00:38:39,280 --> 00:38:43,599
on the field if we were to load that

912
00:38:41,520 --> 00:38:44,640
compost and not take it to the field and

913
00:38:43,599 --> 00:38:47,440
just sell it

914
00:38:44,640 --> 00:38:52,000
we were figuring the cost net cost of

915
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,000
production would be about 18.97

916
00:38:53,280 --> 00:39:01,599
so 1897 if we convert that to

917
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:04,960
a per ton cost because most of

918
00:39:01,599 --> 00:39:07,760
our analysis are done on a per ton

919
00:39:04,960 --> 00:39:08,960
basis for when you send your compost off

920
00:39:07,760 --> 00:39:11,920
to get an

921
00:39:08,960 --> 00:39:13,119
analysis on it comes back the nitrogen

922
00:39:11,920 --> 00:39:16,560
the phosphorus and

923
00:39:13,119 --> 00:39:20,160
the potassium are tabulated

924
00:39:16,560 --> 00:39:22,400
as a per ton basis being that a yard of

925
00:39:20,160 --> 00:39:26,160
compost doesn't weigh a ton

926
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:28,880
it comes out to 32.31 cents per

927
00:39:26,160 --> 00:39:30,480
s per ton spread on the field under this

928
00:39:28,880 --> 00:39:33,839
scenario

929
00:39:30,480 --> 00:39:36,880
if we were to just uh sell it

930
00:39:33,839 --> 00:39:37,440
uh and put it on a truck it would be 29

931
00:39:36,880 --> 00:39:40,800
18

932
00:39:37,440 --> 00:39:43,040
a ton for those costs

933
00:39:40,800 --> 00:39:45,520
so those those costs have to be made up

934
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:45,520
somewhere

935
00:39:47,440 --> 00:39:52,960
so the compost uh comparison direct call

936
00:39:50,320 --> 00:39:55,760
to the field versus finishing compost

937
00:39:52,960 --> 00:39:56,079
we are seeing about six dollars right

938
00:39:55,760 --> 00:39:58,079
now

939
00:39:56,079 --> 00:40:00,800
six dollars and fifty cents a yard to

940
00:39:58,079 --> 00:40:03,839
convert the manure into compost

941
00:40:00,800 --> 00:40:07,599
or ten dollars a ton for the finished

942
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:09,119
compost mold it's costing ten dollars

943
00:40:07,599 --> 00:40:10,800
more a ton

944
00:40:09,119 --> 00:40:13,839
to do it if rather than just haul it

945
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:13,839
directly to the field

946
00:40:14,160 --> 00:40:18,240
now some cost analysis based off of

947
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:22,480
where we are today now

948
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:24,480
and now as of now as you

949
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:26,480
the shed the interest appreciation and

950
00:40:24,480 --> 00:40:30,319
principle i figured i based this all on

951
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:32,319
a per yard basis i figured it was 244.

952
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:33,680
uh building the compost windrow that

953
00:40:32,319 --> 00:40:36,000
would be

954
00:40:33,680 --> 00:40:38,079
as i showed you in the pictures earlier

955
00:40:36,000 --> 00:40:40,319
the loading of the manure the different

956
00:40:38,079 --> 00:40:41,920
ingredients onto the spreader and

957
00:40:40,319 --> 00:40:44,560
running it back out

958
00:40:41,920 --> 00:40:45,760
i figure it's about two dollars per yard

959
00:40:44,560 --> 00:40:49,359
turning the compost

960
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:51,839
eight times two dollars and fifty

961
00:40:49,359 --> 00:40:53,920
cents per yard loading the finished

962
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:56,960
compost for field spreading

963
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:58,640
or sale uh we have we're a little more

964
00:40:56,960 --> 00:40:59,440
efficient with that now we got a bigger

965
00:40:58,640 --> 00:41:02,800
loader

966
00:40:59,440 --> 00:41:05,920
uh a dollar fifty per yard so

967
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:08,960
our totals as of what we're making now

968
00:41:05,920 --> 00:41:10,000
is about eight dollars and 44 cents per

969
00:41:08,960 --> 00:41:14,880
yard

970
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:14,880
to make it into compost

971
00:41:18,240 --> 00:41:23,599
just to make the compost and load it the

972
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,520
cost of spreading the compost we figure

973
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,680
up to two miles which is three dollars

974
00:41:25,520 --> 00:41:29,599
and eighty cents per yard

975
00:41:27,680 --> 00:41:31,040
so therefore we've got it delivered and

976
00:41:29,599 --> 00:41:33,119
spread to the field

977
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:35,839
for twelve dollars and twenty four cents

978
00:41:33,119 --> 00:41:35,839
a yard

979
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:43,520
or 18.83 cents per

980
00:41:40,400 --> 00:41:43,520
per finish ton

981
00:41:47,520 --> 00:41:52,240
cost analysis then versus now we're

982
00:41:50,240 --> 00:41:57,040
looking at 32 tons

983
00:41:52,240 --> 00:42:02,000
uh 32.31 cents a ton

984
00:41:57,040 --> 00:42:06,319
spread on the field uh

985
00:42:02,000 --> 00:42:10,000
versus the 18.44

986
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:13,359
per ton for now so here we're

987
00:42:10,000 --> 00:42:14,400
here we are looking at a value of the

988
00:42:13,359 --> 00:42:16,400
compost that's

989
00:42:14,400 --> 00:42:18,160
the questionnaire what are the np's and

990
00:42:16,400 --> 00:42:21,040
k's uh

991
00:42:18,160 --> 00:42:22,720
in this situation this uh this was done

992
00:42:21,040 --> 00:42:26,640
in 2016

993
00:42:22,720 --> 00:42:28,160
um on a per ton basis on this particular

994
00:42:26,640 --> 00:42:31,040
analysis

995
00:42:28,160 --> 00:42:32,800
we figured the value of the nitrogen uh

996
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:37,119
was 12.87

997
00:42:32,800 --> 00:42:38,000
cents per ton the phosphorus was 6.92

998
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:44,079
cents

999
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:47,839
per ton the potassium was 7.99 per ton

1000
00:42:44,079 --> 00:42:51,200
the sulfur was a dollar 51 a ton

1001
00:42:47,839 --> 00:42:54,240
calcium was 5.05 per ton

1002
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:56,960
magnesium was 350 per ton

1003
00:42:54,240 --> 00:42:58,319
and then if you take all the others less

1004
00:42:56,960 --> 00:43:00,720
significant numbers for

1005
00:42:58,319 --> 00:43:01,680
analysis but it's still important to the

1006
00:43:00,720 --> 00:43:03,680
crop

1007
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,119
the boron the zinc the copper the

1008
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:08,400
magnesium

1009
00:43:05,119 --> 00:43:12,000
the maliburum um

1010
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:15,520
the total value of that compost comes up

1011
00:43:12,000 --> 00:43:17,760
to 41.79 per ton

1012
00:43:15,520 --> 00:43:20,160
so there's still some extra value above

1013
00:43:17,760 --> 00:43:25,520
and beyond the production

1014
00:43:20,160 --> 00:43:29,040
for that that particular compost

1015
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:31,839
there's a difference in compost um

1016
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:33,280
now here we've been playing around with

1017
00:43:31,839 --> 00:43:36,319
different feedstocks

1018
00:43:33,280 --> 00:43:37,839
going into the compost some are create

1019
00:43:36,319 --> 00:43:40,480
higher compost

1020
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:41,760
numbers than others moisture has a lot

1021
00:43:40,480 --> 00:43:45,599
to do with it

1022
00:43:41,760 --> 00:43:47,680
uh if you look at the upper left-hand

1023
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:49,280
column here we've got a compost sample

1024
00:43:47,680 --> 00:43:51,040
that runs 69

1025
00:43:49,280 --> 00:43:54,160
moisture that's a little on the high

1026
00:43:51,040 --> 00:43:57,760
side you're looking at the nitrogen

1027
00:43:54,160 --> 00:44:00,960
at nine nine point three nine

1028
00:43:57,760 --> 00:44:01,680
per ton uh total phosphorus at eight

1029
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:05,680
point five

1030
00:44:01,680 --> 00:44:09,839
four ton potassium 9.94

1031
00:44:05,680 --> 00:44:12,319
and sulfur 1.79

1032
00:44:09,839 --> 00:44:13,359
you take the sample in the lower right

1033
00:44:12,319 --> 00:44:16,240
hand corner

1034
00:44:13,359 --> 00:44:18,560
now this is 41 percent moisture

1035
00:44:16,240 --> 00:44:20,720
considerably drier

1036
00:44:18,560 --> 00:44:22,480
all of a sudden with the feedstock in

1037
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:26,079
this particular case

1038
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:29,359
we've got nitrogen at 3181

1039
00:44:26,079 --> 00:44:33,599
we got phosphorus at 2846

1040
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:37,680
and potassium at 56 16

1041
00:44:33,599 --> 00:44:40,319
and sulfur at 783

1042
00:44:37,680 --> 00:44:41,599
there's a couple things that could play

1043
00:44:40,319 --> 00:44:44,480
into this

1044
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:45,839
the carbon the nitrogen ratio obviously

1045
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:48,319
the moisture is number one

1046
00:44:45,839 --> 00:44:50,720
the carbon the nitrogen ratio of the

1047
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:53,200
first sample was 14 to 1.

1048
00:44:50,720 --> 00:44:55,280
the carbon and nitrogen ratio of the

1049
00:44:53,200 --> 00:44:58,480
second sample is 11 the one

1050
00:44:55,280 --> 00:45:01,599
so the one in the lower right

1051
00:44:58,480 --> 00:45:04,240
is more finished and drier

1052
00:45:01,599 --> 00:45:06,319
uh the feedstock going into it might

1053
00:45:04,240 --> 00:45:09,359
have been higher in

1054
00:45:06,319 --> 00:45:10,640
np and k to begin with as well so that's

1055
00:45:09,359 --> 00:45:14,400
why now

1056
00:45:10,640 --> 00:45:17,440
in our um recipe we've kind of got it

1057
00:45:14,400 --> 00:45:21,119
zeroed in to just that

1058
00:45:17,440 --> 00:45:23,200
three three to one ratio then we uh

1059
00:45:21,119 --> 00:45:24,160
we got a more consistent product coming

1060
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:28,000
out

1061
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:30,319
um that also has been made better

1062
00:45:28,000 --> 00:45:31,200
because we are making our windrows with

1063
00:45:30,319 --> 00:45:33,839
the

1064
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:34,560
with the spreader uh versus a loader

1065
00:45:33,839 --> 00:45:37,839
tractor

1066
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:40,319
we have a much better job of having a

1067
00:45:37,839 --> 00:45:43,359
consistent windrow from end to end

1068
00:45:40,319 --> 00:45:44,000
we don't have that inconsistency of

1069
00:45:43,359 --> 00:45:46,880
maybe

1070
00:45:44,000 --> 00:45:48,000
we have a hot spot in in the middle of

1071
00:45:46,880 --> 00:45:50,800
the wind roll where

1072
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,680
it got a little bit more of this uh

1073
00:45:50,800 --> 00:45:55,119
higher

1074
00:45:51,680 --> 00:45:56,160
higher uh uh fertility feedstock to

1075
00:45:55,119 --> 00:45:57,839
begin with and

1076
00:45:56,160 --> 00:46:00,240
all of a sudden we've pulled a sample

1077
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:04,960
out of out of that area so

1078
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:09,359
we're more we're more consistent now

1079
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:09,359
than than we were previous

1080
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:12,960
compost analysis is by the season so

1081
00:46:12,400 --> 00:46:16,400
what this

1082
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:20,560
is is what is how are

1083
00:46:16,400 --> 00:46:23,280
our compost uh testing by the season

1084
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:25,680
the one on the left i think as i break

1085
00:46:23,280 --> 00:46:28,160
down him

1086
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:28,720
you have the average moisture the actual

1087
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:32,079
heist

1088
00:46:28,720 --> 00:46:33,359
so this is a series of samples we sample

1089
00:46:32,079 --> 00:46:35,280
every windrow

1090
00:46:33,359 --> 00:46:38,000
so we took the high windrow and the low

1091
00:46:35,280 --> 00:46:41,440
windrow and then we have an average

1092
00:46:38,000 --> 00:46:44,880
so if you got the moisture content

1093
00:46:41,440 --> 00:46:49,920
you know the average is 56. uh

1094
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:51,599
organic matter 24 ph 9.5

1095
00:46:49,920 --> 00:46:55,680
our ph is seem to run a little bit

1096
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:57,520
higher even on the real finished compost

1097
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:59,760
and then you can see the average is for

1098
00:46:57,520 --> 00:47:03,680
the n p and k

1099
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:07,200
um and then on the bottom you can see

1100
00:47:03,680 --> 00:47:09,839
uh how the nitrogen and ammonium and

1101
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:13,200
uh the organic end and so forth and the

1102
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:13,200
carbon to nitrogen ratio

1103
00:47:13,359 --> 00:47:17,440
spring now the spring compost would be

1104
00:47:15,280 --> 00:47:18,400
the compost that would be being made

1105
00:47:17,440 --> 00:47:21,680
right now

1106
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,480
in the months of january and february uh

1107
00:47:21,680 --> 00:47:26,640
the summer compost would be basically

1108
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:29,200
the compost that's being made

1109
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:31,520
in early spring and then the fall

1110
00:47:29,200 --> 00:47:34,640
compost would be

1111
00:47:31,520 --> 00:47:39,359
the compost that's being made

1112
00:47:34,640 --> 00:47:40,640
in the summer and the winter compost

1113
00:47:39,359 --> 00:47:44,720
would be

1114
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:47,839
what is being started in the fall

1115
00:47:44,720 --> 00:47:51,760
if you look at the summer compost

1116
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:56,720
the moisture goes down six percent

1117
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:56,720
have a little bit higher

1118
00:47:59,920 --> 00:48:04,590
numbers as far as the potassium nitrogen

1119
00:48:03,359 --> 00:48:05,839
is down

1120
00:48:04,590 --> 00:48:08,960
[Music]

1121
00:48:05,839 --> 00:48:10,800
this particular case the phosphorus is

1122
00:48:08,960 --> 00:48:12,480
is a little bit lower but then that

1123
00:48:10,800 --> 00:48:15,520
spring compost we had

1124
00:48:12,480 --> 00:48:17,280
and that we had a ingredient in that uh

1125
00:48:15,520 --> 00:48:20,520
high one that really pushed the

1126
00:48:17,280 --> 00:48:23,599
phosphorus so that one's a little

1127
00:48:20,520 --> 00:48:26,480
a little out of whack there so

1128
00:48:23,599 --> 00:48:28,079
um again then on the bottom in this

1129
00:48:26,480 --> 00:48:32,160
particular case

1130
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:35,680
uh we didn't have uh as much of a

1131
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:37,440
breakdown on the organic and

1132
00:48:35,680 --> 00:48:41,760
but the total carbon or the carbon

1133
00:48:37,440 --> 00:48:44,559
nitrogen ratio was 13.26

1134
00:48:41,760 --> 00:48:44,559
for an average

1135
00:48:44,960 --> 00:48:50,000
we take the fall now here here is that

1136
00:48:48,400 --> 00:48:52,640
that material that's being made in the

1137
00:48:50,000 --> 00:48:56,640
summer notice it's drier on an average

1138
00:48:52,640 --> 00:48:59,839
we had a high of 56 and a low of 38

1139
00:48:56,640 --> 00:49:03,520
if you look at those numbers

1140
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:08,400
we have a variation there

1141
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:12,960
ph again is still still up there

1142
00:49:08,400 --> 00:49:12,960
nitrogen on the high one was pretty high

1143
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:18,960
the phosphorus is is relatively high on

1144
00:49:16,640 --> 00:49:22,640
the high one as well but uh

1145
00:49:18,960 --> 00:49:24,960
um if if we can duplicate that

1146
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,119
in a mix now we got something that we

1147
00:49:24,960 --> 00:49:27,839
can justify hauling even further out

1148
00:49:27,119 --> 00:49:32,240
than

1149
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:36,079
than uh your standard compost so

1150
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:37,200
there are ways to to spice this compost

1151
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:39,839
up a little bit

1152
00:49:37,200 --> 00:49:41,760
to have a little more value in it based

1153
00:49:39,839 --> 00:49:43,119
on the feedstock that's going in it and

1154
00:49:41,760 --> 00:49:44,880
how we treat it

1155
00:49:43,119 --> 00:49:50,160
again on the bottom carbon and nitrogen

1156
00:49:44,880 --> 00:49:50,160
ratio on these we're averaging 11.47

1157
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,200
now winter

1158
00:49:53,839 --> 00:49:57,359
there's the moisture there's our big

1159
00:49:55,599 --> 00:49:58,160
that's my biggest challenge is the

1160
00:49:57,359 --> 00:50:00,880
winter

1161
00:49:58,160 --> 00:50:03,839
compost is dealing with the moisture and

1162
00:50:00,880 --> 00:50:07,839
not having that pile go stagnant on us

1163
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:11,440
and 68 is getting up there

1164
00:50:07,839 --> 00:50:14,160
i always kind of fall on the

1165
00:50:11,440 --> 00:50:15,920
rule of thumb that making compost is

1166
00:50:14,160 --> 00:50:18,960
like making silage

1167
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:20,720
um if it's too wet it

1168
00:50:18,960 --> 00:50:22,319
doesn't work well in a ration if it's

1169
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,119
too dry it doesn't work well in the

1170
00:50:22,319 --> 00:50:24,960
ration

1171
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:28,240
so if you can keep it somewhere between

1172
00:50:24,960 --> 00:50:32,079
55 and 65 you've got a really good

1173
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:34,800
working range here you can see the

1174
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:37,760
averages on that

1175
00:50:34,800 --> 00:50:41,520
you know our high had a had a carbon to

1176
00:50:37,760 --> 00:50:43,520
nitrogen ratio at the bottom of 16.36

1177
00:50:41,520 --> 00:50:46,240
that's probably not finished real well

1178
00:50:43,520 --> 00:50:47,920
that was 72 percent moisture that's

1179
00:50:46,240 --> 00:50:50,559
probably why

1180
00:50:47,920 --> 00:50:53,040
the one that was 61 had a carbon to

1181
00:50:50,559 --> 00:50:54,319
nitrogen ratio of 11.2 that's more

1182
00:50:53,040 --> 00:51:00,319
acceptable

1183
00:50:54,319 --> 00:51:00,319
and you know the average was 13.83

1184
00:51:01,599 --> 00:51:09,839
now that was a lot of stuff do we have

1185
00:51:03,359 --> 00:51:09,839
any questions on that

1186
00:51:10,480 --> 00:51:12,800
okay

1187
00:51:14,800 --> 00:51:19,440
okay so are the carbon nitrogen nitrogen

1188
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:23,520
ratios from

1189
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:26,160
a start or end of the compost process so

1190
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:27,520
carbon and nitrogen ratios on ours are

1191
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,200
usually start around

1192
00:51:27,520 --> 00:51:34,240
at 30 30 to 1 when it's fresh

1193
00:51:31,200 --> 00:51:34,240
made in the windrow

1194
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,280
we always kind of figure the way we're

1195
00:51:37,359 --> 00:51:41,440
using it out in the field not

1196
00:51:39,280 --> 00:51:45,280
necessarily selling it as

1197
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:48,800
a class a compost anytime it's below

1198
00:51:45,280 --> 00:51:52,240
15 to 1 i feel

1199
00:51:48,800 --> 00:51:54,319
it's time to move it out um we're

1200
00:51:52,240 --> 00:51:57,599
getting the value of the

1201
00:51:54,319 --> 00:51:59,680
the uh pathogen kill at that point

1202
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:02,400
we have a pretty good carbon number

1203
00:51:59,680 --> 00:52:05,920
there um the shrink is there

1204
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:08,880
um and we just

1205
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:08,880
i just don't want to

1206
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:13,599
put any more time and money into it than

1207
00:52:11,599 --> 00:52:16,880
i absolutely have to

1208
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:19,680
if i was to sell the compost

1209
00:52:16,880 --> 00:52:20,720
we would probably then have to spend a

1210
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:24,960
little more time

1211
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:26,559
with it the ideal carbon and nitrogen

1212
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:30,319
ratio

1213
00:52:26,559 --> 00:52:33,359
is uh from what i understand is anywhere

1214
00:52:30,319 --> 00:52:35,040
15 and lower it's very hard to get

1215
00:52:33,359 --> 00:52:38,480
carbon to nitrogen ratios

1216
00:52:35,040 --> 00:52:40,559
uh under 10. so when she's getting down

1217
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,960
to that 11 range you've got a pretty

1218
00:52:40,559 --> 00:52:44,079
good

1219
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:46,880
finished compost that's when it's

1220
00:52:44,079 --> 00:52:48,400
really black in color the texture is his

1221
00:52:46,880 --> 00:52:51,680
uh particle size is real

1222
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:55,280
small it's got that real earthy smell

1223
00:52:51,680 --> 00:52:58,079
um those are what that's

1224
00:52:55,280 --> 00:53:01,839
to me is some of the best uh based on

1225
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,839
the visual and the smell

1226
00:53:03,359 --> 00:53:09,119
can you explain about the compost turner

1227
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:09,920
i would like to know what model you use

1228
00:53:09,119 --> 00:53:14,319
to have it

1229
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:17,599
custom built so our compost turner

1230
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:20,800
that we built um uh

1231
00:53:17,599 --> 00:53:24,079
it is it does a complete turn

1232
00:53:20,800 --> 00:53:27,520
of the of the compost um

1233
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:30,240
we back into the compost it's there uh

1234
00:53:27,520 --> 00:53:32,000
there's a beater that uh flings it up in

1235
00:53:30,240 --> 00:53:33,440
the air and onto a conveyor belt that

1236
00:53:32,000 --> 00:53:36,960
re-stacks it

1237
00:53:33,440 --> 00:53:38,079
and this uh this turner i i can't talk

1238
00:53:36,960 --> 00:53:40,800
too much about it

1239
00:53:38,079 --> 00:53:41,599
i'm i'm in the process of potentially

1240
00:53:40,800 --> 00:53:45,280
patenting this

1241
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:46,720
turner um but uh it's been working quite

1242
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:49,520
well for us

1243
00:53:46,720 --> 00:53:51,119
and i think part of the reason we're

1244
00:53:49,520 --> 00:53:52,160
able to do some of the things we're

1245
00:53:51,119 --> 00:53:54,640
doing

1246
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:57,839
uh in a timely fashion is because of the

1247
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:57,839
turner itself

1248
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:05,040
the question here is i don't see any

1249
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:05,359
line in your cost analysis for the cost

1250
00:54:05,040 --> 00:54:08,559
of

1251
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:12,400
not turning soluble n and p

1252
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:14,000
into the insoluble or into other words

1253
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:16,720
taking organic and

1254
00:54:14,000 --> 00:54:18,240
and pee and turning it into organic

1255
00:54:16,720 --> 00:54:23,119
therefore making it

1256
00:54:18,240 --> 00:54:23,119
insoluble until root

1257
00:54:23,319 --> 00:54:26,319
extratulates

1258
00:54:26,880 --> 00:54:33,760
call for it real value

1259
00:54:30,480 --> 00:54:35,920
yeah and that one um that's true

1260
00:54:33,760 --> 00:54:37,599
but how do you come up with that number

1261
00:54:35,920 --> 00:54:39,920
that's one of

1262
00:54:37,599 --> 00:54:41,680
some of the things that we still have to

1263
00:54:39,920 --> 00:54:43,839
that i don't quite understand yet

1264
00:54:41,680 --> 00:54:45,760
maybe some of the people that are

1265
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:46,319
listening in maybe have some answers

1266
00:54:45,760 --> 00:54:48,079
because

1267
00:54:46,319 --> 00:54:50,079
uh there are definitely some hidden

1268
00:54:48,079 --> 00:54:54,880
values there that we are

1269
00:54:50,079 --> 00:54:57,040
do not label in our numbers

1270
00:54:54,880 --> 00:54:59,440
a question here is i came in late what

1271
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,680
do you see as a carbon

1272
00:54:59,440 --> 00:55:03,760
what what do you oh what do you use as a

1273
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:07,680
carbon source to manage your

1274
00:55:03,760 --> 00:55:10,640
carbon and nitrogen ratio um

1275
00:55:07,680 --> 00:55:11,520
our main carbon source in our in our

1276
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:15,280
compost here

1277
00:55:11,520 --> 00:55:16,079
is corn stocks um actually betting pack

1278
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:19,280
manure

1279
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:20,079
taken right out of the out of the out of

1280
00:55:19,280 --> 00:55:24,480
the barn

1281
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:27,599
and with either straw or or corn stalks

1282
00:55:24,480 --> 00:55:29,520
has the almost the perfect nitrogen

1283
00:55:27,599 --> 00:55:32,720
carbon and nitrogen ratio to start the

1284
00:55:29,520 --> 00:55:32,720
composting process

1285
00:55:33,119 --> 00:55:39,040
all right caught up on the questions

1286
00:55:37,280 --> 00:55:42,000
and we're going to move on to the next

1287
00:55:39,040 --> 00:55:45,520
section we got another one

1288
00:55:42,000 --> 00:55:46,480
uh what equipment used to measure the

1289
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,839
temperature for

1290
00:55:46,480 --> 00:55:49,839
legal compost

1291
00:55:50,000 --> 00:55:54,079
i am just taking temperatures at this

1292
00:55:52,480 --> 00:55:57,839
point right now

1293
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:59,920
um we'll probably have to invest into

1294
00:55:57,839 --> 00:56:01,599
some more sophisticated equipment if we

1295
00:55:59,920 --> 00:56:02,960
are actually going to start marketing

1296
00:56:01,599 --> 00:56:05,200
compost

1297
00:56:02,960 --> 00:56:06,000
but i'm pretty much falling back on

1298
00:56:05,200 --> 00:56:09,359
temperatures

1299
00:56:06,000 --> 00:56:11,040
and watching temperatures to

1300
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:13,680
make sure we're turning in a timely

1301
00:56:11,040 --> 00:56:15,760
fashion and then

1302
00:56:13,680 --> 00:56:19,119
when temperatures tend to drop and the

1303
00:56:15,760 --> 00:56:19,119
carbon and nitrogen ratio

1304
00:56:19,520 --> 00:56:26,319
goes down that's what we're basing

1305
00:56:22,799 --> 00:56:30,480
our our time to move it out

1306
00:56:26,319 --> 00:56:33,200
or finish turning

1307
00:56:30,480 --> 00:56:33,200
conclusion

1308
00:56:34,000 --> 00:56:37,280
that's what i was saying composting

1309
00:56:35,920 --> 00:56:40,160
unknown value

1310
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:41,520
and here's a list of things that we

1311
00:56:40,160 --> 00:56:43,920
don't know

1312
00:56:41,520 --> 00:56:45,119
and i have a hard time putting a handle

1313
00:56:43,920 --> 00:56:47,200
on

1314
00:56:45,119 --> 00:56:50,400
what is the value of adding compost to

1315
00:56:47,200 --> 00:56:53,839
the soil for soil health purposes

1316
00:56:50,400 --> 00:56:57,280
so we know by taking compost to the

1317
00:56:53,839 --> 00:56:57,280
southern part of the watershed

1318
00:56:57,359 --> 00:57:03,760
back in 2015 and 16

1319
00:57:00,559 --> 00:57:05,760
the farmer applied four ton to the

1320
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:07,839
to the acre at that time a one-time

1321
00:57:05,760 --> 00:57:10,160
application

1322
00:57:07,839 --> 00:57:12,799
the fir from that point the following

1323
00:57:10,160 --> 00:57:16,640
years moving forward up until this year

1324
00:57:12,799 --> 00:57:18,559
even he's seen a yield bump in the area

1325
00:57:16,640 --> 00:57:21,119
within the field where he spread the

1326
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:24,079
compost

1327
00:57:21,119 --> 00:57:24,720
in soybeans and corn both were you know

1328
00:57:24,079 --> 00:57:28,000
pushing

1329
00:57:24,720 --> 00:57:30,559
close to 10 bushels to the acre

1330
00:57:28,000 --> 00:57:32,319
at the high he was still seeing a couple

1331
00:57:30,559 --> 00:57:34,079
bushels this year

1332
00:57:32,319 --> 00:57:36,559
so there's something going on in the

1333
00:57:34,079 --> 00:57:38,079
soil there by introducing compost and

1334
00:57:36,559 --> 00:57:41,440
it's not just the

1335
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:44,400
the the np and k

1336
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,720
that carbon and and organic matter and

1337
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:47,599
and the biology of that compost is doing

1338
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:51,760
something

1339
00:57:47,599 --> 00:57:54,319
uh significant and i'm open

1340
00:57:51,760 --> 00:57:55,119
to anybody that has any more information

1341
00:57:54,319 --> 00:57:57,280
on that

1342
00:57:55,119 --> 00:57:59,200
uh that could share with us and then

1343
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:02,720
it's definitely something we'll be

1344
00:57:59,200 --> 00:58:04,559
working on here closely uh with trials

1345
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:09,440
that come to see if we can

1346
00:58:04,559 --> 00:58:11,119
um actually figure out what's happening

1347
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,359
what is the value of the additional

1348
00:58:11,119 --> 00:58:15,119
carbon from the compost

1349
00:58:13,359 --> 00:58:16,480
add it back to the soil when you spread

1350
00:58:15,119 --> 00:58:19,359
it

1351
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:21,359
how do we put a number on that value and

1352
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,880
what is the value of the organic makeup

1353
00:58:21,359 --> 00:58:25,680
of the compost when compared to

1354
00:58:22,880 --> 00:58:27,359
conventional fertilizer

1355
00:58:25,680 --> 00:58:29,280
obviously this farmer was using

1356
00:58:27,359 --> 00:58:32,240
conventional fertilizer

1357
00:58:29,280 --> 00:58:33,680
he was getting good yields we introduced

1358
00:58:32,240 --> 00:58:36,720
the compost to it

1359
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:39,119
and within a year's time you had

1360
00:58:36,720 --> 00:58:42,160
even better yields so there's definitely

1361
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:44,079
something going on there

1362
00:58:42,160 --> 00:58:46,319
better utilization of nutrients in the

1363
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:50,240
farm system i talked about that earlier

1364
00:58:46,319 --> 00:58:52,319
how do we how do we uh utilize

1365
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:54,799
best utilize the nutrients that we have

1366
00:58:52,319 --> 00:58:57,920
paid for on the farm

1367
00:58:54,799 --> 00:59:00,960
and sharing it from field to field

1368
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:02,960
convenience of the value of moving and

1369
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:04,000
staging manure to farm fields before

1370
00:59:02,960 --> 00:59:06,000
hauling

1371
00:59:04,000 --> 00:59:07,440
this time of the year we don't i

1372
00:59:06,000 --> 00:59:08,559
shouldn't say we don't have a lot to do

1373
00:59:07,440 --> 00:59:12,079
but we have

1374
00:59:08,559 --> 00:59:13,599
we have a little more time to actually

1375
00:59:12,079 --> 00:59:16,000
stage that manure

1376
00:59:13,599 --> 00:59:19,200
get it to those fields taking the

1377
00:59:16,000 --> 00:59:21,280
transportation part out of the equation

1378
00:59:19,200 --> 00:59:23,119
at the time when you need to be out

1379
00:59:21,280 --> 00:59:24,799
there spreading

1380
00:59:23,119 --> 00:59:27,760
the ability to manage betting pack

1381
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:31,119
manure all months of the year

1382
00:59:27,760 --> 00:59:34,319
that was a challenge for us you know

1383
00:59:31,119 --> 00:59:35,760
uh when you have bedding pack barns that

1384
00:59:34,319 --> 00:59:36,480
need to be cleaned out in the summer

1385
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:39,839
months

1386
00:59:36,480 --> 00:59:40,880
um you you're limited on fields where

1387
00:59:39,839 --> 00:59:42,640
you can spread it

1388
00:59:40,880 --> 00:59:44,839
you can't spread it on hay fields uh

1389
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:46,319
you'll smother out the alfalfa or the

1390
00:59:44,839 --> 00:59:48,240
grass

1391
00:59:46,319 --> 00:59:49,680
you take the potential of reharvesting

1392
00:59:48,240 --> 00:59:52,160
it again

1393
00:59:49,680 --> 00:59:53,359
therefore composting and breaking it

1394
00:59:52,160 --> 00:59:56,880
down

1395
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:57,920
allows us to do that select days for

1396
00:59:56,880 --> 01:00:00,480
hauling

1397
00:59:57,920 --> 01:00:02,160
that are best for the field conditions

1398
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:04,559
there's a value there

1399
01:00:02,160 --> 01:00:05,280
uh you're not out there compacting the

1400
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:08,319
soil

1401
01:00:05,280 --> 01:00:11,920
uh your can pick your dry days

1402
01:00:08,319 --> 01:00:15,200
um or or days when the

1403
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:18,079
uh the weather is is uh better for

1404
01:00:15,200 --> 01:00:20,559
spreading uh manure or nutrients out on

1405
01:00:18,079 --> 01:00:20,559
the field

1406
01:00:21,040 --> 01:00:24,880
spreading manure compost on fields that

1407
01:00:22,960 --> 01:00:27,440
won't have received manure

1408
01:00:24,880 --> 01:00:28,000
there are fields on our farm because of

1409
01:00:27,440 --> 01:00:30,640
the

1410
01:00:28,000 --> 01:00:31,520
landscape that we cannot put liquid

1411
01:00:30,640 --> 01:00:34,960
manure on

1412
01:00:31,520 --> 01:00:36,160
uh it just it's too hard we do most of

1413
01:00:34,960 --> 01:00:38,720
our liquid manure

1414
01:00:36,160 --> 01:00:40,319
application in the form of drag lines

1415
01:00:38,720 --> 01:00:42,000
you get on some of these steep fields

1416
01:00:40,319 --> 01:00:45,040
and it's hard to pull a hose on a

1417
01:00:42,000 --> 01:00:46,720
steep field with their high slopes it

1418
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:50,559
makes some challenges

1419
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:52,960
problems with potential of kinking hoses

1420
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:55,200
and things like that

1421
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,000
allows for redistribution of nutrients

1422
01:00:55,200 --> 01:01:00,319
within the farm

1423
01:00:56,000 --> 01:01:00,319
system to all fields as i talked about

1424
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:06,559
cons of composting costs costs more to

1425
01:01:04,000 --> 01:01:09,200
compost

1426
01:01:06,559 --> 01:01:12,160
you know even though it come only

1427
01:01:09,200 --> 01:01:13,520
doesn't look significant but 6.50 cents

1428
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,559
a yard or 10

1429
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:18,319
a ton um doesn't

1430
01:01:16,559 --> 01:01:19,760
seem all that big but if you put four

1431
01:01:18,319 --> 01:01:21,119
ton to the acre on

1432
01:01:19,760 --> 01:01:22,880
all of a sudden you're looking at forty

1433
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:26,480
dollars an acre more

1434
01:01:22,880 --> 01:01:28,480
uh to to put that nutrients out in that

1435
01:01:26,480 --> 01:01:29,520
field that same nutrients granted it's

1436
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:31,839
in a different form

1437
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:32,799
probably more usable those are the types

1438
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,920
of things that we

1439
01:01:32,799 --> 01:01:39,280
have to be able to offset the expenses

1440
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:40,240
of the production some way somehow to

1441
01:01:39,280 --> 01:01:42,600
justify

1442
01:01:40,240 --> 01:01:44,319
the extra time and the commitment uh

1443
01:01:42,600 --> 01:01:47,599
[Music]

1444
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:50,240
uh for for the composting process

1445
01:01:47,599 --> 01:01:51,040
time time commitment is is big it takes

1446
01:01:50,240 --> 01:01:55,280
time

1447
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:56,880
to to stage this manure takes time to

1448
01:01:55,280 --> 01:01:59,039
make the wind rolls takes time to turn

1449
01:01:56,880 --> 01:02:01,599
the manure

1450
01:01:59,039 --> 01:02:02,720
some farms don't have that time that

1451
01:02:01,599 --> 01:02:05,520
labor force

1452
01:02:02,720 --> 01:02:06,480
some do the nice thing about the turner

1453
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,960
that we are

1454
01:02:06,480 --> 01:02:10,400
working with here on our farm is it's

1455
01:02:08,960 --> 01:02:12,799
completely mobile

1456
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:13,520
some of our trials we're doing working

1457
01:02:12,799 --> 01:02:17,039
with

1458
01:02:13,520 --> 01:02:19,920
with farmers uh we uh we're as far as

1459
01:02:17,039 --> 01:02:22,640
five miles away we're able to

1460
01:02:19,920 --> 01:02:24,400
move that turner with the tractor and a

1461
01:02:22,640 --> 01:02:26,880
minimum amount of time

1462
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:28,559
to turn their wind roads so there's a

1463
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,680
potential that

1464
01:02:28,559 --> 01:02:35,280
that compost turning and

1465
01:02:31,680 --> 01:02:40,880
making could be could be

1466
01:02:35,280 --> 01:02:44,319
a custom custom applica

1467
01:02:40,880 --> 01:02:46,240
application or a custom customly done

1468
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:47,520
by somebody that wants to move from farm

1469
01:02:46,240 --> 01:02:52,000
to farm

1470
01:02:47,520 --> 01:02:55,440
if it picks up in in popularity

1471
01:02:52,000 --> 01:02:57,359
equipment and facility costs

1472
01:02:55,440 --> 01:02:59,920
the equipment isn't cheap the spreader

1473
01:02:57,359 --> 01:03:03,119
isn't cheap the turner isn't cheap

1474
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:05,520
we have we we have uh

1475
01:03:03,119 --> 01:03:07,039
most of our manures being composted

1476
01:03:05,520 --> 01:03:09,200
under the the roof the

1477
01:03:07,039 --> 01:03:10,559
more of a controlled environment i

1478
01:03:09,200 --> 01:03:13,200
believe it's that's

1479
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,839
well worth it um the consistency of the

1480
01:03:13,200 --> 01:03:18,240
product coming out

1481
01:03:14,839 --> 01:03:20,000
uh saves in time potentially if you have

1482
01:03:18,240 --> 01:03:23,280
a

1483
01:03:20,000 --> 01:03:25,599
a windrow that goes dormant on you

1484
01:03:23,280 --> 01:03:27,200
halfway through the process of being

1485
01:03:25,599 --> 01:03:28,319
outside if you get a heavy rain or

1486
01:03:27,200 --> 01:03:32,000
something

1487
01:03:28,319 --> 01:03:34,720
then you you gotta either introduce more

1488
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:35,200
carbon to it or you have to wait it out

1489
01:03:34,720 --> 01:03:38,319
to

1490
01:03:35,200 --> 01:03:40,319
get revitalize that compost windrow

1491
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:43,280
so it takes a little bit of that risk

1492
01:03:40,319 --> 01:03:45,839
away with the facility cost

1493
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:47,359
lack of equipment and availability um

1494
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:49,599
when i started looking

1495
01:03:47,359 --> 01:03:50,400
for compost turners that would work well

1496
01:03:49,599 --> 01:03:52,720
in our

1497
01:03:50,400 --> 01:03:53,680
in our shed uh that's what brought me to

1498
01:03:52,720 --> 01:03:57,200
the idea

1499
01:03:53,680 --> 01:04:00,319
of building a compost turner i think

1500
01:03:57,200 --> 01:04:04,079
uh we we

1501
01:04:00,319 --> 01:04:05,520
the uh the equipment uh that is needed

1502
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,559
at a farm level

1503
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:11,760
is uh is

1504
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:14,960
is maybe not there uh yet

1505
01:04:11,760 --> 01:04:16,720
or maybe it's coming um seems like most

1506
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:17,359
of the compost turners that were out

1507
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:20,799
there

1508
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:24,799
were either too big for what we wanted

1509
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:27,359
or or too small weather challenges in

1510
01:04:24,799 --> 01:04:29,440
this region

1511
01:04:27,359 --> 01:04:31,920
northern you know we're we're in the

1512
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:34,400
southern part of wisconsin

1513
01:04:31,920 --> 01:04:35,520
we have some cold weather in january and

1514
01:04:34,400 --> 01:04:38,720
february as we

1515
01:04:35,520 --> 01:04:41,599
well recognize here coming out of the

1516
01:04:38,720 --> 01:04:43,119
the cool weather we had here recently uh

1517
01:04:41,599 --> 01:04:45,760
those challenges

1518
01:04:43,119 --> 01:04:46,880
um add that adds a challenge to the

1519
01:04:45,760 --> 01:04:49,359
compost

1520
01:04:46,880 --> 01:04:50,319
uh process especially when you're in the

1521
01:04:49,359 --> 01:04:52,400
deep freeze

1522
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:53,359
i don't like the turn if i don't have to

1523
01:04:52,400 --> 01:04:56,640
in those

1524
01:04:53,359 --> 01:04:58,000
those uh temperatures because it seems

1525
01:04:56,640 --> 01:05:00,720
to thin out my

1526
01:04:58,000 --> 01:05:02,240
my uh bug count or my bacteria count the

1527
01:05:00,720 --> 01:05:04,559
good bacteria

1528
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:05,520
also i'm turning frost and moisture back

1529
01:05:04,559 --> 01:05:07,520
into the windrow

1530
01:05:05,520 --> 01:05:09,839
that normally would be volatile up in

1531
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:09,839
the air

1532
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:14,720
ability to dissipate the moisture into

1533
01:05:13,119 --> 01:05:17,200
the compost in the winter months just

1534
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:18,880
talked about that

1535
01:05:17,200 --> 01:05:21,039
getting that moisture to actually leave

1536
01:05:18,880 --> 01:05:22,640
that wind roll

1537
01:05:21,039 --> 01:05:24,960
if we're going to do this in a large

1538
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:29,039
scale um

1539
01:05:24,960 --> 01:05:29,039
we may have to introduce some form of

1540
01:05:29,599 --> 01:05:38,480
ventilation or air in the floor systems

1541
01:05:35,119 --> 01:05:40,160
to potentially drive that moisture away

1542
01:05:38,480 --> 01:05:42,799
from the windrows

1543
01:05:40,160 --> 01:05:44,880
at this time of the year what we have

1544
01:05:42,799 --> 01:05:47,920
learned

1545
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:49,920
uh we have learned that we have the

1546
01:05:47,920 --> 01:05:50,559
ability to make a high quality compost

1547
01:05:49,920 --> 01:05:54,240
product

1548
01:05:50,559 --> 01:05:55,119
um you know we've we've got some compost

1549
01:05:54,240 --> 01:05:58,079
that's

1550
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:59,359
very high value um depending upon the

1551
01:05:58,079 --> 01:06:01,200
feedstocks

1552
01:05:59,359 --> 01:06:02,559
it's a matter of zeroing in on your

1553
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:06,000
recipes and your

1554
01:06:02,559 --> 01:06:07,039
your sources to to make a consistent

1555
01:06:06,000 --> 01:06:10,079
product

1556
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:10,720
uh compost process works well if you

1557
01:06:10,079 --> 01:06:13,119
have raw

1558
01:06:10,720 --> 01:06:13,760
products and multiple types of manure uh

1559
01:06:13,119 --> 01:06:16,880
we are

1560
01:06:13,760 --> 01:06:18,559
we have proven that uh we've even taken

1561
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:21,119
it one step further as i've

1562
01:06:18,559 --> 01:06:23,119
talked to you earlier about with some of

1563
01:06:21,119 --> 01:06:25,839
the class a product coming out of the

1564
01:06:23,119 --> 01:06:28,640
madison metropolitan sewer district

1565
01:06:25,839 --> 01:06:30,319
can shrink manure volume considerably by

1566
01:06:28,640 --> 01:06:32,880
composting

1567
01:06:30,319 --> 01:06:34,160
i think we've seen anywhere from 40 to

1568
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:37,680
60 percent

1569
01:06:34,160 --> 01:06:38,400
in volume uh reductions uh that's huge

1570
01:06:37,680 --> 01:06:41,760
when

1571
01:06:38,400 --> 01:06:42,720
you gotta offset the costs of the extra

1572
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:46,079
time

1573
01:06:42,720 --> 01:06:48,319
and investment to make compost can make

1574
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:49,599
nutrients much more available and stable

1575
01:06:48,319 --> 01:06:51,680
for composting

1576
01:06:49,599 --> 01:06:53,520
with composting versus conventional pack

1577
01:06:51,680 --> 01:06:55,599
manure

1578
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:57,280
i think we've seen that in our what

1579
01:06:55,599 --> 01:06:59,039
we've seen out in the field with our

1580
01:06:57,280 --> 01:07:01,359
yields

1581
01:06:59,039 --> 01:07:02,400
we've we definitely know that if you

1582
01:07:01,359 --> 01:07:05,839
haul

1583
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:08,960
a lot of uh straw and

1584
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:11,520
and corn stock uh

1585
01:07:08,960 --> 01:07:12,559
carbon based fresh manure out in the

1586
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:15,680
field that it

1587
01:07:12,559 --> 01:07:19,520
can sometimes suppress

1588
01:07:15,680 --> 01:07:20,960
the uh the yield or or potential of that

1589
01:07:19,520 --> 01:07:23,039
crop that year

1590
01:07:20,960 --> 01:07:25,280
just because of the tying up the

1591
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:28,079
nutrients that's in the soil

1592
01:07:25,280 --> 01:07:30,480
vibrate to break down the carbon in that

1593
01:07:28,079 --> 01:07:30,480
manure

1594
01:07:31,119 --> 01:07:35,680
we can spread product on growing crops

1595
01:07:33,760 --> 01:07:37,280
alfalfa grass we even did some on

1596
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:41,039
soybeans last year

1597
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:42,960
for a farmer that's that's a positive

1598
01:07:41,039 --> 01:07:44,160
can transport nutrients further in the

1599
01:07:42,960 --> 01:07:47,359
form of compost

1600
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:48,400
before the economic value of the product

1601
01:07:47,359 --> 01:07:52,640
becomes a net

1602
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:54,799
loss you can manage processed manure on

1603
01:07:52,640 --> 01:07:57,839
field edges

1604
01:07:54,799 --> 01:08:01,280
it's perfectly legal to do that um

1605
01:07:57,839 --> 01:08:01,599
it's a good way of uh saving some time

1606
01:08:01,280 --> 01:08:04,880
and

1607
01:08:01,599 --> 01:08:07,119
at the hauling time we can dispose of

1608
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:08,640
livestock mortalities i started out my

1609
01:08:07,119 --> 01:08:11,920
presentation and that's

1610
01:08:08,640 --> 01:08:14,720
where we learned what composting was

1611
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:15,359
all about so to speak was working with

1612
01:08:14,720 --> 01:08:18,000
with the

1613
01:08:15,359 --> 01:08:20,400
mortalities and how it shrinks how we're

1614
01:08:18,000 --> 01:08:20,400
able to

1615
01:08:21,120 --> 01:08:28,159
decompose that that mortality and that

1616
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:31,199
that one roll of manure and and

1617
01:08:28,159 --> 01:08:32,480
and shrink shrink that manure at the

1618
01:08:31,199 --> 01:08:36,000
same time

1619
01:08:32,480 --> 01:08:39,040
uh pretty uh safe and

1620
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:40,080
efficient way to limit yourself to

1621
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:42,560
exposure to

1622
01:08:40,080 --> 01:08:44,239
other diseases and pathogens with the

1623
01:08:42,560 --> 01:08:46,319
with the rendering truck coming onto the

1624
01:08:44,239 --> 01:08:48,560
farm

1625
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:51,199
can reintroduce carbon back to the farm

1626
01:08:48,560 --> 01:08:54,239
fields in the form of compost

1627
01:08:51,199 --> 01:08:57,199
that's that's a given

1628
01:08:54,239 --> 01:08:58,319
can mix other things with compost um you

1629
01:08:57,199 --> 01:09:01,839
know we can

1630
01:08:58,319 --> 01:09:05,600
we can potentially add lime uh wallboard

1631
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:08,560
municipal mixes that

1632
01:09:05,600 --> 01:09:09,199
that is important that spreader that i i

1633
01:09:08,560 --> 01:09:11,040
have here

1634
01:09:09,199 --> 01:09:12,880
and showed you on the screen has the

1635
01:09:11,040 --> 01:09:16,239
potential of spreading lime

1636
01:09:12,880 --> 01:09:18,400
um you could mix lime with your compost

1637
01:09:16,239 --> 01:09:19,600
on a field that you wanted to seed into

1638
01:09:18,400 --> 01:09:23,199
alfalfa

1639
01:09:19,600 --> 01:09:26,400
and and spread the lime and the

1640
01:09:23,199 --> 01:09:28,319
compost at the same time a lot of wall

1641
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,239
board down in this area with the amount

1642
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:32,239
of housing and

1643
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:34,000
building in in this region the southern

1644
01:09:32,239 --> 01:09:37,679
part of the state has a lot of gypsum

1645
01:09:34,000 --> 01:09:40,799
in it um some value in that

1646
01:09:37,679 --> 01:09:43,040
in our watershed here the municipal

1647
01:09:40,799 --> 01:09:45,040
uh municipality sewer districts they're

1648
01:09:43,040 --> 01:09:47,520
they're they've got a challenge they

1649
01:09:45,040 --> 01:09:50,560
they're actually competing with farmers

1650
01:09:47,520 --> 01:09:53,120
for land to spread the human waste on

1651
01:09:50,560 --> 01:09:54,239
there might be a potential to commingle

1652
01:09:53,120 --> 01:09:57,360
our products

1653
01:09:54,239 --> 01:10:00,080
to make a product that works uh

1654
01:09:57,360 --> 01:10:01,120
for for the farmers and and work

1655
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:03,760
together

1656
01:10:01,120 --> 01:10:06,320
could that's a possibility it may not

1657
01:10:03,760 --> 01:10:09,440
fit the organic world but it might fit

1658
01:10:06,320 --> 01:10:11,280
the conventional systems convert soluble

1659
01:10:09,440 --> 01:10:13,280
phosphorus from raw manure into more

1660
01:10:11,280 --> 01:10:15,520
stable particulate form

1661
01:10:13,280 --> 01:10:16,560
through the composting process we've

1662
01:10:15,520 --> 01:10:21,199
we've

1663
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:23,040
seen that in our work with the

1664
01:10:21,199 --> 01:10:25,920
with the university and and the

1665
01:10:23,040 --> 01:10:25,920
community grant

1666
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:33,040
what we need to learn how does

1667
01:10:30,560 --> 01:10:34,560
finnish complain compost interact with

1668
01:10:33,040 --> 01:10:37,600
the soil

1669
01:10:34,560 --> 01:10:38,480
um i guess that's something that i would

1670
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:40,880
really

1671
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:41,600
like to get into more depth now and

1672
01:10:40,880 --> 01:10:43,440
understand

1673
01:10:41,600 --> 01:10:46,400
what's happening in those farm fields

1674
01:10:43,440 --> 01:10:48,560
when we put that compost out there

1675
01:10:46,400 --> 01:10:50,880
can compost be another saleable

1676
01:10:48,560 --> 01:10:55,840
commodity coming off the farm

1677
01:10:50,880 --> 01:10:59,360
and off our waste stream so

1678
01:10:55,840 --> 01:11:02,400
if if we if we can

1679
01:10:59,360 --> 01:11:05,760
and i and my i have a

1680
01:11:02,400 --> 01:11:05,760
enough um

1681
01:11:06,480 --> 01:11:10,000
experience with this now that i feel

1682
01:11:08,480 --> 01:11:13,679
that it can be

1683
01:11:10,000 --> 01:11:16,800
um i think it i think that would be

1684
01:11:13,679 --> 01:11:18,960
very very important for the future of of

1685
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:22,000
the livestock industry if we can

1686
01:11:18,960 --> 01:11:23,679
uh somehow make a product coming off of

1687
01:11:22,000 --> 01:11:27,760
their waste stream that could

1688
01:11:23,679 --> 01:11:29,360
form an another form of income

1689
01:11:27,760 --> 01:11:31,040
there's farms out there that need that

1690
01:11:29,360 --> 01:11:32,320
organic fertilizer and they need those

1691
01:11:31,040 --> 01:11:35,679
nutrients

1692
01:11:32,320 --> 01:11:37,440
so how much compost do we need to put on

1693
01:11:35,679 --> 01:11:41,040
per acre

1694
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:44,080
to to get the benefits of this

1695
01:11:41,040 --> 01:11:47,360
that you need in the soil uh

1696
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:50,640
that kick so to speak uh

1697
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:54,000
to get that kick uh is it four ton

1698
01:11:50,640 --> 01:11:56,400
is it maybe a thousand pounds if it's

1699
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:58,080
a thousand pounds i've got all kinds of

1700
01:11:56,400 --> 01:12:00,640
compost that i can

1701
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:01,440
share with people if i need to continue

1702
01:12:00,640 --> 01:12:04,159
putting

1703
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,719
four to five ton on my hay fields then

1704
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:08,560
maybe

1705
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:10,480
maybe i don't we can pool resources to

1706
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:13,520
engage a larger number of farmers

1707
01:12:10,480 --> 01:12:14,640
i mean can we do this um i'm starting to

1708
01:12:13,520 --> 01:12:17,360
think we can

1709
01:12:14,640 --> 01:12:18,320
um it's just a matter of how does that

1710
01:12:17,360 --> 01:12:21,440
all work and

1711
01:12:18,320 --> 01:12:24,880
how can we work together to do that

1712
01:12:21,440 --> 01:12:27,040
how much composters need to apply to be

1713
01:12:24,880 --> 01:12:29,040
applied to obtain maximum soil health

1714
01:12:27,040 --> 01:12:32,400
benefits i just touched on that a little

1715
01:12:29,040 --> 01:12:36,560
a little bit early but uh what is that

1716
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:39,280
um what is that magic number

1717
01:12:36,560 --> 01:12:41,199
how much compost do we need to apply per

1718
01:12:39,280 --> 01:12:42,640
acre to get the full value of compost

1719
01:12:41,199 --> 01:12:45,440
working in the soil

1720
01:12:42,640 --> 01:12:48,560
can the rest be marketed and that's

1721
01:12:45,440 --> 01:12:48,560
that's the bottom line

1722
01:12:48,719 --> 01:12:55,840
why manage manure by composting

1723
01:12:52,080 --> 01:13:00,239
any size farm can successfully compost

1724
01:12:55,840 --> 01:13:02,560
um that's that's been proven

1725
01:13:00,239 --> 01:13:05,040
better utilization of nutrients in the

1726
01:13:02,560 --> 01:13:06,480
farm system i've talked about that a

1727
01:13:05,040 --> 01:13:08,400
number of times

1728
01:13:06,480 --> 01:13:10,239
mobilization of nutrients needed in

1729
01:13:08,400 --> 01:13:13,760
specific fields

1730
01:13:10,239 --> 01:13:16,080
um you know i do my own snap plus

1731
01:13:13,760 --> 01:13:17,120
nutrient management planning and i got a

1732
01:13:16,080 --> 01:13:19,440
pretty good handle on

1733
01:13:17,120 --> 01:13:20,960
fields that are low on phosphorus and

1734
01:13:19,440 --> 01:13:23,280
need phosphorus

1735
01:13:20,960 --> 01:13:25,199
i try to build those fields within the

1736
01:13:23,280 --> 01:13:27,840
system with the phosphorus that's in the

1737
01:13:25,199 --> 01:13:27,840
compost

1738
01:13:28,239 --> 01:13:32,320
get the nutrients to the fields that are

1739
01:13:29,840 --> 01:13:34,000
highly erodible

1740
01:13:32,320 --> 01:13:37,440
tend to be the hardest ones to get the

1741
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:39,600
minor spreader to or the drag line to

1742
01:13:37,440 --> 01:13:41,520
some of them fields aren't getting corn

1743
01:13:39,600 --> 01:13:46,080
that is often so it's hard to

1744
01:13:41,520 --> 01:13:49,360
hit them on a regular basis

1745
01:13:46,080 --> 01:13:53,120
uh liquid manure storage costly to store

1746
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:58,080
hauling comes because of the volume

1747
01:13:53,120 --> 01:14:01,199
um no no secret in that i mean

1748
01:13:58,080 --> 01:14:03,600
um manure structures are

1749
01:14:01,199 --> 01:14:05,040
costing more and more a year every year

1750
01:14:03,600 --> 01:14:08,719
that goes by to build

1751
01:14:05,040 --> 01:14:11,360
um and how can we shrink that

1752
01:14:08,719 --> 01:14:11,920
again to shrink that volume of manure uh

1753
01:14:11,360 --> 01:14:14,480
so that

1754
01:14:11,920 --> 01:14:16,000
when we put wheels under it that it's

1755
01:14:14,480 --> 01:14:18,480
more concentrated and

1756
01:14:16,000 --> 01:14:18,480
and more

1757
01:14:19,679 --> 01:14:25,600
condensed so that we can

1758
01:14:23,040 --> 01:14:27,679
move it move it out more efficiently and

1759
01:14:25,600 --> 01:14:29,520
further

1760
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:31,600
allowed to headland stack and stage

1761
01:14:29,520 --> 01:14:34,640
compost on fields in winter months

1762
01:14:31,600 --> 01:14:36,960
when liquid manure can't be spread um

1763
01:14:34,640 --> 01:14:38,960
those headlands don't aren't costing you

1764
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,640
much more than the taxes in the winter

1765
01:14:38,960 --> 01:14:43,120
months for them to be sitting there

1766
01:14:40,640 --> 01:14:44,640
on the farm field might as well make use

1767
01:14:43,120 --> 01:14:48,560
of them

1768
01:14:44,640 --> 01:14:51,520
some of these field edge

1769
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,120
you know tree line areas they're not

1770
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:54,480
growing the best crops to begin with

1771
01:14:53,120 --> 01:14:56,560
maybe we should be

1772
01:14:54,480 --> 01:14:58,719
utilizing them for staging our nutrients

1773
01:14:56,560 --> 01:15:01,040
out there earlier

1774
01:14:58,719 --> 01:15:03,600
pathogen removal another one how do we

1775
01:15:01,040 --> 01:15:06,800
put a value on that but

1776
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:09,280
but uh that is the reason why

1777
01:15:06,800 --> 01:15:10,159
that we should be composting kills kills

1778
01:15:09,280 --> 01:15:13,440
a number

1779
01:15:10,159 --> 01:15:15,360
of pathogens uh allows

1780
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:17,440
for spreading on growing crops and then

1781
01:15:15,360 --> 01:15:19,679
reduces that potential

1782
01:15:17,440 --> 01:15:21,840
for these disease spreading example

1783
01:15:19,679 --> 01:15:24,560
would be like yoni's

1784
01:15:21,840 --> 01:15:26,560
our herd is pretty well eradicated uh

1785
01:15:24,560 --> 01:15:29,520
yoni's

1786
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:32,880
and we've been able to do it with with

1787
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:32,880
good management practices

1788
01:15:33,040 --> 01:15:37,040
and i guess we're at the point here

1789
01:15:34,640 --> 01:15:37,920
where we can field a few more questions

1790
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:42,080
and

1791
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:45,199
maybe even have some dialogue so

1792
01:15:42,080 --> 01:15:48,159
uh so the first question in other words

1793
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:50,560
what is the benefit or not

1794
01:15:48,159 --> 01:15:51,679
containing the groundwater and surface

1795
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:54,800
waters with p

1796
01:15:51,679 --> 01:15:57,440
and n would you not agree that it is

1797
01:15:54,800 --> 01:16:01,360
priceless

1798
01:15:57,440 --> 01:16:03,600
yeah i agree it's it is uh but

1799
01:16:01,360 --> 01:16:05,120
even though it's priceless somebody has

1800
01:16:03,600 --> 01:16:09,280
to pay for it

1801
01:16:05,120 --> 01:16:12,239
there's a cost in it so um

1802
01:16:09,280 --> 01:16:14,159
you know my farm this is there's no

1803
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:16,480
doubt about it i am spending more money

1804
01:16:14,159 --> 01:16:18,480
on our farm making compost

1805
01:16:16,480 --> 01:16:20,800
right now than if i was directly hauling

1806
01:16:18,480 --> 01:16:23,920
that material to the field

1807
01:16:20,800 --> 01:16:26,719
and so to

1808
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:28,640
ask other farmers to do the same thing

1809
01:16:26,719 --> 01:16:30,400
we really got to know the benefits and

1810
01:16:28,640 --> 01:16:33,440
the values of those things

1811
01:16:30,400 --> 01:16:36,560
so we can justify

1812
01:16:33,440 --> 01:16:40,000
making the change and

1813
01:16:36,560 --> 01:16:42,560
the things that lead to um

1814
01:16:40,000 --> 01:16:44,640
better soil health and better

1815
01:16:42,560 --> 01:16:47,040
utilization of nitrogen

1816
01:16:44,640 --> 01:16:48,320
and and the nutrients within the compost

1817
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,080
all those things

1818
01:16:48,320 --> 01:16:52,560
are wind winds i always call them the

1819
01:16:50,080 --> 01:16:54,080
wind winds and when you win for the

1820
01:16:52,560 --> 01:16:55,120
environment and you win for the farmer's

1821
01:16:54,080 --> 01:16:58,480
bottom line

1822
01:16:55,120 --> 01:17:02,000
those are easy to adopt and adapt to

1823
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:04,640
but the ones that that are just

1824
01:17:02,000 --> 01:17:07,040
flat costs to the farm them are harder

1825
01:17:04,640 --> 01:17:07,040
to sell

1826
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:12,560
would not an easy justification for

1827
01:17:11,120 --> 01:17:15,920
added costs

1828
01:17:12,560 --> 01:17:16,800
be the simple fact that 70 of your non

1829
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:18,800
composted

1830
01:17:16,800 --> 01:17:20,239
nitrogen from the manure is leaching to

1831
01:17:18,800 --> 01:17:23,360
the groundwater

1832
01:17:20,239 --> 01:17:25,199
only 30 percent plant utilization 100 of

1833
01:17:23,360 --> 01:17:27,600
nitrogen in your compost is being

1834
01:17:25,199 --> 01:17:31,440
utilized by the plant huge

1835
01:17:27,600 --> 01:17:34,159
i would agree um being able to have that

1836
01:17:31,440 --> 01:17:38,560
in organic form

1837
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:41,600
slow release and tying it up i think

1838
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:44,719
is big those are things those are the

1839
01:17:41,600 --> 01:17:48,000
messages that need to be told with this

1840
01:17:44,719 --> 01:17:51,120
what is the width length and height

1841
01:17:48,000 --> 01:17:53,199
of your windrows our windrows generally

1842
01:17:51,120 --> 01:17:53,840
start out at about six to seven feet

1843
01:17:53,199 --> 01:17:57,360
high

1844
01:17:53,840 --> 01:18:00,000
the width at the bottom is about 12 feet

1845
01:17:57,360 --> 01:18:01,040
generally when they're done more more on

1846
01:18:00,000 --> 01:18:04,719
the finished side

1847
01:18:01,040 --> 01:18:07,040
they shrink down to about three feet um

1848
01:18:04,719 --> 01:18:08,000
and in some cases we actually combine

1849
01:18:07,040 --> 01:18:13,040
windrolls

1850
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:17,120
to keep to keep the composting uh

1851
01:18:13,040 --> 01:18:21,199
process going a little longer

1852
01:18:17,120 --> 01:18:26,320
is there any thought to compost some

1853
01:18:21,199 --> 01:18:30,000
or slash all the milk and cow manure

1854
01:18:26,320 --> 01:18:32,159
um the challenge that i would have with

1855
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:35,280
the milk and cow manure

1856
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:36,080
is is the excess water that's in the

1857
01:18:35,280 --> 01:18:39,120
liquid

1858
01:18:36,080 --> 01:18:40,000
manure from a dairy cow dairy cow drinks

1859
01:18:39,120 --> 01:18:42,960
a lot of water

1860
01:18:40,000 --> 01:18:45,040
so she's she's putting out a lot of a

1861
01:18:42,960 --> 01:18:48,480
lot of moisture in her manure

1862
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:48,480
um there are

1863
01:18:48,560 --> 01:18:52,159
some facilities in europe where they're

1864
01:18:50,800 --> 01:18:56,000
where they are

1865
01:18:52,159 --> 01:18:58,080
taking a liquid manure and and

1866
01:18:56,000 --> 01:18:59,679
high volumes of water in it and are

1867
01:18:58,080 --> 01:19:02,880
composting it

1868
01:18:59,679 --> 01:19:06,400
i not up to speed on them i don't

1869
01:19:02,880 --> 01:19:09,920
know that particularly

1870
01:19:06,400 --> 01:19:12,560
the answer um but i know

1871
01:19:09,920 --> 01:19:14,400
the more things that i have to build and

1872
01:19:12,560 --> 01:19:17,040
add to the farm the more costs

1873
01:19:14,400 --> 01:19:17,920
that's going to be for for for doing it

1874
01:19:17,040 --> 01:19:20,880
so

1875
01:19:17,920 --> 01:19:21,520
um if we can do it someday i'm sure we

1876
01:19:20,880 --> 01:19:23,360
will

1877
01:19:21,520 --> 01:19:24,560
uh it's a work in our case it's a

1878
01:19:23,360 --> 01:19:27,520
working progress

1879
01:19:24,560 --> 01:19:30,880
what effect does your composting process

1880
01:19:27,520 --> 01:19:33,679
have on greenhouse gas emissions

1881
01:19:30,880 --> 01:19:35,280
well that's a good question um so

1882
01:19:33,679 --> 01:19:37,520
there's no lie

1883
01:19:35,280 --> 01:19:38,400
there we're emitting some greenhouse

1884
01:19:37,520 --> 01:19:42,480
grasses through

1885
01:19:38,400 --> 01:19:45,520
gases through the composting process um

1886
01:19:42,480 --> 01:19:47,760
now there is the potential

1887
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:49,199
of adding some some things to the

1888
01:19:47,760 --> 01:19:52,400
compost

1889
01:19:49,199 --> 01:19:54,400
that could alleviate some of that i'm

1890
01:19:52,400 --> 01:19:57,520
going to be working with some people

1891
01:19:54,400 --> 01:19:59,760
moving forward on that idea i can't

1892
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:01,360
reveal what the product is yet but we

1893
01:19:59,760 --> 01:20:05,040
are going to be testing that

1894
01:20:01,360 --> 01:20:08,159
so any time we can keep some nighter

1895
01:20:05,040 --> 01:20:11,040
excess nitrogen into that compost

1896
01:20:08,159 --> 01:20:11,360
um that should help with the vaultation

1897
01:20:11,040 --> 01:20:15,040
of

1898
01:20:11,360 --> 01:20:17,360
greenhouse gases what is the size of

1899
01:20:15,040 --> 01:20:19,280
your building and how many yards and

1900
01:20:17,360 --> 01:20:22,880
tons can it handle

1901
01:20:19,280 --> 01:20:27,280
so our building is 65

1902
01:20:22,880 --> 01:20:27,679
for 60 by 220. i have four windrows in

1903
01:20:27,280 --> 01:20:30,880
there

1904
01:20:27,679 --> 01:20:34,110
at a time i always figure a windrow per

1905
01:20:30,880 --> 01:20:37,170
foot approximately a ton

1906
01:20:34,110 --> 01:20:37,170
[Music]

1907
01:20:38,080 --> 01:20:43,440
a ton half a third of a ton per foot

1908
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,440
the building is actually quite high it's

1909
01:20:46,800 --> 01:20:50,239
i think it's 16 or 17 feet to the truss

1910
01:20:49,440 --> 01:20:53,920
height

1911
01:20:50,239 --> 01:20:55,920
that gives us plenty of room to

1912
01:20:53,920 --> 01:20:57,679
use the spreader open the end gate in

1913
01:20:55,920 --> 01:21:01,160
there and not hit the

1914
01:20:57,679 --> 01:21:26,840
bottom of the trusses

1915
01:21:01,160 --> 01:21:29,840

1916
01:21:26,840 --> 01:21:29,840
