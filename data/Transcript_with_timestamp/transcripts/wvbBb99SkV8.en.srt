00:00:07,390 --> 00:00:12,800
soil health you know isn't just one

3
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:16,189
thing it's like a system it's approach I

4
00:00:12,800 --> 00:00:20,900
mean for us it's combining no-till crop

5
00:00:16,189 --> 00:00:22,730
rotation cover crops and then planting

6
00:00:20,900 --> 00:00:25,999
like native grass species and our

7
00:00:22,730 --> 00:00:28,699
sensitive areas and our wetlands and our

8
00:00:25,999 --> 00:00:31,270
salinity areas and along our watersheds

9
00:00:28,699 --> 00:00:33,620
to try to make our land not only

10
00:00:31,270 --> 00:00:36,620
profitable but sustainable for the

11
00:00:33,620 --> 00:00:38,670
future it's a way to pull carbon out of

12
00:00:36,620 --> 00:00:40,000
the air and put it in the ground and

13
00:00:38,670 --> 00:00:43,010
[Music]

14
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:45,559
carbon them organic matter are basically

15
00:00:43,010 --> 00:00:48,260
the same thing so if I can pull carbon

16
00:00:45,559 --> 00:00:52,699
out of the air and put it in the ground

17
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:54,829
I'll make it to soil healthier we're not

18
00:00:52,699 --> 00:00:56,420
seeing the salt issues as bad we're also

19
00:00:54,829 --> 00:00:58,910
not seeing the mud when we go in to

20
00:00:56,420 --> 00:01:01,670
plant if you take care of the soil it'll

21
00:00:58,910 --> 00:01:03,469
take care of you how do we manage not

22
00:01:01,670 --> 00:01:05,960
only the native Prairie soils but how do

23
00:01:03,469 --> 00:01:07,759
we manage the crop ground to get our

24
00:01:05,960 --> 00:01:10,340
soil structure back to where it should

25
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,770
be that's the real challenge that we

26
00:01:10,340 --> 00:01:14,630
have I think the first step is to

27
00:01:12,770 --> 00:01:16,460
understand and gain an understanding of

28
00:01:14,630 --> 00:01:19,970
what we're dealing with in the native

29
00:01:16,460 --> 00:01:23,810
Prairie soils building a resilient soil

30
00:01:19,970 --> 00:01:26,780
if it's wet if it's dry if it's cold if

31
00:01:23,810 --> 00:01:29,299
it's hot I want to soil that protects me

32
00:01:26,780 --> 00:01:31,189
within those situations or is able to

33
00:01:29,299 --> 00:01:33,710
handle those situations without costing

34
00:01:31,189 --> 00:01:35,659
me a crop there's so many living things

35
00:01:33,710 --> 00:01:38,659
there and when you go out there and dig

36
00:01:35,659 --> 00:01:41,240
with the living cover it just looks

37
00:01:38,659 --> 00:01:42,320
alive you're going to save money on fuel

38
00:01:41,240 --> 00:01:43,850
you're gonna save money with the

39
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:47,000
fertilizer because that's staying where

40
00:01:43,850 --> 00:01:49,340
you put it long run you're gaining yield

41
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,909
because you're increasing the value of

42
00:01:49,340 --> 00:01:55,340
the land it also helped our workload

43
00:01:52,909 --> 00:01:57,469
issues it allowed a better quality of

44
00:01:55,340 --> 00:01:58,820
life for me and my family and as it

45
00:01:57,469 --> 00:01:59,570
turns out it's a better quality of life

46
00:01:58,820 --> 00:02:00,969
for the soil

47
00:01:59,570 --> 00:02:03,770
it's better for the cows as well

48
00:02:00,969 --> 00:02:06,200
diversity is always improves the

49
00:02:03,770 --> 00:02:07,909
biological health and actually cattle

50
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:11,850
prefer diversity rather than

51
00:02:07,909 --> 00:02:16,090
monocultures we've made a real push to

52
00:02:11,850 --> 00:02:19,750
involve our landowners on the land that

53
00:02:16,090 --> 00:02:22,600
we rent and leased to to get involved in

54
00:02:19,750 --> 00:02:25,630
to understand what we're doing we have a

55
00:02:22,600 --> 00:02:28,900
pretty good crop rotation that we're

56
00:02:25,630 --> 00:02:30,580
happy with we're trying to have the soil

57
00:02:28,900 --> 00:02:33,010
covered pretty much all the time

58
00:02:30,580 --> 00:02:34,090
feeding the soils of pulling carbon

59
00:02:33,010 --> 00:02:36,040
dioxide out of the air through

60
00:02:34,090 --> 00:02:38,050
photosynthesis and feeding soil

61
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:38,680
microbiology increasing our soil organic

62
00:02:38,050 --> 00:02:40,990
matter

63
00:02:38,680 --> 00:02:44,230
it is accepting the responsibility to

64
00:02:40,990 --> 00:02:46,660
continue to spread the word and to share

65
00:02:44,230 --> 00:02:49,810
the things that you've learned over the

66
00:02:46,660 --> 00:02:52,750
years share the knowledge the successes

67
00:02:49,810 --> 00:02:54,900
the failures of what it's all about it's

68
00:02:52,750 --> 00:02:58,840
about leaving it better than about it

69
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:01,240
long term my kids talked about farming

70
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:04,030
they they love being out here you know

71
00:03:01,240 --> 00:03:06,910
and I that's up to each one of them if

72
00:03:04,030 --> 00:03:08,740
they want to do this or not I hope one

73
00:03:06,910 --> 00:03:09,720
or two of them decided to come back and

74
00:03:08,740 --> 00:03:13,650
run the farm

00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:15,709
