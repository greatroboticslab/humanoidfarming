1
00:00:12,840 --> 00:00:22,320
not so good afternoon today Victor will

2
00:00:18,510 --> 00:00:24,000
present as a Brownback seminar or we

3
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,710
will change the name soon into

4
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,570
Tupperware seminars or something like

5
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:34,399
that so welcome and thanks for being

6
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:36,600
here Victor has a Bachelor of law and

7
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:39,480
master's degree in marketing and

8
00:00:36,600 --> 00:00:42,420
communications with postgraduate studies

9
00:00:39,480 --> 00:00:46,499
studies in local economic development I

10
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:49,920
think it was part of how do we diversify

11
00:00:46,499 --> 00:00:52,440
certain profiles in intimate and in the

12
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,210
program and in that sense you were

13
00:00:52,440 --> 00:00:56,070
looking for experience in public private

14
00:00:54,210 --> 00:00:57,679
partnerships agriculture marketing

15
00:00:56,070 --> 00:01:00,719
agribusiness and sustainable development

16
00:00:57,679 --> 00:01:03,390
say it has Victor sorry has lived in

17
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,690
Asia Europe and America where he worked

18
00:01:03,390 --> 00:01:09,000
for the FAO dealing with farming market

19
00:01:06,690 --> 00:01:12,390
linkages as well as agricultural market

20
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,420
services in Mexico Victor was with the

21
00:01:12,390 --> 00:01:17,969
internet inter-american Development Bank

22
00:01:14,420 --> 00:01:19,790
prior prior to joining similar here in

23
00:01:17,969 --> 00:01:22,110
CIMMYT he has worked on public-private

24
00:01:19,790 --> 00:01:24,689
partnerships within the SIP program

25
00:01:22,110 --> 00:01:27,509
he is component leader for masa grow

26
00:01:24,689 --> 00:01:30,119
product or and has been working in

27
00:01:27,509 --> 00:01:32,789
different projects in the let in the

28
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:36,090
systemic densification strategy on

29
00:01:32,789 --> 00:01:37,920
farmer market linkages and will present

30
00:01:36,090 --> 00:01:38,789
first today farmer market linkages in

31
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:41,880
the context of sustainable

32
00:01:38,789 --> 00:01:44,340
intensification systems and before we

33
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,750
start thanks for Victor for doing the

34
00:01:44,340 --> 00:01:48,270
effort taking the time like everybody

35
00:01:45,750 --> 00:01:50,670
else who's presenting the Brownback's to

36
00:01:48,270 --> 00:01:58,770
put your work out there to be looked at

37
00:01:50,670 --> 00:02:00,810
mix I yes so thank you Ron for your

38
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:03,750
presentation thanks everyone for taking

39
00:02:00,810 --> 00:02:05,880
the time to be here I wanted to give you

40
00:02:03,750 --> 00:02:07,770
a little bit of an overview of what we

41
00:02:05,880 --> 00:02:10,410
have been doing in terms of fundamental

42
00:02:07,770 --> 00:02:14,810
market linkages and how does this fit

43
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:18,710
into existing efforts and program of

44
00:02:14,810 --> 00:02:20,819
sustainable intensification strategy so

45
00:02:18,710 --> 00:02:23,670
the presentation is going to start

46
00:02:20,819 --> 00:02:25,110
framing a little bit the scope of the

47
00:02:23,670 --> 00:02:26,130
activities we are doing and then we will

48
00:02:25,110 --> 00:02:30,570
see some mix

49
00:02:26,130 --> 00:02:34,560
pose in actual projects so we like to

50
00:02:30,570 --> 00:02:37,290
define ourselves as providing input in

51
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,180
this in this sense by providing

52
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:40,920
strategic interventions through the

53
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,050
value networks of may suite and

54
00:02:40,920 --> 00:02:45,510
associated crops it's perhaps

55
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,840
interesting to highlight here associated

56
00:02:45,510 --> 00:02:51,110
crops because it's part of CIMMYT

57
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,640
mission to work with with crops

58
00:02:51,110 --> 00:02:55,830
different from maize and wheat but

59
00:02:53,640 --> 00:02:57,780
especially it's important in terms of of

60
00:02:55,830 --> 00:02:59,610
markets aiming at strengthening

61
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:01,260
commercial relationships based on

62
00:02:59,610 --> 00:03:03,240
sustainability innovation and

63
00:03:01,260 --> 00:03:06,090
competitiveness so what we have been

64
00:03:03,240 --> 00:03:08,580
doing was revealing in which sense we

65
00:03:06,090 --> 00:03:10,440
could provide some added value to what

66
00:03:08,580 --> 00:03:13,160
already was going on on the market and

67
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,360
how we could kind of round the

68
00:03:13,160 --> 00:03:17,340
activities that submit' was already

69
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,840
doing and what we were already doing in

70
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:20,970
projects dealing with sustainable

71
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:22,650
intensification being masago

72
00:03:20,970 --> 00:03:25,650
the federal project one of the main

73
00:03:22,650 --> 00:03:27,780
efforts here you can see one of the

74
00:03:25,650 --> 00:03:30,570
infograph is one of the graphics that we

75
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:33,480
are doing in which we kind of map the

76
00:03:30,570 --> 00:03:37,280
value chain it's interesting to mention

77
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:42,290
also that we refer here value networks

78
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:45,600
we want to refer that there are several

79
00:03:42,290 --> 00:03:47,700
readings on value chain and value

80
00:03:45,600 --> 00:03:49,590
networks what is the difference so we

81
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:52,050
don't think they are those are

82
00:03:49,590 --> 00:03:54,780
incompatible terms we think those need

83
00:03:52,050 --> 00:03:58,170
to be combined so in for instance in the

84
00:03:54,780 --> 00:04:00,540
finance the use of value networks have

85
00:03:58,170 --> 00:04:02,790
been used have been used for years where

86
00:04:00,540 --> 00:04:06,840
they when they refer to the single

87
00:04:02,790 --> 00:04:09,060
actors in a given activity considering

88
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:11,370
the different role they may have so kind

89
00:04:09,060 --> 00:04:13,950
of the same thing has been adopted by

90
00:04:11,370 --> 00:04:16,290
the university of chopping go we have

91
00:04:13,950 --> 00:04:19,440
been working with Roberto random of

92
00:04:16,290 --> 00:04:22,710
system by understanding how can we do

93
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,620
this I see this as a reading as body

94
00:04:22,710 --> 00:04:28,560
chain could be kind of a 2d projection

95
00:04:25,620 --> 00:04:31,260
of what is going on and a value networks

96
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:35,130
can be kind of a 3d projection or kind

97
00:04:31,260 --> 00:04:38,440
of isolating a specific player and

98
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:42,160
understand which are the different

99
00:04:38,440 --> 00:04:44,800
this player plays being a client being a

100
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:47,890
supplier being a complementary on being

101
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:50,110
a competitor so we have been mapping the

102
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:54,870
Mason with value chains with this

103
00:04:50,110 --> 00:04:57,670
perspective also this is an example of

104
00:04:54,870 --> 00:05:00,520
commercial network mapping exercises

105
00:04:57,670 --> 00:05:03,420
that we did with Roberta rendang

106
00:05:00,520 --> 00:05:07,810
in Oaxaca in Chiapas in four states in

107
00:05:03,420 --> 00:05:11,140
2016 we plan to keep working on next

108
00:05:07,810 --> 00:05:13,540
year's in this effort what we do is to

109
00:05:11,140 --> 00:05:16,960
understand how the players relate to

110
00:05:13,540 --> 00:05:19,120
each other in a specific geographical

111
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:21,640
context we kind of take a picture of

112
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:23,830
what is going on from a commercial point

113
00:05:21,640 --> 00:05:25,360
of view we take the picture again after

114
00:05:23,830 --> 00:05:28,380
an intervention and understand whether

115
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:31,450
new links have been produced so that

116
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,610
there are there are some factors that we

117
00:05:31,450 --> 00:05:36,630
cannot understand by reading a simple

118
00:05:33,610 --> 00:05:39,310
value chain but by having this kind of

119
00:05:36,630 --> 00:05:41,620
associations and relationships mapped we

120
00:05:39,310 --> 00:05:43,510
get a better understanding and we

121
00:05:41,620 --> 00:05:46,990
actually want our collaborators

122
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:49,830
providing support to farmers to also

123
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:53,680
adopt this commercial networking mapping

124
00:05:49,830 --> 00:05:56,440
methodology so why did we start doing

125
00:05:53,680 --> 00:06:00,550
this kind of work it was mostly because

126
00:05:56,440 --> 00:06:03,760
of the demand of the farmers so misawa's

127
00:06:00,550 --> 00:06:05,530
you know started operating in 2011 soon

128
00:06:03,760 --> 00:06:07,480
after that kind of a couple of years

129
00:06:05,530 --> 00:06:09,610
afterwards we realized that we needed to

130
00:06:07,480 --> 00:06:12,360
develop or to put together a component

131
00:06:09,610 --> 00:06:15,370
that would help farmers to push

132
00:06:12,360 --> 00:06:17,410
correctly their product so we were kind

133
00:06:15,370 --> 00:06:18,640
of helping them to increase their

134
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:20,500
productivity to increase their

135
00:06:18,640 --> 00:06:22,600
production but some of them were not

136
00:06:20,500 --> 00:06:24,220
linked to markets or were linked

137
00:06:22,600 --> 00:06:26,050
occasionally to markets or not

138
00:06:24,220 --> 00:06:28,500
understanding market dynamics

139
00:06:26,050 --> 00:06:31,120
appropriately and we understood that by

140
00:06:28,500 --> 00:06:35,320
by helping them to understand that we

141
00:06:31,120 --> 00:06:37,900
could help them a lot so we we

142
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:40,900
systematize the lessons learned like

143
00:06:37,900 --> 00:06:42,760
globally there was some song work of

144
00:06:40,900 --> 00:06:44,950
scimitar already in different projects

145
00:06:42,760 --> 00:06:47,520
and regions in farmer market linkages or

146
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:50,440
in agricultural marketing or value chain

147
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,970
reading and we incorporated that into

148
00:06:50,440 --> 00:06:55,090
the operation of massage

149
00:06:51,970 --> 00:06:57,400
and of course we we went through

150
00:06:55,090 --> 00:07:01,000
extensive literature review to see what

151
00:06:57,400 --> 00:07:03,310
was what hat being developed how could

152
00:07:01,000 --> 00:07:04,780
we contribute to that this is an example

153
00:07:03,310 --> 00:07:07,330
of an in front of you found early

154
00:07:04,780 --> 00:07:10,840
product that we developed saying what

155
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:13,780
what is the kind of route that a farmer

156
00:07:10,840 --> 00:07:16,480
should take by feeling that is not

157
00:07:13,780 --> 00:07:18,250
competing with his peer farmers or the P

158
00:07:16,480 --> 00:07:23,230
farmers they can organize themselves

159
00:07:18,250 --> 00:07:25,090
they can do joint efforts together these

160
00:07:23,230 --> 00:07:27,490
are some examples of materials that we

161
00:07:25,090 --> 00:07:28,780
have been reading so as bran was

162
00:07:27,490 --> 00:07:31,660
mentioning I was working at the

163
00:07:28,780 --> 00:07:33,700
marketing team at FAO and we recover

164
00:07:31,660 --> 00:07:37,320
part of that work and we Scheffer

165
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:40,180
outside the David Camm who were kind of

166
00:07:37,320 --> 00:07:42,610
who have been writing of this topic for

167
00:07:40,180 --> 00:07:43,960
years these are some examples of

168
00:07:42,610 --> 00:07:46,270
projects or forming of the

169
00:07:43,960 --> 00:07:48,340
inter-american Development Bank and of

170
00:07:46,270 --> 00:07:49,780
course and of course this the socio

171
00:07:48,340 --> 00:07:51,720
economics program of CIMMYT has

172
00:07:49,780 --> 00:07:55,260
developed also some quite interesting

173
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:57,580
documents that we have been utilizing

174
00:07:55,260 --> 00:07:59,590
these are some other examples this is

175
00:07:57,580 --> 00:08:02,980
one of the last actually one of the last

176
00:07:59,590 --> 00:08:05,230
products with Andre Duvall Jason Donovan

177
00:08:02,980 --> 00:08:08,380
working on an identification of

178
00:08:05,230 --> 00:08:10,720
experiences in the sea here but also

179
00:08:08,380 --> 00:08:13,060
outside of the CER and understanding how

180
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:16,240
the so called VCD value chain for

181
00:08:13,060 --> 00:08:19,810
development could be better increase so

182
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:22,570
starting from all this literature we we

183
00:08:19,810 --> 00:08:23,350
intend to bring it back to what is going

184
00:08:22,570 --> 00:08:25,540
on right

185
00:08:23,350 --> 00:08:28,210
so we developed several guidelines

186
00:08:25,540 --> 00:08:31,210
practical guidelines for farmers for

187
00:08:28,210 --> 00:08:33,580
operators to incorporate value chain

188
00:08:31,210 --> 00:08:38,979
development concepts in the in the

189
00:08:33,580 --> 00:08:42,430
project so for us to for us to start or

190
00:08:38,979 --> 00:08:45,430
to work on a specific region we need

191
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:47,860
different elements to combine so in we

192
00:08:45,430 --> 00:08:49,630
need innovative farmers we need an

193
00:08:47,860 --> 00:08:52,060
enabling environment and we need willing

194
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:53,230
buyers so the farmers and innovative

195
00:08:52,060 --> 00:08:55,450
when they adopt sustainable

196
00:08:53,230 --> 00:08:57,250
intensification sustainable agriculture

197
00:08:55,450 --> 00:09:00,310
when they kind of do this transition

198
00:08:57,250 --> 00:09:03,220
from traditional methods to innovation

199
00:09:00,310 --> 00:09:05,220
which is what we are helping them to do

200
00:09:03,220 --> 00:09:09,100
with projects such as massage

201
00:09:05,220 --> 00:09:13,380
then we provide capacity development in

202
00:09:09,100 --> 00:09:17,019
agricultural marketing strategies and we

203
00:09:13,380 --> 00:09:19,060
we understand that promoting farming

204
00:09:17,019 --> 00:09:21,700
organization is also key for this

205
00:09:19,060 --> 00:09:24,130
innovative farmers to succeed then we

206
00:09:21,700 --> 00:09:26,079
need an enabling environment so for that

207
00:09:24,130 --> 00:09:27,610
to happen we need a public pull up

208
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:31,329
policies that support the whole process

209
00:09:27,610 --> 00:09:34,000
and we go with public policies policies

210
00:09:31,329 --> 00:09:36,250
at a multi level so not only at federal

211
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:39,850
or national level but also at a regional

212
00:09:36,250 --> 00:09:42,100
level another important factor is kind

213
00:09:39,850 --> 00:09:44,709
of identifying and highlighting the

214
00:09:42,100 --> 00:09:47,200
existing synergies amongst the different

215
00:09:44,709 --> 00:09:49,149
projects that might be conquering and

216
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,450
the same in the same region and that is

217
00:09:49,149 --> 00:09:53,920
something that has been challenging but

218
00:09:52,450 --> 00:09:55,480
we have been working through the

219
00:09:53,920 --> 00:09:59,260
different projects that are for instance

220
00:09:55,480 --> 00:10:01,570
taking place in Mexico and then the fact

221
00:09:59,260 --> 00:10:05,010
of institutional networks strengthening

222
00:10:01,570 --> 00:10:08,430
a linkages that means that we link with

223
00:10:05,010 --> 00:10:10,480
already in place he force in terms of

224
00:10:08,430 --> 00:10:14,769
trading marketing and farming

225
00:10:10,480 --> 00:10:18,310
organizations and we provide support to

226
00:10:14,769 --> 00:10:21,370
those existing structures then we need

227
00:10:18,310 --> 00:10:23,320
willing buyers so we stimulate new

228
00:10:21,370 --> 00:10:25,570
business models we will see what we

229
00:10:23,320 --> 00:10:31,120
understand for new business models in a

230
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:33,579
minute and also we look for buyers that

231
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:35,199
are interested in the tribal dimension

232
00:10:33,579 --> 00:10:37,180
of sustainability meaning

233
00:10:35,199 --> 00:10:40,779
environmentally social and economic

234
00:10:37,180 --> 00:10:43,480
sustainability of course so what do we

235
00:10:40,779 --> 00:10:45,760
understand by new business models are

236
00:10:43,480 --> 00:10:47,620
those who include the stimulation of new

237
00:10:45,760 --> 00:10:48,449
services or goods associated with

238
00:10:47,620 --> 00:10:50,560
sustainable intensification

239
00:10:48,449 --> 00:10:53,529
interventions for instance the

240
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:57,449
development of appropriate mechanization

241
00:10:53,529 --> 00:11:03,250
services or the development of

242
00:10:57,449 --> 00:11:05,769
manufacturers of post-harvest tools as

243
00:11:03,250 --> 00:11:10,410
well as generating extra added value to

244
00:11:05,769 --> 00:11:13,000
existing processes and players this is a

245
00:11:10,410 --> 00:11:16,839
drawing that you have seen thousand

246
00:11:13,000 --> 00:11:18,700
times maybe so it is the model of the is

247
00:11:16,839 --> 00:11:22,870
the infrastructure of

248
00:11:18,700 --> 00:11:25,000
innovation hub so this is a model along

249
00:11:22,870 --> 00:11:27,730
with we have been working for for some

250
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:31,590
years now so the the research platform

251
00:11:27,730 --> 00:11:36,100
is where is-where farm is where

252
00:11:31,590 --> 00:11:39,670
researchers do hypothesis and we bring

253
00:11:36,100 --> 00:11:43,930
the market related hypothesis also to

254
00:11:39,670 --> 00:11:46,120
this exercise so by using and validating

255
00:11:43,930 --> 00:11:49,570
varieties demanded by the industry into

256
00:11:46,120 --> 00:11:52,210
the research plots and also promoting

257
00:11:49,570 --> 00:11:56,610
market oriented crop rotation which also

258
00:11:52,210 --> 00:12:00,130
meets our combines or adds to agronomic

259
00:11:56,610 --> 00:12:02,590
crop rotation then we go to the modules

260
00:12:00,130 --> 00:12:06,130
or to farmers that adopt those

261
00:12:02,590 --> 00:12:08,800
technologies and we focus on income

262
00:12:06,130 --> 00:12:12,250
efficiency and contract farming as a

263
00:12:08,800 --> 00:12:18,880
couple of areas of work with these

264
00:12:12,250 --> 00:12:20,860
farmers those farmers kind of serve as a

265
00:12:18,880 --> 00:12:22,990
model for others to adopt the

266
00:12:20,860 --> 00:12:26,080
technologies and then we have the impact

267
00:12:22,990 --> 00:12:28,360
areas where we promote farmer

268
00:12:26,080 --> 00:12:32,410
organizations and a better value chain

269
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,180
integration so both are the spected

270
00:12:32,410 --> 00:12:36,250
results in farmer market linkages

271
00:12:34,180 --> 00:12:38,850
interventions these are some of them may

272
00:12:36,250 --> 00:12:41,290
be strengthened overall competitiveness

273
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:43,090
amazing with production systems from

274
00:12:41,290 --> 00:12:45,760
farm to the final product so

275
00:12:43,090 --> 00:12:48,340
understanding well seeing it can add a

276
00:12:45,760 --> 00:12:50,310
meaningful value to producers but also

277
00:12:48,340 --> 00:12:53,050
to other players in the value chain

278
00:12:50,310 --> 00:12:56,050
farmers abilities recognize developed

279
00:12:53,050 --> 00:12:59,320
and enhanced and also training is part

280
00:12:56,050 --> 00:13:03,520
of the core business of SEMA to say so

281
00:12:59,320 --> 00:13:06,670
we kind of tune up to two specific

282
00:13:03,520 --> 00:13:07,780
training on market business models based

283
00:13:06,670 --> 00:13:10,240
on the tripod dimension of

284
00:13:07,780 --> 00:13:11,950
sustainability promoted tools and

285
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:14,320
methodologies to strengthen inclusive

286
00:13:11,950 --> 00:13:17,140
market approach developed and spread and

287
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:19,890
develop foster among all value network

288
00:13:17,140 --> 00:13:22,870
actors it's important to mention that

289
00:13:19,890 --> 00:13:24,610
several players from the private sector

290
00:13:22,870 --> 00:13:27,760
but also from the public sector have

291
00:13:24,610 --> 00:13:30,460
seen value in symmetry in a neutral

292
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:32,350
facilitator of processes and this is

293
00:13:30,460 --> 00:13:34,089
something that we have been doing with

294
00:13:32,350 --> 00:13:38,040
inter-institutional working groups and

295
00:13:34,089 --> 00:13:42,579
some other spaces for common discussion

296
00:13:38,040 --> 00:13:46,209
so when when we decided when we are

297
00:13:42,579 --> 00:13:50,110
invited to provide input to a specific

298
00:13:46,209 --> 00:13:52,209
project or a specific need we start with

299
00:13:50,110 --> 00:13:54,579
that with a diagnosis so we understand

300
00:13:52,209 --> 00:13:56,290
what's going on why we are required why

301
00:13:54,579 --> 00:13:59,050
what is the problem that we try to

302
00:13:56,290 --> 00:14:01,060
tackle right so we do of course

303
00:13:59,050 --> 00:14:03,190
literature review specific for that

304
00:14:01,060 --> 00:14:07,480
region to understand what what has been

305
00:14:03,190 --> 00:14:09,850
what have been experiences that we can

306
00:14:07,480 --> 00:14:11,680
learn from then we do a collection of

307
00:14:09,850 --> 00:14:14,110
primary information through sourcing

308
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:16,990
methods such as value chain mapping and

309
00:14:14,110 --> 00:14:18,540
market research and do further

310
00:14:16,990 --> 00:14:20,769
understanding of market needs by

311
00:14:18,540 --> 00:14:24,060
understanding who would be the buyer or

312
00:14:20,769 --> 00:14:26,699
who would be the the pool force in that

313
00:14:24,060 --> 00:14:30,940
intervention that we want to promote

314
00:14:26,699 --> 00:14:33,250
then we design a customized intervention

315
00:14:30,940 --> 00:14:36,310
based on the existing model and what the

316
00:14:33,250 --> 00:14:37,750
project might require and we do start

317
00:14:36,310 --> 00:14:40,569
with the implementation of the project

318
00:14:37,750 --> 00:14:43,800
and a constant evaluation or feedback

319
00:14:40,569 --> 00:14:46,839
loop so this is an iterative process

320
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:48,610
where we incorporate information on

321
00:14:46,839 --> 00:14:50,430
communication technologies or mill

322
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:52,449
indicators monitoring evaluation

323
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:55,779
accountability and learning indications

324
00:14:52,449 --> 00:14:58,660
and learning unsustainability indicators

325
00:14:55,779 --> 00:15:00,519
that will bring into the formula then we

326
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:02,760
scale out and actually is not the idea

327
00:15:00,519 --> 00:15:05,170
they seem it does the whole process

328
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:08,680
especially not the last step of scaling

329
00:15:05,170 --> 00:15:10,690
out the ideas that we prove methodology

330
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:13,180
or that we prove an intervention to be

331
00:15:10,690 --> 00:15:15,040
worthy then the industry and the

332
00:15:13,180 --> 00:15:17,019
different players in the industry would

333
00:15:15,040 --> 00:15:19,209
have to play their role in validating

334
00:15:17,019 --> 00:15:25,420
that father and making them making it

335
00:15:19,209 --> 00:15:27,130
growth an important area as I was

336
00:15:25,420 --> 00:15:29,800
mentioning at the beginning is providing

337
00:15:27,130 --> 00:15:34,180
appropriate training so we developed

338
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:36,490
several courses marked market related

339
00:15:34,180 --> 00:15:39,399
courses or training not about they have

340
00:15:36,490 --> 00:15:42,160
been implemented yet some of them are on

341
00:15:39,399 --> 00:15:43,899
the second year some others are still to

342
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:46,180
be developed as you can see this right

343
00:15:43,899 --> 00:15:48,130
program so the ideas

344
00:15:46,180 --> 00:15:50,350
we'll be contract farming management of

345
00:15:48,130 --> 00:15:52,149
rural business farmer organizations and

346
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,190
inclusive business models and we have

347
00:15:52,149 --> 00:15:56,800
several trainings with different as

348
00:15:54,190 --> 00:16:01,750
resisted each of them each of those that

349
00:15:56,800 --> 00:16:04,020
we are pushing in our agenda and that is

350
00:16:01,750 --> 00:16:10,959
also the importance to provide

351
00:16:04,020 --> 00:16:13,600
sufficient and useful materials for

352
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:17,200
training offered the dissemination of

353
00:16:13,600 --> 00:16:19,120
information or debut that we have so one

354
00:16:17,200 --> 00:16:21,399
of the things that we think it's missing

355
00:16:19,120 --> 00:16:24,790
in a lot of cases in Mexico is is

356
00:16:21,399 --> 00:16:27,430
contrary culture and we had velop an

357
00:16:24,790 --> 00:16:30,580
explainer video explaining why it's a

358
00:16:27,430 --> 00:16:32,529
good idea maybe to organize and to and

359
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:35,110
to understand what as the other benefits

360
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:40,870
of contract agriculture being whoever it

361
00:16:35,110 --> 00:16:43,390
is who provides that contracting lastly

362
00:16:40,870 --> 00:16:45,940
for this session for this start of the

363
00:16:43,390 --> 00:16:49,170
presentation I wanted to explain that we

364
00:16:45,940 --> 00:16:53,529
are developing farmer market linkages

365
00:16:49,170 --> 00:16:56,140
specific indicators to strengthen the

366
00:16:53,529 --> 00:16:58,480
indicator matrix of the projects that we

367
00:16:56,140 --> 00:17:01,570
are working on so in the area of

368
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:04,689
productivity we are studying as results

369
00:17:01,570 --> 00:17:06,579
indicators yield profit available grain

370
00:17:04,689 --> 00:17:11,050
to trade an adoption of contract farming

371
00:17:06,579 --> 00:17:13,500
as some significant indicators and we

372
00:17:11,050 --> 00:17:15,850
are discussing also with donors what our

373
00:17:13,500 --> 00:17:18,970
impact indicators that are useful for

374
00:17:15,850 --> 00:17:20,800
them such as ill evolution profit

375
00:17:18,970 --> 00:17:23,490
evolution or market effective

376
00:17:20,800 --> 00:17:27,059
participation index which is actually a

377
00:17:23,490 --> 00:17:34,300
recent indicator that we are developing

378
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:37,260
these days so now how do we how do we go

379
00:17:34,300 --> 00:17:40,030
from all of these theory or from this

380
00:17:37,260 --> 00:17:43,240
ideas to practice or to implementation

381
00:17:40,030 --> 00:17:45,100
these are the ongoing projects in which

382
00:17:43,240 --> 00:17:49,120
there is a component of farmer market

383
00:17:45,100 --> 00:17:52,030
linkages all of them are in Mexico at

384
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:57,270
the moment all of them are in Mexico of

385
00:17:52,030 --> 00:17:59,059
course part of our lab for proving

386
00:17:57,270 --> 00:18:01,190
practices

387
00:17:59,059 --> 00:18:03,889
was the massacre of the federal project

388
00:18:01,190 --> 00:18:06,499
then we got Massaro Vanuatu well we

389
00:18:03,889 --> 00:18:08,419
could do some more in-depth specific

390
00:18:06,499 --> 00:18:11,299
research for instance in the case of

391
00:18:08,419 --> 00:18:14,330
alternative crops for Vanuatu and then

392
00:18:11,299 --> 00:18:17,120
we got several projects with main

393
00:18:14,330 --> 00:18:19,639
industry players such as Kalos Nestle or

394
00:18:17,120 --> 00:18:21,740
guru per window which have started quite

395
00:18:19,639 --> 00:18:24,320
recently within the last 12 months and

396
00:18:21,740 --> 00:18:27,289
we have also a project in its second

397
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:28,999
year now in the Finnish Rally Yucatan

398
00:18:27,289 --> 00:18:31,970
with funda theologian as al mundo Maya

399
00:18:28,999 --> 00:18:34,549
we will see a few examples of work going

400
00:18:31,970 --> 00:18:36,679
on on these projects so what kind of

401
00:18:34,549 --> 00:18:39,950
activities how do we phrase our

402
00:18:36,679 --> 00:18:43,940
interventions in those projects here

403
00:18:39,950 --> 00:18:48,169
there are some of them the idea is to

404
00:18:43,940 --> 00:18:51,590
provide value in in doing value mapping

405
00:18:48,169 --> 00:18:54,820
exercises that are relevant at the hub

406
00:18:51,590 --> 00:18:59,059
level at the regional level and we also

407
00:18:54,820 --> 00:19:01,759
feel that are in a good position to link

408
00:18:59,059 --> 00:19:04,009
the work that is very being carried out

409
00:19:01,759 --> 00:19:06,169
in terms of agronomy in terms of

410
00:19:04,009 --> 00:19:08,749
Technology Development and in terms of

411
00:19:06,169 --> 00:19:10,639
of markets so these are some of the

412
00:19:08,749 --> 00:19:13,840
areas I don't want to to read them in

413
00:19:10,639 --> 00:19:18,799
detail but you can see them here

414
00:19:13,840 --> 00:19:20,659
these are instead some typical type

415
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:24,169
ologies where we have been working for

416
00:19:20,659 --> 00:19:26,450
the last couple of years so animal feed

417
00:19:24,169 --> 00:19:29,379
sector nixtamalization industry a

418
00:19:26,450 --> 00:19:32,450
growing industries or the retail LED

419
00:19:29,379 --> 00:19:34,610
interventions or niche markets in each

420
00:19:32,450 --> 00:19:37,730
of these areas there are different goals

421
00:19:34,610 --> 00:19:40,700
depending on who is the attractor or who

422
00:19:37,730 --> 00:19:43,100
is promoting the intervention and we are

423
00:19:40,700 --> 00:19:44,509
working with different products so for

424
00:19:43,100 --> 00:19:47,119
instance the animal feed sector white

425
00:19:44,509 --> 00:19:50,149
mace is not required but triticale or

426
00:19:47,119 --> 00:19:52,940
barley are incorporated as interesting

427
00:19:50,149 --> 00:19:54,259
associated crops in the next

428
00:19:52,940 --> 00:19:56,720
immunization industry of course is

429
00:19:54,259 --> 00:20:00,200
focused on white mace niche markets

430
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:03,799
deals with landrace maize so we have a

431
00:20:00,200 --> 00:20:08,210
kind of a variety of of areas to

432
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:10,850
intervene and as part of our exercise to

433
00:20:08,210 --> 00:20:13,080
review what was going on and on in terms

434
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:15,659
of methodology we

435
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:18,659
we start we identify that link

436
00:20:15,659 --> 00:20:21,269
methodology who was which was jointly

437
00:20:18,659 --> 00:20:23,639
developed by the sea at in Colombia and

438
00:20:21,269 --> 00:20:25,620
if pre was a methodology that could be

439
00:20:23,639 --> 00:20:28,350
useful for grains and that had not been

440
00:20:25,620 --> 00:20:30,059
used for the grains so we brought some

441
00:20:28,350 --> 00:20:32,700
people from from SIA to help us

442
00:20:30,059 --> 00:20:36,179
incorporate that and this methodology

443
00:20:32,700 --> 00:20:39,389
what does is kind of assessing inclusive

444
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:42,269
and sustainable business models and in

445
00:20:39,389 --> 00:20:44,940
ethology that starts that has four main

446
00:20:42,269 --> 00:20:47,519
tools one is the value chain map which

447
00:20:44,940 --> 00:20:49,710
means ok I understand what where I am

448
00:20:47,519 --> 00:20:52,230
working who are the actors what roles

449
00:20:49,710 --> 00:20:54,169
are they playing then I design or I

450
00:20:52,230 --> 00:20:56,639
understand what is the business model

451
00:20:54,169 --> 00:20:59,279
with a business model campus to which is

452
00:20:56,639 --> 00:21:02,429
a classic pool in which we understand

453
00:20:59,279 --> 00:21:04,889
how different actors being there being

454
00:21:02,429 --> 00:21:08,159
the producer being the aggregator or

455
00:21:04,889 --> 00:21:10,610
being the end-user how do they see

456
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:13,679
themselves what kind of business to the

457
00:21:10,610 --> 00:21:16,789
thing they have or they play in the

458
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:20,190
chain then we do the new business model

459
00:21:16,789 --> 00:21:23,070
principle which is a tool to evaluate

460
00:21:20,190 --> 00:21:26,490
how inclusive trading relationship is

461
00:21:23,070 --> 00:21:28,289
and what can be modified in there and

462
00:21:26,490 --> 00:21:30,450
then we go to the fourth tool which is

463
00:21:28,289 --> 00:21:33,629
the prototype cycle or actually

464
00:21:30,450 --> 00:21:36,210
implementing those modifications into

465
00:21:33,629 --> 00:21:38,190
the business model of the of the

466
00:21:36,210 --> 00:21:40,559
organization that we think can help out

467
00:21:38,190 --> 00:21:42,929
and that is also guided by the same

468
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:44,759
participants there is a feedback loop we

469
00:21:42,929 --> 00:21:47,129
keep working on this prototype or cycle

470
00:21:44,759 --> 00:21:49,970
until we understand that business

471
00:21:47,129 --> 00:21:54,240
relationship between two players is

472
00:21:49,970 --> 00:21:57,179
actually optimized what this interesting

473
00:21:54,240 --> 00:22:01,500
is to is to is to highlight that we have

474
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:04,769
been quickly transitioning from the

475
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:06,600
reading of the let's say theory

476
00:22:04,769 --> 00:22:10,080
materials to the implementation of those

477
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,639
in field so in for in front of the

478
00:22:10,080 --> 00:22:16,519
certain projects that I mentioned before

479
00:22:11,639 --> 00:22:22,679
in 2007 we in 2016 and 2017 we have been

480
00:22:16,519 --> 00:22:25,830
training let's say project partners to

481
00:22:22,679 --> 00:22:26,400
implement link in their in the regions

482
00:22:25,830 --> 00:22:29,310
as

483
00:22:26,400 --> 00:22:33,500
we have some some examples here in

484
00:22:29,310 --> 00:22:35,850
Massaro we have got like six cases of

485
00:22:33,500 --> 00:22:38,130
partners that are being using League

486
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:39,870
have been using linked masada wanna hot

487
00:22:38,130 --> 00:22:41,520
as well in the Kellogg's project as well

488
00:22:39,870 --> 00:22:45,600
and in the mill packet on project as

489
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:49,410
well so as you can see some of this work

490
00:22:45,600 --> 00:22:51,750
is done with native language made some

491
00:22:49,410 --> 00:22:55,170
other is done with more typical or

492
00:22:51,750 --> 00:22:58,410
hybrid products certified products etc

493
00:22:55,170 --> 00:23:01,080
so we have different different scenarios

494
00:22:58,410 --> 00:23:02,850
and different market topologies that we

495
00:23:01,080 --> 00:23:05,100
have been mapping and this is the

496
00:23:02,850 --> 00:23:07,980
numbers one two three four refer to

497
00:23:05,100 --> 00:23:10,680
those numbers and the stage to which we

498
00:23:07,980 --> 00:23:12,450
have reached to date in those

499
00:23:10,680 --> 00:23:14,900
collaborations here we have some

500
00:23:12,450 --> 00:23:18,060
pictures from the field from our

501
00:23:14,900 --> 00:23:20,460
partners from these organizations in

502
00:23:18,060 --> 00:23:23,280
Mexico that are conducting this value

503
00:23:20,460 --> 00:23:25,140
chain mapping and following exercises

504
00:23:23,280 --> 00:23:27,030
this is exercise one value chain mapping

505
00:23:25,140 --> 00:23:29,430
this is exercise to well you do the

506
00:23:27,030 --> 00:23:31,010
model the business model canvas and it's

507
00:23:29,430 --> 00:23:35,040
interesting to see that they have been

508
00:23:31,010 --> 00:23:39,480
quite happy and finding useful this this

509
00:23:35,040 --> 00:23:41,610
methodology this is actually inputs that

510
00:23:39,480 --> 00:23:45,080
have been sent to us during the last

511
00:23:41,610 --> 00:23:48,300
month from from these associated

512
00:23:45,080 --> 00:23:52,970
organizations so here we can see the

513
00:23:48,300 --> 00:23:52,970
body chain map of the north of La Scala

514
00:23:53,090 --> 00:23:58,950
and we can see here kind of the hwacha

515
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:01,560
rate data we can have with this

516
00:23:58,950 --> 00:24:03,420
exercises so this is these are specific

517
00:24:01,560 --> 00:24:05,880
commercial data gathering from the

518
00:24:03,420 --> 00:24:08,400
Fronteras caliber we have the different

519
00:24:05,880 --> 00:24:11,370
buyers that have been identified what is

520
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:14,760
the buying price that they pay for the

521
00:24:11,370 --> 00:24:17,040
product what is the kind of payment

522
00:24:14,760 --> 00:24:20,130
method that they utilize what is the

523
00:24:17,040 --> 00:24:22,650
demand the estimated total demand that

524
00:24:20,130 --> 00:24:24,600
the buyer can have and some quality

525
00:24:22,650 --> 00:24:28,440
requirements so as you can understand

526
00:24:24,600 --> 00:24:31,950
this is very useful information for for

527
00:24:28,440 --> 00:24:36,150
for farmers to know and for farm

528
00:24:31,950 --> 00:24:40,210
advisors to contribute to in fact

529
00:24:36,150 --> 00:24:43,290
Atticus estate we did

530
00:24:40,210 --> 00:24:47,830
case of comparing ving and sunflower

531
00:24:43,290 --> 00:24:49,920
work we actually validated that by using

532
00:24:47,830 --> 00:24:52,180
some flower in the innovation plot and

533
00:24:49,920 --> 00:24:55,450
being in the control plot which is a

534
00:24:52,180 --> 00:24:58,240
typical product in in that region we

535
00:24:55,450 --> 00:25:00,940
could see that maybe the benefit cost

536
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:04,660
ratio of using sunflower could be

537
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:07,120
actually better so we were a company in

538
00:25:04,660 --> 00:25:09,190
some producers to move from being to

539
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:12,760
some flower and to understand also what

540
00:25:09,190 --> 00:25:18,910
was the estimate demand for for

541
00:25:12,760 --> 00:25:21,670
sunflower as a sum as an example of of

542
00:25:18,910 --> 00:25:25,350
the desert some pictures of workshops

543
00:25:21,670 --> 00:25:28,180
that we conducted in in 2016 and we

544
00:25:25,350 --> 00:25:31,060
reached about two thousand six hundred

545
00:25:28,180 --> 00:25:35,560
forty producers and other players in

546
00:25:31,060 --> 00:25:39,250
this eruption were access to farmer

547
00:25:35,560 --> 00:25:42,700
market linkages component some other

548
00:25:39,250 --> 00:25:47,530
cases that I wanted to to share with you

549
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:49,240
is the project in Yucatan is in this

550
00:25:47,530 --> 00:25:52,170
project we have a component to promote

551
00:25:49,240 --> 00:25:55,690
Landry's land resumes in niche markets

552
00:25:52,170 --> 00:25:58,170
so some of the activities that we have

553
00:25:55,690 --> 00:26:00,400
been doing leading to that objective is

554
00:25:58,170 --> 00:26:02,200
participatory workshop with farmers to

555
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:06,430
review the projects commercialization

556
00:26:02,200 --> 00:26:08,170
strategy so as link suggests we don't

557
00:26:06,430 --> 00:26:10,870
arrive to a community and say this is

558
00:26:08,170 --> 00:26:12,900
what you need to do rather we go there

559
00:26:10,870 --> 00:26:16,480
we work with farmers we understand

560
00:26:12,900 --> 00:26:18,850
through participatory workshops what

561
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:20,500
they want to do if they want to actually

562
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:22,390
trade with their products if they feel

563
00:26:20,500 --> 00:26:25,240
comfortable comfortable with the way

564
00:26:22,390 --> 00:26:29,470
they are managing their selling and so

565
00:26:25,240 --> 00:26:32,560
on then we work on a catalog to promote

566
00:26:29,470 --> 00:26:36,460
landrace maize which has been kind of

567
00:26:32,560 --> 00:26:38,200
it's being a complex exercise because we

568
00:26:36,460 --> 00:26:41,280
need to carefully assess what is the

569
00:26:38,200 --> 00:26:43,570
available volume that can be traded

570
00:26:41,280 --> 00:26:46,780
especially in communities that have not

571
00:26:43,570 --> 00:26:49,500
been trading before so this is part of

572
00:26:46,780 --> 00:26:53,049
the of the exercises that we are doing

573
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:55,029
we review and provide

574
00:26:53,049 --> 00:26:57,940
to the donor and to other interested

575
00:26:55,029 --> 00:27:01,830
parties key considerations in terms of

576
00:26:57,940 --> 00:27:04,659
pricing and logistics and the last

577
00:27:01,830 --> 00:27:07,090
activity that we are doing is actually a

578
00:27:04,659 --> 00:27:10,779
tasting workshop where metallic Palacios

579
00:27:07,090 --> 00:27:13,090
is helping to to plan which is scheduled

580
00:27:10,779 --> 00:27:15,610
for for next January where we will have

581
00:27:13,090 --> 00:27:19,090
chef and consumers characterizing

582
00:27:15,610 --> 00:27:22,509
organoleptic characteristics of this of

583
00:27:19,090 --> 00:27:25,059
three selected maize varieties that have

584
00:27:22,509 --> 00:27:27,940
maybe a volume higher than others in the

585
00:27:25,059 --> 00:27:31,149
in the peninsula Yucatan and that can be

586
00:27:27,940 --> 00:27:36,489
traded and appreciated by chefs and the

587
00:27:31,149 --> 00:27:40,239
consumers this this slide shows part of

588
00:27:36,489 --> 00:27:41,379
the variables that we have been reading

589
00:27:40,239 --> 00:27:44,499
in the field that we have been observing

590
00:27:41,379 --> 00:27:48,330
in the field and that we include into

591
00:27:44,499 --> 00:27:51,159
our recommendations to to the players so

592
00:27:48,330 --> 00:27:53,769
for instance in the case of Landry's

593
00:27:51,159 --> 00:27:57,070
maize producing in parallel Yucatan it

594
00:27:53,769 --> 00:27:59,019
it of course belongs to the milpa Sibley

595
00:27:57,070 --> 00:28:02,440
mill persistence or milpa system is

596
00:27:59,019 --> 00:28:06,700
highly conditioned by weather and by

597
00:28:02,440 --> 00:28:08,619
seasonal area of milk by itself then in

598
00:28:06,700 --> 00:28:12,850
terms of prices we have observed in

599
00:28:08,619 --> 00:28:18,309
local markets that price buys from 5 to

600
00:28:12,850 --> 00:28:20,470
12 pesos a kilo there are also

601
00:28:18,309 --> 00:28:23,820
opportunities to add extra value to

602
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:29,129
product for instance premium quality or

603
00:28:23,820 --> 00:28:32,409
certification to date there is no extra

604
00:28:29,129 --> 00:28:33,970
value to to to the to the product itself

605
00:28:32,409 --> 00:28:38,859
so we think there is an opportunity

606
00:28:33,970 --> 00:28:41,769
there to increase so how the price that

607
00:28:38,859 --> 00:28:43,389
the farmers would receive and also it's

608
00:28:41,769 --> 00:28:45,879
very important that we are always

609
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:48,399
highlighting this part in order to avoid

610
00:28:45,879 --> 00:28:50,649
local market distortions we need further

611
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,989
understanding or detail understanding of

612
00:28:50,649 --> 00:28:56,019
local market dynamics to establish

613
00:28:52,989 --> 00:29:00,190
maximum buying prices so high prices

614
00:28:56,019 --> 00:29:02,529
might differ existing equilibrium in

615
00:29:00,190 --> 00:29:05,510
terms of cell consumption or internal

616
00:29:02,529 --> 00:29:11,120
trade within the community those are

617
00:29:05,510 --> 00:29:14,690
the variables our under affection that

618
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:19,100
we have been seeing how the price shapes

619
00:29:14,690 --> 00:29:21,440
in a specific local market so this take

620
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:24,740
up this takes us to or to the whole

621
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:26,840
other range of products or projects that

622
00:29:24,740 --> 00:29:30,740
we are developing so lately we have been

623
00:29:26,840 --> 00:29:32,840
writing and implementing projects on

624
00:29:30,740 --> 00:29:36,770
responsible sourcing as you can as you

625
00:29:32,840 --> 00:29:39,050
have seen this is kind of um kind of a

626
00:29:36,770 --> 00:29:42,080
purpose that can be applied to most of

627
00:29:39,050 --> 00:29:45,080
them kind of the the objective that we

628
00:29:42,080 --> 00:29:47,270
want to to pursue so to build and to con

629
00:29:45,080 --> 00:29:49,700
and to consolidate a commercial is sound

630
00:29:47,270 --> 00:29:51,560
responsible sourcing model aligned with

631
00:29:49,700 --> 00:29:53,180
the vision procedures and requirement of

632
00:29:51,560 --> 00:29:55,310
the other industry promoting the

633
00:29:53,180 --> 00:29:57,590
development of business relationships

634
00:29:55,310 --> 00:29:59,660
based on trust stability and reciprocal

635
00:29:57,590 --> 00:30:02,330
profit generation and allowing companies

636
00:29:59,660 --> 00:30:03,980
to meet the local mace and we demand as

637
00:30:02,330 --> 00:30:06,290
we have been seen and as we have been

638
00:30:03,980 --> 00:30:10,700
discussing for the last years

639
00:30:06,290 --> 00:30:12,440
if CIMMYT has now this this vision this

640
00:30:10,700 --> 00:30:15,070
wider vision on interventions in the

641
00:30:12,440 --> 00:30:18,410
value chain and we have seen that

642
00:30:15,070 --> 00:30:22,340
several companies have an interest in

643
00:30:18,410 --> 00:30:25,330
shifting from import to establishing

644
00:30:22,340 --> 00:30:28,910
long term relationships with local

645
00:30:25,330 --> 00:30:30,500
producers of of major wit so that's kind

646
00:30:28,910 --> 00:30:32,660
of the word that we are doing with as I

647
00:30:30,500 --> 00:30:37,250
was saying before callousness lay or

648
00:30:32,660 --> 00:30:40,840
bimbo so we kind of combine the pool and

649
00:30:37,250 --> 00:30:42,860
the push mechanism to create an enabling

650
00:30:40,840 --> 00:30:46,010
environment for responsible sourcing

651
00:30:42,860 --> 00:30:48,110
projects to thrive those are at the at

652
00:30:46,010 --> 00:30:52,430
the left we have some some activities

653
00:30:48,110 --> 00:30:54,740
that we that we do in terms of pool or

654
00:30:52,430 --> 00:30:56,650
push as you can see value chain mapping

655
00:30:54,740 --> 00:30:59,500
and analysis support to private sector

656
00:30:56,650 --> 00:31:04,160
in building a reliable local procurement

657
00:30:59,500 --> 00:31:05,570
capacity development the the support on

658
00:31:04,160 --> 00:31:07,250
sustainable intensification with

659
00:31:05,570 --> 00:31:09,770
technologies and agronomy that we do in

660
00:31:07,250 --> 00:31:13,190
every project market oriented production

661
00:31:09,770 --> 00:31:15,440
and of course another value that we are

662
00:31:13,190 --> 00:31:17,480
shaping is traceability and

663
00:31:15,440 --> 00:31:18,890
sustainability indicators all the way

664
00:31:17,480 --> 00:31:24,740
from farm

665
00:31:18,890 --> 00:31:27,440
- to the company so here we have some

666
00:31:24,740 --> 00:31:31,040
drawings on what kind of interventions

667
00:31:27,440 --> 00:31:32,930
do we do we do and how do we explain it

668
00:31:31,040 --> 00:31:37,460
so for instance this is the case of

669
00:31:32,930 --> 00:31:38,890
Nestle and as Nev wants to increase the

670
00:31:37,460 --> 00:31:41,240
radio of

671
00:31:38,890 --> 00:31:43,580
local procurement of maize in the state

672
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,900
of Vanuatu which is which is actually

673
00:31:43,580 --> 00:31:49,640
quite low now and depends on a couple of

674
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:51,530
intermediaries and this is kind of the

675
00:31:49,640 --> 00:31:54,110
way we saw it so we see okay there is

676
00:31:51,530 --> 00:31:57,620
this company that has a high volume

677
00:31:54,110 --> 00:31:59,600
demand there are farmers everywhere in

678
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:01,970
the state most of them are disconnected

679
00:31:59,600 --> 00:32:05,830
some received technical assistance but

680
00:32:01,970 --> 00:32:08,630
it's just occasionally and there are not

681
00:32:05,830 --> 00:32:11,330
enough there is not maybe enough

682
00:32:08,630 --> 00:32:14,600
infrastructure in the region in terms of

683
00:32:11,330 --> 00:32:16,910
storage or logistics so there are some

684
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:19,280
problems that we have identified so how

685
00:32:16,910 --> 00:32:22,630
can we solve these problems well in

686
00:32:19,280 --> 00:32:27,320
terms of reaching we can help

687
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:29,360
identifying farmers and help them - or

688
00:32:27,320 --> 00:32:31,790
convince them to create organizations so

689
00:32:29,360 --> 00:32:34,090
this SP Aristotle provision rule also is

690
00:32:31,790 --> 00:32:36,890
family organizations getting together so

691
00:32:34,090 --> 00:32:39,260
technical assistance is provided by the

692
00:32:36,890 --> 00:32:41,720
project or by align projects in this

693
00:32:39,260 --> 00:32:43,340
case the government of Guanajuato is

694
00:32:41,720 --> 00:32:45,320
paying massive eluana hot is funding

695
00:32:43,340 --> 00:32:48,230
masala Vanuatu and that helps of course

696
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:50,930
to other players that want to to buy

697
00:32:48,230 --> 00:32:53,530
maize in the rhythm major wheat actually

698
00:32:50,930 --> 00:32:56,990
in the case of Nestle is maize and wheat

699
00:32:53,530 --> 00:32:59,090
then we have a component component of

700
00:32:56,990 --> 00:33:01,400
work with the communities and that was

701
00:32:59,090 --> 00:33:04,850
for the specific request of the donor so

702
00:33:01,400 --> 00:33:06,880
we are promoting bio 45 major qpm in

703
00:33:04,850 --> 00:33:10,160
some self-consumption

704
00:33:06,880 --> 00:33:13,910
areas or smaller farmers in the state of

705
00:33:10,160 --> 00:33:16,510
Vanuatu we developed sustainability

706
00:33:13,910 --> 00:33:20,510
indicators together with the company and

707
00:33:16,510 --> 00:33:23,510
we we are making sure with our

708
00:33:20,510 --> 00:33:26,600
monitoring evaluation system that those

709
00:33:23,510 --> 00:33:31,220
indicators are being captured then we

710
00:33:26,600 --> 00:33:31,680
also work with a number of partners but

711
00:33:31,220 --> 00:33:33,210
also

712
00:33:31,680 --> 00:33:35,940
Financial Partners to make sure that

713
00:33:33,210 --> 00:33:37,590
there is the in that to make sure that

714
00:33:35,940 --> 00:33:41,760
the infrastructure needed for this

715
00:33:37,590 --> 00:33:46,050
project to to work is built is in place

716
00:33:41,760 --> 00:33:48,300
and well this is kind of the drawing of

717
00:33:46,050 --> 00:33:51,540
the intervention and we also understand

718
00:33:48,300 --> 00:33:54,390
that there are several kind of producers

719
00:33:51,540 --> 00:33:56,940
in this in this scenario and that in

720
00:33:54,390 --> 00:34:00,030
parallel we are going to work with these

721
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:02,250
three kind of group of producers and we

722
00:34:00,030 --> 00:34:05,150
are actually helping them to transition

723
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:07,830
from one category to other category so

724
00:34:05,150 --> 00:34:11,730
here for instance category C would be

725
00:34:07,830 --> 00:34:15,690
the producers who are not linked to

726
00:34:11,730 --> 00:34:18,480
markets and that are living like far

727
00:34:15,690 --> 00:34:22,080
from the I don't know from the company

728
00:34:18,480 --> 00:34:25,170
reach out so we work with them to make

729
00:34:22,080 --> 00:34:27,240
them visible the importance of working

730
00:34:25,170 --> 00:34:30,300
together of forming organizations

731
00:34:27,240 --> 00:34:32,900
increasing the quality the majority of

732
00:34:30,300 --> 00:34:35,750
their product so hopefully these

733
00:34:32,900 --> 00:34:39,000
producers would transition into two B

734
00:34:35,750 --> 00:34:41,610
which are farmers who are already

735
00:34:39,000 --> 00:34:43,500
organized but they are not added adding

736
00:34:41,610 --> 00:34:45,900
extra value they are selling their

737
00:34:43,500 --> 00:34:47,760
products to maybe a copy of others to

738
00:34:45,900 --> 00:34:49,890
those who are storage and then sell to

739
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:52,410
the company so maybe if these

740
00:34:49,890 --> 00:34:54,480
organizations could do the the wrong

741
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:58,620
storage could add some value or could

742
00:34:54,480 --> 00:35:00,810
help could get a better price for the

743
00:34:58,620 --> 00:35:02,760
service they provide and we have the

744
00:35:00,810 --> 00:35:04,950
aggregate Orozco Murphy analyst who are

745
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:08,370
those who typically have been working

746
00:35:04,950 --> 00:35:10,910
with with the company so Nestle or other

747
00:35:08,370 --> 00:35:14,250
companies of course rely in big

748
00:35:10,910 --> 00:35:15,840
aggregators but the percentage of grain

749
00:35:14,250 --> 00:35:18,600
that they obtain from these aggregators

750
00:35:15,840 --> 00:35:22,770
is going to reduce as a percentage as

751
00:35:18,600 --> 00:35:27,600
other farmers become suppliers as well

752
00:35:22,770 --> 00:35:31,320
of the company this is an example of

753
00:35:27,600 --> 00:35:37,200
work instead with with Kellogg's what we

754
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:41,280
have been identifying what was what were

755
00:35:37,200 --> 00:35:42,990
the main bottlenecks between the company

756
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:44,530
are the main and the main aggregator

757
00:35:42,990 --> 00:35:47,230
that they

758
00:35:44,530 --> 00:35:49,900
deal with so whoever is familiar with

759
00:35:47,230 --> 00:35:52,660
link methodology and we will understand

760
00:35:49,900 --> 00:35:54,610
that this is one of the tools that we

761
00:35:52,660 --> 00:35:58,990
utilize which is a scorecard analysis

762
00:35:54,610 --> 00:36:01,360
well we see the perception of how good

763
00:35:58,990 --> 00:36:03,580
how healthy is the relationship and the

764
00:36:01,360 --> 00:36:05,620
mutual understanding between the company

765
00:36:03,580 --> 00:36:08,500
and the main aggregator and going we see

766
00:36:05,620 --> 00:36:10,450
that there is a difference in in reading

767
00:36:08,500 --> 00:36:13,090
or understanding of the position then we

768
00:36:10,450 --> 00:36:16,600
kind of try to solve this this

769
00:36:13,090 --> 00:36:18,160
difference then we do a value chain we

770
00:36:16,600 --> 00:36:20,560
have done a value chain risk matrix

771
00:36:18,160 --> 00:36:22,630
understanding what were the main factors

772
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:24,910
that could offer that could affect the

773
00:36:22,630 --> 00:36:27,340
sustainability of the of the company

774
00:36:24,910 --> 00:36:29,440
business and we provided this kind of

775
00:36:27,340 --> 00:36:31,680
exercises which is not Chinese but

776
00:36:29,440 --> 00:36:33,960
almost but the company has the code I

777
00:36:31,680 --> 00:36:36,100
couldn't I didn't want to put here

778
00:36:33,960 --> 00:36:37,630
exactly go to where the recommendations

779
00:36:36,100 --> 00:36:40,030
because this is of course confidential

780
00:36:37,630 --> 00:36:43,030
information but we identified different

781
00:36:40,030 --> 00:36:46,120
kind of risks we identified possible

782
00:36:43,030 --> 00:36:48,940
mitigation strategies and suggested

783
00:36:46,120 --> 00:36:51,940
route of action this is also an example

784
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:57,010
of a value chain map that we conducted

785
00:36:51,940 --> 00:36:58,630
for for for this last project and well

786
00:36:57,010 --> 00:37:01,740
this take this takes me to the last

787
00:36:58,630 --> 00:37:04,330
slide which is what is coming

788
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:07,540
we have been quite I would say quite

789
00:37:04,330 --> 00:37:10,600
dynamic during the last few months in

790
00:37:07,540 --> 00:37:14,800
incorporating new topics we would like

791
00:37:10,600 --> 00:37:16,780
to see what is the what what are the

792
00:37:14,800 --> 00:37:19,000
opportunities to include public

793
00:37:16,780 --> 00:37:21,850
procurement responsible public

794
00:37:19,000 --> 00:37:25,150
procurement into the grain sector so

795
00:37:21,850 --> 00:37:26,520
there are some projects in Brazil and

796
00:37:25,150 --> 00:37:30,790
also in the European Union of

797
00:37:26,520 --> 00:37:32,560
governments buying grain for I don't

798
00:37:30,790 --> 00:37:35,650
know it can be for it for the jail for

799
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:39,580
the pigeon system for the schools and so

800
00:37:35,650 --> 00:37:42,400
this public expenditure in food is been

801
00:37:39,580 --> 00:37:45,340
reoriented to more to incorporate some

802
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:47,800
sustainable indicators or or awareness

803
00:37:45,340 --> 00:37:52,300
kind of awareness another area of work

804
00:37:47,800 --> 00:37:55,180
is using the information communication

805
00:37:52,300 --> 00:37:57,430
tools for for weather trust ability and

806
00:37:55,180 --> 00:38:00,460
transparency

807
00:37:57,430 --> 00:38:02,470
it is interesting to notice that IBM or

808
00:38:00,460 --> 00:38:04,630
Walmart have been doing have been

809
00:38:02,470 --> 00:38:08,589
working with blockchain technology to

810
00:38:04,630 --> 00:38:11,230
incorporate those elements of high-end

811
00:38:08,589 --> 00:38:13,270
technology into the food sector and we

812
00:38:11,230 --> 00:38:14,710
think that seemeth could also play a

813
00:38:13,270 --> 00:38:16,630
role there we are working on

814
00:38:14,710 --> 00:38:20,940
understanding what could we actually our

815
00:38:16,630 --> 00:38:23,109
fit the organization such as the

816
00:38:20,940 --> 00:38:27,010
sustainable agriculture initiative or

817
00:38:23,109 --> 00:38:29,950
ICL Alliance which actually support

818
00:38:27,010 --> 00:38:33,849
companies in developing sustainability

819
00:38:29,950 --> 00:38:35,440
standards and we are in contact with

820
00:38:33,849 --> 00:38:37,720
this with these organizations to

821
00:38:35,440 --> 00:38:40,180
understand what is coming next in terms

822
00:38:37,720 --> 00:38:43,240
of sustainability indicators so that we

823
00:38:40,180 --> 00:38:46,089
can be ready to provide that kind of

824
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:48,190
information to the companies or to

825
00:38:46,089 --> 00:38:50,619
whoever we are working with in projects

826
00:38:48,190 --> 00:38:53,890
and another element that we would like

827
00:38:50,619 --> 00:38:57,339
to incorporate that within next year may

828
00:38:53,890 --> 00:38:59,859
be is participatory guarantee systems or

829
00:38:57,339 --> 00:39:01,480
participatory certification also known

830
00:38:59,859 --> 00:39:05,790
as participatory participatory

831
00:39:01,480 --> 00:39:09,490
certification as close to zero cost

832
00:39:05,790 --> 00:39:12,059
option for farmers to certify the

833
00:39:09,490 --> 00:39:15,930
product which we think is something that

834
00:39:12,059 --> 00:39:19,210
there are several cases of of success

835
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:20,950
particularly in Asia now Mexico is kind

836
00:39:19,210 --> 00:39:22,569
of starting to explore this self

837
00:39:20,950 --> 00:39:26,380
certification scheme within something

838
00:39:22,569 --> 00:39:30,270
what we can contribute to and that was

839
00:39:26,380 --> 00:39:36,130
surrounded i hopes you

840
00:39:30,270 --> 00:39:39,020
[Applause]

841
00:39:36,130 --> 00:39:43,040
if you have questions now we have some

842
00:39:39,020 --> 00:39:44,750
minutes and I'm happy to respond Thank

843
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,370
You Victor for the presentation I think

844
00:39:44,750 --> 00:39:48,440
you showed a lot of tools which is

845
00:39:46,370 --> 00:39:49,010
always nice I think showing really how

846
00:39:48,440 --> 00:39:50,780
to do it

847
00:39:49,010 --> 00:39:52,730
of course my question is about scaling

848
00:39:50,780 --> 00:39:54,170
because the word even popped up may when

849
00:39:52,730 --> 00:39:58,040
you can go to I think it's the fifth

850
00:39:54,170 --> 00:40:00,080
slide or so you had this flow chart and

851
00:39:58,040 --> 00:40:05,840
then at the end it was like and now we

852
00:40:00,080 --> 00:40:08,990
need to scale out yeah that one so my

853
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:10,640
question is now you say we focus very

854
00:40:08,990 --> 00:40:12,530
much on the design its implementation

855
00:40:10,640 --> 00:40:14,570
and then the next step would be scale

856
00:40:12,530 --> 00:40:16,040
out right so I think I assume that in

857
00:40:14,570 --> 00:40:18,350
the first two blocks you reach maybe

858
00:40:16,040 --> 00:40:20,420
hundreds of thousands of beneficiary

859
00:40:18,350 --> 00:40:22,970
basically and the next you want to go to

860
00:40:20,420 --> 00:40:24,890
millions right so I think you would

861
00:40:22,970 --> 00:40:26,870
agree that this is maybe more complex

862
00:40:24,890 --> 00:40:29,930
then then what we're actually doing now

863
00:40:26,870 --> 00:40:32,930
so question is what how do you see the

864
00:40:29,930 --> 00:40:35,210
role in in supporting that scaling out

865
00:40:32,930 --> 00:40:38,390
process and and B we should take the

866
00:40:35,210 --> 00:40:40,550
leadership on that block then if we are

867
00:40:38,390 --> 00:40:42,140
not going to do it well I think it

868
00:40:40,550 --> 00:40:45,320
scaling out has to go through different

869
00:40:42,140 --> 00:40:47,000
steps or through different phases and to

870
00:40:45,320 --> 00:40:49,640
the last station we are probably not

871
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:54,050
going to be the lead of that reaching

872
00:40:49,640 --> 00:40:57,050
millions but we can do some we can do

873
00:40:54,050 --> 00:41:00,590
some interventions in a way to make sure

874
00:40:57,050 --> 00:41:03,080
that a process is validated and it works

875
00:41:00,590 --> 00:41:05,930
out so for instance it wouldn't be

876
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:07,550
enough if we assume it start

877
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:09,020
implementing the link methodology and

878
00:41:07,550 --> 00:41:11,150
think look this is something which is

879
00:41:09,020 --> 00:41:13,160
working out but we don't help others to

880
00:41:11,150 --> 00:41:15,890
do that and we don't count on others

881
00:41:13,160 --> 00:41:18,140
opinion to do that so as a first step

882
00:41:15,890 --> 00:41:23,360
into this scaling out exercise is to

883
00:41:18,140 --> 00:41:25,490
work with different partners who are

884
00:41:23,360 --> 00:41:27,050
private small companies providing

885
00:41:25,490 --> 00:41:29,360
services to aggregate to farmers in

886
00:41:27,050 --> 00:41:31,220
Mexico that have been trained and are

887
00:41:29,360 --> 00:41:33,230
using themselves this methodology and

888
00:41:31,220 --> 00:41:35,630
seeing if there is any value in that so

889
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:37,250
if they understand they understand that

890
00:41:35,630 --> 00:41:39,920
that's useful they will do their own

891
00:41:37,250 --> 00:41:44,330
business by by providing that service

892
00:41:39,920 --> 00:41:47,090
and that's a first step to scale out

893
00:41:44,330 --> 00:41:50,480
then the same thing similarly it works

894
00:41:47,090 --> 00:41:52,760
with the companies so the companies when

895
00:41:50,480 --> 00:41:55,280
they see that a pilot is working out

896
00:41:52,760 --> 00:41:57,260
successfully for them for instance in

897
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:59,180
the case of bimbo it's very clear that

898
00:41:57,260 --> 00:42:01,190
what they want to do is a pilot because

899
00:41:59,180 --> 00:42:02,750
they want to focus on I don't know it's

900
00:42:01,190 --> 00:42:05,780
not even ten percent of their total

901
00:42:02,750 --> 00:42:07,550
procurement but the idea is to scale

902
00:42:05,780 --> 00:42:09,110
their is to scale it out to other

903
00:42:07,550 --> 00:42:11,240
regions to other countries to other

904
00:42:09,110 --> 00:42:12,710
crops or maybe in the case of mix of

905
00:42:11,240 --> 00:42:15,200
meme or not to other crops but maybe in

906
00:42:12,710 --> 00:42:17,450
the case of Kellogg's they have more

907
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:19,280
different ingredients they would do that

908
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:22,310
in other ingredients so we just kind of

909
00:42:19,280 --> 00:42:25,690
put the seed in there and see if we can

910
00:42:22,310 --> 00:42:28,280
support to the scale out process but

911
00:42:25,690 --> 00:42:32,140
it's a complex it's a complex topic of

912
00:42:28,280 --> 00:42:32,140
their I think they're working on that

913
00:42:40,800 --> 00:42:45,460
could you tell us more about the

914
00:42:42,850 --> 00:42:48,670
indicators of sustainable farming and

915
00:42:45,460 --> 00:42:50,470
whether those can all get into climate

916
00:42:48,670 --> 00:42:56,800
change amelioration or any of those

917
00:42:50,470 --> 00:42:59,610
aspects there are indicators in most of

918
00:42:56,800 --> 00:43:05,910
our projects we have indicators of

919
00:42:59,610 --> 00:43:08,980
knowledge of environmental environmental

920
00:43:05,910 --> 00:43:11,890
area enough production or productivity

921
00:43:08,980 --> 00:43:14,140
so in terms of farmer market linkages we

922
00:43:11,890 --> 00:43:18,730
are more focusing on those having to

923
00:43:14,140 --> 00:43:20,560
deal with productivity aside refer

924
00:43:18,730 --> 00:43:23,770
briefly there are several organizations

925
00:43:20,560 --> 00:43:26,470
working on sustainability indicators for

926
00:43:23,770 --> 00:43:28,720
the agricultural sector so we discuss

927
00:43:26,470 --> 00:43:30,490
with specific d'Honneur in each case

928
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:34,090
what kind of indicators are you

929
00:43:30,490 --> 00:43:35,440
interested in some of them most of the

930
00:43:34,090 --> 00:43:37,090
indicators that the company are

931
00:43:35,440 --> 00:43:39,670
interested in belong to the matter

932
00:43:37,090 --> 00:43:43,000
mental part or to the income part so I

933
00:43:39,670 --> 00:43:45,700
want my farmers to be more successful in

934
00:43:43,000 --> 00:43:47,260
terms of return of investment or I want

935
00:43:45,700 --> 00:43:51,760
my farmers to have a better management

936
00:43:47,260 --> 00:43:54,190
of the water so some of them are managed

937
00:43:51,760 --> 00:43:57,520
by our colleagues of the ergonomics and

938
00:43:54,190 --> 00:43:59,410
some others are go cows walk out by by

939
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,200
ourselves so these are the ones that we

940
00:43:59,410 --> 00:44:04,000
are kind of monitoring more closely

941
00:44:01,200 --> 00:44:06,520
controlling so we understand that is not

942
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,680
only about producing more battery but

943
00:44:06,520 --> 00:44:11,160
about being more competitive in the way

944
00:44:08,680 --> 00:44:14,170
you produce and by indicating and by

945
00:44:11,160 --> 00:44:17,320
monitoring that over the years we

946
00:44:14,170 --> 00:44:22,090
understand that as a farmer has been

947
00:44:17,320 --> 00:44:25,930
successfully incorporating more more

948
00:44:22,090 --> 00:44:27,820
profit into the into its business there

949
00:44:25,930 --> 00:44:29,560
is this this last indicator I was

950
00:44:27,820 --> 00:44:32,740
referring before market effective

951
00:44:29,560 --> 00:44:35,410
participation index refers to to what

952
00:44:32,740 --> 00:44:38,560
extent a farm at is aware of the

953
00:44:35,410 --> 00:44:42,220
existence of different markets and how

954
00:44:38,560 --> 00:44:44,260
he or she plan strategically his

955
00:44:42,220 --> 00:44:46,420
production towards meeting market

956
00:44:44,260 --> 00:44:48,310
demands so that's an indicator that

957
00:44:46,420 --> 00:44:50,590
after a number of years we understand

958
00:44:48,310 --> 00:44:52,390
how that farmer has transition

959
00:44:50,590 --> 00:44:54,580
and that is valuable for us to

960
00:44:52,390 --> 00:44:57,550
understand whether it had make sense our

961
00:44:54,580 --> 00:45:00,850
intervention or not still is an area

962
00:44:57,550 --> 00:45:04,840
under the constant development and

963
00:45:00,850 --> 00:45:10,920
review but I hope this addresses a bit

964
00:45:04,840 --> 00:45:10,920
your question yes

965
00:45:32,230 --> 00:45:37,760
all right soon

966
00:45:35,270 --> 00:45:41,060
our job is international agricultural

967
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:42,970
research so we should also be interested

968
00:45:41,060 --> 00:45:46,330
in ensuring comparability across

969
00:45:42,970 --> 00:45:50,780
countries regions and so on so these

970
00:45:46,330 --> 00:45:52,490
indicators you know it would help if we

971
00:45:50,780 --> 00:45:55,480
can ensure some kind of comparability

972
00:45:52,490 --> 00:45:58,130
with say what we're doing in South Asia

973
00:45:55,480 --> 00:46:01,670
so number one would be water use

974
00:45:58,130 --> 00:46:07,580
efficiency - nutrient use efficiency

975
00:46:01,670 --> 00:46:15,620
from a and three emissions and are they

976
00:46:07,580 --> 00:46:22,700
covered or not well what we're doing BOM

977
00:46:15,620 --> 00:46:25,070
do you want to yeah just an example

978
00:46:22,700 --> 00:46:28,040
there is the table of indicators which

979
00:46:25,070 --> 00:46:29,900
includes most ability greenhouse gases

980
00:46:28,040 --> 00:46:32,030
and it's a whole full table that has

981
00:46:29,900 --> 00:46:34,370
been developed it is an extract which is

982
00:46:32,030 --> 00:46:36,350
also fed into the discussions with

983
00:46:34,370 --> 00:46:42,380
monitoring and if meta monitoring and

984
00:46:36,350 --> 00:46:44,870
evaluation and learning unit that is

985
00:46:42,380 --> 00:46:46,460
also working across with the CGI art so

986
00:46:44,870 --> 00:46:48,380
what conclude it's not that this is just

987
00:46:46,460 --> 00:46:50,690
a selection so it may be a bit

988
00:46:48,380 --> 00:46:52,580
misleading by putting the exact I think

989
00:46:50,690 --> 00:46:55,460
this is an example of a specific

990
00:46:52,580 --> 00:46:57,800
specific project where it is important

991
00:46:55,460 --> 00:47:00,440
to highlight is indeed not all projects

992
00:46:57,800 --> 00:47:02,630
are measuring all the indicators maybe

993
00:47:00,440 --> 00:47:04,430
the next step of discussion is what are

994
00:47:02,630 --> 00:47:06,970
the minimal indicators that we agree

995
00:47:04,430 --> 00:47:09,350
across regions that you should measure

996
00:47:06,970 --> 00:47:10,730
being part of those discussions it

997
00:47:09,350 --> 00:47:12,680
becomes very interesting because usually

998
00:47:10,730 --> 00:47:15,020
we step out of the meeting saying every

999
00:47:12,680 --> 00:47:16,700
time should be the minimum indicators

1000
00:47:15,020 --> 00:47:18,470
you should measure because depending the

1001
00:47:16,700 --> 00:47:20,420
socio economics is that this is this

1002
00:47:18,470 --> 00:47:21,980
etcetera on the other hand there is

1003
00:47:20,420 --> 00:47:24,680
obviously also the dimension of the

1004
00:47:21,980 --> 00:47:26,150
donors so I mean USAID is looking at

1005
00:47:24,680 --> 00:47:29,360
indicators a lot of us looking at

1006
00:47:26,150 --> 00:47:31,730
indicators who is doing everything from

1007
00:47:29,360 --> 00:47:33,620
Mexico so I'm not sure I mean I don't

1008
00:47:31,730 --> 00:47:36,970
have the answer where that ends up in

1009
00:47:33,620 --> 00:47:36,970
the end but somewhere

1010
00:47:41,800 --> 00:47:46,270
a lot of methodological challenges also

1011
00:47:44,470 --> 00:47:49,480
to have indicators that are robust

1012
00:47:46,270 --> 00:47:51,580
across geographies one aspects of

1013
00:47:49,480 --> 00:47:55,180
indicators especially for that type of

1014
00:47:51,580 --> 00:47:58,420
work are social indicators equity equity

1015
00:47:55,180 --> 00:48:00,910
insistence with responsible sourcing for

1016
00:47:58,420 --> 00:48:04,300
example it's a very interesting question

1017
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:06,570
so it's cement but not on instrument we

1018
00:48:04,300 --> 00:48:09,700
are quite a few be interested in getting

1019
00:48:06,570 --> 00:48:11,860
methods and metrics for those indicators

1020
00:48:09,700 --> 00:48:15,460
and I think it's quite a bit more

1021
00:48:11,860 --> 00:48:17,410
investment yeah I mean I totally agree

1022
00:48:15,460 --> 00:48:20,920
I've been discussing with with brandies

1023
00:48:17,410 --> 00:48:24,400
for for some time already and the idea

1024
00:48:20,920 --> 00:48:26,920
is that we find you first what are valid

1025
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:28,600
methodologies and useful indicators for

1026
00:48:26,920 --> 00:48:30,640
both the beneficiaries that we are

1027
00:48:28,600 --> 00:48:33,010
working with and for what the industry

1028
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,990
may demand and then how do we streamline

1029
00:48:33,010 --> 00:48:37,150
those indicators within the project

1030
00:48:34,990 --> 00:48:38,950
portfolio of the program and beyond of

1031
00:48:37,150 --> 00:48:40,510
all the different regions I think it's

1032
00:48:38,950 --> 00:48:42,400
interesting to look I am drea who's

1033
00:48:40,510 --> 00:48:44,200
who's on maternity leave has been

1034
00:48:42,400 --> 00:48:46,120
working on that and may be interesting

1035
00:48:44,200 --> 00:48:48,010
to ask her to give a presentation but

1036
00:48:46,120 --> 00:48:49,840
also for me just to add it has been

1037
00:48:48,010 --> 00:48:52,810
quite interesting that on methodology

1038
00:48:49,840 --> 00:48:55,860
that cetera is completely different if

1039
00:48:52,810 --> 00:48:58,480
you from from the business perspective

1040
00:48:55,860 --> 00:49:00,700
because they want those data streams to

1041
00:48:58,480 --> 00:49:01,350
go in business continuity which needs to

1042
00:49:00,700 --> 00:49:04,300
be

1043
00:49:01,350 --> 00:49:05,980
auditable by PwC's and those companies

1044
00:49:04,300 --> 00:49:08,560
that they need to be trans able to

1045
00:49:05,980 --> 00:49:10,360
translate that into financial indicators

1046
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:12,040
for them because then their insurance

1047
00:49:10,360 --> 00:49:15,160
goes that I mean that's a whole even a

1048
00:49:12,040 --> 00:49:17,110
whole different dimension where that we

1049
00:49:15,160 --> 00:49:18,850
may not be thinking of but if we don't

1050
00:49:17,110 --> 00:49:21,100
do that we cannot connect it and then

1051
00:49:18,850 --> 00:49:22,930
the pool goes away of what is driving

1052
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:26,200
this because in the end the company is

1053
00:49:22,930 --> 00:49:27,610
creating a pool for that so it's even

1054
00:49:26,200 --> 00:49:29,980
more it's making it just a little bit

1055
00:49:27,610 --> 00:49:32,290
more and another factor that is

1056
00:49:29,980 --> 00:49:34,270
important is that time it is the time

1057
00:49:32,290 --> 00:49:36,400
that it requires to capture the

1058
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:38,290
indicators analyze and kind of present

1059
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:40,810
them so the industry is pressing has to

1060
00:49:38,290 --> 00:49:43,120
have quicker response ratio than we had

1061
00:49:40,810 --> 00:49:45,430
previously with institutional donors

1062
00:49:43,120 --> 00:49:48,010
which would be okay with us releasing

1063
00:49:45,430 --> 00:49:49,690
data of 2 years old and saying ok this

1064
00:49:48,010 --> 00:49:52,510
is the indicator of production of the

1065
00:49:49,690 --> 00:49:55,280
state of Oaxaca 2014 that you are

1066
00:49:52,510 --> 00:49:56,810
delivering that in 16 so

1067
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:59,510
now the companies are telling us okay I

1068
00:49:56,810 --> 00:50:01,700
want some system where I can see if not

1069
00:49:59,510 --> 00:50:04,880
in real time at least with a delay of

1070
00:50:01,700 --> 00:50:07,040
maximum amonth who are our beneficiaries

1071
00:50:04,880 --> 00:50:09,260
how are they performing in the field and

1072
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:12,560
so is something that we are actually

1073
00:50:09,260 --> 00:50:14,270
trying to tackle with with with the BEM

1074
00:50:12,560 --> 00:50:18,940
Bittaker electronic and some other tools

1075
00:50:14,270 --> 00:50:18,940
that Andrea and others are working on

1076
00:50:25,810 --> 00:50:31,280
and again I mean you mentioned the

1077
00:50:28,190 --> 00:50:32,540
cost-benefit of indicators you know I

1078
00:50:31,280 --> 00:50:34,670
mean you can have indicators that

1079
00:50:32,540 --> 00:50:37,580
interest many people but they are very

1080
00:50:34,670 --> 00:50:40,910
difficult and very costly to to update

1081
00:50:37,580 --> 00:50:42,470
the upscaling of indicators as well you

1082
00:50:40,910 --> 00:50:44,840
know can measure things at the field

1083
00:50:42,470 --> 00:50:47,590
level for few farmers but are you scale

1084
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:50,210
that you know when you start working and

1085
00:50:47,590 --> 00:50:52,220
and environment and I think all those

1086
00:50:50,210 --> 00:50:54,830
issues of interest I think foresee bit

1087
00:50:52,220 --> 00:50:57,710
because more and more also donors are

1088
00:50:54,830 --> 00:50:58,760
asking for those indicators as a metric

1089
00:50:57,710 --> 00:51:01,100
of success

1090
00:50:58,760 --> 00:51:03,940
well greenhouse gas emissions is the

1091
00:51:01,100 --> 00:51:06,530
typical case where I think we should

1092
00:51:03,940 --> 00:51:08,390
kind of work closely with c-cups and

1093
00:51:06,530 --> 00:51:12,950
others to understand what is going to be

1094
00:51:08,390 --> 00:51:16,150
our methodology a question because I

1095
00:51:12,950 --> 00:51:16,150
think that was an interesting comment

1096
00:51:21,220 --> 00:51:29,120
how do we how do we avoid or at least

1097
00:51:26,590 --> 00:51:31,280
the signals there that by the

1098
00:51:29,120 --> 00:51:33,950
interventions instead that we are making

1099
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:37,430
sure that we enter at a level playing

1100
00:51:33,950 --> 00:51:39,890
field because one of the element is you

1101
00:51:37,430 --> 00:51:41,720
could say I take the farmers and I put

1102
00:51:39,890 --> 00:51:42,860
them in contact with the company but

1103
00:51:41,720 --> 00:51:44,840
that is not a level playing field

1104
00:51:42,860 --> 00:51:48,170
because the companies for really much

1105
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:50,450
way more experienced with negotiating to

1106
00:51:48,170 --> 00:51:52,070
farmers which for them are are our

1107
00:51:50,450 --> 00:51:55,550
suppliers and that's what they do they

1108
00:51:52,070 --> 00:51:57,440
negotiate their supply chain so can you

1109
00:51:55,550 --> 00:51:59,720
comment some of the tools and elements

1110
00:51:57,440 --> 00:52:01,580
that are being thought of to avoid

1111
00:51:59,720 --> 00:52:05,080
falling in that trap and actually

1112
00:52:01,580 --> 00:52:10,360
creating disparity rather than

1113
00:52:05,080 --> 00:52:13,000
opportunities and a pool for so one

1114
00:52:10,360 --> 00:52:15,580
thing that we need to clarify every time

1115
00:52:13,000 --> 00:52:19,210
is that we are not traders so that we

1116
00:52:15,580 --> 00:52:21,850
cannot make sure that by linking farmers

1117
00:52:19,210 --> 00:52:26,080
to companies we our business is going to

1118
00:52:21,850 --> 00:52:29,860
happen by itself so what we what we see

1119
00:52:26,080 --> 00:52:32,800
is that we want to on one hand empower

1120
00:52:29,860 --> 00:52:35,080
farmers to understand what is the value

1121
00:52:32,800 --> 00:52:38,140
of the product they have what are the

1122
00:52:35,080 --> 00:52:40,600
different markets they can go to and got

1123
00:52:38,140 --> 00:52:44,200
are the benefits of working together or

1124
00:52:40,600 --> 00:52:48,820
by developing a formal contract farming

1125
00:52:44,200 --> 00:52:50,530
or by developing kind of loyalty to the

1126
00:52:48,820 --> 00:52:52,210
to the potential companies that are

1127
00:52:50,530 --> 00:52:55,510
interested in their products so that's

1128
00:52:52,210 --> 00:52:58,360
that's a whole set of work and from the

1129
00:52:55,510 --> 00:53:01,740
other side we work with the companies to

1130
00:52:58,360 --> 00:53:05,080
kind of transmit they need to understand

1131
00:53:01,740 --> 00:53:06,820
the characteristics of the farmers of

1132
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:09,400
the specific region where they want to

1133
00:53:06,820 --> 00:53:11,560
source from they of course know the

1134
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:15,550
people but they don't they might not

1135
00:53:11,560 --> 00:53:20,100
know how they would react to changes in

1136
00:53:15,550 --> 00:53:23,940
the environment such as changing price

1137
00:53:20,100 --> 00:53:28,570
scenario or changing weather scenario so

1138
00:53:23,940 --> 00:53:31,030
this kind of of of awareness is

1139
00:53:28,570 --> 00:53:33,580
important for the companies to have and

1140
00:53:31,030 --> 00:53:38,200
also we have the companies to understand

1141
00:53:33,580 --> 00:53:41,920
what are the benefits of promoting local

1142
00:53:38,200 --> 00:53:44,500
procurement instead of imports in terms

1143
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,760
of marketing of image for for the

1144
00:53:44,500 --> 00:53:48,400
companies and that they are seeing value

1145
00:53:45,760 --> 00:53:52,410
in that so they are kind of open now to

1146
00:53:48,400 --> 00:53:52,410
consider buying local

1147
00:53:56,990 --> 00:54:05,070
Turing who sure that we know that Mexico

1148
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:08,160
is divided into mono cropping Jones no

1149
00:54:05,070 --> 00:54:14,100
we have the areas about the area and so

1150
00:54:08,160 --> 00:54:16,350
on so we want to as a part of

1151
00:54:14,100 --> 00:54:20,090
sustainable intensification we want

1152
00:54:16,350 --> 00:54:22,890
diversification as one of the component

1153
00:54:20,090 --> 00:54:26,910
on the other side the contract farming

1154
00:54:22,890 --> 00:54:29,480
is more towards specific quality trade

1155
00:54:26,910 --> 00:54:33,420
commodity and mono cropping suits

1156
00:54:29,480 --> 00:54:39,080
contract farming and vice versa how you

1157
00:54:33,420 --> 00:54:39,080
see diversification and market linkage

1158
00:54:40,250 --> 00:54:46,800
contract farming should we use only if

1159
00:54:43,740 --> 00:54:48,720
useful so that means that not all the

1160
00:54:46,800 --> 00:54:51,470
companies and not all farmer groups are

1161
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:54,560
seeing value in contract farming because

1162
00:54:51,470 --> 00:54:56,520
contract farming is limited by

1163
00:54:54,560 --> 00:55:00,150
stipulated programs

1164
00:54:56,520 --> 00:55:01,950
so in that case Mexican xalapa has a

1165
00:55:00,150 --> 00:55:03,900
circa and a circa has a service of

1166
00:55:01,950 --> 00:55:06,150
contract agriculture which proved to be

1167
00:55:03,900 --> 00:55:09,450
useful and unpopular in some regions and

1168
00:55:06,150 --> 00:55:11,010
not in others so to start with this with

1169
00:55:09,450 --> 00:55:15,500
this thing for us contract farming is

1170
00:55:11,010 --> 00:55:18,150
not an obligation then in terms of what

1171
00:55:15,500 --> 00:55:22,250
products we do we suggest in crop

1172
00:55:18,150 --> 00:55:25,980
rotation we also we always start from

1173
00:55:22,250 --> 00:55:27,840
understanding economics so whenever we

1174
00:55:25,980 --> 00:55:31,110
see that there are several options in

1175
00:55:27,840 --> 00:55:34,260
terms of agronomy appropriate rotation

1176
00:55:31,110 --> 00:55:36,360
we see out of those who is the one what

1177
00:55:34,260 --> 00:55:38,400
is the one that makes more sense from a

1178
00:55:36,360 --> 00:55:41,070
market perspective but not the other way

1179
00:55:38,400 --> 00:55:43,730
around we don't see we don't say ok in

1180
00:55:41,070 --> 00:55:46,590
Bahia there is a new factory of oil of

1181
00:55:43,730 --> 00:55:48,780
papas fritas and then we need to to get

1182
00:55:46,590 --> 00:55:51,570
oil from this kind of legume enosis so

1183
00:55:48,780 --> 00:55:54,840
we just understand in the system which

1184
00:55:51,570 --> 00:55:58,560
is needed which is kind of helping to

1185
00:55:54,840 --> 00:56:01,640
nurture soils and then out of that we we

1186
00:55:58,560 --> 00:56:01,640
provide some recommendation

1187
00:56:03,070 --> 00:56:07,870
I have a question especially you are

1188
00:56:05,800 --> 00:56:10,420
talking a lot about market and

1189
00:56:07,870 --> 00:56:11,020
specifically about big markets and slay

1190
00:56:10,420 --> 00:56:13,990
people

1191
00:56:11,020 --> 00:56:15,610
what about small-scale farmers if we see

1192
00:56:13,990 --> 00:56:18,370
them yes of course

1193
00:56:15,610 --> 00:56:22,150
also as producers and as consumers of

1194
00:56:18,370 --> 00:56:25,740
their own cereals as maize and then if

1195
00:56:22,150 --> 00:56:30,490
we try to connect them with you say

1196
00:56:25,740 --> 00:56:33,270
chefs or these high like level

1197
00:56:30,490 --> 00:56:35,710
restaurants how do we ensure that we

1198
00:56:33,270 --> 00:56:39,220
that they can still have their own

1199
00:56:35,710 --> 00:56:41,020
volume for self consumption and they if

1200
00:56:39,220 --> 00:56:43,510
did we give them a nice price and all

1201
00:56:41,020 --> 00:56:45,220
these contracts yeah of course it's

1202
00:56:43,510 --> 00:56:47,590
gonna be a really nice incentive to sell

1203
00:56:45,220 --> 00:56:49,480
everything on most of it and then what

1204
00:56:47,590 --> 00:56:53,110
are they gonna eat if they prefer to eat

1205
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:57,790
their own mace perhaps we are going to

1206
00:56:53,110 --> 00:56:59,530
make a different type of impact yeah

1207
00:56:57,790 --> 00:57:01,390
well I think that was that was pointed

1208
00:56:59,530 --> 00:57:04,450
out by I mean we do that by carefully

1209
00:57:01,390 --> 00:57:07,090
assessing case by case first we cannot

1210
00:57:04,450 --> 00:57:09,250
say that large farmers supply only large

1211
00:57:07,090 --> 00:57:11,590
companies so that is the large companies

1212
00:57:09,250 --> 00:57:13,450
also supply from small and medium

1213
00:57:11,590 --> 00:57:14,950
farmers that get organized that's what

1214
00:57:13,450 --> 00:57:17,830
we are doing in Bahia that's where we

1215
00:57:14,950 --> 00:57:19,900
are doing in in some in Sinaloa not so

1216
00:57:17,830 --> 00:57:23,290
much but in estado de mexico yes we're

1217
00:57:19,900 --> 00:57:26,650
doing that for those niche market pool

1218
00:57:23,290 --> 00:57:28,930
for that niche market pool that they

1219
00:57:26,650 --> 00:57:32,140
want maybe some very specific products

1220
00:57:28,930 --> 00:57:34,510
land resumes we have been doing this

1221
00:57:32,140 --> 00:57:36,820
exercise community by community in

1222
00:57:34,510 --> 00:57:38,320
Venezuela Yucatan to understand what is

1223
00:57:36,820 --> 00:57:39,910
the percentage of product that they

1224
00:57:38,320 --> 00:57:42,610
consume what is the percentage of

1225
00:57:39,910 --> 00:57:45,160
product that they trade in their

1226
00:57:42,610 --> 00:57:46,720
communities so we don't affect that we

1227
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:49,540
help them to increase their production

1228
00:57:46,720 --> 00:57:54,160
and with that surplus of production we

1229
00:57:49,540 --> 00:57:56,620
start talking about selling that so the

1230
00:57:54,160 --> 00:57:59,110
volumes are incredibly low for the first

1231
00:57:56,620 --> 00:58:01,840
year then we want to help them to make

1232
00:57:59,110 --> 00:58:05,320
to see okay maybe they have three actors

1233
00:58:01,840 --> 00:58:06,970
of land in average they are planting

1234
00:58:05,320 --> 00:58:08,920
less than an actor because it's what

1235
00:58:06,970 --> 00:58:11,110
they need but maybe next year they will

1236
00:58:08,920 --> 00:58:14,080
think okay I'm gonna duplicate my

1237
00:58:11,110 --> 00:58:16,510
production because I know I will have

1238
00:58:14,080 --> 00:58:20,140
who someone who's going to buy from from

1239
00:58:16,510 --> 00:58:22,840
me so volume setting and price setting

1240
00:58:20,140 --> 00:58:24,910
is key and it's something that we work

1241
00:58:22,840 --> 00:58:27,490
on in every specific community this is

1242
00:58:24,910 --> 00:58:30,700
very time demanding so what we would

1243
00:58:27,490 --> 00:58:32,560
want to do is that we have the private

1244
00:58:30,700 --> 00:58:35,020
sector I mean small companies farm

1245
00:58:32,560 --> 00:58:38,940
advisors dispatcher salary colas that

1246
00:58:35,020 --> 00:58:38,940
provide a service to farmers

1247
00:58:57,450 --> 00:59:06,639
okay thank you very much shake

1248
00:59:00,250 --> 00:59:06,639
[Applause]
