  "text": "hey guys that's the Baker with Cross Timbers bison you know one of the questions I always get besides what's the difference between bison and Buffalo is do you have to have a permit to raise bison what does it take to raise bison [Music] so guys what I want to talk to you about today is how to start a bison herd there's no perfect way of doing this I'll just tell you my experience and what I did I had a background in bison and obviously loved this animal and that experience back when I worked at the National Park Service kind of led me into you know the influence of getting bison and so that first of all was the encouragement of others and there's the influence of a background history with these animals I wanted to be able to raise them so I had that inspiration there and an encouragement of the family members and my and my wife to do something like this and so that was a support system that I got that really helps a bunch but there's several different things that I want to talk to you about today that will help you get started to be honest with you there's no special permit there's no special license or anything to raise bison these are not exotic animals you know you're not you're not raising animals that are from a zoo I know there's bison in some zoos but this is not an exotic animal this is a natural species that occurs here and basically you just treat them it's it's kind of like cattle if you want to start raising cattle for whatever reason you want to start raising cattle for you can do it you don't have to have any special permit to raise bison you don't have to set a special license or anything like that you if you want to do it you can as long as you have really good facilities obviously to contain the Bison good fencing and you kind of have a background in it it would it would definitely help but to be honest with you if you've had experience raising cattle then then you're not far off of raising bison there are a couple different things you know behavior differences and and different handling systems and and behaviors and more stress there there is a difference between raising cattle and raising bison but if you do want to raise bison it's not that difficult to start you just need to get in contact with somebody that raises bison maybe somebody in your local area and that's where it starts from there if you've had if you have somebody local or somebody in your state that you can contact and start from there that that's probably the easiest way to do it and they'll kind of point you in the right direction I'll do whatever I can to help I would love to help you know I'm here in Oklahoma and I can answer any questions that you have for me that's not a problem you know I just I got mine I got in contact with a guy and I was just really lucky because this guy happen to be a big-time bison guy and he's thirty minutes down the road from our farm and so I was just really lucky and I got a hold of DOC Parsons and and he pointed me in the right direction but I had experience raising bison I say raising them taking care of him handling him with my experience in the National Park Service when I was in college so I had some experience there and I wasn't really scared to raise them or be in the pen with them at all I was a little nervous when you buy your own herd but it's a little bit different but you can do it you can definitely raise your own bison okay those are not bison but those back here bison I don't know what's going on here but anyways yeah you're you can you're more than welcome to get in contact with me if you would like to raise a bison if you if you have some experience of raising cattle or or bison and your own general and you want to expand go for it I encourage you to do so they're amazing animals and they're fun to watch they're just absolutely fun to watch they're hanging out down here in our bottom pasture and just enjoying life another resource that you can reach out to is the national bison Association it has a great association when I go to the conference's the Bison conferences there's a summer conference and then there's a winter conference the winter conference is in Denver my wife and I attended the last year had a great time but you can even get on the website and you can get contact information there and that will be very helpful if you're interested in raising bison that's actually a good start and you can branch off from there and figure out you know maybe who's in your area maybe there's somebody local that raises bison maybe you've driven down the road and seen a bison herd and you know if you can figure out who owns those bison maybe that's a good start somebody within your state that raises bison but you can always go to the national bison so see Asian look online I believe it's WWE bison central.com and you can go on that website and get a lot of good information and there's a lot of good contact information on there as well [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] [Music] new this tree was good for something hi Eleanor feel good you got in your hair hey guys I hope I helped you out today I hope that I've encouraged you with some of my videos to raise bison it's not for everyone I hope that you guys understand that these animals are very different than cattle they're different than any sort of livestock that if you've ever raised livestock before they're a very unique animal they're a special animal and they have character they are very very social animals which that's so interesting about them which that's one of the things that just will attract you to them it's just how social they are they have this this this family and you know they you can see how they interact with each other and and even me as well in my family one more out here but take your time and see if this is the right thing for you go visit a bison farm go and see how they operate you can go to a large scale bison farm or you can go to a small scale bison farm obviously mine is smaller I started out small and that's funny I think this is easier to start out this way and by the way Ted Turner started out with a very small bison herd as well and he's the largest bison producer and in the world so it's ok to start out small but use your resources dig into and get as much information as you can go visit a farm that's the best thing to do see how it all are operates see how they do things and and make a decision from there and you know have a have a good background of of raising animals that would be a good start and you have to have good property with that provides grass and obviously good fencing which I'm going to talk to you about an upcoming video hey guys I hope you enjoyed the video today I hope I've encouraged you to raise some bison and I hope I've released drawed some interest to you to do that if you guys have any questions anything you guys can contact me you can go to my website Cross Timbers bison comm you can check us out on Facebook and Instagram and if you already haven't followed us along and check out our small herd here in southern Oklahoma thank you guys so much",
