[Music]

2
00:00:01,240 --> 00:00:06,279
hey it's Matt from McGee farms and got a

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:08,920
couple Amazon packages in this week and

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:10,360
was going to open them up kind of uh

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:12,480
show them off a little bit and then as

6
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:14,880
we get them set up kind of show you how

7
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:14,880
they work

8
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:20,880
out uh ordered these the other day you

9
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:22,480
know we've got our new pfal pin that

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:24,760
we're setting up and also we got our

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,760
chicken house and I was looking in to

12
00:00:24,760 --> 00:00:30,160
try to get some kind of a solar lighting

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:32,520
set up and uh I'd seen these a buddy of

14
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:37,320
mine actually got these and I'll put a

15
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:40,600
link to them uh on the on the notes for

16
00:00:37,320 --> 00:00:43,760
the description for the for this video

17
00:00:40,600 --> 00:00:45,239
but uh they're small solar lights

18
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,719
they've got a little thing to hang a

19
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,920
buddy of mine uses these in his tent

20
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,760
sometimes and he's had real good luck

21
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:56,000
with them they're cheap so I figure well

22
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,160
why not try them out so opening them up

23
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,160
looking

24
00:00:57,160 --> 00:01:00,960
through like I said the lights look

25
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,799
pretty uh

26
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,400
pretty nice kind of impressed with

27
00:01:03,799 --> 00:01:10,520
them the only thing I'm not overly crazy

28
00:01:07,400 --> 00:01:13,880
about is the solar panel doesn't really

29
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,720
have a way to mount it it looks like uh

30
00:01:13,880 --> 00:01:18,759
I don't know if this is like a sticky

31
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:21,600
thing where you just kind of peel and

32
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:24,640
stick I don't know how well you know

33
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:27,720
that's really going to hold up over time

34
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,640
but again these were super cheap so you

35
00:01:27,720 --> 00:01:32,680
know if if they don't work out I'm not

36
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,520
out that much money but you just have a

37
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:39,000
small solar

38
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:42,479
panel hook up with a uh uh looks like a

39
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:45,000
c connector maybe uh like a phone C

40
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:48,240
connector and it came as a two pack so I

41
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:52,159
ended up with with two of

42
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,759
them two of these

43
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:57,479
and two little remote controls I don't

44
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,320
know how uh how much I'm going to be

45
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,200
using the remote controls I've got some

46
00:01:59,320 --> 00:02:04,119
other solar lights at the house with the

47
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,439
remote control and I don't think I've

48
00:02:04,119 --> 00:02:09,720
ever put batteries in

49
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:13,200
it but I don't know maybe this might be

50
00:02:09,720 --> 00:02:14,720
nice for uh you know setting them up and

51
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,560
if I want to turn them on or off from

52
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:20,080
the house it does have a setting on here

53
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,840
though for where it'll be super bright

54
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:25,319
for 30 minutes not quite so bright for 2

55
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:29,239
hours all the way out to like an 8 hour

56
00:02:25,319 --> 00:02:30,879
setting and my thinking is uh twofold

57
00:02:29,239 --> 00:02:33,080
one

58
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:35,800
as far as uh leaving some lights on

59
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:37,680
it'll maybe help them uh you know if we

60
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:40,440
have Predator problems I'm working on

61
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:43,280
the Predator problems right now uh and

62
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:45,280
hopefully uh by the time they become a

63
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:49,280
problem next spring they won't be a

64
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:51,959
problem but also as we get

65
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:56,680
into where they're not laying as many

66
00:02:51,959 --> 00:02:58,360
eggs because of the uh the less daylight

67
00:02:56,680 --> 00:03:00,840
you know this might be a way if uh we're

68
00:02:58,360 --> 00:03:02,840
wanting more eggs we can do that so I'm

69
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:06,000
going to get these set up today and I

70
00:03:02,840 --> 00:03:08,480
will uh make a video once we get them in

71
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,680
there and kind of show you how they're

72
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:13,959
working and then after I'm sure it's

73
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,480
going to take all day to charge them but

74
00:03:13,959 --> 00:03:16,920
if they're working at night we'll go out

75
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:19,319
and take a look at how they're working

76
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,360
