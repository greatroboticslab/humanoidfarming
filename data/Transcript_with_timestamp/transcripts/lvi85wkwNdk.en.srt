1
00:00:04,069 --> 00:00:07,859
are several types of small fruit and

2
00:00:06,569 --> 00:00:09,960
berries that are produced in pop culture

3
00:00:07,859 --> 00:00:11,730
in greenhouse an outdoor production

4
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:14,120
those crops include things such as

5
00:00:11,730 --> 00:00:15,809
strawberries raspberries blueberries

6
00:00:14,120 --> 00:00:17,490
crops like that

7
00:00:15,809 --> 00:00:20,160
the ideal growing media for all the

8
00:00:17,490 --> 00:00:22,199
various types of small fruit will depend

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:23,880
on basically the grower preference the

10
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:26,130
container size and the cultural

11
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:28,230
practices that they experience so

12
00:00:26,130 --> 00:00:29,820
there's and the nice thing is with our

13
00:00:28,230 --> 00:00:32,040
Pro mix product line we offer products

14
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,050
that can cater to these different needs

15
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:36,090
as I mentioned there are several mixes

16
00:00:34,050 --> 00:00:37,800
that can apply to the specific needs of

17
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:39,899
a customer it depends on what your

18
00:00:37,800 --> 00:00:41,879
specific needs are for instance if

19
00:00:39,899 --> 00:00:44,250
you're looking to use a mix that you can

20
00:00:41,879 --> 00:00:46,289
app inside the greenhouse for smaller

21
00:00:44,250 --> 00:00:48,210
containers maybe gallon size or smaller

22
00:00:46,289 --> 00:00:50,700
product that would probably work out for

23
00:00:48,210 --> 00:00:52,770
you either the pro xvx mycorrhizae

24
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:55,920
which is combination of peat perlite and

25
00:00:52,770 --> 00:00:58,620
vermiculite or the pro makes LP 15 which

26
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,719
is combination of peat and perlite both

27
00:00:58,620 --> 00:01:03,090
products have high water high of high

28
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,949
water holding capacity so they don't dry

29
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,810
out very rapidly so they're great to use

30
00:01:04,949 --> 00:01:08,880
during the summer months but they still

31
00:01:06,810 --> 00:01:10,950
have good aeration they're lightweight

32
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:14,220
so they're easy to handle and for trent

33
00:01:10,950 --> 00:01:16,200
and easy to transport now for still for

34
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:18,509
indoor production in small containers up

35
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:20,580
to much larger containers and especially

36
00:01:18,509 --> 00:01:23,189
outdoor production we would recommend

37
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:25,170
some of our bark base growing media we

38
00:01:23,189 --> 00:01:28,860
have two Canadian products the pro mates

39
00:01:25,170 --> 00:01:30,780
BRK and PRK 20 as well as two products

40
00:01:28,860 --> 00:01:34,530
from our plant in Matawan in Virginia

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:38,040
which would be our pro mix BK 25 in BK

42
00:01:34,530 --> 00:01:40,740
55 all these products are peaked bark

43
00:01:38,040 --> 00:01:42,329
based with perlite added and the idea of

44
00:01:40,740 --> 00:01:44,430
having the bark in there is it gives a

45
00:01:42,329 --> 00:01:46,259
little bit extra drainage so it's ideal

46
00:01:44,430 --> 00:01:48,360
for transitioning not only for

47
00:01:46,259 --> 00:01:50,939
greenhouse crop production but also for

48
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:52,619
the outdoor production of fruits and the

49
00:01:50,939 --> 00:01:53,880
extra weight from the bark will also

50
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:56,399
prevent the pots from tipping over

51
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:58,229
especially in the wind so between the

52
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:00,540
bark and the perlite providing extra

53
00:01:58,229 --> 00:02:02,340
drainage they're actually good mixes to

54
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:05,159
use even for the winter months as well

55
00:02:02,340 --> 00:02:06,930
now bark mixes in general do tend to

56
00:02:05,159 --> 00:02:08,610
draw a little bit faster than the bx and

57
00:02:06,930 --> 00:02:09,110
even a little bit faster in the HP did I

58
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:11,230
mention

59
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:14,330
for so little so this will help minimize

60
00:02:11,230 --> 00:02:16,220
any issues with diseases bark also is a

61
00:02:14,330 --> 00:02:18,020
great material used for long-term crop

62
00:02:16,220 --> 00:02:20,680
production another reason why it's good

63
00:02:18,020 --> 00:02:23,030
for pots are larger than gallon size

64
00:02:20,680 --> 00:02:26,210
because the bark itself doesn't shrink

65
00:02:23,030 --> 00:02:27,410
in the pot or decomposes quickly another

66
00:02:26,210 --> 00:02:29,540
option if you're looking for a

67
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,320
greenhouse mix or even an outdoor mix

68
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:35,930
that has very high water retention we

69
00:02:32,320 --> 00:02:38,290
recommend our promix HP CC this is a

70
00:02:35,930 --> 00:02:41,450
combination of peat chunk coir and

71
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:43,400
perlite and the chunk coir itself likes

72
00:02:41,450 --> 00:02:45,080
to retain a lot of water and give it

73
00:02:43,400 --> 00:02:47,420
back to the growing media as a crop is

74
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:48,680
growing so you don't need to water the

75
00:02:47,420 --> 00:02:50,959
product as often so it's ideal

76
00:02:48,680 --> 00:02:52,760
especially for summer growing in larger

77
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,130
containers especially indoors or

78
00:02:52,760 --> 00:02:57,800
outdoors for organic production of small

79
00:02:55,130 --> 00:03:02,120
fruit we recommend the pro mix MP MP is

80
00:02:57,800 --> 00:03:04,220
a combination of peat core and perlite

81
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,290
it's ideal for year-round production of

82
00:03:04,220 --> 00:03:08,510
small fruit and gallon sized containers

83
00:03:06,290 --> 00:03:10,459
are smaller it does have a higher water

84
00:03:08,510 --> 00:03:13,459
attention very similar to our B X and L

85
00:03:10,459 --> 00:03:14,840
P 15 so there's less so it doesn't need

86
00:03:13,459 --> 00:03:16,760
to be water quite as frequently

87
00:03:14,840 --> 00:03:18,800
there is no compost added to this

88
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:21,380
product so you don't get that plugging

89
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:23,150
up the pores which kind of limits oxygen

90
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:25,220
to the root system so you get an active

91
00:03:23,150 --> 00:03:30,130
growing root system which helps produce

92
00:03:25,220 --> 00:03:30,130
faster growth and a faster crop time

93
00:03:31,640 --> 00:03:36,209
now however what does make pro-mix

94
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,670
unique is not so much the different

95
00:03:36,209 --> 00:03:40,170
types of mixes but the but the active

96
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:42,110
ingredients that we can add to it

97
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:44,280
the active ingredients are essentially

98
00:03:42,110 --> 00:03:45,599
natural organisms that have been

99
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:47,940
extracted from the soil they're not

100
00:03:45,599 --> 00:03:50,819
genetically modified so the first one we

101
00:03:47,940 --> 00:03:52,739
offer is our mycorrhizae mycorrhizae is

102
00:03:50,819 --> 00:03:55,319
a vesicular Arbus killer endo

103
00:03:52,739 --> 00:03:58,709
mycorrhizal fungi called Glomus enter a

104
00:03:55,319 --> 00:04:00,840
disease it will colonize small the roots

105
00:03:58,709 --> 00:04:03,780
of small fruits of all plants except for

106
00:04:00,840 --> 00:04:05,220
blueberries now in that case the micro

107
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:06,720
Zee doesn't cause any problems for the

108
00:04:05,220 --> 00:04:08,970
blueberries the blueberries just simply

109
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:11,099
don't utilize it but for all the other

110
00:04:08,970 --> 00:04:13,290
plants you're gonna get increased uptake

111
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:14,940
of nutrients because essentially once

112
00:04:13,290 --> 00:04:18,120
the mycorrhizae colonizes the root

113
00:04:14,940 --> 00:04:19,919
system it grows out past the root system

114
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:21,269
where roots are not present to bring in

115
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:24,510
water and nutrients where the roots are

116
00:04:21,269 --> 00:04:26,490
not available therefore it more

117
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:29,610
efficiently mines out the growing media

118
00:04:26,490 --> 00:04:31,320
for nutrients and for water so think of

119
00:04:29,610 --> 00:04:33,630
mycorrhizae is kind of an extension of

120
00:04:31,320 --> 00:04:36,539
the root system so what how does that

121
00:04:33,630 --> 00:04:38,310
benefit you well first of all because it

122
00:04:36,539 --> 00:04:40,410
can acquire the nutrients of water more

123
00:04:38,310 --> 00:04:42,960
efficiently it delays the onset of

124
00:04:40,410 --> 00:04:45,840
nutrient deficiency symptoms as well as

125
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:47,940
it delays the onset of wilting it also

126
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:50,820
increases resistance from environmental

127
00:04:47,940 --> 00:04:52,800
stresses in addition to that and as a

128
00:04:50,820 --> 00:04:54,570
result when you're transitioning maybe

129
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:56,880
from a smaller container size to a

130
00:04:54,570 --> 00:05:00,000
larger size you don't see the transplant

131
00:04:56,880 --> 00:05:01,979
shock delay that normally occurs and on

132
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:04,590
top of it you also get faster plant

133
00:05:01,979 --> 00:05:06,389
establishment you get better initial

134
00:05:04,590 --> 00:05:08,370
growth and better sustained growth

135
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,740
especially if there's stress involved

136
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:11,789
bottom line larger plants will produce

137
00:05:10,740 --> 00:05:13,770
more fruit

138
00:05:11,789 --> 00:05:15,479
the second active ingredient is our bio

139
00:05:13,770 --> 00:05:18,570
fungicide it's a bacterium called

140
00:05:15,479 --> 00:05:21,900
bacillus subsys it colonizes the root

141
00:05:18,570 --> 00:05:23,849
system of all small fruit plants and

142
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:26,520
it's present throughout the entire crop

143
00:05:23,849 --> 00:05:28,770
cycle of that plant it basically will

144
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,770
suppress root rots caused by the fungal

145
00:05:28,770 --> 00:05:35,250
pathogens Alternaria Fusarium Pythium

146
00:05:31,770 --> 00:05:37,680
and Rhizoctonia it will reduce fungicide

147
00:05:35,250 --> 00:05:39,630
drenches by up to 50% so that's great

148
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,099
news whether you have to drench him

149
00:05:39,630 --> 00:05:42,410
inside the greenhouse or if you're

150
00:05:41,099 --> 00:05:44,090
growing them outside

151
00:05:42,410 --> 00:05:45,620
in some cases that completely eliminates

152
00:05:44,090 --> 00:05:47,510
a need for the fungicide drenches

153
00:05:45,620 --> 00:05:49,370
because the root system is healthier so

154
00:05:47,510 --> 00:05:51,680
the bottom line is you save money on

155
00:05:49,370 --> 00:05:53,990
those fungicides they also helps to

156
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:55,730
reduce plant loss so obviously the lower

157
00:05:53,990 --> 00:05:57,530
your plant losses the more plants you

158
00:05:55,730 --> 00:05:59,480
have to sell and therefore you can

159
00:05:57,530 --> 00:06:02,300
increase your crop production simply

160
00:05:59,480 --> 00:06:03,860
from that fact alone and third would be

161
00:06:02,300 --> 00:06:05,960
the combination of both the bio

162
00:06:03,860 --> 00:06:07,850
fungicide and the mycorrhizae together

163
00:06:05,960 --> 00:06:11,740
so there you will get the benefits of

164
00:06:07,850 --> 00:06:11,740
both organisms in one product

165
00:06:15,529 --> 00:06:17,589
you
