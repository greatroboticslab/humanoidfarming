  "text": "[Music] garlic aliam sabam is a spice plant from the onion family widely cultivated and used around the world not only is garlic an essential ingredient in cooking but it also offers numerous health benefits its main component Allison is a sulfur containing compound with strong antibacterial and anti-inflammatory properties additionally garlic is rich in vitamin C vitamin B6 manganese and antioxidants which help boost the immune system support heart health and reduce cholesterol levels regularly incorporating garlic into your diet provides High nutritional value and a range of health [Music] benefits today let's learn how farmers produce this wonderful spice first is the step of preparing the soil to grow garlic the process of preparing the soil for growing garlic involves clearing the land of weeds loosening the soil for better aeration and ensuring proper drainage organic compost or well- rotted manure is added to enrich the soil with nutrients the pH level is adjusted to 6 to 7 for optimal growth creating an ideal environment for garlic planting and development [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] manual garlic planting is a process that requires meticulous care and skill from Farmers first the soil is cleared loosened and enriched with organic fertilizer to provide essential nutrients for the plants then garlic cloves are carefully selected typically choosing large healthy and disease-free cloves farmers use their hands to create small holes in the soil placing each clove with the sprouting end facing upward and covering it with a thin layer of soil for protection the spacing between cloves is usually maintained at 10 to 15 cm to allow for proper growth this process demands patients to ensure all cloves are planted evenly and correctly after planting the soil is gently watered to make maintain moisture creating favorable conditions for the garlic to sprout and [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] grow the mechanized planting of garlic significantly enhances efficiency and uniformity in modern agriculture this process begins with preparing the soil using Advanced Machinery such as plows and Harrows to ensure the land is air rated level and ready for planting fertilizers are often distributed using specialized equipment to enrich the soil with nutrients the garlic planting machine is then deployed capable of simultaneously digging small holes placing garlic cloves and covering them with soil these machines are designed to maintain consistent spacing between cloves typically 10 to 15 cm ensuring optimal growth conditions some Advanced models even have adjustable settings to accommodate different clove sizes and planting depths a key advantage of mechanized planting is the time saved a task that would take Days by hand can now be completed in hours covering large Fields efficiently moreover the uniform planting achieved by machines helps maximize yield by reducing competition between plants for nutrients in space after planting irrigation systems such as drip or sprinkler systems are used to provide the necessary moisture for germination this mechanized approach not only boosts productivity but also reduces labor intensive tasks making garlic cultivation more sustainable and profitable for farmers [Music] [Applause] the cultivation process for garlic care is an essential step for Healthy Growth farmers use tools or cultivators to loosen the soil around the roots allowing better aeration and nutrient absorption this process also helps remove weeds maintain consistent soil moisture and ultimately boost the crops yield [Music] harvesting garlic by hand is a traditional method used by many farmers especially in areas without access to Modern Machinery this process begins when the garlic is fully mature with the plant's leaves turning yellow and drying out farmers use a knife or scissors to cut the roots then pull each garlic bulb out of the soil care is needed to avoid bruising or damaging the bulbs once harvested the garlic is gathered into small bundles and hung up to dry during the harvesting process Farmers must frequently check the garlic to ensure it is not damaged while this method is time consuming and labor intensive hand harvesting helps maintain the Garlic's quality preventing bruising or spoilage and also supports the next planting cycle by preserving the Integrity of the soil [Laughter] [Music] [Laughter] [Music] using machinery for garlic harvesting saves Time and Labor compared to traditional methods garlic harvesting machines are designed to work over large areas operating quickly and efficiently The Machine's root cutting components slice through the soil to sever the garlic bulbs and then a conveyor or augur lifts the garlic out of the ground the machine also separates the garlic from the roots and soil minimizing losses and protecting the bulbs from damage after harvesting the garlic is sorted and packaged ensuring quality for Market distribution however using machines requires a significant initial investment and depends on factors such as soil type farming conditions and the machines precision and operation [Music] after harvesting garlic goes through the Sorting processing and packaging stages to ensure product quality first the garlic is sorted by size and quality the best bulbs which are undamaged and free from scratches are selected for sale as Fresh Products while garlic with defects is processed into dried garlic or other products like garlic powder or garlic paste after sorting the garlic is cleaned to remove remove any remaining dirt soil or impurities next the garlic is dried or subjected to a drying process if necessary finally the garlic is packaged in suitable materials such as plastic bags or cardboard boxes ensuring long-term storage and easy transportation to [Music] [Laughter] Consumers thank you for watching the video about the garlic planting and harvesting process by Farmers we hope the information shared today has given you a better understanding of this hard yet fascinating work don't forget to like And subscribe to the channel to stay updated with more useful
