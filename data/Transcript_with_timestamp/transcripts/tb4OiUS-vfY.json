  "text": "Hello everybody welcome back to our farming simul 25 tips and tricks video today we're going to talk about all things goats goats are a new animal to the Farming Simulator franchise with respect to Farming Simulator 25 but they are extremely similar to sheep so if you have played Farm Sim in the past and you have kept sheep well goats are going to fall pretty much under the same general requirements as sheep had previously to that end if you take a look at the animal menu with respect to the animal pins you're going to find that sheep and goats are going to share the same buildings so if we come in here to build mode we come down to animals and we toggle over to sheep these are going to be able to support our goats as well we have four different base game buildings we're talking about here an open sheep pasture that's going to hold 19 sheep or goats by default and it is also going to require us to deliver not only food but also water now the rest of these buildings they are going to supply water themselves we have one for $48,000 this going to hold 26 sheep or goats $51,000 and it's going to hold 26 sheep or goats just a different style of building and then the larger pin which is going to hold 68 sheep or goats something new to farming simil 25 is also the introduction of what they call dynamic pastur Dynamic pastures allows us to reconfigure the shape and capacity of our animal pins as we place them down so let's demonstrate how this works with this large sheet pin that in its base configuration is set for 68 sheep or goats we're going to place it down right here and we're going get a prompt do we want to customize the fence for our sheep Barn large yes we do and now you can see we have the build down but no fence because now we have the ability to place our fence so what we're going to do is well we're just going to build out a big rectangle why not and we're going to bring it back to our pasture you'll see that it's just going to snap into place and then it says do you want to plant Meadow grass for your sheep Barn yes sure and there we go now we have our sheep Barn down we have a very large pasture planned out and if we come over to this building we're going to see by coming to the Paul icon this is going to be where we can load or unload our animals we now have the capacity of 113 sheep or goats now this is a really neat feature and while in this demonstration I just simply made a giant rectangle you could conform this to the land and or landscaping around your farm so you can make your way around trees you can make your way around field edges roadsides whatever you want you can do this up on hillsides it's really going to add a whole lot of customization to the game the next thing we need to talk about is how do you get your animals well there's two real ways to get your animals you can either buy them directly here at the pin or you can go down to the animal dealer and buy them from there and transport them to your farm if you buy them directly from the animal pin since we are talking about goats today we're going to scroll all the way down to the bottom and we can buy goats in either one of three different ages we can buy newborn goats at an age of zero months for $200 a goat if we were to do that we would double click on this we would scroll up to a particular number that we wanted to do and you can see how much money it's going to cost us with a small delivery fee let's go ahead and buy those in now we can select 3mon age juvenile goats and they are going to be a little bit more costly at $38 a piece we can do the same thing we can click here once this is selected we can either tick up or if we wanted to fill the whole thing we could just tick down and that's going to show us the available capacity I would C though not to fill up the Sheep pen because you won't have room for them to reproduce when the time comes so let's go ahead and buy these in and then we have our oldest goats our mature goats at an age of 16 months they're going to be the most costly because they're going to start producing goat milk in large quantities right away we can buy those for $777 and again we're going to buy just 10 now let's talk about our goats goat ages reproductive cycle Etc so our 16-month old goats they're going to be our adult goats you see they have a age of 16 months as I mentioned goats also have a puberty period of 16 months so once a goat reaches 16 months it's going to be able to start to reproduce and there is a gestation period of 5 months which means at this point forward these 16-month-old goats as they continue to age will reproduce one for one every five months so 5 months from now we will have 20 or we have another 10 Z Monon old goats those zero month old goats now will be 5 months old and the three-month old goats will be 8 months old 5 months after that we'll have another newborn set of goats 10 because well our 16-month old goats will have produced again and the cycle will just continue when our 3month old goats reach the age of 16 months well they will start reproducing as well and then our zero month old goats again once they reach 16 months they will start reproducing also visually we have three different well models of goats we have our newborn goats we have our juvenile goats and we have our adult goats so here we go newborns juveniles and our adults as the goats age their visual representation will of course change our newborn goats will change to be the same visual appearance as juveniles when they reach an age of 3 months our juveniles will stay that appearance until they reach the adult age of 16 months at which time then they will visually change their appearance let's jump over to the animal dealer now and talk about what it would take to purchase animals there and deliver them to the farm over at the animal dealer which on riverin Springs is going to be located right here right across the street from the shop and our starting Farm is located right here of course depending on the map you're on the location of the animal dealer will vary one thing that won't be though is that Kate will be here ready to answer any questions that you might have but really we don't have any questions for her we're going to come over here to our animal trigger and we're going to make use of the flegal ttw 140 animal trailer let's take a look in our vehicle shop we're going to scroll down to animals and in the animals section there's going to be an animal transport for transporting our goats we're going to either need the Noah ttw 140 or the Wilson Silver Star Trailer Silver Star will either require a semi or a fifth wheel Dolly meanwhile the no will connect either to a truck or tractor once we are positioned inside the trigger we're going to be able to go into our tractor we can hit R and R will now allow us to either load onto or if we tackle this switch to load off of the trailer since we don't have any on the trailer we can't offload right now we're going to toggle over to our sheeps and goats we're scroll down to the bottom list and you can see once again these prices are the same as they were at the farm but in this case we do not have a delivery fee we can store a total of 13 goats into this trailer so let's go ahead and buy just 10 $7,777 zero delivery fee because we are bringing our own trailer and we now have purchased those and you can see that they are in the trailer just like we can buy animals here at the animal dealer we can also sell them back so if we have had reproduction to the point where now we are over full we are at our capacity on our pastures let's pull that up right we are reached Max Capacity on our pin we just cannot at any point in time hold more therefore when our goats reproduce we're losing we're losing goats right when it fills up our goats will reproduce they just won't spawn anywhere yeah tell me about it it's kind of interesting any rate what we need to do is we need to thin out the herd there's a couple ways to do that we can either put down another pasture and move our goats from one pasture to another using our trailer or we can load goats onto the trailer bring them down to the animal dealer and sell them back to to sell them back we're going to come here to our menu like we did to load onto but we're going to toggle this switch which is then going to say we want to sell from now do note we're not going to get nearly the price that we sold for our animals as we paid for them but with respect to reproduction those were basically free animals anyway so getting a little bit of money is going to be helpful now with respect to what do our goats eat well let's hit escape and let's jump back here to our animal menu and we can see from this information screen that our sheep are going to either take Meadow grass or grass or hay so Meadow grass would be the grass that is growing within the pin and hay or grass would be in the format of either Bales or loose material brought to the pasture so we have three different types of bales that I've got here just to visually demonstrate we have small baby Bales I call them small square bales then we have the larger square bales these come in three different sizes of which this is the medium size I believe and then we have round bales and again this is the medium size they come in three different sizes I have here bales of hay but you can also bail straight grass and typically to feed your goats you're going to be presenting the bail to the feed trough and the bail is just going to basically be consumed within the feed trough and it's going to vanish you're going to be transporting your Bales typically with a front loader you can either use a front loader like this a self-propelled variety or you can get front loader arms for your tractor and make use of it that way we're going to find these here under loaders so we have our front loader we have front loader arms that we would attach to our tractor we have then front L tools like a pallet fork and bail Spike we could also use a tandler or a skid steer if we wish to and then also they're going to have the corresponding pallet fork and bail Spike for each of their Associated Vehicles so here we have the bail Spike here we have the pallet fork and we're going to need the pallet Fork because our goats are going to spawn pallets of milk we going need a flatbed truck or trailer of some sort in order to transport our milk and possibly our bales from the field to the farm so here I have the international CV series and we could take these sides down load up our pallets of milk on this because we're going to either transport our milk to either the base game Dairy that is either pre-placed on the map or one of these two placeables which we'll talk about in a little bit for the open sheep pasture I mentioned that they require water so if you have placed that down you're going to need to have a water tanker you're going to find the water tanker under Vehicles once again down here under the animal section we have barrels and we have four different trailers that are going to be able to transport your water I have the 1600 version right here and then for loose material well I want to jump up on here come on for loose material you'll need some sort of trailer or forage Wagon in order to transport your loose grass or hay we have here the farm Tech fdk 650 and it is loaded up with a load of hay because there's two of different ways to feed you can either feed as I mentioned in bail or loose format now there is currently as a version 1.2.1 of the game an interesting bug with this building here on the right it does not appear to accept Bales meanwhile the other pastures do so the only way to feed this particular building is going to be with loose material again as of version 1.2.1 if you're watching this video and the game has been subsequently updated then this issue may be corrected you can see once we add our pay in here if we look inside our building this hates you can see that we have hay now in that trough inside in addition to hey I mentioned that our animals are going to be able to feed from the meadow grass that is within the pin typically meadowgrass is going to take a little bit of time to register from the time that you have placed it down so what I'm going to do is come over here and go ahead and fast forward into September and we should see now Meadow grass appear on our food charts good morning everybody it is now September and if we check our animal screen what we can now see that we have Meadow grass appearing for all of our pins we have a health of 60% don't worry about that it is slightly affected because of September we didn't feed this particular building but we're going to see in other screens that we have 100% but any rate we have Meadow grass and we have a capacity this is that big pen that we put down 1983 L and our sheep within this are going to be consuming Meadow grass until winter at which time the grass will die back and we'll need to then basically make sure we are definitely feeding hay to all of our animals otherwise their health and their productivity will suffer we toggle over to our next pin well here we have our large pin that had 17 no 10 adult sheep they are now 17 months old because one month has passed they had grass or hay already supplied for them so they have 100% health so if you want to maximize your animals productivity feed them right away don't just count on the meadow grass being there for them we can also see that we are 20% into our reproductive cycle as we move every month this is going to jump 20% because it's 5 months until we reach 100% and at that point in time we're going to see 10 newborns also appear in this building and then our reproductive will go back to 0% the Sheep Barn are newborns are now one month of age they are 6% through their puberty cycle remember they have to reach an age of 16 months before they ready to reproduce and we once again we have our metal grass showing up we have our grass showing up and a total productivity and health of 100% we can see this continue now these goats they didn't again have any grass fed to them so their productivity and their health is down they're not reproducing at all because well their health isn't maximized out so again in order to maximize your productivity go ahead and have on hand some hay to feed these guys when you first put them down then we have our sheep pasture or open sheep pasture we still are good with our water capacity we fed them a little bit of grass from that small baale and our Meadow grass so they are doing fine as well now back to the shop because I mentioned you want to make sure that you can feed these animals from the outset and if you don't have hay right away well you can come here to the shop and you can actually buy it in which is pretty neat so to do that we're going to come down here to objects category Bales and we can buy square bales of hay round bales of hay and you can pretty much just decide which bail do you want to buy how many Bales do you want to buy with a total of up to eight and if we buy these they're going to spawn over the shop we'll need to come and then transport those back to the farm now that some time has passed we also can talk a little bit about what do these guys produce well they produce goat milk and goat milk is going to appear on pallets of these milk jugs and when the pallet reaches 1,000 L it will be full and another pallet will spawn until it's 1,000 L the capacity of this pallet will just keep increasing right now we have 164 L of goat milk in in this pasture in our larger pasture where we placed 10 of each size goat we also have our milk but you're going to notice it has just 24 L of milk well the reason for that is remember we didn't feed these guys so they went a month without being able to eat so they've only been able to eat since September when that meow grass was registered again it really holds that we should feed our animals at the start make sure they maintain them being well fed our newborns as should be aren't producing any milk but what's interesting is our juveniles are now in my opinion that's just a bug and that should be fixed out juveniles should not be producing milk we shouldn't get any milk until our animals are at full age and here we have another set of animals that are full age again goat milk is only 20 leaders because we didn't feed these guys anything either so as I mentioned our juveniles do produce milk a little bit of milk we have a whole six lers of milk but we have milk nonetheless now this also may be patched in a future game update where juveniles don't produce milk when we get our pallet of milk well what do we do with it well we can sell our raw goat milk at the dairy if we do not own the dairy or if we own the dairy we can produce either bottled goat milk or we can produce goat cheese so here we have a bottled goat milk pallet and here we have a pallet of goat cheese we have two different placeable dairies within the base game or we have depending on the map you might have a dairy already pre-placed we do not have a dairy available as far as a production there is a dairy available that is a cell point but it is not a productive point so that is something to take note of you may or may not have a production Dairy on your map if we look at our prices screen and we come down here to our goat milk sell our goat milk at the dairy this is going to be the cell point on the map or we could take it to the dairy if we own the dairy and use it in our production on this map since we have a warehouse we could buy milk in but don't it's it's never going to be profitable to buy goat milk in in order to run it through a production you see our raw goat milk on easy economy is going to have an average low price of 7,614 per th000 liter to 9,220 2 per th000 liter again if you're on normal or hard economy these prices will be different our bottled goat milk which is an output of our production can be either sold at on riverin Springs Farmers Market Co crest valley train sell point the restaurant or the small farmers kiosk just up by the road and the average low price is going to be 5,697 meanwhile the average high price is going to be 6,900 again on easy economy our goat cheese again based per thousand lers is going to have an average low of 4752 or an average high of 5754 and it's going to be available for sale again at the farmers market train sell Point restaurant or the small farmers kiosk let's take a look at our production chains that we own we're going to be able to bring our raw goat milk to our production chain and we're going to be able to produce bottled milk at a ratio of 1 to two so for every 10 units of goat milk we bring we're going to make 20 units of bottled goat milk so imagine 1,000 L of goat milk in equals 2,000 L of goat milk out bottled with respect to the small production we're going to be able to do that in cycles of 14.4 cycles per month the larger placed Dairy well it's going to be able to Output 10 times that at 144 cycles per month our goat cheese is going to take three units of goat cheese for six units of goat cheese or sorry three units of goat milk for six units of goat cheese so again we are doubling and we're going to do that at 960 cycles per month for goat cheese at the big Dairy meanwhile it's going to be just 96 cycles per month at the small Dairy so in all regards the small Dairy is going to produce at 1/10th the speed of the large Dairy so hold on this is me post production coming to you while I'm editing this video I noticed that we can also make standard butter with goat milk that wasn't in the Giants information with respect to what goats are good for so with respect to butter we're going to take three units of goat milk and it's going to make 10 units of standard butter that's at our larger Dairy which is going to be able to do 744 cycles per month the smaller Dairy is going to be able to take three units of goat milk and produce 10 units of butter but it's going to be only able to process at 74.4 cycles per month and now on with the rest of our show so guys that is just about it I think that wraps up everything you need to know with respect to goats and how to car for them here in Farming Simulator 25 where to place the goats the fact that you can customize your PIN and make it larger and suit your area as you should so fit with the use of the new Dynamic pastures feature how to buy your goats either here at the farm or at the animal dealer with a trailer what to feed your goats and how to feed your goats either by Veil form or by loose form and then basically what goats will produce how often goats will reproduce and then where we can take our goat output in Goat milk and either produce additional products with it or sell it if it is available for sale I'd love to know your all's thoughts down in the comments below with respect to goats and farming simulator 25 and until next time happy farming hey Walter
