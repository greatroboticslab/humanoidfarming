1
00:00:00,440 --> 00:00:05,080
so like any crop kinata um harvests

2
00:00:03,080 --> 00:00:07,439
energy from the Sun carbon dioxide from

3
00:00:05,080 --> 00:00:09,480
the air water from the soil and that

4
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:12,240
allows it to create yield for us to use

5
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:14,280
but it also returns carbon into the soil

6
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:15,440
sequestering it there so that uh it's

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:18,199
permanently in the soil or it's

8
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:20,240
available for a future crop to use our

9
00:00:18,199 --> 00:00:22,960
goal with the growing system of kinata

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,960
is to grow kinata in situations where

11
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,720
you normally wouldn't have a crop so

12
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,119
it's a non-f food acre an acre where

13
00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:31,119
nothing would be grown kinata goes in

14
00:00:29,119 --> 00:00:33,879
that place harvests that energy from the

15
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:36,440
Sun Harvest CO2 from the air creates

16
00:00:33,879 --> 00:00:38,879
yield for us to create biofuels other

17
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:40,520
oil type products and also returns

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:43,399
carbon into the soil making it a net

19
00:00:40,520 --> 00:00:43,399
negative carbon

20
00:00:48,520 --> 00:00:51,520
crop
