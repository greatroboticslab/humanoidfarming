but on Mars with only 38% of Earth's

00:00:03,640 --> 00:00:09,280
gravity water behaves differently the

3
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:11,480
irrigation systems must be carefully

4
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:14,519
designed to deliver water directly to

5
00:00:11,480 --> 00:00:17,920
the roots without flooding the soil or

6
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:21,400
allowing water to evaporate too quickly

7
00:00:17,920 --> 00:00:25,160
in Mars's low gravity water doesn't flow

00:00:21,400 --> 00:00:26,880
the same way to overcome this SpaceX has

9
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,960
developed a system that delivers

10
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:30,720
precisely controlled amounts of water

00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,600

Roots this drip irrigation system

13
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,040
ensures that the crops receive exactly

14
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:42,719
the amount of water they need no more no

15
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:46,360
less the water is then recycled filtered

16
00:00:42,719 --> 00:00:50,719
and reused creating a closed loop system

17
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,719
that maximizes efficiency
