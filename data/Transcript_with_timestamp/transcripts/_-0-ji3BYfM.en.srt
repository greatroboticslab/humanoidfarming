2
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:27,060
there's a little bit about my farm i'm

3
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,439
located in central iowa about halfway to

4
00:00:27,060 --> 00:00:31,599
[Music]

5
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,360
um iowa least four acres of land i have

6
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:34,640
about two acres in production and animal

7
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,600
production

8
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,239
um i sell maybe december and my main

9
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,239
business is csa i used to do in person

10
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,079
farmers markets i shipped it to online

11
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,399
what i call online farm stand which is

12
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,760
selling directly to my website

13
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,280
and then i do some online consumer

14
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:51,039
co-ops and increasingly entering more

15
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:53,199
wholesale

16
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:54,640
i've been growing for 10 years

17
00:00:53,199 --> 00:00:56,559
i also worked for three years on a

18
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,359
certified organic farm in heritage which

19
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:01,520
is very close to where i now farm

20
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:03,280
and i'm not currently certified but i am

21
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,439
depending on certifying this season and

22
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
i've always been organically managed

23
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,640
familiar with

24
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:11,960
organic standards and i've always tried

25
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,960
to follow those

26
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:15,360
uh just some pictures of the farm and

27
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:17,520
this kind of shows i'm going to talk

28
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:20,159
about the different parts of our farm

29
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:22,479
how we manage them we have high tunnels

30
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,400
that we manage in a certain way we have

31
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,720
uh what i would call more intensive

32
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:28,960
market garden style beds that we manage

33
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,840
in a certain way and then we have more

34
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:31,360
uh

35
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:33,840
what i might call like broad acre

36
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,360
plasticulture that is

37
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,439
that we use so those are all parts of

38
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:41,479
our rotation

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,479
and cropping system

40
00:01:42,160 --> 00:01:46,880
[Music]

41
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:47,680
this past year

42
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,200
um

43
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:51,439
so i feel like it's always good to start

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,320
off a presentation with some disclaimers

45
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:54,159
about

46
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:55,280
what i can what information i can and

47
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,040
can't give you

48
00:01:55,280 --> 00:01:59,119
um so this is just what i've worked on

49
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,799
on farm so far and this system will

50
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,320
continue to evolve without seeing how

51
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,360
much has evolved into 10 years i've been

52
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:05,439
farming

53
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:08,080
and so obviously all systems are

54
00:02:05,439 --> 00:02:09,520
subject to revision over time obviously

55
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:12,560
you can't take the system on one part

56
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:12,560
and draft it on your own

57
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:18,080
personality into lots of different

58
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,080
things

59
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:23,120
and what i found is that

60
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,959
even small variations in location and

61
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,080
climate and soil type can make huge

62
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:27,520
differences

63
00:02:26,080 --> 00:02:29,280
in whether a production system is going

64
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
to work for you or not it's obviously

65
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:33,040
something that works in northern

66
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
minnesota may not work in central iowa

67
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,720
but even something that works in

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,400
northeast iowa may not work in central

69
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:40,080
iowa so that's

70
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:41,519
don't take any sort of production system

71
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,080
and think well this is it because you

72
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,440
have to then adapt it to your particular

73
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:47,920
circumstances which are always going to

74
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:47,920
be different

75
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,800
and then

76
00:02:49,360 --> 00:02:51,599
this is something that i feel like i

77
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,280
kind of

78
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:54,480
started to learn at this conference and

79
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
i'm going to talk about that on the next

80
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:57,120
slide but

81
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,519
don't let the perfect be the end really

82
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:00,959
good so i think with crop rotation

83
00:02:59,519 --> 00:03:02,480
especially early on i thought i'd have

84
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:04,400
to have a set propertization i haven't

85
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:06,319
had this figured out right away and the

86
00:03:04,400 --> 00:03:08,239
truth is that most most farms do not

87
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:10,319
have their crop rotation figured out and

88
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:12,400
that they're changing it over time

89
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:13,120
and that's not a problem it's like

90
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:14,959
you're

91
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,319
slowly moving towards

92
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:17,599
your goals

93
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:20,000
and so there's always going to be a gap

94
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,000
between your plans and your actual

95
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:24,720
like you know live reality and that's

96
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:25,920
not a problem that's just normal

97
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:28,879
um

98
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,879
and i went to a presentation by k jensen

99
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,319
here that was probably

100
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:34,000
probably 10 years ago around the time i

101
00:03:32,319 --> 00:03:35,360
was trying to farm

102
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:37,840
and she mentioned this idea of the

103
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:39,120
fibonacci spiral so like progress is not

104
00:03:37,840 --> 00:03:41,599
linear we tend to think of progress of

105
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:42,560
just being a line or we just move from a

106
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:44,319
to b

107
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:46,000
but actually if our goal is the center

108
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:47,519
of that spiral we're kind of spiraling

109
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,200
in towards that goal

110
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:51,360
and so she gave the example of you know

111
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:53,360
day one when you start your farm

112
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,720
you're not gonna necessarily have like

113
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,480
written

114
00:03:54,720 --> 00:03:58,239
standard operating procedures for your

115
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,840
workers you know that's not necessarily

116
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:01,439
a realistic goal for like the first day

117
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:03,360
you start farming but maybe by like 10

118
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:04,799
years you might have that so it's just a

119
00:04:03,360 --> 00:04:06,560
good way to think about

120
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:08,400
especially if you're starting out that

121
00:04:06,560 --> 00:04:10,159
you're not gonna you're not gonna have

122
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:11,360
things perfectly set from the start

123
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:14,599
you're gonna have to figure things out

124
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:14,599
as you go

125
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:18,720
so i feel like it's always good to sort

126
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:20,160
of interrogate

127
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,919
the assumptions that we're thinking you

128
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:23,520
know obviously in organic standards

129
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:25,040
you're supposed to rotate crops so i

130
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:28,360
understand that but you know the

131
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,360
question is

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:32,000
and it's everyone's favorite answer

133
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
which is yes or no

134
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,199
because i think there's circumstances

135
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,560
where we don't rotate rocks and there

136
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:38,160
are circumstances where we do and i

137
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,759
think in particular

138
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,720
almost no one rotates crops in high

139
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,240
tunnels even in organic systems most

140
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,600
organic growers i know are growing

141
00:04:44,240 --> 00:04:46,720
tomatoes in their high tunnels every

142
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:49,199
single year

143
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,280
which is not what you're supposed to do

144
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:53,040
but they're still doing it and so why

145
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:53,919
does it still work

146
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,800
well

147
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,320
disease pressure builds up over time so

148
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:00,960
growers are usually using greenhouse

149
00:04:58,320 --> 00:05:02,960
specific hybrid varieties

150
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,560
that are very disease resistant people

151
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:06,800
are moving into grafting in order to

152
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:08,880
deal with disease pressure

153
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,160
um and i've also heard that

154
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:11,840
you know you can do that for like 10 to

155
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,120
15 years and then after that point it

156
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:14,720
starts to get more difficult where you

157
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,680
can start to see like depletion in your

158
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:19,199
soil that maybe is not apparent at first

159
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:20,720
so um

160
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,360
so obviously the most immediate reason

161
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:24,400
why we rotate crops is because

162
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,759
because of disease

163
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,759
and soil-borne pest carriers

164
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:30,400
year-to-year that's at least you know on

165
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:32,000
my farm that's my my immediate concern

166
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:34,479
when i'm thinking about where do i put

167
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:36,479
my broccoli this year it's i don't want

168
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:38,320
to carry over the black rot from last

169
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:39,520
year's broccoli to into this year's

170
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:40,400
broadway

171
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,600
um

172
00:05:40,400 --> 00:05:43,039
and i just want to throw out there that

173
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:44,639
you know i've been exposed to this

174
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,639
conference and others

175
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,199
about new ideas around

176
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:50,400
you can actually prevent disease and

177
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:51,919
pest pressure

178
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:53,280
um if you build up the biological

179
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,039
activity your soil and you have complete

180
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:56,000
nutrition for your plants

181
00:05:55,039 --> 00:05:57,759
and i

182
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:59,759
i think we're all kind of trying to work

183
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,680
towards that but it's not necessarily a

184
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,280
realistic again it's not a realistic

185
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:04,880
goal from day one to have that in the

186
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:07,360
situation so we're all still dealing

187
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:09,280
with these disease and pest problems

188
00:06:07,360 --> 00:06:11,199
and so yes we need to

189
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,319
continue to rotate

190
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:14,880
um

191
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,639
so i think the big considerations for

192
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:19,280
crop rotation are

193
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,080
our timing so i think rotating

194
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:24,479
differently times gas crops so is it an

195
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:25,680
early crop is it a mid-season crop is it

196
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:28,240
a lake crop

197
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,080
how far through the season does it go

198
00:06:28,240 --> 00:06:32,319
what kind of window is there for a cover

199
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,680
crop before or after that and how will

200
00:06:32,319 --> 00:06:35,600
that influence

201
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:36,800
what you can have there afterwards so

202
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,800
for example

203
00:06:36,800 --> 00:06:40,880
if you have an early crop

204
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,319
and then you plant an overwintering

205
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:43,440
cover crop there

206
00:06:42,319 --> 00:06:44,800
you probably don't want to have another

207
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,919
early crop there in the next year

208
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:47,039
because you're going to have rye or

209
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,199
something you're going to determine in

210
00:06:47,039 --> 00:06:51,520
the spring so the sequencing of how you

211
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:53,599
see these cash crops and color crops

212
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,440
and being able to alternate timing

213
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,280
is part of what you're thinking about

214
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:58,639
with the crop rotation

215
00:06:57,280 --> 00:06:59,840
um and then there's obviously the

216
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,720
fertility the soil the wheat

217
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:04,880
consideration so um there's the whole

218
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:06,560
schematic of heavy feeder light feeder

219
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:07,919
legumes so you have

220
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,960
certain types of crops that use a lot of

221
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
nitrogen

222
00:07:08,960 --> 00:07:12,160
certain type of process you can use a

223
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,840
little bit of nitrogen and then crops

224
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:16,240
that produce their own

225
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:18,080
and now that's not a realistic rotation

226
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:19,840
for most of us because most of us are

227
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,280
you know way over representation of the

228
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,039
heavy meters

229
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:24,240
um particularly we always talk about

230
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:25,840
processors

231
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:27,840
always being overrepresented in a lot of

232
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:28,960
vegetable complications

233
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:31,120
so we're obviously not going to grow

234
00:07:28,960 --> 00:07:33,520
like equal amounts of each of those but

235
00:07:31,120 --> 00:07:35,440
it's something to think about

236
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:36,960
um i think of another considerations

237
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:38,639
that are there's crops that are easy to

238
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:40,880
eat and crops are hard

239
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:42,720
so like carrots and onions

240
00:07:40,880 --> 00:07:44,400
our crops are very susceptible to early

241
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:46,400
deep pressure so you probably don't want

242
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:47,520
to put those in your medius field you

243
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:49,599
know you want to think about what was

244
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,199
the wheat seed load like there last year

245
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,800
did i let a lot of wheat seed fall on

246
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:54,080
the ground that last year probably i

247
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:56,960
don't want to put my carrots there this

248
00:07:54,080 --> 00:07:58,800
year versus potatoes that's an easier

249
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:00,479
crowd controlled builds in a little bit

250
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
more tolerant of weeds

251
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:06,089
so those are things to think about

252
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,089
[Music]

253
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:12,879
so this is a this is a map of my farm

254
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,560
that we

255
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:16,400
i think this particular map we actually

256
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:18,560
drew up this past year

257
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:20,960
and this shows our field system and kind

258
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:21,680
of how we how our farm is set up and how

259
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,240
we

260
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:25,360
rotate through these different fields

261
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,039
so

262
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,879
uh just to show you the what's called

263
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:30,479
the short fuel north shore south those

264
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,360
are what i call the

265
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,519
market garden intensive production type

266
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:37,680
bed so those are 100 feet long

267
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,440
they're uh the beds are

268
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:40,560
four feet to four and a half foot on the

269
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:41,360
center

270
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,360
um

271
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,600
we tend to manage those by hand

272
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:46,959
generally like in terms of work we do

273
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
no-till on these beds which i'll talk a

274
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:50,880
little bit more about we tend to use the

275
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,920
bcs walk-behind tractor for preparing

276
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:53,600
the soil

277
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,959
although i am increasingly setting them

278
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:56,959
up for tractor

279
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,040
um spacing

280
00:08:56,959 --> 00:09:00,480
um and they're bare soils we manage them

281
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:03,279
as air soil

282
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:05,279
and then we also grow

283
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:07,440
crops that are higher value and higher

284
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,760
turnover in those beds

285
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,760
the long field west longfield east and

286
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:14,000
the far field those are set up

287
00:09:11,760 --> 00:09:16,000
uh for tractor cultivation and they're

288
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,120
set up for laying plastic mulch and so

289
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,480
they're longer those are 265 or 270

290
00:09:19,120 --> 00:09:22,880
footbeds

291
00:09:20,480 --> 00:09:25,279
so i kind of have a hybrid system on our

292
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,120
farm where we have both what i would

293
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:28,560
call like intensive market garden style

294
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:30,560
production and we also have what i would

295
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,160
call more like a broad anchor

296
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:34,080
um

297
00:09:32,160 --> 00:09:36,399
glass culture

298
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,000
tractor rototiller peg system

299
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:40,640
so as i mentioned in the short beds we

300
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,800
do shorter maturity higher value props

301
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:45,279
so lettuces

302
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:47,519
spinach carrots beets

303
00:09:45,279 --> 00:09:49,120
um things that we can double crop so our

304
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:51,839
goal with that is to get two crops a

305
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,880
year at least it's not free

306
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,399
um

307
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,399
so there tends to be a higher labor

308
00:09:54,399 --> 00:09:58,800
input per crop because we're going in

309
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:00,880
there and we're cultivating my hand and

310
00:09:58,800 --> 00:10:01,600
we're playing compost potentially

311
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:03,200
so

312
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,720
there's a higher labor involve a line to

313
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:06,880
get a higher

314
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,839
higher revenue

315
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,920
in those

316
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,680
in those fields we tend to use compost

317
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,959
as the basis for our fertility so we're

318
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,560
laying a significant amount of compost

319
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:19,120
and that's part of what we can do with

320
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:21,040
our no-till trial that hannah and i did

321
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,079
over the last few years where

322
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:26,800
we actually tested out

323
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:28,000
no-till management versus prototype

324
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:29,360
management

325
00:10:28,000 --> 00:10:30,720
and i did that in these heads and so as

326
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:32,399
part of that we were laying down really

327
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:35,040
thick layers of compost and you're using

328
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:37,680
that as the basically a mulch that we're

329
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,880
then planting into without rototilling

330
00:10:37,680 --> 00:10:40,720
um

331
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,480
we usually use overhead irrigation in

332
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,600
this in this section and that's partly

333
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:46,160
because we're doing a lot of hand

334
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:47,760
cultivation and if you have irrigation

335
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:49,839
and you can cultivation it's really

336
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:51,360
really annoying to have to work around

337
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:52,880
your irrigation or have to move it out

338
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
of the way and move it back

339
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:56,160
so we moved to doing overhead irrigation

340
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,240
in this in this area

341
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
that also really helps to germinate in

342
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,600
sea so like carrots in particular we've

343
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,399
had really

344
00:11:01,600 --> 00:11:06,079
two really dry summers and

345
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,320
both those summers i've germinated my

346
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:10,079
carrots entirely in irrigation whereas

347
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:12,959
in the past i germinated those with

348
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:15,760
rainfall and so that's been a really big

349
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:17,040
part of being able to control

350
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,480
more of our

351
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:21,120
seed germination especially in that

352
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,720
summer summer window

353
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:24,399
and as i mentioned we do we control back

354
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:26,000
hands we use a lot of wheel hoes we've

355
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:28,800
set up our spacing so that we can use

356
00:11:26,000 --> 00:11:30,560
different types of wheel hose um

357
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,600
you know so we tend to do things on two

358
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:35,680
or three rows mostly so that our spacing

359
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,959
is sort of standardized and it's easy

360
00:11:35,680 --> 00:11:40,640
for us to go into the wheel hose and

361
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:40,640
just will hold the entire field

362
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:45,279
so with the long beds

363
00:11:42,560 --> 00:11:47,200
uh longer maturity lower value crops

364
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
i'm going to show a crop list in my next

365
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:50,000
slide with potatoes

366
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:53,040
um

367
00:11:50,000 --> 00:11:54,000
brassicas broccoli brussels sprouts

368
00:11:53,040 --> 00:11:56,720
um

369
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,079
onions garlic

370
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,000
we look at that as we're trying to get a

371
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:01,760
single cash crop and a single cover crop

372
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,839
per season so we're trying to basically

373
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,360
rotate cash crop cover crop cash drop

374
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:06,959
cover crop

375
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,480
and so the cover crops are the basis of

376
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,320
our fertility in those fields we're

377
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,399
looking to use those rather than compost

378
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:13,760
or something to recycle nutrients into

379
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:15,440
the soil

380
00:12:13,760 --> 00:12:17,040
um and so we do use plastic mulch in

381
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:18,639
those fields i don't i'm not set up for

382
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,680
cultivation i don't have a cultivated

383
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:20,720
tractor

384
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,959
um

385
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,959
i have one tractor that i use

386
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:27,200
um where the only cultivation i can do

387
00:12:24,959 --> 00:12:28,560
is blind cultivation so it's not very

388
00:12:27,200 --> 00:12:31,200
good for

389
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:32,880
actually green crops i can weed the

390
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,720
tire traps

391
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:36,320
between the plastic beds but that's a

392
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:37,839
big reason why we use plastic mulch

393
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:39,120
that's not something i necessarily seem

394
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,120
to be

395
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:42,560
a practice that we use forever but i

396
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:43,760
have to get to the point where i have

397
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,279
the hopefully

398
00:12:43,760 --> 00:12:46,639
the experience to be able to get rid of

399
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:48,959
it

400
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:50,240
in those beds we use drip irrigation

401
00:12:48,959 --> 00:12:51,680
because we just put them under the

402
00:12:50,240 --> 00:12:53,120
plastic bed

403
00:12:51,680 --> 00:12:55,760
we lay them at the same time as the

404
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:55,760
plastic mulch

405
00:12:55,839 --> 00:12:59,120
and then like i said we'll use the

406
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:00,720
tractor to cultivate the tire tracks

407
00:12:59,120 --> 00:13:02,480
between the plastic we'll also do those

408
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:05,120
vultures within them

409
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:09,040
entire cracks so landscape fabric straw

410
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:09,040
mulch or we'll use wheelholes

411
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:16,880
so the picture on the left is our that's

412
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:20,160
germinated carrots like sometime in

413
00:13:16,880 --> 00:13:21,680
august and so that's our 100 foot beds

414
00:13:20,160 --> 00:13:23,360
you know the more intensive market

415
00:13:21,680 --> 00:13:25,040
garden style production

416
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:26,800
and then on the right that's um we're

417
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:28,079
harvesting over winter onions fresher

418
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,680
onions in

419
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:31,839
june and so there's also you can see

420
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:34,880
there's garlic and onions on either side

421
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:36,079
of my workers there um and so those are

422
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:37,519
the plastic beds and that's going to

423
00:13:36,079 --> 00:13:40,480
take a look at how those two different

424
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:40,480
types of fields look

425
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:46,639
so these are this is the kind of the

426
00:13:45,279 --> 00:13:48,079
this is the traditionally then our

427
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:49,680
process i say traditionally is in the

428
00:13:48,079 --> 00:13:52,480
last few years this has been what we've

429
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,079
rotated through those different beds

430
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,079
so as i said we

431
00:13:54,079 --> 00:13:57,760
cluster crops so we could grow

432
00:13:56,079 --> 00:13:59,680
certain types of crops in the short beds

433
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,040
and then we grow a certain type of crops

434
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,959
in the long beds

435
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:04,880
um and so as i mentioned the short beds

436
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:06,880
the emphasis is on shorter season

437
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:08,399
generally things that are 60 days no

438
00:14:06,880 --> 00:14:09,519
more than 60 days would be you know

439
00:14:08,399 --> 00:14:10,560
green beans

440
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:12,240
and some of these things are a little

441
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:13,760
bit longer than that but the idea is

442
00:14:12,240 --> 00:14:15,120
that we could grow two of these crops in

443
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:17,760
a season

444
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:20,000
um and then the long beds the goal is

445
00:14:17,760 --> 00:14:22,000
just to only get a single crop per year

446
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:24,560
remove the plastic and put cover crop

447
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:27,600
down or have cover crop and then fill

448
00:14:24,560 --> 00:14:27,600
that in plastic

449
00:14:28,839 --> 00:14:33,760
so one of the big changes we're making

450
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:36,000
this year is we're really tearing down

451
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:38,160
what we're growing um we're trying to

452
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,600
increase the amount of diversity

453
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,600
of props that we're growing and really

454
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:43,120
focus on the crops that we feel like we

455
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:46,079
grow well

456
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:47,440
have a good demand for them and we can

457
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,360
actually grow profitably because we've

458
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:50,560
been dropping crops from our acropolis

459
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:51,680
so the bolden ones and the ones are

460
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:52,880
still growing

461
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:54,800
and they're the ones that are not molded

462
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:56,320
are the ones we decided to drop

463
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:58,240
and by drop i mean we're just not

464
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,639
growing them at all or we may be buying

465
00:14:58,240 --> 00:15:02,720
them from another producer

466
00:15:00,639 --> 00:15:04,079
who has a better system than us so for

467
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:05,680
example getting sweet potatoes from

468
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:06,959
someone who grows like six acres of

469
00:15:05,680 --> 00:15:09,199
sweet potatoes

470
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:10,639
they've got tractor systems set up for

471
00:15:09,199 --> 00:15:12,720
planting and cultivating they just have

472
00:15:10,639 --> 00:15:13,920
a much better system than us and so it

473
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:15,839
doesn't really make sense for us to try

474
00:15:13,920 --> 00:15:17,279
to get sweet potatoes given our scale

475
00:15:15,839 --> 00:15:18,880
you know equipment

476
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,199
so that's this is an evolving part of

477
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:22,639
our farm um

478
00:15:21,199 --> 00:15:24,480
but this is just kind of showing you

479
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:26,480
what we're still growing and what we

480
00:15:24,480 --> 00:15:27,920
what we've dropped um

481
00:15:26,480 --> 00:15:30,320
it does make crop rotation a little bit

482
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:32,000
more challenging um in some ways because

483
00:15:30,320 --> 00:15:33,120
we're growing larger amounts of fewer

484
00:15:32,000 --> 00:15:34,160
crops

485
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:35,839
and so

486
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:37,839
we've got bigger blocks of products to

487
00:15:35,839 --> 00:15:39,680
rotate through the field versus having

488
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:42,880
more diversity that we can rotate

489
00:15:39,680 --> 00:15:44,399
smaller groups of crops in the field

490
00:15:42,880 --> 00:15:46,880
but what we're looking at is this is

491
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,959
kind of how i look at crop rotation

492
00:15:46,880 --> 00:15:50,800
we have we have families of crops that

493
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,480
we rotate through and this largely has

494
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:54,160
to do with disease you know there's a

495
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:56,480
disease that affects certain families

496
00:15:54,160 --> 00:15:58,000
like for example black rot is a disease

497
00:15:56,480 --> 00:15:59,759
that affects the brassica family it

498
00:15:58,000 --> 00:16:01,440
doesn't affect cucurbits it doesn't

499
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,360
affect aluminum

500
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,720
um so that's largely what's that based

501
00:16:03,360 --> 00:16:06,079
around it's also based a little bit

502
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:08,720
around

503
00:16:06,079 --> 00:16:09,920
uh fertility for example so like you

504
00:16:08,720 --> 00:16:11,759
know there's

505
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,839
similar fertility needs within the

506
00:16:11,759 --> 00:16:15,680
nebraska family and similar fertility

507
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,399
means within the carrot family

508
00:16:15,680 --> 00:16:20,160
um so that is another part of why those

509
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:23,040
are clustered together but when i'm

510
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:25,519
looking at actually making a map of the

511
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:27,920
field and like where things are going to

512
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:30,399
go this is how i'm clustering things and

513
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:31,839
then within each of those clusters i

514
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:33,440
might say okay the property's going to

515
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,040
go exactly here the potatoes are going

516
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,000
to go exactly here

517
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:37,440
but

518
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:40,820
the first step is just kind of figuring

519
00:16:37,440 --> 00:16:43,040
out what block of crops is going to go

520
00:16:40,820 --> 00:16:44,240
[Music]

521
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,399
and i would say

522
00:16:44,240 --> 00:16:48,000
it's more important than the long beds

523
00:16:46,399 --> 00:16:49,440
that kind of rotation

524
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:50,720
or really mapping that out with the

525
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,639
short beds it tends to be because

526
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:54,320
there's so much turnover in those beds

527
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:56,800
it's a little bit harder to have a set

528
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:58,160
rotation plan for those beds so i still

529
00:16:56,800 --> 00:17:00,000
think that through but it's a little bit

530
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:03,880
more fluid in those heads

531
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,880
than it is with the long range

532
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,400
so and then just to mention the high

533
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,760
tunnel so

534
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:12,559
um i have one

535
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:14,240
30 by 96 high tunnel and so we rotate

536
00:17:12,559 --> 00:17:15,280
that we have basically three seasons in

537
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:17,039
that tunnel

538
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:18,079
we have a spring season where we plan

539
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:19,679
you in the next few weeks

540
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:21,839
[Music]

541
00:17:19,679 --> 00:17:24,400
typically we plant spinach and lettuce

542
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,079
although we do also um sometimes plant

543
00:17:24,400 --> 00:17:28,000
arugula and kale

544
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:29,760
and then in the summer we have tomatoes

545
00:17:28,000 --> 00:17:31,280
in there generally just tomatoes i also

546
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,960
have tried other crops in there and they

547
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,120
try other crops in the future but

548
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:36,960
generally it's just tomatoes

549
00:17:35,120 --> 00:17:38,799
and then in the fall we'll rip out the

550
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:40,880
tomatoes and we plant spinach and

551
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:42,400
lettuce and then we generally will

552
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:44,559
harvest that up through december and

553
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:46,400
then the spinach will harvest these in

554
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:48,080
january and february

555
00:17:46,400 --> 00:17:49,600
so that's kind of the rotation that we

556
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:51,039
have in the high tunnels you can see

557
00:17:49,600 --> 00:17:53,280
it's not a

558
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:54,960
it's the same props every year and so

559
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:57,039
part of the problem is with having only

560
00:17:54,960 --> 00:18:00,480
one high tunnel it's difficult to have

561
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:02,240
an actual rotation um so i'm hoping

562
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,400
over the years to add tunnels and to be

563
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:05,360
able to do more rotation

564
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:06,799
and then

565
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:08,640
having more tunnels would also allow us

566
00:18:06,799 --> 00:18:10,960
to potentially have a fallow period so

567
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:12,559
for example we could take one funnel

568
00:18:10,960 --> 00:18:14,160
uh let's say they're like three combos

569
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:16,080
we take one tunnel every year we can

570
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,760
just grow a cover crop in there so to

571
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:20,160
give it a rest to break up disease

572
00:18:17,760 --> 00:18:21,120
cycles break up with cycles

573
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:23,360
um

574
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,640
but currently you have only one tunnel

575
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:26,080
we're doing this

576
00:18:24,640 --> 00:18:28,480
it's working so far i mentioned there's

577
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,760
some pitfalls to that but

578
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,559
i'll kind of cross that bridge when i

579
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:32,559
come to it so

580
00:18:32,720 --> 00:18:36,320
um so these are the crop families that

581
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:37,840
were rotating in the tunnel you know

582
00:18:36,320 --> 00:18:40,000
functionally we're really just rotating

583
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:41,120
lettuce spinach and nightshade and like

584
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,880
i said with the tomatoes we're just

585
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:45,200
growing the tomatoes in the same

586
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:45,200
same place

587
00:18:45,840 --> 00:18:49,840
um this is just a

588
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,400
schematic that i came up with recently

589
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:54,080
to show how we flip the tunnel from

590
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:56,880
one season to another

591
00:18:54,080 --> 00:18:58,480
so on the left what you're seeing is

592
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:00,480
this is what it looks like when we have

593
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:02,320
small we have fall and spring greens in

594
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:03,440
the tunnel and so

595
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,360
the black

596
00:19:03,440 --> 00:19:07,360
strips are landscape fabric and then the

597
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:08,799
green strips are the planted bed and

598
00:19:07,360 --> 00:19:11,120
then kind of each row in this

599
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:11,919
spreadsheet is a foot so you see it's 30

600
00:19:11,120 --> 00:19:14,320
feet

601
00:19:11,919 --> 00:19:15,840
so this is flipping across the tunnel

602
00:19:14,320 --> 00:19:17,360
and so you can see on the edges we have

603
00:19:15,840 --> 00:19:18,640
three foot fabric

604
00:19:17,360 --> 00:19:20,960
along the edges that's kind of a

605
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:21,919
permanent walkway some growers like grow

606
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,919
all the way up to the edges of the

607
00:19:21,919 --> 00:19:25,440
tunnel i'm six foot eight it's really

608
00:19:23,919 --> 00:19:27,360
hard for me to put right up against the

609
00:19:25,440 --> 00:19:28,799
edge of a tunnel and so i like to have a

610
00:19:27,360 --> 00:19:29,840
walkway where they can walk all the way

611
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:30,880
around

612
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:32,240
um

613
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:35,200
and then you can see we have the four

614
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:37,280
foot beds and we plant with a paper pot

615
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:38,880
transplanter and that's how we planned

616
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:40,400
our lettuce and spinach so we do six

617
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:41,840
rows on

618
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:43,679
a four foot wide bed which is about

619
00:19:41,840 --> 00:19:45,360
eight or nine inches between row it's

620
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,200
about as close as you can get the paper

621
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:48,480
pot transplanter

622
00:19:47,200 --> 00:19:51,440
between

623
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:51,440
just going down the bed

624
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:54,880
and then we actually generally remove

625
00:19:53,039 --> 00:19:55,760
the landscape fabrics we just have a one

626
00:19:54,880 --> 00:19:57,760
foot

627
00:19:55,760 --> 00:20:00,080
bare soil bed

628
00:19:57,760 --> 00:20:02,080
or sorry parasol pathway between the

629
00:20:00,080 --> 00:20:04,159
beds that will just wheel hoe for

630
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:06,480
re-control

631
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,039
okay so that's fall and spring when we

632
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:10,400
flip into our summer production which is

633
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:12,880
tomatoes

634
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,360
we roll out landscape fabric onto those

635
00:20:12,880 --> 00:20:17,200
pathways and so we roll it right over

636
00:20:15,360 --> 00:20:19,120
the center of the pathway and so we're

637
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:21,039
covering that one foot pathway plus

638
00:20:19,120 --> 00:20:23,039
we're covering a foot on either side and

639
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:25,600
so we're narrowing our beds down to two

640
00:20:23,039 --> 00:20:26,640
feet wide now so two foot wide stretch

641
00:20:25,600 --> 00:20:28,000
and that's where we're planting our

642
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:28,799
tomatoes

643
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:30,400
and

644
00:20:28,799 --> 00:20:32,880
most recently we've been planting them

645
00:20:30,400 --> 00:20:34,720
in a single row and doing a dump and

646
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:37,280
training into a double leader so we have

647
00:20:34,720 --> 00:20:40,159
a single row tomato space one foot apart

648
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,640
with a double leader going to a wire

649
00:20:40,159 --> 00:20:45,520
that runs the wire would run like right

650
00:20:42,640 --> 00:20:47,200
here and right here so right along the

651
00:20:45,520 --> 00:20:48,080
edges of the bed running all the way

652
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:49,760
down

653
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:51,520
the length of the high tunnel and so

654
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:52,559
we're training the tomatoes up to that

655
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:54,720
wire

656
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,840
um i think that i'm what i'm going to do

657
00:20:54,720 --> 00:20:58,000
this year is i'm actually going to do a

658
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,880
double row of single leaders

659
00:20:58,000 --> 00:21:02,159
because i think i might have

660
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,760
basically i think the system i've been

661
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,000
using is more for a grafted tomato and

662
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:08,559
i'm not grafting and so i'm moving more

663
00:21:06,000 --> 00:21:10,240
towards a double row single liter so

664
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:11,360
i'll be planting instead of planting the

665
00:21:10,240 --> 00:21:12,799
tomatoes

666
00:21:11,360 --> 00:21:15,200
right down the center i'll be planting

667
00:21:12,799 --> 00:21:16,880
them like in a diamond style on either

668
00:21:15,200 --> 00:21:18,880
side so they'll be more directly above

669
00:21:16,880 --> 00:21:20,480
the wire

670
00:21:18,880 --> 00:21:22,559
and then when we flip back into fall

671
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,880
production we rip out the tomatoes we

672
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,159
take out the landscape fabric usually we

673
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:28,159
irrigate

674
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:30,159
because the soil is quite dry at that

675
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:32,159
point and it's been compacted from us

676
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:34,159
walking up and down the pathways

677
00:21:32,159 --> 00:21:36,240
and then we'll broad fork

678
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:39,600
lay down a bunch of compost

679
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,960
and then we'll plant our our

680
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,360
lettuce and spinach into that and so

681
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:45,120
we've been managing the

682
00:21:43,360 --> 00:21:46,480
high tunnel no-till

683
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:49,280
for the last several years but i think

684
00:21:46,480 --> 00:21:49,280
it's working really well

685
00:21:49,840 --> 00:21:53,679
any questions so far about

686
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:54,720
uh about this or anything else that i've

687
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,039
talked about

688
00:21:54,720 --> 00:21:59,360
we'll also leave time for questions

689
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,360
at the end

690
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,280
i probably like shouldn't be showing

691
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:07,440
this from a book but i got this from i

692
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:09,280
got this from andrew medford's book just

693
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,440
to show you this is where i got this

694
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:12,880
system from so if you're interested in

695
00:22:11,440 --> 00:22:14,320
that i don't know if they have that in

696
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:16,000
the bookstore but

697
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:17,120
you can go check it out but basically

698
00:22:16,000 --> 00:22:19,840
showing you how to do this for a bunch

699
00:22:17,120 --> 00:22:19,840
of different crops

700
00:22:22,480 --> 00:22:26,799
but um so why when you say you think

701
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,039
that's for granted can you explain a

702
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:32,080
little bit more of why

703
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:34,720
is it the field it's that the tomato

704
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:36,240
basically doesn't have enough um

705
00:22:34,720 --> 00:22:38,720
doesn't have enough productivity to

706
00:22:36,240 --> 00:22:40,080
maintain two stems because it will go

707
00:22:38,720 --> 00:22:41,760
with grafted varieties it's got much

708
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:43,360
stronger root stock and so it has a

709
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:45,039
stronger root system so it can really

710
00:22:43,360 --> 00:22:47,200
produce on two

711
00:22:45,039 --> 00:22:48,880
statins and from conversations about the

712
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,640
growers and actually if you read the

713
00:22:48,880 --> 00:22:52,880
recommendations that's exactly what he

714
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:54,720
said i just kind of skipped over that

715
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:56,080
and

716
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:57,679
so i'm going back to what the

717
00:22:56,080 --> 00:23:00,240
recommendation is which if you're not

718
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:01,919
grafting do a single leader because the

719
00:23:00,240 --> 00:23:03,200
plant will be able to produce more fruit

720
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:04,000
on that single

721
00:23:03,200 --> 00:23:05,360
stem

722
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:06,880
versus if you're trying to train into

723
00:23:05,360 --> 00:23:08,799
two stems you're kind of like overtaxing

724
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:11,360
the pumpkin it's like my understanding

725
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:12,799
unless it's crafted so

726
00:23:11,360 --> 00:23:14,240
yeah so when you're pulling out the

727
00:23:12,799 --> 00:23:15,760
tomatoes and then you kind of pull that

728
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,760
landscape fabric off and you're going

729
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:19,679
back into your fall production you said

730
00:23:17,760 --> 00:23:22,400
you're using a paper pot transplanter

731
00:23:19,679 --> 00:23:24,400
yeah so what are you doing beyond broad

732
00:23:22,400 --> 00:23:26,720
forking to prep the

733
00:23:24,400 --> 00:23:29,120
planting area in a way that's adequate

734
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,799
for the paper pod transplant

735
00:23:29,120 --> 00:23:32,320
so yeah the the sequence is i'm

736
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:35,360
remembering it correctly the sequence is

737
00:23:32,320 --> 00:23:36,720
we irrigate then we broad fork

738
00:23:35,360 --> 00:23:39,919
and then we

739
00:23:36,720 --> 00:23:42,960
lay down the compost and then we will

740
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:45,600
either wheel hoe or tilt to use the

741
00:23:42,960 --> 00:23:47,440
filter to basically get enough

742
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:49,039
um you have to basically get enough

743
00:23:47,440 --> 00:23:50,480
loose soil to be able to run the paper

744
00:23:49,039 --> 00:23:52,720
transplanter and i run the vapor pods

745
00:23:50,480 --> 00:23:54,640
transplanter on the on the

746
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:56,240
shallowest depth i found that works best

747
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:57,840
especially in the dovetail system

748
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:59,919
because if you run it on a deeper depth

749
00:23:57,840 --> 00:24:01,520
of shoe that's just going to catch any

750
00:23:59,919 --> 00:24:02,720
quads that are going to be you know

751
00:24:01,520 --> 00:24:03,520
underneath there

752
00:24:02,720 --> 00:24:06,400
um

753
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:08,240
so that's worked for us

754
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
some sort of tool to

755
00:24:08,240 --> 00:24:11,760
ensure that those paper tops are varied

756
00:24:10,000 --> 00:24:12,559
if you're putting them in shallow as you

757
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:14,480
are

758
00:24:12,559 --> 00:24:15,679
usually we just we do it as a two-person

759
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:16,960
team and so

760
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,240
like others run the paperclock

761
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:19,520
transplant and then someone will just

762
00:24:18,240 --> 00:24:21,600
come behind me and they'll just kind of

763
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:24,080
kick soil in around there or use their

764
00:24:21,600 --> 00:24:24,080
hands yeah

765
00:24:26,720 --> 00:24:30,400
so that's just what that looks like um

766
00:24:29,360 --> 00:24:31,520
what the

767
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:33,200
high tunnel looks like with the

768
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:35,679
landscape fabric with the tomatoes in a

769
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:38,320
single row we did some inter planting of

770
00:24:35,679 --> 00:24:39,760
beneficial plants of borage marigold

771
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:41,039
basil some other things in there so

772
00:24:39,760 --> 00:24:43,200
that's interesting but there's some

773
00:24:41,039 --> 00:24:44,880
weeds in there too and we run a double

774
00:24:43,200 --> 00:24:46,720
drip tape

775
00:24:44,880 --> 00:24:48,240
right along the uh the tomatoes and i

776
00:24:46,720 --> 00:24:49,760
just like the double fit that it just

777
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:50,880
gets more water down

778
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:53,440
to work with me

779
00:24:50,880 --> 00:24:55,039
and so you can see we use the tama hooks

780
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:57,360
which we don't actually use that system

781
00:24:55,039 --> 00:24:58,960
to actually like lower in the tomatoes

782
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:00,799
but i like that for just being able to

783
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:03,200
get it on the wire easily and then we

784
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:05,440
use the plastic tomato clips

785
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:07,200
and we come in and we'll prune the lower

786
00:25:05,440 --> 00:25:08,159
parts of the tomato

787
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:09,840
um

788
00:25:08,159 --> 00:25:11,600
and we'll prune off any suckers so we're

789
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:12,720
just training the tomatoes to two and

790
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:14,640
like i said i'm going to go to just

791
00:25:12,720 --> 00:25:15,440
training under the single deer

792
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:17,200
um

793
00:25:15,440 --> 00:25:18,640
and then you know we're pruning kind of

794
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,480
throughout the season usually up until

795
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:22,400
about harvest time and then we kind of

796
00:25:20,480 --> 00:25:23,919
run out of time and stop pruning at a

797
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:25,919
certain point but it's to just increase

798
00:25:23,919 --> 00:25:27,440
the airflow and make sure that it's not

799
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:29,279
a jungle in there

800
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:30,880
um the last farm i worked on we would

801
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:32,960
kind of stop cooking

802
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:34,559
in like may and so you would go in there

803
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,799
and it would be like going into it into

804
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:40,159
a jungle and it would be extremely humid

805
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:41,919
and hot and covered in tomato pollen

806
00:25:40,159 --> 00:25:43,520
so i try to avoid that but but the

807
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:45,120
pruning labor

808
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:46,559
is sometimes difficult to balance with

809
00:25:45,120 --> 00:25:48,880
everything else we're trying to do on

810
00:25:46,559 --> 00:25:48,880
the farm

811
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:51,919
and then this is what it looks like in

812
00:25:51,039 --> 00:25:53,600
the

813
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:57,360
spring or fall configuration this is

814
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:59,279
this this ball um so you can see there's

815
00:25:57,360 --> 00:26:00,480
roughly half spinach and half lettuce

816
00:25:59,279 --> 00:26:02,000
i've got some kale in there i'm gonna

817
00:26:00,480 --> 00:26:03,919
stop doing kale because we don't plant

818
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:05,360
it early enough to actually get

819
00:26:03,919 --> 00:26:06,799
good yield from that we would need to

820
00:26:05,360 --> 00:26:08,480
plant it

821
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,559
probably in

822
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:12,400
late august or early september to really

823
00:26:10,559 --> 00:26:13,760
get nice-sized plants and so i plan to

824
00:26:12,400 --> 00:26:14,960
end up planting it too late and these

825
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,200
have small kale plants that they don't

826
00:26:14,960 --> 00:26:18,799
produce but spinach and lettuce work

827
00:26:17,200 --> 00:26:20,159
really well in the window that we make

828
00:26:18,799 --> 00:26:21,360
planting which is

829
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:23,120
generally we're planting the end of

830
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:24,799
september or early october so we're

831
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:26,159
ripping out those tomato plants and like

832
00:26:24,799 --> 00:26:28,400
mid to late september and then we're

833
00:26:26,159 --> 00:26:30,240
replanting in the fall greens in late

834
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,679
september early october and then our aim

835
00:26:30,240 --> 00:26:33,360
is to have greens

836
00:26:31,679 --> 00:26:34,400
in november which is around the time

837
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,320
that we

838
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:37,679
have to stop harvesting outdoors so we

839
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:40,559
try to harvest outdoors as long as

840
00:26:37,679 --> 00:26:40,559
possible and then we move

841
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:45,600
so with your

842
00:26:43,360 --> 00:26:46,720
pathways being so narrow

843
00:26:45,600 --> 00:26:48,000
um

844
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:50,480
are you

845
00:26:48,000 --> 00:26:52,799
starting at one end and harvesting

846
00:26:50,480 --> 00:26:52,799
down

847
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:57,360
yeah

848
00:26:55,520 --> 00:26:59,679
no we don't do like the pac-man style or

849
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,400
like plant the whole tunnel out um so we

850
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,240
do have the pathways to walk down um

851
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:06,720
in this plant the plant grows a little

852
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:07,679
bit into the bed sort of the pathway and

853
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:09,200
even though you're not going to walk

854
00:27:07,679 --> 00:27:10,240
into that function of the pathway of the

855
00:27:09,200 --> 00:27:12,880
more like

856
00:27:10,240 --> 00:27:14,159
18 inches you know between plants

857
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:15,679
um but yeah it's a little bit difficult

858
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:18,000
with like getting a harvest so generally

859
00:27:15,679 --> 00:27:19,520
we kind of harvest and then we're

860
00:27:18,000 --> 00:27:21,279
dragging the tote over what we just

861
00:27:19,520 --> 00:27:23,120
harvested you know because it's actually

862
00:27:21,279 --> 00:27:24,799
hard to get our toes down the pathway

863
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:26,399
itself but it is a little awkward we

864
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:28,559
have hoops in here too and the hoops get

865
00:27:26,399 --> 00:27:30,000
in the way so it's always a little bit a

866
00:27:28,559 --> 00:27:31,600
little bit awkward harvesting in this

867
00:27:30,000 --> 00:27:33,520
kind of style but we want to maximize

868
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:35,520
the non-drawing area

869
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:37,039
i haven't yet found the

870
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,200
motivation to try to move towards that

871
00:27:37,039 --> 00:27:40,480
kind of pac-man style which is what that

872
00:27:39,200 --> 00:27:43,039
means is

873
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:45,600
people plant the entire tunnel

874
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:46,960
like wall to wall there's no pathways

875
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,039
and then you just harvest your way

876
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:50,720
through the tunnels you just walk over

877
00:27:49,039 --> 00:27:52,480
what you've harvested and that's the way

878
00:27:50,720 --> 00:27:54,080
exactly is

879
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:56,720
as many greens as possible into the high

880
00:27:54,080 --> 00:27:56,720
tunnel space

881
00:27:58,320 --> 00:28:02,240
um so some of the challenge crop

882
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:03,760
rotation i think just growing different

883
00:28:02,240 --> 00:28:05,760
amounts of the different families like

884
00:28:03,760 --> 00:28:07,760
brassicas are always over represented on

885
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:10,799
those special farms so it's always hard

886
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:12,159
to rotate frosted with other other

887
00:28:10,799 --> 00:28:14,000
things and not

888
00:28:12,159 --> 00:28:15,360
and try to not grow rosters in the same

889
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:17,520
spot every year

890
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,120
um and then like for me my production

891
00:28:17,520 --> 00:28:20,880
levels change from every year i mean

892
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:22,640
part of that is you know

893
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:24,000
a beginning farm especially you know as

894
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:26,000
you're growing

895
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:27,440
or as you're changing your markets

896
00:28:26,000 --> 00:28:28,880
the amounts you're drawing of things is

897
00:28:27,440 --> 00:28:30,399
gonna change and that's gonna that's why

898
00:28:28,880 --> 00:28:32,720
that idea that well i'm gonna have a set

899
00:28:30,399 --> 00:28:34,240
crop rotation i'm gonna use that

900
00:28:32,720 --> 00:28:35,840
well you could have set crop rotation

901
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:37,279
one year and then your market changes or

902
00:28:35,840 --> 00:28:38,880
your size changes and you're gonna have

903
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:40,000
to change that

904
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,200
um

905
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:42,799
and then i think there's always the

906
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:44,559
unexpected adjustments and it's season

907
00:28:42,799 --> 00:28:46,399
for soil conditions we've got to get

908
00:28:44,559 --> 00:28:48,080
this in right now and so we're going to

909
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:49,440
plant it somewhere where it maybe wasn't

910
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:51,440
the crop rotation plant but it's just

911
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:53,120
because the soil conditions are right

912
00:28:51,440 --> 00:28:55,039
um sometimes you run short on

913
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:56,559
transplants or you know you've planted

914
00:28:55,039 --> 00:28:58,880
one less bed of something if you have

915
00:28:56,559 --> 00:29:00,480
the transplants so all those things can

916
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,600
change um

917
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:03,919
and then i think there's always a

918
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:06,240
question about growing things in blocks

919
00:29:03,919 --> 00:29:07,919
so like all the brassicas grow here all

920
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:09,279
the albums grow here versus growing them

921
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:11,840
as a more

922
00:29:09,279 --> 00:29:14,880
heterogeneous distribution so like you

923
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:16,720
know sombras is here somehow he's here i

924
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:17,840
think the block system is easier to

925
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:19,919
scheme out

926
00:29:17,840 --> 00:29:22,559
it's easier to like plan that way

927
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,399
but also you're concentrating potential

928
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:26,559
tests and disease problems in a single

929
00:29:24,399 --> 00:29:28,320
block like you're making it very easy

930
00:29:26,559 --> 00:29:30,559
for pests to move in and be able to like

931
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:32,559
move from proper topic all the crops in

932
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,640
a single family are together

933
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:36,000
um and i'm working in a two-acre field

934
00:29:34,640 --> 00:29:37,760
so it's not as though i've literally

935
00:29:36,000 --> 00:29:39,600
spread things out that much

936
00:29:37,760 --> 00:29:40,480
but even just having something in like

937
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,000
for example

938
00:29:40,480 --> 00:29:44,000
in that map i showed you in the far

939
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:46,559
field versus in you know the field

940
00:29:44,000 --> 00:29:49,120
that's farther um to the west

941
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,520
i see differences in how like if i plant

942
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,880
my spring cucurbits

943
00:29:51,520 --> 00:29:54,559
in one field and i plant my fall

944
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:56,240
compared in another field it takes a

945
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:57,120
while for them to move

946
00:29:56,240 --> 00:29:59,360
from

947
00:29:57,120 --> 00:30:01,520
from crop to crop so for example like

948
00:29:59,360 --> 00:30:03,360
they basically will destroy the

949
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,880
spring zucchini and cucumber talking

950
00:30:03,360 --> 00:30:06,399
about cucumber wheels and squash bugs

951
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:07,679
and then once that crop is destroyed or

952
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:08,880
i've ripped it out and then they moved

953
00:30:07,679 --> 00:30:10,240
to the next one

954
00:30:08,880 --> 00:30:11,039
whereas if they were right next to each

955
00:30:10,240 --> 00:30:12,159
other

956
00:30:11,039 --> 00:30:13,440
i don't know if that would happen i

957
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,279
think they would just spread right

958
00:30:13,440 --> 00:30:16,480
between each other

959
00:30:15,279 --> 00:30:18,080
um

960
00:30:16,480 --> 00:30:19,279
so yeah there's probably more to say

961
00:30:18,080 --> 00:30:21,200
about that i think there's also

962
00:30:19,279 --> 00:30:23,360
considerations of you know being able to

963
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:26,159
interplant with um

964
00:30:23,360 --> 00:30:28,320
beneficials um to break up lots of props

965
00:30:26,159 --> 00:30:31,039
which also can complicate your

966
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:31,039
propagation

967
00:30:32,559 --> 00:30:35,520
um but these are just some basic

968
00:30:33,919 --> 00:30:37,039
principles that i try to follow so i

969
00:30:35,520 --> 00:30:38,720
mean at the very least you're not

970
00:30:37,039 --> 00:30:39,840
growing the same thing in the same soil

971
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:41,679
every year

972
00:30:39,840 --> 00:30:43,760
the high tunnel being the exception

973
00:30:41,679 --> 00:30:45,200
um you know at least every other year

974
00:30:43,760 --> 00:30:46,159
better yet three years i think it's a

975
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:48,080
minimum there's different

976
00:30:46,159 --> 00:30:48,720
recommendations for different diseases

977
00:30:48,080 --> 00:30:50,640
and

978
00:30:48,720 --> 00:30:52,720
different crops you know some people

979
00:30:50,640 --> 00:30:54,720
will say three to five years but in

980
00:30:52,720 --> 00:30:56,720
general if you're breaking up a pest or

981
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,000
disease cycle over a single year i think

982
00:30:56,720 --> 00:30:59,279
that's

983
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:02,080
sometimes that's the best you can do

984
00:30:59,279 --> 00:31:04,159
depending on how much space you have

985
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:06,240
um being aware of edges where diseases

986
00:31:04,159 --> 00:31:08,640
can transfer so i changed the

987
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:09,519
orientation of my fields so they used to

988
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,279
run

989
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:13,279
um east-west and i changed them to

990
00:31:11,279 --> 00:31:15,279
running north-south and what that meant

991
00:31:13,279 --> 00:31:16,240
was now all my beds for one year ran

992
00:31:15,279 --> 00:31:18,799
across

993
00:31:16,240 --> 00:31:20,799
the previous year's beds and so like

994
00:31:18,799 --> 00:31:22,320
there was no way for me to avoid

995
00:31:20,799 --> 00:31:24,159
growing broccoli where i've grown

996
00:31:22,320 --> 00:31:25,600
broccoli the previous year and so what i

997
00:31:24,159 --> 00:31:28,320
found was that was with a black rock

998
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:30,880
transfer so the end of the bed where

999
00:31:28,320 --> 00:31:32,640
where like my current bed crossed the

1000
00:31:30,880 --> 00:31:34,080
old bed that's where the black rock

1001
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,600
showed up first

1002
00:31:34,080 --> 00:31:37,760
and then after that year things got

1003
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:39,440
better because like it just was that one

1004
00:31:37,760 --> 00:31:41,200
year where i changed the orientation of

1005
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:42,000
the beds

1006
00:31:41,200 --> 00:31:43,039
um

1007
00:31:42,000 --> 00:31:44,799
and then obviously if you have

1008
00:31:43,039 --> 00:31:48,000
identifiable either

1009
00:31:44,799 --> 00:31:49,440
or uh pest issues that you know um are a

1010
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:50,880
problem on your farm

1011
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:52,480
learn about the life cycles of those

1012
00:31:50,880 --> 00:31:53,919
things it might make sense to for

1013
00:31:52,480 --> 00:31:55,919
example with black route it makes sense

1014
00:31:53,919 --> 00:31:58,240
to till in your residue

1015
00:31:55,919 --> 00:32:00,080
into the soil either that fall or early

1016
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:02,000
the next spring because the black rod

1017
00:32:00,080 --> 00:32:04,080
will carry over on the residue

1018
00:32:02,000 --> 00:32:06,240
um tillage can also

1019
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:07,600
help with some insects that overwinter

1020
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:09,440
in the soil

1021
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:10,880
so if you till in the fall

1022
00:32:09,440 --> 00:32:12,080
that's generally good practice but if

1023
00:32:10,880 --> 00:32:14,399
you have a specific problem you're

1024
00:32:12,080 --> 00:32:15,360
trying to address it can make sense

1025
00:32:14,399 --> 00:32:17,440
um

1026
00:32:15,360 --> 00:32:20,159
and then soil testing every year or

1027
00:32:17,440 --> 00:32:22,159
every other year is important um

1028
00:32:20,159 --> 00:32:23,600
and then you can adjust your amendments

1029
00:32:22,159 --> 00:32:24,960
based on the so if that's in the actual

1030
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:27,200
needs of the crops you're drawing so

1031
00:32:24,960 --> 00:32:29,200
actually understanding you know what a

1032
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:30,880
could need what do alligators need what

1033
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,399
are you currently in trying to advance

1034
00:32:30,880 --> 00:32:34,159
your soil based on the needs of those

1035
00:32:32,399 --> 00:32:35,760
crops rather than just having maybe a

1036
00:32:34,159 --> 00:32:39,120
fertility program that you use for the

1037
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,399
whole farm without regard to

1038
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,080
the crops you're growing or the

1039
00:32:40,399 --> 00:32:43,519
particularities of your fields because i

1040
00:32:42,080 --> 00:32:44,960
know each of my fields has its own

1041
00:32:43,519 --> 00:32:47,039
particularities one field is kind of

1042
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,640
high in phosphorus one field is

1043
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:51,039
generally lower in organic matter so

1044
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:52,640
knowing what each of your fields

1045
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,000
what the needs are of each of those

1046
00:32:52,640 --> 00:32:55,679
fields you can try to address them

1047
00:32:54,000 --> 00:32:57,840
specifically rather than just kind of

1048
00:32:55,679 --> 00:33:00,320
using a blanket program to address your

1049
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,320
whole phone

1050
00:33:01,519 --> 00:33:05,360
so just to talk a little bit about

1051
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:07,440
record keeping and the way i do it um i

1052
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:09,120
come up with a crop rotation field plan

1053
00:33:07,440 --> 00:33:11,039
and i just use spreadsheets for this so

1054
00:33:09,120 --> 00:33:12,720
i kind of have a spreadsheet that's

1055
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:14,640
similar to that map i showed you but

1056
00:33:12,720 --> 00:33:16,000
it's in the spreadsheet form so like

1057
00:33:14,640 --> 00:33:18,480
each

1058
00:33:16,000 --> 00:33:20,799
row is a bed in that system i think i

1059
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:22,559
have my screenshot of that next

1060
00:33:20,799 --> 00:33:24,640
and then i want to have my actual crop

1061
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:27,039
planting field map so this is my plan

1062
00:33:24,640 --> 00:33:30,159
and this is what i actually did

1063
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,519
um and then that crop planting field map

1064
00:33:30,159 --> 00:33:33,600
becomes my historical record of

1065
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:35,039
propagation so if i have ones that have

1066
00:33:33,600 --> 00:33:37,360
one of those for each year that i can

1067
00:33:35,039 --> 00:33:41,039
look back this is what i plan to wear in

1068
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:43,600
2021 this is home 20 on my team so i can

1069
00:33:41,039 --> 00:33:44,960
make actual crop rotation decisions

1070
00:33:43,600 --> 00:33:47,120
because if you don't remember where you

1071
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:50,960
planted things you can't actually make

1072
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,960
the proper patient decisions

1073
00:33:51,679 --> 00:33:54,720
and so this is just what that looks like

1074
00:33:53,840 --> 00:33:56,960
in the

1075
00:33:54,720 --> 00:33:58,880
spreadsheet so you can see i just

1076
00:33:56,960 --> 00:33:59,919
you know taken the columns and merged

1077
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:02,559
them

1078
00:33:59,919 --> 00:34:04,399
across the rows and so each of those

1079
00:34:02,559 --> 00:34:06,159
each of these columns of the bed and i

1080
00:34:04,399 --> 00:34:07,679
have a little code you know for the bed

1081
00:34:06,159 --> 00:34:10,560
so like this is

1082
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:11,839
that's long field east between the bed

1083
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,440
24

1084
00:34:11,839 --> 00:34:14,639
um and then i've got

1085
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:15,919
this is actually part of my plan for

1086
00:34:14,639 --> 00:34:17,440
this year so what prop i'm gonna grow

1087
00:34:15,919 --> 00:34:19,200
sometimes i'll also put in the cover

1088
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:20,639
crop that i'm growing in there

1089
00:34:19,200 --> 00:34:23,760
but this is the plan and so then i'm

1090
00:34:20,639 --> 00:34:26,159
going to want to capture the actual

1091
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:28,159
planting that i did this year because if

1092
00:34:26,159 --> 00:34:29,839
i just have the plan and i'm going to

1093
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,119
plan for next year

1094
00:34:29,839 --> 00:34:32,720
i don't necessarily know if i actually

1095
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:34,960
fall through that plan or not or if i

1096
00:34:32,720 --> 00:34:34,960
had to

1097
00:34:37,139 --> 00:34:40,249
[Music]

1098
00:34:44,240 --> 00:34:46,879
so

1099
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:49,280
my farm is humbling and service and

1100
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:49,280
decor

1101
00:34:54,879 --> 00:35:00,839
so this is a picture from our first

1102
00:34:57,839 --> 00:35:03,040
second in our second hand

1103
00:35:00,839 --> 00:35:04,720
um and

1104
00:35:03,040 --> 00:35:08,480
um

1105
00:35:04,720 --> 00:35:10,320
yeah so our we have a two acre field and

1106
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:13,760
it's laid out um

1107
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:13,760
in six sections

1108
00:35:14,640 --> 00:35:16,880
about

1109
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:26,800
um

1110
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:28,160
can you turn up the volume a little bit

1111
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:30,960
please oh

1112
00:35:28,160 --> 00:35:30,960
i think your

1113
00:35:37,440 --> 00:35:41,760
um

1114
00:35:39,200 --> 00:35:45,920
yes so this is a picture of planting

1115
00:35:41,760 --> 00:35:47,599
garlic um so garlic is our our

1116
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:49,440
um

1117
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:52,160
we have six sections we're entering into

1118
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:54,560
year six of our farm so we'll have gone

1119
00:35:52,160 --> 00:35:57,880
through every single section

1120
00:35:54,560 --> 00:36:00,079
um after this year and then we'll be

1121
00:35:57,880 --> 00:36:02,160
re-restarting and next

1122
00:36:00,079 --> 00:36:05,280
in 2023 we'll be

1123
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:08,079
restarting the cycle so um

1124
00:36:05,280 --> 00:36:09,280
uh allianz is is our first

1125
00:36:08,079 --> 00:36:10,720
um

1126
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,880
first

1127
00:36:10,720 --> 00:36:14,960
section and so we plant our garlic we

1128
00:36:12,880 --> 00:36:16,400
plant onions shallots

1129
00:36:14,960 --> 00:36:18,000
um leeks

1130
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:20,160
in this section

1131
00:36:18,000 --> 00:36:21,359
um it's the least

1132
00:36:20,160 --> 00:36:23,440
uh

1133
00:36:21,359 --> 00:36:26,400
it's the least number of beds that we

1134
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:28,160
need to use of any section so sometimes

1135
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:30,560
we stick in

1136
00:36:28,160 --> 00:36:33,359
um maybe if you want to plant some corn

1137
00:36:30,560 --> 00:36:35,359
popcorn or something for fun um we'll

1138
00:36:33,359 --> 00:36:37,280
we'll throw them in the allium section

1139
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:40,320
but otherwise we can cover crop about

1140
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:41,359
half half of the section during the year

1141
00:36:40,320 --> 00:36:44,640
um

1142
00:36:41,359 --> 00:36:47,200
this picture is actually of

1143
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:48,480
our no-till system which we started just

1144
00:36:47,200 --> 00:36:52,079
a couple years ago we started

1145
00:36:48,480 --> 00:36:55,280
transitioning our farm to no-till so

1146
00:36:52,079 --> 00:36:58,400
that means we um

1147
00:36:55,280 --> 00:37:00,560
this yeah this year with maryland we

1148
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:02,960
actually put furrows in our no-till beds

1149
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:04,800
and then we covered those

1150
00:37:02,960 --> 00:37:06,960
once we planted the garlic you covered

1151
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:08,720
it with samples and that was our method

1152
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:11,040
of

1153
00:37:08,720 --> 00:37:13,760
covering the furrows and then we mulch

1154
00:37:11,040 --> 00:37:17,200
after that um but yeah our no-till

1155
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:19,359
system is basically complex based we

1156
00:37:17,200 --> 00:37:23,040
build up a bed um

1157
00:37:19,359 --> 00:37:23,839
we kind of dig out pathways that we can

1158
00:37:23,040 --> 00:37:25,359
um

1159
00:37:23,839 --> 00:37:28,079
that are that are

1160
00:37:25,359 --> 00:37:30,960
permanent and then we can add compost to

1161
00:37:28,079 --> 00:37:33,280
the bed and create tilt

1162
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:33,280
and

1163
00:37:34,839 --> 00:37:39,960
uh you hear me

1164
00:37:36,960 --> 00:37:39,960
um

1165
00:37:50,640 --> 00:37:54,400
they've been having problems

1166
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,320
i'll just talk really loud can you hear

1167
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,960
me in the back

1168
00:37:56,320 --> 00:38:00,079
great kind of okay i'll be as loud as i

1169
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:01,760
can

1170
00:38:00,079 --> 00:38:04,640
um

1171
00:38:01,760 --> 00:38:06,160
yeah uh

1172
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:07,599
i think that's enough on the no-till

1173
00:38:06,160 --> 00:38:09,680
situation so

1174
00:38:07,599 --> 00:38:11,760
um

1175
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:15,520
alliums most of them come out of the

1176
00:38:11,760 --> 00:38:16,720
field pretty early um in in the fall or

1177
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:19,760
late summer

1178
00:38:16,720 --> 00:38:21,760
um and so we are then able to cover

1179
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,119
crowd almost immediately

1180
00:38:21,760 --> 00:38:24,000
um

1181
00:38:23,119 --> 00:38:26,560
uh

1182
00:38:24,000 --> 00:38:28,240
for development of fall so we either put

1183
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:30,880
in oats and peas

1184
00:38:28,240 --> 00:38:33,440
or a rye veg mixture depending on

1185
00:38:30,880 --> 00:38:36,400
whether we went to overwinter the crop

1186
00:38:33,440 --> 00:38:36,400
oh yes i'm back

1187
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:42,160
so if

1188
00:38:38,480 --> 00:38:44,240
if we want a cover crop that's going to

1189
00:38:42,160 --> 00:38:47,119
extend into the spring and grow in the

1190
00:38:44,240 --> 00:38:49,200
spring then we use ryan fetch and if we

1191
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:51,680
want to be able to work the ground

1192
00:38:49,200 --> 00:38:53,760
immediately in the spring we use

1193
00:38:51,680 --> 00:38:55,920
something that winter kills like oats

1194
00:38:53,760 --> 00:38:58,000
and peas

1195
00:38:55,920 --> 00:39:01,359
we also are usually able to get a round

1196
00:38:58,000 --> 00:39:02,800
of buckwheat in um which is a summer

1197
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,280
scrap and we'll

1198
00:39:02,800 --> 00:39:06,560
kill we'll die at first frost

1199
00:39:05,280 --> 00:39:07,920
um

1200
00:39:06,560 --> 00:39:11,520
we're usually able to get a rabbit

1201
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:11,520
buckwheat in after the avalanche

1202
00:39:12,400 --> 00:39:19,200
yes those are garlic's coming up

1203
00:39:15,680 --> 00:39:20,240
um so this picture is of our cucurbit

1204
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:23,520
section

1205
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:26,320
um yeah we follow our

1206
00:39:23,520 --> 00:39:29,119
alliums with cucurbits

1207
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,160
and um

1208
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:32,079
uh

1209
00:39:30,160 --> 00:39:34,480
the

1210
00:39:32,079 --> 00:39:37,839
yeah this picture is

1211
00:39:34,480 --> 00:39:40,400
basically winter squash um will spread

1212
00:39:37,839 --> 00:39:43,040
over many beds so we have to think about

1213
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:43,839
what we're gonna do with the ground that

1214
00:39:43,040 --> 00:39:46,480
is

1215
00:39:43,839 --> 00:39:48,640
in between these um

1216
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:50,640
these rows of cucurbits

1217
00:39:48,640 --> 00:39:53,440
um

1218
00:39:50,640 --> 00:39:55,760
so that that here this picture is when

1219
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:57,680
we planted a bunch of lettuce in between

1220
00:39:55,760 --> 00:40:00,480
was the procurements before they spread

1221
00:39:57,680 --> 00:40:04,079
out um so that we could kind of get two

1222
00:40:00,480 --> 00:40:06,000
different crops out of the same

1223
00:40:04,079 --> 00:40:08,839
same zone

1224
00:40:06,000 --> 00:40:10,880
and of course it gets complicated

1225
00:40:08,839 --> 00:40:12,560
uh like

1226
00:40:10,880 --> 00:40:15,119
we have you have to get the lettuce out

1227
00:40:12,560 --> 00:40:15,920
before it starts getting overwhelmed by

1228
00:40:15,119 --> 00:40:19,359
the

1229
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:23,880
um by the vines because otherwise it's

1230
00:40:19,359 --> 00:40:23,880
really a mess to walk around in there

1231
00:40:24,079 --> 00:40:29,680
our next zone is roots so roots for us

1232
00:40:28,079 --> 00:40:31,680
include

1233
00:40:29,680 --> 00:40:34,560
carrots beets

1234
00:40:31,680 --> 00:40:36,480
um turnips so a bunch of different crop

1235
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,880
families um the carrot family and the

1236
00:40:36,480 --> 00:40:40,560
raspberry family but the turnips are

1237
00:40:38,880 --> 00:40:41,280
yeah

1238
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,160
and

1239
00:40:41,280 --> 00:40:44,160
the um

1240
00:40:44,319 --> 00:40:48,160
yeah so that's that's an interesting

1241
00:40:46,160 --> 00:40:50,720
thing because the roots are basically

1242
00:40:48,160 --> 00:40:52,560
that question is basically about our

1243
00:40:50,720 --> 00:40:54,079
the way we cultivate the crops the way

1244
00:40:52,560 --> 00:40:56,640
they're grown the kind of season they

1245
00:40:54,079 --> 00:40:57,760
have rather than what family they're in

1246
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,079
um

1247
00:40:57,760 --> 00:41:02,319
so yeah that that's the way we think

1248
00:41:00,079 --> 00:41:02,319
about

1249
00:41:03,040 --> 00:41:07,040
and this this is our brazilian section

1250
00:41:04,880 --> 00:41:08,319
so it's the most full of any of our

1251
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:10,240
sections

1252
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:13,119
we fill it up every year

1253
00:41:10,240 --> 00:41:14,400
with cabbage kale broccoli

1254
00:41:13,119 --> 00:41:17,920
um

1255
00:41:14,400 --> 00:41:20,800
collards brussels sprouts

1256
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:23,599
and kohlrabi uh and so

1257
00:41:20,800 --> 00:41:25,280
but i think it's the most beautiful

1258
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:27,920
of the sections

1259
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:29,520
and again thinking about cover cropping

1260
00:41:27,920 --> 00:41:31,599
we

1261
00:41:29,520 --> 00:41:32,720
basically are able to cover crop size by

1262
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:34,880
bed so

1263
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:36,960
our kohlrabi comes out pretty early in

1264
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:40,319
the season and we're able to put in a

1265
00:41:36,960 --> 00:41:44,400
buffy cover crop um there

1266
00:41:40,319 --> 00:41:45,920
or we're able to even double crop

1267
00:41:44,400 --> 00:41:49,040
kohlraki before we don't have the same

1268
00:41:45,920 --> 00:41:49,040
black problem that

1269
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,880
yeah so uh we're able to kind of fit

1270
00:41:52,640 --> 00:41:57,520
things in and then always thinking when

1271
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:58,400
we plant our fall cover traps

1272
00:41:57,520 --> 00:42:01,680
okay

1273
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,400
it is our next craft going to need to go

1274
00:42:01,680 --> 00:42:04,160
in

1275
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,680
in this ring or

1276
00:42:04,160 --> 00:42:07,520
can it wait

1277
00:42:05,680 --> 00:42:10,240
until june

1278
00:42:07,520 --> 00:42:10,960
um and in which case we would plant rye

1279
00:42:10,240 --> 00:42:12,319
or

1280
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:14,610
something that would that would really

1281
00:42:12,319 --> 00:42:17,760
pump up the organic matter

1282
00:42:14,610 --> 00:42:17,760
[Music]

1283
00:42:18,960 --> 00:42:25,599
this is a totally messy messy picture um

1284
00:42:22,400 --> 00:42:28,000
so our our tomato section

1285
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:31,359
we also include our

1286
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,319
our beans in that section because

1287
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:34,400
um

1288
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:37,119
they kind of have a similar season we

1289
00:42:34,400 --> 00:42:38,640
want to we want to plant them after all

1290
00:42:37,119 --> 00:42:39,599
the insurance rates after the soil's

1291
00:42:38,640 --> 00:42:41,359
worked up

1292
00:42:39,599 --> 00:42:43,280
um and we plant several different

1293
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,560
successions of beans so we've been

1294
00:42:43,280 --> 00:42:46,880
figuring out

1295
00:42:44,560 --> 00:42:47,920
just kind of trial and error over the

1296
00:42:46,880 --> 00:42:50,160
years

1297
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,119
figuring out ways to

1298
00:42:50,160 --> 00:42:54,480
kind of manage the architecture i guess

1299
00:42:53,119 --> 00:42:56,640
of our section

1300
00:42:54,480 --> 00:42:59,040
so that we can harvest the tomatoes

1301
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,960
easily and the beans won't be too much

1302
00:42:59,040 --> 00:43:01,680
in the way

1303
00:43:00,960 --> 00:43:03,760
so

1304
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:05,440
yeah we've started kind of alternating

1305
00:43:03,760 --> 00:43:08,400
tomatoes and beans

1306
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,800
to just add more

1307
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:12,240
variety and more more kind of ability to

1308
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:15,119
move around

1309
00:43:12,240 --> 00:43:15,119
in that section

1310
00:43:18,000 --> 00:43:24,400
yes and then the final section is our

1311
00:43:20,240 --> 00:43:24,400
green section so our lettuce are

1312
00:43:24,839 --> 00:43:28,319
our uh

1313
00:43:26,240 --> 00:43:31,359
mustard mixes

1314
00:43:28,319 --> 00:43:34,560
um our spinach and then we also put our

1315
00:43:31,359 --> 00:43:36,240
peas in the green section again because

1316
00:43:34,560 --> 00:43:38,740
they kind of match

1317
00:43:36,240 --> 00:43:41,860
the timing of beans we

1318
00:43:38,740 --> 00:43:41,860
[Music]

1319
00:43:51,359 --> 00:43:55,920
as we need

1320
00:43:52,839 --> 00:43:57,520
to yeah that's my co-farmer also in the

1321
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,000
greens

1322
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:00,000
section

1323
00:44:02,150 --> 00:44:06,560
[Music]

1324
00:44:03,599 --> 00:44:08,800
yeah and this is just a picture of

1325
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:11,200
buckmint cover crops surrounding like a

1326
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,000
weenie parsley patch

1327
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,040
um

1328
00:44:12,000 --> 00:44:15,040
just

1329
00:44:13,040 --> 00:44:17,200
thinking about the yeah the timing of

1330
00:44:15,040 --> 00:44:19,040
cover cropping is a really interesting

1331
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,280
question that we're always

1332
00:44:19,040 --> 00:44:22,480
always working out and making sure

1333
00:44:21,280 --> 00:44:24,079
everything is

1334
00:44:22,480 --> 00:44:26,560
accessible and that

1335
00:44:24,079 --> 00:44:28,560
we can just get as much stuff growing

1336
00:44:26,560 --> 00:44:30,800
um as we can

1337
00:44:28,560 --> 00:44:33,119
as possible but um

1338
00:44:30,800 --> 00:44:36,359
without overwhelming our

1339
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:36,359
our ideals

1340
00:44:36,960 --> 00:44:40,400
yeah

1341
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,359
and i believe that is it

1342
00:44:40,400 --> 00:44:42,800
so

1343
00:44:41,359 --> 00:44:45,359
you have plenty of time for questions

1344
00:44:42,800 --> 00:44:47,920
yeah how are you breaking down

1345
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:49,599
and your cover crops doing complete

1346
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:50,560
no-till

1347
00:44:49,599 --> 00:44:52,640
building

1348
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:54,800
yes so the question is how are we

1349
00:44:52,640 --> 00:44:56,720
breaking down cover crops especially

1350
00:44:54,800 --> 00:44:58,000
when we're doing no-till

1351
00:44:56,720 --> 00:45:00,480
agriculture

1352
00:44:58,000 --> 00:45:02,319
um so

1353
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:03,760
um

1354
00:45:02,319 --> 00:45:05,440
a number of different ways we've tried a

1355
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:08,000
number of different ways so we've tried

1356
00:45:05,440 --> 00:45:11,599
just like pulling them out of the bed

1357
00:45:08,000 --> 00:45:15,119
like leading them out um which is

1358
00:45:11,599 --> 00:45:15,920
is not actually as bad as it sounds um

1359
00:45:15,119 --> 00:45:18,560
but

1360
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:19,520
it takes a lot of time um

1361
00:45:18,560 --> 00:45:21,359
the other

1362
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:24,240
big thing that i think both jordan and i

1363
00:45:21,359 --> 00:45:25,520
are trying is uh

1364
00:45:24,240 --> 00:45:27,940
silent

1365
00:45:25,520 --> 00:45:31,119
um and using silent sharks to break

1366
00:45:27,940 --> 00:45:31,119
[Music]

1367
00:45:31,359 --> 00:45:35,359
oh down yeah so

1368
00:45:33,200 --> 00:45:36,880
um

1369
00:45:35,359 --> 00:45:38,640
yeah i mean i think the way that i've

1370
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,920
done that is

1371
00:45:38,640 --> 00:45:43,599
i have a flail mower that goes on a bcs

1372
00:45:41,920 --> 00:45:46,400
and so i'll flail mow it

1373
00:45:43,599 --> 00:45:47,520
and then lay the blade the tarp down

1374
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:48,960
and

1375
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:50,160
you know we've we've talked about this

1376
00:45:48,960 --> 00:45:51,520
and i talked about this with stylish

1377
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:53,760
charts but you don't get all that much

1378
00:45:51,520 --> 00:45:54,640
residue breakdown we found that's sort

1379
00:45:53,760 --> 00:45:56,240
of how

1380
00:45:54,640 --> 00:45:57,760
the charts were sold to us i guess for

1381
00:45:56,240 --> 00:45:59,680
something new because you get a lot of

1382
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:01,200
residue breakdown but i find that's not

1383
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:02,880
so much the case it just kind of kills

1384
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:04,400
what's there and it will start to

1385
00:46:02,880 --> 00:46:06,240
decompose a little bit

1386
00:46:04,400 --> 00:46:08,560
i'm actually interested in

1387
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:10,640
possibly using clear plastic to try to

1388
00:46:08,560 --> 00:46:12,240
get more residue breakdown

1389
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:14,640
um but yeah because you don't get the

1390
00:46:12,240 --> 00:46:16,560
residue breakdown i think that like for

1391
00:46:14,640 --> 00:46:18,480
me if i want a direct seed or a paper

1392
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:20,400
pot into there i need to then like break

1393
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:22,480
that residue off or do something with it

1394
00:46:20,400 --> 00:46:23,839
after i pull the tarp off so

1395
00:46:22,480 --> 00:46:25,440
um

1396
00:46:23,839 --> 00:46:27,200
yeah we

1397
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:30,079
definitely have

1398
00:46:27,200 --> 00:46:32,720
just covered the um

1399
00:46:30,079 --> 00:46:35,119
the bed with um

1400
00:46:32,720 --> 00:46:36,319
with compost like just like kill it with

1401
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:38,160
a silent star

1402
00:46:36,319 --> 00:46:39,839
peel the cover crop and then

1403
00:46:38,160 --> 00:46:42,400
just cover the bed of the compost and

1404
00:46:39,839 --> 00:46:43,920
plant directly into that

1405
00:46:42,400 --> 00:46:45,359
and

1406
00:46:43,920 --> 00:46:46,960
yeah we don't use a paper fat

1407
00:46:45,359 --> 00:46:50,319
transmitter we just transplant by fans

1408
00:46:46,960 --> 00:46:50,319
but it works for us

1409
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:55,040
what have you found

1410
00:46:52,800 --> 00:46:56,720
for your no cell systems in direct

1411
00:46:55,040 --> 00:46:58,240
seating is that something that you find

1412
00:46:56,720 --> 00:46:59,680
that you're able to do or is that kind

1413
00:46:58,240 --> 00:47:01,280
of uh

1414
00:46:59,680 --> 00:47:03,119
do you have to transition more heavily

1415
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:06,319
into the transplant

1416
00:47:03,119 --> 00:47:09,280
yeah so my co-farmer manages the direct

1417
00:47:06,319 --> 00:47:11,119
seating and she hates using cedars she

1418
00:47:09,280 --> 00:47:13,599
just makes a burrow and direct seeds

1419
00:47:11,119 --> 00:47:16,000
with her hand into it and so we can do

1420
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:18,800
that in the no-till system no problem

1421
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:20,160
really um what we have

1422
00:47:18,800 --> 00:47:21,599
from

1423
00:47:20,160 --> 00:47:23,200
um

1424
00:47:21,599 --> 00:47:24,960
we actually found that our examination

1425
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,839
was best

1426
00:47:24,960 --> 00:47:28,160
when

1427
00:47:25,839 --> 00:47:30,240
we would make a furrow and just like the

1428
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:31,839
picture with the garlic make a furrow we

1429
00:47:30,240 --> 00:47:34,240
could see it into it and then we just

1430
00:47:31,839 --> 00:47:37,880
cover it directly with compost and that

1431
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:37,880
wasn't the best germination

1432
00:47:44,820 --> 00:47:48,640
[Music]

1433
00:47:46,480 --> 00:47:50,160
um it was really just to orient things

1434
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:52,400
more for the tractor because if you have

1435
00:47:50,160 --> 00:47:54,559
100 foot beds and turn around doing it

1436
00:47:52,400 --> 00:47:55,920
with the tractor is is terrible so it

1437
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,000
was just so i didn't have to do as many

1438
00:47:55,920 --> 00:47:59,520
turnarounds with the tractor yeah so it

1439
00:47:58,000 --> 00:48:00,800
wasn't necessarily like oh north south

1440
00:47:59,520 --> 00:48:04,240
is better it was more just because of

1441
00:48:00,800 --> 00:48:04,240
the way my fields were oriented

1442
00:48:15,599 --> 00:48:21,839
yes the question is what's the weak kill

1443
00:48:17,760 --> 00:48:23,920
like with a silent shirt

1444
00:48:21,839 --> 00:48:25,280
i mean it kills annual weeds very well i

1445
00:48:23,920 --> 00:48:27,359
think the issue is

1446
00:48:25,280 --> 00:48:29,359
typically perennials so like we both

1447
00:48:27,359 --> 00:48:31,839
have some issues with the thistles

1448
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:33,839
hollywood's and wine issues so yeah

1449
00:48:31,839 --> 00:48:35,520
perennials it does not kill perennials

1450
00:48:33,839 --> 00:48:37,119
unless you leave it in place for like an

1451
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:38,480
entire season

1452
00:48:37,119 --> 00:48:41,119
so but it will kill that very

1453
00:48:38,480 --> 00:48:42,800
effectively kills annual weeds

1454
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:45,040
the question is

1455
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:46,960
it will kill the existing growth

1456
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:48,640
but as soon as you pull it off more

1457
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:51,920
weeds in germany

1458
00:48:48,640 --> 00:48:54,000
so like i think sometimes in a tillage

1459
00:48:51,920 --> 00:48:55,440
situation people will till first and

1460
00:48:54,000 --> 00:48:57,280
then put the part down because they want

1461
00:48:55,440 --> 00:48:58,079
to like flush the leaves out

1462
00:48:57,280 --> 00:49:00,480
um

1463
00:48:58,079 --> 00:49:02,000
before they tarp because you run in the

1464
00:49:00,480 --> 00:49:03,760
situation when you kill the existing

1465
00:49:02,000 --> 00:49:04,880
heat growth but then there's a whole

1466
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:06,160
another generation that's just going to

1467
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:07,680
come off as soon as it's triggered by

1468
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:08,880
pulling off the part

1469
00:49:07,680 --> 00:49:10,640
so

1470
00:49:08,880 --> 00:49:12,880
yeah and i'll add that we

1471
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:15,200
have a big thistle problem so yeah we

1472
00:49:12,880 --> 00:49:17,280
found that our annual weed pressure is

1473
00:49:15,200 --> 00:49:19,599
not as bad in an ocean system because

1474
00:49:17,280 --> 00:49:21,200
we're using

1475
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:24,160
we're using

1476
00:49:21,200 --> 00:49:25,440
a compost as a mulch

1477
00:49:24,160 --> 00:49:28,880
but

1478
00:49:25,440 --> 00:49:31,760
our fissile problem is is hugely just

1479
00:49:28,880 --> 00:49:32,720
coming back and so we try to

1480
00:49:31,760 --> 00:49:34,800
tarp

1481
00:49:32,720 --> 00:49:37,040
kind of any part of the farm that

1482
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:37,839
doesn't have something growing on it

1483
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:39,280
um

1484
00:49:37,839 --> 00:49:41,520
in a you know

1485
00:49:39,280 --> 00:49:42,319
for like a three week chunk of time or

1486
00:49:41,520 --> 00:49:45,040
more

1487
00:49:42,319 --> 00:49:46,640
we try to put a tarp on just get those

1488
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:50,520
thistles

1489
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:50,520
stopped for a second

1490
00:49:53,330 --> 00:50:01,810
[Music]

1491
00:50:05,120 --> 00:50:08,319
[Music]

1492
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:10,400
i do use dutch white clover in other

1493
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,880
parts of my farm and that's one

1494
00:50:10,400 --> 00:50:14,640
oh sorry i do use dutch white clover in

1495
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:16,079
other parts of my farm and that's one

1496
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:18,079
that i've seen other people use in that

1497
00:50:16,079 --> 00:50:20,559
situation but i've not personally tried

1498
00:50:18,079 --> 00:50:23,040
it in my growing beds i use it in my

1499
00:50:20,559 --> 00:50:24,480
like tractor pathways like my access

1500
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:26,400
roads

1501
00:50:24,480 --> 00:50:28,079
yeah i've also never tried a living

1502
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:30,640
mulch other than once i tried some

1503
00:50:28,079 --> 00:50:32,480
clover and um

1504
00:50:30,640 --> 00:50:33,119
and a bunch of leaves germinated with it

1505
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,880
and

1506
00:50:33,119 --> 00:50:36,480
it just didn't make sense that's what i

1507
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:40,680
just wheeled it in

1508
00:50:36,480 --> 00:50:40,680
but i would love to figure that out

1509
00:50:40,800 --> 00:50:44,400
yes

1510
00:50:41,760 --> 00:50:46,880
when you guys use the tarps to

1511
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:47,839
suppress the cover crops

1512
00:50:46,880 --> 00:50:50,319
does

1513
00:50:47,839 --> 00:50:52,000
the temperature affect the effectiveness

1514
00:50:50,319 --> 00:50:55,119
of the heart

1515
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:55,119
if it's early spring

1516
00:51:02,160 --> 00:51:05,680
yeah i think there's definitely a heat

1517
00:51:03,520 --> 00:51:07,280
effect with the tarp

1518
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:08,559
that can

1519
00:51:07,280 --> 00:51:10,800
i think that might have an effect on

1520
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,400
residue breakdown potentially although

1521
00:51:10,800 --> 00:51:13,920
i'm saying i'd still be satisfied even

1522
00:51:12,400 --> 00:51:16,160
in the summer but i think the main way

1523
00:51:13,920 --> 00:51:18,400
the tarp works is by excluding light

1524
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,160
so i think in the case of the tarp it's

1525
00:51:18,400 --> 00:51:21,760
not so much that it's heating up the

1526
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:23,520
soil is that it's excluding light which

1527
00:51:21,760 --> 00:51:26,160
that's what's killing things

1528
00:51:23,520 --> 00:51:28,640
um with clear plastic it's the it's the

1529
00:51:26,160 --> 00:51:31,940
heat that is actually

1530
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:34,720
killing things and breaking down residue

1531
00:51:31,940 --> 00:51:37,200
[Music]

1532
00:51:34,720 --> 00:51:40,640
so when you're doing your craft

1533
00:51:37,200 --> 00:51:42,880
rotations um in the

1534
00:51:40,640 --> 00:51:44,319
sections that you're doing double

1535
00:51:42,880 --> 00:51:46,079
crochet

1536
00:51:44,319 --> 00:51:48,559
you're rotating

1537
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:52,000
at the end of the season right so if you

1538
00:51:48,559 --> 00:51:52,800
have all of your brackets in one section

1539
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:55,040
you know

1540
00:51:52,800 --> 00:51:57,359
like some of us have longer seasons

1541
00:51:55,040 --> 00:51:59,710
so if you're double cropping multiple

1542
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:01,040
times you're not worried about rotating

1543
00:51:59,710 --> 00:52:02,720
[Music]

1544
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:04,079
into a different section at that point

1545
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:05,839
you're so you're kind of looking at it

1546
00:52:04,079 --> 00:52:07,599
from a season perspective are you both

1547
00:52:05,839 --> 00:52:09,359
looking at it that way

1548
00:52:07,599 --> 00:52:12,079
in those sections

1549
00:52:09,359 --> 00:52:16,000
i definitely am year by year

1550
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:16,000
here and nowhere else on the farm

1551
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:19,760
yeah when the place that i'm double

1552
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:21,760
cropping i'm usually changing families

1553
00:52:19,760 --> 00:52:23,520
but my understanding is like i kind of

1554
00:52:21,760 --> 00:52:25,680
had i had this question too it's like is

1555
00:52:23,520 --> 00:52:29,119
crop rotation always between props or is

1556
00:52:25,680 --> 00:52:30,800
it just between seasons and i think um

1557
00:52:29,119 --> 00:52:33,200
i don't know maybe best best practices

1558
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:34,800
would be yes between crops but i think

1559
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:36,640
there is some leeway where like yes you

1560
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,520
could rotate like you could grow lettuce

1561
00:52:36,640 --> 00:52:39,839
twice

1562
00:52:37,520 --> 00:52:42,000
there might be reasons not to do that

1563
00:52:39,839 --> 00:52:43,200
for other reasons but like you know in

1564
00:52:42,000 --> 00:52:45,040
terms of

1565
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:46,800
an overall crop rotation i think that's

1566
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,400
mine if you grow to grow things in the

1567
00:52:46,800 --> 00:52:50,240
same

1568
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:53,119
you grow the same family in the same

1569
00:52:50,240 --> 00:52:55,440
beds same fields in the same year

1570
00:52:53,119 --> 00:52:58,000
yeah so you might do multiple crops of

1571
00:52:55,440 --> 00:52:59,520
salanova in the same bed or you do i

1572
00:52:58,000 --> 00:53:00,800
haven't done that but it's like it's

1573
00:52:59,520 --> 00:53:03,119
again like because i want to have

1574
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:05,200
flexibility

1575
00:53:03,119 --> 00:53:07,599
if i have to i try not to i try as best

1576
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,880
i can to rotate between props as i can

1577
00:53:07,599 --> 00:53:11,760
and usually i've been able to do that

1578
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:15,319
but it is something that i would do if i

1579
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:15,319
had to yeah

1580
00:53:16,079 --> 00:53:21,200
in your greenhouse when you said after

1581
00:53:18,400 --> 00:53:23,760
tomatoes when you go you bring in

1582
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:26,880
a ton of compost

1583
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:29,280
how many yards of compost in there what

1584
00:53:26,880 --> 00:53:31,440
what does a tongue mean yeah yeah so um

1585
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:34,319
it's i think it's pretty quantifiable

1586
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:36,160
it's um we usually lay about an inch

1587
00:53:34,319 --> 00:53:39,680
over the top of the soil across the bed

1588
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:41,680
surface and we do it we move with a

1589
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,040
tractor bucket and then we'll dump it

1590
00:53:41,680 --> 00:53:44,319
into it because we can't put the tractor

1591
00:53:43,040 --> 00:53:46,880
in the tunnel we dump it into the

1592
00:53:44,319 --> 00:53:48,000
wheelbarrows so we line up three wheel

1593
00:53:46,880 --> 00:53:49,040
barrels

1594
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:51,200
dump the

1595
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:52,400
compost into those three wheel barrels

1596
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,720
and i'm trying to think i have this

1597
00:53:52,400 --> 00:53:55,720
written down

1598
00:53:56,400 --> 00:54:01,280
yeah i think you're using probably three

1599
00:53:58,000 --> 00:54:02,960
to five bucket loads per day

1600
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:04,400
if i remember correctly and in general i

1601
00:54:02,960 --> 00:54:07,040
think i've quantified it but we end up

1602
00:54:04,400 --> 00:54:09,040
using about a cubic yard

1603
00:54:07,040 --> 00:54:10,800
per bed it's in general if we're doing

1604
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:12,400
that thick mulch layer so we get it

1605
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:15,119
delivered

1606
00:54:12,400 --> 00:54:18,160
you know 40 basically 40 pound loads and

1607
00:54:15,119 --> 00:54:20,160
that will cover about 40 degrees

1608
00:54:18,160 --> 00:54:22,319
yeah that's about the rate we're using

1609
00:54:20,160 --> 00:54:25,839
to get that one inch thick

1610
00:54:22,319 --> 00:54:25,839
like heavy mulch yeah

1611
00:54:27,599 --> 00:54:32,000

[Music]

1614
00:54:45,599 --> 00:54:48,559
um

1615
00:54:46,799 --> 00:54:51,280
the only answer that i know for

1616
00:54:48,559 --> 00:54:52,799
pre-wheels is just the row cover

1617
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:55,760
because it was right when you land the

1618
00:54:52,799 --> 00:54:57,280
cross you just cover it and

1619
00:54:55,760 --> 00:54:59,280
with row cover that doesn't have any

1620
00:54:57,280 --> 00:55:00,160
holes in it and that it moves the two

1621
00:54:59,280 --> 00:55:01,359
needles

1622
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:02,720
um

1623
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:04,079
i'm actually

1624
00:55:02,720 --> 00:55:04,880
trying to figure out

1625
00:55:04,079 --> 00:55:08,640
the

1626
00:55:04,880 --> 00:55:10,880
problem when we row cover um

1627
00:55:08,640 --> 00:55:12,880
uh for flea beetles and it's often on

1628
00:55:10,880 --> 00:55:15,280
brassicas that are gonna vote really

1629
00:55:12,880 --> 00:55:17,520
fast especially with that hot

1630
00:55:15,280 --> 00:55:20,480
um row cover so that's that's hard to

1631
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,960
kind of negotiate um

1632
00:55:20,480 --> 00:55:22,960
but yeah

1633
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,000
my understanding is if it's a flying

1634
00:55:25,440 --> 00:55:29,280
insect then unless you're able to

1635
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:32,160
isolate

1636
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:33,359
long distances it doesn't rotation isn't

1637
00:55:32,160 --> 00:55:34,640
going to matter for that because the

1638
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:36,160
flea bills are just going to find your

1639
00:55:34,640 --> 00:55:38,079
crop they don't necessarily overwinter

1640
00:55:36,160 --> 00:55:40,160
in the soil or if they do they'll just

1641
00:55:38,079 --> 00:55:42,400
come up and find the crop so that is

1642
00:55:40,160 --> 00:55:43,839
less of a crop rotation issue and like

1643
00:55:42,400 --> 00:55:45,440
hannah saying it's just more physical

1644
00:55:43,839 --> 00:55:47,200
exclusion and i think that's the case

1645
00:55:45,440 --> 00:55:48,559
with other pests like cucumber beetles

1646
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:50,240
they're just going to come find your

1647
00:55:48,559 --> 00:55:52,720
cucurbits it doesn't matter if you

1648
00:55:50,240 --> 00:55:52,720
rotate them

1649
00:55:52,810 --> 00:55:56,079
[Music]

1650
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,079
okay um it's not really

1651
00:55:56,079 --> 00:55:59,839
rotation related but you were talking

1652
00:55:58,079 --> 00:56:01,200
about the road cover do you have an

1653
00:55:59,839 --> 00:56:05,040
issue with it

1654
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:07,839
blowing off everybody just secure it or

1655
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:09,280
not let it rip yes so how do we secure

1656
00:56:07,839 --> 00:56:10,319
row cover

1657
00:56:09,280 --> 00:56:12,240
i

1658
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:14,880
um

1659
00:56:12,240 --> 00:56:17,040
yeah in my obsession with excluding free

1660
00:56:14,880 --> 00:56:20,240
beetles i have

1661
00:56:17,040 --> 00:56:21,440
uh gone into burying this the side of

1662
00:56:20,240 --> 00:56:22,240
the recover

1663
00:56:21,440 --> 00:56:23,599
um

1664
00:56:22,240 --> 00:56:27,520
and

1665
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,960
uh so just like continual dirt on all

1666
00:56:27,520 --> 00:56:33,040
edges of the row cover um and then the

1667
00:56:30,960 --> 00:56:34,480
problem is

1668
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:36,319
if it's a ruble or something and i'm

1669
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,200
harvesting multiple times

1670
00:56:36,319 --> 00:56:38,480
um

1671
00:56:37,200 --> 00:56:41,040
actually

1672
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:42,319
it's like putting it back down um under

1673
00:56:41,040 --> 00:56:46,240
under that

1674
00:56:42,319 --> 00:56:48,160
row of dirt um after every harvest

1675
00:56:46,240 --> 00:56:50,799
yeah the other problem with row cover

1676
00:56:48,160 --> 00:56:53,280
that i've noticed is that it it creates

1677
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:56,319
this microclimate that's really

1678
00:56:53,280 --> 00:56:58,799
kind of luscious and aphids love it and

1679
00:56:56,319 --> 00:57:01,440
they get all over the straps and that's

1680
00:56:58,799 --> 00:57:01,440
kind of gross

1681
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:06,400
and i have a question for you where do

1682
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:08,000
potatoes and sweet potatoes fit into

1683
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:10,910
your location

1684
00:57:08,000 --> 00:57:14,010
we put potatoes in their tomato section

1685
00:57:10,910 --> 00:57:14,010
[Music]

1686
00:57:22,400 --> 00:57:25,119
um one thing i also want to i don't know

1687
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:26,400
if the person's own room but i was going

1688
00:57:25,119 --> 00:57:29,119
to see about how we've done direct

1689
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:30,720
seating with no-till so it's similar to

1690
00:57:29,119 --> 00:57:32,000
what i talked about with

1691
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:33,680
the high tunnel where we're trying to

1692
00:57:32,000 --> 00:57:35,680
get enough tilt to be able to run that

1693
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:38,079
paper pot transplanter through and we

1694
00:57:35,680 --> 00:57:40,000
did have issues where you know the cedar

1695
00:57:38,079 --> 00:57:41,680
is skipping so we're pushing a seater

1696
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:44,319
through the soil it's like hitting a

1697
00:57:41,680 --> 00:57:46,319
hard hand layer

1698
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:49,040
but this year i switched to using a jam

1699
00:57:46,319 --> 00:57:50,880
seeder and it's a lot heavier and it's

1700
00:57:49,040 --> 00:57:52,720
been a lot better for no till because it

1701
00:57:50,880 --> 00:57:54,559
can just kind of plow through

1702
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,240
sections that where earthway is very

1703
00:57:54,559 --> 00:57:57,760
light will just kind of skip

1704
00:57:56,240 --> 00:57:59,920
so that's one thing i found that really

1705
00:57:57,760 --> 00:58:01,520
helps um with direct seeping into a

1706
00:57:59,920 --> 00:58:03,440
no-till situation or any kind of

1707
00:58:01,520 --> 00:58:05,599
situation where you have

1708
00:58:03,440 --> 00:58:08,960
tighter soil or more residue it's just

1709
00:58:05,599 --> 00:58:08,960
it's a more robust

1710
00:58:20,240 --> 00:58:25,520
there's probably some vendors who sell

1711
00:58:22,079 --> 00:58:25,520
that here that you get okay

1712
00:58:32,430 --> 00:58:37,839
[Applause]

1713
00:58:34,000 --> 00:58:37,839
we broadcast our cover crops

1714
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:43,280
yeah i i broadcast uh with a little like

1715
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:45,760
earthquake chest spreader and then i i

1716
00:58:43,280 --> 00:58:47,359
have a cold attacker so i generally will

1717
00:58:45,760 --> 00:58:49,599
pack that in or sometimes i'll disc it

1718
00:58:47,359 --> 00:58:50,720
in i've also tilled it in too with a

1719
00:58:49,599 --> 00:58:51,760
rototiller

1720
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,799
um

1721
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,119
but uh

1722
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:56,880
it's not i'm not wild i would would like

1723
00:58:55,119 --> 00:58:59,040
a better system because there's a lot of

1724
00:58:56,880 --> 00:59:00,480
passes over the field it'd be nice to be

1725
00:58:59,040 --> 00:59:01,920
able to do things in a single pass

1726
00:59:00,480 --> 00:59:05,640
rather than having to

1727
00:59:01,920 --> 00:59:05,640
do another pass but

1728
00:59:07,910 --> 00:59:11,020
[Music]

1729
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,960
do you guys transplant

1730
00:59:21,210 --> 00:59:24,340
[Music]

1731
00:59:31,599 --> 00:59:35,359
the okay

1732
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:36,640
is do we transplant into the residue of

1733
00:59:35,359 --> 00:59:37,520
the cover crop

1734
00:59:36,640 --> 00:59:38,960
um

1735
00:59:37,520 --> 00:59:41,599
we would only transplant into the

1736
00:59:38,960 --> 00:59:42,960
residue of a dead cover crop

1737
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:46,240
for sure

1738
00:59:42,960 --> 00:59:48,799
and we would add um we would add a

1739
00:59:46,240 --> 00:59:51,280
compost mulch over it so it wouldn't it

1740
00:59:48,799 --> 00:59:53,359
there would be a lot of tilt

1741
00:59:51,280 --> 00:59:55,920
of that compost um

1742
00:59:53,359 --> 00:59:58,079
as we as we transplanted so it wouldn't

1743
00:59:55,920 --> 01:00:01,480
feel like

1744
00:59:58,079 --> 01:00:01,480
very residue

1745
01:00:04,799 --> 01:00:08,000
before i plant because generally i'm not

1746
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,359
using cover crops in those short beds

1747
01:00:08,000 --> 01:00:10,640
although i'm kind of moving in that

1748
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:11,920
direction and i have to do similar

1749
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:14,079
things to what hannah's doing like

1750
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:17,079
parking it

1751
01:00:14,079 --> 01:00:17,079
um

1752
01:00:28,319 --> 01:00:32,720
yeah so the question is how do we get

1753
01:00:31,040 --> 01:00:35,040
like brassicas like brussels sprouts or

1754
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:37,119
stuff that has heavier salt stocks out

1755
01:00:35,040 --> 01:00:38,160
of the soil if we're not tilling it in

1756
01:00:37,119 --> 01:00:39,359
um

1757
01:00:38,160 --> 01:00:41,119
and

1758
01:00:39,359 --> 01:00:45,440
we have tried multiple things we've

1759
01:00:41,119 --> 01:00:46,240
tried just pulling the whole thing up

1760
01:00:45,440 --> 01:00:48,400
and

1761
01:00:46,240 --> 01:00:53,000
it's it's awkward because it's like

1762
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:53,000
frozen in the fall by the time

1763
01:00:58,160 --> 01:01:01,920
hello hello

1764
01:01:00,000 --> 01:01:03,920
uh by the time we're pulling the

1765
01:01:01,920 --> 01:01:06,720
nebraska's out it's like the soil is

1766
01:01:03,920 --> 01:01:09,760
like frozen and it's really challenging

1767
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,720
so we we switched to just chopping them

1768
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:14,720
off at the soil level um and leaving

1769
01:01:12,720 --> 01:01:17,440
leaving that root system in there to

1770
01:01:14,720 --> 01:01:21,119
kind of rot and because we're rotating i

1771
01:01:17,440 --> 01:01:23,040
think uh our roots come next after after

1772
01:01:21,119 --> 01:01:25,520
our breast and so we're direct seeding

1773
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:29,720
so we just take furrows and

1774
01:01:25,520 --> 01:01:29,720
if it has worked out
