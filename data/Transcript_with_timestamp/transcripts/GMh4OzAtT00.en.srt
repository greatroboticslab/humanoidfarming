1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:06,720
so you currently have or want to have

2
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:10,800
raspberries that is a really really good

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:13,240
idea they are by far my favorite fruit

4
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,080
the Tangy sweetness and the popping

5
00:00:13,240 --> 00:00:18,760
sensation of all the individual little

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:21,119
little loes inside the berry just just

7
00:00:18,760 --> 00:00:23,519
does it for me they they seriously are

8
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,199
my favorite fruit

9
00:00:23,519 --> 00:00:28,400
but they can be quite tricky to grow

10
00:00:26,199 --> 00:00:31,359
especially if you do the right thing at

11
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,640
the wrong time so what does that mean

12
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:36,440
for growing your own raspberries at home

13
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:40,320
well it means there are a few things

14
00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:43,200
that you have to know about this plant

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:46,079
once you know these things it'll forever

16
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:48,239
set you up for big harvests moving

17
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:50,520
forward and to make sure that you always

18
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:53,039
do the right thing at the right time of

19
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:55,440
the year so without wasting any more

20
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:57,440
time let's take a look at how

21
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:59,399
raspberries grow what you need to know

22
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:02,640
about them so that you can make

23
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:07,159
decisions to maximize your harvests and

24
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,159
the ultimate growth of this tree moving

25
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,080
forward before we get into some of the

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:17,159
content I just want to thank all of my

many different ways that you can support

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:47,520
my work and this channel moving forward

41
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:50,040
but let's move into raspberries

42
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:52,200
raspberries and more

43
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,240
raspberries so to not make this video

44
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,920
too long what I'm going to do is I'm

45
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:58,360
going to very briefly touch on the most

46
00:01:56,920 --> 00:02:00,159
important thing that you know about

47
00:01:58,360 --> 00:02:03,719
raspberries and then I'm going to send

48
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:06,039
you off to my Blackberry video why

49
00:02:03,719 --> 00:02:08,720
because in my Blackberry video I talk in

50
00:02:06,039 --> 00:02:11,080
detail about this specific topic which

51
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,560
is primocanes and

52
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:15,680
floricanes raspberries are very similar

53
00:02:13,560 --> 00:02:17,760
to blackberries in that they grow on

54
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:19,879
primocanes and floricanes and you need

55
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:22,640
to know the difference between them

56
00:02:19,879 --> 00:02:25,040
because ultimately how you treat and

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,599
handle each one determines what's going

58
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,080
to happen with your your Harvest and

59
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:30,920
your crops so there's a detailed

60
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:32,879
explanation on the Blackberry video I've

61
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:34,840
put the link in the description below

62
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,400
I've tagged it somewhere up here that

63
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:41,280
you can watch as well but as a very

64
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,599
quick summary Primo canes are the green

65
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,080
new canes that come out of the ground in

66
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,760
early spring I'm not going to touch on

67
00:02:47,080 --> 00:02:52,280
fruit bearing quite yet cuz I just want

68
00:02:48,760 --> 00:02:55,480
to stick to Canes your flurry canes are

69
00:02:52,280 --> 00:02:58,840
last year's canes that have overwintered

70
00:02:55,480 --> 00:03:01,519
and are now putting on side shoots

71
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:03,519
primocanes are the first ones to come up

72
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:06,799
and will continue to grow vertically

73
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:09,159
they will not grow horizontally

74
00:03:06,799 --> 00:03:11,920
floricanes stop growing horiz

75
00:03:09,159 --> 00:03:15,000
horizontally and they start growing

76
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:17,519
vertically that is a very important

77
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:20,840
differentiator between the two you will

78
00:03:17,519 --> 00:03:23,799
also see in the stems the key Telltale

79
00:03:20,840 --> 00:03:27,440
sign between primocanes and floricanes

80
00:03:23,799 --> 00:03:30,879
are the color of the stems floricanes

81
00:03:27,440 --> 00:03:33,920
second year old growth is gray and brown

82
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:37,319
and brittle it's also got flakiness on

83
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,120
the back your primocanes this year's

84
00:03:37,319 --> 00:03:43,080
growth that has come out in Spring will

85
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:45,319
be green and nice and thick and tender

86
00:03:43,080 --> 00:03:48,480
and towards the end of the season we go

87
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,599
a a light brown color your floricanes

88
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,040
over time will start silvering so that

89
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:56,200
is ultimately how you tell the

90
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:57,439
difference between them now why is this

91
00:03:56,200 --> 00:04:00,079
so

92
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:02,360
important because

93
00:04:00,079 --> 00:04:04,079
depending on the variety you have and

94
00:04:02,360 --> 00:04:06,799
now we moving into the next chapter

95
00:04:04,079 --> 00:04:10,519
which is you need to know the variety of

96
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:12,799
raspberry or Blackberry that you have

97
00:04:10,519 --> 00:04:14,360
because that is going to determine how

98
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:18,600
you treat your

99
00:04:14,360 --> 00:04:22,040
plant what you get is three types of

100
00:04:18,600 --> 00:04:24,400
raspberries you get Summer bearing

101
00:04:22,040 --> 00:04:26,759
Autumn bearing and

102
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:29,240
everbearing now in blackberries you

103
00:04:26,759 --> 00:04:31,960
mostly get everbearing which I'll

104
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:34,080
explain to to in a bit but in essence

105
00:04:31,960 --> 00:04:36,479
summer bearing raspberries are the ones

106
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,320
that bear the fruit on the Floric canes

107
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:41,199
of the previous year and they can come

108
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:44,199
in as early as late spring into early

109
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:46,960
summer but then what happens is the new

110
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:50,440
growth comes up and it's sets those

111
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:53,759
canes for the following year then you

112
00:04:50,440 --> 00:04:55,800
have Autumn bearing raspberries Autumn

113
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:58,880
bearing ones are the ones that you can

114
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,800
mow down cut down weed eat down as much

115
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:03,520
as you want you can cut the whole plant

116
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:04,960
to the ground and in Spring the all the

117
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
shoots are going to come up all the

118
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,880
canes and at the end of summer towards

119
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:12,360
Autumn they're going to give you one

120
00:05:09,880 --> 00:05:15,120
huge flush of raspberries but you're not

121
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,800
going to get them in early spring or

122
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:21,319
early sorry late spring or early summer

123
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,520
then what you get is this one in front

124
00:05:21,319 --> 00:05:26,000
of me which is the Heritage variety

125
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,440
which is by far around the world the

126
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:31,840
most common raspberry variety and this

127
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:35,120
is an everbearing variety everbearing

128
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:38,039
meaning you keep both canes you keep

129
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:41,199
your Primo canes from this year and you

130
00:05:38,039 --> 00:05:44,520
keep your Flor canes from last year on

131
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:46,880
everbearing raspberries like this one

132
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:49,639
you'll see on the picture over here this

133
00:05:46,880 --> 00:05:51,759
is a florane the plant looks worse for

134
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:54,280
where because we are in Autumn and we

135
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,880
are now getting below zero nighttime

136
00:05:54,280 --> 00:05:59,840
temperatures so it's starting to lose

137
00:05:56,880 --> 00:06:02,000
its leaves but what this is showing you

138
00:05:59,840 --> 00:06:04,560
is there's a strong cane That's growing

139
00:06:02,000 --> 00:06:07,800
and on the tip of the cane even over

140
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:10,759
here there are flowers growing up here

141
00:06:07,800 --> 00:06:13,919
all over the place on everbearing

142
00:06:10,759 --> 00:06:16,680
raspberries the plant will grow and you

143
00:06:13,919 --> 00:06:20,840
will find that you get a harvest of

144
00:06:16,680 --> 00:06:23,639
raspberries on the growing tips of the

145
00:06:20,840 --> 00:06:27,240
primocanes that is very important to

146
00:06:23,639 --> 00:06:29,919
know then what happens is the following

147
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:32,120
year what you will get is on that

148
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,479
primocane that produced on the tip the

149
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:37,120
one year is now going to produce lateral

150
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:39,680
shoots the next year and on the lateral

151
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,639
shoots on the ends of those you are

152
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:44,560
going to get plasters of raspberries so

153
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,759
you can start to understand now that if

154
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:51,639
you P the wrong cane at the wrong time

155
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:54,759
you eliminating a harvest all together

156
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:56,280
so your your Floric canes which is your

157
00:06:54,759 --> 00:06:58,479
seconde growth which is going to give

158
00:06:56,280 --> 00:07:02,400
you the lateral shoots they're going to

159
00:06:58,479 --> 00:07:05,039
give you fruit late spring early summer

160
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:07,120
because they are already established so

161
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:10,120
that's how you get that nice

162
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,840
early succulent fruit early on in the

163
00:07:10,120 --> 00:07:15,199
season which you don't get a lot of your

164
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:17,080
other berries then what happens is the

165
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:18,759
your floranes will start to go a little

166
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:21,840
bit dormant you can see these are all

167
00:07:18,759 --> 00:07:25,120
pretty much dead and your floranes are

168
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:27,199
going to take over and they towards the

169
00:07:25,120 --> 00:07:29,800
end of the growing season which is now

170
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:32,560
for us which is autumnn are going to

171
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,360
just explode with berries on the growing

172
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:38,319
tips of the canes that is what gives you

173
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:41,560
your Autumn late summer autumn berry

174
00:07:38,319 --> 00:07:44,520
harvest so you can see how having both

175
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:47,039
canes present gives you berries

176
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,440
throughout the season now it's important

177
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,560
to note that the Heritage variety which

178
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,639
is the everbearing variety will give you

179
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:59,080
smaller yields more often throughout the

180
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:00,879
year whereas if you look at a summer

181
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:02,960
bearing or an Autumn bearing they're

182
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,599
going to give you a lot of berries in

183
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:07,479
one go so it's all up to you as to the

184
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:10,000
preferences you want you might want to

185
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,800
get a summer bearing an Autumn bearing

186
00:08:10,000 --> 00:08:13,759
and an everbearing variety so that you

187
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,360
have a huge amount of berries throughout

188
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:20,360
the year that is completely up to you

189
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:23,240
that brings me into the next chapter

190
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:26,319
which is what do we do with pruning to

191
00:08:23,240 --> 00:08:28,199
make sure we don't end up messing around

192
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:31,280
with the wrong canes at the wrong

193
00:08:28,199 --> 00:08:33,919
time well first of all go back to

194
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,680
chapter one which is what are primocanes

195
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:38,560
and floricanes how do you tell the

196
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:41,360
difference between the silvering and the

197
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,479
brown the first year and second year and

198
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,760
once you can identify the differences

199
00:08:43,479 --> 00:08:49,839
between the bark when the tree is

200
00:08:45,760 --> 00:08:51,959
dormant so not tree sorry the bush is

201
00:08:49,839 --> 00:08:53,240
dormant it's lost all of its leaves

202
00:08:51,959 --> 00:08:56,040
you're just going to have a whole bunch

203
00:08:53,240 --> 00:08:58,680
of canes and what will happen is your

204
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:03,279
Floric canes second year growth would

205
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:06,000
already be oh Thorns very brittle and

206
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,000
this is just snapping off and it's dead

207
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:12,160
wood so your floricanes are going to be

208
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:14,720
quite brittle already so those you are

209
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:16,880
going to remove completely all of your

210
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:19,000
seconde growth which is silver silver

211
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:21,279
growth should have died off but if you

212
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:24,000
have a whole bunch of growth on it it's

213
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:26,440
okay it would not be doing much in the

214
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:30,399
third year in any case so all your

215
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:33,519
silver branches with flaking bark

216
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:35,720
they come out during winter all of your

217
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:37,959
primocanes which is this year's growth

218
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,040
which are going to be next year's flurry

219
00:09:37,959 --> 00:09:44,320
canes those you want to select now you

220
00:09:42,040 --> 00:09:46,600
need to decide where you are growing

221
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:50,560
these if you have them in a pot like I

222
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:53,160
do then you want to have no more than

223
00:09:50,560 --> 00:09:55,360
five strong

224
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:57,320
primocanes because if you have more than

225
00:09:55,360 --> 00:10:00,440
that the plant is going to become too

226
00:09:57,320 --> 00:10:01,839
weak and you only want the thick strong

227
00:10:00,440 --> 00:10:03,640
ones and I'll show you the difference

228
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,480
between thick ones and weak ones down at

229
00:10:03,640 --> 00:10:07,880
the bottom here we want your strong ones

230
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:09,399
because they're going to continue to

231
00:10:07,880 --> 00:10:12,240
grow and they're going to support a lot

232
00:10:09,399 --> 00:10:15,560
of lateral growth and berries you don't

233
00:10:12,240 --> 00:10:17,680
want these spindly little sticks to to

234
00:10:15,560 --> 00:10:20,800
be your foundation for next year's

235
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:22,800
growth you don't want to reduce them to

236
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:24,920
less if you absolutely have to you can

237
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:27,560
probably go three so between three and

238
00:10:24,920 --> 00:10:30,880
five but I would try and stick to five

239
00:10:27,560 --> 00:10:33,320
so that you get a good har Harvest then

240
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:37,839
what you do is put your steaks in like

241
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:39,760
this and here are 1 2 3 4 and here's the

242
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:42,880
fifth one five so these are the staks

243
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,200
that I use and you just simply take this

244
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:48,240
Branch over here which is a

245
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:50,760
primocane and just fix it to it so that

246
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,720
you got a nice open V shape you stake

247
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:54,680
them up in in the winter so that next

248
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:56,360
year's spring when your Floric hands are

249
00:10:54,680 --> 00:10:58,680
going to put on lateral growth and start

250
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:00,480
putting berries on and get heavier

251
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:03,519
they're not going to fall over the

252
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:06,760
branches or the canes won't snap they

253
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:09,160
they're quite elastic so if they do fall

254
00:11:06,760 --> 00:11:12,800
over it's okay you're just going to find

255
00:11:09,160 --> 00:11:15,279
that the the fruit spoils pretty quickly

256
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,639
so now that we know primocanes Flur

257
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:21,399
canes we know varieties to look out for

258
00:11:18,639 --> 00:11:25,240
and now we know pruning what else do we

259
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:28,639
need to know well it all comes down to

260
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:29,800
feeding and fertilizing and watering now

261
00:11:28,639 --> 00:11:32,839
what I have found

262
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:34,880
with raspberries is that they generally

263
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:38,240
don't require a lot of care and

264
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:41,680
attention the only thing they do need a

265
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,920
really close eye on is watering these

266
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:47,160
beautiful big raspberry leaves take in a

267
00:11:44,920 --> 00:11:50,279
lot of moisture so you need to make sure

268
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:53,120
that your moisture level in the soil is

269
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,839
always at optimal the tree will talk to

270
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,519
you so the leaves will droop you might

271
00:11:55,839 --> 00:12:00,160
even get some burn on the outside where

272
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:02,720
they get really crispy but your tree or

273
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:05,279
your bush will talk to you so listen to

274
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:08,200
it also to be able to put on a lot of

275
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:11,160
berries that are very moisture dense

276
00:12:08,200 --> 00:12:13,240
berries it needs a lot of moisture so

277
00:12:11,160 --> 00:12:15,320
with raspberries you don't want them to

278
00:12:13,240 --> 00:12:17,360
be water logged cuz they don't like

279
00:12:15,320 --> 00:12:21,519
water logged but you also need to make

280
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:23,880
sure they have enough water so soil is

281
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:26,560
very important with raspberries you want

282
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:28,360
a relatively free draining but not very

283
00:12:26,560 --> 00:12:29,920
free draining that the water just soaks

284
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:32,160
through so you have to have a lot of

285
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:35,360
organic matter that can hold on to

286
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:37,720
moisture but you don't want a lot of

287
00:12:35,360 --> 00:12:39,920
clay or things that are going to hold on

288
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:42,880
to moisture for a long time so that you

289
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:45,440
end up getting things like root rot

290
00:12:42,880 --> 00:12:47,920
fertilizing I've done a a video that I

291
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:50,279
can show you which is based on Folia

292
00:12:47,920 --> 00:12:52,000
feeding I only Folia Feed The

293
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:54,639
Raspberries I don't give them anything

294
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,720
in the pot because of the the surface

295
00:12:54,639 --> 00:13:00,199
area of the leaves Folia feeding Works

296
00:12:57,720 --> 00:13:02,720
incredibly well for them so that's

297
00:13:00,199 --> 00:13:04,320
that's all that I do and besides that

298
00:13:02,720 --> 00:13:07,760
make sure that they're in a Sunny Spot

299
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:10,800
this has Sun all day whole day and it's

300
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:13,320
a very happy plant besides all the dying

301
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,839
off leaves because it's going into

302
00:13:13,320 --> 00:13:19,240
dorcy and that is in essence in a very

303
00:13:16,839 --> 00:13:21,880
quick summary everything you briefly

304
00:13:19,240 --> 00:13:24,399
need to know about raspberries I am

305
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,639
going to do a dedicated pruning video in

306
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:28,760
a couple of months time when the bush is

307
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:30,360
completely dead so that we can go into

308
00:13:28,760 --> 00:13:32,800
detail and I'm going to talk you through

309
00:13:30,360 --> 00:13:35,040
every single cut why I've done what so

310
00:13:32,800 --> 00:13:37,320
you can better understand how to prune

311
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:39,519
your raspberries but for now the

312
00:13:37,320 --> 00:13:43,000
foundation is there please do go and

313
00:13:39,519 --> 00:13:44,880
