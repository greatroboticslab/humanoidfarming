2
00:00:05,569 --> 00:00:10,620
I'm saman Amira farming here in Weldon

3
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:13,740
West Otago with my wife Penny and three

4
00:00:10,620 --> 00:00:16,080
children and we're farming 565 hectare

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:17,100
shaking beef property we're looking at a

6
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,800
wandering block here

7
00:00:17,100 --> 00:00:21,990
we were wondering Frisian Bulls on Fatih

8
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:23,400
beat and I just looked at the way we're

9
00:00:21,990 --> 00:00:25,500
grazing them really so that's what we're

10
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:27,330
here for today with the one to the

11
00:00:25,500 --> 00:00:28,740
waders we really have to carry some feed

12
00:00:27,330 --> 00:00:31,349
through from the summer into the winter

13
00:00:28,740 --> 00:00:33,600
to be able to to get through and you

14
00:00:31,349 --> 00:00:35,040
know product great and kale and winter

15
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:36,540
brassicas are a good good option just to

16
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:38,430
carry some quality right through and

17
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,140
especially for to beat with cattle we're

18
00:00:38,430 --> 00:00:41,910
taking some good quality feed that they

19
00:00:40,140 --> 00:00:45,510
can grow right through into October on

20
00:00:41,910 --> 00:00:48,480
so it's been a real winner yeah Palmer

21
00:00:45,510 --> 00:00:50,640
Hawk catchment project was started up

22
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,680
about three years ago and it's basically

23
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
a group of farmers all farmers sheep and

24
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:56,820
beef dairy in forestry and everybody all

25
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,789
got together and decided that we needed

26
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:01,320
to improve the polymer Hakka River

27
00:00:59,789 --> 00:01:02,940
because it was labeled by the taga

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:04,739
Regional Council was the West River and

29
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:06,060
Otago so we thought well that's not

30
00:01:04,739 --> 00:01:08,850
really good enough so we got together

31
00:01:06,060 --> 00:01:12,150
and thought how we're gonna go about

32
00:01:08,850 --> 00:01:13,409
improving it so we decided the best way

33
00:01:12,150 --> 00:01:15,540
was to see what the problem was with a

34
00:01:13,409 --> 00:01:17,280
lot of water testing and here so the

35
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:18,869
group started off tasting a lot of

36
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,090
trouble trees all the trouble trees the

37
00:01:18,869 --> 00:01:22,680
main river as well and saw where the

38
00:01:21,090 --> 00:01:24,030
problem was and found out that it wasn't

39
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,490
actually just a diri problem and it was

40
00:01:24,030 --> 00:01:27,990
pretty much catchment wide so and that

41
00:01:26,490 --> 00:01:30,210
was when we started doing some on-farm

42
00:01:27,990 --> 00:01:31,500
water testing and here maybe being a

43
00:01:30,210 --> 00:01:32,880
shape and be far more thorough it's not

44
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:35,040
my problem but when we started testing

45
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:36,360
on this place we found out that yeah

46
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:37,799
there was water quality issues here

47
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:39,119
might be different to the dairy industry

48
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:41,299
beware it was more sediment and

49
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:43,380
phosphorous but so that's why we've

50
00:01:41,299 --> 00:01:44,549
needed to focus a bit more on winter

51
00:01:43,380 --> 00:01:45,659
crops because that seems to be a Wikus

52
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,899
length with women we've got the best of

53
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,119
oil what we're doing is changing the way

54
00:01:48,899 --> 00:01:52,380
we graze paddocks making sure we don't

55
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:53,759
let anything anywhere near any water

56
00:01:52,380 --> 00:01:56,490
ways and when grazing paddocks from the

57
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,020
top down so that we can you know stop

58
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:00,119
the sediment ending up in the waterways

59
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:01,950
so grazing down the hill from top to

60
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,439
bottom where around what we're doing is

61
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:05,969
when the stock loosening up any soil and

62
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:07,980
there's a rainfall event the sediment

63
00:02:05,969 --> 00:02:09,480
will come down the hill through the

64
00:02:07,980 --> 00:02:11,460
break where it's been eaten through the

65
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:13,110
crop and then there'll be a grass buffer

66
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:15,330
before the waterway or the drain or the

67
00:02:13,110 --> 00:02:16,680
critical source area but so the oval

68
00:02:15,330 --> 00:02:18,150
cinnamon will get trapped before it gets

69
00:02:16,680 --> 00:02:20,730
under the waterway so that's the that's

70
00:02:18,150 --> 00:02:23,250
the crux of the grazing management with

71
00:02:20,730 --> 00:02:24,840
the last breakers you're coming into the

72
00:02:23,250 --> 00:02:26,730
wrapping up grazing the paddock with

73
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:28,620
your mob um you want to have a good

74
00:02:26,730 --> 00:02:31,350
buffer zone of grass on a flat area

75
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:33,150
probably least 2 to 3 meters and on a

76
00:02:31,350 --> 00:02:34,590
steep area maybe anything up to 20

77
00:02:33,150 --> 00:02:36,840
meters and so the further back you go

78
00:02:34,590 --> 00:02:40,140
the better but if your grazing late last

79
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,550
that last break an enjoy day preferably

80
00:02:40,140 --> 00:02:42,210
or a dry couple of days so that there's

81
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,380
no seiderman

82
00:02:42,210 --> 00:02:45,390
loss that's going to end up in the

83
00:02:43,380 --> 00:02:47,790
waterway here when we're grazing the

84
00:02:45,390 --> 00:02:49,920
paddocks you know top to bottom now

85
00:02:47,790 --> 00:02:51,090
we're seeing it when we're coming down

86
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:52,920
the hill worm there's a rainfall event

87
00:02:51,090 --> 00:02:54,810
the sediments actually flying through

88
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:56,840
the crop that's been grazed under the

89
00:02:54,810 --> 00:02:58,890
leaft area that hasn't been grazed and

90
00:02:56,840 --> 00:03:00,840
it stops there it's not even getting

91
00:02:58,890 --> 00:03:03,060
into the grassed area so that's showing

92
00:03:00,840 --> 00:03:04,320
us that it really does work yes I think

93
00:03:03,060 --> 00:03:06,060
it's something that every farmer should

94
00:03:04,320 --> 00:03:07,500
have docked initially especially with

95
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:10,140
cattle that's a no-brainer just to do

96
00:03:07,500 --> 00:03:11,310
straightaway that there's you know real

97
00:03:10,140 --> 00:03:12,600
gains to be made with stopping that

98
00:03:11,310 --> 00:03:14,850
scene when there's a lot of storm has

99
00:03:12,600 --> 00:03:16,320
been shown to be moving with cattle

100
00:03:14,850 --> 00:03:17,820
grazing on when the crops with it all

101
00:03:16,320 --> 00:03:19,530
that beer soil we're really vulnerable

102
00:03:17,820 --> 00:03:21,600
in the winter so yeah you've just got to

103
00:03:19,530 --> 00:03:23,550
get on and do it it's it's just stopping

104
00:03:21,600 --> 00:03:25,290
that sediment right where it's where it

105
00:03:23,550 --> 00:03:27,480
started rather than waiting for it to

106
00:03:25,290 --> 00:03:28,980
come downstream that's been reasonably

107
00:03:27,480 --> 00:03:30,239
easy it's just a change of mine see it

108
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,800
really where you're grazing them and

109
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:32,760
you've got something else to think about

110
00:03:31,800 --> 00:03:34,890
you're not just thinking about water

111
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:36,540
troughs or we put them on the only

112
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,130
easiest gauge udders to get to it's a

113
00:03:36,540 --> 00:03:39,600
matter of you know thinking about it a

114
00:03:38,130 --> 00:03:40,920
year in advance and planning making sure

115
00:03:39,600 --> 00:03:42,540
you've got water in the right place and

116
00:03:40,920 --> 00:03:44,430
maybe putting up a couple of extra

117
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:47,720
electric fences to make sure that you've

118
00:03:44,430 --> 00:03:47,720
can do it properly

119
00:03:51,480 --> 00:03:57,000
