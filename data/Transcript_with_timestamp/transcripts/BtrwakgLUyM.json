  "text": "in many parts of ghana especially in rural areas having access to electricity is a big challenge some rural communities still live in the dark today making it difficult for students to study at night among others however it gets exciting to know there are people who are working hard behind scenes to help bridge this gap meet mustafa a young onion who is making electrical streetlights with renewable energy and recycled materials hi my name is mustafa and i build speedlite using renewable in it let me show you how so for this build we have some solar panels we have some pvc pipes we have some led lights and then of course some few electronics and then lithium ion batteries you also need some tools as well some of the two that might come in handy are a glue gun you need this plier and then you also need a blade for cutting and finally you need a pcb board to assemble all your electronics components so let's get started you first of all have to fix all your led lights on the pcb board this way now this particular one is a 24 volt led which is more brighter but you can make a much lower one which can run on very small power like 12 volts or 6 volt for instance i have a 12 volt led [Music] all right this this one is a 12 volt led it is powered by a 12 volt lithium ion battery and we have [Music] this circuit which automatically switches the leds on and off during the day time and nighttime respectively these lithium ion batteries are actually recovering these old laptop batteries which are referred to as condemned by this in the market a lot of people don't really know that they are still usable even if even after not being able to power the laptop so i'm going to break this off and then remove them and test their voltages one of this voltage newly manufactured is around 3.7 volts but after using it in a laptop for a while there will be a voltage drop usually these voltage drops are not too high that they cannot power anything so let's go [Music] so now we have finally removed the lithium ion itself so what we go on to test the voltages to see whether they are still working with our volt meter or the multimeter we set it up to the dc voltage over here now we expect to get around 3.5 to below somewhere 2.8 2.5 this is around 3.6 volts and earlier so this one has very small voltage drop so we can use it let's start by assembling the star for the units and now that's it you're almost done with your split legs now with the help of the glue gun you heat it up to the required temperature to load it apply some here after application you stick it up here this one hold it in position secondly [Music] you pick your plastic bottles and you fix it in this room [Music] [Music] after you are done you wire up the circuit of the bulb first inside the plastic bowl or you can also put this in position apply some glue around it for you to stick first before you put this inside now after you connect it up you cut out these pieces of wire we joined from these two wires over here and then connected to the led bulbs i'm holding right now so at the end you connect the solar panel to another model charging i first of all design this model on the breadboard first to test how efficiently it will charge my lithium-ion batteries for me i've already developed the circuit and very soon i'll bring the pcb out now when you are done you remove it and also solder them on top of a pcb board this way now the final part you now connect the solar panel to the charging unit so the solar panel provides power through the charging units the charging unit will charge the lithium ion batteries now the lithium ion battery also discharges power through the switch then the switch also control the switching on and off of the light and you are done with the street light mustafa has deployed some of his works and communities in the northern part of ghana reach out to him in case you want to support his work [Music]",
