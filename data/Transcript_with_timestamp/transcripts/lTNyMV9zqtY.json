  "text": "what do all of these things have in common protein today I want to talk to you guys about how you can grow protein in your garden [Music] hey friends it's Jen at the sunshine farm this year I am planting a lot of new varieties and one thing I'm really trying to jump into is planting protein so things like beans and lentils and peas and soy even quinoa and spinach have a lot of protein so I'm planting all of these things this year I'm sure many of them won't do very well but I'm excited for the future that all of these things will mean whether it's making things like homemade soy milk or grains like quinoa and amaranth I'm even trying rice this year even potatoes are packed with protein so I'm really excited about all these things we're growing because I think there's just such a common misconception that if your plant-based or if you're vegan or vegetarian that you need to get protein we actually as Americans get a whole lot more protein than we really need and Chris and I have never had an issue with protein but nonetheless I really want to show you guys how you can actually get a lot of really nutritious plant-based protein in the garden and I'm excited to share this with you so let's just talk about a few of the things we're growing this year I'm going to show you at the end planting one of these things in the garden today and I also have some little seedlings coming up right now that I'm really looking forward to and I'll show you guys those as well so let's go ahead and get started so what proteins are we planning on growing in the garden the first is peas and lentils these guys are in the same family we have some door snow peas and I already planted these guys just a couple weeks ago and I'm just waiting for them to come on up we're also doing lentils and so we're doing two different kinds of lentils Spanish Brown and French green and these guys are heirloom seeds they do better in cooler climates we actually should have some success growing them here because our summers don't get all that hot but we're gonna see it's totally a trial year with lentils and if they don't grow well then maybe I'll just have to barter lentils for things like soy from somebody so many across the country so lentils are great source of protein lentils make an amazing base for a soup I'm really looking forward to this and I'm excited to try all sorts of different ways to cook and prepare lentils a couple different grains that were growing that have protein in them and I believe rice does as well but I didn't grab that one from my seat collection so we are growing amaranth this year and we're also growing quinoa these two crops you generally have to go a fair amount of in order to actually get a decent harvest but I hope eventually that we can really just expand our garden space that we can do that that we can plant tons of quinoa and tons of amaranth and really have enough grains for for Chris and I and future kiddos that might join the family we have peas so far we have lentils Lee of amaranth and we have quinoa and an even growing rice let's talk about a couple more things that I'm growing things that are packed with protein and you probably know where I'm going with this one beans beans are a great source of protein and super good for you a lot of people think that beans can be hard in the digestive system there's actually a way that you can do you can sprout legumes before cooking them or preparing them for a meal and they're much easier on the digestive system that way we're also doing soybean soy bean has a bad rap kind of like potatoes right because they're just thought of as lacking a lot of nutrition I think a lot of this isn't from the soy itself but actually the way we grow it here in the u.s. we tend to grow GMO soy bean in organically mass production and we're growing things varieties that are not matching the way the crop was initially designed so I'm really excited because I'm growing soybeans here heirloom organic soybeans and I think they're going to be really different in terms of how they affect our health and just the amount of nutrients in those soy because if you think about it plants absorb nutrients from the soil so if you are filling your soil with a lot of nutrients and you're treating your soil well those plans are going to be much healthier and packed with a lot more nutrients so you're going to see a big difference in terms the tofu that you might by the store or tofu that you make at home with homegrown soybean now on top of the black beans and the soybean we're also growing all different kinds of beans this one right here is scarlet Ember it's a pull runner bean and it climbs as it grows and it's just beautiful so you can eat it as green beans or you can let the pods dry out and you can cook up the beans later a couple more fun things to share with you guys spinach spinach is a great source of protein and iron and all sorts of wonderful things I just direct seeded some spinach a few days ago so hoping it comes up soon it can be a tricky crop to grow because it likes cool weather and so if your spring jumps to summer really quick you can have a hard time with spinach but there's actually a variety of spinach called Asian spinach that can handle warmer temperatures so if you're looking for the goodness of spinach but you don't have the cool weather and you don't have a long enough spring or fall try Asian spinach maybe it works for you guys and the last thing I'm so excited about peanuts now we have two different peanuts we're trying out this year and peanuts are traditionally thought of as a southern crop because they really like heat but here in New York we have a company's called fruition seeds that works to adapt crops to the northern climate and really test things out in the northern climate to make sure that they work before selling them to consumers so these are two varieties that I got ahold of from that wonderful company and I'm really excited to grow them these are super simple because you just direct sow them in the ground and then actually at the end of the season you pull them up and the peanuts are growing all along the roots just like potatoes would so those are a few things that were growing this year in terms of protein and I'm really really excited about it mostly because there's so many different kinds of things and a lot of these things I don't traditionally seen grown in backyard gardens so I'm going to just show you guys this one green that we are growing that I'm really excited about okay guys so over here our DIY grow shelves are very empty right now because most of the plants are outside but I do have some starts in here that are just coming up see these guys right here that is quinoa and then over here we got some rice look at that little baby rice I also got some a sesame Chia and rosemary that hasn't quite come up yet the other thing I wanted to show you guys is this right here might not look like a lot but it's a start this was the soy that I saved last year from our soy crop and I'm actually going to be going and making some soy milk following a recipe from one of my favorite cookbooks called the vegan pantry it's an amazing cookbook it's really simple recipes all about different staples you can make for your home things like bread and pasta soy milk tempeh tofu all these things that I'm hoping that we can make here at the sunshine farm it's perfect if your plant-based like we are if you're vegetarian or vegan because a lot of these things if you buy in the store they're full of additives and preservatives you're really looking for that natural lifestyle it's so important to be connected with the process and try making some of these things yourself at home so I'm gonna be making some soy milk with this soy bean and I think we just have enough to be able to make a good amount this is the book I was telling you guys about by Miyoko I think it's Shin er Miyoko has this amazing non-dairy cheese company that you can get at all sorts of grocery stores and they're not based in coconut based cheeses and they're really delicious guys if you have octopus intolerance if you avoid dairy for ethical reasons or environmental reasons or maybe you just want to try a healthier cheese alternative so this is the creamy soy milk that I'm gonna be making with our with our homegrown soy bean I'll have to share a video all about this later because I might apically fail come on outside with me let's plant some lentils and I'll show you guys how easy it really is to grow your own protein in the garden right now I'm about to plant some lentils and lentils are like peas so you're planting them before the last frost when it's still early spring as soon as that ground can be worked but the ground is not too - at that you draw on your seeds so you can see our ground here is nice and wet and I've spent some time prepping this pad to be planted it might look a little strange but what I'm doing here is I put all the woodchips aside to reveal the soil underneath making sure that I didn't mix the woodchips in with the soil and then I dug like kind of like just a little mini trench so I can go ahead and plant these seeds an inch deep in the trench this is a first-year bed so a lot of the soil isn't nice and aerated enough so that's why I want to add the nice loose compost on top so those plants have a chance to come on up this one's a hundred days this one's 115 days we're doing French green lentils and / Dena lentils Spanish Brown on both of these are heirloom varieties I got them from Annie's heirloom seeds they're organic they're pretty cool I'm really excited about lentils I like lentil soup I like alts of other lentil things I'm gonna go ahead and get these lentils planted instead of just having traditional grow planting I'm gonna stagger the lentils so that I can get more in one space so I'll show you what I'm gonna do right now with the French green lentils see these those lentils looks just like what you eat right here what I just talked about get them very careful when you are holding seeds you can drop them and not see where they land luckily these aren't carrot seeds so I can kind of see them [Music] whoops walking is hard then what I'm gonna do is in the middle between the mini rows I'm gonna plant some beets and radishes maybe even some carrots because those things will mature before these lentils are really big well the lentils are planted they should be coming up soon and it was so fun talking to you guys about how to grow plant based protein so thank you for being here and I can't wait to share my next video with you guys sigh friends [Music]",
