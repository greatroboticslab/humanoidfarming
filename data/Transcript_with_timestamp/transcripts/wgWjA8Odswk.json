that they're like be free little chickens oh my God how do you get them all in there at night I'll walk you in there I'll give you a little tour I love my yeah yeah this is so this is like my dream I want to farm so bad visit this is so cool love to share it this is like the best place in the world I think but um yeah I think so it's a little rainy today so it's not you know the clouds look kind of cool it's big old Circle up there but um yeah this is the farm this is my heaven on Earth it does it does exist it's beautiful that was awesome yeah this is like favorite place how do I change this around this is confusing okay so let me give you a little tour you know so the roosting bar roosting bars is the floor we give this a good pressure hose every month or so but um yeah so egg boxes we're about to install two more today these ones oops come out so this is where they lay their eggs in the morning um's gonna come out thiso look I already have one get ready to lay I'll see if anybody's laid any eggs in here this morning yeah business is usual so this egg box is amazing because this helps keep our eggs a lot cleaner we still have our our few whereas some like come out are dirty we still get quite a few that are dirty but these egg boxes are the best ever this is where about this this has AAC chick they all sleep to them it's the roosting bars off the ground but to us it's like the ground in here but my husband built this by hand all by himself wow proud of him for that wow here they go here they go yeah it's incredible soon they're all G to be like it'll be like boom boom boom boom boom like all of them will be in there you'll just hear singing all day there she goes oh my goodness oh that is so cool yeah I'm trying to figure out how to flip my screen I don't know how it won't let me um oh there might be a little flip button or something yeah it's not no that's okay I think when you started recording it wouldn't let me flip it I think we're stuck oh well we can what if I pause it yeah I can stop and cool so for everyone that's listening right now this [Music] is witness the most exciting Morning Experience with all of the chickens and I'm like wondering how do you get them in at night I'm thinking of like chasing them we just want to welcome you yeah thank you yeah that is awesome absolutely so we just wanted to get exclusive insight into your life your business and everything that you're passionate about we got to connect in Iowa I got to hear the pitch it was absolutely incredible you got an egg washer that is going to be coming at some point it's goingon to change your life so first before I just I bet so walk us through what inspired you to start this the farm or just in general like chickens or well anything yeah I've always really had an Infinity for animals um as a kid I am I've always brought home stray animals all the time animals are just a love I have uh it was it's a natural gift that I was didn't realize until I was 36 and so I've been begging and begging for chickens for like pretty much our entire relationship but military lives we don't always have time or space or the housing or the neighborhood and so finally 2020 hit and you know my husband had just gotten home from a deployment yeah I edit so you're good you're good I really wanted to show you the chicken part so I wanted to be out in the field I'm trying to get out of the field now so you can have like yeah so it's like my favorite part of the morning so we 2020 hit and my husband just came home and I was like yes now's my time for chickens he has nowhere to go and we're stuck here so I'm quite persistent um with students I really love and that I really know I want and um so he was like all right let's get a few backyard chickens but we have to do it right so you know it was a neighborhood it's not our forever home we had to make a nicer Coupe which was you know actually helped the resale value which was great but um what we but yeah we got chickens we got like six okay I li chicken math is real y'all we got 10 I was like yeah yeah yeah go to the farm go get some chickens and bring them home I'm like okay cool I'm only going to get six that's all we need and then you see them and they're there and you're like I need more than six so I and he was like what are you doing you said six and I said what I what if some die you know I heard that's a thing and so you know 10 became eventually 20 in a little backyard where I'm only legally allowed to have six but like I kind of paid off my neighbors with eggs so it worked out it's fine it was fine and so no absolutely and it was great I wanted chickens originally just for eggs I had no clue the genuine effect it would have on my mental health um and it funny thing is it all started with a funny little bird that my husband named murderface and she's the one who started it all for me uh she laid me my first blue egg and she was the weirdest friend I ever had and anytime I felt sad you know I'm a veteran I've got issues like every other veteran and um I would go out there just to be alone and just listen to my chickens and it was one of the most therapeutic things for me they weren't snuggly like a dog they didn't want me to pet them all the time they just want to be at my feet and pecket stuff and just be next to me and I'm like this is nice so yeah I found in love hard like real hard and I kind of became a crazy chicken lady to where now I have this really kickass Farm I just feel so blessed by it all the time that's how we got here we my husband's about to retire and we're like What do we do and he wanted to go Contracting and I'm like no please don't do that I don't think I can handle that anymore so can you reconsider like why don't we be farmers and like his initial reaction you know was like what that's too easy no way and then I'm like well just think about it so and then next thing you know I hear him doing YouTube videos and he's like yeah let's do this like all right I'm in I see where you're going that makes total sense he he saw the magic on the YouTubes and he was like right on board with me um from the beginning and it was just amazing um I I took a shot in the dark with him I thought he'd say no and he surprised me so wonderfully in like the greatest way and it's I came here I came here out to pinland for him as a Green Beret I didn't want him to retire and completely lose everything about himself because I made that mistake when I got out and I only did six years I left everything that I knew behind and everyone and it was not a good thing not at all a good thing and so I had to figure out what I had to do the hard way and it was not kind and after 20 years I couldn't imagine what that would be like for my husband and I chose this area for him mainly because as a Green Beret you know you need your identity still you can't just take that away and that's so ingrained and I felt like you need to be near your people they're my people too now so let's go this is a great place I've already worked out here as a as a g fighter in pin land um that's a gorilla Fighter um Pine Land is a fictitious country that closely res resembles North Carolina and it practice uh they teach soldiers unconventional warfare in the Special Forces World and it's really valuable and I get to work so side by side with some of America's future finest like we know one uh Benjamin bun you know he was a for former Special Forces man and you know and that's that's such an honorable job and um oh oh check this out this is my beautiful Diamond can you see oh my gosh I've seen the videos yes I can see her a pretty girl yeah so the Farm's always on there's never stopping on the farm so a lot of people come or like they don't know about Farm Life they're just like oh well don't you have like a few minutes and I'm like yeah I got like five and then in those five minutes something's trying to kill kill something else or the like it's really awesome when before I came to the farm I actually had like a really hard time with life before I came here I suffer from like really bad PTSD and my figh or flight is always engaged it's all the time when you live in a city it's not the best place for someone like me no I'm always on guard I'm always wondering what's that what's this it's like it's quite I can't fix it there's nothing I can do um but being here on the farm like fit here like I found a place where I belong because my on it's appropriate here and I feel so calm knowing that this is a place where that's okay this is a place where I can let that be free because something's always trying to get killed here and something's always needing some kind of Defending from something else and if it's something I can't turn off well then let me use it in a good way in some way and so it's been really helpful mostly like all like it's always been super helpful most of the time there are times where it gets a little out of hand because it's a real situation and I'm like oh my God this is oh lot I wasn't prepared for this what like my first time coming across something okay yes Hi here's Teddy yeah so it's really nice to find a place that I feel like my Brokenness isn't broken it's been really beneficial to a lot of my healing and a lot of things that I didn't know existed until I got here and I left the city and I saw the difference and how much release of tension because I was able to actually do what I've been taught to do but wasn't untrained how not to do anymore so yeah I I this is my heaven on Earth I do feel like those places can exist for people you just have to find yours yeah I love message sending yeah it's a great message for everyone and I know that you're always trying to spread knowledge too and education on you know like I I had the privilege of actually hearing the pitch and not everyone who went to the shower gets to hear these so I mean like about milk about um the eggs in general like what sets your eggs apart like what talk talk us through that piece because it's very interesting well I think a lot of people can do what I do I don't feel like I'm special I will say that I think think what's the most important that I don't feel like I truly got to because I I've never done a pitch I was so nervous I didn't no I was so you know it's my first time yeah the message that like I really wanted to bring out was that our food issues in America are very real and they're very scary 2020 woke me up to that very much and it's just it's a trend that's happening and it's happening more frequently bird flu Aven flu Oh now the dairy cows have problems oh the meat there's something wrong with meat there's a valid argument to the people who don't want to eat meat because they think it's bad for you well yeah the stuff at the grocery store is bad for you don't eat it you are what you eat eats if what you're eating is eating garbage and labade stuff then of course it's going to cause you problems they have a valid argument but the farmers you know when you're a big business there's only so many farmers that own and run everything my eggs are regenerative raised they're pasture raised they're on grass I mean they have that huge giant field it's actually double the size it should be by standard and I feel like it should be bigger but you know but anybody can do what I do lots of people all over America are doing it already but the only difference that I'm trying to bring with my eggs is that I want to deliver them myself directly to the consumer like to the groc store and say okay here's your eggs these are fresh these are the freshest that they can get we will come and deliver bi-weekly because I want to make sure my customers have fresh fresh is always better nutrient count is nutrients is important for your health and the longer an egg sits the less nutrients dense they are which means the less benefits that you get in your body running like every farmer should be a soil farmer um for instance White Oak pastures you can look them up online they're really amazing they are super big into this and they're trying to change the beef industry as well and they're trying to change the way things are done everything's monoculture everything is just one one one but that's not Mother Nature that's not the what God intended everything's supposed to go together in harmony like live together so we can mimic that with with grazing with appropriate grazing I'm not thinking of the right word here um rotational grazing Y and it's easily you can very easily mimic it you can't do it with machines you no farmers can never be replaced with machines we are one of the most valuable Assets in this country whoever controls the food controls the people and I'm not okay with that yeah I want I don't I believe there's another there's so in the industry of eggs eggs sit and by the time you get your eggs from the grocery store they're like almost two months old that's old in my book I wouldn't eat two months old eggs I mean I do have the grocery I didn't know any better now no I wouldn't not one a bit I'd feed it to my animals I'd feed it back to them to regenerate give them back you know what protein what's left but I like nothing goes to waste here you know and so I want to model something different I think we can do better I know we can do better there's Farmers All Over America who can do exactly what we do and regenerate the world people are talking about pollution and all this crap and they're blaming on cow farts well you know why don't you change the soil cuz everything when it rains all that water evaporates a lot of it evaporates in that monoculture situation and like how do you think that's handling in our environment about helping a lot yeah if we change the way we're farming we could change a lot of things and it's just not natural what we're doing it's not healthy either Aven flu happens because of dirty conditions and then it spreads very quickly because it's contagious so avoid the dirty we haven't had one issue with our birds not one not one health issue none of them are vaccinated none of them all of them are all natural just chicks here you go byebye go me some eggs we supplement every once in a while with a little feed but we try to supplement with more raw milk than anything but that's only like winter time summertime they're you know they get raw milk they might get extra eggs that we didn't sell if there are any left over and what we want to do is we want to do a model similar a lot of other Farmers that are doing it but we want to like Empower them a lot of small farmers don't have a way to get their name out there yeah they don't like for instance vital Farms vital Farms is a really good idea they are a wonderful practice however they've now are gone big in corporate and so many people don't want corporate anymore so many people want their neighbors but their neighbors an hour away and they can't always drive there but we can we can deliver and we want to bring other Farmers to join us but we don't want to take away your name we don't want to take away your identity like vital Farms I think what they do is great but they slap their name on someone else's hard work yeah and then they take a percentage it's like an affiliate program they take a percentage from them so the more money they make the more money they make cool story but why not just let that family have it and do it different let them pay the fees or whatever that needs to be done to fall under you and under your your guidelines and such but that's their label at the grocery store that they can be proud of that's their family name out there now in the world and after a certain amount of time you know and they learn what we do we want to teach them we want to empower them we want to we want to bring them out to the world like we want to try that we're trying to bring ourselves out there but we feel like if we have more we have like an egg Army of small farmers just like me who want to put their name out there let's do this and let's do it together let's put your name on the front of that box and mine on the side on a little code let's do it backwards like complete opposite from vital Farms like flip it around one it's their name that's awesome and their ours is on that tiny little code on the back you want to know more about fin my D blah blah blah visit this website you know but that's that family that's their honor that's their pride their hard work and they deserve to show it to whoever they want to show it to you know as long as they're within the guidelines and the standards and they pass the inspections and they do these things why not give America back the power take it back if we're going to fight back if people really want to fight our government back you don't do it with guns anymore you got to be smarter than that you got to play their game how do you control the people you control the food yep and I keep hearing that you know Farmers like they I mean it's good to hear that they still exist but it sounds like it's getting to be a smaller and smaller number of people doing it and of course like you said Corporation everything comes down to money power control um just like yeah so it's a very scary thing and I mean food is everything food is food is medicine y so it's incredibly important I think this message is very important as well so I kind of want with Warrior Rising like we talked about a little bit about your background and the far itself so how did Warrior rising or was it the academy was it the community experience what value did you get from being a part of warrior rising to help your farm there's a few things I got from that from that whole experience all of it good I'll say that first all of it great having that automatic feeling of like hey welcome we got you come on and I i' never met any of those people and every single one of them was so supportive every every single veteran like we're all in competition together but then I was like wait what this isn't oh this is oh I like this one this is a good one um I love working together even though like at the end with still a competition you know that's my style all day you know it's all great everyone's there everyone's still a winner everyone you know you go home with relationships you go home with knowledge having my brain stretched in this way has just been revitalizing I was able to open a door in my mind into a passion like this has been my passion for a while but the way that this expanded my mind was not what I expected it was I I purposely came um with no expectations because I didn't I didn't want to have any and be let down because that's what happens to sometimes with people and I chose to like kind of hide myself from a lot of it just because I wanted to just I wanted to be wow and I was I was floored I was more than wowed girl I was floored yeah so touching for me having such overwhelming kindness and love just thrown at me was just wow it floored me I went there for eggs and I came home with just the money yeah the money's great I am not that's amazing but like if I had to do it all over again and I didn't get any money I would feel exactly the same um the people I met the things I learned oh wow the things I learned wow um yeah it was just I'm Lord I highly yeah it was a very unique group yeah that that group was so collaborative so um and that was my first business shower as a part of the warrior Rising team and I was absolutely just overwhelmed in a good way with how kind everyone was to each other and how the competition was more supportive I mean everyone wanted to see the other person win and wanted to know more about that the industries were so diverse too you didn't see two of the same things there so it was really incredible so um I know you got to get back to your farm but if there is a small farmer out there listening right now or someone who's into agriculture what would your advice be for them to start or to to stay the course when things get hard well for one to get started um research do all the research you can before you jump in have an idea of at least one thing I will say when you get on a farm and you're like Yay you want to do all the things I'm G tell you don't do it hump your brakes hump your brakes my friend don't do it start with one get real good at that one before you move to the next one because it will very quickly overwhelm you it it will it will catch upop with you real quick we towed that line when we first got here but that was because we didn't you know when you get livestock like goats you have to have more than one and so they're quite chaotic little troublemakers so we came here with a plan we knew we wanted to come for a business we knew also knew we wanted to come for like our forever home and so we were very strategic our forever had to have job opportunities just in case our Five-Year Plan didn't work because in in any true business you have to have a five-year plan if by you're five if you're not successful you should probably throw in the towel you know and choose something else because you're just going to be throwing money into a bucket that has a hole and so with the H of warrior Rising like we are oh wow we're we're really getting that that like we were on our way but it's it's going to move a little bit faster now and our dream's going to come a little faster now and when you choose your land Choose Wisely don't choose cheaply wise is always better know your area no flood zones planning is super important before you jump in yeah that's my biggest key advice if you're married and you're going to do a business together you know you should you should get a little counseling before you do that depending on your relationship because it'll test you it's basically like having a baby only like magnified times 12 because it's extra work you have to rely on each other it will either make you or break you and I feel like it's making us which is really awesome awesome yeah because SF life was hard and it was breaking us but the farm is remaking us and it is probably one of the most beautiful gardens I've ever witnessed to start growing in my life after the Army every single one of the people in my family has found some kind of Freedom here and some kind of peace and it's really kickass that's incredible I love hearing that for you and your and your husband so last piece of advice now veterans trying to start their own business veterans wanting to be entrepreneurs what is your piece of advice to them this is not my quote this actually comes from of another farmer called the shepherdess she's down in Texas she does sheep but I will I will quote her think big dream big let me say that again dream big start small and never quit I have been telling people around here hey man one of these days you know we're going to get some where you wait this is my dream this is what I'm going to do I promise this is what I'm going to do and I can't tell you how many people have been laughing at me but I can't tell you how many I can tell you how many people have stopped laughing at this point and if s of been like oh oh she might mean it so she's serious yeah yeah yeah our farmand um he comes every once in a while to help us out with a lot of like like digging and stuff and he he I told him my dream I was like Bryson you stay here with us if you stay with us you stick with it this might just be a real job for you and he's like really what are you doing and so I told him my dream and I told him I wanted to do and be in the grocery stores I showed him everything and where we want it and he just kind of laughed and was like all right yeah good luck he stopped laughing yeah good and that's like the best feeling ever so absolutely you're doing it you're making a difference y yeah you really are for regenerative farming I love this I have such a fire in my belly for it and I just want to have I want to empower other Farmers small like me you can do it too come with us we'll show you and when we're done when you're done with us you don't have to stay with us you can if you want but you can go off on your own too you know we want you to be free yeah I want to get people back some of that absolutely I want to try to help that freedom yeah depresso leave absolutely I mean yeah there you go yeah you're making a huge difference though and it's something that I can align with the the Health piece and like our you know food is medicine like I said so I appreciate you putting doing what you do and empowering other Farmers to do the same because I think the more that we have that the more power we can get back to the people um and our health and taking control of our own lives so without um taking too much time because I know you have a massive Farm to attend to Sophie thank you so much for sharing us and letting us come to your farm seeing the chickens come out and and sharing with us the amazing story and the amazing incredible
