1
00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:03,439
what are the different types of

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:05,040
sprinklers well there's a few of them

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,279
out there let's talk about the most

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,360
common ones i'm dwane smith your

5
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:12,840
sprinkler warehouse product specialist

6
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:12,840
let's get started

7
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,119
let's start off with rotors sprays and

8
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
rotary nozzles since those three are the

9
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,760
most frequently used in residential

10
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:28,400
landscapes these three come in pop-ups

11
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,000
and shrub versions so a pop-up is a

12
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,239
sprinkler head that hides below the

13
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,559
surface of the soil and pops up when

14
00:00:32,239 --> 00:00:37,040
it's time to water whether it's a rotor

15
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,960
or spray body they both have a spring

16
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,280
which keeps the sprinkler collapsed

17
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:43,840
until the valve in the zone opens and

18
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:45,760
the water pressure pushes up the riser

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,079
shrub versions don't pop up and are

20
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:50,000
installed on shrub sticks rotors have

21
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,719
gears inside the body that rotate this

22
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,640
turret on top

23
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,440
it sprays out a stream of water that

24
00:00:54,640 --> 00:00:59,280
rotates there are partial circle rotors

25
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:01,359
that rotate from something like 45

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,080
degrees to 360 depending on the brand

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,920
and model and there are 360 degree only

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:06,880
rotors that just go round and round in a

29
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,799
circle

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,640
pop-up heights for rotors are most

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,600
frequently four inch

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
six and 12 inch also with four inch by

33
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:18,320
being by far the most common and there

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,479
are also the shrub models rotors are

35
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:23,200
usually used to water lawns four inches

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,119
great for most grass lawns six and 12

37
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:26,799
inch varieties are often used for other

38
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:28,960
types of ground cover

39
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,360
and as i mentioned before there are

40
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,200
shrub style rotors they're put on shrub

41
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:34,799
sticks and they should only be located

42
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:36,720
where no one will trip on them they're

43
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:39,200
primarily placed in flower beds behind

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:41,840
larger plants and shrubs so this is a

45
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:41,840
spray body

46
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,040
and this

47
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,799
is a spray head

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
although they're used fairly

49
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,960
interchangeably it's both the body and a

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,880
head

51
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,759
i don't know why that is

52
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,079
sprays emit water in kind of a fan shape

53
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:02,479
spray heads come in a variety of pop-up

54
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:06,159
heights the most common being two four

55
00:02:02,479 --> 00:02:08,720
six and twelve inch pop-ups and also

56
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:10,720
shrub models while rotors are usually

57
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,200
used for lawns sprays are more commonly

58
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,640
used for flower beds spray bodies often

59
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,640
are purchased separately from the

60
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,879
nozzles although you can buy some

61
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:20,800
already put together there are a large

62
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:22,800
variety of nozzles to meet your ever

63
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:25,280
need nozzles come in various spray

64
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,319
patterns anywhere from a 45 degree arc

65
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:30,319
to a full 360 degrees there's some that

66
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:32,239
have adjustable arcs and there's some

67
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,879
strip patterns that are meant for little

68
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:36,640
slivers of grass or plant beds

69
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:38,640
spray nozzles come in various spray

70
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:41,040
distances that's called the radius by

71
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:42,480
the way the distance a sprayer rotor

72
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,040
throws water

73
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:48,400
a shrub style spray body is basically

74
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:51,360
just an adapter that attaches a nozzle

75
00:02:48,400 --> 00:02:53,360
to a shrub stick

76
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,599
rotary nozzles use moving fingers of

77
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,319
water to irrigate your landscape they

78
00:02:55,599 --> 00:03:00,239
are very water efficient rotary nozzles

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:02,319
fit the very same pop-up bodies as spray

80
00:03:00,239 --> 00:03:04,319
nozzles you can buy them separately from

81
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:06,000
the bodies or already installed on the

82
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,080
pop-up body for you

83
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:10,080
like sprays they come in a large variety

84
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,640
of distances and shapes including some

85
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,720
strip patterns as well both sprays and

86
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:16,400
rotary nozzles tend to use less water

87
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:18,879
than rotors rotors are more of a

88
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,959
powerhouse covering large distances and

89
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:24,560
areas they have a larger radius than

90
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:26,480
most sprays usually 17 feet or more they

91
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:29,920
need more water pressure ideally around

92
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:32,480
45 psi sprays need less water pressure

93
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,640
30 psi is optimal in fact too much water

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
pressure will cause them to mist so if

95
00:03:34,640 --> 00:03:38,000
water pressure is too high you can buy

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:40,239
spray bodies that have pressure

97
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:43,360
regulating stem and in some states

98
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,760
you're required to by law by sprays with

99
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:47,280
pressure regulating stems rotary nozzles

100
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,840
operate optimally

101
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,400
around 40 to 45 psi and they have throw

102
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:54,480
distances anywhere from 8 to 24 feet

103
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:55,840
next up impacts these are kind of

104
00:03:54,480 --> 00:03:58,159
old-fashioned sprinklers they were

105
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,120
invented in 1933 so they've been around

106
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:01,439
a while

107
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:03,680
they are a type of rotor they turn as

108
00:04:01,439 --> 00:04:05,120
they spray impacts are noisier than the

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,519
gear driven rotors that i showed you

110
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:07,519
before

111
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,319
they throw water farther and they tend

112
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,000
to use a lot of water the inside of an

113
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,720
impact is just a tube which means that

114
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,720
there are no gears to clog up so impacts

115
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:20,720
are better for you when the water source

116
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,240
is something like a pond or a well

117
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:24,080
they're used a lot in agriculture

118
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,479
because you can get the brass ones like

119
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:28,400
this which tend to be really sturdy i've

120
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,080
seen them used in nurseries and they're

121
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:32,000
used in some places to keep dust down

122
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:33,759
like horse arenas and there are pop-up

123
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:35,600
versions like this

124
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:37,759
flood bubblers pour water out under the

125
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:39,280
ground in a pretty tight radius 18

126
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,600
inches or less

127
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:43,440
in fact some just kind of drool down

128
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,759
whatever they're attached to they put

129
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:47,840
water in a confined space really quickly

130
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,080
creating a puddle one of their uses is

131
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,320
inside of a watering basin to saturate

132
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,479
the soil for newly planted trees they

133
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,320
can be used for shrubs or ground covers

134
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,240
in the right situations and they're used

135
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:00,080
in locations where you really want to

136
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:01,680
avoid overspray like next to floor to

137
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,120
ceiling windows

138
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:04,880
hose and sprinklers are a possible

139
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:06,639
solution if you just need some spot

140
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:08,880
watering in certain areas and don't want

141
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:11,360
to install a sprinkler system if you do

142
00:05:08,880 --> 00:05:12,880
use hose end sprinklers a hose in timer

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,479
can help you water consistently by

144
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:16,320
turning on and off the water on a

145
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:18,080
schedule or you can just set the timer

146
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:19,360
to run a specified amount of time so you

147
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:21,840
don't have to worry about forgetting

148
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:24,160
that you left the water running

149
00:05:21,840 --> 00:05:26,160
in the not quite sprinkler category

150
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,720
there are a variety of sprays jets and

151
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,199
emitters that work with a drip system

152
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:33,280
drip systems use a lot less water and

153
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
lower water pressure to deliver water

154
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,360
more directly to plants to avoid

155
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,919
watering areas that you don't need they

156
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,680
use different tubing and connectors than

157
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:44,240
a typical sprinkler system although they

158
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:46,320
can be tied into a regular sprinkler

159
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:49,600
system on a separate zone

160
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:53,039
so there's spike bubblers drip emitters

161
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:55,199
jets sprays and all kinds of interesting

162
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:57,199
solutions there's also misters and

163
00:05:55,199 --> 00:05:59,440
foggers and there's sprinklers that hang

164
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,160
upside down which have applications in

165
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,680
greenhouses and that's not all

166
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:05,840
but that's all i'm going to cover today

167
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,520
there are other specialty items that we

168
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:09,360
don't need to get into for this video

169
00:06:07,520 --> 00:06:11,280
well we covered the basics there are a

170
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:13,120
