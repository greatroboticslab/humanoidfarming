  "text": "welcome again to farm Vibes [Music] life in today's video we'll be taking a detailed look at one of the most beloved and adaptable fruits lemons this ingredient is not only a staple in household kitchens around the world it also plays an important role in many different [Music] Industries have you ever wondered how such a tiny fruit can be used in such remarkable ways let's explore the fascinating journey of lemons following them from Harvest to becoming essential products that we use every [Music] day once harvested these fresh fruits are transported to a sorting facility marking the beginning of the next stage in their [Music] Journey upon arrival the lemons are carefully unloaded and sorted according to Quality this important process ensures that only the best lemons reach the store shelves and ultimately your [Music] hands any lemons that are bruised discolored or not up to quality standards are discarded or reused for juice or essential oil production lemon trees are usually propagated by grafting a technique that ensures the new tree inherits the best characteristics from the parent tree the grafting process begins by selecting a branch from a mother plant that has the desired characteristics and attaching it to the rootstock of another vigorous plant The Joint point is firmly fixed so that the two parts canuse together over time the graft will grow forming a new tree that grows vigorously and bears fruit earlier than a tree grown from [Music] sea unmanaged lemon grafting specifies time while improving production processes to ensure improved energy and [Music] quality easy lemon harvesting process combining age-old methods with modern advances [Music] many farmers still use handpicking techniques that require special attention to detail and precision this Hands-On method allows them to pick the right moment when the lemons reach ideal ripeness ensuring the highest quality the farmer gently plucks the lemon Blossom from the plant taking care Not to cause any damage as even a small scratch can reduce the value and longevity of the [Music] [Music] fruit after harvesting lemons are carefully placed in baskets or buckets avoiding excessive pressure to maintain the freshness and quality of each fruit on larger Farms Machinery is used to increase efficiency and speed in the harvesting process these machines powered by hydraulic or electric motors gently shake the trees causing the lemons to fall onto random frames or conveyor belts this method is highly efficient and can significantly increase yields although it is also challenging because it can damage the tree canopy once the lemons are harvested they are transported to a sorting facility where the next stage of the Journey Begins upon arrival the lemons will be carefully unloaded and sorted according to Quality this process is important to ensure only the best lemons make it to the store shelves and into your hands any lemons that are stale discolored or otherwise substandard or discarded are sometimes used for for other [Music] purposes such as juicing or essential oil production these sords represent Cutting Edge technology using artificial intelligence to identify not only external flaws but also internal defects in lemons that are invisible to the naked eye the system works with Incredible precision carefully inspecting each fruit the use of this advanced technology has significantly improved the efficiency and precision of lemon processing optimizing large- scale production while maintaining the highest quality standards once sorted the lemons undergo a meticulous cleaning process they are soaked in large tanks of water to remove any dirt debris or pesticide residue that may be on their surface a gentle water spray and air blow system is used to ensure the lemons are clean without damaging the delicate skin of the lemon lemons after being thoroughly cleaned and dried the lemons are prepared for packaging before being shipped to wholesale markets lemons are usually packaged in sturdy spacious boxes designed to hold large quantities of fruit while protecting their integrity these boxes are carefully packaged to minimize impact and prevent damage during transit to retail stores lemons are usually packaged in mesh bags to allow good air circulation helping to prolong the shelf life of the fruit these bags also make handling and displaying the product easier providing convenience for both retailers and consumers in addition to exporting fresh lemons lemon juice production is growing [Music] rapidly once the lemons are cleaned they are processed using a high- powered juicer system that extracts juice quickly and efficiently this process takes place in a sterile environment to ensure food safety after pressing the juice is filtered to remove pulp and seeds then sterilized and bottled automatically the final product retains its fresh taste ensures high quality and is ready to serve Global [Music]
