00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,919
i'm g lakshmi priya and i'm here to

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:05,839
explain the ideal farm

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:07,759
which stands for improved and developed

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:10,000
eco-friendly agricultural land

5
00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:11,599
under the sub-theme sustainable

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:13,840
agricultural practices

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,599
the basic aim of the project is to

8
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,080
maximize the use of land

9
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:19,680
minimize the input cost at the same time

10
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:20,560
use the natural resources in an

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:23,199
efficient way

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,320
without depleting them in the project

13
00:00:23,199 --> 00:00:26,640
we've tried to show

14
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:27,920
various types of farming first starting

15
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:30,000
with the terrace form

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,439
in which we have depicted three types of

17
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:34,399
crops

18
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,680
tea sugar cane corn mustard what it

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:38,239
basically aims to do

20
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:39,520
is that when it rains the top soil will

21
00:00:38,239 --> 00:00:41,120
further shift to the

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,120
other steps instead of washing away

23
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:44,719
completely and it makes the other steps

24
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,719
that more for diet

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:48,960
then we come to the homeological farm or

26
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:52,480
the fruit farm in which we try to depict

27
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,680
orange guava mango plums watermelon and

28
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:55,199
other such fruits

29
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,520
we have tried to show many types of

30
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:59,600
farms just so that if one of them

31
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,640
goes bad due to bad weather or some

32
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,480
other such mishap

33
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,159
the farmer can still sustain by using

34
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:05,840
the other means of production

35
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,360
next we come to compost which is an

36
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,000
efficient way of using

37
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,280
the waste the domestic waste as well as

38
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:14,880
the agricultural waste

39
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,479
to turn it into a manure for the field

40
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:18,159
then we have the biogas which makes

41
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,040
efficient use of the cow dung produced

42
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:20,640
in the poultry

43
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,680
and it turns it into fuel which is used

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,439
in the houses then we have the

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:26,799
solar panels which makes use of the

46
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:27,840
solar energy and turns it into

47
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,799
electrical energy

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:32,159
which is further used for the lighting

49
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:32,880
and then we have the rainwater

50
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:34,720
harvesting

51
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,920
which makes sure that the rainwater that

52
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,200
is collected on the terrace

53
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,439
goes down and gets stored in the

54
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:40,240
underwater tank and the same runoff is

55
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:41,759
also stored

56
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,360
and then used for irrigation in the

57
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:47,119
paddy field

58
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:48,000
like such then we have the fishery or

59
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:49,600
the pond

60
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:51,280
in which we read fish which is another

61
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:53,200
means of production then we have the

62
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:55,040
poultry in which we rear cattle

63
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:58,240
livestock and other such animals

64
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:59,439
for producing milk eggs meat and other

65
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,759
such daily products

66
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,360
and then we have the rice field which of

67
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:04,079
course it is irrigated by the rainwater

68
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:05,840
harvesting

69
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,239
and at the same time it is it acts as a

70
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:11,039
fishery as we put fish in the same water

71
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,480
as uh the cultivation of rice requires a

72
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,040
lot of water

73
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:16,560
so the basic aim of the project is to

74
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:19,120
reduce the input cost

75
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:20,160
and increase the profits what it

76
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,360
basically does

77
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:25,280
it it expels all the other expenses such

78
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:26,879
as chemical fertilizers and the cost of

79
00:02:25,280 --> 00:02:29,280
electricity as it both is

80
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,920
uh done by the compost the biogas and

81
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:32,000
the electric

82
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,680
solar panels this project is made

83
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:37,440
indigenously with the use of

84
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:39,599
used thermocol led bulbs cardboard

85
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:40,560
a wooden base and other such stationary

86
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:42,720
items

87
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,400
i consulted the officials of the

88
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:46,160
agricultural department

89
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:47,920
and also visited the website for the

90
00:02:46,160 --> 00:02:50,319
same they provided

91
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:50,959
in basic information for this which says

92
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,920
that

93
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,640
if we if we imply all these agricultural

94
00:02:53,920 --> 00:02:56,800
practices

95
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,720
we can reduce the input cost by about 25

96
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:00,000
percent while raising the profits to

97
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:02,640
about 50 percent

98
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:03,599
the basic yield in arunachal pradesh is

99
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:05,599
about

100
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:07,840
two to two point five metric tons per

101
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,760
year but by using these practices we can

102
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:12,959
definitely increase that

103
00:03:09,760 --> 00:03:15,040
the basic uh land cultivation is about

104
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:17,200
sixty three thousand square kilometers

105
00:03:15,040 --> 00:03:18,800
although germ cultivation is practiced

106
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:20,720
by using settled

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,879
practices like terrorist farming clock

108
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:25,040
rotation system and other such practices

109
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,920
we can definitely increase the potential

110
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,720
of that land

111
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,720
thank you
