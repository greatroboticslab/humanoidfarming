Bank CB operations of the experiment stopped replying content that's unlimited for our County Conservation is B Davidson County Conservation is we had to Comicon survey statistics output on sale Association SDSU extension USD and NRCS and pioneer hi-bred the DuPont so let's give them all over welcome anyway you guys without any more is playing back from the collection research this is just how we move wire you can see there's lire on that irrigator these are lateral moves that move straight we also have pivot to go go around but we just have the wire running through there in those buckets there's a rope hanging down with a fence post on it and and those buckets give a just enough weight that it doesn't the fence doesn't blow and and and stuff like that so that works pretty good you do like Dan does you get Cody to do it and Casey you know but these are these are bar jay-z Catalan and once we started moving if they could hear the irrigator you can see them my daughter took that with her cell phone so it was into the Sun you can't see it so good but terrible place to work it's kind of like here when you look out the window but as soon as they heard that motor those irrigation pivot motors run and they're just a word they're not very loud but they could hear them and they just come they'd come at a dead run and so we were actually moving out of corn stalks into swath grazing and I just said move that Cheviot and those in the process and then I've got the next saddle show they're moving from this field into the corn stalks so we had a time what we did is we swath grazed between I'll show you all the quality and stuff we swath grades between this oats and pea cover crop that was growing behind winter wheat and then corn stalks and until we balanced a diet I think hen was talking about is exactly right exactly the thing we do with the thing we do with a farm ground in terms of trying to build organic matter in feed them soil microorganisms actly the same thing and everybody wants to do turnip and radishes and clover and whatever well that's not enough carbon you have too much nitrogen you just burn it up and and you've got to have the balanced diet now here the cows are moving we move this lateral move down here they're moving you'll notice if you look closely they they mostly have collars on and they have little fitbit's on their feet and and what those collars do is tell you how much their head is moving up and down and eating and then the Fitbit tells you how many steps and to be real honest with you I haven't analyzed all that that data yet because they're just a mountain of data that we've got to take care of this big draw here there's some tall grass prairie there and there's big draw there with tall grass prairie that's our our area they could get into when it got cold and crappy and that's something you got to think about it wind breaks and stuff until we had that Christmas blizzard that's what happened I move the pivot again you watch them coming from back over here at a dead run down to this pivot so they they really like to swaths ot stuff because that was the candy but you also have to it's like we were joking here everybody's coming over and getting roles right it's a bit too much carbohydrate so and and and those of you that had that had hamburgers you got a chance because you had your protein right but I'm not sure you might have to eat another steak before you leave here if you do them any more so the Cole X research farm is owned by farmers and and actually the idea for the cold lake started at the old steak house down over the hill one night after field day in the in the 80s and some guys said well we want to we should have a research farm and I just said you don't want the government to own it you want to own it yourself because the government owns it you can never tell what's going to happen and you got to have the government involved and that's me to a certain extent working for SDSU but we we have to have the farmers own dan is actually our president now so our board of directors is important to us I'm just going to be real brief today the climate will change but it will still be a continental climate will still have cold winters here relatively cold winters cold and dry normally winters will have hot and dry summers that's not going to change now it's going to change a bit but we're still going to be a continental climate not going to turn into a California or a Florida a bigger issue though and at least in your Mike lifetimes in the next 600 years or something which is beyond our lifetime degradation the ecosystem will have more potential impact and I just wrote one of those articles for farm journal it at one time we had the Cronin's involved in and now I've got a guy from Nebraska than working with but I talked about that and especially as you sit along the Missouri River here and one of the things I think about is all the people used to travel up and down this river and think of what they found when they came through here and how is it different now from when it was when they came and in you know four or five hundred years or when Lewis and Clark came through and and it wasn't like what the revenant shows by the way that was supposed to be here but we don't have the big force of stuff we didn't have that much climate change in the last 200 years but but anyway but what we've done is we took the land around Gettysburg and we took the organic matter down to half of what it was when we came here and so it didn't hold as much water and it wasn't as resilient as it should have been and so when I taught school here in 1975 through 78 which some of you didn't know but a lot of you did she was a student not one of mine but she was a student she's like a freshman when I left but we had dirt blown over the road all time and we could only do wheat and Sommerfeld and look at what's different now and and it's because we started to restore that soil to where it should be and it holds more organic matter than it did in 1976 and not as much as it did in 1776 okay so this is the thing we need to look at and that's the thing we talked about in cattle I think integration plays a role in that ecosystems harvest sunlight energy and drive all other process removing the products from the ecosystem reduces the energy available when the worst things you can do is make hay on a piece of ground and hold the hay off and not bring anything back it's one of the worst things you can do to an ecosystem and so our North unit if you're familiar with our farm we've got a half section a big half section plus of 45 miles north and it's been healing for a guy from the 1930s on incredibly degraded ecosystem and we bought it in 2000 and now we've got it somewhat restored to lease it's way better than what it was when we took over it's better than the neighbours pasture that's over grazed right before it probably wasn't nutrients or all the nutrients available or plant use or environmental services or behave they'd been leached eroded or transported from the landscape if you've got saline seats and those kind of things it's because your nutrients are leaving where they belong and going someplace else that's fertilizer and those saline seeps and we're going to eventually have to put perennials systems back in there to suck up those nutrients and big them back to the top and then graze them and put them back into place that's what happened in the native Prairie cover crops will help us balance our water cycle a little better but they won't totally do it on their own ecosystems that leak nutrients turn into desert that's what's happened in North Africa and all these places think about Israel the land of milk and honey climate hasn't changed that much in the intervening years what happened is they degraded the ecosystem and you can read a thing that that a guy by the name of Loudermilk wrote in the 1930s it's just phenomenal what he found when he went to Israel and looked what the soils are and what they should have been we're doing the same thing 120 car train of soybeans contains 400,000 pounds of phosphorous think of how many unit trains go out of cell V and all these little circle tracks here and there and across the United States and they're all going someplace like China they're not going to send that phosphorus back to us so we're mining when we're doing that we're mining we're not farming remaining we're taking the nutrients out send them across the road February 20th last Saturday or last something like that it costs two dollars and 25 cents a bushel to shift corn bushel corn to the west coast from Aberdeen an elevator managed from Aberdeen talking to me on the phone and he says it costs me two dollars and 25 cents a bushel to ship my corn to the west coast does that make any damn sense hey making sense to me I mean why the hell are we doing it and then they're going to feed animals over there with it with our and then their phosphorus is there so we're spending that kind of money and then we're loops sending the phosphorus with it and Coltrane contains 7,200 tons of coal but when you're digging up coal you're admitting to be a miner that's what you do we take an oil out your miner you know you're going to take it it's just going to be gone but when we started farming our gained organic matter went out it was the same thing we took their gaining matter out gas it off right and it would take at least one coal train per half section in the top just for the top six inches a rain I mean top six inches of soil to take all the organic matter that we lost it's out of the top six inches one Coltrain for a half section so if we're going to restore to 2% in that top six inches we're going to if we're going to do that down to two or three foot just think how many train loads of coal we'd have to bring back in it's amazing so we're partially using cover crops through large extent to catch carbon in the air and put it in the soil one of the things I talk a lot and Danny's heard me do this but when you ship out oil we're working with cold pressing sunflowers in in in soybeans and flax and whatever and we cold press it we get the oil out of it we got good meal I gave Don a bucket of soybean meal that we we use for a protein supplement the stuff that's left when we press the oil out and and and now when we ship the oil out all we've shipped out is carbon dioxide and water there's no minerals in there and mother nature brings your back water she brings you back carbon dioxide in the air and if we do it right she brings your back nitrogen in the air right we're not transporting anything now if we use those things here and keep all the minerals here then we cut down this big transportation thing in six hundred years or 200 years or a hundred years it's transportation thing just going to get a bigger and bigger a bigger problem right so there's our catching the nitrogen we call his catch and release nutrients you know what I stole that from a guy in North Dakota but I got I got another one from Jake Jake Fuhrer the other day I got everything put it in but he said a light bulb did not result from somebody incrementally trying to make candles better we're great we got it we got to start thinking different so to just keep trying to do what we're doing to do a little bit better we'll still have a damn candle so 1970 the average wheat price was dollar 37 a bushel average price of barrel oil is three dollars and thirty nine cents price of barrel oil today is just south of 60 bucks and wheats about three and a half or four think about that 80% 80% of the total input cost and agriculture can be traced directly to energy so incrementally trying to do better and better and still relying on all this energy doesn't make any sense because we're losing the oil is going up faster 120 years ago we essentially were zero don brought his dad down John he's 100 and 103 and he looked at the cows you remember what he said he said if they're eating the sloth he says well they're bailing they're hauling the bales and they're hauling the manor back out right oh yeah that's it I thought that was pretty good uh-oh you got the essence of the whole thing right there 120 years ago that was zero 120 years from now we're going to have to be zero again right now today we're talking about grazing y-l and savouries been mentioned a few times and he talked about brittle or environment through dry climates right well he's saying it's a hoof action I think it's also in dry climate soil biology slows or stops during periods of low moisture the rumen of grazing animals remains moist during button continuing those biological processes the process in the soil are almost exactly the same as a process in the rumen there's almost no different and somebody said and I thought it was Darwin but I can't find the the quote that somebody called the soil the rumen of the earth if you know who that was Cody would that was you that did this so after you left the school mines right okay but but that's the idea behind grazing animals being important in dry climates are relatively more important to dry climates in cold climates the same thing soil biology slows during times of low soil moisture or low soil temperatures the room and the grazing animals are always warm they keep it going during the winter that's the role we're cycling it we're not getting rid of the organic matter recycling it okay so here some of our cover crops that would be our oats and pea thing we swap it the slots have to be relatively big so they don't get covered up with snow the Canadians are not worried about snow depth you know those cows that go out there and really deep snow if they can see it and they will drive on if it gets to be hard snow they'll just I have a tractor on it just or a pickup and just to break the snow but we had some pretty deep snow and it didn't seem to bother the cows a bit that's what it looks like in the fall you know nice and green in there it stayed green like that until basically we were done grazing til is all gone we had a couple fields where we had oats peas and rapeseed winter wheat stubble is going to be seated to corn in 2017 in this field in particular had seven thousand seven hundred pounds of biomass per acre 18.2% of protein and 121 relative feed value zero three which was that pivot you saw a little bit less biomass not a lot seventeen point four protein 115 now since ken was here you saw me goofing with the computer because I went back and got some he he started using something I didn't have on there so he was using tdn so our t DN was 72% on these oat p rapeseed things protein 17.4 that ratio is 4 to 1 so it's too hot if all we did is graze that that's not that's too hot we're just going to waste it right it's it's like you guys eating nothing but steak you need to have some carbohydrates to go with it so we we were grazing these swaths at the same time we were allowing the college to have access to corn stocks not corn but corn stocks after after harvest and that's how we balance the diet and so one of the things if you're planning to do cover crops it'd be good to plan to have some source of corn stalks or perennial pastures or something like that you could use for your filler so to speak instead of and that's what we did we could vary the moves to make them go to the corn stalks and get full instead of just just eat the oats so this is the reason for grazing and material association a little quality corn stock aftermath in at the end of the grazing period mid-january when Don come and got the cows they we had a few sloths left and went and pulled a sample out of the out of those last sloth 16.8 still 16.8 versus you know just still just 17 something TD and a sixty five point one and still had a relative few value of 95 so we lost a little bit of a little bit of quality but not very dang much in that period so I'm fairly confident in the East here now if I lived I grew up in Platte which is just west of course because so you know in that area a little bit more fall rains and stuff it might be a bit different but hitting in this country I'm not afraid of that thing at all so what we did here is a rope coming down from the irrigators that bucket there's two wires one here and here and yeah we should have had a third when it gets really iced up you should have that ground in the middle and we had a couple cows I give you the numbers that you'd move them back through the fence and they turn around come right back through the guys screw you I know this thing isn't going to hurt me because it's icy now here I'm moving I said we should be moving perpendicular this loss we just couldn't arrange it to do that this year the way we had things set up so we're moving like larry was parallel parallel to the swass and it's not ideal but we didn't we didn't have we were done with this field before we had snow so we moved about every day and a half we gave them to sloths or sixty feet and you can kind of see this we these are where the moves before we didn't have a back fence here we had water on this road and then there's corn stalks on the other side of the road but then about every five or six days we would throw back fencing or some side fence so they couldn't get back and just loaf around back over here but they didn't spend a lot of time back there they cleaned up pretty well and you can see down through there the the wheat stubble this is 120 bushel wheat stubble underneath this is the court this is a this is the stubble from the oats and they left the stubble the ate the swath they left the stubble there's and then we had all the stuff from the crop that we'd harvested lay down in there so there's good armor there and you see it's high quality stuff and we did fecal sample and they haven't gotten those back yet but we did fecal sample and regular basis and we we thought that worked pretty good last year when we did study to tell us if we're getting a little lower protein there it's coming through corn stalks on wheat stubble that will be seeded to soybeans we put in oats German millet Brown Madrid sorghum Sudan and somebody talked about this not quite as much biomass because it didn't grow into that late fall this year you know that sportage sorted with self quit relatively early proteins a little lower for all T p-values pretty good that's what it looked like where the hay mill is just starting to head out oats is coming up through there that's what looked like in the swath this is actually from a year ago I took these in there we had to the sloth running this way and we're moving the fence perpendicular to the sloth and they would and we had a bit of snow a year ago and they would just follow that swath just fine see and you can't you can't see where that swath is but it's there but that tells them there's a swath there as soon as you move that wire they'll just come to those spots and there's like twelve or fifteen of them and the way they go we like bigger buckets better than the small buckets a five gallon buckets worked better actually so there's so these were barge AZ cattle mature cows various genetics you can ask Don about that late second trimester and we had a few opens in there 60-day grazing period initial weight of 1392 pounds final weight of fourteen forty nine forty seven pound gain so I did that wrong fifty seven pound gain typo title and you're looking at no they meant game were net and there was a few that didn't gain a couple of them lost some weight and there's something that did way better than the others which is kind of interesting but we did a sixty days forty seven acres of oat P and six acres that millet stuff and then seventy-five acres of corn stock swap out P we we shot for a grazing or what we have is a grazing intensity of five eight a um per acre on those cover crops of high-quality stuff and then since we have more acres the corn stocks now we're doing these at the same time so the average is about a tooth is really what you get out of that if you if you do it and we just give a mineral and salt at lib and you can't possibly write this down in time but but they're going to have they're going to have a copy but all I did is you just Google swath grazing Alberta and you'll get this now the government of elet Saskatchewan and Alberta in Manitoba worked on swath grazing since I've been married in we've been married 29 years and we ran into this then and one of the reasons they really did a lot of this especially in the interim is is mad cow disease because if you if you lived in Canada and your cow calf died 15 years ago an old cow killer cow was worth seven cents American so you got to take something out of your system in order to be profitable or you got to get out of the business and this is one way they did it and and they did this a couple of these large studies somebody showed something from University of Brandon or whatever it was actually a granada' Brandon was one of the stations and they took a 600 Cal herd and split it into three herds at 201 Set stayed in the feedlot all year one set feedlot in the winter they went they went out into perennial pastures in the summer the other side of 200 just was in Fields grazing annual crops in production field the one that performed the bat they went they went in and for five or six weeks and captive they went into the buildings but other than that they were out doing their thing and and and the best herd health the best performance the best whatever was the ones that route the new manager the AG research center in Rapid City the Western campus of SDSU so to speak the livestock people were Ken works and the new person there we were they were hiring they were they were interviewing for that position I was on the committee that came down to last two and I housed both of them the question do you think they'll be feedlots in 40 years you know but what a curveball right if you're somebody applying for a job and some guy asked you that question but one of them answered the one that actually got the job immediately said no and and then the follow-up question is how do you change the way you do AG research in western South Dakota to get ready for the vent reality of not having calves go right to feed Lots now why don't white why do I think there probably won't be feed Lots in 40 years 60 years whatever because you've got antibiotic resistance you've got huge problems with energy to take you know take do silage I don't know what your site is cutting cost Danny a lot I mean that's the way you say that and baling and hauling and whatever and then you have tried to haul the nutrients back out and we saw the data today already that if fat cow peas and a feedlot versus being out in the field it's a huge difference in terms of nitrogen so huge difference in terms of phosphorus cycling so we really don't have a choice we need to get them back out in the field I mean it's not one of those things like we have a choice it's a one of the thing that we're going to be forced to do it eventually so we're better off to do it when we start so I that's a good place these are really interesting videos in Raleigh leaves Minh who isn't here but I hope to bring him today but he's heading to Falls for the rustling terminus sons in the wrestling tournament and he didn't want to get stuck not being there but he wintered 400 head of cows and 370 acres of corn failed corn this year he wintered 400 acres of cows on 370 acres of failed Corney at 370 acres of failed corn north of blunt some gravely ground got dry and he wintered his whole herd there so what you know he was just one move and I feel lying Helen she's put your college in there and I told him build fences and stuff he didn't necessarily do that but he they're still there he says most money ever made growing corn have it failed he got he got his insurance payment right fluffy he grades all he's God you haven't said any hay or any silage all year so and and and he got I sent him this link and then I started getting text last night he was watching his videos and he then we always text and commenting and whatever and I'm going okay this picture was taken and just on the outskirts of Lloydminster Saskatchewan about 12 years ago Lloydminster Saskatchewan is straight straight east of Edmonton long ways north right long ways north long way north the border probably four or five hours north of the border right on the Alberta Saskatchewan border the border of Alberta and Saskatchewan was right through the middle of Lloydminster so kinda like Pierre Fort Pierre only is not a river there there's just a lie just like a little sign they have been doing this for a long time they grow corn just to grapes okay now more goats more cows more sheep why you say goats number one meat eaten in the world is goat just so you Cowboys don't get too arrogant in Africa all the little girls take care of the goats rate 100% grass-fed ground beef this was produced in Aberdeen South Dakota like coke coal cows in Montana bring them to Aberdeen feed them on cover crops and they're grass-fed because they haven't had green interesting content four bucks a pound and the world's supply of my noble Foster's will have exhausted in less than 120 years and the people that have the minor bowl phosphors are not our friends probably even more so now use of perennial sequences of perennial cover crops will probably be necessary to get our nutrient cycling rate mother nature does not do tillage unless it's a catastrophic event and she does not export nutrients okay all tillage tools destroy soil structure all tillage tool degree water and filtration all tillage tools reduce organic matter and all tillage tools increased wheat and in central South Dakota we all know this I'm heading to Missouri next week they don't know this a really slow learners in Missouri mother nature does not kick oh that show me yes oh man she does max here which species survive or die right we don't have to do this to save the planet plan we'll be fine without it but we'll probably be without it unless we do something different bureaucracies like universities governments and corporations are operated by people with limited tenure some with shorter tenure than others but whatever as a joke worked better last week they have short term goals right they're just thinking about three four years in society landowners farmers you know family farmers we need to have long term research and that's what the code lakes does farmers and ranchers harvest sunlight carbon dioxide and water produce products we can sell doesn't make any difference some of this is human food so we need to be aware of nutritional issues off-site impact we want to eat meat maybe we should concentrate on growing meat instead of corn and barley the goats feedlot and feed animals you know doesn't making sense Peak Oil is when you're half done with oil production in the world peak phosphorus we're hit both peak oil and peak phosphorus already peak soil one half of soil is screwed up we're probably past that you know nobody nobody is panicked other than me take the e out of e t take the T out of camp and remember that doing the racing environmentally is almost always the correct economic approach in the long run think about that one so there and it's supposed to be snowing by now Danny I figured does everybody be heading for the door so I made it really short you",
