2
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:11,440
we're

3
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
here on the outskirts of enac in rural

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:13,840
damascus

5
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,800
and we've just launched a vaccination

6
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:18,880
campaign for ppr testifiminal

7
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,010
it's a viral disease of sheep and goats

8
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,199
it's quite serious

9
00:00:20,010 --> 00:00:23,840
[Music]

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:25,199
it's part of a global campaign to

11
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,680
eradicate this disease

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:28,960
but each it requires an international

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:30,000
effort but also a national effort in

14
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:32,160
even down to local village

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,120
level to to vaccinate large numbers of

16
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:34,960
animals

17
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:36,320
in a short period of time to make sure

18
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:37,040
that the disease isn't present and isn't

19
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:40,640
spreading

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:42,320
so this campaign is funded in syria

21
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,399
by three projects with their fail so

22
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:44,879
three three donors the russian projects

23
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:47,600
are

24
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,879
diffid project and orchard donors

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,000
actually very different perspectives but

26
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,920
they all agree on one thing that

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,600
this disease is a priority and should be

28
00:00:51,920 --> 00:00:56,000
uh should be tackled

29
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,239
um the scale of the campaign is going to

30
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,680
be around about eight million doses

31
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:02,000
to be given out in the next two to three

32
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:04,159
weeks it's a very concentrated campaign

33
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:05,439
the vaccine itself is very temp

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,640
temperature sensitive

35
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:09,119
so we have to be very careful about the

36
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,479
cold chain and we visited the cold store

37
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,720
where the where the vaccine is being

38
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
held it's uh it's come from jordan

39
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:16,080
and it's kept at between two two to

40
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,080
eight degrees centigrade the campaign's

41
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,799
going to reach 180 000 herders

42
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,400
uh small scale livestock keepers it

43
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:24,840
enables them to protect their assets and

44
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:27,840
ultimately will help them achieve zero

45
00:01:24,840 --> 00:01:27,840
hunger
