artificial intelligence is

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,240
revolutionizing agriculture by providing

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,599
Farmers with powerful analytics tools

4
00:00:06,240 --> 00:00:11,160
that boost crop yields and farming

5
00:00:08,599 --> 00:00:13,880
efficiency Aid driven Technologies can

6
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:16,000
analyze vast amounts of data from soil

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,800
conditions weather patterns and crop

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,720
Health in real time for instance

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,000
Predictive Analytics can forecast

10
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:24,880
optimal planting times and suggest the

11
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,119
best crop varieties for specific

12
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,400
environments drones and sensors collect

13
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:31,399
data on plant growth and nutrient levels

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:34,000
allowing Farmers to make informed

15
00:00:31,399 --> 00:00:36,559
decisions this technology minimizes

16
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:39,680
waste and maximizes output leading to

17
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:41,840
more sustainable farming practices as AI

18
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:46,440
continues to evolve its potential to
