  "text": "[Music] so [Music] hello thank you so much for clicking on this video i really appreciate it spring is in the air here in southern spain that's all i can say we've had some seriously dull and wet days but every time there is a beautiful sunny day it is warmer than one would expect for this time of year but i love it i love it and along with the warmth come the pests the baby pests or the adults that in the autumn have laid all their eggs on my orchids and then depending on what kind of orchid it is they either hatch and thrive and destroy my orchids or they just go on their merry way and find something else to use as a buffet and what you see here is my dendrobium nephrits alex pauli and the damage of a pest that i have here in my area which is a moth larvae which is my newt and the eggs go on to new growths old growths it is not fussy where it puts its eggs and you can hardly see the damage happening because that little let me say bugger is so tiny that its eggs and its larvae are a fraction of that and for me at least not visible to the naked eye this is a dead one thank goodness but this is a culprit that is doing damage and it is always going for my dendrobium types and i am quite frankly fed up i have tried several insecticides also on a soap basis and yeah check this out that is just that's that you know i'm i'm lucky that i i can manage to save this one but all my den files went downhill because every time they tried to produce a new growth there was already eggs or something lodged in those new growths and they didn't develop anywhere beyond what they should have done so in the bin with the denfalls so it has attacked other dendrobiums and it looks like it could be spider mite damage but it's not it really isn't i never wipe off and have anything orange on me it's it's this flipping moth larvae so the insecticidal soap i can wipe the leaves down i have made a mistake to sometimes wipe them down during the day because that is when i have time and at night you never know if it's going to be too cold at this time of year to have wet leaves but during the day was a big mistake because it affects the stomata and the stomata on the dendrobiums are open during the day so i am going to give credit to a channel called orgyplanet spanish channel i believe he's adrian is in ecuador and he recently put up a video saying he uses or shows that the use of garlic for pests on the orchids and i was like okay i looked up the components and things and properties of garlic to see what that was all about and read up about the allium sativan leaf lecithin which is a protein highly anti-nutritional and toxic to some insects aphids snails and then it talked about larvae and the mealy beetle the meli beetle has larvae and when those are placed by the adults on the plant it will hatch at such a time when the temperatures start to become a little bit more conducive to its survival and start to have a sucking effect on the membrane and the tissue of the leaves and again it doesn't distinguish all the new growths when i hear larvae i think of my moth larvae and i am going to give this a go and i want to talk through my preparation process to get this up and running and ready for use the essential oils in the garlic is not apparently just nice for gambas peel peel or pasta alioli or anything like that it is good for pests and i'm gonna go for it that includes spider mites and i think i already mentioned aphids i'm not sure spider mites aphids anything to do with a larvae and snails so let us prepare some concoctions because based on my research recently i've also noticed that it is good for as a fungicide with a different preparation but we'll give it a go so i'm going to consider that the asl which is the alien sativum leaflet citing found in garlic as part of a protein and the corresponding essential oils i'm going to hedge my bets now and try and do this and see if it works because i need to make sure that my dendrobiums and some of my epiderm crosses are showing similar signs that they are protected now i have here five cloves of garlic and yes i'm just putting all the skin and everything on the floor because hey if it repels insects and repels larvae and all that from feeding and sucking out the um the juices of the growths the leaves the tissue this is going on the floor so maybe i can start the process in the garden at some point but to my understanding there is no harm to be doing this on the orchids during the day it is natural and it is also used in many many pesticides the only time that i have heard about this was on adrienne's channel so for the pesticide that i'm preparing here i'm just going to chop up small pieces of garlic but enough that you get a good concentration i wouldn't puree it because it's going to go into a pump spray so no puree just the pieces you want the essential oils to come out and leech into the solution so i'm just making these pieces small enough so that i can fill them into my little pump spray which is a beautiful beautiful container this can be clear or whatever i just don't go and buy something new my daughter helped me find something to recycle this was a little bit of a body spray from douglas very delicious but i cleaned it out and it is now my pump spray because i needed a measure of a hundred milliliters so the color doesn't matter if you don't like this color you can go with clear it doesn't have to be opaque that's got nothing to do with how the solution is going to react over time 100 milliliters though is the measure and i have on the bottom here already 30 percent of the little container filled with just plain ro water it doesn't have to be ro water if you have soft water in the home please use that that's fine but i have water in here because i only have 96 percent of pure alcohol so i am just bringing it down to 70 so isopropyl alcohol 70 that is what you want and that is why i put water in first in order to to dilute my alcohol let's get that on there so we avoid evaporation this should be my pesticide in 24 hours leave it refrigerated because you don't want the garlic to degrade become moldy or fungus so it is organic and you want to leave this for at least three to six hours 24 hours is the best though and then you have yourself a wonderful garlic solution which next day you spray onto the orchid right now it's obviously not going to work but for the point of demonstration that is what you do 70 isopropyl alcohol enough garlic on the bottom i used five small cloves if you have one big one that is fine as well i don't believe that any kind of concentration is of any harm whatsoever but you want the components at least to give them plenty of time to dissolve and ooze into the alcohol and become your solution so this is going to go into the fridge and tomorrow because it's going to be a sunny day i'm going for it got to try this i don't want to have any new growths that are already starting right here become targets when i see something black like that i get suspicious so that's coming off and i believe i already started it has already started because look there we go that's already one point of destruction right there so it is already happening this is high noon and i am not going to have it if i if this doesn't work i will definitely update you but if it does work you will also find out if it doesn't work i'm going back to my insecticidal soap and i'll be wiping at night however another thing i found out was the fact that this garlic the essential oils are great as a fungicide and i am going to make my solution for that today as well here i have all the measurements on the jug just to make life easier so it's one pint or 16 ounces make sure i'm in or two cups or in my case half a liter as you can see in the back there so that's the measurement and in here i have ro water again because my tap water is really bad quality and whatever i spray on my orchids i do not want that to affect the leaves here i have ground garlic and that is a quarter of a cup american but it is actually half full which is an eighth of a cup of ground garlic i used five large cloves i mean this size okay this is a little bit smaller but that's why i took the measurement out but five large garlic cloves which for me came out to an eighth of a cup and that is going to go into the water and this has to marinade and sit and become one for a day as well it's best the longer is you can do this and leave it the better and then you strain out the garlic and then you have yourself a fungicide so now i'm really hungry the smell of garlic always makes me hungry [Laughter] but if this works then i am absolutely going to be over the moon because i have myself an insecticide that i can use during the day on the underside of the leaves without destroying the growth at least three hours best 24 hours store in the fridge and the fungicide if you're gonna go with a high quantity store in the fridge once you've strained it let it seep for about 24 hours and then strain out the garlic chunks if you're doing a small quantity like this it's going to be used up at this at the moment that it's ready to be used for me in my case i'm going to probably double the next dose so i have enough to go around this is my attempt to get ahead of the game with regards to the moth larvae and i am hoping to come out on top this year quite frankly i am tired of eventually seeing these marks let's hope we're successful because if that is the case eventually i'll buy in some more dendrobium phalaenopsis because i do like them i just can't seem to keep them alive because of this pest issue i have which attacks mainly my dendrobiums so i appreciate you watching i hope that you found this helpful again the credit goes to orkyplanet and his name is adrian i will leave a link to that video down below but i wanted to bring this to everybody's attention because from here on in at least for the next month i will be using this solution and if anybody asks i can reference this video if you've ever used garlic as a pest control i would be super interested to know if it had any results or if it's just a old wives tale and it doesn't actually work let me know in the comments below thank you so very very much for watching i really appreciate it have yourselves a wonderful wonderful day take care [Music] bye [Music] you",
