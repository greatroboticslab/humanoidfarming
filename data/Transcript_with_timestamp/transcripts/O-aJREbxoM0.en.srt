00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,059
today we're repairing a Rain Bird inline

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:09,240
valve let's get started

3
00:00:04,059 --> 00:00:10,920
[Music]

4
00:00:09,240 --> 00:00:12,570
what about where's out you don't

5
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:15,150
necessarily have to cut out replace the

6
00:00:12,570 --> 00:00:17,010
hole valve you can usually just replace

7
00:00:15,150 --> 00:00:18,509
the top and internal parts unless the

8
00:00:17,010 --> 00:00:20,430
valve bodies cracked or their particular

9
00:00:18,509 --> 00:00:22,470
model of Bobby replacing is no longer

10
00:00:20,430 --> 00:00:24,000
available the solenoid and diaphragm are

11
00:00:22,470 --> 00:00:26,279
available for purchase separately for

12
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:27,990
most valves however it's often cheaper

13
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:29,670
and more effective to simply purchase a

14
00:00:27,990 --> 00:00:32,309
whole new valve which will come with a

15
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:34,710
new diaphragms Illinois screws in spring

16
00:00:32,309 --> 00:00:36,239
in fact replacing the valve top

17
00:00:34,710 --> 00:00:38,370
including the diaphragm in Scylla noid

18
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:40,350
is the method we at sprinkler warehouse

19
00:00:38,370 --> 00:00:42,449
recommend because the solenoid and

20
00:00:40,350 --> 00:00:45,239
diaphragm tend to wear out at about the

21
00:00:42,449 --> 00:00:46,860
same rate if you change just one or the

22
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,049
other you more than likely will be

23
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:49,650
working on this valve again in less than

24
00:00:49,049 --> 00:00:51,720
a year

25
00:00:49,650 --> 00:00:53,699
we'll start by pulling out the valve box

26
00:00:51,720 --> 00:00:55,320
if your valve box is large enough you

27
00:00:53,699 --> 00:00:57,330
may be able to work inside the box

28
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,610
without removing it however it's usually

29
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:01,769
easier to dig out the valve box and get

30
00:00:59,610 --> 00:01:05,540
it out of your way here we're siphoning

31
00:01:01,769 --> 00:01:08,159
water out of the hole with a hand pump

32
00:01:05,540 --> 00:01:09,930
it's a good idea to wipe off the valve

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:12,960
to keep dirt and debris out of the

34
00:01:09,930 --> 00:01:14,880
irrigation line before working on the

35
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,880
valve turn off the water your system at

36
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,020
the back flow or at the main valve

37
00:01:16,880 --> 00:01:22,649
relieve the pressure by turning the

38
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,310
solenoid 1/2 turn cut the wires going to

39
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:25,310
the solenoid

40
00:01:25,540 --> 00:01:29,870
[Music]

41
00:01:27,510 --> 00:01:32,430
use a screwdriver to back out the screws

42
00:01:29,870 --> 00:01:34,740
pay attention to which side of the valve

43
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:39,600
the solenoid is on remove the old

44
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:44,280
diaphragm this valve was pretty money so

45
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:46,020
we're cleaning it a little bit more now

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:49,680
we'll remove the top from the new donor

47
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,390
valve this ranbir valve has arrows

48
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:53,790
showing the direction of the water flow

49
00:01:51,390 --> 00:01:56,280
pay attention to how this diaphragm is

50
00:01:53,790 --> 00:01:57,870
oriented carefully remove the diaphragm

51
00:01:56,280 --> 00:02:00,360
don't lose the spring

52
00:01:57,870 --> 00:02:02,520
place the new diaphragm and spring on

53
00:02:00,360 --> 00:02:04,560
the old valve making sure the diaphragm

54
00:02:02,520 --> 00:02:06,780
is facing the correct direction now

55
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,210
carefully line up the new top on the old

56
00:02:06,780 --> 00:02:11,220
valve making sure that the Silla node is

57
00:02:09,210 --> 00:02:13,290
on the same side as it was on the top

58
00:02:11,220 --> 00:02:15,840
that was removed tighten the screws

59
00:02:13,290 --> 00:02:17,670
using a screwdriver don't completely

60
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:21,330
tighten them until all the screws are in

61
00:02:17,670 --> 00:02:23,190
place work in a crisscross pattern be

62
00:02:21,330 --> 00:02:24,870
careful to not strip the screws if that

63
00:02:23,190 --> 00:02:28,710
happens you will have to replace the

64
00:02:24,870 --> 00:02:31,020
entire valve strip the ends of your

65
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,010
wires connect one lead from the solenoid

66
00:02:31,020 --> 00:02:34,010
to the hot wire

67
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:39,810
and connect the other lead to the common

68
00:02:37,290 --> 00:02:41,489
wire or wires it does not matter which

69
00:02:39,810 --> 00:02:44,700
lead from the solenoid connects to the

70
00:02:41,489 --> 00:02:46,890
hot or common wires always use

71
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,870
waterproof wire connectors waterproof

72
00:02:46,890 --> 00:02:50,370
wire connectors have silicon inside to

73
00:02:48,870 --> 00:02:53,660
prevent water from getting to the wire

74
00:02:50,370 --> 00:02:56,870
connections replace the valve box and

75
00:02:53,660 --> 00:02:56,870
backfill the hole

76
00:02:59,180 --> 00:03:03,360
