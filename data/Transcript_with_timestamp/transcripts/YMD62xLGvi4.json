  "text": "I am Shane Harris with a low-carbon extension system you've got that raised bed garden you always been wanting to put in now you got to think about planting that raised bed but planning a rigs bed is a little bit different than the traditional field or row garden you don't need any equipment to plant this garden and the spacing and the technique is a little different than traditional gardening let's take a moment and talk about planting in the raised bed with raised bed gardening we're going to plant them on a block planting design and unlike the traditional three-foot rows the row gardening has a lot of space that is wasted in a raised bed garden we're not wanting to waste any space for example large crops such as tomatoes or squash will need to be on 24 inch centers whereas things like cabbage potatoes or corn are spaced about a foot apart smaller vegetables such as beans peas or onions are usually around four to six inches apart let's use this illustration to explain the planting techniques for the raised bed all spacing is based on a 1 foot square design and a 1 foot square spacing you can get 32 plants this will be appropriate for corn lettuce Irish potatoes even okra for larger plants such as cabbage broccoli peppers and even collards 18 inch spacing is typically used are much larger vegetables such as tomatoes squash cucumbers and eggplant require 2 foot spacing many of the vegetables require only 6 inch spacing this would include beans peas and especially carrots onions and even smaller spaces for turnips or radishes that's a lot of plants in a raised bed using the block technique in a raised bed there are multiple combinations and planting designs that you can use the idea is to maximize all available space so that every foot of space has a plant in it remember that dense planting techniques result in higher production of per square foot in the garden hopefully more production will equal success and a delicious harvest for more information on raised bed gardening contact your local County Extension Office our visit us online at a secede EU",
