1
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:09,000
it rarely rains during the wheat growing

2
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:12,240
season at simmit research station near

3
00:00:09,000 --> 00:00:14,839
oon in northwest Mexico and ironic as it

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:17,680
may seem that makes oon an excellent

5
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:20,199
site for testing rainfed wheat systems

6
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:22,400
researchers can precisely control water

7
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:23,800
through carefully managed irrigation

8
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,080
they can simulate everything from

9
00:00:23,800 --> 00:00:28,960
extreme drought to Monsoon

10
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:31,039
rains for Yan Manis a rain-fed wheat

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:33,239
breeder at simmit this experiment to

12
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
compare wheat yields under zero tillage

13
00:00:33,239 --> 00:00:37,200
with normally tilled wheat under

14
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,239
Precision water control was crying out

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,000
to be done there are three trials for

16
00:00:39,239 --> 00:00:45,360
each treatment two of them are two

17
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:48,160
s so two semiarid will deal trials so

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:50,039
they are genotypes which are tested

19
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:51,680
internationally even when the wheat was

20
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:54,800
still a bit green and not quite ready

21
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:56,399
for Harvest he could see differences the

22
00:00:54,800 --> 00:00:58,920
advantage here is that it's increasing

23
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:02,920
the chance to have the the remaining

24
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:04,879
speculates a bit of fi as expected wheat

25
00:01:02,920 --> 00:01:07,040
under zero tillage appeared to do better

26
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,520
when subjected to water stress than the

27
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:10,520
same wheat grown on a ploud

28
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,759
field but the proof is in the grain

29
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,720
itself under water stress different

30
00:01:18,759 --> 00:01:23,079
wheat lines may have different ways of

31
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:25,360
compensating only after harvesting the

32
00:01:23,079 --> 00:01:27,960
grain using these miniature combine

33
00:01:25,360 --> 00:01:30,920
Harvesters and a detailed analysis could

34
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:33,320
a result be determined of course the

35
00:01:30,920 --> 00:01:37,200
zero tillage trial won at least under

36
00:01:33,320 --> 00:01:37,200
the stress of less than Optimum

37
00:01:40,280 --> 00:01:43,280
water
