  "text": "some reason okay we're good it's all done okay so beth did put in the um chat if you wanted to have uh captions that you could click that link and um you would have that so welcome everybody this is day two of our three-part uh series on research and farm labor and today we are going to be talking about well i'm not going to be but my colleagues beth holtzman and john hendrickson are going to be talking about the farm labor dashboard and giving you um a little bit of a behind-the-scenes peek at what we've got there and this is a tool that is designed for farmers but also for technical assistance providers in working with farmers and when we finish up we will have time for questions but i believe seth and i will be monitoring the chat as well so if you have questions during the presentation feel free to drop them in there and as time allows we'll go ahead and get those answered for you so let's see beth i can't advance the slide so i don't know if i'm done now or not okay there we go there's our there's our faces this is only part of the team we have aaron who is on board here today we have kathleen liang who is on board today and we have uh jason parker who was up yesterday and maybe taking a break today so this is our team that is our website any one of us are happy to respond to questions phone calls emails whatever we are passionate about farm labor and have spent a few years working on this issue so all right beth i will i guess i'm turning it over to you right yep um okay so today's session as mary said is going to focus on the tools and resources available at the farm labor dashboard i'm going to start with a little bit of background then i'm going to give a quick tour of the dashboard it's going to be pretty speedy and that includes a look at what's in the resource library we'll have some time for question and answers and hopefully some discussion at the end um and i'm just going to prompt you now that um at the end please feel free to um to turn on your mic and maybe your video to ask your questions you can do it through the chat um if you want but if you have the bandwidth and the interest we'd love to hear your voices and see your faces as well um so i just want to start out and now i am going to ask you to share share in the chat box um with um why focus on labor um could you if you could just tell us what issues challenges or opportunities you're seeing um from whatever part of the country and whatever um job or um perspective you have we'd love to hear that so um don't be shy type in a sentence yeah don't be shy um and i guess i could even um to get us up so labor issues can end their farm oh i'm sorry mary don't you think it's a happy place to start yeah it can they're they're they're big for sure anybody else want to chime in we have 32 people i bet mary or rubin if we get 15 people to chime in so 14 more folks and mary owes me a sandwich let's do it people we can do this somebody say it's expensive yes it is they purchase my business expense both farm and construction business so yeah all right so now we have 13 more to go and i won't be hungry to improve conditions for farm workers excellent and compassionate increased productivity nice it's time consuming to have a continuous turnover yes and expensive as mary said hard to find farm labor uh big uh focus on reducing absenteeism how might we be able to do that to keep young people in iowa or bring families to our small towns repopulate rural america yes all good i'm going to um move on we don't have 15 people yet then i owe marry a reuben labor is necessary to operate the farm you keep counting i'm going to all right you move on so here was our team's assessment as we came together from our various um organizations and um institutions we were seeing that um that that like you all noticed or brought out that it's a significant expense that for diversified and produce farms labor costs range between we were finding at the time between 35 and 60 percent of gross sales per acre and when you're looking at small and medium-sized farms tight profit margins um having uh good labor management is really key to viability and resilience we were finding that it um impacts farm scale and farmer roles and also farmers satisfaction with their quality of life and their business performance um as people mentioned here scarce lubrical and the seasonal nature of the work can make it really hard to find and keep employees and that redundancy around training can be really tiring for farmers a whole bunch of regulatory challenges um uh going back about five years four or five years ago we were seeing the labor department um coming in and people finding themselves owing some back wages um and also a lot of policy uncertainty associated with things like immigration and administration of programs like h2a and perhaps the biggest and most important reason that we all came together was that farmers were telling us that they need to boost their labor management skills um and knowledge and confidence um so um the group of people that mary mentioned earlier all came together we've worked together on two multi-state integrated research and extension projects um and so the research goals are around increasing um understanding in a variety of topic areas and the extension goals are to develop and share new training education and resource education resources to help farmers become more effective labor management managers and in both um projects basically had the same series of activities we did a bunch of interviews and focus groups and serve and some survey work with farmers there was data analysis looking at themes and gaps and then all that combined in the development of tools and information products um here's just a quick um showing you the different organizations that have been involved um so as jason discussed in his presentation yesterday the research phase of the project looked at how farmers identify issues in labor management and he and kayla grouped these topics into six major themes which you can see here um and they all are are part of the puzzle of having good employees getting the work done in a timely way and for each of those six six themes there's actually um many more different topics and issues there's a lot going on i'm not going to get into the details of this but as i bet all of you know it's both complicated and complex um and that's the com the context for how we were thinking about the tools and resources we wanted to put together in this online resource which we're calling the farm labor dashboard so right now what we have is a suite of four interactive tools we have a resource library more tools and resources are coming in the next phase of the project which runs through 2022 and obviously it's online and available 24 7 where farmers and people work with them can access the resources our content focus has really been on helping farmers build um skills knowledge and confidence um to be better managers to help them adopt effective protocols and procedures and to address barriers that they encounter we see that it has as mary mentioned before multiple uses the farmers can access the tools anytime for those of you who are educators you might be interested in incorporating them in your education or outreach programs and business advisors who work one-on-one with farm businesses or a farm team i think also might find some of these resources helpful in moving your clients forward with their labor management so um i'm gonna take you on a quick tour through each of the tools um so the first one is called the labor readiness self-assessment and um basically it focuses on six areas planning recruiting and hiring training and supervision recording record keeping record-keeping taxes and insurance performance reviews and ending employment and the tool provides a summary of farmers strengths it identifies weak links and it suggests resources that will help them address those areas of vulnerability moving forward so it is divided into 21 questions um and in the six critical areas um here are some examples of questions um that that people will be asked to answer and they kind of have the same structure and all of the questions are required so you can kind of look at those and based on how people answer those questions they get a visual representation of their relative strengths and areas where they can build knowledge and skill and in any area where there's a weakness they would get get some recommendations for resources to build um to move forward and we tried very hard in our recommendations both to go from kind of a asset based both you know really recognizing their strengths that they can build on and the positive benefits of improving in the areas that might be seen as weak links so here's one example we have considered the ways that hiring employees will change our roles on the farm so if there doesn't show what they selected but for example if they answered no we need more information or just starting they'll get some recommendations for where to go um and for this particular question the recommendation talks about how learning to be an effective manager typically requires a mental shift in how we see ourselves it recognizes where many farmers are coming from that they got into farming because they like the work of farming but also brings their attention to the challenges and changes in the roles and activities that will be necessary to be an effective farm employer things like they'll be likely to be spending more time managing the work of others teaching and help others to be productive and their own time is going to shift to doing hiring training record-keeping and managing so it's optimistic focuses on learning to enjoy new roles and and it sends people to specific resources so with that i'm going to shift over and let um john lead you through the employee cost estimator um as he was the major developer of this tool here john i think you're on mute john thanks mary now we can hear you so this is john hendrickson i'm at the center for integrated agricultural systems at the university of wisconsin um so one of the big unknowns for a lot of especially first-time employers who are considering hiring their first uh first person to help them on their farm is what exactly is this going to cost and you know the first thing for a new employer to learn is that it's not just the hourly wage um i guess this is assuming that they're going to be paying the uh hiring above board and not just paying somebody cash under the table so we built this employee cost estimator to help people understand the full cost of becoming an employer and hiring people on their farm so there uh mary or uh beth you've got control of the slide so you can advance for me go ahead so there is a tutorial video on the website that walks people through the tool and in perhaps greater detail than i will do here today uh it is also uh true that there is both this online version of the tool that i'm going to be showing you here as well as an excel version of it that you can download from from the website as well okay so it's not just wages in terms of the full cost you've got payroll taxes you've got insurance workers compensation insurance perhaps you're going to be having to buy you know some farms have specific tools that are you know these are your tools bob or sally and those are yours so you might be having to buy some additional things for your employees might be having providing food or providing housing for employees you might be offering some bonuses or incentives and there you've got the total cost so what is that total cost so this form is designed to walk people through that process to get to that total cost okay so this is what the estimator looks like online uh the first step is to name the report if you want to save it and then you can plug in a job title for an employee position that you're wanting to hire and then below that is a place to put the hours by month for the different positions that you might be hiring and then there is a second tab there so go ahead beth the second tab in that section after you do the hours is wages and benefits and this is where you start with the hourly rate and then add in all those other items that you might be providing whether it's housing or food or retirement plan perhaps health or other personal insurance bonuses and gifts and a person can use those categories for you know for even things that maybe are different than the titles there as long as they get all the costs and then below that go ahead beth is first there's a spot to you can do multiple employees at the same time so that you see a little button there at the very top that says add another employee so you could add in a whole bunch of employees and do them all at once with different hours and different wages and different benefits and then at the bottom is where you build in the other costs federal unemployment tax workers compensation state unemployment tax all um social security uh medicare all those things now some of these on the federal level are standardized across states some of them are obviously unique to states and so this is a place where a person using this tool very well may have to do some addition some homework on their end in particular in terms of workers compensation workers compensation programs vary widely from state to state in terms of who is required to enroll in workers compensation and the specifics of how those costs are structured and it can be quite challenging to figure that out on your own we encourage people in the video tutorial to contact people like us service providers who work with farmers to answer questions or perhaps even better to contact other farmers who are already employers to find out what are what is a what is a percentage to put in for workers compensation in my state you click submit um and one thing i will note while we're uh transitioning slides is that none of the data that farmers are entering into this site whether it's the excel spreadsheet that they download or this online tool is being collected or analyzed by anyone it just the form gets filled out you can download and print the forms as pdfs or save them on your computer but they're not being saved on our end so this is an example where a person put in uh one field crew person that was working 1280 hours on the farm at a hourly pay rate of 10 and so their you know base wages is 12 800 but then you build in uh the benefits that were being offered they're going to be providing some food um and a bonus or a gift and then building in the fico fuda workers compensation in suda adds in all those numbers and so you have the total cost for the employee for the year and then what i think is an extremely useful number for farmers is the labor cost per hour this is important if you're sending crews out to do work for you it's kind of nice to know what the fully loaded labor cost per hour that you're paying for that crew to do that person to do when you're sending them out to do a job so we call it an estimator because it may may or may not um be completely accurate depending on how well you've done your homework in terms of some of that those factors like workers compensation um but it does provide a way for uh particularly a new employer to get a sense of what the full costs are going to be for them great thanks john so the third tool that is on the dashboard is this job description generator um and basically it helps people um both sort of professionalize and formalize um and um provide consistency in terms of creating job descriptions for the various positions on their farms and there's six basic steps so the step one is that you describe this is what it looks like when you go there you describe the over the positions overall role in the farm business um and so you'll see that there's some sample language there that helps people get started for describing their farm and then the next step is to summarize the major responsibilities [Music] and um it's possible to go ahead um and do some of the you know some people work from the big picture and then fill in the details and some people um like to have all the details and from that come up with their their big picture so for some people it might make sense to um skip ahead to the next couple of sec sections and then go back and complete the summary of the position you can see i've highlighted there um so right now the job description generator is really focused on produce farms and it has um a pretty extensive list of different kinds of tasks that you can choose um for what what the tasks are that are associated with that position and the approximate percentage of the total work time um and in this slide you can see that any place that it had that little plus it can open up and there are a whole bunch of sub um sub categories of tasks that you can select from to create your job description the next step is to think through the qualifications and skills and experience that are required for that position and to list the wages and benefits as well as who the person will report to categorize the type of position and hit submit and when you hit submit um you kind of get a written you get a job description you can download it both as a pdf to use as is or as a word document so you could further edit and modify it um so um so either way works and again like the job like the estimator it doesn't store work so you need to to create a new version you would have to start over our fourth tool is a policy manual generator it's a lot like the job description generator and it provides sample language um to help build a policy manual which um uh you know is considered an uh an important part of um of of having a well-run farm letting your employees know what's expected of them um and having everybody be treated the same and fairly um and um there's a big caveat here about making sure that you check with your state labor department or your own attorney to make sure that the policy manual is in compliance with um your state's laws and best practices um so the policy manual generator is divided into 12 topic areas and each topic area has several items and in each one there's some sample language that um to get you started um so it gives people an idea of of what what to put into those um slots because we found that you know just starting with a blank piece of paper or word document could be a pretty overwhelming place to start for someone in developing their farm policy manual and you can see that there's places there's either xxx or a blank which indicates places where the user needs to fill in the specifics for their farm and again you need to download and print your work and again you get a pdf version or a word version that you can further edit and the final component of the dashboard is this resource library which is searchable using we have this filtering factor so you can search according to topic the material type and the location to look for resources that are pertinent to what you're working on so if for example you chose from the topic of managing employees there's multiple subtopics you could choose supervision and then you could decide what what material um kinds of material there's videos there's fact sheets there's some audio there's um i think maybe whole curriculum so you can choose what you're interested in looking at and then the location is basically the four usda regions so that would be northeast north central south and west so the kinds of materials we have there's um we've we're also pointing to existing resources that are available at other online libraries um including the agricultural risk management library and the beginning farmer and rancher development program um library which is called farmanswers.org and as i just said because because we recognize that different people learn in different ways some things are covered in multiple ways so there might be a fact sheet and a short video tutorial that essentially cover the same topics but we can imagine some people would prefer to download it and read it away from their screen other people would be much more apt to watch a video there's video we have some templates of things like job um applications that people can use download put your logo in um checklist for a new employee orientation we also work to fill in some gaps so here's an example of some simple fact sheets we developed to help farmers make job interviews more meaningful more professional and more consistent so those are easily downloadable and if you were using the readiness assessment and your answers there indicated that you didn't have a lot of experience or a formal process for hiring process they would refer you to these resources as things you could use to get you started so um there are also resources related to legal aspects of labor management most of which were developed by our colleagues at farm commons and here's a couple of examples um and just to like wrap up tips on using the dashboard tools um so you know if it's your first time use the instructional information provided with each tool regardless of whether you're reading or watching the video take advantage of the sample language be sure to download your work this one's really important and let us know what else is needed and would be helpful suggestions for your for for farmer-ready resources are really quite welcome in uh the next phase of our work we're going to be continuing to look at the way that labor and mechanization decisions influence and have impacts on investments in labor equipment and machinery and to integrate what we're finding into education and resource materials we're going to be continuing to analyze skill sets farmers need from workers and farm characteristics farmer workers look for and again integrate all that into our education and resource materials thanks to funding we just found out about earlier this month we're going to be able to offer a whole new round of farmer education later this year and in 2022 which will um use many of these resources and um to to help the education is going to primarily be offered online both in online and self-study opportunities and we're going to continue to develop and test tools at the dashboard so one example is to have a tool similar to the employee cost estimator to look at the interrelationships of mechanization and the amount of kind and kind of labor that's needed in an operation and that is the end of our presentation so um like to open it up to questions first um and if we have time then we can move to i think we will to some more broad-based discussion so far no questions a lot of compliments about the tools can we register to get updates and taking advantage of future phases is a question natalie asks absolutely um so i have your contact information now we have it now and we will definitely use that to continue to let people know what's what's coming what's available i'll throw in that if you use any tools and you have some great successes or ways you've used them and you could share those anecdotes with us that would be helpful to us as well including on suggestions for improving one thing that um john had this great idea when he was looking at his um cost calculator tool in conversations with your employees in any of their reviews or whatnot potentially using that information to share hey here is the cost um you know and here's here's what your hourly wages given your you know promo csa share vacation whatever have you and john i won't share any further because you are here but i don't know if you want to expand on that in any way yeah the notion was that you know one thing that can be a struggle for any employer is motivating their employees to be you know productive and effective uh and contributing to the farm and you know you as as the farm owner you know you're you're living and breathing and you get it how important it is to to work and get the jobs done effectively and in a timely manner and it could be more difficult for them you know an employee to to see that so we thought that you know one way that a farmer could use that that information from the cost estimators to share that with their employees that you know i'm yeah i'm paying you 12 dollars an hour but you're actually costing me 16 an hour and so it can maybe help impress upon that employee the need for them to be uh productive uh when they're on the farm is that what you're getting at seth yeah exactly so um somebody asked if we could put the dashboard website on the ad in the chat and so i just did um so you could click on that and get to that thank you john mary tossed about offering a disk workplace profile as part of our building effective teams that is just simply fabulous and mary is a great instructor what additional tools are we considering team oh back to john well i just uh would think it would be nice for for mary to perhaps briefly exp for those of us who don't for those in our audience who don't know what the acronym disc is why don't you briefly tell people well done john well um so there it's not really an acronym in that it doesn't actually stand well it does stand for something but um it basically is a workplace profile it's a profile tool in the same way that myers breaks you might have taken myers-briggs or you might have taken colors or you know there's any kind of different kind of personality assessments that are out there this one zeroes in there's a couple reasons why we like it it zeros in on this one specifically on the workplace environment and it helps to help you helps you better understand basically what are the things that motivate you and what are the things that stress you out and what kinds of people are your sort of natural allies in the workplace and what kinds of people might you have to step out of your comfort zone to work with and you know as managers we have to do that all the time and i have done this now with hundreds of farmers and it's incredibly accurate they always love doing it and it's just it's not it's not all you have to do it's necessary but it's not sufficient but anyway so the offer i made is that if you're if you're a farmer and you want to know about uh when we'll be offering it next then drop your email in the chat and we'll stay in touch um if you are a technical assistance provider or an extension agent and you work with farmers and you'd like to partner with us on offering it then let me know that as well and we're happy to do that so um it's it's a fun little piece i don't recommend that we do it during the height of the season but it's it's a really nice sort of preparation tool going into the training season so so there's that and um beth did you tell them about the tailgate trainings i didn't why don't you why don't you share about that okay we uh one of the fun well i i will say fun and quotations mark because i might be the only one that actually thinks is this fun on the team but um one of the things that we'll be adding under resources is a series of sort of tailgate trainings and what those will be is very short training segments that farmer managers can download and use in their own professional development to get better or with their directly with their employees so you know if you're a farmer you've got a staff meeting every tuesday at 10 o'clock and you know you get some coffee and you hang out then it's like this would be a really cool way to give you some thoughtful ideas on how you might structure a staff training or some topics that you might want to discuss with your staff so and i see we have a disc fan in the audience also indeed um we also have um what is a job satisfaction questionnaire for ag workers um which is which is in the works so that would be excellent if you interface with mary or beth and they could send it all out to everyone when you're done with that that sounds great so if you have ideas for training topics if you have ideas if you have really cool tools out there as seth said if you there are places that you use let us know what they are send us the links um we're not we would love to house those links on the dashboard with permission and proper credit of course but um you know we just we want to make this as useful to farmers as we can possibly make it hopefully down the road we'll be able to branch out and look at livestock based farms as well but that's kind of a different animal so so to speak so to speak animal friendly as well and so malcolm sent us uh the questionnaire that they're refining so that's excellent to beth our techie person for that so yeah so all the tools will be integrated into the education that we'll be offering in the um later this year and in 2022 um so we'll be providing support for farmers to um to learn about um to learn and to implement changes on their farms we also have a curriculum related to negotiation which will be incorporated which can be really helpful um in the employment and management sphere of their work so any other questions not many so far this is the part of the part of the session where um i was hoping maybe some of you might um unmute and maybe turn on your video and um and share or comment you may have to throw the reuben up again seth we can do ah kristen yay i'm showing my video but i have no i have no particular comments to make can you make one up you know you're here you made eye contact about anything i am i'm interested in the satisfaction questionnaire so thank you malcolm for for sharing that springfield community garden you're on mute if you want to unmute if you have something you want i can mention just um which a couple of you are aware of but we've developed an a guide to writing a farm and play manual for massachusetts farms with a lot of guidance on the massachusetts specific laws on that front so that um we're actually just putting finishing touches on the web version of that we've had it in hardcopy form for a while so that'll be on our website bylocalfood.org in the coming week hopefully or two weeks at the most so that's the one resource i have to offer great thanks yeah i would also say that the um the legal guides as you might imagine are state specific that are on our site so uh you'll see some for vermont new hampshire pennsylvania uh wisconsin north carolina i mean so and the farm commons also has a lot of resources on their site for other states as well so always a great a great place to go hi mary this is miley springfield community gardens hello hi miley hi i took your disc training about a year ago and i really enjoyed it and we would love to talk with you more about doing that for our staff we have a four farm incubators and seven full-time farmers and then um you know just 18 community gardens and we'd just love to learn some more about how we can be more effective managers awesome i'll be in touch thank you okay yeah i do i love doing disc trainings um as does seth but seth i'm not going to volunteer seth because he's um he has a full plate right now thank you mary there are a lot of fun though i agree kristen can you put into the website in the chat um i googled but could not get the website yes i will do that and i'll actually put the link to the the future employee manual where it will be landing in a another week or so but yeah you've got it looks like angela put our our website up there thanks angela and you know beyond just the scope of this um if you have resources that you come across that you think are really good or would be good models for us again we would love to know i mean it's um as beth said this labor stuff is uh complex and complicated and um it's not going to get better any time soon i don't think but it's um it's a nut that we all have to crack so um we would love we are hoping that we will be able to start some sort of a learning network or a community of practice or something around these kinds of issues and so that maybe we don't have to reinvent all the wheels every time so angela's link brings us to your um home page do you want to get us i guess it would resource farmers that's where you i would find it a learning network would be appreciated that would be actually an interesting idea mary yeah i'm going to put my email in the chat now so that people can reach out to me if they why don't you just put your home phone number in there and they can just call you at home well oddly enough seth my home phone number is now in my email soon boundaries have completely eluded me so come on over for dinner whatever so all right well i'm not seeing a lot of other questions or comments but again as you think of these things if you um did send me a message and ask for more information i will be in touch um and other than that i think whoops cultivating success through wsu is that wisconsin extension or washington state university yeah that's obviously it i shared this course with them last night as labor was a subject we were covering i hope other is in the course were able to join so thank you candace you could share that dashboard too if you wanted and kristen put a more precise link in the guy in the chat employee manuals a generator for massachusetts farms christian anything that says groovy is our generator she's gone i'll let you judge as soon as it as soon as it goes live well done so um just to um let everybody know um we'll be we're recording this and um well as soon as we can we'll be posting the recording and also the slides and um some you know links like the links to the buy local food website and new guide um the things that have come up will be posting all that and then i'll be sending that out to everyone who pre-registered so that you'll have access to it yeah so previews of coming attractions we wrap up this series tomorrow tomorrow we've got kathleen liang will be presenting on her experience she's a member of our team and she's working in north carolina and she'll be talk sharing some of her experience in research that she's collected and then we'll also be hearing from rachel armstrong and jennifer hashley on a stair project that they've been working on for a couple years now on um labor pools is the best way i can describe it without getting too too detailed and two in the weeds but um so if you're interested in those please come back and join us again tomorrow we will also be recording it we we hope fingers always crossed on that and then these will all become part of the resources in the dashboard site not much more in the chat thanks and yes others from washington state did attend i think you answered natalie's question hey and i am trying to get back to everybody who's sending me private messages about disc thank you for keeping me busy um drop your email in the chat so that it'll be easy it'll be a little easier for me to pull out and get back to you and i think that's it yeah i think we can wrap up we can give you 12 minutes fabulous thank you thank you're you john that's 12 minutes at no extra charge",
