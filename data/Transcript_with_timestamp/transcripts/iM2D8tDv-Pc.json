  "text": "hey Exiles how we doing Mr a2g back again playing some more Saga of survival all right we're going to do something a little bit uh different today I want to explain as best as I can um about the new adventurers Quest that's come through so we only got a little bit about it in the patch notes saying that you know every so often on your daily rewards uh you've got the ability to claim for you know uh this one here so the adventurer Airship basically it's a limited time uh zone so we've only got a certain amount of time to go into the Zone see what it's all about uh fulfill the quest and then obviously move on claim the rewards all that sort of stuff then we've got another one here a little bit further down on day seven on my end here whether that matches up with you guys or it's a little bit indifferent um your mileage May differ to mine so I've already claimed for it and we're going to go ahead and activate that and we're going to get right into it and we'll see what it's all about I'll take you through it and hopefully we'll get it wrapped up um pretty soon soon now before you guys go ahead and uh jump on to the Overworld there to see where it is you need to claim for it so by doing that you need to go into your Vault scroll down until I've got a lot of stuff in here by the way um until you actually find it so you'll find it in a moment's time there we go so you got the Airship Adventure here so you just want to go ahead and claim and let's see if that pops up in our infantry or does it pop up on the map let's find out okay so it's there so we go use Limited Time Adventure has begun so I'm assuming that might be the same thing for the um for the next adventure quest as well uh but for now we'll just roll with this Adventure Quest and see what this one's all about it should populate on our Overworld map there we go so limited time and Adventure a stranger uh sorry a strange thing came down from the sky and AIT go help the pilot well let's go ahead and do that so he's just situated over here and we'll run in we'll see what it's all about so it's not a particular too U too difficult of a zone so one and 1 half skulls what I've got here is completely overpowered for the job um you know at hand I could even just use my pyro ring that I've got uh stored here I've brought an Axe and a pickaxe just in case if there's anything that I need to harvest over there and see what we can get um the loot have a look at the loot table there didn't appear that there was too much out of that so um I think there was just a little bit of um basic resources so we'll just quickly go ahead and have a look at that if I can ever so tight slightly tap on it so possible loot we've got a purple star Skillet some oil uh The Amulet the necklace uh some books there Oak plank belts and bless water so we'll just jump back right in I should have done that first my bad guys all right guys make sure you guys like like the video if you did enjoy this one here and go ahead and do the usual things comment down below hit the like button subscribe all that sort of good stuff um oh you just the sort of person I need my a ship ran into some trouble uh no sooner did I bring her to rest did Goblin steal my supplies and escape to the swamp bring back my things and I'll give you my lucky Skillet what do you say so we've got to find these items throughout the zone uh and we got a l okay so we might have to find it on one of the Goblins there maybe or something in a in a chest something or other but to be perfectly honest all these little materials here I'm hoping we'll probably find it all in the zone if not I know I've got it everywhere so we'll go ahead and um sus it all out here so we'll probably just grab some uh wood as well while we're doing a little uh questing if it wants to chop down there we go so that's the six pine log there we go yeah guys so um just sort of let you know out of courtesy um I think at the time of this video I should be five subscribers away from hitting my first th000 uh sub Subs so it is it's been a massive Milestone um that I've been wanting to achieve for such a long time and we are so close um yeah look I'm not going to ask for subscribers just for the sake of um you know if you guys are doing it uh to get me there look I want I rather earn it and do it the right way if you guys do enjoy my content and you don't want to miss out on any future videos then please hit that sub button if not um that's all good just hit the like button if you enjoyed it you know just get it up the recommended uh recommended page that's all I asked for on that one there um otherwise you know what just enjoy the videos guys hear my love lovely voice all that sort of good stuff all right so with that out of the way I'm going to keep going so we'll grab some of this and how much wood did we have we have 18 so I need a little bit more wood so I'll just grab one of there and let's see what this area has we got a couple first frogs and does that no it does not okay take out the goblin completed a quest very good ooh got the little um a little scroll there okay we'll s that out in a sec and what's out of here anything interesting I'll take that o look at that got the berry tea if thank you game if you can allow me to actually tap on things that would be great um all right what do we got what do we got anything up here don't think so we'll quickly just scan the area around and anything of Interest not so much I'll just grab that while we're at it anything down this way nope dead end so it doesn't look to be a particularly uh massive map we just take out these guys oh okay so these guys are coming up with swamp Okay swamp map section town to piece used to navigate to the swamp Okay so looks like they might have there might be a few that we need to check out uh so a few little you know map coordinates once we've got the required amount I'm assuming it's going to piece together and we can uh jump into the uh the swamp uh area and hopefully um we'll be able to um find uh the lever I take it in this situation I think that's probably going to be what we're needing to look for I'm not going to worry about the clay at this point I've got so much clay now ever since this new update that's dropped I've got so much clay I it's I'm going to clay bar for days that that's basically what I'm saying um I'm not going to need to you know hunt certain zones or anything like that what problem hey you're a little bit different and why didn't I kill you in the first place take all that and what have we got here nothing there nothing there um I wonder if that's enough I wonder if that is enough well that's a point of Interest by the looks of things just want to see okay I did Kill everything there okay oh okay so I've got all three claim nice and assuming that's going to take us to the swap which it does nice and easy there we go and that will probably take us back to where we came from let's take out these guys I hate these things they they put they put your curse points so high up cuz now if you look at the left hand uh part of the screen where my avatar is uh you'll notice that I've got curse points times three so you just want to be careful with that and I'll just grab all of this so this is um so little drop um you know little chest and things like that kind of like in the the two skull zones that you'll find so you might get like little gifts and things like that raw materials whatever it might be so all right let's see what we got out of this one rets get rid of that mosquito bed and there's another one there I'm just going to go ahead and hit it I'm it's annoying that they don't come up actually on the map so you can't actually see them but I guess that's the whole point of it you know you got to be careful you have your wits about you okay there's that hot bed take that out oops no no no grab the barrel we'll see what's in the barrel here and hopefully we might find what we're looking for I'll take those Scrolls what I might actually do cuz I did bring the horse today let's grab that and that and all the other bits and pieces that I may not need probably that that and there's that and you know what I probably don't even need that today cuz I want to grab that and that perfect get that yellow spider didn't give me anything thank you very much okay did you give me something nope okay all right so I'm just going to do a quick scan there we go something I didn't want to happen it happened that is totally fine so I'll just grab one of those and we are back grab some of that okay so we got a mixture of frogs in here so you got the cursed frog dark frog okay take out you take out you definitely okay I think I've got more than enough um cheese cloths there so I don't think I need any more but anyway okay let's see what's coming out of here grab some of that I'll take that definitely take that okay that and you and you as well and there's no rope usually you guys drop rope okay well that's back to where we came from there was a little section there I didn't cover so we'll go through there now and I didn't see that that okay so a bit of charcoal Goblin leader do you have my leather uh lever lever I don't know why I said leather anyway H it's too early in the morning my time here guys take the nails I do need the nails actually and one more J there we go take out you and I think that did say swamp Goblin it did okay so hopefully okay I think I've noticed that in the update let me know if you guys did where your character didn't actually you didn't see the animation uh to him actually attacking but yet you'd actually see the enemy health bar reduced yeah let me know if you'd actually seen that or if you've experienced that okay well see now he's doing it actually another thing to note as well just using my crossbow I feel that it's a lot slower than um in the previous uh update o dark swamp Goblin okay you're going to have to have what I need just take out that hot bed let's take out the other hot bed I just want to take that out yeah so I think the time delay is a lot more on the crossbow than it was in the previous update I don't know if it's just me I don't know if you guys have experienced that too I want you to let me know in the comments down below yes okay cool so you've got what I need I don't need that I'm going to grab that I don't need any of that I'll just leave that behind loot up the chest and I think that's probably going to go ahead and call it I guess we well you know I'll see what else is need I think we need some raw meat which I didn't get from this Z so I know I've got that at home which is not a problem at all okay um what do I give up I guess I'll use that take that use that and take that there we go and we did loot that didn't we yeah we did okay so I think that's it we'll go sus out now the rest of everything actually I think I I think I do definitely need some meat so let's let's quickly go back home I'll grab the meat cuz I think that's all I need and we'll um yeah we'll finish off this quest for the um for today's video okay sorry I just had a bit of coffee and let's jump back in go and you know what for now I just might dump some of that over here and there and let's just grab the meat I think that's it honestly I think that is but we'll have a look don't want to make a you know complete round trip for everything so it's a good little Quest I mean you know just something to break up uh the norm the mold if you will gives you something uh to do and you got a decent amount of time so I don't see why not that you guys couldn't complete it um you should be able to it it's it appears very easy I don't know what it's going to be for the next um for the next mission um that we'll have but we'll we'll obviously work it out when the time comes all right so let's go ahead and claim everything so we need that that that that that and that claim that's it that's it so he's not going to so we can't interact with him anymore um as I said we've only got a day a little bit over a day for that to um for this Zone to leave but let's go ahead and check out the the skillet pan going to swap them over so we have 20 attack damage 16 wall uh 32 awareness 1.2 oh sorry um yeah and then over 500 uh hit points on it which is not bad you know what I think this probably be arguably a decent um uh melee weapon just for you know one to two skull zones if you really wanted to use it and you don't want to use any decent weapons or anything like that I think this would be your go-to um if you want to sort of you know keep it and retain it you probably just want to invest in some uh repair hammers just to get it back up to scratch that's obviously up to you guys but that's what I'm thinking about that it's probably going to be a decent Handler for um for those type of zones but I think we're going to go ahead and leave it today it's just a really quick one just wanted to give you a quick overview on how that works and um yeah shed some lot because unfortunately in the patch notes of the developers didn't really elaborate on it so I figured you know what let's drop this in and hopefully you guys enjoyed anyway if you guys are new if you guys enjoyed the content if you want to watch more if you want to keep up
