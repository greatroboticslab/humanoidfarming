  "text": "as a farmer we all look for a product that all a crop that does not need much of the capital and will give some good returns within the shortest period of time one of these crops is Los coco beans the demand for beans consumption has been on the rise as consumptions increases most people are preferring cereals and this has made it demand to continue increase remember it's also widely consumed by in high schools and even some of the primary schools so it's rare when you farm this L cocoa beans for you not to get good Market a bag of 90 kg of L coco beans ages between 7,000 in high Supply season to 15,000 or even 18,000 in a shortage Seasons so this is a product that you can manage to farm and get some good results as long as you do it collect remember having cost does not guarantee profit you have to do it right and also you have to maximize maintaining your cost as low as possible so that you have good profit margin and also you manage to get high yield if you're new to this channel consider subscribing I'm Kelvin from farmworks we do Empower Farmers by providing solutions to their daily farming challenges consider subscribing also don't forget to share these videos with with your friends this is the only way that you can help us continue empowering more and more Farmers now we jump right into it now lose coco beans are first draw to tolerant and then also they tend to grow fast within 90 days in AA you need an average of 16 to 20 kg that's a seed rate also for beans and this is a general rule for all beans you don't have to do it in fertile soils actually we have observed a be done in deep fertile soils those extremely fertile soils they tend not to do well and by doing well I mean you find that that bean it looks very good it's a very healthy has a lot of forage like it has a lot of leaves but the number of PS that it produces are minimal and even the bean size is very very minimal okay and that's why we even commend when you're doing beans if your soil is very very fertile don't add manure also we also don't add a lot of Dap You just use very very small amount and if you can manage not to do with it it's still fine it's a way of reducing cost however if you farming in an area that is completely infertile you need to add manure at to sustain this crop beans tend to do well in Sunday L SS and the tend to grow well in well drained soils okay so if your soils tend to flat or if the soils are cray and they don't support much this may tend to frustrate you so if you have a well drained s soils that's okay for you you can do L cocoa beans how to plant it it's very simple and it's very very easy you just need to do you can do holes or you can do follows or the Met system then as Bing of let's say from one line to the other you can do 30 to 40 cm then from one being to the other you can do roughly 20 to 25 cm personally I prefer planting with both holes so that I can manage to if the soil is infertile to AO manure and then also I can manage to do some good spacing and also it's not that much involving it's easier to dig holes than the follow I put two seeds per hole so that in case one does not germinate the other one will germinate uh nowadays it's easier they all certified seeds like the L Coco glp to from Kenya seed and also from East Africa seed and if you cannot manage to buy these certified seeds also you can buy from the normal seral store St okay so the normal Rose Coco that you buy for 18 you can still brand it as long as as long as you select the one that are not dented the one that don't have holes and then the on that are very very healthy once you plant them the performance will still be super good remember for the one that is certified and this other one in CL store there's no that much difference actually the only difference that I observe is that the certified seed is treated it's well selected and these are that you buy from it's not treated and remember you can treat your own seeds with like Molano super and still perform well okay but to cut the cost I would go for the normal L cocoa beans from the market they still do very very well now after you've planted don't plant extremely deep you plant just shallowly if your sty is not F you can also consider top dressing with d this is often 10 to 14 days after germination for those who have watched our previous videos you have observed that we recommend you applying dap fertilizers on 10 to 14th days after sewing or even transplanting this enhances faster absorption and prevent reaching as the crop will have developed substantial loot hairs that will help to absorb the nitrogen and the phosphorus in the fertilizers okay and also ensure that while you're tring the C is wet and also ensure that the fertilizer does not come into contact with the leaves after that you can continue doing your normal weeding the farm should always remain clean nowadays the good thing is that you don't have to incur that much of cost especially when you're doing manual weeding there are a lot of selective post and pre-emergence herbicides for controlling weeds in beans Farms good example is Bean screen and also Mr Bean plus these are good selective post and preim herbicides that work very very efficiently the only condition with the one is that you don't they don't work in intercrop FS remember B you can intercrop them with MS and when you intercop the apping face selective herdes will kill the m and leave the beans alone so these herdes only works where beans are planted alone okay it's easier because it reduces the cost of the cost of doing hiring workers to come and plow to come and do the we and also it does the efficiency because sometimes you hire these workers they come and do so I'm sure work of weeding but when you apply this chemical it's cheap okay and remember all these chemicals you can manage to get them from our farm shop and we do delivery Countrywide and even outside the country so this is one of the best method to control weight after that there are things that you need to control one are feet and the other one is diseases such as the blight Lea flast the common one is Lea FL and Lea Sport and the likes of otheros now first for AIDS what you can do is you apply ther Inc side especially especially from from 20th day after sewing 20th to 28th day you can apply Thunder and you can repeat it after one week this will help you manage all the outfits that may infest your beans then from there for all these fungal diseases you can use nativo it's a good it's a good fun Fung side that will help you control all these uh fungicides especially the Lea FL you can also use sometimes little meal for any early or late bright and even sometimes you can use infinitor infin it's a very good it's a very very good fungicide that you can also use to control all this remember I've not mentioned the use of uh boosters or F fertilizers because when you apply most of these nitrogen Rich fertilizers on cereal what they do they boost the leaves development and the leaves growth okay but your intention is not to harvest the leaves your intention is to harvest the pot and when you enhance leaves growth and when you enhance Le uh development what you do you minimize the ability of the port and you minimize the size of the beans form actually it interferes with the leav you call it the Le PS ratio okay so the higher the number of leaves the lower the harest of beans that you get but you can apply some of this like the Bon that will help in preventing flowers abortion the other thing that I really want to warn farmers you don't do weeding on beans Farm when it's raining this to prevent the prevent of fungal diseases that that tend to destroy all your farm and that's why you observe if you've done weeding when it's training or there was some uh light showers you will observe that they tend to turn yellow after completing the weding and most of the time they lose the leaves and when they lose the leaves also they reduce the ability of making their own food and the beans as well reducing and roaring the whole thing okay the best thing is that at the end of all once you manage all this you control all the weeds bottom line is that it is possible for you to harvest at least 10 bags and above per of L coo beans and remember you planted 16 to 20 kgs okay and the if you do the MS the fertilizer the chemical you find the cost are very very very minimal now before I leave I I would really love to hear your view and also your comment have you tried it did it disappoint you did it do well also we tell you Farmers that this is a platform where we sharpen each other don't if it did well for you share the tips so that other farmers can continue learning and we can continue sharpening each other",
