  "text": "are several types of small fruit and berries that are produced in pop culture in greenhouse an outdoor production those crops include things such as strawberries raspberries blueberries crops like that the ideal growing media for all the various types of small fruit will depend on basically the grower preference the container size and the cultural practices that they experience so there's and the nice thing is with our Pro mix product line we offer products that can cater to these different needs as I mentioned there are several mixes that can apply to the specific needs of a customer it depends on what your specific needs are for instance if you're looking to use a mix that you can app inside the greenhouse for smaller containers maybe gallon size or smaller product that would probably work out for you either the pro xvx mycorrhizae which is combination of peat perlite and vermiculite or the pro makes LP 15 which is combination of peat and perlite both products have high water high of high water holding capacity so they don't dry out very rapidly so they're great to use during the summer months but they still have good aeration they're lightweight so they're easy to handle and for trent and easy to transport now for still for indoor production in small containers up to much larger containers and especially outdoor production we would recommend some of our bark base growing media we have two Canadian products the pro mates BRK and PRK 20 as well as two products from our plant in Matawan in Virginia which would be our pro mix BK 25 in BK 55 all these products are peaked bark based with perlite added and the idea of having the bark in there is it gives a little bit extra drainage so it's ideal for transitioning not only for greenhouse crop production but also for the outdoor production of fruits and the extra weight from the bark will also prevent the pots from tipping over especially in the wind so between the bark and the perlite providing extra drainage they're actually good mixes to use even for the winter months as well now bark mixes in general do tend to draw a little bit faster than the bx and even a little bit faster in the HP did I mention for so little so this will help minimize any issues with diseases bark also is a great material used for long-term crop production another reason why it's good for pots are larger than gallon size because the bark itself doesn't shrink in the pot or decomposes quickly another option if you're looking for a greenhouse mix or even an outdoor mix that has very high water retention we recommend our promix HP CC this is a combination of peat chunk coir and perlite and the chunk coir itself likes to retain a lot of water and give it back to the growing media as a crop is growing so you don't need to water the product as often so it's ideal especially for summer growing in larger containers especially indoors or outdoors for organic production of small fruit we recommend the pro mix MP MP is a combination of peat core and perlite it's ideal for year-round production of small fruit and gallon sized containers are smaller it does have a higher water attention very similar to our B X and L P 15 so there's less so it doesn't need to be water quite as frequently there is no compost added to this product so you don't get that plugging up the pores which kind of limits oxygen to the root system so you get an active growing root system which helps produce faster growth and a faster crop time now however what does make pro-mix unique is not so much the different types of mixes but the but the active ingredients that we can add to it the active ingredients are essentially natural organisms that have been extracted from the soil they're not genetically modified so the first one we offer is our mycorrhizae mycorrhizae is a vesicular Arbus killer endo mycorrhizal fungi called Glomus enter a disease it will colonize small the roots of small fruits of all plants except for blueberries now in that case the micro Zee doesn't cause any problems for the blueberries the blueberries just simply don't utilize it but for all the other plants you're gonna get increased uptake of nutrients because essentially once the mycorrhizae colonizes the root system it grows out past the root system where roots are not present to bring in water and nutrients where the roots are not available therefore it more efficiently mines out the growing media for nutrients and for water so think of mycorrhizae is kind of an extension of the root system so what how does that benefit you well first of all because it can acquire the nutrients of water more efficiently it delays the onset of nutrient deficiency symptoms as well as it delays the onset of wilting it also increases resistance from environmental stresses in addition to that and as a result when you're transitioning maybe from a smaller container size to a larger size you don't see the transplant shock delay that normally occurs and on top of it you also get faster plant establishment you get better initial growth and better sustained growth especially if there's stress involved bottom line larger plants will produce more fruit the second active ingredient is our bio fungicide it's a bacterium called bacillus subsys it colonizes the root system of all small fruit plants and it's present throughout the entire crop cycle of that plant it basically will suppress root rots caused by the fungal pathogens Alternaria Fusarium Pythium and Rhizoctonia it will reduce fungicide drenches by up to 50% so that's great news whether you have to drench him inside the greenhouse or if you're growing them outside in some cases that completely eliminates a need for the fungicide drenches because the root system is healthier so the bottom line is you save money on those fungicides they also helps to reduce plant loss so obviously the lower your plant losses the more plants you have to sell and therefore you can increase your crop production simply from that fact alone and third would be the combination of both the bio fungicide and the mycorrhizae together so there you will get the benefits of both organisms in one product you",
