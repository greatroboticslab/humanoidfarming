2
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:14,960
hello this is my fully automatic fully

3
00:00:12,759 --> 00:00:18,080
expandable and customizable create crop

4
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:20,600
Farm which uses the Gantry Carriage

5
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,840
system so first I'm going to explain how

6
00:00:20,600 --> 00:00:24,119
the machine works and we're going to

7
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:25,800
build it if you've seen my tree farm

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,320
Design This is essentially the same

9
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:30,480
machine but without the flipping saw so

10
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:32,680
let's get into it this is essentially

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
our main machine we have Harvesters

12
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:37,239
connected to a Gantry Carriage which

13
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,440
goes along our Gantry shaft here we have

14
00:00:37,239 --> 00:00:41,200
two Redstone contacts on each end of the

15
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:43,160
Gantry shaft to detect when the

16
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,360
Harvester has arrived on either end of

17
00:00:43,160 --> 00:00:47,360
the machine each of the Redstone contact

18
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,920
is connected to a redstone link when our

19
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,079
Harvester arrives at either end of the

20
00:00:48,920 --> 00:00:52,719
farm our Redstone contact will send a

21
00:00:51,079 --> 00:00:54,760
redstone signal through this link which

22
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,600
will then be received by this Redstone

23
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:58,600
receiver this Redstone receiver will

24
00:00:56,600 --> 00:01:00,559
then send a signal to toggle or toggle

25
00:00:58,600 --> 00:01:03,120
LEDs which will then power or on power

26
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:04,879
our gearshift this gear shift if powered

27
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:07,920
will then reverse the rotation of our

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:10,759
Gantry shaft moving the machine back and

29
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:12,560
forth a ganty cage will move along the

30
00:01:10,759 --> 00:01:15,159
ganty shaft depending on its

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,320
rotation if we reverse the rotation the

32
00:01:15,159 --> 00:01:19,439
ganty cage will come towards us and if

33
00:01:17,320 --> 00:01:21,680
we don't the gany cage will move away

34
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,040
from us so this is mainly how we're

35
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,240
moving our Harvesters here now this you

36
00:01:24,040 --> 00:01:28,200
know how the farm Works let's build it

37
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:30,640
first set up your Gantry shaft this can

38
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:32,799
be as long or short as you need then

39
00:01:30,640 --> 00:01:35,040
Place The ganty Carriage on one end and

40
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:37,920
linear chassis on top of it now this can

41
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,640
be as long or short as you need as well

42
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,560
then you want to put your Harvesters on

43
00:01:39,640 --> 00:01:42,560
both sides of the

44
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:46,960
chassis once that's done you want to put

45
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:48,920
the Redstone contacts on both ends of

46
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:50,479
the Gantry carriage and then you want to

47
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:53,280
put the connections to those Redstone

48
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:55,200
contacts from the other end skip one

49
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,560
block and put it

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:01,719
here then you want to connect Redstone

51
00:01:57,560 --> 00:02:02,920
links to your Redstone contacts

52
00:02:01,719 --> 00:02:05,000
then you want to give your machine some

53
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,280
storage and a portable storage interface

54
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,000
for the output and then you can finally

55
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,000
glue them all

56
00:02:11,040 --> 00:02:15,760
together um quick note on either end of

57
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:17,840
your gante shaft skip one block before

58
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,760
you start planting your crops if you

59
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:22,360
start planting your crops here or here

60
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:23,440
um your crops will be uprooted because

61
00:02:22,360 --> 00:02:24,680
this is where your machine is going to

62
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:27,720
rest every time it's going to change

63
00:02:24,680 --> 00:02:29,519
directions so just from this one end

64
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:31,879
skip one block and then this is where

65
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:34,280
you start planting same on this side as

66
00:02:31,879 --> 00:02:35,519
well this is the end of the ganed cage

67
00:02:34,280 --> 00:02:38,000
skip one block this is where you're

68
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,239
going to start planting your crops when

69
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,200
that's all done you want to connect your

70
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,159
gante shaft to two normal shafts and

71
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:46,239
then here you can connect your gear

72
00:02:44,159 --> 00:02:48,239
shift if you connect your gear shift

73
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:49,920
here um these Redstone contacts will

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,480
power your gear shift and it will break

75
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,560
your machine so just skip two uh leave

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:56,159
these two alone and then put your gear

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:58,319
shift here then you want to connect your

78
00:02:56,159 --> 00:02:59,640
gear shift to a toggled power lch if you

79
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,680
don't want an off switch you can just

80
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:03,440
put put the rest link directly next to

81
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:05,480
the toggle power ledge but if you want

82
00:03:03,440 --> 00:03:07,959
an off switch place a block next to the

83
00:03:05,480 --> 00:03:10,239
toggle power ledge skip one block place

84
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,040
your link here a normal repeater facing

85
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:15,480
into the block a sticky piston facing to

86
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:19,120
the block and a lever to toggle the off

87
00:03:15,480 --> 00:03:20,879
switch this is on this is off now very

88
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,720
important you need to set up a unique

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,599
frequency for your Redstone link so it

90
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,760
doesn't mess up with other Redstone l in

91
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:28,519
your world this example we're going to

92
00:03:26,760 --> 00:03:31,959
use a sticky piston

93
00:03:28,519 --> 00:03:33,840
here and also to make a redstone link

94
00:03:31,959 --> 00:03:36,799
into a receiver you can either shift

95
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:38,360
right click or you can use a wrench as

96
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,680
you can see it's now getting powered

97
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:42,680
because it's on the same frequency so to

98
00:03:40,680 --> 00:03:44,480
turn the machine on just flip the lever

99
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:47,040
and there you go the machine is

100
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,040
on another quick note rotation speed

101
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:50,840
doesn't really matter if your rotation

102
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:53,319
speed is faster that means your

103
00:03:50,840 --> 00:03:55,040
Harvester will go faster um but it does

104
00:03:53,319 --> 00:03:57,519
generally affect the performance of the

105
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,519
farm so yeah you can put just one water

106
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:01,040
wheel or however much you need right now

107
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:04,000
for just take of example we're using a

108
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:06,280
32 RPM uh water wheel but yeah you can

109
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:09,079
make this into an 8 RPM or like a 16 RPM

110
00:04:06,280 --> 00:04:10,599
it doesn't matter it's all good so now

111
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:12,480
the last thing to do is to set up your

112
00:04:10,599 --> 00:04:14,480
output your storage output so what you

113
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,639
want to do is to find your ganty cage

114
00:04:14,480 --> 00:04:18,880
skip one block so it's here and then you

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:22,079
want to find the level at which your

116
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:25,560
storage output is on the machine itself

117
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:27,840
you want to put it here nope want to put

118
00:04:25,560 --> 00:04:30,759
it here facing towards the machine you

119
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:32,400
want to set up a funnel and two chests

120
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,000
and you have a choot above it you can

121
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,919
either use hoppers or shoots whatever

122
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:39,160
you need so there basically the machine

123
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:42,280
set up now as you can see this will

124
00:04:39,160 --> 00:04:43,080
unload the crops into our shoot and into

125
00:04:42,280 --> 00:04:46,120
the

126
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:48,160
chest that is it for the fully automatic

127
00:04:46,120 --> 00:04:50,039
fully customizable and expandable crop

128
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,560
Farm using the create mode I hope you

129
00:04:50,039 --> 00:04:55,320
enjoyed this video and I will see you in

130
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:55,320
the next one bye-bye
