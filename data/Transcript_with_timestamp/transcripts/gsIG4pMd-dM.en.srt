[Music]

2
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,070
what I do to make our goats know this is

3
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:27,070
a recipe that a couple shared with me

4
00:00:24,070 --> 00:00:29,289
that it has goats already and they said

5
00:00:27,070 --> 00:00:31,480
this is a little bit more gentle on

6
00:00:29,289 --> 00:00:34,900
their stomach than the powdered mix at

7
00:00:31,480 --> 00:00:36,640
the like flea farm or like country

8
00:00:34,900 --> 00:00:39,610
stores and stuff like that this won't

9
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:41,710
cause them to have an upset stomach or

10
00:00:39,610 --> 00:00:43,449
get sick from it I know there's a bunch

11
00:00:41,710 --> 00:00:46,840
of different mixes out there that you

12
00:00:43,449 --> 00:00:50,350
can use for baby goats and the goats

13
00:00:46,840 --> 00:00:52,270
that we have were nursed until we got

14
00:00:50,350 --> 00:00:55,420
them so when we got them they're only

15
00:00:52,270 --> 00:00:57,489
two weeks old and then I had to fight

16
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:00,460
off you then so I'm gonna show you

17
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:05,020
exactly what I do and the recipe that

18
00:01:00,460 --> 00:01:08,920
was shared to me to use for them and so

19
00:01:05,020 --> 00:01:10,899
far it's been I think like six days so

20
00:01:08,920 --> 00:01:12,910
far on here and so far they've been

21
00:01:10,899 --> 00:01:15,340
doing really good you guys can kind of

22
00:01:12,910 --> 00:01:18,069
see in the video they do really well

23
00:01:15,340 --> 00:01:24,190
with it so I'm gonna share with you what

24
00:01:18,069 --> 00:01:29,789
I do for that so what we use is whole

25
00:01:24,190 --> 00:01:34,690
milk buttermilk and then evaporated milk

26
00:01:29,789 --> 00:01:41,410
so what I was told to do is pour out as

27
00:01:34,690 --> 00:01:44,349
much milk as maybe like maybe four cups

28
00:01:41,410 --> 00:01:47,080
or so just so I have enough room in my

29
00:01:44,349 --> 00:01:50,170
gallon of milk to add the things that I

30
00:01:47,080 --> 00:01:52,390
need to add so the only thing that I

31
00:01:50,170 --> 00:01:57,869
really need to measure out it is the

32
00:01:52,390 --> 00:01:57,869
better buttermilk and that is just a cup

33
00:01:58,210 --> 00:02:06,260
[Music]

34
00:01:59,950 --> 00:02:18,140
okay so a cup of buttermilk goes right

35
00:02:06,260 --> 00:02:22,420
in the gallon a whole can of you've ever

36
00:02:18,140 --> 00:02:22,420
that's not gonna go over very well

37
00:02:24,250 --> 00:02:29,540
okay so much easier if you use a funnel

38
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,690
because then I can just dump it right in

39
00:02:29,540 --> 00:02:31,690
there

40
00:02:31,750 --> 00:02:39,980
still then I add that and there's only

41
00:02:36,440 --> 00:02:43,730
just like enough in there that and then

42
00:02:39,980 --> 00:02:45,590
I just pour what I can for the rest of

43
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:53,510
the milk in there to make it a full

44
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:55,280
gallon then you just shake it up so I'm

45
00:02:53,510 --> 00:02:58,220
gonna go ahead right away and make them

46
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,590
some bottles because they need to feed

47
00:02:58,220 --> 00:03:03,170
right now but I want to share with you

48
00:03:00,590 --> 00:03:06,140
how I made that the rest of the milk I

49
00:03:03,170 --> 00:03:14,660
just dumped in the other gallon that we

50
00:03:06,140 --> 00:03:20,630
have in the fridge so then I write on

51
00:03:14,660 --> 00:03:27,590
here that it is goat milk so nobody

52
00:03:20,630 --> 00:03:33,530
accidentally grabs the Hat

53
00:03:27,590 --> 00:03:36,319
and what I do for feeding them and the

54
00:03:33,530 --> 00:03:40,580
measurement I used for that is I take

55
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:45,489
one of our just like a mason jar but

56
00:03:40,580 --> 00:03:53,209
this is like a smaller smaller jar I

57
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:56,360
fill it up all the way to the top so I

58
00:03:53,209 --> 00:04:00,830
go all the way then I put it in the

59
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:03,430
microwave for a minute and thirty

60
00:04:00,830 --> 00:04:03,430
seconds

61
00:04:03,700 --> 00:04:10,940
I'll go put this stuff away while that's

62
00:04:06,230 --> 00:04:14,930
in there and then I will show you what

63
00:04:10,940 --> 00:04:17,840
bottles I'm using okay so the bottles

64
00:04:14,930 --> 00:04:19,700
that we're using are just regular soda

65
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:24,620
bottles I have them labeled in their

66
00:04:19,700 --> 00:04:28,340
name and then these we got from the

67
00:04:24,620 --> 00:04:30,590
tractor supply place in area bio so that

68
00:04:28,340 --> 00:04:34,190
fits on there this is what we were told

69
00:04:30,590 --> 00:04:38,450
to use from the couple that helped me

70
00:04:34,190 --> 00:04:41,840
with deciding what milk to use and then

71
00:04:38,450 --> 00:04:43,820
with one of our goats the little one he

72
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:47,060
is having a problem with drinking down

73
00:04:43,820 --> 00:04:49,250
to this one so I went and got a baby

74
00:04:47,060 --> 00:04:52,370
bottle that has like a slow flow to it

75
00:04:49,250 --> 00:04:55,100
and he does much better on this one so I

76
00:04:52,370 --> 00:04:56,780
still want to keep this around just in

77
00:04:55,100 --> 00:04:59,539
case he gets a little bit better but

78
00:04:56,780 --> 00:05:01,610
they only are on a bottle for a period

79
00:04:59,539 --> 00:05:03,020
of time and then eventually we will wean

80
00:05:01,610 --> 00:05:05,570
them off and they won't be using it

81
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,439
anyway so but right now this is what I'm

82
00:05:05,570 --> 00:05:23,229
using and I will show you the

83
00:05:08,439 --> 00:05:29,979
that each of them get okay so I for

84
00:05:23,229 --> 00:05:32,139
opals I fill it all the way up to like

85
00:05:29,979 --> 00:05:34,029
there's kind of like a line right here

86
00:05:32,139 --> 00:05:36,519
so I kind of fill it up to there or

87
00:05:34,029 --> 00:05:40,709
almost there and I already have it

88
00:05:36,519 --> 00:05:40,709
measured out that she's getting 8 ounces

89
00:05:54,540 --> 00:05:59,100
so that's a holes bottle

90
00:06:02,120 --> 00:06:09,570
and with Winchester's I only need just a

91
00:06:06,510 --> 00:06:12,950
little bit so he only drinks like like

92
00:06:09,570 --> 00:06:16,530
an ounce or two maybe he's not he's the

93
00:06:12,950 --> 00:06:19,190
the Nigerian Dwarf one so he doesn't

94
00:06:16,530 --> 00:06:19,190
drink as much

95
00:06:31,040 --> 00:06:36,110
so he won't even drink all of that but

96
00:06:34,250 --> 00:06:39,530
that's that's how I make their bottles

97
00:06:36,110 --> 00:06:41,270
so they do get warm more models and we

98
00:06:39,530 --> 00:06:43,190
will go to go feed them right now and

99
00:06:41,270 --> 00:06:46,220
you'll see how good they're doing today

100
00:06:43,190 --> 00:06:49,430
and today is Friday so now they will

101
00:06:46,220 --> 00:06:51,890
need three weeks old and they're doing

102
00:06:49,430 --> 00:07:00,590
much better on their bottle so we'll go

103
00:06:51,890 --> 00:07:04,390
out and do that okay oppa usually does

104
00:07:00,590 --> 00:07:06,740
really good and we got a new bottle for

105
00:07:04,390 --> 00:07:11,240
Winchester because other one comes out

106
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:14,330
too fast so you can tell that he does

107
00:07:11,240 --> 00:07:17,540
much better with this one before he was

108
00:07:14,330 --> 00:07:21,230
kind of choking on the other one and

109
00:07:17,540 --> 00:07:25,010
opal right here does really good I can't

110
00:07:21,230 --> 00:07:27,530
really show you very go there yeah so

111
00:07:25,010 --> 00:07:30,680
opal pretty much like Downton's hers

112
00:07:27,530 --> 00:07:35,690
like really quick and winchester doesn't

113
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:39,320
usually drink all of his so he only gets

114
00:07:35,690 --> 00:07:41,630
like one or two ounces because that's

115
00:07:39,320 --> 00:07:44,870
all he pretty much does and she gets

116
00:07:41,630 --> 00:07:49,340
like eight ounces and she drinks all of

117
00:07:44,870 --> 00:07:52,580
hers so so tomorrow will be a week with

118
00:07:49,340 --> 00:07:55,520
these guys and you guys can tell from

119
00:07:52,580 --> 00:07:59,720
the beginning of the video on how we had

120
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:04,550
to kind of force-feed Winchester the

121
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:09,140
battle and now he knows exactly what to

122
00:08:04,550 --> 00:08:12,030
do but we kind of had to I kind of kept

123
00:08:09,140 --> 00:08:15,360
up with like a schedule

124
00:08:12,030 --> 00:08:17,760
for them so I kind of kept up with a

125
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:20,220
schedule for them so that when we open

126
00:08:17,760 --> 00:08:23,670
the door to their little crate thing

127
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:27,480
that they get a bottle and then then

128
00:08:23,670 --> 00:08:30,090
it's playtime so this is their afternoon

129
00:08:27,480 --> 00:08:33,560
feeding and then they'll get tumor

130
00:08:30,090 --> 00:08:37,289
feedings today yet and they get some hay

131
00:08:33,560 --> 00:08:39,120
some water and then one they're outside

132
00:08:37,289 --> 00:08:42,120
they get to graze on the grass and stuff

133
00:08:39,120 --> 00:08:44,940
like that and now that it's nicer out

134
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:48,360
they get to get out more often and then

135
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:51,210
eventually we'll have them just in like

136
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,550
a little barn or a little shed things

137
00:08:51,210 --> 00:08:57,320
for them so right now we want to keep

138
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:57,320
them close so we can bottle feed them

139
00:08:57,920 --> 00:09:01,550
oboes almost done

140
00:09:05,920 --> 00:10:22,570
