1
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,049
in preparation for hurricane season it'd

2
00:00:07,290 --> 00:00:12,150
be a good idea for livestock producers

3
00:00:10,049 --> 00:00:13,710
to review their their health program

4
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:16,200
because there's always the potential

5
00:00:13,710 --> 00:00:19,529
that animals may be relocated to a

6
00:00:16,200 --> 00:00:21,660
shelter or another farm to get them out

7
00:00:19,529 --> 00:00:24,119
of dangerous way and the other situation

8
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:25,289
that could arise is you know storms can

9
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:28,560
do a lot of damage

10
00:00:25,289 --> 00:00:30,570
knock fences down and potentially then

11
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:32,610
in that situation animals could go

12
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:34,019
mingle with other herds as well and just

13
00:00:32,610 --> 00:00:37,140
be exposed to other infectious diseases

14
00:00:34,019 --> 00:00:38,760
so so having a herd health program up to

15
00:00:37,140 --> 00:00:41,190
date having vaccinations up to date

16
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:45,600
would be a good thing another situation

17
00:00:41,190 --> 00:00:47,670
that that could arise is when animals

18
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,980
are commingled trying to get them back

19
00:00:47,670 --> 00:00:51,960
to their proper owner so animal

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,730
identification is very important and it

21
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:55,620
needs to be unique animal identification

22
00:00:53,730 --> 00:00:58,440
something that is specific to that

23
00:00:55,620 --> 00:01:02,690
animal into that farm and so for example

24
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:05,430
hot brands USDA e mental ear tags

25
00:01:02,690 --> 00:01:08,220
electronic identification tags those

26
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:10,470
would all be potentially unique animal

27
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:12,930
identification as opposed to say a

28
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:14,400
dangle tag with just a number on it

29
00:01:12,930 --> 00:01:16,799
you know there's a lot of there's a lot

30
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:19,140
of black cows in Alabama that probably

31
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:20,340
have an ear tag number 26 in their year

32
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:22,590
for example so it needs to be something

33
00:01:20,340 --> 00:01:24,869
unique to that particular animal so that

34
00:01:22,590 --> 00:01:26,939
that people can get the animals back to

35
00:01:24,869 --> 00:01:28,799
their to their proper farms of course

36
00:01:26,939 --> 00:01:32,580
making sure that you have all the

37
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:35,240
equipment on hand that you need to to

38
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:38,009
respond to to a potential disaster

39
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,610
making sure that you have feed and water

40
00:01:38,009 --> 00:01:43,409
available and in storage for one to two

41
00:01:41,610 --> 00:01:45,930
weeks potentially for stored feed it

42
00:01:43,409 --> 00:01:48,210
needs to be stored in a dry safe place

43
00:01:45,930 --> 00:01:50,990
and it needs to be someplace that's

44
00:01:48,210 --> 00:01:55,290
that's fairly secure so that you do have

45
00:01:50,990 --> 00:01:58,350
good healthy wholesome feed to provide

46
00:01:55,290 --> 00:02:01,649
your your livestock after a disaster if

47
00:01:58,350 --> 00:02:04,619
you're on a well water source having

48
00:02:01,649 --> 00:02:09,750
hand pumps or generators available in

49
00:02:04,619 --> 00:02:11,700
case electricity is disrupted would be

50
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,980
would be all the important things to

51
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:15,660
consider ahead of time livestock

52
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:18,210
producers should prioritize their

53
00:02:15,660 --> 00:02:20,820
animals so that they can be sure that

54
00:02:18,210 --> 00:02:22,380
those animals if animals do have the

55
00:02:20,820 --> 00:02:25,260
opportunity or the need to be evacuated

56
00:02:22,380 --> 00:02:28,770
those animals with a high priority can

57
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:31,680
then be evacuated first or looked after

58
00:02:28,770 --> 00:02:33,690
first if the producer knew which animals

59
00:02:31,680 --> 00:02:35,780
were maybe getting ready to calve or a

60
00:02:33,690 --> 00:02:38,420
kid or phone whatever the case may be

61
00:02:35,780 --> 00:02:40,530
put them in in a location where they can

62
00:02:38,420 --> 00:02:42,870
maybe check on them

63
00:02:40,530 --> 00:02:45,330
first to make sure that there haven't

64
00:02:42,870 --> 00:02:47,370
been any complications or any issues

65
00:02:45,330 --> 00:02:49,260
that arise during the during the storm

66
00:02:47,370 --> 00:02:49,860
if you are in an area that is prone to

67
00:02:49,260 --> 00:02:52,350
flooding

68
00:02:49,860 --> 00:02:55,200
for example move move your animals to

69
00:02:52,350 --> 00:02:56,790
higher ground and ideally keep them out

70
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,580
of barns they're usually going to be

71
00:02:56,790 --> 00:03:01,890
better left in large open spaces as

72
00:02:59,580 --> 00:03:03,960
opposed to confined to a barn the last

73
00:03:01,890 --> 00:03:05,490
thing you want to do is put your animals

74
00:03:03,960 --> 00:03:06,960
in there and then have the storm destroy

75
00:03:05,490 --> 00:03:08,010
that building with all your animals in

76
00:03:06,960 --> 00:03:11,150
it so they're usually going to be better

77
00:03:08,010 --> 00:03:13,350
off on high ground in large open spaces

78
00:03:11,150 --> 00:03:15,420
particularly if the horses are not used

79
00:03:13,350 --> 00:03:17,610
to being out in the pasture in that

80
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:20,130
situation it may be safer and a better

81
00:03:17,610 --> 00:03:22,290
idea to leave them in a stall in a

82
00:03:20,130 --> 00:03:24,540
secure building because last thing you'd

83
00:03:22,290 --> 00:03:26,730
want to have happen is a storm to come

84
00:03:24,540 --> 00:03:30,690
in scare the horses frighten the horses

85
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:32,220
and and they you know don't know how to

86
00:03:30,690 --> 00:03:35,130
handle that don't know what to do and

87
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:37,880
they may end up injuring themselves more

88
00:03:35,130 --> 00:03:37,880
so than the storm

89
00:03:44,460 --> 00:03:46,520
you
