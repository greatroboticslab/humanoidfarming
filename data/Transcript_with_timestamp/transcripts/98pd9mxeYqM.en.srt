succeed in Peak farming the general

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:42,360
answer to the mind of U people that are

19
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:44,920
not very much uh knowledgeable on how uh

20
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:47,120
animal vandry is being run probably they

21
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:50,399
are very much ignorant the very

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:52,640
important answer or ignorant answer

23
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,320
rather that many people will give you is

24
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,559
money the answer will be money the money

25
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:59,440
is what you need for you to be

26
00:00:56,559 --> 00:01:02,320
successful in farming in Peak farming or

27
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,680
in any other animal husbandry well as as

28
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:06,520
much as this is partially true you need

29
00:01:04,680 --> 00:01:08,799
money to run lots of great things on

30
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:10,680
your farm but it's not absolutely true

31
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,280
you can literally have enough money

32
00:01:10,680 --> 00:01:16,320
sufficient money abundant money and

33
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:19,240
still not succeed in Pak farming and in

34
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:21,840
any other agricultural

35
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,720
Venture now the question then is what

36
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:27,520
exactly do you need to succeed in Pak

37
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,920
farming what do you really need uh if

38
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,040
money is not the answer which I can

39
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,479
literally prove that to you because uh

40
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:34,240
if you check the internet I'm sure I

41
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:36,240
could probably if you need it I could

42
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:37,799
probably show you the video uh snow

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,119
farming for instance I I already told

44
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,399
you guys that um uh I have I have

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,119
experience when it comes to snail

46
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:47,960
farming and I'll bringing videos and

47
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,159
content on snail far s farming very soon

48
00:01:47,960 --> 00:01:52,320
and and several other agricultural uh

49
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,079
Ventures because I've doubled and I've

50
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:57,960
delved into several of them I was

51
00:01:54,079 --> 00:02:00,560
successful in almost all of them now in

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,920
there's a video online that I like Ed a

53
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:04,960
farmer that spent I think about 8

54
00:02:02,920 --> 00:02:07,600
million or there when I got to research

55
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:11,080
on it or something about 8 million in

56
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:14,519
building is new pen 8 million and the

57
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:17,560
farm was failing 8 million NRA and the

58
00:02:14,519 --> 00:02:20,640
farm was failing this is very clear if

59
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:22,920
money was what it takes for you to uh be

60
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:25,480
successful in farming or in any other

61
00:02:22,920 --> 00:02:27,440
animal H bandry then that guy that

62
00:02:25,480 --> 00:02:30,360
person should be making it because 8

63
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:33,200
million is quite a number of a H amount

64
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:36,040
of money now and this young man right

65
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,480
here talking to you did not even spend

66
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:41,720
I'm not sure I spent up to 100,000 you

67
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:43,840
know I literally if you if when I I walk

68
00:02:41,720 --> 00:02:46,959
you through the story very soon but I

69
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:49,319
remember building a small um a one of

70
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,440
the pen for about 30,000 one of the pens

71
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,360
I build and some other of course I buil

72
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:55,239
some other ones and I was making it

73
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:58,239
greatly when it comes to snail farming I

74
00:02:55,239 --> 00:03:01,400
had lots of snails I had abundant snails

75
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,680
it was so much that the issue was space

76
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:06,200
I told you already in a previous video

77
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:08,799
that the issue I always had when it

78
00:03:06,200 --> 00:03:11,799
comes to animaland in many cases was

79
00:03:08,799 --> 00:03:14,440
space space was the issue getting enough

80
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:17,280
space to run the farm

81
00:03:14,440 --> 00:03:19,239
so I was able to run through snow

82
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,400
farming without the number of cash that

83
00:03:19,239 --> 00:03:23,080
person had telling you already that of

84
00:03:21,400 --> 00:03:24,799
course I needed cash to do something

85
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:26,879
that's why you can't rule out money when

86
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:28,400
it comes to succeeding in animal laundry

87
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:29,959
but it's not everything you need what

88
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:31,599
you really need are some of the things

89
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,519
I'll be mentioning in this video all

90
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:36,000
right one of the things you need is

91
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:38,360
building great relationship you need to

92
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:39,879
build great relationship many of you

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:41,480
will not understand what I'm saying

94
00:03:39,879 --> 00:03:43,599
until when you get into it then you

95
00:03:41,480 --> 00:03:46,400
understand that you alone can't run it a

96
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:49,720
farm is not successful on your energy

97
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:52,040
your Manpower alone you need people you

98
00:03:49,720 --> 00:03:53,680
need a great uh support system you need

99
00:03:52,040 --> 00:03:55,400
to have a great support system and when

100
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,120
I say support system I don't mean people

101
00:03:55,400 --> 00:03:59,280
funding you money all this that's not

102
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:01,040
what I mean here I mean support when it

103
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:02,599
comes to

104
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,120
getting your resources getting your farm

105
00:04:02,599 --> 00:04:06,760
resources laboring on your farm and

106
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:09,959
every other thing for instance now I'm

107
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:11,720
sure you have you have watched uh some

108
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:13,280
of our videos when it comes to feed and

109
00:04:11,720 --> 00:04:15,360
everything one of the ingredient we use

110
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,400
for our feeds on the farm right here is

111
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,840
got from the Breaky it's got from the

112
00:04:17,400 --> 00:04:23,400
Breaky and uh there's a lot of competion

113
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:25,800
for it cuz it's not uh in abundance it's

114
00:04:23,400 --> 00:04:28,280
not like it's so much available or

115
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:29,919
something so how are we able to get from

116
00:04:28,280 --> 00:04:32,400
them

117
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,880
uh to get the waste from there it's

118
00:04:32,400 --> 00:04:36,919
relationship right there in the bakery I

119
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,280
have a great relationship with somebody

120
00:04:36,919 --> 00:04:39,800
right there there's an importance of

121
00:04:38,280 --> 00:04:41,759
relationship in everything you do you

122
00:04:39,800 --> 00:04:43,120
may not understand until you get into it

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:44,960
and if you don't build the right

124
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:46,600
relationship it will literally affect

125
00:04:44,960 --> 00:04:49,240
you it affect your profit you affect

126
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:50,880
your cost because what you would do for

127
00:04:49,240 --> 00:04:53,919
lesser amount you will do it for much

128
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:57,120
more amount and I have a worker right

129
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:59,120
now very faithful and very honest and

130
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:02,199
the relationship I have with him is so

131
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:05,160
in is so much great that I can depend on

132
00:05:02,199 --> 00:05:07,520
him for several activities when it comes

133
00:05:05,160 --> 00:05:08,840
to my farm that's some of the things you

134
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:10,680
want to do you want to have great

135
00:05:08,840 --> 00:05:12,360
relationship with several both the

136
00:05:10,680 --> 00:05:13,639
people that you're getting resources

137
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:15,440
from and people that working for you

138
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:18,120
want to have great relationship with

139
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,319
them you don't want to be uh alone you

140
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,680
can't stand alone when it comes to

141
00:05:19,319 --> 00:05:23,759
farming now that's just one of them some

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:25,759
other things you need is tenacity you

143
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,919
need tenacity you need consistency I

144
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:28,880
want you to know that it's not going to

145
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,759
be Rosy all the time it's never Rosy for

146
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,800
anyone all the time time there's nobody

147
00:05:30,759 --> 00:05:34,919
anybody that deceives you that tells you

148
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:36,840
that he's having it 100% perfect when it

149
00:05:34,919 --> 00:05:38,120
comes to farming is lying to you it's

150
00:05:36,840 --> 00:05:39,600
not always Rosy there are several things

151
00:05:38,120 --> 00:05:41,720
you're going to go through several

152
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,560
experiences that are home for sinen some

153
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:45,520
things you will not even expect that

154
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,520
even The Best of the Best of the Best of

155
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:50,560
the experienced people will still have

156
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,120
issues with it I was I heard a farmer

157
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,800
this farmer I'm sure when it comes to

158
00:05:52,120 --> 00:05:55,520
experience this farmer will DWF me when

159
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:58,039
it comes to experience he has been in

160
00:05:55,520 --> 00:06:00,160
pig farming for quite a very long time

161
00:05:58,039 --> 00:06:02,800
now but right on his farm he had issues

162
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,160
with uh this thing we call the soja hunt

163
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,240
that's the I don't know if it's called

164
00:06:04,160 --> 00:06:09,960
soja HT in every place but the this ants

165
00:06:07,240 --> 00:06:11,599
that are very dangerous they they walk

166
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:14,280
in colonies and they are very they when

167
00:06:11,599 --> 00:06:18,880
they bombard the farm they bombard very

168
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:21,000
in numbers now this U man's Pig gave

169
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:24,319
birth to I think not less than eight

170
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:26,720
eight pigl or so and this so Devo all

171
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:28,599
the animals they finished they literally

172
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,000
finished all the animals they H all the

173
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:32,440
animals this are not these are not

174
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:34,560
challenges that you're going to wake up

175
00:06:32,440 --> 00:06:36,720
and think you're going to face but

176
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,520
obviously he faced it so you that's why

177
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,680
I say you need tenacity and consistency

178
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:42,000
you need that strength within it's not

179
00:06:40,680 --> 00:06:43,400
just all about the videos you watch

180
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,680
online you need to understand that

181
00:06:43,400 --> 00:06:47,080
everything you watch online is a summary

182
00:06:44,680 --> 00:06:49,919
of all that go that people put in when

183
00:06:47,080 --> 00:06:53,000
it comes to farming what you really need

189
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:02,759
going to take you through and that's why

190
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,240
I'm telling you right now when you

00:07:02,759 --> 00:07:07,240

192
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:09,199
getting discour you're facing challenge

193
00:07:07,240 --> 00:07:11,440
or the other all you need to do is to

194
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:13,000
stay Resolute keep on keeping on you

195
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:15,199
don't need to back down you don't need

196
00:07:13,000 --> 00:07:17,560
to back down face your challenges

197
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,240
squarely find solutions to them make the

198
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:20,680
right decisions and you'll come true

199
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:22,520
you'll come true you have to be decisive

200
00:07:20,680 --> 00:07:25,240
that's another thing you need to also

201
00:07:22,520 --> 00:07:26,360
have DEC decisiveness it's very

202
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:28,479
important for you to make the right

203
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,280
decisions and this is why I've

204
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:34,000
emphasized on you amassing knowledge

205
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:36,639
Consulting watching videos watch our

206
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:38,240
videos watch our content you need to

207
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:40,680
because those decisions you're going to

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:43,240
make are going to be from a world of

209
00:07:40,680 --> 00:07:45,080
knowledge before I got into Pig farming

210
00:07:43,240 --> 00:07:47,159
before I even dabbled into Pig farming

211
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:50,520
the knowledge I had in pig farming was

212
00:07:47,159 --> 00:07:52,840
so great I didn't knew so much already

213
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:54,919
so before you even think about dabbing

214
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:56,919
into it why don't you watch lots of

215
00:07:54,919 --> 00:07:58,479
videos read lots of books understand

216
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:00,360
lots of things and don't focus on just

217
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:02,280
the success story focus on the

218
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:03,759
challenges people face try and

219
00:08:02,280 --> 00:08:05,919
understand the things and foresee the

220
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:08,319
things have foresight on the things that

221
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,080
you are going to face also but by the

222
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:11,879
way no matter how much you watch or how

223
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:13,440
much you read you're going to face

224
00:08:11,879 --> 00:08:15,479
things that are going to meet you on aw

225
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:18,039
I want you to know that but at least you

226
00:08:15,479 --> 00:08:20,879
can mitigate the risk that comes with it

227
00:08:18,039 --> 00:08:22,479
by learning ahead so you have to be

228
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:24,199
decisive you have to make the right

229
00:08:22,479 --> 00:08:26,159
decisions those decisions are not going

230
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:27,759
to be made made by other people in your

231
00:08:26,159 --> 00:08:29,000
F you have to be you are the you're the

232
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,800
owner of your farm you have to be the

233
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,320
one to make the the right decisions so

234
00:08:31,800 --> 00:08:34,640
make sure you have the right knowledge

235
00:08:33,320 --> 00:08:37,399
that's what's going to foil the right

236
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:40,200
decisions and consult people you have to

237
00:08:37,399 --> 00:08:42,800
have an alliance of people I mean

238
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:44,200
Farmers that you can easily reach out to

239
00:08:42,800 --> 00:08:46,440
and reach out to what's going on here

240
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:49,000
what's going on here you know you need

241
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:50,200
that resource you need that resource uh

242
00:08:49,000 --> 00:08:51,839
you need to be resourceful that's

243
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:53,920
another thing you need to have you need

244
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,160
to be very resourceful if you're going

245
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,560
to spend money on everything you're

246
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:58,959
going to run at a loss or probably just

247
00:08:57,560 --> 00:09:00,959
break even you're not going to be able

248
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,800
to make massive profit you need to be

249
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:05,279
resourceful you need to be resourceful

250
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:07,800
in things you do if you have the money

251
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:09,079
still be resourceful it it's not the

252
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:11,120
money you don't need to expend your

253
00:09:09,079 --> 00:09:14,160
money all the time be resourceful find a

254
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,160
way to get things done cheaper and in a

255
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:20,680
much more creative

256
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:20,680
way don't spend money all the

257
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:25,160
time and uh last but not the least I'll

258
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:27,240
be mentioning here amongst others there

259
00:09:25,160 --> 00:09:30,560

260
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,079
