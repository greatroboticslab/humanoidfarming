1
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:11,120
there are many hazards associated with

2
00:00:08,880 --> 00:00:12,719
operating combines and additional

3
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:15,679
dangers can be present

4
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,440
under time constraints farmers recognize

5
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:20,000
that the success of their business

6
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,520
depends on harvesting their crops making

7
00:00:20,000 --> 00:00:24,160
it too easy to ignore

8
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,240
safety precautions it is essential to

9
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:28,000
observe safety instructions clearly

10
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,679
outlined in the combine operator's

11
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,160
manual

12
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:34,640
operate combines only when all guards

13
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:37,200
are correctly installed

14
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:39,840
when parking and leaving a combine lower

15
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:43,120
the header unit to the ground

16
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:46,160
remove the keys apply the brakes

17
00:00:43,120 --> 00:00:46,160
and lock the cab

18
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,559
read the safety section of the combine

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:54,879
operator's manual

20
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,199
to become familiar with location and

21
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,600
meaning of all safety decals

22
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:01,520
and to help locate all safety shields

23
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:02,480
and guards on the combine you are

24
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:04,320
operating

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,320
be sure hazard lights are on and

26
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,119
flashing while driving a combine on

27
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:09,439
roads

28
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,240
and use turn signal lights to signal

29
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:12,560
turns

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,960
to avoid motorist confusion do not

31
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,920
operate combine rear discharge lights

32
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:17,920
on public roads

33
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:24,479
the combine operator is essential to

34
00:01:22,479 --> 00:01:26,479
safe combine operation

35
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,640
operators must be thoroughly familiar

36
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:29,759
with the operating controls and safety

37
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,400
features

38
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,759
combines are large machines and if not

39
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:35,840
operated correctly

40
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,400
can easily cause damage to other

41
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:40,560
equipment and injury to people

42
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,000
never operate a combine if you have not

43
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,960
been trained on all

44
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:47,040
aspects of combine operation combine

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:47,280
operators must be comfortable and with

46
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:49,840
an

47
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,040
easy reach of combine controls to drive

48
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:53,520
safely

49
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,960
before operating the combine adjust the

50
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:58,159
seat and steering column

51
00:01:54,960 --> 00:02:00,240
so you can reach all controls easily

52
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:02,560
the wheels that steer self-propelled

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:04,719
combines are rear mounted

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:06,399
steering requires practice since rear

55
00:02:04,719 --> 00:02:08,959
steering causes the rear end of the

56
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,039
combine to swing around rapidly

57
00:02:08,959 --> 00:02:12,239
operators must stay alert to avoid

58
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,200
hitting equipment

59
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,200
and individuals

60
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,760
combines have a large operator cab large

61
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:22,800
enough for a rider in addition to the

62
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:24,879
operator

63
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:26,959
however even though the rider may be

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,040
safe inside the combine cab

65
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,879
the extra person can easily be a

66
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,360
distraction to the operator

67
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,000
the extra seat is intended for use to

68
00:02:33,360 --> 00:02:36,560
instruct

69
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,599
new operators and only for short time

70
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:40,720
periods

71
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:42,000
use the combine horns to signal moving

72
00:02:40,720 --> 00:02:44,560
away

73
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,800
since combines are such large machines

74
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,120
it can be difficult for the operator to

75
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:49,760
see

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,840
people on the ground individuals who are

77
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:52,720
required to work in areas where combines

78
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,120
are moving

79
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:55,840
need to be instructed in combine safety

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,800
practices

81
00:02:55,840 --> 00:02:59,920
as well as the operators avoid making

82
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,840
sharp turns

83
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:05,840
be particularly careful when turning on

84
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:05,840
slopes and uneven ground

85
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:12,080
operating steering and braking of

86
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:13,360
combines can be affected by the heavy

87
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:15,360
weight of headers

88
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,280
it may be necessary to add ballast

89
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:19,360
weights to the rear of combines

90
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:21,200
to compensate for the header weight

91
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,920
always lower the header attachment to

92
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:24,480
the ground

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,159
before performing maintenance on it if

94
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,879
the work requires that the header be

95
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:33,840
lifted

96
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,840
provide secure support under the header

97
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:37,519
shut off the combine engine set the

98
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,599
parking brake

99
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:41,840
and remove the ignition key before

100
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:46,879
performing maintenance or adjustments on

101
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:49,200
any part of the machine

102
00:03:46,879 --> 00:03:50,879
unloading the grain tank on a combine

103
00:03:49,200 --> 00:03:52,080
involves coordination between the

104
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,799
combine operator

105
00:03:52,080 --> 00:03:56,400
and the truck or grain cart operator

106
00:03:54,799 --> 00:03:58,640
never enter the grain tank

107
00:03:56,400 --> 00:04:00,799
while the combine's engine is running

108
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,120
always have another person present when

109
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
doing maintenance on combine grain tanks

110
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:11,040
know the location of fire extinguishers

111
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:12,720
on a combine before operating it

112
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:15,120
be sure the fire extinguishers are

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:17,600
properly serviced and charged

114
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,120
stop harvesting immediately at the first

115
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,600
sign of fire

116
00:04:19,120 --> 00:04:22,400
regularly remove any buildups of straw

117
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,720
or chaff

118
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:27,280
in or near the engine compartment or

119
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
moving parts

120
00:04:27,280 --> 00:04:31,840
following safety precautions does take a

121
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:36,560
little more time

122
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,560
but being safe is your number one

123
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:43,840
commodity

124
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:57,520
you
