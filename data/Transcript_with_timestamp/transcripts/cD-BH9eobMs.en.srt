00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:34,599
implanting asparagus are essential steps

59
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,000
to ensure the plants grow strong and

60
00:02:34,599 --> 00:02:39,239
productive asparagus thrives in well-

61
00:02:37,000 --> 00:02:43,000
draining loose soil rich in nutrients

62
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:45,360
with a pH of 6.5 to 7.5 preferring a

63
00:02:43,000 --> 00:02:47,680
slightly alkaline environment before

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,959
planting Farmers should till the soil to

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:53,560
a depth of 30 40 C DS and add decomposed

66
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,959
organic matter to improve fertility

67
00:02:53,560 --> 00:02:59,560
creating raised beds is also crucial

68
00:02:55,959 --> 00:03:02,640
these beds should be 20 30 cm high and 1

69
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,599

accumulation there are two common ways

75
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:19,799
to plant asparagus using roots and using

soil moist

81
00:03:30,760 --> 00:03:35,360
currently many farms have adopted

82
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:37,439
machinery for planting asparagus by root

83
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:40,439
