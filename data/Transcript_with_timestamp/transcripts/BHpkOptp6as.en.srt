1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:05,120
as organic farmers we're like the

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,160
Lifeboat of the planet I mean it's kind

3
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:08,719
of a big deal and I it's I'm really

4
00:00:07,160 --> 00:00:10,320
passionate about that because we're

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:12,120
doing this really hard work Matthew was

6
00:00:10,320 --> 00:00:14,240
explaining like we're literally hand

7
00:00:12,120 --> 00:00:16,720
shoveling compost like so many noil

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,400
farmers are wheelbarrowing their compost

9
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:20,880
onto their land and like literally

10
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:22,760
shoveling we're like the Earth core and

11
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,160
Engineers we're laying all this organic

12
00:00:22,760 --> 00:00:27,080
matter down and the huge benefits are

13
00:00:25,160 --> 00:00:28,439
being brought to the planet as far as

14
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:30,800
climate change you know as far as

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:33,559
habitat for beneficials we learned that

16
00:00:30,800 --> 00:00:35,680
you know you add fertility to the soil

17
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,520
and you take care of the soil Health you

18
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:40,640
grow bigger plants and that means that

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:41,800
the plants are taking up more carbon out

20
00:00:40,640 --> 00:00:44,559
of the

21
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:48,079
atmosphere and fixing it into their

22
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:50,239
bodies which is exactly what all the

23
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:52,199
green energy folks are telling us is

24
00:00:50,239 --> 00:00:55,600
what we need to do right is to to to

25
00:00:52,199 --> 00:00:55,600
sequester more carbon
