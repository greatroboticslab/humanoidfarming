00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,480
today i'm going to demonstrate a simple

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:06,560
way to patch a lay flat head apart

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:08,800
when a leak occurs the first thing you

4
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:11,599
should do is identify exactly where the

5
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:14,000
leak is in the late flat header pipe

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,920
if you identify a hole in the lay flat

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,119
you will make a cut directly over that

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,279
leak point

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,080
you will cut it completely in half so

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:24,800
you are working with even edges

11
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:27,199
we are going to use a coupling or bob

12
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:28,640
splice fitting to join the two parts

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,199
back together

14
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:34,079
take two clamps and insert them on both

15
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:35,920
sides of pipe they can go on either way

16
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:38,559
but we are putting them on so that we

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:40,800
can easily reach to tighten the clamps

18
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:43,280
insert the bar splice fitting into one

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,600
side and then the other

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,440
push both sides of the leg flat together

21
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,920
over the fitting

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,760
a little vaseline or

23
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,719
vegetable oil will help the lay flat

24
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:54,719
slide on the feeding

25
00:00:55,360 --> 00:01:01,920
move the pipe clamps just past the barbs

26
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:01,920
and tighten them with the screwdriver

27
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,840
now the leak is fixed

28
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:13,280
turn the water on and make sure it

29
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,360
worked

30
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,520
we hope this video was very useful
