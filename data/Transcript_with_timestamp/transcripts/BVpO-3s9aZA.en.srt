1
00:00:03,860 --> 00:00:08,400
greenhouses and high tunnels are

2
00:00:06,540 --> 00:00:11,280
attractive because they allow us to grow

3
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:13,440
plants that may struggle if we tried to

4
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:15,780
grow them outdoors and it can extend the

5
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,340
growing season about a month on each end

6
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:22,619
some of the considerations to make when

7
00:00:19,340 --> 00:00:26,039
choosing the high tunnel or Greenhouse

8
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:28,680
structure for your backyard would be the

9
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:30,539
plants that you want to grow and the

10
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,360
material that you want to build your

11
00:00:30,539 --> 00:00:36,300
structure with in this case we have a

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:38,700
poly film cover over the top of this

13
00:00:36,300 --> 00:00:41,940
High tunnel and we have polycarbonate

14
00:00:38,700 --> 00:00:44,780
sides or ends to the high tunnel and of

15
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:48,059
course glass is another option

16
00:00:44,780 --> 00:00:50,700
polycarbonate and film materials might

17
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:53,100
be less expensive but they have a

18
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:56,280
limited lifespan of maybe five to seven

19
00:00:53,100 --> 00:00:59,399
years another consideration would be

20
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,620
venting and Cooling in the summer when

21
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:05,040
it's really warm outside it's extremely

22
00:01:01,620 --> 00:01:07,560
hot on the inside of the structure which

23
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:11,100
can stress the plants so

24
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:13,860
a door sides that roll up or even a vent

25
00:01:11,100 --> 00:01:16,799
installed in the top of the structure

26
00:01:13,860 --> 00:01:18,840
will help let that hot air escape the

27
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,439
University of Wyoming has Publications

28
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,960
on high tunnel and Greenhouse structures

29
00:01:22,439 --> 00:01:26,759
from the University of Wyoming extension

00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:30,200
this is Chris hilgert and you're

31
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,200
watching from the ground up
