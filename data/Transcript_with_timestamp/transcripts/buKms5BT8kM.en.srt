first off i know that getting started

20
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,040
with a new form of composting can be

21
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,960
kind of intimidating which is

22
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,559
why after years of doing it myself i

23
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,559
finally wrote these two books

24
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760

quick and easy and this is my other worm

29
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:50,559
farm ebook which is available in our

very valuable to you

40
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,520
another thing we should talk about very

41
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:08,880
briefly is i was checking my analytics

42
00:01:07,520 --> 00:01:10,640

a lot of you are here to see how i built

54
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,240
this

55
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:29,920
and hopefully editing natalie has

56
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:31,200

if you want to skip to certain parts of

60
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:39,119
this video i'll also leave

61
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:39,119
timestamps in the show notes down below

62
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:42,399
if you're here watching this video you

63
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,560
probably already know this but let's

64
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,880
talk about what is a worm farm

65
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:49,200
a worm farm is another way of saying a

66
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:49,759
vermicompost setup it's a way to use

67
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,960
worms

68
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:54,960
to make compost free fertilizer at home

69
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,119
into sustainability a worm farm is

70
00:01:54,960 --> 00:01:58,399
another great way to reduce your waste

71
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,560
and carbon footprint

72
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:02,240
but for me as a gardener and somebody

73
00:02:00,560 --> 00:02:05,840
who's interested in homesteading and

74
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:08,080
regenerative agriculture a worm farm is

75
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:10,080
so much more than that for me a worm

76
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:11,920
farm is a way that we steward our dream

77
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:13,840
of having livestock one day

78
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:15,599
as we learn to take care of this very

79
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:16,319
low maintenance livestock if you want to

80
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,840
call it that

81
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,599
worm farm is a way that we reduce our

82
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:21,280
carbon footprint and we

83
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:24,000
do a lot of composting out here with our

84
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
food scraps contrary to popular belief

85
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:27,360
though worm farms

86
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:28,879
don't need as much food scraps as you

87
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:31,280
think they do

88
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:32,319
so it's not the only way that we compost

89
00:02:31,280 --> 00:02:34,239
our food here but it is

90
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,080
a way that we can compost leftover food

91
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:38,319
scraps like apple cores

92
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,800
or cucumber skins or whatever it may be

93
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:43,040
and as a gardener and a backyard farmer

94
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:44,239
a worm farm is a way that i make compost

95
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,080
for free at home

96
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,440
and it's so much better than anything

97
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
that you can buy in store which we'll

98
00:02:47,440 --> 00:02:50,000
talk about at the end of this video so

99
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:51,680
if you're interested in learning

100
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,360
more about the benefits of a worm farm

101
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:54,640
for your farm or garden stay tuned

102
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:55,040
because we'll talk about that at the end

103
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:56,720
because

104
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,400
i don't want to bore you guys i know why

105
00:02:56,720 --> 00:02:59,840
you're here you're here to see how to

106
00:02:58,400 --> 00:03:01,599
build this so you can compost in your

107
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:03,040
apartment or you can compost in the city

108
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,000
but i just wanted to cover like what is

109
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:05,760
a worm farm and why

110
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,599
might it be beneficial to you there are

111
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,159
so many reasons but for us it gets down

112
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,319
to

113
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:12,000
being more sustainable stewarding our

114
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:14,720
dreams and having a way

115
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:18,640
to have wonderful bioavailable nutrients

116
00:03:14,720 --> 00:03:20,400
ready to go for our garden

117
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,680
and now i can introduce you to our worm

118
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:24,400
farm worm farm

119
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,400
internet internet worm farm this is our

120
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:28,319
worm farm and it's very simple

121
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,680
i inherited this system off of steven of

122
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:31,760
nature's always right so if you want to

123
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:33,280
see like the entire original video of

124
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:35,519
this worm farm setup you can

125
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,200
check that out in the links up above and

126
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:39,519
down below

127
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:40,720
no matter what type of worm farm you go

128
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
with you want to make sure that you've

129
00:03:40,720 --> 00:03:44,720
got proper

130
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:46,000
air flow and drainage because too dry or

131
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:47,599
too wet is not

132
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,920
a good environment for worms want their

133
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:53,439
environment to be something like that of

134
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:55,120
a damp sponge not too cold not too dry

135
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:56,720
somewhere right in between and this has

136
00:03:55,120 --> 00:03:58,319
been a great setup to achieve that so

137
00:03:56,720 --> 00:03:59,439
steven did a really good job setting up

138
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:01,200
these bins

139
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,560
and i can just kind of give you a brief

140
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,159
overview here is that

141
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,480
these bins essentially have a lot of

142
00:04:04,159 --> 00:04:08,080
holes around the top not near the bottom

143
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,920
so the worms don't escape

144
00:04:08,080 --> 00:04:12,000
but near the top are spaced anywhere

145
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:13,920
between one to two inches apart

146
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:16,560
and he's drilled on the top of these

147
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:19,440
lids around the top of these bins

148
00:04:16,560 --> 00:04:21,040
and as well as on the bottom so like i

149
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:23,120
mentioned this system was

150
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:24,400
given to me by steven of nature's always

151
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:25,440
right he's got a great channel if you

152
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,560
guys don't know that channel you should

153
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,320
definitely go check it out

154
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:30,479
i redesigned it to work better for our

155
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:31,600
space because his original design was

156
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:33,280
much longer

157
00:04:31,600 --> 00:04:35,040
and it was just harder to accommodate in

158
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,120
our semi-urban

159
00:04:35,040 --> 00:04:38,400
setting whereas for him it worked fine

160
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,160
on his farm

161
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,080
but for us i just needed something a

162
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:43,600
little bit more compact and i wanted

163
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,320
something that would also give me the

164
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:49,360
ability to regenerate soil below

165
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,919
this worm bin so as you can see there is

166
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,120
room below these worm bins to place this

167
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:55,759
entire setup over

168
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,440
soil and as i water these worm bins and

169
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,840
as leachate drains through

170
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:00,479
we'll be able to make our own very

171
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:03,039
healthy

172
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,479
soil biome below this setup and that was

173
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:06,639
something that was important to me

174
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,160
so that's why this setup is designed

175
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,919
like that it's a little bit more space

176
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:13,039
efficient and it will help us regenerate

177
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,039
soil below the bins

178
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:17,680
all right let's talk worm farm supplies

00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:19,919

00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:37,600
for the structure of this project i used

190
00:05:35,440 --> 00:05:39,440
wood that i found in the back of lowe's

191
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:40,960
and not like behind the building like in

192
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:42,240
the building they had disassembled some

193
00:05:40,960 --> 00:05:44,240
pallets or something

194
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:45,440
and i was able to find wood that was

195
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:46,720
only heat treated

196
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,199
if you're going to use pallet wood make

197
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:51,680
sure you're only using heat treated wood

198
00:05:49,199 --> 00:05:54,080
the stamp says ht on there i believe and

199
00:05:51,680 --> 00:05:56,000
you can look up the different stamps

200
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:57,199
but anyway so i found some so i found

201
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:58,800
some heat treated wood

202
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:00,160
that was once used i believe in some

203
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,600
kind of a pallet and they had

204
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:03,120
disassembled it and just left it in the

205
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:03,680
back of the lumber section i said can i

206
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,600
take this

207
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,440
and they said yes so i got my wood for

208
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:08,880
free something to consider

209
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:10,639
sometimes you can find stuff in the back

210
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,080
of like home depot or lowe's or your

211
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:12,960
local hardware center that they don't

212
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,400
want

213
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,080
they don't need they need to get rid of

214
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,080
it that's what i did and

215
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:20,000
i got a lot of my materials for free i

216
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:21,280
also used deck screws which i happen to

217
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
have on hand from the

218
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:25,120
thousands of other projects that i've

219
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,759
done around here i personally do like to

220
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:27,680
pre-drill

221
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,800
even though supposedly with deck screws

222
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,520
you don't have to pre-drill

223
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,720
i generally always pre-drill my projects

224
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:34,319
just to ensure that i'm not going to

225
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:35,039
crack the wood which brings me to the

226
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:37,919
next point

227
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:39,680
i also used drill bits and an electric

228
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:42,639
drill for this project

229
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,520
and i also used a staple gun quarter

230
00:06:42,639 --> 00:06:47,520
inch staples

231
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,039
and quarter inch mesh and a note

232
00:06:47,520 --> 00:06:51,120
i would have loved to have used corner

233
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:52,720
clamps on this project but i have since

234
00:06:51,120 --> 00:06:54,720
returned the corner clamps to our

235
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:56,639
neighbors and i don't have any corner

236
00:06:54,720 --> 00:06:57,599
clamps until santa comes or until i make

237
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:59,360
it big on youtube

238
00:06:57,599 --> 00:07:01,120
there you go no corner clamps for me

239
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:02,560
right now but i highly recommend them

240
00:07:01,120 --> 00:07:03,599
they're a great tool to have on hand if

241
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:05,120
you're going to build anything that you

242
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:07,599
want to be super square

243
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,280
i've used them in the past i miss them

244
00:07:07,599 --> 00:07:10,479
one day i'll have my own and it will be

245
00:07:09,280 --> 00:07:12,240
wonderful

246
00:07:10,479 --> 00:07:13,280
but for now i don't have corner clamps

247
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,120
but if you're wanting to make this

248
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,639
project i highly recommend you get some

249
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,720
corner clamps the lighting's getting a

250
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:19,280
little funky on me out here but onward

251
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:21,919
we press

252
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,520
one day very soon we'll have our farm

253
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,520
and lush green pasture

254
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:27,039
and lots of different lighting and angle

255
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:28,880
setups but for now we're gonna throw

256
00:07:27,039 --> 00:07:30,880
some hands of good life on this

257
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:33,680
shift a little bit and continue talking

258
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,680
about worm farms

259
00:07:33,710 --> 00:07:37,360
[Music]

260
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,280
so step number one to making this worm

261
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:41,520
farm i made the frames

262
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,560
to make the frames i just made sure that

263
00:07:41,520 --> 00:07:44,479
everything was level

264
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,919
and screwed four pieces of wood together

265
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:49,120
measuring about 22

266
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,080
by 36 inches then i stapled on some

267
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:51,440
quarter inch mesh

268
00:07:50,080 --> 00:07:52,879
i overlapped the mesh to create

269
00:07:51,440 --> 00:07:55,199
additional support in the center of the

270
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:57,440
frame and i stapled those sheets

271
00:07:55,199 --> 00:08:00,400
in place with one staple about one to

272
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,400
two inches apart

273
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:08,479
[Music]

274
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:10,319
it was time to add the legs of this worm

275
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:12,319
farm this is where things got a little

276
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:13,550
tricky without corner clamps but i found

277
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:21,680
a way

278
00:08:13,550 --> 00:08:27,840
[Music]

279
00:08:21,680 --> 00:08:27,840
i made initial drill points

280
00:08:28,410 --> 00:09:11,169
[Music]

281
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:16,000
and once i was happy with the stability

282
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,000
and the levelness of the project

283
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:23,839
i made the second drill points which

284
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:23,839
solidified the whole thing

285
00:09:24,650 --> 00:09:35,920
[Music]

286
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,920
now at this point you could add a little

287
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,519
bit of wood glue which i did but i

288
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:41,200
didn't get it on film

289
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:50,450
that just makes everything a little bit

290
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:56,090
more stable

291
00:09:50,450 --> 00:09:56,090
[Music]

292
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:59,760
to create the totes just use a quarter

293
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:00,160
inch drill bit and drill all the way

294
00:09:59,760 --> 00:10:01,920
around

295
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:03,440
every two inches or so you can see how

296
00:10:01,920 --> 00:10:05,120
these were originally built

297
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:07,200
over on steven's channel nature's always

298
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,399
right as these were once his bins but

299
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,640
the idea is simple

300
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:12,560
airflow drainage holes and you're good

301
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,240
to go then you can remove the lid of one

302
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:19,839
container and combine the totes and

303
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:19,839
voila you have a worm farm

304
00:10:20,070 --> 00:10:27,279
[Music]

305
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:29,040
let's talk about what's actually going

306
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,200
to go in the bins

307
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
you can follow this guide it's pretty

308
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:33,920
simple it breaks it all down for you

309
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,360
it's like a nice little map

310
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,120
the first thing that you want to do is

311
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,720
you want to lay down some kind of piece

312
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,720
of cardboard or several pieces of

313
00:10:38,720 --> 00:10:41,519
newspaper just along the drainage holes

314
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:43,680
on the bottom

315
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:45,600
then you're going to add your browns

316
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:46,000
water those down with some chlorine-free

317
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,040
water

318
00:10:46,000 --> 00:10:49,519
then you're going to add your food

319
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,480
scraps and your grit water that down a

320
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,360
little bit you're going to add your

321
00:10:50,480 --> 00:10:53,360
compost

322
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:55,040
soil bedding peat moss whatever you're

323
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,760
using for the worms to kind of start

324
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:58,240
their life in

325
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,959
add another layer of browns on top of

326
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,440
that that's

327
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:03,200
basically it you can repeat that process

328
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:05,279
several times in my quick start guide i

329
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,680
show you how to repeat it three times

330
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:08,800
more than that is probably excessive so

331
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:10,480
i would recommend

332
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:12,240
just start with you know your three

333
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:13,440
basic layers but if you're feeling like

334
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:14,800
you're really wanting to get into this

335
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:16,800
and you want a lot of castings quick

336
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:18,240
like feel free to add multiple layers

337
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:18,959
it's really up to you there's a lot of

338
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:20,720
freedom in this

339
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:21,540
don't worry your worms will figure it

340
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:23,760
out

341
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:25,600
[Music]

342
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:27,120
so we've covered all the basics of like

343
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:28,079
how to build a worm farm but what is the

344
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:30,160
process

345
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,079
of being a worm farmer actually look

346
00:11:30,160 --> 00:11:35,040
like i'm gonna break this down for you

347
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:36,160
very simply very quickly okay this is my

348
00:11:35,040 --> 00:11:38,160
worm farming process

349
00:11:36,160 --> 00:11:39,920
zelda worm farm set up worm farm wait

350
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,480
two to three months harvest castings

351
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:42,959
brew tea apply to the leaves drench the

352
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:45,440
roots

353
00:11:42,959 --> 00:11:46,560
add remaining castings and worms to soil

354
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,360
if desired

355
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:51,360
yield abundance like so simple

356
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,600
i promised you guys we would talk a

357
00:11:53,600 --> 00:11:57,040
little bit about worm farm benefits now

358
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:58,560
if you're here you likely already know

359
00:11:57,040 --> 00:11:59,920
all of this but in case you don't i

360
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,200
figured it's worth mentioning and

361
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,120
talking a little bit about

362
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,240
starting a worm farm allows you to make

363
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:06,959
fertilizer

364
00:12:04,240 --> 00:12:08,959
at home essentially for free which is

365
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:11,360
pretty amazing if you ask me

366
00:12:08,959 --> 00:12:12,160
a worm farm is a great solution for

367
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:14,000
composting

368
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:15,519
in an apartment or composting in the

369
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:18,320
city it offers

370
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:19,040
so many ways to compost and it doesn't

371
00:12:18,320 --> 00:12:21,839
smell

372
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,440
it's great no smell when your worm farm

373
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:24,720
is healthy there is no smell so you

374
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,760
don't have to worry about stinking up

375
00:12:24,720 --> 00:12:27,519
your apartment

376
00:12:25,760 --> 00:12:29,120
or your townhouse or anything like that

377
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:31,279
like worm farms

378
00:12:29,120 --> 00:12:32,320
are great for so many reasons composting

379
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,600
without smell

380
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:37,600
i love it worm castings are super

381
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:38,959
balanced fertilizers so if you know

382
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:40,240
anything about npk

383
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:41,760
like you want to make sure that you're

384
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:43,440
adding the right nutrients at the right

385
00:12:41,760 --> 00:12:45,200
times for your plants

386
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:46,959
you don't have to worry about burning

387
00:12:45,200 --> 00:12:47,360
your plants with worm castings because

388
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:49,279
they're

389
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,279
super bioavailable and they're actually

390
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:52,160
protected in this little mucous membrane

391
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:54,720
that makes them

392
00:12:52,160 --> 00:12:56,079
slightly a little bit like a slow

393
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,519
release fertilizer

394
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,360
it's not something that's going to be

395
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,040
released into the environment all at

396
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:03,200
once it's something that will

397
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,959
eventually leech out its nutrients over

398
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,440
time you will notice the benefits right

399
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:09,360
away but again i've never experienced

400
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:11,040
burning my plants with worm castings and

401
00:13:09,360 --> 00:13:12,240
i attribute that to the fact that they

402
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:14,720
are very balanced

403
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:16,560
their nature is like slow release

404
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:18,880
fertilizer which is pretty cool

405
00:13:16,560 --> 00:13:20,000
worm castings and worm tea help prevent

406
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,079
disease i cannot

407
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:24,480
tell you the difference that i saw in my

408
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:27,200
garden this year using foliar feeding

409
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:28,320
worm tea techniques in the garden like

410
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,680
seriously

411
00:13:28,320 --> 00:13:33,839
my garden exploded we had so many less

412
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:35,360
pests and disease so i saw a huge

413
00:13:33,839 --> 00:13:37,680
difference in that alone

414
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:38,800
and i cannot recommend it enough again

415
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:39,360
check out the video if you want to know

416
00:13:38,800 --> 00:13:42,079
more

417
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:43,920
worm farming is so fun for everybody of

418
00:13:42,079 --> 00:13:45,360
all ages but especially kids if you have

419
00:13:43,920 --> 00:13:46,560
kids and you want to teach them about

420
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,680
sustainability

421
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:52,959
about composting worm farming is a great

422
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:54,480
way to get them into learning how to be

423
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:56,240
a better steward of their environment

424
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,160
learning how to be more sustainable

425
00:13:56,240 --> 00:13:59,519
just learning about worms in general is

426
00:13:58,160 --> 00:14:01,199
pretty cool if you ask me

427
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:02,720
i'm kind of a worm nerd though so maybe

428
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:04,000
i'm biased but again it's a great

429
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:06,000
project for kids

430
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,519
and it's something that's like safe and

431
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,480
fun for the whole family so if you're

432
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:09,920
into that

433
00:14:08,480 --> 00:14:11,360
another thing to consider is that your

434
00:14:09,920 --> 00:14:12,730
kids might really enjoy having a warm

435
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:14,240
farm as well

436
00:14:12,730 --> 00:14:16,480

absolutely there for a reason

448
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,040
