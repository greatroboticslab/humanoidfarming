1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,520
for small scale Farmers I know you've

2
00:00:01,880 --> 00:00:05,359
been wondering what are the most

3
00:00:03,520 --> 00:00:07,399
profitable cops that you can manage to

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:10,000
do and earn some decent these are

5
00:00:07,399 --> 00:00:12,920
farmers who have less than an acre of

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:15,639
land and most of them own one age of or

7
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,359
what is commonly known as 50 by 100 land

8
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,160
is becoming Scar and we are increasing

9
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:20,960
in population but at the end of the day

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:22,519
you can still make some decent profit

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,279
and especially the youth who are

12
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:26,480
graduating and you have small pce of

13
00:00:24,279 --> 00:00:28,519
this is a good way to employ yourself

14
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,560
these are five most profitable crops

15
00:00:28,519 --> 00:00:32,320
that you can grow they don't require cap

16
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,719
they don't require much knowledge they

17
00:00:32,320 --> 00:00:36,840
fast maturing and also they have a wet

18
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,920
by W Market I mean you can sell them

19
00:00:36,840 --> 00:00:41,079
even through your immediate neighbor and

20
00:00:38,920 --> 00:00:43,280
regardless of the marketly imagine you

21
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:45,520
still get people who buy as long as you

22
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,480
maintain the C as minimum as possible

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:50,160
but first let understand what is profit

24
00:00:47,480 --> 00:00:52,760
profit is the amount that you get after

25
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:55,359
deducting your cost from the revenue you

26
00:00:52,760 --> 00:00:57,879
earn what do I mean I mean if you have

27
00:00:55,359 --> 00:01:01,480
10,000 heads of cabbage and you sell

28
00:00:57,879 --> 00:01:04,960
each at 15 shs you manag to get

29
00:01:01,480 --> 00:01:08,000
150,000 sh that is Le that is not profit

30
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:09,920
if you had 10 produce each cabbage it

31
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:13,040
means your total cost of producing the

32
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:15,680
10,000 heads of cabbage was 100,000 shs

33
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:19,560
now to get your profit you take the

34
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:22,680
150,000 sh you L their 100,000 sh you

35
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:25,040
get your profit as 50,000 sh that is the

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,880
profit most Farmers don't know how toate

37
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:29,479
this they assume once you've sold your

38
00:01:26,880 --> 00:01:31,119
produ that is no that is usually not the

39
00:01:29,479 --> 00:01:33,079
profit that iseven and when you are

40
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,240
factoring the remember also to pay

41
00:01:33,079 --> 00:01:36,920
yourself assume that what you put there

42
00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:38,560
the energy the time and all the

43
00:01:36,920 --> 00:01:40,680
resources that you put there when you

44
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:42,880
cultivating this crops assuming that you

45
00:01:40,680 --> 00:01:44,840
employed someone else who similar work

46
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:47,320
how much would he have charged you if

47
00:01:44,840 --> 00:01:49,479
you would have charged 300 or 500 Shing

48
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:52,600
that is your cost of Labor and you have

49
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:55,960
to factor in to get a true value of your

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:58,000
profit in 2025 these five crops can give

51
00:01:55,960 --> 00:02:00,640
you some good cash but let us be

52
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:03,039
realistic by this I mean you cannot

53
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:05,000
expect super abnormal profits in family

54
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,479
there's nothing like making tens of

55
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:10,319
millions in one day now profitability in

56
00:02:07,479 --> 00:02:11,840
agricult is you make 10% profit 20%

57
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:14,319
profit the problem with most of us we

58
00:02:11,840 --> 00:02:16,599
are greedy and we want to have AB normal

59
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:18,720
profit we want to make 100,000 from

60
00:02:16,599 --> 00:02:21,920
investing 1,000 that one doesn't happen

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:24,319
so if you invest 100 and you get 200 as

62
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:26,680
profit that's okay these are the five

63
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,879
props that you can manage to do and get

64
00:02:26,680 --> 00:02:30,440
some good profits and number one is

65
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,640
thiss in short

66
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,959
this can be

67
00:02:31,640 --> 00:02:38,040
either P or all those types of PS and

68
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:40,080
good thing with p is that they are fast

69
00:02:38,040 --> 00:02:42,280
maturing and then also number two they

70
00:02:40,080 --> 00:02:44,200
are not perishable number three you can

71
00:02:42,280 --> 00:02:45,879
sell to anyone after they are dry and

72
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:48,200
you harvested them you can take to the

73
00:02:45,879 --> 00:02:50,319
local market or to the seral stores so

74
00:02:48,200 --> 00:02:52,480
they will still buy this makes it a good

75
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:55,120
CR to do the other thing that makes it a

76
00:02:52,480 --> 00:02:57,840
good CR to do is the cost of producing

77
00:02:55,120 --> 00:03:00,879
it imagine in an a of an you only need

78
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:04,080
2.5 kgs so this will cost you roughly

79
00:03:00,879 --> 00:03:07,000
around 250 Shing if you put now all the

80
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:09,640
other cost of producing them around 500

81
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,120
Shing for chemicals and maybe an extra

82
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:14,239
additional cost of 1,000 you'll get a

83
00:03:12,120 --> 00:03:18,000
total production cost of around

84
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:19,599
2,700 and 50 if you are good at it and

85
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:23,159
the season is okay and you manage to

86
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:25,920
harvest around 1.5 B each weigh 90 kgs

87
00:03:23,159 --> 00:03:28,360
and you are also lucky to sell at 80

88
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,159
Shillings per kilo then you will earn

89
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:32,959
10,800

90
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:35,280
from your 1.5 back the second most

91
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:38,360
profitable crop for small scale Farmers

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:42,200
is a garden pie or what is often known

93
00:03:38,360 --> 00:03:44,680
as Mii Mii tend to Bel by many though

94
00:03:42,200 --> 00:03:46,640
they are also quite expensive the funny

95
00:03:44,680 --> 00:03:49,480
thing with Mii it tends to come from

96
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:51,599
only one region around Yanda County but

97
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:54,040
if the farmers can manage to tap into

98
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:55,760
this Market there is high demand the

99
00:03:54,040 --> 00:03:58,000
other Supply that may be experienced

100
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,519
around the year is also short live

101
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:03,280
meaning that prices are often High above

102
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:06,840
70 shs if you are a small scale farmer

103
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:10,120
with a name of anre you only need 2 kgs

104
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:13,439
this one will cost you 1,800 if you add

105
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:16,680
other cost of 1,500 units it means that

106
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:20,639
your total cost of of production will be

107
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:25,479
around 3,300 sh if you manage it well

108
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:28,639
thisa can manage to give you 200 KES of

109
00:04:25,479 --> 00:04:31,720
Green Piece all n selling it on a market

110
00:04:28,639 --> 00:04:35,240
price of 4 Shing per kilo you manage to

111
00:04:31,720 --> 00:04:38,840
get a roughly revenue of 8,000 Shing if

112
00:04:35,240 --> 00:04:42,240
you L your 3,300 the cost of production

113
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:45,880
you are left with a profit of around

114
00:04:42,240 --> 00:04:47,800
4,700 shs and remember this is the

115
00:04:45,880 --> 00:04:50,199
lowest price of 40 Shing per kilo

116
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,560
sometimes it goes to over 70 Shillings

117
00:04:50,199 --> 00:04:55,440
per kilo the third most profitable crop

118
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:57,880
for small scale Farmers is D or what is

119
00:04:55,440 --> 00:05:01,440
often known as a coriander the good

120
00:04:57,880 --> 00:05:03,960
thing with coriander is it's fast within

121
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:07,000
30 to 35 days it's ready for harvesting

122
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,199
and my doesn't need those expensive

123
00:05:07,000 --> 00:05:11,160
chemicals or even fertilizer you just

124
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,720
plant it and manage it and that's all

125
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:16,039
you have good to go and within those at

126
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:19,960
least let's say 40 days you will manage

127
00:05:16,039 --> 00:05:22,960
to have harvested around 200 kilos from

128
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:25,360
the farm if you sell each kg for 40

129
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:28,080
Shillings then it gives you a Le of

130
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,600
8,000 Shillings if you L your cost of

131
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:32,240
2,300 Shillings you are left with a

132
00:05:30,600 --> 00:05:35,080
profit of

133
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:37,960
5,700 this is a good profit for small

you around 500 shs if you add your cost

159
00:06:33,400 --> 00:06:37,479
of production that is maybe wiing also

manage to produce around 2,000 pieces of

163
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,039
maze or lot is often called as if he

164
00:06:46,160 --> 00:06:51,720
sells it at 5 Shillings each at lowest

165
00:06:49,039 --> 00:06:54,840
then he makes up a levenue of 10,000

166
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:57,520
Shillings if you L now the cost of 2,500

167
00:06:54,840 --> 00:07:00,479
sh he makes a profit of

168
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:02,879
7,500 sh the good thing with green maze

169
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:04,599
is one but you don't have to sell it

170
00:07:02,879 --> 00:07:07,080
green if you don't get to the market you

171
00:07:04,599 --> 00:07:09,520
can manage to let it dry and by letting

172
00:07:07,080 --> 00:07:12,360
this dry you will harvest around five

173
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,160
bags each weigh 90 kg so if you sell

174
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:18,000
each bag at around 2,000 Shillings you

175
00:07:15,160 --> 00:07:20,120
earn a levenue of 10,000 sharings

176
00:07:18,000 --> 00:07:22,400
however by letting it dry it may add an

177
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:25,560
extra cost of 2,000 sharings making a

178
00:07:22,400 --> 00:07:29,160
total cost of production to 4,500 sh if

179
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:31,560
you L 4,500 from the 10,000 Rue you are

180
00:07:29,160 --> 00:07:35,199
l to the profit of

181
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:37,599
5,500 sh my last most profitable crop

182
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:41,440
for small scale Farmers is indigenous

183
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:44,120
vegetables and by vegetables I mean man

184
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:47,360
amandas we mean

185
00:07:44,120 --> 00:07:50,000
plant all those indigenous vegetables

186
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:52,440
why they most profitable is one they are

187
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:55,159
cheap to produce Imagine by less than 50

188
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:58,080
sh you have a packet of seeds that you

189
00:07:55,159 --> 00:07:59,720
can plant and give you a 1,000 sh then

190
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:01,759
the good thing with them is that but

191
00:07:59,720 --> 00:08:03,599
they are not that much highly per then

192
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:06,120
the other thing you can Harvest for

193
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:08,000
quite some time and also you have a

194
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:10,360
wider Market including the neighbors you

195
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:11,840
can send to the neighbor okay so these

196
00:08:10,360 --> 00:08:13,520
indigenous vegetables they are good

197
00:08:11,840 --> 00:08:16,199
source of income they are also quite

198
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,319
profitable if done well and by

199
00:08:16,199 --> 00:08:20,840
consistency you can be selling to the

200
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,720
local grocery stores oh mama once they
