00:00:03,280 --> 00:00:07,440
pond preparation brief intro

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,200
various steps for preparing pond are

3
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,120
described below

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:12,480
controlling harmful aquatic plants and

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,320
animals

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:16,080
aquatic weeds consumes almost all the

7
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,240
nutrition from water

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,359
eradicating cannibalistic and unwanted

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:24,160
fish

10
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:24,160
applying lawn applying fertilizer

11
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:28,400
before a pond can be restocked for a new

12
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,080
crop the excessive wastes

13
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:32,079
which accumulate in the pond during the

14
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:34,160
previous crop must be removed in the

15
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:35,920
soil and water conditioned

16
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,840
growing of coefficient an improperly

17
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:39,440
prepared pond may lead to difficulty in

18
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:40,079
pond management during the culture

19
00:00:39,440 --> 00:00:41,520
period

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,840
which could result in a decrease in

21
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
production capacity of the pond

22
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,399
the cleaning of a pond or removal of the

23
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,239
wastes especially the organic and

24
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,680
phosphatic wastes that have accumulated

25
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:55,520
in the pond bottom could be

26
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:56,800
accomplished by drying lambing and

27
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:58,800
plowing

28
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,559
however these methods could still leave

29
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,760
an adverse effect on the water and soil

30
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,280
quality in the pond

31
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:05,680
which could result in a decrease in the

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,200
production capacity of the pond

33
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,040
there are two methods for cleaning a

34
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,240
pond according to the possibility of the

35
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,760
pond

36
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:16,479
to be dried

37
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:19,119
dry method this method is used when the

38
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,880
pond bottom can be dried completely

39
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:23,840
the pond is drained and left to dry in

40
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:25,200
the sun for a period of 10 to 30 days

41
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,520
then the waste is removed either

42
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:29,600
manually or mechanically and transported

43
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:31,280
to the waste dumping area

44
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:33,119
removal of waste by machines has an

45
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,320
advantage that it can compact the bottom

46
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,079
soil

47
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,920
however this cleaning method by drying

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:39,520
may lead to development of acidity

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,799
lowering the level of the pond bottom

50
00:01:39,520 --> 00:01:44,240
and the diffusion of waste if the

51
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
workers are inexperienced

52
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:52,399
one method in areas where the pond

53
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,079
cannot be dried completely

54
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:55,759
pressure washing can be used to flush

55
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:57,520
out the wastes

56
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,840
this method takes a shorter time and is

57
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:01,439
more efficient than the dry method

58
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,119
flushing should be continued until the

59
00:02:01,439 --> 00:02:04,880
acid and dark anaerobic layer in the

60
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:06,560
soil are removed

61
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,479
this method is suitable in the acid

62
00:02:06,560 --> 00:02:10,479
sulfate areas where the oxidation of the

63
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,319
soil must be avoided

64
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:14,239
however the method requires a

65
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:15,760
sedimentation pond to all settlement of

66
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:17,520
the suspended wastes to avoid

67
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:19,599
contaminating the drainage canal in the

68
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,360
natural environment

69
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:22,879
the remaining pathogens in the ponds can

70
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,360
be eliminated during the limiting

71
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:25,360
process

72
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:36,080
limit once the pond is cleaned it is

73
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:37,840
then filled with water and left

74
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:40,239
overnight before flushing out to remove

75
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:42,000
debris and elevate the ph

76
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:44,239
this process should be repeated until

77
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,720
the ph of the water remains above seven

78
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:48,480
and only then the lime is applied the

79
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:50,160
types of wine to be used depend on the

80
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:52,080
water ph

81
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:53,440
it is recommended that agricultural lime

82
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,920
calcium carbonate

83
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,720
calco 3 dot or dolomite magnesium

84
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,080
carbonate

85
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:02,080
ideally camg co3 2 should be used in a

86
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:04,000
pond with water ph near neutral and the

87
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:05,599
hydrated line calcium hydroxide

88
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,120
is an inorganic compound with the

89
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,360
chemical formula ca

90
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:11,599
oh two should be used in a pond with

91
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:13,360
water ph below five

92
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,280
the amount of line to be used should be

93
00:03:13,360 --> 00:03:17,200
carefully calculated to avoid inducing

94
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:19,200
an excessively high water ph

95
00:03:17,200 --> 00:03:23,120
which may increase ammonia toxicity and

96
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,120
result in the mortality of the koi fish

97
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:35,440
liming continued the lime requirement of

98
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:37,360
the pond depends on the soil ph

99
00:03:35,440 --> 00:03:39,120
the measurement of the soil ph should be

100
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:41,280
determined either by the wet soil method

101
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:43,280
or by the dry soil method

102
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:44,879
during the application lime should be

103
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,720
spread throughout the pond bottom and up

104
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:48,239
to the top of the dike

105
00:03:46,720 --> 00:03:50,000
a large portion of lime should be

106
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:51,519
applied over the feeding areas and to

107
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:52,560
all parts of the pond that have remained

108
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:54,239
wet

109
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:56,560
when the pond is properly lined and

110
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,599
filled with water the average water ph

111
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:02,799
should be between 7.5 to 8.5 with daily

112
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:05,360
fluctuation of less than 0.5

113
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:07,519
agricultural lime dolomite or hydrated

114
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,959
lime at 100 kg

115
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:14,239
day should be added to maintain the

116
00:04:08,959 --> 00:04:17,519
required ph

117
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:19,280
eradication of predators after liming

118
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,959
the pond should be filled to the maximum

119
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,560
depth through a screen with fine mesh to

120
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:24,479
prevent the predators and competitors

121
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:26,800
from entering the pond

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,720
these animals including fish link snake

123
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:31,199
head zone hello and in local dialect

124
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,320
crustaceans and some invertebrates may

125
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,240
compete for food

126
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:35,919
prey on the koi fry or carry diseases

127
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:37,520
and parasites

128
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:39,120
they may establish themselves in the

129
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:41,199
pond that is not effectively screened

130
00:04:39,120 --> 00:04:43,840
effectively or is left for a long period

131
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,840
of time

132
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:49,919
eradication of predators continued some

133
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,360
chemicals should be used to eradicate

134
00:04:49,919 --> 00:04:52,639
these animals in the pond before

135
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:54,240
stalking

136
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:56,240
snails can be eliminated by the

137
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:58,639
application of quickline chow

138
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,479
at 5 30 kg slash hot and sun dried for

139
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,560
two to three days

140
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:04,120
bleaching powder bleaching powder or

141
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:06,880
calcium hypochlorite

142
00:05:04,120 --> 00:05:08,560
caocl2 is another practical and safe

143
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,160
fish toxicant

144
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,440
it kills all the predatory and wheat

145
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:13,600
fish of the pond when applied at the

146
00:05:11,440 --> 00:05:16,720
rate of 25 to 30 ppm

147
00:05:13,600 --> 00:05:19,120
tripod etal 1980.

148
00:05:16,720 --> 00:05:21,120
however during storage significant

149
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,639
chlorine content is lost and hence it is

150
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:24,240
always safer to use the commercially

151
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:29,120
available bleaching powder at the rate

152
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:31,759
of 35 to 50 ppm or 350 to 500 kg

153
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:33,759
m of water fish kill occurs within one

154
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:38,240
to three hours and the toxicity lasts

155
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:41,039
for three to five days

156
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:43,039
eradication of predators continued

157
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:44,560
plankton invented fauna start developing

158
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,919
from the seventh or eighth day after

159
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:47,840
treatment

160
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:49,600
chlorine content of the bleaching powder

161
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:51,199
thoroughly disinfects the pond which is

162
00:05:49,600 --> 00:05:53,199
essential in undrainable ponds where

163
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,479
disinfection by sun drying is not at all

164
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:56,160
possible

165
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:57,680
disinfection of the pond is one of the

166
00:05:56,160 --> 00:06:00,160
essential measures for maintaining

167
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,560
proper health condition of the fish

168
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:04,720
besides it also satisfies the lime

169
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,400
requirement of the pond soil

170
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,160
the method of application is also

171
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:09,759
relatively simple

172
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:11,759
the powder is mixed with water and

173
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:13,120
uniformly spread over the entire water

174
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:14,880
surface

175
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:17,440
distressed and dead fish are removed by

176
00:06:14,880 --> 00:06:21,759
netting chlorine killed fish are safe

177
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:23,600
for human consumption

178
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,680
eradication of predators continued

179
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:27,680
calculation of dose

180
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:30,479
the required quantity of poison can be

181
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:34,560
calculated using the following formulae

182
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:38,800
for rectangular ponds see formula below

183
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:38,800
equals required amount of poison in kg

184
00:06:40,639 --> 00:06:44,560
eradication of predators continued

185
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:48,560
calculation of dose

186
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,800
for circular pawns see formula below

187
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:52,800
equals required amount of poison in kg

188
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,800
fertilization the pond must be

189
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:02,639
fertilized with either organic or

190
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:04,479
inorganic fertilizer to stimulate the

191
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:05,919
plankton bloom in order to provide shade

192
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:07,840
to the pond bottom and utilize the

193
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,199
nitrogenous and phosphate wastes within

194
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:10,880
the pond

195
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,880
the shade will also prevent the growth

196
00:07:10,880 --> 00:07:14,720
of harmful benthic algae

197
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:16,160
the sun-dried chicken manure is the most

198
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,120
common organic fertilizer

199
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:20,479
to be used in the amount of 200-300 kg

200
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:22,880
slash hot

201
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,400
the miner must be soaked in water for 24

202
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,360
hours before it is spread over the

203
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:27,360
surface of the water

204
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:33,759
fertilization continued inorganic

205
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:36,960
fertilizers

206
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:38,240
such as urea 46 n and compound

207
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:41,280
fertilizers like

208
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:41,759
ammonium phosphate 16 colon 20 colon

209
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,639
zero

210
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:47,039
or those with npk combination of 16

211
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:50,160
hours 16 minutes and 16 seconds

212
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:51,840
can be used at 20 30 kg slash hot

213
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,759
the fertilizer must be dissolved in

214
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:55,520
water before it is spread over the water

215
00:07:53,759 --> 00:07:57,280
surface to avoid precipitation of the

216
00:07:55,520 --> 00:07:59,120
fertilizer onto the pond bottom which

217
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:02,240
will enrich the soil and accelerate the

218
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,240
growth of benthic algae

219
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:13,360
fertilization continued after

220
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:14,960
fertilization

221
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:16,560
the plankton should bloom within a few

222
00:08:14,960 --> 00:08:18,160
days and the color of the water becomes

223
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:20,319
slightly green

224
00:08:18,160 --> 00:08:22,080
the fertilizer either the organic or

225
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:23,680
inorganic should be applied daily in the

226
00:08:22,080 --> 00:08:25,440
pond at five to ten percent of the

227
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:26,479
initial amount to maintain the plankton

228
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:28,400
bloom

229
00:08:26,479 --> 00:08:30,720
if the plankton has not bloomed within a

230
00:08:28,400 --> 00:08:31,520
few days additional fertilizer must not

231
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:33,519
be applied

232
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,719
but plankton-rich water or green water

233
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:38,159
from the

234
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:38,159
reservoir should be added
