1
00:00:02,389 --> 00:00:06,359
although for most of human history

2
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:09,179
people have been connected with the land

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:11,490
that fed them today this connection has

4
00:00:09,179 --> 00:00:13,590
been broken for most of us the majority

5
00:00:11,490 --> 00:00:15,570
of people do not know where and when

6
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:17,880
their food is grown they cannot touch

7
00:00:15,570 --> 00:00:20,160
the soil or talk to the farmer who tends

8
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:22,380
it food comes from stores and

9
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:25,170
restaurants and vending machines it has

10
00:00:22,380 --> 00:00:27,630
been washed processed packaged maybe

11
00:00:25,170 --> 00:00:30,779
even irradiated and transported long

12
00:00:27,630 --> 00:00:33,630
distances but this isn't the only way

13
00:00:30,779 --> 00:00:36,149
Community Supported Agriculture CSA

14
00:00:33,630 --> 00:00:38,340
along with other initiatives seeks to

15
00:00:36,149 --> 00:00:39,809
shorten food supply chains and restore

16
00:00:38,340 --> 00:00:42,600
the connection between farmers and

17
00:00:39,809 --> 00:00:44,610
consumers in a way that we socializes

18
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:46,559
food and enables products to reach

19
00:00:44,610 --> 00:00:49,079
consumers embedded with valuable

20
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,180
information Community Supported

21
00:00:49,079 --> 00:00:53,520
Agriculture is a connection between a

22
00:00:51,180 --> 00:00:56,340
nearby farmer and the people who eat the

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,260
food that he or she produces the essence

24
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:00,930
of this relationship is mutual

25
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:03,059
commitment the farm feeds the people and

26
00:01:00,930 --> 00:01:05,760
the people support the farm and share

27
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,549
the inherent risks and rewards indeed

28
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,979
CSA is an innovative model of food

29
00:01:08,549 --> 00:01:12,479
production and distribution it consists

30
00:01:10,979 --> 00:01:14,970
in a partnership between a group of

31
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:16,979
consumers and the local proximity farmer

32
00:01:14,970 --> 00:01:19,250
where consumers pay for the costs of the

33
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,950
production usually for a seasons term

34
00:01:19,250 --> 00:01:24,360
CSA farmers are open for partnership

35
00:01:21,950 --> 00:01:27,270
cooperation and communication with

36
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:29,490
consumers together with consumers by

37
00:01:27,270 --> 00:01:31,200
mutual agreement farmers calculate the

38
00:01:29,490 --> 00:01:33,540
cost of production and of the weekly

39
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:35,729
basket plan the crop rotation and

40
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:38,610
provide regular information about

41
00:01:35,729 --> 00:01:40,500
farming and harvest consumers are not

42
00:01:38,610 --> 00:01:42,630
just passive recipients of safe food

43
00:01:40,500 --> 00:01:44,369
they actively participate in the

44
00:01:42,630 --> 00:01:47,119
collective management of the partnership

45
00:01:44,369 --> 00:01:49,710
their participation ensures transparency

46
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,860
equality mutual assistance and

47
00:01:49,710 --> 00:01:54,689
democratic management of CSA consumers

48
00:01:52,860 --> 00:01:55,440
are not only citizens willing to cook

49
00:01:54,689 --> 00:01:57,660
and eat at

50
00:01:55,440 --> 00:01:59,760
a variety of local food but they are

51
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:02,850
also partners sharing the benefits and

52
00:01:59,760 --> 00:02:04,740
risks usually food distributions take

53
00:02:02,850 --> 00:02:06,300
place at a common point with the

54
00:02:04,740 --> 00:02:09,750
voluntary assistance from one or more

55
00:02:06,300 --> 00:02:11,640
consumers the CSA movement has developed

56
00:02:09,750 --> 00:02:13,830
in the second part of the 20th century

57
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,590
in different parts of the world starting

58
00:02:13,830 --> 00:02:18,660
with Japan in the 70s all are different

59
00:02:16,590 --> 00:02:23,010
but various initiatives share four

60
00:02:18,660 --> 00:02:24,600
essential traits one partnership CSA is

61
00:02:23,010 --> 00:02:26,760
based on a partnership

62
00:02:24,600 --> 00:02:29,280
usually formalized through an individual

63
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:31,440
contract between each consumer and the

64
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:36,630
food producer and characterized by

65
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:39,210
mutual commitment to local dimension CSA

66
00:02:36,630 --> 00:02:42,380
movement is oriented towards making the

67
00:02:39,210 --> 00:02:45,810
food production local again three

68
00:02:42,380 --> 00:02:48,090
solidarity CSAs are based on solidarity

69
00:02:45,810 --> 00:02:50,910
between producers and support groups and

70
00:02:48,090 --> 00:02:52,860
involves sharing both the risks and

71
00:02:50,910 --> 00:02:55,350
benefits of an extensive small-scale

72
00:02:52,860 --> 00:02:57,690
production adapted to the natural rhythm

73
00:02:55,350 --> 00:02:59,820
of the seasons a production respectful

74
00:02:57,690 --> 00:03:02,520
of the environment and of the natural

75
00:02:59,820 --> 00:03:04,970
and cultural heritage a fair income for

76
00:03:02,520 --> 00:03:08,550
the farmer to guarantee a dignified life

77
00:03:04,970 --> 00:03:11,040
for the producer consumer tandem is

78
00:03:08,550 --> 00:03:12,690
another key feature of CSA meaning that

79
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:15,209
the partnerships are based on direct

80
00:03:12,690 --> 00:03:18,600
person-to-person contact and Trust with

81
00:03:15,209 --> 00:03:19,750
no intermediary and hierarchy in Europe

82
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:22,180
today more

83
00:03:19,750 --> 00:03:23,800
half a million people participate in CSA

84
00:03:22,180 --> 00:03:27,430
partnerships and their number is

85
00:03:23,800 --> 00:03:29,710
continuously growing why participants in

86
00:03:27,430 --> 00:03:31,600
CSA is benefit from receiving fresh food

87
00:03:29,710 --> 00:03:33,550
from a known source produced in a

88
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:36,310
responsible manner of sustainable

89
00:03:33,550 --> 00:03:38,760
agriculture the environmental benefits

90
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:40,900
of fewer food miles less packaging and

91
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:43,709
ecologically sensitive farming with

92
00:03:40,900 --> 00:03:46,510
improved animal welfare a local economy

93
00:03:43,709 --> 00:03:49,660
enhances higher employment more local

94

processing and local consumption CSAs

95
00:03:49,660 --> 00:03:53,459
have a direct contribution to the

96
00:03:51,400 --> 00:03:56,260
support of sustainable farming and

97
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:58,810
biodiversity conservation what's in it

98
00:03:56,260 --> 00:04:00,850
for small-scale farmers a more secure

99
00:03:58,810 --> 00:04:02,860
income more time for planning and

100
00:04:00,850 --> 00:04:05,020
farming as they don't have to spend time

101
00:04:02,860 --> 00:04:07,390
to sell their produce is on markets a

102
00:04:05,020 --> 00:04:10,239
higher and fairer return for their

103
00:04:07,390 --> 00:04:12,520

initiatives for the future trust and

108
00:04:19,930 --> 00:04:25,540
care we hunger for a true connection to

109
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:28,210
what's on our plates we want to know who

110
00:04:25,540 --> 00:04:31,150
grows our food and where how it's grown

111
00:04:28,210 --> 00:04:33,419
and why we want to participate in a food

112
00:04:31,150 --> 00:04:36,130
system that is ecological just

113
00:04:33,419 --> 00:04:39,100
