00:00:26,720 --> 00:00:32,080
and hydroponics growing

unit five

00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:40,480
hydroponics defined

6
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:42,399
soilless growing is nearly synonymous

7
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,800
with hydroponics though technically

8
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:47,120
soilless could to apply to growing with

9
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:48,879
medium like shredded bark

10
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,520
but for the purposes of this unit we're

11
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:53,600
treating soilus and hydroponics as the

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,399
same thing

13
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:58,960
hydroponics means growing plants without

14
00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,199
soil using water is the medium that

15
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:03,199
holds the nutrients necessary for plant

16
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:04,720
growth

17
00:01:03,199 --> 00:01:06,240
there are any number of ways to

18
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,159
accomplish

19
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:10,720
hydroponic growing

20
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:13,119
so the term really embraces a huge array

21
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:15,759
of possibilities including indoor and

22
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:18,479
outdoor growing trays or troughs water

23
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:20,799
only using a root support system such as

24
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,280
expanded clay pellets or mineral wool

25
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,840
and much more

26
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,680
for instance

27
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:30,000
a photograph of a simple hydroponic

28
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:30,000
system

29
00:01:30,560 --> 00:01:33,600
hydroponics doesn't have to be

30
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,040
complicated as you can see from this

31
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:37,119
picture

32
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:40,880
this is very simple hydroponic growing

33
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:43,119
system a crocus bulb and a glass

34
00:01:40,880 --> 00:01:45,119
bulbs such as crocus

35
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:46,880
contain sufficient nutrients to put out

36
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:49,119
leaves and flour without additional

37
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:52,079
inputs

38
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:54,560
but if nutrients were added to the water

39
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:56,960
this would qualify as a full hydroponic

40
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,960
system

41
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:03,439
this is a little more involved

42
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,799
hydroponic system

43
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,799
this hydroponic system

44
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,560
is growing plants

45
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,640
in screen houses outdoors this is

46
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,720
different from greenhouse growing the

47
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:18,480
prevailing climate has an effect the

48
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:20,319
screens

49
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,160
help protect the plants from insects and

50
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:23,840
other potential pests such as rabbits

51
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
and deer

52
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:28,480
while being much less expensive than

53
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,080
putting up a greenhouse

54
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,400
they can also be configured as shade

55
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:34,239
houses for crops requiring

56
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:36,560
less lighter for those crops that we

57
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,280
might want to shade for some reason such

58
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,280
as blanching

59
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:44,800
what are some of the positive aspects of

60
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:47,120
hydroponic growing

61
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,440
hydroponics can be done outdoors

62
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:52,160
can be done in greenhouses can be done

63
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,640
indoors under lights

64
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:57,599
it's suited to the production of a wide

65
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:57,599
variety of crops

66
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,599
perhaps one of the more important

67
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:06,000
aspects is it can be used on land that

68
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:08,080
isn't suitable for crop production

69
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:11,200
in soil such as

70
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,120
paved or gravel covered areas

71
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:15,760
and it can cost significantly less to

72
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,319
get started than the remediation of such

73
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:19,319
areas would cost

74
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,440
hydroponics can also be done vertically

75
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:26,959
requiring

76
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
very little ground space

77
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:33,840
hydroponic systems can be built from off

78
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:33,840
the shelf or recycled parts

79
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:39,200
weeds are generally not a problem in

80
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,200
most hydroponic systems

81
00:03:39,440 --> 00:03:44,239
and because hydroponic systems are

82
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,319
self-contained pollution from runoff

83
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:49,519
isn't an issue

84
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:51,360
because there is no runoff

85
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
and even though hydroponic systems are

86
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:56,879
based on water they actually use much

87
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:59,360
less water than traditional outdoor

88
00:03:56,879 --> 00:04:01,840
growing or even traditional greenhouse

89
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:01,840
growing

90
00:04:03,120 --> 00:04:07,040
so what are maybe some of the negative

91
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:09,040
aspects

92
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,120
well they do require some mechanical

93
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,120
ability to set up if you get more

94
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:15,280
complicated than putting a crocus bulb

95
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:17,199
in a glass

96
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:19,600
by definition they do require the

97
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
availability of water but then so does

98
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:24,079
all growing of

99
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,079
plants

100
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,280
most systems make extensive use of

101
00:04:26,560 --> 00:04:32,479
non-sustainable products such as plastic

102
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:34,880
though recycled plastic could be used

103
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:37,600
most systems require electrical power to

104
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:37,600
run the pumps

105
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:42,560
and setting up larger systems can

106
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,720
require a significant investment in both

107
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:46,720
time and money

108
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:49,840
and finally most fertilizers for

109
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:53,600
hydroponics are not currently organic or

110
00:04:49,840 --> 00:04:56,400
sustainable in nature

111
00:04:53,600 --> 00:04:58,880
so how do we grow plants

112
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,440
in water

113
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:04,400
well one way is to use

114
00:05:01,440 --> 00:05:05,600
a root holding

115
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:10,440
medium

116
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:10,440
like these expanded clay pellets

117
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,919
these are

118
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,520
simply

119
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:20,000
pellets made from clay they don't really

120
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:22,400
maintain the nutrient levels they don't

121
00:05:20,000 --> 00:05:24,880
do anything other than provide support

122
00:05:22,400 --> 00:05:27,280
for the plant roots

123
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,479
and let the hydroponic

124
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,280
water

125
00:05:28,479 --> 00:05:33,280
nutrient solution drain through

126
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,280
so that the roots have access to some

127
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,000
oxygen

128
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:40,080
and other root holding systems include

129
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,000
mineral or rockwool

130
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:44,000
lava rock pea gravel

131
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:51,199
all sorts of systems

132
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:53,039
that don't necessarily require that they

133
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:56,080
be nutrient rich

134
00:05:53,039 --> 00:05:58,479
as soil growing would

135
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,880
here's another fairly simple hydroponic

136
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:05,199
system

137
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:08,560
this system just uses bales of straw

138
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,639
as the root support system

139
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:12,000
the hydroponic solution

140
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,080
is pumped

141
00:06:12,000 --> 00:06:15,840
and drips through

142
00:06:14,080 --> 00:06:18,960
down through the straw

143
00:06:15,840 --> 00:06:21,199
past the root system of the plants

144
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:22,880
the solution collects on the plastic

145
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,479
sheets

146
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:28,560
where it can be reabsorbed by the bales

147
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,680
or collected at one end

148
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:33,440
and re-circulated

149
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:34,880
a system such as this might be a little

150
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:37,120
less efficient

151
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:39,840
use of water than some other systems

152
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:42,000
but it's extremely simple system to set

153
00:06:39,840 --> 00:06:42,000
up

154
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:49,280
here we see a close-up of this

155
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,880
straw based system

156
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:55,919
and you can see running across the

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:58,880
top of the bales

158
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:58,880
is that black line

159
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:03,840
nutrient solution is pumped

160
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:09,840
down that black line

161
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:13,599
it then comes out of these smaller

162
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:13,599
tubes you see sticking off the side

163
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,280
and it can drip through the bottom of

164
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:18,720
the black line directly in the top of

165
00:07:17,280 --> 00:07:22,240
the bales and then it can go through the

166
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:22,240
other lines to the side of the bales

167
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:26,160
extremely simple system and you can see

168
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:28,160
over on the left hand side how the

169
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,080
plastic is raised up against the edge of

170
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
the greenhouse

171
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,880
basically forms a trough

172
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:37,520
to allow the water to be collected and

173
00:07:34,880 --> 00:07:37,520
recycled

174
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:48,800
here's a photograph showing

175
00:07:44,840 --> 00:07:48,800
hydroponically grown lettuce

176
00:07:49,120 --> 00:07:53,919
in a

177
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,080
basket using expanded clay pellets

178
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:58,160
as a root support system you can see the

179
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:01,360
roots of the lettuce plant produce

180
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:01,360
protruding from the bottom

181
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,800
now if you look at the photograph

182
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,960
carefully you can see

183
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,879
that the system basically consists of a

184
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:13,599
large diameter pipe

185
00:08:10,879 --> 00:08:15,199
with holes the size of the pots

186
00:08:13,599 --> 00:08:18,000
drilled into the pipe and the pots

187
00:08:15,199 --> 00:08:20,160
simply sit in those holes the ledge or

188
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:21,759
ridge around the top of the pot

189
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
sits on top of the

190
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:25,120
pipe

191
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:26,720
keeps the pot from falling into the

192
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:29,360
into the tubing

193
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:32,160
water then containing nutrients is run

194
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:32,160
through that pipe

195
00:08:32,560 --> 00:08:34,640
and

196
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:36,399
that's how the plants get their

198
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:41,599
can see

199
00:08:37,360 --> 00:08:43,839
another pipe inside the larger pipe

200
00:08:41,599 --> 00:08:45,680

201
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:48,320
second pipe inside the larger pipe has

202
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,120
holes drilled in it

203
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,640
tiny holes at each one of the locations

204
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:53,680
along the pipe where those pots are

205
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:57,040
placed

206
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:59,519

nutrient solution

209
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:07,120
nutrient solution in the pipe does not

210
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:10,160

managing hydroponic systems

213
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:16,560
well hydroponic systems can be automated

00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:18,640
to a great degree

215
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,320
the pumps for water circulation will be

monitored electronically

219
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,120
because conditions are very consistent

220
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:31,519
i.e the nutrients that all the plants

221
00:09:29,120 --> 00:09:34,399
get usually the amount of sunlight that

all the plants get

the

224
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:42,560
process of managing the crop

225
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:44,880
can be easier than those crops grown

226
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:45,920

growth

00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:49,680

229
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:51,680
consistent

230
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:52,800

maximum production can be achieved

[Music]

237
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:05,440
because of the automation

238
00:10:03,760 --> 00:10:07,920
and the consistent growing conditions

239
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:08,800
that hydroponic systems have

240
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:11,680
the

241
00:10:08,800 --> 00:10:13,920
systems can be run by fewer

242
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:18,399
workers than a traditional soil based

243
00:10:13,920 --> 00:10:20,399
agriculture for any given crop yield

244
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,760
so it's a very

245
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:24,160
efficient

systems

249
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:32,560
the systems can be designed to be

250
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,480
scalable that is you can start small

251
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:36,959
and then add additional capacity as

252
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:36,959
required

253
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:41,680
though with greenhouse based systems the

254
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:43,920
most efficiency is gained by utilizing

255
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:46,320
all the space in the greenhouse

256
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:48,480
at once since heating and cooling costs

257
00:10:46,320 --> 00:10:51,519
remain constant

258
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:53,600
regardless of whether you're using

259
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,480
all the space or one tenth of space or

260
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:56,480
one half the space

261
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:00,880
however you can start with a single

262
00:10:59,040 --> 00:11:02,800
greenhouse or hoop house

263
00:11:00,880 --> 00:11:04,320
and add additional hoop houses as

264
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:06,399
required

265
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,240
and as your market grows

266
00:11:06,399 --> 00:11:11,440
outdoor systems

267
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:12,839
can be scaled quite easily but are of

268
00:11:11,440 --> 00:11:15,839
course at the mercy of the growing

269
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,680
system in northern or temperate climbs

270
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,399

275
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:29,540
the systems are quite scalable and quite

276
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:33,519
efficient

278
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:39,279
finally a little additional information

279
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:41,360
watch the assigned videos that's true

280
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:45,279
for all the units but

281
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:47,200
in this course in this case

282
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,320
the videos cover a wide range of

283
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:52,639
hydroponic setups from large factory

284
00:11:50,320 --> 00:11:55,120
type greenhouses to small systems that

285
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,480
you can easily build from off the shelf

286
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:58,480
and recycled components

287
00:11:59,200 --> 00:12:04,720
as you watch the videos pay particular

288
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:07,440
attention to the required infrastructure

289
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:09,040
from greenhouses to computer control

290
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:11,279
systems

291
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,290
down to the simplest systems with

292
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:15,040
buckets and hoses

293
00:12:13,290 --> 00:12:17,360
[Music]

294
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,399
and note the relative efficiency of each

295
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:20,079
system

296
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:22,560
in terms of the manpower and other

297
00:12:20,079 --> 00:12:24,160
resources required to make it run

298
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,399
such as electricity and heating and

299
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:28,639
cooling

300
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:30,399
and finally listen for the figures given

301
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:33,440
for crop yields

302
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:35,120
compared to traditional farming methods

303
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:37,200
you may be surprised

304
00:12:35,120 --> 00:12:40,240
i want to say one more thing here about

305
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:43,040
the relative efficiency of each system

306
00:12:40,240 --> 00:12:44,639
the more automated a system is the more

307
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:48,240
efficient it is

308
00:12:44,639 --> 00:12:52,880
in terms of manpower however

309
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:56,079
greater degree of automation may require

310
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,519
more electricity

311
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,839
may require

312
00:12:57,519 --> 00:13:01,200
more heating and cooling because

313
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:03,040
the best

314
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:05,040
most efficient automated systems are

315
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,680
done indoors and greenhouses

316
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:10,560
so that's a thing to watch for as you

317
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,720
see all these videos

318
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:16,040
and that concludes the presentation for

319
00:13:12,720 --> 00:13:16,040
unit 5.
