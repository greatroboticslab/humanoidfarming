that we've organized as part of a

00:00:07,759 --> 00:00:12,160
webinar series on targeting

5
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,519
and community networks and anti-poverty

6
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,039

um marcel was the

10
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:25,920
first person to teach me about

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,160
development economics

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,199
way back when at stanford in graduate

13
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:31,279
school

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:33,760
so it's always great to see him and he's

15
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:36,480
going to share some of his work on

16
00:00:33,760 --> 00:00:38,640
mobilizing p2p diffusion in bangladesh

17
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:40,399
marcel it's all yours

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,000
thanks a lot well it's a great pleasure

19
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:44,559
to to be uh

20
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,039
to be uh talking to you guys

21
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:48,559
um this is work with uh

22
00:00:47,039 --> 00:00:51,039
joint work with assad islam who i

23
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:52,800
believe is uh attending

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:55,840
abdul malek who also said he would be

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:58,480
attending and devayan pakrashi

26
00:00:55,840 --> 00:01:02,239
um and it's a second paper we've uh done

27
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,559
together about uh basically about how to

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:04,559
um

29
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,280
to promote the diffusion of agricultural

30
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,640
technology and focusing on a specific

31
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:13,840
technology called

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:13,840
systems of rice

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,530
intensification sri

34
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:19,439
which has

35
00:01:17,530 --> 00:01:21,119
[Music]

36
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:22,159
the advantage and drawback that it

37
00:01:21,119 --> 00:01:23,439
doesn't

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:25,119
include

39
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:27,520
it doesn't require additional input so

40
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:30,159
it's an advantage for for for also

41
00:01:27,520 --> 00:01:32,000
because you don't run into issues of uh

42
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:34,159
people having liquidity constraints or

43
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:35,360
things like that

44
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:36,640
um

45
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:38,479
but then

46
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,240
the downside is that it's actually a

47
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:41,920
difficult technology to master and so

48
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:44,079
people uh the difficulty with this

49
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:46,240
technology is um

50
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:48,640
how to to train

51
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,880
farmers in applying it

52
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
okay

53
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:54,399
and so

54
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,479
of course you could try to train all the

55
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,840
potential beneficiaries or put because

56
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,000
you know if you don't know who's going

57
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:02,320
to benefit from it you can try to train

58
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,880
everybody

59
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,799
but that's obviously going to be costly

60
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:09,119
and so with brac we've been trying to

61
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:11,920
break in bangladesh we've been trying to

62
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:14,480
find ways of

63
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,319
of targeting

64
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,760
many beneficiaries if you want the

65
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:19,360
farmers who would benefit from this

66
00:02:17,760 --> 00:02:21,200
innovation

67
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:23,120
of targeting them better the first the

68
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:25,200
first article we wrote about that which

69
00:02:23,120 --> 00:02:26,800
we tried to get

70
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:29,520
we trained some farmers and then we

71
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,879
asked them to recommend to refer

72
00:02:29,520 --> 00:02:31,760
basically

73
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,200
um

74
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:36,000
all the farmers they thought would

75
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:38,560
benefit from the from the training so

76
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,959
that was the first step we did

77
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:43,040
that kind of worked and

78
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:45,920
it didn't really work like the way we

79
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:47,680
were expecting we were expecting the

80
00:02:45,920 --> 00:02:50,080
the referred

81
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:52,640
trainees to be

82
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,760
adopting you know to be better adopters

83
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:56,080
basically we

84
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:58,080
basically better targeted

85
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,120
and that's that's not really what we

86
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:01,599
found

87
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,760
so this time we tried another approach

88
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:06,080
which is um

89
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:08,239
you know has a long history in

90
00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:10,000
agricultural extension which is is

91
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:11,280
basically based on the idea of a model

92
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:13,680
farmer

93
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:15,920
uh but we try to improve it basically so

94
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:17,599
but if you remember the model farmer the

95
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:19,920
extension agent comes to the village and

96
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:22,319
says i can't i can't you know teach

97
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:23,200
everybody so i'm going to uh to select

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:25,519
some

99
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,840
farmers who i believe are

100
00:03:25,519 --> 00:03:30,000
role models for others

101
00:03:27,840 --> 00:03:31,760
who are also more receptive to

102
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:32,959
innovation and i'm going to train them

103
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:34,560
and then

104
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,720
i'm going to hope that

105
00:03:34,560 --> 00:03:38,640
this will then naturally

106
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:41,280
diffuse

107
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:44,159
through an unspecified process through

108
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:46,799
the the local population okay i'm sure

109
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,080
they are more more more structured ways

110
00:03:46,799 --> 00:03:49,680
of doing it but

111
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,120
that's kind of a a rough

112
00:03:49,680 --> 00:03:53,439
characterization of what the model

113
00:03:51,120 --> 00:03:56,560
farmer approaches

114
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:58,560
and um so what we try to do here is

115
00:03:56,560 --> 00:04:00,959
we're going to try to we're going to

116
00:03:58,560 --> 00:04:04,319
start from that

117
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:06,799
and um but instead of hoping that these

118
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,840
these model farmers

119
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,920
um

120
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:11,920
you know do viral marketing basically

121
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:14,080
they basically become

122
00:04:11,920 --> 00:04:15,599
your your champions your marketing

123
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:17,199
agents for your for your for your

124
00:04:15,599 --> 00:04:19,759
innovation

125
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,680
uh we're gonna actually ask them

126
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
to train two farmers we're gonna assign

127
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:25,040
them these two farmers when we say okay

128
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,479
you know you're gonna train

129
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,479
jack and jill

130
00:04:26,479 --> 00:04:30,000
these are the two the two trainees were

131
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,520
assigned to you and there you go you

132
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:31,870
know

133
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:33,520
um

134
00:04:31,870 --> 00:04:35,120
[Music]

135
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:36,720
try to do a good job of it so that's the

136
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:38,639
that's the basic idea that we have our

137
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
intervention is basically

138
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:41,840
taking

139
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:44,080
trainees people who have received this

140
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,720
one day

141
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:49,120
course on uh

142
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:51,600
on sri from brac

143
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,680
and we're gonna

144
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:54,840
assign them

145
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,520
to

146
00:04:54,840 --> 00:04:59,280
other uh farmers

147
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:01,600
who could have been trainees could have

148
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,759
been black trainees uh but we're going

149
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,160
to say well what do we can we go can we

150
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:08,080
what what fraction of

151
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:11,600
the effect of brac training can we

152
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,680
achieve by asking this these trainees to

153
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:15,919
themselves teach other farmers that's

154
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,080
that that's the logic so each each of

155
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:19,520
the so we call them teacher trainees

156
00:05:18,080 --> 00:05:20,960
sometimes they call them teachers for

157
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:22,960
short but obviously they are not school

158
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,199
teachers they just

159
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:26,960
asked to teach other other farmers in

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:28,880
our experiment

161
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:30,160
can i ask a clarificatory question

162
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:32,880
please

163
00:05:30,160 --> 00:05:34,639
so how much uh experience do these

164
00:05:32,880 --> 00:05:36,479
teacher trainees have with the

165
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:39,600
technology before they're expected to

166
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:41,280
train others no

167
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:43,600
they don't have any

168
00:05:41,280 --> 00:05:45,919
they don't have any

169
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,280
ex experience with the technology

170
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:50,160
so you set the experience so they have

171
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:52,080
been they received a one-day

172
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:53,360
training

173
00:05:52,080 --> 00:05:55,840
from black

174
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:59,360
and then they are asked to you know can

175
00:05:55,840 --> 00:06:02,160
you teach the the

176
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:02,440
the instruction list that you you have

177
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:03,680
been

178
00:06:02,440 --> 00:06:05,199
[Music]

179
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:06,560
you know told and

180
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:09,360
to talk about

181
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:11,120
uh to these two other people

182
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:12,880
and people take a quiz

183
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,400
and so basically we're going to be we're

184
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:16,639
going to be comparing adoption between

185
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:18,319
teacher trainees and trainees and of

186
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:21,039
course we also have control farmers who

187
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:23,039
didn't receive any training we have

188
00:06:21,039 --> 00:06:24,880
control farmers in the

189
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:26,720
treated villages where some people

190
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,280
receive the training we also have

191
00:06:26,720 --> 00:06:31,280
control of uh farmers in villages where

192
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,720
there was no training whatsoever

193
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:34,000
so i'll talk about that in detail in a

194
00:06:32,720 --> 00:06:36,479
minute but that's the that's the way

195
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:38,080
we're going to try to see whether

196
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,880
um

197
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,360
whether this model uh transfers

198
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:45,360
knowledge so we're going to quiz the the

199
00:06:43,360 --> 00:06:47,360
trainees the teacher trainees

200
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,479
at the end on what they're supposed to

201
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
be learning

202
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,120
and we're going to teach the

203
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,440
the students of these uh teacher

204
00:06:53,120 --> 00:06:58,319
trainees who did not receive the brag

205
00:06:55,440 --> 00:07:00,240
training i'm going to quiz them about

206
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,840
about their knowledge as well and then

207
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,199
we're going to see whether they have you

208
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:06,479
know

209
00:07:03,199 --> 00:07:08,240
we we also have uh we know that uh the

210
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:10,720
the average farmer who has not been

211
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:12,400
trained does not know what sri is in

212
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,080
this particular part of the world so

213
00:07:12,400 --> 00:07:16,080
it's not it's not like they would not

214
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:18,720
naturally know what it is and then we

215
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:21,120
also look at adoption um of the

216
00:07:18,720 --> 00:07:23,360
recommended practices later on

217
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:25,520
and we which is measured by brac and

218
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:27,759
then we also um

219
00:07:25,520 --> 00:07:30,639
have a deadline survey where we measure

220
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:32,960
uh agricultural outcomes like profits

221
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:35,919
and yields

222
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:37,840
so that's the that's the basic idea i'll

223
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:40,400
go through the to the intervention more

224
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,680
detail in a minute

225
00:07:40,400 --> 00:07:43,520
um

226
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:45,599
there are some villages we incentivize

227
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,879
the teachers to

228
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,400
basically we thought maybe if we

229
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:51,759
incentivize them they would do a better

230
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:52,960
job so they are incentivized to teach

231
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,120
um

232
00:07:52,960 --> 00:07:57,280
to the test

233
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,039
so basically they they've already taken

234
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,440
a test and they're told well you will

235
00:07:59,039 --> 00:08:02,560
test your students uh using the same

236
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:03,759
quiz

237
00:08:02,560 --> 00:08:05,520
and then we'll we'll give you an

238
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:07,520
incentive if they answer the quiz

239
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,360
questions well

240
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,400
so that's basically testing whether they

241
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:12,720
can

242
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:16,080
they can convey these key information

243
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:18,879
about sri to their to their students

244
00:08:16,080 --> 00:08:22,000
and uh we hope that that knowledge and

245
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:24,319
translates into into a higher adoption

246
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:26,400
adoption

247
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:29,280
and then you know from the model farmer

248
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,440
idea this modern farmer idea

249
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,599
so remember the the key idea of that

250
00:08:31,440 --> 00:08:35,680
model was that this person was a role

251
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,080
model for the farmers and therefore the

252
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:39,200
other farmers would want to copy him or

253
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:40,800
her

254
00:08:39,200 --> 00:08:42,959
so we thought well maybe we can emulate

255
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:44,800
that as well i mean here

256
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:47,680
so the way we did that

257
00:08:44,800 --> 00:08:50,080
is that we ask in baseline we ask each

258
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,040
of the farmers in our sample

259
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:52,480
to

260
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:56,800
to

261
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,880
list at most five other farmers in in in

262
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,040
the list we given them

263
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:03,519
whom they would regard as as role models

264
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:05,519
basically

265
00:09:03,519 --> 00:09:07,519
whom they would basically

266
00:09:05,519 --> 00:09:09,279
whom they would consider as sources of

267
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:11,120
valuable information for for

268
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:13,279
agricultural technology so that's the

269
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:14,480
that's the idea

270
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,959
and um

271
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:18,240
and then basically in a way i'll explain

272
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:20,000
where we

273
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,560
you know remember each teacher trainee

274
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:24,240
gets two students assigned to him

275
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,120
they're all male

276
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,320
um

277
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:28,560
so

278
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:29,760
and one of them is going to be someone

279
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:31,920
who has

280
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:34,080
who has nominated that farmer as a role

281
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:35,760
model who has listed him as a role model

282
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,760
and the other one is someone who is not

283
00:09:35,760 --> 00:09:39,120
normally anything as a role model so

284
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,480
that's the idea

285
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:42,080
and the idea is

286
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:44,560
based on this

287
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:46,000
smaller farmer idea is that it's a role

288
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:48,080
model therefore it's going to work

289
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:51,120
better

290
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,760
in terms of diffusing the innovation

291
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:55,680
from teacher trainees to those farmers

292
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:58,000
that nominated them to those farmers

293
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,680
that regard them regarding teacher

294
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,480
training as a role model so that's the

295
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:02,480
that's the key idea

296
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:06,720
um and and this is done through an

297
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:09,920
algorithm i'll describe in a minute so

298
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:12,079
that's the basic idea of what we do

299
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:14,160
um

300
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:16,640
in terms of and i'll explain that the

301
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:18,800
experiment more detail obviously

302
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,680
in terms of just to remind i'm sure some

303
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:23,360
of you already know what uh this system

304
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:27,279
perhaps even better than i do what the

305
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:29,360
system of rising intensification is

306
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:31,839
but my understanding of it is basically

307
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:33,839
it's a set of different practices that

308
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:35,360
have to do with transplanting the way

309
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,160
you do the transplanting the data

310
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:41,440
transplanting and especially things like

311
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:42,880
spacing thinning and

312
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,480
the way you water the plant the

313
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:45,360
regularity of the water in the plant and

314
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:46,399
so on

315
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
so this is

316
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:50,399
space they have to be

317
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,800
basically spaced

318
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:54,880
further apart from each other and and

319
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:56,560
there's going to be more thinning that

320
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,720
what farmers would normally do and as a

321
00:10:56,560 --> 00:11:01,519
result these these

322
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:03,200
single plants that survive grow bigger

323
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:05,760
and they get they get more grain so

324
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,120
that's that's the logic of sri as far as

325
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:10,240
i understand it

326
00:11:07,120 --> 00:11:12,160
now you can see there's no

327
00:11:10,240 --> 00:11:13,839
you know these are all practices there's

328
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,920
no um

329
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:19,519
inputs required so there's no there's no

330
00:11:15,920 --> 00:11:23,360
purchased inputs i mean uh that are

331
00:11:19,519 --> 00:11:26,079
related to adoption of sri

332
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:28,959
so that that means several things um it

333
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:31,120
means things that

334
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:33,680
if it was a fertilizer or a new seed or

335
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,360
a new pesticide or something farmers

336
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,680
could in principle go to the to the

337
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:39,839
seller of this input and

338
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:41,600
ask them you know what should i use on

339
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:43,200
my rice how should i use it how should i

340
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,279
apply or when

341
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:47,519
there's no such thing here so we don't

342
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,160
have to worry about contamination of our

343
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:51,680
sample by some external agent who comes

344
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:54,079
and gives them

345
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:56,320
information about this technology okay

346
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:58,480
so that simplifies our work it's it

347
00:11:56,320 --> 00:12:01,760
makes uh eliminate it reduces

348
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,920
contamination from external uh actors or

349
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:04,880
vendors in this case

350
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,440
um

351
00:12:04,880 --> 00:12:08,880
it also means that you don't you don't

352
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:10,560
have to worry about externalities

353
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:12,959
through input markets i mean if you if

354
00:12:10,560 --> 00:12:14,800
you introduce a new uh and use a new

355
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,040
fertilizer let's say

356
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:19,040
and uh

357
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:21,120
there's a whole value chain has to bring

358
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:23,680
this fertilizer to the villages

359
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:25,040
and only you know nobody only you are

360
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:26,079
the only one who wants to buy it you

361
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:27,440
know chances are you're not going to

362
00:12:26,079 --> 00:12:28,720
find it because the

363
00:12:27,440 --> 00:12:30,240
the traders are not going to find it

364
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:32,079
useful to bring the fertilizer to the

365
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:33,360
village just in the off chance that you

366
00:12:32,079 --> 00:12:35,680
might buy

367
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:36,959
this one bag of fertilizer so they it's

368
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,399
so they're going to be networking

369
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:39,920
externalities in the sense that you know

370
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,839
the more people are buying it the more

371
00:12:39,920 --> 00:12:44,480
it will make sense for

372
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:46,399
um sellers of agricultural inputs to

373
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:48,160
stock it and therefore you would have

374
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,200
and you will have more information and

375
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,800
the other farmers will have more

376
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:53,360
information so you get into this kind of

377
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:55,120
system of externality so we don't have

378
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,560
to work that the problem with that is

379
00:12:55,120 --> 00:13:00,560
that that would break sudvas so

380
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:02,480
so i mean we're already looking at

381
00:13:00,560 --> 00:13:04,639
diffusion which is something that's very

382
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:06,720
already by name by nature kind of breaks

383
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,120
breaks and subverts somewhat

384
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:12,000
so we we we don't want more to have to

385
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:14,639
worry about more violations on server

386
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:17,040
uh that we have to

387
00:13:14,639 --> 00:13:18,399
could there be an effect on the quantity

388
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,639
of inputs that they purchased i'm

389
00:13:18,399 --> 00:13:21,920
wondering if you have to space out yeah

390
00:13:20,639 --> 00:13:25,600
you will look at that but we're not

391
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:28,399
introducing any new inputs yeah

392
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:29,600
but we'll look at that yeah

393
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:31,680
um

394
00:13:29,600 --> 00:13:32,560
the the main thing though is it's it's i

395
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,000
would

396
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:35,760
people sometimes describe this

397
00:13:34,000 --> 00:13:37,600
technology as more labor-intensive it's

398
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:39,279
it seems like we just because the

399
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:41,360
farmers have to go and visit the field

400
00:13:39,279 --> 00:13:43,839
sometimes more often but really it's

401
00:13:41,360 --> 00:13:45,760
more management incentives intensive

402
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:47,279
they have to be more careful and they

403
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:48,639
have to also change

404
00:13:47,279 --> 00:13:51,040
the way they were doing things but they

405
00:13:48,639 --> 00:13:52,720
would they have to measure they have to

406
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:54,639
count how

407
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:56,240
to thin properly and so on so they it's

408
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:58,079
a little bit more scientific

409
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,959
and so as a result it's a bit more

410
00:13:58,079 --> 00:14:03,600
demanding in terms of attention and care

411
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:04,639
and and a bit harder for the farmer to

412
00:14:03,600 --> 00:14:06,639
delegate

413
00:14:04,639 --> 00:14:08,800
so uh that's the sense in which it's

414
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:10,320
more demanding on the farmer

415
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:12,800
so that's the idea

416
00:14:10,320 --> 00:14:14,720
so but these things again means that if

417
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,480
it's it's about management it's not

418
00:14:14,720 --> 00:14:18,639
something that will diffuse naturally

419
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:20,480
through observation you can't just copy

420
00:14:18,639 --> 00:14:22,079
people oh he has a new iphone i'm going

421
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:24,399
to have it on your iphone

422
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:26,639
you can't just copy people's behavior

423
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:28,639
just by by observing what they're doing

424
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:29,519
so you have to really be taught how to

425
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,760
do it

426
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,199
so that's the that's the idea uh of this

427
00:14:33,760 --> 00:14:36,800
there's going to be some diffusion

428
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:37,920
happening and naturally of course people

429
00:14:36,800 --> 00:14:39,920
will talk

430
00:14:37,920 --> 00:14:41,680
but it will come

431
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,240
you know the hope is that it all comes

432
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:46,959
from

433
00:14:44,240 --> 00:14:49,440
from the training that uh uh brag does

434
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:51,839
and then the way that this diffuses then

435
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,160
to students and perhaps then eventually

436
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:56,000
to some other people in the village and

437
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:59,040
as we will see later there's very good

438
00:14:56,000 --> 00:15:01,279
command contamination across villages so

439
00:14:59,040 --> 00:15:04,959
which again confirming that people don't

440
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,959
seem to know this technology before

441
00:15:05,290 --> 00:15:08,880
[Music]

442
00:15:07,519 --> 00:15:10,560
now

443
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,880
i'm not going to spend too much on this

444
00:15:10,560 --> 00:15:14,880
slide but but there's there's obviously

445
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:17,279
a very large approach on diffusion of

446
00:15:14,880 --> 00:15:19,440
innovation here i've picked a few uh

447
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:21,040
papers that uh

448
00:15:19,440 --> 00:15:23,040
that are more in the development

449
00:15:21,040 --> 00:15:24,399
economics literature reasonably recent

450
00:15:23,040 --> 00:15:26,639
papers

451
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:28,959
um so that but it is of course a much

452
00:15:26,639 --> 00:15:31,440
larger literature behind it

453
00:15:28,959 --> 00:15:33,920
uh including of course in marketing

454
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:35,759
uh because you know diffusion of new

455
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:37,360
products these are innovations so

456
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:41,480
there's there's going to be some some

457
00:15:37,360 --> 00:15:41,480
lit the larger on that

458
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:47,519
and basically the base the basic the

459
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:49,600
main message of the signature is that

460
00:15:47,519 --> 00:15:52,320
sri is not for everyone

461
00:15:49,600 --> 00:15:55,120
you you need to be

462
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,079
a dedicated farmer to benefit from it if

463
00:15:55,120 --> 00:16:00,240
you're not um

464
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:01,519
up to snuff let's say if you're just

465
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:04,240
like uh

466
00:16:01,519 --> 00:16:05,759
somebody who does it because they can't

467
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:07,680
earn an income from

468
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:09,600
something else you might not naturally

469
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:12,240
benefit from it because it's actually

470
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:13,920
demanding in terms of of understanding

471
00:16:12,240 --> 00:16:16,079
what's going on in the field

472
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:18,000
so that that's the sense in which

473
00:16:16,079 --> 00:16:19,600
it's not a technology that we expect to

474
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,959
benefit everyone and therefore it's a

475
00:16:19,600 --> 00:16:22,320
technology for which targeting is

476
00:16:20,959 --> 00:16:25,040
important you know you have to be able

477
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:27,360
to i think you want to economize uh on

478
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:29,120
the cost of training by focusing your

479
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:32,079
training on people who will benefit from

480
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:32,079
it so that's the idea

481
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:36,320
um of course there is also a larger

482
00:16:34,480 --> 00:16:39,519
picture on p2p transmission which is

483
00:16:36,320 --> 00:16:41,279
what we are trying to uh achieve here

484
00:16:39,519 --> 00:16:43,680
and of course more generally on the role

485
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:45,279
of social products proximity in in viral

486
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:47,839
marketing so i'm not gonna you know

487
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:49,440
these are just a hand just a

488
00:16:47,839 --> 00:16:51,040
very small number of papers been citing

489
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,880
here

490
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:54,639
so let me if

491
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:56,720
if there are no more questions about the

492
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:58,399
no questions about the

493
00:16:56,720 --> 00:16:59,279
setup the context

494
00:16:58,399 --> 00:17:01,040
i can

495
00:16:59,279 --> 00:17:03,360
delve into the immunity delve into the

496
00:17:01,040 --> 00:17:04,880
experimental design as i said it's with

497
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,679
brac

498
00:17:04,880 --> 00:17:09,919
um we've selected a hundred villages uh

499
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:13,760
from these two districts uh rank poor

500
00:17:09,919 --> 00:17:15,360
and bagura in uh bangladesh um

501
00:17:13,760 --> 00:17:18,559
and

502
00:17:15,360 --> 00:17:21,120
the way that brac works um

503
00:17:18,559 --> 00:17:21,919
as far as sri is concerned they go to

504
00:17:21,120 --> 00:17:23,520
these

505
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:24,319
when they arrive in a village they start

506
00:17:23,520 --> 00:17:26,319
by

507
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:28,960
identifying

508
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:30,720
or 30 potential sri adopters and these

509
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,799
are people who obviously have to grow

510
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:34,080
rice otherwise there's no point

511
00:17:32,799 --> 00:17:36,799
and

512
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:39,360
they have to they have to be

513
00:17:36,799 --> 00:17:40,960
large enough

514
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:43,120
in other words

515
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:45,440
more than one decimal

516
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,880
i forgot exactly it's in the paper but

517
00:17:45,440 --> 00:17:49,039
the lower limit but they're trying to

518
00:17:46,880 --> 00:17:50,480
find these intermediate farmers who have

519
00:17:49,039 --> 00:17:52,160
enough

520
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,400
uh uh

521
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:56,720
land that they grow to to to signal that

522
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,640
they're actually farmers not just uh

523
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,799
gardeners if you want

524
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:01,600
and they also not too big okay so they

525
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:03,600
kind of

526
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:06,320
live in this intermediate uh

527
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:08,640
size so they kind of uh generally poor

528
00:18:06,320 --> 00:18:10,480
people but they are a little bit uh more

529
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:13,280
focused on rise than than some of the

530
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:13,280
very small ones

531
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:17,039
um

532
00:18:14,960 --> 00:18:18,480
and if the village is too big and they

533
00:18:17,039 --> 00:18:19,280
have more than 30 and basically what

534
00:18:18,480 --> 00:18:20,960
they

535
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:22,559
would end up doing

536
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:23,840
um

537
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:26,000
not necessarily here but what they would

538
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,919
end up doing is kind of to say this two

539
00:18:26,000 --> 00:18:29,360
groups of 30 and then there was like one

540
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:31,200
in the eastern part of the village one

541
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,240
of the western part of the village

542
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:35,039
because you know it's a densely

543
00:18:32,240 --> 00:18:36,559
populated country so you you get uh

544
00:18:35,039 --> 00:18:38,480
sometimes you get large villages so they

545
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:42,160
would do that so basically they

546
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:44,559
and that's that's how they proceed

547
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:47,039
um in their sri

548
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:49,039
training campaign so we we wanted to to

549
00:18:47,039 --> 00:18:51,760
kind of and we didn't want to change

550
00:18:49,039 --> 00:18:53,840
that because we wanted to be policy

551
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:55,679
relevant we wanted whatever we whatever

552
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:57,840
we introduced whether we

553
00:18:55,679 --> 00:19:00,559
find we wanted this to be

554
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:03,840
immediately you could slaughter into the

555
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:04,960
normal strategy the mobile practices

556
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:07,840
of brac

557
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:08,799
in the country so that was the idea

558
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:10,880
um

559
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:14,000
and also we you know because they're not

560
00:19:10,880 --> 00:19:16,960
stupid they they they also want to save

561
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:19,919
on uh the economize on on on

562
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:22,480
train waste wasting training time

563
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:23,760
on on people who never adopt we hope

564
00:19:22,480 --> 00:19:26,480
that

565
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:29,039
through that system we the 30 farmers

566
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,880
they identify are probably farmers

567
00:19:29,039 --> 00:19:33,039
among whom the property sales option is

568
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:34,880
higher it's not 100 by any means but

569
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:36,240
it's it's it's higher so that's the idea

570
00:19:34,880 --> 00:19:39,120
so basically uh

571
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:40,080
let's focus on those people um

572
00:19:39,120 --> 00:19:42,559
and we're going to be looking at

573
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:44,480
diffusion be among that group

574
00:19:42,559 --> 00:19:45,679
we start with the baseline questionnaire

575
00:19:44,480 --> 00:19:49,200
on the household composition in

576
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:49,200
pharmaceutics it's a fairly light

577
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:54,799
baseline

578
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:57,200
and then we assign 60 villages to

579
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:58,720
treatment and the 40 remaining ones to

580
00:19:57,200 --> 00:20:01,520
control

581
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:04,480
in control there is no

582
00:20:01,520 --> 00:20:07,280
sri brak intervention

583
00:20:04,480 --> 00:20:10,400
and then in the treated villages um a

584
00:20:07,280 --> 00:20:11,600
selected number of teacher trainees uh

585
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:15,840
farmers

586
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:17,280
uh receive one day training in sri okay

587
00:20:15,840 --> 00:20:19,280
and uh

588
00:20:17,280 --> 00:20:21,120
of the 60 villages selected for

589
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,760
treatment there's 30 that are also

590
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:26,559
assigned to an incentivized teacher

591
00:20:23,760 --> 00:20:26,559
treatment assist

592
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:31,679
a treatment whereby the teacher trained

593
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:35,200
trainee

594
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:37,440
um is is gaining a compensation for

595
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,600
training students that depend on their

596
00:20:37,440 --> 00:20:41,760
performance in the quiz

597
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:45,360
while in the other 30 villages

598
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:48,000
the teacher trainee receives a fixed uh

599
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:49,840
compensation per per student relates to

600
00:20:48,000 --> 00:20:52,240
logic

601
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:54,480
and if you look at the

602
00:20:52,240 --> 00:20:56,640
more precisely what is the how does this

603
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,880
compensation uh constructed

604
00:20:56,640 --> 00:21:00,960
well they get a fixed

605
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,640
fee if you want a participation fee of

606
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:05,919
uh for 300 taka or four dollars

607
00:21:04,640 --> 00:21:08,240
and then in the incident device

608
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:09,760
treatment they get 250 taka additional

609
00:21:08,240 --> 00:21:10,960
per student at the end of the teaching

610
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:13,280
week

611
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:15,919
and then another uh they get they are

612
00:21:13,280 --> 00:21:19,120
given a week to train them because

613
00:21:15,919 --> 00:21:21,360
i'm expecting them to be training them

614
00:21:19,120 --> 00:21:22,880
uh every day all the time but

615
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:24,559
you know you have to give them some time

616
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:26,640
for them to meet them

617
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:28,559
so that's the logic of it

618
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:32,480
and you don't wait too long so there's

619
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,840
no point um and then the incident

620
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:35,679
question

621
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:37,760
yeah yeah how are the people how are the

622
00:21:35,679 --> 00:21:40,320
teacher training selected

623
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,480
i i'm getting to that it's the next okay

624
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:44,080
get into that right right away

625
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:46,000
anyway so that's the easy part

626
00:21:44,080 --> 00:21:48,080
explaining the this kind of uh

627
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:50,320
incentives is basically you get a fixed

628
00:21:48,080 --> 00:21:52,880
amount and then you you lose something

629
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:55,679
every time the

630
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:59,840
the the your student uh

631
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:59,840
answers the quiz wrongly

632
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:06,000
um so now let's let's talk about the

633
00:22:02,400 --> 00:22:07,520
assignment rule um

634
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,600
so as i explained earlier in the

635
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,799
baseline in the treated villages each

636
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:15,039
farmer nominates up to five as role

637
00:22:12,799 --> 00:22:17,440
models with the opinion leaders over our

638
00:22:15,039 --> 00:22:17,440
models

639
00:22:18,080 --> 00:22:21,039
and then

640
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:23,120
we have these 30 farmers and then we we

641
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,120
have to assign them into to four

642
00:22:23,120 --> 00:22:26,559
different roles basically

643
00:22:25,120 --> 00:22:28,880
some are going to be teachers they're

644
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:30,480
going to receive the training

645
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:31,600
some are going to be

646
00:22:30,480 --> 00:22:33,120
receiving nothing at all they're going

647
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:34,640
to be the non-students they're going to

648
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:37,120
be

649
00:22:34,640 --> 00:22:38,320
going to be able to look at

650
00:22:37,120 --> 00:22:39,600
if you want

651
00:22:38,320 --> 00:22:44,400
and

652
00:22:39,600 --> 00:22:45,520
an incentivized unorganized diffusion

653
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,799
and then we're going to have the

654
00:22:45,520 --> 00:22:49,120
students and there are two types of

655
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:50,799
students the students who nominated so

656
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:52,480
remember there are two students for a

657
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,960
teacher trainee one

658
00:22:52,480 --> 00:22:57,280
who nominated a teacher trainee as a

659
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:59,440
opinion leader a role model and one who

660
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,080
did not nominate that particular teacher

661
00:22:59,440 --> 00:23:03,440
training so that's how it's uh so they

662
00:23:02,080 --> 00:23:05,840
have to be assigned to these four groups

663
00:23:03,440 --> 00:23:06,960
how do we do this

664
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,880
so

665
00:23:06,960 --> 00:23:12,080
we start by picking

666
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:14,320
uh six teacher trainees so those are

667
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:15,679
going to receive the black training

668
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,120
and um

669
00:23:15,679 --> 00:23:22,080
this we did um

670
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:25,360
by dividing so remember once we get the

671
00:23:22,080 --> 00:23:27,520
five nominations per nominating farmer

672
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:30,000
per per each of the 30 farmers we can

673
00:23:27,520 --> 00:23:31,039
look at who they nominate

674
00:23:30,000 --> 00:23:32,799
right so

675
00:23:31,039 --> 00:23:34,840
maybe all of them nominate albert so

676
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:38,080
then you know albert will be nominated

677
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:40,080
by you know it will have 29 nominations

678
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:42,000
and then uh you know maybe dilip is

679
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:43,679
going to have 28 or something so you you

680
00:23:42,000 --> 00:23:44,720
get a sense of and then some people will

681
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:48,640
have none

682
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:50,960
so basically we basically divide the

683
00:23:48,640 --> 00:23:53,840
the the 30 farmers into those that

684
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:55,760
received uh above the median number of

685
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:57,440
nominations and those that receive less

686
00:23:55,760 --> 00:23:59,600
than the median number of nominations

687
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,279
that's the and then among the

688
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:03,360
those that are above the median we

689
00:24:01,279 --> 00:24:05,120
select four teacher trainees

690
00:24:03,360 --> 00:24:07,279
and the others we select two digit

691
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:09,200
training so this is basically stratified

692
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:10,640
sampling

693
00:24:09,200 --> 00:24:12,799
right we had a variable where we

694
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,480
collected ourselves

695
00:24:12,799 --> 00:24:17,279
it's known to us

696
00:24:14,480 --> 00:24:19,279
we do sampling

697
00:24:17,279 --> 00:24:20,640
is stratified

698
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:21,440
okay so they don't they don't have the

699
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,799
same

700
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:24,640
based on their observable

701
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,200
characteristics as baseline they get

702
00:24:24,640 --> 00:24:29,120
slightly different probabilities

703
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,159
of being assigned to a particular

704
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:31,520
treatment

705
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,279
okay

706
00:24:31,520 --> 00:24:34,720
so we'll have to correct for that when

707
00:24:33,279 --> 00:24:36,720
we

708
00:24:34,720 --> 00:24:39,200
in a minute because that that that that

709
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:41,840
stratified sampling which is

710
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:43,760
not pure randomization

711
00:24:41,840 --> 00:24:45,200
now what about the other 24 farmers so

712
00:24:43,760 --> 00:24:46,880
then we have assigned these six people

713
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:48,400
at random

714
00:24:46,880 --> 00:24:51,360
the way they are explained so you're

715
00:24:48,400 --> 00:24:52,400
left with 24 farmers we know we want 12

716
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:54,799
students

717
00:24:52,400 --> 00:24:58,799
and 12 non-students

718
00:24:54,799 --> 00:25:00,720
and then we want six students who are

719
00:24:58,799 --> 00:25:03,279
matched with a teacher that they

720
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:04,880
nominated and six students who are

721
00:25:03,279 --> 00:25:07,279
matched with somebody that did not

722
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:09,440
dominate so how do we do this well we do

723
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:13,039
this using an algorithm this algorithm

724
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:15,600
is a mechanistic so it just basically

725
00:25:13,039 --> 00:25:17,919
you can think of the of the algorithm as

726
00:25:15,600 --> 00:25:17,919
um

727
00:25:18,640 --> 00:25:23,440
you start by randomizing all the farm

728
00:25:20,559 --> 00:25:24,240
the 30 farmers in the village

729
00:25:23,440 --> 00:25:27,760
then

730
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:29,440
you you know based on that

731
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:31,279
reshuffling of the farmers you picked

732
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:32,960
the four the first four

733
00:25:31,279 --> 00:25:34,640
who are above the median in terms of

734
00:25:32,960 --> 00:25:36,240
nomination and the first two who are

735
00:25:34,640 --> 00:25:37,919
above the median

736
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:39,039
uh below the median in terms of

737
00:25:37,919 --> 00:25:40,640
nomination these are going to be the

738
00:25:39,039 --> 00:25:43,120
teacher trainings so now that you have

739
00:25:40,640 --> 00:25:45,919
the teacher trainings you start looking

740
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:47,600
among the the the 24 farmers for farmers

741
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,360
who nominated them farmers who did not

742
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:52,720
dominate them and so

743
00:25:49,360 --> 00:25:55,279
and you go through the list

744
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,320
you go through the list of farmers

745
00:25:55,279 --> 00:25:59,600
in the order they've been shuffled

746
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,279
until you finally

747
00:25:59,600 --> 00:26:03,279
allocate everybody

748
00:26:01,279 --> 00:26:05,600
so the the order in which they've been

749
00:26:03,279 --> 00:26:07,200
shuffled will determine

750
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:09,919
the order in which they are considered

751
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:11,840
by the algorithm to be assigned to a

752
00:26:09,919 --> 00:26:13,919
teacher or not

753
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:15,120
does it make sense

754
00:26:13,919 --> 00:26:16,640
so that means

755
00:26:15,120 --> 00:26:19,440
marcel it seems still seems like it's

756
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:21,600
not going to be very random if

757
00:26:19,440 --> 00:26:23,520
for each of the

758
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:25,279
teachers you have to find one student

759
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,360
who nominated them because maybe for

760
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:31,440
some of the teachers there was only one

761
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:31,440
or two students who nominated him right

762
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:34,799
if i'm understanding the algorithm

763
00:26:33,039 --> 00:26:36,400
correctly yeah yeah but that's enough

764
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:39,440
that's okay

765
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:42,000
that's okay yeah i don't think there is

766
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:44,480
a village where we we had the problem of

767
00:26:42,000 --> 00:26:48,400
uh of selecting

768
00:26:44,480 --> 00:26:50,080
uh a teacher who was nominated by nobody

769
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:51,279
i don't think it happened because this

770
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:55,520
is an issue that we raised at the

771
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,520
beginning but this didn't occur

772
00:26:56,159 --> 00:27:00,640
okay so you always find

773
00:26:58,080 --> 00:27:03,200
they be nominated by at least one person

774
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,960
uh one other question i mean when they

775
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,400
are asked to nominate somebody as a role

776
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:08,559
model

777
00:27:06,400 --> 00:27:09,919
are they you know one criterion could be

778
00:27:08,559 --> 00:27:11,679
who who do you think is going to be the

779
00:27:09,919 --> 00:27:13,200
most successful in adopting the

780
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:14,880
technology

781
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:16,799
himself

782
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:19,120
the other is who is going to be the best

783
00:27:16,799 --> 00:27:19,120
teacher

784
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:24,640
and those two need not be the same

785
00:27:21,840 --> 00:27:26,960
sure so what what is your understanding

786
00:27:24,640 --> 00:27:30,320
of what you know what they think

787
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,320
of when they say role model

788
00:27:32,840 --> 00:27:36,960
um well i mean

789
00:27:37,840 --> 00:27:41,679
you will see it actually this has no

790
00:27:39,360 --> 00:27:41,679
effect

791
00:27:42,080 --> 00:27:48,159
okay so we we can talk about what they

792
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:51,679
meant maybe they didn't mean anything

793
00:27:48,159 --> 00:27:51,679
it's possible um

794
00:27:51,919 --> 00:27:54,720
but

795
00:27:53,120 --> 00:27:57,679
the wording was

796
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:00,159
basically whom would you be look i mean

797
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,120
the word the wording is not in

798
00:28:00,159 --> 00:28:04,480
it is phrased in terms of agricultural

799
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,120
technology

800
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:08,640
so who who would you be going to for

801
00:28:07,120 --> 00:28:12,159
information about the new agricultural

802
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:12,159
technology that's the basic idea

803
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:16,799
now it may be that they they just go to

804
00:28:15,600 --> 00:28:18,480
their neighbor

805
00:28:16,799 --> 00:28:19,840
so it may be that this person is not

806
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:22,880
particularly

807
00:28:19,840 --> 00:28:22,880
knowledgeable about it

808
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,919
but that's that's that was the intention

809
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:31,679
the intention was to identify someone

810
00:28:27,919 --> 00:28:34,399
who was perceived as a as a more

811
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:36,080
at least by by the student farmers by

812
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:38,880
perceived as someone who would be more

813
00:28:36,080 --> 00:28:40,880
authoritative that was the the intention

814
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:42,480
and so the idea was that if he's more

815
00:28:40,880 --> 00:28:44,480
arthritic of you

816
00:28:42,480 --> 00:28:46,880
you probably would will listen more to

817
00:28:44,480 --> 00:28:47,760
what he says we might do better on the

818
00:28:46,880 --> 00:28:50,159
quiz

819
00:28:47,760 --> 00:28:53,520
and you might also um

820
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:56,799
follow this person's example more

821
00:28:53,520 --> 00:28:59,440
therefore and therefore um

822
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:01,120
if they adopt you might adopt it uh

823
00:28:59,440 --> 00:29:03,200
adopt as well in fact we're going to be

824
00:29:01,120 --> 00:29:05,520
testing for those things in the in the

825
00:29:03,200 --> 00:29:05,520
paper

826
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,360
but before i go to that

827
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,120
to the the more substantive issues of

828
00:29:09,360 --> 00:29:12,880
the paper which i actually where the

829
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,000
interesting stuff is

830
00:29:12,880 --> 00:29:16,080
i need to be

831
00:29:14,000 --> 00:29:18,640
i need to basically address this issue

832
00:29:16,080 --> 00:29:18,640
of um

833
00:29:19,600 --> 00:29:24,240
weights i mean clearly this algorithm

834
00:29:24,880 --> 00:29:29,200
um generates different probabilities of

835
00:29:27,679 --> 00:29:32,720
being assigned to one of the four

836
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:34,880
treatments for each of the 30 farmers

837
00:29:32,720 --> 00:29:36,240
and um

838
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,159
and so you might think well wait a

839
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:41,120
minute i mean i know how to deal with

840
00:29:38,159 --> 00:29:42,960
this problem if it if it's stratified

841
00:29:41,120 --> 00:29:44,399
sampling because it's stratified

842
00:29:42,960 --> 00:29:46,559
sampling i just look at the

843
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:49,520
stratification ratio that i use and i

844
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,200
correct for that using weights

845
00:29:49,520 --> 00:29:52,159
but here you say well wait a minute i

846
00:29:51,200 --> 00:29:54,480
don't i don't know it's just the

847
00:29:52,159 --> 00:29:56,480
algorithm it's a black box what but the

848
00:29:54,480 --> 00:29:58,240
thing is that the algorithm you can

849
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,679
reproduce it that means me as many times

850
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,240
as you want you can reshuffle the

851
00:29:59,679 --> 00:30:04,480
farmers rate again use your philosophy

852
00:30:02,240 --> 00:30:07,200
again right again right again wait 500

853
00:30:04,480 --> 00:30:09,039
times look at how you know of these 500

854
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:10,799
times how many times does albert gets

855
00:30:09,039 --> 00:30:12,480
assigned to be a teacher and how much

856
00:30:10,799 --> 00:30:13,360
does marcel get assigned to be a teacher

857
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:14,799
and that

858
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,279
that becomes your probability of

859
00:30:14,799 --> 00:30:17,279
assignment

860
00:30:17,760 --> 00:30:21,200
right the problem is going to be if

861
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:22,720
there is somebody who's always assigned

862
00:30:21,200 --> 00:30:24,240
to be a teacher somebody who's never

863
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,679
assigned to be a teacher then you you

864
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:27,440
think well wait a minute those people i

865
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,840
can't compare because they uh you know

866
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:32,000
they basically i don't have people who

867
00:30:29,840 --> 00:30:32,000
are

868
00:30:32,799 --> 00:30:36,159
um

869
00:30:34,159 --> 00:30:37,600
so i i would look at that i'll have to

870
00:30:36,159 --> 00:30:39,600
check that this is not the case because

871
00:30:37,600 --> 00:30:41,440
those people then would have to be taken

872
00:30:39,600 --> 00:30:43,120
out because they they never they have

873
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:46,240
zero chance of uh the account

874
00:30:43,120 --> 00:30:48,240
constructor you can't construct a

875
00:30:46,240 --> 00:30:51,840
uh a

876
00:30:48,240 --> 00:30:51,840
sampling weight for that

877
00:30:52,240 --> 00:30:56,399
right it's infinite basically

878
00:30:54,320 --> 00:30:58,159
or zero

879
00:30:56,399 --> 00:30:59,519
so that's uh well i'll get back to 90

880
00:30:58,159 --> 00:31:00,880
minutes but that's the that's the id but

881
00:30:59,519 --> 00:31:02,960
the main the main

882
00:31:00,880 --> 00:31:04,480
the main thing here is that

883
00:31:02,960 --> 00:31:06,720
it's going to rule the rule-based

884
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,640
deterministic aspect given a certain

885
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:09,519
ordering of farmers

886
00:31:08,640 --> 00:31:11,519
in

887
00:31:09,519 --> 00:31:14,320
reshuffling of farmers and it follows a

888
00:31:11,519 --> 00:31:15,760
rule so it's and this rule is entirely

889
00:31:14,320 --> 00:31:18,080
based on

890
00:31:15,760 --> 00:31:19,600
things that we observe at baseline just

891
00:31:18,080 --> 00:31:21,279
like if you were doing

892
00:31:19,600 --> 00:31:23,600
stratified sampling you have some kind

893
00:31:21,279 --> 00:31:24,960
of baseline information on the people

894
00:31:23,600 --> 00:31:27,039
and then you're going to organize your

895
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:29,600
sampling based on that

896
00:31:27,039 --> 00:31:31,279
so it's not it's not about selection on

897
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:32,720
observables

898
00:31:31,279 --> 00:31:34,960
they're going to be things that are

899
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:36,559
correlated with these observables for

900
00:31:34,960 --> 00:31:38,080
sure but uh

901
00:31:36,559 --> 00:31:40,799
but uh we

902
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:43,760
that's why we need to correct for uh for

903
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:43,760
sampling weights but

904
00:31:43,919 --> 00:31:47,480
so that's the idea

905
00:31:48,000 --> 00:31:53,519
um so as i said we've got

906
00:31:50,720 --> 00:31:55,679
four types of treated farmers

907
00:31:53,519 --> 00:31:57,840
um two types of treated villages

908
00:31:55,679 --> 00:32:00,240
incentivized teacher and non-study vice

909
00:31:57,840 --> 00:32:01,440
teacher we only have one type of control

910
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:02,799
farmers

911
00:32:01,440 --> 00:32:04,720
and basically what we'll do is we

912
00:32:02,799 --> 00:32:06,399
compare say teacher trainees to control

913
00:32:04,720 --> 00:32:08,399
farmers or teacher trainees to

914
00:32:06,399 --> 00:32:09,279
non-students or

915
00:32:08,399 --> 00:32:11,039
um

916
00:32:09,279 --> 00:32:14,159
and so so that's the that's what we're

917
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:15,840
going to be doing

918
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:19,200
so let's talk a little bit more about

919
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:20,320
this assignment treatment type

920
00:32:19,200 --> 00:32:21,679
fine

921
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:23,600
so remember

922
00:32:21,679 --> 00:32:25,279
this assignment treatment is under our

923
00:32:23,600 --> 00:32:28,640
full control there's no there's no

924
00:32:25,279 --> 00:32:31,120
self-selection whatsoever we assign them

925
00:32:28,640 --> 00:32:32,880
is based on observables which we have at

926
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:35,360
baseline

927
00:32:32,880 --> 00:32:37,679
and uh it's it's it's based on an

928
00:32:35,360 --> 00:32:39,120
algorithm which we can replica use to

929
00:32:37,679 --> 00:32:41,919
replicate

930
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:44,960
many times the the the

931
00:32:41,919 --> 00:32:47,039
the assignment process so that's the key

932
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:48,399
so basically we can we based on that we

933
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,760
can as i have explained we can

934
00:32:48,399 --> 00:32:51,600
reconstruct

935
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:53,279
what the what the probability of being

936
00:32:51,600 --> 00:32:54,799
assigned to the to each of the four

937
00:32:53,279 --> 00:32:57,440
treatments

938
00:32:54,799 --> 00:32:59,760
uh would be for any particular in fact

939
00:32:57,440 --> 00:33:02,240
for any individual in the sample we can

940
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:04,240
do this individual by individual

941
00:33:02,240 --> 00:33:06,240
okay

942
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,799
and so that way we can recover the

943
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:10,399
probabilities so let me show you just

944
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:12,480
how it works in practice

945
00:33:10,399 --> 00:33:13,919
so let's say you have two populations

946
00:33:12,480 --> 00:33:15,679
untreated

947
00:33:13,919 --> 00:33:17,679
and the control

948
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:19,039
the the normal way of measuring the

949
00:33:17,679 --> 00:33:20,720
average treatment effect would be just

950
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:22,240
to look at the mean of the treatment and

951
00:33:20,720 --> 00:33:24,480
the mean of the control if they have

952
00:33:22,240 --> 00:33:26,320
been randomly assigned to it

953
00:33:24,480 --> 00:33:28,080
and if there's it's there's no

954
00:33:26,320 --> 00:33:31,360
ratification whatsoever you just take

955
00:33:28,080 --> 00:33:33,840
the sample mean okay

956
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:36,080
now in our case we can't do the sample

957
00:33:33,840 --> 00:33:37,919
mean we're gonna for the for the for the

958
00:33:36,080 --> 00:33:40,240
for the so this is this is people

959
00:33:37,919 --> 00:33:42,159
assigned to a specific treatment

960
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:44,159
so we're going to to basically use

961
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:46,159
inverse probability weighting so that's

962
00:33:44,159 --> 00:33:47,679
that's something you already know so

963
00:33:46,159 --> 00:33:50,559
you know we we

964
00:33:47,679 --> 00:33:53,200
this is the pro this is the

965
00:33:50,559 --> 00:33:56,080
the probability that somebody would be

966
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:58,880
assigned to this particular treatment

967
00:33:56,080 --> 00:34:00,720
we normalize this by case or which is

968
00:33:58,880 --> 00:34:03,200
the sum of these uh

969
00:34:00,720 --> 00:34:05,200
pi so that

970
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:06,799
you want to normalize because you want

971
00:34:05,200 --> 00:34:09,359
this thing that is saying the

972
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:10,560
probabilities is one for everybody in a

973
00:34:09,359 --> 00:34:12,399
particular

974
00:34:10,560 --> 00:34:13,679
unit you want this thing to be one over

975
00:34:12,399 --> 00:34:15,839
one

976
00:34:13,679 --> 00:34:18,879
right so that cancels out and you you

977
00:34:15,839 --> 00:34:21,839
back to the standard uh mean

978
00:34:18,879 --> 00:34:21,839
everybody

979
00:34:25,040 --> 00:34:28,879
i had a question i mean this all makes

980
00:34:26,960 --> 00:34:31,359
sense to me but if you're going to

981
00:34:28,879 --> 00:34:33,440
re-weight to try to make it in some

982
00:34:31,359 --> 00:34:35,760
sense representative then why didn't you

983
00:34:33,440 --> 00:34:36,960
just randomize at the beginning

984
00:34:35,760 --> 00:34:40,240
and then you don't have to deal with the

985
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:42,240
weights i'm just curious about you know

986
00:34:40,240 --> 00:34:44,480
the decision to stratify in this way and

987
00:34:42,240 --> 00:34:46,720
then to re-weight it back to the random

988
00:34:44,480 --> 00:34:48,879
representativeness no but

989
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:50,079
no but the uh no

990
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:52,480
that is uh

991
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:55,359
why do you stratify a sample in

992
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:56,480
any any you know when you ever solidify

993
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:57,760
a sample

994
00:34:56,480 --> 00:34:59,760
it's because you want to be able to

995
00:34:57,760 --> 00:35:01,280
compare to populations in this case we

996
00:34:59,760 --> 00:35:03,760
wanted to compare nominating and

997
00:35:01,280 --> 00:35:05,599
non-nominating we wanted to compare

998
00:35:03,760 --> 00:35:07,040
uh teacher and the other so we wanted to

999
00:35:05,599 --> 00:35:08,560
be um

1000
00:35:07,040 --> 00:35:10,320
and the big the big challenge was

1001
00:35:08,560 --> 00:35:12,320
nominating and non-nominating because we

1002
00:35:10,320 --> 00:35:15,119
didn't control who's nominating who so

1003
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:16,400
basically that's the that's the way we

1004
00:35:15,119 --> 00:35:18,960
uh

1005
00:35:16,400 --> 00:35:21,119
we ended up approaching it right but the

1006
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:23,040
cost is you get a higher variance and i

1007
00:35:21,119 --> 00:35:25,440
mean the greater variance in the weights

1008
00:35:23,040 --> 00:35:27,680
reduces power in some sense right so

1009
00:35:25,440 --> 00:35:29,760
yeah but i can see the trade-off right

1010
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,280
no i just i agree with that yeah i agree

1011
00:35:29,760 --> 00:35:33,680
with that but we we've been having

1012
00:35:31,280 --> 00:35:36,480
enough power so

1013
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:38,240
so my interpretation is that you

1014
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:39,839
wanted to try to understand the

1015
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:41,280
mechanisms as well

1016
00:35:39,839 --> 00:35:42,400
and

1017
00:35:41,280 --> 00:35:43,599
if you're trying to think about

1018
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:45,440
mechanisms

1019
00:35:43,599 --> 00:35:48,079
i mean what i would be inclined to do is

1020
00:35:45,440 --> 00:35:50,720
to well there's obviously heterogeneity

1021
00:35:48,079 --> 00:35:51,680
let's say that people vary in

1022
00:35:50,720 --> 00:35:53,359
skill

1023
00:35:51,680 --> 00:35:54,720
which and there's just essentially one

1024
00:35:53,359 --> 00:35:55,599
kind of skill

1025
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:57,520
you know

1026
00:35:55,599 --> 00:35:58,720
you're better role model

1027
00:35:57,520 --> 00:36:00,960
or not

1028
00:35:58,720 --> 00:36:04,160
and there's information about your skill

1029
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:05,920
that's in the in the population

1030
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:07,599
so you ask people

1031
00:36:05,920 --> 00:36:09,359
and uh

1032
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,119
you know to nominate people so you try

1033
00:36:09,359 --> 00:36:12,640
to elicit community information about

1034
00:36:11,119 --> 00:36:13,839
skill

1035
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,119
but you've got that fundamental

1036
00:36:13,839 --> 00:36:17,599
heterogeneity and there could be a

1037
00:36:15,119 --> 00:36:19,280
second order of heterogeneity which is

1038
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,960
that the effectiveness of

1039
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:22,400
you as a teacher also depends on the

1040
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:24,640
skill of the student

1041
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,960
so it could be math specific

1042
00:36:24,640 --> 00:36:29,040
so what you want to do is estimate

1043
00:36:26,960 --> 00:36:31,200
you know for any pair of skills for the

1044
00:36:29,040 --> 00:36:33,040
teacher and the student you know how

1045
00:36:31,200 --> 00:36:35,119
effective is the transmission of

1046
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:37,119
diffusion going to be so that's what

1047
00:36:35,119 --> 00:36:40,079
you're going to try and back out

1048
00:36:37,119 --> 00:36:42,320
uh then uh you know i presume that this

1049
00:36:40,079 --> 00:36:44,320
this design will get at that

1050
00:36:42,320 --> 00:36:45,520
uh because you've randomized and then

1051
00:36:44,320 --> 00:36:47,760
you've got a third dimension of

1052
00:36:45,520 --> 00:36:49,359
randomization which is

1053
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:52,720
the uh

1054
00:36:49,359 --> 00:36:55,720
the incentives for the the teacher

1055
00:36:52,720 --> 00:36:55,720
yeah

1056
00:36:57,599 --> 00:37:02,480
that would have rationalized the design

1057
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:04,640
and and all the effects that you want to

1058
00:37:02,480 --> 00:37:06,880
isolate i imagine that that's at the

1059
00:37:04,640 --> 00:37:08,560
back of your mind

1060
00:37:06,880 --> 00:37:10,480
yeah it's at the back of the mind i i

1061
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:13,440
didn't for this paper we didn't we

1062
00:37:10,480 --> 00:37:15,920
didn't write a model

1063
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:19,040
i i confess we didn't write a model no

1064
00:37:15,920 --> 00:37:19,040
we just focused on the

1065
00:37:21,040 --> 00:37:25,599
i yeah we just didn't do it for this

1066
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:27,920
paper

1067
00:37:25,599 --> 00:37:27,920
um

1068
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:31,920
and maybe i should have added i mean

1069
00:37:30,320 --> 00:37:33,440
there's some discussion of that in the

1070
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:35,119
in the paper maybe i should have added

1071
00:37:33,440 --> 00:37:37,040
some slides about that but i thought i

1072
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:39,200
was just going to talk talk you into it

1073
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:41,760
as i was going i was presenting the

1074
00:37:39,200 --> 00:37:42,720
different pieces of evidence i have

1075
00:37:41,760 --> 00:37:45,280
um

1076
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:46,720
but you're right so so you raised

1077
00:37:45,280 --> 00:37:48,720
several points here so there's one i

1078
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:51,200
remember which is the

1079
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,960
what about much specific

1080
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:54,400
gain

1081
00:37:52,960 --> 00:37:56,400
so remember

1082
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:58,400
maybe you maybe you saw the paper i

1083
00:37:56,400 --> 00:38:00,960
wrote with demo about that these are

1084
00:37:58,400 --> 00:38:03,920
kids who are assigned to to do a course

1085
00:38:00,960 --> 00:38:05,760
a math course with one other kid in a

1086
00:38:03,920 --> 00:38:08,880
chinese school

1087
00:38:05,760 --> 00:38:11,839
and so there we actually looked as at to

1088
00:38:08,880 --> 00:38:13,839
at the math specific game

1089
00:38:11,839 --> 00:38:16,240
but then they it was easier much easier

1090
00:38:13,839 --> 00:38:19,760
because everybody was in pairs they were

1091
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:21,359
just assigned randomly by design

1092
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:23,359
to another person

1093
00:38:21,359 --> 00:38:25,119
there was no there was no need for a

1094
00:38:23,359 --> 00:38:26,400
matching algorithm like this like we did

1095
00:38:25,119 --> 00:38:28,320
here which is basically randomized

1096
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:30,240
matching and so there we could see

1097
00:38:28,320 --> 00:38:32,000
whether you know if a

1098
00:38:30,240 --> 00:38:34,000
less abled kid kids match with their

1099
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:36,240
more able kid whether

1100
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:38,160
whether the the less able kid

1101
00:38:36,240 --> 00:38:40,640
learns more it turns out they do

1102
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:42,400
actually and the the more able kid

1103
00:38:40,640 --> 00:38:44,720
doesn't seem to

1104
00:38:42,400 --> 00:38:47,119
learn less so so that was actually a

1105
00:38:44,720 --> 00:38:49,440
good a good result for that

1106
00:38:47,119 --> 00:38:50,400
um

1107
00:38:49,440 --> 00:38:53,119
um

1108
00:38:50,400 --> 00:38:55,119
so that's an example of uh uh of lo so i

1109
00:38:53,119 --> 00:38:57,760
know but here we go we're just gonna be

1110
00:38:55,119 --> 00:39:00,160
looking at the average so i'm not i

1111
00:38:57,760 --> 00:39:02,320
don't i don't i don't ambition to

1112
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:04,480
identify pay white because i don't have

1113
00:39:02,320 --> 00:39:06,640
a as you you're right i don't have very

1114
00:39:04,480 --> 00:39:08,400
good um

1115
00:39:06,640 --> 00:39:10,640
identification there

1116
00:39:08,400 --> 00:39:12,800
so i i don't want to make any any

1117
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:14,640
statements about that it's not that i

1118
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:16,800
don't think it's important it's just

1119
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,000
just that i i don't think i'm very i'm a

1120
00:39:16,800 --> 00:39:19,440
very strong

1121
00:39:18,000 --> 00:39:20,800
terrain there

1122
00:39:19,440 --> 00:39:23,760
so i'd rather

1123
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:23,760
avoid seeing that

1124
00:39:24,960 --> 00:39:28,400
um

1125
00:39:26,240 --> 00:39:30,000
i suspect you the way you stratified you

1126
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:31,920
have the identification but you may be

1127
00:39:30,000 --> 00:39:34,000
not be having enough power i i don't

1128
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:36,480
know about that

1129
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:39,839
but we'll see about power i i think

1130
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:42,079
we have power and we actually um

1131
00:39:39,839 --> 00:39:44,000
cluster standard errors at the village

1132
00:39:42,079 --> 00:39:45,680
level so we we have a hundred villages

1133
00:39:44,000 --> 00:39:47,680
so it's fine so i mean it's not like

1134
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:50,000
we've been very uh

1135
00:39:47,680 --> 00:39:51,599
conservative i mean you know

1136
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:53,760
that's not not for the average treatment

1137
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:57,079
effect but for the the heterogeneous

1138
00:39:53,760 --> 00:39:57,079
treatment effects

1139
00:39:58,560 --> 00:40:02,079
we don't have heterogeneous treatment

1140
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,839
effects i know i know if you did if you

1141
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:05,119
did what i was suggesting write down a

1142
00:40:03,839 --> 00:40:06,400
model and try to identify the

1143
00:40:05,119 --> 00:40:08,400
heterogeneous treatment effects to

1144
00:40:06,400 --> 00:40:09,839
understand the mechanism you may be

1145
00:40:08,400 --> 00:40:11,920
underpowered to estimate the

1146
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,839
heterogeneous treatment effects oh yeah

1147
00:40:11,920 --> 00:40:15,599
yeah yeah so i understand okay but

1148
00:40:13,839 --> 00:40:17,040
you're mainly talking about power for

1149
00:40:15,599 --> 00:40:19,599
the average treatment effect which is

1150
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:19,599
fine yes

1151
00:40:22,079 --> 00:40:25,760
yeah that's good that's true that's very

1152
00:40:24,319 --> 00:40:27,520
true

1153
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:30,720
um

1154
00:40:27,520 --> 00:40:33,599
okay so i've explained this

1155
00:40:30,720 --> 00:40:35,200
you can also using you the same once you

1156
00:40:33,599 --> 00:40:36,960
since you

1157
00:40:35,200 --> 00:40:38,640
recalibrate

1158
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,560
these means

1159
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:42,240
to be representative of the control

1160
00:40:40,560 --> 00:40:44,240
village population

1161
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,839
you can also compare them to each other

1162
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:47,440
so once you have recalibrated them you

1163
00:40:45,839 --> 00:40:49,040
should compare them so you can compare

1164
00:40:47,440 --> 00:40:52,000
one group of treated with them to

1165
00:40:49,040 --> 00:40:52,000
another group of treated

1166
00:40:55,280 --> 00:40:59,760
um i've already explained this i mean

1167
00:40:57,680 --> 00:41:02,160
the easiest way to explain how you

1168
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:04,160
recover the priorities the easiest way

1169
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,560
to uh to understand it is that

1170
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:09,200
if you think that each person is a

1171
00:41:06,560 --> 00:41:11,920
different x vector so then you you would

1172
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:14,960
uh you know run a bunch of simulations i

1173
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:17,280
think we've run 500 simulations

1174
00:41:14,960 --> 00:41:19,200
so you would run um let's say first

1175
00:41:17,280 --> 00:41:21,200
simulation

1176
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,480
dilip gets assigned to be

1177
00:41:21,200 --> 00:41:25,440
a teacher

1178
00:41:22,480 --> 00:41:29,119
and so therefore it's one

1179
00:41:25,440 --> 00:41:31,200
zero zero zero so that's one sample

1180
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:33,520
and then in another sum in another

1181
00:41:31,200 --> 00:41:35,920
simulation it gets assigned to be a

1182
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:37,200
nominating student so he's here and then

1183
00:41:35,920 --> 00:41:38,000
he's there

1184
00:41:37,200 --> 00:41:40,240
okay

1185
00:41:38,000 --> 00:41:42,960
really do this for other times some of

1186
00:41:40,240 --> 00:41:45,440
them get frequencies frequency how often

1187
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:47,440
does dilip get to be a teacher you know

1188
00:41:45,440 --> 00:41:49,520
maybe a lot of times so therefore he's

1189
00:41:47,440 --> 00:41:51,520
going to be

1190
00:41:49,520 --> 00:41:54,240
you know he's over represented if you

1191
00:41:51,520 --> 00:41:55,839
want in the in the teacher population so

1192
00:41:54,240 --> 00:41:57,920
we're going to want to

1193
00:41:55,839 --> 00:41:59,680
weigh his

1194
00:41:57,920 --> 00:42:01,040
to re-weight the teacher population so

1195
00:41:59,680 --> 00:42:02,720
that he gets less weight that's the

1196
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:06,160
that's the idea

1197
00:42:02,720 --> 00:42:06,160
so that's how this is done here

1198
00:42:06,960 --> 00:42:09,839
all right

1199
00:42:08,160 --> 00:42:11,200
now the thing you have to worry if you

1200
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:12,720
do that the thing

1201
00:42:11,200 --> 00:42:15,280
you have to worry is that people who

1202
00:42:12,720 --> 00:42:16,720
never get assigned to a particular

1203
00:42:15,280 --> 00:42:20,000
role because then

1204
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:22,000
then as i said they they basically um

1205
00:42:20,000 --> 00:42:23,680
don't have a kind of

1206
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:26,160
comparable person

1207
00:42:23,680 --> 00:42:28,240
so so this is not what we get so these

1208
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,920
are basically the these uh these

1209
00:42:28,240 --> 00:42:31,359
normalized

1210
00:42:29,920 --> 00:42:34,079
probabilities

1211
00:42:31,359 --> 00:42:36,000
that the weights that we are using

1212
00:42:34,079 --> 00:42:38,000
and

1213
00:42:36,000 --> 00:42:39,920
the sum and and so you know they are of

1214
00:42:38,000 --> 00:42:41,359
course centered on one

1215
00:42:39,920 --> 00:42:42,480
which is the mean

1216
00:42:41,359 --> 00:42:44,960
and

1217
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:45,680
it doesn't even reach 0.5 and it doesn't

1218
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:47,599
go

1219
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:50,880
it you know the couple observations

1220
00:42:47,599 --> 00:42:52,880
above couple people above uh above two

1221
00:42:50,880 --> 00:42:55,599
but very few so basically

1222
00:42:52,880 --> 00:42:56,880
the the range of values of these of

1223
00:42:55,599 --> 00:42:59,280
these weights

1224
00:42:56,880 --> 00:43:01,680
is not crazy it stays within a

1225
00:42:59,280 --> 00:43:04,319
relatively narrow range and so that

1226
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:06,640
means that um

1227
00:43:04,319 --> 00:43:09,440
the rewaiting we are doing is not is not

1228
00:43:06,640 --> 00:43:12,400
is not insane okay so it's not like

1229
00:43:09,440 --> 00:43:14,720
one person is 99 of the time

1230
00:43:12,400 --> 00:43:16,400
always a teacher and then you you take

1231
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:17,520
his inverse sampling where he's going to

1232
00:43:16,400 --> 00:43:19,839
be one

1233
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:21,520
over 99 and so it's going you know it's

1234
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:24,480
going to be so

1235
00:43:21,520 --> 00:43:24,480
it's going to be very large

1236
00:43:24,960 --> 00:43:28,240
no it would be it would be a 99 over one

1237
00:43:27,359 --> 00:43:30,000
so

1238
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,960
it would be very small okay anyway so

1239
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:33,599
the

1240
00:43:30,960 --> 00:43:35,280
so that you you want to look to whether

1241
00:43:33,599 --> 00:43:36,640
you have very large value very loose one

1242
00:43:35,280 --> 00:43:40,920
value so you don't have that so that's

1243
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:40,920
actually quite uh quite encouraging

1244
00:43:42,000 --> 00:43:46,160
balance there are lots of tables about

1245
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:49,040
balance in the in the paper they are

1246
00:43:46,160 --> 00:43:51,200
only the appendix um balance across the

1247
00:43:49,040 --> 00:43:52,560
different types of treatment and

1248
00:43:51,200 --> 00:43:54,880
there we

1249
00:43:52,560 --> 00:43:56,720
we don't find any problem with balance

1250
00:43:54,880 --> 00:43:58,880
note that we do balance

1251
00:43:56,720 --> 00:44:00,480
uh controlling for sampling weights and

1252
00:43:58,880 --> 00:44:02,160
we also cluster standard errors by

1253
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:04,079
village so so

1254
00:44:02,160 --> 00:44:06,000
we try to do this the same way we would

1255
00:44:04,079 --> 00:44:08,960
perform the rest of the analysis

1256
00:44:06,000 --> 00:44:10,720
so this is the

1257
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,480
this is the first table i have these are

1258
00:44:10,720 --> 00:44:13,920
just descriptives and

1259
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:16,319
well a bit more than the scripture i

1260
00:44:13,920 --> 00:44:18,400
have some have some tests but the first

1261
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:20,800
part of the table if you want the first

1262
00:44:18,400 --> 00:44:24,000
half the table the top half

1263
00:44:20,800 --> 00:44:24,000
is about um

1264
00:44:24,160 --> 00:44:28,000
perhaps uh you know issues of possible

1265
00:44:26,160 --> 00:44:29,839
interest one is uh

1266
00:44:28,000 --> 00:44:31,920
you know how do people score on the test

1267
00:44:29,839 --> 00:44:33,119
whether the test has got

1268
00:44:31,920 --> 00:44:35,440
um

1269
00:44:33,119 --> 00:44:37,119
actually should be zero to one to eight

1270
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:38,960
the test has eight questions so they

1271
00:44:37,119 --> 00:44:40,079
could either answer them all wrong i

1272
00:44:38,960 --> 00:44:43,119
think you should

1273
00:44:40,079 --> 00:44:44,720
say zero to eight or they could answer i

1274
00:44:43,119 --> 00:44:46,640
think nobody does that but

1275
00:44:44,720 --> 00:44:48,400
they could they could answer all of them

1276
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:50,640
right then the average is about seven so

1277
00:44:48,400 --> 00:44:52,880
they're pretty good at remembering what

1278
00:44:50,640 --> 00:44:55,119
the correct answer is this is on in

1279
00:44:52,880 --> 00:44:57,839
general note that we didn't ask these

1280
00:44:55,119 --> 00:44:59,680
questions in the controlled villages but

1281
00:44:57,839 --> 00:45:00,800
we know from uh

1282
00:44:59,680 --> 00:45:03,440
from other

1283
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:05,839
observational data that they don't know

1284
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:06,640
much about sri

1285
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:08,560
um

1286
00:45:06,640 --> 00:45:11,200
and this is just another variable we use

1287
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:13,200
is whether they can

1288
00:45:11,200 --> 00:45:15,760
uh answer the three main questions

1289
00:45:13,200 --> 00:45:17,920
correctly and you get they get 88 of

1290
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:19,520
farmers who can treat farmers intrigued

1291
00:45:17,920 --> 00:45:22,240
not not 3d farmers

1292
00:45:19,520 --> 00:45:23,680
farmers in treated villages can do that

1293
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:25,599
in terms of nomination remember they

1294
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,920
could make up to they could make up to

1295
00:45:25,599 --> 00:45:30,800
five nominations they actually make

1296
00:45:27,920 --> 00:45:32,640
make nearly all five of five nominations

1297
00:45:30,800 --> 00:45:34,560
so it's very stable we don't have to

1298
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:36,800
worry too much about some of them

1299
00:45:34,560 --> 00:45:38,800
nominating one because he's the only one

1300
00:45:36,800 --> 00:45:40,640
who matters and then some nominating

1301
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:44,240
five like nearly everybody nominates

1302
00:45:40,640 --> 00:45:46,640
five so that that helps us as well

1303
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:50,079
and now we already have i can already

1304
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:53,200
show you some of the average

1305
00:45:50,079 --> 00:45:55,520
uh treatment effects uh or at least the

1306
00:45:53,200 --> 00:45:58,400
the means the the

1307
00:45:55,520 --> 00:45:59,680
the means in each of the samples so

1308
00:45:58,400 --> 00:46:01,599
because i i have the means in the

1309
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:04,160
control villages these are

1310
00:46:01,599 --> 00:46:05,839
these are the the the adoption variables

1311
00:46:04,160 --> 00:46:08,079
that i have

1312
00:46:05,839 --> 00:46:10,640
um

1313
00:46:08,079 --> 00:46:12,960
this is just basically comparing control

1314
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:15,839
villages to treated villages these are

1315
00:46:12,960 --> 00:46:17,040
means village level means okay i'm of

1316
00:46:15,839 --> 00:46:18,240
course i'm going to be looking at more

1317
00:46:17,040 --> 00:46:20,960
than that but

1318
00:46:18,240 --> 00:46:23,359
so the first variable is basically

1319
00:46:20,960 --> 00:46:24,240
whether barack estimated

1320
00:46:23,359 --> 00:46:26,319
that

1321
00:46:24,240 --> 00:46:29,040
the farmer has adopted at least some of

1322
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:31,760
the practices of sri

1323
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:33,200
and in controlled villages by you know

1324
00:46:31,760 --> 00:46:35,839
about two and a half percent of the

1325
00:46:33,200 --> 00:46:37,359
farmers in that village are estimated by

1326
00:46:35,839 --> 00:46:40,319
brackets uh

1327
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:42,560
so basically less than one farmer

1328
00:46:40,319 --> 00:46:45,280
um while in treated villages about a

1329
00:46:42,560 --> 00:46:47,520
third of the farmers okay

1330
00:46:45,280 --> 00:46:48,560
this is across the whole village

1331
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:50,640
um

1332
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:52,000
in terms of the proportion of land and

1333
00:46:50,640 --> 00:46:53,200
of course that that is massively

1334
00:46:52,000 --> 00:46:54,800
significant

1335
00:46:53,200 --> 00:46:56,720
uh we have three thousand i forgot to

1336
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:58,480
tell you the sample size but we but you

1337
00:46:56,720 --> 00:47:00,560
know you have 30 farmers times 100

1338
00:46:58,480 --> 00:47:02,240
villages where you have 3 000 farmers

1339
00:47:00,560 --> 00:47:03,040
all together

1340
00:47:02,240 --> 00:47:05,280
so

1341
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:06,560
this kind of difference across

1342
00:47:05,280 --> 00:47:08,560
60

1343
00:47:06,560 --> 00:47:11,040
villages versus 40 villages you know

1344
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,800
it's certainly significant

1345
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:14,800
um proportion of land is just a

1346
00:47:12,800 --> 00:47:16,000
percentage of the of their cultivated

1347
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:18,400
acreage

1348
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:22,160
uh that is uh that is

1349
00:47:18,400 --> 00:47:24,559
on which sri uh practices have followed

1350
00:47:22,160 --> 00:47:26,400
um so that's uh

1351
00:47:24,559 --> 00:47:28,480
that that's there again you get you see

1352
00:47:26,400 --> 00:47:31,200
that uh in treated villages you get a

1353
00:47:28,480 --> 00:47:33,280
much bigger proportion

1354
00:47:31,200 --> 00:47:35,440
these are the number of sri principles

1355
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:37,280
adopted on the plot

1356
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:40,400
in central villages actually they they

1357
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:42,400
are recorded as you know adopting 1.4

1358
00:47:40,400 --> 00:47:44,240
but that could just be that they by

1359
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,839
chance uh

1360
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,839
adopted one of those uh one of those uh

1361
00:47:47,839 --> 00:47:51,599
practices but

1362
00:47:49,839 --> 00:47:54,400
very few of them adopt more than one so

1363
00:47:51,599 --> 00:47:54,400
there's basically

1364
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:58,559
it's it's a means it looks like a high

1365
00:47:56,319 --> 00:48:00,319
mean but it's not the same practice that

1366
00:47:58,559 --> 00:48:02,480
every farmer adopts right so they

1367
00:48:00,319 --> 00:48:06,640
basically randomly adopt certain things

1368
00:48:02,480 --> 00:48:08,800
without knowing that this is called sri

1369
00:48:06,640 --> 00:48:11,040
um very few of them this is very

1370
00:48:08,800 --> 00:48:13,760
important very few of them actually

1371
00:48:11,040 --> 00:48:15,920
follow the the the transplanting rule

1372
00:48:13,760 --> 00:48:18,400
which is about the age of the seedlings

1373
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:19,200
very in control villages very few of

1374
00:48:18,400 --> 00:48:21,680
them

1375
00:48:19,200 --> 00:48:24,319
um follow the recommended distance

1376
00:48:21,680 --> 00:48:26,000
between bundles the places where they

1377
00:48:24,319 --> 00:48:26,800
transplant the rice

1378
00:48:26,000 --> 00:48:28,960
um

1379
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,480
but it's it's exactly quite a bit higher

1380
00:48:28,960 --> 00:48:32,160
in in

1381
00:48:30,480 --> 00:48:34,160
in treated villages even though this

1382
00:48:32,160 --> 00:48:35,599
still remains very low but they still

1383
00:48:34,160 --> 00:48:38,240
don't like to follow the age of the

1384
00:48:35,599 --> 00:48:39,839
ceiling so it's certainly not complete

1385
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:40,470
adoption

1386
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:41,599
and then

1387
00:48:40,470 --> 00:48:43,839
[Music]

1388
00:48:41,599 --> 00:48:45,200
and then in terms of number of seedlings

1389
00:48:43,839 --> 00:48:48,559
per bundle

1390
00:48:45,200 --> 00:48:50,880
you have a bit higher at practic you

1391
00:48:48,559 --> 00:48:53,599
know this practice is already kind of uh

1392
00:48:50,880 --> 00:48:56,480
somewhat there even in control villages

1393
00:48:53,599 --> 00:48:58,720
but even there is higher in uh

1394
00:48:56,480 --> 00:49:01,119
treated villages so that's that's in

1395
00:48:58,720 --> 00:49:02,559
terms of practices well actually the so

1396
00:49:01,119 --> 00:49:04,480
that you see

1397
00:49:02,559 --> 00:49:05,520
we're not it's not like you say

1398
00:49:04,480 --> 00:49:07,280
you know have you adopted this

1399
00:49:05,520 --> 00:49:10,559
fertilizer meaning have you used this

1400
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:12,640
fertilizer of any of your of your

1401
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:14,079
fields here you have

1402
00:49:12,640 --> 00:49:16,720
you know uh

1403
00:49:14,079 --> 00:49:19,440
a whole bunch of uh

1404
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:22,640
six main recommendations from sri

1405
00:49:19,440 --> 00:49:24,559
recommendation and basically

1406
00:49:22,640 --> 00:49:27,920
what is being tracked here are the main

1407
00:49:24,559 --> 00:49:27,920
recommendations that they make

1408
00:49:28,160 --> 00:49:31,599
these are this is the data that we have

1409
00:49:30,559 --> 00:49:35,040
on

1410
00:49:31,599 --> 00:49:37,680
agricultural performance at end line

1411
00:49:35,040 --> 00:49:40,400
we have yield value of crop output input

1412
00:49:37,680 --> 00:49:41,359
costs labor costs

1413
00:49:40,400 --> 00:49:43,599
um

1414
00:49:41,359 --> 00:49:44,720
total cost and profits

1415
00:49:43,599 --> 00:49:46,400
and here

1416
00:49:44,720 --> 00:49:49,200
these are all in

1417
00:49:46,400 --> 00:49:52,400
so this is in kg per decimal a decimal

1418
00:49:49,200 --> 00:49:53,839
is a very small unit of uh len land land

1419
00:49:52,400 --> 00:49:57,440
area

1420
00:49:53,839 --> 00:50:00,240
used in uh in bangladesh

1421
00:49:57,440 --> 00:50:03,280
um and these are bangladeshi taka per

1422
00:50:00,240 --> 00:50:05,440
decimal so these are in local currency

1423
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:07,599
and you can see there are differences uh

1424
00:50:05,440 --> 00:50:10,000
like for instance it's about 30

1425
00:50:07,599 --> 00:50:12,400
some taca difference here

1426
00:50:10,000 --> 00:50:15,440
uh here there is there's very basically

1427
00:50:12,400 --> 00:50:17,520
if anything is slower in terms of costs

1428
00:50:15,440 --> 00:50:18,880
uh it's the same in terms of labor cost

1429
00:50:17,520 --> 00:50:20,800
on average

1430
00:50:18,880 --> 00:50:23,040
and it's the same in terms of total cost

1431
00:50:20,800 --> 00:50:25,280
so there's a little bit of a higher

1432
00:50:23,040 --> 00:50:27,200
value of output and so you get a little

1433
00:50:25,280 --> 00:50:28,880
bit of higher

1434
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:31,119
imputed profit

1435
00:50:28,880 --> 00:50:34,319
okay so that's the and these these

1436
00:50:31,119 --> 00:50:34,319
things are significant

1437
00:50:35,119 --> 00:50:38,640
there's also something significant this

1438
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:41,359
is even that is significant even though

1439
00:50:38,640 --> 00:50:44,400
it's reasonably small

1440
00:50:41,359 --> 00:50:47,599
so these are all average comparisons so

1441
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:49,280
now we we haven't divided uh uh

1442
00:50:47,599 --> 00:50:51,359
farmers and treated villages into the

1443
00:50:49,280 --> 00:50:53,680
different treatment categories so let's

1444
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:55,839
let's do that now so here we've divided

1445
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:56,960
them into teacher training immediately

1446
00:50:55,839 --> 00:50:59,119
student

1447
00:50:56,960 --> 00:51:00,800
non-nominating student and non-student

1448
00:50:59,119 --> 00:51:02,559
these are the control means that i just

1449
00:51:00,800 --> 00:51:04,160
showed you a minute ago

1450
00:51:02,559 --> 00:51:06,400
and these are the adoption levels so you

1451
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:08,960
can see immediately that

1452
00:51:06,400 --> 00:51:13,280
that you know the teacher trainees

1453
00:51:08,960 --> 00:51:16,160
adopt a very high probability uh

1454
00:51:13,280 --> 00:51:16,880
about 70 percent of them the the this

1455
00:51:16,160 --> 00:51:20,160
are

1456
00:51:16,880 --> 00:51:22,720
the dependent variable is is is uh

1457
00:51:20,160 --> 00:51:24,480
it takes a value 100 if they adopt and

1458
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,800
zero if they don't adopt so that each

1459
00:51:24,480 --> 00:51:29,599
coefficient is easily readable as a

1460
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:30,559
percentage point

1461
00:51:29,599 --> 00:51:32,800
um

1462
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:36,000
and remember the baseline level of

1463
00:51:32,800 --> 00:51:38,400
adoption is very small so so everybody

1464
00:51:36,000 --> 00:51:41,119
here is significantly above that that

1465
00:51:38,400 --> 00:51:44,480
that that value

1466
00:51:41,119 --> 00:51:46,079
so they're all all quite significant

1467
00:51:44,480 --> 00:51:47,599
once you and then if you start looking

1468
00:51:46,079 --> 00:51:50,880
at the at the rest of the table you get

1469
00:51:47,599 --> 00:51:52,000
lots of uh lots of stars so basically

1470
00:51:50,880 --> 00:51:54,800
you know

1471
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:56,960
even here where even in

1472
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:58,319
control villages

1473
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:00,400
is you know

1474
00:51:58,319 --> 00:52:02,720
close to 18 of the farmers who follow

1475
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:05,520
this practice

1476
00:52:02,720 --> 00:52:08,640
anyway but then you get a much higher

1477
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:12,079
much higher these are these are you

1478
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:15,040
you know you have to add 18 to 17 to get

1479
00:52:12,079 --> 00:52:17,839
uh how much a non-nominating student

1480
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:19,680
uh how much if he follows the number of

1481
00:52:17,839 --> 00:52:21,119
seedling cabernet that's the way to read

1482
00:52:19,680 --> 00:52:23,200
it

1483
00:52:21,119 --> 00:52:25,839
so that's the intercept if you want

1484
00:52:23,200 --> 00:52:27,839
are these about just the plot on which

1485
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:30,160
they're doing it or the plots on which

1486
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:32,559
they're doing it or is it right so here

1487
00:52:30,160 --> 00:52:34,800
here all the plots are included so this

1488
00:52:32,559 --> 00:52:35,760
is basically a regression that runs by

1489
00:52:34,800 --> 00:52:37,440
plot

1490
00:52:35,760 --> 00:52:39,440
uh that's why there are some in there

1491
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,760
more than 3000 observations

1492
00:52:39,440 --> 00:52:43,200
because farmers could uh could mention

1493
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:45,040
up to three plots they collected

1494
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,280
information up to the three biggest plot

1495
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:49,359
decorative information on that

1496
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:51,440
and that's basically what the focus of

1497
00:52:49,359 --> 00:52:53,359
the study is because brac is not gonna

1498
00:52:51,440 --> 00:52:55,520
go and visit all your little tiny little

1499
00:52:53,359 --> 00:52:57,359
thing so they basically focus on up to

1500
00:52:55,520 --> 00:52:58,880
three plots per farmer

1501
00:52:57,359 --> 00:53:01,359
and these tend to be the biggest ones

1502
00:52:58,880 --> 00:53:03,200
and rice could typically be included so

1503
00:53:01,359 --> 00:53:05,680
that that's okay

1504
00:53:03,200 --> 00:53:08,160
so that's the that's the way

1505
00:53:05,680 --> 00:53:08,160
it's done

1506
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:13,280
um

1507
00:53:10,960 --> 00:53:15,839
so so basically the the lesson from this

1508
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,480
is that yeah with but pretty good effect

1509
00:53:15,839 --> 00:53:19,680
on on all these practices on adoption as

1510
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,839
measured

1511
00:53:19,680 --> 00:53:23,440
you know in a really relatively generous

1512
00:53:21,839 --> 00:53:26,160
way here

1513
00:53:23,440 --> 00:53:28,559
um compared to uh farmers in controlled

1514
00:53:26,160 --> 00:53:30,559
villages so that's the that's the first

1515
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,079
lesson

1516
00:53:30,559 --> 00:53:33,520
and then if you look

1517
00:53:32,079 --> 00:53:34,960
well you know these numbers are

1518
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:36,319
different so what about this number

1519
00:53:34,960 --> 00:53:38,000
compared to this one what about this

1520
00:53:36,319 --> 00:53:40,559
number compared to this one and so on so

1521
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:43,119
what about this number so what

1522
00:53:40,559 --> 00:53:46,400
so here we just basically

1523
00:53:43,119 --> 00:53:48,319
using these regressions so for the first

1524
00:53:46,400 --> 00:53:49,200
column we use this regression and we

1525
00:53:48,319 --> 00:53:51,200
just

1526
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:53,839
do these pairwise t tests you know this

1527
00:53:51,200 --> 00:53:55,680
is the coefficient

1528
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:57,280
of teacher trainee

1529
00:53:55,680 --> 00:53:58,800
significantly different from the

1530
00:53:57,280 --> 00:54:00,800
coefficient of

1531
00:53:58,800 --> 00:54:02,400
nominating students so basically we do

1532
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,440
these pairwise comparisons to see

1533
00:54:02,400 --> 00:54:04,559
whether

1534
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:05,599
there's a difference in treatment

1535
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:07,359
effects

1536
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:09,680
and you can see that when we're

1537
00:54:07,359 --> 00:54:11,599
comparing teachers and students

1538
00:54:09,680 --> 00:54:13,760
you always get these are p values here

1539
00:54:11,599 --> 00:54:15,920
so we just report p values

1540
00:54:13,760 --> 00:54:16,880
um since it's a test

1541
00:54:15,920 --> 00:54:18,800
and

1542
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,319
so they basically they are they are more

1543
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,160
adopting than other people you can see

1544
00:54:20,319 --> 00:54:24,240
lots of zeros everywhere these zeros

1545
00:54:22,160 --> 00:54:25,200
everywhere here you see teachers are

1546
00:54:24,240 --> 00:54:27,119
clearly

1547
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:29,920
overwhelmingly

1548
00:54:27,119 --> 00:54:32,240
adopting more sri

1549
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:33,359
in terms of the students

1550
00:54:32,240 --> 00:54:36,559
um

1551
00:54:33,359 --> 00:54:39,119
you can see that both both students you

1552
00:54:36,559 --> 00:54:41,440
know all of them is like also nearly all

1553
00:54:39,119 --> 00:54:43,839
uh there's one two here but other than

1554
00:54:41,440 --> 00:54:46,000
that they've pretty high a pretty low p

1555
00:54:43,839 --> 00:54:48,160
value so i get a high

1556
00:54:46,000 --> 00:54:49,599
uh significant effect that they they're

1557
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,160
more likely

1558
00:54:49,599 --> 00:54:54,640
to adopt than non-students in treated

1559
00:54:52,160 --> 00:54:56,480
villages okay so it's not just that

1560
00:54:54,640 --> 00:54:57,680
there was some kind of diffusion in the

1561
00:54:56,480 --> 00:54:59,520
whole village

1562
00:54:57,680 --> 00:55:01,440
and they benefited from it

1563
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,240
it's that they basically the fact that

1564
00:55:01,440 --> 00:55:06,559
they were targeted by our intervention

1565
00:55:04,240 --> 00:55:09,280
through a teacher a

1566
00:55:06,559 --> 00:55:10,960
trainee to receive a summary instruction

1567
00:55:09,280 --> 00:55:14,240
it actually made them more likely to

1568
00:55:10,960 --> 00:55:16,480
adopt these sri practices

1569
00:55:14,240 --> 00:55:19,200
um there is the only place where it is

1570
00:55:16,480 --> 00:55:21,520
except for this one which is borderline

1571
00:55:19,200 --> 00:55:23,359
significant i would say

1572
00:55:21,520 --> 00:55:26,000
everything else here is not significant

1573
00:55:23,359 --> 00:55:28,000
so basically this idea that we we had

1574
00:55:26,000 --> 00:55:29,760
which is basically behind the model

1575
00:55:28,000 --> 00:55:30,720
farmer

1576
00:55:29,760 --> 00:55:32,960
logic

1577
00:55:30,720 --> 00:55:34,559
the idea that people would pay more

1578
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:37,119
attention

1579
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,960
if they are matched to somebody they

1580
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:40,559
look up to somebody they regard as an

1581
00:55:38,960 --> 00:55:44,000
opinion leader as a

1582
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,119
as a as a source of valuable information

1583
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,400
um

1584
00:55:45,119 --> 00:55:51,119
and so if this was the case you know

1585
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:54,480
being matched with a model farmer

1586
00:55:51,119 --> 00:55:56,640
somebody you regard as a as a model

1587
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,319
makes you more likely to adopt what they

1588
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:00,480
tell you to do

1589
00:55:58,319 --> 00:56:02,799
what they teach you

1590
00:56:00,480 --> 00:56:05,359
then you would expect this number

1591
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:08,480
you would expect all these numbers to be

1592
00:56:05,359 --> 00:56:10,079
positive and significant they're all

1593
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:11,280
negative

1594
00:56:10,079 --> 00:56:12,640
yeah thankfully they're not

1595
00:56:11,280 --> 00:56:13,599
significantly negative but they're all

1596
00:56:12,640 --> 00:56:16,160
negative

1597
00:56:13,599 --> 00:56:19,040
except for this one's just borderline

1598
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:21,040
but marcel the the teacher trainee has

1599
00:56:19,040 --> 00:56:23,599
been nominated by somebody right they're

1600
00:56:21,040 --> 00:56:25,920
all above media nominations

1601
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:30,599
isn't it no no no no no no no there's

1602
00:56:25,920 --> 00:56:30,599
four above media and two below media

1603
00:56:31,200 --> 00:56:35,599
okay so is this coming from the above

1604
00:56:33,520 --> 00:56:38,799
median or the below median or is it the

1605
00:56:35,599 --> 00:56:38,799
same no matter which

1606
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:43,200
so what i'm trying to get at is

1607
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:44,799
i think your interpretation was it

1608
00:56:43,200 --> 00:56:46,960
doesn't you don't have to be a model

1609
00:56:44,799 --> 00:56:49,359
farmer you're equally effective at

1610
00:56:46,960 --> 00:56:52,480
disseminating i think is what you were

1611
00:56:49,359 --> 00:56:54,799
saying but but i'm saying that out of

1612
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:57,200
six four were considered

1613
00:56:54,799 --> 00:56:59,680
uh modeled by

1614
00:56:57,200 --> 00:57:01,920
by a larger number of people right so i

1615
00:56:59,680 --> 00:57:03,280
may not have nominated them but my

1616
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:06,400
neighbor nominated them so they're

1617
00:57:03,280 --> 00:57:07,119
probably still pretty good

1618
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,559
yeah

1619
00:57:07,119 --> 00:57:10,079
yeah it's a good idea we could do that

1620
00:57:08,559 --> 00:57:12,240
we haven't done that but we could do

1621
00:57:10,079 --> 00:57:13,920
that we could compare

1622
00:57:12,240 --> 00:57:15,520
we could do that that's that that goes

1623
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,599
in the direction of what the lip i was

1624
00:57:15,520 --> 00:57:19,839
mentioning earlier basically looking at

1625
00:57:17,599 --> 00:57:19,839
the

1626
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:26,799
yes

1627
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,960
we could also i mean we haven't done

1628
00:57:26,799 --> 00:57:31,040
that we of course we have the the whole

1629
00:57:28,960 --> 00:57:33,119
network of uh recommendations so we

1630
00:57:31,040 --> 00:57:35,119
could see whether

1631
00:57:33,119 --> 00:57:37,440
extend you know how much variation we

1632
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:39,280
have in centrality for in degree

1633
00:57:37,440 --> 00:57:41,119
centrality in this case in centrality or

1634
00:57:39,280 --> 00:57:43,680
even a

1635
00:57:41,119 --> 00:57:45,280
more sophisticated measure of centrality

1636
00:57:43,680 --> 00:57:46,079
yeah this is this is something we could

1637
00:57:45,280 --> 00:57:47,839
do

1638
00:57:46,079 --> 00:57:50,160
yeah yeah this is a good suggestion

1639
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:50,160
thanks

1640
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:58,079
thank you um

1641
00:57:56,400 --> 00:58:00,079
okay but

1642
00:57:58,079 --> 00:58:01,839
in terms of

1643
00:58:00,079 --> 00:58:03,359
uh being matched to

1644
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:08,760
somebody you didn't nominate doesn't

1645
00:58:03,359 --> 00:58:08,760
seem to disadvantage you here so

1646
00:58:10,160 --> 00:58:13,119
but i see what you hear what you're

1647
00:58:11,599 --> 00:58:14,400
saying and you say well maybe it's

1648
00:58:13,119 --> 00:58:15,599
because

1649
00:58:14,400 --> 00:58:17,200
you know what if you have been matched

1650
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:19,119
with somebody who was nominated by lots

1651
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,680
of people maybe that that's that's what

1652
00:58:19,119 --> 00:58:23,680
the role model would be okay okay so i

1653
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:25,200
for that i need to document the fact

1654
00:58:23,680 --> 00:58:27,680
that

1655
00:58:25,200 --> 00:58:29,119
what is the variation in centrality and

1656
00:58:27,680 --> 00:58:30,640
uh because if there is not much

1657
00:58:29,119 --> 00:58:33,040
variation in centrality everybody

1658
00:58:30,640 --> 00:58:34,480
mentions their five neighbors and

1659
00:58:33,040 --> 00:58:36,559
basically everybody is the same there's

1660
00:58:34,480 --> 00:58:38,079
no there's no central paper but it's a

1661
00:58:36,559 --> 00:58:39,760
good yeah it's very good point i will do

1662
00:58:38,079 --> 00:58:42,480
that we'll do that if you will add to

1663
00:58:39,760 --> 00:58:42,480
the paper thanks

1664
00:58:42,799 --> 00:58:46,799
um

1665
00:58:44,079 --> 00:58:49,040
okay so this is now again looking at the

1666
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,200
average three no i have to be careful

1667
00:58:49,040 --> 00:58:53,440
because i only have 15 minutes left um

1668
00:58:51,200 --> 00:58:56,079
the average treatment on

1669
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:59,280
on agricultural performance

1670
00:58:56,079 --> 00:58:59,280
these are now in log

1671
00:59:00,319 --> 00:59:03,920
because you know there's noise in the

1672
00:59:01,760 --> 00:59:06,079
data especially these values is always

1673
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,240
noise so if you take a look it kind of

1674
00:59:06,079 --> 00:59:09,680
dampens a little bit the the upper tail

1675
00:59:08,240 --> 00:59:10,720
and you don't have to wins horizon all

1676
00:59:09,680 --> 00:59:13,359
that so

1677
00:59:10,720 --> 00:59:15,839
so the the the news is that in terms of

1678
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:18,319
yields you get you get slightly higher

1679
00:59:15,839 --> 00:59:19,359
yields so basically seven percent higher

1680
00:59:18,319 --> 00:59:21,440
yield for

1681
00:59:19,359 --> 00:59:23,760
teacher training four percent for the

1682
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:25,440
five percent for the students

1683
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:27,119
and in terms of profit they get about

1684
00:59:25,440 --> 00:59:28,880
four you know the teachers i get about

1685
00:59:27,119 --> 00:59:31,200
fourteen percent high profits nine

1686
00:59:28,880 --> 00:59:33,920
percent and fourteen percent

1687
00:59:31,200 --> 00:59:36,000
um compared to the control so so there

1688
00:59:33,920 --> 00:59:37,920
is a there is some benefit

1689
00:59:36,000 --> 00:59:40,160
that that is uh

1690
00:59:37,920 --> 00:59:41,839
that is you know achieved through that

1691
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:43,200
it's not just that they

1692
00:59:41,839 --> 00:59:44,319
learn to

1693
00:59:43,200 --> 00:59:46,960
to

1694
00:59:44,319 --> 00:59:49,440
to mimic what had been told

1695
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:52,000
uh they also actually benefit uh from

1696
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:54,160
that so that that's the good news

1697
00:59:52,000 --> 00:59:56,640
um so now we

1698
00:59:54,160 --> 00:59:58,720
we so that's that's all about average

1699
00:59:56,640 --> 01:00:00,480
treatment effect so now i want to focus

1700
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,880
a little bit more about

1701
01:00:00,480 --> 01:00:06,319
uh i want to do a little bit more one is

1702
01:00:02,880 --> 01:00:06,319
the i want to compare

1703
01:00:06,400 --> 01:00:09,119
the students

1704
01:00:09,359 --> 01:00:13,760
depending on whether their

1705
01:00:11,280 --> 01:00:16,240
teacher is incentivized or not so

1706
01:00:13,760 --> 01:00:18,160
basically the this is the mean for

1707
01:00:16,240 --> 01:00:19,760
unincentivized

1708
01:00:18,160 --> 01:00:22,880
uh teachers

1709
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:25,760
and this is the the mean the additional

1710
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:28,960
increase in score

1711
01:00:25,760 --> 01:00:32,000
um in the quiz of of students who have

1712
01:00:28,960 --> 01:00:33,200
been assigned uh to an incentivized

1713
01:00:32,000 --> 01:00:35,440
teacher training and you can see there's

1714
01:00:33,200 --> 01:00:37,760
a little bit significant or you know

1715
01:00:35,440 --> 01:00:40,640
mindless significant uh improvement in

1716
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:42,319
in and it's a little bit stronger if you

1717
01:00:40,640 --> 01:00:44,480
look as to whether they answer the three

1718
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:45,920
main questions correctly

1719
01:00:44,480 --> 01:00:48,079
um

1720
01:00:45,920 --> 01:00:50,799
so that means that incentivizing the

1721
01:00:48,079 --> 01:00:52,720
teacher seems to

1722
01:00:50,799 --> 01:00:54,559
have induced the teacher to do a

1723
01:00:52,720 --> 01:00:56,960
slightly better job

1724
01:00:54,559 --> 01:00:58,799
in teaching them uh to the test of

1725
01:00:56,960 --> 01:01:00,079
course in teaching them to to take the

1726
01:00:58,799 --> 01:01:02,000
test

1727
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:04,319
okay

1728
01:01:02,000 --> 01:01:04,319
um

1729
01:01:05,520 --> 01:01:08,640
and this is whether

1730
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:11,359
we also looked as to whether it has an

1731
01:01:08,640 --> 01:01:13,359
effect on the teachers so basically

1732
01:01:11,359 --> 01:01:14,880
do the teachers do better on the test

1733
01:01:13,359 --> 01:01:16,160
because they

1734
01:01:14,880 --> 01:01:17,119
they taught

1735
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:18,960
uh

1736
01:01:17,119 --> 01:01:20,480
they know you had to teach the test

1737
01:01:18,960 --> 01:01:21,520
there we don't see well there's a

1738
01:01:20,480 --> 01:01:22,799
positive

1739
01:01:21,520 --> 01:01:25,040
but

1740
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:26,640
if you know coefficient here but it's

1741
01:01:25,040 --> 01:01:29,520
definitely not significant and you can

1742
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:31,839
see that the teachers do in general very

1743
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,160
very well on the test okay so it looks

1744
01:01:31,839 --> 01:01:35,119
like they were paying attention uh

1745
01:01:34,160 --> 01:01:36,079
knowing that they're going to be

1746
01:01:35,119 --> 01:01:38,079
teachers

1747
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,160
not doesn't really depend on them being

1748
01:01:38,079 --> 01:01:41,440
incentivized

1749
01:01:40,160 --> 01:01:44,319
um

1750
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:46,559
this is um

1751
01:01:44,319 --> 01:01:49,040
um this is the effect of or rather the

1752
01:01:46,559 --> 01:01:51,040
absence of effect of

1753
01:01:49,040 --> 01:01:53,119
so you see that if you incentivize a

1754
01:01:51,040 --> 01:01:55,039
teacher the students

1755
01:01:53,119 --> 01:01:57,280
do a little bit better on the test does

1756
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,280
it translate in higher adoption the

1757
01:01:57,280 --> 01:02:02,559
answer is no

1758
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:04,960
so the yeah we have slightly

1759
01:02:02,559 --> 01:02:05,520
the point estimates are very

1760
01:02:04,960 --> 01:02:08,160
the small

1761
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:10,400
nothing is ever significant

1762
01:02:08,160 --> 01:02:12,880
there is a very large relative to the

1763
01:02:10,400 --> 01:02:15,359
coefficients so basically there is no

1764
01:02:12,880 --> 01:02:16,400
that incentivization did not induce more

1765
01:02:15,359 --> 01:02:18,720
adoption

1766
01:02:16,400 --> 01:02:21,200
okay and it also did not induce more

1767
01:02:18,720 --> 01:02:22,720
adoption by the teachers the reason why

1768
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:25,359
we worry about that is

1769
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:26,559
is uh because in the other paper the one

1770
01:02:25,359 --> 01:02:28,720
we did

1771
01:02:26,559 --> 01:02:32,000
on referrals what we found is that the

1772
01:02:28,720 --> 01:02:34,319
farmers who referred all the farmers

1773
01:02:32,000 --> 01:02:35,359
um the other farmers kind of learn about

1774
01:02:34,319 --> 01:02:36,960
that they know that they've been

1775
01:02:35,359 --> 01:02:38,559
referred oh you know marshall you

1776
01:02:36,960 --> 01:02:40,559
referred me okay

1777
01:02:38,559 --> 01:02:43,200
and then so marcel suddenly decides oh

1778
01:02:40,559 --> 01:02:45,359
me now he's observing me is he you know

1779
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:47,280
he knows that i referred him so maybe i

1780
01:02:45,359 --> 01:02:48,960
should put my money where my mouth is so

1781
01:02:47,280 --> 01:02:50,640
basically you know i better adopt a

1782
01:02:48,960 --> 01:02:52,720
little bit or maybe pretend to adopt a

1783
01:02:50,640 --> 01:02:54,480
little bit so that i don't completely

1784
01:02:52,720 --> 01:02:55,839
don't look completely silly to have

1785
01:02:54,480 --> 01:02:59,200
recommended

1786
01:02:55,839 --> 01:03:00,480
this person for training

1787
01:02:59,200 --> 01:03:02,319
otherwise he would say why did you send

1788
01:03:00,480 --> 01:03:05,280
me something completely useful to do

1789
01:03:02,319 --> 01:03:07,839
something completely useless panel sorry

1790
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:10,319
so so that's why we we we just looked

1791
01:03:07,839 --> 01:03:12,880
this to whether they don't do that here

1792
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:14,880
we did not induce excess

1793
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:17,870
adoption by teachers by incentivizing

1794
01:03:14,880 --> 01:03:20,720
them which i think is good news

1795
01:03:17,870 --> 01:03:22,960
[Music]

1796
01:03:20,720 --> 01:03:24,079
now so this is about incentivization

1797
01:03:22,960 --> 01:03:26,160
this is about the other treatment

1798
01:03:24,079 --> 01:03:28,160
whether you are assigned to a teacher

1799
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:30,960
that you nominated or not

1800
01:03:28,160 --> 01:03:34,000
so does it affect the performance

1801
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:35,680
of the student on the quiz well there's

1802
01:03:34,000 --> 01:03:37,839
a there's a point estimate which is

1803
01:03:35,680 --> 01:03:40,160
positive here but it's definitely not

1804
01:03:37,839 --> 01:03:41,440
significant same thing here this is very

1805
01:03:40,160 --> 01:03:43,760
small

1806
01:03:41,440 --> 01:03:45,920
so basically the answer is no the fact

1807
01:03:43,760 --> 01:03:48,960
that you are assigned to somebody you

1808
01:03:45,920 --> 01:03:50,880
you regard as you listed as a role model

1809
01:03:48,960 --> 01:03:53,359
doesn't affect how much you learn from

1810
01:03:50,880 --> 01:03:56,000
them even on the quiz

1811
01:03:53,359 --> 01:03:58,640
and this is what happens um

1812
01:03:56,000 --> 01:04:00,720
on your adoption itself if anything

1813
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:02,079
there's one one thing here that's

1814
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,480
negative

1815
01:04:02,079 --> 01:04:05,680
but uh which i kind of already saw

1816
01:04:04,480 --> 01:04:07,680
before

1817
01:04:05,680 --> 01:04:10,160
borderline significant at ten percent

1818
01:04:07,680 --> 01:04:12,480
level but other than that it's all it's

1819
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:14,559
all negative and so yeah let's just

1820
01:04:12,480 --> 01:04:16,240
confirms what we already looked at

1821
01:04:14,559 --> 01:04:18,480
before

1822
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:21,039
what about mediation analysis it's going

1823
01:04:18,480 --> 01:04:23,039
into a bigger direction of um

1824
01:04:21,039 --> 01:04:24,839
heterogeneity analysis so

1825
01:04:23,039 --> 01:04:26,960
so here basically we're

1826
01:04:24,839 --> 01:04:28,960
gonna we're gonna we're gonna think

1827
01:04:26,960 --> 01:04:31,359
about what could be the process by which

1828
01:04:28,960 --> 01:04:33,119
the teacher

1829
01:04:31,359 --> 01:04:35,599
is um

1830
01:04:33,119 --> 01:04:38,079
is inducing adoption is it because

1831
01:04:35,599 --> 01:04:41,359
he's transferring more knowledge and

1832
01:04:38,079 --> 01:04:42,799
this knowledge is useful for adoption

1833
01:04:41,359 --> 01:04:44,480
okay well you have to know what the

1834
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:46,240
practices are before you can actually

1835
01:04:44,480 --> 01:04:48,559
follow them and be

1836
01:04:46,240 --> 01:04:50,319
measured as following them

1837
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:52,960
or is it that

1838
01:04:50,319 --> 01:04:55,200
people follow the example so basically

1839
01:04:52,960 --> 01:04:56,880
you know if the if the teacher is

1840
01:04:55,200 --> 01:04:59,359
adopting and

1841
01:04:56,880 --> 01:05:00,799
maybe he can can take the the trainees

1842
01:04:59,359 --> 01:05:02,000
to the field or at least he can talk

1843
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:05,359
them through it

1844
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:07,839
on the field so that so that's the

1845
01:05:05,359 --> 01:05:10,160
so to do that basically we thought well

1846
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,559
why don't we put

1847
01:05:10,160 --> 01:05:12,559
um

1848
01:05:13,580 --> 01:05:19,559
[Music]

1849
01:05:15,039 --> 01:05:19,559
that should not be

1850
01:05:22,640 --> 01:05:25,760
so this is the incentivized teacher

1851
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:28,160
trainee

1852
01:05:25,760 --> 01:05:29,920
and then we thought well

1853
01:05:28,160 --> 01:05:32,720
if it is uh

1854
01:05:29,920 --> 01:05:37,839
uh no this this is not this is the quiz

1855
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:37,839
performance of the something here

1856
01:05:38,240 --> 01:05:40,880
sorry

1857
01:05:39,440 --> 01:05:43,280
i think this is not the teacher's value

1858
01:05:40,880 --> 01:05:44,880
it's the the student's value of the so

1859
01:05:43,280 --> 01:05:46,950
basically

1860
01:05:44,880 --> 01:05:48,559
if if the effect of um

1861
01:05:46,950 --> 01:05:50,799
[Music]

1862
01:05:48,559 --> 01:05:52,400
is no no this is okay sorry sorry i got

1863
01:05:50,799 --> 01:05:55,039
confused for a second this is the effect

1864
01:05:52,400 --> 01:05:57,520
on on the

1865
01:05:55,039 --> 01:05:59,440
on the the the students performance in

1866
01:05:57,520 --> 01:06:02,000
the quiz this is the student and the

1867
01:05:59,440 --> 01:06:04,880
quiz and basically students whose

1868
01:06:02,000 --> 01:06:07,280
teacher does better on the quiz

1869
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:09,359
also do better on the quiz so basically

1870
01:06:07,280 --> 01:06:11,920
there's some transmission of knowledge

1871
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:14,160
from the teacher to the student so

1872
01:06:11,920 --> 01:06:16,000
teachers who learn more

1873
01:06:14,160 --> 01:06:18,000
translate more

1874
01:06:16,000 --> 01:06:19,359
to their to their students even

1875
01:06:18,000 --> 01:06:21,200
controlling for the fact that the

1876
01:06:19,359 --> 01:06:22,640
teacher may have been incentivized so we

1877
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:24,720
control for that so that here's a

1878
01:06:22,640 --> 01:06:26,880
control we're just looking whether the

1879
01:06:24,720 --> 01:06:29,119
transmission is through or at least some

1880
01:06:26,880 --> 01:06:30,400
of the transmission is through

1881
01:06:29,119 --> 01:06:32,559
knowledge transformation

1882
01:06:30,400 --> 01:06:33,440
the teachers who learn more transfer

1883
01:06:32,559 --> 01:06:37,119
more

1884
01:06:33,440 --> 01:06:37,119
to their to their um

1885
01:06:37,520 --> 01:06:40,880
to their students

1886
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:44,319
and this is by nominate the same thing

1887
01:06:40,880 --> 01:06:47,760
by domination status so again you know

1888
01:06:44,319 --> 01:06:49,440
is also there

1889
01:06:47,760 --> 01:06:51,599
um

1890
01:06:49,440 --> 01:06:54,480
this is the effect of the of the quiz

1891
01:06:51,599 --> 01:06:56,400
score on on

1892
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:58,640
adoption and so basically you look as to

1893
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,520
whether this has an effect on adoption

1894
01:06:58,640 --> 01:07:01,039
as well

1895
01:06:59,520 --> 01:07:04,400
and so you get

1896
01:07:01,039 --> 01:07:06,079
you get a couple significant terms there

1897
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,359
but other than that it seems to be

1898
01:07:06,079 --> 01:07:09,119
pretty flat

1899
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:10,799
and the same thing

1900
01:07:09,119 --> 01:07:12,400
is reproduced if you

1901
01:07:10,799 --> 01:07:14,720
if you compare

1902
01:07:12,400 --> 01:07:16,160
nominating students non-nominating

1903
01:07:14,720 --> 01:07:17,839
students instead of comparing

1904
01:07:16,160 --> 01:07:19,920
incentivized

1905
01:07:17,839 --> 01:07:21,359
uh teacher training students to

1906
01:07:19,920 --> 01:07:23,920
non-instant device teacher training

1907
01:07:21,359 --> 01:07:25,440
students so so basically what this says

1908
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:27,359
is that

1909
01:07:25,440 --> 01:07:30,559
performance on the quiz score

1910
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:33,359
uh of the teacher just just has some

1911
01:07:30,559 --> 01:07:34,640
some transmission to uh

1912
01:07:33,359 --> 01:07:37,520
uh to

1913
01:07:34,640 --> 01:07:39,680
to adoption suggesting that

1914
01:07:37,520 --> 01:07:41,200
knowledge is is one of the channels of

1915
01:07:39,680 --> 01:07:42,720
transmission

1916
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:44,720
as you would expect i mean you would

1917
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,480
hope this is true but but now we have to

1918
01:07:44,720 --> 01:07:48,400
look at the other thing which is

1919
01:07:46,480 --> 01:07:49,280
um

1920
01:07:48,400 --> 01:07:52,160
um

1921
01:07:49,280 --> 01:07:54,000
examples teaching by example so so here

1922
01:07:52,160 --> 01:07:55,039
we go we're looking at the teachers

1923
01:07:54,000 --> 01:07:56,960
value

1924
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:59,440
of the the corresponding adoption

1925
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:02,000
measure so basically

1926
01:07:59,440 --> 01:08:04,160
are people more likely to adopt is if

1927
01:08:02,000 --> 01:08:06,319
the teacher adopts are there people more

1928
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:07,520
likely to plant on a large proportion of

1929
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:09,039
their land

1930
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:11,280
if the teacher does that and so on so

1931
01:08:09,039 --> 01:08:13,920
basically we you can see that in all

1932
01:08:11,280 --> 01:08:15,520
these cases that these things are are

1933
01:08:13,920 --> 01:08:17,440
positive

1934
01:08:15,520 --> 01:08:19,600
the only exception being this one where

1935
01:08:17,440 --> 01:08:21,440
teachers are already quite high start

1936
01:08:19,600 --> 01:08:22,319
with

1937
01:08:21,440 --> 01:08:24,159
so

1938
01:08:22,319 --> 01:08:25,759
so there's nothing perhaps a bit less

1939
01:08:24,159 --> 01:08:28,560
variation there but so what you find is

1940
01:08:25,759 --> 01:08:31,279
that it's basically the evidence that

1941
01:08:28,560 --> 01:08:32,159
both channels are operating here one is

1942
01:08:31,279 --> 01:08:34,000
that

1943
01:08:32,159 --> 01:08:35,759
if you are taught by a better teacher

1944
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:38,080
someone who is paid more attention to

1945
01:08:35,759 --> 01:08:40,239
the course knows more you do you adopt

1946
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:42,159
more it's a channel of transmission and

1947
01:08:40,239 --> 01:08:43,440
you're also better you also know better

1948
01:08:42,159 --> 01:08:44,719
on the quiz

1949
01:08:43,440 --> 01:08:46,640
and

1950
01:08:44,719 --> 01:08:49,199
and then the other thing is that if the

1951
01:08:46,640 --> 01:08:51,520
teacher adopts you you seem to

1952
01:08:49,199 --> 01:08:53,679
be more likely to follow his example so

1953
01:08:51,520 --> 01:08:56,319
these two things are there

1954
01:08:53,679 --> 01:08:58,880
so the last thing i'm gonna do um in the

1955
01:08:56,319 --> 01:09:01,279
three minutes i have

1956
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:02,640
i should have stopped earlier but um

1957
01:09:01,279 --> 01:09:06,239
um

1958
01:09:02,640 --> 01:09:08,880
so we also would like to know whether

1959
01:09:06,239 --> 01:09:12,400
inviting trainees to be a teacher has an

1960
01:09:08,880 --> 01:09:14,799
effect of of on their adoption okay not

1961
01:09:12,400 --> 01:09:16,799
relative to their students but relative

1962
01:09:14,799 --> 01:09:19,920
to trainees who would not have received

1963
01:09:16,799 --> 01:09:22,080
this task of training other students so

1964
01:09:19,920 --> 01:09:23,920
fortunately we have this other

1965
01:09:22,080 --> 01:09:25,839
uh experimental events you know it's

1966
01:09:23,920 --> 01:09:27,600
also an rct

1967
01:09:25,839 --> 01:09:29,440
and in that experiment we have a whole

1968
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,400
batch of

1969
01:09:29,440 --> 01:09:32,480
um

1970
01:09:30,400 --> 01:09:34,640
trainees who are randomly selected among

1971
01:09:32,480 --> 01:09:36,480
the 30 farmers and we're only trained

1972
01:09:34,640 --> 01:09:38,000
they only receive the training so we can

1973
01:09:36,480 --> 01:09:40,239
kind of compare them

1974
01:09:38,000 --> 01:09:41,759
to the to the teachers so that's

1975
01:09:40,239 --> 01:09:44,319
basically what we do in this in this

1976
01:09:41,759 --> 01:09:47,120
first comparison here and what you find

1977
01:09:44,319 --> 01:09:49,040
is that so p2p the me is basically means

1978
01:09:47,120 --> 01:09:51,199
that you were in the in the teacher

1979
01:09:49,040 --> 01:09:52,239
training experiment and not in the other

1980
01:09:51,199 --> 01:09:54,800
experiment

1981
01:09:52,239 --> 01:09:58,320
what you find is that so if the average

1982
01:09:54,800 --> 01:10:00,560
adoption in um of the of the

1983
01:09:58,320 --> 01:10:03,520
uh of the randomly selected trainees in

1984
01:10:00,560 --> 01:10:06,239
the other experiment was 36

1985
01:10:03,520 --> 01:10:09,040
then among uh our teacher training you

1986
01:10:06,239 --> 01:10:12,560
know we know it's it's like close to 70

1987
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:14,800
so it's basically 34 higher than that

1988
01:10:12,560 --> 01:10:17,040
okay so that's that's the idea

1989
01:10:14,800 --> 01:10:19,600
so basically what you get is that

1990
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:22,800
um inviting people to be teacher

1991
01:10:19,600 --> 01:10:24,320
training makes them adopt more

1992
01:10:22,800 --> 01:10:25,360
okay

1993
01:10:24,320 --> 01:10:26,960
um

1994
01:10:25,360 --> 01:10:29,280
and it doesn't necessarily do that for

1995
01:10:26,960 --> 01:10:31,440
the for the food you know if you these

1996
01:10:29,280 --> 01:10:33,760
these other comparisons are not more

1997
01:10:31,440 --> 01:10:34,880
significant but perhaps the surprise is

1998
01:10:33,760 --> 01:10:35,840
that

1999
01:10:34,880 --> 01:10:38,320
um

2000
01:10:35,840 --> 01:10:41,440
the the student farmers if you compare

2001
01:10:38,320 --> 01:10:42,719
them to or to to to other trainees

2002
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,400
they're not

2003
01:10:42,719 --> 01:10:46,159
that you know sometimes a little bit

2004
01:10:44,400 --> 01:10:47,760
less sometimes a bit more

2005
01:10:46,159 --> 01:10:49,600
but they're not

2006
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:51,760
massively different from

2007
01:10:49,600 --> 01:10:52,960
people who actually receive the black

2008
01:10:51,760 --> 01:10:54,560
training

2009
01:10:52,960 --> 01:10:56,400
which i think is quite remarkable these

2010
01:10:54,560 --> 01:11:00,320
are these are people who have not seen

2011
01:10:56,400 --> 01:11:01,920
any bracket uh training agent so they

2012
01:11:00,320 --> 01:11:03,600
basically all they've learned about sri

2013
01:11:01,920 --> 01:11:05,520
is from other farmers and and their

2014
01:11:03,600 --> 01:11:07,760
adoption and behavior

2015
01:11:05,520 --> 01:11:10,159
in general is relatively similar to to

2016
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:13,280
people who in the other

2017
01:11:10,159 --> 01:11:15,280
um in the other uh experiment received

2018
01:11:13,280 --> 01:11:17,199
and trained directly from black

2019
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:19,600
we did we do a small

2020
01:11:17,199 --> 01:11:21,360
back of the envelope cosmetic analysis

2021
01:11:19,600 --> 01:11:23,600
the details of

2022
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:24,880
the calculations are in the appendix

2023
01:11:23,600 --> 01:11:26,640
we get a

2024
01:11:24,880 --> 01:11:28,719
we estimate a social return of two

2025
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:30,880
points basically you value the profits

2026
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:32,800
and so on and compare it to the cost

2027
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,760
that we have incurred

2028
01:11:32,800 --> 01:11:39,040
and you know you get a two

2029
01:11:35,760 --> 01:11:41,440
point two and a half dollars per dollar

2030
01:11:39,040 --> 01:11:43,280
invested in the program which generates

2031
01:11:41,440 --> 01:11:44,880
a rate of return social rate of return

2032
01:11:43,280 --> 01:11:47,360
150

2033
01:11:44,880 --> 01:11:49,760
which is not bad it's lower than what we

2034
01:11:47,360 --> 01:11:51,440
got in the other experiment but the

2035
01:11:49,760 --> 01:11:53,520
other experiment

2036
01:11:51,440 --> 01:11:55,840
um suggested that

2037
01:11:53,520 --> 01:11:55,840
um

2038
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:59,440
if you incentivize me if you push people

2039
01:11:57,760 --> 01:12:00,800
they tend to over adopt so they

2040
01:11:59,440 --> 01:12:02,560
basically

2041
01:12:00,800 --> 01:12:04,719
you kind of induce them to experiment

2042
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:06,480
with uh with the technology and then

2043
01:12:04,719 --> 01:12:08,000
everything experimented they discover

2044
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,679
it's not for them it's too difficult for

2045
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:11,840
them and then they withdraw from the

2046
01:12:09,679 --> 01:12:14,560
technology the year after we noticed

2047
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:16,400
that so here by inducing more people to

2048
01:12:14,560 --> 01:12:17,920
adopt with

2049
01:12:16,400 --> 01:12:20,400
you know it's great we have induced lots

2050
01:12:17,920 --> 01:12:23,440
of people to experiment but as as we

2051
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:25,360
said not sri is not for everybody and so

2052
01:12:23,440 --> 01:12:26,880
so as a result maybe there's excess if

2053
01:12:25,360 --> 01:12:28,320
you want excess experimentation i don't

2054
01:12:26,880 --> 01:12:30,080
know if it's success but

2055
01:12:28,320 --> 01:12:32,080
lots of people experiment who don't

2056
01:12:30,080 --> 01:12:33,920
necessarily benefit from it certainly

2057
01:12:32,080 --> 01:12:35,440
not in the first year they try it so

2058
01:12:33,920 --> 01:12:37,199
that's the that's the kind of the

2059
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:38,400
general uh

2060
01:12:37,199 --> 01:12:40,480
lesson here

2061
01:12:38,400 --> 01:12:42,560
and maybe i should i should stop here

2062
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:44,400
and if there's still time for

2063
01:12:42,560 --> 01:12:47,400
some questions if people still have

2064
01:12:44,400 --> 01:12:47,400
questions

2065
01:12:50,000 --> 01:12:53,760
have any questions from the audience

2066
01:12:56,880 --> 01:13:00,400
so marcel just to follow up on dilip's

2067
01:12:58,719 --> 01:13:02,159
earlier question

2068
01:13:00,400 --> 01:13:04,159
you don't really look at heterogeneity

2069
01:13:02,159 --> 01:13:06,880
with respect to any characteristics of

2070
01:13:04,159 --> 01:13:08,640
either the teachers or the students

2071
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:11,520
no yes

2072
01:13:08,640 --> 01:13:11,520
and is uh

2073
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:16,800
and is that because of lack of power or

2074
01:13:13,840 --> 01:13:19,360
lack of data or or lack or you think

2075
01:13:16,800 --> 01:13:21,120
it's not really identified

2076
01:13:19,360 --> 01:13:24,239
it's probably due to

2077
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:28,159
perceived lack of patience for it by

2078
01:13:24,239 --> 01:13:30,960
editors and referees i think that's the

2079
01:13:28,159 --> 01:13:32,400
thing oh you are picking winners you go

2080
01:13:30,960 --> 01:13:34,320
you have 27

2081
01:13:32,400 --> 01:13:37,920
heterogeneity tests you just report the

2082
01:13:34,320 --> 01:13:39,120
one that gives you a big kick and

2083
01:13:37,920 --> 01:13:41,920
so

2084
01:13:39,120 --> 01:13:43,840
and then in any case it's not uh

2085
01:13:41,920 --> 01:13:45,920
it's not as it's not experimentally

2086
01:13:43,840 --> 01:13:48,320
assigned and so on on

2087
01:13:45,920 --> 01:13:50,320
so we tried to

2088
01:13:48,320 --> 01:13:52,159
but i think that the but you have given

2089
01:13:50,320 --> 01:13:54,960
me some suggestion for

2090
01:13:52,159 --> 01:13:56,640
for uh i really liked the suggested

2091
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:58,640
suggestion earlier

2092
01:13:56,640 --> 01:14:00,080
about looking at uh

2093
01:13:58,640 --> 01:14:01,440
nominations i think it's a very good

2094
01:14:00,080 --> 01:14:02,800
suggestion and we should do that in the

2095
01:14:01,440 --> 01:14:04,320
paper because it really fits in the

2096
01:14:02,800 --> 01:14:05,760
paper and it fits in the motivation of

2097
01:14:04,320 --> 01:14:07,520
the paper

2098
01:14:05,760 --> 01:14:10,960
and uh it's it's of course related to

2099
01:14:07,520 --> 01:14:10,960
what dilip was saying as well so

2100
01:14:11,040 --> 01:14:14,880
yeah i had i had another sort of broader

2101
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:18,800
question here it's

2102
01:14:14,880 --> 01:14:21,520
i mean can you reject the uh story where

2103
01:14:18,800 --> 01:14:23,840
there's just one kind of heterogeneity

2104
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:26,400
which is uh skill

2105
01:14:23,840 --> 01:14:28,560
and denominations basically were a way

2106
01:14:26,400 --> 01:14:30,080
to identify the more skilled

2107
01:14:28,560 --> 01:14:31,520
farmers

2108
01:14:30,080 --> 01:14:33,280
and the students themselves were

2109
01:14:31,520 --> 01:14:35,840
selected by brac on the basis of

2110
01:14:33,280 --> 01:14:37,679
something which i probably assume is

2111
01:14:35,840 --> 01:14:40,000
related to farming skill

2112
01:14:37,679 --> 01:14:41,840
so you've already got a pre-selected you

2113
01:14:40,000 --> 01:14:43,920
know high-skilled farmers and then

2114
01:14:41,840 --> 01:14:45,120
within them you're selecting the most

2115
01:14:43,920 --> 01:14:46,400
skill and they just happen to be

2116
01:14:45,120 --> 01:14:48,320
teachers

2117
01:14:46,400 --> 01:14:51,520
so can you reject the hypothesis that

2118
01:14:48,320 --> 01:14:53,920
it's just about selection of skill

2119
01:14:51,520 --> 01:14:56,800
that all this teaching stuff is

2120
01:14:53,920 --> 01:14:59,360
you know it's not doing anything uh i

2121
01:14:56,800 --> 01:15:01,520
mean of course yeah

2122
01:14:59,360 --> 01:15:04,159
there's some diffusion obviously

2123
01:15:01,520 --> 01:15:06,159
uh but you know but basically you know

2124
01:15:04,159 --> 01:15:08,239
it's not nothing to do with

2125
01:15:06,159 --> 01:15:09,120
skill and teaching or anything like that

2126
01:15:08,239 --> 01:15:10,880
i mean

2127
01:15:09,120 --> 01:15:12,320
it's just skill in picking up stuff

2128
01:15:10,880 --> 01:15:15,840
that's now

2129
01:15:12,320 --> 01:15:15,840
generally available in the village

2130
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:21,520
no but i mean

2131
01:15:18,640 --> 01:15:21,520
that's fine but

2132
01:15:22,080 --> 01:15:24,640
but

2133
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:26,800
it's not true that we have only selected

2134
01:15:24,640 --> 01:15:29,440
as teachers those that were the most

2135
01:15:26,800 --> 01:15:31,679
skilled as measured by the number of

2136
01:15:29,440 --> 01:15:33,600
nominations they received

2137
01:15:31,679 --> 01:15:35,440
with four four people among them you

2138
01:15:33,600 --> 01:15:38,159
know but it was biased in favor of the

2139
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:39,199
people with high nominations so i think

2140
01:15:38,159 --> 01:15:41,199
you know doing what sujata was

2141
01:15:39,199 --> 01:15:43,440
suggesting is a good idea is you know

2142
01:15:41,199 --> 01:15:45,199
actually why not just look at the number

2143
01:15:43,440 --> 01:15:47,120
of nominations

2144
01:15:45,199 --> 01:15:49,679
that you received and just look at you

2145
01:15:47,120 --> 01:15:52,960
know how performance varied with that

2146
01:15:49,679 --> 01:15:52,960
uh that that would be one way

2147
01:15:56,400 --> 01:16:00,239
okay

2148
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:02,560
yeah i can do that i can do that but

2149
01:16:00,239 --> 01:16:03,920
remember in terms of the test itself i

2150
01:16:02,560 --> 01:16:06,159
mean

2151
01:16:03,920 --> 01:16:07,600
we have corrected for the stratification

2152
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:09,760
so

2153
01:16:07,600 --> 01:16:11,199
so i don't think that's the

2154
01:16:09,760 --> 01:16:12,719
that's that's

2155
01:16:11,199 --> 01:16:14,640
i don't think that is invalidating our

2156
01:16:12,719 --> 01:16:16,560
results because we have we thought about

2157
01:16:14,640 --> 01:16:18,560
it it's a different interpretation i'm

2158
01:16:16,560 --> 01:16:20,400
just saying i'm not disputing the

2159
01:16:18,560 --> 01:16:21,760
statistical validity of your results

2160
01:16:20,400 --> 01:16:24,480
it's just a question of what what you

2161
01:16:21,760 --> 01:16:26,080
think is sort of going on underneath and

2162
01:16:24,480 --> 01:16:27,360
whether teaching has anything to do with

2163
01:16:26,080 --> 01:16:29,600
it

2164
01:16:27,360 --> 01:16:32,080
yes

2165
01:16:29,600 --> 01:16:34,800
so in the first experiment the one with

2166
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,480
the 182 whatever villages where you

2167
01:16:34,800 --> 01:16:39,679
didn't ask them to teach but did you

2168
01:16:36,480 --> 01:16:39,679
select them the same way

2169
01:16:40,960 --> 01:16:45,199
it was simpler because we were not

2170
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:47,120
trying to match but uh okay so

2171
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:50,000
the the the

2172
01:16:47,120 --> 01:16:52,320
guy can so in that experiment

2173
01:16:50,000 --> 01:16:53,840
the the start is the same we take 30

2174
01:16:52,320 --> 01:16:55,679
brac shows up

2175
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:57,679
picks their 30 farmers because that's

2176
01:16:55,679 --> 01:17:00,080
the way they they kind of line up

2177
01:16:57,679 --> 01:17:02,640
farmers for sri training so they kind of

2178
01:17:00,080 --> 01:17:04,880
identify them and then they keep them

2179
01:17:02,640 --> 01:17:06,960
and they then they bring the

2180
01:17:04,880 --> 01:17:09,679
the training agent

2181
01:17:06,960 --> 01:17:10,719
so so and they train them in groups of

2182
01:17:09,679 --> 01:17:13,440
12

2183
01:17:10,719 --> 01:17:16,400
so basically we basically

2184
01:17:13,440 --> 01:17:18,320
randomly selected 12 farmers of the 30

2185
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:20,800
and assigned them to

2186
01:17:18,320 --> 01:17:23,040
for the first training session and then

2187
01:17:20,800 --> 01:17:25,120
at the end of the training session

2188
01:17:23,040 --> 01:17:28,080
each of them was asked to so there were

2189
01:17:25,120 --> 01:17:30,080
18 farmers left on the list so before

2190
01:17:28,080 --> 01:17:31,760
they left

2191
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:34,239
they say oh before you leave and because

2192
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:37,120
they get paid their little stipend

2193
01:17:34,239 --> 01:17:39,360
so before you you know here's a list

2194
01:17:37,120 --> 01:17:42,000
pick a name on the list as to

2195
01:17:39,360 --> 01:17:44,640
who would most benefit from

2196
01:17:42,000 --> 01:17:45,920
uh the brock training

2197
01:17:44,640 --> 01:17:48,480
so they basically look at the list and

2198
01:17:45,920 --> 01:17:50,719
say oh okay i can see uh albert's on the

2199
01:17:48,480 --> 01:17:51,520
list so i'm gonna mention albert and

2200
01:17:50,719 --> 01:17:52,880
then

2201
01:17:51,520 --> 01:17:55,199
the next person comes and say oh i'm

2202
01:17:52,880 --> 01:17:56,880
gonna mention albert two no no look it's

2203
01:17:55,199 --> 01:17:58,080
already been crossed you can't mention

2204
01:17:56,880 --> 01:17:59,760
albert anymore you have to mention

2205
01:17:58,080 --> 01:18:02,320
someone else okay i'm going to mention

2206
01:17:59,760 --> 01:18:03,679
juja so they basically mentioned simon

2207
01:18:02,320 --> 01:18:05,679
basically then you can see the people

2208
01:18:03,679 --> 01:18:07,760
who have been so in that paper we

2209
01:18:05,679 --> 01:18:11,960
actually use that

2210
01:18:07,760 --> 01:18:11,960
order if you want to see

2211
01:18:12,239 --> 01:18:18,640
the bottom line is that um they did not

2212
01:18:15,679 --> 01:18:20,560
they did not recommend on average so

2213
01:18:18,640 --> 01:18:22,560
everybody they recommend 12 people out

2214
01:18:20,560 --> 01:18:26,000
of 18. so normally you should you should

2215
01:18:22,560 --> 01:18:27,840
you know the six worst farmers at least

2216
01:18:26,000 --> 01:18:30,000
able farmers or least skilled farmers

2217
01:18:27,840 --> 01:18:33,920
should have been dropped out of the list

2218
01:18:30,000 --> 01:18:34,880
so they you should basically see that

2219
01:18:33,920 --> 01:18:38,800
this

2220
01:18:34,880 --> 01:18:40,480
selected sample of 12 out of 18 farmers

2221
01:18:38,800 --> 01:18:43,440
should be better

2222
01:18:40,480 --> 01:18:44,800
than the 12 randomly selected farmers

2223
01:18:43,440 --> 01:18:47,120
right

2224
01:18:44,800 --> 01:18:49,600
because the second sample is a

2225
01:18:47,120 --> 01:18:51,760
is only two thirds of the 18

2226
01:18:49,600 --> 01:18:54,800
and they've been selected to be

2227
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:56,400
the most skilled farmers

2228
01:18:54,800 --> 01:18:57,679
so you should see that they are adopting

2229
01:18:56,400 --> 01:18:58,719
more because they understand what's

2230
01:18:57,679 --> 01:19:00,960
going on

2231
01:18:58,719 --> 01:19:01,679
and they they get more more benefit from

2232
01:19:00,960 --> 01:19:05,120
it

2233
01:19:01,679 --> 01:19:06,640
that's not that what we find at all

2234
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:08,000
so the reason i was asking was i was

2235
01:19:06,640 --> 01:19:09,440
wondering if that helps you answer

2236
01:19:08,000 --> 01:19:11,520
dilip's question about whether there's

2237
01:19:09,440 --> 01:19:14,960
something about having to teach that

2238
01:19:11,520 --> 01:19:16,960
makes you a better adopter yourself

2239
01:19:14,960 --> 01:19:18,560
but you can't actually answer that

2240
01:19:16,960 --> 01:19:20,640
question because the way that these

2241
01:19:18,560 --> 01:19:21,600
teachers those guys were selected is

2242
01:19:20,640 --> 01:19:23,199
different

2243
01:19:21,600 --> 01:19:24,800
it's random they're not both being

2244
01:19:23,199 --> 01:19:26,400
selected the same way then some get to

2245
01:19:24,800 --> 01:19:29,520
teach and others don't get to teach it's

2246
01:19:26,400 --> 01:19:29,520
not as simple as that

2247
01:19:30,960 --> 01:19:34,320
i mean everybody could have been

2248
01:19:32,640 --> 01:19:36,159
selected to teach

2249
01:19:34,320 --> 01:19:38,159
everybody has a

2250
01:19:36,159 --> 01:19:41,360
probability of being selected if you are

2251
01:19:38,159 --> 01:19:43,520
of the 15 above median you have uh four

2252
01:19:41,360 --> 01:19:45,520
out of 15 chances if you are above the

2253
01:19:43,520 --> 01:19:48,480
15 you have two out of 15 chances

2254
01:19:45,520 --> 01:19:50,400
everybody could be a teacher

2255
01:19:48,480 --> 01:19:52,560
and we correct for the probabilities of

2256
01:19:50,400 --> 01:19:56,880
of you being being a teacher

2257
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,880
yeah yeah that i do understand that

2258
01:19:57,520 --> 01:20:00,239
okay

2259
01:19:58,400 --> 01:20:02,719
i think we're a little bit past time so

2260
01:20:00,239 --> 01:20:04,800
uh i'd like to thank myself very

2261
01:20:02,719 --> 01:20:06,560

2262
01:20:04,800 --> 01:20:09,280

2272
01:20:29,199 --> 01:20:32,719
event

2273
01:20:30,159 --> 01:20:34,320
in lieu of having a workshop in person

2274
01:20:32,719 --> 01:20:36,560

2275
01:20:34,320 --> 01:20:39,040
it's been really valuable in the world

01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:41,280
