date and with that our next slide is a

56
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:35,360
welcome to today's webinar and our

57
00:02:33,120 --> 00:02:39,280
speaker I'd like to tell you a little

58
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:42,159
bit about Dr harleen hatterman Valente

59
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:45,440
she was born in northeast Nebraska and

60
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:48,800
raised on a crop and Animal Farm she

61
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,120
came to NDSU in 2000 as an assistant

62
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,720
professor in the high value crops

63
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,959
project so she has spent more time in

64
00:02:53,720 --> 00:02:59,560
North Dakota than Nebraska she has

65
00:02:56,959 --> 00:03:02,040
conducted research on approximately 20

66
00:02:59,560 --> 00:03:04,760
different different crops but aliam

67
00:03:02,040 --> 00:03:08,640
crops have been most predominant during

68
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:11,760
her 23 plus years at NDSU and I have a

69
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:13,840
beautiful blooming bulb behind me right

70
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,280
now that's quite fragrant so I'm looking

71
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:19,879
forward to Spring and some of the bulbs

72
00:03:16,280 --> 00:03:21,040
that pop up so welcome harleen and I'll

73
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:26,440
you can take it

74
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:29,400
away okay so that is wonderful so today

75
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:33,959
um the the topic is how to grow garlic

76
00:03:29,400 --> 00:03:37,040
and aliums and I only have about 45

77
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,080
minutes so I'm not going to touch on a

78
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,040
lot of

79
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:44,519
aliums um uh because there are way too

80
00:03:42,040 --> 00:03:47,840
many that uh it would take days to go

81
00:03:44,519 --> 00:03:50,280
and discuss them all uh but so today I'm

82
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:55,680
just going to talk about three of them

83
00:03:50,280 --> 00:03:57,519
uh garlic dry bulb onions and leaks and

84
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,799
those are the big three that we can

85
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:02,640
really grow quite well here in North

86
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:06,519
Dakota so with that I'm going to start

87
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:09,000
with a little bit about um garlic well

88
00:04:06,519 --> 00:04:11,959
first I'll just talk about the the genus

89
00:04:09,000 --> 00:04:16,000
alium it is one of the largest flowering

90
00:04:11,959 --> 00:04:18,359
plant groups in the amarillis family and

91
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,160
that's what Julie was talking about she

92
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:23,919
probably has an amarillis that is what

93
00:04:21,160 --> 00:04:26,360
its common name is uh bulb flowering

94
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:27,680
right now the family name is actually

95
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,400
amarilla

96
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:36,240
daier um and this consists of hundreds

97
00:04:31,400 --> 00:04:39,639
of wild and cultivated scented bulbus

98
00:04:36,240 --> 00:04:43,400
herbs and the three that I have talked

99
00:04:39,639 --> 00:04:47,479
about are um well known there's there's

100
00:04:43,400 --> 00:04:50,240
also a lot of chives for example is

101
00:04:47,479 --> 00:04:53,360
another one but there's even herbaceous

102
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:56,800
ornamentals that um grow quite well in

103
00:04:53,360 --> 00:05:01,320
North Dakota that um Chinese garlic for

104
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:03,960
one and ornamental onion uh that uh grow

105
00:05:01,320 --> 00:05:07,199
quite well and prolifically as

106
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:10,400
herbaceous ornamentals but today we're

107
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:14,520
going to talk about more of the culinary

108
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:16,800
ones and and to start with um garlic you

109
00:05:14,520 --> 00:05:19,960
know it can be used for a whole bunch of

110
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:22,000
different things um I have a graduate

111
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:24,400
student that is looking at uh the

112
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,680
cultivars and some of the information

113
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:29,280
that I'm going to provide is from his

114
00:05:26,680 --> 00:05:33,560
trial to give you an idea of which Cult

115
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:36,479
of Art do better in North Dakota than um

116
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,479
other places but I also have a graduate

117
00:05:36,479 --> 00:05:42,240
student that is looking at aliums for

118
00:05:39,479 --> 00:05:45,120
their um Health

119
00:05:42,240 --> 00:05:47,680
attributes uh we know garlic has a lot

120
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:49,720
of Health attributes and I'll talk about

121
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:54,039
that in a little bit but she's looking

122
00:05:49,720 --> 00:05:57,039
at um how some of these other aliums

123
00:05:54,039 --> 00:06:01,919
leaks um green

124
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:04,840
onions um dry ball bulb onions and boy

125
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:07,599
now I lost my thought on the third one

126
00:06:04,840 --> 00:06:09,800
um it'll come to me probably when I get

127
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,280
to the end but she's looking at more of

128
00:06:09,800 --> 00:06:16,400
the health attributes and that's because

129
00:06:13,280 --> 00:06:19,960
a lot of these

130
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:23,599
uh aliums have these

131
00:06:19,960 --> 00:06:28,319
bioactive components in garlic it's

132
00:06:23,599 --> 00:06:34,000
alisin and Alin and actually Alin is the

133
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:36,400
precursor to Al sin so um most of the um

134
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,160
the health attributes has to do with

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:42,919
this sulfur compound of alisin which is

136
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,120
the most predominant in garlic but

137
00:06:42,919 --> 00:06:47,120
garlic also has a g

138
00:06:47,240 --> 00:06:53,599
glutamine sorry a mouthful and

139
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:57,360
polyphenolics and we've been looking in

140
00:06:53,599 --> 00:07:00,080
collaboration with um Dr Kalita Shetty

141
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:03,720
on um just

142
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:07,840
the the health benefits of the

143
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:11,360
polyphenolics um with type 2 diabetes so

144
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:14,280
um cidra's whole research is looking at

145
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:18,319
um the four aliums for

146
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:20,800
that um as far as uh the amount of

147
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:24,120
production of garlic the United Nations

148
00:07:20,800 --> 00:07:27,199
food and agricultural assoc organization

149
00:07:24,120 --> 00:07:30,680
has uh estimated that on an annual basis

150
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:35,039
there's about 11 million tons of garlic

151
00:07:30,680 --> 00:07:39,160
produced and that's just on 2.5 million

152
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:41,319
Acres um that's worldwide that isn't the

153
00:07:39,160 --> 00:07:45,080
United States actually in the United

154
00:07:41,319 --> 00:07:48,199
States we import a lot of our garlic and

155
00:07:45,080 --> 00:07:51,159
that's because of the uses and

156
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:54,360
effectiveness of it treating uh many

157
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:56,840
different Cancers and diseases and so

158
00:07:54,360 --> 00:07:59,840
the consumption has

159
00:07:56,840 --> 00:08:02,759
increased faster than actually the

160
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:05,440
production has increased so in the

161
00:08:02,759 --> 00:08:09,400
United States especially we're really

162
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:12,120
importing quite a bit of um forgot to

163
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:14,680
start up my little thing well I'll look

164
00:08:12,120 --> 00:08:19,159
at time make sure I don't run

165
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:21,520
over um importing much of the garlic so

166
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:23,400
now let's go in a little bit get started

167
00:08:21,520 --> 00:08:28,360
on the production and

168
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:32,360
management um garlic grows best in a a

169
00:08:28,360 --> 00:08:35,000
welld drained Sandy clay LOM soil so a

170
00:08:32,360 --> 00:08:37,599
little bit heavier soil and actually we

171
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:42,919
have a study where we're um trying to

172
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:46,040
see how these cultivars compare um at

173
00:08:42,919 --> 00:08:50,480
our horiculture research site which is

174
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:53,000
more of a Sandy LOM and comparison to on

175
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:56,920
campus here where we're in the Red River

176
00:08:53,000 --> 00:09:00,320
Valley we have a clay soil uh and so

177
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:03,399
we're we're testing that uh we planted

178
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:06,320
those last fall and we'll hopefully have

179
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:09,519
some results come this uh kind of late

180
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:15,560
July um period when we

181
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:19,079
Harvest um soil pH is best around 6 to

182
00:09:15,560 --> 00:09:22,279
6.8 uh but I know we have a little bit

183
00:09:19,079 --> 00:09:26,079
higher um pH out at the Horticulture

184
00:09:22,279 --> 00:09:29,920
research Farm it's more of a 72 maybe

185
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:32,959
7.4 and we haven't had any problems um

186
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:37,839
with that so um one nice thing about

187
00:09:32,959 --> 00:09:41,079
garlic is it it's it's a very uh

188
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:44,680
adaptable plant in most

189
00:09:41,079 --> 00:09:50,279
cases as far as nutrition you know we

190
00:09:44,680 --> 00:09:54,760
want to overall apply between 70 and 125

191
00:09:50,279 --> 00:09:58,399
pounds of nitrogen 150 lbs of um

192
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:01,800
phosphorus and a excuse me about 100

193
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:05,320
pounds of potassium now that will depend

194
00:10:01,800 --> 00:10:10,880
on your soil test and what previous crop

195
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:12,800
you had a and uh so um but it's also

196
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,360
important that we don't put all that

197
00:10:12,800 --> 00:10:18,399
nitrogen down at F at one time we really

198
00:10:16,360 --> 00:10:22,440
want to spoon feed the

199
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:25,880
nitrogen um and so that should be split

200
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:28,920
into approximately 25 lbs before

201
00:10:25,880 --> 00:10:32,040
planting and then side dress around 20

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:34,560
lb every 3 weeks and then we want to

203
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:38,600
make sure we stop four to six weeks

204
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:42,320
before Harvest um because we really want

205
00:10:38,600 --> 00:10:45,920
that plant not to keep trying to grow

206
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,120
and produce it has to um you know it

207
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:50,480
it's a rather long season the way it is

208
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:57,800
we need that dry down we have to go and

209
00:10:50,480 --> 00:11:01,560
cure those uh um B um bulbs and and and

210
00:10:57,800 --> 00:11:04,440
it also helps if you shut that off so

211
00:11:01,560 --> 00:11:08,160
that you don't it in the preservation

212
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:11,279
otherwise uh your bulbs will deteriorate

213
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:15,440
quicker if we keep on fertilizing right

214
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:18,519
to the end um as far as irrigation I

215
00:11:15,440 --> 00:11:20,880
think drip irrigation works the best

216
00:11:18,519 --> 00:11:24,720
with drip irrigation you can avoid some

217
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:29,639
of those uh Leaf diseases that um all

218
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:32,839
aliums can get uh and uh with drip

219
00:11:29,639 --> 00:11:36,279
irrigation then it's easy enough to um

220
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:39,839
put on about an inch a week if it's

221
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:42,200
getting um towards the end and the

222
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:45,920
plants are bigger you might need to go

223
00:11:42,200 --> 00:11:49,079
and put two two inches a week when it's

224
00:11:45,920 --> 00:11:53,920
um some of those hot days especi like

225
00:11:49,079 --> 00:11:56,160
last year we had June weather no July

226
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:59,000
weather was in June so it was really

227
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:04,120
really hot we had a number of 100 degree

228
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:07,200
days days um and aliam in general do not

229
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:10,000
really like those hot days so it's best

230
00:12:07,200 --> 00:12:12,199
that we do whatever we can to go and and

231
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:15,440
help them through those kind of

232
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:19,120
periods now there are three different

233
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:24,079
types of garlic you have your um

234
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:28,880
elephant garlic uh softnet um garlic and

235
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:30,040
hardnet garlic we in in the northern

236
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:34,160
part

237
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:37,760
um do best with hard neck

238
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:41,720
cultivars and um

239
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:46,199
so and but there's a lot of there's also

240
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:50,160
then subgroups but hard neck by far are

241
00:12:46,199 --> 00:12:54,480
are the only ones that we grow in North

242
00:12:50,160 --> 00:12:57,399
Dakota so when do we get started well

243
00:12:54,480 --> 00:13:01,160
we're past that time already we needed

244
00:12:57,399 --> 00:13:04,199
to do that this last fall approximately

245
00:13:01,160 --> 00:13:08,440
6 to eight weeks before that ground

246
00:13:04,199 --> 00:13:10,800
freezes um and we actually have another

247
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,040
study where we're looking at you know

248
00:13:10,800 --> 00:13:16,240
what is the optimum time because there

249
00:13:13,040 --> 00:13:19,760
hasn't been any research on that for um

250
00:13:16,240 --> 00:13:22,160
garlic and and so I'd rather have us do

251
00:13:19,760 --> 00:13:27,040
some trial and air and figure out when's

252
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:29,800
the best time uh to have um to go and uh

253
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:33,480
transplant your cloves of garlic

254
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:36,440
um than to have someone else go and and

255
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:41,160
trial around and find out um that

256
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:44,519
through more air than um anything else

257
00:13:41,160 --> 00:13:48,880
um spacing your rose spacing should be

258
00:13:44,519 --> 00:13:52,680
anywhere from 12 to um 36 in or 1 to 3

259
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:56,040
feet and then um between the cloves you

260
00:13:52,680 --> 00:13:57,720
want somewhere between 3 and 6 in they

261
00:13:56,040 --> 00:14:00,440
kind of like to be kind of close

262
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:03,480
together but you need to go and give

263
00:14:00,440 --> 00:14:06,360
them enough room so that um they aren't

264
00:14:03,480 --> 00:14:13,920
pushing against each other and deforming

265
00:14:06,360 --> 00:14:16,920
each other so depth um is 3 to 4 in deep

266
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:18,880
and and so you see the picture and in

267
00:14:16,920 --> 00:14:21,040
which they've just kind of marked out

268
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:24,199
the row then they'll go and cover that

269
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:26,880
with soil you can do that or you can go

270
00:14:24,199 --> 00:14:29,399
and just actually if you have a well

271
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:32,600
tilled soil you can probably just push

272
00:14:29,399 --> 00:14:34,600
them down to that depth another way of

273
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,800
looking at it is that the top of the

274
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:42,199
clove has to be twice the depth of the

275
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:49,920
clove height so if your clove was about

276
00:14:42,199 --> 00:14:52,759
1 and2 in uh tall then you want 3 in um

277
00:14:49,920 --> 00:14:57,480
above that tip of that

278
00:14:52,759 --> 00:15:00,440
clove of course um we need to mulch in

279
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:04,440
this uh climate that we have actually

280
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:07,199
one time I was growing some and um I

281
00:15:04,440 --> 00:15:10,399
thought well the previous year generally

282
00:15:07,199 --> 00:15:13,160
we have plenty of snow and I said oh

283
00:15:10,399 --> 00:15:16,519
they'll be fine I won't have to go and

284
00:15:13,160 --> 00:15:19,040
and get some straw and mulch them and

285
00:15:16,519 --> 00:15:21,360
sure enough that was the fall that we

286
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:25,279
had the really cold weather before we

287
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,120
got the insulation from the snow and so

288
00:15:25,279 --> 00:15:31,560
the following

289
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:33,839
spring um most of them did not emerge uh

290
00:15:31,560 --> 00:15:37,199
they in fact they just because of that

291
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:40,920
cold injury they just rotted in the soil

292
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:44,920
so you want four to six inches of

293
00:15:40,920 --> 00:15:47,600
straw and the nice thing about that is

294
00:15:44,920 --> 00:15:51,639
uh you know having that

295
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:54,319
straw through the winter protecting it

296
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:57,639
um you can then leave it there and it

297
00:15:54,319 --> 00:15:59,639
provides uh wheat control not allowing a

298
00:15:57,639 --> 00:16:02,959
lot of those annual weat needs to get

299
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:06,639
enough sunlight to go and germinate so

300
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:10,920
it it it provides weed control as well

301
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:15,160
and that is always a a good thing um

302
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:18,959
because there's not a lot of way um easy

303
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:22,600
ways to go and for weed control usually

304
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:25,040
it's by hand weeding uh the roots are

305
00:16:22,600 --> 00:16:28,959
rather shallow and you really don't want

306
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:32,160
to go and disturb the roots so um uh the

307
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:35,160
mainly it's been hand weeding for for

308
00:16:32,160 --> 00:16:38,600
especially for a homeowner I think if we

309
00:16:35,160 --> 00:16:41,199
were to have a big commercial grower

310
00:16:38,600 --> 00:16:45,639
then they would have put down their um

311
00:16:41,199 --> 00:16:50,480
pre-emergence herbicide um way before uh

312
00:16:45,639 --> 00:16:54,839
the uh garlic or the weeds

313
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:59,440
emerged so let's go on okay more on the

314
00:16:54,839 --> 00:17:02,880
production and management so um garlic

315
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:06,880
will flour and these uh that flowering

316
00:17:02,880 --> 00:17:09,160
stem is called escape and that must be

317
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:12,319
removed because if you don't remove that

318
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:15,679
and you allow the garlic to flour then

319
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:18,799
it's taking away nutrition from that

320
00:17:15,679 --> 00:17:22,880
bulb and those cloves and putting it

321
00:17:18,799 --> 00:17:26,880
towards that flour stock and that flour

322
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:29,440
so you you remove the Scapes and they

323
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:31,640
can be consumed or you if you have a

324
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:33,000
farmers market you can sell them you can

325
00:17:31,640 --> 00:17:35,960
make them into a whole bunch of

326
00:17:33,000 --> 00:17:39,080
different things I'm sure Julie has um

327
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:43,520
all kinds of recipes for Scapes uh

328
00:17:39,080 --> 00:17:48,840
anything from a pesto to um just a pan

329
00:17:43,520 --> 00:17:52,200
uh frying them could be done um and so

330
00:17:48,840 --> 00:17:55,159
when you do that then the next sequence

331
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:58,080
of what happens is it's time to go and

332
00:17:55,159 --> 00:18:01,400
harvest and you're going to go and

333
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:06,400
harvest the them when there's about six

334
00:18:01,400 --> 00:18:10,280
brown leaves or 60% of those leaves turn

335
00:18:06,400 --> 00:18:13,720
brown I should say um

336
00:18:10,280 --> 00:18:18,159
unlike well they do like onions they'll

337
00:18:13,720 --> 00:18:20,840
actually that stem will Kink over uh but

338
00:18:18,159 --> 00:18:23,120
you generally want to do that before you

339
00:18:20,840 --> 00:18:25,799
don't want to wait that long because

340
00:18:23,120 --> 00:18:28,159
then that plant is also

341
00:18:25,799 --> 00:18:31,280
overmature and especially if you're

342
00:18:28,159 --> 00:18:33,400
going to go and try to you utilize any

343
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:36,760
of those cloves to plant the following

344
00:18:33,400 --> 00:18:39,880
year or if you want some long storage um

345
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:43,080
they're going to have poor quality so

346
00:18:39,880 --> 00:18:46,559
when 60% of the leaves turn brown uh you

347
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:50,039
can either go and try to um pull and

348
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:52,520
twist but I really think the best thing

349
00:18:50,039 --> 00:18:54,760
is to have a like the picture shows have

350
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:57,840
some kind of a fork or shovel or

351
00:18:54,760 --> 00:19:01,039
something to help dig those because I

352
00:18:57,840 --> 00:19:05,039
have gone and um thought I could just

353
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:10,720
pull them out and um no I'm missing part

354
00:19:05,039 --> 00:19:14,120
of the the bulb so um I just try to I

355
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:17,760
use a shovel and help to help dig them

356
00:19:14,120 --> 00:19:22,080
up well after that um just like other

357
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:25,280
aliums that you want to um maybe store

358
00:19:22,080 --> 00:19:29,360
or even if you were going to use them um

359
00:19:25,280 --> 00:19:32,320
shortly you need to do some curing and

360
00:19:29,360 --> 00:19:35,760
uh it's best if you avoid trying to cure

361
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,760
these outside in full sun because a lot

362
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:41,760
of times you can have problems with Suns

363
00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:46,600
scold on those so um

364
00:19:41,760 --> 00:19:49,320
indoor at a temperature around 75 80°

365
00:19:46,600 --> 00:19:50,919
Fahrenheit and you can see as a picture

366
00:19:49,320 --> 00:19:54,039
they have them in these little netted

367
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:58,760
bags so that they can have some air

368
00:19:54,039 --> 00:20:00,720
circulation uh and then well actually

369
00:19:58,760 --> 00:20:04,440
after one to two weeks then you cut off

370
00:20:00,720 --> 00:20:06,440
the stems and you can then continue to

371
00:20:04,440 --> 00:20:11,480
store them this

372
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:13,840
way um and if you do in those kind of

373
00:20:11,480 --> 00:20:17,440
situations then they'll be able to go

374
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:19,919
and be stored for one to two weeks if

375
00:20:17,440 --> 00:20:23,080
you want longer storage you need to have

376
00:20:19,919 --> 00:20:26,240
them at a refrigerated temperature with

377
00:20:23,080 --> 00:20:29,480
relatively low um relative humidity and

378
00:20:26,240 --> 00:20:33,440
then you can go and and store them

379
00:20:29,480 --> 00:20:38,320
um if you're a lot of garlic growers

380
00:20:33,440 --> 00:20:41,880
will go and um use their own cloves for

381
00:20:38,320 --> 00:20:43,840
next uh for the planting in the fall um

382
00:20:41,880 --> 00:20:46,960
and if you're going to do that you have

383
00:20:43,840 --> 00:20:48,760
to make sure that you um store those

384
00:20:46,960 --> 00:20:53,200
cloves that you're going to use for your

385
00:20:48,760 --> 00:20:56,799
seed at around 50° fahit with that

386
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:59,400
relatively low um relative

387
00:20:56,799 --> 00:21:02,880
humidity if you don't if you go at

388
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:05,840
temperatures less than 5050 that hastens

389
00:21:02,880 --> 00:21:09,760
the breaking of dorcy so you're going to

390
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:12,400
end up uh maybe having a longer shoot

391
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:16,440
and it's really going I mean you don't

392
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:19,720
want that shoot really above ground um

393
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:22,440
in the fall so you're trying to plant it

394
00:21:19,720 --> 00:21:24,840
so that it gets a start but you don't

395
00:21:22,440 --> 00:21:27,120
want it above ground um and it's going

396
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:30,240
to be difficult to do that when if it

397
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:33,320
breaks dorcy early

398
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:35,720
likewise if you go and uh store them at

399
00:21:33,320 --> 00:21:39,279
a much warmer temperature greater than

400
00:21:35,720 --> 00:21:42,640
65 that actually will go and delay the

401
00:21:39,279 --> 00:21:46,120
sprouting and thus I'm going to also

402
00:21:42,640 --> 00:21:48,840
throw things out of whack because you

403
00:21:46,120 --> 00:21:51,720
really want to have those come up in the

404
00:21:48,840 --> 00:21:53,840
spring because they don't do really well

405
00:21:51,720 --> 00:21:57,159
in really hot hot

406
00:21:53,840 --> 00:22:00,080
temperatures that what um and so if you

407
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,200
have that earlier emerg in the spring

408
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:03,640
they'll get mature and you won't have to

409
00:22:02,200 --> 00:22:07,080
worry about

410
00:22:03,640 --> 00:22:08,720
that see you on my time

411
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,320
okay

412
00:22:08,720 --> 00:22:13,679
so um now I'm going to just talk a

413
00:22:11,320 --> 00:22:16,840
little bit about some of the cultivar or

414
00:22:13,679 --> 00:22:21,200
the cultivar trial that Stephen is doing

415
00:22:16,840 --> 00:22:23,880
and so he's looked at these 29 cultivars

416
00:22:21,200 --> 00:22:27,320
and you'll see that some of them say

417
00:22:23,880 --> 00:22:30,159
2021 and have the same name and and

418
00:22:27,320 --> 00:22:31,640
that's because we're actually TR um

419
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:35,360
using the

420
00:22:31,640 --> 00:22:40,760
seed seed I guess the clothes that that

421
00:22:35,360 --> 00:22:44,679
we planted in 2021 seeing if there are

422
00:22:40,760 --> 00:22:49,480
certain cultivars that do better that um

423
00:22:44,679 --> 00:22:52,159
are more adapted to our um environmental

424
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:56,240
conditions that would work better for

425
00:22:52,159 --> 00:22:58,679
someone who who is trying to go and use

426
00:22:56,240 --> 00:23:03,159
their own seed and continue to use their

427
00:22:58,679 --> 00:23:07,480
own seed or maybe sell um

428
00:23:03,159 --> 00:23:12,960
garlic and so that's why those say

429
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:18,000
2021 um as far as then results so this

430
00:23:12,960 --> 00:23:22,360
is the the results that Steph Got U from

431
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:25,320
2023 and he at initially he was looking

432
00:23:22,360 --> 00:23:28,480
at uh the number of leaves that are

433
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:30,200
produced because um more Leaf production

434
00:23:28,480 --> 00:23:33,400
ction just means there's more

435
00:23:30,200 --> 00:23:37,279
photosynthates that go into that bulb so

436
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:39,799
help that bulb um get larger and of

437
00:23:37,279 --> 00:23:44,000
course that's what we want and when you

438
00:23:39,799 --> 00:23:47,600
look at this this is 30 and 45 uh days

439
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:50,840
after they emerged from the soil and we

440
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:54,120
see here that you know we have a a

441
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:57,600
number of them that are doing well both

442
00:23:54,120 --> 00:24:00,760
uh they are producing around six leaves

443
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:04,120
um at 30 days and at 45 days they're

444
00:24:00,760 --> 00:24:08,159
right up around N9

445
00:24:04,120 --> 00:24:11,919
days um one in particular went from only

446
00:24:08,159 --> 00:24:14,080
producing about five leaves um at 30

447
00:24:11,919 --> 00:24:17,520
days and really shot up the leaf

448
00:24:14,080 --> 00:24:22,559
production that was Yukon Ukrainian red

449
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:27,399
um and by um 45 days it was up to nine

450
00:24:22,559 --> 00:24:32,039
leaves when we looked at um then 60 and

451
00:24:27,399 --> 00:24:35,320
80 Days after emergence um the order

452
00:24:32,039 --> 00:24:38,480
hasn't really changed too much uh there

453
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:42,159
was you know they really didn't go and

454
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:46,399
do a lot of lot more growth except for

455
00:24:42,159 --> 00:24:50,080
like Ukrainian red it um did quite well

456
00:24:46,399 --> 00:24:53,440
in that um it can you know continued to

457
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:57,559
produce some leaves so that by 60 days

458
00:24:53,440 --> 00:25:01,440
it was at um 11 and just a little bit

459
00:24:57,559 --> 00:25:03,520
higher at 80 Days in in comparison to a

460
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:04,279
lot of these others that stayed around

461
00:25:03,520 --> 00:25:08,039
that

462
00:25:04,279 --> 00:25:10,440
Nine area another one that was the

463
00:25:08,039 --> 00:25:15,760
Deerfield purple

464
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:20,120
2021 cloves and it again jumped up from

465
00:25:15,760 --> 00:25:23,760
having around nine to right up there to

466
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:25,360
uh 10 10 and a half

467
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:29,039
leaves

468
00:25:25,360 --> 00:25:32,320
so there was then a number of the that

469
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:35,120
just you know they after 45 days they

470
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,799
really didn't change much in in their

471
00:25:35,120 --> 00:25:40,840
Leaf

472
00:25:36,799 --> 00:25:43,960
production oops there we go as far as

473
00:25:40,840 --> 00:25:46,960
average scape length what we were seeing

474
00:25:43,960 --> 00:25:50,080
is that you know

475
00:25:46,960 --> 00:25:54,279
um the ones that were producing more

476
00:25:50,080 --> 00:25:57,480
Scapes or longer Scapes generally are

477
00:25:54,279 --> 00:25:59,960
more adapted to the environmental

478
00:25:57,480 --> 00:26:04,360
conditions that we have here in North

479
00:25:59,960 --> 00:26:06,320
Dakota um our best was Dakota white but

480
00:26:04,360 --> 00:26:08,960
statistically because these other

481
00:26:06,320 --> 00:26:12,399
letters also have an A or these other

482
00:26:08,960 --> 00:26:15,279
cultivars also have an A associated with

483
00:26:12,399 --> 00:26:18,679
them there was no statistical

484
00:26:15,279 --> 00:26:22,200
differences in uh the average scape

485
00:26:18,679 --> 00:26:22,200
length for those

486
00:26:22,360 --> 00:26:30,679
cultivars when we look at average scape

487
00:26:25,799 --> 00:26:33,360
weight again we had a few more so um

488
00:26:30,679 --> 00:26:36,279
there's a number of those that went and

489
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:39,559
didn't have the longest skape length but

490
00:26:36,279 --> 00:26:43,399
they were probably thicker thus they had

491
00:26:39,559 --> 00:26:47,360
uh similar weights and you can see uh

492
00:26:43,399 --> 00:26:50,320
those seven right there that were um for

493
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:50,320
average scape

494
00:26:51,039 --> 00:26:57,600
weight now this um average bulb diameter

495
00:26:55,279 --> 00:27:00,679
um again I I should have probably

496
00:26:57,600 --> 00:27:04,159
earlier talked about what the scale is

497
00:27:00,679 --> 00:27:07,039
here this is in millimeters but really

498
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:11,960
the what I'm trying to get across is you

499
00:27:07,039 --> 00:27:14,919
can see how uh the diameter went from

500
00:27:11,960 --> 00:27:19,200
these which were all statistically the

501
00:27:14,919 --> 00:27:22,559
same having the largest diameter to

502
00:27:19,200 --> 00:27:25,440
those that had um were statist

503
00:27:22,559 --> 00:27:28,640
statistically the same for having a

504
00:27:25,440 --> 00:27:31,919
rather small diameter bulbs

505
00:27:28,640 --> 00:27:36,799
and that then when we look at average

506
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:40,519
bulb weight which a lot of times um is

507
00:27:36,799 --> 00:27:44,720
is how they're sold uh we see here that

508
00:27:40,519 --> 00:27:47,480
we had three of them that had um the

509
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:50,600
that had the heaviest weight um German

510
00:27:47,480 --> 00:27:54,720
White had by far the the heaviest weight

511
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:58,760
but Georgian fire and music were

512
00:27:54,720 --> 00:28:03,600
statistically the same for weights

513
00:27:58,760 --> 00:28:06,919
in opposition to that we we now know

514
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:09,720
that um or pretty sure we'll find out

515
00:28:06,919 --> 00:28:12,480
with our second year of data um this

516
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:16,919
year when we Harvest but we have a a

517
00:28:12,480 --> 00:28:21,840
pretty good idea that uh

518
00:28:16,919 --> 00:28:24,720
um purple white spring chestnut red

519
00:28:21,840 --> 00:28:29,600
Yugoslavian Ukrainian red which is kind

520
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:33,640
of unique well um that was 2021 spay

521
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:38,320
Deerfield German red and Italian Lola

522
00:28:33,640 --> 00:28:40,840
can canono um really had now most of

523
00:28:38,320 --> 00:28:46,519
those had smaller bulbs but they also

524
00:28:40,840 --> 00:28:48,480
had very small weight for um for

525
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:52,600
um

526
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:57,000
garlic so in conclusion the average

527
00:28:52,600 --> 00:28:59,919
number of leaves um was similar for all

528
00:28:57,000 --> 00:29:02,559
these cultivars and until about 60 days

529
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:05,360
after they emerged from the ground and

530
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:07,519
then after that then Ukrainian red

531
00:29:05,360 --> 00:29:10,760
really took off and it produced the

532
00:29:07,519 --> 00:29:12,440
highest number of leaves however that

533
00:29:10,760 --> 00:29:17,200
wasn't

534
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:20,440
associated with um with bulb diameter or

535
00:29:17,200 --> 00:29:22,679
bulb weight for that

536
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:25,200
cultivar um when we're talking about

537
00:29:22,679 --> 00:29:28,200
Scapes Dakota white and German white

538
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:33,120
produced the longest and heaviest scapes

539
00:29:28,200 --> 00:29:36,679
respectively while this Italian Lio Kono

540
00:29:33,120 --> 00:29:39,720
uh and white spring did not even produce

541
00:29:36,679 --> 00:29:42,399
Scapes when we're talking about um the

542
00:29:39,720 --> 00:29:45,320
bulbs then there was numerous cultivars

543
00:29:42,399 --> 00:29:50,440
that produced bulbs that had a diameter

544
00:29:45,320 --> 00:29:53,000
of approximately 2.4 2 and2 in but only

545
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,519
German White had the bulbs that weighed

546
00:29:53,000 --> 00:29:58,840
over 2.5

547
00:29:55,519 --> 00:30:00,440
o and so by far

548
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:03,519
was the

549
00:30:00,440 --> 00:30:07,840
superior cultivar that we tested and we

550
00:30:03,519 --> 00:30:10,880
tried to find every cultivar around um

551
00:30:07,840 --> 00:30:16,320
that was available in the US through

552
00:30:10,880 --> 00:30:20,000
numerous uh uh Garden Supply cataloges

553
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:22,320
and so um so German white appeared to be

554
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:25,399
the most adapted to the North Dakota

555
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:30,039
environmental conditions well um there

556
00:30:25,399 --> 00:30:32,480
was two that um were the least and were

557
00:30:30,039 --> 00:30:35,279
would not be worth the time to go and

558
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:37,679
put into your

559
00:30:35,279 --> 00:30:40,240
garden okay so now we're going to go and

560
00:30:37,679 --> 00:30:42,279
move on to onion basics in a little bit

561
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:48,200
I'm going to probably have to hurry up

562
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:50,760
on this with onions um so Garlic's a

563
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:53,720
perennial and if you didn't go and

564
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:58,880
harvest your garlic it would come up

565
00:30:53,720 --> 00:31:02,080
again um and but that would would not go

566
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:04,399
and and behoove you to go and and

567
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:09,600
because it's not ornamental looking at

568
00:31:04,399 --> 00:31:11,320
all um a and so uh it also would then

569
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:14,440
that all of those cloves would try to

570
00:31:11,320 --> 00:31:16,960
come in that one Bunch which would also

571
00:31:14,440 --> 00:31:19,360
defeat the purpose of growing garlic but

572
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,720
onions on the other hand they're a

573
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:25,120
banial and so they need two years before

574
00:31:23,720 --> 00:31:27,919
they

575
00:31:25,120 --> 00:31:32,240
flower which is important to know for

576
00:31:27,919 --> 00:31:35,880
for some aspects of why you have

577
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:40,399
flowering um so they also have a these

578
00:31:35,880 --> 00:31:45,039
concentric swollen Leaf bases and that

579
00:31:40,399 --> 00:31:47,720
the the leaves emerge from the center so

580
00:31:45,039 --> 00:31:51,240
the oldest Leaf is here the newest Leaf

581
00:31:47,720 --> 00:31:55,480
is going to come from there and bulbing

582
00:31:51,240 --> 00:31:58,760
is is determined by the photo period and

583
00:31:55,480 --> 00:32:01,240
temperature and that's important because

584
00:31:58,760 --> 00:32:04,080
the bulb size and the rate of bulb

585
00:32:01,240 --> 00:32:07,519
development depends on the size of that

586
00:32:04,080 --> 00:32:10,080
plant when bulbing starts so you have a

587
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:14,440
larger plant when it starts and you have

588
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:17,080
good temperatures um then you'll have um

589
00:32:14,440 --> 00:32:20,720
really a good

590
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:24,399
siiz onion bulb that you will

591
00:32:20,720 --> 00:32:27,440
harvest so some of um a little bit of

592
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:30,240
information on you know these various

593
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,039
veget vegetables that have storage

594
00:32:30,240 --> 00:32:35,320
organs and how they respond to photo

595
00:32:33,039 --> 00:32:37,600
period so we have some that are

596
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:40,360
classified as day neutral they don't

597
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:43,240
care what you know how long a day is or

598
00:32:40,360 --> 00:32:46,720
how short the day is and that's carrots

599
00:32:43,240 --> 00:32:50,480
beets turnips and radishes so they're

600
00:32:46,720 --> 00:32:53,399
classified as day neutral you plant them

601
00:32:50,480 --> 00:32:58,679
and when they get you know as they

602
00:32:53,399 --> 00:33:01,799
mature that storage organ will get

603
00:32:58,679 --> 00:33:06,480
bigger however onions and garlic are

604
00:33:01,799 --> 00:33:09,840
long day and and so they that is

605
00:33:06,480 --> 00:33:12,320
triggered by um their flowering or their

606
00:33:09,840 --> 00:33:15,679
storage their bulbing is actually

607
00:33:12,320 --> 00:33:18,120
triggered by long days there are some

608
00:33:15,679 --> 00:33:20,639
exceptions but it's still considered a

609
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:23,600
long day and I'll talk to you a little

610
00:33:20,639 --> 00:33:28,200
bit about that um on the other hand we

611
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:31,200
have short day um vegetables potato Poes

612
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:33,279
sweet potatoes yams and cassavas that

613
00:33:31,200 --> 00:33:36,600
actually the the

614
00:33:33,279 --> 00:33:41,080
tubers um start to form in response to

615
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:43,639
short days so just a little bit of more

616
00:33:41,080 --> 00:33:46,799
um information than maybe you wanted to

617
00:33:43,639 --> 00:33:48,600
know there are different onion types but

618
00:33:46,799 --> 00:33:50,720
I'm thinking I'm going to run out of

619
00:33:48,600 --> 00:33:55,799
time and so I'm going to kind of just

620
00:33:50,720 --> 00:33:58,559
pass over this um because really

621
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:03,559
um you're going to

622
00:33:58,559 --> 00:34:05,919
order what's available in in a uh or

623
00:34:03,559 --> 00:34:09,119
what's available in the store or through

624
00:34:05,919 --> 00:34:12,760
a catalog and that's already been kind

625
00:34:09,119 --> 00:34:16,800
of um they've kind of tested these

626
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:16,800
cultivars for various

627
00:34:17,399 --> 00:34:23,359
areas other classifications include um

628
00:34:20,919 --> 00:34:25,560
skin color of course you've probably

629
00:34:23,359 --> 00:34:29,359
seen that in the store where you can buy

630
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:32,599
Reds whites or yellow um according to

631
00:34:29,359 --> 00:34:35,879
the mildness or pungent

632
00:34:32,599 --> 00:34:39,480
pungency um the yellows that we are

633
00:34:35,879 --> 00:34:44,280
accustomed to Growing for storage are

634
00:34:39,480 --> 00:34:47,320
much more pungent and um and usually the

635
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:51,000
ones that do not store well are much

636
00:34:47,320 --> 00:34:53,679
more milder in taste um they can be

637
00:34:51,000 --> 00:34:56,480
categorized also according to their

638
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:58,680
shapes now here's where you know I said

639
00:34:56,480 --> 00:35:03,280
they're a long day for that for the

640
00:34:58,680 --> 00:35:05,320
bulbing but within that um they this is

641
00:35:03,280 --> 00:35:08,760
so crazy you know they'll still go and

642
00:35:05,320 --> 00:35:11,320
say you have short day intermediate day

643
00:35:08,760 --> 00:35:13,520
and long days but they're all long days

644
00:35:11,320 --> 00:35:17,720
because you can see um the short day

645
00:35:13,520 --> 00:35:20,800
ones for bulbing is 12 to 13 hours of

646
00:35:17,720 --> 00:35:25,640
day length the intermediate need 13 to

647
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:28,359
14 hours and the long days need 14 to 16

648
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:31,480
hours before they start to

649
00:35:28,359 --> 00:35:36,079
bulb and you um you know those short and

650
00:35:31,480 --> 00:35:37,400
intermediate ones are are really for uh

651
00:35:36,079 --> 00:35:42,520
I I'd

652
00:35:37,400 --> 00:35:46,960
say probably Kansas on down and and the

653
00:35:42,520 --> 00:35:54,040
short ones are texus Florida

654
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:59,640
area Okay sets versus seed you

655
00:35:54,040 --> 00:36:02,720
um really sets have higher Vig ger a and

656
00:35:59,640 --> 00:36:05,240
in especially in less favorable spring

657
00:36:02,720 --> 00:36:09,480
conditions so they're going to take off

658
00:36:05,240 --> 00:36:13,319
quicker um they also provide a more

659
00:36:09,480 --> 00:36:15,760
consistent sta stand establishment but

660
00:36:13,319 --> 00:36:18,880
with that they're you're they're more

661
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:23,400
expensive in comparison to seed if you

662
00:36:18,880 --> 00:36:25,680
bought a dozen sets versus 12 seeds it's

663
00:36:23,400 --> 00:36:28,280
there's quite a difference there uh

664
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,720
another thing about the sets is they're

665
00:36:28,280 --> 00:36:34,359
earlier at maturing and they require a

666
00:36:31,720 --> 00:36:39,119
shorter growing season because with the

667
00:36:34,359 --> 00:36:42,720
sets you generally already have um four

668
00:36:39,119 --> 00:36:46,280
to five leaves in that set and so you

669
00:36:42,720 --> 00:36:48,960
see this picture here and um the sets

670
00:36:46,280 --> 00:36:51,119
you can see are so much further ahead of

671
00:36:48,960 --> 00:36:51,119
the

672
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:58,319
seed in North Dakota um commercially we

673
00:36:57,160 --> 00:37:02,800
generally

674
00:36:58,319 --> 00:37:06,920
uh plant uh just because of the cost of

675
00:37:02,800 --> 00:37:09,200
of the sets and um since I don't think

676
00:37:06,920 --> 00:37:11,880
anyone's going to be doing this and this

677
00:37:09,200 --> 00:37:14,920
is available in the handouts I'm just

678
00:37:11,880 --> 00:37:17,560
going to go and and kind of just go over

679
00:37:14,920 --> 00:37:19,440
um pass through this but you know

680
00:37:17,560 --> 00:37:21,400
Growers that are commercially growing

681
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:23,640
onions they're going to try to plant as

682
00:37:21,400 --> 00:37:26,000
early as possible and they do it in

683
00:37:23,640 --> 00:37:28,839
these double rows as you can see in the

684
00:37:26,000 --> 00:37:31,800
picture because onions they kind of like

685
00:37:28,839 --> 00:37:33,800
to be by each other and do much better

686
00:37:31,800 --> 00:37:35,800
and they're really wimpy getting out of

687
00:37:33,800 --> 00:37:37,520
out of the ground so they need as much

688
00:37:35,800 --> 00:37:41,680
help as

689
00:37:37,520 --> 00:37:45,119
possible um some will do transplants but

690
00:37:41,680 --> 00:37:47,680
to go and get um put through transplants

691
00:37:45,119 --> 00:37:51,440
you need to start those 8 to nine weeks

692
00:37:47,680 --> 00:37:56,480
in a greenhouse or indoor with adequate

693
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:58,079
lighting um and you have to really um be

694
00:37:56,480 --> 00:38:01,560
careful that you don't

695
00:37:58,079 --> 00:38:06,079
um have any vernalization occur and

696
00:38:01,560 --> 00:38:08,200
that's also true with those sets uh the

697
00:38:06,079 --> 00:38:11,280
and I think I I'll go over that in a

698
00:38:08,200 --> 00:38:15,040
little bit the sets are next Um this can

699
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:18,800
be costly at one time the

700
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:21,720
Growers uh were the there are some

701
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:23,800
Growers that use actually transplants

702
00:38:21,720 --> 00:38:25,520
because you have they're already growing

703
00:38:23,800 --> 00:38:28,480
some other vegetables and they have a

704
00:38:25,520 --> 00:38:31,800
vegetable transplanter and so this works

705
00:38:28,480 --> 00:38:34,800
out quite well this also goes and gets

706
00:38:31,800 --> 00:38:37,800
them a a very early

707
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:42,640
Market um because the transplants will

708
00:38:37,800 --> 00:38:45,839
be um just as early as sets so they you

709
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:49,400
can get an earlier market and thus um

710
00:38:45,839 --> 00:38:52,480
get a better price or they'll do it for

711
00:38:49,400 --> 00:38:55,880
those late maturing Spanish types in

712
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:58,160
more of these uh more northern

713
00:38:55,880 --> 00:39:01,160
states as far as

714
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,560
sets if you're going to um use sets you

715
00:39:01,160 --> 00:39:05,400
want to have them be less than a half

716
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:09,680
inch in

717
00:39:05,400 --> 00:39:12,800
diameter uh if you happen to go and have

718
00:39:09,680 --> 00:39:15,160
a few of those that are larger usually

719
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:17,680
what they're what you can do is just use

720
00:39:15,160 --> 00:39:20,960
those for green onions and the reason

721
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:23,119
I'm saying this is because um if they're

722
00:39:20,960 --> 00:39:27,560
larger than that/ inch

723
00:39:23,119 --> 00:39:30,720
diameter they've been put into a cooler

724
00:39:27,560 --> 00:39:35,240
and ship to wherever for these garden

725
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:38,319
centers or box stores to go and sell and

726
00:39:35,240 --> 00:39:41,480
if they have if they're larger than that

727
00:39:38,319 --> 00:39:44,760
half inch diameter they probably have

728
00:39:41,480 --> 00:39:45,680
gone through the juvenile stage and thus

729
00:39:44,760 --> 00:39:49,560
can be

730
00:39:45,680 --> 00:39:52,760
vernalized to think they should flour so

731
00:39:49,560 --> 00:39:57,400
those larger ones are going to probably

732
00:39:52,760 --> 00:40:00,920
uh go and flower on you which is

733
00:39:57,400 --> 00:40:00,920
something that you don't want with

734
00:40:01,040 --> 00:40:06,760
onion so

735
00:40:03,319 --> 00:40:07,680
spacing um we kind of talked about that

736
00:40:06,760 --> 00:40:12,640
weed

737
00:40:07,680 --> 00:40:15,440
control uh in commercial it's um very

738
00:40:12,640 --> 00:40:18,280
rigorous onion are just like garlic

739
00:40:15,440 --> 00:40:21,520
they're just don't ever canopy so weed

740
00:40:18,280 --> 00:40:24,599
control is really really important but

741
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:27,440
you know all the aliums have a very

742
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:30,200
fibrous shallow root system so you you

743
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:32,800
have to really be careful um so if

744
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:35,800
you're pulling weeds you don't allow

745
00:40:32,800 --> 00:40:38,400
those weeds to get really really large

746
00:40:35,800 --> 00:40:42,079
because you'll if that are growing next

747
00:40:38,400 --> 00:40:45,760
to the um onions because that will

748
00:40:42,079 --> 00:40:47,720
actually um go and cause some injury and

749
00:40:45,760 --> 00:40:52,200
they may just kind of stop their growth

750
00:40:47,720 --> 00:40:55,839
for a while uh which know in our short

751
00:40:52,200 --> 00:41:00,000
growing season is is important not to

752
00:40:55,839 --> 00:41:03,319
have anything that uh slows things

753
00:41:00,000 --> 00:41:06,920
down um so watering you can see what

754
00:41:03,319 --> 00:41:11,040
that is fertility again just kind of

755
00:41:06,920 --> 00:41:14,160
like um The Garlic you want to more

756
00:41:11,040 --> 00:41:17,800
spoon feed the nitrogen you don't want

757
00:41:14,160 --> 00:41:23,079
to go and give too much up front and you

758
00:41:17,800 --> 00:41:27,319
don't want to go too long um with um

759
00:41:23,079 --> 00:41:31,000
fertilizing uh the the onion either uh

760
00:41:27,319 --> 00:41:34,000
generally you want to stop by July uh in

761
00:41:31,000 --> 00:41:39,119
your fertilization because if you go

762
00:41:34,000 --> 00:41:41,560
much uh go past you know into August um

763
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,839
then you end up with onions that have

764
00:41:41,560 --> 00:41:48,359
really thick necks

765
00:41:43,839 --> 00:41:51,319
and those tend to be soft when they cure

766
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:52,720
and you end to end up getting a lot of

767
00:41:51,319 --> 00:41:56,000
disease

768
00:41:52,720 --> 00:42:00,200
problems with that bulb rots because of

769
00:41:56,000 --> 00:42:04,000
that large neck that stays soft

770
00:42:00,200 --> 00:42:07,200
longer okay so we kind of talked about

771
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:11,480
um bulbing uh and I think I mentioned

772
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:15,319
that um it's controlled in onions um by

773
00:42:11,480 --> 00:42:19,119
that long day so location is important I

774
00:42:15,319 --> 00:42:23,839
said it was um day length and

775
00:42:19,119 --> 00:42:27,280
temperature so this is why um it's

776
00:42:23,839 --> 00:42:32,559
really important that we have the right

777
00:42:27,280 --> 00:42:37,680
kinds of cultivars those long day ones

778
00:42:32,559 --> 00:42:42,200
um anything really above uh

779
00:42:37,680 --> 00:42:44,359
Kansas this would be for long day um

780
00:42:42,200 --> 00:42:45,839
when we're going through that just

781
00:42:44,359 --> 00:42:48,880
because of the

782
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:51,040
daylength and so here's a little uh

783
00:42:48,880 --> 00:42:53,480
table that kind of talks about you know

784
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,680
how our days get

785
00:42:53,480 --> 00:43:02,079
longer and you can see here by

786
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:05,400
um June 7th we have you know we're

787
00:43:02,079 --> 00:43:09,359
almost to 16 hours so if we didn't go

788
00:43:05,400 --> 00:43:12,200
and plant if we were going to go by seed

789
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:14,880
um and we didn't get that planted until

790
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:18,319
May you know they'd come up and they'd

791
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:20,520
almost by that time be triggered into

792
00:43:18,319 --> 00:43:23,760
wanting to bulb and they wouldn't have

793
00:43:20,520 --> 00:43:26,599
hardly any they'd have just two leaves

794
00:43:23,760 --> 00:43:28,760
um and thus we'd end up with very small

795
00:43:26,599 --> 00:43:31,400
diameter

796
00:43:28,760 --> 00:43:35,720
onions here's another way of looking at

797
00:43:31,400 --> 00:43:39,000
it um so here's our day daylight and

798
00:43:35,720 --> 00:43:41,200
then we have uh our Dawn and here's our

799
00:43:39,000 --> 00:43:43,520
Dusk and you can see how that changes

800
00:43:41,200 --> 00:43:47,200
then when we get for daylight savings

801
00:43:43,520 --> 00:43:52,200
time and then in the fall again but you

802
00:43:47,200 --> 00:43:56,599
know June 20th then is our longest day H

803
00:43:52,200 --> 00:44:00,079
where we have day length from um almost

804
00:43:56,599 --> 00:44:05,559
5:00 in the morning to

805
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:08,599
10:00 um at night so this is uh why I

806
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:12,280
feel June is just the most fabulous

807
00:44:08,599 --> 00:44:15,359
month in the year in North Dakota oops

808
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:17,559
okay getting almost oh I got to hurry so

809
00:44:15,359 --> 00:44:20,040
why do my onions flour I think I've

810
00:44:17,559 --> 00:44:24,720
talked about this um

811
00:44:20,040 --> 00:44:27,280
repeatedly uh and so um I'm going to go

812
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:31,000
on to leaks because I only have a few

813
00:44:27,280 --> 00:44:33,720
more three more slides so growing leaks

814
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:37,319
it really they're really pretty easy uh

815
00:44:33,720 --> 00:44:41,160
but they need a rather a real long time

816
00:44:37,319 --> 00:44:45,200
to to mature um they're rather slow

817
00:44:41,160 --> 00:44:48,599
growing and and so um most leaks need

818
00:44:45,200 --> 00:44:51,920
120 to 150 days so you need to start

819
00:44:48,599 --> 00:44:55,480
them from seed indoors and then you

820
00:44:51,920 --> 00:44:58,520
transplant them early spring you can to

821
00:44:55,480 --> 00:45:02,119
go and you really want to to have this

822
00:44:58,520 --> 00:45:05,119
stock long and white this one's not

823
00:45:02,119 --> 00:45:07,680
really quite there I I mean they didn't

824
00:45:05,119 --> 00:45:10,880
have uh they didn't have these buried

825
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:14,119
very long to do that you can either go

826
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:17,480
and throw keep throwing soil up or you

827
00:45:14,119 --> 00:45:21,880
can plant them in a furl and then slowly

828
00:45:17,480 --> 00:45:25,240
fill in as that plant grows larger and

829
00:45:21,880 --> 00:45:27,880
larger um they the water is about the

830
00:45:25,240 --> 00:45:31,280
same as onion and garlic

831
00:45:27,880 --> 00:45:35,720
uh but they can Toler and actually onion

832
00:45:31,280 --> 00:45:41,760
and garlic can tolerate cold too

833
00:45:35,720 --> 00:45:45,760
um the problem is is um that you

834
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:49,119
know what you can go what happens here

835
00:45:45,760 --> 00:45:52,760
is now different because you have this

836
00:45:49,119 --> 00:45:56,480
bulb only in onion and garlic you're you

837
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:59,960
know you harvest end of July first part

838
00:45:56,480 --> 00:46:02,800
of August so I mean you can't even get

839
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:06,200
to the cold temperatures there but with

840
00:46:02,800 --> 00:46:08,960
leaks because they're tolerant of cold

841
00:46:06,200 --> 00:46:12,440
you can actually let them and delay your

842
00:46:08,960 --> 00:46:15,400
Harvest or maybe just pick them as you

843
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:17,000
need them um after that first Frost

844
00:46:15,400 --> 00:46:19,119
because a lot of times here in North

845
00:46:17,000 --> 00:46:21,400
Dakota we'll get that first Frost and

846
00:46:19,119 --> 00:46:24,359
then we have a month of really rather

847
00:46:21,400 --> 00:46:26,920
nice weather so the fact that they can

848
00:46:24,359 --> 00:46:29,599
tolerate that cold you can have fresh

849
00:46:26,920 --> 00:46:32,920
leaks for quite some time after that

850
00:46:29,599 --> 00:46:35,800
first Frost so start them indoors

851
00:46:32,920 --> 00:46:38,920
February March you transplant them when

852
00:46:35,800 --> 00:46:41,280
they're 10 to 15 weeks old you don't

853
00:46:38,920 --> 00:46:43,520
want to wait too much uh longer than

854
00:46:41,280 --> 00:46:45,960
that because then um they'll go through

855
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:49,240
some kind of transplant shock and if you

856
00:46:45,960 --> 00:46:51,599
go less than 10 weeks old um they're

857
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:55,280
just going to be so small very difficult

858
00:46:51,599 --> 00:46:58,000
to handle before you transplant them you

859
00:46:55,280 --> 00:47:00,520
want to acclimate them to the outside so

860
00:46:58,000 --> 00:47:02,960
about a week where you have them in kind

861
00:47:00,520 --> 00:47:04,760
of a protected area where they aren't

862
00:47:02,960 --> 00:47:08,079
just getting wind whipped all over the

863
00:47:04,760 --> 00:47:08,760
place but they're starting to adjust to

864
00:47:08,079 --> 00:47:13,839
the

865
00:47:08,760 --> 00:47:17,680
outdoor breezes more and um a lot more

866
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:21,480
sunlight so acclimate them for about a

867
00:47:17,680 --> 00:47:24,480
week and then when we have um average

868
00:47:21,480 --> 00:47:27,440
daytime temperature of 45 degrees or

869
00:47:24,480 --> 00:47:30,800
above you can go and Transplant them

870
00:47:27,440 --> 00:47:34,240
um and I think you know you need you

871
00:47:30,800 --> 00:47:37,240
can't because two weeks ago we had above

872
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:40,280
45 for a few days you just don't go and

873
00:47:37,240 --> 00:47:42,160
do that um in North Dakota because all

874
00:47:40,280 --> 00:47:45,000
of a sudden we can have a blizzard again

875
00:47:42,160 --> 00:47:49,079
and so you know you want to wait until

876
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:51,880
uh 30-year average is above 45° for your

877
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:56,359
location planting pretty much the same

878
00:47:51,880 --> 00:47:59,359
as uh the others and we fertilize so

879
00:47:56,359 --> 00:48:02,359
depending on on the cultivar you can

880
00:47:59,359 --> 00:48:05,359
have some shorter ones that are mature

881
00:48:02,359 --> 00:48:08,720
when that stem diameter the stem

882
00:48:05,359 --> 00:48:10,480
diameter is a half an inch and the

883
00:48:08,720 --> 00:48:12,680
larger ones you want to wait until

884
00:48:10,480 --> 00:48:16,839
that's about an inch in

885
00:48:12,680 --> 00:48:19,559
diameter and then you again I would dig

886
00:48:16,839 --> 00:48:22,480
these uh instead of trying to pull

887
00:48:19,559 --> 00:48:26,240
because they have quite a root system

888
00:48:22,480 --> 00:48:29,280
and I just pulling many times you're

889
00:48:26,240 --> 00:48:31,920
just going to pull off that bottom part

890
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:34,599
so um one other thing is try to

891
00:48:31,920 --> 00:48:37,760
thoroughly clean before you use because

892
00:48:34,599 --> 00:48:40,200
know if you're filling that soil in from

893
00:48:37,760 --> 00:48:43,040
that furl you might get some soil down

894
00:48:40,200 --> 00:48:47,400
into those leaves and you can eat both

895
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:50,160
the green leaves and this white stem

896
00:48:47,400 --> 00:48:54,680
that had turns white because of the soil

897
00:48:50,160 --> 00:48:58,559
around it and so with that uh just a

898
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,160
little bit over sorry Julie that's great

899
00:48:58,559 --> 00:49:02,720
well thank you so much we have a number

900
00:49:00,160 --> 00:49:06,119
of questions so I'll quickly go through

901
00:49:02,720 --> 00:49:08,160
these um first two questions one's about

902
00:49:06,119 --> 00:49:11,440
hard neck and the other's about soft

903
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:14,520
neck so why are hard neck varieties of

904
00:49:11,440 --> 00:49:18,480
garlic best in North

905
00:49:14,520 --> 00:49:23,119
Dakota um I I think they're they're

906
00:49:18,480 --> 00:49:27,440
harder so they you know with that straw

907
00:49:23,119 --> 00:49:30,400
covering they just uh do better

908
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:32,440
and then we have a question asking about

909
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:36,880
southern varieties I'll call them Zone

910
00:49:32,440 --> 00:49:41,040
Seven are soft neck varieties of garlic

911
00:49:36,880 --> 00:49:44,920
better for I guess warmer

912
00:49:41,040 --> 00:49:48,200
climates probably um they they actually

913
00:49:44,920 --> 00:49:51,480
store a lot longer than hard neck so if

914
00:49:48,200 --> 00:49:51,480
you can

915
00:49:51,960 --> 00:50:00,520
um see and that also depends so soft

916
00:49:56,319 --> 00:50:03,359
neck have more cloves in a bulb than

917
00:50:00,520 --> 00:50:05,799
hard necks so if you want you know if

918
00:50:03,359 --> 00:50:09,480
you're in zone seven I would think maybe

919
00:50:05,799 --> 00:50:12,640
you would go with the Elephant Garlic

920
00:50:09,480 --> 00:50:16,280
um also

921
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:18,720
I uh soft neck are a little bit more

922
00:50:16,280 --> 00:50:24,160
milder than the hard

923
00:50:18,720 --> 00:50:26,720
necks but um but I I don't I've never

924
00:50:24,160 --> 00:50:31,160
lived well no I have never lived in zone

925
00:50:26,720 --> 00:50:33,640
s so I better not better not go and um

926
00:50:31,160 --> 00:50:36,839
talk to somebody who's an extension

927
00:50:33,640 --> 00:50:38,400
specialist in zone seven I'd say that's

928
00:50:36,839 --> 00:50:41,240
a that's a good

929
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:44,079
answer uh what could you expect if you

930
00:50:41,240 --> 00:50:48,960
plant garlic in the

931
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:53,400
spring okay so there are places that

932
00:50:48,960 --> 00:50:56,119
planted in the spring but um the fact

933
00:50:53,400 --> 00:50:58,319
that it doesn't you're going to have to

934
00:50:56,119 --> 00:51:01,440
give it you know they require those

935
00:50:58,319 --> 00:51:03,680
chill weeks so you're going to have it

936
00:51:01,440 --> 00:51:06,720
in your refrigerator so it accumulates

937
00:51:03,680 --> 00:51:11,040
those chills and and then they just

938
00:51:06,720 --> 00:51:15,280
never get as big so if you want larger

939
00:51:11,040 --> 00:51:19,720
bulbs then plant them in the

940
00:51:15,280 --> 00:51:22,200
fall uh couple of questions about Scapes

941
00:51:19,720 --> 00:51:25,960
how do you remove the Scapes do you cut

942
00:51:22,200 --> 00:51:29,520
them off yes just cut them off and make

943
00:51:25,960 --> 00:51:34,000
sure you cut them off before that um you

944
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:36,160
can see the flower it's a little H it's

945
00:51:34,000 --> 00:51:38,040
like a candy kiss you want to get it

946
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:41,319
before it gets much bigger and

947
00:51:38,040 --> 00:51:43,440
definitely before it opens um to go I

948
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:45,599
could have darn it I should have put a

949
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:48,760
picture of that I could have done that I

950
00:51:45,599 --> 00:51:51,520
never thought about that so and then a

951
00:51:48,760 --> 00:51:53,720
question about garlic leaves versus

952
00:51:51,520 --> 00:51:57,599
Garlic

953
00:51:53,720 --> 00:51:59,240
Scapes okay what's the difference

954
00:51:57,599 --> 00:52:03,240
um the scape will

955
00:51:59,240 --> 00:52:06,400
be round and the leaves are more

956
00:52:03,240 --> 00:52:09,440
flattened Hollow flattened

957
00:52:06,400 --> 00:52:11,400
leaves um and it will come up through

958
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:16,400
the

959
00:52:11,400 --> 00:52:19,240
center and and so um it'll be and then

960
00:52:16,400 --> 00:52:22,720
it'll start to form what is that flower

961
00:52:19,240 --> 00:52:25,119
head and when that starts to form that's

962
00:52:22,720 --> 00:52:29,200
when you can cut it off and you'll just

963
00:52:25,119 --> 00:52:34,119
cut it as close to the uh plant as

964
00:52:29,200 --> 00:52:36,599
possible to the bottom to of the plant

965
00:52:34,119 --> 00:52:39,280
and I I will tell everyone that on our

966
00:52:36,599 --> 00:52:42,760
field of fork resources page if you go

967
00:52:39,280 --> 00:52:45,319
to garlic we have a garlic from garden

968
00:52:42,760 --> 00:52:49,000
to table that was first written by a

969
00:52:45,319 --> 00:52:50,799
previous horiculture specialist in me so

970
00:52:49,000 --> 00:52:52,520
you can also check that we have a lot of

971
00:52:50,799 --> 00:52:55,920
recipes there

972
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:58,079
too um here's another question I want to

973
00:52:55,920 --> 00:53:01,280
leave garlic in the ground around my

974
00:52:58,079 --> 00:53:01,280
property will it

975
00:53:03,920 --> 00:53:10,760
naturalize you know I suppose but it's

976
00:53:07,400 --> 00:53:14,359
going to be these little clumps

977
00:53:10,760 --> 00:53:17,400
and then if you if you want something

978
00:53:14,359 --> 00:53:18,760
like that then go with the garlic chives

979
00:53:17,400 --> 00:53:22,880
herbaceous

980
00:53:18,760 --> 00:53:25,160
ornamental uh because they they're very

981
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:29,200
naturalized they're an herbaceous

982
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:31,960
ornamental uh and much more set up to I

983
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:35,799
mean they actually have a a really

984
00:53:31,960 --> 00:53:38,839
unique pretty humble flower so yeah I

985
00:53:35,799 --> 00:53:42,200
would go with ornamental onions or

986
00:53:38,839 --> 00:53:46,200
ornamental chives or garlic chives

987
00:53:42,200 --> 00:53:50,000
they're have different names like that

988
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:52,000
um common names but they aliums that are

989
00:53:50,000 --> 00:53:56,720
herbaceous ornamentals that are much

990
00:53:52,000 --> 00:54:01,240
more naturalized for a situation

991
00:53:56,720 --> 00:54:03,680
very good um the next person asks why

992
00:54:01,240 --> 00:54:05,920
people would want to grow

993
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:07,760
shallots that was the fourth one I

994
00:54:05,920 --> 00:54:13,160
couldn't think of thank you for coming

995
00:54:07,760 --> 00:54:15,359
up with shallot um and they're they're a

996
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:19,760
m a much more

997
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:23,880
milder um onion and they can be

998
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:26,520
grown uh but we haven't been able to

999
00:54:23,880 --> 00:54:31,000
there was only one of the four cultivars

1000
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:34,240
that cidra um used that actually had a

1001
00:54:31,000 --> 00:54:37,440
sizable they're much smaller but you

1002
00:54:34,240 --> 00:54:39,799
know some recipes just call for shallots

1003
00:54:37,440 --> 00:54:44,079
because they want that much more milder

1004
00:54:39,799 --> 00:54:47,280
they don't want that pungency of of the

1005
00:54:44,079 --> 00:54:49,720
onion uh next question when do you pick

1006
00:54:47,280 --> 00:54:49,720
winter

1007
00:54:51,920 --> 00:54:57,720
onions I'm not really too familiar with

1008
00:54:55,280 --> 00:55:01,400
winter onions

1009
00:54:57,720 --> 00:55:04,440
and so that's okay we can go on to the

1010
00:55:01,400 --> 00:55:07,520
next one that's a question for your

1011
00:55:04,440 --> 00:55:11,200
local horiculture specialist if you're

1012
00:55:07,520 --> 00:55:14,680
from another state uh if leaks are

1013
00:55:11,200 --> 00:55:16,880
planted two to six inches apart in a row

1014
00:55:14,680 --> 00:55:20,079
can you not have the row six inches

1015
00:55:16,880 --> 00:55:22,839
apart I'm working in raised beds and

1016
00:55:20,079 --> 00:55:27,520
it's the same true for garlic and

1017
00:55:22,839 --> 00:55:31,799
onions so the difficulty with a raised

1018
00:55:27,520 --> 00:55:35,760
bed you know so when with leaks you know

1019
00:55:31,799 --> 00:55:39,440
you want to you want to have that stock

1020
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:43,200
that is white so you keep throwing soil

1021
00:55:39,440 --> 00:55:46,000
what we did was we made furls and if

1022
00:55:43,200 --> 00:55:48,640
it's really if you have six inch rows

1023
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:52,400
where you going to put that soil for

1024
00:55:48,640 --> 00:55:55,160
your furls to go and slowly fill it in

1025
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:58,799
we had these Mounds on each side of the

1026
00:55:55,160 --> 00:56:01,200
row that we then slowly filled it in to

1027
00:55:58,799 --> 00:56:07,280
go and get you know you're hoping to get

1028
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:09,880
68 Ines of of soil covering that so

1029
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:12,440
that's the whole part with leaks that

1030
00:56:09,880 --> 00:56:17,039
would make uh in a raised bed having

1031
00:56:12,440 --> 00:56:20,200
them so close together is unless you you

1032
00:56:17,039 --> 00:56:22,760
know didn't care to have that much white

1033
00:56:20,200 --> 00:56:26,079
and you want it to just have lot more

1034
00:56:22,760 --> 00:56:29,280
green leaves um if you don't go and put

1035
00:56:26,079 --> 00:56:32,039
that soil there then you know your Leaf

1036
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:34,119
your Leaf base is going to be right

1037
00:56:32,039 --> 00:56:36,160
close to the you're not going to get

1038
00:56:34,119 --> 00:56:41,680
much of the bulb

1039
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:44,200
part with it but with um onions you know

1040
00:56:41,680 --> 00:56:49,119
we generally put them about 4 Ines apart

1041
00:56:44,200 --> 00:56:51,480
because we're trying our aim is a 4 in

1042
00:56:49,119 --> 00:56:54,559
diameter onion so if you have them

1043
00:56:51,480 --> 00:56:59,079
closer together then they're going to

1044
00:56:54,559 --> 00:57:02,359
start to compete and can actually um

1045
00:56:59,079 --> 00:57:06,720
cause some deformity in the shape of the

1046
00:57:02,359 --> 00:57:10,960
bulb let alone um probably compete more

1047
00:57:06,720 --> 00:57:12,480
for nutrients and and water as

1048
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:15,760
well

1049
00:57:12,480 --> 00:57:18,480
so next question what are some common

1050
00:57:15,760 --> 00:57:20,280
insect pests that will feed on onions in

1051
00:57:18,480 --> 00:57:24,200
a hom Garden

1052
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:27,160
setting well there is the onion maggot

1053
00:57:24,200 --> 00:57:30,240
that will affect the

1054
00:57:27,160 --> 00:57:32,880
seed and and that's the

1055
00:57:30,240 --> 00:57:39,200
biggest I guess

1056
00:57:32,880 --> 00:57:39,200
insect um that is a problem um

1057
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:45,160
otherwise there you know you don't have

1058
00:57:42,920 --> 00:57:46,480
caterpillars or anything like that

1059
00:57:45,160 --> 00:57:51,880
chomping on

1060
00:57:46,480 --> 00:57:55,920
them uh but um yeah the and but there

1061
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:57,119
are some Leaf spots and then of course

1062
00:57:55,920 --> 00:58:00,359
um some

1063
00:57:57,119 --> 00:58:02,640
bacteria that if you have bruising that

1064
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:05,839
can cause problems but you know the

1065
00:58:02,640 --> 00:58:09,039
biggest problem is you know if you

1066
00:58:05,839 --> 00:58:11,079
fertilize too much and you get those

1067
00:58:09,039 --> 00:58:13,720
with onions especially you get those

1068
00:58:11,079 --> 00:58:17,000
larger necks that stay soft and they

1069
00:58:13,720 --> 00:58:20,400
don't dry down so fast then you have a

1070
00:58:17,000 --> 00:58:23,440
various fungi that get in and start

1071
00:58:20,400 --> 00:58:25,640
causing neck rot

1072
00:58:23,440 --> 00:58:29,240
problems all right so we'll take two

1073
00:58:25,640 --> 00:58:30,799
more questions here can you eat onions

1074
00:58:29,240 --> 00:58:34,640
that have

1075
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:39,079
flowered oh yes you can you can eat them

1076
00:58:34,640 --> 00:58:41,960
um it's just you know that plant when

1077
00:58:39,079 --> 00:58:44,760
it's flowering it's diverting a lot of

1078
00:58:41,960 --> 00:58:46,799
those um carbohydrates that it's

1079
00:58:44,760 --> 00:58:49,359
producing from

1080
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:51,680
photosynthesis to that flour so your

1081
00:58:49,359 --> 00:58:56,720
bulb's going to be smaller and it's not

1082
00:58:51,680 --> 00:58:58,839
going to store very long so

1083
00:58:56,720 --> 00:59:02,720
all right so last question we'll take

1084
00:58:58,839 --> 00:59:05,880
for today uh can you eat garlic chives

1085
00:59:02,720 --> 00:59:08,359
they're not just ornamental

1086
00:59:05,880 --> 00:59:14,160
right um

1087
00:59:08,359 --> 00:59:16,240
so I've never I well I I suppose

1088
00:59:14,160 --> 00:59:21,920
anything could be edible unless it's

1089
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:25,280
poisonous correct you but um garlic

1090
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:26,599
chives versus chives now see there's

1091
00:59:25,280 --> 00:59:30,079
chives

1092
00:59:26,599 --> 00:59:34,720
which you would eat the the hollow

1093
00:59:30,079 --> 00:59:37,599
leaves and um and then garlic chives is

1094
00:59:34,720 --> 00:59:43,839
just the ornamental aliam

1095
00:59:37,599 --> 00:59:48,680
species um and it got that common name

1096
00:59:43,839 --> 00:59:51,720
because the leaves are flat like garlic

1097
00:59:48,680 --> 00:59:56,200
um but it's a different species and

1098
00:59:51,720 --> 00:59:58,440
it it never hoods cloves it just stays

1099
00:59:56,200 --> 01:00:03,640
as like a little green

1100
00:59:58,440 --> 01:00:07,000
onion so um I've never eaten them I've

1101
01:00:03,640 --> 01:00:10,520
never had the desire but I don't you

1102
01:00:07,000 --> 01:00:12,599
know I would stick with the the known

1103
01:00:10,520 --> 01:00:13,960
stuff I'm sure you could eat them but I

1104
01:00:12,599 --> 01:00:18,000
don't think there's going to be much

1105
01:00:13,960 --> 01:00:20,440
flavor to them okay well that's all the

1106
01:00:18,000 --> 01:00:23,160
