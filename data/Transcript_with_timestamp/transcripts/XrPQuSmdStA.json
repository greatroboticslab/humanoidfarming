So from 90% farmers, the number dropped to 80%. And suddenly 10% of the population was free to do other work. that freed up labor made it possible for cities to grow, for grand churches to rise, and for a clerical class to form. Without a solid food base like the grain supplies that once made Egypt the bread basket of the Roman Empire, there would have been no way to support armies or complex governments. The figure of 90% highlights just how important the farming class was in the Middle Ages. They fed the entire social system and kept the wheels of progress turning. But the farmers weren't all the same. Among them were tenant farmers who worked their own plots, surfs who were mostly unfree and worked on a lord's estate, day laborers without land of their own, and cottages who had only a small house and perhaps a garden but no fields. In the high middle ages, the idea of a three-part society took shape. Those who pray, the clergy, those who fight, the nobles and knights, and those who work, the farmers. Over time, this system became more fixed. Though in the early Middle Ages, it had been less clearly defined. The first written records of this social division come from the early 11th century. They described three social groups and placed farmers at the bottom since their work fed and supported the rest of society. Roman traditions played a key role in shaping the status of farmers. In the Roman system, large estates in places like Egypt or Italy ran mainly on slave labor. But as Europe moved from late antiquity into the early medieval period, the big waves of migration stopped. Germanic tribes settled down, taking up farming and hering. With this settled life came a bond to the land. A farmer could no longer leave his plot without violating his duties to the landowner. The farmer's role as a warrior began to fade. Only in rare cases were free farmers still called up as soldiers. Interestingly, there were no permanent villages in the early Middle Ages, at least not as we know them today. People often lived on designated estate farms or in very small temporary settlements. After about 40 years, these settlements were usually abandoned because the intensely worked soil became exhausted. Although the three field system where onethird of the land layow each year was known as early as the 9th century, it wasn't widely practiced for a long time largely due to limited access to fertilizer. When a field became worn out, it was simply used as pasture. And when even that no longer worked, the settlement had to move. So the kind of permanent village we are familiar with today barely existed back then. One remarkable constant however was the burial ground. Cemeteries always lay outside the living area but over time they often became surrounded by new houses. Another reason why permanent villages emerged only later was technological limitation. In the early Middle Ages, the most common plow was the light scratch plow, which only worked the soil surface and was poorly suited to the wet, low-lying soils found in regions like the Rhineland or along the Ela. Adding to the challenge, draft animals often didn't wear horseshoes, making them ineffective on soft or marshy ground. It wasn't until the high middle ages that people began draining many bogs and wetlands through ditches and channels, making them fit for farming. Gradually, they reclaimed new land by draining wetlands, cutting down forests, and turning wild spaces into farmland. Often, these were areas without any Roman past. No old roads, no aqueducts, no towns. Step by step, a new farming world took shape. In the early Middle Ages, land ownership was split mainly between kings, counts, who acted as representatives of the ruling powers over a fragmented landscape, and monasteries, which also served as landlords. A traveling king had no unified territory. His royal estates were scattered across the realm. He would move from one estate to another with his court and officials, collecting tithes and military service along the way. At this stage, the noble line wasn't firmly established yet, and property often came through inheritance or marriage connections. The core of the economic system back then was the so-called Salhof, Terra Salica. This referred to the lord's personal land worked directly by unfree peasants. Servy alongside these lands there were semif-free farms where peasant families sometimes under the supervision of an appointed overseer worked their own plots. They paid dues often in the form of goods like grain, livestock or wine and sometimes through services like military duties. This system was seen as an improvement over the ancient Roman slave model because these peasants, whether semifree or unfree, had at least some level of self-sufficiency. The lord didn't need centralized slave barracks. Instead, he benefited from regular dues while investing as little effort as possible in feeding his workforce. Once the lord had supplies, whether meat from a butcher, bread from a bakery, or wine from his seller, he could redistribute them across his network of estates. This created domini or holdings that ran on minimal fixed costs. At the center of it all was the hoof, the basic unit of farmland. It wasn't a fixed size. It was just about how much land two oxmen could plow in a day. But this amount changed a lot depending on the local soil and customs. In the north, a hoof was usually smaller than in the south. You can think of a hoof kind of like the old Morgan, meaning the land a team of oxen could plow in a morning, but there was no exact standard. Over time, more and more resources were attached to the Salhof. Mills, ins, bake houses, and wine presses increasingly came under direct noble control. This arrangement lasted well into the late Middle Ages because as some lordships grew larger, entire local economies became effectively nationalized. Legal authority also gradually shifted to the landlords. In the early Middle Ages, there were still counts appointed specifically for judicial matters, but little by little, landlords absorbed these powers. This deepened the farmer's dependency. Anyone seeking protection from a powerful ruler had to become a subject. For some unfree peasants, however, this was actually an opportunity. Under the protection of a mighty noble or a wealthy monastery, they could sometimes secure a better position than if they were left exposed in lawless, dangerous regions. Chapter 2. Agricultural Revolution and Social Differentiation in the High Middle Ages. In the High Middle Ages, Europe saw what can only be called a population boom. New farming methods, technical progress, and the rise of organized village communities meant that the nobility gradually stepped back from owning individual farms. Instead of managing the land themselves, they handed it over as mer or ding farms to largecale farmers who worked the fields on their behalf. The rest of the peasants were mostly seen as independent entrepreneurs, but they still owed taxes and labor services, especially so-called frondinster. These included manual labor and span services where a peasant had to provide his horses or oxen for mandatory transport duties. In many regions, such obligations continued all the way into the early 17th century. At the same time, villages became more permanent with cooperative self-governance emerging. In many places, peasants jointly manage the use of fields, farming schedules, and the taxes owed to their lord. Froinster or labor obligations often meant that a peasant with his own team of horses or oxen had to help haul goods for the lord. Meanwhile, a peasant without a team owning only a small plot might be required to give more manual labor because he couldn't pay in kind. Alongside these social shifts, the three field system spread widely. Onethird of a village's land was sewn with summer grain like oats or barley. Another third with winter grain like wheat or rye and the final third was left or used as pasture so the soil could recover. This crop rotation led to a huge increase in yields. Compared to the early middle ages, farmers now often harvested double or even triple the previous amount per acre. Fertilization became more effective, too. Stable manure and ashes from slash and burn clearing briefly enriched soils. But the real driver behind this agricultural revolution was technological progress. The heavy plow known from ancient sources spread through central Europe starting in the 10th century. Its unique feature was the mold board which didn't just break the ground but fully turned it over. This made it possible to farm heavy wet lowland soils. Places like the elber lowlands or the rin area. Horses became the main draft animals supported by a new type of harness, the horse collar, which let them pull much more efficiently. A single horse could now pull the same as a pair of oxmen, but faster and with greater endurance. Iron tools also emerged, including sidesthes, sickles, spades, and harrows, stronger and more efficient than the old wooden tools. With all these advances, agricultural yields soared and Europe's population roughly tripled between the 11th and 13th centuries. This led to massive settlement movements. Some villages expanded by dividing into upper and lower parts while others participated in the eastward migration beyond the Elba. In these eastern areas, once covered in Slavic forests, settlers cleared the land. sometimes clashing with local Slavic communities before permanent colonization took hold. During this period, countless new towns sprang up. Between the 11th and 15th centuries, medieval Europe transformed dramatically. Long-d distanceance trade, coinbased economies, and the rise of marketplaces increasingly connected rural regions to urban centers. Farmers brought their surplus goods to town markets where they could in turn buy metal tools, ceramics, and other items. The saying city air makes you free emerged, meaning that anyone who entered a town and lived there for a year and a day could free themselves from feudal obligations. Similarly, clearing land makes you free was common. Anyone who cleared and farmed unused land could often claim rights similar to those of free farmers. Around the year 1300, Europe's landscape was more densely populated than today. There were more villages, although each was typically smaller in size. Fields, meadows, and riverlands were marked off by walls, hedges, or fences. Forests were no longer wild, untouched places, but carefully managed woodlands. Pigs, sheep, and cattle grazed there, and some forest areas were used as communal grazing grounds, like orchard pastures or hut forests, where animals could roam. Despite the huge gains in crop yields during the high middle ages, sometimes three to four times the output of earlier centuries, serious problems arose from soil exhaustion, manure shortages, and erosion. The Great Magdalene flood of 1342 was a devastating disaster that reshaped much of Europe's river systems. Torrential rains raised river levels dramatically, washing away soil, breaking dikes and destroying farmland. Major rivers like the Rine, Danube, and Ela, as well as smaller waterways across central and eastern Europe, saw villages heavily damaged or completely swept away. At the time, some prime agricultural lands still delivered two or three times the seed sown. But many marginal plots, areas that had been newly brought under cultivation, collapsed. They eroded so badly that they had to be abandoned. Livestock farming, once a vital pillar of the rural economy, faded into the background as crossd district grain farming proved more profitable. In many regions, even poor soils were converted to farmland, but these lands yielded little grain in return. As a result, the overall crop yield per acre stagnated or even declined. As farming systems became more strained, medieval Europe grew more vulnerable to crop failures. Already in the 14th century, famines broke out sporadically, sometimes limited to one region, sometimes affecting wide areas. For example, in the year 1345, vast stretches of land from northern Spain to northern Italy suffered from severe food shortages. Then came the Black Death. Between 1343 and 1346, the plague swept through central Europe, wiping out up to a third of the population. As a result, grain prices dropped sharply. Suddenly, supply far exceeded the reduced demand. Fields were abandoned, often starting with the least productive plots. This process of rewing farmland actually boosted yields on the remaining land as more labor could now be concentrated on fewer acres. Peasants who had barely scraped by before now found themselves in a stronger bargaining position. With less available land and fewer workers, they became highly sought after. At first, this shift brought clear advantages for the peasantry. But as the famine and plague years faded, new challenges emerged. Population growth slowed or barely recovered as many crops and livestock had been wiped out. Yet taxes and labor dues were still being collected and in some cases landlords began converting these to cash payments, preferring money over grain which they couldn't easily store. By around 1450, a clear trend was emerging. Feudal labor services, compulsory duties, and surfom itself were gradually retreating across many regions. Peasants gained new privileges. They formed cooperatives to collectively govern their villages and began adding small trades or crafts to their local economies. things like blacksmithing, weaving or milling which offered extra income sources. In some places, these changes effectively ended surfom. At the same time, agriculture diversified alongside high yield crop farming. Livestock production, especially cattle for milk, butter, and cheese regained importance. Vegetable and garden farming also became more prominent with crops like cabbage, turnips, and legumes. In some areas, the shift was so advanced that the share of livestock and dairy in the rural economy gradually rivaled that of crop farming. Chapter 3. Daily life and family structures of medieval peasants. Let's set aside the old stereotype that peasant homes were little more than dirt floor huts. In reality, during the high and late middle ages, peasant buildings came in many forms, showing impressive regional diversity and craftsmanship. Early on, postframe houses were common. These were built by driving thick wooden posts directly into the ground with beams laid across the top, but they didn't last long. The upright posts rotted quickly in damp soil. By the 11th century, in forested regions, people began using frame construction similar to half-timbering. Vertical posts were placed on stone or brick foundations carrying the weight of the roof while the spaces between them were filled with wle and dob or wooden planks. On many manor lands or in peasant villages you could find a mix of these building styles. For example, a farmhouse might have an old postframe section attached to a newer blockbuilt parlor. In the alpine foothills, such combinations were fairly common. By the late middle ages, the famous lowger German hall house or hall and barn house had emerged. A structure where both the living quarters and the animal stalls were housed under a single roof. Contrary to popular belief, late medieval peasants had wooden beam ceilings, plastered walls, and even window inserts. Some wealthier farming families added wooden wall paneling made from steamed pine or oak and they built ceramic stoves to keep their rooms warm in winter. In places like South Tier near Clausen, medieval parlors still survive today, showing whitewashed walls and beautifully crafted wood paneling. Peasant interiors ranged widely from smoky dark spaces with little furniture to cozy rooms with carved benches, curtains, and candle chandeliers for extra comfort. Family life was usually patriarchal and patrioal, meaning the father ruled as the head of the household, the house v, while the mother, often living with the husband's family, managed the home, the stable, and the kitchen. Until the agricultural crisis, it was nearly impossible to leave the farm without a lord's permission or protection, meaning families stayed rooted in one place. daughters typically married into nearby villages, often to farms under church or noble patronage. A typical household included the heirs, often just one son, or in cases of shared inheritance, all sons, along with the mother, father, and grandparents if they were still alive. Depending on the farm's size, there might also be hired hands, male and female servants, and even landless relatives who had no inheritance rights. Farm owners known as stam farmers often maintained a small household staff who worked unpaid within the family economy, receiving only food and lodging in exchange. This labor setup set medieval peasants apart from modern wage laborers. Cash payments like small annual rents were rare. Instead, the system functioned largely on direct subsistence and barter. The medieval farmer held extensive rights, often summed up under the term house and farm rights. Within his household, he could impose punishments on family members or servants, control who came and went, and handled disputes that arose under his roof. Passing the farm to the next generation followed two main legal traditions. Real division, common under Frankish law, or indivisible inheritance under Saxon law. Real division meant that when there were several sons, the farm was split into equal parts. As a result, each heir worked a smaller portion of land, and depending on the farm's size, they often had to find secondary sources of income. In contrast, under old Saxon law, the indivisible inheritance system was used. Here only one son, usually the eldest, inherited the entire farm, while the brothers received smaller plots, partial shares or cash payments. This kept large farms intact, boosting both economic efficiency and social stability. Below the full farmers, those owning entire farmsteads, were many social tiers. There were quarter, half or eighth farmers who only controlled part of a full farm. Then came the cottages who had no farmland, just a small house with a garden, and often rented fields or worked as drivers and haulers. Day laborers typically owned neither land nor garden, and worked by the day for wages and meals, either on farms or for lords. Servants, both male and female, were entirely landless and lived on others farms without any claim to farm status. Within the village, only full farmers and sometimes half farmers had political rights. They could be elected to local offices such as village judge or juror. All other groups were effectively excluded from local governance and had to rely on their lord to represent their interests. Social standing wasn't just defined by land ownership, but also by livestock. The number of oxmen or horse teams a farmer owned determined how much labor he was expected to provide for feudal duties and how much he had to pay in taxes. Small farmers with only a few animals could use smaller tools and had limited access to shared pastures. Larger herds allowed participation in slaughtering events, local markets, and the use of communal meadows, all of which brought higher standing in the village community. A symbolic glimpse of peasant status can be seen in an artwork by Alrech Dura, showing two farmers emphasizing their masculinity. One places a sword before him, the other wears a heavy knife at his belt. Even by 1600, this suggested that a member of the rural upper class carried a sense of dignity or gravitas. The meer, the steward managing the farm on behalf of the lord, held an administrative position, usually secured by inheritance. Jurors in the village court were always full farmers, each owning one or more full farms. Their daughters could sometimes marry into the nightly class if they were wealthy enough. A literary example is the tale of Hellreck, the son of a meer, who ends up as a robber knight, a symbol that social mobility from farming to nobility was theoretically possible, though rarely smooth. In contrast stood the cottages and Katner who owned only a tiny house or a small house plot. While they were part of the village community, they had no political rights or equal access to shared lands. Day laborers and farm hands occupied the very bottom of the village hierarchy. They lived on other farmers land and had no claim to property. Peasant clothing ranged widely in quality. Generally, medieval clothing was made at home. Women spun fibers from flax or wool. Weavers created linen or wool fabrics. And tanners prepared leather for simple boots or shoes. A widespread misconception suggests that peasant clothing was poor, rough, and shabby. In reality, weaving wool and linen was a daily craft, and medieval fabrics often had impressive quality. Those who worked with fine wool could produce garments that lasted for decades. So, the idea that they deliberately made lowquality clothing is simply false. At the same time, peasants were bound by strict textile and clothing regulations during the high and late middle ages. As early as the mid12th century, church chronicles stated that peasants should wear gray or undyed fabrics to set them apart from the urban and noble classes. These dress codes were tied to local or royal decrees. For instance, peasants weren't allowed to use more than seven L's, a medieval unit of length of cloth for shirts, pants, and shoes. The Bavarian peace of 1244 even banned peasants from wearing luxurious colorful fabrics or garments with silk trim. Among the noble and urban classes, these clothing rules were a point of pride, a way to uphold their own moral and social standing. But sometimes sharp criticism flared up against peasants living above their means who dared to buy fancy belts or pearlstudded headpieces. In fact, the upper peasant class had its own taste for fashion. Satirical poems from courtly literature poke fun at peasants wearing shirts decorated with glittering cords and silver buttons. A famous image from the H Highleberg song manuscript around 1600 shows a peasant sporting a fine ruffled shirt, the kind popular among the nobility. All of this fed into a cultural anxiety among nobles and towns people who feared that peasants were no longer humble and modest, but were pushing into urban fashion trends, threatening to blur the established social hierarchy. Chapter 4. Gardens and agricultural tools in the Middle Ages. Beyond farmland and meadows, one of the most important parts of a medieval farm was the household garden. The old German word gate originally meant enclosed area. Usually a plot surrounded by hedges or fences where vegetables and herbs were grown. Legally, the garden was considered a protected space, much like the house itself, and there were clear rules about who was allowed to plant there. Inside these gardens, farmers grew vegetables like cabbage and turnips. Millet was also part of the garden culture as it was less important on the open fields. Typical fiber plants such as flax for linen or matter for dying were raised in small garden plots, too. Legumes, peas, beans, lentils were vital because they enriched the soil and provided protein. Herbs like parsley, dill, margarm, and coriander were used to enhance flavor in cooking. For every farming family, the household garden was the minimum source of daily nutrition. vegetables, herbs, often a few wild greens like spinach or even foraged plants such as ground elder and nettles. All of these complimented the grain-based diet. A farmer without a garden, villagers said, stood at the very bottom of the social ladder. Without garden space, there was no way to grow fresh produce. In the early medieval period, most farming tools were made entirely of wood, plows, harrows, wooden sled carts, and simple threshing sledges. But by the 12th century, iron tools became increasingly common. Sickles, knives, harotines, and plowshares were reinforced with iron, making them sturdier and longerlasting. Sythes which were initially used just for cutting wood soon developed tooththed edges for cleaner cuts when harvesting. The biggest breakthrough was the move from the light scratch plow to the heavy moldboard plow. The old scratch plow common in the early middle ages just scraped the surface of the soil. To loosen the ground properly, farmers had to plow across the same field again in another direction. Later came the wheeled plow, which sat between the scratch plow and the moldboard plow. Its wheels made it easier to steer the animals pulling it. But the real gamecher was the heavy moldboard plow. It had been around since ancient times, but only became widely used in Europe around the 10th century. Its special curved moldboard turned and broke up the soil, making it much better for heavy clay lands and helping keep weeds down. At first, oxen were still the main draft animals. Their cloven hooves, protected by primitive hoof coverings, made them steadier on swampy terrain. But with the introduction of the padded horse collar, farmers increasingly turned to horses. A single horse could pull roughly the same load as a pair of oxen, but was faster and more resilient. It wasn't until the 15th century that the reversible mold board, allowing furrows to be plowed evenly in both directions, fully caught on. Before that, farmers usually plowed in only one direction and had to reverse the plow at the edge of each field. In medieval times, there was a strict distinction between household rights, the private sacred rights within the family home and village rights, which governed the farmyard, the garden, and all shared lands. Inside the house, the family head near absolute authority over the household, spouse, children, and servants alike. But as soon as you stepped out onto the farm or garden, depending on your social rank, village rights came into play. Even a garden, though technically private, fell under the communal order. In an ideal medieval Halandorf, a clustered village typical of the 16th century, the church with its fenced cemetery stood at the center. As villages settled permanently, cemeteries moved into the heart of the village. People were now buried within the village. Surrounding the church were individual farms, each enclosed by small gardens with woven fences. You often saw small ramps, ladders, or stepping stones over the fences, keeping animals out, but letting the family easily access the garden. The village commons included central grassy areas, wells, communal bakehouses, village smithies, and if present, large grain stores. Around the village stretched the communal farmland divided into units called zelen. Each zelge operated on a three field rotation system. One/3 for summer crops like barley or oats, one/3 for winter crops like wheat or rye and 1/3 left as pasture or meadow to recover. Each farmer worked narrow strips of land in the big shared fields laid out in long, slim plots. This shape made it easier to plow and sew in straight lines without disturbing the soil too much. But to keep everything running smoothly, the whole village followed a strict farming calendar. When to plow, when to plant, when to let animals graze. This system called field obligation was key to making the three field rotation work. Anyone who broke the rules could face tough fines. In some regions, especially in Eastern Germany, you didn't have these clustered villages. Instead, farmers lived in street villages where homes lined a road, and each house had a long, narrow strip of land stretching out behind it. These farmers could work their own land more freely without having to follow the strict shared calendar. Beyond the private fields and homes were the communal lands, shared pastures, meadows, orchards, woods, streams, and ponds. Access to these depended on status. Full farmers who owned large farms had rights to use the best spots because they also provided labor and equipment when needed. Small holders and day laborers often had little or no access to these shared resources. In every village, people shared simple tools for transport, like big wagons, especially important during hay harvest. These wagons carried the hay from the fields to the barns where it was stored for winter feed. Without them, it would have been nearly impossible to handle large hay harvests. Villages also ran communal mills. windmills or water mills, though these usually belong to the local lord or the church. Villagers had to bring their grain there to be ground and pay a fee. Other shared spaces included bake houses and wine sellers, which were built using village funds, but managed together. Not every farmhouse had its own oven or wine press, so these communal places were essential for daily needs and celebrations. A drawing from the 1600s shows how villages set up their own bakeouses and wine sellers to provide bread and wine. Managing all this shared infrastructure was the job of elected local officials like debt collectors, village judges and jurors. Chapter 5. Commons village organization and social stratification in the late middle ages. As villages settled permanently and became self-sufficient, they shared access to common land, the shared spaces beyond private farms. This included roads, pastures, meadows, forests, streams, and ponds, as well as temporary or seasonal operations like lime kils, quaries, or simple iron works. In the high middle ages, as the need for steel and iron grew, villagers searched for local bog iron, set up small furnaces and produced limited amounts of iron. But these workshops didn't run year round. If there was no demand, they just stopped since there were no steady markets or trade networks. Sometimes any extra iron was sold in the nearest towns or markets. Access to shared village resources was usually limited to farmers who owned full-sized farms. Small holders and landless villagers often had little or no access and had to buy things like iron or lime from the local steward or the monastery. These limits led to tensions, especially in the early 1400s and 1500s when peasants protested what they saw as the plundering of the commons. Nobles and church leaders tried to take over shared lands, turning them into private grazing fields or expanding their hunting grounds, which cut off peasants from using them. Hunting bans were issued and lands that had once been shared were placed under the lord's control. In response, village communities began handling more administrative tasks that had once been controlled by the lords. They enforced local farming rules, setting the calendar for planting, harvesting, and grazing. stewards or tax collectors gathered payments, usually a tenth of the harvest, and delivered it to the Lord's storehouse. Over time, these village positions were no longer held only by big land owners, but were often filled by elected community members. The village increasingly acted as a collective representing the interests of all its farmers. Village courts also took on judicial functions. These local courts made up of a village judge, jurors, and headmen settled disputes between farmers such as border disagreements, conflicts over labor obligations, or claims to the commons. They didn't handle major crimes, murder, robbery, or serious breaches of peace remained under the jurisdiction of higher courts. But for civil matters like inheritance or communal rights, the village court was far more connected to daily life than distant feudal or princely judges. At the same time, princely and clerical holdings maintain their own rights within the village. preserved hunting grounds, private meadows, fish ponds, mills, bridges, tithe barns, parish houses, and monastic farms. The church received its share of the tithe directly. A portion of the village harvest went straight to the clergy. Small shrines and chapels at the village's edge reflected this overlapping presence of village self-ruule and ecclesiastical authority. By the late Middle Ages, village society had become sharply divided. At the top were full farmers, families who owned at least one full-sized farm. They had voting rights in village matters, full access to shared lands, could build up reserves, keep herds of animals, and handle their duties on their own terms. Below them were the half-free peasants who worked directly for the local lord. While technically not free, some could rise in status by becoming trusted servants of the nobility. Smallh holders who only had a tiny house and maybe a small garden or a little bit of farmland had no rights to the main farmland or shared resources. They also had no vote in village decisions. Day laborers owned no land at all. They survived by working for daily wages, mostly during harvest, and often worked on the farms of richer neighbors. At the very bottom were servants who were completely landless and not even counted as part of the formal village community. Their lives were controlled by the households they worked for, and any concerns they had were represented by their masters. Already in the 14th and 15th centuries, as regional rulers expanded their administrative systems, this village state began to crumble. Local village judges and jurors were gradually replaced by stateappointed stewards and tax collectors. Many village rights shifted to the territorial lords who installed their own forest officials or customs posts. Peasants protested these changes during the peasant uprisings, especially between 1449 and 1455, demanding the preservation of local communal rights and the return of the commons they had used for generations. Chapter 6. Social differentiation and peasant everyday culture. A famous image by Alrechdura from around 1600 shows two farmers posed confidently. One has placed a sword on the table before him while the other wears a sturdy knife at his belt. Both signal we are not just primitive farmers but members of a rural upper class, people with rights and dignity. At the top of the village stood the local leaders, sometimes hereditary, sometimes elected by village assemblies. They represented the community in dealings with the landlord and made sure farming rules and shared rights were respected. Working alongside them were stewards who managed small farms for the lord and local judges who handled civil or land disputes. Whether a farm stayed in the family over generations depended a lot on local laws. In areas with Frankish law, like parts of Franconia or the Rine region, the system of equal inheritance applied. When a farmer died, all sons inherited equally, dividing the land again and again until none of the pieces were big enough to support a family. These shrinking plots forced many heirs to take on extra work like day labor or small crafts just to get by. In contrast, regions under Saxon law such as Saxony or Meccllinburgg followed a system where the entire farm went to the main heir, usually the eldest son. The siblings got compensation or small goods, but the farm itself stayed whole. In many areas, this system lasted into the 18th century. Even among full farmers, there were layers. Below them were half farmers, quarter farmers, and even smaller holders, each with just part of a full farm, often split among several brothers. Below that came small holders with only a house and garden, but no stable or large fields. Lower still were the day laborers who owned nothing and worked for others when needed. At the very bottom were the servants who worked on farms, often without pay and had no political voice at all. Livestock holdings were another key marker of social status. Farmers who owned more draft animals, oxmen or horses, had greater transportation capacity and were often exempt from certain labor duties. The number of oxmen or horses was both a signal of wealth and a practical tool. Someone with even a single team could work a field independently, while those without teams had to perform extra labor just to get by. The village economy extended well beyond simple farming. Wagon makers built carts. Blacksmiths shaped iron tools. Tanners produced leather. Binders tied together grain sheav. Brick makers and potters crafted clay vessels. and weavers and spinners supplied families with linen and wool fabrics. These trades were usually tied to farming families, but by the late 14th and 15th centuries, they increasingly evolved into specialized village groups that formed their own guilds. Clothing was often handmade in rural households. Wool and linen were the most common materials. Wool came from local sheep, while linen was spun from flax. The fibers were spun by hand spindles, woven into yarn, and then dyed. Colored fabrics were especially valued among peasants. Normally, farmers wore gray or natural colored linen or wool garments, but wealthier households could afford more colorful materials. Occasionally, well-off peasants decorated their clothing with pearlstudded accessories, wore stylish leather belts with metal ornaments, or embroidered their hats with colorful threads. Local nobles often complain that these farmers were living beyond their means, wearing silk trims or gold buttons on their shirts, blurring the social lines that the elite wanted to maintain. Peasant clothing was functional above all. Men typically wore tunics and trousers made from tightly woven wool fabric along with leather lace up shoes that were sturdy but not stylish. Women often wore long linen dresses with simple decorative borders as well as linen or wool caps or hairetss. Children's clothing followed the same patterns as the adults, though made in smaller sizes. A farmer who had no access to dye plants or colored threads usually stuck to undyed linen or wool. But wealthier farmers invested in materials like wool dyed with wde or matter which gave their clothing more vibrant and intense colors. Chapter 7. Food and eating culture among medieval farmers. The diet of medieval farmers was far from boring or bland. People today often assume peasants just lived on thin oat porridge or plain gr. But in reality, the variety of their meals were surprisingly rich. Grains played a central role in their diet. In the early Middle Ages, millet was one of the most common crops grown in home gardens. Farmers cooked it into hearty porrges, sometimes with milk, sometimes with water, and even shaped it into small dumplings. In poorer regions, millet often replaced the more expensive wheat. Barley was another staple, sewn in the spring and harvested by late summer. It worked well in porridge, stews, or as feed for animals. Oats, meanwhile, were mostly grown to feed horses and were usually harvested in the fall, so you rarely saw oat fields in late spring. Rye was especially important in cooler mountainous regions. As a winter grain, it was resilient and could handle damp conditions, making it the main ingredient for bread, especially during tough times when food was scarce. Wheat on the other hand was considered a luxury. It had higher yields but was more vulnerable to mildew in wet areas. So only the best lands were used for it and it was highly priced. When it came to bread, it's worth knowing that in the early Middle Ages, bread wasn't something every household had daily. Home ovens were rare, and if a family didn't own one, they had to rely on the village bake house. Villages often had communal bake houses where people could bake their bread for a fee or by offering labor in return. Making bread required sourdough starters that families carefully preserved across generations. Many poorer families rarely baked bread and instead relied on porridge as their staple food. When they did eat bread, it was often broken into pieces, not sliced, and typically dipped into soups or stews to soften it. Porridge, or what they called mush, was the backbone of the medieval peasants diet. But it wasn't just thin, watery, grl. These porr, sometimes so firm they were almost slicable, much like today's palenta. Dumplings back then resembled heavy bread dumplings or dense wheat porrges shaped into balls. Many recipes blurred the lines. A barley or rye porridge sweetened with honey and herbs could be a filling meal on its own. Vegetables and field crops also played a big role. Cabbage, both white and seavoy varieties, was one of the main summer and fall vegetables and could be preserved through fermentation or pickling, providing vital vitamins in the winter months. Root vegetables like carrots and yellow turnips were initially grown more for animal feed, but by the high middle ages had become common on the dinner table. Legumes like peas, beans, and lentils, known back then as salad, were a key source of protein and also improved soil health, making them valuable both in the kitchen and on the farm. Herbs rounded out the medieval flavor pallet. Parsley, dill, coriander, margarm, juniper, fennel and carowway were widely used not just to season food but also for healing and as natural fragrances. Medieval records from as early as the Carolian Empire list pages of herbs cultivated for food, medicine, and scent. Even dye plants like w matter and turmeric were sometimes grown alongside herbs, especially by peasants who doubled as dyers, coloring fabrics for clothing. When it came to protein, medieval farm households had more variety than you might think. Pigs were the favorite animals for home slaughter because they could eat kitchen scraps and turn them into valuable meat. Cows were mostly kept for their milk, while sheep and goats provided not just meat, but also wool and hides for clothing and tools. Poultry was everywhere. Chickens were especially popular because they grew quickly. In just about 40 days, you could raise a chick into a slaughter ready bird. Farmers also kept ducks, geese, and sometimes guinea foul. Eggs and chicken meat were key sources of protein in the spring and summer. Wild game added more variety. Small game like hairs or partridges were caught using traps, nets, or small crossbows. Only the local elite like wealthy full farmers or free men were allowed to hunt with larger crossbows. Specialized hunters such as falconers usually worked for noble estates or monasteries. Fish was another important part of the diet. People ate fresh or smoked river fish and pond fish, including herring, halibet, and sometimes saltwater fish brought inland. By the late Middle Ages, some regions had well-developed pond farming, especially using mill ponds, which boosted the local fish supply. Milk products and honey were essential household staples. Butter was a fantastic way to preserve milk for the winter, and it served as both a cooking fat and a flavor booster. Cheese came in many forms. Hard cheese, soft cheese, or fresh cheese, depending on the region and how long it was aged. Cheese was not just a vital food reserve for the cold months, but also a valuable product for trade. Buttermilk, left over from making butter, was either drunk or used as fertilizer in the vegetable garden. And then there was honey. Both wild forest honey and honey from village beekeepers were highly praised. Honey was one of the best and most expensive sweeteners and was often used as a form of payment, a real symbol of rural self-sufficiency. Fruit and foraged foods rounded out the medieval farm diet. Many farms had orchards or shared access to community fruit trees like apples, pears, and cherries. Wild plants like berries, mushrooms, and herbs were gathered from the surrounding countryside. People also collected wild greens like wild garlic, ground elder, nettles, and dandelion along with edible or medicinal roots and berries like mugwart, borage or juniper berries. Herbs and flavorings came mainly from local gardens. Farmers grew parsley, dill, coriander, margarm, sage, savory, and thyme to season their dishes. Vinegar made from sour wine or cider added sharpness to meals. For cooking fats, they used lard from pigs, which packed both calories and taste. Salt was one of the most precious ingredients. It had to be mined from salt works or imported over long trade routes and was costly. Pepper was considered a luxury spice, rarely seen in peasant households, though from the high middle ages onward, small amounts sometimes made their way into rural kitchens. Preservation techniques were essential for surviving the winter. Drying was common. People hung meat, fish, vegetables, and herbs in drying rooms or laid them out on racks. Smoking was another popular method. Bacon, fish, meat, and cheese were cured in the smokeouses attached to farmhouses. Sultting and pickling were also widespread. Fish and meat were soaked in brine while vegetables, fruits, and herbs were preserved in vinegar or oil. The rhythm of medieval farm life was shaped by the seasons. In the summer, fresh herbs from the garden, berries, wild greens, and fresh caught fish filled the table. Autumn was the peak season for harvesting vegetables and fruits like apples and pears, but also for slaughtering animals, especially pigs, and for making cider and fruit wine. Winter was all about surviving on stored foods, hearty stews, thick porrges, root vegetables, pickled goods, honey, cheese, butter, and smoked meats. Spring, particularly during Lent and the fasting period, often meant facing the leanest weeks when there was little fresh food. Instead of meat, people relied on fish like carp and proteinrich legumes such as beans and peas. Chapter 8. Leisure, folk culture, and the yearly work cycle. In the daily life of a medieval farmer, the idea of free time as we know it barely existed. Almost every moment was tied to work on the house, the farm, or within the village. But that didn't mean people never had fun. Quite the opposite, there were many ways for villagers to relax, celebrate, and enjoy culture together. Village taverns began popping up as early as the High Middle Ages. These inns were easy to spot. They often had wooden signs with symbols or crests hanging over their doors. The windows were small, sometimes fitted with lattice patterns to help keep the warmth inside. At the entrance, you might find small pass through doors designed so the inkeeper could hand out food and drinks without having to walk all the way across the tavern room. In spring, villagers built simple outdoor stages to host plays. Local actors performed biblical stories or legends, and the sword dance was a highlight. Men in leather trousers, waving swords and bright cloths, danced in formation, not to show fighting skill, but to display social rank since only free farmers could own swords. Shooting clubs were common, too. In the evenings, farmers practiced with bows or crossbows, aiming at targets near the village windmill. These practices evolved into lively shooting festivals where one person was crowned the village marksman. Big festivals like weddings, church feasts, or village fairs brought everyone together. Squares were decorated with flags. Villagers danced, played games, or competed in long jumps and stonethrowing contests. Religious events like processions or local pilgrimages also played a big role, blending spiritual life with community bonding. Groups walked to small chapels, stopping to pray, sing, and rest, making these moments both devotional and social. And after long work days, villagers gathered to play dice or early card games like tarot. Not just to gamble, but to relax and enjoy time together. Now, let's walk through the typical farming year as it was shown in medieval illustrated calendars and books of ours. Month by month, the rhythm of farm life. In January, farmers focused on indoor chores. Women spun flax, men wo linen, and families did small repairs around the house. They also chopped firewood for the winter and cleaned out the animal stalls, making sure the cattle and pigs were wellfed and warm. Some even transported firewood to city markets to sell. February brought more of the same. indoor work like repairs and woodworking, crafting tools and maintaining the household. Beekeepers checked their hives and collected wax for making candles or other goods. More wood was brought into town for trade or sale. March marked the start of outdoor repairs. Farmers mended fences and pasture enclosures, pulled weeds, and worked the soil. Plowing began in earnest. oxen or horses were harnessed to simple plows, readying the fields for spring crops like oats. By April, attention shifted to garden work. Families turned over the garden beds, spread manure, and planted beans and peas. Field work picked up, too, with plowing and harrowing for the summer grains. The animals were driven out onto the pastures, marking the true start of the outdoor farming season. In May, there was less pressure from heavy farm work, and people finally had time for themselves. Villagers gathered by the riverside to dance, took refreshing swims in local ponds, or set out on small boat rides, even chilling drinks by lowering metal flasks into the cool current. May, often called the month of joy, was mostly given over to celebrating springtime with fewer demands from the fields. By June, though, the real work picked up again. Farmers headed out to cut hay, swinging their sides through the tall grasses, carefully laying the cutings on linen sheets before loading them onto big wooden wagons. Back at the barns, they heaved the hay up into the lofts, packing it tightly to build the winter supply of animal fodder. Without this hard work, there would be no way to keep the livestock fed during the cold months. July brought the grain harvest. Oats and barley were ready to cut, and farmers bent over the fields with sickles, working carefully to gather as much as possible. In some places, they used special tooththed sickles to speed up the cutting. At the same time, berries, early apples, and cherries were being picked, adding fresh fruit to the household stores. Once the grain was cut, it was brought to the village threshing floors, broad packed earth spaces, or even public squares where it was tossed into the air, letting the wind help separate the chaff from the kernels. Sometimes they dragged rough wooden boards covered with flint across the grain to break it apart more efficiently. Once cleaned, the precious grain was moved into tall storage barns, stacked carefully away for the months ahead. As August rolled in, the harvest season wrapped up. Farmers dried the last of the sheav under the open sky, finished threshing, and then turned to clearing the fields. Leftover straw was chopped down, and the land was made ready for the sewing of winter crops. September brought the grape harvest in wine growing regions like Franconia, the Mosul Valley, and the Rine. Wine farmers often enjoyed a higher status since wine-making was seen as a prestigious and skilled craft. Meanwhile, in other parts of the countryside, farmers were already sewing rye and wheat for the winter season. It was also the start of the acorn feeding season when pigs were driven into the forests to fatten up on fallen acorns and beach nuts, helping to build up their meat before the winter slaughter. In the wine regions, fresh grapes were stored in cool underground cellers where they would slowly ferment into wine. October was a time to finish planting rye and wheat and to begin slaughtering cattle. Beef was especially prized for feasts or winter storage, and farmers also focused on drying fruits like apples and pears and gathering herbs for the long cold season ahead. In November, pigs were still being fattened in the woods, getting them ready for slaughter. Farmers also worked on processing flax, breaking the tough stalks to extract fibers for linen making. With winter closing in, they repaired tools, treated leather, and made sure they had everything ready for the next spring's planting. December brought the big pig slaughter, a major event that filled winter stores with bacon, sausages, and ham. This usually happened before Christmas when the cold helped preserve the meat. Families also baked big batches of bread and spent the dark days weaving, mending clothes, and repairing shoes. These monthly rhythms appear in many medieval manuscripts and calendars like the book of hours of the Duke Deer, the Celestat Psalms or the H Highleberg song manuscript. Even back in the Carolinian period around 8:18, foldable calendars like the Capitular Devilis showed peasants at work capturing the farm cycle across the 12 months. Life in the medieval world was deeply tied to this steady seasonal rhythm. Chapter nine. Village-based entertainment and festival culture. In the villages, there were all kinds of community entertainment. The idea that rural life was only about hard, boring farm labor is simply wrong and just as false as the picture of a helpless, suffering peasant. Village taverns were often built at the far edge of the village near main roads or watermills. A tavern usually had a sign hanging outside, maybe a wooden cup, a knife, or a rooster, and its windows were fitted with lattises, protecting the guests inside while still allowing them to look out. Special little doors let the inkeeper pass food and drinks to hungry farm workers without them needing to come inside the main room. In early spring, villagers would set up makeshift wooden stages in the center of town for carnival plays. Local teenagers often took part performing comedies, ballads, or religious mystery plays. One special tradition was the sword dance where farmers dressed in costumes and sashes carrying swords moved in choreographed steps on the stage. These dances weren't just for entertainment. They were a way for the village to show itself as a proud independent community. Near some windmills or watermills, you could find target boards where villagers practiced shooting with crossbows, long bows, or even slingshots. Over time, these shooting groups became formal guilds. Being chosen as the vill's shooting king was a big honor, and neighbors from other villages were often invited for competitions. The mills were a practical location. They made enough noise to cover the sounds of practice and stood as clear landmarks. Dice and card games made their way north from southern Europe. By the 1300s, peasants were already gathering in taverns or at festivals to play dice games. Card games like Tarokino or Lorenzo Ilmaniko were more common among the wealthy or nobility. But by the 1400s, simpler cards began to spread into the countryside. Villagers also organized competitions. Long jumping, stone throwing, or wrestling matches were held in the village squares. These weren't really about fame or prizes. They were about shared experience, fun, and testing each other's strength. Games with balls or bowlinglike contests were popular at harvest festivals or church fairs. People would roll balls toward targets set in grooves or ditches, similar to early versions of bowling. Village festivals, like harvest fairs or church feast days, were colorful and lively. Flags and banners, much like city guild flags, marked which village group or association was organizing the event. For example, during a Thanksgiving procession, the village leader might carry the Sebastian banner, a red penant with an image of St. Sebastian. During these festivals, villagers gathered in taverns or big barns to dance, eat, laugh, and sometimes argue loudly. A 16th century illustration shows long wooden benches and tables, people drinking from clay mugs or brass cups, and beer drawn from large barrels. Outside, families would sit on benches sipping local wine, beer, or mead. In some villages, there were public bathous with wooden tubs or shared bath areas, especially in forested regions where firewood was easy to find. Where wood was scarce, wealthier folks would just head to the local mill pond for a cooling dip. One old illustration even shows farmers splashing in a mill pond right beside the rushing water of the mill race. Athletic events were another favorite pastime. Farmers organized races down long field paths to test their stamina, or they'd gather on open land to see who could throw a heavy stone the farthest. Archery was both a hobby and a serious skill. Practicing with long bows was essential, whether for hunting or for village contests. Religion played a huge role in village life, and processions were a regular part of the year. On feast days, villagers would walk through the village, passing wayside shrines, chapels, and the rectory. Many villages had small pilgrimage sites with merry chapels or statues of saints, and these became yearly pilgrimage destinations. Even though these trips took time, they were an important mix of spiritual devotion and social bonding. A famous painting by Peter Bugal the Elder around 1568 shows a village festival packed with people. You can see villagers drinking wine, dancing, performing sword dances, or shooting crossbows all in one lively scene. A night fights a dragon-shaped wagon while the local shooting club practices by the windmill in the background. Drums, bag pipes, and trumpets filled the air, reminding us that fun and folklore were not limited to city life. Sometimes villages even competed with their neighbors to see who could throw the most impressive festival. Behind the big banner, you'd spot the village tavern with its carved bottle sign on the gable, marking the connection to local wine sellers. The lattis windows showed that both display and security mattered. Carnival plays were staged on wooden platforms in the village square, draped in colorful cloth. You'd see actors dressed as penitants, poking fun at the clergy or farmers wearing oversized headbands, humorously mimming heavy tasks. These shows weren't just religious. They were also a way for villagers to express their own identity and humor. Sword dances stood as a status symbol. Carrying a sword in the village signaled that you were free, not bound to servitude. And these dances where a farmer stroed through the village to the beat of drums and flutes were part of the village's ritual memory. Even if actual peasant warfare had mostly faded by the late middle ages, the symbolism remained strong. Shooting guilds required years of practice. While city guilds had their own shooting halls by the 14th century, village marksmen trained outdoors, often near the mill. The mill's noise covered the sound of arrows or crossbow bolts, and the tall structure made it easy to fix target boards where everyone could see. These traditions reveal a lively, self-aware village culture, one where entertainment, ritual, and social ties all blended together into a distinct rural life. Even in the long, dark months of winter, villagers found ways to come together and celebrate. One of the oldest and most symbolic traditions was the sword dance. Well into the 16th century, farmers who owned their own swords would gather in the village square, especially on All Saints Day, St. Martin's Day, or right before carnival. These dances weren't just performances. They were a proud display of rural dignity, a sign that these villagers were free men, not bound surfs. Another key gathering spot was the village windmill. This was where the local shooting societies would meet. Every Friday, farmers gathered with their crossbows, long bows, or even early firearms to practice shooting at targets hung beside the mill. An old illustration from the time shows a village shooter carefully aiming at a target nailed to the mill's wall, the windmill blades turning lazily in the background. These sessions weren't just about skill. They helped tie the community together, especially when they led up to the village shooting festivals. Those festivals lasted from sunrise to dusk. The best marksmen were crowned with laurel wreaths honored with small handcrafted musketss or beautifully carved arrows as trophies. There was dancing, wine, keg tossing, and plenty of local treats like fried bread spread thick with lard. In some regions, villages even formed what were known as tavern guilds. These groups held certain rights over local stalls, wells, or pastures. A banner with the town's emblem would hang proudly outside, showing that the community was self-organized and responsible for its members, much like the guilds in the cities. And of course, no village carnival was complete without masks and disguises. During carnival, farmers would hide behind simple linen masks or wear wooden ones that exaggerated the features of nobles or clergy in comical mocking ways. These handcarved masks, often decorated with painted strips of fabric, were central to traditions like the carnival races or the ritual dragging of straw figures across the village square. Chapter 10. The peasant yearly rhythm. At the end of the farming year, medieval villagers had a very clear sense of how life on the land and in the village had played out for centuries. The medieval calendars and illustrated manuscripts captured this rhythm beautifully month by month, showing a world shaped by seasonal tasks and rituals. In January and February, people focused on indoor tasks. Weaving cloth, making repairs, chopping firewood, caring for the animals, and trading timber. March and April brought the first outdoor work of the year. Fixing fences, pulling weeds, plowing the fields for summer crops, reworking garden beds, sewing seeds, and pushing animals back out to the pastures. May was a lighter period with little fieldwork. Instead, people enjoyed dancing, bathing, boating on rivers, and the first outdoor games of spring. June was the time for the hay harvest. Farmers swung their sides across the lush meadows, stacking the cutg grass onto wagons, hauling it to the barns and tossing it up to the high lofts where it would stay dry as winter feed for the animals. In July and August, the grain harvest took center stage. Summer crops like oats and barley were cut with sickles, threshed, winnowed, sorted, and carefully stored. It was also the season for gathering fruit, cherries, plums, berries, and drying it for winter. September meant grape harvests in the wine regions, careful sewing of winter wheat and rye, and driving pigs into the oak and beach forests to fatten on acorns and nuts. October and November were busy with more sewing, cattle slaughtering, preserving food stores, and processing flax into linen. December was marked by the major winter event, pig slaughtering. Families came together to butcher salt, smoke, and dry meat into sausages, bacon, and hams that would last the cold months. Villagers gathered at the communal oven for bread baking days. While at home, women and children worked at weaving, sewing, patching clothes, and spinning wool. This tightly ordered seasonal rhythm shows how medieval life was deeply shaped by the cycles of farming, livestock care, and village cooperation. From the outside, nobles and clergy saw peasants as the lowest social rank. But in truth, there was no such thing as a simple peasant. Within rural life existed clear social layers, fulling farmers, halfholders, cottages, day laborers, servants, and maids, all with distinct roles, rights, and status. Across all the chapters of this rural world, it becomes clear that the Middle Ages were not an era of dull simplicity. Farmers practiced complex crafts, worked in cooperatives, maintained sophisticated legal and community systems, nurtured a rich cultural life, and sustained a diverse food economy. Even in times of severe hardship during famines, pestilence, or environmental disasters, they showed remarkable adaptability and resilience. Agriculture dominated medieval Europe with around 90% of the population working the land. Farm production supported the building of cathedrals, monasteries, schools, and noble estates, while technical innovations in the high middle ages from the heavy plow to the three field system dramatically increased yields. Rural settlement shifted from scattered farms to permanent villages shaped by the memorial system where peasants worked under the Lord's authority but still held important communal rights. Over the centuries, farmers faced cycles of growth and crisis. The agricultural boom of the high middle ages gave way to the crises of the 14th century. soil exhaustion, flooding, famine, and the Black Death, which decimated populations and forced a reshuffleling of labor and landholding systems. Yet through it all, rural families remained the backbone of European life. They raised vegetables, kept animals, crafted their own tools and clothing, prepared varied meals, celebrated festivals, and preserved songs, rituals, and stories. Far from passive or primitive, these communities demonstrated a deep and lasting ability to organize, innovate, and survive. living every year by the seasons, the soil, and the strength of the village around them.",
