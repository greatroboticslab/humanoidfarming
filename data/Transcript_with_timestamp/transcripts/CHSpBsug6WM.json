  "text": "hey uh my name is Jim Horman and we're going to talk about the biology of soil competion we've had a few problems here this morning but I understand this may go off at noon so I'm going to speed it up just a little bit you know when we talk about ideal soil composition uh roughly 50% of the the soil is what we call solid material about 45% of that is the mineral portion and in an ideal soil we have about 5% organic matter a lot of farmers don't know this but uh as much as 50% of the soil can actually be PO space however when we compact the soil uh a lot of times we don't have that much so let's take a look at a compacted soil look at some different bulk densities if you look at an uncultivated undisturbed wood lot typically the bulk density is anywhere from one to 1.2 grams per a centimeter cubed and and what we're looking at is we're looking at the weight uh uh and basically the weight over a volume of of soil and so that would be ideal if we had 1.2 gram per centimeter cubed that would be an ideal soil we have about 50% uh Poe space in that but as we get into cultivated Clays and cultivated Sandy loms you'll notice that the bulk density increases and that means we have less room for air and water to move and so if you look on my right hand side there at the bottom once we reach a bulk density of 1.6 grams per cimeter cubed it starts to become root limiting that's somewhere around 250 pounds per square inch we get up to 1.8 and then the roots are totally restricted and you can't you uh The Roots can't get through there so that's real important on a lot of our soils we're actually uh limiting the roots and how deep they can go so let's take a look at at what is typical in our soils we generally talk about the plow layer and this may be anywhere from 7 to 8 to 9 Ines deep and you'll notice that we have as we light as we plow that soil uh the buk density goes down it's like around 1.4 and then we reach this limiting layer there about seven eight nine inches deep where it's very hard for the roots to get through the soil we've seen this in almost all the soils that we've we've looked at uh there's a a limiting layer there and a lot of times especially on corn Roots they'll go off at a right hand angle also on soybeans so what we're doing with the cover crops and the noil as we're trying to break up these compaction zones the very fine Roots can get through uh ples of weakness and they can uh decrease that bulk density so that uh uh our main crop the green crops can get deeper into the soil to get moisture and also nutrients soil organic matter if you look at some of the characteristics why we want to increase soil organic matter contact look at the bulk density of soil organic matter it's about 6 compared to say 1.45 somewhere in that range for where we have a tiled soil so soil organic matter has less density in the soil has more room and more space for air and water storage and here's an important characteristic every pound of so organic matter can hold 18 to 20 pounds of water that's why we like to say that s organic matter acts like a sponge and here's a a picture of that you can see the little black areas in there if you look at s organ matter uh it's it's not nearly as dense the color tends to be light to dark brown and it has room to store water and also to store uh nutrients you also notice that the surface area is is quite large so that allows uh water to get trapped uh in between those particles it also gives structure to our soils when we looked at a compacted soil uh the density could be between 1.6 to 1.8 compacted soils kind of have have a much higher density less room for air and water storage they tend to act like roads or Road payment they a lot of times result in flash floods it was interesting this year we had a drought we had a couple of onein rains but the majority of that water ran off the soil surface even though the soil was extremely dry it's because we turn that soil into Road payment I like to say we turn it in whenever you do excessively till the soil you turn it into a road payment we've all probably seen a farmer maybe your neighbor really till the soil what happens when they till it and get it very fine as soon as it rains it turns into concrete and so dense soils also have less microbial life and that's really important for nutrient management here's an electron microscope of some of the clay minerals this is where the the water and the nutrients can be trapped generally um this clay mineral will put in organic film around there and the nutrients get trapped in between the soil organic matter and and the minerals that are in the soil three soil compaction factors we all know that heavy equipment uh due to its weight will compact the soil but did you know that rain and gravity will also compact the soil we can have rainfall uh when it comes down it can reach a terminal velocity of 35 miles hour and almost looks like a any uh nuclear explosion when it goes off so that can move Soil and Water but it also tends to have a compacting factor is there a visual way to measure soil compaction and actually you can go on your farm and you can probably see this uh if you look at a fence row and look at the elevation difference between your field and where that fence row is we've measured this in Ohio some said that this was due to wind others said that uh uh a lot of the soil had eroded and uh had piled up in a wind R but actually we've measured this on the Le side of a uh woods and we saw anywhere from a 6 to 9 inch elevation difference if 50% of that is void space that equals an additional three to four and a half inches of additional water that we could store uh in that soil if you really want to see this if you've got a a wooded area you can see the difference here in northwest Ohio uh a lot of times the woods is uh the woods that we had were actually uh very low and uh that's where the water stood now often the water is standing on the Headlands uh and we can see water standing there it's because that soil is much more compacted here's the water available uh the available water capacity of soil organic matter that first inch of additional soil organic matter can gain you anywhere from one to almost two Ines of additional water if we get it up to 5 in or 5% soil organic matter you can see we're gaining on a sandy soil 2.5 on a Cy Loom four inches and on a Cy clay Loom three inches of additional water so it starts off at one to two inches of water per foot of soil and after we get up to about 5% organic matter we're down to about a half 2.8 uh inches of additional water for for every 1% organic matter that we're adding to that soil this is extremely important in dry weather or in climates that don't have uh a lot of uh uh rainfall here's what happens we've talked about this where we've got a compacted or killed soil it tends to set up like the road where we have good vegetation throughout the the year we increase that por space so it slows down the water runoff and it increases water infiltration here's what happens if we speed up or double the velocity of water the relationship is two to the six power for every time you double the velocity of water this tells you how many more nutrients that that water can carry the faster the water flows the more energy it has so if I go from one to two mile per hour I can carry 64 times more nutrients if I get up to 16 to 32 mile per hour in a flowing stream I can carry a thousand times more nutrients with that water so what we're trying to do now is we're trying to slow the water down so that it drops its load keeps the nutrients in the soil rather than running off we have a lot of problems with hypoxia and nutrification hypoxia is too much nitrogen and phosphorus getting into uh the Gulf of Mexico nutrification is mainly where we've got too much phosphorus causing a lot of uh algae wounds for water uptake if you're looking at where the roots absorb most of the uh water it's in that top half if you look at each one of these lines is about six inches so 40% of the water uh by that plant is absorbed within the top six inches the next six inches will absorb about 30% so 70% of the of the water is absorbed in the top foot this kind of explains why corn can actually do quite well with maybe only 8 to nine inches of rooting depth before the roots start going off a right hand angle it actually has almost 70% of the water but if we can get those roots to go a little bit deeper especially in a dry year we can gain another 20 to to as much as 30% more water as we get into that subsoil same thing goes for nutrient extraction exact same relationship 40 30 20 and 10 and you can see the depths there so the same relationship also when we look at a soil there's a big difference between no tail with the cover crop where we have live plants notice the temperature difference it's about 87 to 85 degrees over here where we have conventional and maybe we have started to try to do no till you'll see that there's at least a 20 to maybe as much as a 30 uh degree increase in the temperatures this year when we had a drought here in Ohio we measure soil temperatures up around 130 to as high as 140 degrees Fahrenheit and what impact does that have notice here the soil bacteria start to die at 140 degrees Fahrenheit we get our best moisture somewhere where the soil is around 70 to 95 degrees once it gets over 95 notice we're only using at 100 degrees Fahrenheit 15% of the moisture is used for growth 85% of the moisture is lost through evaporation and transpiration so if we can keep that soil covered with live plants and keep a nice layer of residue on there we can conserve moisture and that's the key thing that I wanted to talk to you about also for hot dry Summers how much more water do we need when the temperature goes up at 75 degrees Fahrenheit we need about one inch of water per week raise that by 10 degrees we need two inches raise that by another 10 inches and now we're up to four inches of water a week so your water requirements double for every 10 Dee increase in temperature heat and drought together they're linked together they quickly increase yield losses in your soil this information came from Dr elwin Taylor out of Iowa if we look at the soil and look what's going on when we do subsoil tillage where we ex add an extremely large amount of oxygen into the soil it acts like a furnace almost like a wood stove you might say adding oxygen to the soil actually causes the soil organic matter to go up into the atmosphere so we start to lose soil organic matters and the more aggressive your tillage the more soil organic matter losses you're having matter of fact in the last uh 15 25 years once tillage starts you'll see that you will lose uh as much as 50% organic matter in some places we've seen as much as 6% losses in soil organic matter notice though that once we started doing permanent side and adding we can start to add organic matter back to that soil but you notice that we didn't reach the same level you might want to think about that why didn't we get back up to where we were and the answer to that is quite simple it has to do with the amount of roots and how tall we let that grass grow we tend on our permanent sides will cut off uh the top growth top growth is related to root growth the more root growth you have the more healthy that plant is the more organic matter you're going to add to your soil matter of fact most of the organic matter in the soil comes from the roots as much as 65 to 70% of the organic matter comes from Roots so the more Roots we get into the soil the higher Are soil organic matter levels let's talk a little bit about compaction here's the typical tire and you'll notice as you're putting weight on that soil the forces are down and then what actually happens is the soil uh moves to the side and we'll actually get uh kind of a lip there around that r you'll see that the soil is actually forced uh upward and so what happens then if we take say a disc and we try to take that lip off and we try to fill in that hole you always notice when when this happens that you never quite fill it in and why is that because we're losing the void space when you break up the soil and you lose all your soil structure you have less room for air and water and so what we're doing is we're breaking this soil down and the mineral portion uh is very solid very dense and so what we need to do is now lift it up uh and keep it in shape we need to have better soil structure and one of the ways we can do that is with a root you might see this root here it's expanding the soil where that uh man is pointing you'll notice that when this big oil seed radish these can get as big as your leg and get anywhere from three to four feet deep in the soil although mostly the tuber is at the soil surface but it does is as it goes down and it expands it's forcing the soil down forcing it to the side and it's physically lifting it and so what Roots actually do is they actually compact the soil but they reate uh reorientate the uh clay particles and then what they do is they form Aggregates so we're going to take some of the polysaccarides and the exodites that come from these roots and we're going to form uh nice aggregates which will um give us some structure back to our soil so that our soil doesn't collapse on us and it's not quite as dense here's what the bacteria do 90% of the bacteria are linked to the clay uh 40 to 60% of the soil microbial biomass is associated with this clay and that's how we form something called a ma a microaggregate and what we do is we take these microaggregates which are less than 250 microns and we're going to form macroaggregates now if you want to know what a macroaggregate looks like when you go home just take your shovel in your lawn dig up some soil uh in your lawn and then Shake uh the the turf a little bit and you'll see these what I'd say p siiz small pieces almost the size of a small piece of gravel little pads those are the macroaggregates that are forming so what we're doing is we're allowing that soil to start to set up so it has more structure so it has more room for air and water and and by that by doing that we can store more uh air and water in that soil and it's less dense and one of the key uh uh fungus that we have in the soil are these micral fungus they actually infect 80 percent of our plants and they give off something called gloman or glomulin some people call it that's what gives us some of the uh glycoproteins and and some of the it's a structure that helps to cement soil together to form these U macroaggregates and here's what microp fungus look like you'll notice on the top we have this brown uh root the um the fungus are actually either white or yellow and in a handful of soil we can have as much as 20 to 25 miles of these filaments going into the soil what these fungus do is they bring back water nitrogen and phosphorus to the plant in exchange the plant is going to feed that micro risia some of its carbohydrates as much as 25 to 40% of the total carbohydrate reserves in the root go to feed these fungus if they're available it's a very beneficial relationship and then when these fungus die they give off U the this glomulin that's inside their cell structure it's kind of sticky it's kind of like a glue that helps to glue our soils together so we want to keep these micro risia healthy they need to have live plants ear round in order to do that killage and excess fertilizer tend to kill off the micro rizio fungus and here's what happens this shows that sticky substance being surrounded it surrounds uh those soil particles and that's what gives us those nice macroaggregates that we were talking about building soil structures like building a house uh it starts with other nature we've our Carpenter is our plants and we're going to start with this sand silt and Clay the roots are kind of like how we would frame up a house um some of the nails and the lag screws uh this humus is very hard very tough It's been around for hundreds thousands of years it's been broken down so it sticks around but what we're really uh lacking in the soil is some of that gluman or some of that active carbon some of the polysaccharides are missing the nitrogen offer also act like braces and then that surface residue that's kind of like the roof on your house so here's a picture of a house and see how we start let's take a look at how we build this out we start off with the foundation we add the wood and so look around the room where you're maybe you're sitting at notice that there's a lot of space in in a building like this or in a house the reason we have that is because the wood or the soil organic matter in the soil is giving structure and the nitrogen and the sulfur are acting like bra and now we've got room for air and water to move the black screws i' like to say is how soil organic matter attaches to the clay particles and a lot of times we'll have phosphorus we'll have some other uh nutrients in between there that will give uh that'll attach that clay particle and that organic matter together the humus again is like nails and then this glomulin kind of acts like the glue or house wrap it helps to insulate this house and then the roof uh is is uh uh helps to keep on a roof on a house will help to keep out water what's interesting in the soil the roof actually acts to help keep out too much oxygen imagine what would happen if we had a tornado come through on your house and every other year took your roof off we get too much water in there and that water would start to rot out uh the the wood and pretty soon this whole house would cave in in the soil if we get rid of the residue we get too much oxygen into the soil and it burns up the soil organic matter and the whole house starts to Compact and starts to Decay and everything falls in it works the exact same way uh in the soil too much oxygen uh oxygen and carbon dioxide are um uh opposed to each other when one increases the other decreases so carbon dioxide is heavier than the oxygen so they're inversely related so if we get a heavy rain where we have a microaggregate you're not going to get as much water infiltration and a lot of the water will run off one of the things that farmers have talked to me about is saying you know I've been in noil for five or 10 years and some farmers will say that my soils are cold and wet other Farmers who've been in noil will say my soils are warm and moist so which one is right actually let's take a look at this probably when you started into noil did you get rid of of all the soil compaction and so that's probably one of the reasons why our soils are cold compacted soils hold more moisture so coming out of the winter we're going to have water which holds the cold it hold the cold and the Heat and so your soils will tend to be wet and they'll also tend to be cold as you start to get into no till and you start to break up that soil and get more macro pores to get the water to drain from your soils that soil will start to warm up quicker matter of fact you've probably seen this in your own home window panes a lot of times are triple uh double or triple and they use air as an insulation so now when you start going let's say you've been in notel for one to two years we're starting to get more residue at the surface what is the color of residue when it breaks down it actually turns black and does black surfaces warm up the soil or do they cause it to get colder they tend to draw Heat and so they'll actually help to warm up the soil so as we get more residue on top the soil your soils will start to warm up and then as you get a thick layer residue a lot of farmers think that this is not a good thing but it actually is what happens is think about a compost pile if I have one to two inches of residue on my soil surface what happens in the middle of that compost pile there's biological activity and that will actually warm up the soil most farmers who are doing doing no till with cover crops are fighting to keep residue they have so much microbial activity and so many earthworms they're are actually fighting to keep the residue rather than trying to break it up if you're having a hard time with residue if it's causing problems to your tires we see a lot of that here in Ohio chances are that you don't have a lot of microbial activity or a lot of Earth wors in your soil and you need to make it get your soil more healthy here's where we're measuring soil compaction we can actually do this uh in the field and we're finding out that right next to that route uh the soil compaction levels uh decrease by as much as 30% why do our soils compact well look at your crop rotation typically we uh at least here in Ohio we're drilling most of our soybeans drilled soybeans are planted very close together they have a very poor root system I would rather see soybeans planted in 15inch rows or spaced a little wider apart they have a much healthier root system and they can help to break up some of this soil compaction also if you look at corn it has a very thick root and it tends to be limited by the plow layer we saw that in Minnesota last year we visited Minnesota their plow layer was down there about eight inches deep that's where they plowed every year those roots could not get through them even though they had beautiful soils they were only reaching about 125 to 140 bushel corn y that's some of the prettiest soils I've ever seen dark rich black but the soil was compacted so that was limiting their yields what percentage of the time do we have live Roots typically in a corn soybean rotation only maybe four months out of the year maybe as much as five months about onethird of the time if we can add a cover crop to that we can greatly increase the amount of soil organic matter that we have in the soil and one of the things that people have asked me is why does no tail really have more live Roots than conventional pillage the answer is not really it's not until you add the cover crop that we start to gain soil organic matter so what's missing in noil is those live Roots soil compaction is a biological problem it's related to a lack of living Roots uh in the soil so I've got about 15 minutes left let's start looking at some things that we can do to get rid of this soil compaction so if we're looking at subsoiling here's some research that was done uh in Ohio subsoiling yield gains or losses if you have conventional tillage with subsoiling we found out that the corn yield gained about one to three bushel or about 3% about a 3 percentage increase on soybean yields it was just a little bit more we gained anywhere from two to five bushels or about a 10% yield increase what happened when we had long-term noil it actually went the other way by the same amount our corn yield loss we lost anywhere from one to three bushel or about 3% so being uh yield losses were around 10% so what does subsoiling do if we're comparing subsoiling versus covered crops uh the subsoiler what does it do it gives you immediate change in soil structure is down as deep as what you're going to subsoil it if you're going down eight inches deep however those changes are not permanent and it actually leads to Greater Reliance on tillage in the future because we're losing that soil organic matter it will increase infiltration in that top 18 Ines because you're fluffing up the soil it leaves the soil susceptible to compaction later the first trip across that field you're going to compact that soil 80% of that soil will Rec compact almost immediately with the first trip what can cover crops do well the change is a little bit slower but it's a little deeper we can go three feet deep or even deeper with really deep rooted cover crops and fil uh increases the infiltration but it may take a little bit of time generally cover crop Roots can go through about one foot of soil of compacted soils per year so if you have a very heavily compacted soil it may take a little bit of a Time think about your grain carts and your uh uh your uh combines a typical combine's going to compact that soil 18 inches deep about 26 tons of of uh compaction for axle load it'll compact it down to8 inches deep one of the things that cover crops do is they protect the soil from erosion they add nutrients in organic matter they tie up the nutrients they fit into a continuous noil system they really make the noil work much better and they help to protect against soil conection if you want to think about this just imagine if you had two bricks and you put a sponge in between them what happens is as you add organic matter if you were to compress the those bricks them bricks would come back apart the sponge helps to uh alleviate some of that compaction it doesn't allow those bricks to get too close together so if you're imagine These Bricks bricks are made out of clay they have a negative charge if we take these two bricks and we get rid of the organic matter now you've put a positive ion in between there something like calcium or potash that's going to set that uh those two bricks up and it's going to set up like a brick wall that's what happens I like to call it cement mix that's what happens when we till the soil excessively we need that organic matter in there to con cushion the soil here's some of the soil resistance and here's the rankings and we'll start from the bottom I'm going to go back subsoiling deep RI full surface tillage you're adding a lot of oxygen into that soil it will help you but the problem is it's a short-term solution we can mboard plow or chisel plow and then when we finally uh will create a fine um seed bed but the problem is again the more you disturb the soil the more organic matter you're losing is and so you're going to be dependent on that system year after year after year we can subsoil with white Spanx uh space Shanks and that will help so we're not doing quite as much disturbance we can get into strip till where we only K up just a small portion of the field and then we leave the rest of the field untouched and that will help we can do shallow tillage things like the airway and the Phoenix hero a lot of people call this vertical tillage the problem with this is now we've changed our compaction layer we've seen this time and time again as we do the shallow tillage your your compaction layer rather than being 8 to nine inches deep now may be only two three four inches deep however far that you go down the bottom of that tool creates a compacted Zone we can do intermittent uh intermittent not till which is tillage every other year typically in a corn soybean rotation they might till the soybeans and then go to Corn because the corn has such a thick root it really benefits from having well a rated soils or we can start to go to continuous noow tail where we get light residue on the soil again now we're building up that organic matter we'll have less compaction we get more residue that's bever with no cover crop once we add the cover crop now we're starting to cushion that soil and then the best situation is where we have continuous noow till cover crop and control traffic now we're limiting uh that zone that we're compacting to a very small portion of the field and if we do that year after year uh now we can make uh our soils much healthier and have a lot less compaction how to establish cover crops uh add diversity to your soils you can reduce your crop maturities basically on corn we're looking at a shorter maturity if you can reduce that by 5 to seven days that will really help you we can also grow soybeans grow an earlier maturing soybean one of the key points uh is we need to give that cover crop time to uh establish before winter sets in most cover crops need anywhere from 60 to 90 days of growth and so one of the ways we can do that is we can intercede we can either fly it on or broadcast it a lot of our Farmers uh are now um investing in these Highway applic they have a 90 foot boom on them and they're using an air seeder with drop- down tubes that they'll go in between the corn and they can seed cover crops uh into their corn or even into their soybeans and get them started and then when they harvest them a lot of times these cover crops may be two three inches tall starting to grow that gives them a head start going into winter when you let that cover crop grow longer in the spring and intercede uh our next crop into it we'd like to do this with uh soy beans we'll use cereal Rye we'll let that cereal Rye grow in the fall let it grow in the spring uh in Ohio we have a problem with excess moisture so if we let it grow it uh through respiration it will allow a lot of that uh uh through transpiration it will allow a lot of that water to uh uh get out of the soil by by putting it up into the atmosphere so we can actually get onto our Fields anywhere from seven to 10 days earlier we let the cereal Rye grow up plant our soybeans into it let the soybeans come up then kill the cereal Rye if we kill the cereal ride too early it'll lay down and then if we have some uh wet weather that soil will stay real sticky and then it may not dry out till uh late June or even July so what we like to do is let it grow up either drill or plant our soybeans or uh into that cereal Rye it will not uh hair as much and it won't tend to bind uh as much and so it's much easier to do that we can also use legumes uh things like uh winter peas or um crimson clover and we'll plant those with oil seed radish and do that before corn and that's been very very successful we've seen as much as six to eight bushel yield increases on our soybeans and with our corn uh uh varies quite a bit depending on how good your soil structure is but we're seeing uh 10 15 bushel sometimes even more yield increases by doing this practice here's some of the best cover crops to fight soil compaction grasses have a very fibrous root system I'm a real big fan of soron sedan grass uh you can let your sorum sedan grass grow a little bit uh in Ohio we tend to plant it after wheat our wheat we have winter wheat so our wheat will come off in July we plant the Sorghum sedan grass if you can let that sorum sedan grass get about 3 feet tall and either Harvest it in some cases guys don't have livestock so they'll just mow it off when you mow sorum sedan grass you get anywhere from five to nine times more Roots being grown and so it really tillers out and it's all about roots in the soil that really helps to keep your soil really gives good soil structure to your soil annual Ry grass is another really good one it can be a little harder to manage cereal Ryan oats can also be used uh very fine Roots they can find those Plains of weaknesses they can really help you with soil compaction they also go uh fairly deep in the soil anual white grass will go five to six feet deep uh unless there's H water or limiting layer seral Rye tends to go about 30 to 36 inches in uh similar numbers for oats we can also use Z brascas things like the oil seed radish or the turnips oil seed radish especially the some of the uh uh daon varieties such as um um tillage radish or the groundhouse radish they get a fairly good size root system they're white they're very sweet the earthworms absolutely love them and uh they do a very good job in loosening up soil matter of fact if you're going to plant oil seed radish never plant them by themselves on a hill with greater than a 3% slope we've actually seen some of the uh soil on these slopes start to move with if you get a heavy rainfall we like to um plant them with another grass or plant them with another legume uh to get more roots and to have more biomaster for legumes uh you want a large root Network hary vet cow peas red clover and winter peas are some of the ones that we're using that gives you the relationship if you've got a problem with surface compaction buckweed is excellent and also filia that's a new uh one that came out of France uh they work quite well buckweed is very beneficial for insects and it also helps if you have low phosphorus uh it has a lot of organic acids in it so it will release phosphorus into the soil so if we're looking at U and I'm I'm getting low on time so I'm going to go through this fairly quickly I've got about six more slides if you look at the New Concept that we're looking at we're calling it Eco faring or ecological farming we're trying to keep uh the soil covered with live plants year round again if you only have plants out there four month side of the year you only have about a third as much fuel and energy going into that soil the plants give energy to the microbes and the microbes keep those nutrients recycling it also improves your soil if we can keep those year round we've got 100% of the fuel and energy going into that soil here's what happens under conventional tillage you have a smaller microbial population we've got this brown combine Rusty combine you notice we have a lot of carbon dioxide going up into the atmosphere here where we have the eco-farming we're not disturbing the soil we have a much larger microbial population and they're going to keep more nitrogen and phosphorus recycling in the soil and here's the relationship every 1% organic matter can give you as much as $850 of nutrients that's going to tie up per year a th000 pounds of nitrogen and roughly 100 pounds of phosphorus poach and sulfur that adds up to about $850 for every 1% soil organic matter how do we lose these well when we do tillage you'll see these whirlwinds there that's the carbon dioxide going on and you'll notice that we we can't tie up as much of the uh nitrogen and the phosphorus because we have less organic matter in the soil uh anywhere from 50 to 75% of the phosphorus is tied up organically and right around 90% of the nitrogen is tied up in an organic form here where we're doing the eco-farming we're carrying those nutrients forward these plants that are alive in the winter even though the soil may be cold uh it's much warmer down below it be around 50 degrees there they can uh below the frost line they can actually take up nutrients all winter long and they're turning that into H soil organic matter something that will turn into here's what happens when U we do too much tillage tillage to the soil microbes is like the worst hurricane the worst Earth Quake worst Force fire and the worst tornado all wrapped up into one event it really disturbs them they don't like to have uh this disturbance you'll have a much healthier microbial population if you uh uh stop doing the tillage and where do we lose these nutrients most of them are lost in the winter they're lost to the air and the water because we don't have plant roofs there to absorb them so a lot of times in late winter early spring with the snow melt a lot of the nutrients are lost here where we have the Eco farming we're keeping those nutrients tied up and we're carrying them forward to the next crop finally in summary I think I might uh might have a minute or two for uh questions soil compaction is related to the biology of the soil and how the soil was managed organic matter and microbes influence soil compaction if you have cold no till soils it's probably a result of soil compaction and poor soil structure if you can add cover crops and no tilt to that system you'll actually uh improve your your soils and they should be warm and moist that's an ideal place to plant corn and soybeans active living roots and the microbes are acting and working together to improve your soil structure that equals this ecological farming that we're really promoting notel Plus cover crops so I think I have maybe a minute to go we may get cut off any questions I did that pretty quick that's about as fast as I've done that so uh if we get cut off that's fine all right well sorry for some of the technical problems we had and delays but uh hope you guys enjoy your conference can somebody tell me about how many people we have there 230 well great I wish I could be with you but okay I'll see if I can answer it hello how do we get cover crops to grow all year I is that what you're talking about okay one of the one of the benefits as you go a little further further north is especially serial Rye it originated in uh the mountains of China those roots are active all year round even though they may not be growing snow actually protects a lot of our cover crops you may have a much more beneficial growth to some of these cover crops what's really detrimental to cover crops is the wind and so if you can protect that um that the crown of these cover crops and keep some residue over there even though it looks like they're not doing you may not see a whole lot of top growth they can do a lot of benefit from just the roots growing down through the soil serial Rye is a a really good one uh after corn uh probably in South Dakota I mean it grows uh up into Canada so that's probably one of your best ones other questions oh well good sure we can do that okay in a dry spring yes there can be um and what you want to do is if you have a dry spring and you see that it's that you're going to go into a drought you want to conserve moisture uh what you want to do is you want to build your organic matter but you don't want to hurt that next crop so and it's hard to predict this but if you see that the soil is is excessively dry and you're getting a lot of uh transpiration going on you can kill that cover crop early you guys don't have as much problem here in Ohio we have seven out of 10 years it's wet and so we're trying to dry out our soils you probably need to manage your soils a little differently you might want to kill that cover crop uh uh early and in order to conserve moisture and then plant into it uh when the conditions are right but uh it should make the soil much more mellow uh that's at least what we've seen here Ohio especially when we're using these oil seed radish we used to worry about we'd have too big of a hole there but you'll also find and I didn't tell you this covered crops will give you more moisture because you're going to trap more snow uh we've seen this time and time again if you put up it's almost like a a snow fence it it traps the snow on the soil so it's not blowing across your fields and you'll actually gain some uh moisture by having a a cover crop that's maybe a couple inches tall it'll trap that snow there and you'll gain uh basically what you're losing all the recent uh information that's come out says that cover crops uh are really adding uh water to the soil and even though we're losing some from transpiration if we see that that's a problem just kill them early does that make sense oh well I I I'll tell you a quick one until we get cut off here a story from Nebraska we had some guys this idea of phow soils that's the stupidest idea we ever come up that's my personal opinion I'm just going to tell you that uh in Nebraska some guys started doing noil long-term noil with cover crops they found out that they were they were using two feet of irrigation per year they reduced it down to six in per year by going to Noel and cover crops the reason being is they were trapping more snow and they were adding organic matter to their soil so now they can store more uh more water remember that that chart that I give you was the inches of water per foot of soil so if you can get these cover crops to go very deep into the soil and add a couple percentage points of organic matter to each foot of soil you can greatly increase your water storage capacity and then if you have that residue on the surface you're not going to have as much heat you're not going to have as much uh evaporation going on you're going to store a lot more water in your soil rain makes grain but that also uh going along with that uh ex uh more water holding capacity in your soil is going to equal higher yields uh I wish I could be with you folks but uh I've got another meeting here in Ohio yet ton night that I have to do so uh thank you for inviting me it's been a pleasure thank you",
