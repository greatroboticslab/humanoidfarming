my mama

00:00:05,700 --> 00:00:11,400
meet Winnie wangoi a polti farmer from

3
00:00:08,820 --> 00:00:13,740
juja in kiambu County one of the urban

4
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:18,080
and Perry urban areas in Kenya where

5
00:00:13,740 --> 00:00:18,080
poultry farming is growing rapidly

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:22,740
Winnie is one of 50 pilot Farmers

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,779
involved in the practice and behavior

8
00:00:22,740 --> 00:00:27,240
study by the food and agriculture

9
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:30,480
organization a few under the Africa's

10
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,960
sustainable livestock 2050 funded by the

11
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,899
usaid I met foul like three years ago

12
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:40,379
and I have gone to their seminars

13
00:00:36,899 --> 00:00:43,920
several of them many in Nairobi and

14
00:00:40,379 --> 00:00:47,100
others in machakos and the Really insist

15
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:49,379
on proper practices on preparing of my

16
00:00:47,100 --> 00:00:51,260
chicken up to the time I take them to

17
00:00:49,379 --> 00:00:54,360
the market this project

18
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:57,420
called an Africa sustainable livestock

19
00:00:54,360 --> 00:01:00,960
are trying to safeguard Public Health

20
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:02,399
about emerging infectious diseases and

21
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:05,220
some of these diseases are coming from

22
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,439
livestock and into humans from the study

23
00:01:05,220 --> 00:01:09,420
it was noted that stakeholders tend more

24
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,280
to adopt practices that are anticipated

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:14,640
to have a positive impact on their

26
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:17,460
business such as vaccination

27
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,380
change this a checklist was developed

28
00:01:17,460 --> 00:01:21,360
jointly with County and National

29
00:01:19,380 --> 00:01:24,000
veterinary services with priority

30
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,799
biosecurity practices that could lead to

31
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,200
the reduction of emerging zoonotic

32
00:01:25,799 --> 00:01:31,259
diseases such as salmonella and to

33
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,420
mitigate antimicrobial resistance that

34
00:01:31,259 --> 00:01:38,360
checklist formed our basis of

35
00:01:33,420 --> 00:01:38,360
sensitizing and training all the actors

36
00:01:42,420 --> 00:01:45,420
foreign

37
00:02:16,760 --> 00:02:23,340
area and the dirty area but after

38
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:27,080
training tuna separated the

39
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:29,000
feelings and the capacities

40
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:32,840
separately

41
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:32,840
certificate at least

42
00:02:34,760 --> 00:02:41,760
with our training there's been reduced

43
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:44,640
mortalities within their throats the

44
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,140
banks also gain the slaughter weight

45
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:49,019
faster

46
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:50,640
and this gives them good money although

47
00:02:49,019 --> 00:02:53,160
they lose governing the poultry value

48
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:56,640
chain business in Kenya there exists

49
00:02:53,160 --> 00:03:00,260
notable gaps but the ammunition has not

50
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:00,260
been very good in the future

51
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:12,060

52
00:03:09,040 --> 00:03:14,659
