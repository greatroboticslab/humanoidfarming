  "text": "my name is Zach buckle and I run a Halfacre vegetable farm that's projected to produce $100,000 worth of vegetables this year and I don't actually like gardening I used to love it and I still love certain parts of growing vegetables but I spend 40 hours of my week growing vegetables for other people so when it comes to gardening having a smaller space SP in my backyard where I get to grow whatever I want my passion is just not what it used to be so I don't really like spending a lot of time watering weeding planting seeding doing the whole romantic aspect of gardening that people talk about so because of my lifestyle right now I try to automate as much as possible and and spend as little time in the garden as possible because really when it comes down to it all I want to do is eat delicious vegetables that I grew myself and be around pretty plants as much as possible I don't want to deal with all the maintenance and work involved in creating that stuff this season I spent very little time in the garden basically because I had to spend very little time in the garden because I originally planned on turning this very bad into a food factory to make all sorts of fun videos explaining gardening techniques that are very similar to my farming techniques uh but the reality is I had almost no employees from March through July um I didn't really get employees on the farm until about mid July and that's a whole long story but I was exhausted just didn't have the energy to come in here and lift a finger I even looking at a plant growing was depressing to me because I had so many other fires to put out on the farm um especially any kind of weeds or anything like that because honestly the weeds in here are nothing compared to what I was dealing with on the farm I had literally whole beds full of dandelions I was digging out and my back was killing me I was literally bedridden uh for days um just because I was doing all the work myself and that just kills a lot of your motivation for doing this kind of stuff but the cool thing is I sort of took track of what was actually in this bed a couple weeks ago and there's still 36 pounds of food that came out of this bed and I didn't do anything my mom came out here and watered once a week for about 2 hours using this sprinkler this wobbler sprinkler and might have pulled a few weeds here and there but other than that there's nothing that happened and this bed's a disaster to be honest there's so many things that went wrong here I planted it I spent about 20 minutes planting it in June and then I just forgot about it because I just didn't have time or motivation and so this was supposed to be filled with carrots right now and turnips and there's nothing but all of the stuff that I planted in here like the scale the broccoli cauliflower still has a bunch of weight right there and there's celery and uh green onions and stuff behind me there's still a truckload of food there's actually probably a lot more than 36 pounds in here and I did a video explaining what I mean by 36 pounds but I mean I basically spent an hour of my time this whole season managing this bed and that's what happened I think that's a pretty good result um and that all comes down to the style of gardening that I teach in my gardening course Link in the description on that but it just actually turned out to be really cool because it proves how little effort you need to put into a garden to really produce a lot of food you just got to set it up right and use a couple of fun tools and gadgets that I'm going to go over in this video so one of the reasons why I was able to spend zero time in the garden and still get a good result was because my mom was watering every week but if I didn't have myom mom this could do the same thing this is the raino two Zone automatic water timer battery operated and this could basically do the same thing as what my mom did I just got this thing and I set it up and I didn't even look at the manual and I figured out how to use it in about five minutes which is actually a big deal because I've used much fancier water timers on the Farm I am using much fancier ones on the farm and it take me about a half an hour to figure out how to use them because they're much more complicated watering schedules and stuff and I had to read the manual on those this is amazing because all I had to do is figure out how all these buttons work and it's real simple there's two zones you could use on this um I'm only using one cuz I don't have drip irrigation set up here but so this is set up just for our wobbler sprinkler but I set this for um 2 hours once a week and it's very easy to do this um like I said I didn't even use the manual but you could set it to uh two different zones so said you say if you had uh drip tape along flowers next door you could set those onto a different time and I'm not going to go over gory details on how to do this they have great stuff on their website um and how to set it up but it's very easy I mean compared to the one I use on the farm it is lightyears easier they actually come with um Teflon tape to uh make your seal leak proof which is a big deal I love using Teflon tape on the farm for all of my Plumbing I pretty much end up using that more often than not on all of my fittings because especially with plastic fittings cuz plastic fittings generally fail and have terrible leaking problems so including teon tape is a big deal um I actually had to switch to a brass fitting for the fancy water timer I use on the farm so it's nice to have that Teflon tape and uh the bottom line is with this tool is you can walk away from the farm for a long time and by Farm I mean your backyard farm AKA a garden uh I use farm and garden pretty much interchangeably um English is a funny language but uh it's a constantly evolving language but anyway the cool thing about this is you could set it and forget it and with all things like that you know it you you take that with a grain of Sal you're still going to need to check the batteries and stuff all this takes is two AAA batteries I'm sure you're going to need to check those every once in a while but bottom line is you can set it and forget it and not have to worry about watering because if I was to hand waterer this Garden it takes about 20 minutes to a half an hour of my time and you know my time is pretty valuable right now in my life if you've got a family with kids 20 minutes half an hour a week could be a lot so this saves that time for you and it does it right the thing I love about watering with the sprinkler is when you set up a wobbler sprinkler like we have in the garden it Waters so evenly but it takes a long time you can't do that you know watering by hand you almost never do it right because you don't want to sit there for 20 minutes on one plant to make sure that water seeps in deep in the ground you know the best way to water is to water very deeply and infrequently and so this allows it to happen really really easily because even when you do it manually if you do it for two hours you got to come out here turn it on come out here and turn it off that's two times you got to walk out here and if your garden is you know 300 yards away from your house that's kind of annoying and the easier it is for you to water the more likely you are to do it and so a rain Point water timer like this is a really simple way to make that happen um it's something that you got to have in your garden tool Arsenal is a water timer and this one's really really simple you can turn off one zone like I have because I don't want to use both zones all you got to do is set it up so you say I this is Zone one I wanted to select that and I set it to 1200 a.m. but zero minutes and that means it won't run at all because I don't want this to just leak out water so you can set it up to just run one length of Hose um which is what I'm doing and uh but if you wanted to run two you can and you know like I said it's super easy to set up I just the the you just use on off if you want to turn it off you can just switch it to off and then if you want just turn it to manual you could hold this down and say you were here and you wanted to water for like a half an hour just to germinate some stuff in you could hold this down and set it to 30 minutes and then you know walk away and then deal with it tomorrow or something there's all sorts of cool things you could do with this um once you get good at watering in general but uh that will save you time because even if you think it takes 30 seconds to come out here and and turn this on if you're doing that you know more than twice a week that's something that you got to check off your list every time uh you know throughout your week and it adds a little bit of pressure to your life you know I have four Farm hydrants that I'm managing on the farm to keep all the green houses watered so I love having water timers because it gives me peace of mind I don't have to think about two of them at least you know it it really saves me a lot of mental effort and this does the same thing for your garden so definitely look into it there's a link in the description where you can buy these and I highly recommend you get a water timer and honestly the number one way that this thing is going to shine for you in your garden is if you have drip irrigation set up that's how I use water timers on my farm is because I'm watering things like tomatoes and cucumbers every single day for a certain time period and that's where this is going to shine you do not want to be out turning a farm hydron once a day for 45 minutes on and off it's going to drive you crazy and if you are growing a large amount of tomatoes and cucumbers in your garden you're probably going to want to have drip irrigation set up because those don't like to get their leaves wet so drip irrigation is a whole rabbit hole and it it is somewhat complicated to set up it's not complicated but you do kind of have to know what you're doing because there's a lot of water pressure gallons per minute kind of stuff to be aware of at least but um I do go over that in my gardening course by the way uh but the actual timer is really going to be a GameChanger for you because it's going to control um how much water you put on the ground per day like for example I'm watering my tomatoes the it's the end of the season so I'm watering them very little but I'm still watering them 4 45 minutes a day in my greenhouse and I have a water timer for those and it just saves me a lot of stress and I could also set it to go off in the morning like way before I even get to the farm literally you could water your garden or your farm while you sleep and that's sort of a GameChanger because um you could come out and do all of the gardening stuff you need to do and the garden's already watered it doesn't like you don't have to worry about getting sprinkled on while you're working in there that's really not a problem in a garden but in the farm it does matter because we have a lot of work to do in a greenhouse or something while it's getting watered um so it's nice to have that checked off the list before the day even really starts for us but same thing goes for gardening everything pretty much likes getting watered while direct sun is not on it so it's a big benefit to just have it done while you're sleeping and having it automated on a daily basis for those kinds of crops gives you a much higher quality cucumber or tomato um most tomato splitting issues happen because tomatoes are not getting watered evenly so they'll get like one inch of water one day and half an inch the next day and that's where the splitting will happen and then same with cucumbers getting bitter they get bitter usually because the water's not even so if you have a way to get that water even on them and you live in a climate where there's not a ton of rainfall you could really take advantage of a of a water timer like this and it's just going to save you a lot of a headache and give you a much higher quality product basically so gadgets are great and all and I love gadgets I love tools I use a lot of them on the farm and in the garden but they all can fail so I rely on them all with a grain of salt you know when I first started farming I got all excited about the gadgets because I'm like oh it's going to make my life so much easier all my stress is gone it's all automated I don't have to worry about anything and then I got a faucet that automatically shuts off when the water level gets above a certain level and it failed like one out of five times and it turns into a a flood of water in my wash Pack building which is not really designed for the floor to get wet that's happened like 20 times now and that's just one example all sorts of stuff like this fails automated vents automated fans tools break you know um that's why I generally like using hand tools at on the farm as much as possible as opposed to big mechanical tools or gas powered tools and stuff but all these things can fail and so even with a water timer like this no matter where it's coming from you know there's moving Parts involved so you can't just rely on it forever you know you got to pay attention to it sometimes these things they save you a lot of time and headache C like over time but there are points where they can fail so you just got to take into account if this thing fails is it going to be the end of the world for you you know probably not uh like if you if this thing doesn't turn on or something most likely you're G to be fine unless you're like germinating a whole bed of carrots or something uh and you need it to come on every single day for 10 days and it fails that's a problem sure but just take that into account when you set these kinds of automations up and tools of any kind because they all fail you know all farm tools fail at some point so you can't just be in that uh naive state of mind that I was when I first started farming and assumed it's all going to be fine and dandy forever you know there's there's you still need to pay attention to them and check on them every once in a while you know so I check the battery level on my water timers you know once every couple weeks just to keep an eye on them you know stuff like scales I keep the keep an eye on the battery levels because if something like that fails for me it's a big deal um on a farm but for this it's not really that big a deal but it's just something to be aware of you know you need to be mindful of all your tools and maintain them a little bit but it's easier to maintain a tool like this than maintaining a garden watering schedule by hand every day or doing it by hand or whatever so um just think of it that way it is ultimately saving you a ton of time and headache and making your life easier it just requires less maintenance but it still requires maintenance so if you're interested in setting up a garden like this where it takes very little time to manage and can still produce you the kind of results I talked about at the beginning of this video I've got a free Garden starting guide in the description where I go over how to set up a garden like this in four simple steps and give you the Bare Bones necessary to build a garden like this cuz it's not hard and it's a free Microsoft Word document you can download save it and I have links to some of the things you'll need to buy to make it happen and I highly recommend you check that out and if you like this video please subscribe give it a like share with anybody you think would like it and I hope you enjoyed it I will see you in the next",
