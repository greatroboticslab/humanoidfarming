00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,440
Over the course of the winter in

3
00:00:08,800 --> 00:00:15,640
Wyoming, cold temperatures, freezing

4
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:18,640
rain, snow, mud, and windchill are all

5
00:00:15,640 --> 00:00:21,439
possible. Livestock producers use many

6
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,320
tactics to ensure survival. Three of the

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:25,680
most significant include weather

8
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:27,760
forecasting, feeding strategy, and

9
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
protection from the wind. Weather

10
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,480
forecasting plays an important role in

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:34,719
winter livestock production. The

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:37,440
National Weather Service produces a cold

13
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,760
weather advisory for newborn livestock,

14
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:41,920
which can be found on their website.

15
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,399
This and other weather reports allow

16
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,559
producers to increase feed, move

17
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:49,200
livestock, or take other precautions

18
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:51,440
against the weather. Livestock's

19
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:54,160
nutritional requirements increase with

20
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,960
colder weather. If there is a windchill,

21
00:00:54,160 --> 00:01:00,000
this increase can be dramatic. Most

22
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:02,960
researchers agree that 20 to 32 degrees

23
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:05,360
Fahrenheit is the lowest temperature dry

24
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,799
animals can withstand with no increase

25
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:11,080
in energy needs. Energy can be provided

26
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:13,760
to animals with extra hay or

27
00:01:11,080 --> 00:01:16,640
supplements. Furr, it sure is cold out

28
00:01:13,760 --> 00:01:18,640
here today. Almost every pasture you see

29
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:21,040
will have some mechanism for breaking

30
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:23,439
the wind. The horses behind me are able

31
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,439
to get behind this tree row to help them

32
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:28,000
withstand the windchill. From the

33
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:29,759
University of Wyoming Extension, I'm Ash

34
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,759

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:32,759
