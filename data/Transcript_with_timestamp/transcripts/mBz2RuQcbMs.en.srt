[Music]

2
00:00:22,199 --> 00:00:31,080
and honor at Antonio's farm and I've

3
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:34,239
been farming here for ever since 2012

4
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,800
I have good years and bad years but this

5
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:40,399
year is look like it's going to be a

6
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:40,399
better year than last year so I'm

7
00:00:40,660 --> 00:00:54,719
[Music]

8
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:56,480
happy well I have here

9
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:01,079
raspberries

10
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:02,280
corn and strawberries

11
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:04,720
then

12
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:06,760
some blueberries but the blueberry

13
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:10,479
plants were small so they probably take

14
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:13,840
another three years to be able to

15
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:17,720
harvest some and some sweet corn is

16
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,320
coming and peppers tomatoes becoming

17
00:01:17,720 --> 00:01:25,040
some and that's about it but what I

18
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:27,720
really interest is in berries I'm a

19
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:27,720
berry

20
00:01:28,840 --> 00:01:31,840
guy

21
00:01:34,840 --> 00:01:37,520
well because this what I've been growing

22
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,159
for the

23
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:42,759
last six

24
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,040
years you know raspberries and

25
00:01:42,759 --> 00:01:47,000
strawberries and now I'm trying

26
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:50,399
blueberries but kind of difficult to

27
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,880
grow because I never grown before so I

28
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:57,320
don't know what the and puts to put it

29
00:01:52,880 --> 00:02:01,000
on but I'm leing little by little well

30
00:01:57,320 --> 00:02:05,039
my great grandfather was agriculture my

31
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:07,439
grandpa then my dad and now myself so

32
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:09,280
we've been in generation in agriculture

33
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,560
for a

34
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:14,840
while we from Mexico you know we were

35
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,200
farming over there a long time and then

36
00:02:14,840 --> 00:02:19,400
year 2000 uh

37
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,879
no

38
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,640
1972 I came over here when I was 18

39
00:02:21,879 --> 00:02:27,360
years old and then I started working in

40
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:30,879
ores grown pears then I work for 28

41
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:35,400
years around here around here in the

42
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:38,959
and then two year 2000 I quit working in

43
00:02:35,400 --> 00:02:41,280
or and then I started growing my own

44
00:02:38,959 --> 00:02:44,680
bches then little by little I just

45
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:47,800
became to be a produce more and more and

46
00:02:44,680 --> 00:02:51,000
now I I produce around 4

47
00:02:47,800 --> 00:02:54,519
acres and that's how yeah 4

48
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:57,360
acres and that's how I started so I'm in

49
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:57,360
this business ever

50
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:05,280
since 2006 I was I started over there in

51
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:05,280
Sans Valley then I farm over there

52
00:03:07,000 --> 00:03:12,319
for about 5 years then I mve over

53
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,400
here

54
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,400
2012 then I've been here ever

55
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,360
since yeah I've been putting some food

56
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:26,200
liers you know horse food liers in there

57
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,280
and messed it up with the soil and the

58
00:03:26,200 --> 00:03:30,400
soil is looking great now so and then un

59
00:03:28,280 --> 00:03:33,480
organic so I don't use

60
00:03:30,400 --> 00:03:39,200
any chemical fertilizers or pesticides

61
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:39,200
whatsoever so I just do fertilizer I me

62
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:45,000
uh uh what do you call it

63
00:03:43,150 --> 00:03:49,280
[Music]

64
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:52,560
those manur yeah I SC those in the fall

65
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:55,959
so that way if you be any problems the

66
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:58,159
so you clean them out so and then that's

67
00:03:55,959 --> 00:03:59,760
how I do it I have some problems with

68
00:03:58,159 --> 00:04:04,360
the bugs you know they sometimes they

69
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:07,720
eat 25% but then I get the 75% myself

70
00:04:04,360 --> 00:04:10,480
and that's how it's been working but I

71
00:04:07,720 --> 00:04:13,439
learn that if you keep a healthy plants

72
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:13,439
then the bags leave him

73
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:24,520
alone strawberries you know I just I

74
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:27,400
work for somebody before I start growing

75
00:04:24,520 --> 00:04:30,320
it this is back in the year

76
00:04:27,400 --> 00:04:32,000
2000 I was working for this guy I don't

77
00:04:30,320 --> 00:04:33,320
remember his name but he was in the

78
00:04:32,000 --> 00:04:38,840
Apple gate

79
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:41,960
area so he was a strawberry growing so I

80
00:04:38,840 --> 00:04:46,160
work for him for three different seasons

81
00:04:41,960 --> 00:04:47,919
then I learned some then year year 26 I

82
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,000
started growing my own and I've been

83
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:56,280
ruing making mistakes and there and I've

84
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:56,280
been uh growing St ever

85
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:03,280
since well no I buy the plants

86
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:06,840
first then after that then then the

87
00:05:03,280 --> 00:05:09,520
starts I just transplanted every year

88
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:11,800
then when they get four or five years

89
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:14,840
old then I get new

90
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:19,520
ones I order some more new plants and

91
00:05:14,840 --> 00:05:20,800
planting and do another four years and

92
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:25,560
then rotate

93
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:28,759
it that's it so this is my second year

94
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:32,240
and different brighty than for The Last

95
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:33,800
5 Years because this is no brighty and

96
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,400
seems to me it's working really well

97
00:05:33,800 --> 00:05:38,560
because you can see the size of the ber

98
00:05:35,400 --> 00:05:40,880
is pretty good size and this bright is

99
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:43,240
everywhere so

100
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,759
once it's adult they just keep it

101
00:05:43,240 --> 00:05:48,360
producing all the way to October and you

102
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:50,880
have upic well where do you sell your

103
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:53,680
products I sell my products at the

104
00:05:50,880 --> 00:05:57,319

129
00:07:06,080 --> 00:07:13,280
was farming over there back and I I

130
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:15,479
started over there 2006 and work all the

131
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:15,479

00:07:18,120 --> 00:07:26,560
2010 but I was not enough water in there

134
00:07:22,240 --> 00:07:29,599
I was pretty R so I was irrigating three

00:09:54,839 --> 00:10:00,640
living off the farm my family and I so I

188
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:02,959
don't hire people cuz this is a family

189
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:04,880
farm and my my children don't want to be

190
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:07,079
a farmer they they think it's too much

191
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:09,320
work so they don't want to be getting a

192
00:10:07,079 --> 00:10:12,360
stu like me working all the time is lot

193
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:15,480
of work sometimes it's not enough money

194
00:10:12,360 --> 00:10:17,959
you know so but I do because I like it

195
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:22,079
and I enjoy eat what I

196
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:24,880
grow and if something be coming later

197
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:28,240
hard time to get it food then I can grow

198
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:30,640
my own so I'm not afraid of that cuz I

199
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,240
can grow

200
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:37,079
food so probably never happen but I'm

201
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,760
prepared oh that's right I'm not make it

202
00:10:37,079 --> 00:10:40,920
a lot of money but enough just to

203
00:10:38,760 --> 00:10:43,200
survive sometimes I got to borrow some

204
00:10:40,920 --> 00:10:44,600
money for my friends not a lot because I

205
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:47,320
never want to get involved with the

206
00:10:44,600 --> 00:10:50,279
banks because then in a bad year I know

207
00:10:47,320 --> 00:10:53,480
I can lose my business so it's really

208
00:10:50,279 --> 00:10:56,360
hard for me but I'm happy that I still

209
00:10:53,480 --> 00:10:59,480
UNS survive that's the way yeah that's

210
00:10:56,360 --> 00:11:01,440
the way yeah so and I'm making a lot of

211
00:10:59,480 --> 00:11:05,320
money but sometimes I just make enough

212
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:07,360
to survive then sometimes when the in

213
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:10,279
the winter time then I work for somebody

214
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:13,399
else doing pruning so I can make it

215
00:11:10,279 --> 00:11:15,800
money for to eat in that time so I'm not

216
00:11:13,399 --> 00:11:16,480
dependent all by the farm so I do a lot

217
00:11:15,800 --> 00:11:19,600
of

218
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,639
pruning fruit trees because

219
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:25,160
I after I harvest the corn till it end

220
00:11:22,639 --> 00:11:27,160
and prepareing for for the garlet

221
00:11:25,160 --> 00:11:29,760
because the garlet I plant them in

222
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,160
October and November

223
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:36,560
I put some in in October CLE teres

224
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,240
because it's four teres so I do four two

225
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:41,519
and then November I do the other

226
00:11:39,240 --> 00:11:44,600
two then that way I can have a little

227
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,600
Oly garet for

228
00:11:51,440 --> 00:11:57,160
them there's a three-year-old plants but

229
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:59,120
for the last two years they didn't grow

230
00:11:57,160 --> 00:12:01,760
any because I didn't put enough water I

231
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:04,600
was just keeping

232
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:08,040
alive and and I'm

233
00:12:04,600 --> 00:12:11,040
happy I did because I was using drip

234
00:12:08,040 --> 00:12:12,399
just to make him survive but now it's

235
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,040
pling water so I've been giving him

236
00:12:12,399 --> 00:12:19,079
enough so you can see I have no grown

237
00:12:16,040 --> 00:12:21,720
sometimes it's a 10 in long already so

238
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:24,199
I'm happy they're

239
00:12:21,720 --> 00:12:26,680
coming

240
00:12:24,199 --> 00:12:30,199

00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:53,519
tasty that's why I like to be a farmer

285
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:56,759

286
00:14:53,519 --> 00:14:56,759

287
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:39,970
