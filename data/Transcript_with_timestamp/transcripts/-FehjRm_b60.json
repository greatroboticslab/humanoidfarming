  "text": "hello viewers welcome to Elm TV a station where you watch you interact and also you learn your teor today is Mr an agriculture teacher in today's lesson we are in form three lesson 10 and the topic is uh livestock production form and the subtopic is uh livestock rearing uh practices on to the lesson or objectives uh by the end of this lesson you should be able to explain uh State uh various uh methods of controlling parasite and disease other than vaccination and the second one state any three types of vaccines uh the second uh the second routine Management on RTO rearing that is Parasite and Disease Control remember we covered the first one is feeding uh the first one feeding is a routine Management in the previous lesson and there are several methods that we normally use to control uh parasite and diseases a parasite is a an organism which normally uh leave on another organism at the expense of the other for example a we have also parasite like the ones which normally causes diseases and therefore they are supposed to be controlled so that you can end up having high levels of production then the first method of controlling parasite and diseases is dew Waring and therefore during Waring you can use appropriate uh tool to to put the Dew all to introduce into the dewers into the livestock you can see there is a diagram here of a person who is doing Dew Waring in ship and the person is using a drenching gun to introduce the antih helin tis those are the drugs which are meant for redu uh for controlling warms then we have the second one is dipping and this is aimed at controlling the Ecto or external parasite where chemical such as aide they are used then we have spraying also acaricide is used but in spraying you can use the hand spray method then the fourth one we have pasture management and during pasture management you can use structures such as the pck whereby you will be uh regulating the the P or the G the greasing unit using different bules and therefore whenever the the animals are feeding on a particular product the other products should be closed to make sure that the heat of the sun heats the eggs of the of the parasite and therefore are destroying them and therefore breaking the cycle of parasite uh uh parasite cycle then uh we go to the do that is another one that is referred to The Cutting of the tail or or tailing it is also referred to as tailing and the importance of this is to control the bluefly infestation and the other one we have the hoof triming whereby a hoof cutter is normally used to cut the overgrown Hooves so that you can control the hoof rot diseases then we have dust bath a dust bath is an example of a d b here we have a pit Ash uh we have a pit Ash here which is normally provided to the Potter so that they can bathe with it and the pet Ash is is very very important because it will kill the parasite which normally affect Potter uh then we have vaccination is another method of controlling uh diseases or controlling in the spreading of diseases vaccination you can vaccinate your animal you can inject your animal with a particular vaccine so that you can control the disease from uh spreading then methods of vaccination we have you can administer the vaccine through injection as you can see in this diagram the animal is injected using a vaccine then we have the second method we have Oro vacine that's where you introduce the vaccine through the mouth then we have inhalation inhalation is through the nose and also insertion at the caka when it comes to poort Tre then uh types of vaccines we have four uh in today's we are going to cover four the first one you have life varent vaccine is the one which is administered when the disease causing microorganism actually vaccine is a disease causing microorganism who ability to cause the disease has been reduced and therefore for Life variant vaccine is the one which is introduced when the disease C microorganism or pathogen is live then we have life attenuated is the one which is normary the disease CA microorganism is mixed with some chemicals to reduce uh its uh poers therefore it will not affect the animal and the form the examples of diseases which are controlled using this meod or or this type of vaccine we have Anthrax and also we have brucelosis we have killed an all dead vaccine that is where you kill the disease causing microorganism then you mix it with formal forde there is a chemical uh then uh you introduce into the body so that the body of an animal can become stimulated to produce its own antibodies then we have the toxine vacine uh it is in form of for marine and they actually once it is introduced to the body of animal the animal is stimulated to produce its own immunity then we have properties of good vaccine should be a good immunity it should be as good as natural immunity then the second one a long shelf life the the immunity which should the vaccine should have a a long uh keeping shelf life that is the time the lifespan uh before it EXP should be longer then single dose should produce lifelong immunity then the fourth one easy to administer it is should not be complicated when it comes to uh to introduction of the vaccine into the body then no side effect should not the the animal or also should not harm the farmer who is administering them to the animal then compatible with other vaccine yes a good vaccine should uh be compatible with other types of vaccine we have come to the end of today's lesson and we are going I'm going to give you assignment the first question Define the following terms as using lifestock production for uh the first one is vacine and the second one is vaccination then the second question is highlight any four types of vaccine used during uh life stock uh production then we have refer uh reference you can refer from secondary agriculture book Student Book uh three uh that the publisher is the Kenya literature bu for more information you can reach us at arim TV using the following contacts the first one we have SMS using that number then you can reach us through YouTube uh Facebook at TV and finally you can twit us at tvk thank you for joining me in this lesson till next lesson right",
