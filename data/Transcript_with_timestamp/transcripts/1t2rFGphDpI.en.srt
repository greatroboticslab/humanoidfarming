00:00:20,030 --> 00:00:25,260
hi my name is cherry flowers with Paige

5
00:00:22,950 --> 00:00:27,720
and flowers and we're here in the urban

6
00:00:25,260 --> 00:00:31,380
jungle st. Paul Minnesota in the Hamline

7
00:00:27,720 --> 00:00:33,800
Midway neighborhood on a lot that's a

8
00:00:31,380 --> 00:00:38,820
double lot and this is our urban farm

9
00:00:33,800 --> 00:00:41,120
we've been growing for in it in the

10
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:44,359
urban landscape for about twelve years

11
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:48,149
on different sites around the city and

12
00:00:44,359 --> 00:00:51,899
right here this is our home and also our

13
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,659
part of our farm in this farm site we

14
00:00:51,899 --> 00:00:58,260
happen to have a high tunnel our high

15
00:00:54,659 --> 00:01:00,600
tunnel is 30 by 32 the advantages of

16
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:02,429
having a high tunnel would be that you

17
00:01:00,600 --> 00:01:04,830
can grow things for a longer period of

18
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:06,990
time throughout the season so starting

19
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:09,899
earlier in the spring and then going

20
00:01:06,990 --> 00:01:12,180
later into the fall in the high tunnel

21
00:01:09,899 --> 00:01:15,180
we usually grow things that like really

22
00:01:12,180 --> 00:01:18,390
warm season temperature so we've grown

23
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,700
tomatoes peppers eggplant we've also

24
00:01:18,390 --> 00:01:23,520
grown and we have in there now to some

25
00:01:20,700 --> 00:01:26,729
sweet potatoes that like a longer season

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,799
and like hotter temperatures and then

27
00:01:26,729 --> 00:01:31,770
right now we're experimenting with

28
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,899
ginger and turmeric that are hot season

29
00:01:31,770 --> 00:01:36,990
types of crops and longer season crops

30
00:01:33,899 --> 00:01:39,390
as well partly because they're

31
00:01:36,990 --> 00:01:42,020
high-value crops and then other things

32
00:01:39,390 --> 00:01:44,219
that we're doing in the high tunnel

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:46,020
aquaponics and hydroponics and

34
00:01:44,219 --> 00:01:47,850
succession planting is another piece of

35
00:01:46,020 --> 00:01:51,479
it so in the spring we might start with

36
00:01:47,850 --> 00:01:54,719
lettuce or greens of some sort that like

37
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:56,490
the cool season weather and then move

38
00:01:54,719 --> 00:01:58,679
into the hot season crops in the middle

39
00:01:56,490 --> 00:02:02,939
of the year and then go into another

40
00:01:58,679 --> 00:02:05,549
cool variety in the fall one of the

41
00:02:02,939 --> 00:02:07,649
things about a high tunnel is that of

42
00:02:05,549 --> 00:02:10,530
course because it's covered with plastic

43
00:02:07,649 --> 00:02:12,750
you don't end up with rainwater getting

44
00:02:10,530 --> 00:02:15,510
inside unless you work really hard at it

45
00:02:12,750 --> 00:02:17,220
and we found out about the Sarah grant

46
00:02:15,510 --> 00:02:20,280
and we were fortunate enough to get a

47
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:23,870
sare grant to do water capture off of

48
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:27,989
the high tunnel and the high tunnel will

49
00:02:23,870 --> 00:02:30,060
it will capture about a total of 600

50
00:02:27,989 --> 00:02:32,250
gallons of water and a one-inch rainfall

51
00:02:30,060 --> 00:02:36,209
and so we felt like that was worth

52
00:02:32,250 --> 00:02:38,549
working toward so what we put together

53
00:02:36,209 --> 00:02:41,250
is gutters on both sides of the high

54
00:02:38,549 --> 00:02:43,829
tunnel that collect the water and then

55
00:02:41,250 --> 00:02:46,799
the water goes into rain barrels at the

56
00:02:43,829 --> 00:02:48,930
west side of the high tunnel and from

57
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:51,780
there we have a pump and the pump is

58
00:02:48,930 --> 00:02:54,450
powered either from our house from the

59
00:02:51,780 --> 00:02:58,230
electricity from our house or by a solar

60
00:02:54,450 --> 00:03:00,299
collector and then from there the water

61
00:02:58,230 --> 00:03:04,139
is pumped through into a drip irrigation

62
00:03:00,299 --> 00:03:06,030
system and in the irrigation system then

63
00:03:04,139 --> 00:03:07,889
that runs directly to the roots of the

64
00:03:06,030 --> 00:03:10,019
plants and that's important in a high

65
00:03:07,889 --> 00:03:12,150
channel because if you have overhead

66
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,269
watering sometimes the leaves get wet

67
00:03:12,150 --> 00:03:16,590
and they can get diseased so so this

68
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:18,209
whole system works really well together

69
00:03:16,590 --> 00:03:20,880
and it's a way for us to take advantage

70
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:23,459
of all of the water that sheets off of

71
00:03:20,880 --> 00:03:27,720
the high tunnel and it also helps us to

72
00:03:23,459 --> 00:03:29,730
keep from from flooding the high tunnel

73
00:03:27,720 --> 00:03:31,290
because originally when all the wires

74
00:03:29,730 --> 00:03:33,660
would come off the high tunnel some of

75
00:03:31,290 --> 00:03:35,609
it would get inside and then it would

76
00:03:33,660 --> 00:03:38,209
tend to flood the edges of it and make

77
00:03:35,609 --> 00:03:38,209
it too wet

78
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:58,849
