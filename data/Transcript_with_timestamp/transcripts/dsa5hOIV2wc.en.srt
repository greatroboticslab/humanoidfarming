1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,319
the more regenerative i get and think of

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,319
soil health and resistance approach

3
00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,320
rather than a product approach my

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:10,800
herbicide bill's gone down by half my

5
00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:17,700
fungicide bill's gone down by 40

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:20,400
my fertilizer bill cut by half

00:00:17,700 --> 00:00:22,160
[Music]

8
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:23,680
i want to get away from using artificial

9
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:26,000
nitrogen in a few years

10
00:00:23,680 --> 00:00:27,359
by having a systems approach building on

11
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:30,400
soil health benefits

12
00:00:27,359 --> 00:00:32,399
building fertility a natural processes

13
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,000
within my farming system the future's

14
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:35,760
got to be that way because

15
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,120
artificial fertilizer is going to be a

16
00:00:35,760 --> 00:00:39,280
limited resource

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:40,559
diesel will be a limited resource we

18
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,280
will move away from these

19
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,879
fossil based products to more

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:47,120
nature-based products

21
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:48,640
we cannot continually mining phosphate

22
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:50,879
and potash out of the ground

23
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:52,399
it's not renewable so how the heck do we

24
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:53,760
find a farming system

25
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:55,920
that actually allows us to produce

26
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:57,039
enough food to feed the global

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
population

28
00:00:57,039 --> 00:01:02,559
but also have enough effect and benefit

29
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:03,100
to the to the soil and the system around

30
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,119
it

31
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:06,720
[Music]

32
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:09,040
the conservation agriculture direct

33
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,159
drilling system for myself at the moment

34
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,600
is a time thing

35
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,680
it's meant that i could take on this

36
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:16,240
farm three years ago and

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,600
and farm it the area with a lot less

38
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:18,880
people and a lot less machinery and

39
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,880
capital outlay

40
00:01:18,880 --> 00:01:23,119
in terms of machinery than would have

41
00:01:20,880 --> 00:01:24,880
been possible 10 or 15 years ago

42
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:26,400
i'm not doing it because i believe this

43
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:27,759
is well i know that this is going to

44
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,640
make me more money than another way of

45
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:30,320
doing it

46
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:32,159
i'm doing it because i don't want to

47
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
have to go out and buy lots of

48
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:35,439
big cultivators and big horsepower

49
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,880
tractors and have a

50
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:38,640
massive regular diesel tank in the yard

51
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:40,799
that i need to fill up every week

52
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:42,240
i want to be able to farm the area i'm

53
00:01:40,799 --> 00:01:44,240
farming better

54
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:45,439
be more weather resilient with less

55
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,280
machinery

56
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:48,799
and every day that if i can turn up in

57
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:50,640
this field drill it

58
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,640
leave come back six weeks later and

59
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,159
drill my cash crop and go away again

60
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,159
all that time in the middle i can have

61
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:57,280
off i could either not be at work all

62
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:57,920
the time every hour of the day on the

63
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:59,840
tractor

64
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:01,600
or i can go and do some work somewhere

65
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:04,000
else either on another field

66
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:05,040
on the farm or farm or a larger area

67
00:02:04,000 --> 00:02:08,239
myself or for

68
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:10,800
contracting customers

69
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:13,840
on average these tractors now do about

70
00:02:10,800 --> 00:02:17,040
150 160 hours a year

71
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,200
farming conventionally we would put

72
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:21,360
certainly 800 hours a year on a tractor

73
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:23,680
and sometimes a thousand hours a year

74
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:24,640
wouldn't be unusual so these tractors

75
00:02:23,680 --> 00:02:27,520
are probably

76
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,080
only doing through the year 20 of the

77
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:30,560
work

78
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:32,319
that they would have been doing before

79
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:34,560
from stubble to stubble

80
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:36,480
so including planting our catch or cover

81
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,000
crops the whole establishment and

82
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:39,519
looking after the crops through the year

83
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,959
including harvesting

84
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:43,680
we would now use the maximum of 40 41

85
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:47,040
litres

86
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:48,239
a hectare and in the past we would have

87
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:51,280
been using

88
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,080
certainly to possibly three times as

89
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:53,680
much as that

90
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,599
and and certainly work that i've done

91
00:02:53,680 --> 00:02:58,560
with a series of customers

92
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,040
for uh a supply chain contract in the

93
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:03,120
past

94
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,000
the range of fuel use ran from 40 liters

95
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,120
a hectare to

96
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:09,680
160 liters a hectare in the extreme so

97
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:10,720
the potential is certainly to halve your

98
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:12,400
fuel use

99
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,879
possibly more than that and in the

100
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,959
extreme the fuel use would be around a

101
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:29,120
quarter of what it could be

102
00:03:16,959 --> 00:03:29,120
on some soil types
