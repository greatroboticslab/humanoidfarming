  "text": "[Music] the dealing with the dry forums brings together keynote speakers one of whom is a grain producer as well as a leading local agronomist drew pendous II so my main talk today was on staff and and some of the impacts during a drought so it's not only the business owners and the farmers doing it tough during the drought the the key thing that people forget about is what your staff are feeling as well because they're going through similar issues you know they're worried about their jobs and their security same as the farmers are they're worried about income and how they're going to get through this dry period so some of the big issues we we run into with staff is keeping their enthusiasm to the point where we you probably need to involve your staff and some of the decision making during the drive period more than you have before just to keep them abreast of what's going on some of the things that a lot of people are doing is there's a lot of infrastructure then looked at with staffs a lot more fencing a lot more soil works erosion control stuff like that that they normally don't put a lot of emphasis on but to keep their staff on they're doing those sort of things still a big cost to the business but coming out of the drought should make their decisions a lot better if going forward having making sure they've got good water structures when spraying does start again when it does rain they've got a really good system in place so there's a lot of funding for courses at the moment which is free through rural assistance and stuff like that so that's a really good thing we're getting into but other regions are doing similar things there's been a few study to us some people went over to India and a lot of gone to America just doing study tours and going on those sort of things one of the big things we've done is making sure people to koala days now out of their time take the families away spend time with the kids and all that sorting because we can do it now we're not under a huge work pressure and the hours of time and doing those sort of things and I think that's really key for mental health is to get yeah your family won't they do something different for a while if you put stuff off during this hard time what happens when it does break you know they're going to be hard to find stuff there's a lot of people moving to this to the cities during this dry time if they've been put off and I can't see those people coming back so that's a big consideration on every decision you make and if you take the short-term view it may come back and cause a lot of problems going for but every farm is different and everyone's got a different situation and some farms there isn't that there's no extra work a lot of people are finding other jobs for their staff with the equipment they got like excavators and dozers and trucks and stuff like that and they're finding other jobs contracting work to do with their staff or they're finding an alternative jobs for periods of time during this dry period so when it does break they're still able to come back on farm we can still do our management decisions have good time one of the other key things to remember is that you know it's not on staff it's not just yourself and the people working on the farm but it's also the wives within the business because they take a lot of burden in this and quite often that oh I see they get neglected in these period of times or the husband brings home all their troubles and no one gives those considerations to the wives because they're taking that burden just as much as everyone else and to the point where some of the kids are going back to school and they're worried that their father and mother are struggling and they're going home and they're taking that back to their schooling so this is the worst drought we've actually seen in history in this region but yeah just be prepared it's probably the key to getting through this and we will we will get through it because we're resilient and with our it's this it's the way we are go to the description bar below for the latest information links and resources",
