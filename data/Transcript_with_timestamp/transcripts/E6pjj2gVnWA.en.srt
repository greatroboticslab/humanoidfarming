2
00:00:01,000 --> 00:00:08,480
we explain why the Blue Planet lacks

3
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:11,120
water water is fun water is a necessity

4
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:14,360
for all life on Earth some even predict

5
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,480
it to be the new oil but why isn't there

6
00:00:14,360 --> 00:00:19,080
enough for

7
00:00:16,480 --> 00:00:22,519
everyone even though our Blue Planet

8
00:00:19,080 --> 00:00:24,599
consists of 70% water we can only use an

9
00:00:22,519 --> 00:00:28,800
extremely small part of it as drinking

10
00:00:24,599 --> 00:00:31,519
water 97% of all water is salty and 2%

11
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,040
is Frozen the the remaining 1% could

12
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:37,760
still be sufficient for everyone but

13
00:00:34,040 --> 00:00:40,840
unfortunately its distribution is pretty

14
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:43,360
unfair today more than 700 million

15
00:00:40,840 --> 00:00:46,000
people have no access to clean water

16
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:49,039
like Aza who has to walk for miles to

17
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:51,120
collect it and carry it home while Tim

18
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:55,000
in another part of the world simply

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:58,719
turns on the tap he uses more than 100 L

20
00:00:55,000 --> 00:01:02,039
per day what's behind this

21
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:04,000
Injustice in agriculture groundwater and

22
00:01:02,039 --> 00:01:06,400
water from marshlands is used to

23
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:09,200
irrigate the fields in countries with a

24
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,200
dry and hot climate this is especially

25
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,799
problematic once pumped out of the

26
00:01:11,200 --> 00:01:17,400
ground the water doesn't come

27
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,200
back on top climate change and pollution

28
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:22,400
make matters worse the local population

29
00:01:20,200 --> 00:01:25,720
must live on dried out

30
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:28,439
land and as the world's population grows

31
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:30,880
the demand for water is growing too the

32
00:01:28,439 --> 00:01:34,159
UN estimates that in

33
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,360
2025 demand will be up to 40% higher

34
00:01:34,159 --> 00:01:38,439
than it is today this Bears the

35
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,320
potential for conflicts about the use of

36
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:42,960
water

37
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:45,880
resources governments and societies need

38
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:47,880
to change their attitudes towards water

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,520
water systems infrastructure and

40
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:52,240
Technology must be upgraded and new

41
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:54,719
Frameworks for intelligent Water

42
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:57,880
Resource Management and conservation

43
00:01:54,719 --> 00:02:01,840
have to be forged because there is no

44
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,840
life without water
