00:00:00,760 --> 00:00:05,279
hey everybody well I haven't recorded a

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:07,040
whole lot lately in the last few days

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:10,559
and that's just because not a whole lot

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:13,440
interesting has happened so uh kind of

6
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:16,400
hard to find interesting

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:19,199
things so anyways it's I don't even know

8
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:22,240
what today is Tuesday it must be tues no

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,199
oh it's Monday sorry today's Monday

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,640
yikes that's what you get for being a

11
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:29,480
farmer not knowing what day of the week

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:31,000
it is anyways so we're just coming back

13
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:33,399
from town

14
00:00:31,000 --> 00:00:34,399
I had a package at the post office and

15
00:00:33,399 --> 00:00:37,079
more

16
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:40,920
importantly I have a

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:45,800
tube for a sprinkler tire that I'm going

18
00:00:40,920 --> 00:00:50,480
to put back on well I done messed

19
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:51,320
up I have I have put tubes in so many of

20
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,960
these

21
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:58,199
tires and I have never had this

22
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:01,120
happen obviously I made a mistake but

23
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:03,519
somehow I got the tube wedged between

24
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:07,360
the tire and the

25
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,960
rail and I can't get them I'm to the

26
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:10,640
point now where it's like I cannot get

27
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:12,360
that stuffed in so I decided okay well

28
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:16,479
whatever I'll take the tire back

29
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:19,200
apart so I did I got this side off which

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:22,960
is the last side I put

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:24,079
on uh but the wheel is it's wedged in

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,040
there

33
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:28,560
hard

34
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:33,000
and I know there's a way to get it apart

35
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:35,079
but um if I am not careful I will get

36
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,439
stressed out and I'm going to end up

37
00:01:35,079 --> 00:01:40,040
just cutting this whole tire in half to

38
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,280
get it off and I don't think I don't

39
00:01:40,040 --> 00:01:44,000
think we need that kind of violence

40
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:47,000
today so we're going to let this project

41
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:48,870
sit I'm going to cool off mentally and

42
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:50,399
literally cuz it's hot in

43
00:01:48,870 --> 00:01:52,640
[Music]

44
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:55,159
here

45
00:01:52,640 --> 00:02:00,759
and we'll see what I decide to do with

46
00:01:55,159 --> 00:02:03,399
that I won I beat the system

47
00:02:00,759 --> 00:02:05,680
technically I

48
00:02:03,399 --> 00:02:08,840
cheated

49
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:12,760
um I I finally got the I put some blocks

50
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:15,800
over I jumped on the tire got it popped

51
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:18,599
off and I was able to get

52
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,040
the uh I ended up I was going to try and

53
00:02:18,599 --> 00:02:22,720
just push the tube the rest of the way

54
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,440
in once it was loose but then I found a

55
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,400
spot where I had put a hole in the tube

56
00:02:25,440 --> 00:02:29,640
and

57
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:32,239
decided you know what we're just going

58
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,800
to take the tube off and see if it holds

59
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:37,400
so I took the tube out the main reason

60
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:40,280
we put tubes in these tires is because

61
00:02:37,400 --> 00:02:43,239
when the wheel is in the pivot track the

62
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:45,360
sides of the when it's sunk down a

63
00:02:43,239 --> 00:02:47,680
little bit the sides of the track push

64
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,360
in on the side of the tire and can

65
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:54,120
squeeze on that sidewall and that's

66
00:02:50,360 --> 00:02:57,000
where a lot of our tires have come off

67
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,280
um is because of that and if you put a

68
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:02,280
tube in it helps support that and it

69
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:04,760
doesn't really matter sometimes if that

70
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:07,400
sidewall gets pushed in a little bit cuz

71
00:03:04,760 --> 00:03:10,040
there's a tube in there

72
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:12,080
um but we've done it this way plenty of

73
00:03:10,040 --> 00:03:15,360
times this is how we used to always do

74
00:03:12,080 --> 00:03:20,159
it and this how we're going to do it

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:23,200
today cuz I won a few days

76
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,720
later not a whole lot happened that was

77
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:28,400
interesting at

78
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:31,080
least but we've got some rain coming for

79
00:03:28,400 --> 00:03:33,560
the next few days

80
00:03:31,080 --> 00:03:35,840
and we've got a couple crops that need

81
00:03:33,560 --> 00:03:38,040
cut the grass

82
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:40,400
field and we actually have a field of

83
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,799
millet that's getting pretty

84
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,599
close so we need to get this machine

85
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,519
ready to

86
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:49,519
go um I got a hay buyer coming pretty

87
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:52,360
quick so we're going to jump in this

88
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,560
move it over to the shop where it can be

89
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:55,239
worked

90
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:00,599
on

91
00:03:55,239 --> 00:04:00,599
and we'll load this person with hay

92
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:06,400
and we'll get

93
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:09,920
going so that's

94
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:09,920
that see you in a

95
00:04:15,919 --> 00:04:24,360
minute we sharpened all the blades got

96
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:28,040
those ready to go put a put a nice

97
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:29,880
shiny nice shiny Edge on those you know

98
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:32,360
it's not

99
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,039
perfect but we'll get a lot more life

100
00:04:32,360 --> 00:04:36,600
out of them assuming they don't get hit

101
00:04:34,039 --> 00:04:39,039
by a rock which most of the time that's

102
00:04:36,600 --> 00:04:41,840
what brings them to an end very very

103
00:04:39,039 --> 00:04:44,080
rarely do we uh there's not really a

104
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:46,919
whole lot of rocks out there it's

105
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:48,400
just I don't know it's hard to explain

106
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:52,320
for some reason it seems to be pretty

107
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:53,600
rare when we actually wear these down to

108
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:57,479
the point of

109
00:04:53,600 --> 00:05:00,199
replacement they usually break so at

110
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:03,199
least in this country anyways we got

111
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,840
that done we went through and checked

112
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,520
the oil checked all the all the

113
00:05:05,840 --> 00:05:10,160
oils

114
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:12,880
and the

115
00:05:10,160 --> 00:05:15,680
filters blew out all the air filters

116
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:19,919
there's the engine there's the cab

117
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:22,520
filter check the oil the engine oil the

118
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:24,560
I don't even know what you call it crank

119
00:05:22,520 --> 00:05:27,639
case oil I'm guessing is what it's

120
00:05:24,560 --> 00:05:31,600
called I don't I don't know I'm not a

121
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:35,120
mechanic don't judge me

122
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:35,120
I'm a YouTube Certified

123
00:05:35,880 --> 00:05:39,600
mechanic well that started shutting hard

124
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:41,960
for some reason we still got to give it

125
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,600
a bath but I'm we're not going to be

126
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:47,360
using this wind rower for a few days cuz

127
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,479
it's supposed to rain for about four or

128
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:51,319
5 days

129
00:05:48,479 --> 00:05:54,880
straight um so I have time I have time

130
00:05:51,319 --> 00:05:57,199
to give her a bath um where's this

131
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,280
handle there we

132
00:05:57,199 --> 00:06:02,800
go and hydraulic oils good

133
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:05,039
good there's not a whole lot to check on

134
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:07,720
this side except remind myself when I

135
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:10,680
did the filters um I actually need to

136
00:06:07,720 --> 00:06:12,800
look on my chart and see how many hours

137
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,000
this machine has run since I did this

138
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:18,120
oil

139
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:19,880
change airbags don't leak yet on our old

140
00:06:18,120 --> 00:06:21,360
one they did horribly you had to air

141
00:06:19,880 --> 00:06:23,680
them up every single time you went out

142
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:26,800
it was

143
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:28,680
annoying and these do a really good job

144
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,199
I love this machine so much it does such

145
00:06:28,680 --> 00:06:31,400
a good job

146
00:06:30,199 --> 00:06:33,960
the only

147
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:36,280
thing the only thing I don't like about

148
00:06:33,960 --> 00:06:39,599
it is

149
00:06:36,280 --> 00:06:41,560
that the newer machines I don't know if

150
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:44,039
you'll be able to tell let's get

151
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:47,560
underneath here I don't know what you

152
00:06:44,039 --> 00:06:50,800
call that sometimes I call it a

153
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:53,160
baffle but anyways that's what I adjust

154
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:56,720
up and down to determine how wide the

155
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:59,240
wind row is that doesn't actually make

156
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,720
sense to me I don't get how adjusting

157
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:03,479
that Up and Down Changes the width of

158
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,120
the wind R but it absolutely does much

159
00:07:03,479 --> 00:07:06,800
more than these

160
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,360
do

161
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,560
um but my only issue is that it doesn't

162
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:15,319
do it very evenly so the sides always

163
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:16,879
have more there's always more hay on the

164
00:07:15,319 --> 00:07:20,520
edge and there's in the

165
00:07:16,879 --> 00:07:22,800
middle and on the newer machines the new

166
00:07:20,520 --> 00:07:26,080
New Holland and the new K the the plus

167
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:29,639
series I think cuz this is

168
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:34,400
the let's see this is the 419 just just

169
00:07:29,639 --> 00:07:38,840
the 419 momax 2 I guess or the durine

170
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:41,680
durine 419 and on the 49

171
00:07:38,840 --> 00:07:46,240
plus cuz we demoed

172
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:48,840
one last year two years ago and

173
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:52,720
the I'm calling it the bath

174
00:07:48,840 --> 00:07:57,440
hole um has on the bottom all these

175
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:58,800
little adjustable um guides or veins

176
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,440
that's what they are I guess these

177
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:04,800
adjustable veins that you can adjust

178
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:06,520
manually to get a more even wind row and

179
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:09,400
I've heard they work extremely well I've

180
00:08:06,520 --> 00:08:11,800
seen some videos but I I've also heard

181
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:15,800
that Massie Fergusons work really good

182
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:17,319
too the newer ones at least

183
00:08:15,800 --> 00:08:19,319
um

184
00:08:17,319 --> 00:08:20,879
so I don't know that's my only

185
00:08:19,319 --> 00:08:23,319
disgruntle with

186
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,639
this I would still prefer this over

187
00:08:23,319 --> 00:08:28,879
Massie Ferguson purely because in our

188
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:30,280
circumstance this 19t head is absolutely

189
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:32,080
amazing

190
00:08:30,280 --> 00:08:33,839
that is that is really nice it works

191
00:08:32,080 --> 00:08:36,719
really nice with our rake really nice

192
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,399
with the Bor especially on

193
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,880
Alfalfa you get done a lot quicker with

194
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:43,519
all these

195
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:47,040
fields and then of course I put the

196
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:49,360
aftermarket Trimble in there um cuz I

197
00:08:47,040 --> 00:08:54,279
can't stand the pro

198
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:57,519
700 worst monitor ever created

199
00:08:54,279 --> 00:08:59,120
but case's new monitor I haven't gotten

200
00:08:57,519 --> 00:09:01,440
to try it but I've heard it works really

201
00:08:59,120 --> 00:09:01,440
nice

202
00:09:02,920 --> 00:09:07,959
and we're just putting the

203
00:09:05,079 --> 00:09:11,360
shield but it looks really nice looks

204
00:09:07,959 --> 00:09:14,800
much more user friendly than the pro 700

205
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,200
so we have we've had a few Pro 700s and

206
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:18,360
they

207
00:09:16,200 --> 00:09:19,959
just I don't like

208
00:09:18,360 --> 00:09:23,600
them

209
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:25,440
but I have there is still a pro 7 wealth

210
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:27,399
I guess it's called The intell View

211
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,959
because it's New Holland there is still

212
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:32,399
an intell view monitor in there

213
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:35,720
uh and that's just to run the

214
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:39,680
machine cuz I need to be able to

215
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:42,120
see all the machine data so all the

216
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:44,240
machine data runs on this monitor all

217
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:46,120
the GPS functions run on this

218
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:49,200
Monitor

219
00:09:46,120 --> 00:09:53,079
and man it works so nice and with this

220
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:57,000
we get a a the the RTX it's like 400

221
00:09:53,079 --> 00:09:58,680
bucks a year super cheap as compared to

222
00:09:57,000 --> 00:10:01,519
I don't know maybe you can get RTX on

223
00:09:58,680 --> 00:10:04,480
these too I I don't know but for the

224
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:08,120
same price but anyways this when we ran

225
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:11,120
GPS here if you didn't have a

226
00:10:08,120 --> 00:10:12,680
subscription it's useless GPS on this is

227
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:14,200
useless without a subscription unless

228
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:17,000
you're going in straight

229
00:10:14,200 --> 00:10:20,120
lines um but the subscription for this

230
00:10:17,000 --> 00:10:23,800
monitor was like $2,000 some dollars a

231
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:27,839
year and we quit doing that cuz we're

232
00:10:23,800 --> 00:10:30,200
not planting as much corn as we used to

233
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,839
so it didn't become

234
00:10:30,200 --> 00:10:33,440
and just in our situation in general

235
00:10:31,839 --> 00:10:37,279
it's not as important to us as it used

236
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:41,440
to be so we still need the accuracy I

237
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:43,839
use that that monitor and the nav 900

238
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:46,279
they go on our other tractor in the

239
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:50,200
spring but don't really need it during

240
00:10:46,279 --> 00:10:52,440
the summer so anyways we got this all

241
00:10:50,200 --> 00:10:55,120
done probably not today but maybe

242
00:10:52,440 --> 00:10:57,440
tomorrow I'll give this guy a

243
00:10:55,120 --> 00:11:01,200
bath

244
00:10:57,440 --> 00:11:03,880
and I think I think that'll about do it

245
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:07,399
today um I was working

246
00:11:03,880 --> 00:11:09,000
on yesterday this is an air dryer off

247
00:11:07,399 --> 00:11:13,279
one of our

248
00:11:09,000 --> 00:11:15,000
trucks and I've recently learned that

249
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:17,000
you're supposed to replace these filters

250
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:20,440
this is just an air filter I

251
00:11:17,000 --> 00:11:25,880
guess and so Grandpa went and picked one

252
00:11:20,440 --> 00:11:28,079
up but it's the wrong this is the ad IP

253
00:11:25,880 --> 00:11:29,800
and this is for the

254
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:32,800
adsp um

255
00:11:29,800 --> 00:11:35,240
and then of course this is the purge

256
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:38,760
valve uh that's what this box is for

257
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:40,880
this is the filter but wrong fil wrong

258
00:11:38,760 --> 00:11:43,639
wrong dryer is what this is for so I got

259
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:46,560
to take this back probably

260
00:11:43,639 --> 00:11:49,200
tomorrow and then who knows I might do

261
00:11:46,560 --> 00:11:53,399
it today we'll see how I feel after

262
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:55,639
lunch but it's just it's a really long

263
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,959
drive

264
00:11:55,639 --> 00:12:00,519
so anyways I guess that's it that's

265
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,200
probably going to be it for today

266
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:05,320
and I'll get back to you tomorrow or

267
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:08,079
whenever something interesting

268
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:10,160
happens well we've got a ourselves a fun

269
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:12,959
new

270
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:16,320
project we are I got the

271
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,959
loader I got the loader in the shop

272
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:20,320
here

273
00:12:17,959 --> 00:12:23,079
um I already went through and relieved

274
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:27,320
all the pressure off of

275
00:12:23,079 --> 00:12:30,120
the the boom and everything else that I

276
00:12:27,320 --> 00:12:32,959
could find

277
00:12:30,120 --> 00:12:35,519
and these lines although I think I'm

278
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:37,440
going to do it on the other side there's

279
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:40,079
this is one of the lift cylinders and

280
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:42,199
these are the two lines going into

281
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,320
it

282
00:12:42,199 --> 00:12:47,000
um we'll zoom out a little bit there we

283
00:12:45,320 --> 00:12:49,199
go

284
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:51,480
and this is the other side and this is

285
00:12:49,199 --> 00:12:56,800
where I'm actually going to do this at

286
00:12:51,480 --> 00:12:59,760
so we are putting a scale on this loader

287
00:12:56,800 --> 00:13:01,920
we're going to try that out and see

288
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,079
see how well that works sounds like a

289
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:09,079
good idea so

290
00:13:05,079 --> 00:13:10,959
um kind of did a did a poll with some of

291
00:13:09,079 --> 00:13:15,399
our customers and they all said that it

292
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,399
would be really nice if we had a scale

293
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,959
so I have to take these two connections

294
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,440
off because the way this scale works is

295
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:29,120
they they plug in a pressure

296
00:13:25,440 --> 00:13:31,519
transducer into the lift cylinder and it

297
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:34,199
needs the pressure off the lift

298
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:38,680
cylinder to determine the weight after

299
00:13:34,199 --> 00:13:41,519
it's been calibrated but I have to take

300
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:45,720
these off and figure out not only what

301
00:13:41,519 --> 00:13:48,680
type of connection they are but also um

302
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:50,040
what size and I'm not an expert in

303
00:13:48,680 --> 00:13:53,279
hydraulic

304
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:55,040
connections so uh I'm going to do some

305
00:13:53,279 --> 00:13:56,120
research I'm going to go eat breakfast

306
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:58,279
and while I'm doing that I'm going to do

307
00:13:56,120 --> 00:14:01,279
some research on exactly how to figure

308
00:13:58,279 --> 00:14:02,880
out what type and what size it is we'll

309
00:14:01,279 --> 00:14:04,519
pop these off take some measurements and

310
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:06,720
get it sent

311
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:09,160
in and then the way it'll work is there

312
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:10,920
will be some sort of a computer

313
00:14:09,160 --> 00:14:12,519
apparatus that I don't know where I'm

314
00:14:10,920 --> 00:14:14,800
going to mount it yet maybe somewhere

315
00:14:12,519 --> 00:14:17,320
like right here or somewhere it's got to

316
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:19,480
be I want it somewhere where it's not

317
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:22,199
going to get it's got to be on the front

318
00:14:19,480 --> 00:14:23,680
of the frame cuz I I want it ahead of

319
00:14:22,199 --> 00:14:27,720
the pivot

320
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:30,000
point so I don't know where the best

321
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:32,600
place to put it is maybe on the inside

322
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:33,959
that might be a good spot actually we'll

323
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:35,560
have to see make sure that's it's not

324
00:14:33,959 --> 00:14:36,600
going to get too close to anything but I

325
00:14:35,560 --> 00:14:40,199
don't think it

326
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:42,240
will um so we'll do that and then

327
00:14:40,199 --> 00:14:44,160
that'll send a wireless signal to a

328
00:14:42,240 --> 00:14:47,600
tablet I'm still got to replace that

329
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:50,839
window to a tablet that is mounted up

330
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:53,600
there and um that's how we measure the

331
00:14:50,839 --> 00:14:56,560
weight so that'll be a from Project we

332
00:14:53,600 --> 00:14:58,360
won't actually get it for a few weeks

333
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,040
they said it takes a little while to

334
00:14:58,360 --> 00:15:01,040
order in my SP

335
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:07,360
and and to get them set up but once we

336
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:10,360
do get it installed this will be a

337
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:12,120
pretty fun little apparatus so I'm going

338
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:15,399
to go eat breakfast and we'll come back

339
00:15:12,120 --> 00:15:18,320
to this so I forgot to video of the

340
00:15:15,399 --> 00:15:20,839
whole process but we popped one of these

341
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:23,639
off they're both the same we popped one

342
00:15:20,839 --> 00:15:25,839
of these off and I took a bunch of

343
00:15:23,639 --> 00:15:28,600
measurements uh did some research online

344
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,079
to figure out turns out this is a I've

345
00:15:28,600 --> 00:15:32,680
never heard heard of this again I'm not

346
00:15:30,079 --> 00:15:34,519
an expert but it's called a D connector

347
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:38,959
is the

348
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:42,199
style and I guess they're all in metric

349
00:15:38,959 --> 00:15:44,000
which would make sense anyways took the

350
00:15:42,199 --> 00:15:47,759
measurements and now we're going to go

351
00:15:44,000 --> 00:15:51,279
over to the house and send those in an

352
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:54,240
email so the scale company can get the

353
00:15:51,279 --> 00:16:00,920
scale sent this

354
00:15:54,240 --> 00:16:00,920
way in today's Deep dive we dive deep

355
00:16:01,920 --> 00:16:10,160
I thought that was pretty good anyways

356
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:10,160
um got a lot of stuff taken

357
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:16,319
apart I know I was talking about putting

358
00:16:13,959 --> 00:16:20,480
the scale on here the other

359
00:16:16,319 --> 00:16:22,959
day and I mean got all that figured out

360
00:16:20,480 --> 00:16:24,720
actually there's a new place where that

361
00:16:22,959 --> 00:16:25,920
scale is going to go and let me get my

362
00:16:24,720 --> 00:16:29,040
flashlight

363
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:32,880
here so we've actually decided oh boy

364
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:34,360
boy are you going to focus there we go

365
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:35,970
so we've actually

366
00:16:34,360 --> 00:16:37,319
decided that

367
00:16:35,970 --> 00:16:39,199
[Music]

368
00:16:37,319 --> 00:16:41,600
down oh you're not going to be able to

369
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:44,279
see it from here but there's some line

370
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:47,480
some hoses run across the bottom some

371
00:16:44,279 --> 00:16:49,600
line steel lines and it's a lot more

372
00:16:47,480 --> 00:16:51,880
protected under

373
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:54,440
there than cuz I called the company and

374
00:16:51,880 --> 00:16:56,759
I was like hey I don't I don't know how

375
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:59,199
much I actually want Electronics hanging

376
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:02,040
out right here cuz I know how much junk

377
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:04,640
builds up there in the

378
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:08,720
winter and I asked him if it was okay if

379
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,400
we put it inside inside of here with all

380
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:12,799
the

381
00:17:09,400 --> 00:17:14,959
other stuff that's protected and he said

382
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:18,640
that was fine

383
00:17:14,959 --> 00:17:19,839
so the reason this is tore AP apart and

384
00:17:18,640 --> 00:17:21,280
the steps are on the ground and

385
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:23,039
everything which I only have about an

386
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:27,120
hour to get this put back together cuz

387
00:17:23,039 --> 00:17:29,919
we got hay a hay chart coming is because

388
00:17:27,120 --> 00:17:33,360
the parking brake doesn't

389
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:35,559
work and well I should say works period

390
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:38,039
doesn't function the way it's supposed

391
00:17:35,559 --> 00:17:42,320
to and

392
00:17:38,039 --> 00:17:45,480
the the ride control which is the boom

393
00:17:42,320 --> 00:17:47,120
suspension uh also doesn't work now that

394
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:50,720
I have never gotten that to even start

395
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,960
to work so I don't know that's its own

396
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:55,840
separate issue I haven't figured that

397
00:17:51,960 --> 00:18:00,000
one out yet but the parking brake these

398
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:02,520
are the the nitrogen accumulators I

399
00:18:00,000 --> 00:18:05,840
guess you call it

400
00:18:02,520 --> 00:18:08,720
and they run the parking brake I believe

401
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:11,280
they're also supposed to run the boom

402
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:14,080
suspension the parking brake

403
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:15,240
itself operates let's see if I can turn

404
00:18:14,080 --> 00:18:17,720
this light on

405
00:18:15,240 --> 00:18:20,919
here the parking brake

406
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:22,120
itself is that little green lever

407
00:18:20,919 --> 00:18:25,200
sticking

408
00:18:22,120 --> 00:18:28,840
out and you can see I have the linkage

409
00:18:25,200 --> 00:18:31,640
unhooked for a very good reason because

410
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:33,919
anytime the parking brake it it goes to

411
00:18:31,640 --> 00:18:35,760
it it um what do you call

412
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:39,480
that it

413
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:43,200
defaults to parking brake engaged on

414
00:18:39,480 --> 00:18:46,240
this machine so what that means is that

415
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,000
any time if the parking brake doesn't

416
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,559
work it's

417
00:18:48,000 --> 00:18:53,919
engaged and you can't

418
00:18:50,559 --> 00:18:55,840
move so I unhooked the linkage and that

419
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,919
will not get hooked back

420
00:18:55,840 --> 00:19:00,960
up until I can solve the problem because

421
00:18:58,919 --> 00:19:04,360
what happens is you're driving along I

422
00:19:00,960 --> 00:19:07,280
got it to it started working um last

423
00:19:04,360 --> 00:19:09,880
year it started working suddenly and so

424
00:19:07,280 --> 00:19:11,520
I got it all hooked back up excited and

425
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:14,200
it worked fine for about 2 weeks and

426
00:19:11,520 --> 00:19:16,280
then all of a sudden both when me and

427
00:19:14,200 --> 00:19:17,760
Grandpa were both at different times

428
00:19:16,280 --> 00:19:20,360
driving this

429
00:19:17,760 --> 00:19:23,840
machine it was both when we were backing

430
00:19:20,360 --> 00:19:26,280
up thankfully and I always wear my seat

431
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:29,840
Bel but you know grandpa

432
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:32,600
doesn't and we were backing up parking

433
00:19:29,840 --> 00:19:35,280
brake engages oh my gosh when I tell you

434
00:19:32,600 --> 00:19:36,520
it feels like you got in a car wreck

435
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:39,240
goodness

436
00:19:36,520 --> 00:19:40,480
gracious immediately I unhooked it I was

437
00:19:39,240 --> 00:19:44,000
like I'm not playing that game that's

438
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:46,960
dumb So the plan is I

439
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:49,039
can I've determined it's it has to be

440
00:19:46,960 --> 00:19:50,400
electrical I don't get it cuz what'll

441
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:52,799
happen is like you'll hit the parking

442
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,960
brake button and test and various and

443
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:54,880
this and that and all of a sudden just

444
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:57,240
stops

445
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,799
working

446
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:04,159
so it's I'm pretty sure it's

447
00:20:00,799 --> 00:20:07,520
electrical I haven't figured out what

448
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:09,559
about it I don't understand what I don't

449
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:14,240
know I'm not an

450
00:20:09,559 --> 00:20:16,559
engineer guys so I know down behind here

451
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:18,600
is the actual valve and the solenoid

452
00:20:16,559 --> 00:20:19,440
itself I was kind of thinking it might

453
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,440
be the

454
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:23,200
solenoid and I was going to take that

455
00:20:21,440 --> 00:20:24,960
off and then check it but then I started

456
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:28,000
realizing that if this whole system is

457
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,799
under pressure I don't know if I want to

458
00:20:28,000 --> 00:20:33,480
take this illinoid

459
00:20:29,799 --> 00:20:37,039
out I mean if it's safe to do

460
00:20:33,480 --> 00:20:41,679
so I might just have to call

461
00:20:37,039 --> 00:20:43,240
Volvo um and get advice from

462
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:46,159
them

463
00:20:43,240 --> 00:20:47,240
but that's where we're at now kind of to

464
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:49,120
the point where I just got to get this

465
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:53,440
back together real

466
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:55,840
quick at least good enough to go we'll

467
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:59,320
see I can get in the cab without the

468
00:20:55,840 --> 00:21:00,880
steps on and if I load the truck

469
00:20:59,320 --> 00:21:04,240
that's okay we'll see we'll see what I

470
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:06,559
do I got everything greased up yesterday

471
00:21:04,240 --> 00:21:08,360
as well I greased everything on this

472
00:21:06,559 --> 00:21:10,279
machine crawled underneath did all the

473
00:21:08,360 --> 00:21:12,679
drive shafts all

474
00:21:10,279 --> 00:21:15,000
that at some point I need to check these

475
00:21:12,679 --> 00:21:17,400
planetaries that hasn't been done in a

476
00:21:15,000 --> 00:21:19,960
really long time and really needs done

477
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:21,559
so we're going to get to work I'm going

478
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:23,760
to get this put back

479
00:21:21,559 --> 00:21:27,279
together and we'll get it out of here

480
00:21:23,760 --> 00:21:27,279
and ready to go
