  "text": "[Music] hello everyone welcome back to our Channel today we're embarking on an exciting and colorful journey into the world of fresh and delicious peaches from the vast Peach orchards in the United States to Modern processing facilities we will explore every step of the peach growing harvesting and processing process get ready to witness the large-scale operations and precision of the peach farming industry in the US whether you are a fan of Agriculture a peach Enthusiast or simply curious about where your food comes from this video will provide you with interesting insights into peaches and a greater appreciation for the hard work of the farmers don't forget to hit the Subscribe button and join us as we discover how Farmers grow Harvest and process peaches We Begin our journey in the vast Peach Orchards across the US peaches are not only a beloved fruit but also an important part of American agriculture every year the US produces around 620,000 tons of peaches with States like California Georgia and New Jersey leading the way California is the largest producer accounting for 81% of the nation's Peach production at American Farms peach trees are usually planted in late winter or early spring the process begins with selecting the right Peach varieties and preparing the soil with optimal pH levels peaches require well- drained soil and meticulous care to ensure healthy growth although these peach trees are only one year old they promise fruitful harvest in the future most Peach varieties take three years or more to Bear their first fruit caring for peach trees is a crucial part of the process the trees are pruned at the top to direct nutrients to the roots and trunk promoting strong growth pruning is an important step to ensure sunlight can penetrate the canopy efficiently managing water especially during the ripening stage when Peach blossoms are in full bloom Farmers carefully prune the trees leaving about 60% of the blossoms to ensure optimal fruit density and enhance Peach quality in Peach Orchards millions of honeybees are brought in to assist with pollination after pollination Farmers assess fruit density and remove excess fruits to maintain the best quality peaches are typically harvested in late February and early March for Orchards with multiple Peach varieties the harvest season usually lasts about 2 weeks with several picking to ensure the peaches are harvested at Peak ripeness preserving the best quality and flavor most Farms choose to harvest peaches by hand a process that is carried out with great care and precision Farmers usually Begin work early in the morning when the weather is still cool they gently hold the peach and twist it slightly to detach it from the branch without damaging the tree or the fruit the peaches are then placed carefully into baskets or bins to avoid bruising next the peaches are sorted into baskets or bins to ensure that none are damaged during the Harvest at the packing facilities farmers use specialized scales to weigh multiple peaches at once these scales are designed with several compartments where the peaches are sorted by weight before being transferred into the appropriate bins based on size thousands of workers from Mexico and Guatemala come to help with the peach Harvest each worker can prune about 12 Trees in just 30 minutes and earns an average of $13 per hour peaches are hand harvested each year by about 5,300 workers with wages ranging from $1 11 to $16 per [Music] hour at Large Scale processing facilities peaches undergo several steps to ensure the best quality after being harvested peaches are cooled to remove field heat helping to slow the ripening process and preserve freshness the peaches then go through inspection and washing to remove dirt and pesticide residues here they undergo a meticulous process to become various products first the peaches are sorted by size and quality the best peaches are blanched in hot water to soften the Skins making them easier to peel without damaging the flesh after peeling the peaches are sliced and pitted in preparation for their final products such as canned peaches and syrup dried peaches for long-term storage or Peach puree for juice or baby food thank you for joining us on this journey to discover the process of growing and harvesting peaches we hope you now have a deeper understanding of the dedication and effort of the farmers if you enjoyed this video and want to see more interesting content from our Channel don't forget to hit the Subscribe button and turn on notifications so you won't miss any future videos leave a comment below and share your experiences with peaches see you in the next video [Music]",
