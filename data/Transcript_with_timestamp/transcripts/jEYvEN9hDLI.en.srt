fennel a flavorful herb with a rich

58
00:02:15,800 --> 00:02:20,720
history is the first stop on our journey

59
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:23,200
this unique plant with its feathery

60
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:25,760
leaves and robust bulb is a staple in

61
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:27,519
many kitchens around the globe but how

62
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:30,599
does it get there from the fields of the

63
00:02:27,519 --> 00:02:32,680
farm let's start at the very beginning

64
00:02:30,599 --> 00:02:35,640
fennel seeds are sewn directly into the

65
00:02:32,680 --> 00:02:38,000
soil in early spring or fall depending

66
00:02:35,640 --> 00:02:40,560
on the Region's climate the seeds are

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,319
tiny but they pack a punch each one

68
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:44,280
holding the potential for a new fennel

69
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:47,319
plant once they're in the ground it's a

70
00:02:44,280 --> 00:02:49,519
waiting game as nature takes its course

71
00:02:47,319 --> 00:02:51,519
as the seeds germinate and Sprout they

72
00:02:49,519 --> 00:02:54,239
begin their transformation into mature

73
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:56,200
fennel plants over the course of several

74
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:58,680
weeks the small seedlings grow and

75
00:02:56,200 --> 00:03:02,400
develop into plants that stand tall with

76
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:04,680
Lush feathery fronds and thick bulbous

77
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,440
bases these bulbs are the part of the

78
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,840
plant we're most familiar with in our

79
00:03:06,440 --> 00:03:11,680
kitchens adding a crisp sweet Anis

80
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:13,440
flavor to our dishes so how does this

81
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:16,319
mature fennel make its way from the

82
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,319
field to our plates well that's where

83
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:21,120
the magic of modern farming comes in the

84
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:24,200
process of harvesting fennel is a

85
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:26,239
delicate balance of timing and technique

86
00:03:24,200 --> 00:03:28,040
the plants must be harvested at just the

87
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,280
right moment when the bulbs are at their

88
00:03:28,040 --> 00:03:32,480
Peak size and flavor

89
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,280
this usually happens about 3 months

90
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:35,599
after

91
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:37,760
planting once the fennel is ready

92
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:40,239
farmers use specialized Machinery to

93
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:42,840
harvest the plants these machines are

94
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,720
designed to carefully uproot the fennel

95
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:48,159
ensuring the bulbs remain intact and

96
00:03:45,720 --> 00:03:50,239
undamaged the harvested fennel is then

97
00:03:48,159 --> 00:03:52,760
quickly transported to a processing

98
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:55,040
facility where it's cleaned sorted and

99
00:03:52,760 --> 00:03:58,040
packaged ready to be shipped to markets

100
00:03:55,040 --> 00:03:59,840
and grocery stores remember the Journey

101
00:03:58,040 --> 00:04:02,000

kitchen that's the Journey of fennel

106
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,879
next we head to the vibrant fields of

107
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:16,160
red cabbage known for its vibrant color

108
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:17,600
and health benefits red cabbage is a

109
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,120
staple in many

110
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:22,199
kitchens the Journey of the red cabbage

111
00:04:20,120 --> 00:04:24,759
from seed to your salad bowl is an

112
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,080
interesting one it all begins with the

113
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,759
careful planting of seeds in the fertile

114
00:04:27,080 --> 00:04:33,000
soil these seeds tiny caps of potential

115
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:34,360
are nurtured by the farmers ensuring

116
00:04:33,000 --> 00:04:37,199
they receive the right amount of

117
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:39,280
sunlight and water over time they sprout

118
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:41,520
into young cabbage plants their leaves

119
00:04:39,280 --> 00:04:44,160
unfolding like a story waiting to be

120
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:46,320
told as the weeks pass these young

121
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:48,639
plants grow and mature their leaves

122
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:51,160
turning from a pale green to the deep

123
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,919
rich red we all recognize the

124
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:56,160
transformation is not just a visual One

125
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:58,400
the red cabbage is busy synthesizing

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:01,080
nutrients making it a Powerhouse of

127
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:03,960
vitamins and antiox oxidants now comes

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,759
the exciting part the Harvest it's not

129
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:07,320
just about plucking the matured cabbage

130
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:09,039
from the ground modern farming

131
00:05:07,320 --> 00:05:12,479
techniques have turned this into an

132
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:15,039
efficient mechanized process specialized

133
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:17,199
machines Guided by skilled operators

134
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:19,000
glide through the fields their sharp

135
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,560
blades cut through the thick cabbage

136
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,080
stems leaving the heads of cabbage

137
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:26,479
untouched these heads are then collected

138
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:28,520
by the machine sorted based on size and

139
00:05:26,479 --> 00:05:30,440
quality and sent on their way to be

140
00:05:28,520 --> 00:05:32,440
cleaned and packaged

141
00:05:30,440 --> 00:05:34,960
the harvesting process is a delicate

142
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:36,919
balance of speed and Care the machines

143
00:05:34,960 --> 00:05:39,520
have to move quickly to cover the vast

144
00:05:36,919 --> 00:05:41,880
Fields but also gently to avoid damaging

145
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:44,160
the cabbages it's a dance of precision

146
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:46,440
and efficiency choreographed by the

147
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:48,800
farmers and their machines what's

148
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:51,080
remarkable is the sheer scale of this

149
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,520
operation thousands of cabbages are

150
00:05:51,080 --> 00:05:55,280
harvested in a single day each one

151
00:05:53,520 --> 00:05:58,120
destined for a kitchen somewhere ready

152
00:05:55,280 --> 00:06:01,680

packed with flavor and nutrients their

159
00:06:13,880 --> 00:06:18,599
cultivation process is just as

160
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:20,440
fascinating as their culinary uses the

161
00:06:18,599 --> 00:06:22,680
Journey of a green onion begins with

162
00:06:20,440 --> 00:06:25,280
planting the seeds are sewn directly

163
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,120
into the soil usually in the cool early

164
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:29,960
spring months these tiny seeds once

165
00:06:28,120 --> 00:06:31,880
nestled into the Earth begin their

166
00:06:29,960 --> 00:06:34,720
transformation under the watchful eye of

167
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:38,080
the sun and the nurturing touch of the

168
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,319
rain as days pass the green onion starts

169
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:43,680
to sprout pushing through the soil to

170
00:06:40,319 --> 00:06:46,280
reveal tiny green chots these chots grow

171
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:48,680
into slender stalks their Roots firmly

172
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:50,720
anchored in the nourishing soil the

174
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:55,400
stocks lengthening their bulbs swelling

175
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,319
until they reach the right size for

176
00:06:55,400 --> 00:06:59,160
harvesting now let's talk about the

177
00:06:57,319 --> 00:07:01,160
harvesting process it's a sight to

178
00:06:59,160 --> 00:07:03,520
