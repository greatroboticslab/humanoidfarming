1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:05,759
hey folks its Josh Stoney Ridge farmer

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:07,200
spring is finally in the air here in

3
00:00:05,759 --> 00:00:08,940
North Carolina where I live in the

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,670
Piedmont of North Carolina we're

5
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:13,019
starting to get a touch of that warm

6
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:16,560
weather at that sixties and seventies

7
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,750
where we have a sense of urgency now

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,850
we've got to get out here and we've got

9
00:00:18,750 --> 00:00:24,119
a prune our fruit trees okay and this

10
00:00:20,850 --> 00:00:25,710
tree is a key for a pear tree so we're

11
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:27,810
going to give you a basic run around

12
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:30,840
here in the orchard and give you some

13
00:00:27,810 --> 00:00:34,230
ideas some basic thought processes on

14
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,630
how we or I prune the fruit trees here

15
00:00:34,230 --> 00:00:38,690
on the farm we've got about sixty five

16
00:00:36,630 --> 00:00:40,800
fruit trees now here on the farm and

17
00:00:38,690 --> 00:00:43,649
I'll pick the camera up and show you

18
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:45,930
we've got the beginnings of a beautiful

19
00:00:43,649 --> 00:00:48,390
wonderful orchard for our family to eat

20
00:00:45,930 --> 00:00:50,399
fruit off of for years to come this is

21
00:00:48,390 --> 00:00:52,260
for homesteading this is not for

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:54,449
production this is for homesteading this

23
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:57,149
is for making our own cider making our

24
00:00:54,449 --> 00:00:59,280
own vinegars making our own wine having

25
00:00:57,149 --> 00:01:00,570
fruit here on the farm for us to eat and

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,399
plus when I ride down through here on

27
00:01:00,570 --> 00:01:05,640
the lawnmower I'm grabbing a delicious

28
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,320
pear or a peach or an apple or plum it's

29
00:01:05,640 --> 00:01:09,330
awesome so come on along today and we'll

30
00:01:07,320 --> 00:01:13,090
show you a little bit of basic backyard

31
00:01:09,330 --> 00:01:29,900
fruit tree pruning all right that's fun

32
00:01:13,090 --> 00:01:32,070
[Music]

33
00:01:29,900 --> 00:01:34,500
so first things first let's talk about

34
00:01:32,070 --> 00:01:36,570
the trees okay now this is a pear tree

35
00:01:34,500 --> 00:01:38,970
right here and I'm going to show you the

36
00:01:36,570 --> 00:01:40,620
limbs that we don't want the things that

37
00:01:38,970 --> 00:01:43,080
we don't want just give you a basic

38
00:01:40,620 --> 00:01:45,270
rundown of information that you need to

39
00:01:43,080 --> 00:01:47,520
know for pruning your trees and this

40
00:01:45,270 --> 00:01:49,860
will pertain to pruning your trees in

41
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,540
the winter in the late winter you can

42
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,670
look at the trees now and tell that

43
00:01:51,540 --> 00:01:55,470
they're not even starting to bud this is

44
00:01:53,670 --> 00:01:57,270
the perfect time there are not a lot of

45
00:01:55,470 --> 00:02:00,600
pests and the risk for the tree getting

46
00:01:57,270 --> 00:02:02,700
some sort of infection or disease it's

47
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,350
pretty low this time of year so as we

48
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:06,090
look at the tree here you can see

49
00:02:04,350 --> 00:02:08,759
several branches that are growing inward

50
00:02:06,090 --> 00:02:10,860
we want to get rid of those and branches

51
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:12,540
that are touching one another that will

52
00:02:10,860 --> 00:02:14,820
end up eventually rubbing one another

53
00:02:12,540 --> 00:02:17,400
those are not beneficial branches okay

54
00:02:14,820 --> 00:02:19,890
we also want to look at the angle at

55
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:22,320
which these branches come out we don't

56
00:02:19,890 --> 00:02:24,660
want a very sharp angle we want the

57
00:02:22,320 --> 00:02:26,700
angle to be somewhere near a ninety

58
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:28,410
degree angle the closer to a ninety

59
00:02:26,700 --> 00:02:30,209
degree angle the better off it will be

60
00:02:28,410 --> 00:02:33,540
so what you need to know is a wintertime

61
00:02:30,209 --> 00:02:36,540
pruning promotes growth and a summertime

62
00:02:33,540 --> 00:02:38,700
pruning [ __ ] growth so here we have an

63
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:40,380
example of a tree with the branches

64
00:02:38,700 --> 00:02:42,360
coming off just like it should

65
00:02:40,380 --> 00:02:44,790
coming out to the side almost at a

66
00:02:42,360 --> 00:02:47,010
ninety degree angle this one's coming

67
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:49,350
out nicely the central leader right here

68
00:02:47,010 --> 00:02:51,810
is growing good and if you go around the

69
00:02:49,350 --> 00:02:54,630
tree you can see that this branch right

70
00:02:51,810 --> 00:02:56,519
here may be a weak point but we'll have

71
00:02:54,630 --> 00:02:58,320
to see as time goes on when you're

72
00:02:56,519 --> 00:03:01,560
trimming major limbs off like this you

73
00:02:58,320 --> 00:03:04,739
need to be thinking is this limb shading

74
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:07,830
the limb below it no it's not is this

75
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:10,680
limb shading any limbs no is this limb

76
00:03:07,830 --> 00:03:12,330
shading any limbs well we've got a

77
00:03:10,680 --> 00:03:15,120
little bit of an issue here so if we got

78
00:03:12,330 --> 00:03:18,030
a little rot going on right here you can

79
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:20,730
see that right there so I think we're

80
00:03:18,030 --> 00:03:22,680
going to take this guy out or at least

81
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,380
cut this one back because this one is

82
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:27,209
going to shade this limb and you can see

83
00:03:25,380 --> 00:03:29,160
the deer have damaged my trees a little

84
00:03:27,209 --> 00:03:32,570
bit here too now as you look at the tree

85
00:03:29,160 --> 00:03:35,190
further you can see that this is growing

86
00:03:32,570 --> 00:03:37,200
overtop of this guy and this one is

87
00:03:35,190 --> 00:03:39,750
growing inward we want to open the tree

88
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:41,370
up and bring more light into this tree

89
00:03:39,750 --> 00:03:43,680
so that we have more for

90
00:03:41,370 --> 00:03:46,019
more light means more limbs means more

91
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:48,030
fruit means a better growing tree and we

92
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:51,060
want healthy trees these trees are all

93
00:03:48,030 --> 00:03:55,140
within two to three years old or within

94
00:03:51,060 --> 00:03:59,519
two to three years of planting coyotes

95
00:03:55,140 --> 00:04:00,780
there's coyotes back here so guys have

96
00:03:59,519 --> 00:04:05,099
been having a lot of trouble with

97
00:04:00,780 --> 00:04:07,650
coyotes lately that rooster crowing

98
00:04:05,099 --> 00:04:09,569
might have got him called in I got my

99
00:04:07,650 --> 00:04:11,040
pistol with me today we've been having

100
00:04:09,569 --> 00:04:12,090
some serious coyote problems they've

101
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:14,190
been trying to get in the chicken coop

102
00:04:12,090 --> 00:04:15,799
at night the dogs are barking at them so

103
00:04:14,190 --> 00:04:20,639
I hear I'm there

104
00:04:15,799 --> 00:04:22,289
they're probably 300 yards away through

105
00:04:20,639 --> 00:04:24,710
the woods but anyway let's let's get

106
00:04:22,289 --> 00:04:27,570
back to it by the way a guy gave me this

107
00:04:24,710 --> 00:04:30,210
this holster it's from Cold War

108
00:04:27,570 --> 00:04:31,440
concealment it's a local company right

109
00:04:30,210 --> 00:04:33,720
here in North Carolina

110
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:35,550
it's called Cold War concealment he

111
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:36,060
makes custom holsters here I'll show it

112
00:04:35,550 --> 00:04:38,460
to you again

113
00:04:36,060 --> 00:04:42,720
who makes custom holsters this is a

114
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,490
Smith & Wesson M&P 9-millimeter I like

115
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:46,530
it you can do all kinds of custom colors

116
00:04:44,490 --> 00:04:47,970
anyway back to the fruit trees so

117
00:04:46,530 --> 00:04:49,620
there's several different schools of

118
00:04:47,970 --> 00:04:52,260
thought on trimming a tree there is a

119
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:54,660
central leader method where one central

120
00:04:52,260 --> 00:04:56,490
leader goes up and then there's the open

121
00:04:54,660 --> 00:04:59,340
center method where you're trimming the

122
00:04:56,490 --> 00:05:01,860
tree back so that it is open in the

123
00:04:59,340 --> 00:05:04,200
middle and shoots off large limbs kind

124
00:05:01,860 --> 00:05:06,000
of curling up we really need to go to

125
00:05:04,200 --> 00:05:08,070
the orchard and have the orchard guy

126
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:09,720
explain it to us but for now I just want

127
00:05:08,070 --> 00:05:11,099
to walk you through what I'm gonna do so

128
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:12,510
if you're gonna trim your own fir trees

129
00:05:11,099 --> 00:05:14,490
or a couple tools that you're gonna need

130
00:05:12,510 --> 00:05:17,220
to take along with you we're gonna need

131
00:05:14,490 --> 00:05:19,440
this little guy right here it's a corona

132
00:05:17,220 --> 00:05:21,240
it's called a razor tooth saw and

133
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:22,889
basically it's for getting your larger

134
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:24,449
limbs I don't know that we'll need that

135
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:27,660
today because our trees are fairly young

136
00:05:24,449 --> 00:05:30,090
and fairly new and also this is the

137
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:32,760
corona brand and it's really really good

138
00:05:30,090 --> 00:05:34,530
this is the third pair that I own I keep

139
00:05:32,760 --> 00:05:36,570
one in the Gator I keep one in the truck

140
00:05:34,530 --> 00:05:38,639
I keep tools on the truck because you

141
00:05:36,570 --> 00:05:40,500
never know when you'll need this guy or

142
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:42,389
this guy to get something out of your

143
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:44,729
way on a farm Road so I keep the tools

144
00:05:42,389 --> 00:05:47,639
on the truck but this is a corona brand

145
00:05:44,729 --> 00:05:49,469
also and these guys are just farm

146
00:05:47,639 --> 00:05:50,789
essentials things to have I'll post

147
00:05:49,469 --> 00:05:51,900
links down below to these tools

148
00:05:50,789 --> 00:05:54,840
tried-and-true

149
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:55,200
trusted this guy especially is a very

150
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:57,540
trust

151
00:05:55,200 --> 00:06:00,300
tool here on the farm that thing is

152
00:05:57,540 --> 00:06:01,440
heavy heavy duty all right so let's get

153
00:06:00,300 --> 00:06:03,420
busy and I'll show you

154
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,890
trimming a tree because that's what

155
00:06:03,420 --> 00:06:06,990
you're here for right all right let's

156
00:06:04,890 --> 00:06:09,270
examine this tree see these branches

157
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,010
these low branches they're just no good

158
00:06:09,270 --> 00:06:13,170
for anything they're just energy sucking

159
00:06:11,010 --> 00:06:14,820
branches so we're going to go ahead and

160
00:06:13,170 --> 00:06:18,840
we'll get our cutters and we'll snip

161
00:06:14,820 --> 00:06:21,120
those off okay we're gonna cut back here

162
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:22,710
see their growth rings right here and

163
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:25,190
that's where the hormone is the growth

164
00:06:22,710 --> 00:06:28,380
hormone in the tree if you cut it here

165
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:31,320
that is going to cause new growth if you

166
00:06:28,380 --> 00:06:34,760
cut it back here you get in that growth

167
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:37,200
ring and you cut off that new growth

168
00:06:34,760 --> 00:06:39,750
now you're gonna think I'm scalping this

169
00:06:37,200 --> 00:06:43,800
tree but if you look here you can see

170
00:06:39,750 --> 00:06:46,680
there are three major branches one two

171
00:06:43,800 --> 00:06:48,570
three and they're all coming off at the

172
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:50,850
correct angles that we want there's also

173
00:06:48,570 --> 00:06:53,190
another one here but this angle this

174
00:06:50,850 --> 00:06:56,130
crotch angle right here is just a little

175
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:58,050
tighter than what you see here okay I'm

176
00:06:56,130 --> 00:06:59,490
gonna leave this guy this year and I'm

177
00:06:58,050 --> 00:07:02,250
gonna take this one out because this

178
00:06:59,490 --> 00:07:05,250
limb here will shade that limb so let's

179
00:07:02,250 --> 00:07:07,200
cut him out now with these apple trees I

180
00:07:05,250 --> 00:07:09,150
don't want a shoot shooting up to the

181
00:07:07,200 --> 00:07:11,100
sky here I'm gonna be able to pick my

182
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:12,990
apples so we're gonna do a drastic cut

183
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,610
right here and we're going to get rid of

184
00:07:12,990 --> 00:07:16,380
this guy we're gonna get rid of that

185
00:07:14,610 --> 00:07:19,800
central leader right there because I

186
00:07:16,380 --> 00:07:21,990
want this tree to bloom out like that

187
00:07:19,800 --> 00:07:24,150
okay so that I can walk all the way

188
00:07:21,990 --> 00:07:27,480
around it and pick my apples get rid of

189
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:29,310
these little dudes now I'm gonna cut

190
00:07:27,480 --> 00:07:31,350
this one because the crotch angle is

191
00:07:29,310 --> 00:07:34,290
just way too tight okay

192
00:07:31,350 --> 00:07:36,150
I'm gonna cut him off all right then I'm

193
00:07:34,290 --> 00:07:38,400
gonna go right above this little growth

194
00:07:36,150 --> 00:07:41,460
ring area where the growth hormone is

195
00:07:38,400 --> 00:07:44,250
and I'm gonna cut right there boom I

196
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:46,590
took that central leader off and we'll

197
00:07:44,250 --> 00:07:50,730
also get this guy right here now look at

198
00:07:46,590 --> 00:07:53,220
this tree it's really lopsided so let's

199
00:07:50,730 --> 00:07:56,610
go on and get in here and take that guy

200
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:59,070
off and then this guy I think we'll be

201
00:07:56,610 --> 00:08:01,980
okay and then that's appropriately

202
00:07:59,070 --> 00:08:03,600
trimmed lopsided tree now here's an

203
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,120
example of a pear tree

204
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:06,690
that's just overcrowded look at this guy

205
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:09,020
right here

206
00:08:06,690 --> 00:08:10,610
see how that's rubbing up against there

207
00:08:09,020 --> 00:08:13,460
we got to get rid of that it's just

208
00:08:10,610 --> 00:08:15,440
growing this actually comes up off and

209
00:08:13,460 --> 00:08:17,180
grows toward the inside so we want to

210
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:20,120
get rid of this whole limb right here

211
00:08:17,180 --> 00:08:23,540
okay we want to cut him way back all the

212
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:27,410
way back to here and these cutters

213
00:08:23,540 --> 00:08:30,140
really do a good job yeah get that guy

214
00:08:27,410 --> 00:08:32,570
out of there now see this guy he's

215
00:08:30,140 --> 00:08:33,890
crossing over - okay go ahead and get

216
00:08:32,570 --> 00:08:37,070
rid of this because it's rubbing right

217
00:08:33,890 --> 00:08:39,590
there and we want to get rid of any

218
00:08:37,070 --> 00:08:41,360
diseased or broken branches another

219
00:08:39,590 --> 00:08:42,830
point to make if you're going tree to

220
00:08:41,360 --> 00:08:45,170
tree and you don't want to spread

221
00:08:42,830 --> 00:08:47,300
disease it's a good idea to have a rag

222
00:08:45,170 --> 00:08:49,280
with you and basically you can take that

223
00:08:47,300 --> 00:08:51,740
rag or take a coffee cup and pour some

224
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:53,750
rubbing alcohol in there and clean your

225
00:08:51,740 --> 00:08:56,540
clippers in between so clean your

226
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:58,820
pruners in between trees if you suspect

227
00:08:56,540 --> 00:09:00,680
any disease because if you don't and it

228
00:08:58,820 --> 00:09:02,360
has blight on it you can move it from

229
00:09:00,680 --> 00:09:04,280
tree to tree to tree let's look at

230
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:06,200
another tree look at how busy this tree

231
00:09:04,280 --> 00:09:07,850
is look at how many branches we have

232
00:09:06,200 --> 00:09:09,680
here we have a lot of growth in this

233
00:09:07,850 --> 00:09:12,200
tree and we don't need that much growth

234
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:14,900
okay so we're gonna take out most of

235
00:09:12,200 --> 00:09:17,780
these lololo branches and we're gonna

236
00:09:14,900 --> 00:09:19,640
leave probably four or five of the major

237
00:09:17,780 --> 00:09:22,340
branches with the right crotch angle

238
00:09:19,640 --> 00:09:28,880
starting down low here get a little

239
00:09:22,340 --> 00:09:30,560
sniffing going on something you need to

240
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:33,260
think about when you're doing your trees

241
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,780
in your orchard is this is your tree and

242
00:09:33,260 --> 00:09:37,640
you have artistic freedom to make it

243
00:09:35,780 --> 00:09:39,710
grow however you want it to grow so if

244
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:41,270
you wanted to grow out and go where you

245
00:09:39,710 --> 00:09:43,130
can do that you can do whatever you want

246
00:09:41,270 --> 00:09:45,440
to with your tree but you need to open

247
00:09:43,130 --> 00:09:47,030
up all these branches we're gonna have

248
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:49,100
to take some out so we can open it up

249
00:09:47,030 --> 00:09:52,480
and promote growth and get the tree to

250
00:09:49,100 --> 00:09:52,480
grow the way we want it to grow

251
00:09:58,140 --> 00:10:01,870
there's no real wrong way but you'll

252
00:10:00,520 --> 00:10:04,030
learn over time what you did wrong and

253
00:10:01,870 --> 00:10:05,770
hopefully you'll learn from it so the

254
00:10:04,030 --> 00:10:07,360
next time you do your fruit trees you'll

255
00:10:05,770 --> 00:10:08,770
learn a little bit more now I'll trim my

256
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:10,330
trees probably a little bit different

257
00:10:08,770 --> 00:10:11,710
then you'll trim your trees and a pro

258
00:10:10,330 --> 00:10:13,360
orchard guy will probably trim them a

259
00:10:11,710 --> 00:10:15,340
little bit different I suggest you go

260
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:17,920
online and you watch a bunch of videos

261
00:10:15,340 --> 00:10:19,930
ok pile all that knowledge before you go

262
00:10:17,920 --> 00:10:21,790
out and you cut your fruit trees take

263
00:10:19,930 --> 00:10:23,620
yourself some notes and get out there

264
00:10:21,790 --> 00:10:25,510
and work and have some fun enjoy your

265
00:10:23,620 --> 00:10:27,220
life be outside it's beautiful out here

266
00:10:25,510 --> 00:10:28,570
today our beautiful orchard and I'm

267
00:10:27,220 --> 00:10:30,640
really happy to share it with you guys

268
00:10:28,570 --> 00:10:32,860
so the major take-home messages here are

269
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,870
when you trim trim the ones that have

270
00:10:32,860 --> 00:10:37,390
the sharp crotch angle you're shooting

271
00:10:34,870 --> 00:10:38,770
for a 90 degree almost crotch angle if

272
00:10:37,390 --> 00:10:40,780
something is really tight it's gonna

273
00:10:38,770 --> 00:10:42,580
make a weak spot and that branch is

274
00:10:40,780 --> 00:10:44,560
gonna crack and break at some point get

275
00:10:42,580 --> 00:10:46,150
the crisscross growth out all that

276
00:10:44,560 --> 00:10:48,370
criss-crossing growth anything that's

277
00:10:46,150 --> 00:10:50,170
touching any inward growth you want to

278
00:10:48,370 --> 00:10:51,520
get rid of that inward growth if you

279
00:10:50,170 --> 00:10:53,560
have to cut the top out of the main

280
00:10:51,520 --> 00:10:55,420
leader the central leader of the tree be

281
00:10:53,560 --> 00:10:57,520
sure you leave about that much about 3

282
00:10:55,420 --> 00:10:59,440
buds on it so that in the springtime or

283
00:10:57,520 --> 00:11:02,110
in the summertime it starts to grow

284
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:03,910
outward like that so that's it you want

285
00:11:02,110 --> 00:11:05,230
