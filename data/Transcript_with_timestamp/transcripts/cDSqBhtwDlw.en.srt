we're going to clean out the brooder

22
00:01:04,239 --> 00:01:08,600
side of the

23
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:09,840
barn let the turkeys hole up in there

24
00:01:08,600 --> 00:01:13,040
for a little

25
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:16,040
bit we'll make sure that the

26
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:17,840
uh the bees don't need anything which

27
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:20,079
they they look like they're doing pretty

28
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,360
good like they look like they got

29
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,720
themselves all sealed up real tight

30
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,920
so we're going to move the chicken water

31
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,560
inside they can come out and get water

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:29,720
but they're not going to want to we're

33
00:01:28,560 --> 00:01:31,680
going to let them we're going to open

34
00:01:29,720 --> 00:01:33,880
the door for them to come out every day

35
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,320
but usually they just like to hang

36
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:38,840
around their uh their heat Source until

37
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:41,880
things go back to kind of like it is now

38
00:01:38,840 --> 00:01:43,439
in the 30s to 40s that kind of where

39
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:45,719
they're at the main thing with chickens

40
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,719
is just making sure that they're uh they

41
00:01:45,719 --> 00:01:50,600
have a if they get wet they have the

42
00:01:48,719 --> 00:01:52,759
ability to dry themselves off and they

43
00:01:50,600 --> 00:01:56,159
don't stay wet because their Combs will

44
00:01:52,759 --> 00:01:58,399
get frostbite like that and uh then

45
00:01:56,159 --> 00:01:59,920
you'll get infection and they'll start

46
00:01:58,399 --> 00:02:03,200
