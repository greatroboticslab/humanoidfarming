1
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,160
in a small community in the pacific

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,839
northwest a dynamic company is growing

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
this company has served the equipment

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,480
dealer market for 30 years they did it

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,040
by following their principles

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,840
by being the best and by being honest to

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,439
their customers

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,199
dis

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,600
technology driven

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:24,600
people focused

11
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:45,800
for ours i'm going to say for that 150

12
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:45,800
horsepower class

13
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,320
that would be our bread and butter

14
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,320
i'm going to say 90 of the tractors we

15
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:54,399
sell are in that class

16
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:56,800
on that thing there and

17
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:58,800
we've got to the point where

18
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,920
we'll get out we'll demonstrate

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,080
you know uh if we have somebody go down

20
00:01:01,920 --> 00:01:07,119
we'll run them a tractor loan one for

21
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,159
the time being to keep them going

22
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,320
on that

23
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:11,360
and then all of a sudden they come back

24
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:13,360
in hey

25
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,240
calf check was better than what we had

26
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,080
we

27
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,720
we know we need one we got a tough

28
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,080
winter coming and we planted the seed

29
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:20,799
and it came back

30
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:23,119
the

31
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:25,680
the combines and the four wheel drives

32
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,280
that'd be a very nice market to be in

33
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:28,799
but you look the hours these guys are

34
00:01:27,280 --> 00:01:31,920
putting on the machines how that's

35
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,360
changed in the last 20 years uh they buy

36
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,960
one of those that

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,360
they might they might not have buy

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,680
another one for another 20 years and

39
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:42,560
these smaller ones we can get more guys

40
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:46,000
rolling into them and if we can

41
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:47,439
get the customer just

42
00:01:46,000 --> 00:01:49,280
give them the

43
00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,759
reputation where they need to trade more

44
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:53,360
often we can keep our business going and

45
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:55,439
our part of the country is guys will buy

46
00:01:53,360 --> 00:01:57,200
them and run for 10 or 15 years instead

47
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,960
of trading after five

48
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:00,719
and we would like to get to the point

49
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:02,880
where you can get them to roll them more

50
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,960
often to keep them current keep them

51
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:07,119
under warranty and to realize how the

52
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,879
technology is changing not only for

53
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:10,879
their benefit but for ours also
