00:00:01,340 --> 00:00:05,910
welcome to this series on mastitis in

2
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:08,700
dairy cows brought to you by the

3
00:00:05,910 --> 00:00:10,980
University of Edinburgh this video is

4
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:15,290
the hygiene in the shed

5
00:00:10,980 --> 00:00:15,290
let the cows tell you a scoring system

6
00:00:15,320 --> 00:00:21,390
mastitis is the infection of the milk

7
00:00:17,880 --> 00:00:24,000
producing glands the other bacteria

8
00:00:21,390 --> 00:00:27,840
invade the teat end via the teat canal

9
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:29,670
and cause an infection mastitis is a

10
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,710
fight between bacteria invading the

11
00:00:29,670 --> 00:00:33,710
other and the cow fighting the infection

12
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,440
hygiene in the sheds let the cows tell

13
00:00:41,379 --> 00:00:46,510
you there are many different housing

14
00:00:44,440 --> 00:00:50,110
systems depending on the number of cows

15
00:00:46,510 --> 00:00:51,969
and the space that they have clean cows

16
00:00:50,110 --> 00:00:55,350
mean the system is working

17
00:00:51,969 --> 00:00:59,579
daddy cows means it needs attention

18
00:00:55,350 --> 00:01:03,820
clean cows will have less mastitis

19
00:00:59,579 --> 00:01:08,170
hygiene scouring this lets the cows tell

20
00:01:03,820 --> 00:01:11,020
you if you have a problem each cow is

21
00:01:08,170 --> 00:01:16,060
called in three areas on a scale of 0 to

22
00:01:11,020 --> 00:01:22,500
2 the areas are the flank including the

23
00:01:16,060 --> 00:01:27,630
tail the lower hind leg and the other

24
00:01:22,500 --> 00:01:30,670
houses caught in this areas as follows

25
00:01:27,630 --> 00:01:35,409
clean cows with only splashes of manure

26
00:01:30,670 --> 00:01:38,590
score a zero if there's more than a

27
00:01:35,409 --> 00:01:43,240
palm-sized amount of dirtiness it's

28
00:01:38,590 --> 00:01:47,729
called a 1 if there's more than a four

29
00:01:43,240 --> 00:01:51,909
I'm length of dirtiness then score a two

30
00:01:47,729 --> 00:01:56,979
any score of two suggests is a problem

31
00:01:51,909 --> 00:01:59,020
of shed hygiene if only the lower hind

32
00:01:56,979 --> 00:02:01,119
legs are dirty then the problem is

33
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:04,770
likely to be cleaning of passageways or

34
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:07,390
drainage where the cows are working if

35
00:02:04,770 --> 00:02:09,369
the other and the lower part of the cows

36
00:02:07,390 --> 00:02:13,000
are dirty then it is a problem with

37
00:02:09,369 --> 00:02:14,980
where the cows are lying if it is around

38
00:02:13,000 --> 00:02:18,540
the tail on the flank where the tail

39
00:02:14,980 --> 00:02:23,049
swishes is it a problem of diarrhea is

40
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:26,019
there a problem with the diet if the

41
00:02:23,049 --> 00:02:28,120
dirtiness is all over is there perhaps a

42
00:02:26,019 --> 00:02:30,690
problem with overcrowding or manure

43
00:02:28,120 --> 00:02:30,690
removal

44
00:02:36,930 --> 00:02:38,989
