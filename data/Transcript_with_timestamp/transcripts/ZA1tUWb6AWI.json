  "text": "I'm going to share with you a project that took me 8 years to finally build our garden trellis which hold our climbing roses hey I'm handyman Dan with you can build this many times over those eight years I felt so much like the mom and dad in the movie up where they were saving up for a big vacation and then life would happen they would have to break open their piggy bank to be able to pay for any bills or car repairs or Insurance you name it this is exactly how I felt but I kept my dream alive one day I was going to be able to build my climbing trellis and that day came finally in the spring of 2021 so what's with your dream about building a trellis I wanted my own trellis for a few reasons I have very fond memories of my dad occasionally bringing home a bouquet of roses to my mom and it was incredible because every time he did this her face would light up and she would always do two things first she would run up to my dad and give him a big smoochie kiss kids thank you for the reference to BL then she would immediately go to the kitchen grab a vase put the roses in the vase and put it on the center of the table for it to be displayed to everybody that walked by because of those experiences plus others I've always been very intrigued by roses yeah but couldn't you have just planted a rose bush our garden at the time was roughly 20x 22 ft so I felt like planting a whole rose bush would take up a lot of valuable Garden real estate meaning I wouldn't be able to plant vegetables in that spot plus with rose bushes I feel like you can only really enjoy half of the Rose at a time unless you walk all the way around it but trellis would allow me to more efficiently utilize my garden space and by adding climbing roses to it it was the best of both worlds and of course you can use a trellis for other climbing plants but that would ruin my story but you've never built a trellis before what gave you the confidence to be able to do it true I had never built a trellis before but when I sat down and analyzed the components of the trellis eventually I was like hey I could build this there are only five steps to this build and you will be surprised at how simple each step is and after we go over all of the steps of what it takes to build a trellis like ours I will share with you some amazing things that we've been able to do that we never expected and it made that 8-year weight so worth it we built our trellis in the summer of 2021 now coming up on almost 3 years later with Winters with a ton of snow some very harsh winds and some incredibly hot and dry Summers our trellis is still looking amazing so why even build a trellis number one it can as a focal point for your garden we built our trellis to hide our ugly stuckle wall our garden area faces the South and so our stuckle wall gets really really hot in the summer by having our garden trellis in front of the wall it's able to actually cool down that wall and hide it number two a garden trellis can act as a privacy screen for your neighbors number three the plants you grow on your trellis can bring a lot more pollinators and good bugs to your garden and number four my favorite you get a ton of bang for your buck with the amount of plants you get for the small amount of real estate that it takes up by growing vertically instead of horizontally for example our trellis is 19 ft wide the two outside parts are 8 ft tall and the center section is 10 ft tall overall we have a vertical growing space of 170 square ft now compare this to the amount of horizontal space that it takes up in our garden with the Roses planted in front of it and with it being a foot away from our wall it only takes up 2 ft in length and and 19 ft in width that's only 38 ft horizontally if I were to lay that down and compare that to how many planter boxes I would need our trellis would take up probably a third of our garden space yeah but you do construction all the time what makes you think I could build a trellis let's break down the simple components that make up a trellis to hold everything up you've got the concrete footings on top of the concrete footings you have the vertical posts connecting all of your vertical posts together you've got your horizontal beams then you've got the inner structure which I'm calling the inner frame and your inner frame holds the mesh or lattice that your climbing plants will hold on to and attach to as they grow then if you want to add a little bit of extra flare to your trellis you can add some extra trim okay yeah give me the steps step one is your design phase one tip I can offer with this is to design around your final product for our particular circumstance I knew that I wanted climbing roses I wanted a lot of different colors and kinds of climbing roses and I knew I wanted it to be a big focal point in in our garden I wanted our three climbing roses to grow and kind of mesh over each other taking a boring old stuckle wall and turning it into a wall of flowers amazing I know right one important aspect I had to incorporate into our design was to make sure that my Trellis was far enough away from our wall because the heat absorbed from the Sun in the summer months was way too much and I didn't want to cook my roses So I placed my trellis one foot away from our wall and this has allowed enough air to get behind the trellis and keep the plants cool step two is to place your concrete footings a great structure starts out with a great Foundation make sure to check out with your local building requirements on how deep and how big to make your footings for your structure I used these concrete cylinder forms from our local hardware store for the concrete footings and I actually went pretty deep because I wanted to make sure that my Trellis was going to last I got these really beefy 4x4 post brackets because they have a hole at the bottom and they have a hole on the sides and this would allow me to make a t-shape with rebar firmly connecting my post brackets to my concrete yeah these puppies weren't going anywhere and I needed this because my Trellis was going to be really heavy plus all the extra weight of the climbing roses as time went on another thing I liked about these post brackets is it had an inch standoff and so my posts would be an inch above the concrete and this would reduce the amount of water exposure from rain and snow step three is adding your structural Lumber this includes your vertical posts and your horizontal beams the nice thing is you don't really need that many tools for this you'll need a drill and a screw gun a ladder and then one tool I didn't have at this time but I wish I did was this post level this level is awesome because it allows you to clamp it on to your 4x4 post and then it'll tell you both directions if you're level I went with redwood material because of its natural resistance to rot for my vertical posts and horizontal beams I went with 4x4 material because of its structural Integrity the center section of our trellis is 9 ft wide and I knew that a 2x4 would not span that distance without sagging over time one thing that will really save you a lot of time and energy is to lay out all of your pieces before you install them and stain them it is much easier to stain them when they're all on a horizontal surface I placed all of ours on saw horses and did two coats of stain on all sides I used this valpar stain I went with the Redwood tone and I used it because it said that for vertical applications it would last 8 years and I could not be more impressed with this stuff coming up on 3 years it still looks amazing you can save a a ton of time and hassle by not having to clean out your roller every single time after you paint or stain all you have to do is take your roller and put it into the bottom of a trash bag spin your trash bag so it makes it tight and fold it over and I had times where my paint roller was still wet after 2 weeks and this was my own personal preference but I really didn't want to see many mechanical Fasteners in my trellis to connect my horizontal beams to my vertical posts I used an inch and a half dowel that I drilled into my beams and my vertical iCal posts and I used tight Bond 3 glue because it's rated for exterior use to drill my dowels I marked the center of my beams and drilled in 2 in deep I then matched that same hole into my vertical posts the only caveat to doing it this way is you need to use bar clamps to squeeze the posts together if you don't have bar clamps you can use Fasteners I also wanted to reduce the amount of risk I would have of water seeping into the tops of my posts I made sure that my top beams covered my vertical posts at the end step four is to add your metal mesh or your lattice I decided to go with a metal mesh because I felt like it was more durable yes I could have gone with a wood lattice but I didn't want to take all the time and cut all these little tiny pieces I knew it'd be really hard to get them in the perfect X shape I was also concerned about once my climbing plants went on the trellis that my connection points between the X's would pop so I went with metal hog paneling that I got from my local farming store it's galvanized and comes in 16t Long lengths which was perfect for my Center section and then I could use the extra parts that I cut off and put it on my side panels to attach this metal paneling I first had to build an inner frame in between my vertical posts and Beams I made it kind of like a picture frame with mitered Corners I just took 2x4s and ripped them down the center to get smaller pieces the list of tools needed for this step are really simple you'll need a drill and a screw gun you'll need metal Clips to attach your metal mesh and you also need a reciprocal saw with a metal blade to cut your metal paneling and then one thing that saved me so many times was was this metal platform it made it so much more convenient to cover a much wider space than a ladder would to attach these frames inside of the trellis I used deck screws by making this wood picture frame inside of my posts and beams put my metal mesh on top of it and then I could use these clips to hold the metal mesh in place the metal mesh Cuts really easy with a reciprocal saw and a metal blade I just used the Sharpie to mark down all the points that I wanted to cut I would recommend using gloves because as you're holding the metal and the friction of the blade can really heat up that metal step five is to add any extra additional decorative pieces to your trellis I wanted to cover the tops of my trellis because without these decorative pieces it just looked really boxy for art trellis I used 2x6 Redwood Lumber and at the ends I cut out a little quarter Circle to cut these quarter circles I used my grandpa's Compass to put it in the corner and then used it to scratch the line that I was going to cut into the wood then I used my jigsaw and cut that Circle I did use deck screws to attach these decorative pieces to my trellis and and surprisingly they hide really well I just made sure to make my 2x sixes wider than my 4x4 posts so that you didn't see them behind it as promised at the beginning of my video what has made this trellis so awesome has been being able to share these roses what I love is being able to take our roses and make a very fragrant bouquet for our house or my kids love taking them to their teachers but the icing on my fictitious trellis cake was when my sister-in-law asked if she could use some of my roses for her wedding bouquet talk about feeling so honored that roses from my little Urban Garden would become part of a bride's bouquet on her very special day thank you so much for watching until the end I really hope that these five easy steps have helped you feel more confident to build something like this in your very own garden or that you have a little bit more inspiration on what you want to build for yourself if you decide to build something like this let me know in the comments below how your project turned out if you found this video helpful make sure to check out our other gardening videos I have a video on how we built our garden arbor I have a video about a tour of our garden I have a video about how to install a drip system or if you want to learn how to build or fix other things I have a lot of playlists on my YouTube channel we'll see you on the next video",
