00:07:11,479 --> 00:07:15,479
analyze vast amounts of data in real

199
00:07:13,400 --> 00:07:17,400
time allowing robots to make informed

200
00:07:15,479 --> 00:07:20,360
decisions and take precise actions based

201
00:07:17,400 --> 00:07:22,599
on environmental conditions three

00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:24,479
robotic arms and grippers robotic arms

203
00:07:22,599 --> 00:07:26,639
and grippers are increasingly used for

204
00:07:24,479 --> 00:07:30,080
tasks such as planting harvesting and

205
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:32,080
handling delicate crops Advan in robotic

206
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:34,240
manipulation technology have led to the

207
00:07:32,080 --> 00:07:36,440
development of lightweight dextrous arms

208
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,000
capable of Performing complex tasks with

209
00:07:36,440 --> 00:07:40,919
high precision and

210
00:07:38,000 --> 00:07:42,879
reliability for swarm robotics swarm

211
00:07:40,919 --> 00:07:45,639
robotics involves the coordination of

212
00:07:42,879 --> 00:07:48,120
multiple robots to perform tasks

213
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:50,360
collaboratively in agriculture swarm

214
00:07:48,120 --> 00:07:53,560
robotics enables robots to work together

215
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:53,560
to cover large areas

216
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,319
