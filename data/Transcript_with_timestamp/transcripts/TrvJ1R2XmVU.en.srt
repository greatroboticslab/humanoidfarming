00:00:00,299 --> 00:00:04,920
hello my name is Ashley today I'm going

2
00:00:02,639 --> 00:00:07,140
to show you how to make homemade natural

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:10,200
pesticide

4
00:00:07,140 --> 00:00:12,480
so what for the trees that when you have

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,280
bugs and things like that emphas to how

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,820
to get rid of it without putting

7
00:00:14,280 --> 00:00:21,480
chemicals so what it is is in a cup you

8
00:00:17,820 --> 00:00:24,000
put some water and you have any kind of

9
00:00:21,480 --> 00:00:26,039
jalapeno pepper that's really hot you

10
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:28,680
take the stems out

11
00:00:26,039 --> 00:00:31,140
you just drop it in

12
00:00:28,680 --> 00:00:33,000
as many as you want four or five because

13
00:00:31,140 --> 00:00:36,540
the cup is you know not too big so you

14
00:00:33,000 --> 00:00:38,820
put about six seven five whatever two or

15
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:40,860
three doesn't matter just close the if

16
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,379
you have any kind of blender it doesn't

17
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:45,899
matter this kind of blender doesn't

18
00:00:43,379 --> 00:00:47,040
matter any blender it will work you just

19
00:00:45,899 --> 00:00:49,140
close it

20
00:00:47,040 --> 00:00:51,300
make sure I was gonna say that put the

21
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,000
gloves in your hands still it's not hot

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,460
yet but after you do the work you make

23
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:59,960
sure for I'm gonna make a noise for a

24
00:00:56,460 --> 00:00:59,960
second I'm gonna blend it

25
00:01:09,420 --> 00:01:15,540
you take it out and see if

26
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:17,640
there is any big pieces which is all you

27
00:01:15,540 --> 00:01:19,880
see it it's crumbled use a few more

28
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,880
minutes

29
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:28,200
it takes about two to three minutes a

30
00:01:25,080 --> 00:01:29,939
second that's all you need now I have to

31
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:31,560
wear my gloves you know from the

32
00:01:29,939 --> 00:01:35,159
beginning you can wear it it's almost

33
00:01:31,560 --> 00:01:38,939
always it's safer and sometimes when you

34
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:41,880
do this the fume it can burn your nose

35
00:01:38,939 --> 00:01:44,700
like the so what you do is you can put

36
00:01:41,880 --> 00:01:47,400
sometimes your mask on so what you do is

37
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,680
you take a cheese cloth or any kind of

38
00:01:47,400 --> 00:01:51,840
material that little bags which I use

39
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:55,259
this a lot for a lot of things to use

40
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:58,020
for dish for the kitchen you put in a

41
00:01:55,259 --> 00:02:00,000
strainer and under there is a plastic

42
00:01:58,020 --> 00:02:04,020
container Tupperware it doesn't matter

43
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:07,520
whatever it is make it simple easy

44
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:07,520
you go through to the

45
00:02:07,799 --> 00:02:12,920
to the cloth the cheesecloth and you let

46
00:02:11,099 --> 00:02:15,300
it

47
00:02:12,920 --> 00:02:17,879
not because we have to put in a spray

48
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:21,420
bottle we don't want any particle pieces

49
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:23,160
because it will plug the the hose the

50
00:02:21,420 --> 00:02:25,260
pipe

51
00:02:23,160 --> 00:02:27,480
and it's good to wear a mask like I said

52
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:29,879
it's kind of hot perfumes

53
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:32,520
but anyway I have to show you this way

54
00:02:29,879 --> 00:02:35,099
and then what you do is

55
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:38,819
I have a spray that I bought it here

56
00:02:35,099 --> 00:02:41,280
this is for my spray that I paid to

57
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:42,780
spray my

58
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,920
trees

59
00:02:42,780 --> 00:02:45,920
I have to open it

60
00:02:47,459 --> 00:02:52,800
you put some water in it it's about like

61
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:55,500
a gallon gallon and a half again it

62
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:58,860
doesn't matter warmer hotter it is the

63
00:02:55,500 --> 00:03:01,400
spice spicy it is it's better in a

64
00:02:58,860 --> 00:03:01,400
gallon of

65
00:03:02,120 --> 00:03:06,720
you pour it in

66
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:10,879
and you close it

67
00:03:06,720 --> 00:03:10,879
make sure that you close it very tight

68
00:03:11,159 --> 00:03:15,840
because whenever you spray it now

69
00:03:13,140 --> 00:03:16,920
whenever you spray make sure this time

70
00:03:15,840 --> 00:03:20,220
really

71
00:03:16,920 --> 00:03:22,019
well this is the best way to do it

72
00:03:20,220 --> 00:03:24,300
and when you have to spray it you have

73
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,940
to wear a mask and a goggle

74
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,980
otherwise it will from the air from the

75
00:03:26,940 --> 00:03:31,200
wind it's gonna blow your side and it

76
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:33,599
might burn your eyes or your breathing

77
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:36,780
all right thank you very much this is

78
00:03:33,599 --> 00:03:40,080
very simple Israel be inspired and try

79
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:43,580
it thank you very much for watching I'll

80
00:03:40,080 --> 00:03:43,580
