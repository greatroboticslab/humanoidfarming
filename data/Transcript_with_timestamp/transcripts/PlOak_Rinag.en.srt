00:00:00,800 --> 00:00:02,880
Hello everyone.
This is Youngsang Cho\h

2
00:00:02,880 --> 00:00:06,560
And welcome to JADAM
As you know from the other videos,\h

3
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:12,240
I have been farming 60 different kinds of crops\h
every year for researching the effects of JADAM\h

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,560
natural pesticides.
And with those results, I was able to publish\h\h

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:22,160
2 books on organic pest and disease management.
And in today's episode, I want to talk about\h\h

6
00:00:22,160 --> 00:00:24,320
controlling aphids.
Which is a very\h\h

7
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:29,440
common topic between farmers to gardeners.
I have already released all the recipes in\h\h

8
00:00:29,440 --> 00:00:34,560
the book called JADAM Organic pest and diseases
control. But In this video, I want to show a\h\h

9
00:00:34,560 --> 00:00:42,480
little more straightforward result of using JADAM
natural pesticide and how it affects the aphid.\h\h

10
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:47,600
and I will also show you the comparison of
commercial eco-friendly products VS the\h\h

11
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:51,520
JADAM one at the end of the video.
If you have been watching my channel,\h

12
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:55,920
You have probably noticed what I repeatedly\h
say about pest and disease control.\h

13
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:01,680
"Once you have managed to control aphid\h
and powdery mildew, you are good to go"\h

14
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,200
It means once you treat those two things\h
you can be a master of natural pesticides.\h

15
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,640
All we use is the simple solution,\h
and here we are again I'm showing\h\h

16
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:15,680
you the same ingredient
from the previous videos.\h

17
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,960
And if you are watching for the first time, I\h
know you won't believe it but yes it does work.\h

18
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,960
With the combination of these 5 ingredients, you\h
can control almost all pests and diseases that\h

19
00:01:26,960 --> 00:01:32,880
can occur during the farming season.
Yes, all means from thrips to anthracnose.\h

20
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:41,920
One big different thing about JADAM pest solution\h
is that you have to make the JWA, JHS, and JS.\h

21
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:45,440
This could be the cons of this technology,
however,\h

22
00:01:45,440 --> 00:01:49,600
in this way, you will spend about\h
20-time lesser amount of dollars\h

23
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:55,120
and I guarantee that every JADAM solutions\h
are powerful and most eco-friendlier than\h

24
00:01:55,120 --> 00:01:59,120
commercial chemical or organic pest\h
and disease solutions in the market.
 \h

25
00:01:59,120 --> 00:02:03,600
which I think is attractive\h
to manufacture by yourself.\h

26
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:09,360
I will put up the link on the top so if you are\h
new, please watch other videos on how to make\h

27
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,880
JWA and JS.
 
It is a truly great solution,\h\h

28
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:17,360
but You will need to pretest all your\h
solution before spraying them in the\h

29
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,400
a large field, you will not want to have\h
bad side effects from a large dosage.\h

30
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:27,840
Anything excessive is always not a good solution\h
and we all learned it from our childhood.\h

31
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,920
For that, I wrote down all precautions\h
that could happen with the ingredient.\h

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:38,160
So please read it before trying it by yourself.
Now let's begin with the life cycle of aphids.\h

33
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:43,520
We know that aphid is one of the most\h
destructive pests to plants in temperate regions.\h

34
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:49,920
They are active from April to October, and they\h
become an adult within a week and live up to\h

35
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:56,480
one month. You might think it is short\h
and why do we need to think about them.\h

36
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
But the real problem comes from their babies.\h

37
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:08,080
It does not have a mating period and reproduces an\h
average of 15 baby aphids per day and which is not\h

38
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:09,120
the egg.
The egg\h\h

39
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:14,320
needs a few days to hatch but babies,\h
start eating right after birth.\h

40
00:03:14,320 --> 00:03:17,840
Moreover, all those offspring\h
babies are mostly female,\h

41
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:22,400
which means if you fail to control\h
all in a certain period your\h\h

42
00:03:22,400 --> 00:03:27,680
crop will be filled with aphids.
This is the reason why they\h\h

43
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:32,720
could earn the title of destructive\h
agricultural pest in the entire globe.\h

44
00:03:32,720 --> 00:03:36,080
If you are a farmer or gardener,\h
you know what I'm talking about.\h

45
00:03:36,080 --> 00:03:42,320
Even if there are other solutions to treat\h
aphids, it does not eliminate all but a few.\h

46
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:46,560
Killing a few aphids does\h
not help the farmers at all.\h

47
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,920
Because survived one will\h
reproduce their babies again.\h

48
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:56,080
We need something stronger but safer\h
and more reliable way to treat them.\h

49
00:03:56,800 --> 00:04:01,040
And you will no longer worry\h
because you are watching my videos.\h

50
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:08,000
Once you successfully control aphids, you can\h
make other solutions for different problems.\h

51
00:04:08,960 --> 00:04:13,040
This is the picture that I have\h
taken while researching aphids.\h

52
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:16,080
The leaves were clean before,
but we needed them to\h\h

53
00:04:16,080 --> 00:04:21,520
be tested with our solutions.
so, I have not sprayed anything for a while.\h

54
00:04:21,520 --> 00:04:26,960
And we don't worry about the plant.
Because we know it will die anyway\h\h

55
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:32,960
with the solutions.
As I have explained repeatedly in all my videos,\h

56
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:38,080
that it is mandatory to use soft\h
water to make JWA, JS, and JHS\h

57
00:04:38,640 --> 00:04:44,400
When we are talking about soft water, which\h
means it contains low calcium ions and\h

58
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:48,640
magnesium ions.
So where can we collect soft water?\h

59
00:04:49,440 --> 00:04:54,720
well, it is quite easy to find one from the\h
rain, distilled water, air conditioner water,\h

60
00:04:54,720 --> 00:05:00,400
dehumidifier water, and also from the ground.\h
Or you can make your own water softener.\h

61
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:06,080
But please do test the water by yourself with JWA.\h

62
00:05:07,920 --> 00:05:11,840
And there is the reason why we tell\h
you the importance of soft water,\h

63
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:15,360
It is because of the wetting\h
properties of the JADAM solution.\h

64
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:21,680
As you can see from the picture, a solution used\h
with soft water will wet the leaves completely\h

65
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,160
This means the effect and success rate\h
of pest solutions will also increase.\h

66
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,640
Let me briefly show you how\h
to test the water with JWA.\h

67
00:05:31,200 --> 00:05:38,000
Simply add a few drops of JWA, when the water is\h
clear for a couple of minutes then it means the\h

68
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:44,640
water is used for pest solution.
But if not, it means the water has less wetting\h\h

69
00:05:44,640 --> 00:05:50,240
properties and it will leave a mark on the
the surface of the leaves, then\h\h

70
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:54,640
eventually those marks will build\h
up and block the photosynthesis of\h

71
00:05:54,640 --> 00:05:57,840
the crop.
Moving on to the JHS,\h

72
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:04,160
If you have used the correct water, then\h
the color of the solution remains the same.\h

73
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:07,840
But if not, it will quickly turn brighter.\h

74
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:15,360
It could also happen if you stored it the wrong\h
way, if the JHS is fermented, it will be useless.\h

75
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:23,600
You have to store it airtight, and you have\h
to boil the herbs right after collecting them.\h

76
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:30,400
I have also posted a video on how to make JHS with\h
simple tools. So, if you haven't watched it yet,\h

77
00:06:30,400 --> 00:06:34,080
Please go ahead and watch\h
the other videos as well.\h

78
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,840
If you have purchased one of our\h
books, I have also elaborated\h\h

79
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,680
in detail on how it can be made and
the recipe for each and every solution.\h

80
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:50,640
But if you are a gardener with no access to\h
ginkgo JHS and don't have enough time to make all\h

81
00:06:50,640 --> 00:06:54,800
of this,
You can just use the JWA alone, by increasing the\h\h

82
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,520
amount of JWA, the pest control rate increase.
And another solution\h\h

83
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:05,360
is to add sodium hydroxide along with JWA.
As you can see from this picture,\h\h

84
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:09,680
I have elaborated all the ratios.\h
During the prevention period, you\h

85
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:16,160
can add 5 liters in 500 liters, then gradually\h
increase the ratio as shown in the picture.\h

86
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:22,560
So, I have just told you that\h
Ginko JHS won't be that necessary,\h

87
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:29,840
But there is a pest that only ginko JHS can treat.
Which are stink bugs, flea beetle, leaf miner,\h\h

88
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:35,040
mosquito, and more.
So please use JHS if you are facing these pests.\h

89
00:07:35,680 --> 00:07:40,800
Gingko is one of our favorites, but you can\h
also find alternative herbs to make it with.\h

90
00:07:41,920 --> 00:07:48,160
And there are some pests that make the leaves\h
curl inward, such as leaf-curling aphids.\h

91
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:52,800
In this case, you will have to focus on\h
winter control and prevention control.\h

92
00:07:52,800 --> 00:07:58,720
Because the solution won't be effective if it\h
does not contact the aphid's living habitat.\h

93
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:04,880
And utilize the kickback reaction of pest solution\h
on the landscape fabric when you are spraying\h

94
00:08:04,880 --> 00:08:11,840
on crops in which the leaves\h
are all located on the ground.\h

95
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:18,400
If you look at the footage here, these are the\h
aphid that I collected from the apple tree.\h

96
00:08:19,200 --> 00:08:23,200
The apple tree leaf has lots of\h
hair on the back of the leaf.\h

97
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:26,800
Which makes it harder for\h
farmers to control aphids.\h

98
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,200
Abondance hair indicates less penetration rate.
Therefore, I have added 20 liters\h\h

99
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:37,520
of JWA on a 500-liter ratio.
Now I have sprayed the solution,\h\h

100
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:41,440
and as you can see that the aphids are not moving.
Which is a good sign.\h

101
00:08:42,400 --> 00:08:47,680
The shot was taken during hot weather and I\h
do not recommend spraying the solution under\h

102
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:50,400
the sun due to the evaporation rate.\h

103
00:08:50,400 --> 00:08:53,840
However, we can still\h
observe that it is effective.\h

104
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:02,480
For a better close-up view,\h
I brought the leaves inside.\h

105
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:04,320
It has been about 1 and a half hours.\h

106
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:10,160
And from then I filmed for 7\h
hours straight with timelapse.\h

107
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:18,400
And it looks like the control rate is about 98%
I have added 20 litters of JWA into 500Liters of\h\h

108
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,600
water which is equivalent to 800ml in 20
litters of spray bags.\h

109
00:09:27,040 --> 00:09:32,560
However, it is not so necessary to add such an\h
amount. You can definitely go lower than this one.\h

110
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,880
Now let's move on to the final\h
comparison with the commercial products.\h

111
00:09:38,880 --> 00:09:43,520
Of course, these products that I am using\h
is also qualified organic pest solutions\h\h

112
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:45,040
specially made
for aphid.\h

113
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:50,720
The middle one is the JADAM solution and the\h
left and right are the commercial product.\h

114
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,400
As you could see here, both sides\h
of the leaves is not wet enough.\h

115
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:03,840
Which means there is no sign of penetration.
But the JADAM solution in the middle is fully wet.\h

116
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:12,320
I filmed this footage for seven hours and from\h
my point of view, these products cannot be\h

117
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:17,280
called aphid solutions. Because\h
at first, it didn't work right\h\h

118
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:22,880
so I sprayed double the amount but
still could see nothing much changed.\h

119
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:28,240
As time passes the leaves are getting dry, and the\h
left and right leaves, you could barely see the\h

120
00:10:28,240 --> 00:10:34,000
aphids because it all moved away.
I will show you how it looked at the first stage.\h

121
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,080
You could see there are big differences\h
between the before and after shots.\h

122
00:10:43,040 --> 00:10:48,800
The commercially available pest solutions are\h
expensive and the result is very disappointing.\h

123
00:10:49,520 --> 00:10:55,280
I thought it would have at least a 95% of control\h
rate, but most of the aphids just ran away.\h

124
00:10:56,000 --> 00:10:59,520
I don't think all organic pest\h
solutions have this kind of problem.\h

125
00:10:59,520 --> 00:11:05,360
But I am disappointed with the price and the\h
effects of these famously known organic pest\h

126
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:05,920
solutions.\h

127
00:11:06,880 --> 00:11:12,000
Researching pest and disease control is not a\h
privilege of scientists and professors from the\h

128
00:11:12,000 --> 00:11:17,680
laboratory or university research team.
Anyone can start researching things they want to.\h

129
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:21,040
Just grab a sprayer and start\h
to make your own recipe.
\h

130
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:31,600
So lastly, I would also like to speak\h
about the tools for spraying pesticides.\h

131
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:37,680
Just spraying the pest solution is not everything,
The tool also plays a big role in agriculture.\h

132
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:43,280
In the next video, I will show you how to make\h
a sprayer stick that is easy to make and very\h

133
00:11:43,280 --> 00:11:47,200
effective with the JADAM solution.
I hope you have enjoyed the video.\h

134
00:11:47,200 --> 00:11:51,200
If you are interested in our\h
book, please go to the link below.\h

135
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,840
And I will back with more interesting videos.
Thank you for watching.
