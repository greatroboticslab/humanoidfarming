1
00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:05,600
so supplemental winter feeding uh with

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:08,559
uh primarily with hay um one of the

3
00:00:05,600 --> 00:00:10,480
things that we do is um it's a lot

4
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:11,599
easier to feed hay this time of year

5
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,400
september

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:16,080
october early november because we're not

7
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:18,080
as wet

8
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:19,920
so in the barn behind me over here are

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,680
our fall cows

10
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:22,960
and so they're they're actively calving

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,960
at this point in time and so we've

12
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:27,199
brought them off of our pastures and

13
00:00:24,960 --> 00:00:29,439
we're feeding them hay right now

14
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:31,679
and letting our pastures regrow so that

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,680
we can stockpile that grass

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,520
and then once it gets a frost on it it

17
00:00:33,680 --> 00:00:37,520
increases the sugar content so whenever

18
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:40,000
these cows are done calving

19
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:41,760
and the first of november

20
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,440
we're going to kick them back out of

21
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:45,600
this of this area and they're going to

22
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:47,280
go back out on the fescue pastures which

23
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:48,879
have been stockpiled they've had a frost

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,000
on them the sugar content is almost

25
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,199
through the roof

26
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,440
and so they're going to have better

27
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,680
nutrition on those fields then when it's

28
00:00:53,440 --> 00:00:58,800
wet and it's harder to feed hay in a

29
00:00:55,680 --> 00:01:00,960
conservation friendly way

30
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:02,719
so we're feeding the hay here in the

31
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,960
barn on concrete we're collecting that

32
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:06,479
manure we're distributing that manure

33
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,080
where it needs to go

34
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,799
primarily back on hay fields where the

35
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:12,159
hay came from originally

36
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:14,640
and then in the winter time we're not

37
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:17,680
out rutting our fields up by packing hay

38
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,520
out into the fields uh we do

39
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:20,560
always have to feed some hay out in the

40
00:01:19,520 --> 00:01:24,000
fields

41
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:26,479
and when we do that we use hay rings

42
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:28,720
or we also use uh unrolling so we'll

43
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,320
unroll the hay out on the pasture

44
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,400
and it depends upon the scenario if it's

45
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,560
really soupy and wet

46
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:36,079
if you unroll the hay in our experience

47
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,680
you're going to have a tremendous amount

48
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,400
of waste

49
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,920
and you want to unroll hay basically you

50
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:44,560
want to give them one day's allotment at

51
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,360
a time if the ground is not frozen

52
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:47,280
um

53
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:49,040
and so if the ground is not frozen and

54
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:51,520
it's really wet and soupy then you've

55
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:53,280
got to pack hay out every single day

56
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:54,479
to keep it to where you're not losing a

57
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,560
bunch of hay

58
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,040
so when is when conditions are like that

59
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,399
uh we hope to be grazing stockpile uh

60
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:01,680
but if we're not able to graze stock

61
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:03,600
power for whatever reason then we're

62
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:05,360
going to feed hay in rings

63
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:07,200
and so then we can feed maybe a week's

64
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:08,879
amount of hay on one day we can get out

65
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,560
there while the ground is frozen early

66
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,160
one morning or something

67
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:13,920
but if conditions are right we really

68
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:15,440
like to unroll hay because it spreads

69
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:17,680
those nutrients out in those pastures so

70
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
much more effectively and i think we get

71
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:21,200
when the conditions are right

72
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,840
we get much better utilization of the

73
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:24,840
hay and less waste
