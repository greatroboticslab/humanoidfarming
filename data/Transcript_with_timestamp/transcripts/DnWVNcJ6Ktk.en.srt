dealer market for 30 years they did it

5
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:15,299
by following their principles by being

6
00:00:13,139 --> 00:00:17,839
the best and by being honest to their

people focus

10
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,399
you know the biggest thing with a return

11
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:46,680
on assets is we have a lot of inventory

12
00:00:44,399 --> 00:00:50,579
turnovers which as anybody knows

13
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:52,260
inventory turnover really helps win

14
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:54,420
with your return on assets because

15
00:00:52,260 --> 00:00:56,820
you're able to keep that moving and

16
00:00:54,420 --> 00:01:00,300
that's part of the reason that it was it

17
00:00:56,820 --> 00:01:04,260
as as high as it was we had a very good

18
00:01:00,300 --> 00:01:06,920
year both monetary and unit typically in

19
00:01:04,260 --> 00:01:10,140
the moving the units really had because

20
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:12,420
we we have a large inventory for the

21
00:01:10,140 --> 00:01:14,340
most part keeping somewhere around 150

22
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,939
units

23
00:01:14,340 --> 00:01:19,560
used units on on these on the grounds at

24
00:01:17,939 --> 00:01:22,320
any point in time and so we'd like to

25
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:23,759
look at it as if we can keep that moving

26
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:26,040
we're going to be more profitable in the

27
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,799
end which that's what the return on

28
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,140
assets definitely show and by moving on

29
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,580
that all the time yeah it's good it

30
00:01:31,140 --> 00:01:34,320
makes us feel it's nothing else better

31
00:01:32,580 --> 00:01:37,040
