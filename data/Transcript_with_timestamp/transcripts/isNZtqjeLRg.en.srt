1
00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:04,720
how many ways can you love a planter

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:07,480
well I'll give you three reasons that I

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:09,960
love this Tiara Verde rubber planter

4
00:00:07,480 --> 00:00:12,519
number one is it's made of recycled

5
00:00:09,960 --> 00:00:15,200
tires so you're helping keep tires out

6
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,760
of landfills but number two that rubber

7
00:00:15,200 --> 00:00:19,880
makes it unbreakable the third reason I

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,240
love it is this giant water reservoir in

9
00:00:19,880 --> 00:00:24,720
the bottom so the water will stay below

10
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,240
this grate your plant will stay on top

11
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,279
and that'll keep it from getting root

12
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:31,960
rot but your plant will still get the

13
00:00:28,279 --> 00:00:31,960
water that it needs
