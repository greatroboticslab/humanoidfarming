  "text": "Did you know you can grow peanuts from grocery store nuts? Here's the lazy way to grow a snack factory. Use raw peanuts, not roasted. Soak them overnight to boost germination. Plant in sandy soil. They need room to grow underground. Space 6 in apart. They love full sun and warm weather. Water when soil feels dry 1 in down. Watch for yellow flowers. They'll bend down and dig into soil to form peanuts. In four to 5 months, fresh peanuts ready to roast or boil. Save for planting day.",
