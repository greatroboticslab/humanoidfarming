1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,120
got done cleaning

2
00:00:01,480 --> 00:00:07,120
up the Weld and I can see the crack a

3
00:00:04,120 --> 00:00:12,480
little bit better so it

4
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:15,119
goes really from here all the way up to

5
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:18,640
here and

6
00:00:15,119 --> 00:00:23,439
then he goes all the way

7
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:27,039
around I'm not the best welder guys

8
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:29,679
but the previous welds were not deep at

9
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:32,200
all and they're basically surface level

10
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:36,160
that's why I didn't hold so hopefully I

11
00:00:32,200 --> 00:00:36,160
can do a little bit better let's

12
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:43,760
see so we just got done it's not the

13
00:00:41,800 --> 00:00:47,280
best but I'm probably going to have to

14
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:52,160
come back because middleway through this

15
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:54,920
uh nice welding event I ran out of

16
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,960
gas but uh we'll paint it up and then

17
00:00:54,920 --> 00:00:59,719
we'll have to come back and address it

18
00:00:56,960 --> 00:00:59,719
later
