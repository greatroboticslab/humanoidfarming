  "text": "[Music] [Music] So folks that meet us say, \"Oh, so you guys are no tillers.\" And I say, \"No, we're not no tillers. We're regenerative a people, enthusiasts.\" because uh noill is not a system. Noill is one tool that we use. You can't be successful if you think you're going to be a no- tiller because you have to change your paradigm about what you plant the diversity. um keeping a living root and especially integrating cattle because uh we think that the cattle are the most important thing. I'm going to name drop a few folks that are influential in my life. There's a guy named Jim Garish who uh came to a grazing school in Watertown, South Dakota, and made us repeat 10 times during his session. I will not be afraid to waste grass, which is uh just a real change for us. There's a man out in western Canada named Steve Kenyon who custom grazes cattle for folks. He has some of his own herd and he's got sheep now. But he said when when people say it takes a thousand years to add an inch of top soil, he says I can increase top soil by an inch in 7 years through integrating cattle. Um those people get me excited and that's why I enjoy what we're doing and it's just a whole bunch of fun to have Eli agree with me and get excited about it, too. [Music] I got sold from Gabe Brown. Um when when Barry had had listened to him um before I had and and you know I think it was uh about January 2018 when I I saw him at a soil health coalition uh conference and listening to him talk about what he does. Um it's a goal. It's great because we know now we have so many things we could accomplish on our farm. It's just we're always building on it. But when he said that he would bet his farm against anyone's farm that what he does would work on their farm, uh I took that as a challenge to prove him right instead of a challenge to prove him wrong because why wouldn't you want to be doing what he's doing? And the biggest thing for us I think was the context part. Um you you can fail easily at at anything if you try. But if if you look at your context and you and you study what your climate is, uh how things will fit into your system, you can make soil health work on every acre anywhere. We've lost acres and added acres in the last 10 years. Um, we we added a few quarters of of heavy soil in this area and we added another quarter or two of just some really light soil. And it's our approach is the same. You it's, you know, what can we do with soil health on those acres? And we know it's going to work if we just stick to the principles and and look at at our our context of all that. You know, when we did look at our context, we we were thinking, okay, we we like the cover crops. We want we want more cover crops. We want we want to be able to plant as many species as possible every year. And so we were we were doing uh spring wheat for small grain. And and we realized that we didn't have enough growing season to to get the cover crop growth after spring wheat. So, one thing we we did was we started planting a lot more winter wheat. Uh we're doing a lot of oats this year, just knowing that we can get that crop off earlier and get a cover crop going. You know, we we did 17 species this year of cuz we know how many pounds an acre of each thing we can add. So, one of the things we did is converted crop land to pasture. Um, and that was a learning experience, but it worked out very well for us. And, uh, and now we're transitioning that field back into crop land because we can, I guess. Uh we we never want to give up the experiments because every conference we go to, we hear something new that we just got to try on this farm. And I I guess at this point I need to say that without the South Dakota Grassland Coalition and the South Dakota Soil Health Coalition, we probably wouldn't have gotten access to an awful lot of excellent material that we've assimulated. And I appreciate the folks that are willing to go to a conference, stand up in front of a crowd, and explain to us what they've been doing. So, we're going to work on staying on this land as as long as possible. And, you know, we we've got the river bottom land. We know none of it's native because sand was really easy to plow. And so, we we need to work on on that land. We we know that the previous practices on it had depleted it. What it was before that is what we need to get back to. what the, you know, the migrating buffalo did to it. We need to replicate that and and work with that and and we know that it'll be beneficial and it'll it'll make the land more valuable and it'll it'll keep my family here, our family here for generations.",
