1
00:00:18,050 --> 00:00:22,619
first of all let's get the matter of
introductions out of the way if you

2
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:29,519
don't Bob garsten Charlie Thomas here
goes this is Bob Bart

3
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:33,870
if you see him again this winter you
won't be wearing a hat fan either and

4
00:00:33,870 --> 00:00:38,309
here's John Thomas who's constant
attention to growing and processing seed

5
00:00:38,309 --> 00:00:44,190
corn is your crop insurance for next
year the result of this partnership is

6
00:00:44,190 --> 00:00:48,059
an institution dedicated to the
production of superior seed corn the

7
00:00:48,059 --> 00:00:52,110
largest and most modern plant in
existence more than a hundred thousand

8
00:00:52,110 --> 00:00:56,969
bushels of pioneer hybrid seed were
dried sorted graded and bagged here this

9
00:00:56,969 --> 00:01:00,780
year
the warehouse 300 feet long and with the

10
00:01:00,780 --> 00:01:05,460
capacity of more than 40,000 bushels was
recently built to accommodate the

11
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:21,810
increasing volume and how and why it's
useful put more money in your pocket but

12
00:01:21,810 --> 00:01:26,850
before we see what has been done with
hybrid corn let's take a look at a field

13
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:33,000
of open pollinated corn I think you'll
recognize maybe we can refresh your

14
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:39,439
memory about the faults and the flaws of
open pollinated pause

15
00:01:43,370 --> 00:01:49,170
anywhere in the Corn Belt fields of open
pollinated corn greets the eye this one

16
00:01:49,170 --> 00:01:56,390
isn't a bad feel in fact it's pretty
good but it won't bear close inspection

17
00:01:56,750 --> 00:02:00,600
garstin Thomas have thousands of
visitors every fall to insist upon

18
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:04,590
seeing the difference between open
pollinated corns and pioneer hi-bred

19
00:02:04,590 --> 00:02:09,420
corn
nor worse than the average field yet

20
00:02:09,420 --> 00:02:13,320
there's a decided lack of stiffness here
which is notably present in the hybrid

21
00:02:13,320 --> 00:02:17,970
fields your to visit later you will
observe a general lack of stiffness and

22
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:23,540
style looks like the cows had been in
the corn

23
00:02:27,410 --> 00:02:32,750
there's an appearance of sagginess due
mostly to fall in stocks stocks that

24
00:02:32,750 --> 00:02:38,210
break before the ears mature caused
champion dropping ears not sound corn

25
00:02:38,210 --> 00:02:42,670
and not conducive to large yields

26
00:02:47,709 --> 00:02:52,239
the stocks upon which these ears were
produced went down early with resultant

27
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:56,769
rottenness of the ear limber stocks are
easily blown down that are difficult to

28
00:02:56,769 --> 00:03:02,349
pick either by hand or by machine when
the wind is accompanied by rain the

29
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:07,769
Fallen stock attempts to come up again
and in so doing forms a gooseneck

30
00:03:07,769 --> 00:03:13,180
another reason for stocks falling is a
poor weak root system a typical fault of

31
00:03:13,180 --> 00:03:18,609
open-pollinated corn later you will
contrast this root with the heavy

32
00:03:18,609 --> 00:03:26,560
pioneer hi-bred root the lack of
uniformity in pint of ears of open

33
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:31,629
pollinated corn slows down picking
materially for this reason corn picking

34
00:03:31,629 --> 00:03:36,310
contests are practically always held in
high bred fields where the contestants

35
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:42,069
show to the greatest advantage the
uneven position of ears seen here does

36
00:03:42,069 --> 00:03:48,340
not permit rapid or efficient husky
another fault of open pollinated corn is

37
00:03:48,340 --> 00:03:55,269
the fact that the ears themselves drop
off so easily on windy days a mechanical

38
00:03:55,269 --> 00:04:04,700
corn picker can't pick up these ears a
human corn picker doesn't like to

39
00:04:04,700 --> 00:04:09,150
after the corn picker has been through
the open pollinated field the job of

40
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:14,730
picking up fallen ears yet remains this
extra task is wholly unnecessary in the

41
00:04:14,730 --> 00:04:21,299
pioneer hi-bred fields which you'll soon
see 10% of the corn was left on the

42
00:04:21,299 --> 00:04:25,830
ground too much to leave but a lot of
work to get and here's what you finally

43
00:04:25,830 --> 00:04:34,380
do get on uniform size shape and quality
for the lack of uniformity and bigger in

44
00:04:34,380 --> 00:04:40,370
the field that we've just looked at is
that you don't know which pollen grain

45
00:04:40,370 --> 00:04:46,250
pollinated each separate pound in other
words you don't know who the daddy was

46
00:04:46,250 --> 00:04:52,830
no one would be so foolish as to try to
improve livestock without selecting the

47
00:04:52,830 --> 00:04:58,740
finest sire the reason you get a
prize-winning bull or a good boar is

48
00:04:58,740 --> 00:05:03,540
because some breeder has selected his
grandparents with the greatest of care

49
00:05:03,540 --> 00:05:09,660
now let's take a look at a field of
pioneer hybrid corn where we do know the

50
00:05:09,660 --> 00:05:15,540
father from the grandfather in fact we
know all of the ancestry for ten

51
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:23,580
generations back the cloud gets larger
you know what they say about building a

52
00:05:23,580 --> 00:05:32,520
better mousetrap this is daily routine
during harvest time at the Garston

53
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:38,300
Thomas plant in Coon Rapids where
visitors are welcome seeing is believing

54
00:05:38,300 --> 00:05:44,480
here's an example of what pioneer hybrid
seed corn will do for you

55
00:05:44,630 --> 00:05:49,130
there's an ear on every stock the ears
are at a uniform height and the stops

56
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:56,090
are standing up stiff straight and
strong and the ears will bear plenty of

57
00:05:56,090 --> 00:06:03,890
inspection to again the uniformity of
height is extremely noticeable product

58
00:06:03,890 --> 00:06:08,930
of two adjacent hills three emphasizes
the uniformity of the ears for size type

59
00:06:08,930 --> 00:06:15,200
and quality they're a noonday meal for
any horse pioneer produces corn of real

60
00:06:15,200 --> 00:06:20,900
quality it's good feed and it markets at
top prices what all of you who've

61
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:25,760
marveled at hundred bushels per acre
yields you're now seeing one hundred and

62
00:06:25,760 --> 00:06:29,660
ten bushels to the acre what do you
think of this neighborhood of healthy

63
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:35,690
ears called the Gold Coast by one
visitor 110 bushels to the acre means

64
00:06:35,690 --> 00:06:40,520
eighty eight hundred pounds of ear corn
it takes sturdy stops to hold up this

65
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:45,950
kind of a crop how beautifully they
stand we can even see angle risers

66
00:06:45,950 --> 00:06:50,600
crosswise through the corn field
take a look down that aisle a pathway to

67
00:06:50,600 --> 00:06:52,900
prosperity

68
00:06:54,450 --> 00:06:59,230
and what's more the ears don't fall off
when the wind blows remember how easily

69
00:06:59,230 --> 00:07:05,330
they fell in the other field smoke that
one in your pipe mister

70
00:07:05,330 --> 00:07:10,740
corne can't stand up without a root
system either go ahead and pull it out

71
00:07:10,740 --> 00:07:18,449
it can be done but it takes plenty of
help these roots go down where the

72
00:07:18,449 --> 00:07:24,509
plants will endorse your arm they oughta
produce corn

73
00:07:24,509 --> 00:07:27,690
they've had plenty of opportunity to
absorb a lot of nourishment from the

74
00:07:27,690 --> 00:07:34,979
soil and they did produce a lot of corn
roots tell a lot of the story of pioneer

75
00:07:34,979 --> 00:07:38,789
hi-bred corn which one of these two
loops do you think has the best chance

76
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:43,020
to get down where the moisture and plant
food are which one will hold the stock

77
00:07:43,020 --> 00:07:53,940
the straightest a pioneer hi-bred root
is four times as large the mechanical

78
00:07:53,940 --> 00:08:01,229
Quantic are also gets a real chance to
do a good job in hybrid corn sooner or

79
00:08:01,229 --> 00:08:06,509
later all farmers will be using the corn
thicker the heavy root system sturdy

80
00:08:06,509 --> 00:08:11,070
straight stops and strong shanks of
Pioneer hybrids are well adapted to

81
00:08:11,070 --> 00:08:16,430
mechanical foreign thinking
this is corn raising reduced to a

82
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:21,740
science in a few minutes that wagon will
be back full of corn from four rows

83
00:08:21,740 --> 00:08:25,210
seventy rods long

84
00:08:28,439 --> 00:08:31,569
when picking coin by hand or
mechanically

85
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:37,329
how convenient it is to find the ear at
a uniform height on every stop there

86
00:08:37,329 --> 00:08:43,539
aren't two inches difference in the
height of ears just to show that these

87
00:08:43,539 --> 00:08:46,570
individual hills aren't unusual for this
pioneer field

88
00:08:46,570 --> 00:08:54,940
let's pick three consecutive hills how
uniform they are in height how nicely

89
00:08:54,940 --> 00:09:00,740
they break out
and what fun to pick these Golden Ears

90
00:09:00,740 --> 00:09:11,360
and man what up prophet three adjacent
hills nine big fine quality ears harder

91
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:16,010
to hold them to husk over here the corn
pickers already made one round seventy

92
00:09:16,010 --> 00:09:19,300
rods long and here's the tape

93
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:25,010
hold on there old boy over then we can't
blame you at that they'd never believe

94
00:09:25,010 --> 00:09:30,980
you back home if you didn't have some
corn to back it up and over in the

95
00:09:30,980 --> 00:09:34,430
corner of the field the loaded wagons
are dumped the coin elevated onto

96
00:09:34,430 --> 00:09:40,550
waiting trucks and headed for the
processing plant in one day three men

97
00:09:40,550 --> 00:09:46,670
with a corn picker have picked 2,000
bushels from 19 acres of land and loaded

98
00:09:46,670 --> 00:09:54,440
it onto the truck again we repeat corn
raising reduced to a science and saw the

99
00:09:54,440 --> 00:09:57,230
town it goes and while we string along
behind

100
00:09:57,230 --> 00:10:01,070
let's glance at the field that was
picked with the sturdy straight pollen

101
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:07,160
rows left standing the corn from these
pollen rows is never used for seed but

102
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:10,750
is later picked and fair

103
00:10:25,780 --> 00:10:31,310
back at the Platte our cargo potential
seedcorn gets ready to face its Judgment

104
00:10:31,310 --> 00:10:33,470
Day
it looks mighty fine out there in the

105
00:10:33,470 --> 00:10:37,730
fields and it would be excellent in any
grain market or feedlot but it must

106
00:10:37,730 --> 00:10:42,320
undergo many severe and exacting
processes before it becomes pioneer

107
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:48,020
hybrid seed corn the quality hybrid
truckload after truckload of carefully

108
00:10:48,020 --> 00:10:52,580
bred corn is hauled from farms of nine
counties in the vicinity of the garstin

109
00:10:52,580 --> 00:10:57,110
Thomas plant corn that has been brand
and grown under vigilant supervision of

110
00:10:57,110 --> 00:11:03,020
pioneer experts the crowds of visitors
are always interested in studying the

111
00:11:03,020 --> 00:11:07,420
many reasons for pioneer supremacist

112
00:11:07,840 --> 00:11:13,700
good substantial businessman beans all
interested in learning why pioneer can

113
00:11:13,700 --> 00:11:18,560
afford to extend its famous replanting
agreement to all purchasers to find out

114
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:23,360
why pioneer can back up performance with
an agreement that makes this hybrid seed

115
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,910
as good as a gilt-edged bomb

116
00:11:31,410 --> 00:11:37,529
ah Niagara of golden well pours over the
top and down the conveyor belt into the

117
00:11:37,529 --> 00:11:42,989
large bins beneath cream-of-the-crop
disscourn but still only embryo seed

118
00:11:42,989 --> 00:11:46,949
until it has been processed thoroughly
to fulfill the rigid requirements

119
00:11:46,949 --> 00:11:52,829
pioneers are max only 60% of these tears
are good enough to become pioneer hybrid

120
00:11:52,829 --> 00:11:56,009
seed pod
the rest will be fed on Bob Darcy and

121
00:11:56,009 --> 00:12:04,379
Charlie Thomas's farms in the sorting
plant another chef leaves another comes

122
00:12:04,379 --> 00:12:11,639
on duty and the ear corn faces its first
acid test three shifts a day 230 men to

123
00:12:11,639 --> 00:12:16,229
a ship just a cross-section of a large
number of men whose skill and hard work

124
00:12:16,229 --> 00:12:22,259
makes possible a hybrid like pioneer
approximately 8,000 bushels are handled

125
00:12:22,259 --> 00:12:27,419
in the sorting back each day only one
variety is inspected at one time to

126
00:12:27,419 --> 00:12:32,159
insure against any mistake in
classifying each ear is individually

127
00:12:32,159 --> 00:12:37,409
examined every damage channel is removed
all off-site beers are discarded and

128
00:12:37,409 --> 00:12:42,720
only the choice corn is dropped in the
Box foresee inferior or light ears are

129
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:50,329
rejected no farmer ever started his own
seed with greater care

130
00:12:55,770 --> 00:13:00,700
from the hundreds of skilled workmen
farm minded young men from Nebraska

131
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:06,430
Missouri Iowa and Kansas emerged the
checkers those links hide inspectors who

132
00:13:06,430 --> 00:13:10,590
reexamine every ear and every kernel to
make sure there has been no oversight

133
00:13:10,590 --> 00:13:19,300
the words are famous and handy check and
double-check this careful sorting and

134
00:13:19,300 --> 00:13:24,720
restarting is another reason why pioneer
corn grows uniformly and vigorously

135
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:30,550
uniformity is elemental in quality
hybrid corn it took many seasons of

136
00:13:30,550 --> 00:13:36,490
breeding to get ears like these they
still have a long hard path to go but so

137
00:13:36,490 --> 00:13:43,990
far they have proved beyond doubt to
have quality and breeding the choice

138
00:13:43,990 --> 00:13:48,130
corn that survives this series of
inspections is conveyed directly from

139
00:13:48,130 --> 00:13:52,330
the sordid piles by way of a conveyor
belt system which transports it to the

140
00:13:52,330 --> 00:13:58,500
root of the large frying bins and fence
into the cribs below

141
00:14:05,060 --> 00:14:10,500
portable dryers along the side of the
cribs force hot air through the corn six

142
00:14:10,500 --> 00:14:15,449
oil burning front Swift fans driven by
60 horsepower motors maintain a constant

143
00:14:15,449 --> 00:14:22,079
temperature of 110 degrees just like a
hot wind off the Kansas wheat fields the

144
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:27,269
constant hot air pressure reduces the
moisture content to 12% and assures

145
00:14:27,269 --> 00:14:31,920
splendid germination later guarding the
seed against possible danger from cold

146
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:40,220
weather

147
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:45,680
the corn now sorted checked and dried
and already over some top hurdles

148
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:51,830
proceeds on its way up the ladder of
success to the corn Shelley at full

149
00:14:51,830 --> 00:14:57,700
capacity these chalets can shell 1,000
bushels an hour

150
00:15:07,890 --> 00:15:13,050
on the top floor of the grading plan the
sorted dried and shelled corn starts its

151
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:17,490
homestretch trip through the main plant
the postgraduate course and processing

152
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:23,070
that adds finishing touches to a truly
great scene for several sets of sodding

153
00:15:23,070 --> 00:15:27,360
drums separate the large kernels from
the small kernels and the pea we in fact

154
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:31,680
circles are removed
breeders on the floor below divide the

155
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:37,260
large round from the large flat and the
small round from the small flat making

156
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:42,899
for kernel sizes accurate grading
