  "text": "well good afternoon everybody Welcome to our Wednesday weekly webinar um after today's uh speakers are going to be Dr David Sakowski and Shandra Zan balinsky and we'll uh give you a little more information about them here in a second but uh first off what a little reminder we have one more webinar after today uh Dr Clifford Hall and the person who's gone today Dr Julie Gard Robinson will be presenting uh the final one uh don't forget these are also being recorded and they'll uh then uploaded to YouTube and those will be posted on the field of fork website if you ever want to go back and listen to them or you know of somebody else who missed it who want to want to watch and also don't forget for questions just type them down in the lefthand corner there number five here on this screen and uh the speakers will be able to watch them down the chat area and answer those questions a little later one more thing to go over before we get started is the shirt survey that Julie always wants to remind you about you should be getting that sent you in an email but it's pretty important to fill those out because this is a grant project and um those responses are very important um to kind of finish up the information you know to for research uh for the grant and she's also going to be picking people at random to win prizes for those that actually have completed the survey so another B us to do that so today's topic is food safety inspections and audit requirements and as I mentioned our speakers today are going to be David Sakowski and Shandra Zan balinsky uh David Sakowski is an associate professor in the department of Agra business and applied economics his teaching responsibilities include courses in agricultural law farm and Agri business management and food law Shan Rima balinsky serves Burley County as the family and consumer Sciences agent with indu extension service after graduating from the University of Minnesota and the Twin Cities she became a food science technician with the research and development team at General Mills developing new and Innovative frozen food products shra chose to return to North Dakota to be near her family upon redeploying from Iraq in 2009 she furthered her food science and food safety background with Cloverdale Foods company where she transitioned into the director of Technical Services position leading the food safety and quality control effort there she was the technical team lead during audits from FDA USDA sqf local food audits in according to the food code and several other informal inspections and now I'll pass it along to today's two speakers go ahead guys all right well I'll take it from here thank you Scott nice introduction and I just really appreciate all that he did to get us up here technologically um I as he mentioned we'll be co-presenting with David and we're happy to bring you today's topic which is is being ready for food safety inspections and Audits and we are going to elaborate today on really two different categories of these types of inspections and audits the government does have their say in how we produce food as we would provide it for others not necessarily in your own kitchen this is more of a a commercial standpoint you're making whether it's at the farmers market making jelly or even producing apples to sell to somebody and the other aspect of inspection could be driven from private sector uh that could even be something related to um you know you as as a consumer might drive a certain standard that you'll be looking for in the food that you would purchase for consumption okay so moving on past the two subjects here unless David has anything to chime in we'll move on to his notes Here in background thoughts okay David are you with us I'm with you I had muted my button sorry apologize all right the food industry is more complicated than we may realize the food laws in the United States extend back to roughly 11 years maybe even beyond that but over time as issues have Arisen in our food industry uh our laws have been expanded and I think it's an accident but when you look at the laws that we have for our food industry I categorize them into five sectors there's the laws that apply to your input suppliers people that are providing medic medicines for livestock for example a second sector is the agricultural producer the people with the uh Orchard of trees the uh grain Growers the livestock producers the third sector would then be the food processing where we take those EG Commodities process them into food products number four it becomes the retail and the food service it's our grocery stores as well as our restaurants our cafeterias at our institutions and then number five of course is what we're all try striving to serve and those are the consumers and you look at the US laws and they really do seem to fit into these five categories again I don't think anybody intended to be that way it just seems to be the way it has evolved over the past Century today we're going to primarily focus on what are some of the rules for those of us who are agricultural producers for those of us who are food processors for those of us who are involved D in uh food retail sales and many of the businesses in the food industry fit into one of those categories I'm a farmer so I'm in the category of agricultural producer or I'm a food manufacturer I'm a food processor or I operate a grocery store uh I'm in the retail sector but we also have businesses and perhaps this is the type of business that many of us are thinking about this afternoon and that's a a business that fits into several of these sectors I might be raising the fruit on my track of land I process that fruit into a well keep it simple into a jam and then I sell that jam or that jelly at the retail sector so I find myself with my simple business in all three of these key sectors rather than just one of these sectors So today we're going to find ourselves trying to understand each of these sectors at least a little bit uh but I want you to have these three in mind as we go forward today we also have government requirements whether it's federal government requirements state government requirements local government requirements obviously government requirements if we're subject to these rules we must meet them we have no choice there is also in the private sector where businesses within the food industry are documenting their expectations they're formalizing their expectations for the other food business if I'm going to buy your food product and use it in my food business and whatever it is that I'm manufacturing for the consumer I expect you to meet certain standards and to have some uniformity among these standards try to make it a little simpler for the industry the industry is developing collaboratively developing standards that we're going to refer to today as private sector standards or perhaps as food industry standards so as a operator of even a small firm I may find myself thinking about the several different sectors of the food industry in which I'm operating I may find myself having to think about the government regulations as well as the private sector standards as we look at those in this hour we're going to find that there's some similarities among the government regulations and the industry standards we're also going to see that there's some differences just a little graph then that I use to try to organize my own thinking we have the three sectors we have the different uh levels of expectations the the federal government for example USDA and the FDA are the two a are two of the agencies that uh have lead responsibility for the food industry what does the federal government expect of our agricultural producers it's often referred to as good agricultural practices or Gap and here we're going to see that in the past several years it's especially in the most recent year there are regulations now that the FDA needs to enforce for those Farm operations that are producing fruits and vegetables for example for The Fresh Market what are those good agricultural practices that I have to use in my farming operation likewise the USDA and FDA have regulations for the food processors often those are referred to as good Manufacturing practices or sometimes they're referred to as ssops standard sanitary operating practices or procedures and then of course there's the one that many of us have heard about the hup the hazard analysis and the preventive controls the really isn't that much Federal Regulation of retail and Food Service we're going to find instead that the retail and food service is primarily at the state level so we move down one of the roads in this graphic we for example have the north Cota Department of Health which has Authority and responsibility for food processing within the state so this is in collaboration with the federal agencies but it also has then the responsibility for the retail and Food Service sectors the municipalities the counties likewise have responsibilities and they are combined in with what I call the state and local uh government regulations then we get again to that private sector where the Private Industry is setting forth standards and we want to make sure that those standards are being met those private standards are being met with an audit and certification process so just a graphic to try to illustrate the variety of topics that we're going to be touching on this afternoon yes and um just to add to it saying we are going to elaborate a little bit on the private sector and what that means to you um but without getting too overwhelmed on whoa what is all this and what do I need to follow we're gonna we're going to lay it out for you so if you think about right now in your mind what type of product you produce we will get to it so in this case let's say that you produce uh apples for a farmers's market you're likely going to fall under the Gap agricultural producers sector and and if you are processing anything we like to use that example of maybe jelly or I I saw canned goods last year you're under the food processing sector couple of examples okay we'll skip to the next slide okay and so again we're going to elaborate a little bit about the private sector and I'm G to I'm going to read the quote here that we have the private sector standards often take the form of contracts and basically what these contracts are saying is I'm not going to purchase your product unless you can document that your product is safe and meets specific standards and sometimes these buyers I'm thinking of a couple examples Sam's Club Costco they have different standards than uh maybe Walmart might but every nearly every uh retailer has some type of standard and that's what we mean by private sector standards that they require before they're going to buy your product before you as a consumer can even buy um so we're we're saying to ourselves well whose standards do we need to follow is it the government is it private sector well let's see here let's let's get into it so we have a couple enforcers we're going to break it down between and really our answer to that question that I left you rhetorically here just a second ago was you may want to consider both standards and sometimes you have to what we have to follow is the government and of course the government enforces its regulations we're going to give you a few examples later on uh they do this through inspection and so I have a couple Graphics up here USDA uh and I heard this quote from the grocery manufacturers Association about five years ago the GMA indicates that about 85% of what you are consuming is SDA inspected from a federal standpoint now and about 15% might be USDA okay so USDA inspect anything organic most all meat products that are sold across the state border uh there's a couple Exceptions there and uh eggs within the shell you'll see that there's an example of a mark of inspection here that the USDA inspector that you can see the plant number 38 they leave their mark behind and you know that inspectors were there the entire time that they were producing uh so the government is one enforcer and the the other enforcer is above and beyond the government and these are the companies that say hey we have a certain set of standards that we're going to require sometimes above and beyond federal or state or even your Farmers Market inspections and that leader is gfsi Global food safety initiative and these are leaders across industry and Academia government organizations they get together and they make sure that there's a benchmark meaning that they're kind of harmonizing an approach to managing food safety across the industry okay so we really have both standards here and we're going to break down the differences in a little bit okay so David government inspections okay so I'll take this here in the beginning but we have meat and poultry processing which is and I mentioned it earlier we saw an example of the mark of inspection when when you're producing meat and some of you might be on the call that you know you you bring uh grassfed beef or something too I know here in bismar we have a great producer brings grass-fed beef and many other different types of red meat to our local farmers market and they're very popular um well they are typically locally inspected but if they were to transport across state lines they may need to be USDA inspected and they actually might be I I shouldn't quote exactly USDA is a continuous inspection so if you're if you're creating cuts of meat or slaughtering from the hours of 7: am to 700 PM you're going to have an inspector there the entire time so they can mark that inspection um we also have food processing which is again regular inspections by FDA and state this could also be locally through your county depending on what your setup is and this actually is the majority and FDA doesn't necessarily have a set particular time they're not here 247 like USDA would be in your facility I should say um they are really typically an annual basis okay but you never know when they're going to come so you always have to be operating up to standard and then you have your retail and Food Services sectors where there are regular inspections by state and local and typically here's the neat thing the results are usually posted online and so when I go into uh sixth grade sax classes or even ninth grade High School uh I I pop these so that they can see what's going on and they feel kind of empowered okay skipping on here David are you back well I tell you what I'm I I'll take this and continue ongoing um so the the examples that we're we're just giving you a highlight here in this slide this is kind of a boring slide but honestly if we're going to tell you that we have some examples of government regulations and then what we're going to do is we're going to pair up the government regulations to the differences in private sector why are we giving you these examples we want you to be empowered through your small business and we're really targeting here anybody that's producing especially for your local markets your farmers markets to come up with a food safety plan because at some point this is going to apply to you whether your Market has local inspectors now or not they likely will in the future we we want you to maintain uh a certain level of safety there we're going to discuss the similarities and differences as we get on uh to the next few slides here okay so David here has a slide okay so David is just commenting in the bottom that we cannnot I I don't don't believe that we can hear him so I'm going to take the the hup uh food processing regulation here that he's got now whenever you see a regulation uh from a federal standpoint you're going to see typically it's title 21 now this is 21 which usually relates to FDA and then you have the Cod of reg regulation so it's kind of like a chapter 117 David was telling me earlier that this 117 is new within a year relative to the food safety modernization act feasa and so we have a written risk control plan this is a food safety plan with many different elements and you know hup is actually now required across all federal plants it it wasn't for a very long time but what has the beauty of hup even though it seems somewhat mundane okay we've got to do all this paperwor we have to make sure make sure that we're demonstrating that we're producing safely you not only need to produce safely but you have to demonstrate it on paper well this is preventing the onset of foodborn illness that's the big thing here um it's and this is especially important when you're producing for consumers not just somebody at home at your own dinner table so we have you have you're required to enhance it uh identify the risks it could be that you use a um let's say you're making ground beef or um let's say that you you you know there's a lot of metal and one of your conveyor belts as you wash your fresh produce from your Farmers Market there might be a risk of metal within your product so you are at a point in which you you have to make sure that you're mitigating that risk that would be an example so there's a few different types of risks we we have physical we have chemical and then we have biological which would be your microorganisms again the the gist that you need to know is that hup is required by the government and if you don't have a requirement now and you're producing food to sell you may very well soon have this requirement and it looks like David might be back up and running here soon we have hey wonderful to have you we just get looked at slide number 17 David welcome back can you hear me this time yeah we sure can thank you I'm embarrassed that uh it didn't work out I apologize and thank you for continuing with the comments uh we just briefed over a little bit about hup and and the necessity and we're back on this slide okay number 16 or number 17 17 17 so do we need to go forward one more okay I think we explain cup unless you need to collaborate no I don't think I need to uh expand on your discussion of hup we can go on to the next slide as we indicated we have the processing sector that is subject to hup the federal government is primarily responsible for the food processing sector when it comes to the retail and the food service sector most of the regulatory responsibility lies with our state and local governments the task of developing detailed regulations for each of the 50 states that becomes quite a challenge you think about Minnesota having to develop such a set of Standards Montana having to develop such a set of Standards North Dakota having developed such a set of Standards so instead over the past several decades the states working with the Food and Drug Administration have come up with standards that are suggested that are recommended to all of the state and local governments so that way if the state and local government wants to adopt these detailed regulations so they oversee the retail and Food Service sectors of the industry they don't need need they as the local governments they as the state governments don't need to start from Ground Zero they have a food code to consider so the FDA working with others has a food code that is suggested to the state and local governments and what do we have on this very busy slide is simply some of the topics that are included in the food code but it shows the range of issues that we're always thinking about in the food industry the food retail the Food Service uh sectors the management the Personnel are the managers of the companies buying into these responsibilities and making sure that the firm is meeting these expectations are the people who are working in this firm even if it's only a couple of individuals do they understand the standards that they must function by do they understand the practices that they might must use for themselves chapter three then is the food how do we handle the food how do we make sure that this food is being stored and handled safely uh how do we make sure that the food is being separated from or kept separate from non-food products uh number five the equipment or excuse me chapter four the equipment the utensils the Linens that we might use at our food service uh restaurant details reminders as to what we need to do within our business to have the safe food product water plumbing and waste disposal the physical facilities the building itself is it clean is it is it easy to be kept clean do we have the proper lights do we have the proper ventilation are we keeping the rodents and others um undesirables outside of the facilities these details are addressed in the food code again the food code developed by the FDA in collaboration with others offered to the state and local governments so that the the state and local governments have a solid foundation on which to develop or in which to adopt regulations without having to begin with a clean slate instead they have solid suggestion chapter number seven the poisonous and toxic materials need to keep that separate from the food want to keep that separate from the food and then chapter eight in the food code talks about the compliance and the enforcement the inspections and uh what is expected of the firms so just a quick introduction to the food code uh the topics at the range of topics that are addressed in the food code and that these are suggestions for the state and local governments to consider right and David if I could give an example on that last slide now when you're talking about the food code here's an example of when I've encountered it from an audit standpoint and Scott mentioned when I was first introduced I was the food safety and Technical Services director at Cloverdale foods which is housed in Mandan North Dakota over here near bismar and we had an inspector that came in at least once a year what sometimes twice a year and they would audit us to this food code at our retail store which which is called The Country Store they originally came up with this idea well hey we have some Oddball packages of hot dogs that we produced or maybe a hammer two and we don't have enough at the end of the run to put it in an entire box but we want to make a couple bucks on this perfectly good product well they came up with this retail point so if we were to Define retail and food service for those of you who don't know exactly what we're talking about that grocery store that Country Store turned into a retail point in addition to that they said hey let's make some good sentes so that because they're pretty far west of town and there's not a lot of restaurant options and they wanted people to get back to their shift on time they came up with a food service Point as well in other words they were the last step before consumers eat the product think Deli now they they started making ham sandwiches and things of this nature and then they were turned they turned around and became as well a food Serv service venue so this food code is what they were audited for so when we're going through these standards think about how it applies to your business just a brief example a little more detail on the Food Code we just chose the inspection and the uh correction of violations if there are any just chose that as a topic to expand on again the food code talks about the frequency of the inspections this is going to vary from state to state even though uh the food code is suggested for the entire nation uh annually and maybe at least once every two years depends on how the uh State or the local government feels they are capable of conducting these inspections uh the access to the facility that certainly is expected that one would be uh uh one would be available for the inspector to look at your business to be able to make sure that you are in compliance as the inspection is completed the inspector provides a report to the uh firm as well as we've already been indicated and report to the public as to what was found if there were any violations and uh sometimes those even show up in the newspaper if there's an imminent health hazard something that catches the inspector's atten that is very serious uh there's authority to begin shutting down the business until that type of a serious health hazard is corrected uh so these are just some of the type of topics that are included in the food code that a person would want to have some familiarity uh it you're not going to study these documents necessarily in extensive detail uh because they are uh considerable amount of information in them but you certainly want to have yourself familiar with them and as you identify the portions of these regulations these government standards that apply to your business yes you will need to study those in detail okay right that's exactly right so now we've we've elaborated a little bit on the government requirements we talked about hup earlier um we we kind of breezed over a little bit about uh FD a as well as USDA that has the hup inspections we talked about the food code which primarily relates to retail and food service now we talked a little bit earlier about the private sector we're going to elaborate here a little bit uh consumer and industry-driven auditing again is above and beyond the governmental inspections and you might ask yourself whoa this is getting why how does this apply to me this is getting a little uh you know globally here now this is above my level but we want you to be aware of it because the important thing here is that consumers have a a very influential drive here in the food safety sector uh in Industry consumers want to know what's in their food and that really does translate to a small kitchen oriented business as it pertains to the farmers market we want you to be familiar with with uh gfsi and they're recognized they're called schemes okay so there's these are the various different schemes and what we mean by that is uh that let me just Define gfsi let me take a step back I I kind of introduced it earlier but gfsi is industry driven and it provides guidance on Food Safety Management Systems along the entire supply chain so thank seed you know Farm to tables okay and then and on our next slide here we'll elaborate a little bit about the different sectors of the schemes um but really what this gfsi represents it's an organization it represents the leading food safety experts whether they work in the retail area manufacturing food service companies this also includes government as well as Academia NDSU extension as an example uh so many different organizations they meet across the globe and they promote a benchmark standard so that anybody that is sqf recognized or fssc22000 or there's a brrc global standard picture there in front of you anybody that has one of these certifications is above and beyond their peers and you know that if I'm producing a hot dog in India with sqf certification it's going to be to the highest food safety standard that it would be here in the United States um this especially applies Global Gap specializes specifically in the agricultural side of things so the growing side of things so if you find a producer of wheat or um you know tail or you know think where we get during you know up here in North Dakota it's cold and we can't get fresh produce year round well this if you you know as a consumer as well as somebody who might have a small business this is something that pertains to you I know that these are the recognized standards and they're as good as I can get here in the United States if they apply to the the same certification so that's an introduction to the various different types of schemes and they're across a few different let's skip to the next slide now across a few different sectors so the bubbles in blue there on the right hand side of the of the screen it breaks it down into the different types of businesses that might apply to these standards we have the agricultural production okay David what's an example of a product there do you think that would apply to our Farmers Market certainly would look at our fresh fresh fruits and vegetables uh that those are being produced and then made available directly to the consumers yes absolutely and then also I know once in a while we'll get those beef fed or those grass-fed beef uh producers or your pork producers that could also be food processing now when we talk processing that's anything that alters it from its original state that could be smoking of meat uh mixing salting uh chopping grinding you know the government does Define processing uh but this could be that you folks who are making we have a wonderful producer of sourdough bread here at our Farmers Market bismar that SAR bread I mean I try to stock up during the summer so that would be a processing example uh we also have the the standard applies of retail and food service and there's also a sector in there for under retail and food service for if you're just housing product there is a standard to make sure that you're doing it right you're keeping it temperature controlled if it applies and all kinds of things so these are the different standards and these are broken into the categories farming of animals of fish of plants grains and pulses is a separate one uh all kinds of things all the way down to uh production of seed that's very important production of food packaging so the people who are making the Plastics make sure that the polymers don't leak into our food these are some examples okay how are these Audits and certifications handled um if if I want to be certified uh do I need to apply to one of these schemes and then if I am part of one of these schemes how do the people who operate the schemes monitor my actual activities do you want to answer that one well that's a great question yeah that's a great question and really what they do is you have at least an annual audit and what they do is they typically can go through and we'll talk about this later your record your paperwork from the entire last year that they were there typically they'll go through the last 90 days of documentation so an example would be we talked a little bit earlier about uh laundering and Pest Control uh they would look at the last 90 days of Records to make sure that any of the smoks or lab coats that we used were washed in a with a chemical that would verify that no microorganisms were able to live whether it was a high enough temperature or a chemical that killed it so when you're producing jelly in your kitchen you want to make sure and have clean overgarments or protective gear when when you're doing your processing you know so that is it's by way of audits I hope answer the question does anyone have any questions right there is honey considered processed I see we have a question that's a good question I I'm going to start out with the answer and David could probably uh continue it depends is the answer and I will say that some honey you can you hear of the term raw honey okay is uh typically filtered and that would not be considered a process because it would still be at same state um honey in the past and I don't have the numbers in front of me and I don't want to scare anybody but has been associated with one particular microbe that lives in an an anerobic environments so no air there um and so usually when you get honey especially from the store there has been through the hasset plan that we mentioned earlier a critical step to make sure that that bug has been eradicated and usually that's a heated step so it it Heats it now some people believe that it gets rid of some of the natural entities that are within the honey when it's uh heated heating is a process so the majority of what you get at your retail point is heated people come to a farmers's market sometimes to get the raw honey but then you need to know the risk there that you know there there is a slight very slight possibility you would have a microbe there oh I have not David I don't know if you want to elaborate other questions please yeah please be sure to send them out what we want to do now for the next few moments is just to make a comparison between the FDA regulations and some of the private sector standards and we've just chosen uh for the purpose of our discussion this afternoon some good agricultural practices and remember good agricultural practices means that we're talking about what's going on on the farm or what's going on in the vineyard or the Orchard and you look at the FDA regulations as was introduced earlier this afternoon when you see part 112 that particular regulation is less than a year old but here are some of the topics that the FDA Reg Ates uh in terms of what's going on on our farm operation the qualification of the Personnel the training of the Personnel their hygiene practices the health of the Personnel we don't want an ill individual handling our food while it's being processed agricultural water is the water uh such that it's not going to add contaminants to our uh agricultural commodity or to our food what type of biological uh items are we are we adding to our soils are we properly composting the waste materials that we might be wanting to use in our soils how about the presence of animals and so forth so we see a list of topics that these are some of the uh details that the FDA addresses with good agricultural practices now let's look at the private sector we chose sqf just as an example and sqf they address what are the requirements for the site where we are handling this fresh fruit fruits and vegetables on the farm how are we handling the product how's it being stored again the personal hygiene and Welfare what are the practices of packaging the Water Management the soil management the harvesting practices by go we begin to recognize the government regulations and the private sector standards they are addressing many of the same concerns they're not identical but there certain certainly are commonalities so we going to go into a little more detail and again we've just Chosen One FDA regulation to illustrate here are some of the expectations that the federal government has in the United States if you're dealing with products that are being produced on the farm being handled and prepared so that they can go directly to The Fresh Market uh this is what we need to be thinking about we need to be thinking about the equipment the knives the implements the mechanical Harvesters the cooling equipment the belts the conveyors on which the food is passing as we are handling it and getting it ready so here are just some of the details in this type of a regulation are these items up to standards in terms of making sure we minimize the risk of contaminating the food looking a little further into that FDA regulation are you using equipment and tools that are of design and built in a way that they're easily clean because we certainly don't want to have an item that we can't get clean and therefore we risk contamination as we continue to use it are is the facility clean is it easy to clean the facility is the product being stored and maintained in a way that uh again minimizes the risk we continue one step further and we look at this regulation in a little more detail and this is just one of multiple regulations but here again uh how is the equipment built is it built in such a way that the the scenes where the pieces of metal come together uh are easy to clean and we're we're hopefully uh able to keep the uh equipment free of contaminants are we inspecting this equipment to make sure that it's clean are we maintaining the equipment so that it doesn't get damaged and therefore become a a point of risk in our business are we uh using it in the proper way are we sanitizing it properly uh the equipment the tractors the forklifts the other vehicles the containers in which the foods are being set are these being used in such a way that we are reasonably reducing the risk uh that are foreseeable within our business operation so here is a very quick and dirty example of a Federal Regulation and now let's take a look at what are some of those fundamental requirements from the private sector okay right and so then we move into we're still using our example of sqf and uh we you know I'm going to start pointing out the similarities now sqf breaks it into modules okay and it doesn't matter what type of business what type of product you're producing everybody in sqf has to follow module two so you know that if whether it's uh canned good or if it's h shrimp the premises the building and all the equipment just like the FDA regulation indicated needs to be done uh you know basically handled in a safe manner in order to produce the delivery of safe food so um next in in the code we have the supplier then needs to follow whatever module is relative whether it's module 3 to 15 relative to the type of food product they're producing so for those of you on the next slide now in module 7 who are producing the fresh fruits and vegetables which is the majority of our Market farmers markets uh you want to make sure that you're following these things okay so your Machinery especially your conveyors uh your harvesting and processing rigs are of sound construction then they'll break it down a little bit further the contact surfaces of the conveyors which is why I said especially uh harvesting and processing rigs shall be designed and constructed and and you can read here an an efficient way of handling the product so that any surfaces that directly and this goes across the board any surfaces that directly hit the consumable portion of the food contact or food surfaces so we call it direct contact is is cleaned and handled in a way that will mitigate food faes risk so you know the example I can give here when when I think of knives totes um trays I appreciate that they're actually giving some examples the FDA example gave a couple of the same examples so really this is this is benchmarking the standard and you might say well why the similarities okay well it looks like you're not really going above and beyond with sqf beyond what the regulation requires because remember this is industry driven well the the novelty here with the private sector AIT is that you're benchmarked across the globe okay so you're able to export and import and all of a sudden you have more opportunity to make more money okay the bigger your Market is so again that's why we're here there are some similarities the novelty in our country is that our government requires things to be very similar so you don't have to come up with two sets of Standards so for the most part our message is as you're creating standards for your farmers market and producing safe product this is a start looking at these examples that we've given you here the knives um the containers that you're using so uh let me skip to the next slide and continue this is the last slide of examples here the water tanks are sufficient um clean at the right frequency so maybe it's a monthly maybe you can demonstrate that they're not dirty within the month so a month is long enough and you can do that by you know plating the microorganisms whatever your um you know setup is you can you can show in your kitchen that there just isn't any obvious signs of grime until you know you know for two weeks and then that's what your cleanliness frequency is you get to set that up uh one more example here I am typically the one who goes out to our 4 camp in Washburn to set up our kitchen last year was a huge year for us as a lot of you might know with the grant uh at the new building we also and I I credit the director Brad for ensuring and sticking to his guns on making sure that the knives and the totes and all the different plates that are used out there are commercially certified I'm bringing this example up because it pertains to well you're thinking about starting a business where you make jelly for the farmers market and jam and preserves well what kind of equipment should you buy the auditor his name is Anton here in Burley County and the City of bismar he's with the Environmental Health Department they're located at the Public Health Building he is the one who and his team and he typically goes around and Audits and the first thing that he'll look for is certified commercially represented forks and knives and and you know metal mixing bowls he knows that if he sees these commercially stamped uh knives and forks and Cutlery that he knows you know what you're doing and I'm not endorsing any one particular product brand but NSF is an example of one of those commercially uh recognized and certified um cutlery uh manufacturers is what I'm trying to say and so if you see NSF on your forks when you're out at the I just ate at a steakhouse here on Sunday and I saw that NSF was stamped in their Forks so you can start looking for that I would spend a little extra money on the commercially commercial kitchen recognized equipment if if you're starting from scratch okay uh so this is an example of uh you know how you you have to have a way to clean it but you can start out with the right stuff okay so moving on here David I'll pass it you to interiew our discussion this afternoon has been talking about what's going on on the farm what's going on in the processing facility what occurs in the retail the previous example the several slides were in uh detailed example of what goes on in the farm the next several slides and we'll go through these quickly because of the interest of time but now we're going to be looking at a quick comparison between government regulations and private sector standards when it comes to that food processing facility those good manufacturing practices the gmps here we look at again the broad topics that the FDA addresses in its regulations the plant is the facility the building itself the sanitation practices that we're using in the operation the again the equipment the utensils that are being used during the manufacturing process what is the actual manufacturing process and how are we controlling the process to minimiz the risk how's the food being uh warehouse and stored uh what do we do if there are some uh problems now we look at the private sector what does a private sector uh concern itself with and those standards again I would suggest they begin to look this similar what are the requirements for the site and are these is the site being approved according to these private sector standards the construction and the control of handling the product storing the product the Personnel hygiene and their welfare the Personnel processing practices the importance of training the Personnel the water the ice the air that comes in contact with the food while the food is being processed the storage Transportation separating the function of where we're cleaning the raw materials from where we're packaging the final materials let's not have those occurring in the same space so that we minimize the risk of cross-contamination waste disposal and then how are you maintaining the exterior of your facility so we look at the government regulations we look at the private sector standards and again we see similarities just some very brief examples uh the sanitary operations these are details of what the FDA requires when it comes to processing the food how do we assure that we have a sanitary operation the general maintenance of the building are the substances being clean and sanitized where are we store ing the toxic materials uh what's necessary for actual testing of the product to make sure that our product is safe continuing with this example the control of the pests that we know that the rodents the insects and so forth are not uh gaining access to the food why it's being processed the food contact surfaces are sanitized and that they're meeting the sanitation standards while the food is being processed in whatever the manufacturing practices that we're using in our business and con then the sanitation of even nonf food contact Services surfaces we want to make sure that we are not contaminating the product so after we look at the Federal Regulations very quickly now let's take a quick look at the uh private sector standards are they similar or are there some differences right and the answer to that really is they're very similar in in um the US here and so what they do here with the sqs standard is they get a little bit more particular and they start naming like in the 11 to 12.2 you'll see benches tables conveyors mixers mincers they they actually include a few examples for you which helps when you're creating your plan um but the the big message here is that they are pressing how often how often you're or really not how often it's that you need to clean the equipment that you're producing what I'm trying to say is that it's still your business you get to decide how you're doing it so like I said how often you get to decide but the thing is is that you've got to stick to it because this is what you have to do okay so you you get a little leway there we're saying well um you as you go through the me methods of cleaning and handling food processing equipment you need to consider what is to be cleaned how it's to be cleaned when it's to be cleaned they're not telling you exactly the details of how it needs to be in your business because you might have extenuating circumstances but this is what needs to be done okay very very similar to regulation and again this is for anything being processed in this example okay um one example I can give you is in the 13.6 detergents and sanitizers well they're saying you've got to use some type of detergent remember gets rid of the oilbased food food uh bofilm so any food products that are on there but the sanitizer is what's going to kill the microorganisms the detergent doesn't necessarily eradicate the the microorganisms and so if you're thinking about your own food processing bench in your kitchen when you're producing maybe your souro bread or something um are you using a sanitizer and a detergent and and and really it should go s detergent rinse sanitizer and don't rinse and an example that I can give you you know as you can see here the module nor did the regulation say you've got to be using bleach or you've got to be using quinary and pneumonia or ammonia it won't say what you have to do exactly how you have to do it but it'll say you've got to be clean an example of a sanitizer that you can mix up and you should do it fresh each time you're going to use it is a gallon of Bach to a table I'm sorry a gallon of water that's important other way around a gallon of water to a tablespoon of bleach and that's considered a food contact surface safe parts per million for a sanitizer it will kill the bugs you don't have to rinse it off okay so let's uh let's go just a couple more slides here we're right on time hopefully we get a couple we often have heard farmers in the past 20 years say I spend more time at my desk than I do on my tractor or working with my livestock that might be true for our small food firms as well we're going to feel like there's a point that I'm spending more time at the uh computer than I'm doing uh that I'm spending in the orchard or that I'm spending with the product but it is so important as already been described this afternoon we need to document how this business is being operated but also as stated earlier this afternoon before we even start the operation we need a document in which we describe how we intend to operate the business we need that plan as to how we're going to operate to minimize these risks then we need to keep records uh as the business is actually being conducted this is how we harvested this is how we handled the food so that we minimize the risk this is how we processed it this is how we kept it warm to the necessary temperatures or this how we kept it cool to the required uh temperature again so we end up having the documents as to our planning and then the documents as to how we keep records this is important and hopefully we've emphasize this throughout the afternoon that the government inspectors are going to be looking for these records as well as looking at your facilities the private sector Auditors are going to be looking for these records as well as taking a look at these at your facilities and I would add if you end up ever end up with that ill consumer hopefully you never do but if you end up with that ill consumer and that consumer gets a lawyer and comes to you and says your product was unsafe that lawyer is going to be looking at your documents as well and you're going to want to have those documents in place for the inspector you're going to want to have those documents in place for the Auditors you're going to want to have those in documents in place to prove to the lawyers prove to the court that you uh handled the food safety and you were not the cause of this person's illness that's right I we can't elaborate enough on this slide to keep your records and you might say well what kind of Records do I need I mean go back up and look at the different examples that we gave you and you can start establishing little programs little prerequisite programs we call them you know pest control program you might Set uh traps or even have fly bait traps and you check them once a month that would be a record that you would keep you may keep that you started your production at 88 a.m. and you sanitized all of the Sur food contact surfaces with uh your 200 parts per million bleach solution I gave you that would be an example of a record you would start so we can't we can't stress the last slide this afternoon then is to say okay does my firm need to comply with all of these standards and the answer some of our small firms no you don't but on the other hand the consumers are beginning to expect the food industry to meet these standards even if you are not legally required by regulation to meet all these standards at this time I would suggest if you look to the Future begin to uh take the time become familiar with these standards begin to adopt these standards in your practice in your business because at some point they will be upon all of us that's exactly right um you know anybody who is producing food for other people especially for profit at some point you are going to have some type of audit or requirements uh from a food safety inspection standard that that you'll have to undergo your business so maybe not every one of these regulations applies but but the the standards are there that you should us up we can uh stay online for another minute or two to see if there are any questions I don't see any questions at this point uh thank you was great to be part of this two-person team and to have the opportunity to be part of this program any questions thank you everybody okay thank you everyone look",
