1
00:00:02,720 --> 00:00:06,720
when a hurricane is approaching

2
00:00:04,799 --> 00:00:08,080
safety of life and the preservation of

3
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,360
livelihoods is most

4
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,360
important we should take heed

5
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:15,759
fill five gallon buckets and other

6
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:17,760
containers with water prior to the storm

7
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:19,520
you'll need it to water transplants in

8
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,000
the greenhouse if you have lost

9
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:23,760
power mulch as many bare roots as

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,920
possible before the storm

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
mulching will help prevent erosion and

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,359
wind damage

13
00:00:26,960 --> 00:00:30,000
and will also minimize soil splashing

14
00:00:29,359 --> 00:00:32,880
into the crop

15
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:35,520
canopy which can cause disease rib

16
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,280
mature crops such as tomatoes and melons

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,840
because they will split after heavy

18
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:41,520
rains pick coconuts and consider

19
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:43,360
harvesting cut flowers

20
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,120
right before the storm as they will be

21
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:48,160
easily damaged by rain

22
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:49,760
and wind fortify any field trellises so

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,960
you don't lose the crops they are

24
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,920
supporting

25
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:56,960
wherever possible unhang trellis plants

26
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:58,960
and place them to lay flat on the ground

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,399
make sure tractors and other equipment

28
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
and supplies are secured

29
00:01:00,399 --> 00:01:04,159
don't leave market baskets picking

30
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,720
crates dip tape

31
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:08,799
or irrigation pipes in the field or lane

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:09,680
around where they can become missiles in

33
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:12,560
high winds

34
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:14,720
or get washed away by flood waters and

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:16,799
stock upon gas for generators and other

36
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:20,320
needed farm equipment

37
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,720
remember this is the hurricane season

38
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:23,920
and we should be prepared a message

39
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:25,520
brought to you by the ministry of

40
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:30,479
agriculture fisheries

41
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,479
physical planning natural resources and

42
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:34,159
cooperatives
