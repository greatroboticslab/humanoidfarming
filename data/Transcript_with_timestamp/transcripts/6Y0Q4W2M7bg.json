  "text": "and he could mourn it you guys ever wake up in the middle of the country and guys are staying with like hey can you go out there and try to shoot some of those coyotes my wife's killed about seven of them months back porks lately and we're having a bad problem them taking her cattle out this year do me a favor just locking load and send some lead downrange if you see a furry critter out there it's kind of what I woke up to this morning me and flare out here at favorite favorite ranch we're doing a little rod design this week and just kind of hanging out in the country so anyway that's what you do you just grab you cup of coffee you look for Jody's I believe that's a white van coming in right now well I think Winston's working on something out here at the crib meanwhile I'm loading a high-powered rifle flare doing some Glasson right now this is this is high stakes hunting right here next to the septic tank and we got we got guys working on the pole over here waiting on something to come out there's actually a real beautiful field out here I don't really know what we're doing I guess we're just kind of waiting on breakfast discount what you do out here you just wait for varmints to come out and shoot wonderful one comes out then you go grab you some eggs and some coffee and start your day let's flare improvising in a pinch brilliant I can almost hear it over the semis down the highway hey Poochie you look like you have problems oh what a cutie I don't think the coyote huntin is really gonna happen but I did manage to scrounge myself up stout a cup of coffee free-range I might add a lot of stuff happening right here there's a lot of big equipment besides the the pool building this is going to be like a favorite fishing hangout area and just also for just general pool use at the at the favorite ranch all this back here is going to be a massive I think it's gonna be a 38-acre Lake with 60-foot deep a damn crappie it's gonna have bass it's gonna have big bluegill all laid out very nicely and I think Jimmy Houston is actually gonna help with the design of this maybe a few other anglers I don't know if you guys know about Jimmy Houston but he's got some phenomenal ponds I've actually been there and I've seen him I fish them they're incredible he has an incredible place nose thing to you about building ponds this all back here where we were looking for coyotes morning this is going to be a giant lake so it'll be something really neat where we can just come up take boats out and test lures test rods test all kinds of stuff go hang out at the pool it'll be a phenomenal place to be in the outdoors so looking forward to that pretty excited you know what I see some rods over here right now see flare and see one soon with some rods so I think it's time to go your pooch this is Pete's baby okay she likes to talk Daisy Poots Daisy Poots well I guess that's the only coat or LC today huh oh don't worry it's that Tucker life right here you're having a cup of coffee hop in the mule grab your dog daisy dukes but the t-bones with the tape and he just kind of cruise the farm maybe look for some snakes McHale make sure things are checked fall apart out here if you're lucky and to cast a line there's thank is hamburger steaks ready hey what's happenin here what's happening here well I think that cows upset I can't go chasing the Sheep in cow vicious do you know cows have been known to be for nippers I think we need to know will you do that for bidi I'm not getting out of the vehicle a passive part they're coming right to the pond to where we're supposed to fish we'll take old Jimmy it's an alum of course we gotta have a llama there's a herd of cows and then there's just a llama randomly out in the middle is that what they do the llamas protect the cows we're supposed to do this there it is just right out of the middle like a giraffe just and trotting around it looks so funny man you gotta open the old cattle gate here I know I know eat more chicken and all that good stuff definitely wanna lock that back up I don't have anything today sorry I'm sorry I eat chick-fil-a all the time don't worry the valley beyond what's out there girl how to call a man not it's called you gotta go whoosah [Music] [Laughter] come on whoa how do you call this llama now look at that thing's cocked his head sideways lady hey Paul Paul look at him Jabberjaw on over there God look at Paul that is the funniest a creature I've ever seen hey Paul oh come on get in bed yeah you know that does work Winston it doesn't look this was problem oh yeah no you cannot [Music] this way please come on what's that big man that is all Baker Willis about say Oh Wilbur he's pretty daggum big look at that hair on him dick just got to get a couple more mamas to go through and then all these little ones are gonna follow suit get in there all right we got a pond we've got Flair therefore I mean there's probably gonna be fish guts you know let's see well you already got a top water tight on there's a couple of couple rods or nothing that are ready for something remember that on the end cap at Bass Pro the walking worm features a lifelike tail action go straight up in the air to mimic leeches wall I say absolutely slurp and group look at that tackle box frog season I mean scary frog or ChatterBait thank you I just think other than thats about all I got just uh just break a lot of like rules there's a barrel swivel clip on the hog I did that until I was 18 years old really it's all good I snapped it on I saw someone do this out cringe so I look at the guy yet you have absolutely no idea what you do that was true right now so it was true he put it on the sink oh it's extra dive action my dad had a box of these randomly these little tiny ones I want to take him up to Canada because you know the mayflies they'll probably slurp that thing like a little candy corn hula popper I just like being around fishing it kind of makes me happy yep dodge cow patty or to give the old popper toss now when your pond fishing you got to stay back Matt I can see you already I promise y'all I didn't just snag that fish you came up and tried to tag that top water by the bank these fish are just now starting to spawn it's crazy oh he came off well I think we had three bites captured one got a second little fishing hole over here and the goats need to be fed Tucker's gonna get in here and feed him ago got to give give him some roughage to keep the rooters going I think is what he said by the way most tick infested region in all time okay you got to call him in with a bush here they are they come right on in so they just cook you just bend that tree over and they just come right on in you look at them going to town so they have to have that to keep the rumen going oh I got you so they just go crazy when you give them a nice fresh tree oh that's a persimmon tree those are those fruits that aren't very good right amazing good they're amazing good yeah you don't eat them under green Kazu okay that's what I did when I was a kid somebody dared me to those leaves are almost gone now that whole branch so these goats are now gonna have a nice rheumatory system flush their units out I probably need to give a the old top water a sinned oh hey there hey easy you're trying to get old yeah get up in there reach them Wow that sucker seven feet tall when he wants to be okay let me get this pop are out of the way for we hook a goat so when you get when you get home from all these business trips you just come out here and you bend the tree over and herd the cow yeah okay these goats have kind of exhausted area they need some help meanwhile he's over there fighting Billy look they're just gonna ravage this tree gotta like his farm life so Winston was saying that they lost 30 goats year the codis y'all can't believe that so they got just these wild dogs running and they lost about a hundred chickens to raccoons and Cody's got a big problem we need to come up here and do some coyote maintenance I think nope don't eat the popper organic what kind of berries young about three weeks will be blackberry ice cream homemade ice cream the dough [Music] that might be a five pounder lay down one of these days look at that stuff Winston saying all this is gonna be underwater he's leaving it for building a big lake for the pond see the field turning oh yeah so this little Bank will be that'll be the water edge right there's will drive around I'll show you where the dam will be at the top it'll be 1,200 1,250 foot long be 54 deeds in the dam it'll be about 280 feet wide I mean and then you can just sit up there and wait for the deer to come [Music] right there huh how many Springs as you Sanders [Music] according to the [Music] laughing spring 11 spring speeding it that's awesome we're gonna drill them out put a big piece of steel then incorporate the holes away we have lily pads drink on it looks like this your middle cut this Bank this will be part of them best love that stuff in those pads have been here for there's to see frogs in there they're gonna escape get much my mondo slow ride you hear will be the top of the thing right here all this brush look will drop around where it's clear can see this this would be where the dam starts an indigo straight 1200 ultimate it's like an oval giant horsefly right there was a big son of a dick oh yeah auxins up here for real well that's great so we're gonna come down here and get a bunch of these little flat river rocks before we flood it for the things do through here yes you can get some cool stuff for the pool yeah I'm gonna lay them around that little ditch around the pool this is gonna be really worth of crappies in the mondo bass we're probably catching about halfway up that tree baby yeah we'll be in about well the water line so that corner will be the dam but I got I bought this the neighbor's property we're going to those all that out 54 foot there so we should be about 3035 feet right here that's insane so I think this is going to be that the lfg mondo tree right here and then we got flares crappie Kingdom over there something like that Woodson was just talking about making little landmarks all over the lake kind of since we're gonna you know do videos on the build and help out with some stuff I think that would be pretty sweet tadpoles and frogs and crawdads is already already got him in here natives I mean it's made this was supposed to be a lake it's a lot but just been waiting I love that look at that frog jumping in there comes out right under this tree there's another one oh I see I see what you're saying so it probably runs it's connected to that little spring pond up there this whole like we call it runs underground hey hauler but it's it's actually a swamp like there's probably 10 or 15 artesian zits everywhere like if we walked across it right now we'd sink up this deep and we could just take a sip mmm that's where that natural water is gonna come out and feed this glorious nutritious feels like boys now he's pretty strong down here leaves of three stay away how old is that true Stan there there you gotta be fifty-five years old built in the early fifties saw the quality back there we're going to try to leave that so we can scuba dive down here if the water gets it's clear because there's some other big spring out of here so we're hoping they'll be clear enough we can sit in that tree standing sheet of catfish this will all be gone for letting them get back through the dam will be up there [Music] and that trees going to be left in here no coils just chillin always getting ready duck out yeah he sees Ruger there it goes bobwhite point there it is just named it well after a long morning of hanging out on the farm we're actually here at the favorite headquarters we're gonna be going aside doing a little designing just talking about some stuff for for next year but just after seeing that whole entire layout of what that Lake is gonna be like I cannot wait to get up here it's gonna be the perfect place to come up here test out new rods go fishing film videos and just hang out and just have a good time out in the country definitely gonna bring Stephanie up here Winston's family's pretty awesome too listens why she she makes her own like jam she pickles her own stuff you know it's it's like dream stuff for Stephanie so I got to bring her up her sometimes she's met it okay you guys wanna see the this is the room this is where it all goes down I don't know if I I can actually show everything in here but this is the full-blown selection Mexico memorabilia right here this is that tournament that me and Winston fished in right here Team USA representing they actually won that tournament and we got some major league baseball action happening right here for all you Rangers fans we got Rangers rods the mondo warehouse this is a new memorabilia wall how long ago was that yeah that's oh wow man sure bear all that right there ladies and gentlemen favorite fishing rods heading out the door maybe it's going to your house there's so much fishing stuff in here it'll blow your mind oh my head can't hurt to be honest with you coming out one headache right now everywhere you look there's something you never know when you need rope okay I'll take some rope but oh hey guys you need some flashlights in your life maybe some calls about a little call action in the world most calls or let's load up on some stuff here literally I had a fox in my backyard two days ago I want to try to get some of the stuff on camera see what's roving around back there it's a new morning I just woke up wanted to come out here I'm just kind of soaking the sunrise that's incredible I don't know if y'all could see the the deer better don't pass the tractor down there by the creek they're actually sitting in where the deepest part of the lake is gonna be besides the dam lie down in the creek area so that's just gonna be phenomenal you know I can't wait the the date on that around September when we get this thing up and rolling there's a lot of things involved in building a lake of this size because it's gonna be the biggest 30 or 40 mile radius this is gonna be the biggest Lake around here so it's not just a little pond in the backyard it's a natural lake that will sustain wildlife in this county and probably a lot of other counties surrounding here so I just can't wait to see this project get started and we're gonna be coming up here and doing videos on it guys I love it up here I love it up here I really want to take Stephanie up here show her the farm this is exactly why I told you guys in the beginning I wanted to work with favorite is because it's more than just fishing and a corporation it's a family they're my friends so I'm gonna sign you off on that good note it is time to go back and get with ocean spoon girl I have heard she is made my favorite cookies they're done they're available so I got to get back there and get me some of that but I'm wishing you guys the best wherever you are I hope you're catching mando's I hope you're having a blessed blessed day and I wish you the best and if you want to subscribe right here to the channel guys going to do hit that subscription button hit the ding dongs for all the notifications especially if you want to follow along with the pond stuff this summer and leading in the fall it's gonna be huge project it's gonna be a lot of fun I wish you guys the best [Music]",
