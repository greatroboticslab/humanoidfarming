1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,350
this year is the International Year of

2
00:00:02,129 --> 00:00:06,299
pulses events are happening around the

3
00:00:04,350 --> 00:00:08,670
world to raise awareness of the

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:11,370
important role that pulses play in food

5
00:00:08,670 --> 00:00:14,160
security and nutrition being rich in

6
00:00:11,370 --> 00:00:16,260
protein minerals environments pulses can

7
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:21,300
form an important part of a healthy diet

8
00:00:16,260 --> 00:00:24,449
we want people to come and see what they

9
00:00:21,300 --> 00:00:26,820
are eating on the daily basis at this

10
00:00:24,449 --> 00:00:28,710
event organised by the IAEA in

11
00:00:26,820 --> 00:00:31,080
partnership with the UN's Food and

12
00:00:28,710 --> 00:00:33,480
Agriculture Organization people learned

13
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,510
about the benefits of pulses and got to

14
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,270
taste them too before I never used too

15
00:00:36,510 --> 00:00:41,940
much you know beans in my regular food

16
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:43,770
but now I think I should because it's

17
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,800
not only cheap but also very very

18
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:49,140
healthy a nuclear technique can be used

19
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:52,079
to develop improved varieties of plant

20
00:00:49,140 --> 00:00:54,180
crops including pulses it's known as

21
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,260
mutation breeding and has been used

22
00:00:54,180 --> 00:01:01,590
since the 1930s the mutant varieties of

23
00:00:58,260 --> 00:01:05,250
pulses they are more adaptable to

24
00:01:01,590 --> 00:01:08,580
climate change resistant to diseases and

25
00:01:05,250 --> 00:01:11,610
also they have high yield and rich in

26
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:13,740
minerals and proteins pulses also

27
00:01:11,610 --> 00:01:16,830
contribute to improving soil fertility

28
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:19,409
they absorb atmospheric nitrogen into

29
00:01:16,830 --> 00:01:21,630
their roots and release it into the soil

30
00:01:19,409 --> 00:01:24,780
where it's available for the next

31
00:01:21,630 --> 00:01:27,420
generation of crops this is a form of

32
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:30,119
natural fertilization and reduces costs

33
00:01:27,420 --> 00:01:32,250
for farmers a new clear technique and

34
00:01:30,119 --> 00:01:35,270
find out which pulses are the most

35
00:01:32,250 --> 00:01:39,540
effective by using

36
00:01:35,270 --> 00:01:43,049
isotope of nitrogen nitrogen 15 we can

37
00:01:39,540 --> 00:01:45,450
determine how much each time is fixing

38
00:01:43,049 --> 00:01:47,509
and then we can then transfer this

39
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:50,280
knowledge to our member states

40
00:01:47,509 --> 00:01:54,540
eventually to the farmers that they grow

41
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:57,079
those high fixing variety pulses have

42
00:01:54,540 --> 00:02:00,090
been cultivated for over 10,000 years

43
00:01:57,079 --> 00:02:02,880
but it's only recently that their true

44
00:02:00,090 --> 00:02:06,899
value as a nutrient for both people and

45
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,239
soil has been recognized now pulses such

46
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,970
as these lentils are seen as a powerful

47
00:02:09,239 --> 00:02:14,600
superfood in a key crop to sustainable

48
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,370
development in a first century from

49
00:02:14,600 --> 00:02:20,290
Vienna Austria this is Alexandra no

50
00:02:16,370 --> 00:02:20,290
panic reporting for the IAEA
