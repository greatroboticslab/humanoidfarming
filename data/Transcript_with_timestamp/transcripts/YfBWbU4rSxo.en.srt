the most of it in our backyard

19
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:35,920
growing food and raised beds that i

20
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:36,719
built myself you can catch the video

21
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,719
here

22
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,719
and we make all of our own nutrients on

23
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,320
site using worms this is our worm farm

24
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:44,000
and we make we make all of our nutrients

25
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:46,399
on site for amending our beds

26
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:48,239
for the most part using this worm farm

27
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:49,680
setup and today i'm going to show you

28
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:52,399
how you can set up

00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:52,719
your own worm farm or worm bin so like i

30
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,480
said

31
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:56,079
this is our worm farm and i just

32
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:56,320
finished setting it up and today i want

33
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:58,559
to

34
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,640
invite you guys into the process and

35
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:02,559
show you guys how i set up our worm bins

36
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,400
from scratch now whether you've got a

37
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:05,920
smaller worm farm or a worm bin or

38
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,240
you've got a big old worm

39
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,280
farm like this one the same principles

40
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:11,360
will apply to you

41
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:12,200
you really just need a few things to get

00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:18,400
so let's talk supplies to set up your

45
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:21,680
worm bin you will need

46
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,680
cardboard browns bedding grit worms

47
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:26,159
greens and amendments if you feel so

48
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:27,680
inclined you'll also need a bin and some

49
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:29,040
water that is free of chemicals and

50
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:31,040
chlorine and i'll show you later on in

51
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,600
the video which amendments i prefer to

52
00:01:31,040 --> 00:01:33,520
use

53
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,280
for our worm farm that help boost

54
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:36,000
production and minerals and all of that

55
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:37,520

books i hope this is a resource that

79
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,280
proves really valuable to you

80
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:18,050
and it's what we'll be working out of

81
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,239
for today as we set up our bins

82
00:02:18,050 --> 00:02:22,640
[Music]

83
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:24,640
to set up the bins first we add a layer

84
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,720
of cardboard and the cardboard is really

85
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,959
there to prevent the worms from

86
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:31,599
sneaking through and sneaking out of the

87
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:34,000
bins when you add worms to bins

88
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:35,519
they have a tendency to want to escape

89
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,599
it's sometimes a little hard for them

90
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:38,720
to acclimate to their new home and so

91
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:41,200
you want to

92
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:42,959
fortify your bins as much as possible to

93
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,879
prevent them from escaping

94
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:46,400
and we found that cardboard works best

95
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:48,720
but you could also use several layers of

96
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,319
newspaper or packing paper as well

97
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:52,160
next up we need to add some browns to

98
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:53,360
the worm bin and to do that you can add

99
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,040
anything from

100
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,519
shredded up cardboard shredded up

101
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:58,959
newspaper shut it up packing paper

102
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
shut it up envelopes although you'll

103
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,879
want to remove any glue

104
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,040
or plastic particles or anything like

105
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:07,599
that i prefer to use

106
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:08,480
leaves that i found in my backyard

107
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,159
they're free

108
00:03:08,480 --> 00:03:11,840
they're readily available this time of

109
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:13,680
year in fall and

110
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:16,080
i find that anything that is more

111
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,040
natural tends to do a little bit better

112
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,959
so i lean towards using leaves as a

113
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:23,200
brown material whenever possible

114
00:03:20,959 --> 00:03:25,040
next up to our worm bin we are going to

115
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:27,360
add some compost

116
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:28,239
now the compost has organic material

117
00:03:27,360 --> 00:03:30,080
which is really

118
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:32,959
important for any kind of composting

119
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:34,959
setup a lot of people think oh well

120
00:03:32,959 --> 00:03:36,239
you know worms will make anything better

121
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,360
but in reality

122
00:03:36,239 --> 00:03:41,760
worms exist in nature where the soil

123
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:43,120
is already good because they have this

124
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:44,640
symbiotic relationship with the

125
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:45,200
nematodes and everything else that's

126
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
going on

127
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:50,159
inside the soil structure itself so

128
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:51,760
we can't just say i'm just going to add

129
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:52,480
worms to the situation and it's going to

130
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:54,159
be better

131
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,400
that's not really how it works and so

132
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:57,599
that's why it's important to add compost

133
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:59,360
because you're going to be adding a lot

134
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:00,640
of organic material that way and it's

135
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,879
going to help boost

136
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:05,120
the microbiome of these worm bins so

137
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:06,799
we're going to add our layer of compost

138
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:08,400
i like to think of it as making a little

139
00:04:06,799 --> 00:04:09,760
bed for the worms right so this is their

140
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,560
bedding this is where they're starting

141
00:04:09,760 --> 00:04:12,640
off their life

142
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,000
in the worm bin eventually everything

143
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,320
will basically turn into

144
00:04:14,000 --> 00:04:18,160
castings but this is this is their start

145
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:19,519
and we want to be as hospitable

146
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,040
and loving and kind to these little

147
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:22,720
worms as we can so we're going to make

148
00:04:21,040 --> 00:04:25,520
them a nice comfy bed

149
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,320
made of some soft organic material

150
00:04:25,520 --> 00:04:29,280
compost

151
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:31,120
and soil so now all that's left to do is

152
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,800
add the worms to their bed

153
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,880
and then i like to include their grit

154
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,440
here with them and i'm adding grit in

155
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,160
the form

156
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:39,360
of coffee grinds eggshells and

157
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,280
vermiculite

158
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,800
grit is great for their digestion which

159
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:44,000
they need when they're first starting

160
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:45,759
off in the bin

161
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:48,000
they actually have gizzards and several

162
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:50,240
stomachs so they need a lot of grit to

163
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,400
help them process that is part of

164
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:54,240
the necessary components for digestion

165
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,080
in worms so it's important to include

166
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:57,199
grit which is why i include it here in

167
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:00,000
bed with them

168
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:00,400
as a nice little gritty snack while

169
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:01,919
they're

170
00:05:00,400 --> 00:05:03,520
sleeping in their beds getting

171
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,919
acclimated in their new home

172
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:07,840
and i'm adding just a handful to each

173
00:05:05,919 --> 00:05:09,680
bin these are new worms

174
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:11,759
all of our old worms have already been

175
00:05:09,680 --> 00:05:13,039
added to our garden beds so i went ahead

176
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:14,320
and purchased some new ones from our

177
00:05:13,039 --> 00:05:16,320
local feed store

178
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:17,600
i'm just adding a handful because under

179
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:20,080
the right conditions

180
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:21,759
these worms will multiply pretty quickly

181
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,960
and that's what we're hoping for a nice

182
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,440
healthy worm bin with

183
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,039
lots of new worm babies very soon pro

184
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,080
tip you can get coffee grounds from your

185
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:29,919
local coffee shop

186
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,360
i got mine from our local starbucks

187
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,280
starbucks has a program that they've had

188
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:35,600
around now for years where they give out

189
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:37,440
grounds to local gardeners but if you

190
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:38,639
establish a relationship with another

191
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:40,080
local business who

192
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:41,759
needs to get rid of their coffee grounds

193
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:42,560
it's a win-win for the coffee shop and

194
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:43,919
for you

195
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:45,840
good for them reducing their carbon

196
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:46,479
footprint good for you benefiting your

197
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:47,919
garden

198
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,759
then like i said i want you to think of

199
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:51,600
it as a bed we're gonna cover those

200
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:52,000
worms up with some soil make sure

201
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,360
they're nice

202
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:56,720
and comfortable not too hot not too cold

203
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:58,960
nice and comfortable in their new

204
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:00,720
environment and i'm just adding a little

205
00:05:58,960 --> 00:06:02,560
bit of compost and soil

206
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:03,759
to cover them up and protect them from

207
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,680
the sunlight because

208
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:07,280
worms don't like sun they're

209
00:06:05,680 --> 00:06:08,960
photosensitive so when you

210
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,039
pull out some a handful of worms and you

211
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:12,800
see them wriggling in your hands

212
00:06:11,039 --> 00:06:14,160
they prefer not to be exposed to direct

213
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,440
sunlight so we want to make sure that

214
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,880
they are nice and covered up and

215
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:18,479
comfortable in their new home

216
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:20,080
and i like to do so by adding a little

217
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:21,919
bit more compost and soil

218
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,050
so next up it's time to add some food

219
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,680
scraps

220
00:06:23,050 --> 00:06:27,600
[Music]

221
00:06:25,680 --> 00:06:29,039
on behalf of worms and worm farmers

222
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,039
everywhere i'd like to welcome you to

223
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:31,919
the first ever episode of cooking for

224
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:33,600
your worms

225
00:06:31,919 --> 00:06:35,680
in today's episode we'll show you how to

226
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,240
make a worm charcuterie board

227
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:40,160
today's stars of the show include what

228
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:44,479
wet bad in my fridge

229
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:47,440
we've got pears apple avocado a worm's

230
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,720
favorite food bananas a worm's second

231
00:06:47,440 --> 00:07:03,840
favorite food

232
00:06:48,720 --> 00:07:03,840
apple cores broccoli and eggshell

233
00:07:03,880 --> 00:07:15,000
[Music]

234
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:19,440
because nothing says i love you worms

235
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:22,560
like slightly rotten fruits and veggies

236
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,919
and the smell of broccoli fart

237
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:26,240
now here are some things that you should

238
00:07:23,919 --> 00:07:27,199
know about red wigglers and food scraps

239
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
in a worm bin

240
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:30,479
first off red wigglers are surface

241
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,160
dwellers that means that they're going

242
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:33,360
to want to hang out towards the top of

243
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:35,599
the worm bin

244
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:37,599
unlike things like earthworms or

245
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:39,520
european night crawlers which are all

246
00:07:37,599 --> 00:07:41,599
other kinds of worms that you can find

247
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:43,840
in the garden or use for composting

248
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,199
but for my purposes i prefer to use red

249
00:07:43,840 --> 00:07:46,639
wigglers and it's what i have linked

250
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,759
down below it's what i recommend for

251
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,919
getting started

252
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:51,360
what i love to experiment with european

253
00:07:49,919 --> 00:07:53,120
night crawlers one day yeah

254
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:54,800
maybe but for now red wigglers have

255
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:55,440
worked really well for me keeping that

256
00:07:54,800 --> 00:07:57,440
in mind

257
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:59,199
that their nature is to stay towards the

258
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:00,879
surface of the

259
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:02,479
worm bins it's important that we leave

260
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:03,680
their food there for them so

261
00:08:02,479 --> 00:08:06,400
that's where they want to hang out and

262
00:08:03,680 --> 00:08:07,840
eat contrary to popular belief

263
00:08:06,400 --> 00:08:09,759
another thing you should know is that

264
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,400
worms don't eat just

265
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,840
food scraps i definitely was under the

266
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:15,280
impression that i could just give the

267
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,120
worms all my food scraps in the

268
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:19,280
beginning and i was very wrong

269
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,720
worms eat a lot more than just food

270
00:08:19,280 --> 00:08:22,000
scraps they are actually going to

271
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:23,840
consume

272
00:08:22,000 --> 00:08:25,360
pretty much everything that's in the bin

273
00:08:23,840 --> 00:08:27,759
that we're adding today

274
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:28,720
and eventually all of what you see will

275
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:31,199
be broken down

276
00:08:28,720 --> 00:08:31,759
into worm castings so it's important to

277
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:34,159
know that

278
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:35,519
don't over feed your worms we talk about

279
00:08:34,159 --> 00:08:37,839
it in the maintenance section

280
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:38,560
of my worm book but just a heads up to

281
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:40,719
you

282
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:42,560
don't over feed your worms you actually

283
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:43,680
don't want to add too many food scraps

284
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,600
in the beginning because you can

285
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,200
overwhelm the bin you can invite fight

286
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:48,720
fruit flies you can invite rodents so

287
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:50,080
we're going to start very minimally here

288
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:51,760
in the beginning with just

289
00:08:50,080 --> 00:08:53,600
a few food scraps some of their

290
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,080
favorites mentioned already in the

291
00:08:53,600 --> 00:08:59,279
cooking for your worm section

292
00:08:56,080 --> 00:09:01,760
they really love bananas avocados apple

293
00:08:59,279 --> 00:09:04,720
corers things like that for the better

294
00:09:01,760 --> 00:09:06,399
pears do really well as well i happen to

295
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:08,320
have some broccoli so i'm adding that

296
00:09:06,399 --> 00:09:09,839
too but again you want to add these

297
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:11,519
sparingly especially if you're not

298
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:13,279
starting off with a lot of worms

299
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:14,959
another thing to keep in mind is that

300
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:16,399
once your bin is established you should

301
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:19,200
be able to add more

302
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,720
more food because you'll have more worms

303
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:22,000
another thing to keep in mind is you

304
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:23,920
don't want to add too much food and

305
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,320
invite your local pests and rodents

306
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,519
so it's important to not over feed your

307
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:30,000
bin in the beginning

308
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:31,040
and cover it up which is the next step i

309
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:33,760
always like to cover

310
00:09:31,040 --> 00:09:34,560
up the food with compost or soil or

311
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:38,080
browns

312
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:40,720
just anything to kind of basically deter

313
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:42,399
pests and fruit flies and protip if you

314
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,959
are having fruit fly problems with your

315
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:45,440
bin

316
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,040
it's probably too wet and you probably

317
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:47,920
need more browns and so i always

318
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:50,000
recommend

319
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:51,760
throw some browns on there stop feeding

320
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:54,160
stop watering your bins

321
00:09:51,760 --> 00:09:55,040
add some little fruit fly traps around

322
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:57,040
your bin

323
00:09:55,040 --> 00:09:58,720
and you should see a dramatic decrease

324
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:00,560
in the issue with fruit flies

325
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:02,000
speaking of moisture as you've seen me

326
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:03,600
do throughout this process it's

327
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,320
important to keep the bin

328
00:10:03,600 --> 00:10:07,600
moist not too moist but in the beginning

329
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:08,720
when you're getting it established it's

330
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:10,320
okay to have it

331
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:12,399
on the wetter side of things and allow

332
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:14,320
it to kind of air out as the week goes

333
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,120
on i can kind of eyeball it as time goes

334
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:17,519
on the goal

335
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:19,360
is to have it about the consistency of a

336
00:10:17,519 --> 00:10:20,320
rung out sponge that is the eventual

337
00:10:19,360 --> 00:10:23,120
goal so

338
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:23,680
goldilocks right not too wet not too dry

339
00:10:23,120 --> 00:10:25,440
somewhere

340
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:27,440
right in between and on the note of

341
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:28,800
moisture and water like i was saying

342
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:31,120
you want to make sure that you're using

343
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:33,760
water that's been filtered we have an rv

344
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:34,240
filter on our drip lines and hoses now

345
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,160
to

346
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:38,640
basically eradicate the issue of

347
00:10:36,160 --> 00:10:40,240
chlorine and pesticides and chemicals

348
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,160
that are in city water

349
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:43,920
and that is it i hope you guys enjoyed
