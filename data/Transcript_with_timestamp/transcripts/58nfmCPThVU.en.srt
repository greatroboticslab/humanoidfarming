Life. Have you ever wondered how onions,

3
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,519
a staple ingredient in global cuisine,

4
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:18,759
make their journey from the field to

00:00:15,519 --> 00:00:18,759
your table?

6
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:32,000
Each year, the United States produces

7
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:34,480
approximately 8.9 billion pounds of

8
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,360
onions, ranking as one of the world's

11
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:49,719
grow, harvest, and process these

12
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,719
essential bulbs?

14
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:13,520
Let's embark on this fascinating journey

15
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:15,439
together. Major onion growing region.

16
00:01:13,520 --> 00:01:17,680
The states of California, Washington,

17
00:01:15,439 --> 00:01:20,080
and Idaho are the largest onion

18
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:23,119
producers in the United States,

19
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:25,720
benefiting from fertile soil and ideal

20
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:29,680
climate conditions. During the growing

21
00:01:25,720 --> 00:01:32,079
stage, onion plants sway in the wind, a

22
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,479
sign of their healthy development. When

23
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:37,840
fully matured, the outer skin of the

24
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:41,040
bulb dries into a papery layer,

25
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:44,720
indicating that it is ready for harvest.

26
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,720

28
00:01:50,119 --> 00:01:56,159
process. By the end of summer, when the

29
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,119
onions have reached their largest size,

30
00:01:56,159 --> 00:02:02,310
farmers deploy advanced machinery to

31
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:05,409
speed up the harvesting process.

32
00:02:02,310 --> 00:02:05,409
[Music]

33
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,640
Modern onion farms use advanced

34
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:20,640
harvesting machinery to maximize

35
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:23,640
efficiency and minimize manual labor.

36
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:27,120
These high-tech harvesters can quickly

37
00:02:23,640 --> 00:02:29,920
uproot, clean, and sort the onions,

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:33,800
significantly improving the speed and

39
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:33,800
scale of the harvest.

40
00:02:36,720 --> 00:02:42,519
These machines gently pull the onions

41
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,360
from the soil while preserving their

42
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,480
quality, ensuring that the bulbs remain

43
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:51,040
intact and undamaged during the

44
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,040
harvesting

45
00:02:54,040 --> 00:03:00,480
process. A sharp cutting blade slices

46
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:02,959
through the top soil, severing the roots

47
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,720
of the onion plant. This allows the

48
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,080
onion to be lifted from the ground

49
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:11,120
without damaging its bowl. Then a system

50
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:13,760
of belts and rotating bars carefully

51
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:17,040
lifts the onions, ensuring minimal

52
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:20,720
damage and gently guiding them onto the

53
00:03:17,040 --> 00:03:23,040
next stage of the process. The onions

54
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,800
are immediately placed on a conveyor

55
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:30,080
belt for preliminary cleaning where dirt

56
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:33,200
and impurities are removed from the

57
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,200
outer skin.

58
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:41,599
Clean and sort ready to take to

59
00:03:44,280 --> 00:03:50,560
school. After the initial cleaning, a

60
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:54,080
soft brush gently sweeps away any

61
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,120
remaining soil while a strong air stream

62
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:59,280
blows off any leftover dust particles.

63
00:03:57,120 --> 00:04:02,400
Next, the onions are automatically

64
00:03:59,280 --> 00:04:04,799
sorted by size and quality. Those that

65
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:05,879
meet high standards are sent to

66
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:09,519
processing

67
00:04:05,879 --> 00:04:12,640
facilities, while lower quality ones are

68
00:04:09,519 --> 00:04:15,680
processed into onion powder, frozen

69
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:18,400
onions or other processed products.

70
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:21,359
Thousands of tons of onions go through

71
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:23,840
this process every day, ensuring a

72
00:04:21,359 --> 00:04:26,720
steady supply for markets worldwide.

73
00:04:23,840 --> 00:04:29,600
While machinery plays a dominant role,

74
00:04:26,720 --> 00:04:34,400
manual harvesting is still necessary to

75
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,400
prevent bruising and to extend

76
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:43,360
freshness. Farmers use small shovels,

77
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:46,240
digging forks, or specialized cutting

78
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,560
tools to carefully lift the onions

79
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:51,360
without damaging their delicate outer

80
00:04:48,560 --> 00:04:54,960
skin. The onions are then packed into

81
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,639
large burlap sacks right in the field

82
00:04:54,960 --> 00:04:59,680
before being transported to the

83
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:02,520
processing facility. Each truck has the

84
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:05,680
capacity to carry up to 25 tons of

85
00:05:02,520 --> 00:05:08,639
onions which are unloaded quickly and

86
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:11,680
transferred via conveyor belts to large

87
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,039
storage warehouses, ensuring quality at

88
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:17,199
every stage. Before storage, the onions

89
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:20,880
will be passed through a vibrating

90
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:24,560
screen and high power fans to remove any

91
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:24,560
remaining dirt and

92
00:05:27,639 --> 00:05:34,080
debris. Any onions that are cracked or

93
00:05:31,000 --> 00:05:36,960
damaged must be removed to maintain the

94
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:39,600
high standards of the product. The fresh

95
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:42,160
whole onions are passed through a

96
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,840
meticulous processing line where they

97
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,120
are sorted by size and weight to ensure

98
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:50,560
consistency during packaging and

99
00:05:48,120 --> 00:05:52,880
transportation. The advanced optical

103
00:05:58,520 --> 00:06:06,840
defects ensuring that only high quality

104
00:06:01,680 --> 00:06:06,840
onions are released to the market.

105
00:06:09,600 --> 00:06:16,039
The substandard onions will be used for

106
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:18,880
producing dried onions or onion powder.

107
00:06:16,039 --> 00:06:21,440
Packaging and distribution. After being

108
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:25,880
sorted, the onions are packaged into

109
00:06:21,440 --> 00:06:27,840
bags and boxes, labeled and prepared for

110
00:06:25,880 --> 00:06:31,039
distribution. Every step in the

111
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:32,800
packaging processes is closely monitored

112
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,080
to maintain the highest quality

a thriving apple

161
00:09:21,560 --> 00:09:27,760
ecosystem. After planting, the young

162
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:30,560
trees grow vigorously, becoming stronger

163
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,360
and healthier over the months. Once they

164
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:37,200
reach the desired maturity, the next

165
00:09:33,360 --> 00:09:40,080
crucial stage begins, grafting. At the

166
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:42,640
right time, these mature saplings are

167
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,440
carefully collected and prepared for

168
00:09:42,640 --> 00:09:47,680
grafting at a specialized facility. The

169
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:50,720
journey begins with a thorough cleaning

170
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:51,480
of the roots, removing any soil residues

171
00:09:50,720 --> 00:09:54,320
and

00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:11,120
inspected to ensure it meets the highest

178
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:14,440
quality standards. These valuable

179
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:17,399
science are then grafted onto the young

180
00:10:14,440 --> 00:10:20,640
rootstocks, creating an ideal genetic

00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,560
safely shipped or stored until needed.

187
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:39,760
The grafted jazz saplings are then

188
00:10:36,560 --> 00:10:42,399
stored for a short period, waiting for

189
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,120
the optimal time to be planted. At the
