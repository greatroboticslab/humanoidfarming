00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,620
hey all Mike here from allamerican.org

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:06,359
now you may remember a long time ago I

3
00:00:04,620 --> 00:00:08,700
did a video on how to find tools made in

4
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:10,800
the USA and today we are revisiting that

5
00:00:08,700 --> 00:00:13,330
category but more specifically talking

6
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:16,460
about gardening tools

7
00:00:13,330 --> 00:00:19,320
[Music]

8
00:00:16,460 --> 00:00:20,880
now you may be wondering Mike why the

9
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:22,619
heck are we talking about gardening

10
00:00:20,880 --> 00:00:25,320
duels in the dead of winter and that's

11
00:00:22,619 --> 00:00:26,760
really for two reasons one is that you

12
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:29,099
should always be paying attention to

13
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,080
your garden but second of all it is the

14
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:33,300
slow season for a lot of these

15
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:35,219
businesses and what better way to

16
00:00:33,300 --> 00:00:38,100
support grade made in the USA companies

17
00:00:35,219 --> 00:00:40,440
than really supporting them during their

18
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:42,540
slow period of the year when they're

19
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:44,520
also likely running some sales so you

20
00:00:42,540 --> 00:00:47,219
may be able to create get a great deal

21
00:00:44,520 --> 00:00:49,320
as well so per usual also written about

22
00:00:47,219 --> 00:00:50,820
this exact same topic so check the

23
00:00:49,320 --> 00:00:52,860
description below for a link to that

24
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:55,020
article and head over to allamerican.org

25
00:00:52,860 --> 00:00:57,420
for all of our research on shopping

26
00:00:55,020 --> 00:00:59,160
American made first off when it comes to

27
00:00:57,420 --> 00:01:01,020
materials there's a few different things

28
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,059
you need to look out for over here one

29
00:01:01,020 --> 00:01:04,979
is that a lot of gardening tools are

30
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:07,260
going to be made of some sort of

31
00:01:04,979 --> 00:01:08,880
tempered steel or stainless steel now

32
00:01:07,260 --> 00:01:11,400
there's a lot of great material

33
00:01:08,880 --> 00:01:13,740
suppliers for this raw material in the

34
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,080
US so you should have no problem finding

35
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,540
great gardening tool brands that are

36
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:20,400
sourcing their steel from U.S suppliers

37
00:01:18,540 --> 00:01:22,380
now you also want to look at the other

38
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,360
materials within the tools as well if

39
00:01:22,380 --> 00:01:25,920
it's a hand tool the handle is likely

40
00:01:24,360 --> 00:01:28,619
going to be made out of something like

41
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:30,540
rubber or plastic good news is there are

42
00:01:28,619 --> 00:01:33,000
plenty of great suppliers of those raw

43
00:01:30,540 --> 00:01:35,040
materials as well so generally the

44
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,380
gardening tools category is one where

45
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:39,000
you can find a lot of brands that are

46
00:01:37,380 --> 00:01:40,920
not only doing a lot of their assembly

47
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:42,659
and Manufacturing here but are also

48
00:01:40,920 --> 00:01:45,119
sourcing a lot of their raw materials

49
00:01:42,659 --> 00:01:47,479
from U.S suppliers as well which is not

50
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:50,700
always the case for a lot of

51
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:52,079
subcategories of tools now in order to

52
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:53,579
find the country of origin you can

53
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,680
always give the brand a call if you're

54
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:57,299
shopping online if they don't list the

55
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:58,200
country of origin on their website or

56
00:01:57,299 --> 00:01:59,759

00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,020
out out or if you're shopping in store

59
00:02:01,860 --> 00:02:06,240
we have some U.S legislation on our side

60
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,220
that basically dictates that the country

61
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,380
of origin be labeled on the product or

62
00:02:08,220 --> 00:02:12,360
packaging so you should see it clearly

63
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:14,280
labeled when you're shopping around Home

64
00:02:12,360 --> 00:02:15,540
