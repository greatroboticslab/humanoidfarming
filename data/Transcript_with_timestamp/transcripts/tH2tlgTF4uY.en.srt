good morning guys welcome back to the

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,000
farm in today's video we're going to be

3
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,000
up potting some of these beautiful

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,840
cherry tomatoes well snacking Tomatoes I

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,160
call them snacking Tomatoes anyway we're

6
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:13,000
going to be up potting some of these

7
00:00:11,160 --> 00:00:14,839
cherry tomatoes and I'm going to give

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:16,680
you three tips that's going to make your

9
00:00:14,839 --> 00:00:19,520
Tomatoes double in size in less than a

10
00:00:16,680 --> 00:00:19,520
week just stick

11
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:31,960
around

12
00:00:36,430 --> 00:00:58,579
[Music]

13
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:03,160
you

14
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:04,720
welcome back guys the variety that we're

15
00:01:03,160 --> 00:01:07,040
working with today is called Mountain

16
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,840
magic and I call them snacking Tomatoes

17
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:11,360
simply because they are actually bigger

18
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:14,479
than your average uh cherry tomato now

19
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:18,240
we grow Sun Golds we grow uh super sweet

20
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:20,560
100s and we grow black cherry um cherry

21
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:22,560
tomatoes here on our farm and we grow a

22
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,040
mountain magic now this tomato here will

23
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:26,799
get almost the size of a golf ball it's

24
00:01:25,040 --> 00:01:28,360
smaller than your regular slicing tomato

25
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,680
but it's bigger than your average cherry

26
00:01:28,360 --> 00:01:32,320
tomato and this variety is very popular

27
00:01:30,680 --> 00:01:35,360
at the markets that we attend and we

28
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:37,320
tried to grow this several um secession

29
00:01:35,360 --> 00:01:39,560
plants throughout the year to make sure

30
00:01:37,320 --> 00:01:41,920
we got it on hand throughout all of our

31
00:01:39,560 --> 00:01:44,040
markets and these Tomatoes just like

32
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,360
every tomato that we grow we start them

33
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:50,040
in smaller trays so we can start more of

34
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:52,439
them number wise and then we up poot

35
00:01:50,040 --> 00:01:54,119
them to a bigger container um so they

36
00:01:52,439 --> 00:01:56,680
can actually get a better root base

37
00:01:54,119 --> 00:01:59,439
before we put them in the ground and

38
00:01:56,680 --> 00:02:01,399
they no really script on how we start

39
00:01:59,439 --> 00:02:03,000
our Tomatoes it just depends on what

40
00:02:01,399 --> 00:02:05,680
trades we've got on hand at the time

41
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:07,119
this is a 50 Cale flat and this is

42
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:09,800
basically a strawberry flat it's all it

43
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,920
is and we started these guys in this

44
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:14,440
because I had 100 seeds and that equal

45
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:18,000
two trays now we do start a lot of our

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:19,920
seeds in 512s and you can see this we

47
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,519
have to be real careful with this tray

48
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,720
here because it'll dry out really fast

49
00:02:21,519 --> 00:02:26,040
if you're not careful and the they will

50
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:27,840
get root bound also if you're not

51
00:02:26,040 --> 00:02:30,400
careful so you have to pay real close

52
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:33,519
attention to these guys and you know up

53
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:35,959
poot them when you think that they are

54
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,599
ready but yeah these guys here are about

55
00:02:35,959 --> 00:02:39,040
a week away from needing to be up potted

56
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:40,879
some of them have their true leaves on

57
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:43,040
them but a lot of them are still in the

58
00:02:40,879 --> 00:02:44,640
calan stage and you can see there a lot

59
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:46,280
of tomatoes in there I think I got five

60
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,720
or six of these trays that I've got to

61
00:02:46,280 --> 00:02:49,599
up poot here in the next week or two so

62
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,519
I'm going to go through and I'm going to

63
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:52,879
show you the process that I use to up

64
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:54,400
poot all of our Tomatoes not just

65
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:56,280
cherries determinates indeterminates

66
00:02:54,400 --> 00:02:58,879
heirlooms all of our tomatoes are up

67
00:02:56,280 --> 00:03:00,920
potted the same way and we generally up

68
00:02:58,879 --> 00:03:03,120
poot all of our tomatoes is now to get

69
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:05,599
away from having the up pot you need to

70
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,959
start it in a bigger container and we

71
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:09,799
don't simply for the reason that we

72
00:03:07,959 --> 00:03:13,480
don't have the room to do that we don't

73
00:03:09,799 --> 00:03:15,360
have the room to store a lot of these um

74
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,959
at one time like I said in any given

75
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:20,680
time there's 3 or 4,000 tomato plants

76
00:03:17,959 --> 00:03:22,760
sitting around here all the time there's

77
00:03:20,680 --> 00:03:24,480
3,000 in my germination chamber and

78
00:03:22,760 --> 00:03:25,840
there's another 2,000 down here at the

79
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,120
back of this High tunnel sitting on the

80
00:03:25,840 --> 00:03:30,239
ground so we don't have a lot of room to

81
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:31,239
do that so that's why we start them in

82
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:33,640
smaller

83
00:03:31,239 --> 00:03:37,200
trays so that brings me to tip number

84
00:03:33,640 --> 00:03:40,200
one give yourself plenty of room to grow

85
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,319
your transplants out if you can't get

86
00:03:40,200 --> 00:03:44,360
around to putting them in the ground at

87
00:03:42,319 --> 00:03:46,040
the time that you think you will then

88
00:03:44,360 --> 00:03:48,080
they need to be able to stay in whatever

89
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:49,519
you're up potting them in now I like to

90
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:52,360
use these glue cups because they're

91
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,079
cheap one and two that I can reuse them

92
00:03:52,360 --> 00:03:56,200
every year simply just wash them out

93
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:57,519
stack them up and put them on the shelf

94
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,239
and next year I can do the same thing

95
00:03:57,519 --> 00:04:00,920
now this works for Peppers this works

96
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:02,280
for a plant this works for just about

97
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:07,120
everything that you want to upot there's

98
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:08,760
no real I mean I get to use these or

99
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:11,239
I've got a lot of these trays here these

100
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,799
little 2-in cups sitting around and you

101
00:04:11,239 --> 00:04:15,519
know just something to hold soil more

102
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,440
than what is sitting in now that's

103
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:19,000
really all you're looking for so the

104
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:21,120
whole purpose of this video is to show

105
00:04:19,000 --> 00:04:23,320
you how we up poot these small tomato

106
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:24,759
plants and you can see I've got one that

107
00:04:23,320 --> 00:04:27,040
I pulled up

108
00:04:24,759 --> 00:04:30,600
these these small tomato plants that

109
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:34,120
look like this that were grown in these

110
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:38,400
trays and make them look like

111
00:04:34,120 --> 00:04:40,440
this that was grown in the same tray it

112
00:04:38,400 --> 00:04:42,680
just hadn't been up potted yet and you

113
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:44,199
know we could leave these guys in here

114
00:04:42,680 --> 00:04:45,160
and they would get to this size here and

115
00:04:44,199 --> 00:04:47,199
we could transplant them straight out

116
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:49,039
into the Gard but that's not you

117
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:51,280
generally how we do things these guys

118
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:53,400
here are going in this High tunnel and

119
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:54,600
we will be transplanting these out here

120
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:57,360
really soon probably here in the next

121
00:04:54,600 --> 00:04:59,759
two two or 3 days but these guys will

122
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:01,600
have to actually sit out for a while

123
00:04:59,759 --> 00:05:03,880
before we can put them in the other high

124
00:05:01,600 --> 00:05:06,280
tunnel that we're working on now so tip

125
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:08,680
number one give yourself enough room to

126
00:05:06,280 --> 00:05:10,240
have a cushion in order that you don't

127
00:05:08,680 --> 00:05:12,000
get in a bind and have to up poot them

128
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,639
again give them enough room that they

129
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:15,039
can grow in here and these plants

130
00:05:13,639 --> 00:05:17,440
they'll get that tall inside of this

131
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:18,680
container here a foot or more and you

132
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,680
know you'll still be in good shape

133
00:05:18,680 --> 00:05:22,080
because you got a lot more soil in here

134
00:05:20,680 --> 00:05:23,560
and you can actually fertilize these

135
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,560
guys while they're in this

136
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:27,160
cup all right so the second tip I'm

137
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:29,199
going to give you is that we are going

138
00:05:27,160 --> 00:05:31,720
to use the same growing medium that we

139
00:05:29,199 --> 00:05:35,120
started Ed these tomatoes in this is the

140
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,960
same soil it's sterile there's no

141
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,720
amendments or anything whatsoever in

142
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:40,240
this soil we're actually going to take

143
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:42,160
two scoops of this and we're going to

144
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:45,240
put in a 5 gallon

145
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:47,000
bucket and there's no real accurate

146
00:05:45,240 --> 00:05:49,960
measurement to this but I take two of

147
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:52,600
those Scoops and you can see and I take

148
00:05:49,960 --> 00:05:55,280
a 4 oz scoop of garden

149
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,520
tone and you guys know I swear by Garden

150
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,199
tone and if you don't know what Garden

151
00:05:56,520 --> 00:05:59,520
tone is I'll put a picture of it over

152
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,080
here so you can see it you can get it

153
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:02,919
track Supply you get at Lowe's you get

154
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,479
at Walmart sometimes but I'm going to

155
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,160
take a 4 o scoop a level scoop and I'm

156
00:06:05,479 --> 00:06:09,400
going to put in that bucket with those

157
00:06:07,160 --> 00:06:10,560
two scoops of soil and then I'm going to

158
00:06:09,400 --> 00:06:12,400
just take my hands I'm going to work

159
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,560
that in and mix it up really good and

160
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:17,000
what this is is our pre-plant fertilizer

161
00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:18,919
and if you followed our Channel enough

162
00:06:17,000 --> 00:06:21,560
you know that I preached that you need

163
00:06:18,919 --> 00:06:24,880
to put down pre-plant fertilizer when

164
00:06:21,560 --> 00:06:27,039
you can for plants that are heavy

165
00:06:24,880 --> 00:06:29,919
feeders like tomatoes like cabbage like

166
00:06:27,039 --> 00:06:32,400
cyers all these good vegetables they

167
00:06:29,919 --> 00:06:34,800
need a pre- plant fertilizer something

168
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:37,199
that is not already available in your

169
00:06:34,800 --> 00:06:40,199
garden give these guys what they need to

170
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:43,160
get a good start so now we have our

171
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,840
mended our up poot mixture which is the

172
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:47,160
same mixture it was started in it set

173
00:06:44,840 --> 00:06:50,400
for it didn't have any mims in it our

174
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:52,280
seed starting uh media is sterile guys

175
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:54,800
we don't use any kind of mimt any kind

176
00:06:52,280 --> 00:06:56,560
of fertilizer in our seed starting media

177
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:58,280
and be careful what you're hearing out

178
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:59,680
there different videos I'm hearing a lot

179
00:06:58,280 --> 00:07:01,599
of guys that's telling people to

180
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,400
actually Mi fertilizer in their seed

181
00:07:01,599 --> 00:07:05,080
start media and you need to be careful

182
00:07:03,400 --> 00:07:06,479
with that you know there's a lot of good

183
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,440
Farmers out there there's a lot of guys

184
00:07:06,479 --> 00:07:09,840
that have some good content on YouTube

185
00:07:08,440 --> 00:07:11,080
but be careful what you're watching out

186
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:12,280
there because there's a lot of stuff out

187
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:14,520
there that can get you in a bind if

188
00:07:12,280 --> 00:07:16,440
you're not careful my advice to you is

189
00:07:14,520 --> 00:07:19,039
use a sterile seed starting mix and I

190
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,440
use Black Gold I get M attractor Supply

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:25,160
it's omry listed I mean it's organic um

192
00:07:22,440 --> 00:07:26,919
most Pete Moss is organic but basically

193
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:32,039
it

194
00:07:26,919 --> 00:07:35,440
is sterile and this is what it looks

195
00:07:32,039 --> 00:07:37,639
like made by Sun gold that's it that's

196
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:40,639
what I use and you can see it's arm

197
00:07:37,639 --> 00:07:42,840
listed so it's organic we can use it

198
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:44,479
here on our phone no amendments no

199
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,759
fertilizers no nothing we put it in

200
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,720
there each plant each seed has enough

201
00:07:46,759 --> 00:07:51,720
energy to get itself to its first set of

202
00:07:48,720 --> 00:07:54,199
true leaves period just naturally it can

203
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:56,120
do that once it gets to this

204
00:07:54,199 --> 00:07:58,319
stage is when you need to give it

205
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:00,360
something to feed

206
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:04,039
on

207
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:06,080
that's what we did in this bucket so the

208
00:08:04,039 --> 00:08:08,560
recap give your plant something big

209
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:10,560
enough to get a good root base in and

210
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,080
use a pre-plant fertilizer when you up

211
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:15,080
poot them not at planting the seed when

212
00:08:13,080 --> 00:08:16,840
you up poot it and now we're going to

213
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:19,440
talk about the last step which is to

214
00:08:16,840 --> 00:08:22,319
feed your plants once they're

215
00:08:19,440 --> 00:08:23,800
established now whenever you upot a

216
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:25,159
tomato plant pepper plant whatever

217
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,840
you're going to have some level of

218
00:08:25,159 --> 00:08:29,000
transplant shot that means that plant is

219
00:08:26,840 --> 00:08:30,840
just basically going to stall and it's

220
00:08:29,000 --> 00:08:33,399
going to establish itself get its roots

221
00:08:30,840 --> 00:08:35,599
going back in the you know into the soil

222
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:39,399
trying to run out and find its place in

223
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:42,560
there to basically get established

224
00:08:39,399 --> 00:08:44,320
before it starts growing again now um

225
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:45,959
you know all plants do it some do it

226
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:48,000
less than others it just depends on the

227
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:49,519
conditions but once your plant is

228
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:51,800
established and you can tell that it's

229
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:53,920
out of that shock stage you can start

230
00:08:51,800 --> 00:08:56,920
feeding it with a either a balanced

231
00:08:53,920 --> 00:09:00,000
fertilizer or in our case in tomatoes we

232
00:08:56,920 --> 00:09:02,360
want to put on some folage and get the

233
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,920
stocks of this plant a little thicker so

234
00:09:02,360 --> 00:09:05,959
once we plant it you don't see them just

235
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:08,320
drooping over like this they come flimsy

236
00:09:05,959 --> 00:09:10,200
they look leggy we want plants that are

237
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,160
rigid see I can wiggle this thing and

238
00:09:10,200 --> 00:09:13,839
see how rigid that plant is that's what

239
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:17,160
I like I like tomato plants that have a

240
00:09:13,839 --> 00:09:18,959
backbone to them and to do that before

241
00:09:17,160 --> 00:09:21,720
you get blooms on your plant what you

242
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:24,079
want to use is a higher nitrogen

243
00:09:21,720 --> 00:09:27,600
fertilizer and in our case since we do

244
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:31,160
plant or fertilize organically we use a

245
00:09:27,600 --> 00:09:33,079
Chilean nitrate which is what is in this

246
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:37,279
bag here it's a

247
00:09:33,079 --> 00:09:40,720
152 it is omry listed it is organic you

248
00:09:37,279 --> 00:09:43,240
see right here but it is a natural form

249
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:45,040
of nitrogen that your plant can utilize

250
00:09:43,240 --> 00:09:47,040
immediately it doesn't have to wait for

251
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:49,640
the soil to break it down your plants

252
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:52,000
can use this now and what we do is

253
00:09:49,640 --> 00:09:53,680
basically give our tomato plants a bath

254
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:56,440
in this stuff we set it in those totes

255
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:58,760
out there what I use is a a tablespoon

256
00:09:56,440 --> 00:10:01,760
and a half that scoop right there and

257
00:09:58,760 --> 00:10:03,519
five 5 gallons of water don't overdo it

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,720
so once these plants are young like they

259
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:09,240
are we take these things and we spoon

260
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,760
feed them to get them to look like this

261
00:10:09,240 --> 00:10:13,240
so to start with we're going to take

262
00:10:10,760 --> 00:10:15,760
this plant and we're going to water it

263
00:10:13,240 --> 00:10:17,680
nothing in the water just water plain

264
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:19,560
well water we're going to water this

265
00:10:17,680 --> 00:10:21,680
plant and let it get established once we

266
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:24,399
can tell that this plant is actually

267
00:10:21,680 --> 00:10:26,480
trying it's trying to grow then that's

268
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:30,440
when we're going to utilize

269
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,160
the nitrogen the organic nitrogen that's

270
00:10:30,440 --> 00:10:36,079
when we're going to utilize this stuff

271
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:39,920
here in our totes and bottom water these

272
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:42,680
guys and these plants will explode they

273
00:10:39,920 --> 00:10:44,480
will literally double in size in a week

274
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:46,760
I promise you all right guys so I got to

275
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,399
get busy but check back in with us later

276
00:10:46,760 --> 00:10:50,000
this week we're going to be up potting

277
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:51,920
these guys here all of the heirloom

278
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,720
tomatoes that we started in trays a

279
00:10:51,920 --> 00:10:56,160
couple of weeks ago and if you missed

280
00:10:53,720 --> 00:10:57,600
