  "text": "[Music] as sine patches Mar countless fields in the James River Valley and continue to grow Farmers have had to retreat from what may have been their best ground only a few decades ago the sine phenomenon continues its Relentless course UPS slope in fields robbing the land of its productivity draining Farmers pocketbooks leaving many to feel helpless in the face of this tidal wave of rising Waters and Sals two brothers in Beetle County South Dakota decided that business as usual was not an option in the face of this threat hi I'm Bose Clute and I'm a scientist but this is not my story to really understand the Hamilton's Journey we have to begin here about mid 80s our land at Arlington we used to drive a two wheel drive 165 horsepower tractor over there to farm and the one year we had a lot of rain and we're driving driving down a County Road and we're driving through a couple inches of water and I thought like everybody else well you know what it was a wet year next year the weather pattern will change and that water will go away well 5 years went by 10 years went by and that road didn't come back above water that road that I used to drive the two wheel drive tractor down has 25 plus feet of water over the top of it I'm Scott Hamilton I'm Jeff Hamilton I'm Scott's brother we have a mixed cropping mixed livestock operation we grow corn soybeans elf ala we're integrating Rye we've messed around some cover crops uh also using some Japanese Millet uh as a way to try to clean up some Fields without chemistry we're actually in five different counties and we try and incorporate our cow herd and cattle back through all our cropping Acres when I was in school I remember my dad saying you always grow some wheat some small grain cuz you never know if you're going to get enough rain for corn and when soybeans started coming in out here that would have been early ' 80s early 80s um and then that's sort of when these West these potholes in the state started filling with water yeah so yeah it it it was after probably in the 90s for the most part was the biggest change you know [Music] so we have a cropping field that it's been corn soy beans maybe back in time it had some wheat of course with our weather change over the years it had the last I don't know probably last what 15 years we haven't raised anything there in fact it was getting so bad well the kosher weed we didn't grow is pure saline it it would typically be wet in the spring you'd try to if you try to work it disc it or chisel it and after we got out of that after we started noing you'd swing the boom out there and kill it and so if you tried to disc it you would plant it and you'd grow nothing so you had to hope you didn't get stuck and then you go in there and you disc it and then you'd prevent PL it collect your government crop insurance check and it's like we can't just keep doing this yeah I economically I make make sense but the land was going backwards [Music] for me it started with the sing areas I got tired of growing nothing and it might L with the crop insurance CU you'll be able to collect your prevent plant for the first few years but once you're so far into it then you're getting zero production you know it's it's a it's a short-term gain is what it is shortterm short-term gain but if we're truly if we're truly stewards of the land we can't do things from a short-term gain standpoint well I took and went and bought some saline seed mix or it was mostly blend the wheed grasses um made sure it was pretty weed clean cuz uh barley foxtail would be the first thing it would start so we sprayed it with Roundup got it clean I think we SE it in June and by that fall I had I could Row the grass which I could not believe because it had not grown anything for 15 [Music] years we were was experimenting with just seeding a single blend of grass and that didn't really seem to work so we started working with a blend that would we could get into the saline sodic spots and just sort of experimented back and forth and we came up with this blend that uh this Seed Company calls the Hamilton the blend is uh has some wheat grasses in it it has a Garrison creeping fox tail um it has a little bit of I think they're putting a little bit of fescue in it and then we also have some slendy Max or a saline Al Alpha that can stand with sand saline areas [Music] well when we first was working with that seed blend I wanted to put a mix in there so a lot of times it's difficult to get in to seed those due to being too wet or so forth or so on and I had seeded monocultures and if I had the wrong weather event I would end up losing everything so I what by putting multiple species in there if it was too saline uh then the wheat grasses would take over if it was too sodic The Garrison creep and fox tail and and maybe the Fescue and Reeds would take over and and with the the alala in there what'll happen is is the wheat grasses will go in those saline areas then that here comes the great the the slendy Max or the saline elf Alpha will start fallowing that in and they complement each other so if you have alphalpha there plus the grass you have a legume growing some nitrogen and enhances your forage production um if you cut it three times your first cutting will be half cool season half half Alpha then your second cutting will be mostly all alphaalpha if you cut it the third time it'll sort of be half and half but by having that together uh you're covering all your bases and the soil types uh determine which species Grows Where [Music] we started doing business with a a guy that is very good at delineating soil types uh because we are extremely variable and when I say extremely variable uh we can go from Z to 150 bushel yield difference in corn and we do that in 150 ft and we do that multiple times across a half mile path of our field as we've changed our and new technologies that are available to us uh I started VAR aberrating my seed I we kept Vari brating my fertilizer um kept looking at these areas and we started planting these saling areas back to the Hamilton blend 3 four five acres at a time and since 2016 uh probably two years ago we'd probably done 150 acres at that time uh we've done more since [Music] the first step in recovering and is first of all you have to make a change and to the change that was the easiest to make for us is to stop spraying those areas well yeah you have to change your attitude you have to change your mindset you got to I do all the spraying so you have to make sure you save those spaces or don't spray them and and you know be cognizant of your wind and so forth and and care and try you know in some Fields we've we've had we're in the third year of not spraying the sloos the Rye is a good way to amend that soil uh and it helps with your weed control Japanese Millet will grow into the sine salinity areas further than the Rye will um both of those plants have a phenomenal root system on them uh going back to that kosha plant you know the areas that didn't grow kosha the next step when you stop spraying it is we'll we'll have a stunted kosher plant it'll be a grayish color and it gets about this tall and never really changes well next year you'll turn that that kosha plant some of those areas will turn into a dark green koser well part of that is is you got to have those plant species there that are putting rots down that are putting EX down which create your biology in your soil or your Livestock in your soil then you can start doing things if we just get out of Mother Nature's Way She will fix herself I'm convinced of that we're in the process of trying to trying to actually prove [Music] that if we can get kosha growing we can use utilize livestock to harvest kosher actually cattle really at a vegetative state really like kosher and kosha is your first step of maybe barley fox tail livestock don't like that so much but barley fox tail might provide a a cover for seeding inter seeding your grass seed into you know as as a livestock and crop Farmers hay is a crop and a lot of people strictly crop farming don't consider hay a crop and so you have to sort of change your mental capacity and we're always looking for forage and those areas well we're where we've had the Hamilton we're doing 3 to 3 and 1/2 ton an acre on Acres that weren't producing [Music] anything but the other thing is is when we're seating This Grass blend is we make the mistake of just going to the edge of the salt actually we need you make need to make three runs into the up plan by doing that that so saine place will fill in faster than just concentrating on it so if you can take your good land and sacrifice three passes with a drill that'll enhance your recovery a lot more so if we can get uh if we can get these plant species established in the Upland and they're more mature they'll handle the higher salt levels and saline levels and then that way Our Roots will just start leading the others in there from a wildlife species standpoint and it takes all the pressure out of it because if he's spraying it where where are our trouble wheat they're growing in the areas where where we can't grow a crop well and even the going back to the hunting or Wildlife you know it's really it's tough hunting in a standing corn field especially in 30in rows what's really great is if you can push them out of the cornfield into the saline spots that we've got this perennial grass and you have a great deer hunt or a great pheasant hunt you know or Grouse or whatever um you know that's another thing is those saline areas that are put to a plant species sort to become our pollinator you know so they have bugs which pheasants like or other game um you know there's another species of of animals or insects that complement our whole biology you know you know you can have the best of both worlds you can have something that you can uh the cattle will like and and for me the pheasant hunting and the hay is important but really for me it became a joy of watching a piece of soil that did not grow anything it would not grow a corn plant it would not grow a soybean plant when go crocher we and and yes and and now we're growing very desirable plants we did this without external fertilizer being used and we did it without uh chemical because there isn't a chemical We can spray on you manage it by haying it you can manage it by grazing it there's better ways to do it than hey my planet is this big and I want a square [Music] field I hope the Hamilton story has helped you view salinity differently the good news is that South Dakota has the expertise to turn these Acres around using natural systems but this will take some thought some time and some planning visit this video description below for more information and remember like planting a tree the best time to address salinity was 20 years ago the second best time is today from growing resilience I'm bz Clute so long [Music]",
