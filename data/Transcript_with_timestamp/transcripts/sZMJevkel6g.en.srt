I will wait a little bit here I've got

8
00:00:40,629 --> 00:00:44,019
some fun stuff to share I'm not sure my

9
00:00:42,430 --> 00:00:45,910
connection seems a little funny so I

10
00:00:44,019 --> 00:00:48,580
will wait and see if we can get some

11
00:00:45,910 --> 00:00:51,309
other people on here I thought we'd

12
00:00:48,580 --> 00:00:54,879
share some homesteading and off-grid and

13
00:00:51,309 --> 00:00:58,500
life tips with everybody this morning so

14
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:58,500
I'm just gonna wait a little bit here

15
00:01:02,400 --> 00:01:06,820
well gorgeous weather we are having I am

16
00:01:05,170 --> 00:01:09,670
like so excited that's why my cheeks are

17
00:01:06,820 --> 00:01:12,520
all flushed I just did a treatment out

18
00:01:09,670 --> 00:01:14,260
on my back porch in the Sun and it just

19
00:01:12,520 --> 00:01:17,439
felt so good to be sitting there soaking

20
00:01:14,260 --> 00:01:18,970
up the vitamin D which I need also so it

21
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,490
was just it's just wonderful but our

22
00:01:18,970 --> 00:01:24,189
weather's been low 70s and it has just

23
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:26,530
been gorgeous with a nice breeze and

24
00:01:24,189 --> 00:01:28,450
just very refreshing I could handle

25
00:01:26,530 --> 00:01:30,760
these temperatures all year long this is

26
00:01:28,450 --> 00:01:32,920
just awesome and it just smells so good

27
00:01:30,760 --> 00:01:36,460
outside so many things are blooming and

28
00:01:32,920 --> 00:01:38,200
it just it's it's wonderful so it's not

29
00:01:36,460 --> 00:01:41,710
looking like anybody's jumping on right

30
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,420
yet so I am going to dive in here share

31
00:01:41,710 --> 00:01:45,190

36
00:01:55,510 --> 00:02:01,210
an absolutely amazing weekend this past

37
00:01:59,350 --> 00:02:03,850
weekend we actually got a chance to get

38
00:02:01,210 --> 00:02:07,600
away the mountain boy wasn't interested

39
00:02:03,850 --> 00:02:09,879
in going so he stayed home here and held

40
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:11,500
down the fort with the dogs and the

41
00:02:09,879 --> 00:02:13,989
mountain man and I got to get out with

42
00:02:11,500 --> 00:02:18,430
some friends of ours and go camping and

43
00:02:13,989 --> 00:02:21,580
we actually camped in our hammocks both

44
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:24,760
in Montana and in Idaho we did like a

45
00:02:21,580 --> 00:02:27,459
big loop and it was just such an amazing

46
00:02:24,760 --> 00:02:30,099
escape sometimes we just need to do that

47
00:02:27,459 --> 00:02:31,900
and escape and get out there but I'm

48
00:02:30,099 --> 00:02:34,060

00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:39,560
the other ones there we go it's just fun

72
00:03:38,090 --> 00:03:42,020
to be able to share I got to get a

73
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:43,400
little bit more techie here and be able

74
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,750
to share things a little differently

75
00:03:43,400 --> 00:03:47,090
with you but right now I'm going to

76
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:48,650
share it this way in the comments below

77
00:03:47,090 --> 00:03:52,040
you should be able to see three photos

78
00:03:48,650 --> 00:03:54,530
my mountain man is a tremendous cook

79
00:03:52,040 --> 00:04:00,470
when it comes to well no matter where we

80
00:03:54,530 --> 00:04:03,200
are he is really good on an open fire as

81
00:04:00,470 --> 00:04:04,550
far as cooking our meals he used to do a

82
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,620
lot of pack trips back in the

83
00:04:04,550 --> 00:04:09,530
backcountry in Wyoming and he did a lot

84
00:04:06,620 --> 00:04:12,350
of hunting trips as well so he was camp

85
00:04:09,530 --> 00:04:14,870
cook and also guide but in the one

86
00:04:12,350 --> 00:04:17,390
picture you can see him making fry bread

87
00:04:14,870 --> 00:04:20,210
and in the other picture you can see

88
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:22,670
that he's got elk steaks on a skewer

89
00:04:20,210 --> 00:04:25,730
over the fire we've got coffee going on

90
00:04:22,670 --> 00:04:28,610
and potatoes in a big frying pan and

91
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,580
then he also made eggs so we might hike

92
00:04:28,610 --> 00:04:33,440
but we we eat well out there it's good

93
00:04:31,580 --> 00:04:36,080
that we do hike we come back a lot

94
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:37,520
heavier I think but he's an amazing cook

95
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:39,950
and it's just there's nothing better

96
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:42,950
than cooking on an open fire so right

97
00:04:39,950 --> 00:04:45,740
now we are taking advantage of the

98
00:04:42,950 --> 00:04:48,169
opportunity good morning Sean good

99
00:04:45,740 --> 00:04:51,440
morning Debbie we are taking advantage

100
00:04:48,169 --> 00:04:54,230
of being out there and being able

101
00:04:51,440 --> 00:04:56,060
to take opportunities with the open fire

102
00:04:54,230 --> 00:04:58,250
because it gets so dry here that later

103
00:04:56,060 --> 00:04:59,990
on this season we won't be able to have

104
00:04:58,250 --> 00:05:01,910
an open fire and cook on it so it really

105
00:04:59,990 --> 00:05:05,000
sucks sometimes because there's nothing

106
00:05:01,910 --> 00:05:06,500
better I love sitting by my campfire and

107
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:10,250
just taking it all in

108
00:05:06,500 --> 00:05:12,380
and in the other picture you can see my

109
00:05:10,250 --> 00:05:14,330
feet on my hammock we were hanging on

110
00:05:12,380 --> 00:05:17,300
the side of the mountain on the first

111
00:05:14,330 --> 00:05:19,430
night in Montana and it was awesome now

112
00:05:17,300 --> 00:05:21,280
we did have a big tarp over top of us

113
00:05:19,430 --> 00:05:24,820
because it was a little sketchy looking

114
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:27,710
but we were he enabled that by using

115
00:05:24,820 --> 00:05:31,340
mule tape which is some heavy cordage

116
00:05:27,710 --> 00:05:33,980
and we strung that zigzagged across the

117
00:05:31,340 --> 00:05:36,500
trees above us and we're able to put a

118
00:05:33,980 --> 00:05:38,660
tarp up so we stayed dry but I have to

119
00:05:36,500 --> 00:05:39,920
share this this was really wild a storm

120
00:05:38,660 --> 00:05:42,050
blew in and of course it was an

121
00:05:39,920 --> 00:05:43,970
electrical storm and we're hanging there

122
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:45,770
in the trees and our friend and his kids

123
00:05:43,970 --> 00:05:49,640
and the dogs were an attempt below us

124
00:05:45,770 --> 00:05:51,710
and the storm started coming in but all

125
00:05:49,640 --> 00:05:53,810
of a sudden simultaneously the lightning

126
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:55,880
and the Thunder hit and it was so close

127
00:05:53,810 --> 00:05:57,560
that it made your hair stand up and you

128
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:00,230
could just feel it go through your

129
00:05:57,560 --> 00:06:03,200
entire body it was really freaky it was

130
00:06:00,230 --> 00:06:05,390
that close and I was ready to dive and

131
00:06:03,200 --> 00:06:08,300
hit the truck just because the truck has

132
00:06:05,390 --> 00:06:10,040
the rubber and it's safer place to be

133
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:14,510
than hanging in a tree good morning Chad

134
00:06:10,040 --> 00:06:16,280
and waited it out a little bit and that

135
00:06:14,510 --> 00:06:19,250
it just started to dissipate then but

136
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:21,590
man it was you know our eyes were closed

137
00:06:19,250 --> 00:06:23,419
and it was like somebody just shined the

138
00:06:21,590 --> 00:06:25,190
brightest light possible in our eyes it

139
00:06:23,419 --> 00:06:29,660
was really crazy but it was also really

140
00:06:25,190 --> 00:06:31,850
neat to experience and we had not camped

141
00:06:29,660 --> 00:06:33,830
the whole weekend then and had really

142
00:06:31,850 --> 00:06:35,300
got to see some nice scenery some

143
00:06:33,830 --> 00:06:37,460
different parts of Idaho that we haven't

144
00:06:35,300 --> 00:06:39,169
seen before so it was really nice but I

145
00:06:37,460 --> 00:06:42,260
encourage you guys to get out get out

146
00:06:39,169 --> 00:06:44,090
practice your skills sleep in the wild

147
00:06:42,260 --> 00:06:47,180
if you haven't you're missing out some

148
00:06:44,090 --> 00:06:49,490
of you may not like it but I'm a dirt

149
00:06:47,180 --> 00:06:51,740
girl I like being out in the dirt I like

150
00:06:49,490 --> 00:06:53,630
you know I'm not keen on spiders because

151
00:06:51,740 --> 00:06:55,700
I react poorly to their bites but

152
00:06:53,630 --> 00:06:57,770
they're easy to flick and fling and get

153
00:06:55,700 --> 00:06:59,600
rid of and just hanging in the trees

154
00:06:57,770 --> 00:07:02,360
like that there's just nothing better a

155
00:06:59,600 --> 00:07:04,190
wise old woodsman once told me a good

156
00:07:02,360 --> 00:07:04,710
campfire will cure anything that ails

157
00:07:04,190 --> 00:07:08,190
you

158
00:07:04,710 --> 00:07:11,130
amen Shawn amen is that not true it's

159
00:07:08,190 --> 00:07:14,100
just amazing the food tastes better it's

160
00:07:11,130 --> 00:07:14,820
aroma therapy going on it's just is

161
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:17,100
awesome

162
00:07:14,820 --> 00:07:19,199
and I did good I was really concerned

163
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:22,259
because I went I wasn't sure with my

164
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:25,229
body and my my illness as to whether

165
00:07:22,259 --> 00:07:26,580
being out there amongst all the molds

166
00:07:25,229 --> 00:07:29,820
because everything said wet right now

167
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:32,009
how I would do but I had a little bit of

168
00:07:29,820 --> 00:07:36,720
head pain I think more from our height

169
00:07:32,009 --> 00:07:38,880
and the barometric pressure but I like

170
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:40,199
like Shawn said I think the fire cured

171
00:07:38,880 --> 00:07:42,150
all that was ailing me so it's

172
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:44,280
absolutely amazing so guys don't miss

173
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:47,039
out on getting out and don't forget to

174
00:07:44,280 --> 00:07:48,900
take your kids such great learning and

175
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:52,740
opportunities to be out there and teach

176
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:55,710
them things I also wanted to share with

177
00:07:52,740 --> 00:07:59,009
you my goodies there's my spearmint

178
00:07:55,710 --> 00:08:00,990
jelly that is finished and my dandelion

179
00:07:59,009 --> 00:08:05,220
jelly you can see that's a little bit

180
00:08:00,990 --> 00:08:06,720
lighter and then here is the lilac now

181
00:08:05,220 --> 00:08:08,520
you can I don't know if you can see that

182
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:11,610
but it actually does have like a purple

183
00:08:08,520 --> 00:08:15,240
tinge to it and I also have my

184
00:08:11,610 --> 00:08:17,340
strawberry and there's nothing better

185
00:08:15,240 --> 00:08:18,870
than fresh jellies especially when

186
00:08:17,340 --> 00:08:22,110
you're making them from what most people

187
00:08:18,870 --> 00:08:24,120
consider weeds and the lilacs I was

188
00:08:22,110 --> 00:08:27,889
blessed by my friend Vicki who shared

189
00:08:24,120 --> 00:08:30,180
some of her lilac blooms but

190
00:08:27,889 --> 00:08:31,919
everything's out there guys it's all at

191
00:08:30,180 --> 00:08:33,390
your fingertips just like it is mine

192
00:08:31,919 --> 00:08:36,180
it's just a matter of taking the time

193
00:08:33,390 --> 00:08:38,849
and and and getting out there and doing

194
00:08:36,180 --> 00:08:40,919
it yes get the kids out there absolutely

195
00:08:38,849 --> 00:08:43,469
Chad Chad's another one who's constantly

196
00:08:40,919 --> 00:08:44,940
out there with his littles and it's just

197
00:08:43,469 --> 00:08:46,050
it's a great being out there with your

198
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:48,930
kids there's nothing better than

199
00:08:46,050 --> 00:08:51,150
teaching the kids how to do these things

200
00:08:48,930 --> 00:08:55,290
they get so empowered our friends kids

201
00:08:51,150 --> 00:08:57,420
are what's the age-wise well I'm gonna

202
00:08:55,290 --> 00:08:59,130
go buy grade ones going into third grade

203
00:08:57,420 --> 00:09:02,100
next year should be finishing second

204
00:08:59,130 --> 00:09:04,770
grade this right now and the other is

205
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:10,320
finishing kindergarten going to first so

206
00:09:04,770 --> 00:09:13,740
six and nine eight nine Navy great kids

207
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:15,720
and they just love being out there and

208
00:09:13,740 --> 00:09:17,640
they had the opportunity to each build

209
00:09:15,720 --> 00:09:18,209
their fire ring while Glenn was making

210
00:09:17,640 --> 00:09:20,309
the meal

211
00:09:18,209 --> 00:09:22,230
and they practice starting their fires

212
00:09:20,309 --> 00:09:25,740
and gathering their materials and

213
00:09:22,230 --> 00:09:27,509
keeping the fire going so you know that

214
00:09:25,740 --> 00:09:29,579
skill although some people would be

215
00:09:27,509 --> 00:09:32,850
fearful that that's teaching them you

216
00:09:29,579 --> 00:09:35,069
know how to do something dangerous yeah

217
00:09:32,850 --> 00:09:36,509
but it's also teaching them how to do

218
00:09:35,069 --> 00:09:38,670
something that could save their life if

219
00:09:36,509 --> 00:09:41,009
they're ever stuck somewhere even if

220
00:09:38,670 --> 00:09:42,839
they don't use it as as a child but they

221
00:09:41,009 --> 00:09:43,889
use it as an adult because they learned

222
00:09:42,839 --> 00:09:46,470
it when they were out in the woods with

223
00:09:43,889 --> 00:09:48,480
their dad plus it's such a great time to

224
00:09:46,470 --> 00:09:49,860
bond with your kids honestly and I told

225
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:51,329
the mountain boy today on our walk I

226
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:52,709
said next time we're going out he's got

227
00:09:51,329 --> 00:09:54,329
to go with because he missed out on so

228
00:09:52,709 --> 00:09:55,920
much fun he was just afraid he was gonna

229
00:09:54,329 --> 00:09:58,110
be too cold

230
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:01,679
last time we were camping it was pretty

231
00:09:58,110 --> 00:10:02,369
cold so anyway I want to share something

232
00:10:01,679 --> 00:10:05,040
else with you

233
00:10:02,369 --> 00:10:06,600
you guys hear a lot about modern

234
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:09,269
homesteading you hear a lot about off

235
00:10:06,600 --> 00:10:13,559
gridding you hear a lot about you know

236
00:10:09,269 --> 00:10:17,639
primitive skills and things and a lot of

237
00:10:13,559 --> 00:10:21,540
average people feel that that doesn't

238
00:10:17,639 --> 00:10:23,459
apply to them but honestly I feel all of

239
00:10:21,540 --> 00:10:26,579
those skills traditional primitive

240
00:10:23,459 --> 00:10:29,490
homesteading off-grid all those skills

241
00:10:26,579 --> 00:10:33,779
are things that the average man should

242
00:10:29,490 --> 00:10:35,369
know because they are for us a lifestyle

243
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:36,839
of preparedness they are things that we

244
00:10:35,369 --> 00:10:40,740
think about all the time good morning

245
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:42,389
Blake glad to have you joining me Sean

246
00:10:40,740 --> 00:10:44,339
says practice and understanding doesn't

247
00:10:42,389 --> 00:10:47,040
mean it's dangerous it teaches respect

248
00:10:44,339 --> 00:10:48,839
and discipline absolutely absolutely and

249
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:52,470
and that's that's what it's about plus

250
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:56,160
it also empowers encourages and gives

251
00:10:52,470 --> 00:10:58,379
them confidence and and also pride that

252
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:01,679
they're being included in in the

253
00:10:58,379 --> 00:11:04,079
opportunity to participate that just

254
00:11:01,679 --> 00:11:05,519
giving them a pack these kids each have

255
00:11:04,079 --> 00:11:07,110
their own little pocket knife starter

256
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,999
pocket knife and they're whittling all

257
00:11:07,110 --> 00:11:11,549
the time while we're out there they get

258
00:11:08,999 --> 00:11:14,040
their hot dog sticks ready and you know

259
00:11:11,549 --> 00:11:15,839
and they've cut themselves while we're

260
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:17,610
out we've had a patch them up but you

261
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:20,040
know what it's it's part of experience

262
00:11:17,610 --> 00:11:21,689
and and it'll teach them just like you

263
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:24,720
said it's gonna teach them the respect

264
00:11:21,689 --> 00:11:25,920
for the for the the equipment so great

265
00:11:24,720 --> 00:11:30,419
great thoughts and thanks for sharing

266
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,490
that Sean but the skills that we share

267
00:11:30,419 --> 00:11:33,230
and when I

268
00:11:31,490 --> 00:11:35,899
sharing the modern homesteading things

269
00:11:33,230 --> 00:11:37,520
and the and the gardening things you

270
00:11:35,899 --> 00:11:40,040
know if you live in town and you're

271
00:11:37,520 --> 00:11:42,529
living vicariously it doesn't mean you

272
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:44,990
can't do these things it doesn't mean

273
00:11:42,529 --> 00:11:47,570
that just because where you are is is

274
00:11:44,990 --> 00:11:49,399
limiting you and and knowing these

275
00:11:47,570 --> 00:11:50,779
things and practicing these things you

276
00:11:49,399 --> 00:11:52,339
know even if you live in an apartment

277
00:11:50,779 --> 00:11:54,110
there's nothing stopping you from

278
00:11:52,339 --> 00:11:56,779
getting out into the woods and getting

279
00:11:54,110 --> 00:11:59,510
some dirt time and also experiencing it

280
00:11:56,779 --> 00:12:01,250
so don't limit yourself and don't feel

281
00:11:59,510 --> 00:12:02,690
limited when somebody says modern

282
00:12:01,250 --> 00:12:04,399
homesteading things and you're not a

283
00:12:02,690 --> 00:12:07,310
homesteader so you don't participate

284
00:12:04,399 --> 00:12:09,709
please don't limit yourself knowledge is

285
00:12:07,310 --> 00:12:11,540
power and it doesn't matter where you

286
00:12:09,709 --> 00:12:13,580
are or what you're doing in your life

287
00:12:11,540 --> 00:12:15,260
today you can still learn these skills

288
00:12:13,580 --> 00:12:16,850
and these skills are what are going to

289
00:12:15,260 --> 00:12:20,899
carry you through if anything were to

290
00:12:16,850 --> 00:12:23,209
ever happen in any way to our country to

291
00:12:20,899 --> 00:12:26,060
your your family you know we've gone

292
00:12:23,209 --> 00:12:27,500
through situations had we not lived a

293
00:12:26,060 --> 00:12:30,560
life of preparedness with our food

294
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,850
storage in 2016 when we went six and a

295
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:33,560
half months without an income we would

296
00:12:31,850 --> 00:12:35,480
have been eating unless we were foraging

297
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,980
and harvesting and we know how to do

298
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:38,899
that but it would have been adding more

299
00:12:36,980 --> 00:12:41,360
stress to the fire when we were already

300
00:12:38,899 --> 00:12:43,310
very stressed so eating like kings and

301
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:45,829
queens because we planned ahead and

302
00:12:43,310 --> 00:12:47,630
prepared it's key and and that's what

303
00:12:45,829 --> 00:12:50,089
these things are for so the reason I'm

304
00:12:47,630 --> 00:12:53,750
mentioning that today is because in

305
00:12:50,089 --> 00:12:55,760
addition to getting the tray at

306
00:12:53,750 --> 00:12:59,060
Wilderness Academy live and running

307
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:01,670
I was also videoing a segment for the

308
00:12:59,060 --> 00:13:04,220
modern homesteading summit that my great

309
00:13:01,670 --> 00:13:06,140
friend Melissa Norris is running and I

310
00:13:04,220 --> 00:13:08,360
love her dearly and I'm so proud of her

311
00:13:06,140 --> 00:13:10,760
she put together a really nice summit

312
00:13:08,360 --> 00:13:12,980

it at your convenience I did a course on

00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:25,190
things to think about before going off

317
00:13:20,839 --> 00:13:27,320
grid and there are 26 other homesteaders

318
00:13:25,190 --> 00:13:30,050
and off-gridders that have shared their

319
00:13:27,320 --> 00:13:32,540

00:13:30,050 --> 00:13:33,860
you to go check it out you can go there

321
00:13:32,540 --> 00:13:37,579

freezer I have this in my freezer this

365
00:15:19,290 --> 00:15:23,730
was shared with me this is not my own

366
00:15:20,999 --> 00:15:25,709
idea but it's ingenious and I'm going to

367
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:27,749
share it I don't know who the original

368
00:15:25,709 --> 00:15:33,989
person was but my dear friend Mona

369
00:15:27,749 --> 00:15:36,739
shared it with me there is if I can get

370
00:15:33,989 --> 00:15:40,049
it out of here there's a quarter in here

371
00:15:36,739 --> 00:15:43,709
there we go there's a quarter on the top

372
00:15:40,049 --> 00:15:46,379
of my frozen ice so say you're out and

373
00:15:43,709 --> 00:15:47,999
your freezer goes out and the electric

374
00:15:46,379 --> 00:15:51,660
goes out so your freezers your freezers

375
00:15:47,999 --> 00:15:53,309
off while you're at work and for us we

376
00:15:51,660 --> 00:15:55,259
have a propane freezer but our lines

377
00:15:53,309 --> 00:15:57,569
could get clogged or our tank could run

378
00:15:55,259 --> 00:15:58,839
out and and it would shut it off till we

379
00:15:57,569 --> 00:16:02,740
switch the tanks

380
00:15:58,839 --> 00:16:07,480
so it could happen to us too by having

381
00:16:02,740 --> 00:16:10,120
that quarter on top of ice if your power

382
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,329
goes out and your freezer starts to thaw

383
00:16:10,120 --> 00:16:16,269
if that quarter ends up at the bottom

384
00:16:13,329 --> 00:16:18,519
you know very well that your meats

385
00:16:16,269 --> 00:16:19,959
probably spoiled because it's been off

386
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:22,990
for a long time and at which point you

387
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:26,170
have no idea how long it's been off but

388
00:16:22,990 --> 00:16:28,329
if that quarter only ends up Midway that

389
00:16:26,170 --> 00:16:31,600
means that your food did not get spoiled

390
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:33,459
and and that you can still save what's

391
00:16:31,600 --> 00:16:35,139
in your freezer that it probably may

392
00:16:33,459 --> 00:16:38,320
have thought a little bit but it reefer

393
00:16:35,139 --> 00:16:40,630
it's gonna refreeze or it's part way but

394
00:16:38,320 --> 00:16:44,680
by having that in there it gives you a

395
00:16:40,630 --> 00:16:47,470
gauge on how long the freezers been off

396
00:16:44,680 --> 00:16:49,089
so I encourage everybody to do that

397
00:16:47,470 --> 00:16:51,279
because I know many people who have

398
00:16:49,089 --> 00:16:54,370
thrown away a whole freezer full of meat

399
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,889
and things because they weren't sure how

400
00:16:54,370 --> 00:16:58,690
long it was off and sometimes it's

401
00:16:56,889 --> 00:17:01,269
pretty evident especially if you've been

402
00:16:58,690 --> 00:17:04,600
gone for a while you'll smell it first

403
00:17:01,269 --> 00:17:07,449
but this is a great little gauge to be

404
00:17:04,600 --> 00:17:09,520
able to determine how long your freezers

405
00:17:07,449 --> 00:17:13,240
been off the other thing to keep in mind

406
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:14,500
is I use glass good morning Holly you

407
00:17:13,240 --> 00:17:16,240
don't want to fill it the whole way up

408
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:20,110
or this jars gonna crack good morning

409
00:17:16,240 --> 00:17:22,240
Kerry so fill it like three quarters of

410
00:17:20,110 --> 00:17:25,299
the way and put your quarter in the top

411
00:17:22,240 --> 00:17:27,040
and that way you will have a gauge to

412
00:17:25,299 --> 00:17:29,260
know how long your freezers been out

413
00:17:27,040 --> 00:17:34,179
when the power goes off if you're out of

414
00:17:29,260 --> 00:17:35,530
the house and you can also if the power

415
00:17:34,179 --> 00:17:37,540
does go out and you're there and you

416
00:17:35,530 --> 00:17:39,760
don't have a generator if you keep your

417
00:17:37,540 --> 00:17:41,650
freezers closed they will stay cold for

418
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:44,290
a long time so there's a good chance

419
00:17:41,650 --> 00:17:46,000
that you will be able to you know save

420
00:17:44,290 --> 00:17:48,160
things if it's only goes out for a

421
00:17:46,000 --> 00:17:50,169
couple of hours that's awesome I know

422
00:17:48,160 --> 00:17:52,840
what I'm doing well I know isn't that

423
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,400
one when Mona told me I was like you

424
00:17:52,840 --> 00:17:56,770
know aha

425
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:59,410
you know duh but that's that's such a

426
00:17:56,770 --> 00:18:01,150
great such a great way engaged to be

427
00:17:59,410 --> 00:18:04,240
able to double-check you know what's

428
00:18:01,150 --> 00:18:06,220
going on in your freezer and and with

429
00:18:04,240 --> 00:18:08,290
all the game meat we have and the work

430
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:09,309
that is required that's required to get

431
00:18:08,290 --> 00:18:12,070
it in our freezer

432
00:18:09,309 --> 00:18:13,660
I would absolutely be sick if we

433
00:18:12,070 --> 00:18:15,340
and I'm sure you guys would too

434
00:18:13,660 --> 00:18:16,840
especially if you're purchasing things

435
00:18:15,340 --> 00:18:19,510
as well because then you've got money

436
00:18:16,840 --> 00:18:21,700
tied up in it we have time and sweat and

437
00:18:19,510 --> 00:18:23,770
sometimes blood tied up into getting our

438
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:27,760
meats in the freezer not so much the

439
00:18:23,770 --> 00:18:31,300
money but nobody wants to throw good

440
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:33,010
food away now good deal good deal Tammy

441
00:18:31,300 --> 00:18:34,630
yeah that's a great it's a great idea

442
00:18:33,010 --> 00:18:36,730
you don't have to use glass you can use

443
00:18:34,630 --> 00:18:39,280
a plastic container but I figured that

444
00:18:36,730 --> 00:18:39,970
was easiest it enables me to see through

445
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:46,270
it real well

446
00:18:39,970 --> 00:18:49,630
hello truly so guys it's really

447
00:18:46,270 --> 00:18:51,730
important to be able to educate

448
00:18:49,630 --> 00:18:54,670
ourselves and learn how to do these

449
00:18:51,730 --> 00:18:57,990
things and not be fearful and not be

450
00:18:54,670 --> 00:19:01,240
afraid hi Becca to not be afraid of

451
00:18:57,990 --> 00:19:02,770
making mistakes guys mistakes happen all

452
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,920
the time and without a mistake you're

453
00:19:02,770 --> 00:19:09,130
not going to learn so you know I I look

454
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:10,150
at mistakes and and mishaps as

455
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:12,220
stepping-stones

456
00:19:10,150 --> 00:19:13,780
it all depends how you look at it you

457
00:19:12,220 --> 00:19:15,610
know that my cup is over always

458
00:19:13,780 --> 00:19:19,420
overflowing and I'm more thankful that I

459
00:19:15,610 --> 00:19:21,820
have a cup than how full it is so it's

460
00:19:19,420 --> 00:19:23,560
my positive perspective but if you use

461
00:19:21,820 --> 00:19:25,090
your mistakes as stepping stones you'll

462
00:19:23,560 --> 00:19:28,120
constantly be moving forward not

463
00:19:25,090 --> 00:19:30,490
backward right so those of you that just

464
00:19:28,120 --> 00:19:32,200
jumped on I was mentioning that with

465
00:19:30,490 --> 00:19:33,760
them you know all the modern

466
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,980
homesteading and off-grid things that

467
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:37,420
are being shared and and different

468
00:19:35,980 --> 00:19:39,250
skills that are being shared you know

469
00:19:37,420 --> 00:19:40,390
sometimes people feel that that doesn't

470
00:19:39,250 --> 00:19:43,870
pertain to them because they're not

471
00:19:40,390 --> 00:19:45,670
actually homesteaders or offgridders but

472
00:19:43,870 --> 00:19:47,860
this knowledge is open to all of us so

473
00:19:45,670 --> 00:19:49,900
check out below directly under the word

474
00:19:47,860 --> 00:19:51,730
resources are the two links that I was

475
00:19:49,900 --> 00:19:53,410
sharing for the modern homesteading

476
00:19:51,730 --> 00:19:55,630
summit that's coming up on June 10th

477
00:19:53,410 --> 00:19:58,000
that you can get involved in now and if

478
00:19:55,630 --> 00:19:59,800
you're interested in being able to watch

479
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:01,270
them later they've got a great price on

480
00:19:59,800 --> 00:20:03,640
it right now

481
00:20:01,270 --> 00:20:10,360
and then the grow your own food summit

482
00:20:03,640 --> 00:20:12,850
is doing their encore days sorry had a

483
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:14,500
brain fart for a moment so check that

484
00:20:12,850 --> 00:20:16,240
out and for those of you that just

485
00:20:14,500 --> 00:20:18,640
jumped in I shared some pictures of our

486
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,380
weekend in the comments below so that

487
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:22,090
you can check those out it's always

488
00:20:20,380 --> 00:20:24,780
important to get out and step away from

489
00:20:22,090 --> 00:20:27,810
our chaos we all have chaos

490
00:20:24,780 --> 00:20:29,280
and last week I shared about endurance

491
00:20:27,810 --> 00:20:32,490
and I want to just share something with

492
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:35,850
you I was doing my devotions outside

493
00:20:32,490 --> 00:20:38,220
this morning and I was going through

494
00:20:35,850 --> 00:20:39,660
Hebrews and read this and I just thought

495
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:40,860
it pertains so much I almost wish I

496
00:20:39,660 --> 00:20:42,830
would have found it last week but

497
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:45,630
there's purpose in it this week -

498
00:20:42,830 --> 00:20:47,430
because perseverance is important every

499
00:20:45,630 --> 00:20:48,900
day every week we're gonna run into

500
00:20:47,430 --> 00:20:51,270
struggles we're gonna run into things

501
00:20:48,900 --> 00:20:52,830
and you know I'm a positive person I

502
00:20:51,270 --> 00:20:56,970
don't mention that because life sucks

503
00:20:52,830 --> 00:20:58,770
it's not that it's that there's just

504
00:20:56,970 --> 00:21:01,940
there's we're not promised anything

505
00:20:58,770 --> 00:21:04,800
perfect we're not promised you know

506
00:21:01,940 --> 00:21:07,560
clicking our heels are going to occur

507
00:21:04,800 --> 00:21:10,110
every day it's what we make it though

508
00:21:07,560 --> 00:21:12,530
and being able to persevere through our

509
00:21:10,110 --> 00:21:15,330
struggles and anything and in learning

510
00:21:12,530 --> 00:21:16,770
persevere through making jelly when it

511
00:21:15,330 --> 00:21:18,900
doesn't turn out right the first time

512
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:21,390
you know some my first batches of jelly

513
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:24,630
ended up being syrup not jelly and that

514
00:21:21,390 --> 00:21:26,670
was with elderberries so you know it's

515
00:21:24,630 --> 00:21:28,530
gonna happen to all of us you know I'm

516
00:21:26,670 --> 00:21:30,330
no different than you are we make

517
00:21:28,530 --> 00:21:32,820
mistakes too or things don't always go

518
00:21:30,330 --> 00:21:34,740
the way we want them to go you know we

519
00:21:32,820 --> 00:21:36,540
might be skinning an animal and want to

520
00:21:34,740 --> 00:21:38,400
use the hide and accidentally slip and

521
00:21:36,540 --> 00:21:40,110
put a hole on it I mean we're no

522
00:21:38,400 --> 00:21:42,120
different than you guys stuff happens

523
00:21:40,110 --> 00:21:43,860
and you know I was a little bit

524
00:21:42,120 --> 00:21:46,320
disappointed when I pulled my jelly up

525
00:21:43,860 --> 00:21:48,660
the morning after because I'm holding it

526
00:21:46,320 --> 00:21:50,760
too high sorry it didn't look like it's

527
00:21:48,660 --> 00:21:55,440
set right but it actually set wonderful

528
00:21:50,760 --> 00:21:57,990
Pomona's pectin is awesome but you got a

529
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,180
try and you got a persevere through the

530
00:21:57,990 --> 00:22:03,630
hiccups used on the stepping stones and

531
00:22:00,180 --> 00:22:05,880
keep going but in Hebrews 10 34 through

532
00:22:03,630 --> 00:22:07,620
36 it says you suffered along with those

533
00:22:05,880 --> 00:22:10,560
who were thrown into jail and when you

534
00:22:07,620 --> 00:22:12,720
when all you owned was taken from you

535
00:22:10,560 --> 00:22:14,370
you accepted it with joy you knew there

536
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:16,290
were better things waiting for you that

537
00:22:14,370 --> 00:22:18,090
will last forever so do not throw away

538
00:22:16,290 --> 00:22:20,240
this confident trust in the Lord

539
00:22:18,090 --> 00:22:23,070
remember the great reward it brings you

540
00:22:20,240 --> 00:22:24,840
patient endurance is what you need now

541
00:22:23,070 --> 00:22:26,880
so that you will continue to do God's

542
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:30,300
will then you will receive all that he

543
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:33,450
has promised and guys you know I hold

544
00:22:30,300 --> 00:22:37,040
true to this stuff and I lean on this

545
00:22:33,450 --> 00:22:39,650
and this is my my life

546
00:22:37,040 --> 00:22:41,180
it's my strength and I just thought it

547
00:22:39,650 --> 00:22:42,770
was kind of interesting that I read that

548
00:22:41,180 --> 00:22:45,500
this morning after sharing with you what

549
00:22:42,770 --> 00:22:49,490
I did last week and her the week before

550
00:22:45,500 --> 00:22:51,440
I guess it was and uh it's just one of

551
00:22:49,490 --> 00:22:53,690
those things you know we're walking

552
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:56,390
through a valley we could very well lose

553
00:22:53,690 --> 00:23:00,080
everything but it's on material things

554
00:22:56,390 --> 00:23:03,920
and it's how you view life

555
00:23:00,080 --> 00:23:07,910
I am so rich in the relationships that I

556
00:23:03,920 --> 00:23:09,710
have in the life that I live that the

557
00:23:07,910 --> 00:23:12,160
material things around me really are

558
00:23:09,710 --> 00:23:16,550
meaningless they help me through my day

559
00:23:12,160 --> 00:23:19,160
but they're not what I hold on to for

560
00:23:16,550 --> 00:23:24,080
for anything it's just material things

561
00:23:19,160 --> 00:23:27,290
so that's just a really excessive view

562
00:23:24,080 --> 00:23:30,050
of perseverance but it's all how you

563
00:23:27,290 --> 00:23:32,570
view it it's all how you view life and I

564
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:35,030
know many of you get afraid to try the

565
00:23:32,570 --> 00:23:38,270
new things and you see us showing you

566
00:23:35,030 --> 00:23:40,580
how to do it in and and you know we've

567
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:42,560
we've perfected it we've done it and it

568
00:23:40,580 --> 00:23:44,450
may intimidate you but I don't want you

569
00:23:42,560 --> 00:23:45,980
to be intimidated I want you to also

570
00:23:44,450 --> 00:23:48,110
realize that we're human and make

571
00:23:45,980 --> 00:23:50,810
mistakes too and there's no reason why

572
00:23:48,110 --> 00:23:52,070
you can't do this as well so don't miss

573
00:23:50,810 --> 00:23:54,470
out on the free trainings that are

574
00:23:52,070 --> 00:23:56,120
available to you sometimes it can be

575
00:23:54,470 --> 00:23:58,100
hard to cram things into our already

576
00:23:56,120 --> 00:24:00,110
tight schedule so I do get that because

577
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,210
I sometimes would like to participate in

578
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:04,400
the summits and watch them and I don't

579
00:24:02,210 --> 00:24:06,020
have the time but there are options to

580
00:24:04,400 --> 00:24:08,420
buy them if that's something that you

581
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:09,860
are able to do but don't miss out on

582
00:24:08,420 --> 00:24:11,900
what you can like I said if you only

583
00:24:09,860 --> 00:24:14,060
have a limited time figure out what the

584
00:24:11,900 --> 00:24:18,020
courses are that will best benefit you

585
00:24:14,060 --> 00:24:20,360
at this time Tami says our gelée didn't

586
00:24:18,020 --> 00:24:22,580
set became pancake syrup yep you just

587
00:24:20,360 --> 00:24:24,230
you roll with it it's still usable and

588
00:24:22,580 --> 00:24:26,290
you know what if it doesn't become

589
00:24:24,230 --> 00:24:31,220
pancake syrup it ends up in my meats

590
00:24:26,290 --> 00:24:35,540
jellies and preserves jams the sweet

591
00:24:31,220 --> 00:24:39,020
stuff is so amazing in in fried up meats

592
00:24:35,540 --> 00:24:41,900
I you tools and onions a lot of times

593
00:24:39,020 --> 00:24:43,910
I'll just slice up an apple and put it

594
00:24:41,900 --> 00:24:45,920
in with my meats and and different

595
00:24:43,910 --> 00:24:48,080
fruits pears go really good too I've

596
00:24:45,920 --> 00:24:49,020
used my pear jellies and meats too but

597
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,250
um

598
00:24:49,020 --> 00:24:52,500
the next thing I'll be making is hot

599
00:24:50,250 --> 00:24:54,179
pepper jelly I absolutely love that on a

600
00:24:52,500 --> 00:24:56,640
bagel with really good organic cream

601
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:59,970
cheese I will have to be making bagels

602
00:24:56,640 --> 00:25:02,610
out of coconut and almond flour but I'm

603
00:24:59,970 --> 00:25:04,080
sure it'll work well I have made bagels

604
00:25:02,610 --> 00:25:06,059
already and they're really good so I

605
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:07,860
just haven't made him in a while but

606
00:25:06,059 --> 00:25:10,260
don't miss out guys don't miss out

607
00:25:07,860 --> 00:25:11,880
because you feel you don't fit the mold

608
00:25:10,260 --> 00:25:14,150
you know last when I was talking about

609
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:18,300
the perseverance I was talking about

610
00:25:14,150 --> 00:25:20,850
comparing yourself and and I think a lot

611
00:25:18,300 --> 00:25:22,860
of people compare themselves to others

612
00:25:20,850 --> 00:25:24,420
and question their abilities don't

613
00:25:22,860 --> 00:25:26,610
question your abilities and don't

614
00:25:24,420 --> 00:25:29,760
compare yourself because it'll hold you

615
00:25:26,610 --> 00:25:31,980
back yep my strawberry jam syrup is

616
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:34,470
natural waffles or pound cake topping

617
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:36,390
cheesecake topping - there you go

618
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:40,800
you'd make lively bring that over to my

619
00:25:36,390 --> 00:25:43,500
house along with your cheesecake but

620
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,110
this stuff is usable it's not like it's

621
00:25:43,500 --> 00:25:48,690
trashed it's not like it's not used you

622
00:25:46,110 --> 00:25:50,910
know yes it's useless now you gotta even

623
00:25:48,690 --> 00:25:53,420
even when you make a dish sometimes I'll

624
00:25:50,910 --> 00:25:56,580
make something good morning Tiffany and

625
00:25:53,420 --> 00:25:58,080
it may not turn out the way I want it to

626
00:25:56,580 --> 00:26:00,170
but the next night I'll use it in

627
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:02,970
leftovers and it's absolutely amazing

628
00:26:00,170 --> 00:26:04,770
you know it's just I never waste

629
00:26:02,970 --> 00:26:07,470
anything nothing gets thrown away and

630
00:26:04,770 --> 00:26:09,750
even our scraps go to the chickens some

631
00:26:07,470 --> 00:26:17,010
of the scraps go to the dogs but you

632
00:26:09,750 --> 00:26:19,950
know perfect well set a date but don't

633
00:26:17,010 --> 00:26:22,380
waste anything and don't don't be upset

634
00:26:19,950 --> 00:26:25,220
with your mistakes because in my opinion

635
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:27,059
that's not a mistake you just you just

636
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:28,500
flipped it and used it a little

637
00:26:27,059 --> 00:26:33,120
differently than you initially intended

638
00:26:28,500 --> 00:26:36,540
right now I just want to encourage you

639
00:26:33,120 --> 00:26:38,220
guys to also you know take advantage of

640
00:26:36,540 --> 00:26:41,309
what's around you like I said earlier

641
00:26:38,220 --> 00:26:43,110
with my dandelion jelly you know that's

642
00:26:41,309 --> 00:26:45,179
something that most people consider is a

643
00:26:43,110 --> 00:26:47,250
weed and I'll tell you what the

644
00:26:45,179 --> 00:26:49,309
dandelion jelly tastes like honey so it

645
00:26:47,250 --> 00:26:51,870
is our number two honey in the house and

646
00:26:49,309 --> 00:26:53,550
honestly I can't believe I haven't been

647
00:26:51,870 --> 00:26:58,590
making it all these years I have been

648
00:26:53,550 --> 00:27:01,050
actually utilizing the dandelion to dry

649
00:26:58,590 --> 00:27:02,400
for my teas and the roots for my teas

650
00:27:01,050 --> 00:27:05,310
and sometimes for coffee

651
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:09,630
I just wasn't making the jelly and what

652
00:27:05,310 --> 00:27:11,220
a mistake I've been making so anyway I'm

653
00:27:09,630 --> 00:27:13,410
gonna wrap this up by just saying a

654
00:27:11,220 --> 00:27:16,950
prayer for you guys I do this every week
