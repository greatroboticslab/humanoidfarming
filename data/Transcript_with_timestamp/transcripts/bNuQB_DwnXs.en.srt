1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,560
okay i wanted to provide an update for

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,600
the strawberry varieties

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:10,800
for the state strawberry is probably the

4
00:00:07,600 --> 00:00:14,480
the second most popular crop in the

5
00:00:10,800 --> 00:00:18,160
state uh second to peaches

6
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:18,640
but uh and there has been increased

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:20,560
interest

8
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
in production of strawberries but for a

9
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:25,439
variety of reasons

10
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:28,240
um we've there's been some a bit of

11
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,279
uh hesitancy amongst the growers for one

12
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,439
it's

13
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:32,640
cited as being too difficult or

14
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,520
expensive

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:36,719
and uh you know in having made all of

16
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:38,640
the investment

17
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:40,719
uh there still may not uh be the

18
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:44,079
production of a of a

19
00:00:40,719 --> 00:00:47,200
of a uh crop in order to make a profit

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,399
so as we know the

21
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:55,120
most the the best way to ensure

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:55,120
a viable crop is to plant

23
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,960
just to plant the varieties that are

24
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:00,640
well adapted

25
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:02,640
first of all to use crops that are well

26
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:04,159
adapted and varieties or cultivars

27
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:06,159
within that crop

28
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,680
that are well adapted to the area so

29
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:09,600
there's there's great need in

30
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:12,720
technological advancements

31
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:14,880
and variety selection variety

32
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,840
development be that strawberry or

33
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:20,479
regards of the crop that you're growing

34
00:01:17,840 --> 00:01:22,640
and there are few with document with the

35
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,840
documented adaptability to our area

36
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:26,320
camaros is the big variety that we have

37
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:29,360
is

38
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:32,000
it has global adaptability um but

39
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,600
uh but there are it does have its issues

40
00:01:32,000 --> 00:01:37,040
there is just a need for

41
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:39,119
other varieties and um varieties

42
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:40,079
are the most one of the most important

43
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:44,240
decisions that

44
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:47,119
you're going to make in variety in

45
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:47,119
crop production

46
00:01:47,759 --> 00:01:52,079
so the objective of this study and all

47
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,680
of our variety trials is to improve

48
00:01:52,079 --> 00:01:55,759
strawberry production

49
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,680
by introducing new better adapted

50
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:00,000
strawberry varieties

51
00:01:57,680 --> 00:02:01,200
to improve the especially crop market in

52
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:03,840
the state

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:06,000
and i want to start off by providing a

54
00:02:03,840 --> 00:02:07,119
list of the varieties we looked at 12

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
varieties

56
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:13,360
this trial has been going on um

57
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:15,200
for about five years not not with all of

58
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:18,080
the same varieties here

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,720
but we have our albion which is a day

60
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,360
neutrals

61
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,879
only day neutral in the trial this year

62
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,640
again camarosa

63
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:30,480
developed by uc davis and our

64
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:33,040
and camino real which is a variety that

65
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:34,080
growers are becoming familiar with this

66
00:02:33,040 --> 00:02:36,319
year because

67
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:37,760
camarosa wasn't available camarosa is

68
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:40,000
our market standard

69
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,160
uh it wasn't uh is available this year

70
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:45,680
so many growers had to

71
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:47,360
uh depend on camino real and um

72
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:49,120
i will talk about how it's done in

73
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,239
chandler our other variety

74
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:55,599
our other our former

75
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:57,440
market standard and you can see some of

76
00:02:55,599 --> 00:02:59,440
the others uh one i wanted to mention

77
00:02:57,440 --> 00:03:01,280
rocco and liz those are two that were

78
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:04,319
developed by nc state

79
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:05,280
um great uh glad to have those in again

80
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,000
this year

81
00:03:05,280 --> 00:03:08,800
uh just to give you an idea of what we

82
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:11,280
did

83
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,440
we experimental plots that we had they

84
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,720
were all replicated

85
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:20,720
four times and uh each experimental

86
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:23,920
experimental plot was about 20 feet long

87
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,959
and that contained about 34 plants

88
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:30,879
per plot which resulted in a

89
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:34,080
in a per acre plant number of about

90
00:03:30,879 --> 00:03:35,280
over 12 000 and we planted these on the

91
00:03:34,080 --> 00:03:38,400
23rd

92
00:03:35,280 --> 00:03:41,519
of october and of last year and

93
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,400
planted on double staggered rose and

94
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:45,440
again

95
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:47,920
23 12 000 plants per acre

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:48,640
randomized complete block design you can

97
00:03:47,920 --> 00:03:51,760
see our

98
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,080
our double staggered row uh hole puncher

99
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:55,680
hole punching wheel there they also as

100
00:03:54,080 --> 00:03:56,799
the holes are being punched into the

101
00:03:55,680 --> 00:03:59,680
plastic

102
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,879
there's also some water with a little

103
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:04,080
bit of

104
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,599
fertilizer entering the planting hole as

105
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,000
well

106
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:09,360
we harvested this year we harvested

107
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:13,120
between

108
00:04:09,360 --> 00:04:14,799
april 7th and may 18th we harvested 12

109
00:04:13,120 --> 00:04:18,239
times

110
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:21,120
we did use row covers back prior to the

111
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:24,080
event our freeze event in february 15th

112
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:27,120
and those covers remained on the

113
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:30,160
strawberries for about two weeks and

114
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,759
uh this is you here are results

115
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
uh this is looking at the total

116
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:36,720
marketable yield

117
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,840
uh per acre for our our strawberries and

118
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:41,120
as you can see

119
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,520
uh camarosa as we would expect is still

120
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,639
up towards the top but we have a new

121
00:04:43,520 --> 00:04:48,080
variety

122
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:50,320
at least new to us fronteras

123
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:51,199
it's a variety that was produced by uc

124
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:54,560
davis and

125
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:56,400
it was did pretty well this year and i

126
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:58,639
i would like to be able to include in

127
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:01,039
our trials next year

128
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,479
and again our camp camino real the

129
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:04,320
variety that

130
00:05:02,479 --> 00:05:06,400
a number of our growers had to depend on

131
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,400
this year uh did

132
00:05:06,400 --> 00:05:09,520
did quite well it was very comparable to

133
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:13,360
camarosa

134
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:16,400
as in previous years

135
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:17,440
but we look at the rocco the rock the

136
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,400
yield of rocco

137
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:22,080
is it's it's a little bit diminished

138
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:24,160
when compared to the others

139
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:25,919
but rocco was bred to be an early

140
00:05:24,160 --> 00:05:28,960
variety and it is

141
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:30,240
uh uh it was meant to be a replacement

142
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:33,759
for sweet charlie

143
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:34,320
and uh it it it does uh does quite well

144
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,280
it it

145
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:39,120
has the the production of something

146
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:42,000
that's on par with camarosa for that

147
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:44,160
time of the season

148
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:45,199
and another important variable we looked

149
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:47,280
at is the

150
00:05:45,199 --> 00:05:49,360
uh individual berry weight as you can

151
00:05:47,280 --> 00:05:50,400
see fronteras again it was the number

152
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,600
one

153
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,560
yielder and uh fronteras was the largest

154
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:58,479
berry

155
00:05:54,560 --> 00:06:01,360
uh the mean size of the berry was at 20

156
00:05:58,479 --> 00:06:02,400
little over 27 almost 27 and a half

157
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:04,240
grams

158
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:05,759
per berry and uh that's a that's a

159
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,880
pretty large berry and that's not the

160
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:09,280
largest berry

161
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:10,080
of course we had some large it ranged

162
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,120
from

163
00:06:10,080 --> 00:06:16,400
a little bit over uh 30 grams uh

164
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:18,840
maybe 33 grams i think

165
00:06:16,400 --> 00:06:20,880
some of the larger berries that we saw

166
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,000
there

167
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,560
and then we can we notice our our market

168
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,680
standard

169
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:31,039
camarosa at 21.5 grams

170
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:33,280
now followed by camino real at 19.8 on

171
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:36,000
roughly almost 20 grams

172
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:38,160
for fruit and i was a little bit uh a

173
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,600
little bit

174
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:42,000
surprised that uh camino real came in at

175
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:45,600
that

176
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:47,600
uh at that size because early on it

177
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:48,400
looked it appeared that camino real was

178
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,800
producing

179
00:06:48,400 --> 00:06:52,400
some pretty large berries consistently

180
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:55,280
so

181
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,880
but the the data doesn't lie so there

182
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:59,919
you have it

183
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:02,240
um but uh out of all of those varieties

184
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:05,440
what i wanted to do is focus on

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:08,000
on our overall top performers and that's

186
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,520
again our market standard camino

187
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:12,880
camarosa

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:14,160
and camino real which is gaining in

189
00:07:12,880 --> 00:07:17,520
popularity

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:19,680
and fronteras and i didn't mention ruby

191
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,400
june that's another variety that a lot

192
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:23,759
of growers

193
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:26,319
uh are are interested in uh it's been my

194
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:28,240
opinion that uh you know a number of the

195
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:31,360
growers either love ruby june or

196
00:07:28,240 --> 00:07:32,560
or hate it and but i think it is growing

197
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:34,400
in popularity

198
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:37,680
uh i don't have it pictured here but

199
00:07:34,400 --> 00:07:37,680
we'll discuss that after

200
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,800
and just wanted to have this graph here

201
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,840
really just to show you uh what happened

202
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:49,280
during the season

203
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:52,639
and uh you know where were these yields

204
00:07:49,280 --> 00:07:53,280
you know in um according to the weeks of

205
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:56,639
harvest

206
00:07:53,280 --> 00:07:58,479
and so you can see we had a or at least

207
00:07:56,639 --> 00:07:59,599
we were it appeared that we were coming

208
00:07:58,479 --> 00:08:03,919
off of a peak

209
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:07,039
uh uh at the our first harvest april 7th

210
00:08:03,919 --> 00:08:10,479
um and we

211
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:12,080
and it's really odd this year because we

212
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:14,400
had a we had a really

213
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,840
big start and we never really recovered

214
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,560
in our trials

215
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:19,680
uh we did have a peak another peak as

216
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:24,319
you can see

217
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:26,879
uh we so after that harvest we had a

218
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:28,240
uh just a really pretty significant

219
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:31,199
decline

220
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:33,440
and all of the varieties perform that

221
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:36,959
trended that way and you can see the

222
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:40,640
um the dotted line here is our

223
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:43,039
average average yield for across all

224
00:08:40,640 --> 00:08:43,039
berries

225
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:49,519
and um camino real and the gray

226
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,000
and i hope you can see these these these

227
00:08:49,519 --> 00:08:55,200
colors here these lines but

228
00:08:52,000 --> 00:08:58,560
and fronteras and uh

229
00:08:55,200 --> 00:09:01,680
camino ria camarosa you can see camarosa

230
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,440
appears to be a little bit earlier than

231
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,959
fronteras

232
00:09:03,440 --> 00:09:09,360
and uh and it's comparable to fronteras

233
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:14,160
in marketable yield

234
00:09:09,360 --> 00:09:17,040
and again camille riyal it is

235
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:18,800
more similar i i'd suppose to camerosa

236
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:23,360
in terms of

237
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:25,440
of earliness

238
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:27,200
and i also wanted to take a look at what

239
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:30,640
was going on during the week

240
00:09:27,200 --> 00:09:31,600
as we as is pretty common or pretty

241
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:33,680
typical

242
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:34,959
is that we start off with some big

243
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
berries and

244
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:38,959
as the season progresses we the berries

245
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,120
start to tend

246
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,080
uh towards the smaller berries and

247
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:44,320
that's because we

248
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:45,440
when we start our primary flowers when

249
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:47,760
we begin

250
00:09:45,440 --> 00:09:51,120
those are larger flowers and so larger

251
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,320
flowers typically mean a larger berry

252
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:54,800
and we can see that the berries started

253
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:57,440
off

254
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:58,240
here and we did actually see somewhat of

255
00:09:57,440 --> 00:10:01,440
a peak

256
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:01,760
in the berry size but it did again it

257
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,720
did

258
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,440
start to trend down to smaller berries

259
00:10:04,720 --> 00:10:07,760
as we

260
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,399
as we approach the end of our our

261
00:10:07,760 --> 00:10:10,399
harvests

262
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:18,240
so i wanted to focus on specific

263
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,959
varieties and this is fronteras

264
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,160
it produces really large berries conical

265
00:10:20,959 --> 00:10:24,640
shaped berries

266
00:10:22,160 --> 00:10:26,800
uh the largest berry that we had as i

267
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:30,560
mentioned was about 32 grams

268
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:34,480
uh the the uh the maturity

269
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,880
is a little bit later than camarosa

270
00:10:34,480 --> 00:10:40,320
the plant size in in terms of the plant

271
00:10:36,880 --> 00:10:43,279
the plant is similar in size to camarosa

272
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:45,360
uh the camarosa does have a it's a large

273
00:10:43,279 --> 00:10:47,839
plant

274
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,800
and the berries the berries sort of had

275
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,839
a

276
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:55,360
uh almost for lack of a better word

277
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,680
that the the the color of the redness

278
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,680
was

279
00:10:55,680 --> 00:10:59,680
almost it tended to be a little bit

280
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:02,640
fluorescent red it was uh

281
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,360
just a kind of an extra brilliant red it

282
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,800
can't really

283
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:06,800
it wasn't really captured in this

284
00:11:04,800 --> 00:11:09,279
picture right here uh but we

285
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:10,640
you really see it in the uh you really

286
00:11:09,279 --> 00:11:12,720
see it in the field

287
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:13,920
uh it is a sweet berries it was a pretty

288
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:16,160
pleasant berry

289
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:20,640
pretty taste a pretty pleasant tasting

290
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:20,640
berry uh it had a little bit of tartness

291
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:25,920
now moving on to camino riyal the

292
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:26,880
variety that the growers had to depend

293
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:31,040
on this year

294
00:11:26,880 --> 00:11:31,440
uh and the uh out of all the growers i

295
00:11:31,040 --> 00:11:35,120
think

296
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:36,320
one was not completely satisfied with

297
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:38,480
camino real

298
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:40,000
i've heard after that other than that

299
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:42,320
i've heard nothing but good things about

300
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:43,600
the variety it is a large it produces a

301
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:46,800
large berry

302
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:48,640
typically and that kind of probably

303
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:51,680
seems to suggest to me that

304
00:11:48,640 --> 00:11:53,360
uh what we were seeing in the field and

305
00:11:51,680 --> 00:11:55,120
the numbers that we're actually getting

306
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,600
for the berry size

307
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:59,040
uh that may suggest that we have quite a

308
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,600
bit of variability in the

309
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:02,480
in the and the very individual berry

310
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:06,160
size

311
00:12:02,480 --> 00:12:08,240
uh but so as i mentioned it really seems

312
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,279
to in the field that really seemed to

313
00:12:08,240 --> 00:12:14,800
produce some

314
00:12:11,279 --> 00:12:17,279
fairly large berries consistently

315
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:20,079
and it is a berry that is similar

316
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:20,079
camarosa

317
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:27,040
and uh you know it was favorable to most

318
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:28,480
growers and it has a pretty a fairly

319
00:12:27,040 --> 00:12:33,279
pleasant taste one of the

320
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:35,440
the downsides of this berry is that uh

321
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,800
and the growers really didn't point this

322
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:39,040
out that they they were

323
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:40,480
quite pleased with it but it has a

324
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:42,560
reputation for

325
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,880
not being quite as flavorful not being

326
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:47,360
quite as sweet as some of the others

327
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,160
but we found that you can improve uh

328
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:51,200
that if

329
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:52,800
the berries are are harvested when

330
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:56,639
they're uh really red

331
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:59,360
but uh you know this is it's not very

332
00:12:56,639 --> 00:13:00,800
pretty not a simple thing to do really

333
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:02,320
when you're in the field especially in a

334
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:04,240
you pick operation

335
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,920
uh when customers are you know they're

336
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,959
finding red berries and they and they

337
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:08,959
picked them

338
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,480
but if this berry is left on the plant a

339
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:13,200
little bit longer you can

340
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:14,399
improve on the sweetness and the flavor

341
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:17,680
of the berry

342
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:20,880
uh that brings us to camarosa it had a

343
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:24,880
maximum berry size of a 22

344
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:28,240
and a half uh it was the

345
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:31,920
top yielder again this year

346
00:13:28,240 --> 00:13:35,120
and it has a pretty an excellent flavor

347
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:37,920
it's if you can match it there are

348
00:13:35,120 --> 00:13:39,360
some in the trials that have surpassed i

349
00:13:37,920 --> 00:13:42,000
think camarosa

350
00:13:39,360 --> 00:13:42,800
in flavor but it does have an excellent

351
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:45,839
flavor

352
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:47,519
and it is a excellent yielder a fairly

353
00:13:45,839 --> 00:13:49,680
consistent yielder

354
00:13:47,519 --> 00:13:51,199
it's usually in the tops every year and

355
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:52,399
that's that's why it's the market

356
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:55,600
standard

357
00:13:52,399 --> 00:13:58,560
and the the added variety i

358
00:13:55,600 --> 00:13:58,959
wanted to talk about was ruby june it

359
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,360
was

360
00:13:58,959 --> 00:14:02,000
a variety of much discussion early on as

361
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:04,000
i said

362
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:05,040
at least early on a lot of the growers

363
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:07,680
they either

364
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:09,440
loved it or they hated it we think that

365
00:14:07,680 --> 00:14:12,560
there's probably something to do

366
00:14:09,440 --> 00:14:16,560
with uh fertility so varieties

367
00:14:12,560 --> 00:14:19,839
vary in terms of

368
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
of their nutrient uh requirements

369
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,160
particularly

370
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:26,399
nitrogen and so these might be a higher

371
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:27,360
feeder or it may not require as much

372
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,440
nitrogen

373
00:14:27,360 --> 00:14:32,079
under but there there is developing

374
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:35,760
information out there on varieties

375
00:14:32,079 --> 00:14:39,920
and their um their nutrient requirements

376
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:43,279
this is a variety bred by lesson canyon

377
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:46,079
and this is uh i mean it is

378
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:48,320
i i think it's a fairly good variety it

379
00:14:46,079 --> 00:14:49,279
is slightly earlier than camaros in our

380
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:51,600
trials

381
00:14:49,279 --> 00:14:52,399
and one thing about this berries uh the

382
00:14:51,600 --> 00:14:56,000
plant at least

383
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:57,600
it's a medium-sized plant but the

384
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:59,279
it has a tendency to produce these

385
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:02,079

387
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:06,240
that

388
00:15:02,480 --> 00:15:06,880

00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:10,560
