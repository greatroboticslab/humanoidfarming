  "text": "hey we're at the home of one of our sprinkler warehouse customers today we're making this instructional video for you on how to install a sprinkler system where every valve every sprinkler head and the controller are supplied by our good friends at Rain Bird sprinkler warehouse doesn't do installs we just sell apart i'm adrian sanchez your sprinkler warehouse pro let's get started [Music] the first task is to flag the location of each sprinkler valve according to the sprinkler system design using different colored flags for each zone will help simplify the installation marking spray will show the exact location of where to dig the trenches after turning off the water supply dig up the main water line near the water meter the reason we're next to the water meter is we want the most amount of volume and water pressure to feed our sprinkler system so here we are at where we've split off our main line into our irrigation line it is a one-inch pipe with a ball valve now the ball valve is there so we can turn off water to our irrigation system while maintaining water flow to the rest of the home we also got this valve box that goes over our ball valve and once we fill it in with dirt and we need to work on it later we'll be able to loop the lid right here and get in and turn off our water without having to mess around with digging it all out trenching is the most time-consuming and physically demanding part of this job do-it-yourselfers you're gonna want to get several friends to help you dig so there's a backflow prevention device this is a pressure vacuum breaker or a PV B now most cities or water districts require some kind of effective prevention device when you're installing sprinkler systems because it keeps contaminated water from flowing back into your drinking water source so whether use an anti siphon or pressure vacuum breaker we recommend some kind of backhoe prevention all right so now that we've installed our ball valve and our mainline we can turn the water onto the rest of the home as you can see the roots on this property posed pretty significant challenge so what we did is removed one the way of our valve wire make sure to use schedule 40 PVC pipes between the pointed connection and the inlet set of valves alright this is a premium manifold kit from sprinkler warehouse attached to our valves here we're using that in our in our irrigation system for this home now for this as opposed to hard piping it in this is much faster and easier to replace and to install take it in now you do move in the premium kit right there but if you need to replace the valves it's as easy as this you dig it up you unscrew it you pop out one valve bring in another valve that is a lot quicker than having to glue and to cut this entire thing apart in back together if you're trying to replace your valves or even just installing them just screw it on and you're good to go after the valves because there's a lot less water pressure it's safe to use class 200 pipe to feed the sprinkler heads and that can save you a little bit of money to run the pipe under the driveway we recommend using a water-powered boring kit that we have a sprinkler warehouse what you do is you put a high-pressure nozzle in the end of your class 200 pipe and you slowly push it in there and the water pressure pushes the dirt all the way creating a tunnel for the pipe to go through and then just connect that to the rest of your system so if you were to have your sprinkler head attached to an old-school nipple riser like this and never get run over by a vehicle or a really heavy riding lawnmower you would probably break your nipple riser possibly break your sprinkler head and even worse break your PVC pipe this swing joint right here completely prevents that as it's flexible and it can move at the joints and it also makes it easier for adjusting the height of your sprinkler head just in case the grass clippings were to change the height of the ground right there you just dig it up put a little dirt underneath it and swing it up a little bit and adjust at the joints here we are with our our wire this is direct burial wire which means we do not have to run a conduit in order to bury this underground we got three red wires right here for our three valves right over there we have some obstacles in addition to everything else here in this yard and I'm standing on this sidewalk right here is actually a big obstacle for our wires and our piping we've gone underneath it right here with a conduit and some water pipe as well and we're gonna run our red wires and one common wire through this one piece of PVC pipe to our valves and all the way around to the backyard and to our controller that's inside the garage so this right here there's a little coil now what this does is as it adds a little bit of a extra protection against power surges boom coil and you do that to all of them in order to avoid electrical shorts when connecting the direct burial are to the valve wires make sure to use waterproof silicone filled wire connectors so you want to overfill your trenches when you're filling them back in otherwise when the soil gets wet and begins to settle it'll sink down a little bit you want to tamp it down to get a nice and compact that way you don't leave any signs of trenches in your yard so facing the bed a crush rock under your valves can help with drainage and provide a nice solid foundation in case anything heavy ever rolls over on top of it so here I am at the eave the house installing this rain sensor we want this to be above where the sprinklers are going to be spraying because we obviously don't want water to get into here otherwise it's going to turn off her controller now in order to protect your wires from damage you don't want to run it through some PVC conduit from where it comes out of the ground all the way to your smart control next we'll flush the cyst and open the test on the backflow device leave the air and make sure to turn the water on very slowly at the backflow preventer to avoid any pipeline damage alright now we got all the wires running to our controller we have our rain sensor wire right here we're gonna hook that up we got our common wire we're gonna hook that up as well we're gonna turn the power onto this thing and then what we're gonna do is we're gonna strip the red wires one by one and we're gonna touch them to a powered terminal what that's gonna do is gonna start to isolate which wire goes to which zone because we don't know which wire goes to which zone at this point so if we turn on terminal number one and start touching a wire to it what was gonna happen is it's gonna turn on one of the zones in our yard so let's just say it turns on zone number five then we know that that wire goes to zone 5 so we'll count 1 2 3 4 5 and we'll connect it to zone 5 over here and we'll strip another wire touch it to the power terminal and go on down the line until we know which wire goes to which zone and then we connected to that corresponding zone [Music] Rainbird is applied all the sprinklers for this install today we're using Rain Bird variable arc rotary or our vans and a chi or high-efficiency van spray nozzles now they all come in a variety of throw distances so here we got the Rain Bird our van adjustable rotary nozzle these are the our van 14s 18 and 24 those numbers indicate how far these actual nozzles can throw water so the 24 is gonna shoot 24 feet the ATS gonna shoot up to 18 feet and the 14 up to 14 feet and you can adjust it down if you only need to throw it a little bit less than that all right I just installed the H evant n now that's a spray novel that shoots up to ten feet and can cover an entire 360 degree plane but it's adjustable down to the angle that you need we're in the center of a flower bed here so we're gonna go full 360 and it's not quite ten feet wide so we're gonna do maybe about six or seven foot on this alright so here I am in front of two nozzles that are right next to each other now why would we need two nozzles right next to each other we're gonna want to water our flower bed every day except for the days when the yard goes off when the yard is being watered that's gonna cover the flower bed as well and we're not gonna need to have this one running so we're gonna use our controller to program it to make sure we get exactly the kind of water we need so let's take a look at this achieve an eight right here now H E stands for high efficiency this one is 12 inches high that way we can go over our flowers and cover our entire flower beds and then over here we're gonna put the arvan eighteen in and that is gonna shoot at 18 feet cover both the flower bed and the rest of the yard all the grass and everything - lets get that on here just unscrew stick that in there there we go get that on there and that's how that goes that's why you have two of them right here alright so now we're gonna adjust these sprinkler heads they might not be pointed in the right direction and they might be so over spraying have a wide angle we're gonna try to make that angle be just right for this flowerbed so first we're gonna adjust it this way the Rain Bird our van and a chi band nozzle spray patterns and distances are easily adjusted by hand without tools the rotating stream technology delivers wind resistant large water droplets without misting or foggy and water usage is reduced by about 33 percent that is money in your pocket
