1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,589
I'm Doug Hamilton I'm waste management

2
00:00:03,000 --> 00:00:08,160
specialist for the Oklahoma Cooperative

3
00:00:04,589 --> 00:00:10,290
Extension Service and you you may wonder

4
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:11,040
why a guy from Oklahoma is talking about

5
00:00:10,290 --> 00:00:13,440
alligators

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,750
I'll show you we do have alligators in

7
00:00:13,440 --> 00:00:17,520
the wild in the southeast corner of the

8
00:00:15,750 --> 00:00:21,150
state in the marshes along the Red River

9
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:27,080
but we have no alligator production in

10
00:00:21,150 --> 00:00:27,080
Oklahoma oops

11
00:00:27,300 --> 00:00:33,030
but the interesting thing is a lot of

12
00:00:29,099 --> 00:00:35,700
the cultures that developed in alligator

13
00:00:33,030 --> 00:00:39,090
country the Seminole of the Muscogee the

14
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:40,410
trucked all picado now are residents of

15
00:00:39,090 --> 00:00:44,370
the state of Oklahoma

16
00:00:40,410 --> 00:00:46,500
so if Osceola the Seminole national hero

17
00:00:44,370 --> 00:00:48,149
would to see an alligator he would have

18
00:00:46,500 --> 00:00:51,270
called that hook Lata that's how you

19
00:00:48,149 --> 00:00:54,870
pronounce that but why I am while you're

20
00:00:51,270 --> 00:00:57,329
listening to me today is we have a waste

21
00:00:54,870 --> 00:00:59,510
management channel on YouTube where we

22
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:01,800
were looking and we are looking at

23
00:00:59,510 --> 00:01:03,870
different types of waste systems so that

24
00:01:01,800 --> 00:01:06,510
farmers can see virtually before they

25
00:01:03,870 --> 00:01:10,710
get into a particular practice and back

26
00:01:06,510 --> 00:01:14,790
in 2010 we went down to Louisiana dr.

27
00:01:10,710 --> 00:01:17,310
Ron Sheffield was doing some treatment

28
00:01:14,790 --> 00:01:19,350
for alligator wastewater and with his

29
00:01:17,310 --> 00:01:23,270
passing and I guess I've become the de

30
00:01:19,350 --> 00:01:26,820
facto national expert on alligator waste

31
00:01:23,270 --> 00:01:29,040
why do we have farms with alligators

32
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,619
there's a number of products that come

33
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:35,909
from alligators the number one

34
00:01:30,619 --> 00:01:38,340
moneymaker for them is leather they grow

35
00:01:35,909 --> 00:01:41,009
the alligators up to about four feet in

36
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:43,799
length four for leather

37
00:01:41,009 --> 00:01:46,799
the growth of an alligator is really

38
00:01:43,799 --> 00:01:49,259
regulated by temperature so if you have

39
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:52,680
a ninety ninety two degree temperature

40
00:01:49,259 --> 00:01:56,130
they'll get to four foot in about a year

41
00:01:52,680 --> 00:01:58,259
or 12 months they like to raise them

42
00:01:56,130 --> 00:02:01,020
slower so they'll drop the temperature

43
00:01:58,259 --> 00:02:03,659
down to 80 82 degrees and they end up

44
00:02:01,020 --> 00:02:06,810
with a much more beautiful leather and

45
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:10,229
that takes about 16 to 18 months to get

46
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:13,470
up to four feet the second big products

47
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:15,210
are the valley Gators is the meat

48
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:17,790
and when you look at an alligator it's

49
00:02:15,210 --> 00:02:21,720
almost all tail so the tail meat has

50
00:02:17,790 --> 00:02:24,780
used the restaurants county fairs you

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,910
can get fried alligator tail I haven't

52
00:02:24,780 --> 00:02:29,040
seen it in the store probably if I'm in

53
00:02:26,910 --> 00:02:31,650
Florida or Louisiana they have it in the

54
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:33,720
store their number three item is novelty

55
00:02:31,650 --> 00:02:34,890
items you can get keychains with an

56
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:38,430
alligator foot

57
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:40,770
they sell the teeth here we have a head

58
00:02:38,430 --> 00:02:42,720
I can imagine back when I was in college

59
00:02:40,770 --> 00:02:45,930
I could see this in someone's dorm room

60
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:48,050
with an ashtray in the middle of it and

61
00:02:45,930 --> 00:02:50,730
then the fourth thing is tourism

62
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:53,070
there's farms that let you come watch

63
00:02:50,730 --> 00:02:56,850
them feed the alligators instigator

64
00:02:53,070 --> 00:02:58,410
ranch the the place we were filming view

65
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,760
they have a little kiddie pool and you

66
00:02:58,410 --> 00:03:02,130
can play with the alligators they have

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,740
hurt their mouths are taped shut

68
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:08,460
also they let you hold an alligator egg

69
00:03:04,740 --> 00:03:10,740
in your hands while it's hatching the

70
00:03:08,460 --> 00:03:12,900
Nate the alligators themselves are kind

71
00:03:10,740 --> 00:03:16,080
of an interesting Beast I don't think we

72
00:03:12,900 --> 00:03:17,790
have any other confined animals feeding

73
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:20,280
operations that are actually reptiles

74
00:03:17,790 --> 00:03:23,640
there may be some snake farms I don't

75
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:26,670
know but the alligator is interesting

76
00:03:23,640 --> 00:03:28,530
that their Anatomy is more or their

77
00:03:26,670 --> 00:03:32,989
digestive anatomy is more in line with

78
00:03:28,530 --> 00:03:34,950
birds than anything else they have to

79
00:03:32,989 --> 00:03:37,650
parts of their stomach they have a

80
00:03:34,950 --> 00:03:40,770
gizzard somewhat like a chicken they

81
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:43,440
also like chickens and birds they only

82
00:03:40,770 --> 00:03:46,410
they they do not have a urethra so all

83
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:48,510
of their urine mixes with feces and

84
00:03:46,410 --> 00:03:51,450
exits through what they call the cloak

85
00:03:48,510 --> 00:03:55,590
wall which would be the anus in a in a

86
00:03:51,450 --> 00:03:57,959
in a mammal and like birds about 70% of

87
00:03:55,590 --> 00:04:00,620
all the nitrogen excreted by an

88
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:03,150
alligator is in the form of uric acid

89
00:04:00,620 --> 00:04:05,070
the other thing that's kind of different

90
00:04:03,150 --> 00:04:07,769
about alligators than most of our

91
00:04:05,070 --> 00:04:12,870
domestic species is they're an apex

92
00:04:07,769 --> 00:04:15,750
predator so they are fed a very high

93
00:04:12,870 --> 00:04:19,200
protein diet in the wild they eat eat

94
00:04:15,750 --> 00:04:21,510
their food whole but we generally have

95
00:04:19,200 --> 00:04:23,280
some kind of a manufactured feed and

96
00:04:21,510 --> 00:04:26,910
that feed is going to be about 50%

97
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,510
protein comparatively cat food which is

98
00:04:26,910 --> 00:04:32,700
also fairly high protein is about 20% so

99
00:04:30,510 --> 00:04:35,280
if you want to look to analogous animal

100
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:39,930
to an alligator you'd have to look at

101
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:42,810
your apex aqueous apex predators in the

102
00:04:39,930 --> 00:04:44,030
burgh kingdom bald eagles osprey that

103
00:04:42,810 --> 00:04:46,980
sort of thing

104
00:04:44,030 --> 00:04:49,920
now there's two basic ways that the

105
00:04:46,980 --> 00:04:51,900
alligators are raised on farm the first

106
00:04:49,920 --> 00:04:55,350
one is the alligator farm and that's

107
00:04:51,900 --> 00:04:59,280
predominant in Florida some in Georgia

108
00:04:55,350 --> 00:05:00,990
southern Alabama what makes a alligator

109
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,390
farm an alligator farm is all the

110
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:05,010
breeding stock are raised on that farm

111
00:05:03,390 --> 00:05:07,260
they have the mother alligators and I'm

112
00:05:05,010 --> 00:05:10,320
assuming the father alligators and they

113
00:05:07,260 --> 00:05:13,710
lay the eggs and they harvest all of the

114
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:16,380
4-foot or marketable Gators so you could

115
00:05:13,710 --> 00:05:19,410
call that a closed system in the state

116
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,930
of Louisiana it's kind of unique the

117
00:05:19,410 --> 00:05:26,040
Louisiana Department of Wildlife and

118
00:05:21,930 --> 00:05:28,380
Fisheries issues licenses to alligator

119
00:05:26,040 --> 00:05:33,240
ranchers and they go out and collect

120
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:36,360
eggs from the wild and then they

121
00:05:33,240 --> 00:05:40,500
released into 15% of the four-foot

122
00:05:36,360 --> 00:05:44,010
alligators out in the wild the 10 to 15%

123
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:48,990
comes from the fact that in nature only

124
00:05:44,010 --> 00:05:51,210
about 15% at most of the hatchlings are

125
00:05:48,990 --> 00:05:53,970
going to live up to the be 4 foot about

126
00:05:51,210 --> 00:05:56,190
1 year and so you could call that an

127
00:05:53,970 --> 00:05:57,780
open system and that that the animals

128
00:05:56,190 --> 00:06:01,380
are taken from the wild and are returned

129
00:05:57,780 --> 00:06:02,820
to the wild most almost this is the

130
00:06:01,380 --> 00:06:06,120
slight Regina seen our from the

131
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:07,860
instigator ranch almost all of the

132
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,960
alligators raised in the United States

133
00:06:07,860 --> 00:06:12,330
are raised under roof there still may be

134
00:06:09,960 --> 00:06:15,000
a few open systems in Florida but none

135
00:06:12,330 --> 00:06:20,070
of them in Louisiana this particular

136
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:22,080
farm they have three barns and then they

137
00:06:20,070 --> 00:06:25,110
have one long pit in each in each barn

138
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:29,220
at which are separated up into pens very

139
00:06:25,110 --> 00:06:32,310
similar to a slatted floor hog barn for

140
00:06:29,220 --> 00:06:33,750
instance the alligators spend most the

141
00:06:32,310 --> 00:06:35,880
time in the water you see there's a

142
00:06:33,750 --> 00:06:37,830
little ledge here in the corner where

143
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:40,139
they can crawl up on and they also feed

144
00:06:37,830 --> 00:06:42,750
them on that ledge

145
00:06:40,139 --> 00:06:44,580
just like a hog barn that pit is filled

146
00:06:42,750 --> 00:06:48,060
through the pit recharge system they

147
00:06:44,580 --> 00:06:50,520
have a well that fills the pit and then

148
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:51,870
they can pull that the pull plug in the

149
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:53,759
middle and it's going to let all the

150
00:06:51,870 --> 00:06:55,740
water out the entire length of the barn

151
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,919
they get in there with a pressure washer

152
00:06:55,740 --> 00:07:00,979
and wash out all the solids the

153
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:03,720
alligators love that in fact they are

154
00:07:00,979 --> 00:07:05,550
constantly spraying the alligators at

155
00:07:03,720 --> 00:07:08,030
least in the summertime for for heat

156
00:07:05,550 --> 00:07:08,030
control

157
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:13,620
you might ask what an alligator is fed

158
00:07:11,030 --> 00:07:15,629
all of the alligator ranches in

159
00:07:13,620 --> 00:07:18,750
Louisiana have some form of prepared

160
00:07:15,629 --> 00:07:21,530
feed this guy was actually buying his

161
00:07:18,750 --> 00:07:25,530
food from Land O'Lakes Purina they

162
00:07:21,530 --> 00:07:27,539
actually stored a gator child to him one

163
00:07:25,530 --> 00:07:30,389
of the things that the people at least

164
00:07:27,539 --> 00:07:33,000
in Louisiana are very sensitive to you

165
00:07:30,389 --> 00:07:35,280
may have heard of people that started

166
00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:38,789
raising alligators for mortality method

167
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:41,460
for poultry farms those types of people

168
00:07:38,789 --> 00:07:44,340
are fairly ostracized by the alligator

169
00:07:41,460 --> 00:07:47,550
ranching community they like to they

170
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,190
take pride in their product and and the

171
00:07:47,550 --> 00:07:52,289
raising them them for them is a fairly

172
00:07:50,190 --> 00:07:56,190
serious business although they do the

173
00:07:52,289 --> 00:07:58,620
tourism this is what the influent coming

174
00:07:56,190 --> 00:08:01,800
out of those barges looks like the pipe

175
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:04,130
on the left is a pit that had the the

176
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,909
plugs pulled so that's going to be the

177
00:08:04,130 --> 00:08:10,710
the manure and throw from the pit and

178
00:08:08,909 --> 00:08:12,900
the one on the right that's just the

179
00:08:10,710 --> 00:08:16,379
overflow from all those sprinklers in a

180
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:19,919
particular bar this farm used a holding

181
00:08:16,379 --> 00:08:22,979
pond to hold waste and then they

182
00:08:19,919 --> 00:08:25,680
irrigated it onto about a 20 or 25 or 30

183
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:29,190
acre field and they were using the

184
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:33,630
Kaline pods they would pull them out

185
00:08:29,190 --> 00:08:35,959
with a four-wheeler move them around the

186
00:08:33,630 --> 00:08:38,519
one thing you might ask particularly

187
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:40,219
once how did they size that field well

188
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,750
it just happened they had that much land

189
00:08:40,219 --> 00:08:44,430
and if you women and trying to do a

190
00:08:42,750 --> 00:08:46,380
nutrient management plan on an alligator

191
00:08:44,430 --> 00:08:48,899
farm you'd quickly find that there is no

192
00:08:46,380 --> 00:08:51,480
book data on alligator manure and

193
00:08:48,899 --> 00:08:52,649
characteristics in our si si si ve is

194
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:54,980
not going to have that date

195
00:08:52,649 --> 00:09:00,240
anywhere and it's pretty hard to find

196
00:08:54,980 --> 00:09:04,050
even on online or excuse me in referee

197
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:06,839
journal articles we I am working on a

198
00:09:04,050 --> 00:09:10,110
fact sheet that's a companion to this

199
00:09:06,839 --> 00:09:13,319
talk we so what I'm saying is the the

200
00:09:10,110 --> 00:09:16,019
best way to size a facility is to take

201
00:09:13,319 --> 00:09:19,139
samples of the the influent or the

202
00:09:16,019 --> 00:09:21,839
effluent and then get good volume

203
00:09:19,139 --> 00:09:23,670
estimates and try to base it it's

204
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:28,439
probably going to fall on phosphorus

205
00:09:23,670 --> 00:09:31,079
loss heights but we will have some

206
00:09:28,439 --> 00:09:34,860
information out fairly soon giving you

207
00:09:31,079 --> 00:09:37,589
NPK concentrations for that came out of

208
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:42,480
a thesis that Ron Sheffield was working

209
00:09:37,589 --> 00:09:44,490
on Sheffield was there mostly because

210
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,980
the guy was interested in treating

211
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:49,379
further treating that holding pond waste

212
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:52,110
and his number-one concern was odor

213
00:09:49,379 --> 00:09:54,179
control he was in Covington Louisiana

214
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:57,240
which is a suburb of New Orleans right

215
00:09:54,179 --> 00:09:59,850
across Lake Pontchartrain and he had

216
00:09:57,240 --> 00:10:01,079
some pretty high priced houses in his

217
00:09:59,850 --> 00:10:03,509
neighborhood so he's interested in

218
00:10:01,079 --> 00:10:06,360
controlling an older that's basically

219
00:10:03,509 --> 00:10:08,579
reducing your organic matter and also

220
00:10:06,360 --> 00:10:10,559
transferring and solid nutrients to the

221
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:12,889
solid phase so if you wanted to go

222
00:10:10,559 --> 00:10:16,230
transported further he could do that

223
00:10:12,889 --> 00:10:18,629
some treatment system with potential for

224
00:10:16,230 --> 00:10:20,910
alligator waste where the first comes to

225
00:10:18,629 --> 00:10:23,339
mind would be Lagoon one of the

226
00:10:20,910 --> 00:10:26,879
drawbacks Lagoon is that with that

227
00:10:23,339 --> 00:10:29,459
higher protein feed it may not help you

228
00:10:26,879 --> 00:10:31,699
much with the odor control you can see

229
00:10:29,459 --> 00:10:34,649
on the one of his barns he's got a

230
00:10:31,699 --> 00:10:37,529
windsock that's not for a helicopter

231
00:10:34,649 --> 00:10:40,230
landing he actually monitored the wind

232
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:43,230
direction so that he knew when was a

233
00:10:40,230 --> 00:10:45,389
good data to spread and when was not a

234
00:10:43,230 --> 00:10:47,879
good day to spread what dr. Sheffield

235
00:10:45,389 --> 00:10:50,449
was working on was a calcium phosphate

236
00:10:47,879 --> 00:10:53,369
precipitation system where they would

237
00:10:50,449 --> 00:10:56,160
precipitate the phosphates out and take

238
00:10:53,369 --> 00:10:58,499
most of their organics with them you can

239
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,870
see here the the liquid on the right is

240
00:10:58,499 --> 00:11:05,639
after it's gone through the process had

241
00:11:00,870 --> 00:11:06,630
very little odor it looked clear but it

242
00:11:05,639 --> 00:11:09,990
probably had a fairly

243
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:11,370
ammonia concentration also I'd be amiss

244
00:11:09,990 --> 00:11:13,830
since we're work with anaerobic

245
00:11:11,370 --> 00:11:16,590
digestion here in Oklahoma and we also

246
00:11:13,830 --> 00:11:18,480
work with a liquid digestion system so

247
00:11:16,590 --> 00:11:20,460
anaerobic digestion to knock down the

248
00:11:18,480 --> 00:11:22,800
organics followed by struvite

249
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:26,280
precipitation wouldn't achieve pretty

250
00:11:22,800 --> 00:11:28,740
much the same goals that's my last slide

251
00:11:26,280 --> 00:11:30,720
I want to thank John Price who is the

252
00:11:28,740 --> 00:11:33,210
owner manager of the instigator ranch

253
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,410
for allowing us to go down there and of

254
00:11:33,210 --> 00:11:37,830
course Ronald Sheffield

255
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:39,390
the late great Ronald Sheffield was the

256
00:11:37,830 --> 00:11:41,970
inspiration behind everything in Craig

257
00:11:39,390 --> 00:11:46,200
woods was our videographer and most of

258
00:11:41,970 --> 00:11:49,500
the the slides you see here were screen

259
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:51,150
safe from from our video I will be

260
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:54,360
coming out with that fact sheet shortly

261
00:11:51,150 --> 00:11:56,660
you can contact me there or that's my

262
00:11:54,360 --> 00:12:00,540
personal website at least for the next

263
00:11:56,660 --> 00:12:02,870
couple of months until extension changes

264
00:12:00,540 --> 00:12:02,870
things
