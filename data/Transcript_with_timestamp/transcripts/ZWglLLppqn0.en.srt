00:00:04,940 --> 00:00:10,830
hello again I realized when I started

2
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,240
thinking about doing a book a month that

3
00:00:10,830 --> 00:00:14,429
it was going to take me a very long time

4
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:16,710
to get through all my favorite books so

5
00:00:14,429 --> 00:00:18,990
I thought maybe I might do the

6
00:00:16,710 --> 00:00:22,020
occasional single book but there's also

7
00:00:18,990 --> 00:00:25,710
the idea of looking at themes so it's

8
00:00:22,020 --> 00:00:28,109
new year so this month's theme is forest

9
00:00:25,710 --> 00:00:29,880
gardening and it's you could think of

10
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:31,410
forest gardening as being something

11
00:00:29,880 --> 00:00:34,200
that's more to do with the summer

12
00:00:31,410 --> 00:00:35,670
because of course it's when you might be

13
00:00:34,200 --> 00:00:37,710
harvesting from the garden through the

14
00:00:35,670 --> 00:00:40,500
spring the summer in the autumn but the

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,360
winter is when we do planning and also

16
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,489
when we might be planting a lot of

17
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:46,579
things in the forest garden so perhaps

18
00:00:44,489 --> 00:00:49,980
you've heard of forest gardens or

19
00:00:46,579 --> 00:00:51,539
perhaps you already have one but if you

20
00:00:49,980 --> 00:00:53,789
start looking at the books on forest

21
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,920
gardening those that have the words

22
00:00:53,789 --> 00:00:58,980
forest gardens in the title there's

23
00:00:55,920 --> 00:01:00,239
quite a lot of them and so this really

24
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:01,739
is just looking at what are the

25
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,830
different books that you might come

26
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:09,479
across and why might there be the book

27
00:01:04,830 --> 00:01:12,060
for you so I'm gonna start with the

28
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:14,030
first book on forest gardening now it's

29
00:01:12,060 --> 00:01:16,770
important to say that forest garden is

30
00:01:14,030 --> 00:01:19,320
modeled originally on the tropical food

31
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:21,990
forest where a lot of food is grown

32
00:01:19,320 --> 00:01:23,670
below the canopy of the forest because

33
00:01:21,990 --> 00:01:25,619
there's a lot of light in the tropics

34
00:01:23,670 --> 00:01:30,240
and you can grow things at ground level

35
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:33,329
under trees now in Britain and similar

36
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:34,890
latitudes Northern Europe and so on it's

37
00:01:33,329 --> 00:01:38,189
a rather different situation is a lot

38
00:01:34,890 --> 00:01:41,909
less light here so it has to be quite

39
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,490
dark underneath forest canopy and so

40
00:01:41,909 --> 00:01:47,100
really a forest garden shouldn't really

41
00:01:44,490 --> 00:01:49,409
be so much called a forest garden Martin

42
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,509
Crawford who's one of the most

43
00:01:49,409 --> 00:01:53,759
inspirational people doing forest

44
00:01:51,509 --> 00:01:55,890
gardening these days he says really he

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:57,780
would prefer the term woodland edge

46
00:01:55,890 --> 00:02:00,899
gardening because it's really looking at

47
00:01:57,780 --> 00:02:03,299
what grows on the woodland edge all the

48
00:02:00,899 --> 00:02:05,790
different levels and so on anyway so

49
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:09,119
there the first book was called forest

50
00:02:05,790 --> 00:02:10,690
gardening and so essentially that that

51
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,090
name has been kept

52
00:02:10,690 --> 00:02:15,730
and it was written by Robert Hart who

53
00:02:13,090 --> 00:02:18,910
was I was very lucky to go and stay with

54
00:02:15,730 --> 00:02:22,660
for a but a whole week in the last year

55
00:02:18,910 --> 00:02:24,160
of his life and I remember looking at

56
00:02:22,660 --> 00:02:26,470
the visitor book and seeing how many

57
00:02:24,160 --> 00:02:28,420
people have visited his tiny little

58
00:02:26,470 --> 00:02:30,610
quarter acre forest garden which always

59
00:02:28,420 --> 00:02:33,850
felt much bigger than the quarter acre

60
00:02:30,610 --> 00:02:36,640
when you were in it and how many people

61
00:02:33,850 --> 00:02:38,590
have been inspired and of course the

62
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:40,030
evidence of that is seen in the forest

63
00:02:38,590 --> 00:02:42,670
gardens that you find around these days

64
00:02:40,030 --> 00:02:44,320
but also the number of books that we

65
00:02:42,670 --> 00:02:46,300
have now with the words forest gardening

66
00:02:44,320 --> 00:02:50,020
in the title so Robert really was

67
00:02:46,300 --> 00:02:52,510
talking about his journey the creation

68
00:02:50,020 --> 00:02:54,490
the forest garden but there wasn't a lot

69
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:56,530
of technical detail there were some

70
00:02:54,490 --> 00:02:57,970
plants in here and so on but he didn't

71
00:02:56,530 --> 00:03:01,410
have a lot of technical detail in here

72
00:02:57,970 --> 00:03:05,850
to help you create your own if you like

73
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:10,570
so so that's the first one

74
00:03:05,850 --> 00:03:12,550
so Patrick Whitefield who's who was a

75
00:03:10,570 --> 00:03:16,180
very inspirational permaculture teacher

76
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:19,540
and had written a number of books very

77
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:22,510
important books so he spent time with

78
00:03:19,540 --> 00:03:24,400
Robert and essentially wrote the

79
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:30,610
technical manual that Robert never got

80
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:34,440
to write so this book was quite fun

81
00:03:30,610 --> 00:03:38,920
trying to hold up a book and share it

82
00:03:34,440 --> 00:03:43,180
you see it's got quite a lot of there's

83
00:03:38,920 --> 00:03:45,489
some nice photo photos in here and well

84
00:03:43,180 --> 00:03:51,220
Roberts forest garden quite a lot of

85
00:03:45,489 --> 00:03:52,510
Roberts folks garden here things about

86
00:03:51,220 --> 00:03:53,560
the different layers of the forest

87
00:03:52,510 --> 00:03:58,000
garden the things that you might be

88
00:03:53,560 --> 00:03:59,590
planting and so on there's also a bit at

89
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:01,900
the beginning about how you might lay

90
00:03:59,590 --> 00:04:04,260
out the garden different patterns in the

91
00:04:01,900 --> 00:04:04,260
garden

92
00:04:04,890 --> 00:04:11,010
[Applause]

93
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,900
hmm we are gonna find the things and

94
00:04:11,010 --> 00:04:15,360
that the kind of basics of what

95
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:19,170
permaculture what box Gardens are and

96
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:23,070
how they work and so on just never find

97
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,510
the diagram you need anyway so that's

98
00:04:23,070 --> 00:04:29,400
the technical manual the first technical

99
00:04:24,510 --> 00:04:34,950
manual really on forest gardening around

100
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:38,160
that time also a couple cord adi and ken

101
00:04:34,950 --> 00:04:39,960
fern were experimenting with growing

102
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:41,760
many different plants that might be

103
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:43,610
well-suited to the forest garden and

104
00:04:41,760 --> 00:04:46,140
they wrote this book plants for a future

105
00:04:43,610 --> 00:04:49,410
and set up a charity also with the same

106
00:04:46,140 --> 00:04:53,040
name and they've also created over the

107
00:04:49,410 --> 00:04:56,220
years many years now a large database of

108
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:56,730
plants that you can access at plants for

109
00:04:56,220 --> 00:04:59,570
a future

110
00:04:56,730 --> 00:05:02,610
I think it's P faf dog on the internet

111
00:04:59,570 --> 00:05:05,130
with over 8,000 different species now

112
00:05:02,610 --> 00:05:06,810
that they've documented lots of details

113
00:05:05,130 --> 00:05:08,430
about how to grow them cultivate them

114
00:05:06,810 --> 00:05:10,620
what kind of conditions they like what

115
00:05:08,430 --> 00:05:12,180
they produce and so on and this book

116
00:05:10,620 --> 00:05:15,240
really is there it's kind of the

117
00:05:12,180 --> 00:05:18,540
highlights or the main the main

118
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:20,450
attractions if you like there's got some

119
00:05:18,540 --> 00:05:23,070
nice color photographs in here I

120
00:05:20,450 --> 00:05:26,100
remember when I got this book I was

121
00:05:23,070 --> 00:05:27,660
incredibly inspired to go out and get

122
00:05:26,100 --> 00:05:30,150
the seeds of many of these things and

123
00:05:27,660 --> 00:05:33,300
grow them and some more successfully

124
00:05:30,150 --> 00:05:41,370
than others but again really excellent

125
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:45,210
book plans for future and then across

126
00:05:41,370 --> 00:05:50,490
the pond in the States these two books

127
00:05:45,210 --> 00:05:54,360
came out so see now we've changed scale

128
00:05:50,490 --> 00:05:57,270
entirely so these two books edible

129
00:05:54,360 --> 00:06:00,510
forest Gardens Gardens volumes one and

130
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,310
two different thicknesses same price the

131
00:06:00,510 --> 00:06:04,490
reason is that this is got color in it

132
00:06:02,310 --> 00:06:07,440
and this is just black and white

133
00:06:04,490 --> 00:06:10,580
but both excellent books on different

134
00:06:07,440 --> 00:06:14,550
aspects so volume one is vision and

135
00:06:10,580 --> 00:06:19,060
theory and volume to design and practice

136
00:06:14,550 --> 00:06:31,230
this give you a sense of what's going on

137
00:06:19,060 --> 00:06:33,850
inside the books again very lovely books

138
00:06:31,230 --> 00:06:37,660
lots of information lots of research

139
00:06:33,850 --> 00:06:39,910
lots of case studies and so this is a

140
00:06:37,660 --> 00:06:43,690
case study of robert's garden Robert

141
00:06:39,910 --> 00:06:44,740
Hart's garden Winlock edge and the

142
00:06:43,690 --> 00:06:46,180
things that were good about it and the

143
00:06:44,740 --> 00:06:48,040
things that didn't work so well and

144
00:06:46,180 --> 00:06:50,140
that's one of the key things about this

145
00:06:48,040 --> 00:06:51,670
book is it's looking at what what are

146
00:06:50,140 --> 00:06:53,920
the successful strategies and one of the

147
00:06:51,670 --> 00:06:55,180
things that are not so good what have we

148
00:06:53,920 --> 00:06:59,920
learned from doing these different

149
00:06:55,180 --> 00:07:02,950
things and forest gardens are designed

150
00:06:59,920 --> 00:07:05,710
to be multifunctional so primarily

151
00:07:02,950 --> 00:07:07,540
perennial focused although they might

152
00:07:05,710 --> 00:07:11,980
have some readily self-seeding annuals

153
00:07:07,540 --> 00:07:13,750
in the system and that the outputs from

154
00:07:11,980 --> 00:07:15,850
the garden would include quite a lot of

155
00:07:13,750 --> 00:07:17,860
food but not necessarily just food so

156
00:07:15,850 --> 00:07:19,930
you have many plants in there to support

157
00:07:17,860 --> 00:07:22,750
other plants or to provide other things

158
00:07:19,930 --> 00:07:26,080
and one of the nice things about the

159
00:07:22,750 --> 00:07:30,550
parts for a future book this one here it

160
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:44,740
has some in your pen disease list sort

161
00:07:30,550 --> 00:07:46,930
of find it uses there we are right at

162
00:07:44,740 --> 00:07:50,700
the back and there's got all kinds of

163
00:07:46,930 --> 00:07:53,680
things in here gelatine substitutes oil

164
00:07:50,700 --> 00:07:57,280
egg substitutes condiments coffee

165
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:59,530
substitutes that might be some people

166
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:04,419
might wait weather is really a

167
00:07:59,530 --> 00:08:06,160
substitute for coffee and seed pods this

168
00:08:04,419 --> 00:08:07,870
fire retardants theory and non-edible

169
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:12,340
uses there's lots of things in here

170
00:08:07,870 --> 00:08:14,370
adhesives and beads and eggs and

171
00:08:12,340 --> 00:08:18,370
insecticides and all kinds of things so

172
00:08:14,370 --> 00:08:20,889
plants for many many uses

173
00:08:18,370 --> 00:08:23,760
so these two books are great they all

174
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:28,180
set you back certainly outside the US

175
00:08:23,760 --> 00:08:30,400
quite a few pounds or euros and probably

176
00:08:28,180 --> 00:08:32,380
dollars do they say they don't have the

177
00:08:30,400 --> 00:08:37,270
price on the back in dollars oh yes they

178
00:08:32,380 --> 00:08:40,630
do $75 still quite a lot of money but if

179
00:08:37,270 --> 00:08:44,710
you're thinking of doing price gardening

180
00:08:40,630 --> 00:08:48,250
seriously then they're essential really

181
00:08:44,710 --> 00:08:49,960
because they're great books and the

182
00:08:48,250 --> 00:08:53,410
money you spend on the books you'll save

183
00:08:49,960 --> 00:08:55,060
anyway the mistakes you don't make the

184
00:08:53,410 --> 00:08:55,920
trees you don't kill by putting them in

185
00:08:55,060 --> 00:08:58,960
the wrong place

186
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:01,330
so kind of coming back and sitting

187
00:08:58,960 --> 00:09:04,810
somewhere in between the brevis scales

188
00:09:01,330 --> 00:09:08,620
is Martin Crawford's first kind of

189
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,990
proper big book he's written many what

190
00:09:08,620 --> 00:09:13,089
might be called kind of directories of

191
00:09:10,990 --> 00:09:15,850
different plants around different

192
00:09:13,089 --> 00:09:18,400
categories trees and shrubs and ground

193
00:09:15,850 --> 00:09:21,430
covers and nitrogen fixers and all kinds

194
00:09:18,400 --> 00:09:23,320
of things lots of technical stuff this

195
00:09:21,430 --> 00:09:26,529
was his first kind of pretty book if you

196
00:09:23,320 --> 00:09:29,800
like and you can see my copy is fairly

197
00:09:26,529 --> 00:09:33,270
well tape together from many years of

198
00:09:29,800 --> 00:09:35,650
abuse and it's not bad at all the book

199
00:09:33,270 --> 00:09:37,390
but compared to the price of the other

200
00:09:35,650 --> 00:09:41,670
books you know this this is the book

201
00:09:37,390 --> 00:09:45,760
that has plenty in it it's full-color

202
00:09:41,670 --> 00:09:47,610
it's very beautiful work there's lots of

203
00:09:45,760 --> 00:09:52,089
technical detail in it it's basically

204
00:09:47,610 --> 00:09:55,930
Martin's experience from all the many 20

205
00:09:52,089 --> 00:09:57,459
odd years of him doing forest gardening

206
00:09:55,930 --> 00:09:59,650
what he's learned the things he's

207
00:09:57,459 --> 00:10:02,230
growing the things that work to some

208
00:09:59,650 --> 00:10:04,600
degree the plants that he's grown that

209
00:10:02,230 --> 00:10:06,880
are in the plants for a future book that

210
00:10:04,600 --> 00:10:08,529
he agrees with rather than thinking a

211
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:09,160
bit borderline whether I would eat that

212
00:10:08,529 --> 00:10:12,970
or not

213
00:10:09,160 --> 00:10:14,980
and so there's all the details of how to

214
00:10:12,970 --> 00:10:16,870
put it together and then the long lists

215
00:10:14,980 --> 00:10:18,910
of species and the kind of conditions

216
00:10:16,870 --> 00:10:20,620
they need and what they produce and how

217
00:10:18,910 --> 00:10:23,920
you look after them

218
00:10:20,620 --> 00:10:27,160
and so on and so forth so an excellent

219
00:10:23,920 --> 00:10:30,780
book certainly in terms of value for

220
00:10:27,160 --> 00:10:33,880
money I think this is about 30 pounds

221
00:10:30,780 --> 00:10:37,720
which for the side of the book and what

222
00:10:33,880 --> 00:10:39,250
you get is really a bargain and I think

223
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:41,200
you were thinking of starting with the

224
00:10:39,250 --> 00:10:43,990
forest garden to do it properly that's

225
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:47,560
where I would recommend starting that

226
00:10:43,990 --> 00:10:49,300
one and then there's a few books here

227
00:10:47,560 --> 00:10:51,850
that kind of sit to the side of the

228
00:10:49,300 --> 00:10:55,000
other books there's food from your

229
00:10:51,850 --> 00:10:58,600
forest garden this was Martin and a

230
00:10:55,000 --> 00:11:00,730
friend of mine Caroline akin who is

231
00:10:58,600 --> 00:11:02,230
another permaculture teacher and Marta's

232
00:11:00,730 --> 00:11:04,540
she'd live quite close together so

233
00:11:02,230 --> 00:11:07,060
Martin gave her she kept giving her

234
00:11:04,540 --> 00:11:09,340
produce from the garden and she went

235
00:11:07,060 --> 00:11:13,650
about seeing what they could do with it

236
00:11:09,340 --> 00:11:13,650
so it's really a collection of recipes

237
00:11:15,150 --> 00:11:19,710
around how to use the different things

238
00:11:18,100 --> 00:11:23,350
that come from the forest garden because

239
00:11:19,710 --> 00:11:25,240
whilst forest gardens should include a

240
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:29,080
lot of things we likely like apples and

241
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:30,910
pears and soft fruits and so on there's

242
00:11:29,080 --> 00:11:32,830
also a lot of things that we can grow in

243
00:11:30,910 --> 00:11:36,130
a forest garden which are less familiar

244
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:39,400
and it's good to know how to use them so

245
00:11:36,130 --> 00:11:45,460
this is a book of plants and recipes if

246
00:11:39,400 --> 00:11:49,000
you'd like again really nice lovely book

247
00:11:45,460 --> 00:11:52,090
highly recommended food from your forest

248
00:11:49,000 --> 00:11:54,010
garden and this is the one that I'm

249
00:11:52,090 --> 00:11:56,710
obsessed by at the moment the forest

250
00:11:54,010 --> 00:12:00,190
garden greenhouse because living in cold

251
00:11:56,710 --> 00:12:02,680
temperate Britain and I'm very excited

252
00:12:00,190 --> 00:12:04,450
by what could be grown more inside a

253
00:12:02,680 --> 00:12:07,210
greenhouse environment in terms of

254
00:12:04,450 --> 00:12:09,310
things that we can't normally grow here

255
00:12:07,210 --> 00:12:11,650
what's on the edge of and wherever you

256
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:12,730
are there's always it's likely that

257
00:12:11,650 --> 00:12:14,260
there are things you can't grow either

258
00:12:12,730 --> 00:12:19,360
because it's too hot to it's too cold

259
00:12:14,260 --> 00:12:22,000
and so Jerome who wrote this book the

260
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:24,580
forest garden green house lives a quite

261
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:27,550
high altitude in Colorado and they grow

262
00:12:24,580 --> 00:12:29,290
bananas and papayas and things in the

263
00:12:27,550 --> 00:12:32,170
greenhouse environment because they

264
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:34,390
create very what they call a climate

265
00:12:32,170 --> 00:12:34,900
battery which is a way of storing the

266
00:12:34,390 --> 00:12:37,600
heat

267
00:12:34,900 --> 00:12:40,210
the warm time of the year and during the

268
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:42,839
day into the soil which involves quite a

269
00:12:40,210 --> 00:12:46,690
bit of construction but it all together

270
00:12:42,839 --> 00:12:48,790
some pictures if going on in the book

271
00:12:46,690 --> 00:12:50,820
the case studies all of the different

272
00:12:48,790 --> 00:12:54,760
greenhouses that they have and how

273
00:12:50,820 --> 00:12:58,029
they're designed to do to create

274
00:12:54,760 --> 00:13:01,300
different environmental conditions you

275
00:12:58,029 --> 00:13:04,450
feel like tropical or Mediterranean this

276
00:13:01,300 --> 00:13:05,880
is the basic idea is that a fan brings

277
00:13:04,450 --> 00:13:08,589
the heat from the top of the greenhouse

278
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:12,520
down into a collection of pipes which

279
00:13:08,589 --> 00:13:14,350
are buried in the ground there we are

280
00:13:12,520 --> 00:13:17,980
there's quite a lot of work to do the

281
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:19,930
begin with you've seen quite a lot of

282
00:13:17,980 --> 00:13:22,420
pipes but once you've got that in place

283
00:13:19,930 --> 00:13:25,390
then essentially you create the

284
00:13:22,420 --> 00:13:27,130
conditions to grow lots of interesting

285
00:13:25,390 --> 00:13:29,200
things in a greenhouse and situation

286
00:13:27,130 --> 00:13:32,710
obviously not really something that

287
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:34,990
works in a real greenhouse but they say

288
00:13:32,710 --> 00:13:37,810
anything from 10 meters by three and a

289
00:13:34,990 --> 00:13:40,630
half four meters upwards and you should

290
00:13:37,810 --> 00:13:45,430
be good and all being well we have one

291
00:13:40,630 --> 00:13:48,040
of those very same a couple more books

292
00:13:45,430 --> 00:13:50,709
one is forest gardening in practice this

293
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,279
is by Thomas Romeo Tzu again there's

294
00:13:50,709 --> 00:13:56,740
another permaculturist in the UK Network

295
00:13:53,279 --> 00:14:01,150
and he's gone around basically looking

296
00:13:56,740 --> 00:14:04,000
at existing forest gardens studying how

297
00:14:01,150 --> 00:14:06,430
they work and so some of them are

298
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:08,770
private some of them are community one

299
00:14:06,430 --> 00:14:15,670
of the things that work about forest

300
00:14:08,770 --> 00:14:20,740
gardens so just very difficult to show a

301
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:23,740
book of this size to the camera and do

302
00:14:20,740 --> 00:14:29,320
the logistics of holding it and so on

303
00:14:23,740 --> 00:14:31,240
but so essentially it's his research

304
00:14:29,320 --> 00:14:32,800
journey if you like of going around all

305
00:14:31,240 --> 00:14:35,320
these different projects what they've

306
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:38,650
learned what's good what's not so good

307
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:41,090
how to do forest gardening even better

308
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:43,980
than we have up to now

309
00:14:41,090 --> 00:14:46,950
very recent book very very again very

310
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:49,260
useful particularly if you're thinking

311
00:14:46,950 --> 00:14:51,510
about creating a forest garden what

312
00:14:49,260 --> 00:14:53,760
might go wrong this also mean what can

313
00:14:51,510 --> 00:14:57,510
you do well so the last book is quite

314
00:14:53,760 --> 00:15:01,440
thin as you can see but literally

315
00:14:57,510 --> 00:15:03,900
arrived yesterday and it's a little bit

316
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,880
played on forest gardening a beginner's

317
00:15:03,900 --> 00:15:09,050
guide by Graham Burnett now Graham is

318
00:15:05,880 --> 00:15:11,910
the author of a number of different

319
00:15:09,050 --> 00:15:13,320
smallish booklets and also a rather

320
00:15:11,910 --> 00:15:15,510
chunky book called the vegan book of

321
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:20,430
permaculture which is here somewhere

322
00:15:15,510 --> 00:15:22,020
here it is and probably best known for

323
00:15:20,430 --> 00:15:24,210
writing permaculture a beginner's guide

324
00:15:22,020 --> 00:15:28,410
which is now gone to a color version

325
00:15:24,210 --> 00:15:30,960
this is also a color booklet and full

326
00:15:28,410 --> 00:15:34,470
color throughout it's full of grams

327
00:15:30,960 --> 00:15:36,870
great of the diagrams color diagrams I

328
00:15:34,470 --> 00:15:38,610
think it's quite fitting there Graham

329
00:15:36,870 --> 00:15:40,440
should write a beginner's guide to

330
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:41,880
forest garden because as you can see

331
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:44,280
none of these have beginners guides

332
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:45,750
they're all rather big books it's very

333
00:15:44,280 --> 00:15:49,170
tempting to write a lot about forest

334
00:15:45,750 --> 00:15:51,570
gardening and but very fitting because

335
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:53,460
often if you go on to the internet and

336
00:15:51,570 --> 00:15:55,680
you type in forest gardening you'll get

337
00:15:53,460 --> 00:15:58,860
pictures and you'll often see this

338
00:15:55,680 --> 00:16:02,550
diagram essentially which Graham drew

339
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:06,000
many years ago in for that particular

340
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:09,240
beginners guide so it's nice to see him

341
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:12,270
actually pre creating beginner's guide

342
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:17,340
to forest gardening and yes it's quite

343
00:16:12,270 --> 00:16:19,290
small it's got 20 about 30 pages but he

344
00:16:17,340 --> 00:16:21,600
does he makes really good use of the

345
00:16:19,290 --> 00:16:23,790
space so he starts with a very kind of

346
00:16:21,600 --> 00:16:26,880
succinct description of what forest

347
00:16:23,790 --> 00:16:28,410
gardening is and how it's important for

348
00:16:26,880 --> 00:16:31,260
what the environment and so on so you

349
00:16:28,410 --> 00:16:32,670
have lost the page already different

350
00:16:31,260 --> 00:16:34,770
functions education health and

351
00:16:32,670 --> 00:16:37,760
well-being and so on a little bit of a

352
00:16:34,770 --> 00:16:41,070
history as picture of Robert Hart there

353
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:44,400
and then you start getting into the

354
00:16:41,070 --> 00:16:45,240
realm of how do I go about doing it for

355
00:16:44,400 --> 00:16:47,820
myself

356
00:16:45,240 --> 00:16:51,630
so what do you want I mean a forest

357
00:16:47,820 --> 00:16:53,040
garden is a structure really and what

358
00:16:51,630 --> 00:16:54,660
you put into that structure is really

359
00:16:53,040 --> 00:16:57,210
down to what your needs are

360
00:16:54,660 --> 00:16:59,580
and so he just kind of asked the key

361
00:16:57,210 --> 00:17:01,290
questions of what do you want what do

362
00:16:59,580 --> 00:17:03,060
you go Lots what's your current

363
00:17:01,290 --> 00:17:05,190
situation what scale can you work out

364
00:17:03,060 --> 00:17:08,220
because we can even create a forest

365
00:17:05,190 --> 00:17:10,680
garden in a very small garden very small

366
00:17:08,220 --> 00:17:13,740
space we just you know a single tree and

367
00:17:10,680 --> 00:17:16,079
collection of things around and then he

368
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:19,170
began provides a nice little pattern

369
00:17:16,079 --> 00:17:23,420
about how you might create it over time

370
00:17:19,170 --> 00:17:26,430
and just got things about resources and

371
00:17:23,420 --> 00:17:31,670
stock designing the ground layer look on

372
00:17:26,430 --> 00:17:35,070
mapping plan there that's c1 so forth

373
00:17:31,670 --> 00:17:37,320

375
00:17:37,320 --> 00:17:42,540

grows very well in the forest garden and

378
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:52,710
