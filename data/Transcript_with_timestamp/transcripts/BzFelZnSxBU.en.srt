3
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:20,760
good morning everyone I just wanted to

4
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:24,180
share with you some information on my

5
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:27,480
strawberry variety update which is this

6
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:30,480
will probably be the last hopefully be

7
00:00:27,480 --> 00:00:33,600
the last uh discussion on these

8
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:36,239
combinations of varieties that we've

9
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:39,899
been looking at this is a five-year

10
00:00:36,239 --> 00:00:39,899
study so we've

11
00:00:40,739 --> 00:00:46,400
been able to I think get enough

12
00:00:43,860 --> 00:00:47,960
information out of these varieties

13
00:00:46,400 --> 00:00:50,520
[Music]

14
00:00:47,960 --> 00:00:53,760
but first of all as we all know that

15
00:00:50,520 --> 00:00:56,699
consumer that strawberry production has

16
00:00:53,760 --> 00:01:00,120
increased uh throughout the nation and

17
00:00:56,699 --> 00:01:02,180
it's increased in in Alabama also

18
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:05,280
um be it through

19
00:01:02,180 --> 00:01:08,220
increased consumer awareness of Health

20
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,240
promoting qualities of strawberries or

21
00:01:08,220 --> 00:01:11,760
just

22
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:15,360
uh just the fact they're just plain good

23
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:18,000
to eat and uh not only have we seen an

24
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:19,680
increase in production overall but an

25
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:22,259
increase in the number of households

26
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,119
that are purchasing strawberries so this

27
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,040
is the pretty good thing for the

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,799
strawberry industry

29
00:01:26,040 --> 00:01:31,080
uh but uh the most productive varieties

30
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,000
that we have are from the uh from

31
00:01:31,080 --> 00:01:35,759
California breeding programs and from

32
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:37,799
Florida breeding programs and so uh it's

33
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,860
it's especially important to determine

34
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:43,259
how these varieties perform in our

35
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,500
environment since strawberries are are

36
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:48,180
very environmentally sensitive and so

37
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:50,280
but and there's little documented

38
00:01:48,180 --> 00:01:52,740
information concerning the performance

39
00:01:50,280 --> 00:01:55,320
of these strawberries as well as the

40
00:01:52,740 --> 00:01:57,540
quality as I mentioned earlier the

41
00:01:55,320 --> 00:02:02,700
consumer awareness of Health promoting

42
00:01:57,540 --> 00:02:04,579
qualities of uh way into the purchase of

43
00:02:02,700 --> 00:02:07,439
these strawberries so we're looking at

44
00:02:04,579 --> 00:02:09,539
both yield performance as well as the

45
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:12,599
quality

46
00:02:09,539 --> 00:02:14,760
all right so the objective uh the term

47
00:02:12,599 --> 00:02:17,220
of production potential as well as the

48
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:19,500
antioxidant concentration of selective

49
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:21,720
strawberry cultivars in order to enhance

50
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:24,920
the sustainability of strawberry

51
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:24,920
industry in Alabama

52
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:32,640
all right so this as I mentioned was a I

53
00:02:27,300 --> 00:02:36,260
was a five-year evaluation uh in uh

54
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:39,660
be planted on an annual plastic culture

55
00:02:36,260 --> 00:02:41,940
system as the name implies it is an

56
00:02:39,660 --> 00:02:45,239
annual system that's taking a perennial

57
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,640
plant and making it using it as an

58
00:02:45,239 --> 00:02:48,980
annual plant we use black plastic mulch

59
00:02:47,640 --> 00:02:53,780
and

60
00:02:48,980 --> 00:02:58,019
resulted in about 15 000 plants per acre

61
00:02:53,780 --> 00:02:59,819
and we use plug plants in our uh in our

62
00:02:58,019 --> 00:03:03,300
planning we feel that blood plantings

63
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,099
are uh plug plants are a lot easier to

64
00:03:03,300 --> 00:03:08,300
use and they're a lot more forgiving if

65
00:03:05,099 --> 00:03:08,300
you make mistakes

66
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,040
all right these are the varieties that

67
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,860
we've used as I mentioned that this will

68
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:20,340
probably be now and hopefully be the

69
00:03:16,860 --> 00:03:23,580
last discussion on these this particular

70
00:03:20,340 --> 00:03:26,159
combination of varieties we I think we

71
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:29,280
have enough information uh to determine

72
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:32,040
how well these varieties will perform in

73
00:03:29,280 --> 00:03:34,019
at least in Central Alabama we are

74
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:37,019
looking forward to getting a new group

75
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:38,879
of varieties and we won't abandon these

76
00:03:37,019 --> 00:03:41,819
all together there will be some that

77
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:44,940
will use just uh as sort of comparison

78
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:48,180
to some of the new varieties

79
00:03:44,940 --> 00:03:49,440
so uh what data did we collect uh we

80
00:03:48,180 --> 00:03:53,040
looked at the

81
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:55,799
plant size and stolen number

82
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:58,260
uh What uh you know

83
00:03:55,799 --> 00:04:00,959
what is significance of this data plant

84
00:03:58,260 --> 00:04:03,420
size and stole one number uh plant size

85
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:07,080
is an indicator or can be an indicator

86
00:04:03,420 --> 00:04:09,140
of yield overall plants that are larger

87
00:04:07,080 --> 00:04:12,319
tend to produce

88
00:04:09,140 --> 00:04:16,139
more fruit although there has been some

89
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:18,120
there's some conflicting data in the uh

90
00:04:16,139 --> 00:04:21,900
in the literature that would suggest

91
00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:24,600
otherwise but a plant size can also play

92
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:26,419
a role especially if you are in a pick

93
00:04:24,600 --> 00:04:29,520
your own operation

94
00:04:26,419 --> 00:04:32,100
uh where um

95
00:04:29,520 --> 00:04:35,460
you know that we have an increase in

96
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,080
plant size you can have uh an air at a

97
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:39,840
time where you're not able to really see

98
00:04:37,080 --> 00:04:42,840
the plants or see the fruit that grow uh

99
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:45,660
not Growers but uh

100
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:48,419
customers aren't able to see the fruit

101
00:04:45,660 --> 00:04:51,180
um and so that leaves fruit behind and

102
00:04:48,419 --> 00:04:53,400
just left to be a inoculum or uh for

103
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:57,479
fruit disease so it becomes a management

104
00:04:53,400 --> 00:04:59,520
issue uh stolon number those of course

105
00:04:57,479 --> 00:05:02,340
you know that leads to the stolons need

106
00:04:59,520 --> 00:05:04,979
lead to daughter plants and and an

107
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,500
annual plastic Ultra system a stolen

108
00:05:04,979 --> 00:05:09,540
number uh the number of stolons isn't as

109
00:05:07,500 --> 00:05:12,540
important it becomes more or less a

110
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:15,780
detriment uh in this system as opposed

111
00:05:12,540 --> 00:05:19,139
to the uh the matted row system which is

112
00:05:15,780 --> 00:05:22,440
a a perennial system and it's driven by

113
00:05:19,139 --> 00:05:23,940
the uh the daughter plants but in this

114
00:05:22,440 --> 00:05:25,860
system we really don't want a whole lot

115
00:05:23,940 --> 00:05:28,380
of stolen so that becomes a management

116
00:05:25,860 --> 00:05:32,220
issue so we looked at that we're also

117
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:35,220
looking at yield both early in total and

118
00:05:32,220 --> 00:05:39,180
as I mentioned fruit quality we tend to

119
00:05:35,220 --> 00:05:41,639
look at soluble solids and the main

120
00:05:39,180 --> 00:05:44,699
indicator or fruit quality the soluble

121
00:05:41,639 --> 00:05:47,520
solids or or sweetness as the main

122
00:05:44,699 --> 00:05:51,300
indicator of

123
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:54,180
of quality but there are some other

124
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:57,000
um some other aspects of the fruit that

125
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,979
play into the flavor profile of

126
00:05:57,000 --> 00:06:02,660
antioxidants may be one of them but

127
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:05,940
antioxidants have a another another role

128
00:06:02,660 --> 00:06:08,240
there are cancer fighting agents

129
00:06:05,940 --> 00:06:08,240
foreign

130
00:06:08,759 --> 00:06:14,100
first off we'll start with the

131
00:06:10,620 --> 00:06:16,320
strawberry size and uh

132
00:06:14,100 --> 00:06:18,080
camarosa as we can see camarosa is a

133
00:06:16,320 --> 00:06:20,880
pretty large Plant

134
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,000
and as I mentioned this can be this can

135
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:27,419
be an issue when you're when you have a

136
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,160
you pick operation the

137
00:06:27,419 --> 00:06:31,800
customers are going to go to the fruit

138
00:06:29,160 --> 00:06:34,560
that they see and they're and oftentimes

139
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:38,039
they leave a lot of fruit behind and

140
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:42,300
it's left for an inoculum a left as

141
00:06:38,039 --> 00:06:43,620
inoculum or uh for disease and it also

142
00:06:42,300 --> 00:06:45,720
uh

143
00:06:43,620 --> 00:06:48,180
causes the grower to have to send his

144
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:51,060
workers out into the field to sort of

145
00:06:48,180 --> 00:06:53,220
clean up and find find those fruit and

146
00:06:51,060 --> 00:06:55,460
harvest those so that that's an added

147
00:06:53,220 --> 00:06:55,460
cost

148
00:06:55,860 --> 00:07:01,199
and uh the larger the fruit

149
00:06:58,680 --> 00:07:02,940
the larger the plant it also is an

150
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:05,160
indicator of

151
00:07:02,940 --> 00:07:08,280
uh well it can be a problem when it

152
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:11,100
comes to spraying pesticides so you have

153
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:14,840
a better coverage if you have uh if you

154
00:07:11,100 --> 00:07:14,840
have more space between the plants

155
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,340
and we can see Camino Real it is a it's

156
00:07:18,780 --> 00:07:22,620
a much smaller plant a significantly

157
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:26,400
smaller plant produces really nice

158
00:07:22,620 --> 00:07:29,880
compact plants uh there there is talk

159
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:32,880
about maybe com taking advantage of this

160
00:07:29,880 --> 00:07:35,400
space that's left by these smaller

161
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:37,740
plants and increasing the plant

162
00:07:35,400 --> 00:07:40,259
population but

163
00:07:37,740 --> 00:07:42,840
most Growers were probably

164
00:07:40,259 --> 00:07:44,520
just leave that space there so that

165
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:46,680
especially if they have a U-Pick

166
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:49,800
operation so that they can get better

167
00:07:46,680 --> 00:07:53,419
pesticide coverage as well as increased

168
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:53,419
visibility of the fruit

169
00:07:55,979 --> 00:08:00,360
okay so that brings us to the number of

170
00:07:58,080 --> 00:08:03,419
stolons

171
00:08:00,360 --> 00:08:04,580
and we can see that Ruby June produces a

172
00:08:03,419 --> 00:08:08,099
significantly

173
00:08:04,580 --> 00:08:10,919
produces significantly fewer stolons

174
00:08:08,099 --> 00:08:14,160
than than all of the others we can see

175
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:16,860
in 2020 and I I will point out though

176
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:21,120
that in 2020 we took these measurements

177
00:08:16,860 --> 00:08:23,340
later in the year and in 2021 we took

178
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,259
them pretty early but you can see that

179
00:08:23,340 --> 00:08:28,620
there's a

180
00:08:25,259 --> 00:08:31,080
with Ruby June in 2021 there's really

181
00:08:28,620 --> 00:08:33,060
not a column there there is there is

182
00:08:31,080 --> 00:08:35,459
data there but it can't be seen on

183
00:08:33,060 --> 00:08:36,300
columns so it just it just shows you how

184
00:08:35,459 --> 00:08:39,659
low

185
00:08:36,300 --> 00:08:41,760
um the production of um stolons are in

186
00:08:39,659 --> 00:08:43,500
Ruby June now if you were planning Ruby

187
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:45,959
June in a matter Road system this this

188
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:47,820
could be a problem but in an annual Hill

189
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,300
plastic culture system this is this

190
00:08:47,820 --> 00:08:53,700
works pretty well pretty good

191
00:08:51,300 --> 00:08:56,640
now we can see that Camino Real along

192
00:08:53,700 --> 00:08:58,560
with uh in camarosa along with being uh

193
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,500
well camarosa Along being a large

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,120
relatively large Plant it also produces

195
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:07,399
uh

196
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:07,399
a number of stolons per plant

197
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:16,260
so this leads us to the yield

198
00:09:12,060 --> 00:09:19,860
Berry size and coal uh

199
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:23,459
Camino Real and Ruby June were both the

200
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:25,620
most comparable to the camarosa both had

201
00:09:23,459 --> 00:09:28,500
lower occult root

202
00:09:25,620 --> 00:09:31,800
number and as well and the berry sizes

203
00:09:28,500 --> 00:09:34,820
are tended to be comparable to camarosa

204
00:09:31,800 --> 00:09:37,800
and then some years especially Ruby June

205
00:09:34,820 --> 00:09:39,180
those group can be a little bit larger

206
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,560
than Cameros

207
00:09:39,180 --> 00:09:43,200
thank you

208
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,660
uh Camino Real there's been an issue

209
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:47,760
though with the the uh I don't know I'm

210
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,620
talking about yield here but I'll inject

211
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:53,399
here with flavor

212
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,060
um Camino Real tended to uh tends to

213
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:59,519
have a reduced sugar or reduced flavor

214
00:09:56,060 --> 00:10:02,220
and uh and that has been a problem in

215
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:04,440
the past but some Growers said that they

216
00:10:02,220 --> 00:10:07,380
didn't notice it and their clientele

217
00:10:04,440 --> 00:10:10,080
even say that uh the dairy is is really

218
00:10:07,380 --> 00:10:14,100
really good Ruby June on the other hand

219
00:10:10,080 --> 00:10:17,040
produces a uh very tasty Berry it's not

220
00:10:14,100 --> 00:10:20,399
the yield is not quite there but uh

221
00:10:17,040 --> 00:10:23,519
compared to Camino and camarosa but it

222
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:26,339
produces a pretty tasty Berry uh

223
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:30,800
unfortunately the yields aren't quite as

224
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:30,800
as high as as those others

225
00:10:31,560 --> 00:10:35,459
so this leads us to Quality

226
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:37,560
um got a little ahead of myself though

227
00:10:35,459 --> 00:10:40,980
and I started talking about sweetness

228
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:44,640
um but uh the sweetness of camarosa or

229
00:10:40,980 --> 00:10:46,880
Camino Real does tend to be uh a little

230
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,880
low

231
00:10:46,920 --> 00:10:54,720
uh Camino Real it has and it core has a

232
00:10:50,459 --> 00:10:56,880
corresponding uh low soluble solids but

233
00:10:54,720 --> 00:10:59,760
I will mention that Ruby June tends to

234
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:01,800
have can sometimes have low soluble

235
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:03,839
solids and even when it has soluble

236
00:11:01,800 --> 00:11:06,480
solids that are low lower than the rest

237
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:08,579
it still has great flavor so there's

238
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,519
more playing in flavor than just the

239
00:11:08,579 --> 00:11:13,740
soluble solids there's some other

240
00:11:10,519 --> 00:11:18,260
components in that flavor profile that's

241
00:11:13,740 --> 00:11:18,260
providing that excellent flavor

242
00:11:20,300 --> 00:11:27,200
so in summary uh

243
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:30,480
started with plant size Camino Real was

244
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:33,899
smaller it was slightly more comparable

245
00:11:30,480 --> 00:11:37,079
to out uh Albion but it was slightly

246
00:11:33,899 --> 00:11:39,420
smaller than Albion uh as I mentioned

247
00:11:37,079 --> 00:11:42,240
this Growers could take it take

248
00:11:39,420 --> 00:11:45,959
advantage of this compactness of the

249
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:47,579
fruit of the plant by

250
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,279
Maybe

251
00:11:47,579 --> 00:11:53,339
planning them a little closer

252
00:11:50,279 --> 00:11:55,200
but I think that most Grovers will

253
00:11:53,339 --> 00:11:59,399
probably take advantage of this and

254
00:11:55,200 --> 00:12:03,360
allow this to to remain as a a way of

255
00:11:59,399 --> 00:12:06,779
increasing the visibility of the berries

256
00:12:03,360 --> 00:12:10,320
uh Ruby June had low stolen number and

257
00:12:06,779 --> 00:12:13,740
this again can be a great management

258
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:16,860
benefit reduction in costs hopefully

259
00:12:13,740 --> 00:12:19,260
good production in Labor uh these it is

260
00:12:16,860 --> 00:12:22,620
recommended that the stolons be removed

261
00:12:19,260 --> 00:12:27,060
once they start because they will hinder

262
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:30,899
the yield and so with Ruby June there's

263
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:34,200
not as many stolons that have to remove

264
00:12:30,899 --> 00:12:36,899
um as opposed to Camino Real which was

265
00:12:34,200 --> 00:12:39,180
among the highest stolons at least when

266
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:40,860
the stolons were counted later in the

267
00:12:39,180 --> 00:12:43,920
season

268
00:12:40,860 --> 00:12:47,639
uh Camino Real and Ruby June are most

269
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:50,519
comparable in yield to uh camarosa as

270
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:52,920
well as they are also comparable to

271
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:56,579
Cameros in Berry size

272
00:12:52,920 --> 00:12:59,820
both had uh lower cult fruit and which

273
00:12:56,579 --> 00:13:02,459
is again another uh management benefit

274
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,399
in management that's fewer group that

275
00:13:02,459 --> 00:13:07,920
have to be taken out have to be picked

276
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:11,040
through and increasing the labor costs

277
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:13,980
and time dedicated to this and dedicate

278
00:13:11,040 --> 00:13:16,680
and taken away from other things other

279
00:13:13,980 --> 00:13:18,860
activities in the operation

280
00:13:16,680 --> 00:13:18,860
foreign

281
00:13:19,820 --> 00:13:25,800
throughout the season or throughout the

282
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:28,620
five years but Ruby June still had

283
00:13:25,800 --> 00:13:31,380
excellent flavor regardless of the

284
00:13:28,620 --> 00:13:33,440
soluble solid content

285
00:13:31,380 --> 00:13:35,839
and one thing that we noticed in

286
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:37,980
anthocyanin content is that the

287
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,620
anthocyanins tended to run a little low

288
00:13:37,980 --> 00:13:41,180
in Ruby June

289
00:13:39,620 --> 00:13:44,639
this

290
00:13:41,180 --> 00:13:47,160
could play uh play into the fact that uh

291
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:49,500
you know as as consumer awareness grows

292
00:13:47,160 --> 00:13:52,019
they're

293
00:13:49,500 --> 00:13:55,079
gonna be more interested in compounds

294
00:13:52,019 --> 00:13:58,800
like this and berries and uh

295
00:13:55,079 --> 00:14:02,700
breeders are more interested in this and

296
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:07,019
and trying to increase this or

297
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:09,300
um higher concentrations and berries

298
00:14:07,019 --> 00:14:12,180
so on conclusion plant characteristics

299
00:14:09,300 --> 00:14:14,820
yield and fruit qualities indicate that

300
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:17,220
Camino Real and Ruby June offer

301
00:14:14,820 --> 00:14:18,200
potential Alternatives camarosa in

302
00:14:17,220 --> 00:14:22,620
Alabama

303
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:25,620
and I will say that maybe camera Ruby

304
00:14:22,620 --> 00:14:27,959
June to a lesser degree I think in

305
00:14:25,620 --> 00:14:30,779
fields where you've got a little you've

306
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,240
got a few more stresses both Camino Real

307
00:14:30,779 --> 00:14:36,200
and Ruby June probably won't do as well

308
00:14:33,240 --> 00:14:38,940
as camarosa in terms of yield

309
00:14:36,200 --> 00:14:41,100
but Camino Real tends to be a little

310
00:14:38,940 --> 00:14:43,980
more comparable to camarosa even in

311
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:47,040
those situations uh Ruby June tends to

312
00:14:43,980 --> 00:14:50,220
drop off a little bit because it it is a

313
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:54,899
little less adapted when you have those

314
00:14:50,220 --> 00:14:54,899
more challenging environmental factors

315
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,920
so some points to remember uh

316
00:14:57,650 --> 00:15:01,620
[Music]

317
00:14:58,920 --> 00:15:04,220
plug versus bare root I like plug plants

318
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:07,079
as I mentioned these are better

319
00:15:04,220 --> 00:15:10,380
they're more

320
00:15:07,079 --> 00:15:14,699
tolerant to mistakes and and we do make

321
00:15:10,380 --> 00:15:17,100
quite a few and uh and so it's I think

322
00:15:14,699 --> 00:15:18,899
it's beneficial to get these these are a

323
00:15:17,100 --> 00:15:21,660
little more expensive

324
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:24,180
and but some Growers really like working

325
00:15:21,660 --> 00:15:25,440
with bare root plants and they work well

326
00:15:24,180 --> 00:15:28,320
for them

327
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:32,040
uh one thing to remember is that these

328
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:34,260
new operations uh you know as Ed Sakura

329
00:15:32,040 --> 00:15:36,300
mentioned um you know we kind of have a

330
00:15:34,260 --> 00:15:39,720
an issue with uh

331
00:15:36,300 --> 00:15:41,880
the number of operations uh providing

332
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:44,880
plants uh but

333
00:15:41,880 --> 00:15:47,100
the the operations that we deal with now

334
00:15:44,880 --> 00:15:49,440
they have a minimum order so you have to

335
00:15:47,100 --> 00:15:52,199
be up just ask them up front you know

336
00:15:49,440 --> 00:15:55,019
what that minimum order is and how much

337
00:15:52,199 --> 00:15:57,899
do you pay up front some require you

338
00:15:55,019 --> 00:16:00,540
know maybe half the uh the the cost the

339
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:01,440
half the total cost of the berries

340
00:16:00,540 --> 00:16:04,500
foreign

341
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:06,839
and one thing to remember is uh if if at

342
00:16:04,500 --> 00:16:09,480
all possible do not delay in place in

343
00:16:06,839 --> 00:16:12,000
your order uh place your order as soon

344
00:16:09,480 --> 00:16:15,720
as as you can as soon as the they are

345
00:16:12,000 --> 00:16:17,880
available this will help you to uh not

346
00:16:15,720 --> 00:16:19,860
only get the the types of berries that

347
00:16:17,880 --> 00:16:23,579
you want but also the number of berries

348
00:16:19,860 --> 00:16:25,920
and if you wait too late you you may not

349
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:29,339
be able to get any at all so

350
00:16:25,920 --> 00:16:31,920
um now is the time actually it's getting

351
00:16:29,339 --> 00:16:34,320
a little a little late so if you have

352
00:16:31,920 --> 00:16:36,899
not ordered uh if you know Growers that

353
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:38,399
who have not ordered uh you know

354
00:16:36,899 --> 00:16:41,120
encourage them to go ahead and place

355
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,120
their orders

356
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:43,160
um

357
00:16:44,160 --> 00:16:51,240
and uh Camino Real and uh Ruby June you

358
00:16:48,600 --> 00:16:54,899
know they have been used in or at least

359
00:16:51,240 --> 00:16:56,699
I know Ruby Camino Real has been used uh

360
00:16:54,899 --> 00:16:59,699
in uh

361
00:16:56,699 --> 00:17:03,000
in operations when uh in years where

362
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:04,500
camarosa wasn't available uh and The

363
00:17:03,000 --> 00:17:07,799
Growers had a pretty good experience

364
00:17:04,500 --> 00:17:11,160
with Camino Real and uh and and to some

365
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:15,000
degree Ruby June uh to the point to the

366
00:17:11,160 --> 00:17:16,860
to the point of not uh or or kind of

367
00:17:15,000 --> 00:17:20,220
swapping uh

368
00:17:16,860 --> 00:17:21,360
uh Camino Real or camera support Camino

369
00:17:20,220 --> 00:17:22,020
Real

370
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,360
um

371
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,059
because their clientele said that

372
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:29,460
they're they're they're delicious they

373
00:17:27,059 --> 00:17:31,320
think they're delicious and they're just

374
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:34,799
product just as productive and in some

375
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:39,120
cases uh even more so again order on

376
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:42,240
time uh test soil early uh

377
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:44,039
and uh provide yourself with timely bed

378
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:47,220
preparation so that you can get your

379
00:17:44,039 --> 00:17:49,740
plants uh in the ground earlier early

380
00:17:47,220 --> 00:17:52,320
planning or timely planning is is is

381
00:17:49,740 --> 00:17:54,299
critical I think in getting uh really

382
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:56,580
good yields

383
00:17:54,299 --> 00:17:58,919
so this is a list of our current list of

384
00:17:56,580 --> 00:18:01,620

385
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,960
