38
00:01:44,719 --> 00:01:54,320
fused farmers who need to start making a

39
00:01:48,600 --> 00:01:54,320

40
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,159
farming the Kenyan tomato industry

41
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:06,399
Kenyan Tomatoes most of them are sold in

42
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:09,640
the market though there is a small

43
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:12,040
portion absorbed by the industry and

44
00:02:09,640 --> 00:02:14,440
therefore it is the mass Market that

45
00:02:12,040 --> 00:02:19,200
determines the overall prices that

46
00:02:14,440 --> 00:02:23,720
farmers earn now tomato prices in Kenya

47
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:27,879
can be determined by WEA Supply demand

48
00:02:23,720 --> 00:02:31,599
and most of all the Brokers will and

49
00:02:27,879 --> 00:02:33,720
greed how much brokers want is what the

50
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,280
farmer will sell simply because he

51
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:40,280
cannot sell his own produce and

52
00:02:37,280 --> 00:02:43,560
therefore the inability of most Farmers

53
00:02:40,280 --> 00:02:47,000
to access Market is what has empowered

54
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:50,920
Mercedes brokers who never Farm but I

55
00:02:47,000 --> 00:02:54,080

56
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:57,040
production selling tomatoes in krams

57
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:59,480
especially as how Industries absorb is

58
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,360
the most profitable way for Farmers

59
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:03,319
however

60
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:08,599
Brokers prefer using expective units of

61
00:03:03,319 --> 00:03:12,360
measure such as hip crate or Pro box two

62
00:03:08,599 --> 00:03:12,360

67
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,040
coincides with low market

68
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,760
supply yes

69
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:36,959
planting your tomatoes in such a way

70
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:40,439
that you harvest them when there are Le

71
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:45,200
little market supply at least at this

72
00:03:40,439 --> 00:03:47,680
time prices are high and even if Brokers

73
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,360
try to expl you will still get good

74
00:03:47,680 --> 00:03:53,599
margins

75
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:58,640
and at this time especially when there

76
00:03:53,599 --> 00:04:02,640
is heavy Lane most produce is destroyed

77
00:03:58,640 --> 00:04:05,480
by the L the roads are inaccessible

78
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:08,120
therefore the supply roow and prices are

79
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:10,400
high remember tomato demand is always

80
00:04:08,120 --> 00:04:14,720

00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:43,000
60 cm by 50 cm but for Greenhouse fing

147
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:44,560
you can do 50 cm by 50 cm simply because

148
00:07:43,000 --> 00:07:47,400
you'll do the

149
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:51,759

in large scale farming suain seed drinks

159
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:21,120
is economical however for small scale

160
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:23,960
Farmers Laing your own seedings is most

161
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,560
economic and the variety is guaranteed

162
00:08:23,960 --> 00:08:27,560
even for large scale Farmers if you can

variety is guaranteed we've experienced

166
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,959
several cases where Farmers they ordered

167
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:41,440
or outsourced the drings but they were

168
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:43,880
not the variety that they were promised

169
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:46,720
given Farmers ress and remember you

170
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:49,320
could only realize this few months down

171
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:51,920
the line and it's irreversible there's

172
00:08:49,320 --> 00:08:56,160
nothing much you can do Ling own SE

173
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,160
drings is guaranteed of quality and

174
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,079
variety after you've planted your

175
00:08:58,360 --> 00:09:03,720
Tomatoes the next thing is feeding

176
00:09:01,079 --> 00:09:06,920
feeding is what determines the yield

177
00:09:03,720 --> 00:09:09,000
regardless of the variety if you have a

178
00:09:06,920 --> 00:09:12,279
good variety and you don't feed it well

179
00:09:09,000 --> 00:09:15,079
you'll definitely experience low

180
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,240
needs here is the tomato fertilizer

181
00:09:15,079 --> 00:09:18,480
application

182
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:21,760
schedule the fertilizer that you need to

183
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:27,760
apply how and even the

184
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:31,000
quantity to breast with dap NPK 1717 and

185
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:33,959
fertilizers on the for 14th day after

186
00:09:31,000 --> 00:09:36,360
transplanting 45th day after

187
00:09:33,959 --> 00:09:38,959
transplanting and 16th days after

188
00:09:36,360 --> 00:09:41,279
transplanting respectively what do I

189
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:45,079
mean I mean J planting you don't apply

190
00:09:41,279 --> 00:09:47,200
the DAP 2 weeks after your seedings have

191
00:09:45,079 --> 00:09:50,200
developed you can now come and apply the

192
00:09:47,200 --> 00:09:52,279
DAP at this time the seedings would have

193
00:09:50,200 --> 00:09:54,480
developed the roots and managed to

194
00:09:52,279 --> 00:09:56,600
absorb the fertilizer if you applied

195
00:09:54,480 --> 00:09:59,440
during the planting it may be easily

196
00:09:56,600 --> 00:10:04,120
reached away and not end up helping the

197
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:07,640
crop after that 45 day equivalent to 1

198
00:10:04,120 --> 00:10:12,079
and a half month after transplanting you

199
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:14,120
can now apply NPK 17 17 17 it has the

200
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:18,720
balance nitrogen phosphorus and

201
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:21,200
potassium this will initiate fluting and

202
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:24,079
flowering so you don't skip this one and

203
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:27,320
go to CN no this one will initiate

204
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:30,560
fruiting and flowering and give you high

205
00:10:27,320 --> 00:10:33,600
number of fruits and flowers

206
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:36,200
after that then 2

207
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:38,920
months after transplanting you can apply

208
00:10:36,200 --> 00:10:41,440
now the CA and fertilizer CN has the

209
00:10:38,920 --> 00:10:42,079
calcium that will help in expansion of

210
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,720
the

211
00:10:42,079 --> 00:10:48,320
fruit and that's why we usually

212
00:10:44,720 --> 00:10:50,519
recommend it to be done 60 days after

213
00:10:48,320 --> 00:10:52,800
transplanting you can supplement this

214
00:10:50,519 --> 00:10:55,320
fertilization by applying nitrogen fol

215
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:57,959
fertilizers such as you can apply easily

216
00:10:55,320 --> 00:11:00,160
grow vegetative on the first month that

217
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:03,200
is 2 weeks after transplanting and your

218
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:06,079
to blasting every week you do e grow

219
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:08,600
vegetative to enhance for your growth on

220
00:11:06,079 --> 00:11:13,920
the second month after transplanting now

221
00:11:08,600 --> 00:11:17,560
you apply the NPK FIA such as oo uh and

222
00:11:13,920 --> 00:11:21,079
also Advanced K this one has more

223
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:23,920
potassium and it will help in floating

224
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:27,240
and flowering on the third month you can

225
00:11:23,920 --> 00:11:30,440
now apply calcium Le forious fertilizers

226
00:11:27,240 --> 00:11:35,399
to prevent blossom endro and

227
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:39,639
also these calcium Bon folas they will

228
00:11:35,399 --> 00:11:39,639
prevent in fruit and flow

229
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:45,440
abortion after that we going to look at

230
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:48,120
the wor tomato paste and how to control

231
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:51,959
them imagine after selecting the best

232
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:55,760
variety feing then now what kicks out

233
00:11:51,959 --> 00:11:57,959
all tomato fing it's p diseases we are

234
00:11:55,760 --> 00:12:00,560
not going to allow this and that's why

235
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,920
we are now giving you the worst of all

236
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:06,279
and the best chemicals you can use and

237
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:10,720
how you can manage to apply them the

238
00:12:06,279 --> 00:12:14,519
number one past that has run most

239
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:18,519
Farmers out of business is Du absoluta

240
00:12:14,519 --> 00:12:21,279
or what we call Reef Miner it's the most

241
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:24,800
destructive paste in tomato farming due

242
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:27,240
to its infectiveness to most chemicals

243
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,240
caused by insect nature of damage

244
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,839
actually it tends to hibernate between

245
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:32,880
the layers of the leaves so that when

246
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:36,199
you apply the chemicals they are much

247
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:39,560
not effective to identify them very

248
00:12:36,199 --> 00:12:42,800
easily you can see some marks as if H

249
00:12:39,560 --> 00:12:45,040
kind of of snail passing by we often

250
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:48,120
call them broad shaped mindes on the

251
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:51,160
leaves L you find them on stems but you

252
00:12:48,120 --> 00:12:54,240
can also find them there the best

253
00:12:51,160 --> 00:12:57,680
control for Tut absoluta is applying the

254
00:12:54,240 --> 00:13:01,600
best chemicals early so you can apply

255
00:12:57,680 --> 00:13:06,079
belt for a male at the rate of 4 m in 20

256
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:08,079
L of water or 10 m per 20 L of water

257
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,959
these application should be done from

258
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:13,839
the third week after transplanting and

259
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:15,480
you continue at Le weekly weekly weekly

260
00:13:13,839 --> 00:13:19,320
and when you apply you apply on the

261
00:13:15,480 --> 00:13:22,160
leaves below the leaves and also on the

262
00:13:19,320 --> 00:13:25,120
soil okay why do we apply on the soil so

263
00:13:22,160 --> 00:13:27,639
that we can manage to kill all the eggs

264
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:30,800
ra on the soil below the leaves you need

265
00:13:27,639 --> 00:13:34,440
to control it and also on top control

266
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:37,000
when you do this you will manage to have

267
00:13:34,440 --> 00:13:40,160
a total control before it reaches the

268
00:13:37,000 --> 00:13:42,720
last stage right like a

269
00:13:40,160 --> 00:13:45,720
fly remember it goes the whole

270
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:49,399
metamorphosis so if you don't control it

271
00:13:45,720 --> 00:13:52,360
before becoming an insect it will be

272
00:13:49,399 --> 00:13:56,800
hard and this what has caused most

273
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:59,519
Farmers low yet you find fruits they

274
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:02,240
have made some holes and buas don't also

275
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:06,519
want to buy them no one wants to

276
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:09,759
buy a tomato with wols made of

277
00:14:06,519 --> 00:14:11,800
insect so the best way ensure that you

278
00:14:09,759 --> 00:14:14,399
you can use bed for a m per 20 L of

279
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:17,160
water or Emerald 10 m per 20 L of water

280
00:14:14,399 --> 00:14:18,560
and apply early there is no shortcut

281
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:22,360
about

282
00:14:18,560 --> 00:14:24,399
it the next Insight that has caused

283
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,399
total Destruction in crops and

284
00:14:24,399 --> 00:14:30,440
especially Greenhouse Farmers it's white

285
00:14:27,399 --> 00:14:33,800
fries this one has has drained most

286
00:14:30,440 --> 00:14:39,000
Farmers white fries they are white stop

287
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:42,079
stacking insects and by doing so they

288
00:14:39,000 --> 00:14:46,040
tend to promote growth of su

289
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:48,600
mod kind of extracted honey they cause

290
00:14:46,040 --> 00:14:52,360
regular liening of tomatoes and can also

291
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:54,639
transmit viral pathogens like the Tomato

292
00:14:52,360 --> 00:14:57,440
yellow lefal

293
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,759
virus to identify them you just need to

294
00:14:57,440 --> 00:15:02,759
shake shake the plants a little bit and

295
00:14:59,759 --> 00:15:06,160
you'll see white flying insects along to

296
00:15:02,759 --> 00:15:09,839
control them apply profile at 30 m per

297
00:15:06,160 --> 00:15:12,959
20 L of water or also Amon 10 ml per 20

298
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:14,720
L of water the application in it own

299
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,120
green houses should be done on the

300
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:19,839
midday if it's on the farm it should be

301
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:22,000
done on the evening you apply around the

302
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:24,160
farm and then you apply inside not

303
00:15:22,000 --> 00:15:27,680
inside then you will finish with around

304
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:31,160
no spraying fast around the farm

305
00:15:27,680 --> 00:15:33,360
contains the them and makes them easy to

306
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:33,360
be

307
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:39,800
killed after controlling the paste the

308
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:42,920
next thing you need to watch out is the

309
00:15:39,800 --> 00:15:44,519
Tomato diseases here is how you can

310
00:15:42,920 --> 00:15:47,720
control them

311
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:49,880
early the most destructive tomato

312
00:15:47,720 --> 00:15:54,440
disease is

313
00:15:49,880 --> 00:15:54,440
bright oftenly known as

314
00:15:55,480 --> 00:16:02,920
Bida this one has drained a lot of

315
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:05,600
farmers and kick them out out of tomato

316
00:16:02,920 --> 00:16:07,720
farming business tomato arite is a

317
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:10,360
disease characterized by brown spot with

318
00:16:07,720 --> 00:16:13,279
dark conc drinks the disease spreads

319
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,800
rapidly affecting the Lees and the stem

320
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:20,519
and finally it affects the

321
00:16:15,800 --> 00:16:24,079
fruits to control it apply my 72 WP at

322
00:16:20,519 --> 00:16:27,800
the rate of 30 G per 20 L of water or

323
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:31,839
gold at the rate of 50 g per 20 L of

324
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:36,079
water the the best way to control them

325
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:38,839
is a application once they are affected

326
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:42,519
it becomes very very hard

327
00:16:38,839 --> 00:16:45,519
remember the cells of the plant die so

328
00:16:42,519 --> 00:16:48,560
and you cannot manage to revive them and

329
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,720
therefore the best way is to prevent

330
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:53,560
early when you've seen little

331
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:56,759
infestation you can first apply copper

332
00:16:53,560 --> 00:17:00,000
Beast find St such as the green cop or

333
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:04,079
Isa cop and then after that you now

334
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:08,559
continue applying the normal fun sites

335
00:17:04,079 --> 00:17:10,559
but most of all is ensuring that you've

336
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:14,120
prevented the

337
00:17:10,559 --> 00:17:16,559
infestation and the best application L

338
00:17:14,120 --> 00:17:20,439
is applying twice per week in cold

339
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,319
Seasons or heavy season or once per week

340
00:17:20,439 --> 00:17:24,880
in hot

341
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:27,679
Seasons the next disease that has

342
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:29,480
destroyed a lot of tomatoes is tomato

343
00:17:27,679 --> 00:17:32,679
yellow leaf spot

344
00:17:29,480 --> 00:17:35,960
disease you find the leaves has black

345
00:17:32,679 --> 00:17:36,840
spots okay the bright and Sport disease

346
00:17:35,960 --> 00:17:39,720
are

347
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:43,400
different for sport disease you find

348
00:17:39,720 --> 00:17:46,600
sports evenly distributed on the leaves

349
00:17:43,400 --> 00:17:50,120
but for blight you'll find along the

350
00:17:46,600 --> 00:17:55,440
margins as if they starting to

351
00:17:50,120 --> 00:17:58,840
dry it it starts by affecting other

352
00:17:55,440 --> 00:18:01,240
leaves with greenish yellow spots

353
00:17:58,840 --> 00:18:04,080
begging from the top of the leaf

354
00:18:01,240 --> 00:18:07,120
progressively the spots become dark with

355
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:10,880
infected Broms also turning black and

356
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:13,919
falling off the disease it also affect

357
00:18:10,880 --> 00:18:16,919
fruits for Effective control you can

358
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:20,000
apply either Trinity gold at the rate of

359
00:18:16,919 --> 00:18:21,720
50 g per 20 L of water or you can also

360
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:26,480
apply

361
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:30,600
skore yes at at the rate of 20 ml

362
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:34,600
per 20 L of water these two will help in

363
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:37,280
total control of Lea spot Lea spots and

364
00:18:34,600 --> 00:18:40,679
bright these are the worst diseases that

365
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:43,159
will kick you out of tomato famine

366
00:18:40,679 --> 00:18:45,880
imagine all that investment and bu is

367
00:18:43,159 --> 00:18:48,640
where you come to or after all that

368
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,480
investment and then you let just because

369
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:53,679
of the carelessness you let your crops

370
00:18:51,480 --> 00:18:59,360
be destroyed

371
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:01,760
by P P the tutor and also the white FES

372
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:05,080
actually we don't expect any farmer

373
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:07,440
listening to this tutorial to be ever

374
00:19:05,080 --> 00:19:09,200
again stressed by this dis we've given

375
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,720
you toal

376
00:19:09,200 --> 00:19:14,520
control and after you've done this now

377
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:17,200
let do the math how much are you willing

378
00:19:14,520 --> 00:19:19,600
or high likely to make and how much are

379
00:19:17,200 --> 00:19:22,280
you highly likely to

380
00:19:19,600 --> 00:19:25,520
incur the cost and profit of tomato

381
00:19:22,280 --> 00:19:27,480
farming in Kenya the cost of tomato

382
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:31,400
production in Kenya is

383
00:19:27,480 --> 00:19:32,440
185,000 k Shing and you can find all

384
00:19:31,400 --> 00:19:37,760
these

385
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:39,200
M on our previous article which you can

00:19:37,760 --> 00:19:42,400
click here

387
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:45,600
above this often varies with season

388
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:48,440
location and management and good

389
00:19:45,600 --> 00:19:51,120
management Ana can produce 300

390
00:19:48,440 --> 00:19:54,559
crates if a farmer

391
00:19:51,120 --> 00:19:59,679
Sals if a farmer sales one crit at

392
00:19:54,559 --> 00:20:03,240
around 1,000 shs then a y 300,000

393
00:19:59,679 --> 00:20:06,000
from 300 crat in one this gives him a

394
00:20:03,240 --> 00:20:06,000
profit of around

395
00:20:07,320 --> 00:20:15,400
115,000 however if he does sell the

396
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:19,320
similar crates below 800 500 and even as

397
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:23,400
it was in some months past at 300 Shing

398
00:20:19,320 --> 00:20:27,440
per crit the farmer definitely make

399
00:20:23,400 --> 00:20:29,360
losses so therefore the best means that

400
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:33,080
you can manage to get good profit is

401
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,080
selling your yield above 1,000 shs per

402
00:20:33,080 --> 00:20:37,159
crit at least this way you'll get some

403
00:20:35,080 --> 00:20:40,080
good

404
00:20:37,159 --> 00:20:42,799
profit remember we promised as we begin

405
00:20:40,080 --> 00:20:45,760
to give you the bonus tips we have the

406
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:47,919
very bonus tips how you can increase

407
00:20:45,760 --> 00:20:50,360
yield then the second one how you can

408
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:53,080
speed the Tomato growth and also the

409
00:20:50,360 --> 00:20:55,559
third one how you can get your tomatoes

410
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:59,280
to produce more

411
00:20:55,559 --> 00:21:01,679
fruits now to increase yield and ESP

412
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:05,960
special tomato yield ensure that you've

413
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:09,440
planted with 2 kg of manure Ure that

414
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:15,080
you've toess with 100 kgs of D 100 kgs

415
00:21:09,440 --> 00:21:18,400
of NPK 17 and 100 kgs of c

416
00:21:15,080 --> 00:21:21,919
and you've done sufficient

417
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:24,880
irrigation don't forget also to control

418
00:21:21,919 --> 00:21:27,640
the past and diseases once you do that

419
00:21:24,880 --> 00:21:29,520
you will definitely increase your yield

420
00:21:27,640 --> 00:21:31,880
the next one on speeding the Tomato

421
00:21:29,520 --> 00:21:35,080
growth ensure that you planted in warm

422
00:21:31,880 --> 00:21:37,679
areas Ure that you water very well and

423
00:21:35,080 --> 00:21:40,760
you feed them P Tre and by feeding I

424
00:21:37,679 --> 00:21:43,799
mean giving them the right fertilizer at

425
00:21:40,760 --> 00:21:46,960
the right time not that you're giving

426
00:21:43,799 --> 00:21:49,080
the DAP 2 months or you're apping C at

427
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,919
the beginning those one will not give

428
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:55,400
you the good results the third one how

429
00:21:52,919 --> 00:21:59,320
do you get your tomatoes to produce more

430
00:21:55,400 --> 00:22:02,279
fruits one you can spray

431
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:05,200
high potassium FIA fertilizers such as

432
00:22:02,279 --> 00:22:06,559
advanced K this one will enhance

433
00:22:05,200 --> 00:22:09,279
flowering and

434
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:12,720
fruiting and don't forget to combine it

435
00:22:09,279 --> 00:22:16,200
with Boron Boron will prevent the formed

436
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:18,400
fruit and flouring from a boin and the

437
00:22:16,200 --> 00:22:21,559
third thing don't forget to add calcium

438
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:24,679
it will prevent the Brom

439
00:22:21,559 --> 00:22:29,480
andrs that's how smart Farmers would

440
00:22:24,679 --> 00:22:31,880
grow tomatoes and make a Kill from it

441
00:22:29,480 --> 00:22:34,679
I believe now you can comfortably begin

442
00:22:31,880 --> 00:22:38,520
your tomato farming if you have any

443
00:22:34,679 --> 00:22:40,520
question on tomato farming kindly let us

444
00:22:38,520 --> 00:22:42,400
know in the comment section we are

445
00:22:40,520 --> 00:22:46,000
willing to help you and we are willing

446
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,240
to help you get those 400 or even 500

447
00:22:46,000 --> 00:22:51,520
crates you get about 40 ttimes yes

448
00:22:49,240 --> 00:22:53,279
remember if you get high yield and at

449
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:55,880
low cost regardless sometimes of the

450
00:22:53,279 --> 00:22:59,039
price you definitely get good margins

451
00:22:55,880 --> 00:23:01,760
but if you have low Ys I you get low

452
00:22:59,039 --> 00:23:04,080
prices you end up making losses and in

453
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:07,760
tomato farming there is no shortcut

454
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:10,559
there is no shortcut you cannot plant an

455
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:13,960
opv variety and you expect 40 tons you

456
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:17,840
cannot deny the crop CN or NPK and you

457
00:23:13,960 --> 00:23:21,039
expect good plant you cannot skip weakly

458
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:24,840
spraying of chemicals to control T absor

459
00:23:21,039 --> 00:23:28,919
white fries bright yellow spots black

460
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:31,279
spots you cannot escap that chemical and

461
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:34,480
you expect good years it doesn't happen

462
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:37,240
like that you have to be consist

463
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:40,400
consistent don't forget also to like to
