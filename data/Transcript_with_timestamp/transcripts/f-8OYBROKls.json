  "text": "[Music] in this country in the last 70 years many achievements are there we have built businesses we have built industry our scientists are going to mars but of all these things the most significant achievement for us is that our poor farmer without any infrastructure hardly any technology just with traditional knowledge he's been feeding over a billion people this is not a small thing but we are taking that away from him [Music] today go out and ask anybody any farmer how many of them want their children to go into farming it is less than 15 percent in another 20 years 25 years you will see you will not know how to grow food in this country [Music] in the last 12 years three lakh farmers have committed suicide even in a war that many people don't die this is happening essentially because of the investment that goes into irrigation projects and inability to access market i was just talking to a tamilnadu farmer who is 27 years of age he says he has sunk nine borewells in three and a half acres he's never going to make it he has to either sell the land or run away from the village or hang from a tree it's very important that farming is made into an attractive process economically very attractive process so that youth will get engaged with farming this will only happen if the irrigation and the marketing large companies take it up these two things can never be addressed unless there is scale one reason why rural population can never scale up is because the land holdings are so small with that level of land there is no way to invest or to organize or to you know be able to leverage the market there is no possibility so one solution that we are asking for is to form large-scale farmers producers organizations see if let us say ten thousand farmers came together as a farmer's producers organization if ten thousand farmers came together let's say on an average three four acres if they own also it's 30 40 000 acres this does not mean integration of land just aggregation of irrigation and aggregation of marketing forces and aggregation of value addition aspects of the agricultural produce if land is properly demarcated and irrigated and irrigation is managed by a company nearly 500 million people they will be available for ancillary alternate and value addition activity if you provide the necessary skills and opportunities and bank loans and stuff you will spawn a whole revolution in the rural india and if marketing is also taken over by companies which are capable of doing this far more focuses on just producing food it is very easy within three years time that you can multiply agricultural income in terms of economic value at least by 300 percent and we've been appealing to the government because in this country individual agricultural income is not taxed but if you organize yourself as a farmer's producers organization you get 30 tax fortunately in this budget they responded that the tax on the fpo has been taken away we have a farmer's producer organization here coimbatore i gave three young people three smartphones they just renegotiate the produce every day with this the farmer's income has doubled [Music] foreign foreign foreign there are many things to be done on the ground but if we handle this one thing india's economy the agricultural economy can go up 200 to 300 in a matter of three to four years time an enhancement of rural economy means enhancement of economic possibilities for 65 percent of india's population for this farmers produces organizations to be successful the corporates in the country the social organizations and above all the financial institutions have to pitch in and this will be lucrative for the corporates this will be very fulfilling for the social organizations and very safe and secure for the banking sector because this organization will benefit all and above all it will raise the level of life in rural india this can be a game changer if we do it right we are at a threshold where we can move an entire massive population which is nearly 700 million people from one level of living to another if we just do a few things right in the coming five years i request the leaders in every sector that we mentioned to be a part of this and see how we can make this happen in this country you",
