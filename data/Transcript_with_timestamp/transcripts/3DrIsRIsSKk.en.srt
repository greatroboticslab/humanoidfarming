00:00:00,230 --> 00:00:03,720
welcome to my view from the woods in

2
00:00:02,310 --> 00:00:05,250
today's video we're gonna transplant

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:07,470
some tomato and pepper plants that I

4
00:00:05,250 --> 00:00:09,300
started in early February some of them

5
00:00:07,470 --> 00:00:10,650
are doing pretty good other ones are a

6
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:14,340
little sickly and I want to give them a

7
00:00:10,650 --> 00:00:39,070
little boost this is how I'm gonna do it

8
00:00:14,340 --> 00:00:39,070
[Music]

9
00:00:41,280 --> 00:00:46,580
[Music]

10
00:00:44,350 --> 00:00:48,260
the first thing I do is make sure that I

11
00:00:46,580 --> 00:00:50,210
label them correctly so I just put the

12
00:00:48,260 --> 00:00:53,060
name these are gonna be Tiny Tim

13
00:00:50,210 --> 00:00:54,980
Tomatoes I started them on to eight and

14
00:00:53,060 --> 00:00:57,590
I'm transplanting today on three

15
00:00:54,980 --> 00:01:02,090
thirteen I put that on some tape so I

16
00:00:57,590 --> 00:01:05,720
can take it off on my salad cup and then

17
00:01:02,090 --> 00:01:07,640
I'll fill the cup with the on the

18
00:01:05,720 --> 00:01:09,920
side around the bottom where are they

19
00:01:07,640 --> 00:01:11,930
here we go so the ones that have the

20
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:13,540
slots cut in the bottom maybe you can

21
00:01:11,930 --> 00:01:16,550
see them better this way

22
00:01:13,540 --> 00:01:20,000
let me start did or when the cup

23
00:01:16,550 --> 00:01:22,580
slide it on I'll put the soil on the cup

24
00:01:20,000 --> 00:01:25,070
slotted on the bottom I don't really

25
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:27,290
label them because I generally keep them

26
00:01:25,070 --> 00:01:33,680
all together so just on the outside it's

27
00:01:27,290 --> 00:01:36,680
good so the first tomatoes I'm gonna do

28
00:01:33,680 --> 00:01:40,670
our Arctic rose tomatoes I did I planted

29
00:01:36,680 --> 00:01:42,590
these on February first I planted them I

30
00:01:40,670 --> 00:01:44,210
supposed to plant three seeds but you

31
00:01:42,590 --> 00:01:50,570
can see I kind of doubled two of them up

32
00:01:44,210 --> 00:01:54,320
so I have five plants in here so I've

33
00:01:50,570 --> 00:01:58,910
taken my cups with the slots in the

34
00:01:54,320 --> 00:02:00,619
bottom and fill them with potting soil

35
00:01:58,910 --> 00:02:02,690
her seed starting mix it's actually my

36
00:02:00,619 --> 00:02:04,160
that's announced a new mix it's not my

37
00:02:02,690 --> 00:02:05,780
seat started mixing sunny potting mix

38
00:02:04,160 --> 00:02:08,479
I'll talk more about that in another

39
00:02:05,780 --> 00:02:10,369
video I've just sort of sort of

40
00:02:08,479 --> 00:02:12,560
compacted the bottom half and then put a

41
00:02:10,369 --> 00:02:15,110
little divot into it what I'm gonna do

42
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:16,670
is take this spoon that I found at the

43
00:02:15,110 --> 00:02:19,310
dollar store the other day it's nice and

44
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:20,810
pointed I really like it it's gonna dig

45
00:02:19,310 --> 00:02:24,230
these out well I'm gonna dig these

46
00:02:20,810 --> 00:02:26,450
tomato plants out of this Cup lay them

47
00:02:24,230 --> 00:02:28,130
down on this cardboard that way I can

48
00:02:26,450 --> 00:02:31,250
just put the soil into my compost bin

49
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:35,240
and put the plants right into the new

50
00:02:31,250 --> 00:02:36,920
cups so let's get started on that so I'm

51
00:02:35,240 --> 00:02:41,209
just gonna go around the edges where I

52
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:43,819
can get the cup in or the spoon in dig

53
00:02:41,209 --> 00:02:48,160
it down under I don't know how big big

54
00:02:43,819 --> 00:02:48,160
the roots are and just sort of pry

55
00:02:49,219 --> 00:02:58,680
and then once they're loose sort of just

56
00:02:52,829 --> 00:03:03,920
dig around here where you can see it

57
00:02:58,680 --> 00:03:03,920
better and pull the plants out

58
00:03:04,780 --> 00:03:09,070
now I don't put this soil right back

59
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:10,750
into here I'm gonna compost this in case

60
00:03:09,070 --> 00:03:13,210
there's any problems or any issues in it

61
00:03:10,750 --> 00:03:15,160
that way I'm not spreading any diseases

62
00:03:13,210 --> 00:03:17,740
order funguses or anything that may be

63
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:22,510
in it I'll just restart it so here's my

64
00:03:17,740 --> 00:03:27,040
root ball my two plants you can see that

65
00:03:22,510 --> 00:03:30,660
well I'll put it in this hand and now I

66
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,660
just need to separate these two

67
00:03:31,940 --> 00:03:36,800
again that ideal I might cut these it

68
00:03:35,270 --> 00:03:40,670
really depends on how the root systems

69
00:03:36,800 --> 00:03:42,140
break apart especially since especially

70
00:03:40,670 --> 00:03:44,990
if you're new to the channel I'm

71
00:03:42,140 --> 00:03:47,570
planning these in an indoor garden so I

72
00:03:44,990 --> 00:03:49,670
don't need 30 tomato plants I'm gonna

73
00:03:47,570 --> 00:03:50,570
give the other ones away but instead of

74
00:03:49,670 --> 00:03:52,460
hurting a plant

75
00:03:50,570 --> 00:03:55,640
I might just want to sacrifice one so

76
00:03:52,460 --> 00:03:57,920
this one's a little bit wheat compared

77
00:03:55,640 --> 00:04:00,710
to this one I'm probably gonna clip this

78
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:03,250
one plant this clip this off in a few

79
00:04:00,710 --> 00:04:07,130
days and just let the one plant grow I

80
00:04:03,250 --> 00:04:09,200
think that's what I'll do that way I'm

81
00:04:07,130 --> 00:04:13,490
not gonna damage either of them I can

82
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,540
just cut the plant and have it live so

83
00:04:13,490 --> 00:04:20,000
I'm just gonna take this a little root

84
00:04:14,540 --> 00:04:21,830
ball put it into my divot and my cup get

85
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:25,810
it upright and then push some of the

86
00:04:21,830 --> 00:04:25,810
soil around it so it's upright

87
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:42,520
compact a little bit and then add a

88
00:04:37,930 --> 00:04:45,240
little bit more new soil and spread that

89
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:45,240
around the plant

90
00:04:50,600 --> 00:04:58,640
tomatoes you can plan a little bit

91
00:04:52,460 --> 00:05:00,110
deeper around the stem I try not to keep

92
00:04:58,640 --> 00:05:03,020
it as level as I can to where it was

93
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:04,940
growing and you can see I'll probably

94
00:05:03,020 --> 00:05:08,240
take this plant here and cut this one

95
00:05:04,940 --> 00:05:12,020
that I'm bending down off he's left with

96
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,520
this plant you see how it grows so let

97
00:05:12,020 --> 00:05:16,150
me repeat that through the other plants

98
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,150
and see how it goes

99
00:05:17,110 --> 00:05:21,830
make sure I put it in the right cup

100
00:05:19,310 --> 00:05:23,270
Karthik rose and I put the date again

101
00:05:21,830 --> 00:05:26,390
and I put the date on it if you can see

102
00:05:23,270 --> 00:05:29,420
it too once the plant date in 313 s a

103
00:05:26,390 --> 00:05:33,470
transplant date again this is the salad

104
00:05:29,420 --> 00:05:36,680
cup later on I'll be mixing up some

105
00:05:33,470 --> 00:05:39,470
fertilizer mix and I'll water gently

106
00:05:36,680 --> 00:05:43,430
from the top and then put water in the

107
00:05:39,470 --> 00:05:44,900
bottom Cup stick this Cup in it and the

108
00:05:43,430 --> 00:05:50,600
water will be absorbed through the

109
00:05:44,900 --> 00:05:53,830
medium and in through those holes so let

110
00:05:50,600 --> 00:05:53,830
me go through these elements real quick

111
00:05:55,150 --> 00:06:59,140
[Music]

112
00:06:56,190 --> 00:07:05,690
[Applause]

113
00:06:59,140 --> 00:07:08,660
[Music]

114
00:07:05,690 --> 00:07:13,229
[Applause]

115
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:13,229
[Music]

116
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:19,940
there we go it's a lot of those five

117
00:07:17,120 --> 00:07:23,480
plants I'm gonna get four and I'll

118
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:26,070
probably pick the two best throw those

119
00:07:23,480 --> 00:07:30,500
up you get the other ones away

120
00:07:26,070 --> 00:07:36,000
[Music]

121
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:38,349
other soil I just put my compost compost

122
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:39,699
[Music]

123
00:07:38,349 --> 00:07:40,899
I'll throw into the rest of these and

124
00:07:39,699 --> 00:07:43,689
then I'll get right back with you when I

125
00:07:40,899 --> 00:07:45,249
get on all the transplant stuff so

126
00:07:43,689 --> 00:07:47,710
here's what I ended up with I ended up

127
00:07:45,249 --> 00:07:50,770
with four plants of the Arctic Rose

128
00:07:47,710 --> 00:07:54,189
tomatoes and five of the jalapenos and

129
00:07:50,770 --> 00:07:56,830
then I ended up with six seven of the

130
00:07:54,189 --> 00:07:58,990
tiny arms are they tiny temps yeah the

131
00:07:56,830 --> 00:08:00,729
Tiny Tim's I'm gonna put a link below

132
00:07:58,990 --> 00:08:01,839
that shows you where I purchased these

133
00:08:00,729 --> 00:08:03,999
seeds you want to take a look at these

134
00:08:01,839 --> 00:08:05,680
varieties I'm really excited about this

135
00:08:03,999 --> 00:08:09,369
Tiny Tim I think that's gonna be a great

136
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:11,020
little indoor plant so I'm gonna put

137
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:13,719
these on my plant rack and then I'll

138
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,789
take you for a tour how I do that and

139
00:08:13,719 --> 00:08:17,199
what else I got growing I do have some

140
00:08:15,789 --> 00:08:19,659
more transplants to do but I'm not doing

141
00:08:17,199 --> 00:08:20,889
today I have to go to work and it's

142
00:08:19,659 --> 00:08:22,270
gonna be pretty miserable there's about

143
00:08:20,889 --> 00:08:24,759
six or eight inches of new snow out

144
00:08:22,270 --> 00:08:27,879
there today but such is life but I

145
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:29,699
rather work outdoors and indoors so

146
00:08:27,879 --> 00:08:31,990
let's take you over to the plant stand

147
00:08:29,699 --> 00:08:33,069
okay we're back to the plant table

148
00:08:31,990 --> 00:08:34,870
plants shelf

149
00:08:33,069 --> 00:08:36,639
plant something I don't know what I want

150
00:08:34,870 --> 00:08:37,899
to call it the planting area I guess now

151
00:08:36,639 --> 00:08:39,849
that's planning area was the other room

152
00:08:37,899 --> 00:08:41,500
so I guess this is the growing area on

153
00:08:39,849 --> 00:08:43,419
the shelf so I got the plants all set i

154
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:45,190
top watered the plants today I don't

155
00:08:43,419 --> 00:08:47,199
really have time to do a fertilization a

156
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:48,819
little bit of a process I'm gonna put

157
00:08:47,199 --> 00:08:50,230
that into a separate video and the

158
00:08:48,819 --> 00:08:51,819
reasons why I'm going through the

159
00:08:50,230 --> 00:08:54,730
process and just doing a simple

160
00:08:51,819 --> 00:08:56,500
fertilizer I think they're good reasons

161
00:08:54,730 --> 00:08:58,480
but I'll share with those you later so

162
00:08:56,500 --> 00:09:00,399
let's take a look at the plants as I

163
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:01,870
have them set up and I'm gonna talk

164
00:09:00,399 --> 00:09:04,510
about a couple of the problems that I

165
00:09:01,870 --> 00:09:07,180
think cause those transplants are cause

166
00:09:04,510 --> 00:09:10,089
those ceilings to be a little bit short

167
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:12,490
and weak so here's the transplants I

168
00:09:10,089 --> 00:09:16,060
have them under just some regular LED

169
00:09:12,490 --> 00:09:18,840
lights I'm gonna lower the lights when I

170
00:09:16,060 --> 00:09:21,780
get down to filming here

171
00:09:18,840 --> 00:09:24,180
these lights are from Home Depot

172
00:09:21,780 --> 00:09:25,500
they're just three-foot LEDs they seem

173
00:09:24,180 --> 00:09:28,440
to be doing pretty good with the plants

174
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:29,850
I had because I had again the colors

175
00:09:28,440 --> 00:09:34,770
because of the lights they're under now

176
00:09:29,850 --> 00:09:36,890
but I grew this lettuce salad mix under

177
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:39,120
those lights and it grew well as well as

178
00:09:36,890 --> 00:09:42,830
you can see them in the back those green

179
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:46,020
onions and a few little Swiss chard I

180
00:09:42,830 --> 00:09:48,870
still have some endive and some basil oh

181
00:09:46,020 --> 00:09:50,340
I'm gonna put into today's breakfast but

182
00:09:48,870 --> 00:09:52,110
reason they're purples because of the

183
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:54,300
lights are called unit fun lights I

184
00:09:52,110 --> 00:09:56,790
thought they would be great the reviews

185
00:09:54,300 --> 00:09:58,830
were good but I think they stunted the

186
00:09:56,790 --> 00:10:01,350
tomatoes and the pepper plants that

187
00:09:58,830 --> 00:10:04,200
along with my seeding mix the first time

188
00:10:01,350 --> 00:10:07,350
was a little dense I a sense of added

189
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:11,030
some perlite to it and what I planted in

190
00:10:07,350 --> 00:10:13,260
today is called royal gold basement mix

191
00:10:11,030 --> 00:10:14,580
it's a good planning mix it was

192
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:16,350
recommended to me I'm probably gonna

193
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:18,480
keep experimenting with planting mixes

194
00:10:16,350 --> 00:10:22,770
the reason I went with a mix instead of

195
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:26,070
making my own is because I don't have

196
00:10:22,770 --> 00:10:28,110
the room to compost all the forest

197
00:10:26,070 --> 00:10:31,590
products that are in the potting soils I

198
00:10:28,110 --> 00:10:33,450
want to use there's some basil and that

199
00:10:31,590 --> 00:10:34,890
there is some cilantro that I only

200
00:10:33,450 --> 00:10:38,310
putting in the pots and then these are

201
00:10:34,890 --> 00:10:40,560
the ones I transplanted today only top

202
00:10:38,310 --> 00:10:42,300
watered them back to the planting mixes

203
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:43,650
I don't have the room to compost all the

204
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:46,020
forest materials that are in the soils

205
00:10:43,650 --> 00:10:49,020
so I had to go with again a soilless mix

206
00:10:46,020 --> 00:10:50,550
I went with a coconut coir base but I

207
00:10:49,020 --> 00:10:52,830
think it's worked pretty good and the

208
00:10:50,550 --> 00:10:56,970
proof is in the pudding because here are

209
00:10:52,830 --> 00:10:59,460
some plants and be focus these plants

210
00:10:56,970 --> 00:11:02,730
are only 15 or 16 days old and they were

211
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:04,590
planted in that raw gold and I think the

212
00:11:02,730 --> 00:11:07,140
other thing is this Lighting's I'll step

213
00:11:04,590 --> 00:11:11,220
back these lights are the bulbs that

214
00:11:07,140 --> 00:11:13,260
just go into regular outlets they seem

215
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:14,790
to work really well you can see they're

216
00:11:13,260 --> 00:11:16,440
doing a great job on the microgreens

217
00:11:14,790 --> 00:11:19,170
here's some I just planted two days ago

218
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,580
here's a bunch of basil there's some

219
00:11:19,170 --> 00:11:22,850
cilantro let me turn the lights off see

220
00:11:20,580 --> 00:11:24,500
if that helps with the color

221
00:11:22,850 --> 00:11:29,990
they do have a little bit of color I

222
00:11:24,500 --> 00:11:33,529
guess it just gets too dark but I guess

223
00:11:29,990 --> 00:11:34,970
you can see the true color again I'll

224
00:11:33,529 --> 00:11:38,000
shut this head up it's gonna get dark

225
00:11:34,970 --> 00:11:42,980
but you can see the real they're nice

226
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:44,540
and green micro greens especially and

227
00:11:42,980 --> 00:11:47,060
then it tomato plants and peppers and

228
00:11:44,540 --> 00:11:51,589
cilantro so I think it's a combination

229
00:11:47,060 --> 00:11:54,769
of light and the mix so hopefully I got

230
00:11:51,589 --> 00:11:57,769
that straightened around again here's

231
00:11:54,769 --> 00:11:59,600
the ones I did today I think they're

232
00:11:57,769 --> 00:12:01,490
gonna grow a lot better what are these

233
00:11:59,600 --> 00:12:04,639
lights than they are going to under

234
00:12:01,490 --> 00:12:06,019
these unify mites so I don't know if I

235
00:12:04,639 --> 00:12:07,430
should put these on eBay I don't know

236
00:12:06,019 --> 00:12:09,949
how I feel about that whether I should

237
00:12:07,430 --> 00:12:11,829
just like to cut my losses and have them

238
00:12:09,949 --> 00:12:13,910
as backups or try them on something else

239
00:12:11,829 --> 00:12:16,160
high that's what I'll do I don't want to

240
00:12:13,910 --> 00:12:19,519
give anyone self I'll like to someone

241
00:12:16,160 --> 00:12:21,639
that I don't think works well so that's

242
00:12:19,519 --> 00:12:24,139
my video today

243
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:26,720
got some transplants the next time I go

244
00:12:24,139 --> 00:12:28,160
over my fertilizer routine and what I'm

245
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:30,500
not gonna recommend that the fertilizer

246
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:33,319
that I'm gonna do to anyone it's sort of

247
00:12:30,500 --> 00:12:35,480
complex so but there's reasons why and

248
00:12:33,319 --> 00:12:37,579
I'll explain them and I'll find a

249
00:12:35,480 --> 00:12:39,199
simpler method for everyone else so I'm

250
00:12:37,579 --> 00:12:41,449
gonna leave you on a note it's gonna

251
00:12:39,199 --> 00:12:42,850
take a while Cameron focus but you can

252
00:12:41,449 --> 00:12:45,340
just see what it's like
