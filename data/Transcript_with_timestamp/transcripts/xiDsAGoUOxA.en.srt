00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:14,080
in the last class we had

6
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,360
looked at

7
00:01:14,080 --> 00:01:19,040
the furrow irrigation method

8
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:21,280
and

9
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:25,119
we had also mentioned that besides those

10
00:01:21,280 --> 00:01:28,320
three conventional methods which have

11
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:31,439
become very popular over

12
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:34,320
the last many many centuries

13
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:35,920
the border irrigation

14
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:37,119
basin irrigation

15
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:39,040
and

16
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,439
the foreign irrigation

17
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,920
besides these two methods

18
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:46,320
are these three methods

19
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:48,880
there are some other methods which are

20
00:01:46,320 --> 00:01:50,960
variations of these methods

21
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:53,840
they are also

22
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,439
being used and some places where the

23
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,640
situations

24
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,640
weren't

25
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,920
those methods should be

26
00:01:58,640 --> 00:02:02,880
applied

27
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,759
either because of the the constraints

28
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:09,280
the financial constraints are

29
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:12,000
because the constraints of topography

30
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:15,200
or the soil type or the soil that all

31
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,879
those things put together they are

32
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,879
let's discuss

33
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:19,920
two of those methods

34
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:21,760
which

35
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:23,440
we had mentioned in the beginning these

36
00:02:21,760 --> 00:02:26,160
are

37
00:02:23,440 --> 00:02:26,160
contours

38
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:29,440
dutch

39
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,000
method

40
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:44,720
and the other one is contour leavey

41
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:46,640
method

42
00:02:44,720 --> 00:02:48,879
let's first look at

43
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:52,080
in the case of contoured edge

44
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,879
what type of layout we have

45
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:55,440
and

46
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:55,440
what it is

47
00:02:56,319 --> 00:03:02,159
suitable and with type of situations

48
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:05,120
this is the figure

49
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:07,360
of a contoured ditch irrigation method

50
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:09,280
you can see here that

51
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:10,319
as

52
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,159
there are

53
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,440
two ditches

54
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:17,120
there is one ditch this is another ditch

55
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:18,959
so what you have done is that you have

56
00:03:17,120 --> 00:03:20,319
laid the

57
00:03:18,959 --> 00:03:22,560
ditches

58
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,000
some ditches the size of the ditch can

59
00:03:22,560 --> 00:03:25,920
also vary

60
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:27,760
depending on how much

61
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:30,159
is the

62
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:33,920
stream size which is

63
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:37,680
possible or which you want to use

64
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,200
these ditches are laid on the contours

65
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:42,000
and then

66
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:44,560
you while irrigating the area

67
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:46,319
you make the openings in the ditches

68
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:48,400
and let

69
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,080
the area be flooded

70
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:51,360
so this is basically

71
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:53,360
a method of

72
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:55,840
wild flooding

73
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:59,159
this is a method of

74
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:59,159
wild flooding

75
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:04,000
in which

76
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:04,000
you have ditches

77
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:08,640
which can be spaced

78
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,439
about

79
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:15,519
20

80
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:18,479
to 25 meters

81
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:21,519
and we go up to 100 meters

82
00:04:18,479 --> 00:04:23,120
the spacing between the ditches

83
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:26,880
can be

84
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:28,960
varying between 20 to 100 meters

85
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,960
that means the area

86
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:33,520
which will be covering

87
00:04:30,960 --> 00:04:37,840
from this end to the sand

88
00:04:33,520 --> 00:04:40,960
can be a a wide area in case you have

89
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:43,600
the infiltration rates are lower

90
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,040
if the infiltration rates are higher

91
00:04:43,600 --> 00:04:48,000
then you might

92
00:04:45,040 --> 00:04:50,560
restrict the weight between the ditches

93
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,880
so that is that is up to the you have to

94
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,440
look at many other conditions also the

95
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:59,199
soil type and then the slope

96
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:59,199
the slopes in this case is

97
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,720
again the

98
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:08,000
slope variation can be

99
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,440
quite excessive you can use this

100
00:05:08,000 --> 00:05:12,160
this method of

101
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:15,520
contoured edge

102
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:18,000
on slopes which are as low as 0.15

103
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:20,560
or even higher slopes

104
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,560
but again the restriction will be that

105
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:25,600
what is the slope

106
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:28,320
along with the soil type which is not

107
00:05:25,600 --> 00:05:29,919
creating any erosion problems

108
00:05:28,320 --> 00:05:32,000
and the stream size which you are going

109
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:33,919
to use they are they are comparatively

110
00:05:32,000 --> 00:05:35,840
higher stream sizes

111
00:05:33,919 --> 00:05:38,320
you are flooding the areas you can

112
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:41,120
afford to use the higher stream sizes if

113
00:05:38,320 --> 00:05:43,039
the areas are flatter areas if the areas

114
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,400
are steeper areas you might

115
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:48,240
reduce the stream size so in this method

116
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:50,080
is not basically a

117
00:05:48,240 --> 00:05:52,560
method which is a very sophisticated

118
00:05:50,080 --> 00:05:54,320
method you are using this method because

119
00:05:52,560 --> 00:05:56,720
of the fact that you want to

120
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:58,720
make use of the existing conditions

121
00:05:56,720 --> 00:06:01,440
and you don't want to indulge

122
00:05:58,720 --> 00:06:02,720
much expense which is

123
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:05,120
involved in

124
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:07,680
forming the area or

125
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:08,720
grading the area so the adaptability if

126
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:11,600
you look at

127
00:06:08,720 --> 00:06:11,600
where these methods

128
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:20,800
from the adaptability point of view

129
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,960
you will find this

130
00:06:20,800 --> 00:06:24,400
method to be quite useful

131
00:06:22,960 --> 00:06:26,960
when you are talking in terms of

132
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,960
foothills

133
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:32,639
those areas which are lying on the

134
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,680
foothills which are

135
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:38,160
having slight undulations but not the

136
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
slopes are not very steep but the same

137
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:41,039
time

138
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:43,520
you cannot afford to

139
00:06:41,039 --> 00:06:45,919
form these areas or relay these areas

140
00:06:43,520 --> 00:06:49,599
because of the fact that the soil depth

141
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:52,880
is quite shallow so if you try to reform

142
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:54,560
these areas or you go in for the grading

143
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,160
of these areas

144
00:06:54,560 --> 00:06:57,120
you will find that the

145
00:06:56,160 --> 00:06:59,680
soil

146
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,560
the fertile soil will be

147
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
lost

148
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:08,000
you might be having a very small depth

149
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
which you cannot manipulate you cannot

150
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:12,560
you cannot

151
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:16,319
grade that soil because of

152
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:19,120
the loss in fertility and as such the

153
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:21,520
the depth of soil available is very

154
00:07:19,120 --> 00:07:21,520
shallow

155
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:23,840
then

156
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:28,400
that is

157
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:30,080
involving very low cost

158
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:32,560
on those accounts because you don't need

159
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:33,840
any in this case there is no

160
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,400
land grading

161
00:07:33,840 --> 00:07:36,400
required

162
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:41,840
the ditches are also

163
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,599
unlined

164
00:07:41,840 --> 00:07:46,319
so there also you can

165
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,319
save lot of

166
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:52,400
expenses

167
00:07:49,360 --> 00:07:54,800
then the labor expense is also not very

168
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:58,319
excessive because

169
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,479
the places at which you have to make the

170
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:01,520
the openings

171
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:04,560
as

172
00:08:01,520 --> 00:08:07,520
is not a very skilled thing with slight

173
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:09,199
amount of experience you will know that

174
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:11,759
at what spacing because that will be a

175
00:08:09,199 --> 00:08:14,319
function of spread of the water

176
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,160
up to which area the water can spread so

177
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:18,080
it is not a very scientific method is

178
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:20,080
only a method which

179
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:21,039
may be used under some circumstances

180
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,240
where

181
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,400
you

182
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:26,639
don't have any other

183
00:08:24,400 --> 00:08:28,319
possibility of using the other method

184
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,000
because of various reasons which we have

185
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,000
just discussed

186
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:36,240
let's quickly go down to the next method

187
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:36,240
of

188
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,000
contour leave me

189
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:51,360
which again

190
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:51,360
is

191
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:55,600
quite similar in terms of the previous

192
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:58,560
method which you have discussed because

193
00:08:55,600 --> 00:08:59,680
in this case also you use this method

194
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:03,120
where

195
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:06,240
the situations or the conditions

196
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,240
don't warrant any

197
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:10,959
land grading or land shaping because of

198
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:11,680
various reasons

199
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:13,360
and

200
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,000
in this method

201
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:17,680
you are not using

202
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:19,360
the ditches

203
00:09:17,680 --> 00:09:21,760
but you are using the natural slope

204
00:09:19,360 --> 00:09:25,120
which is available available in the area

205
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:27,920
so if you look at this

206
00:09:25,120 --> 00:09:27,920
this is a strip

207
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,240
this is a strip

208
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,640
which is not a parallel strip as you

209
00:09:32,240 --> 00:09:36,560
have in the case of borders

210
00:09:34,640 --> 00:09:38,720
in the case of border irrigation you are

211
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:41,600
trying to make the steps parallel so

212
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:44,320
that you can have a very uniform

213
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:47,040
flow over the strip in this case

214
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:48,959
there is some

215
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,360
the

216
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,880
the slope may be in this direction there

217
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:54,160
is a gentle slope

218
00:09:52,880 --> 00:09:56,080
so you have

219
00:09:54,160 --> 00:09:58,160
try to

220
00:09:56,080 --> 00:10:00,000
utilize that slope

221
00:09:58,160 --> 00:10:02,800
which is

222
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:05,200
in this particular case the slope

223
00:10:02,800 --> 00:10:07,680
will be in this direction because you

224
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,560
are supplying the water

225
00:10:07,680 --> 00:10:11,040
from

226
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,160
some upstream end to the downstream end

227
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:13,760
and this

228
00:10:12,160 --> 00:10:16,000
strip

229
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:17,839
and this strip you have not

230
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,279
you have tried to use the contours these

231
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:21,200
are the natural

232
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:22,640
contours

233
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:25,440
which

234
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:27,440
might be having some downslope

235
00:10:25,440 --> 00:10:29,360
because unless the slope is there you

236
00:10:27,440 --> 00:10:32,399
might find that the water might not move

237
00:10:29,360 --> 00:10:34,000
in a in the lateral direction and

238
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:36,720
longitudinal direction

239
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,399
so you have to have some slight

240
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:40,320
slope otherwise

241
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:41,600
the size of the stream will have to be

242
00:10:40,320 --> 00:10:43,120
very excessive

243
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:45,440
and the slopes are less the lesser the

244
00:10:43,120 --> 00:10:47,040
slope to cover larger area you'll have

245
00:10:45,440 --> 00:10:48,959
to have excessive

246
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:50,000
stream size but that can only happen if

247
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,320
the soil

248
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:55,120
type is

249
00:10:52,320 --> 00:10:57,600
as conducive to that

250
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:59,680
higher stream sizes

251
00:10:57,600 --> 00:11:01,680
so in this case you have the ridges

252
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,200
which are separating which are going

253
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,519
parallel to

254
00:11:03,200 --> 00:11:07,519
each other not exactly parallel but they

255
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,120
are going along the

256
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,920
the strip

257
00:11:09,120 --> 00:11:12,880
and on this side

258
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:15,040
you are

259
00:11:12,880 --> 00:11:17,120
having

260
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:19,040
two ridges which are perpendicular one

261
00:11:17,120 --> 00:11:20,079
ridge here the other edge at this

262
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:21,040
location

263
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,240
so this

264
00:11:21,040 --> 00:11:26,560
channel can be used to collect the

265
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:28,480
surplus water which may be used in the

266
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:31,440
next step

267
00:11:28,480 --> 00:11:32,480
so this is again a method of flooding

268
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:34,079
where

269
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:35,600
you are not flooding

270
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,079
in the same manner as you are doing in

271
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:40,480
the ditch and dutch method where the

272
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:43,120
water was flowing along the ditch

273
00:11:40,480 --> 00:11:44,399
in this case the water is flowing

274
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:45,600
at some

275
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:47,760
field channel

276
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,680
which is at the upstream end so you

277
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,120
release the water from there it moves

278
00:11:49,680 --> 00:11:52,160
into this

279
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,639
and

280
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:57,600
then the surplus amount is collected it

281
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:59,120
might go to the next field so is

282
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:01,040
normally used where you have the field

283
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,320
to field flooding

284
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:03,519
in areas

285
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:05,760
where

286
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,839
for example the delta areas

287
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,839
where you don't have any problem of

288
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,760
the amount of water available

289
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:12,800
in our kaveri delta

290
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,200
region

291
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,600
we are using this method

292
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:22,560
where you are letting the water flow

293
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:22,560
from one area into another area and

294
00:12:23,279 --> 00:12:27,680
with the consequence that most of the

295
00:12:25,040 --> 00:12:30,560
time the water might be standing there

296
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:31,279
so that is the reason that you are using

297
00:12:30,560 --> 00:12:32,320
the

298
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:34,160
paddy

299
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:36,000
the petty crop is quite popular in those

300
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:38,560
areas

301
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:41,519
because patty needs the quite a lot of

302
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,279
water and in this method you can provide

303
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:45,440
that water because the water

304
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,000
is coming from one field going to the

305
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:49,760
next field going to the next field and

306
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:50,839
that continues

307
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:52,560
and

308
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:54,560
this

309
00:12:52,560 --> 00:12:56,399
method can also be used for

310
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,240
other crops which are not very sensitive

311
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,720
crops

312
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:03,040
for example the grasses can be

313
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,000
this method can be used

314
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:07,600
the

315
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:09,440
other top can be uh for the crops again

316
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:11,279
you can use this method you might not

317
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:13,120
have that continuous supply you might

318
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,839
have intermittent supply

319
00:13:13,120 --> 00:13:18,880
because the further crops again

320
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,360
they cannot sustain that longer

321
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,639
inundation

322
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:23,360
so

323
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:26,000
the

324
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:29,920
adaptability of this method

325
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:29,920
again is quite similar that you are

326
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:33,360
you can use it

327
00:13:31,600 --> 00:13:34,480
for those areas

328
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:37,360
where

329
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:37,360
you don't have any

330
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:40,480
any

331
00:13:41,600 --> 00:13:47,760
availability of excess labor the labor

332
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:49,680
costs are very less in this case

333
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:52,320
the otherwise

334
00:13:49,680 --> 00:13:53,360
land farming cost can also be reduced by

335
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:55,920
not

336
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:57,040
grading the areas even if there is some

337
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:58,800
problem

338
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:01,199
in terms of the levels

339
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:02,639
you might since the depth of water is

340
00:14:01,199 --> 00:14:05,600
quite excessive

341
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:07,440
so the distribution might not be uniform

342
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:09,680
but the same time

343
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:11,120
and

344
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:14,079
the distribution

345
00:14:11,120 --> 00:14:18,320
loss can be compensated by the

346
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:19,360
the amount of expense which is safe

347
00:14:18,320 --> 00:14:21,600
so

348
00:14:19,360 --> 00:14:22,320
these methods

349
00:14:21,600 --> 00:14:24,639
are

350
00:14:22,320 --> 00:14:27,120
not a general purpose method they are

351
00:14:24,639 --> 00:14:28,880
specific purpose methods where

352
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:30,720
you can

353
00:14:28,880 --> 00:14:31,920
you can justify these methods in some

354
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,120
conditions

355
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:36,720
under some situations where either

356
00:14:35,120 --> 00:14:38,560
the suitability

357
00:14:36,720 --> 00:14:39,680
or the economic conditions of the

358
00:14:38,560 --> 00:14:40,480
farmers

359
00:14:39,680 --> 00:14:42,800
are

360
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:44,399
the type of crop which are growing

361
00:14:42,800 --> 00:14:45,519
they are the

362
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:47,440
the major

363
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:48,320
deciding factors

364
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,519
so

365
00:14:48,320 --> 00:14:50,800
with that

366
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:52,160
we will

367
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:54,399
conclude

368
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
the

369
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,680
the methods

370
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,920
which are surface irrigation methods as

371
00:14:57,680 --> 00:15:03,279
we have defined in the beginning

372
00:14:59,920 --> 00:15:04,079
we go down to the next class

373
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:07,920
of

374
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:10,000
irrigation methods which we were

375
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,320
which we had

376
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:14,079
started with

377
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:17,680
along the surface irrigation method we

378
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:17,680
had said the subsurface

379
00:15:23,839 --> 00:15:28,160
irrigation

380
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:28,160
method

381
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:40,360
and this category of

382
00:15:36,800 --> 00:15:40,360
irrigation method

383
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:46,399
we are supplying water

384
00:15:50,880 --> 00:15:54,440
water is applied

385
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:06,120
below the ground surface

386
00:16:11,199 --> 00:16:14,880
so this is the basic

387
00:16:12,880 --> 00:16:16,720
difference between the

388
00:16:14,880 --> 00:16:18,800
surface irrigation method

389
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:20,320
and the subsurface irrigation method in

390
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:22,399
the case of surface rehabilitation

391
00:16:20,320 --> 00:16:23,759
method we have seen that we are making

392
00:16:22,399 --> 00:16:25,839
use of the

393
00:16:23,759 --> 00:16:27,759
gravity flow

394
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,839
but the water is traveling over the

395
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,120
surface of the

396
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:33,440
the

397
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,120
soil on the ground

398
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:36,880
whereas in the case of subsurface

399
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:38,720
irrigation

400
00:16:36,880 --> 00:16:40,160
the water is not traveling over the

401
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:44,560
surface of the

402
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:45,839
ground but is travelling within the

403
00:16:44,560 --> 00:16:48,399
ground surface

404
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,199
below the ground surface

405
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,720
now

406
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:55,759
what kind of method this can be

407
00:16:52,720 --> 00:16:58,079
if you just try to visualize

408
00:16:55,759 --> 00:17:00,720
you will find that

409
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,240
the typical

410
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:07,039
suppose this is your

411
00:17:04,240 --> 00:17:07,039
ground surface

412
00:17:07,839 --> 00:17:12,400
now if you

413
00:17:09,520 --> 00:17:13,839
want to make the

414
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,679
waters

415
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:19,439
because the root zone that we know

416
00:17:17,679 --> 00:17:21,760
there's the roots on depth

417
00:17:19,439 --> 00:17:22,959
and which we are interested in

418
00:17:21,760 --> 00:17:25,679
we want to

419
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:27,039
supply moisture to the root zone that

420
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,240
this area

421
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:29,919
because the

422
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,280
the plant root system

423
00:17:29,919 --> 00:17:32,880
is

424
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:35,039
in this area

425
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:35,039
and

426
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:40,960
because of that fact

427
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:40,960
this needs moisture

428
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:44,240
in the case of subsurface irrigation

429
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:47,440
there is

430
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:51,200
a way out that the possible

431
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:51,200
solutions are that you either

432
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:59,320
provide that

433
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:59,320
some sort of ditch

434
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:04,400
you have a date

435
00:18:02,799 --> 00:18:07,440
where you

436
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:07,440
control the water

437
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:12,480
you have a ditch

438
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:14,880
where you have

439
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:16,960
this is the water level

440
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:19,600
now this water level

441
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:21,679
is under your control

442
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:23,840
what will happen if you maintain this

443
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:25,360
water level here

444
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:27,200
and if the groundwater table is

445
00:18:25,360 --> 00:18:30,400
somewhere

446
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:30,400
down below

447
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:34,960
depending on what type of soil you're

448
00:18:33,679 --> 00:18:36,880
using

449
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:39,600
what type of soil is prevailing

450
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:39,600
there will be some

451
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:45,039
flow from this area into this area

452
00:18:43,440 --> 00:18:46,880
some water will

453
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:48,559
flow into the

454
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:50,400
resonance

455
00:18:48,559 --> 00:18:52,400
again it will be a function of how much

456
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:54,400
water will flow will be function of what

457
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:55,200
is the wetness of the soil

458
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:57,440
and

459
00:18:55,200 --> 00:18:59,200
what is the relative location of the

460
00:18:57,440 --> 00:19:01,520
groundwater table

461
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:03,120
and the groundwater table is very low

462
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:05,440
most of the water might

463
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,799
go down some water might go into the

464
00:19:05,440 --> 00:19:09,679
lateral direction as we have seen in the

465
00:19:06,799 --> 00:19:11,760
case of furrow irrigation

466
00:19:09,679 --> 00:19:13,679
but this

467
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,280
situation

468
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:19,440
when you use the subsurface irrigation

469
00:19:17,280 --> 00:19:21,679
we are basically using the segregation

470
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:24,880
when the groundwater table is already

471
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:26,320
very is quite high you don't use this

472
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:29,120
irrigation when the groundwater tables

473
00:19:26,320 --> 00:19:30,960
are very low because in that case most

474
00:19:29,120 --> 00:19:32,720
of the water which will be

475
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:34,320
making available in the ditches because

476
00:19:32,720 --> 00:19:36,320
this water has to be made available

477
00:19:34,320 --> 00:19:37,600
artificially you have to bring this

478
00:19:36,320 --> 00:19:39,520
water from

479
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:41,679
some supply source

480
00:19:39,520 --> 00:19:43,919
this source can be either the canal

481
00:19:41,679 --> 00:19:45,919
water or it can be

482
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:48,480
the groundwater which you have pumped

483
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:52,080
and put into the channel system

484
00:19:48,480 --> 00:19:54,720
it can be any any source

485
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:54,720
so this

486
00:19:56,640 --> 00:20:01,039
the level which you have created here in

487
00:19:59,039 --> 00:20:04,880
the ditch and

488
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:06,480
the level which is the groundwater table

489
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:07,360
if the groundwater table is somewhere

490
00:20:06,480 --> 00:20:09,280
here

491
00:20:07,360 --> 00:20:11,520
you will find that after some time there

492
00:20:09,280 --> 00:20:13,919
will be some

493
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:17,120
level stabilization

494
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:19,280
if you keep on supplying this water

495
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:21,600
there will be some flow

496
00:20:19,280 --> 00:20:23,440
from the ditch into this area and the

497
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:26,080
water table

498
00:20:23,440 --> 00:20:27,280
might come up locally

499
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:29,760
now this

500
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:30,880
this rise in water table

501
00:20:29,760 --> 00:20:33,360
is

502
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:36,000
within your control

503
00:20:33,360 --> 00:20:37,760
if you find let me

504
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
put this here again

505
00:20:37,760 --> 00:20:42,240
that if i have

506
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:44,000
a ditch which is

507
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:46,480
along a ditch

508
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,840
if i have

509
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:49,840
this is the ditch

510
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:53,360
now in this particular case

511
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,640
by controlling the level of water

512
00:20:59,120 --> 00:21:03,120
if my

513
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,559
previous water table was

514
00:21:03,120 --> 00:21:05,679
this is the water table which i have

515
00:21:04,559 --> 00:21:07,760
established

516
00:21:05,679 --> 00:21:10,400
after a long

517
00:21:07,760 --> 00:21:12,480
um after controlling this level for a

518
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,480
long party period you'll find that this

519
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,400
doesn't stabilize the water will keep on

520
00:21:14,480 --> 00:21:18,400
moving on this side and

521
00:21:16,400 --> 00:21:20,640
depending on the soil type the soil type

522
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,960
is quite porous this might be

523
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:25,360
achieved relatively

524
00:21:22,960 --> 00:21:26,880
in a quicker manner

525
00:21:25,360 --> 00:21:28,960
now

526
00:21:26,880 --> 00:21:30,720
if this is

527
00:21:28,960 --> 00:21:33,120
the

528
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:34,640
the level here

529
00:21:33,120 --> 00:21:38,000
which i have attained

530
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:41,039
it has become quite excessive

531
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:43,280
i can reduce this level

532
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:44,559
by removing water from

533
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:46,799
the ditch

534
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:50,559
this will come down

535
00:21:46,799 --> 00:21:50,559
initially it will be like this

536
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,760
after some time

537
00:21:52,400 --> 00:21:55,440
it might

538
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:56,240
become

539
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:00,559
this

540
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:01,679
and after some more time it will

541
00:22:00,559 --> 00:22:04,159
this will be

542
00:22:01,679 --> 00:22:04,159
achieved

543
00:22:04,799 --> 00:22:09,919
this fluctuation

544
00:22:06,799 --> 00:22:11,360
is what is in your control

545
00:22:09,919 --> 00:22:13,440
and that is what you do in the case of

546
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:15,679
subsurface irrigation

547
00:22:13,440 --> 00:22:17,760
the design parameters which you have to

548
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:18,960
look at when you design the subsurface

549
00:22:17,760 --> 00:22:20,320
irrigation

550
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:22,240
are

551
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:25,200
what should be the

552
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:27,039
spacing between the ditches

553
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:28,320
is that will decide

554
00:22:27,039 --> 00:22:30,400
up to

555
00:22:28,320 --> 00:22:32,240
what level

556
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:33,919
the water table when you when you

557
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,480
control these

558
00:22:33,919 --> 00:22:38,400
levels of water and the ditches

559
00:22:36,480 --> 00:22:41,200
how much time it will take

560
00:22:38,400 --> 00:22:44,559
for the water to drop down to the level

561
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:46,080
desired level how much time how quickly

562
00:22:44,559 --> 00:22:48,559
it will do that because that is a

563
00:22:46,080 --> 00:22:50,960
function of the soil type what is the

564
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,200
hydraulic conductivity of the soil

565
00:22:50,960 --> 00:22:54,720
as that will decide the movement of the

566
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:57,280
water into soil

567
00:22:54,720 --> 00:23:00,400
so depending on the soil type

568
00:22:57,280 --> 00:23:02,640
you can design what should be the

569
00:23:00,400 --> 00:23:03,840
the spacing between the

570
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:06,400
the ditches

571
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:08,480
you can also design

572
00:23:06,400 --> 00:23:10,720
the other parameter will be what should

573
00:23:08,480 --> 00:23:12,880
the depth of the ridge

574
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:16,799
that will give you the flexibility on

575
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,799
up to what level you can control that

576
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,080
the water depth

577
00:23:21,600 --> 00:23:24,480
then you can also

578
00:23:24,720 --> 00:23:27,840
decide on what should be the size of the

579
00:23:26,320 --> 00:23:29,919
ditch so these are some of the

580
00:23:27,840 --> 00:23:31,600
parameters which you'll

581
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:33,600
design

582
00:23:31,600 --> 00:23:36,480
now this is one option available that

583
00:23:33,600 --> 00:23:39,039
you have the ditches

584
00:23:36,480 --> 00:23:41,440
if you want to

585
00:23:39,039 --> 00:23:42,880
choose another option which

586
00:23:41,440 --> 00:23:45,760
is quite a

587
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,360
usual option you might replace

588
00:23:45,760 --> 00:23:49,360
these ditches

589
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:52,400
with

590
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,400
the circular pipes

591
00:23:52,720 --> 00:23:55,360
you have this

592
00:23:57,440 --> 00:24:01,600
instead of having

593
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,960
ditches you can have underground pipes

594
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,840
which are having

595
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:08,559
perforations

596
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:11,679
the water passes through these pipes

597
00:24:08,559 --> 00:24:13,919
and it gets it does the same job

598
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,200
as is being done by the

599
00:24:13,919 --> 00:24:17,520
letters

600
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:20,799
in that case you can save the area which

601
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:23,760
is utilized by the leches

602
00:24:20,799 --> 00:24:26,320
so that much area can be saved

603
00:24:23,760 --> 00:24:27,600
and this situation also again

604
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:29,120
you will have to

605
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:30,559
decide

606
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,720
what will be the depth up to which you

607
00:24:30,559 --> 00:24:35,440
have to lay down the pipe what will be

608
00:24:32,720 --> 00:24:38,000
the spacing between the

609
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,000
the pipes

610
00:24:39,279 --> 00:24:43,360
and

611
00:24:40,400 --> 00:24:44,720
what size of the pipe has to be used

612
00:24:43,360 --> 00:24:45,679
these are some of the parameters which

613
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,240
will be

614
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,919
needed to design the system how the

615
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:52,240
system should be laid out

616
00:24:49,919 --> 00:24:54,320
and that will be also a function of what

617
00:24:52,240 --> 00:24:57,039
type of crops you are

618
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:57,039
utilizing

619
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:02,159
these methods whether it's uh

620
00:25:02,400 --> 00:25:07,120
whether you're using the ditch or

621
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:08,720
whether you're using the perforated pipe

622
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:11,360
and a ground pipe

623
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:12,640
for the subsurface irrigation

624
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:15,120
in general

625
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:17,600
you'll find that the suitability of this

626
00:25:15,120 --> 00:25:17,600
method

627
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:22,000
is quite

628
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,039
is not

629
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:30,799
used at many many places there are a lot

630
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:32,480
of restrictions in the sense that

631
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,080
you have to

632
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:35,679
use this method

633
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:37,360
where you have

634
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,960
the water table

635
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:41,960
is quite

636
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:41,960
high

637
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:53,120
you cannot choose this method with the

638
00:25:50,320 --> 00:25:55,760
water tables are very low because

639
00:25:53,120 --> 00:25:57,919
as we have discussed that it

640
00:25:55,760 --> 00:26:00,960
lose lot of water and

641
00:25:57,919 --> 00:26:00,960
as depoculation

642
00:26:02,640 --> 00:26:09,480
you should use this method only when

643
00:26:05,679 --> 00:26:09,480
the celerity is

644
00:26:14,080 --> 00:26:16,799
is quite low

645
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:22,559
because if the celebrity is high

646
00:26:20,559 --> 00:26:24,720
then by

647
00:26:22,559 --> 00:26:26,720
what it does is that since the water

648
00:26:24,720 --> 00:26:27,919
table in that area will be already very

649
00:26:26,720 --> 00:26:30,559
high

650
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:32,400
now as you

651
00:26:30,559 --> 00:26:35,279
use this method

652
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:35,279
the chances of

653
00:26:36,000 --> 00:26:38,960
evaporation

654
00:26:37,360 --> 00:26:40,240
because the water will be

655
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:42,880
coming to the

656
00:26:40,240 --> 00:26:45,440
the top of the ground level

657
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:47,679
because of the capillary rise

658
00:26:45,440 --> 00:26:49,440
that is one of the way by which your

659
00:26:47,679 --> 00:26:51,279
your root system is getting water so if

660
00:26:49,440 --> 00:26:53,679
the salinity is very high

661
00:26:51,279 --> 00:26:55,760
the chances of

662
00:26:53,679 --> 00:26:56,799
salts coming to the top of the

663
00:26:55,760 --> 00:26:58,480
soil

664
00:26:56,799 --> 00:27:00,080
is very high because of the evaporation

665
00:26:58,480 --> 00:27:03,120
from the soil

666
00:27:00,080 --> 00:27:05,039
so uh you avoid this method when you

667
00:27:03,120 --> 00:27:07,840
have the low the

668
00:27:05,039 --> 00:27:07,840
the high salinity

669
00:27:07,919 --> 00:27:11,120
in the water

670
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:12,320
then you you should

671
00:27:11,120 --> 00:27:14,720
avoid this

672
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,720
method

673
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:17,600
then

674
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,840
is suitable when the

675
00:27:22,880 --> 00:27:25,919
soil surfaces

676
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:30,480
is leveled

677
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:36,640
because this method the type of control

678
00:27:35,039 --> 00:27:37,919
which you are talking about

679
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:40,320
if the

680
00:27:37,919 --> 00:27:42,720
the area is having a lot of slope then

681
00:27:40,320 --> 00:27:45,039
the ditches won't function very well

682
00:27:42,720 --> 00:27:46,159
especially in the case of ditches

683
00:27:45,039 --> 00:27:47,679
you are

684
00:27:46,159 --> 00:27:50,240
trying to have

685
00:27:47,679 --> 00:27:52,159
the ditches where the water is

686
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,159
only being maintained with respect to

687
00:27:52,159 --> 00:27:55,360
the input which you are giving

688
00:27:54,159 --> 00:27:57,600
into the ditch

689
00:27:55,360 --> 00:27:59,360
and the levels are maintained from one

690
00:27:57,600 --> 00:28:01,679
area to another area

691
00:27:59,360 --> 00:28:03,600
you don't make the water

692
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,279
run

693
00:28:03,600 --> 00:28:07,440
with velocity

694
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,520
as only maintaining the levels of the

695
00:28:07,440 --> 00:28:11,919
water so

696
00:28:09,520 --> 00:28:12,960
most of the time you will try to use

697
00:28:11,919 --> 00:28:15,440
this

698
00:28:12,960 --> 00:28:17,840
this method when the level

699
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:18,960
the areas are very well leveled there

700
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:20,399
are

701
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:21,679
flat areas

702
00:28:20,399 --> 00:28:23,279
and you are

703
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:24,880
you're not bothered about the flow of

704
00:28:23,279 --> 00:28:26,880
water because

705
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,440
you are making the water they are all

706
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:31,840
interconnected ditches so once you put

707
00:28:29,440 --> 00:28:33,919
the water in one location

708
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:34,880
the water will automatically move

709
00:28:33,919 --> 00:28:36,559
into the

710
00:28:34,880 --> 00:28:37,440
other locations also

711
00:28:36,559 --> 00:28:40,480
and

712
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,960
this method is quite successful when you

713
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,720
have that type of topography

714
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:46,640
to give me an example

715
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:49,840
this method is

716
00:28:46,640 --> 00:28:52,159
very successful in holland

717
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:54,640
in holland

718
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:56,799
as you might be knowing that the holland

719
00:28:54,640 --> 00:28:57,760
the general level is below the mean sea

720
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:00,559
level

721
00:28:57,760 --> 00:29:03,120
so there they are using a lot of dikes

722
00:29:00,559 --> 00:29:04,000
to keep the sea water away from their

723
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:05,039
land

724
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:07,520
and there

725
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:08,960
for the florida culture the tulip

726
00:29:07,520 --> 00:29:11,960
cultivation is

727
00:29:08,960 --> 00:29:11,960
being

728
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:17,039
being done using this method of the

729
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:18,240
uh

730
00:29:17,039 --> 00:29:21,200
the

731
00:29:18,240 --> 00:29:22,159
subsurface irrigation method

732
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,919
there

733
00:29:22,159 --> 00:29:27,440
you will find that

734
00:29:23,919 --> 00:29:28,559
the water table is already accessibly

735
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:30,640
high

736
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:33,200
so they are controlling

737
00:29:30,640 --> 00:29:35,440
the water in the ditch

738
00:29:33,200 --> 00:29:37,200
and maintaining that level

739
00:29:35,440 --> 00:29:38,720
either by pumping the water out of the

740
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,960
ditch

741
00:29:38,720 --> 00:29:45,200
most of the time so that they can keep

742
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,200
the level at a desirable level

743
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:51,360
then

744
00:29:51,919 --> 00:29:56,559
another suitable condition should be

745
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,559
that

746
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:04,480
the soil should be

747
00:30:01,520 --> 00:30:04,480
relatively porous

748
00:30:05,760 --> 00:30:12,159
so that you don't have to

749
00:30:09,520 --> 00:30:13,360
use very small spacing between the

750
00:30:12,159 --> 00:30:15,840
riches

751
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:17,039
your spacing but to have the spacing

752
00:30:15,840 --> 00:30:18,880
large enough

753
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:21,039
you should have the soils which are

754
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,440
porous soil so that the water can

755
00:30:21,039 --> 00:30:26,320
really travel fast within the

756
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:28,000
ground and it can stabilize

757
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:29,520
maintain that level which you are trying

758
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,640
to

759
00:30:29,520 --> 00:30:33,760
control

760
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:35,760
so from those angles i think

761
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:37,279
you will

762
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:39,760
you will

763
00:30:37,279 --> 00:30:41,919
get a feeling that this method is again

764
00:30:39,760 --> 00:30:44,000
a method which is

765
00:30:41,919 --> 00:30:45,679
which has a lot of restrictions

766
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,840
and it cannot be a

767
00:30:45,679 --> 00:30:48,640
method of

768
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,360
very

769
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:52,559
usual nature it is a specific purpose

770
00:30:51,360 --> 00:30:54,799
method

771
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,320
with a suitability only in the

772
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:59,120
circumstances where you have these

773
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:59,120
conditions met

774
00:31:00,960 --> 00:31:04,480
let's go to the

775
00:31:02,559 --> 00:31:06,799
last class

776
00:31:04,480 --> 00:31:08,559
of methods which we had defined in the

777
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:10,320
beginning

778
00:31:08,559 --> 00:31:13,039
that was

779
00:31:10,320 --> 00:31:13,039
pressurized

780
00:31:17,279 --> 00:31:19,840
irrigation

781
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:31,159
pressure aggregation method

782
00:31:35,039 --> 00:31:37,840
this method is

783
00:31:38,880 --> 00:31:44,320
in general

784
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:44,320
is the one where you have

785
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:47,840
application

786
00:31:51,600 --> 00:31:54,159
of water

787
00:31:57,679 --> 00:32:01,159
as through pressures

788
00:32:04,880 --> 00:32:07,880
devices

789
00:32:16,880 --> 00:32:21,440
and again as far as

790
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:24,720
the distinction between the surface and

791
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,720
sharps of subsurface is concerned

792
00:32:24,720 --> 00:32:28,720
this method is

793
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,080
in general surface irrigation method you

794
00:32:28,720 --> 00:32:31,840
are applying the

795
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:34,080
water

796
00:32:31,840 --> 00:32:35,760
onto the surface of the

797
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:38,240
land

798
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:40,720
onto the ground surface

799
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:42,880
whereas in some cases

800
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,640
you might find that especially in the

801
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:45,840
case of drip irrigation system will come

802
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:48,240
to that

803
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:50,240
you might be supplying water not exactly

804
00:32:48,240 --> 00:32:53,039
on the surface but may be slightly below

805
00:32:50,240 --> 00:32:55,519
the surface but that is again

806
00:32:53,039 --> 00:32:58,399
the level

807
00:32:55,519 --> 00:33:00,640
is very small and that is for us

808
00:32:58,399 --> 00:33:03,039
with a specific purpose

809
00:33:00,640 --> 00:33:07,200
but in uh even in that case it will be

810
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:07,200
called the surface irrigation method so

811
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:12,880
between the first two categories this

812
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:15,760
will belong to the first category

813
00:33:12,880 --> 00:33:17,440
over the only distinction that you are

814
00:33:15,760 --> 00:33:19,679
application

815
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:21,679
application of water is through

816
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:23,600
the pressure devices

817
00:33:21,679 --> 00:33:24,720
that means ultimately when it comes to

818
00:33:23,600 --> 00:33:26,159
the

819
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,919
application stage

820
00:33:26,159 --> 00:33:30,240
is through the pressure device because

821
00:33:27,919 --> 00:33:31,120
of that requirement

822
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:33,360
even

823
00:33:31,120 --> 00:33:35,840
the previous system the whole system you

824
00:33:33,360 --> 00:33:37,760
have to have under pressure otherwise

825
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,919
you don't have any other means

826
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:42,080
to provide that ultimate pressure at the

827
00:33:39,919 --> 00:33:44,640
application level so

828
00:33:42,080 --> 00:33:47,279
it becomes essential

829
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:47,279
that you have

830
00:33:47,519 --> 00:33:49,760
the

831
00:33:50,840 --> 00:33:54,640
pipes

832
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:58,399
the water will be flowing through the

833
00:33:54,640 --> 00:34:00,159
pipes the source from the supply source

834
00:33:58,399 --> 00:34:01,200
you'll have to carry the water all the

835
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:03,360
way

836
00:34:01,200 --> 00:34:04,240
under pressure

837
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,320
so that

838
00:34:04,240 --> 00:34:08,159
ultimately when you come to the

839
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:10,480
application level

840
00:34:08,159 --> 00:34:12,639
you might choose any type of device but

841
00:34:10,480 --> 00:34:15,280
the water should be still under pressure

842
00:34:12,639 --> 00:34:18,159
so that you can

843
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:20,320
supply that water under pressure

844
00:34:18,159 --> 00:34:22,079
so that is the basic difference between

845
00:34:20,320 --> 00:34:24,480
this method and the

846
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:27,040
previous methods we have

847
00:34:24,480 --> 00:34:27,040
discussed

848
00:34:27,280 --> 00:34:32,000
there are many

849
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:32,000
different variations of

850
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:38,079
specialized irrigation method

851
00:34:36,320 --> 00:34:40,639
they can be

852
00:34:38,079 --> 00:34:43,200
different categories they are either

853
00:34:40,639 --> 00:34:45,200
dependent on what type of devices you

854
00:34:43,200 --> 00:34:47,040
are using or what is the order of

855
00:34:45,200 --> 00:34:50,320
magnitude of the pressure

856
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,720
that is how the devices will also be

857
00:34:50,320 --> 00:34:55,359
varying

858
00:34:52,720 --> 00:34:57,520
there are many many

859
00:34:55,359 --> 00:34:59,599
classes of such systems

860
00:34:57,520 --> 00:35:01,359
but the two which have become

861
00:34:59,599 --> 00:35:03,200
highly popular

862
00:35:01,359 --> 00:35:05,119
we'll

863
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,359
we'll discuss those

864
00:35:05,119 --> 00:35:12,440
and these are

865
00:35:07,359 --> 00:35:12,440
first one is spring clarification system

866
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,640
and

867
00:35:21,359 --> 00:35:25,640
the other one is

868
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:25,640
replication

869
00:35:44,800 --> 00:35:47,680
these two methods

870
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:51,520
are the ones which are

871
00:35:53,040 --> 00:35:59,119
basically the basic reasons why this

872
00:35:56,160 --> 00:36:01,440
these methods have come into our picture

873
00:35:59,119 --> 00:36:03,200
why they have been

874
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:05,839
they have come into being

875
00:36:03,200 --> 00:36:08,480
is the scarcity of water

876
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:10,720
that was the basic reason

877
00:36:08,480 --> 00:36:10,720
that

878
00:36:11,200 --> 00:36:14,160
people thought of

879
00:36:12,560 --> 00:36:15,599
different ways of

880
00:36:14,160 --> 00:36:17,760
saving water

881
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:21,599
and by doing so

882
00:36:17,760 --> 00:36:21,599
they felt that if they use

883
00:36:22,800 --> 00:36:25,680
the

884
00:36:23,680 --> 00:36:28,800
sprinkler irrigation

885
00:36:25,680 --> 00:36:31,280
sprinkle irrigation in comparison to the

886
00:36:28,800 --> 00:36:33,920
drip method the saving is not much that

887
00:36:31,280 --> 00:36:37,200
is that has been found later on

888
00:36:33,920 --> 00:36:39,440
but the intention was to save water

889
00:36:37,200 --> 00:36:40,480
that was the first intention

890
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:42,000
but

891
00:36:40,480 --> 00:36:46,000
the replication

892
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:46,000
as the further refinement of

893
00:36:46,079 --> 00:36:53,359
not the refinement but the further

894
00:36:49,200 --> 00:36:55,520
research into how you can save water

895
00:36:53,359 --> 00:36:57,280
and those circumstances where the water

896
00:36:55,520 --> 00:37:00,160
availability is

897
00:36:57,280 --> 00:37:02,640
a limited quantity and how you can make

898
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,359
use of that limited quantity of water to

899
00:37:02,640 --> 00:37:06,240
get the maximum or the maximum yield per

900
00:37:05,359 --> 00:37:10,000
unit

901
00:37:06,240 --> 00:37:11,119
water with that but that

902
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:13,280
objective

903
00:37:11,119 --> 00:37:16,079
this method came into being

904
00:37:13,280 --> 00:37:17,520
and israel is the country where

905
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:19,680
the sprinkler irrigation as well as

906
00:37:17,520 --> 00:37:21,119
deprecation method has been they have

907
00:37:19,680 --> 00:37:22,560
pioneered

908
00:37:21,119 --> 00:37:25,680
these uh

909
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:27,200
the pressurized systems and even now i

910
00:37:25,680 --> 00:37:29,680
think they are one of the

911
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:32,560
leaders in these

912
00:37:29,680 --> 00:37:34,800
two irrigation methods

913
00:37:32,560 --> 00:37:38,720
let's look at

914
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:38,720
these methods one by one

915
00:37:39,680 --> 00:37:44,480
first let us have a look at

916
00:37:42,320 --> 00:37:47,480
sprinkler

917
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:47,480
sorry

918
00:37:56,160 --> 00:37:59,040
sprinkler method

919
00:38:00,240 --> 00:38:03,640
and this method

920
00:38:08,960 --> 00:38:12,640
the

921
00:38:10,079 --> 00:38:12,640
water is

922
00:38:13,760 --> 00:38:19,800
supplied through

923
00:38:15,760 --> 00:38:19,800
the pipe network as

924
00:38:20,240 --> 00:38:23,839
we have said that ultimately the

925
00:38:22,800 --> 00:38:25,200
device

926
00:38:23,839 --> 00:38:27,119
for application

927
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:30,760
to be used in this particular case is

928
00:38:27,119 --> 00:38:30,760
the sprinkler head

929
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:42,160
now the sprinkler head is

930
00:38:42,720 --> 00:38:47,920
a device which sprinkles the water the

931
00:38:45,520 --> 00:38:49,280
name suggests that it sprinkles the

932
00:38:47,920 --> 00:38:50,480
water

933
00:38:49,280 --> 00:38:52,480
over the

934
00:38:50,480 --> 00:38:54,640
the surface of the

935
00:38:52,480 --> 00:38:56,079
the ground

936
00:38:54,640 --> 00:38:58,480
you might have seen

937
00:38:56,079 --> 00:39:01,359
the sprinkler

938
00:38:58,480 --> 00:39:03,520
hedge walking in some of the like the

939
00:39:01,359 --> 00:39:05,040
gardens these days or the

940
00:39:03,520 --> 00:39:07,920
the lawns

941
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,079
and there are sprinklers which are

942
00:39:07,920 --> 00:39:12,079
a very small

943
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:14,640
sprinklers which can be used in the

944
00:39:12,079 --> 00:39:17,520
lawns which can be used with the tap

945
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,800
water which you are getting in your

946
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,000
houses

947
00:39:18,800 --> 00:39:21,200
so the

948
00:39:20,000 --> 00:39:25,359
those

949
00:39:21,200 --> 00:39:25,359
that device is called the sprinkler head

950
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:28,680
this device

951
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:33,920
has a sprinkler head which is nothing

952
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:35,440
but the different types of sprinkler

953
00:39:33,920 --> 00:39:38,480
heads

954
00:39:35,440 --> 00:39:40,160
it is a device which

955
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:43,119
let the waters

956
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,200
go out

957
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:47,760
since the water is under pressure

958
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:49,760
it goes out in the form of a jet

959
00:39:47,760 --> 00:39:51,200
and that jet is broken with some

960
00:39:49,760 --> 00:39:52,480
mechanism

961
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,839
so that so that

962
00:39:52,480 --> 00:39:56,480
it gets distributed in different

963
00:39:54,839 --> 00:39:58,640
droplets

964
00:39:56,480 --> 00:40:00,320
so that is the basic philosophy of the

965
00:39:58,640 --> 00:40:01,920
sprinkler head

966
00:40:00,320 --> 00:40:05,200
it

967
00:40:01,920 --> 00:40:06,800
it disintegrates

968
00:40:05,200 --> 00:40:07,839
a stream jet

969
00:40:06,800 --> 00:40:09,520
into

970
00:40:07,839 --> 00:40:11,280
smaller

971
00:40:09,520 --> 00:40:13,680
water particles

972
00:40:11,280 --> 00:40:15,839
and those water particles are sprinkled

973
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:16,960
over the ground you can either have a

974
00:40:15,839 --> 00:40:19,599
single

975
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,359
nozzle head or you might have

976
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,720
a double nozzle head

977
00:40:21,359 --> 00:40:25,599
where you have

978
00:40:22,720 --> 00:40:26,400
two jets coming simultaneously

979
00:40:25,599 --> 00:40:28,800
and

980
00:40:26,400 --> 00:40:30,319
they are distributing the water

981
00:40:28,800 --> 00:40:32,079
over the whole area

982
00:40:30,319 --> 00:40:34,079
so this

983
00:40:32,079 --> 00:40:35,920
this sprinkler head

984
00:40:34,079 --> 00:40:37,680
it rotates

985
00:40:35,920 --> 00:40:39,040
around it

986
00:40:37,680 --> 00:40:41,359
it sucks as

987
00:40:39,040 --> 00:40:43,200
in a circular

988
00:40:41,359 --> 00:40:45,040
with a circular motion

989
00:40:43,200 --> 00:40:47,760
and that motion can also be changed it

990
00:40:45,040 --> 00:40:47,760
can be fixed

991
00:40:47,839 --> 00:40:51,119
so if you look at the plan

992
00:40:51,839 --> 00:40:55,359
if you have a sprinkler head here

993
00:40:55,599 --> 00:41:01,440
the spread of the sprinkler head

994
00:40:58,960 --> 00:41:01,440
will be a

995
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,160
circular area

996
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:13,280
and

997
00:41:10,560 --> 00:41:15,440
if i look at

998
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:16,800
the distribution how much water has been

999
00:41:15,440 --> 00:41:18,560
distributed

1000
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:21,040
now this is the

1001
00:41:18,560 --> 00:41:23,280
axis where i have located the sprinkler

1002
00:41:21,040 --> 00:41:23,280
head

1003
00:41:23,680 --> 00:41:28,880
and that's the distance in both the

1004
00:41:26,160 --> 00:41:28,880
both sides

1005
00:41:30,640 --> 00:41:34,800
the spread

1006
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:37,280
might be something

1007
00:41:34,800 --> 00:41:37,280
like this

1008
00:41:38,560 --> 00:41:43,480
this is known as the distribution factor

1009
00:41:50,640 --> 00:41:55,599
this is the distribution pattern of a

1010
00:41:52,079 --> 00:41:56,560
single sprinkler head

1011
00:41:55,599 --> 00:41:58,960
okay

1012
00:41:56,560 --> 00:42:02,480
so when the sprinkler head will be

1013
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:06,560
sprinkling water in this total area this

1014
00:42:02,480 --> 00:42:06,560
is the i have taken a section view

1015
00:42:07,920 --> 00:42:11,760
at this level

1016
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:13,280
even if you take

1017
00:42:11,760 --> 00:42:15,760
the section

1018
00:42:13,280 --> 00:42:18,240
at this level you might have a similar

1019
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:18,240
section

1020
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:24,880
and this is what

1021
00:42:22,640 --> 00:42:28,680
has the basic philosophy of what the

1022
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:28,680
sprinkler head does

1023
00:42:34,560 --> 00:42:39,040
now you might say that

1024
00:42:36,640 --> 00:42:42,400
if this is the distribution

1025
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,400
of a single sprinkler head

1026
00:42:43,200 --> 00:42:47,119
then this is quite an uneven

1027
00:42:44,480 --> 00:42:47,119
distribution

1028
00:42:47,200 --> 00:42:51,839
which we started with

1029
00:42:49,280 --> 00:42:54,800
thinking uh of those

1030
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:56,400
methods by which you can have a uniform

1031
00:42:54,800 --> 00:42:59,520
distribution

1032
00:42:56,400 --> 00:43:00,640
for the total field for example this was

1033
00:42:59,520 --> 00:43:02,960
the field

1034
00:43:00,640 --> 00:43:04,240
we had uh

1035
00:43:02,960 --> 00:43:06,480
this was our

1036
00:43:04,240 --> 00:43:08,240
root zone depth we wanted a uniform

1037
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:10,800
distribution over

1038
00:43:08,240 --> 00:43:12,880
this whole area and in the surface

1039
00:43:10,800 --> 00:43:14,640
irrigation method we have seen that we

1040
00:43:12,880 --> 00:43:16,160
cannot achieve this because of the fact

1041
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:17,599
that the water

1042
00:43:16,160 --> 00:43:20,560
flows from

1043
00:43:17,599 --> 00:43:20,560
the upstream end

1044
00:43:21,599 --> 00:43:25,119
to the

1045
00:43:22,720 --> 00:43:26,560
downstream end

1046
00:43:25,119 --> 00:43:28,480
and that's why there is uneven

1047
00:43:26,560 --> 00:43:30,560
distribution because this gets more

1048
00:43:28,480 --> 00:43:32,319
water the upstream and

1049
00:43:30,560 --> 00:43:34,880
segment of the field gets more water

1050
00:43:32,319 --> 00:43:37,040
than the instrument

1051
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:38,720
this can be avoided

1052
00:43:37,040 --> 00:43:40,640
with the

1053
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:42,800
with this

1054
00:43:40,640 --> 00:43:45,280
spring clarification method now in this

1055
00:43:42,800 --> 00:43:47,839
case what i want to do is

1056
00:43:45,280 --> 00:43:49,760
i want to

1057
00:43:47,839 --> 00:43:51,680
spread my

1058
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:52,720
if this is my

1059
00:43:51,680 --> 00:43:54,800
total

1060
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:55,920
longitudinal direction

1061
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:57,359
i might

1062
00:43:55,920 --> 00:44:00,079
try to

1063
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:02,560
have the sprinklers heads spaced in such

1064
00:44:00,079 --> 00:44:02,560
a manner

1065
00:44:05,040 --> 00:44:08,800
that i get

1066
00:44:07,599 --> 00:44:12,079
when i

1067
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:12,079
when i try to overlap

1068
00:44:12,480 --> 00:44:18,319
each one has its own

1069
00:44:15,280 --> 00:44:18,319
distribution pattern

1070
00:44:20,720 --> 00:44:24,720
the other one also has its own

1071
00:44:22,319 --> 00:44:26,319
distribution pattern

1072
00:44:24,720 --> 00:44:28,800
the third one

1073
00:44:26,319 --> 00:44:31,520
and so on

1074
00:44:28,800 --> 00:44:31,520
when i look at

1075
00:44:31,680 --> 00:44:37,000
the distribution pattern of

1076
00:44:33,520 --> 00:44:37,000
the total combination

1077
00:44:38,000 --> 00:44:41,680
is the end result is

1078
00:44:40,160 --> 00:44:44,400
the combination of all these

1079
00:44:41,680 --> 00:44:45,920
distribution patterns and i might get

1080
00:44:44,400 --> 00:44:49,160
something of

1081
00:44:45,920 --> 00:44:49,160
this nature

1082
00:44:53,760 --> 00:44:58,240
okay

1083
00:44:56,000 --> 00:45:00,560
so is the overlap

1084
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:02,839
which is important that how each

1085
00:45:00,560 --> 00:45:04,480
individual sprinkler head which is

1086
00:45:02,839 --> 00:45:05,839
spaced

1087
00:45:04,480 --> 00:45:07,680
at some

1088
00:45:05,839 --> 00:45:10,160
spacing

1089
00:45:07,680 --> 00:45:11,839
that spacing is important

1090
00:45:10,160 --> 00:45:13,839
that spacing is what

1091
00:45:11,839 --> 00:45:15,839
we are interested in knowing

1092
00:45:13,839 --> 00:45:18,720
that is part of the design when you

1093
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:20,960
design the sprinkler system

1094
00:45:18,720 --> 00:45:23,680
later on we'll we'll see and there is

1095
00:45:20,960 --> 00:45:25,760
something which we want to look into

1096
00:45:23,680 --> 00:45:27,440
what should be the spacing

1097
00:45:25,760 --> 00:45:28,640
because that will be a function of what

1098
00:45:27,440 --> 00:45:31,119
will be the distribution pattern

1099
00:45:28,640 --> 00:45:32,640
distribution pattern can change

1100
00:45:31,119 --> 00:45:34,160
with respect to

1101
00:45:32,640 --> 00:45:37,920
the pressure

1102
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:38,960
with respect to the nozzle size

1103
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,960
and

1104
00:45:38,960 --> 00:45:42,160
these are the two major factors which

1105
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:43,680
will decide

1106
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
what will be the sprinkler what will be

1107
00:45:43,680 --> 00:45:47,520
the

1108
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:49,839
distribution pattern of a sprinkler head

1109
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:51,200
but this is the basic philosophy

1110
00:45:49,839 --> 00:45:53,280
similarly

1111
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:56,240
this overlap

1112
00:45:53,280 --> 00:45:58,480
this is one overlap in one direction

1113
00:45:56,240 --> 00:46:01,200
the

1114
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:03,200
let me let me put the whole thing in

1115
00:46:01,200 --> 00:46:05,599
plan

1116
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,599
if i

1117
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:10,400
if i show that field and plan

1118
00:46:09,119 --> 00:46:12,560
now

1119
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:16,480
i might

1120
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:19,440
locate the sprinkler heads in such a way

1121
00:46:16,480 --> 00:46:21,359
that this overlap which i am

1122
00:46:19,440 --> 00:46:23,599
trying to look at

1123
00:46:21,359 --> 00:46:25,280
which will give me a good

1124
00:46:23,599 --> 00:46:27,520
distribution

1125
00:46:25,280 --> 00:46:29,280
a uniform distribution

1126
00:46:27,520 --> 00:46:32,960
will have to be

1127
00:46:29,280 --> 00:46:32,960
considered in both the directions

1128
00:46:35,760 --> 00:46:40,680
so if i consider these two rows of

1129
00:46:42,079 --> 00:46:45,839
sprinklers

1130
00:46:43,280 --> 00:46:45,839
noodles

1131
00:46:46,560 --> 00:46:51,040
and i i look at the

1132
00:46:48,880 --> 00:46:52,880
the overlap of

1133
00:46:51,040 --> 00:46:54,000
both these rows

1134
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:56,560
then in

1135
00:46:54,000 --> 00:46:59,200
in both the directions i might might get

1136
00:46:56,560 --> 00:47:01,119
a good distribution

1137
00:46:59,200 --> 00:47:03,920
of water which is the desired

1138
00:47:01,119 --> 00:47:05,599
distribution so this is what

1139
00:47:03,920 --> 00:47:09,200
is done

1140
00:47:05,599 --> 00:47:10,960
that you are trying to

1141
00:47:09,200 --> 00:47:13,599
trying to find out

1142
00:47:10,960 --> 00:47:13,599
what is that

1143
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:19,599
now i'm drawing the

1144
00:47:18,000 --> 00:47:22,000
pipeline

1145
00:47:19,599 --> 00:47:22,000
for this

1146
00:47:22,839 --> 00:47:26,800
field and plan again

1147
00:47:28,319 --> 00:47:33,280
to achieve these

1148
00:47:30,720 --> 00:47:35,440
these individual

1149
00:47:33,280 --> 00:47:36,720
sprinkler head distributions

1150
00:47:35,440 --> 00:47:39,720
i might

1151
00:47:36,720 --> 00:47:39,720
have

1152
00:47:42,400 --> 00:47:47,200
i might have a

1153
00:47:44,960 --> 00:47:51,400
one pipeline running here

1154
00:47:47,200 --> 00:47:51,400
another pipeline running here

1155
00:47:56,000 --> 00:48:00,240
and

1156
00:47:57,920 --> 00:48:01,440
this might be the total layout of my

1157
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:04,839
pipeline

1158
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:04,839
which is getting

1159
00:48:06,960 --> 00:48:12,800
which is connected

1160
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:12,800
to another bigger pipeline

1161
00:48:13,119 --> 00:48:16,240
now

1162
00:48:14,480 --> 00:48:18,640
on each

1163
00:48:16,240 --> 00:48:20,559
of these

1164
00:48:18,640 --> 00:48:23,040
locations

1165
00:48:20,559 --> 00:48:25,599
i have

1166
00:48:23,040 --> 00:48:28,079
these are the nozzle heads

1167
00:48:25,599 --> 00:48:31,359
which are located at some spacing so my

1168
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:32,839
design parameters will be

1169
00:48:31,359 --> 00:48:36,880
what will be the spacing

1170
00:48:32,839 --> 00:48:36,880
between the nozzle height

1171
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:40,800
let me say al

1172
00:48:41,280 --> 00:48:45,800
what is the spacing between these two

1173
00:48:42,800 --> 00:48:45,800
pipes

1174
00:48:48,160 --> 00:48:52,079
and each one this is normally

1175
00:48:52,160 --> 00:48:57,520
the nomenclature is that this is called

1176
00:48:55,040 --> 00:48:57,520
lateral

1177
00:49:00,720 --> 00:49:03,520
the electrical pipe

1178
00:49:02,400 --> 00:49:07,359
on which

1179
00:49:03,520 --> 00:49:07,359
you are installing these sprinkler heads

1180
00:49:07,920 --> 00:49:11,119
so what is the

1181
00:49:09,119 --> 00:49:13,200
spacing between the the

1182
00:49:11,119 --> 00:49:16,599
sprinkler heads why is the spacing

1183
00:49:13,200 --> 00:49:16,599
between the laterals

1184
00:49:18,559 --> 00:49:24,800
that has to be decided on the basis of

1185
00:49:22,000 --> 00:49:26,079
what is the distribution pattern of each

1186
00:49:24,800 --> 00:49:27,839
individual

1187
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,960
sprinkler head

1188
00:49:27,839 --> 00:49:30,720
and what

1189
00:49:28,960 --> 00:49:32,240
spacings are needed

1190
00:49:30,720 --> 00:49:34,880
to have

1191
00:49:32,240 --> 00:49:38,079
a uniform distribution

1192
00:49:34,880 --> 00:49:41,680
that is what you do in the case of

1193
00:49:38,079 --> 00:49:41,680
a sprinkler system

1194
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:45,839
and then the other design parameters can

1195
00:49:45,040 --> 00:49:48,480
be

1196
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:50,480
the sizes of these pipes and because

1197
00:49:48,480 --> 00:49:51,520
that will depend on how much are the

1198
00:49:50,480 --> 00:49:53,040
losses

1199
00:49:51,520 --> 00:49:54,880
in terms of

1200
00:49:53,040 --> 00:49:56,400
the pressure variations

1201
00:49:54,880 --> 00:49:57,680
because

1202
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,680
since we have

1203
00:49:57,680 --> 00:50:01,040
just mentioned that the distribution

1204
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:03,839
pattern will be a function of the

1205
00:50:01,040 --> 00:50:04,960
pressure available so the pressure drops

1206
00:50:03,839 --> 00:50:05,920
very much

1207
00:50:04,960 --> 00:50:08,319
your

1208
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:10,079
distribution pattern will be affected so

1209
00:50:08,319 --> 00:50:12,079
all those things will come to later on

1210
00:50:10,079 --> 00:50:14,000
but at this stage we are just trying to

1211
00:50:12,079 --> 00:50:15,920
see what is being done in this

1212
00:50:14,000 --> 00:50:17,839
particular method

1213
00:50:15,920 --> 00:50:19,599
now having known this

1214
00:50:17,839 --> 00:50:21,280
let's look at the suitability of this

1215
00:50:19,599 --> 00:50:22,800
method

1216
00:50:21,280 --> 00:50:24,800
what are the various conditions under

1217
00:50:22,800 --> 00:50:26,960
which this can be

1218
00:50:24,800 --> 00:50:28,319
suitable or

1219
00:50:26,960 --> 00:50:30,079
to

1220
00:50:28,319 --> 00:50:32,720
first of all let's look at some other

1221
00:50:30,079 --> 00:50:32,720
advantages

1222
00:50:37,359 --> 00:50:40,640
which will also

1223
00:50:38,839 --> 00:50:42,559
cover the

1224
00:50:40,640 --> 00:50:45,119
condition under which this method can be

1225
00:50:42,559 --> 00:50:45,119
suitable

1226
00:50:45,760 --> 00:50:50,079
what are the possible advantages the

1227
00:50:47,760 --> 00:50:52,079
first advantage is that you have

1228
00:50:50,079 --> 00:50:57,000
complete control on the

1229
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:57,000
supply of water

1230
00:51:11,920 --> 00:51:16,319
complete control and operation in terms

1231
00:51:14,240 --> 00:51:16,319
of

1232
00:51:16,480 --> 00:51:22,720
if you want to

1233
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,319
run the system for a very short period

1234
00:51:22,720 --> 00:51:26,480
you can afford to do in this particular

1235
00:51:24,319 --> 00:51:28,800
method which was not possible in the

1236
00:51:26,480 --> 00:51:31,520
case of surface irrigation method

1237
00:51:28,800 --> 00:51:33,440
in the case of surface irrigation method

1238
00:51:31,520 --> 00:51:36,480
if you

1239
00:51:33,440 --> 00:51:38,559
it might not be feasible but if you

1240
00:51:36,480 --> 00:51:41,200
are willing to

1241
00:51:38,559 --> 00:51:43,119
apply a depth of

1242
00:51:41,200 --> 00:51:45,119
one centimeter of water it may not be

1243
00:51:43,119 --> 00:51:46,000
possible

1244
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:47,920
and

1245
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:49,599
in some soils

1246
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:51,119
it may not be at all possible because

1247
00:51:49,599 --> 00:51:52,960
while doing so

1248
00:51:51,119 --> 00:51:55,280
you might find that

1249
00:51:52,960 --> 00:51:56,000
you have created a lot of disparity in

1250
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,359
the

1251
00:51:56,000 --> 00:51:59,040
and the amount of

1252
00:51:57,359 --> 00:52:00,480
water which have made has been

1253
00:51:59,040 --> 00:52:02,880
ultimately made available at the

1254
00:52:00,480 --> 00:52:04,559
upstream and the non-instrument

1255
00:52:02,880 --> 00:52:06,480
whereas in this case

1256
00:52:04,559 --> 00:52:08,640
you can run the system

1257
00:52:06,480 --> 00:52:11,200
for a very short period and you can

1258
00:52:08,640 --> 00:52:13,200
afford to apply an in-depth

1259
00:52:11,200 --> 00:52:17,040
any depth which you

1260
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:20,079
you find feasible or you want to

1261
00:52:17,040 --> 00:52:23,200
apply that depth onto a particular area

1262
00:52:20,079 --> 00:52:23,200
you can afford to do that

1263
00:52:23,599 --> 00:52:27,200
then

1264
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:29,440
the other advantage is that you can use

1265
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:29,440
this

1266
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:34,800
for

1267
00:52:32,480 --> 00:52:34,800
very

1268
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:38,720
coarse soils

1269
00:52:40,960 --> 00:52:44,480
where no other method is suitable

1270
00:52:42,960 --> 00:52:47,119
because if the

1271
00:52:44,480 --> 00:52:49,200
soil is very coarse now in this case you

1272
00:52:47,119 --> 00:52:50,400
are not supplying the water from one end

1273
00:52:49,200 --> 00:52:52,079
to the other end

1274
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,760
since it's coming as

1275
00:52:52,079 --> 00:52:56,000
in the form of rain

1276
00:52:53,760 --> 00:52:58,800
as the rain comes

1277
00:52:56,000 --> 00:53:00,480
you can you can apply onto any type of

1278
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:02,160
soil whether it's a

1279
00:53:00,480 --> 00:53:02,960
highly porous soil

1280
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:05,520
or

1281
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:07,200
even if it is the other extreme

1282
00:53:05,520 --> 00:53:09,280
where you have very

1283
00:53:07,200 --> 00:53:11,280
low infiltration rates

1284
00:53:09,280 --> 00:53:12,559
in that case

1285
00:53:11,280 --> 00:53:14,559
what is needed

1286
00:53:12,559 --> 00:53:16,640
if you if you have very low infiltration

1287
00:53:14,559 --> 00:53:18,160
rates if you use a conventional surface

1288
00:53:16,640 --> 00:53:19,440
irrigation method you might find that

1289
00:53:18,160 --> 00:53:21,200
most of the

1290
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:23,760
water is

1291
00:53:21,200 --> 00:53:25,520
getting lost in the form of runoff

1292
00:53:23,760 --> 00:53:28,400
whereas in this case

1293
00:53:25,520 --> 00:53:30,079
you can you can afford to

1294
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,839
reduce the

1295
00:53:30,079 --> 00:53:34,640
the supply

1296
00:53:31,839 --> 00:53:36,160
but the design can be made in such a way

1297
00:53:34,640 --> 00:53:38,319
that the rate of

1298
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:39,680
input or the rate of application can be

1299
00:53:38,319 --> 00:53:41,920
reduced

1300
00:53:39,680 --> 00:53:43,839
and over and above that you can have

1301
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:45,359
more intermittent

1302
00:53:43,839 --> 00:53:47,280
irrigations

1303
00:53:45,359 --> 00:53:49,359
you can you can have more frequent

1304
00:53:47,280 --> 00:53:51,760
irrigations which is not possible with

1305
00:53:49,359 --> 00:53:54,960
the other method so in this case

1306
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:56,640
you can have this method suitable for

1307
00:53:54,960 --> 00:53:59,200
very coarse soils

1308
00:53:56,640 --> 00:53:59,200
as well as

1309
00:54:03,680 --> 00:54:06,640
very fine soils

1310
00:54:08,800 --> 00:54:13,920
if it comes to that situation

1311
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:15,200
but at the same time

1312
00:54:13,920 --> 00:54:18,559
if the

1313
00:54:15,200 --> 00:54:19,359
amount of uh water which is

1314
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:21,599
or the

1315
00:54:19,359 --> 00:54:23,200
the level of application is very high

1316
00:54:21,599 --> 00:54:24,880
then i think it's not worthwhile going

1317
00:54:23,200 --> 00:54:26,240
in for this method

1318
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:28,800
because if the

1319
00:54:26,240 --> 00:54:30,640
at the level of water application is

1320
00:54:28,800 --> 00:54:32,160
very excessive then it's better to flood

1321
00:54:30,640 --> 00:54:33,280
the area

1322
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:36,640
than

1323
00:54:33,280 --> 00:54:36,640
going in for such a method

1324
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:42,400
then in this case you don't

1325
00:54:39,760 --> 00:54:42,400
no need of

1326
00:54:43,760 --> 00:54:48,400
any

1327
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,400
leveling

1328
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:55,599
so the land leveling

1329
00:54:53,040 --> 00:54:58,319
you can use this method for

1330
00:54:55,599 --> 00:55:00,160
undulating areas where no other surface

1331
00:54:58,319 --> 00:55:01,200
irrigation method is

1332
00:55:00,160 --> 00:55:03,839
as

1333
00:55:01,200 --> 00:55:05,599
possible or is useful

1334
00:55:03,839 --> 00:55:08,880
you can use this method because in this

1335
00:55:05,599 --> 00:55:10,240
case you don't have any problem of

1336
00:55:08,880 --> 00:55:12,000
the terrain

1337
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:13,599
as the application the rate of

1338
00:55:12,000 --> 00:55:15,680
application in your

1339
00:55:13,599 --> 00:55:17,520
is in your hand you can wait for the

1340
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:20,640
soil to be dry

1341
00:55:17,520 --> 00:55:22,960
so that next time when you

1342
00:55:20,640 --> 00:55:24,720
apply the irrigation water there is no

1343
00:55:22,960 --> 00:55:26,720
surface runoff

1344
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:28,240
in the beginning the infiltration rates

1345
00:55:26,720 --> 00:55:29,200
will be high

1346
00:55:28,240 --> 00:55:31,280
so

1347
00:55:29,200 --> 00:55:33,359
unless you have reached a steady state

1348
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:34,880
infiltration rate

1349
00:55:33,359 --> 00:55:37,119
you will find that most of the time in

1350
00:55:34,880 --> 00:55:39,200
most of the soils the infiltration rates

1351
00:55:37,119 --> 00:55:41,920
will be comparatively higher

1352
00:55:39,200 --> 00:55:44,640
so in this method you can afford to make

1353
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:44,640
use of those

1354
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:50,079
advantages and you don't the

1355
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:53,599
the mere fact that the leveling is not

1356
00:55:50,079 --> 00:55:53,599
required that is a big bone

1357
00:55:54,079 --> 00:55:58,960
so that i think we'll stop here today

1358
00:55:56,640 --> 00:56:01,280
and we'll uh next class we'll continue

1359
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:05,880
with this and go on to the next method

1360
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:05,880
of drip irrigation thank you

1361
00:56:19,270 --> 00:56:22,309
[Music]

1362
00:56:26,150 --> 00:56:39,200
[Music]

1363
00:56:37,119 --> 00:56:39,200
you
