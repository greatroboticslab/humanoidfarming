00:00:04,319 --> 00:00:08,720
welcome to an introduction to biodiverse

00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:11,519
farm ecosystems

3
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:13,679
creating a biodiverse farm ecosystem one

4
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,400
that supports microbial plant and animal

5
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:16,160
life

6
00:00:14,400 --> 00:00:17,520
is a key farm element part of a

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,199
sustainable farming system that

8
00:00:17,520 --> 00:00:20,240
considers conservation of natural

9
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,560
resources

10
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,400
farm economic sustainability and produce

11
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:26,160
safety

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:28,080
in the next few minutes you'll hear and

13
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,480
see an overview of the elements involved

14
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:33,280
in creating a biodiverse farm ecosystem

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:35,200
from a whole farm planting perspective a

16
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:37,120
biodiverse farm ecosystem brings

17
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:38,879
conservation food safety and cost

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:41,360
benefits to your farm

19
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,559
hedgerows riparian zones nesting boxes

20
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:44,960
and bat boxes

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:47,440
are all ways to encourage biodiversity

22
00:00:44,960 --> 00:00:48,879
hedgerows and riparian zones or natural

23
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:50,640
areas along waterways

24
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:52,719
provide pollinators a diversity of

25
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:55,199
flowering plants all season long

26
00:00:52,719 --> 00:00:57,120
and provide habitat for wildlife giving

27
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:58,719
the wildlife a place to be other than in

28
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:00,960
your fields

29
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,800
these areas can also serve as buffers

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,479
protecting growing areas or water

31
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,640
sources used for irrigation

32
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,400
from contamination by animal production

33
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:10,479
areas

34
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:11,840
according to the usda natural resource

conservation service

36
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:15,680
at least 44 species of birds use nesting

37
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,759
boxes

38
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,439

songbird houses

42
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:28,000
locating birdhouses and perches so that

43
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,600
droppings on produce are minimized

44
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:32,320
is critical to maintaining produce

45
00:01:29,600 --> 00:01:34,079
safety simple mitigation strategies can

46
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,119
encourage birds to perch in the right

47
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,880
place

48
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,960
bats are another option that can help

49
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,360
reduce pressure from insect and nematode

50
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:43,360
pests the usda natural resource

00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:44,880
conservation service reports that a

52
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,439
single little brown bat

53
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:48,240
the species that most often occupies bat

00:01:47,439 --> 00:01:51,759
houses

55
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:54,799
can catch hundreds of mosquitoes an hour

56
00:01:51,759 --> 00:01:57,360
a colony of 150 big brown bats can eat

57
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,759
19 million root worms a year

58
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,560
stink bugs leaf hoppers and cutworms are

59
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:04,479
among the other pests bats will eat

60
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,759
while the bats catch insects that may

61
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:08,160
cause you trouble an

62
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:10,160
insectary placed along your farm's edge

63
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:11,520
provides habitat for pollinators and

64
00:02:10,160 --> 00:02:14,560
beneficial insects

65
00:02:11,520 --> 00:02:16,080
much like a hedgerow by carefully

66
00:02:14,560 --> 00:02:17,920
creating a biodiverse farm

67
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,680
you can balance the risks of attracting

68
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:22,319
more wildlife to your farm with the

69
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,400
benefits that wildlife may bring

the usda natural resource conservation

71
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,800
can provide financial assistance for the

72
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:30,239
implementation of conservation practices

73
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:31,519
through the environmental quality

nrcs and extension

77
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,519
can provide technical expertise to help

78
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:41,120
with creating a biodiverse farm

ecosystem

80
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,440
introducing biodiversity smart

81
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,879
implementation can improve conservation

82
00:02:45,440 --> 00:02:51,840
of natural resources

83
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,840
