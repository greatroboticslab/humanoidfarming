hi folks ron joyner field agronomist

2
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:07,520
with pioneer here in central texas as

3
00:00:05,200 --> 00:00:09,040
you can see behind me it's planting time

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:10,480
i'm going to go over a few key things

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:11,920
you want to watch out for when it's

6
00:00:10,480 --> 00:00:14,240
planting time and some of the things

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:15,759
that will make you successful one of the

8
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:17,840
most important things that you want to

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,240
be careful of is as you move from field

10
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,240
to field or start planning that you're

11
00:00:20,240 --> 00:00:24,720
monitoring your planter dip just because

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:26,400
you set it one time doesn't always

13
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:28,240
mean that it's going to be correct as

14
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,439
field conditions change from one field

15
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:31,279
to the next

16
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:33,120
one of the things i like to use you can

17
00:00:31,279 --> 00:00:35,360
see here are these handy

18
00:00:33,120 --> 00:00:37,680
pioneer measuring tools you move the

19
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,200
dirt back away from the sides there

20
00:00:37,680 --> 00:00:43,680
notice there's a seed down in the trench

21
00:00:41,200 --> 00:00:45,520
right here

22
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:47,280
take one lay it across and put the other

23
00:00:45,520 --> 00:00:49,360
one there that's about two and a quarter

24
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:50,879
inches great job by this particular

25
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:53,039
griller so one thing i like to do

26
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:56,160
besides just checking planting depth is

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:58,000
look at the number of seeds uh in a row

28
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
and what kind of spacing we're getting

29
00:00:58,000 --> 00:01:03,039
in more than one spot so for example

30
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:05,920
here you know we're about 8.7

31
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:09,280
you know approximately close to 9 there

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,680
so 8.7 to 9 inches i also like to keep

33
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:14,479
with me this time of year if i'm running

34
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:16,960
a planter i put this in the tractor

35
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:18,240
he's on 30 inch rows if you go across

36
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:22,159
and you look at

37
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:24,640
about 8.7 inches between the seeds on 30

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:28,080
inch rows that's about 24 000 which is a

39
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:30,000
great population for a dry land area

40
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,759
one other key thing to make note of this

41
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,280
time of year is what is your soil

42
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,960
temperature what's that temperature

43
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:36,960
doing i stuck this thermometer in the

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,600
ground it's early in the morning right

45
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:41,680
now and we're at about 60 degrees we

46
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:44,960
always like to be at a minimum of about

47
00:01:41,680 --> 00:01:46,799
50 with a warming trend occurring so if

48
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:48,799
you look at the weather forecast and

49
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:51,040
it's calling for

50
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:53,119
isolated showers or cooler weather you

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,640
might want to consider delaying planting

52
00:01:53,119 --> 00:01:56,399
for a day or two to make sure that

53
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,119
you're giving the seed every chance it

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:59,920
can to emerge and do the best that it

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:01,280
can

56
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,079
so again

57
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:06,240
make sure your seed spacing is correct

58
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:08,160
check your planter depth not just at the

59
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:10,399
first field you start on but every time

60
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:12,800
you move fields and occasionally at

61
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,480
random times during the planting season

62
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,480
be sure that your soil temperature is a

63
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,040
minimum of 50 degrees for corn and

64
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:21,360
climbing with a warming trend watch out

65
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,520
for cold weather and showers hope you

66
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,239
have a happy planting season again ron

67
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:28,720
from pioneer thanks for your business

68
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:31,480
