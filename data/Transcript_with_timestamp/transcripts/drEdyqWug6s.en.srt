00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:15,680
to raising and managing a large herd of

6
00:00:11,639 --> 00:00:18,560
cattle is no easy task and is incredibly

7
00:00:15,680 --> 00:00:21,119
costly to address this challenge some

8
00:00:18,560 --> 00:00:24,080
cattle ranchers have come up with a bold

00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:25,600
anything else it's a combination of

30
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:28,280
technique and Instinct in the past it

31
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:31,000
might have taken 20 men to gather cattle

00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:35,240
at a musty yard a process that could

33
00:01:31,000 --> 00:01:38,439
last up to 3 days now one helicopter can

00:01:35,240 --> 00:01:41,040
complete the job in just half a day

35
00:01:38,439 --> 00:01:44,320
helicopter mastering has revolutionized

00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:46,960
Australia's beef industry enabling it to

37
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:50,680
keep up with massive Global demand for

38
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:53,759

and labor intensive traditional hurting

46
00:02:09,800 --> 00:02:15,040
methods like horseback riding have lost

00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:20,200
spend countless hours moving cattle

49
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:23,080
between grazing areas monitoring each

animal and ensuring none stray or get

51
00:02:23,080 --> 00:02:28,200
injured to address these challenges

52
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:30,640
American Ranchers have begun using

53
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:33,519
helicopters as a tool to manage free

54
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:36,360
range cattle over time they've seen

55
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:38,920
numerous benefits from this approach

56
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:41,560
first helicopters can cover vast

57
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:44,200
expanses of land in a short amount of

58
00:02:41,560 --> 00:02:46,360
time they are extremely useful for

59
00:02:44,200 --> 00:02:49,599
monitoring cattle across challenging

60
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:52,319
terrains this includes Hills forests or

61
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,720
Wetlands from the aerial perspective

62
00:02:52,319 --> 00:02:57,159
American ranchers gain a comprehensive

63
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,239
view of the tracking herd's condition

64
00:02:57,159 --> 00:03:02,720
and guiding them towards specific

65
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:06,040
grazing zones helicopters equipped with

66
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:09,120
GPS technology allow Farmers to observe

67
00:03:06,040 --> 00:03:11,120
and anticipate potential issues this

68
00:03:09,120 --> 00:03:13,720
also helps them to keep cattle from

69
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:16,080
straying too far or preventing certain

70
00:03:13,720 --> 00:03:19,360
animals from wandering away from the

71
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:21,799
herd Additionally the aerial view helps

72
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Farmers identify any cattle showing

73
00:03:21,799 --> 00:03:27,560
unusual symptoms early detection can

74
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:30,519
prevent disease spread within the herd

75
00:03:27,560 --> 00:03:33,879
and ensure a timely Veterinary Care for

76
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:37,040
any sick animals in areas with limited

77
00:03:33,879 --> 00:03:39,560
grazing land Farmers must rotate herds

78
00:03:37,040 --> 00:03:42,560
between different pastures often using

79
00:03:39,560 --> 00:03:45,319
trucks as the primary method they load

80
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:48,640
cattle onto specially designed trucks to

81
00:03:45,319 --> 00:03:51,280
ensure safety and minimize stress during

82
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:54,640
Transit before each flight Farmers

83
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:57,599
refuel and conduct thorough helicopter

84
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:01,720
inspections this is an important step to

85
00:03:57,599 --> 00:04:01,720
minimize risks when flying

86
00:04:03,560 --> 00:04:08,480
the sound of the helicopter's engine

87
00:04:05,720 --> 00:04:11,439
cuts through the quiet of the planes

88
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:14,159
from above the entire herd is visible

89
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:17,079
numbering in the thousands they graze

90
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:19,880
peacefully scattered across valleys and

91
00:04:17,079 --> 00:04:23,080
Hills some might argue that using

92
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:26,040
helicopters in ranching is costly due to

93
00:04:23,080 --> 00:04:28,240
the substantial initial investment

94
00:04:26,040 --> 00:04:30,800
however with a one-time investment

95
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:33,360
ranchers can use helicopters for years

96
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:37,039
reducing labor costs and realizing

97
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:39,600
long-term profits moreover the ability

98
00:04:37,039 --> 00:04:42,560
to quickly and accurately managed cattle

99
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:44,880
herds ensures healthier livestock this

100
00:04:42,560 --> 00:04:47,800
leads to better quality meat and milk

101
00:04:44,880 --> 00:04:50,520
products increasing Farm

102
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:52,560
profitability during the grazing season

103
00:04:50,520 --> 00:04:55,039
ranchers must Round Up cattle that have

104
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:58,160
wandered across hundreds of Acres a

105
00:04:55,039 --> 00:05:01,000
major Challenge from above Pilots can

106
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:03,960
easily spot the herds but it's not that

107
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,360
simple they face animals that try to

108
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:09,320
hide anywhere they can ducking under

109
00:05:06,360 --> 00:05:12,759
trees or running along river banks the

110
00:05:09,320 --> 00:05:15,440
lapse in the Pilot's Focus can be fatal

111
00:05:12,759 --> 00:05:19,000
numerous people have lost their lives in

112
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:22,080
helicopter accidents another difficulty

113
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:24,199
comes from harsh weather strong winds

114
00:05:22,080 --> 00:05:26,720
can make helicopter control more

115
00:05:24,199 --> 00:05:30,039
dangerous than ever sometimes

116
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:33,280
helicopters must fly low to avoid winds

117
00:05:30,039 --> 00:05:36,039
dense foliage and rugged Hills the

118
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:38,360
safety of the pilot is Paramount more

119
00:05:36,039 --> 00:05:41,160
important than catching cattle trying to

120
00:05:38,360 --> 00:05:44,600
escape farmers can return and gather

121
00:05:41,160 --> 00:05:46,720
them at another time with skilled flying

122
00:05:44,600 --> 00:05:49,039
the pilot must maneuver so that the

123

gradually lowering and swooping close to

126
00:05:54,720 --> 00:06:00,600
the ground to herd cattle into

127
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:03,360
designated areas ground crew in pickup

128
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:06,680
trucks follow behind gradually steering

129
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,199
the cattle towards the Gathering Point

130
00:06:06,680 --> 00:06:11,199
helicopters have enabled Farmers to

131
00:06:09,199 --> 00:06:14,280
carry out large-scale livestock

132
00:06:11,199 --> 00:06:17,240
operations with confidence cattle is

00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:20,720
spread across vast areas to fatten up

134
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:23,360
for Asian beef export markets Farmers

135
00:06:20,720 --> 00:06:25,960
also use helicopters to rescue cattle

136
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:29,759
trapped in hard to reach areas like

137
00:06:25,960 --> 00:06:32,400
marshes high mountains or dense forests

138
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:34,880
in Switzerland 12 cattle were airlifted

cable countries like Australia and in

147
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:05,479
some parts of the US are also using

148
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:07,560
drone technology to manage cattle herds

149
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:09,759
especially in vast areas where

150
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:13,120
traditional hurting methods are timec

151
00:07:09,759 --> 00:07:15,919
consuming and less effective drones are

152
00:07:13,120 --> 00:07:18,800
programmed to fly at specific altitudes

153
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:21,560
and speeds to guide cattle in a certain

154
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:24,720
direction after locating the herd the

155
00:07:21,560 --> 00:07:27,400
Drone approaches the noise and movements

156
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:30,319
of the Drone startle the cattle causing

157
00:07:27,400 --> 00:07:32,720
them to move away making it easier for

158
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:34,360
Farmers to direct them towards grazing

159
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:37,240
zones or

160
00:07:34,360 --> 00:07:40,960
enclosures in addition to hering cattle

161
00:07:37,240 --> 00:07:43,479
Farmers also use drones to monitor crops

162
00:07:40,960 --> 00:07:46,599
this method is applied to pastures and

163
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:49,800
grain fields to ensure a year round food

164
00:07:46,599 --> 00:07:52,000
supply for the livestock farmers can

165
00:07:49,800 --> 00:07:54,599
easily observe their fields from a

166
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:57,360
comprehensive aerial perspective

167
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,960
allowing them to identify any cron

drones equipped with high resolution

171
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:09,280
cameras and sensors can help farmers

172
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,080
detect

173
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:14,840
infestations the realtime Imaging and

174
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:18,360
coverage provided by drones also allows

175
00:08:14,840 --> 00:08:21,360
Farmers to inspect irrigation systems

176
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:24,840
thermal sensors can reveal if fields are

177
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,479
too wet or too dry enabling them to

178
00:08:24,840 --> 00:08:30,720
adjust irrigation accordingly this

179
00:08:27,479 --> 00:08:33,440
ensures optimal water supply

180
00:08:30,720 --> 00:08:36,200
in California drones are also used to

181
00:08:33,440 --> 00:08:39,479
protect farms and cattle from predators

182
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:42,120
this is by aiding in hunting activities

183
00:08:39,479 --> 00:08:44,440
before initiating a hunt farmers can use

184
00:08:42,120 --> 00:08:47,480
drones to get an overview of their land

185
00:08:44,440 --> 00:08:50,040
or locate potential Predators once the

186
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:53,279
target position is identified farmers

187
00:08:50,040 --> 00:08:55,480
can move into this area to hunt this

188
00:08:53,279 --> 00:08:57,800
method makes hunting more efficient

189
00:08:55,480 --> 00:09:03,580
while increasing success
