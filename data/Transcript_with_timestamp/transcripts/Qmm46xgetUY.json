  "text": "[Music] slim did you make a friend you tried to let him go and what happened you held out your hand and he jumped right in it didn't he and then he jumped up your leg liam said him down and said you're free to go in the wild and he jumped right into his hand he says i'll hang out with you for a little bit longer my jumping friend he says i saw you jumping and you're a pro [Laughter] good jumpers you're gonna trip you're gonna trip over the walnuts i already picked up all the walnuts in this area and there's just as many fallen again [Music] all right put them in put them in the wagon pick them up they're not going to help me are you you watching those cows eat they're so cute who wouldn't want to watch cows eat they're so cool look who's coming look behind you look who's look who's coming it's baby bowser bowser are you coming to see us no i turned around you want to see the chaos you love your girls they're sweet bowser you are so fat mama you are looking good too i think we're feeding them maybe a little too much i'd rather have them a little bit hefty going into winter though oh pink snacks got a bunch of starting to rot pumpkins that we got to go ahead and hurry up and feed them all before they get too gross how's the wheat going is that just the right spot to itch [Music] got some pumpkins and some walnuts we're gonna see if they like you think you're liking peaches what are you doing you wanna give some to the pigs wanna give some to the pigs so i've had a lot of people tell me that pigs love black walnuts i've been a little afraid to give them to them because i know that too much black walnut can be toxic mama [Applause] see will she eat them i noticed that the boys had some black walnuts above them that were falling into their pan and they weren't eating them so yeah not sure about this my pigs are not black walnut fans it appears oh maybe they are no no i already know the boys aren't eating them strange what i know she does like hey some there she goes chop chop chomp these little mini pumpkins are not the tastiest but they're still this is still food [Music] [Applause] me [Music] interesting side note the chickens are interested in the walnuts and i think that's because of the whole maggots or whole worms is a nicer way to call it there's little bugs that parasitize the outer hell of the black walnut the chickens were probably interested in that attracted by that chickens are great to clean up after other animals aren't they [Music] i don't know if his jaw is strong enough to bite through the shell come on cows come on cows come on cows lashes friendship come on i need you out of here now gotta get it set up for the piggies come on come on cows here i'll watch the gate you gotta watch the gate because bill's gonna try to sneak out we want to keep him in there if possible even though we know we can catch him again [Music] come on on come on lashes there they go come on cows good girls good girls [Applause] good girls they're like oh yeah that grass had a chance to grow up for us that was a good nice little short rest for this pasture now that the season is slowing down on the growth rate alright so now we're going to take down this fence around the coonies we're going to move it up into here give them a section right here to rotationally graze ryan's taking it down we pretty much trust that bowser and peaches will stay with us so we're not worried about them going anywhere while we move the fence should be pretty easy to get them where we want them to go [Music] peaches is like not even aware that there's no more fence she's just chilling uh she's like this is my area i'm gonna lay down she's such a chill little pig big pig [Music] all right we've got the electric net fence set up we're going to use this solar charger all by itself on one fence so that it's strong enough they've got the tarped area for shelter from the rain we'll build another pallet shelter for them up here for the winter once it starts to get cold they'll have that we've got the fence down right here our water is going to go right here and wallow will be in this corner but we're going to bring peaches in bowser in this way pretty cool we spent all that time putting up the fence over here he just hasn't moved she has no idea that there is not a fence around her you have no clue do you right mama [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] come on peaches you were supposed to follow him [Applause] use bread to catch fish use bread to make sandwiches now using bread to lure pigs sacrificing our kids lunch what's wrong why are you afraid come on girl it's so close come on girl come on critical turning point come on where's that gate closed daddy push that get close push that gate close two seconds now bonus points all right we got her in the paddock if i can get her into the electric net fence without her getting spooked by walking over a fence that'd be great slightly bigger pieces oh i know over here out of the bread crumbs there you go here we go here we go a whole bunch right here and then i'm going to come over the top of her if i can get her [Applause] [Music] and we still have half a loaf of bread left for us to eat wow that was a full loaf when we started oh my goodness pigs pigs and peaches and bowser united reunited and it feels so good you're so good you're so good now i just gotta hook up the electricity and now the dog house goes back to its original use move titus over here so that the cows can use the original use of that shelter which was for cows so the cows have a shelter the dog has a shelter and we will be building a pallet wall and ceiling for these guys shortly they're fighting over a pumpkin bill is running around with a little mini pumpkin in his mouth you like those pumpkins they're yummy huh so we have lashes back in the buckpin she's just in there in the buck shelter eating some of his hay and she's in here again because she got out again she found a new spot and she broke through a new area so man i just wish we could just fence the entire back side of the property with regular fence instead of barbed wire but it's just not in the budget or the time limits that we have right now so she is in timeout pen meanwhile the koonies are loving their area they're doing a good job and staying in they have a couple of ducks in there visiting them right now mama friendship is out there she doesn't go far when her baby's in here she doesn't go in the woods she stays nice and close but the kuni kuni rotational fence is up and functioning so that was a good thing for us to be able to accomplish this weekend right bill [Music] um",
