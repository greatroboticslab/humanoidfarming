00:00:02,300 --> 00:00:04,389
I

3
00:00:04,390 --> 00:00:10,400
was in Bihar East India last week I was

4
00:00:08,540 --> 00:00:14,450
talking to some of the women farmers

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:17,930
Erie has been working with and they told

6
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:20,659
me there were two things that transform

7
00:00:17,930 --> 00:00:24,289
their life significantly in the in the

8
00:00:20,659 --> 00:00:27,529
recent years first was their recognition

9
00:00:24,289 --> 00:00:29,619
as farmers in their own right record

10
00:00:27,529 --> 00:00:33,200
getting that identity

11
00:00:29,619 --> 00:00:35,989
that might seem trivial to a lot of us I

12
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:38,660
think we take it for granted but these

13
00:00:35,989 --> 00:00:41,359
women have been toiling on their rice

14
00:00:38,660 --> 00:00:44,059
fields for years and generations and

15
00:00:41,359 --> 00:00:47,870
have never been recognized as farmers

16
00:00:44,059 --> 00:00:51,710
they were just unpaid family labor and

17
00:00:47,870 --> 00:00:55,129
as a result they had no access to inputs

18
00:00:51,710 --> 00:00:58,429
no access to technologies no access to

19
00:00:55,129 --> 00:01:02,210
credit Norland and they remained in that

20
00:00:58,429 --> 00:01:05,920
purchase cycle of low productivity and

21
00:01:02,210 --> 00:01:08,870
poverty and incomes and

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:11,500
when they started working with Erie

23
00:01:08,870 --> 00:01:14,830
engaging in the participatory

24
00:01:11,500 --> 00:01:19,570
technology development and evaluation

25
00:01:14,830 --> 00:01:22,580
programs they got access to

26
00:01:19,570 --> 00:01:25,520
technologies like let's say machine

27
00:01:22,580 --> 00:01:29,450
transplanting of rice direct trading of

28
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:32,180
rice using good agronomic practices you

29
00:01:29,450 --> 00:01:35,840
know managing good nurseries for healthy

30
00:01:32,180 --> 00:01:38,290
seedlings and so on and so on and as a

31
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:42,020
result they gained a lot of confidence

32
00:01:38,290 --> 00:01:46,010
and started using these practices and

33
00:01:42,020 --> 00:01:48,500
now they're recognized as knowledgeable

34
00:01:46,010 --> 00:01:51,620
and progressive farmers in their own

35
00:01:48,500 --> 00:01:54,470
right by their households by their

36
00:01:51,620 --> 00:01:57,500
communities they saved a lot of time and

37
00:01:54,470 --> 00:02:00,470
energy and they're able to use that time

38
00:01:57,500 --> 00:02:03,260
now to take care of their children's

39
00:02:00,470 --> 00:02:05,600
education look after the household

40
00:02:03,260 --> 00:02:07,140
better would also take care of

41
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,360
themselves and their

42
00:02:07,140 --> 00:02:11,810
being and they said that has made a

43
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:14,760
significant difference in their lives

44
00:02:11,810 --> 00:02:16,670
improved productivity gave them more

45
00:02:14,760 --> 00:02:20,550
income and

46
00:02:16,670 --> 00:02:22,890
some women saw the economic opportunity

47
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:25,920
as they started using those Transplant

48
00:02:22,890 --> 00:02:28,320
airs so in their collective in their

49
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:31,140
self-help group they came together and

50
00:02:28,320 --> 00:02:33,720
then started they bought a machine

51
00:02:31,140 --> 00:02:36,060
transplanter and started a custom hiring

52
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,750
center so when they are providing

53
00:02:36,060 --> 00:02:42,240
machine transplanting services to other

54
00:02:39,750 --> 00:02:45,870
farmers within their village but also

55
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:48,060
outside and earning some income at the

56
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:51,900
same time they are also filling a gap

57
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:55,590
that exists in service provision and as

58
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:59,040
a result these women are now also being

59
00:02:55,590 --> 00:03:01,770
recognized as budding business woman and

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:04,620
they've gained a lot of credibility and

61
00:03:01,770 --> 00:03:06,900
respect in their communities I mean I

62
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:09,840
was talking to some of the men in those

63
00:03:06,900 --> 00:03:11,850
villages and they were so proud of their

64
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,940
wives their daughters and

65
00:03:11,850 --> 00:03:18,209
daughters-in-law who were doing this to

66
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:22,230
put it in context Bihar is a very

67
00:03:18,209 --> 00:03:25,440
patriarchal society has been just for

68
00:03:22,230 --> 00:03:28,110
these women to break those social norms

69
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,140
and take on roles that were

70
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:34,799
traditionally done by men I mean driving

71
00:03:31,140 --> 00:03:39,120
a machine in the rice field not heard of

72
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:42,239
before wasn't easy they faced a lot of

73
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,640
sneers and jeers when they started well

74
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:47,010
they were met people who asked who do

75
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:50,640
you think you are men what are you even

76
00:03:47,010 --> 00:03:54,750
trying to do but then they persevere

77
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:57,959
they persisted and and they managed to

78
00:03:54,750 --> 00:04:01,140
do that mainly because they stayed and

79
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:05,640
worked as a collective being in that

80
00:04:01,140 --> 00:04:08,430
group give them that power as a result

81
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:11,700
some a lot of these women now have

82
00:04:08,430 --> 00:04:14,549
access to inputs have access to

83
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:17,239
technologies you know they can rent land

84
00:04:14,549 --> 00:04:19,509
a lot of them have bank accounts

85
00:04:17,239 --> 00:04:22,400
they can get loans and

86
00:04:19,509 --> 00:04:26,150
they are able to make decisions on what

87
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,419
to produce what to sell way to sell and

88
00:04:26,150 --> 00:04:33,190
how to use the income they earned and

89
00:04:28,419 --> 00:04:37,520
that is an example of how

90
00:04:33,190 --> 00:04:41,389
targeting technology is right and using

91
00:04:37,520 --> 00:04:44,889
the right process to get them to Berman

92
00:04:41,389 --> 00:04:48,050
can make a significant difference in

93
00:04:44,889 --> 00:04:50,509
power relations within the households

94
00:04:48,050 --> 00:04:53,080
within the communities and within the

95
00:04:50,509 --> 00:04:53,080
society

96
00:04:55,010 --> 00:05:02,920
