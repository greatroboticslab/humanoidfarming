  "text": "hi there i'm matt vandehart pioneer field agronomist from central iowa providing a late season corn update now i know each year we tell you to go assess stock quality and grain quality to set your harvest plans this year i want to make sure you are assessing late season plant health and tar spot we didn't have the right conditions for tar spot this year across the midwest or even across iowa we didn't have a lot of cool and wet conditions at least in southern iowa certain parts of iowa have seen some tar spot really get aggressive here through august and september i'm in a field here of a susceptible competitive hybrid that obviously had a lot of tar spot in it you know got into even the upper leaves or just completely covered in tar spots so septal hybrids can get affected by tar spots very aggressively very quickly but this set in this field late enough you know we're close to being able to harvest this field so it may not have had a yield impact at all but we need to take note of these fields we need to take note if you do have some tar spot out there or some bad late season plant health it may affect stock quality but also the next time you have a hybrid there make sure it has a good tar spot rating working on ratings that pioneer we have some preliminary scores and some that are work in progress but if you need a hybrid that's good got a good tar spot tolerance we're gonna give you the best in our lineup and so be asking those questions be planning that out the next time you have corn there take note of those fields i know some of you may have some drought stress and it's not tar spot out there but at least check those fields ahead of harvest tar spot's something we need to manage holistically we need to manage with fungicide time properly but a lot of that fungicide residual comes off late in the season when this aggressive disease comes up and attacks a lot of susceptible hybrids so just take note of this disease and take note of any stock quality issues ahead of harvest if you've got any questions on tar spot our tar spot tolerance ratings from pioneer or even just questions about laces in plant health let us know pioneer and have a happy harvest that concludes this pioneer agronomy video podcast visit our page on pioneer.com and follow us on twitter and facebook for more agronomy insights",
