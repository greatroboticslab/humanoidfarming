1
00:00:00,020 --> 00:00:05,400
agriculture Minnesota Prosper had the

2
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:07,440
opportunity to see first hand the

3
00:00:05,400 --> 00:00:09,840
shipment of small Machinery brought in

4
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:11,400
under the second phase of the

5
00:00:09,840 --> 00:00:14,040
enhancement of the efficiency of

6
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:15,859
production distribution supply chain in

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,420
the fruits and vegetable sector project

8
00:00:15,859 --> 00:00:21,119
also known as the seven Corps project

9
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
the shipment which includes tillers and

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:26,160
cultivators aims to reduce Farmer's

11
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,340
Reliance on labor while increasing

12
00:00:26,160 --> 00:00:30,960
efficiency and optimizing land use

13
00:00:28,340 --> 00:00:33,480
ultimately improving Farmers quality of

14
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:35,940
life ambassador of the Republic of China

15
00:00:33,480 --> 00:00:39,120
Taiwan to Saint Lucia has Excellency

16
00:00:35,940 --> 00:00:41,340
Peter chaiyan Chen explains that using

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:42,960
modern agricultural Machinery is

18
00:00:41,340 --> 00:00:45,960
critical to improving a Farm's

19
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:47,760
Effectiveness and efficiency he says his

20
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:49,680
government remains committed to

21
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:52,200
assisting St Lucia's agriculture sector

22
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:54,960
in transitioning to more advanced

23
00:00:52,200 --> 00:00:57,719
farming methods Taiwan and solution have

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:00:59,940
long-term agricultural cooperation and

25
00:00:57,719 --> 00:01:03,300
our agriculture project always

26
00:00:59,940 --> 00:01:08,060
successful one and in Iowa is the idea

27
00:01:03,300 --> 00:01:11,820
of Minister Prosper to apply

28
00:01:08,060 --> 00:01:15,240
technician technical old technology yeah

29
00:01:11,820 --> 00:01:17,820
into agriculture so we decided to impose

30
00:01:15,240 --> 00:01:19,680
some of the machines that we use in

31
00:01:17,820 --> 00:01:21,960
Taiwan and try to introduce this machine

32
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:25,619
to the local farmers and help local

33
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:27,600
farmers to be more successful in their

34
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,520
production and also with all these

35
00:01:27,600 --> 00:01:31,200
machine

36
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:34,860
also these ideas come from Minister

37
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:37,799
Prosper I try to attract more youth into

38
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:40,439
agriculture business so I believe this

39
00:01:37,799 --> 00:01:42,240
will be a very good initiative and I'm

40
00:01:40,439 --> 00:01:44,700
looking forward to see the good outcome

41
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:46,500
Minister for agriculture Fisheries food

42
00:01:44,700 --> 00:01:49,079
security and rural development honorable

43
00:01:46,500 --> 00:01:51,299
Alfred Prosper says with the numerous

44
00:01:49,079 --> 00:01:53,640
challenges that the sector faces the

45
00:01:51,299 --> 00:01:55,380
introduction of small Machinery as part

46
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:57,600
of efforts to make the agriculture

47
00:01:55,380 --> 00:02:00,000
sector more attractive to the younger

48
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:02,640
population he emphasizes the importance

49
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:04,020
of adapting to farm mechanization as one

50
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,899
of the innovations that could be

51
00:02:04,020 --> 00:02:08,759
critical to Future food security because

52
00:02:06,899 --> 00:02:11,280
it allows for the production of more

53
00:02:08,759 --> 00:02:13,680
crops at a lower cost Farmers have been

54
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:16,080
operating more seasonal than year round

55
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:20,040
I want to know that our farmers can

56
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:22,080
produce from January to December every

57
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:24,480
year and not have to suffer the

58
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:26,280
consequences of weather conditions in in

59
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:28,500
the dry season when production is always

60
00:02:26,280 --> 00:02:30,660
low in order for us to meet our food

61
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:34,620
security needs the strategy must

62
00:02:30,660 --> 00:02:37,920
Encompass new technologies and this is a

63
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:40,739
simple and easy form of bringing this

64
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:43,980
technology into the sector and more

65
00:02:40,739 --> 00:02:45,959
importantly I am convinced mechanization

66
00:02:43,980 --> 00:02:48,360
will attract more young persons into the

67
00:02:45,959 --> 00:02:49,200
sector I've always said young persons

68
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,080
are not

69
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:54,900
soaking on using the crew bar and using

70
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,480
the garden for can using cutlasses but

71
00:02:54,900 --> 00:03:00,360
they are getting to understanding value

72
00:02:57,480 --> 00:03:02,400
of small implements like this to ensure

73
00:03:00,360 --> 00:03:03,959
that they can reduce production costs

74
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,180
and make a greater profit from the

75
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,239
sector the next phase of the initiative

76
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:11,640
will see a public showcase to introduce

77
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:14,940
Farmers to the logistics of accessing

78
00:03:11,640 --> 00:03:16,620
the Machinery as well as its cost from

79
00:03:14,940 --> 00:03:19,080
the communications unit of the Ministry
