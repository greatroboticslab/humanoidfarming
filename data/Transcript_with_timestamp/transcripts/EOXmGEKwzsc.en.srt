a run of the river diversion intake

30
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,400
feeds a primary canal by gravity

31
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:06,159
which serves several irrigation blocks

32
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:09,200
in which water is distributed from

33
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:12,560
so-called secondary

34
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:14,640
tertiary and finally portonary canals

35
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:17,040
in order to cover as widely as possible

36
00:01:14,640 --> 00:01:19,360
the entire area to irrigate

37
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:21,520
finally any excess water is collected

38
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:27,439
via a drain in order to be discharged

39
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:30,060
into the rivers downstream

[Music]

42
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:38,079
the topography and hydrography of the

43
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
imbo have guided the organization of the

44
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:41,520
area into small holder farms since the

45
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:43,360
1950s

46
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:45,200
with the aim of promoting food and

47
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:47,360
industrial crops

48
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,119
but it was only in the 1970s that

49
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:49,840
irrigation networks were built to

50
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,720
intensify

00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,720
development of the smallholder farms

00:01:52,720 --> 00:01:57,040
this potential was however strongly

53
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:59,119
threatened in the late 2000s

54
00:01:57,040 --> 00:02:00,159
due to poor maintenance and management

55
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:02,320
of the networks

56
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:05,920
resulting from the political instability

00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:09,039
of the region during the 1990s

58

kagunda rivers

00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
