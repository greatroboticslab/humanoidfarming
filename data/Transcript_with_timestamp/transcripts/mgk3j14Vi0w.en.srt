Optimizer or city shooter solution

87
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:50,560
before planting SE seeds shallowly and

88
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:53,920
cover them with black paper to shorten

101
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:31,600
should now apply fertilizers from

leaves show white waxy material and to

127
00:05:41,960 --> 00:05:49,639
control apply thander all profine seites

128
00:05:45,720 --> 00:05:52,759
at the late of 10 ml per 20 L of

129

134
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:11,599
to control them the other one is loot

l cap scum diseases and how to control

141
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:36,000
them the most destructive disease is

142
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:39,599
bright it is caused by Fungus phool

143
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:43,280
capsa that leads to Rapid Folia flute

144
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:46,280
and lutro to control apply R gold at the

145
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:49,560
rate of 50 g per 20 l or mistress at the

146
00:06:46,280 --> 00:06:53,039
rate of 30 G per 20 lit the best way

147
00:06:49,560 --> 00:06:53,039
here is to prevent the

148
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:59,879
infection the next disease is dowy M

149
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,440
this disease causes yellow spot on the

150
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,639
Leaf surfaces and Browning leading to

151
00:07:02,440 --> 00:07:08,280
Leaf Drop and sunb to prevent down M

152
00:07:05,639 --> 00:07:11,840
apply at least little gold at the rate

153
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:15,120
of 50 g per 20 L of water the other

154
00:07:11,840 --> 00:07:18,680
disease is fium whe fium whe is caused

155
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:22,360
by fium oxum this soil bone fungus leads

156
00:07:18,680 --> 00:07:26,000
to vein clearing yellowing and wieling

157
00:07:22,360 --> 00:07:29,800
to control fium whe drain the soil with

158
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:32,919
absolute aate of 10 m per 20 L of water

159
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:35,199
absolute is fungicide the other disease

160
00:07:32,919 --> 00:07:37,479
which is very very critical is bacteria

161
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:39,240
weight this bacterial disease causes

162
00:07:37,479 --> 00:07:42,160
wieling of young leaves and

163
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,520
discoloration of vascular tissues contr

164
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:49,960
it apply green cup at the rate of 2.5 g

165
00:07:46,520 --> 00:07:54,319
per liter which is a copper based

166
00:07:49,960 --> 00:07:56,960
product this will tend to suppress the

167
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:59,800
spread of the

168
00:07:56,960 --> 00:08:03,199
fungus capsum farming in Kenya can be
