  "text": "what if one Zone on your sprinkler system isn't coming on or isn't shutting off but the rest of your system's working okay could be your valve could be your controller or it could be your wiring how do you tell which today we're going to help you troubleshoot your malfunctioning Zone Dwayne Smith here your irrigation product specialist let's get to it [Music] in order to properly troubleshoot some of the electrical components you will either need a solenoid activator chatterer or you could use a Multimeter also called a volt meter for this video we will be using the Pro 50 activator chatter by Armada an activator is a tester that's specifically designed for irrigation and it makes this task much simpler we have an almost identical video to this one where we go through the same process using a volt meter if you don't have access to an activator cheddar go and check out the other video that uses the multimeter so let's start troubleshooting problem one a zone won't stop running even when the controller is set to stop watering if the watering is definitely off at the controller then this kind of issue is something that would probably not be caused by a faulty controller it's nearly certain that's a valve issue let's talk about what that looks like if your Zone should not be on but the sprinklers in that zone are on or they're sort of on maybe they've got water dribbling from the top of several heads or if you few heads are popping up and not just for a few minutes after the Zone shuts off it's happening continuously then the valve for that zone is not closing all the way so in that case you're going to have to find and replace the bow problem two one zone isn't coming on all the way that may look like several heads not popping up within the Zone perhaps none of them are but there's water seeping from the top of some of the heads then most likely your valve isn't opening all the way if that's the case you're going to need to find and replace that valve although another possibility is that you've got a broken pipe you'll almost certainly have a wet mushy spot in the yard and maybe even a puddle you'll need to turn off the water at the back flow or water meter and then repair that brake problem three one zone won't come on at all this is the most difficult problem to diagnose I have seen one case where the customer's module was not properly seated and there was an error code on the control roller if you have a modular controller make sure that the module is inserted properly and locked into place also make sure it's not a programming error go through the program to determine that the zone is scheduled to run and for how long you can run a manual cycle and Skip ahead to that zone most controllers will have some sort of indicator on the screen to show that The Zone should be on if the controller is showing that the Zone should be running but the sprinklers in that zone are not coming on at all this could be a problem with the controller itself the wiring between the controller and the valve or the solenoid on the valve we'll need to do some electrical troubleshooting let's talk briefly about what happens when a controller activates a valve to activate a Zone the controller sends 24 volts of electricity through a lead wire to the solenoid on the valve the solenoid is connected to both the lead wire and to a common wire the common wire is also connected to all the valves in your system and heads back to the controller that completes the circuit when the solenoid is activated it opens up the valve sending water to the sprinklers so let's check to see if the controller is working properly grab your Pro 50 hit the power button you should see this screen this is a 24 volt system this is only going to work on a regular controller not a battery operated one I'm going to hit the arrow key to the right to indicate 24 volts now I've got this screen I'm testing for vac so I hit the F3 key under vac I'm going to put one clip on the common and one on the Zone which I'm testing start a manual cycle for that zone you're testing and I should see around 24 volts in this case it's a little over It's Not Unusual there will be some voltage loss in the wiring depending on how long your wiring is to the valve and the gauge of the wire so a little extra juice here at the terminals not a bad thing at all this terminal is definitely working if the terminal is not working that means your controller is malfunctioning or if you have a modular controller it could just be that the module is bad you could try replacing that module if you have another terminal that's not being used you could switch the wire from the non-working Zone to the available terminal and reprogram the controller to run that zone instead even if you can make that work you will still probably have to replace the controller eventually because it's on its way out but this will buy you some time maybe even a few seasons if you don't have another terminal available and assuming it's not a module issue you're going to need a new controller it's a great time to upgrade if you've got a base model you might want to check out a smart controller that can change its programming based on local weather stations and you can program it with your smartphone so check out the choices on sprinklerwarehouse.com assuming that your terminal is working perfectly your problem is either the solenoid on your valve or the wiring to test the wiring and the solenoid wheel will be testing resistance push the arrow key on the Pro 50 until you get to this screen press the F2 key underneath the omega symbol leave the clips on the terminals the readings will jump around a little bit and then settle I've got 42 ohms that's good a 24 volt system like this is going to be between 20 and 60 ohms if you've got a battery operated system that you're testing that would mean that the solenoid on your valve is DC latching you'll see around 5 to 10 ohms resistance ratings for the valve you have are available on the manufacturer's website if the screen is showing this three line lines you've got a break in the wiring or a bad solenoid if you've got a short in the system you'll see something like this less than 5 ohms it may even read zero ohms it means that you've got wires touching somewhere that shouldn't be touching so let's assume that you've got a bad report here the Pro 50 has indicated either a break in a circuit or a short then we'll need to move out to the valve to continue troubleshooting out here at the valve disconnect the wires from the solenoid from the wiring coming from the controller we're going to test the solenoid a few different ways you don't need to do all of this just pick one the most direct way is to turn on the solenoid put the clips on the solenoid wires press F3 for 24 volt system and F1 if you've got a battery operated system with DC latching solenoids from this screen press F1 The Zone should come on let it run for just a few seconds and F3 to turn it off one note here if you have a master valve on your system the water is not going to come on unless the controller is currently running the Zone you're testing the master valve proceeds all the valves in your system and nothing can run without it on it another option is to chatter the solenoid now you don't want to chatter the solenoid with the water on the water to your system should be turned off at the backflow or at the water main if you're chattering press the F2 button to chatter it sounds like this foreign and yet another test you can do would be to test the resistance just like we did at the controller I'm going to press the right arrow button and then press f2 underneath the omega symbol because this is a 24 vac system I'm looking for something between 20 and 60 ohms 43 ohms that's good less than 5 ohms or if you get like the three lines like this then the solenoid is Bad If This Were DC latching solenoid 5 to 10 ohms would indicate a good solenoid so if you've got a bad solenoid you need to replace either the solenoid or the entire valve usually the price difference between a replacement solenoid and the entire valve is usually just a couple of bucks I would go ahead and buy a new valve if I were you if you're just replacing the solenoid you'll need to find out the correct one for your model of valve the valve solenoids are not generic there's a specific one you need if you're replacing the entire valve any valve that's the same type and size will do now when I say type I mean inline anti-siphon angle this is an inline one and it's a one inch valve so you can replace it with any one inch valve that's in line you don't have to match modeler brand any brand works with any controller Etc you do need to buy a DC latching solenoid version if your system is battery powered system and finally Let's test the wiring connect the clips to the wires coming from the controller start the Zone you're testing set your Pro 50 to test for vac like we did earlier and we're looking for around 24 vac once again if you get three lines you've got broken wiring if you get something really low it could be a short check your Connections in the valve box hopefully that's the problem try making fresh connections and always use waterproof wire connectors if that doesn't fix it you may need to run new wire which is a real pain if you happen to have multi-strand wire coming into the valve and one of the strands in the multi-strand is not being used and congratulations you've just hit the jackpot somebody's already run your new wire for you just swap to an unused wire and swap the wire back at the controller if there is another valve nearby an option is to use a doubler the doubler operates two valves using only one lead wire that could potentially save you a lot of work and headaches so check out that option hope this helps questions chat with one of our incredible customer
