1
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,680
I'm and my

2
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,680
partner my

3
00:00:12,920 --> 00:00:17,600
ising is

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:20,199
hyal farming it is a practice of growing

5
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:22,000
FR which tack like in the indust it is

6
00:00:20,199 --> 00:00:24,640
introduced it is developed by the Dix

7
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,119
and in the year of 1999 he was the

8
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:28,359
environmental health scientist in

9
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,599
Columbia University as you can see it is

10
00:00:28,359 --> 00:00:32,800
a water tank which Supply water to the

11
00:00:30,599 --> 00:00:34,960
every portion of the without missing you

12
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,160
can it down how the water is transported

13
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,280
to the so we are using here dripping

14
00:00:37,160 --> 00:00:41,719
system dripping system will help the

15
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:43,600
plants for suppl of water the dripping

16
00:00:41,719 --> 00:00:46,399
system means we are inserting holes to

17
00:00:43,600 --> 00:00:49,800
the plants and with along with the water

18
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:52,960
we are adding man mix to so water it

19
00:00:49,800 --> 00:00:56,840
will give nutrients to the

20
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,399
plants hydroponic form Hydro water plant

21
00:00:56,840 --> 00:01:00,840
the plant which grows in the water that

22
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,000
is called hydroponic form

23
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:03,879
demonstrated by John socks in the year

24
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:06,520
of

25
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:10,799
1960 what I want to explain how the

26
00:01:06,520 --> 00:01:14,320
plant will grows here we have set

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,799
one will the water to theer can and will

28
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:16,799
flow to

29
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:31,119
the so we are using man Mi it is

30
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:33,880
prepared by the cang and it is purify in

31
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:37,240
this tank and will get the liquid that

32
00:01:33,880 --> 00:01:37,240
we are spray to the

33
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:46,759
plants it will help the plant away from

34
00:01:40,759 --> 00:01:48,880
the Ines and next is p p p is natural

35
00:01:46,759 --> 00:01:51,680
fertilizer and it will the booster of

36
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:54,360
the plant growth and it helps to the

37
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:57,360
control of the pest and it helps to the

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,479
uh good fruits good production and um

39
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,840
away from the Beats for the products of

40
00:01:59,479 --> 00:02:01,840
the pun

41
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:10,840
andk

42
00:02:05,399 --> 00:02:13,040
and and first we have to mix the and G

43
00:02:10,840 --> 00:02:17,000
for 4 days and we have to decompos for 4

44
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:20,400
days after deos decompos days we have to

45
00:02:17,000 --> 00:02:24,400
add add all the products and we have to

46
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:28,200
decompose it for 10 or two weeks 10 or

47
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:31,840
days and decompos and have to St that

48
00:02:28,200 --> 00:02:31,840
for one day two days

49
00:02:32,760 --> 00:02:35,680
is for

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:43,800
theity so next watering system imagine

51
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:46,159
if you are going to a trip for one or

52
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:50,680
two weeks they had

53
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,680
a the plants will the doubt is

54
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,840
clearly are taking a box and inserting H

55
00:02:55,920 --> 00:03:00,319
in that H the water plant should be

56
00:02:57,840 --> 00:03:02,959
correctly inserted and we have to add

57
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:05,200
water in the and in the water plant on

58
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:08,680
the Bas we have to put holes and we have

59
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,799
to get put the good water absor such as

60
00:03:08,680 --> 00:03:14,360
cotton and wood we are promoting cotton

61
00:03:10,799 --> 00:03:16,720
for absortion of water the the cotton

62
00:03:14,360 --> 00:03:18,920
will absorb water and it helps the soil

63
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:21,319
to moisture when the soil is moist will

64
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:26,440
be moisture The Roots will observe the

65
00:03:21,319 --> 00:03:26,440
moist of the soil if you want to add any

66
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:31,519
organic soltion solution

67
00:03:30,439 --> 00:03:34,959
we can

68
00:03:31,519 --> 00:03:37,200
directly if it is in the we can directly

69
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:39,920
in the water and it is absor with and it

70
00:03:37,200 --> 00:03:42,400
is Lally absorbed by the roots

71
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:44,599
and benefits of partical farming

72
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,560
nowadays we can see the soil fertility

73
00:03:44,599 --> 00:03:48,239
is decreasing day by day so we have to

74
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:50,519
promote these types of farming for

75
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:52,079
goodal for farmers who are the small and

76
00:03:50,519 --> 00:03:53,760
marginalized Farmer they have to promote

77
00:03:52,079 --> 00:03:56,159
this types of farming who are putting

78
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,599
the high income in the chemical inputs

79
00:03:56,159 --> 00:04:01,920
they have to promote this type of F and

80
00:03:58,599 --> 00:04:04,480
it is only it is only is natural it will

81
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,079
not damage our environment it is

82
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:09,079
eco-friendly in the nature so that

83
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:10,920
finally we want to conclude that we have

84
00:04:09,079 --> 00:04:13,879
to promote these types of system in our

85
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,959
country for the for the protection of

86
00:04:13,879 --> 00:04:19,120
our

87
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,120
environment thank you
