00:00:14,790 --> 00:00:20,860
hello everybody I'm per Mille and I'm

3
00:00:18,790 --> 00:00:22,450
Ryan we're the founders a perfect day

4
00:00:20,860 --> 00:00:24,850
and we're excited to share our story

5
00:00:22,450 --> 00:00:27,040
with you today I was born and raised in

6
00:00:24,850 --> 00:00:30,820
India and I moved to the US four years

7
00:00:27,040 --> 00:00:33,610
ago in 2013 my parents moved from India

8
00:00:30,820 --> 00:00:35,260
to America in the 1980s I was born and

9
00:00:33,610 --> 00:00:37,989
raised in Connecticut where I had a

10
00:00:35,260 --> 00:00:40,120
fairly typical American childhood here's

11
00:00:37,989 --> 00:00:41,370
the funny thing we didn't actually know

12
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:43,900
each other when we started the company

13
00:00:41,370 --> 00:00:46,360
four years ago when we met for the first

14
00:00:43,900 --> 00:00:48,309
time we realized that we had two things

15
00:00:46,360 --> 00:00:50,320
in common both of us

16
00:00:48,309 --> 00:00:54,879
wanted to have impact on a global scale

17
00:00:50,320 --> 00:00:57,489
and we loved food we both grew up eating

18
00:00:54,879 --> 00:00:59,140
real meat and dairy products enjoying

19
00:00:57,489 --> 00:01:02,019
their delicious indulgent taste

20
00:00:59,140 --> 00:01:04,570
who doesn't love a rich ice cream or a

21
00:01:02,019 --> 00:01:07,360
melty gooey cheese these tastes are

22
00:01:04,570 --> 00:01:09,640
deeply ingrained in our memories but as

23
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:11,920
we got older we started to develop an

24
00:01:09,640 --> 00:01:13,750
awareness of the big picture we started

25
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:16,330
to learn about global climate change and

26
00:01:13,750 --> 00:01:18,360
ask questions about how our lifestyle

27
00:01:16,330 --> 00:01:20,860
might be contributing to the problems

28
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,690
eventually we came to learn that our

29
00:01:20,860 --> 00:01:24,900
diet in particular was having a greater

30
00:01:22,690 --> 00:01:27,400
impact than we might have wanted and so

31
00:01:24,900 --> 00:01:30,400
around the beginning of college we both

32
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:31,300
decided to go vegetarian now this wasn't

33
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:33,040
terribly difficult

34
00:01:31,300 --> 00:01:35,170
we basically replaced all the meat we

35
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:36,760
were eating with eggs and dairy you sort

36
00:01:35,170 --> 00:01:40,090
of cling to the only animal products you

37
00:01:36,760 --> 00:01:42,040
have left but eventually our commitment

38
00:01:40,090 --> 00:01:44,560
to the big picture led us to realize

39
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:47,920
that eggs and dairy are part of the very

40
00:01:44,560 --> 00:01:51,100
same problematic system as meat and so a

41
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:54,160
few years later we painfully made the

42
00:01:51,100 --> 00:01:55,900
transition to being fully vegan this

43
00:01:54,160 --> 00:01:59,790
meant we were no longer eating any meat

44
00:01:55,900 --> 00:02:01,560
nor eggs nor most difficult for us dairy

45
00:01:59,790 --> 00:02:03,930
can you imagine

46
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:07,240
say goodbye to cream in your coffee

47
00:02:03,930 --> 00:02:11,080
butter on your toast cheese in all its

48
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:14,430
delightful forms it thought I actually

49
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:14,430
hated my life back then

50
00:02:15,010 --> 00:02:22,209
we were trying to do the right thing but

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:24,489
it was so hard when we changed to a

52
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:26,739
vegan diet that single decision

53
00:02:24,489 --> 00:02:28,780
completely changed our relationship with

54
00:02:26,739 --> 00:02:30,940
food we can no longer find good options

55
00:02:28,780 --> 00:02:32,769
to eat all of the dairy alternatives

56
00:02:30,940 --> 00:02:34,330
that were available felt like they were

57
00:02:32,769 --> 00:02:38,049
held together with glue instead of real

58
00:02:34,330 --> 00:02:39,910
food and the worst part we can no longer

59
00:02:38,049 --> 00:02:41,379
enjoy the social elements of just

60
00:02:39,910 --> 00:02:44,110
sharing food with family and friends

61
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:48,250
because none of them wanted to adopt a

62
00:02:44,110 --> 00:02:48,640
vegan diet the diet that is good for the

63
00:02:48,250 --> 00:02:51,280
planet

64
00:02:48,640 --> 00:02:53,590
and good for the animals forces you to

65
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:56,379
compromise it forces you to compromise

66
00:02:53,590 --> 00:02:58,540
on flavor on nutrition and on the

67
00:02:56,379 --> 00:03:01,780
overall experience and that was the

68
00:02:58,540 --> 00:03:04,329
inspiration for us well we started by

69
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:06,819
taking a step back and looking at how

70
00:03:04,329 --> 00:03:09,099
the food system works today for animal

71
00:03:06,819 --> 00:03:12,040
products and when you do that you

72
00:03:09,099 --> 00:03:14,260
quickly realize two things the first is

73
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:17,230
that animal agriculture is extremely

74
00:03:14,260 --> 00:03:19,840
inefficient the way we produce animal

75
00:03:17,230 --> 00:03:22,000
protein today is posing a huge challenge

76
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,349
to the environment I'm not going to give

77
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:24,880
you the numbers or hit you over the head

78
00:03:23,349 --> 00:03:27,579
with the statistics you can easily look

79
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:30,430
those up but know that animal

80
00:03:27,579 --> 00:03:33,910
agriculture is posing a grave threat to

81
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:36,700
our planet as it is why because there

82
00:03:33,910 --> 00:03:38,440
are 70 billion land animals today but

83
00:03:36,700 --> 00:03:40,989
they feed only 7 billion people

84
00:03:38,440 --> 00:03:43,299
most of the food we grow as a society

85
00:03:40,989 --> 00:03:45,549
goes towards feeding those 70 billion

86
00:03:43,299 --> 00:03:48,400
and only a small part of it is converted

87
00:03:45,549 --> 00:03:51,190
into useful food for us it's crazy

88
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:53,109
the natural resources like water and

89
00:03:51,190 --> 00:03:55,299
land that are required to produce these

90
00:03:53,109 --> 00:03:57,819
products at scale are becoming more and

91
00:03:55,299 --> 00:04:00,220
more scarce day by day but the demand is

92
00:03:57,819 --> 00:04:03,459
only growing and that brings us to the

93
00:04:00,220 --> 00:04:05,500
second troubling trend you see it's hard

94
00:04:03,459 --> 00:04:08,049
enough to produce sufficient animal

95
00:04:05,500 --> 00:04:10,060
protein to meet the demand of today what

96
00:04:08,049 --> 00:04:12,220
about tomorrow despite a growing

97
00:04:10,060 --> 00:04:13,599
awareness of these challenges we find

98
00:04:12,220 --> 00:04:15,549
that demand for animal protein is still

99
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,320
only increasing all over the world and

100
00:04:15,549 --> 00:04:19,239
as you've probably heard a hundred times

101
00:04:17,320 --> 00:04:21,099
today the world population is expected

102
00:04:19,239 --> 00:04:24,669
to surpass nine and a half billion by

103
00:04:21,099 --> 00:04:25,990
2050 interesting to me is that many of

104
00:04:24,669 --> 00:04:28,300
these new people are going to be in

105
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:28,750
developing economies we're at the larger

106
00:04:28,300 --> 00:04:30,970
and wealth

107
00:04:28,750 --> 00:04:32,650
middle-class emerges typically one of

108
00:04:30,970 --> 00:04:33,910
the first things that these empowered

109
00:04:32,650 --> 00:04:36,760
new consumers start to spend their money

110
00:04:33,910 --> 00:04:38,620
on its animal protein if you combine

111
00:04:36,760 --> 00:04:41,020
these two factors you have a perfect

112
00:04:38,620 --> 00:04:43,120
storm not only do we need to produce far

113
00:04:41,020 --> 00:04:45,430
more protein but we have to do so in a

114
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:48,250
way that is fundamentally less damaging

115
00:04:45,430 --> 00:04:49,690
than what we do today now sure the easy

116
00:04:48,250 --> 00:04:51,250
answer would be for everyone to just

117
00:04:49,690 --> 00:04:53,380
stop eating animal products and switch

118
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:55,240
to alternatives but we can tell you from

119
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:55,750
firsthand experience that's easier said

120
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,780
than done

121
00:04:55,750 --> 00:05:00,430
let's ultimately why we've set out to

122
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:03,150
support the evolution of our food system

123
00:05:00,430 --> 00:05:05,680
as a whole by creating a more secure

124
00:05:03,150 --> 00:05:08,530
environmentally friendly and nutritious

125
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:12,010
source of protein without the use of a

126
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:13,990
single animal in the entire process okay

127
00:05:12,010 --> 00:05:17,080
so how do you make animal protein

128
00:05:13,990 --> 00:05:19,420
without animals I remember I had that

129
00:05:17,080 --> 00:05:22,600
exact question in my mind one day at

130
00:05:19,420 --> 00:05:24,430
work back in 2014 at the time I was

131
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:25,960
developing antibodies and other

132
00:05:24,430 --> 00:05:29,350
medicines using the tools of

133
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:31,720
biotechnology and I had this sort of aha

134
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:35,760
lightbulb moment when I realized that

135
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:38,910
the antibodies I was making already were

136
00:05:35,760 --> 00:05:42,130
animal proteins made without animals

137
00:05:38,910 --> 00:05:44,410
which led to the question could this

138
00:05:42,130 --> 00:05:46,570
very same technology be used to make

139
00:05:44,410 --> 00:05:48,700
high quality protein for the food

140
00:05:46,570 --> 00:05:51,220
industry that wouldn't have these kind

141
00:05:48,700 --> 00:05:52,600
of impact on the environment and on

142
00:05:51,220 --> 00:05:56,080
animals and all these other different

143
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:58,240
things that's ultimately when I met

144
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,130
param all in 2014 what surprised me so

145
00:05:58,240 --> 00:06:02,140
much about us is that he had come to the

146
00:06:00,130 --> 00:06:04,270
exact same realization through his work

147
00:06:02,140 --> 00:06:05,920
in biomedicine and that's why we teamed

148
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:08,230
up and joined forces to start perfect

149
00:06:05,920 --> 00:06:10,690
day we had recognized an untapped

150
00:06:08,230 --> 00:06:11,500
opportunity to create protein using

151
00:06:10,690 --> 00:06:15,670
these technologies

152
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:17,380
the key is fermentation fermentation is

153
00:06:15,670 --> 00:06:19,510
the art and science of just converting

154
00:06:17,380 --> 00:06:21,790
nutrients from one form into the other

155
00:06:19,510 --> 00:06:25,240
we've created a type of yeast that

156
00:06:21,790 --> 00:06:27,250
converts sugar into milk protein that is

157
00:06:25,240 --> 00:06:30,610
the key to our technology and our entire

158
00:06:27,250 --> 00:06:33,130
platform the cool thing is we're taking

159
00:06:30,610 --> 00:06:35,080
sugar something that the world is pretty

160
00:06:33,130 --> 00:06:37,990
good at producing and we're converting

161
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:40,080
it into high-quality nutritious protein

162
00:06:37,990 --> 00:06:42,449
that the world is demanding

163
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:44,310
we've designed our process to fit in to

164
00:06:42,449 --> 00:06:45,840
existing infrastructure that's found all

165
00:06:44,310 --> 00:06:48,060
over the globe and we're working with

166
00:06:45,840 --> 00:06:51,000
the industry to scale up and we will be

167
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:52,740
out there in a big way pretty soon if

168
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:53,819
you're wondering what our process

169
00:06:52,740 --> 00:06:56,009
actually looks like

170
00:06:53,819 --> 00:06:57,360
imagine a beer brewery if you walk into

171
00:06:56,009 --> 00:06:59,190
our production process in the future

172
00:06:57,360 --> 00:07:01,379
there'll be these beautiful giant

173
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:03,629
stainless steel tanks inside it will be

174
00:07:01,379 --> 00:07:07,020
yeast that's converting sugar into milk

175
00:07:03,629 --> 00:07:09,330
protein for human use our platform

176
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:11,430
allows us to make any protein out there

177
00:07:09,330 --> 00:07:14,190
but we chose dairy proteins for two

178
00:07:11,430 --> 00:07:17,190
reasons its nutrition and its

179
00:07:14,190 --> 00:07:18,990
functionality dairy protein is the most

180
00:07:17,190 --> 00:07:21,810
nutritious source of protein available

181
00:07:18,990 --> 00:07:23,879
to humans today it contains all the

182
00:07:21,810 --> 00:07:26,129
essential amino acids required it's

183
00:07:23,879 --> 00:07:28,409
super digestible it helps in everything

184
00:07:26,129 --> 00:07:30,000
from muscle recovery to halting stunted

185
00:07:28,409 --> 00:07:33,330
growth and children and it also delivers

186
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,460
a ton of calcium to your body on the

187
00:07:33,330 --> 00:07:38,819
functionality side these proteins are

188
00:07:35,460 --> 00:07:40,199
the reason dairy is so amazing when you

189
00:07:38,819 --> 00:07:42,120
take a scoop of yogurt and put it in

190
00:07:40,199 --> 00:07:45,750
your mouth that body that creaminess

191
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:47,520
that mouthfeel it's all the protein the

192
00:07:45,750 --> 00:07:49,860
reason milk is white in color is because

193
00:07:47,520 --> 00:07:51,719
of the protein the reason when you take

194
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:53,669
a slice of pizza from the entire pie

195
00:07:51,719 --> 00:07:55,650
that beautiful stretch that you see when

196
00:07:53,669 --> 00:07:59,699
you're removing that piece of pizza it's

197
00:07:55,650 --> 00:08:02,400
the protein if you tried to make cheese

198
00:07:59,699 --> 00:08:05,009
using plant protein the best thing you

199
00:08:02,400 --> 00:08:07,169
can actually make today is tofu now

200
00:08:05,009 --> 00:08:09,690
don't get me wrong I like tofu

201
00:08:07,169 --> 00:08:11,460
but it ain't cheese our plan is to

202
00:08:09,690 --> 00:08:13,560
create a new way for the world to make

203
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:15,659
dairy proteins so that we can all go on

204
00:08:13,560 --> 00:08:18,240
eating our favorite food products just

205
00:08:15,659 --> 00:08:20,580
healthier kinder and greener than ever

206
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,669
before if we can create proteins that

207
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,469
are more sustainable and more humane and

208
00:08:22,669 --> 00:08:27,509
better for everyone involved then the

209
00:08:25,469 --> 00:08:30,240
animal equivalent but still deliver on

210
00:08:27,509 --> 00:08:32,459
taste and price and convenience then the

211
00:08:30,240 --> 00:08:34,770
dilemma disappears the choice that's

212
00:08:32,459 --> 00:08:36,659
best for our bodies and for animals and

213
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:38,519
the planet can become the default answer

214
00:08:36,659 --> 00:08:40,860
for consumers because we're no longer

215
00:08:38,519 --> 00:08:42,959
asking anyone to compromise and that is

216
00:08:40,860 --> 00:08:44,790
what separates us from the pack if you

217
00:08:42,959 --> 00:08:46,560
look at plant proteins they're just not

218
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:49,709
functional and they're not nutritious

219
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,930
that's why food manufacturers when they

220
00:08:49,709 --> 00:08:53,550
use plant proteins to make any product

221
00:08:51,930 --> 00:08:55,980
they're really

222
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:58,110
promisingly an emulsifier starches

223
00:08:55,980 --> 00:09:00,810
hydrocolloids gums things you really

224
00:08:58,110 --> 00:09:03,930
don't want in your food animal protein

225
00:09:00,810 --> 00:09:06,450
super functional super nutritious but

226
00:09:03,930 --> 00:09:08,880
it's not gonna scale it's just not

227
00:09:06,450 --> 00:09:10,529
sustainable we have created a solution

228
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,540
that's the best of both worlds

229
00:09:10,529 --> 00:09:14,760
it contains the nutrition of dairy

230
00:09:12,540 --> 00:09:16,860
because it is dairy protein but because

231
00:09:14,760 --> 00:09:18,779
it's produced in a new way it has the

232
00:09:16,860 --> 00:09:21,540
heart and soul of plant-based proteins

233
00:09:18,779 --> 00:09:25,350
it's way more sustainable a true win-win

234
00:09:21,540 --> 00:09:27,930
solution for us this isn't a solution

235
00:09:25,350 --> 00:09:30,450
for next generation the technology is

236
00:09:27,930 --> 00:09:33,149
possible today and the world urgently

237
00:09:30,450 --> 00:09:34,680
needs this as soon as possible the dairy

238
00:09:33,149 --> 00:09:36,329
industry itself may be reaching a

239
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,459
ceiling we've heard from people that

240
00:09:36,329 --> 00:09:39,930
work inside the dairy industry and are

241
00:09:38,459 --> 00:09:42,089
concerned whether dairy is going to be

242
00:09:39,930 --> 00:09:44,100
able to reach meat protein demand by

243
00:09:42,089 --> 00:09:45,779
2025 we're starting to hit the

244
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,990
biological limits of what we can make

245
00:09:45,779 --> 00:09:50,640
cows do meanwhile consumers are in the

246
00:09:48,990 --> 00:09:52,500
midst of a massive global shift away

247
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:54,750
from animal products animal protein in

248
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:56,220
particular parallel and I are two

249
00:09:54,750 --> 00:09:57,750
examples of this but you've probably

250
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:00,149
noticed this in your everyday life too

251
00:09:57,750 --> 00:10:01,529
we've read that more than 60% of

252
00:10:00,149 --> 00:10:02,910
Millennials are trying to reduce the

253
00:10:01,529 --> 00:10:04,709
amount of animal protein in their diet

254
00:10:02,910 --> 00:10:06,300
if not going all the way to vegetarian

255
00:10:04,709 --> 00:10:08,579
or vegan and that may sound like great

256
00:10:06,300 --> 00:10:10,290
news and it is don't get me wrong but

257
00:10:08,579 --> 00:10:11,610
it's nowhere near the kind of critical

258
00:10:10,290 --> 00:10:12,899
mass that we're going to need to really

259
00:10:11,610 --> 00:10:15,930
address the problems that we're talking

260
00:10:12,899 --> 00:10:17,490
about here finally food companies are

261
00:10:15,930 --> 00:10:19,140
always looking for innovative

262
00:10:17,490 --> 00:10:22,110
ingredients that can bring new

263
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:24,029
experiences to food our approach enables

264
00:10:22,110 --> 00:10:26,459
food innovation while solving some of

265
00:10:24,029 --> 00:10:28,470
the world's greatest challenges and that

266
00:10:26,459 --> 00:10:30,420
might just be why food companies are

267
00:10:28,470 --> 00:10:32,160
lining up to be among the first to work

268
00:10:30,420 --> 00:10:33,959
with our ingredients and we can't wait

269
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:35,790
to share it with them when we first

270
00:10:33,959 --> 00:10:38,670
started on this journey we were obsessed

271
00:10:35,790 --> 00:10:40,949
with making products like cheese yogurt

272
00:10:38,670 --> 00:10:43,199
ice cream finished goods but on the way

273
00:10:40,949 --> 00:10:45,209
we learned that dairy proteins offer

274
00:10:43,199 --> 00:10:48,089
functionality to a wide variety of

275
00:10:45,209 --> 00:10:49,620
products not just fresh dairy this mean

276
00:10:48,089 --> 00:10:51,209
that if we zoom out a little bit and

277
00:10:49,620 --> 00:10:53,579
take more of an ingredient centric

278
00:10:51,209 --> 00:10:55,680
approach perfect day dairy proteins and

279
00:10:53,579 --> 00:10:57,750
therefore our impact will be able to

280
00:10:55,680 --> 00:11:01,310
extend to products in every aisle of the

281
00:10:57,750 --> 00:11:03,959
grocery store not just the dairy case

282
00:11:01,310 --> 00:11:06,120
four years ago we were trying to have

283
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:08,070
impact by changing our individual diets

284
00:11:06,120 --> 00:11:09,630
two years ago we would have been happy

285
00:11:08,070 --> 00:11:12,300
with the impact of just launching a

286
00:11:09,630 --> 00:11:12,810
single product on the retail store but

287
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:14,670
today

288
00:11:12,810 --> 00:11:16,440
now that we've embraced an ingredient

289
00:11:14,670 --> 00:11:17,850
strategy and we've taken a broader look

290
00:11:16,440 --> 00:11:20,250
at how the food industry actually works

291
00:11:17,850 --> 00:11:22,410
we're truly blown away by the scale of

292
00:11:20,250 --> 00:11:24,570
impact we can have disrupting a nearly

293
00:11:22,410 --> 00:11:26,190
trillion-dollar market and looking

294
00:11:24,570 --> 00:11:27,870
forward we're really excited to partner

295
00:11:26,190 --> 00:11:29,370
with the industry to come up with

296
00:11:27,870 --> 00:11:30,630
creative solutions to some of the

297
00:11:29,370 --> 00:11:33,540
greatest problems challenging our

298
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:35,130
generation like how do all of us

299
00:11:33,540 --> 00:11:37,110
continue to enjoy the cheese on our

300
00:11:35,130 --> 00:11:39,810
pizza without having to compromise on

301
00:11:37,110 --> 00:11:43,110
the planet or our own nutrition or our

302
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:45,240
own experience the world is changing and

303
00:11:43,110 --> 00:11:47,040
the food system needs to change and

304
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:49,080
evolve with it and the two of us are

305
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:51,510
super excited that we have the rare

306
00:11:49,080 --> 00:11:55,550
opportunity to help drive that evolution

307
00:11:51,510 --> 00:11:55,550
in the field of dairy thank you

308
00:12:00,120 --> 00:12:02,180
you
