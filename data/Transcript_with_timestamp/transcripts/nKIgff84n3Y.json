  "text": "bedding is going to change with the season and uh with cattle, at least a lot of the individuals I'm working with, we're feeding uh calves, calves in the fall, maybe yearlings uh to get another turn through there. Uh when we bring them in in the fall, we're dealing with smaller calves, probably start them out on a a little bit uh less hot diet in terms of nutrients and so forth. Um it's normally dry. Um the bedding is the highest quality we're going to have each year. So that we're probably going to start out with using utilizing the least amount at that time. As winter goes on, hopefully the calves are growing. The quality of the bedding still good. We will have the the occasional snowstorms that come through and big openings on our buildings will allow uh some of that to come in. Need to adjust and then increase the amount of bedding when that happens. Uh spring we're dealing now with bigger cattle. Normally if we have some uh rain or so forth, the bedding is going to be wet. So part of its usefulness has already been used up. We have that thaw period and high humidity. So we're not going to get the the evaporation and we do get the frequent rains. So again, we're going to have to adjust our bedding upward. Now, uh, the last one is summer. And I put this on here for the people that have changed from a open feed lot to a bedded barn. They tell me that the biggest thing that was a aha moment in terms of it is you use more bedding in the summer than you did the fall and winter, which is the exact opposite. If you beded in an open lot, you beded during the winter, but you never did anything during the summer. With these facilities to keep things moving, one, you've got great big cattle. You've got hot conditions. The cattle are drinking more. Some of the uh feed ingredients we have may contain some additional sodium, some additional things that cause the animals to drink more. more drinking is going to produce more urine needs to be soaked up and often at the very end of the feeding period we're dealing with deterior deteriorated bedding. It's pretty much used up. So they'll often times use 50% more bedding in the summer than they do in the winter. And they did not expect that to be um when they started out with the facility.",
