2
00:00:00,439 --> 00:00:05,040
when cows and other ruminants eat their

3
00:00:03,419 --> 00:00:07,259
feet ferments in their stomach when

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:09,780
digested and a number of gases are

5
00:00:07,259 --> 00:00:11,820
produced including methane

6
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:13,080
the animals expel this gas through

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:15,299
burping

8
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:17,640
that sounds innocent enough except that

9
00:00:15,299 --> 00:00:20,039
methane is a greenhouse gas and a major

10
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:22,920
contributor to global warming

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:25,380
with an estimated 1.5 billion cows in

12
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:27,900
the world and 2 billion sheep and goats

13
00:00:25,380 --> 00:00:29,820
it's a big problem and one that climate

14
00:00:27,900 --> 00:00:31,560
action cannot ignore

15
00:00:29,820 --> 00:00:34,020
while methane has a much lower

16
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:36,540
atmospheric lifespan than carbon dioxide

17
00:00:34,020 --> 00:00:38,579
around 12 years compared to thousands of

18
00:00:36,540 --> 00:00:41,460
years it is a much more powerful

19
00:00:38,579 --> 00:00:43,980
greenhouse gas trapping 86 times more

20
00:00:41,460 --> 00:00:46,260
heat than carbon dioxide over a 20-year

21
00:00:43,980 --> 00:00:48,539
period and contributing strongly to

22
00:00:46,260 --> 00:00:51,360
Global temperature rise

23
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,760
globally digestive or enteric methane

24
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,360
emissions are equivalent to about 3.3

25
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:59,820
gigatons of carbon dioxide equivalents

26
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:03,059
that'll account for 77 of these

27
00:00:59,820 --> 00:01:05,460
emissions Buffalo 13 with smaller

28
00:01:03,059 --> 00:01:08,100
livestock making up the rest

29
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:10,020
so how do we reduce enteric methane

30
00:01:08,100 --> 00:01:12,360
emissions

31
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:14,100
across the world more and more countries

32
00:01:12,360 --> 00:01:15,960
are including livestock specific

33
00:01:14,100 --> 00:01:17,760
interventions to reach the Paris

34
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:19,920
agreement targets and sustainable

35
00:01:17,760 --> 00:01:22,259
development goals limiting Global

36
00:01:19,920 --> 00:01:24,000
temperature rise there is a way we can

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,640
increase their productivity and reduce

38
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,420
their emissions and that's by adopting

39
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:32,880
more sustainable farming practices

40
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:34,860
we can improve ruminance diets through

41
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:37,020
better grazing management changing

42
00:01:34,860 --> 00:01:39,479
plaster types use of specific feed

43
00:01:37,020 --> 00:01:41,100
additives and supplementing grazing with

44
00:01:39,479 --> 00:01:43,200
forage mixes

45
00:01:41,100 --> 00:01:45,720
adequate feed preparation and ration

46
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,939
balancing provide better nutrition in

47
00:01:45,720 --> 00:01:50,299
turn improving ruminant productivity and

48
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:50,299
fertility

49
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,740
better husbandry practices Inc in taking

50
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:57,960
better care of animals monitoring their

51
00:01:55,740 --> 00:02:00,240
health and intervening when signs of

52
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:02,399
illness occur can also greatly increase

53
00:02:00,240 --> 00:02:02,860
their productivity and reduce their

54
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,000
emissions

55
00:02:02,860 --> 00:02:08,399
[Music]

56
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,380
improving a herd's genetic stock through

57
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:11,640
selective breeding can also make a

58
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:13,800
difference

59
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:15,540
breeding animals that are better adapted

60
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:18,180
to their surroundings and conditions

61
00:02:15,540 --> 00:02:19,980
including climate and diseases makes

62
00:02:18,180 --> 00:02:21,540
them more resilient and generally more

63
00:02:19,980 --> 00:02:23,459
productive

64
00:02:21,540 --> 00:02:25,980
as countries have different farming

65
00:02:23,459 --> 00:02:27,900
practices and production systems methods

66
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:29,640
of reducing emissions vary from one

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,220
territory to another and must be

68
00:02:29,640 --> 00:02:34,620
country-specific to be effective

69
00:02:32,220 --> 00:02:36,900
taking steps to increase production and

70
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:38,819
reduce enteric methane emissions is not

71
00:02:36,900 --> 00:02:41,519
only beneficial to The Climate but can

72
00:02:38,819 --> 00:02:43,680
also improve farmers livelihoods

73
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:45,540
FAO and partners are working with

74
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:47,819
countries to assess their greenhouse gas

75
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:50,879
emissions and identify climate smart

76
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:52,620
actions in the livestock sector these

77
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:55,260
interventions can increase livestock

78
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,780
productivity improve food security and

79
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,599
livelihoods and reduce enteric methane

80
00:02:57,780 --> 00:03:02,340
emissions they are also providing

81
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,800
guidance to decision makers to

82
00:03:02,340 --> 00:03:07,560
incentivize livestock producers to adopt

83
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:10,319
Technology Innovation and best practices

84
00:03:07,560 --> 00:03:13,019
that enhance productivity

85
00:03:10,319 --> 00:03:15,000
through sustainable Livestock systems we

86
00:03:13,019 --> 00:03:17,280
can support climate action that not only

87
00:03:15,000 --> 00:03:19,500
benefits millions of people dependent on

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,580
livestock production but our entire
