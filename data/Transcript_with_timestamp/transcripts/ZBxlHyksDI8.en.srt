00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,920
skeptical

00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:20,160
right

46
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:21,520

52
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:37,200

just throw your towels in the bucket

93
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,800
and you push the button to release

94
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,800

[Music]

103
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:11,919
so i will say milking the cow was uh

104
00:05:10,240 --> 00:05:13,440
more automated than i thought it would

105
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,199
be you know once

106
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,800
matt showed me how everything works you

107
00:05:15,199 --> 00:05:19,199
know just making sure i put everything

108
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:21,440
in the right places and don't get hit by

109
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:23,120
the cow or don't have anything

110
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,440
drop on you

111
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:27,680
uh once i understood that process it

112
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:30,000
seemed very straightforward

113
00:05:27,680 --> 00:05:32,320
oh yeah she left you a present

114
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:35,039
she was she left the presents for you oh

115
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:37,280
thank you thank you now the trick is to

116
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:40,690
dodge it

117
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:43,860
did i roll up my sleeve for this one

118
00:05:40,690 --> 00:05:43,860
[Music]

119
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:51,440
i think i found my new job guys

120
00:05:49,440 --> 00:05:54,400
sorry stanley

121
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:55,919
i think this is the business for me

122
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,120
we have to increase our speed or we

123
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:01,039
won't get to milk twice today

124
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:03,360
when deal when's the first time y'all do

125
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,160
it in the day well you started four in

126
00:06:03,360 --> 00:06:09,720
the morning oh i changed my mind i like

127
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,720
my job now

128
00:06:11,340 --> 00:06:23,030
[Music]

129
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:28,800
oh

130
00:06:23,030 --> 00:06:30,800
[Music]

131
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:33,600
and then

132
00:06:30,800 --> 00:06:36,000
there's that thing all right

133
00:06:33,600 --> 00:06:38,800
a particular reason why y'all do it at

134
00:06:36,000 --> 00:06:41,199
uh those times of the day

135
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,560
it takes you about three hours to milk

136
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,080
so you want to get done in the afternoon

137
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:45,440
at a reasonable time

138
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,400
so you have to start early enough to get

139
00:06:45,440 --> 00:06:48,479
finished

140
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:50,960
do you take naps in between

141
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:50,960
at night

142
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:58,960
you know so when y'all get all this milk

143
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:00,560
where does it go

144
00:06:58,960 --> 00:07:02,800
got a refrigerated storage tank in the

145
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:04,240
other room

146
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,160
as it's coming out of the couch going

147
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:08,080
into this small tank

148
00:07:06,160 --> 00:07:10,240
and as it fills it automatically pumps

149
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,680
with the storage tank okay storage tanks

150
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:14,720
refrigerator

151
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:17,680
and then yeah somebody come pick it up

152
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:19,840
yes the marketing clock comes every two

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:21,759
to three days to pick the milk up okay

154
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,360
haul at the market

155
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:24,680
but see it's coming out of the couch

156
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:26,639
body temperature

157
00:07:24,680 --> 00:07:28,319
21.5 degrees

158
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:29,919
for a cow

159
00:07:28,319 --> 00:07:31,919
and two hours after it comes out of the

160
00:07:29,919 --> 00:07:34,240
cow we'll have it down to 36 degrees

161
00:07:31,919 --> 00:07:34,240
okay

162
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:37,360
the milk comes through stainless steel

163
00:07:36,000 --> 00:07:40,800
pipelines

164
00:07:37,360 --> 00:07:43,599
and goes into the refrigerated tank

165
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:45,599
you can hear the tanks running right now

166
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:49,520
and it's already cooled to melt down to

167
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:49,520
it's 38 degrees okay

168
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:55,319
okay you go up and inspect the milk that

169
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:55,319
you fly

170
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:05,919
what's good to me

171
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,759
maybe take a milk bath

172
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:09,120
anybody ever fallen in

173
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:11,120
no from time to time you don't have to

174
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:13,520
go in and clean it oh is that what you

175
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,850
have your sons for well unfortunately i

176
00:08:13,520 --> 00:08:19,500

180
00:08:32,320 --> 00:08:36,959
um you can see the stalls

181
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:38,959
hence the barn gets its name free stall

182
00:08:36,959 --> 00:08:42,080
the stalls don't have gates on them the

183
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,080
cows are free to come and go

184
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:46,560
they've got water

185
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,800
on the outside in the center they can

186
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:51,760
have access to at all times and they've

187
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:52,800
got feed in front of them all the time

188
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:54,720
so

189
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,320
the cows that you just milked

190
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:57,600

191
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,720

192
00:08:57,600 --> 00:09:00,160
