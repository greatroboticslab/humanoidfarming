we know what it feels like to be a new

la or lc when that realization hits oh

72
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:34,160
the farm bill's happening and wait it's

and second and most importantly and this

78
00:02:42,879 --> 00:02:45,680
is the one that explains today's topic

79
00:02:44,480 --> 00:02:48,239
in particular

80
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:50,319
is that nrdc recently released a report

81
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:52,800
regenerative agriculture firm policy for

82
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:54,239
the 21st century a link to the report is

83
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:57,360
available on the webpage for our

84
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:59,040
briefing today at www.esi.org

85
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,440
this incredible report is based on

86
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,280
interviews with 113 farmers and ranchers

87
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,159
across 47 states in the district of

88
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:08,879
columbia about about what regenerative

89
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:10,720
agriculture means to them as well as why

90
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:11,920
and how they put certain practices to

91
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:13,840
use

92
00:03:11,920 --> 00:03:15,599
this diversity of viewpoints is a major

93
00:03:13,840 --> 00:03:17,280
strength of the report and those

94
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:18,879
viewpoints helped inform the policy

95
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,800
recommendations findings and case

96
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
studies outlined in the report to

97
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,239
illustrate the numerous benefits of

98
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,239
regenerative agriculture which is

99
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:28,319
defined as a land management philosophy

100
00:03:26,239 --> 00:03:30,159
whereby farmers and ranchers grow food

101
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,000
and fiber and harmony with nature in

102
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:34,000
their communities all four of our

103
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:35,519

104
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:36,799
report

105
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:38,560
but before we turn it over to our

106
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,799

you from washington d.c and i want to

138
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,160

event today

142
00:04:50,960 --> 00:04:55,520
i may be a u.s senator but in my real

143
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:57,040
life i'm a farmer and it's always great

144
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,800
to get together with my fellow farmers

145
00:04:57,040 --> 00:05:00,880
and discuss the latest developments in

146
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,560
agriculture as a good friend of mine

147
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,720
once said there are about as many ways

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:07,199
to farm as there are farmers

149
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,039
regenerative ag is a critical piece of

150
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:10,880
the future of agriculture

151
00:05:09,039 --> 00:05:12,800
it's good for the soil

152
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:14,800
and it's good for the climate

153
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
and therefore it's good for the crops we

154
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:17,840
raise which means it works pretty well

155
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,440
for producers

156
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,680
i'm glad to see you all gathering here

157
00:05:19,440 --> 00:05:23,680
today to discuss the future of farming

158
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:24,960
and working to combat the climate crisis

159
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,280
that affected

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:28,160
rural communities across the treasure

161
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:29,600
state

162
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:31,199
i see the effects of warming

163
00:05:29,600 --> 00:05:32,639
temperatures on my farm especially with

164
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:34,800
the lack of moisture in north central

165
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:36,720
montana my wife charlotte and i have

166
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:38,400
been running our farm in big sandy for

167
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,160
44 years

168
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,320
and last year was by far the worst

169
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:44,720
harvest we've ever had because of

170
00:05:42,320 --> 00:05:47,039
extreme weather conditions

171
00:05:44,720 --> 00:05:48,560
i know we're not alone family farms

172
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:51,120
across montana are hurting and when

173
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:52,400
producers suffer our rural economies

174
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:54,400
also suffer

175
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,039
we've done some good work for montana

176
00:05:54,400 --> 00:06:00,080
producers by securing critical usda

177
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:01,919
disaster relief resources for farmers

178
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:04,000
affected by the drought and excessive

179
00:06:01,919 --> 00:06:05,840
moisture and fires

180
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:08,880
but there is more to do to combat the

181
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,639
underlying causes of these disasters

182
00:06:08,880 --> 00:06:12,880
regenerative agriculture is key to

183
00:06:10,639 --> 00:06:14,479
pushing us in the right direction so

184
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:17,520
thanks again for having me and know that

185
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:17,520

aruhi is the deputy director of

194
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:34,880
regenerative agriculture at the natural

195
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:36,479
resources defense council she advocates

196
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:38,400
for policies that promote regenerative

197
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,560
agriculture to mitigate climate change

198
00:06:38,400 --> 00:06:43,120
protect soil health conserve and reduce

199
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:44,720
water and restore biodiversity and she's

200
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:46,960
one of the lead authors of this report

201
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,880
regenerative agriculture farm policy for

202
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:50,160
the 21st century it is the subject for

203
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:52,240

with you on issues related to

215
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:16,720
agriculture and climate change and you

216
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,319
are absolutely right you are not alone

217
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:20,479
in experiencing the disruptions of

218
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,000
climate change on your farm the growers

219
00:07:20,479 --> 00:07:24,240
we spoke with across the country for

220
00:07:22,000 --> 00:07:26,400
this report have been facing and are

221
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:28,400
facing similar challenges but more on

222
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:30,880
that a little bit later

223
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,759
hello everyone my name is aruhi sharma

224
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,039
and

225
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,720
like was mentioned earlier i'm the

226
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,400
deputy director of regenerative

227
00:07:34,720 --> 00:07:39,199
agriculture for the natural resources

228
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:41,440
defense council nrdc for short

229
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:43,599
nrdc is an international environmental

230
00:07:41,440 --> 00:07:46,240
nonprofit organization that works to

231
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,560
preserve and protect natural resources

232
00:07:46,240 --> 00:07:50,479
people and communities

233
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:52,400
thanks to all of you for taking the time

234
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,000
to join our webinar this morning if

235
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:55,120
you're on pacific time like me or

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:57,440
afternoon

237
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,599
to discuss nrdc's recent report on

238
00:07:57,440 --> 00:08:01,840
regenerative agriculture titled

239
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:03,759
regenerative agriculture farm policy for

240
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:05,199
the 21st century

241
00:08:03,759 --> 00:08:06,720
for those who haven't had a chance to

242
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,000
read it through yet here's a quick

243
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,639
summary

244
00:08:08,000 --> 00:08:12,960
so this side shows how my team and i

245
00:08:10,639 --> 00:08:15,440
interviewed 113 farmers and ranchers

246
00:08:12,960 --> 00:08:17,360
across the country to learn more about

247
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,840
regenerative agriculture from the folks

248
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:22,319
doing the work on the ground

249
00:08:19,840 --> 00:08:24,639
with representation from 47 states and

250
00:08:22,319 --> 00:08:27,199
the district of columbia we got a pretty

251
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:29,680
good lay of the land pun intended and

252
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:31,520
learned what regenerative agriculture is

253
00:08:29,680 --> 00:08:33,519
its benefits and the barriers and

254
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,760
opportunities to bringing more acres

255
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,680
under regenerative management

256
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:40,880
a few notes about what we learned next

257
00:08:37,680 --> 00:08:42,479
slide please

258
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,160
the first is that regenerative

259
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:47,920
agriculture is not new it has deep roots

260
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,920
in indigenous wisdom

261
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:51,920
tribal communities have been practicing

262
00:08:49,920 --> 00:08:53,040
and managing lands regeneratively for

263
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:55,760
millennia

264
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,000
and now a growing number of farmers and

265
00:08:55,760 --> 00:09:00,560
ranchers are leaning on this indigenous

266
00:08:58,000 --> 00:09:02,880
knowledge to grow healthy food fight

267
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,320
climate change and build resiliency onto

268
00:09:02,880 --> 00:09:06,080
the land

269
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:08,000
now a bunch of you are probably saying

270
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:11,920
okay great well what is regenerative

271
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:14,320
agriculture well next slide please

272
00:09:11,920 --> 00:09:16,959
what we learned is that it is a land

273
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:20,399
management philosophy where farmers and

274
00:09:16,959 --> 00:09:22,320
ranchers grow in harmony with nature

275
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:24,480
now there are five main principles that

276
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:27,040
underpin this regenerative philosophy

277
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:27,040
next slide

278
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:32,480
the first is nurturing relationships

279
00:09:29,920 --> 00:09:34,720
within and around a farm

280
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:38,959
relationships between humans

281
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:42,399
land plants water pollinators predators

282
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:44,160
pests even soil microbes are the crux of

283
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:46,560
regenerative agriculture

284
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:48,959
so growers foster and protect those

285
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:50,399
relationships wherever and however they

286
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,640
can

287
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:55,279
the second principle is understanding

288
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:57,600
your social and environmental context

289
00:09:55,279 --> 00:10:00,240
now regenerative growers made it a point

290
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:02,640
to learn about their unique farms

291
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:05,600
landscape the naturally available

292
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,440
resources on the land and the ecosystem

293
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:10,160
around the farm

294
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:12,720
they use what they learn to inform what

295
00:10:10,160 --> 00:10:15,360
on-farm practices they should use and

296
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,480
are best used for their landscape for

297
00:10:15,360 --> 00:10:19,120
example

298
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:22,000
if a farmer's farm is next to a river

299
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:24,160
the grower will plant trees or hedgerows

300
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:26,160
at the edge of the farm to prevent soil

301
00:10:24,160 --> 00:10:28,320
erosion into the water body

302
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,240
while also providing shade and

303
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:32,959
sequestering carbon

304
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:35,440
another example if a grower knows that

305
00:10:32,959 --> 00:10:37,279
water is becoming increasingly scarce in

306
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,880
their area like what we're experiencing

307
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:40,959
out here in the west

308
00:10:38,880 --> 00:10:42,959
regenerative goers will transition to

309
00:10:40,959 --> 00:10:46,880
planting crops that are not water

310
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:49,600
intensive to adapt to these new changes

311
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:50,560
the third principle is prioritizing soil

312
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,880
health

313
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:55,279
now we all know that soil is at the

314
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:57,519
heart of a healthy food system and

315
00:10:55,279 --> 00:11:00,720
regenerative growers know that healthy

316
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:02,880
soup healthy soil grows healthy food

317
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:05,600
generally regenerative growers limit the

318
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:08,480
mechanical soil disturbance on the land

319
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,160
and they do so to protect the biological

320
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:14,800
structures that soil microbes bacteria

321
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:17,040
and fungi build in the soil

322
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:20,079
those same soil those same structures by

323
00:11:17,040 --> 00:11:22,240
the way that help store carbon

324
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:24,800
the fourth principle is to reduce the

325
00:11:22,240 --> 00:11:26,800
reliance on synthetic inputs

326
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,640
regenerative farmers and ranchers tried

327
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,959
to reduce their reliance on synthetic

328
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:32,959
inputs like herbicides pesticides and

329
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:34,959
chemical fertilizers

330
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:37,200
now most of our interviewees found that

331
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:40,399
while prioritizing soil health they

332
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,160
ended up needing fewer chemicals anyway

333
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:44,560
and of course fewer chemicals meant

334
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:46,640
beneficial insects and wildlife coming

335
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:49,839
back onto the land which helped

336
00:11:46,640 --> 00:11:52,079
naturally reduce pest pressures

337
00:11:49,839 --> 00:11:54,839
now this last principle the fifth one

338
00:11:52,079 --> 00:11:58,079
nurturing relationships outside off the

339
00:11:54,839 --> 00:12:00,160
farm we learned that relationships in

340
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,800
regenerative agriculture go beyond

341
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:04,800
on-farm practices to include

342
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:08,000
relationships with co-workers with

343
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:10,720
history with consumers and with

344
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,880
themselves and their communities

345
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,800
they encouraged customers to visit the

346
00:12:12,880 --> 00:12:15,680
farm to see what they were doing first

347
00:12:14,800 --> 00:12:18,160
hand

348
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:20,560
they had field days where families and

349
00:12:18,160 --> 00:12:23,519
other farmers came to visit to learn

350
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:25,360
they paid their laborers of living wage

351
00:12:23,519 --> 00:12:27,600
you know this fifth principle actually

352
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:29,680
captured some of the social and cultural

353
00:12:27,600 --> 00:12:31,440
components of regenerative agriculture

354
00:12:29,680 --> 00:12:34,399
that my team and i didn't expect to

355
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:36,480
learn through our interviews

356
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:38,480
now you see all of these laid out in

357
00:12:36,480 --> 00:12:40,480
this wonderful honeycomb shape and

358
00:12:38,480 --> 00:12:42,480
you'll know that you'll notice that each

359
00:12:40,480 --> 00:12:44,959
of these principles builds on and

360
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:47,600
relates to one another for example by

361
00:12:44,959 --> 00:12:49,760
prioritizing soil health you reduce the

362
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:52,079
use of synthetic inputs which helps

363
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,680
protect ecosystem relationships while

364
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,279
also contributing to the welfare of

365
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:57,440
surrounding communities so there's this

366
00:12:55,279 --> 00:13:00,240
great synergy great symbiosis between

367
00:12:57,440 --> 00:13:02,800
these these five principles

368
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:05,519
and because regenerative agriculture is

369
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:08,000
a management philosophy it looks

370
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:10,320
different across the country next slide

371
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:10,320
please

372
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:13,760
as a result

373
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,839
when we asked interviewees what

374
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,880
practices they used on the land they

375
00:13:15,839 --> 00:13:21,760
shared a lot of different ones including

376
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:25,120
cover cropping no-till or low-till crop

377
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:28,000
diversity agroforestry composting dry

378
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:29,760
farming solar panels like there was a a

379
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:31,839
lovely hodgepodge of practices that

380
00:13:29,760 --> 00:13:35,200
growers could choose from

381
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:37,360
but one thing was clear to continuously

382
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:40,560
improve the land

383
00:13:37,360 --> 00:13:42,639
growers used multiple practices

384
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:44,160
and as growers continued on their

385
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:46,639
regenerative journey

386
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:49,360
they continued stacking practice on top

387
00:13:46,639 --> 00:13:53,199
of practice and as a result they were

388
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:55,279
seeing faster land regeneration results

389
00:13:53,199 --> 00:13:57,199
from improving water quality and water

390
00:13:55,279 --> 00:13:59,360
retention on the land which is very

391
00:13:57,199 --> 00:14:01,440
important considering drought conditions

392
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,560
and the swing from drought to extreme

393
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:04,240
weather

394
00:14:02,560 --> 00:14:06,639
to sequestering more carbon and

395
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:08,639
improving biodiversity to keeping more

396
00:14:06,639 --> 00:14:11,040
money in their pockets by not having to

397
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,360
spend much on inputs

398
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,920
to feeling more connected with their

399
00:14:13,360 --> 00:14:17,920
consumers and their farming communities

400
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:19,600
the folks we interviewed shared a

401
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:23,279
multitude of ways that regenerative

402
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:25,680
agriculture benefited them and the land

403
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:27,440
next slide

404
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:29,519
if i could step back a little bit and

405
00:14:27,440 --> 00:14:31,760
share personally what i found really

406
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:33,519
moving was the way that growers talked

407
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,440
about the mental health benefits of

408
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,000
regenerative agriculture

409
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:39,760
they enjoyed learning about the land

410
00:14:38,000 --> 00:14:42,959
that they worked on and the animals that

411
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:46,000
they raised they felt free and empowered

412
00:14:42,959 --> 00:14:48,000
to experiment and innovate on the land

413
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,839
and they shared how happy they were that

414
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:52,639
they were able to make management

415
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:54,639
decisions based on what they saw and

416
00:14:52,639 --> 00:14:57,360
what they felt on the land instead of

417
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:59,120
being told what to do

418
00:14:57,360 --> 00:15:00,880
okay so that's the first 17 pages

419
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:02,639
summarized for you

420
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,040
if there's one thing you take away from

421
00:15:02,639 --> 00:15:07,760
all of that it's that regenerative goers

422
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:09,920
think of their land as ecosystems and

423
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,639
use practices that strengthen those

424
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:14,639
ecosystems like using cover crops to

425
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:16,639
build healthy soil that can hold onto

426
00:15:14,639 --> 00:15:18,079
more water during during extreme weather

427
00:15:16,639 --> 00:15:20,160
events

428
00:15:18,079 --> 00:15:22,320
so that's the first part of the report

429
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:25,839
the second part of the report digs into

430
00:15:22,320 --> 00:15:27,839
the ways that we think policy can help

431
00:15:25,839 --> 00:15:30,639
can change to support regenerative

432
00:15:27,839 --> 00:15:32,399
agriculture and scale it up

433
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:34,560
we analyzed all of our interview

434
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,959
transcripts using a qualitative analysis

435
00:15:34,560 --> 00:15:39,279
software to see what common themes

436
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,800
emerged across the interviews

437
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:43,120
when it came to the barriers and

438
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,959
opportunities there were four major

439
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:47,199
pathways for changing agricultural

440
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:48,320
policy to support more regenerative

441
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,120
agriculture

442
00:15:48,320 --> 00:15:53,680
next slide please

443
00:15:51,120 --> 00:15:55,759
the four pathways are

444
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,519
to level the federal investment playing

445
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,199
field and invest in regenerative

446
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:01,839
stewardship

447
00:15:59,199 --> 00:16:03,600
invest in decentralized food systems

448
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:06,160
infrastructure

449
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,160
support farmers and ranchers

450
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,959
and fund regenerative agriculture

451
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:13,759
research and extension

452
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:16,000
our interviewees were very clear that

453
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:18,800
changes needed to happen throughout the

454
00:16:16,000 --> 00:16:20,639
food system which is why our policy

455
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,519
recommendations touch on so many

456
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,560
different issues their experiences show

457
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:28,720
the need to transform this industry

458
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:30,639
holistically

459
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:33,040
now there's a handy one pager on the

460
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:35,360
website next slide

461
00:16:33,040 --> 00:16:37,600
i'll give you a quick brief look at what

462
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:40,480
that one pager looks like

463
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:42,160
um that summarizes all of our policy

464
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:43,360
recommendations in each of these four

465
00:16:42,160 --> 00:16:45,519
buckets

466
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,720
and i think there's a link provided to

467
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:50,399
this one pager on the eesi website

468
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:52,480
now i'm going to dig into the research

469
00:16:50,399 --> 00:16:54,959
and extension bucket and the other

470
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:57,920
panelists will each discuss the others

471
00:16:54,959 --> 00:16:57,920
next slide please

472
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:02,639
so research and extension provide

473
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,039
technical resources to growers across

474
00:17:02,639 --> 00:17:07,039
the country and can be administered in a

475
00:17:05,039 --> 00:17:08,559
variety of different through a variety

476
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:11,600
of different entities including

477
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:15,439
land-grant colleges extension services

478
00:17:11,600 --> 00:17:17,280
conservation districts and usda programs

479
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:20,000
now these technical resources are

480
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:22,160
necessary for disseminating information

481
00:17:20,000 --> 00:17:24,480
like for alerting growers about new

482
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:26,799
grant programs or changes to existing

483
00:17:24,480 --> 00:17:28,640
grant program guidelines

484
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,280
these technical resources are also

485
00:17:28,640 --> 00:17:32,640
necessary for connecting scientists with

486
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,559
growers

487
00:17:32,640 --> 00:17:36,960
for trialing and experimenting new

488
00:17:34,559 --> 00:17:39,280
management techniques and organizing

489
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,280
field days for growers to connect and

490
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:43,679
share with each other

491
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:44,919
we learned that the dearth of region

492
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:47,360
specific and operation

493
00:17:44,919 --> 00:17:49,440
operation-specific technical resources

494
00:17:47,360 --> 00:17:51,520
is a challenge for the regenerative

495
00:17:49,440 --> 00:17:53,440
movement for example

496
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,080
finding information about practicing

497
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,679
organic no-till in the pacific northwest

498
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:59,120
was brought up a few times in our

499
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:01,360
interviews

500
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,840
and this dearth of information

501
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:06,080
is especially problematic given that one

502
00:18:03,840 --> 00:18:08,320
of the basic principles of regenerative

503
00:18:06,080 --> 00:18:11,280
agriculture is to employ farming

504
00:18:08,320 --> 00:18:12,880
practices that are specific to one's

505
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:14,480
microclimate and environment remember

506
00:18:12,880 --> 00:18:17,360
that principle understanding your

507
00:18:14,480 --> 00:18:20,000
environmental and social contacts

508
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:23,200
so we strongly encourage providing

509
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:25,280
consistent stable and adequate funding

510
00:18:23,200 --> 00:18:26,799
for conservation technical assistance

511
00:18:25,280 --> 00:18:28,960
and conservation districts these

512
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:31,039
entities that are crucial in providing

513
00:18:28,960 --> 00:18:32,799
technical resources to growers and

514
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:35,440
meeting growers where they are to

515
00:18:32,799 --> 00:18:37,919
provide those technical resources

516
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,919
next slide

517
00:18:39,039 --> 00:18:43,600
now regenerative growers are innovative

518
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:45,760
and they are curious

519
00:18:43,600 --> 00:18:48,960
they experiment on their fields to find

520
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:51,440
the best mix of practices seed types

521
00:18:48,960 --> 00:18:53,520
livestock rotations and soil amendments

522
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:55,280
for their unique landscape i think i've

523
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:56,960
mentioned that a few times if you can't

524
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,760
tell already

525
00:18:56,960 --> 00:19:02,160
on-farm research is a key ingredient of

526
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:05,280
regenerative agriculture so we want to

527
00:19:02,160 --> 00:19:07,840
see robust funding for programs that

528
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:10,559
encourage experimentation like the

529
00:19:07,840 --> 00:19:13,039
usda's ser sustainable agriculture

530
00:19:10,559 --> 00:19:14,960
research and education program and the

531
00:19:13,039 --> 00:19:17,039
soil health demonstration trial which

532
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,640
was a program established in the 2018

533
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:20,400
farm bill

534
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:24,160
now i think that's all i got time to

535
00:19:20,400 --> 00:19:25,520
cover get it cover cover cropping

536
00:19:24,160 --> 00:19:28,960
looking forward to answering your

537
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:28,960
questions and back to you

538
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:34,160
awesome thank you so much uh i've looked

539
00:19:32,400 --> 00:19:35,840
through the report and now i can't wait

540
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:39,440
to go back and look at it again after

541
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:41,039
that presentation um unfortunately i i'm

542
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:43,120
hopeful that we don't like like a huge

543
00:19:41,039 --> 00:19:44,799
number of our audience drop off to go

544
00:19:43,120 --> 00:19:46,640
read the report but everybody should go

545
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:48,880
read the report it's excellent

546
00:19:46,640 --> 00:19:50,400
there aren't as many cover crop puns and

547
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,960
regenerative agriculture puns as i would

548
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:54,799
like but arohi just helped make up for

549
00:19:52,960 --> 00:19:57,919
that so congratulations again on an

550
00:19:54,799 --> 00:19:59,760
excellent report um i'd like to make uh

551
00:19:57,919 --> 00:20:03,760

assistant specialist for the school of

574
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:52,640
natural resources and the environment at

575

indigenous center resilience center

578
00:20:56,159 --> 00:20:59,440
which will work with tribal communities

579
00:20:57,600 --> 00:21:00,480
on issues related to water energy and

580
00:20:59,440 --> 00:21:02,080
food

581
00:21:00,480 --> 00:21:04,240

land farmer

584
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,559
michael welcome to the briefing today

585
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:10,720
i'm really looking forward to your

586
00:21:08,559 --> 00:21:12,480
presentation

587
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:14,240
hello thank you very much uh my name is

588
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,240
michael cotisdo with johnson uh sorry i

589
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:18,400
had to step away for a second but you

590
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,720
know we've been all talking about uh you

591
00:21:18,400 --> 00:21:22,640
know regenerative agriculture and as a

592
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:24,080
hernia have been she mentioned that you

593
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:25,840
know this is nothing new to us and this

594
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:28,559
is the concept we've been practicing at

595
00:21:25,840 --> 00:21:29,840
least in my region for um about 3000

596
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:31,520
years so when you know when senator

597
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,960
tester says that he's a third generation

598
00:21:31,520 --> 00:21:36,400
farmer he's talking to one that goes

599
00:21:32,960 --> 00:21:38,640
about 250 250 generations back

600
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,600
and so i kind of want to talk about this

601
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:42,080
um

602
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:43,600
okay yeah so like i said indeed

603
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
did indigenous religions regions of

604
00:21:43,600 --> 00:21:48,320
agriculture is nothing new to us and so

605
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,360
as as a scientist and a phd and

606
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,039
everybody has their own little

607
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,799
terminology i came up with something to

608
00:21:51,039 --> 00:21:55,120
define what indigenous regenerative

609
00:21:52,799 --> 00:21:57,200
agriculture means in the context so go

610
00:21:55,120 --> 00:21:59,280
ahead and start that so um so i have

611
00:21:57,200 --> 00:22:02,000
regenerative agriculture defined

612
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:04,320
as ira is a process of incorporating

613
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:06,000
place-based ways of knowing supported by

614
00:22:04,320 --> 00:22:07,360
culture belief systems and

615
00:22:06,000 --> 00:22:09,840
environmentally friendly derived

616
00:22:07,360 --> 00:22:11,280
survival schemes over millennia now it's

617
00:22:09,840 --> 00:22:12,320
important to all understand all that

618
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:14,080
because if you really look at the

619
00:22:12,320 --> 00:22:15,679
context of the sense it incorporates

620
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:18,320
everything that was already talked about

621
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:19,840
uh but by one of our panelists so go

622
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:22,799
ahead next slide

623
00:22:19,840 --> 00:22:24,640
okay so it's also it's also we also have

624
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:26,240
to understand why it's why it's so

625
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:28,400
important so you know indigenous

626
00:22:26,240 --> 00:22:30,400
indigenous people protect 80 of global

627
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:32,640
biodiversity on a mere 25 of the

628
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,320
planet's land with only less than 5

629
00:22:32,640 --> 00:22:35,520
percent of the world's population now

630
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:36,880
that's important because when we're

631
00:22:35,520 --> 00:22:38,840
talking regenerative agriculture we're

632
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:41,200
also talking the biodiversity it's the

633
00:22:38,840 --> 00:22:42,960
biodiversity of our crops

634
00:22:41,200 --> 00:22:44,880
uh that are that are basically place

635
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,440
place regionally based and things like

636
00:22:44,880 --> 00:22:48,960
that that allow them to survive and so

637
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:51,280
we're looking at an example of what the

638
00:22:48,960 --> 00:22:52,799
biodiversity means it doesn't mean that

639
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:54,640
that we don't that all the crops don't

640
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:57,200
come up at the same it's not a monocrop

641
00:22:54,640 --> 00:22:59,120
culture it's a perfectly designed

642
00:22:57,200 --> 00:23:00,559
culture that fits the environment i'm

643
00:22:59,120 --> 00:23:02,320
always wanting to say look at the hopi

644
00:23:00,559 --> 00:23:04,159
reservation you know we grow corn to fit

645
00:23:02,320 --> 00:23:06,000
the environment and we do not manipulate

646
00:23:04,159 --> 00:23:09,039
the environment to fit the corn so go

647
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,960
ahead and go ahead and change that

648
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:12,880
so when we talk about climate adopted

649
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:14,480
crops here that's an example of a corn

650
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,320
plant it's kind of bushy like that and

651
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:17,280
we can people give me a little bit of

652
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,640
brief because they say i'm the

653
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:20,159
bushmaster

654
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,919
when it comes to farming and stuff like

655
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:23,679
that but the climate adaptive crops that

656
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:25,039
we raise out here that our play space

657
00:23:23,679 --> 00:23:27,200
are very important this is a picture

658
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:28,880
that was taken in july you can see how

659
00:23:27,200 --> 00:23:30,799
cracked the ground is we only we don't

660
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:32,799
get any rainfall all the way from april

661
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:34,480
all the way up until july when we do

662
00:23:32,799 --> 00:23:36,799
have our first monsoon rains if you do

663
00:23:34,480 --> 00:23:38,080
have them at all and so you can see how

664
00:23:36,799 --> 00:23:39,760
cracked the ground is but you can see

665
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:40,880
how beautiful that crop is thriving you

666
00:23:39,760 --> 00:23:42,480
know up and hopefully we've learned to

667
00:23:40,880 --> 00:23:44,240
work the environment in ways that every

668
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:45,919
single one of our conservation

669
00:23:44,240 --> 00:23:47,279
techniques is designed to conserve soil

670
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:49,440
moisture when it comes to agricultural

671
00:23:47,279 --> 00:23:50,960
production

672
00:23:49,440 --> 00:23:52,640
so when it comes to human well-being and

673
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:53,600
i think we kind of touched on that uh

674
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:55,679
you know

675
00:23:53,600 --> 00:23:57,600
i i kind of could really understand why

676
00:23:55,679 --> 00:23:58,880
we feel like we do when we do what we do

677
00:23:57,600 --> 00:24:00,559
because we're working with our hands

678
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:02,080
we're working with the environment you

679
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:04,960
know it's unfortunate last time in the

680
00:24:02,080 --> 00:24:06,799
farm bill in 2018 we had to have

681
00:24:04,960 --> 00:24:08,400
some money set aside for suicide

682
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:09,760
prevention of that the farm that was

683
00:24:08,400 --> 00:24:11,120
occurring

684
00:24:09,760 --> 00:24:13,279
on farming units

685
00:24:11,120 --> 00:24:14,720
across the united states and so i think

686
00:24:13,279 --> 00:24:16,480
one of the things that prevents us from

687
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,919
doing that at least at hopi is that we

688
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:19,520
we're experiencing we have experienced

689
00:24:17,919 --> 00:24:21,440
crop failure a number of times you know

690
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:23,840
and for us this is merely about

691
00:24:21,440 --> 00:24:26,000
subsistence it's merely about

692
00:24:23,840 --> 00:24:27,440
um who we are it's tied directly into

693
00:24:26,000 --> 00:24:30,159
our faith and that's what makes it so

694
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:32,159
resilient so we plant no matter what you

695
00:24:30,159 --> 00:24:33,600
know so it's very important that we

696
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:35,200
incorporate human well-being and which

697
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:36,720
it does you know this those kids right

698
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,799
there they're the next generation that's

699
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:40,960
coming up to be farmers themselves and

700
00:24:38,799 --> 00:24:42,720
so i like that picture with that said i

701
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
kind of wanted to bring in some some

702
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
actually on the next slide i wanted to

703
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:47,840
bring in some of our own recommendations

704
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,440
that follow along with what

705
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:51,919
with it with what the natural resource

706
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,520
defensive council has put out and so the

707
00:24:51,919 --> 00:24:56,240
first one is

708
00:24:53,520 --> 00:24:57,360
you know to enforce existing legislation

709
00:24:56,240 --> 00:24:59,039
things like the american indian

710
00:24:57,360 --> 00:25:01,919
agricultural resource management act of

711
00:24:59,039 --> 00:25:03,760
1993 which by the way has never received

712
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:05,120
congressional funding it's just an act

713
00:25:03,760 --> 00:25:06,240
and it should receive congressional

714
00:25:05,120 --> 00:25:08,720
funding because in there there's a

715
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:11,120
conservation program called arma which

716
00:25:08,720 --> 00:25:13,520
which is the agriculture in agriculture

717
00:25:11,120 --> 00:25:14,960
american american indian agriculture

718
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:16,559
management acts that would allow us to

719
00:25:14,960 --> 00:25:18,159
basically take over the conservation

720
00:25:16,559 --> 00:25:20,080
program and manage it the way we'd like

721
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,000
to same thing with alternative funding

722
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,080
arrangements it was passed in 2018 but i

723
00:25:22,000 --> 00:25:25,919
have yet to see legislation on that to

724
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:27,360
actually implement that here in arizona

725
00:25:25,919 --> 00:25:28,400
i think we only have two tribes out of

726
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,159
the 23

727
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:32,000
that are actually using alternative

728
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:33,760
funding arrangements and that also opens

729
00:25:32,000 --> 00:25:35,679
the door too because we like to practice

730
00:25:33,760 --> 00:25:37,200
what we like to practice and it's just

731
00:25:35,679 --> 00:25:38,320
recently that the white house passed an

732
00:25:37,200 --> 00:25:40,480
agenda

733
00:25:38,320 --> 00:25:42,240
called itek that actually incorporates

734
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:43,760
some of our traditional knowledge and

735
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:45,919
set guidelines to be incorporated into

736
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:47,520
federal agencies the second one is very

737
00:25:45,919 --> 00:25:49,520
important creating funding mechanisms

738
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:51,200
through legislation to support locally

739
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:52,640
led small farmers and regenerative

740
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:54,159
agricultural initiatives right now

741
00:25:52,640 --> 00:25:55,679
there's really none of that and so what

742
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:57,679
happens is the regenerative person or

743
00:25:55,679 --> 00:25:59,039
the conventional person has a hard time

744
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:01,520
getting off because there's a three to

745
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:02,960
five year window that doesn't cover the

746
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,320
money that he's gonna lose because when

747
00:26:02,960 --> 00:26:05,600
you switch over you're not gonna make

748
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,799
money you're gonna lose money for a

749
00:26:05,600 --> 00:26:08,720
little bit until you're able to up

750
00:26:06,799 --> 00:26:10,480
through the soils and everything else

751
00:26:08,720 --> 00:26:11,919
the second one is fun initiatives geared

752
00:26:10,480 --> 00:26:13,840
towards agricultural related

753
00:26:11,919 --> 00:26:16,000
infrastructure the native american

754
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:17,919
agricultural fund has a beautiful plan

755
00:26:16,000 --> 00:26:19,919
called reimagining food economies and

756
00:26:17,919 --> 00:26:22,080
basically what that does is that that

757
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,520
lets us have you know establishes

758
00:26:22,080 --> 00:26:25,679
infrastructure for things like meat

759
00:26:23,520 --> 00:26:27,279
processing centers there's only i think

760
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,559
four in the united states so we need

761
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:30,720
some more of those so i'm just not

762
00:26:28,559 --> 00:26:32,640
trying to only help you know american

763
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:34,559
indian people but also non-indians as

764
00:26:32,640 --> 00:26:36,320
far as how we're going to

765
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:37,120
upscale our supply chain and things like

766
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,799
that

767
00:26:37,120 --> 00:26:40,159
and so it also calls for food hose

768
00:26:38,799 --> 00:26:41,679
because one of the the main things that

769
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:43,120
we had out here at trouble on the

770
00:26:41,679 --> 00:26:44,799
reservation system is that there's no

771
00:26:43,120 --> 00:26:47,039
place to really store food so like at

772
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,480
the open reservation sometimes the saint

773
00:26:47,039 --> 00:26:50,320
mary's food truck would come up and then

774
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,640
we'd wind up half of it would go back

775
00:26:50,320 --> 00:26:54,799
because we did not have a place to store

776
00:26:52,640 --> 00:26:56,320
the food the other thing is to also

777
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:58,559
support adequate funding for the

778
00:26:56,320 --> 00:27:00,640
federally recognized tribal extension

779
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,640
program that's a big one because you

780
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:04,559
know not all universities not all land

781
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,720
grant universities have extension agents

782
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:09,120
on indian reservations this specific

783
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,720
piece of legislation does call for that

784
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,000
it's just not funded adequately enough

785
00:27:10,720 --> 00:27:14,159
and so you can there's a link there you

786
00:27:12,000 --> 00:27:16,000
can turn on to read more about that the

787
00:27:14,159 --> 00:27:17,679
next one is to aid in the development of

788
00:27:16,000 --> 00:27:19,679
permanently funded regionally based or

789
00:27:17,679 --> 00:27:21,120
nationally based native american policy

790
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,120
and technical centers in the united

791
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:24,399
states for an example the udon center

792
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:25,760
that's congressionally funded wouldn't

793
00:27:24,399 --> 00:27:27,840
it be nice to have one or two of those

794
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
here in the united states the university

795
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:31,440
of arizona which i happen to work for

796
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,120
has just established the indigenous

797
00:27:31,440 --> 00:27:34,640
resilience center that'd be another

798
00:27:33,120 --> 00:27:36,240
place so we're going to develop policies

799
00:27:34,640 --> 00:27:37,200
right out of that on a regionally based

800
00:27:36,240 --> 00:27:39,120
approach

801
00:27:37,200 --> 00:27:40,480
and use the word tribes you know as far

802
00:27:39,120 --> 00:27:42,000
as the people that are here i think a

803
00:27:40,480 --> 00:27:44,320
lot of times people forget to put that

804
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:46,320
in there when it comes to legislation so

805
00:27:44,320 --> 00:27:47,840
we need to use the word tribes in

806
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:49,200
federal legislation so that we're able

807
00:27:47,840 --> 00:27:50,880
to be covered by that because if we

808
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,399
don't do that sometimes the states are

809
00:27:50,880 --> 00:27:53,279
sharp all the funds and we don't get

810
00:27:52,399 --> 00:27:54,960
anything

811
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:56,559
and so you know i would also encourage

812
00:27:54,960 --> 00:27:58,399
people to look at the native farm bill

813
00:27:56,559 --> 00:28:00,799
coalition some of their agenda because a

814
00:27:58,399 --> 00:28:02,399
lot of their a lot of their

815
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,440
their designs just specifically help

816
00:28:02,399 --> 00:28:04,799
indian country but it's also

817
00:28:03,440 --> 00:28:06,799
specifically to help others especially

818
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:08,399
in the area of regenerative agriculture

819
00:28:06,799 --> 00:28:10,000
and so with that you know that's pretty

820
00:28:08,399 --> 00:28:10,960
much my whole my whole speech there but

821
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:13,279
i really want to thank you for letting

822
00:28:10,960 --> 00:28:13,279
me talk

823
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:17,679
thank you michael for that excellent

journey in 2013 by incorporating cover

844
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:01,679
crops no-till and nutrient management

845
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:03,440

865
00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:45,039
land on a corn and soybean farm

866
00:29:42,159 --> 00:29:47,440
in central illinois and agriculture and

867
00:29:45,039 --> 00:29:48,320
conservation have been a huge part of my

868
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:50,960
life

869
00:29:48,320 --> 00:29:52,880
my entire life and and one of the

870
00:29:50,960 --> 00:29:55,200
reasons why i was drawn to come to work

871
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:58,240
for american farmland trust over five

872
00:29:55,200 --> 00:30:00,240
years ago aft is a national nonprofit

873
00:29:58,240 --> 00:30:02,480
organization and our mission is

874
00:30:00,240 --> 00:30:04,399
protecting farm and ranch land promoting

875
00:30:02,480 --> 00:30:06,399
sound farming practices and keeping

876
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:08,320
farmers on that land

877
00:30:06,399 --> 00:30:11,279
the photo on the left there is a picture

878
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:14,080
of my grandfather in the early 1970s

879
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:14,880
cultivating soybeans with an open

880
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:17,520
cab

881
00:30:14,880 --> 00:30:19,840
case 930 tractor uh that tractor is

882
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:22,559
still in the use on the farm today um

883
00:30:19,840 --> 00:30:24,399
but in a much different capacity uh the

884
00:30:22,559 --> 00:30:26,640
photo in the middle is of my youngest

885
00:30:24,399 --> 00:30:28,720
son in a soybean field this photo was

886
00:30:26,640 --> 00:30:30,640
taken several years ago and

887
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:32,399
this field was one of the first fields

888
00:30:30,640 --> 00:30:34,880
that i no-tilled

889
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:37,520
into a green uh cereal rye crop

890
00:30:34,880 --> 00:30:40,240
and so it's just exciting to see um you

891
00:30:37,520 --> 00:30:42,000
know as as as i've progressed in my soul

892
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:44,000
health journey

893
00:30:42,000 --> 00:30:45,919
and also looking at

894
00:30:44,000 --> 00:30:47,600
my children and and some of the

895
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:49,760
experiences that they've had along the

896
00:30:47,600 --> 00:30:52,960
way as well as i mentioned i began my

897
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:55,200
soil health journey in in 2013 by

898
00:30:52,960 --> 00:30:57,519
incorporating cover crops into some

899
00:30:55,200 --> 00:31:00,080
existing no-till fields to reduce

900
00:30:57,519 --> 00:31:02,080
erosion suppress weeds and reduce

901
00:31:00,080 --> 00:31:03,360
chemical costs associated with weed

902
00:31:02,080 --> 00:31:04,799
control

903
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:06,640
since that time i've seen a lot of

904
00:31:04,799 --> 00:31:07,760
different improvements in the soil that

905
00:31:06,640 --> 00:31:10,000
are really making it a lot more

906
00:31:07,760 --> 00:31:12,320
resilient during periods of drought

907
00:31:10,000 --> 00:31:14,559
i also know that i can and and will

908
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:16,559
continue to try to do better by the soil

909
00:31:14,559 --> 00:31:18,320
and we'll continue to find more ways to

910
00:31:16,559 --> 00:31:20,159
make climate smart conservation

911
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,399
practices work for me

912
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:24,559
and my farming operation

913
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,240
and as a farmer i'm experiencing you

914
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:28,399
know increased management challenges

915
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:30,320
that are resulting from fewer favorable

916
00:31:28,399 --> 00:31:32,240
planting days in the spring

917
00:31:30,320 --> 00:31:33,760
due to more intense and more frequent

918
00:31:32,240 --> 00:31:35,519
rainfall events

919
00:31:33,760 --> 00:31:37,440
um this has really made it more

920
00:31:35,519 --> 00:31:39,919
important than ever to adopt soil health

921
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:41,440
practices but at the same time it's made

922
00:31:39,919 --> 00:31:43,360
it more challenging

923
00:31:41,440 --> 00:31:45,279
cover crops you know require an

924
00:31:43,360 --> 00:31:47,200
additional level of management they have

925
00:31:45,279 --> 00:31:49,200
to be planted in the fall when harvest

926
00:31:47,200 --> 00:31:50,960
activities are the main priority

927
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:53,600
and for example because of a wetter than

928
00:31:50,960 --> 00:31:55,919
normal spring this year i had a total of

929
00:31:53,600 --> 00:31:57,039
six planting days that were adequate for

930
00:31:55,919 --> 00:31:58,559
planting

931
00:31:57,039 --> 00:32:00,240
in april and may

932
00:31:58,559 --> 00:32:02,880
in order to get my corn and soybeans

933
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:04,640
planted so cover crops and no-till often

934
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:06,559
go hand-in-hand when they're used

935
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:08,960
together and can really provide multiple

936
00:32:06,559 --> 00:32:11,039
benefits and i just really really love

937
00:32:08,960 --> 00:32:13,600
this slide and how it shows all of these

938
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:16,159
different benefits in one place you know

939
00:32:13,600 --> 00:32:18,799
we can reduce erosion and winter soil

940
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:21,120
loss we can keep those deep rooted cover

941
00:32:18,799 --> 00:32:22,320
crops um to help improve nutrient

942
00:32:21,120 --> 00:32:23,440
cycling

943
00:32:22,320 --> 00:32:25,760
um

944
00:32:23,440 --> 00:32:27,679
improves on-farm water quality

945
00:32:25,760 --> 00:32:29,200
we can produce more biomass into that

946
00:32:27,679 --> 00:32:31,279
soil

947
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:32,799
just a lot of great things that are that

948
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,320
are happening whenever we have these

949
00:32:32,799 --> 00:32:36,399
prac when we're utilizing these

950
00:32:34,320 --> 00:32:38,960
practices on the farm so as a

951
00:32:36,399 --> 00:32:40,960
conservationist an agronomist and a

952
00:32:38,960 --> 00:32:43,039
director for midwest programming i'm

953
00:32:40,960 --> 00:32:44,880
always looking for programs that can

954
00:32:43,039 --> 00:32:47,519
help drive additional conservation

955
00:32:44,880 --> 00:32:49,519
practice adoption across the landscape

956
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:51,360
this is what led us to explore program

957
00:32:49,519 --> 00:32:53,760
opportunities like the fall covers for

958
00:32:51,360 --> 00:32:55,760
spring savings program in illinois this

959
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:57,679
program allows for farmers to receive a

960
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:59,279
crop insurance premium discount for

961
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:01,600
planning cover crops

962
00:32:59,279 --> 00:33:04,559
with really minimal new capacity demands

963
00:33:01,600 --> 00:33:06,640
on service providers and agencies this

964
00:33:04,559 --> 00:33:08,720
program can act as a bridge to provide

965
00:33:06,640 --> 00:33:10,480
some support while access is lined up

966
00:33:08,720 --> 00:33:12,240
for more substantial technical and

967
00:33:10,480 --> 00:33:14,080
financial assistance

968
00:33:12,240 --> 00:33:16,240
and really so that farmers can try on

969
00:33:14,080 --> 00:33:17,120
cover crops at a size that is right for

970
00:33:16,240 --> 00:33:19,679
them

971
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,399
so many people ask why crop insurance

972
00:33:19,679 --> 00:33:22,840
why

973
00:33:20,399 --> 00:33:25,840
why couple crop insurance and

974
00:33:22,840 --> 00:33:28,240
conservation and it's fairly simple crop

975
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:29,360
insurance is a trusted safety net

976
00:33:28,240 --> 00:33:31,360
program

977
00:33:29,360 --> 00:33:33,039
it has an established acceptance in the

978
00:33:31,360 --> 00:33:35,440
ag community and because of its

979
00:33:33,039 --> 00:33:37,840
widespread use crop insurance plays a

980
00:33:35,440 --> 00:33:40,159
significant role in shaping decision

981
00:33:37,840 --> 00:33:42,640
making in american agriculture

982
00:33:40,159 --> 00:33:44,640
the federal crop insurance program or as

983
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,279
i'll refer to in this presentation

984
00:33:44,640 --> 00:33:49,760
federal crop or federal crop program

985
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,919
is a critical risk management program

986
00:33:49,760 --> 00:33:53,519
the program is managed by usda's risk

987
00:33:51,919 --> 00:33:55,519
management agency

988
00:33:53,519 --> 00:33:57,919
it operates with the mission to provide

989
00:33:55,519 --> 00:34:00,080
market-based risk management tools to

990
00:33:57,919 --> 00:34:02,480
strengthen the economic stability of ag

991
00:34:00,080 --> 00:34:06,000
producers in rural communities

992
00:34:02,480 --> 00:34:08,800
in 2019 federal crop covered 300 million

993
00:34:06,000 --> 00:34:10,960
acres of crop land which include that it

994
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:12,879
included the vast majority of corn wheat

995
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:15,520
and soybean acres

996
00:34:12,879 --> 00:34:18,320
and equaled approximately 90 percent of

997
00:34:15,520 --> 00:34:20,000
all of that crop land being covered

998
00:34:18,320 --> 00:34:22,000
the federal crop program is is a

999
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:25,119
valuable tool for stabilizing farm

1000
00:34:22,000 --> 00:34:26,800
incomes farmers largely utilize any

1001
00:34:25,119 --> 00:34:28,159
indemnities to pay off short-term

1002
00:34:26,800 --> 00:34:29,679
operating loans

1003
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:31,679
and this also speaks to the importance

1004
00:34:29,679 --> 00:34:34,000
of crop insurance and maintaining the ag

1005
00:34:31,679 --> 00:34:36,639
financial services industry by making it

1006
00:34:34,000 --> 00:34:38,879
more certain that loans will be repaid

1007
00:34:36,639 --> 00:34:40,480
studies have also shown that enrollment

1008
00:34:38,879 --> 00:34:42,639
in federal crop has a positive

1009
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,879
relationship with farm survival

1010
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:46,879
in one study on average farms enrolled

1011
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:48,960
in crop insurance survived seven years

1012
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:51,040
longer than farms that did not

1013
00:34:48,960 --> 00:34:53,200
and participation in the program reduced

1014
00:34:51,040 --> 00:34:54,240
the probability of farm exit by 70

1015
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:56,240
percent

1016
00:34:54,240 --> 00:34:58,640
however federal crop does come with some

1017
00:34:56,240 --> 00:35:00,640
of its own risks the expected value of

1018
00:34:58,640 --> 00:35:02,320
an insured crop is a major factor in

1019
00:35:00,640 --> 00:35:04,480
determining the value of the premium

1020
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:07,119
subsidy and indemnity payment

1021
00:35:04,480 --> 00:35:09,920
as a result farmers are incentivized to

1022
00:35:07,119 --> 00:35:12,480
increase yield increase revenue in order

1023
00:35:09,920 --> 00:35:15,040
to maximize the value of these benefits

1024
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:17,599
this may lead farmers to unintentionally

1025
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:20,320
de-prioritize risk mitigating actions

1026
00:35:17,599 --> 00:35:22,560
like the use of cover crops and no-till

1027
00:35:20,320 --> 00:35:25,280
which can stabilize yields even under

1028
00:35:22,560 --> 00:35:27,440
unfavorable circumstances when farms do

1029
00:35:25,280 --> 00:35:29,520
not utilize risk mitigating practices

1030
00:35:27,440 --> 00:35:31,520
such as these they can become more

1031
00:35:29,520 --> 00:35:33,680
vulnerable to extreme weather events

1032
00:35:31,520 --> 00:35:35,440
market fluctuations and more

1033
00:35:33,680 --> 00:35:37,680
therefore creating added costs and

1034
00:35:35,440 --> 00:35:38,960
demands for the federal crop program to

1035
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,480
balance

1036
00:35:38,960 --> 00:35:42,480
in this manner while federal crop

1037
00:35:40,480 --> 00:35:44,720
mitigates short-term financial risk for

1038
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:46,320
farmers institutions it can promote

1039
00:35:44,720 --> 00:35:48,400
activities that lead to long-term

1040
00:35:46,320 --> 00:35:50,640
production risks that undermine the

1041
00:35:48,400 --> 00:35:52,720
sustainability and long-term resilience

1042
00:35:50,640 --> 00:35:54,320
of farming operations

1043
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:56,240
although the program has policies in

1044
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:58,960
place to mitigate moral hazards such as

1045
00:35:56,240 --> 00:36:00,960
not offering 100 coverage options

1046
00:35:58,960 --> 00:36:03,040
insulating farmers from risk may also

1047
00:36:00,960 --> 00:36:04,560
distort those same risk signals which

1048
00:36:03,040 --> 00:36:07,040
can for instance

1049
00:36:04,560 --> 00:36:09,839
remove incentives for farmers events to

1050
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:11,599
invest in climate adaptation

1051
00:36:09,839 --> 00:36:13,520
active risk management requires

1052
00:36:11,599 --> 00:36:15,599
understanding how human management

1053
00:36:13,520 --> 00:36:17,680
decisions interact with natural systems

1054
00:36:15,599 --> 00:36:18,560
to make disasters more or less likely to

1055
00:36:17,680 --> 00:36:20,480
happen

1056
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:23,040
this is a consideration that is not

1057
00:36:20,480 --> 00:36:25,440
currently embedded within federal crop

1058
00:36:23,040 --> 00:36:26,800
within agricultural systems the risk

1059
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:28,720
that results from the interaction

1060
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:30,720
between human decision making and

1061
00:36:28,720 --> 00:36:32,480
natural systems is best reflected in

1062
00:36:30,720 --> 00:36:34,480
crop production methods

1063
00:36:32,480 --> 00:36:37,040
for example prolonged heavy tillage

1064
00:36:34,480 --> 00:36:40,160
promotes erosion resulting in a loss of

1065
00:36:37,040 --> 00:36:41,280
sole organic matter nutrients

1066
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,079
and other

1067
00:36:41,280 --> 00:36:44,480
and

1068
00:36:42,079 --> 00:36:46,720
and it can also limit the soils water

1069
00:36:44,480 --> 00:36:48,720
holding capacity and result in more

1070
00:36:46,720 --> 00:36:50,960
flooding and less available water for

1071
00:36:48,720 --> 00:36:52,560
plants during drought years ultimately

1072
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,160
hurting yields

1073
00:36:52,560 --> 00:36:55,920
these issues only become more

1074
00:36:54,160 --> 00:36:57,920
challenging under the future climate

1075
00:36:55,920 --> 00:36:59,680
scenario federal crop cannot be

1076
00:36:57,920 --> 00:37:00,640
insulated from the impacts of climate

1077
00:36:59,680 --> 00:37:02,400
change

1078
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:04,560
climate change will make federal crop

1079
00:37:02,400 --> 00:37:06,640
more expensive and challenging to manage

1080
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,400
without mitigating actions

1081
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,640
under a high emission scenario

1082
00:37:08,400 --> 00:37:13,440
nasa predicts that corn yields will drop

1083
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:16,160
24 percent in just the next 10 years

1084
00:37:13,440 --> 00:37:17,920
a 2017 epa study predicted that even

1085
00:37:16,160 --> 00:37:19,280
without factoring in the impacts of

1086
00:37:17,920 --> 00:37:21,599
extreme weather events such as

1087
00:37:19,280 --> 00:37:23,280
hurricanes and flooding unmitigated

1088
00:37:21,599 --> 00:37:25,040
climate change will result in lower

1089
00:37:23,280 --> 00:37:27,200
yields by the end of the century for all

1090
00:37:25,040 --> 00:37:28,320
major commodities with the exception of

1091
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:30,160
wheat

1092
00:37:28,320 --> 00:37:32,240
the same study also predicts overall

1093
00:37:30,160 --> 00:37:34,160
commodities to increase up to eight

1094
00:37:32,240 --> 00:37:36,480
percent by the end of the century due

1095
00:37:34,160 --> 00:37:38,400
primarily to yield reductions

1096
00:37:36,480 --> 00:37:40,640
because crop insurance benefits are tied

1097
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:42,720
to yield and revenue outcomes these

1098
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:44,480
impacts on crop yield will pose new

1099
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:47,040
challenges for the administration on

1100
00:37:44,480 --> 00:37:49,680
federal crop as the impacts of extreme

1101
00:37:47,040 --> 00:37:51,920
weather deepen and become more frequent

1102
00:37:49,680 --> 00:37:53,680
one study suggested that increasing

1103
00:37:51,920 --> 00:37:55,680
temperatures have been responsible for

1104
00:37:53,680 --> 00:37:59,680
nineteen percent of total crop insurance

1105
00:37:55,680 --> 00:38:02,800
losses from 1991 to 2017

1106
00:37:59,680 --> 00:38:04,960
including 40 percent 47 percent of

1107
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:07,200
losses in 2012

1108
00:38:04,960 --> 00:38:09,520
a year of historic drought

1109
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,359
usda's economic research service

1110
00:38:09,520 --> 00:38:13,520
estimated that these climate impacts

1111
00:38:11,359 --> 00:38:15,040
could result in the cost of

1112
00:38:13,520 --> 00:38:16,640
federal crop

1113
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:19,280
increasing anywhere from three and a

1114
00:38:16,640 --> 00:38:21,680
half to twenty two percent if adaptation

1115
00:38:19,280 --> 00:38:24,240
practices are put in place

1116
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:26,880
such as making changes to crop varieties

1117
00:38:24,240 --> 00:38:29,200
or crop diversification and management

1118
00:38:26,880 --> 00:38:31,680
practices however if adaptation

1119
00:38:29,200 --> 00:38:33,680
practices are not put in place the cost

1120
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:36,720
of the federal crop program could

1121
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:39,040
increase anywhere from 10 to 37 percent

1122
00:38:36,720 --> 00:38:41,200
federal crop can address these risks by

1123
00:38:39,040 --> 00:38:42,960
establishing stronger pathways within

1124
00:38:41,200 --> 00:38:44,800
the program promote climate smart

1125
00:38:42,960 --> 00:38:47,520
conservation practices that reduce

1126
00:38:44,800 --> 00:38:49,680
production risk climate smart practices

1127
00:38:47,520 --> 00:38:52,079
protect farm incomes while increasing

1128
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:54,079
on-farm resilience to extreme weather

1129
00:38:52,079 --> 00:38:55,680
these pathways can be established by

1130
00:38:54,079 --> 00:38:58,160
promoting greater interagency

1131
00:38:55,680 --> 00:39:00,720
cooperation within usda to connect

1132
00:38:58,160 --> 00:39:03,040
farmers to conservation resources

1133
00:39:00,720 --> 00:39:05,040
expanding research and pilot projects

1134
00:39:03,040 --> 00:39:06,960
and utilizing tools like additional

1135
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:08,880
premium discounts to lower financial

1136
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,800
barriers for farmers to invest in these

1137
00:39:08,880 --> 00:39:12,720
practices

1138
00:39:10,800 --> 00:39:14,640
the use of climate smart conservation

1139
00:39:12,720 --> 00:39:16,400
practices needs to be expanded onto more

1140
00:39:14,640 --> 00:39:18,960
acres to have a real impact when it

1141
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:20,640
comes to reducing risk in the ag sector

1142
00:39:18,960 --> 00:39:22,880
the current adoption of climate smart

1143
00:39:20,640 --> 00:39:24,880
practices is still far too low to result

1144
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:26,320
in meaningful risk mitigation across the

1145
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:28,240
ag landscape

1146
00:39:26,320 --> 00:39:30,240
for example fewer than one-third of all

1147
00:39:28,240 --> 00:39:32,560
cropland acres utilize no-till or

1148
00:39:30,240 --> 00:39:33,680
strip-till practices and less than five

1149
00:39:32,560 --> 00:39:35,839
percent

1150
00:39:33,680 --> 00:39:37,920
utilize cover crops

1151
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:39,040
by increasing the use of just these two

1152
00:39:37,920 --> 00:39:40,960
practices

1153
00:39:39,040 --> 00:39:43,119
american farmers have an unparalleled

1154
00:39:40,960 --> 00:39:46,160
opportunity to combat climate change

1155
00:39:43,119 --> 00:39:48,560
improve water quality and and build on

1156
00:39:46,160 --> 00:39:50,480
farm resilience and profitability

1157
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:52,880
this lack of practice adoption can be

1158
00:39:50,480 --> 00:39:54,640
attributed to a variety of factors lack

1159
00:39:52,880 --> 00:39:56,000
of financial and technical assistance

1160
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:58,400
from state and federal government

1161
00:39:56,000 --> 00:40:00,400
agencies to assist producers in

1162
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,000
minimizing their own finance when

1163
00:40:00,400 --> 00:40:03,359
integrating new methods into their

1164
00:40:02,000 --> 00:40:05,280
operations

1165
00:40:03,359 --> 00:40:07,440
conservation practices can also yield

1166
00:40:05,280 --> 00:40:09,839
direct financial benefits for farmers by

1167
00:40:07,440 --> 00:40:12,079
stabilizing yields and lowering input

1168
00:40:09,839 --> 00:40:13,440
costs for fuel fertilizer and pest

1169
00:40:12,079 --> 00:40:15,680
management

1170
00:40:13,440 --> 00:40:17,760
a highly successful example of a premium

1171
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:20,560
discount program is the pandemic cover

1172
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:24,640
crop program which was offered by usda

1173
00:40:20,560 --> 00:40:26,240
during the 21 and 22 crop years 12.2

1174
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:29,440
million acres was enrolled in this

1175
00:40:26,240 --> 00:40:32,440
program in 2021 and the program reached

1176
00:40:29,440 --> 00:40:34,880
all lower 48 states at a cost of around

1177
00:40:32,440 --> 00:40:36,960
59.4 million dollars

1178
00:40:34,880 --> 00:40:38,480
the program provided a five dollar per

1179
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:40,880
acre discount

1180
00:40:38,480 --> 00:40:43,599
that was similar to the discount that

1181
00:40:40,880 --> 00:40:46,800
were available in select states

1182
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:48,640
in iowa illinois and indiana

1183
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:50,880
the conservation opportunity and

1184
00:40:48,640 --> 00:40:53,119
voluntary environment resilience program

1185
00:40:50,880 --> 00:40:54,880
or the cover act would establish the

1186
00:40:53,119 --> 00:40:56,960
good steward cover crop program to

1187
00:40:54,880 --> 00:40:59,200
provide premium subsidies to producers

1188
00:40:56,960 --> 00:41:02,160
who plant qualifying cover crops

1189
00:40:59,200 --> 00:41:04,160
the cover act extends the 5 acre

1190
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:06,640
premium subsidy offered by the pandemic

1191
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:08,480
cover crop program and boost technical

1192
00:41:06,640 --> 00:41:10,000
and research assistance to help farmers

1193
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:11,839
to reduce production risks while

1194
00:41:10,000 --> 00:41:13,680
continuing to access

1195
00:41:11,839 --> 00:41:15,200
the federal crop program's financial

1196
00:41:13,680 --> 00:41:17,359
safety net

1197
00:41:15,200 --> 00:41:19,599
the cover act is fully voluntary it does

1198
00:41:17,359 --> 00:41:21,119
not require farmers to plant cover crops

1199
00:41:19,599 --> 00:41:22,319
in order to be eligible for crop

1200
00:41:21,119 --> 00:41:24,720
insurance

1201
00:41:22,319 --> 00:41:27,119
and it complements existing usda

1202
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:29,119
programs while providing an easy access

1203
00:41:27,119 --> 00:41:30,400
pathway to support farmers planting

1204
00:41:29,119 --> 00:41:32,560
covers

1205
00:41:30,400 --> 00:41:34,400
the the act also provides additional

1206
00:41:32,560 --> 00:41:36,800
funding for technical assistance to

1207
00:41:34,400 --> 00:41:39,040
support outreach effort and it creates a

1208
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:41,040
soil health pilot program to evaluate

1209
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:42,960
how additional premium subsidies can be

1210
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:45,359
offered for other soil health practices

1211
00:41:42,960 --> 00:41:48,960
that can reduce risk and comply with the

1212
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:51,040
goals of the federal crop program

1213
00:41:48,960 --> 00:41:53,520
please feel free to reach out to me or

1214
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:56,240

okay thanks again dan um thanks for

1249
00:43:06,319 --> 00:43:10,880
introducing me and good morning everyone

1250
00:43:09,359 --> 00:43:13,040
as dan said

1251
00:43:10,880 --> 00:43:14,720
my name is brittany and i'm the ceo of

1252
00:43:13,040 --> 00:43:17,839
go roam free

1253
00:43:14,720 --> 00:43:19,680
my husband and i run rome free ranch in

1254
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:21,839
hot springs montana

1255
00:43:19,680 --> 00:43:22,880
and we are first generation bison

1256
00:43:21,839 --> 00:43:25,440
ranchers

1257
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:27,839
running a regenerative meat company

1258
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:30,319
um so like i said you know as first

1259
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:33,200
generation bison ranchers

1260
00:43:30,319 --> 00:43:34,720
we really believe that as an industry we

1261
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:36,800
can do better

1262
00:43:34,720 --> 00:43:38,720
we believe not only can we do better but

1263
00:43:36,800 --> 00:43:41,920
we must do better than what the modern

1264
00:43:38,720 --> 00:43:44,160
food system has to offer and so at roam

1265
00:43:41,920 --> 00:43:46,800
free we promote an approach to animal

1266
00:43:44,160 --> 00:43:48,240
agriculture that restores human health

1267
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,880
so that's that we do that through

1268
00:43:48,240 --> 00:43:54,000
providing nutrient-dense products

1269
00:43:50,880 --> 00:43:55,520
we focus on repairing u.s grasslands and

1270
00:43:54,000 --> 00:43:57,200
we do that through regenerative

1271
00:43:55,520 --> 00:43:59,440
management

1272
00:43:57,200 --> 00:44:03,200
and then we prioritize animal welfare

1273
00:43:59,440 --> 00:44:03,200
and we do that above our bottom line

1274
00:44:04,000 --> 00:44:08,960
but our origin story actually starts a

1275
00:44:06,960 --> 00:44:10,960
long time ago

1276
00:44:08,960 --> 00:44:12,960
it starts actually back in the summer of

1277
00:44:10,960 --> 00:44:15,119
1989.

1278
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:17,200
this is john's dad here on the left and

1279
00:44:15,119 --> 00:44:18,240
my husband john is a little guy there on

1280
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:21,119
the right

1281
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:23,280
and john's dad had just bought two pairs

1282
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:24,480
of very short shorts and a brand new

1283
00:44:23,280 --> 00:44:26,800
camcorder

1284
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:29,359
and they were on their annual trip

1285
00:44:26,800 --> 00:44:31,760
across the u.s his dad was a military

1286
00:44:29,359 --> 00:44:33,040
officer so they moved 18 times in 18

1287
00:44:31,760 --> 00:44:34,640
years

1288
00:44:33,040 --> 00:44:37,440
and along the way they stopped in

1289
00:44:34,640 --> 00:44:39,440
montana to see the wild bison

1290
00:44:37,440 --> 00:44:41,760
and it was here that john learned the

1291
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:44,000
history of the american bison he learned

1292
00:44:41,760 --> 00:44:45,760
all about their rise and their fall and

1293
00:44:44,000 --> 00:44:48,319
how their migration patterns actually

1294
00:44:45,760 --> 00:44:51,760
created that fertile topsoil that we

1295
00:44:48,319 --> 00:44:54,240
rely on today um he learned how there

1296
00:44:51,760 --> 00:44:56,640
used to be over a hundred million bison

1297
00:44:54,240 --> 00:44:58,560
roaming across the plains and how they

1298
00:44:56,640 --> 00:44:59,920
nearly went extinct to make way for

1299
00:44:58,560 --> 00:45:01,680
settlers

1300
00:44:59,920 --> 00:45:03,520
but i think the most important story

1301
00:45:01,680 --> 00:45:05,520
that john's dad told him was actually

1302
00:45:03,520 --> 00:45:08,240
about a montana rancher

1303
00:45:05,520 --> 00:45:10,480
and it was a man who rounded up the last

1304
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:12,240
of the wild bison and saved the species

1305
00:45:10,480 --> 00:45:14,720
from extinction

1306
00:45:12,240 --> 00:45:16,640
he was super inspired by the story and

1307
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:17,839
from that moment on at four years of age

1308
00:45:16,640 --> 00:45:20,400
he knew he was going to be a bison

1309
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:23,280
rancher but he had to go to school so

1310
00:45:20,400 --> 00:45:26,079
fast forward to 2014

1311
00:45:23,280 --> 00:45:28,960
john had graduated from the air force

1312
00:45:26,079 --> 00:45:31,520
academy he spent five years of

1313
00:45:28,960 --> 00:45:34,079
commitment service and then he was ready

1314
00:45:31,520 --> 00:45:36,880
to you know follow his true uh first

1315
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:39,280
passion which was bison um

1316
00:45:36,880 --> 00:45:41,760
during that time he spent um in the

1317
00:45:39,280 --> 00:45:42,640
military he actually lived on the flight

1318
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:44,240
line

1319
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:46,560
and he did that so he could bank his

1320
00:45:44,240 --> 00:45:48,640
housing allowance he ate strictly peanut

1321
00:45:46,560 --> 00:45:51,200
butter and jelly to save and up

1322
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:53,440
save up enough money to buy a very small

1323
00:45:51,200 --> 00:45:55,040
piece of ground in western montana and

1324
00:45:53,440 --> 00:45:57,839
nine bison

1325
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:59,920
um but sadly just two years into his

1326
00:45:57,839 --> 00:46:02,640
venture after he had built the ranch and

1327
00:45:59,920 --> 00:46:05,040
got the bison built a house john had

1328
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:07,119
listed the ranch for sale

1329
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:09,440
and he just couldn't make make it work

1330
00:46:07,119 --> 00:46:11,200
financially he struggled to compete

1331
00:46:09,440 --> 00:46:13,280
against the large corporations that

1332
00:46:11,200 --> 00:46:15,040
really dominate our food system

1333
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:17,680
and that's when i met john

1334
00:46:15,040 --> 00:46:20,160
i will skip all of the sweet mushy parts

1335
00:46:17,680 --> 00:46:22,319
about the story but ultimately

1336
00:46:20,160 --> 00:46:24,480
he convinced me to marry him and i

1337
00:46:22,319 --> 00:46:25,839
convinced him to give the ranch one last

1338
00:46:24,480 --> 00:46:28,400
go

1339
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:30,800
we doubled down on everything

1340
00:46:28,400 --> 00:46:32,480
i quit my corporate job john

1341
00:46:30,800 --> 00:46:35,119
and i sold our house

1342
00:46:32,480 --> 00:46:37,520
and his parents mortgaged theirs to give

1343
00:46:35,119 --> 00:46:39,200
us a loan to start a new business

1344
00:46:37,520 --> 00:46:40,880
and the idea was we would create a

1345
00:46:39,200 --> 00:46:42,720
value-added product that we'd sell

1346
00:46:40,880 --> 00:46:44,880
direct to market and cut out all of the

1347
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:47,520
middlemen

1348
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:49,440
um in 2017 we launched our very first

1349
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,520
product which is bison bites it's a

1350
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:53,520
hundred percent grass-fed and

1351
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,960
grass-finished meat snack that also is

1352
00:46:53,520 --> 00:46:58,240
sugar-free

1353
00:46:54,960 --> 00:46:58,240
and if you go to the next slide

1354
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,200
we just recently launched a line of

1355
00:47:00,960 --> 00:47:05,359
ready to eat meals that have prepared

1356
00:47:03,200 --> 00:47:08,480
sous-vide this is one example this is

1357
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:11,520
our bison chili and our products are now

1358
00:47:08,480 --> 00:47:14,240
sold in costco in natural grocers and

1359
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:16,400
over 400 independent retailers across

1360
00:47:14,240 --> 00:47:19,040
the u.s

1361
00:47:16,400 --> 00:47:19,040
next slide

1362
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:24,000
so while we've seen tremendous support

1363
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:26,160
from our community here locally and

1364
00:47:24,000 --> 00:47:28,720
nationwide we've had really strong

1365
00:47:26,160 --> 00:47:30,880
demand for our products it it hasn't

1366
00:47:28,720 --> 00:47:32,720
come without a significant amount of

1367
00:47:30,880 --> 00:47:34,960
challenges and sacrifice

1368
00:47:32,720 --> 00:47:36,880
and i don't think our story is unique

1369
00:47:34,960 --> 00:47:38,960
you know i think that i know many first

1370
00:47:36,880 --> 00:47:40,640
first-generation ranchers and even

1371
00:47:38,960 --> 00:47:43,040
generational ranchers that have similar

1372
00:47:40,640 --> 00:47:44,480
experiences so i think this our story

1373
00:47:43,040 --> 00:47:47,680
helps to illustrate kind of the

1374
00:47:44,480 --> 00:47:48,640
struggles that regenerative producers go

1375
00:47:47,680 --> 00:47:51,359
through

1376
00:47:48,640 --> 00:47:53,200
um john and i we always joke that if i

1377
00:47:51,359 --> 00:47:54,800
had known the kind of barriers we'd run

1378
00:47:53,200 --> 00:47:56,400
into i would have sold that ranch way

1379
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,640
back in 2014

1380
00:47:56,400 --> 00:48:00,160
but but all jokes aside the truth is

1381
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:02,160
that

1382
00:48:00,160 --> 00:48:04,319
while regenerative agriculture has been

1383
00:48:02,160 --> 00:48:07,680
one of the most rewarding experiences of

1384
00:48:04,319 --> 00:48:09,200
my life it hasn't been the easiest path

1385
00:48:07,680 --> 00:48:11,839
our food system

1386
00:48:09,200 --> 00:48:14,079
and the infrastructure that supports it

1387
00:48:11,839 --> 00:48:16,400
is really built to benefit these large

1388
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:18,160
multinational corporations that control

1389
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:20,400
the industry

1390
00:48:18,160 --> 00:48:22,319
and you know as a small brand if you

1391
00:48:20,400 --> 00:48:25,920
manage to keep your head above water

1392
00:48:22,319 --> 00:48:27,119
long enough um really the only long-term

1393
00:48:25,920 --> 00:48:29,200
success

1394
00:48:27,119 --> 00:48:31,760
plan is to sell your business to one of

1395
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:34,640
those larger corporations um to pay off

1396
00:48:31,760 --> 00:48:36,480
your inevitable debt that you're sure to

1397
00:48:34,640 --> 00:48:38,559
accumulate so

1398
00:48:36,480 --> 00:48:39,839
i think as most people know

1399
00:48:38,559 --> 00:48:42,480
80 percent

1400
00:48:39,839 --> 00:48:45,280
of our industry is owned by just four

1401
00:48:42,480 --> 00:48:47,200
large multinational corporations

1402
00:48:45,280 --> 00:48:50,319
and they control the infrastructure to

1403
00:48:47,200 --> 00:48:53,119
further process livestock

1404
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:56,160
and while animals livestock animals are

1405
00:48:53,119 --> 00:48:57,440
born and raised on ranches all across

1406
00:48:56,160 --> 00:48:59,920
the u.s

1407
00:48:57,440 --> 00:49:01,920
most or the majority are trucked down to

1408
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:03,440
that fertile corn belt for finishing and

1409
00:49:01,920 --> 00:49:05,839
processing

1410
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:08,160
um and this just gives the power

1411
00:49:05,839 --> 00:49:10,640
the leverage and the value that's

1412
00:49:08,160 --> 00:49:12,079
created to those corporations rather

1413
00:49:10,640 --> 00:49:13,839
than the rural communities where the

1414
00:49:12,079 --> 00:49:17,200
animals are grown

1415
00:49:13,839 --> 00:49:19,599
um so to make it roam free as a ranch

1416
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,960
has to operate completely outside of the

1417
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:23,520
system

1418
00:49:20,960 --> 00:49:25,920
we compete for slaughter slots

1419
00:49:23,520 --> 00:49:27,760
from small custom processors

1420
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:30,400
we typically have to commit to those

1421
00:49:27,760 --> 00:49:33,440
slots 18 months in advance so we're

1422
00:49:30,400 --> 00:49:34,800
making really big bets on our sales

1423
00:49:33,440 --> 00:49:37,359
forecast

1424
00:49:34,800 --> 00:49:40,160
and we only round up our animals once a

1425
00:49:37,359 --> 00:49:42,640
year to for processing we check them

1426
00:49:40,160 --> 00:49:43,680
over 16 hours

1427
00:49:42,640 --> 00:49:45,839
which is

1428
00:49:43,680 --> 00:49:48,960
you know the part that we hate the most

1429
00:49:45,839 --> 00:49:51,119
about our job um and then we freeze our

1430
00:49:48,960 --> 00:49:52,960
meat and use it throughout the year so

1431
00:49:51,119 --> 00:49:56,160
we end up paying very high costs for

1432
00:49:52,960 --> 00:49:58,640
cold storage for transportation

1433
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,359
especially in this environment and in

1434
00:49:58,640 --> 00:50:03,760
addition our slaughter costs cost us

1435
00:50:01,359 --> 00:50:05,920
four times more than what our larger

1436
00:50:03,760 --> 00:50:07,520
competitors pay

1437
00:50:05,920 --> 00:50:09,520
and it's not just the slaughter that's

1438
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:13,040
challenging it's also the further

1439
00:50:09,520 --> 00:50:15,680
processing or the value-added portion so

1440
00:50:13,040 --> 00:50:19,040
we use a local smokehouse and we learned

1441
00:50:15,680 --> 00:50:20,960
recently that they they had to pick up

1442
00:50:19,040 --> 00:50:23,200
a contract from one of the largest

1443
00:50:20,960 --> 00:50:24,559
turkey brands in order to have just a

1444
00:50:23,200 --> 00:50:25,760
consistent

1445
00:50:24,559 --> 00:50:28,160
business

1446
00:50:25,760 --> 00:50:30,800
and so they had to push out smaller

1447
00:50:28,160 --> 00:50:32,400
brands like us you know just to make

1448
00:50:30,800 --> 00:50:34,559
room for them

1449
00:50:32,400 --> 00:50:36,720
and there just really isn't any capacity

1450
00:50:34,559 --> 00:50:38,800
for smoking and curing available right

1451
00:50:36,720 --> 00:50:40,400
now as some of these larger brands

1452
00:50:38,800 --> 00:50:43,040
continue to get bigger and bigger and

1453
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:45,040
take over more market share

1454
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:47,440
the perfect example of this is just a

1455
00:50:45,040 --> 00:50:49,520
few months ago we had to turn down what

1456
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:52,079
would be an estimated one million dollar

1457
00:50:49,520 --> 00:50:53,680
purchase order from sprouts

1458
00:50:52,079 --> 00:50:55,440
because of the lack of capacity and so

1459
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:57,280
we're working through that trying to

1460
00:50:55,440 --> 00:50:59,760
figure out how to you know grow

1461
00:50:57,280 --> 00:51:02,800
regionally and and just work with within

1462
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:06,079
the capacity that we have

1463
00:51:02,800 --> 00:51:06,079
if you want to go to the next slide

1464
00:51:06,480 --> 00:51:09,920
uh so what can be done about the

1465
00:51:08,559 --> 00:51:12,720
infrastructure

1466
00:51:09,920 --> 00:51:14,319
we feel that um we need to invest

1467
00:51:12,720 --> 00:51:17,119
significantly

1468
00:51:14,319 --> 00:51:19,839
in regional infrastructure so

1469
00:51:17,119 --> 00:51:21,680
you know decentralizing our food system

1470
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:24,079
and giving some of that value back to

1471
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:26,079
the producers on the land so that they

1472
00:51:24,079 --> 00:51:28,640
can stay on the land um and this is

1473
00:51:26,079 --> 00:51:30,559
really the only way we see regenerative

1474
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:32,559
producers succeeding

1475
00:51:30,559 --> 00:51:34,240
um john and i have been trying to

1476
00:51:32,559 --> 00:51:36,400
develop actually a mobile processing

1477
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:38,640
unit over the last couple years

1478
00:51:36,400 --> 00:51:41,280
we believe it's the most efficient

1479
00:51:38,640 --> 00:51:43,200
sustainable and certainly the safest way

1480
00:51:41,280 --> 00:51:45,200
to process our animals but we just

1481
00:51:43,200 --> 00:51:46,880
haven't been able to get there and i

1482
00:51:45,200 --> 00:51:48,720
think first and foremost it's it's

1483
00:51:46,880 --> 00:51:50,319
because ranchers like us need affordable

1484
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,680
financing

1485
00:51:50,319 --> 00:51:53,200
you know leveraging our parents

1486
00:51:51,680 --> 00:51:54,880
retirement just isn't going to work

1487
00:51:53,200 --> 00:51:56,960
again so

1488
00:51:54,880 --> 00:51:59,839
so we need access to that to that cheap

1489
00:51:56,960 --> 00:52:01,280
capital um and then secondly

1490
00:51:59,839 --> 00:52:02,640
a lot of it is just help with the

1491
00:52:01,280 --> 00:52:04,960
regulatory

1492
00:52:02,640 --> 00:52:06,559
process and paperwork and getting some

1493
00:52:04,960 --> 00:52:08,480
consultation around how to get through

1494
00:52:06,559 --> 00:52:11,599
that

1495
00:52:08,480 --> 00:52:11,599
you go to the next slide

1496
00:52:12,160 --> 00:52:15,760
um and i just want to leave you with

1497
00:52:13,680 --> 00:52:16,559
this thought so you know a lot of people

1498
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:18,640
ask

1499
00:52:16,559 --> 00:52:20,160
well why invest in new infrastructure

1500
00:52:18,640 --> 00:52:23,440
we've got a system in place it's been

1501
00:52:20,160 --> 00:52:24,960
working for 100 years why now and i

1502
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:26,960
think it's because honestly we're

1503
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,839
running out of time

1504
00:52:26,960 --> 00:52:32,400
the american grasslands in america used

1505
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:33,200
to be the most diverse ecosystem that we

1506
00:52:32,400 --> 00:52:35,119
had

1507
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:37,839
but industrial agriculture has really

1508
00:52:35,119 --> 00:52:40,079
depleted that finite resource and and

1509
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:42,400
changed the landscape that we produced

1510
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:44,160
mostly just five commodities and what

1511
00:52:42,400 --> 00:52:45,359
was the most diverse ecosystem in the

1512
00:52:44,160 --> 00:52:47,359
world

1513
00:52:45,359 --> 00:52:49,520
and we're depleting about 24 billion

1514
00:52:47,359 --> 00:52:50,800
metric tons of topsoil each year

1515
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:53,839
globally

1516
00:52:50,800 --> 00:52:55,119
so we're tilling that up for mono crops

1517
00:52:53,839 --> 00:52:57,599
we're releasing carbon into the

1518
00:52:55,119 --> 00:52:59,680
atmosphere at an alarming rate and we've

1519
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:02,160
lost that rich biodiversity that once

1520
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:05,200
created the fertile soil

1521
00:53:02,160 --> 00:53:07,119
that leads to a lack of resiliency on a

1522
00:53:05,200 --> 00:53:08,480
dependence on foreign chemicals and

1523
00:53:07,119 --> 00:53:11,200
other inputs

1524
00:53:08,480 --> 00:53:13,280
and some estimates and people argue this

1525
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:15,440
all the time but we know that if we do

1526
00:53:13,280 --> 00:53:18,079
nothing we will eventually run out of

1527
00:53:15,440 --> 00:53:18,079
topsoil

1528
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:21,520
to the next slide please

1529
00:53:22,000 --> 00:53:26,240
but there is a solution so you know it's

1530
00:53:24,319 --> 00:53:28,480
right under our feet and it has been

1531
00:53:26,240 --> 00:53:30,640
around since the very beginning of time

1532
00:53:28,480 --> 00:53:33,520
and that's regenerative agriculture and

1533
00:53:30,640 --> 00:53:36,079
that's agriculture that builds top soil

1534
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:39,200
it increases biodiversity it adds

1535
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:42,160
resilience and strengthens rural america

1536
00:53:39,200 --> 00:53:44,000
and it offers this abundant diverse rich

1537
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:46,240
food system that actually nourishes the

1538
00:53:44,000 --> 00:53:47,920
people it's meant to support

1539
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:50,319
and we just need the infrastructure to

1540
00:53:47,920 --> 00:53:52,160
support it so um

1541
00:53:50,319 --> 00:53:54,319
that's it the next slide is just my

1542
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:56,480
contact information if anybody has any

1543
00:53:54,319 --> 00:53:59,440
questions or wants to discuss things

1544
00:53:56,480 --> 00:54:02,640
further i'd love to talk to you and

1545
00:53:59,440 --> 00:54:02,640
just thank you so much for your time

1546
00:54:04,319 --> 00:54:08,240
thank you brittany for a great

1547
00:54:05,760 --> 00:54:10,800
presentation i have a craving now for

1548
00:54:08,240 --> 00:54:12,720
bison bites um so

1549
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:14,480
thank you for that um i need to eat

1550
00:54:12,720 --> 00:54:16,880
before i do these briefings because now

1551
00:54:14,480 --> 00:54:18,800
that bison chili looks so good and it's

1552
00:54:16,880 --> 00:54:20,240
said it was sous-vide like you can't go

1553
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:22,000
wrong with that so

1554
00:54:20,240 --> 00:54:24,319
have to get some um

1555
00:54:22,000 --> 00:54:26,079
we have lots of time for q a and we have

1556
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:27,520
lots of questions coming in from the

1557
00:54:26,079 --> 00:54:29,359
audience and we have a couple that we

1558
00:54:27,520 --> 00:54:31,920
wanted to talk about uh as well ahead of

1559
00:54:29,359 --> 00:54:34,160
time so why don't we go ahead and dig

1560
00:54:31,920 --> 00:54:36,079
right in to our questions and answers

1561
00:54:34,160 --> 00:54:38,000
and um for people in our audience

1562
00:54:36,079 --> 00:54:41,359
there's still time to ask questions so

1563
00:54:38,000 --> 00:54:43,359
you can send us an email ask at eesi.org

1564
00:54:41,359 --> 00:54:46,480
and also follow us on twitter

1565
00:54:43,359 --> 00:54:48,480
or online at esi online on twitter um

1566
00:54:46,480 --> 00:54:49,839
but the first question i wanted to get

1567
00:54:48,480 --> 00:54:51,119
to and

1568
00:54:49,839 --> 00:54:52,400
i think we'll start with you and then

1569
00:54:51,119 --> 00:54:54,240
we'll go through the

1570
00:54:52,400 --> 00:54:56,079
presentations uh or the order of

1571
00:54:54,240 --> 00:54:58,960
presentations

1572
00:54:56,079 --> 00:55:00,960
how do we mainstream regenerative

1573
00:54:58,960 --> 00:55:03,280
agriculture for someone like me who

1574
00:55:00,960 --> 00:55:05,200
doesn't know a lot about being a farmer

1575
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:07,359
or a rancher i just listen to four

1576
00:55:05,200 --> 00:55:09,359
presentations and i'm i'm totally

1577
00:55:07,359 --> 00:55:11,680
convinced that this is the way to go but

1578
00:55:09,359 --> 00:55:15,359
we're not there yet how do we mainstream

1579
00:55:11,680 --> 00:55:18,319
these practices at scale

1580
00:55:15,359 --> 00:55:21,839
good i'm glad our report worked then

1581
00:55:18,319 --> 00:55:23,920
um well the fun thing is we have a whole

1582
00:55:21,839 --> 00:55:26,240
report that delves into the different

1583
00:55:23,920 --> 00:55:28,559
policy levers we can pull to help make

1584
00:55:26,240 --> 00:55:30,400
regenerative agriculture the norm and

1585
00:55:28,559 --> 00:55:32,720
help mainstream it through through our

1586
00:55:30,400 --> 00:55:35,280
political choices and decisions and

1587
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:36,720
through our policy um and those four

1588
00:55:35,280 --> 00:55:38,240
buckets of reform i've talked about

1589
00:55:36,720 --> 00:55:40,400
already the other panelists have talked

1590
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:42,319
about already leveling the federal

1591
00:55:40,400 --> 00:55:44,000
investment playing field like reforms to

1592
00:55:42,319 --> 00:55:45,520
the federal crop insurance program that

1593
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:48,079
chris mentioned

1594
00:55:45,520 --> 00:55:49,920
finally getting more robust and more

1595
00:55:48,079 --> 00:55:52,319
comprehensive support for farmers and

1596
00:55:49,920 --> 00:55:54,640
ranchers and indigenous growers like

1597
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,000
what dr johnson mentioned really

1598
00:55:54,640 --> 00:55:58,000
focusing on

1599
00:55:56,000 --> 00:55:59,440
regionalizing and decentralizing our

1600
00:55:58,000 --> 00:56:01,440
food systems infrastructure like

1601
00:55:59,440 --> 00:56:03,280
brittany's so you know thoroughly

1602
00:56:01,440 --> 00:56:04,559
discussed like these are the ways that

1603
00:56:03,280 --> 00:56:06,480
we help

1604
00:56:04,559 --> 00:56:08,480
make regenerative agriculture the norm

1605
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:10,480
that the backbone that infrastructure

1606
00:56:08,480 --> 00:56:13,040
the policy decisions that can really

1607
00:56:10,480 --> 00:56:14,720
help fuel um getting more acres under

1608
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:16,079
regenerative management

1609
00:56:14,720 --> 00:56:18,640
now the other thing i would want to i

1610
00:56:16,079 --> 00:56:20,400
would want to say here is um

1611
00:56:18,640 --> 00:56:22,640
like regenerative agriculture isn't

1612
00:56:20,400 --> 00:56:25,119
hypothetical it's not some like oh i

1613
00:56:22,640 --> 00:56:26,960
wish this was happening or this sounds

1614
00:56:25,119 --> 00:56:28,880
like a really good idea

1615
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:31,359
regenerative agriculture is happening

1616
00:56:28,880 --> 00:56:33,760
there are growers who are practicing who

1617
00:56:31,359 --> 00:56:36,160
are using this management philosophy

1618
00:56:33,760 --> 00:56:39,440
already and i think what will help

1619
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:42,240
mainstream this movement is to point out

1620
00:56:39,440 --> 00:56:44,559
to the shine shine the light on these

1621
00:56:42,240 --> 00:56:46,000
incredible leaders of of the

1622
00:56:44,559 --> 00:56:49,280
regenerative movement the folks who are

1623
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:50,799
doing this work in every single state um

1624
00:56:49,280 --> 00:56:53,359
learning from them

1625
00:56:50,799 --> 00:56:55,920
getting their ideas for how to engage

1626
00:56:53,359 --> 00:56:58,720
with consumers with policy makers at the

1627
00:56:55,920 --> 00:57:00,240
local state or federal level bringing in

1628
00:56:58,720 --> 00:57:02,000
indigenous communities and other

1629
00:57:00,240 --> 00:57:04,160
historically underserved communities to

1630
00:57:02,000 --> 00:57:05,920
the decision-making table i mean the

1631
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:07,680
fact that we're having this briefing the

1632
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:09,440
fact that we're having this conversation

1633
00:57:07,680 --> 00:57:12,000
is a step in the right direction and i'm

1634
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,960
excited for more opportunities

1635
00:57:12,000 --> 00:57:14,640
to

1636
00:57:12,960 --> 00:57:16,400
shine a light on the leaders like the

1637
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,640
three farmers represented on this panel

1638
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,640
today

1639
00:57:19,680 --> 00:57:24,240
michael love to hear your thoughts about

1640
00:57:21,520 --> 00:57:25,680
how we can mainstream these practices

1641
00:57:24,240 --> 00:57:27,359
well you know i think a lot of it has to

1642
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:29,200
do with the way our market system set up

1643
00:57:27,359 --> 00:57:30,880
right now of the usda market system the

1644
00:57:29,200 --> 00:57:32,799
market formula because right now we're

1645
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:35,280
based based upon everything off of

1646
00:57:32,799 --> 00:57:36,720
efficiency and quantity so because we

1647
00:57:35,280 --> 00:57:38,160
have efficiency and quantity we're

1648
00:57:36,720 --> 00:57:39,680
having to use these different types of

1649
00:57:38,160 --> 00:57:41,440
inputs that aren't very environmentally

1650
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:44,000
friendly like pesticides herbicides and

1651
00:57:41,440 --> 00:57:46,240
everything and so uh in order to

1652
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:47,760
re redo that we need to go back to one

1653
00:57:46,240 --> 00:57:49,280
of which would be based on quality like

1654
00:57:47,760 --> 00:57:51,040
what kind of quality goods are coming

1655
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:52,720
out we all know that plant-based derived

1656
00:57:51,040 --> 00:57:54,640
and degenerative agriculture have high

1657
00:57:52,720 --> 00:57:56,000
quality in the stuff we have

1658
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:57,680
you know when you even look at you know

1659
00:57:56,000 --> 00:57:59,119
cattle grass-fed cattle their nutrient

1660
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,240
value is a lot better than the lot dead

1661
00:57:59,119 --> 00:58:01,839
cattle just because of the things

1662
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:03,599
they're eating it's all plant-based

1663
00:58:01,839 --> 00:58:05,680
buffalo especially buffalo probably the

1664
00:58:03,599 --> 00:58:07,200
number one food source that we that we

1665
00:58:05,680 --> 00:58:08,559
eat out there but we don't subsidize

1666
00:58:07,200 --> 00:58:09,760
enough because there's always some sort

1667
00:58:08,559 --> 00:58:11,359
of uh

1668
00:58:09,760 --> 00:58:13,200
you know arguments between the cattle

1669
00:58:11,359 --> 00:58:15,280
and buffalo as far as what's better for

1670
00:58:13,200 --> 00:58:17,200
the what's better for whatever

1671
00:58:15,280 --> 00:58:18,559
uh as far as that you know uh we talked

1672
00:58:17,200 --> 00:58:21,040
about regionally you know regionally

1673
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:22,319
based um processing centers like the

1674
00:58:21,040 --> 00:58:24,640
native american other cultural fund

1675
00:58:22,319 --> 00:58:26,720
supports you know i'm i'm also a fan of

1676
00:58:24,640 --> 00:58:27,839
mobile things uh mobile processing

1677
00:58:26,720 --> 00:58:28,960
centers that was mentioned but the

1678
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:31,119
problem with that is that we don't have

1679
00:58:28,960 --> 00:58:32,799
the usda inspectors to go out and do

1680
00:58:31,119 --> 00:58:34,720
that so it makes it very difficult to

1681
00:58:32,799 --> 00:58:37,760
remove that and so if you look at the

1682
00:58:34,720 --> 00:58:39,119
qua operation oklahoma uh you can see

1683
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:41,200
that they're training those on the

1684
00:58:39,119 --> 00:58:43,040
tribal lands or training those people at

1685
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:44,160
their at their slaughtering house to be

1686
00:58:43,040 --> 00:58:45,839
inspectors

1687
00:58:44,160 --> 00:58:47,760
and so you know it's kind of a it's kind

1688
00:58:45,839 --> 00:58:49,520
of putting it all together

1689
00:58:47,760 --> 00:58:51,760
so but i think the real big problem like

1690
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,440
i said is has to do with the efficient

1691
00:58:51,760 --> 00:58:55,440
efficiency and quantity argument that

1692
00:58:53,440 --> 00:58:57,520
usda offers you know it wasn't too long

1693
00:58:55,440 --> 00:58:58,880
ago that you know corn had a nutrient

1694
00:58:57,520 --> 00:59:00,960
value into that now the only thing that

1695
00:58:58,880 --> 00:59:03,200
has a nutrient value to that is kind of

1696
00:59:00,960 --> 00:59:05,200
like cattle and so when we start putting

1697
00:59:03,200 --> 00:59:06,640
you know animals above human beings as

1698
00:59:05,200 --> 00:59:08,160
far as what we're eating then we come up

1699
00:59:06,640 --> 00:59:09,440
with all these different types of uh

1700
00:59:08,160 --> 00:59:11,760
diseases that are out there heart

1701
00:59:09,440 --> 00:59:13,680
disease cancer everything else so uh we

1702
00:59:11,760 --> 00:59:15,280
need to heal our society we need to heal

1703
00:59:13,680 --> 00:59:16,640
our heal the land that we're that we're

1704
00:59:15,280 --> 00:59:18,880
that work that we're farming on or

1705
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:20,319
producing on so that's basically how i

1706
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:21,599
would streamline that is just change the

1707
00:59:20,319 --> 00:59:23,200
formula around so that you're able to

1708
00:59:21,599 --> 00:59:24,960
support more small farms because we all

1709
00:59:23,200 --> 00:59:26,000
know that small farms have a lot better

1710
00:59:24,960 --> 00:59:27,200
quality

1711
00:59:26,000 --> 00:59:29,680
in their food

1712
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:32,880
than the big and the big corporations do

1713
00:59:29,680 --> 00:59:34,799
and so that's about it thanks chris love

1714
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:36,880
to hear from you and then also brittany

1715
00:59:34,799 --> 00:59:39,280
love to hear um your perspective as a

1716
00:59:36,880 --> 00:59:39,280
rancher

1717
00:59:39,359 --> 00:59:44,240
yeah thanks dan i think you know as

1718
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:46,160
senator turner mentioned in his opening

1719
00:59:44,240 --> 00:59:48,400
you know there's as many ways to farm as

1720
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:50,960
there are farmers i think we we also

1721
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:53,119
have to recognize that um every farmer's

1722
00:59:50,960 --> 00:59:55,520
in a different place um and and doing

1723
00:59:53,119 --> 00:59:58,400
different practices as i mentioned in my

1724
00:59:55,520 --> 01:00:00,000
opening um you know there are still a

1725
00:59:58,400 --> 01:00:01,760
lot of improvements that i need to make

1726
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:04,400
in my farming operation

1727
01:00:01,760 --> 01:00:05,839
and i recognize that there are there are

1728
01:00:04,400 --> 01:00:07,359
um

1729
01:00:05,839 --> 01:00:09,520
there are challenges that come along

1730
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:12,480
with that but also that i can do better

1731
01:00:09,520 --> 01:00:14,319
by the soil so i think if we want to see

1732
01:00:12,480 --> 01:00:16,960
regenerative agriculture become more

1733
01:00:14,319 --> 01:00:19,680
mainstream we have to we have to be make

1734
01:00:16,960 --> 01:00:22,000
it become more commonplace

1735
01:00:19,680 --> 01:00:23,839
we have to recognize that the farmers

1736
01:00:22,000 --> 01:00:26,400
want to do better by the soul but don't

1737
01:00:23,839 --> 01:00:29,280
often have the technical and financial

1738
01:00:26,400 --> 01:00:30,000
resources available at that local level

1739
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:32,720
to

1740
01:00:30,000 --> 01:00:35,119
to be able to adopt and these new

1741
01:00:32,720 --> 01:00:36,640
practices so i think it's a journey i

1742
01:00:35,119 --> 01:00:38,799
think you know farmers have to start

1743
01:00:36,640 --> 01:00:41,520
adopting some practices

1744
01:00:38,799 --> 01:00:43,839
that lead them to the regenerative ag

1745
01:00:41,520 --> 01:00:43,839
system

1746
01:00:45,599 --> 01:00:49,119
and brittany from your perspective

1747
01:00:47,760 --> 01:00:50,319
as a

1748
01:00:49,119 --> 01:00:52,960
one of the newer regenerative

1749
01:00:50,319 --> 01:00:54,799
agriculture or one of the new newer

1750
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:56,640
adopters of regenerative agriculture on

1751
01:00:54,799 --> 01:00:58,720
the panel how can we make this more

1752
01:00:56,640 --> 01:01:00,079
common

1753
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:02,400
um you know

1754
01:01:00,079 --> 01:01:05,280
i think about it from our products

1755
01:01:02,400 --> 01:01:07,599
perspective so you know as a customer

1756
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:09,440
i'm gonna go to go to costco and on the

1757
01:01:07,599 --> 01:01:11,599
shelf you know probably the regenerative

1758
01:01:09,440 --> 01:01:13,520
products or the grass-fed products are

1759
01:01:11,599 --> 01:01:15,920
twice as expensive three times as

1760
01:01:13,520 --> 01:01:17,680
expensive and at the end of the day

1761
01:01:15,920 --> 01:01:19,599
as producers we're not we're not really

1762
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:22,799
paid more for doing regenerative

1763
01:01:19,599 --> 01:01:24,799
agriculture and where the biggest um

1764
01:01:22,799 --> 01:01:27,119
the biggest bucket of money is going is

1765
01:01:24,799 --> 01:01:29,520
in that isn't that further processing

1766
01:01:27,119 --> 01:01:32,480
and so when you know are we

1767
01:01:29,520 --> 01:01:34,720
we have to be price competitive uh from

1768
01:01:32,480 --> 01:01:37,040
a consumer's perspective and if it's

1769
01:01:34,720 --> 01:01:39,520
going to go mainstream and if our of our

1770
01:01:37,040 --> 01:01:41,440
processing is costing four times more

1771
01:01:39,520 --> 01:01:43,119
than conventional agriculture it's going

1772
01:01:41,440 --> 01:01:45,839
to be very hard to

1773
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:47,680
to shore up that gap um

1774
01:01:45,839 --> 01:01:49,280
and then you know just like michael said

1775
01:01:47,680 --> 01:01:51,200
it the

1776
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:53,359
you know the focus the farm bill has a

1777
01:01:51,200 --> 01:01:55,039
big nutrition component and the focus

1778
01:01:53,359 --> 01:01:57,359
has always been you know how do we

1779
01:01:55,039 --> 01:01:59,119
produce as many calories as possible

1780
01:01:57,359 --> 01:02:01,839
it's always calorie focused rather than

1781
01:01:59,119 --> 01:02:04,799
nutrient density focused and so if

1782
01:02:01,839 --> 01:02:05,520
eventually our food is completely devoid

1783
01:02:04,799 --> 01:02:06,720
of

1784
01:02:05,520 --> 01:02:08,240
nutrients because we don't have

1785
01:02:06,720 --> 01:02:10,319
microorganisms because we don't have

1786
01:02:08,240 --> 01:02:12,000
biodiversity

1787
01:02:10,319 --> 01:02:14,720
then we may be producing more and more

1788
01:02:12,000 --> 01:02:15,920
calories and getting you know sicker and

1789
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:18,000
sicker because we don't have the

1790
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:19,760
nutrients in our food that we used to

1791
01:02:18,000 --> 01:02:22,559
and so i think you know that's a big

1792
01:02:19,760 --> 01:02:24,640
component of how we we um

1793
01:02:22,559 --> 01:02:26,880
the nutrition part of the farm bill is

1794
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:29,920
where we can add into a focus on

1795
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:31,200
regenerative nutrient-dense food

1796
01:02:29,920 --> 01:02:33,039
great

1797
01:02:31,200 --> 01:02:35,039
um i'm going to ask this next question

1798
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:36,559
this one comes to us from our audience

1799
01:02:35,039 --> 01:02:39,200
and i think it's actually a good

1800
01:02:36,559 --> 01:02:41,920
follow-up to this first question

1801
01:02:39,200 --> 01:02:43,359
one of your slides you had 16 boxes and

1802
01:02:41,920 --> 01:02:45,039
you had different regenerative

1803
01:02:43,359 --> 01:02:47,119
agriculture practices

1804
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:48,400
this question comes to us from our

1805
01:02:47,119 --> 01:02:49,520
audience

1806
01:02:48,400 --> 01:02:51,599
asking us

1807
01:02:49,520 --> 01:02:53,359
so which of those practices are most

1808
01:02:51,599 --> 01:02:56,720
commonly used

1809
01:02:53,359 --> 01:02:59,520
and do we have any ideas of overall how

1810
01:02:56,720 --> 01:03:01,119
many farmers or ranchers are using

1811
01:02:59,520 --> 01:03:02,720
these practices

1812
01:03:01,119 --> 01:03:04,160
is it is it millions of farmers is it

1813
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,160
thousands of farmers but which are the

1814
01:03:04,160 --> 01:03:08,480
ones that are most common and

1815
01:03:06,160 --> 01:03:10,160
i'm happy to start with you rohit but

1816
01:03:08,480 --> 01:03:11,440
i'm eager to hear others thoughts as

1817
01:03:10,160 --> 01:03:13,760
well we'll open this up to the group

1818
01:03:11,440 --> 01:03:15,680
after you go

1819
01:03:13,760 --> 01:03:17,599
yeah um like i mentioned in the

1820
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:19,200
presentation regenerative agriculture

1821
01:03:17,599 --> 01:03:20,559
looks pretty looks very different

1822
01:03:19,200 --> 01:03:22,720
depending on where you are a

1823
01:03:20,559 --> 01:03:24,240
regenerative grower in the pacific

1824
01:03:22,720 --> 01:03:25,920
northwest is going to have a different

1825
01:03:24,240 --> 01:03:28,079
farming system or farming style than

1826
01:03:25,920 --> 01:03:31,680
someone from maine and somewhere from

1827
01:03:28,079 --> 01:03:34,240
texas than someone from iowa um but the

1828
01:03:31,680 --> 01:03:36,079
the five the five principles that i

1829
01:03:34,240 --> 01:03:37,680
shared do there are some common

1830
01:03:36,079 --> 01:03:40,240
practices that help

1831
01:03:37,680 --> 01:03:41,280
um address all five principles kind of

1832
01:03:40,240 --> 01:03:44,160
at once

1833
01:03:41,280 --> 01:03:46,880
cover cropping was mentioned a lot um

1834
01:03:44,160 --> 01:03:49,280
no-till or low-till was mentioned a lot

1835
01:03:46,880 --> 01:03:51,760
focusing on diversification crop

1836
01:03:49,280 --> 01:03:55,119
diversification planting perennial crops

1837
01:03:51,760 --> 01:03:58,720
to help build um soil organic matter

1838
01:03:55,119 --> 01:04:00,720
um agroforestry was mentioned um as a

1839
01:03:58,720 --> 01:04:03,119
practice trying to think of what else

1840
01:04:00,720 --> 01:04:04,079
crop rotations i mean there were some

1841
01:04:03,119 --> 01:04:06,079
common

1842
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:08,000
practices but the the beauty of

1843
01:04:06,079 --> 01:04:09,680
regenerative agriculture was like what

1844
01:04:08,000 --> 01:04:12,079
chris was saying there's always a chance

1845
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:14,160
to be better and so depending on where

1846
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:16,240
we caught people on their regenerative

1847
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:19,119
journey they were using a different

1848
01:04:16,240 --> 01:04:20,960
suite of practices

1849
01:04:19,119 --> 01:04:22,000
and michael chris brittany please feel

1850
01:04:20,960 --> 01:04:23,920
free to jump in if you have any

1851
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:24,960
additional commentary about

1852
01:04:23,920 --> 01:04:28,400
what are some of the more common

1853
01:04:24,960 --> 01:04:28,400
practices and how widely

1854
01:04:30,720 --> 01:04:35,839
um i i can really just speak to animal

1855
01:04:33,280 --> 01:04:39,200
agriculture um and the most common

1856
01:04:35,839 --> 01:04:41,920
practices that i see in in my area um i

1857
01:04:39,200 --> 01:04:43,599
mean you know

1858
01:04:41,920 --> 01:04:45,520
people always usually start with the

1859
01:04:43,599 --> 01:04:47,200
practices rather than the holistic view

1860
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:49,119
of what is regenerative agriculture and

1861
01:04:47,200 --> 01:04:51,280
so most people when they when they hear

1862
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:54,079
that they think of rotational grazing

1863
01:04:51,280 --> 01:04:56,240
and so that's really the idea is you're

1864
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:57,839
you know not return you're grazing down

1865
01:04:56,240 --> 01:04:59,680
a particular pasture and then not

1866
01:04:57,839 --> 01:05:02,240
returning to that pasture for at least

1867
01:04:59,680 --> 01:05:04,240
12 months afterwards to let it rest

1868
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:06,160
um and that looks very different whether

1869
01:05:04,240 --> 01:05:07,839
it's so you're moving your animals every

1870
01:05:06,160 --> 01:05:09,760
day or you're moving your animals every

1871
01:05:07,839 --> 01:05:12,240
seven days or every month

1872
01:05:09,760 --> 01:05:14,559
and it depends again you know so many

1873
01:05:12,240 --> 01:05:16,480
factors go into what practices you're

1874
01:05:14,559 --> 01:05:18,799
going to use i think that's probably the

1875
01:05:16,480 --> 01:05:20,799
most common one and i think it's the one

1876
01:05:18,799 --> 01:05:23,039
that you can't do a lot of the other

1877
01:05:20,799 --> 01:05:24,559
things until you've

1878
01:05:23,039 --> 01:05:26,160
you've got that figured out because you

1879
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,240
need your pasture arrangements before

1880
01:05:26,160 --> 01:05:32,160
you can start really moving around water

1881
01:05:28,240 --> 01:05:34,319
or or planting or anything else

1882
01:05:32,160 --> 01:05:36,400
and you know as far as

1883
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:38,079
how many people are doing that that's a

1884
01:05:36,400 --> 01:05:40,480
great question i don't know the answer

1885
01:05:38,079 --> 01:05:42,880
um i can tell you in my community

1886
01:05:40,480 --> 01:05:45,839
that um i'm i'm actually on the flathead

1887
01:05:42,880 --> 01:05:47,200
reservation here in western montana

1888
01:05:45,839 --> 01:05:48,400
and we

1889
01:05:47,200 --> 01:05:49,599
you know i haven't

1890
01:05:48,400 --> 01:05:51,599
neighbors that would say they're

1891
01:05:49,599 --> 01:05:53,839
conventional conventional conventional

1892
01:05:51,599 --> 01:05:55,119
you know growers um and they're all

1893
01:05:53,839 --> 01:05:56,640
doing a little bit of regenerative

1894
01:05:55,119 --> 01:05:58,000
agriculture here and there without

1895
01:05:56,640 --> 01:06:00,559
calling it that

1896
01:05:58,000 --> 01:06:02,079
um but true like high intensity where

1897
01:06:00,559 --> 01:06:04,960
you're where you're moving your animals

1898
01:06:02,079 --> 01:06:07,039
every day that's pretty rare around here

1899
01:06:04,960 --> 01:06:09,359
um but they maybe may be doing just one

1900
01:06:07,039 --> 01:06:12,000
or two tenants of what we would consider

1901
01:06:09,359 --> 01:06:12,000
regenerative

1902
01:06:14,640 --> 01:06:19,280
yeah dan i think you know when we look

1903
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:22,079
at you know the soil really wants and

1904
01:06:19,280 --> 01:06:24,000
needs to have plants growing on it in it

1905
01:06:22,079 --> 01:06:27,039
you know year round and so when we can

1906
01:06:24,000 --> 01:06:29,200
go from having a crop growing five or

1907
01:06:27,039 --> 01:06:30,559
six months out of the year to 11 or 12

1908
01:06:29,200 --> 01:06:32,480
months out of the year a plant growing

1909
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:33,920
not even necessarily a crop

1910
01:06:32,480 --> 01:06:35,119
i think that's what's really most

1911
01:06:33,920 --> 01:06:37,200
important

1912
01:06:35,119 --> 01:06:39,760
you know within regenerative agriculture

1913
01:06:37,200 --> 01:06:42,240
and getting more diverse crop rotations

1914
01:06:39,760 --> 01:06:43,920
on the land and then finally you know

1915
01:06:42,240 --> 01:06:45,599
finishing that up with

1916
01:06:43,920 --> 01:06:47,920
with the livestock component you know

1917
01:06:45,599 --> 01:06:50,000
it's really it's a systems approach but

1918
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:52,079
uh i think you have to start with

1919
01:06:50,000 --> 01:06:54,720
making sure there's always a living root

1920
01:06:52,079 --> 01:06:54,720
in that soil

1921
01:06:56,400 --> 01:06:59,839
michael happy to give you uh opportunity

1922
01:06:58,400 --> 01:07:01,119
to weigh in too on which of these

1923
01:06:59,839 --> 01:07:02,720
practices

1924
01:07:01,119 --> 01:07:04,400
i'm just i'm just thinking because you

1925
01:07:02,720 --> 01:07:06,319
know my panelists were talking on such a

1926
01:07:04,400 --> 01:07:07,920
big scale you know i mean our our farms

1927
01:07:06,319 --> 01:07:09,520
out there average one to two acres and

1928
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,520
there's a reason for that because you

1929
01:07:09,520 --> 01:07:12,880
know it's play space designed if we were

1930
01:07:11,520 --> 01:07:14,000
to go any bigger than that we'd have

1931
01:07:12,880 --> 01:07:16,880
blow blowouts because of the wind

1932
01:07:14,000 --> 01:07:18,319
erosion and stuff that we have out there

1933
01:07:16,880 --> 01:07:20,079
but you know just when i look at my own

1934
01:07:18,319 --> 01:07:21,599
cropping system from uh from a technical

1935
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:23,599
standpoint of doing put a little science

1936
01:07:21,599 --> 01:07:25,039
behind it you know our roles out there

1937
01:07:23,599 --> 01:07:27,200
it's not rare would call economically

1938
01:07:25,039 --> 01:07:28,960
valuable i can't take a hopi cornfield

1939
01:07:27,200 --> 01:07:30,960
and put in iowa and expect them to adopt

1940
01:07:28,960 --> 01:07:32,960
that and and to make money off of that

1941
01:07:30,960 --> 01:07:34,559
and so you know our students assistant

1942
01:07:32,960 --> 01:07:37,280
is based upon just our survival our

1943
01:07:34,559 --> 01:07:39,119
cultural survival and who we are at hopi

1944
01:07:37,280 --> 01:07:40,799
and so you know our roles facing it hope

1945
01:07:39,119 --> 01:07:42,720
you for example is you have like six

1946
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:44,160
feet between rows you know you'll have

1947
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,160
clusters of plants you'll have planting

1948
01:07:44,160 --> 01:07:47,200
depths anywhere from six to eighteen

1949
01:07:46,160 --> 01:07:48,880
inches

1950
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:50,799
you know and i like to see corn anywhere

1951
01:07:48,880 --> 01:07:53,039
in the in in the united states come up

1952
01:07:50,799 --> 01:07:55,039
from that depth you know we only receive

1953
01:07:53,039 --> 01:07:56,960
six to ten inches of annual rainfall a

1954
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:58,720
year can you imagine that growing corn

1955
01:07:56,960 --> 01:08:00,720
when i was at cornell they told me three

1956
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:02,720
three inches of annual rainfall a year

1957
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:05,039
and i said we agronomy has something

1958
01:08:02,720 --> 01:08:06,559
else to learn here a little bit

1959
01:08:05,039 --> 01:08:08,079
and so you know it's that type of

1960
01:08:06,559 --> 01:08:10,000
approach but you know for us it's just

1961
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:11,920
place based you know and so it's it's

1962
01:08:10,000 --> 01:08:13,760
our faith in our that makes our crafting

1963
01:08:11,920 --> 01:08:16,640
system so resilient three thousand years

1964
01:08:13,760 --> 01:08:17,520
of doing this method so the replication

1965
01:08:16,640 --> 01:08:19,759
is very

1966
01:08:17,520 --> 01:08:21,759
important also if it works you know

1967
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:23,679
don't change it too much but uh we're

1968
01:08:21,759 --> 01:08:25,279
able to do that and so but anyways

1969
01:08:23,679 --> 01:08:27,279
that's kind of my approach on that

1970
01:08:25,279 --> 01:08:28,799
probably didn't answer the question um i

1971
01:08:27,279 --> 01:08:30,159
don't know how many people are still

1972
01:08:28,799 --> 01:08:31,600
doing that that'd be interesting study

1973
01:08:30,159 --> 01:08:33,679
to know as far as how many people are

1974
01:08:31,600 --> 01:08:37,600
actually doing regenerative agriculture

1975
01:08:33,679 --> 01:08:40,880
and things like that but yeah so thanks

1976
01:08:37,600 --> 01:08:42,960
the usda the usda has its census every

1977
01:08:40,880 --> 01:08:46,239
five years and they capture

1978
01:08:42,960 --> 01:08:48,080
some data on cover crops on conservation

1979
01:08:46,239 --> 01:08:49,759
no-till but i think there's a lot of

1980
01:08:48,080 --> 01:08:51,679
room for improvement on the types of

1981
01:08:49,759 --> 01:08:54,000
questions and data that are collected

1982
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,759
through that census to better address

1983
01:08:54,000 --> 01:08:58,159
this this question of how many folks are

1984
01:08:55,759 --> 01:09:00,239
using these practices

1985
01:08:58,159 --> 01:09:01,920
i was thinking that what britney said is

1986
01:09:00,239 --> 01:09:03,920
probably the case where people are doing

1987
01:09:01,920 --> 01:09:05,359
it even if they're not calling it so

1988
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:06,960
probably a little more widespread at

1989
01:09:05,359 --> 01:09:09,040
least at some level

1990
01:09:06,960 --> 01:09:10,880
um chris i think perhaps we'll start

1991
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:13,279
with you on this next question and then

1992
01:09:10,880 --> 01:09:14,400
we'll go uh we'll open it up to other

1993
01:09:13,279 --> 01:09:15,600
panelists

1994
01:09:14,400 --> 01:09:17,199
something you talked about in your

1995
01:09:15,600 --> 01:09:18,839
presentation there are some things the

1996
01:09:17,199 --> 01:09:22,239
federal government does

1997
01:09:18,839 --> 01:09:23,120
policy-wise that might make it easier or

1998
01:09:22,239 --> 01:09:26,400
harder

1999
01:09:23,120 --> 01:09:27,759
to be a regenerative farmer or rancher

2000
01:09:26,400 --> 01:09:30,239
what are the ways or what are some

2001
01:09:27,759 --> 01:09:31,759
additional ways that federal farm policy

2002
01:09:30,239 --> 01:09:33,759
could be more supportive or more

2003
01:09:31,759 --> 01:09:34,960
encouraging of regenerative agriculture

2004
01:09:33,759 --> 01:09:37,040
and are there things the federal

2005
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:39,359
government does right now that makes it

2006
01:09:37,040 --> 01:09:41,759
harder to be a regenerative farmer or

2007
01:09:39,359 --> 01:09:41,759
rancher

2008
01:09:42,159 --> 01:09:46,880
yeah thanks thanks dan so i think one of

2009
01:09:44,640 --> 01:09:48,560
the things that can be improved is to

2010
01:09:46,880 --> 01:09:51,279
prioritize

2011
01:09:48,560 --> 01:09:53,199
soil health planning and regenerative ag

2012
01:09:51,279 --> 01:09:55,440
planning you know through the federal

2013
01:09:53,199 --> 01:09:58,640
programs you know there's a lot of a lot

2014
01:09:55,440 --> 01:10:00,880
of focus on the practices themselves but

2015
01:09:58,640 --> 01:10:03,280
i think you know providing farmers with

2016
01:10:00,880 --> 01:10:05,120
that technical assistance and ultimately

2017
01:10:03,280 --> 01:10:08,719
financial assistance

2018
01:10:05,120 --> 01:10:08,719
and some incentives to

2019
01:10:09,040 --> 01:10:12,960
be on that soil health journey or that

2020
01:10:10,880 --> 01:10:15,360
regenerative ag journey you know start

2021
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:16,960
out you know with cover crops and start

2022
01:10:15,360 --> 01:10:18,960
you know with no-till and start

2023
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,440
incorporating other regenerative ag

2024
01:10:18,960 --> 01:10:23,679
practices into that farming operation

2025
01:10:21,440 --> 01:10:27,199
and so i think there's a real need to to

2026
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:29,040
to prioritize you know planning from an

2027
01:10:27,199 --> 01:10:31,040
entire farm system

2028
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:33,280
at the field scale

2029
01:10:31,040 --> 01:10:35,440
you know i think there's a lot of a lot

2030
01:10:33,280 --> 01:10:37,040
of you know great things happening

2031
01:10:35,440 --> 01:10:38,480
within the system

2032
01:10:37,040 --> 01:10:40,480
um

2033
01:10:38,480 --> 01:10:43,120
i think there's also a lot of room for

2034
01:10:40,480 --> 01:10:46,000
improvements you know i think that local

2035
01:10:43,120 --> 01:10:48,640
led approach is is something that we we

2036
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:49,440
cannot lose sight of we have to remember

2037
01:10:48,640 --> 01:10:51,280
that

2038
01:10:49,440 --> 01:10:54,239
you know every place is different not

2039
01:10:51,280 --> 01:10:55,920
just in in a particular state but

2040
01:10:54,239 --> 01:10:57,679
every watershed is different every

2041
01:10:55,920 --> 01:10:58,960
county is different every community is

2042
01:10:57,679 --> 01:11:02,000
different so

2043
01:10:58,960 --> 01:11:04,640
you know recognizing that um support is

2044
01:11:02,000 --> 01:11:07,040
needed at that local level is is really

2045
01:11:04,640 --> 01:11:07,040
crucial

2046
01:11:08,320 --> 01:11:13,840
michael arroyo brittany love to hear you

2047
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,840
know

2048
01:11:13,920 --> 01:11:17,360
well i'm kind of i'm kind of geared

2049
01:11:15,520 --> 01:11:19,040
towards her sort of it was just her but

2050
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:21,840
you know it to me you know we subsidize

2051
01:11:19,040 --> 01:11:22,960
so much for for big farms we need to

2052
01:11:21,840 --> 01:11:24,640
have some sort of formula that

2053
01:11:22,960 --> 01:11:26,080
subsidizes smaller ones

2054
01:11:24,640 --> 01:11:27,280
because it really it really you know

2055
01:11:26,080 --> 01:11:29,040
some of the studies show that there's a

2056
01:11:27,280 --> 01:11:30,400
three to five year gap funding gap when

2057
01:11:29,040 --> 01:11:32,239
you're switching over from conventional

2058
01:11:30,400 --> 01:11:34,239
to agriculture you know in the farmer

2059
01:11:32,239 --> 01:11:35,840
american farmer you know i'm not i'm not

2060
01:11:34,239 --> 01:11:37,440
going to be you know or against

2061
01:11:35,840 --> 01:11:38,960
conventional agriculture but that person

2062
01:11:37,440 --> 01:11:41,280
really has no choice because the system

2063
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:43,040
hasn't trapped you know that person has

2064
01:11:41,280 --> 01:11:46,159
to you know has to do that because of

2065
01:11:43,040 --> 01:11:48,880
because of the quality and

2066
01:11:46,159 --> 01:11:51,199
efficiency that art that i made earlier

2067
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:52,480
and so uh but you know things like this

2068
01:11:51,199 --> 01:11:54,000
that we always that we always tend to

2069
01:11:52,480 --> 01:11:55,520
forget we have these discussions that we

2070
01:11:54,000 --> 01:11:57,679
need to also try to figure out to create

2071
01:11:55,520 --> 01:11:59,280
incentives for our youth to be involved

2072
01:11:57,679 --> 01:12:01,199
you know our youth to be involved it'd

2073
01:11:59,280 --> 01:12:03,520
be my my blessing if i were to take

2074
01:12:01,199 --> 01:12:05,199
hopeicorn and give everybody one colonel

2075
01:12:03,520 --> 01:12:06,480
and all the kids in the united states

2076
01:12:05,199 --> 01:12:08,480
and have give them a cup and have them

2077
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:09,840
grow a corn plant out of that

2078
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:11,280
you know that that kind of thing and

2079
01:12:09,840 --> 01:12:12,719
showing why it's important because we

2080
01:12:11,280 --> 01:12:14,159
can all talk about that's the other

2081
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:15,679
thing we can all talk about regenerative

2082
01:12:14,159 --> 01:12:17,520
agriculture we can all do regenerative

2083
01:12:15,679 --> 01:12:19,520
agriculture but we really need to

2084
01:12:17,520 --> 01:12:20,880
understand the principles of why we need

2085
01:12:19,520 --> 01:12:22,480
to do this

2086
01:12:20,880 --> 01:12:24,080
you know it's like it hope you know we

2087
01:12:22,480 --> 01:12:25,840
can all plan out there but unless our

2088
01:12:24,080 --> 01:12:27,840
youth know why they're planting it just

2089
01:12:25,840 --> 01:12:29,520
becomes another commodity another way of

2090
01:12:27,840 --> 01:12:31,520
doing things and so we have to

2091
01:12:29,520 --> 01:12:33,360
incentivize our young people to do this

2092
01:12:31,520 --> 01:12:34,960
and that means also involving some of

2093
01:12:33,360 --> 01:12:37,040
these big meetings that we have you know

2094
01:12:34,960 --> 01:12:39,520
because i think the youth are our future

2095
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:41,679
right i mean i was lucky to have 42 of

2096
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:43,040
our of our k through 5 5th graders come

2097
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,159
and visit my little farm out there

2098
01:12:43,040 --> 01:12:45,760
recently

2099
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:48,080
and so there's nothing better than

2100
01:12:45,760 --> 01:12:49,520
watching a little kid just get happy and

2101
01:12:48,080 --> 01:12:50,719
you know you can tell little kids you

2102
01:12:49,520 --> 01:12:52,239
know like

2103
01:12:50,719 --> 01:12:53,600
my way of teaching is like you know you

2104
01:12:52,239 --> 01:12:55,600
can go out there and be complaining well

2105
01:12:53,600 --> 01:12:56,960
you can be a hydrologist you can be a

2106
01:12:55,600 --> 01:12:58,239
botanist you can because we do

2107
01:12:56,960 --> 01:12:59,679
everything when it comes to holistic

2108
01:12:58,239 --> 01:13:02,000
management of agriculture that's what we

2109
01:12:59,679 --> 01:13:04,000
do we incentivize that we incentivize it

2110
01:13:02,000 --> 01:13:05,760
based upon our own culture and what they

2111
01:13:04,000 --> 01:13:07,920
what they should learn in the future and

2112
01:13:05,760 --> 01:13:09,600
what keeps them hoping you know and so

2113
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:10,960
but that could be passed along everybody

2114
01:13:09,600 --> 01:13:12,400
it's just like your grandfather talking

2115
01:13:10,960 --> 01:13:14,640
to you and talking about how important

2116
01:13:12,400 --> 01:13:16,000
farming is and things like that so

2117
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:17,679
just at a little different level there

2118
01:13:16,000 --> 01:13:19,280
but that's how kind of how i kind of

2119
01:13:17,679 --> 01:13:21,679
understand that and federal programs are

2120
01:13:19,280 --> 01:13:22,960
geared right now towards corporations

2121
01:13:21,679 --> 01:13:24,320
and everything else we need to put it

2122
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:25,679
right back to where it belongs right

2123
01:13:24,320 --> 01:13:28,000
locally lit that's been talked about

2124
01:13:25,679 --> 01:13:30,320
here a number of times we can do that

2125
01:13:28,000 --> 01:13:31,920
you know we also understand as consumers

2126
01:13:30,320 --> 01:13:33,040
we need to think about the crops and

2127
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:35,760
stuff that we're buying because

2128
01:13:33,040 --> 01:13:38,080
consumers what you buy makes makes the

2129
01:13:35,760 --> 01:13:39,840
wheel run right and so we need to think

2130
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:42,320
about that a little bit more so yeah

2131
01:13:39,840 --> 01:13:45,360
that's about it

2132
01:13:42,320 --> 01:13:46,400
yeah i'd love to i look back on um on

2133
01:13:45,360 --> 01:13:47,920
that because

2134
01:13:46,400 --> 01:13:51,040
you said something about the youth and

2135
01:13:47,920 --> 01:13:52,560
that like is just so close to um to my

2136
01:13:51,040 --> 01:13:54,320
heart because obviously as first

2137
01:13:52,560 --> 01:13:56,480
generation ranchers and somebody trying

2138
01:13:54,320 --> 01:13:58,400
to get into this industry it's it's

2139
01:13:56,480 --> 01:14:00,320
certainly been a challenge and i get

2140
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:01,920
asked that question a lot is like okay

2141
01:14:00,320 --> 01:14:02,960
so how do we get the next generation

2142
01:14:01,920 --> 01:14:05,920
involved

2143
01:14:02,960 --> 01:14:08,000
and the average rancher i think is 65

2144
01:14:05,920 --> 01:14:10,159
years old and doesn't have any intention

2145
01:14:08,000 --> 01:14:12,320
of passing the land off he'd rather sell

2146
01:14:10,159 --> 01:14:15,679
it and retire in fiji than you know

2147
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:18,000
continue to labor on and um

2148
01:14:15,679 --> 01:14:21,520
you know the the barrier that we always

2149
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:23,199
run into is the access to secure land to

2150
01:14:21,520 --> 01:14:25,040
land that we know if we start putting in

2151
01:14:23,199 --> 01:14:26,640
a bunch of infrastructure and a bunch of

2152
01:14:25,040 --> 01:14:30,320
hard work sweat and tears that it's

2153
01:14:26,640 --> 01:14:33,199
going to be around um you know 7 15 you

2154
01:14:30,320 --> 01:14:34,800
know years um and so

2155
01:14:33,199 --> 01:14:36,080
you know when i think about what kind of

2156
01:14:34,800 --> 01:14:37,920
policies

2157
01:14:36,080 --> 01:14:40,560
maybe um

2158
01:14:37,920 --> 01:14:43,360
harm that you know the the re in the

2159
01:14:40,560 --> 01:14:46,080
conservation bucket of the farm bill

2160
01:14:43,360 --> 01:14:48,560
there's these retired lands um there's

2161
01:14:46,080 --> 01:14:51,120
also just a bunch of land that that is

2162
01:14:48,560 --> 01:14:53,600
used that's owned uh by the government

2163
01:14:51,120 --> 01:14:54,640
and is used for conventional farming and

2164
01:14:53,600 --> 01:14:56,480
ranching

2165
01:14:54,640 --> 01:14:58,000
and i think it'd be you know really

2166
01:14:56,480 --> 01:14:59,760
interesting to look at what what if we

2167
01:14:58,000 --> 01:15:02,800
use some of those retired lands or

2168
01:14:59,760 --> 01:15:04,800
incentivized um wealthy land owners

2169
01:15:02,800 --> 01:15:07,360
instead to give you know favorable

2170
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:09,440
leases or subsidized leases to beginning

2171
01:15:07,360 --> 01:15:11,760
farmers and ranchers because

2172
01:15:09,440 --> 01:15:14,239
getting into ranching is nearly

2173
01:15:11,760 --> 01:15:17,040
impossible if you have to pay mortgage

2174
01:15:14,239 --> 01:15:19,600
on bear land um you know you need 40

2175
01:15:17,040 --> 01:15:22,640
down on bear land and there's just no

2176
01:15:19,600 --> 01:15:25,040
way in my lifetime that i could afford

2177
01:15:22,640 --> 01:15:26,960
the cost of land to pay for that

2178
01:15:25,040 --> 01:15:29,520
operation um

2179
01:15:26,960 --> 01:15:31,520
using animals and so

2180
01:15:29,520 --> 01:15:33,360
we've had to be really creative about

2181
01:15:31,520 --> 01:15:35,440
how we grow and that's always been

2182
01:15:33,360 --> 01:15:37,040
through through land leases and with

2183
01:15:35,440 --> 01:15:38,560
bison that's a whole new challenge which

2184
01:15:37,040 --> 01:15:41,040
i don't have to dive into but

2185
01:15:38,560 --> 01:15:43,360
essentially i can only you know go

2186
01:15:41,040 --> 01:15:45,520
work with private land owners and the

2187
01:15:43,360 --> 01:15:47,280
infrastructure needed to

2188
01:15:45,520 --> 01:15:49,600
support bison is

2189
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:52,880
much different than it is for cattle so

2190
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:55,199
um just making you know access to

2191
01:15:52,880 --> 01:15:56,800
this land and finding creative solutions

2192
01:15:55,199 --> 01:15:59,679
to get the younger generation involved

2193
01:15:56,800 --> 01:16:02,080
because many times they don't have land

2194
01:15:59,679 --> 01:16:02,080
already

2195
01:16:03,280 --> 01:16:07,679
yeah um

2196
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:09,920
i like the question because i think what

2197
01:16:07,679 --> 01:16:12,239
you're learning from the other panelists

2198
01:16:09,920 --> 01:16:13,440
is that this the ways that federal

2199
01:16:12,239 --> 01:16:15,280
policy

2200
01:16:13,440 --> 01:16:18,239
currently discourages regenerative

2201
01:16:15,280 --> 01:16:21,040
agriculture if flipped can encourage

2202
01:16:18,239 --> 01:16:23,360
regenerative agriculture um i'm thinking

2203
01:16:21,040 --> 01:16:25,120
of you know chris mentioned alfred

2204
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,800
mentioned this um the federal crop

2205
01:16:25,120 --> 01:16:27,760
insurance program right the way that our

2206
01:16:26,800 --> 01:16:30,080
current

2207
01:16:27,760 --> 01:16:32,080
subsidy regime favors

2208
01:16:30,080 --> 01:16:34,000
um farms that

2209
01:16:32,080 --> 01:16:36,880
degrade soil health or that are not

2210
01:16:34,000 --> 01:16:38,400
practicing regenerative agriculture um

2211
01:16:36,880 --> 01:16:39,920
the federal crop insurance program

2212
01:16:38,400 --> 01:16:42,719
covers 90

2213
01:16:39,920 --> 01:16:45,199
of the u.s the united states's cropland

2214
01:16:42,719 --> 01:16:47,040
which means it has enormous potential

2215
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:49,040
and influence over

2216
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:50,880
agricultural the agricultural landscape

2217
01:16:49,040 --> 01:16:53,120
and agricultural policy

2218
01:16:50,880 --> 01:16:56,239
so i'm thinking about you know if we can

2219
01:16:53,120 --> 01:16:58,800
shift those farm subsidies um shift the

2220
01:16:56,239 --> 01:17:00,480
federal crop insurance program so that

2221
01:16:58,800 --> 01:17:03,199
the money that's currently being spent

2222
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:04,480
on it chris what did you say like 77.9

2223
01:17:03,199 --> 01:17:07,360
billion or something like that over the

2224
01:17:04,480 --> 01:17:09,280
next 10 years if we can change the way

2225
01:17:07,360 --> 01:17:11,280
that the crop insurance program

2226
01:17:09,280 --> 01:17:13,920
currently works to

2227
01:17:11,280 --> 01:17:16,960
encouraging soil health and regenerative

2228
01:17:13,920 --> 01:17:19,040
agriculture to rewarding growers for

2229
01:17:16,960 --> 01:17:20,159
adopting a more regenerative mindset i

2230
01:17:19,040 --> 01:17:23,520
mean that's

2231
01:17:20,159 --> 01:17:24,960
that seems like a win-win-win

2232
01:17:23,520 --> 01:17:26,960
great thanks for that that's really

2233
01:17:24,960 --> 01:17:28,800
interesting um and i think you were the

2234
01:17:26,960 --> 01:17:30,320
one who said it in your presentation all

2235
01:17:28,800 --> 01:17:32,080
of this stuff works together it works

2236
01:17:30,320 --> 01:17:33,760
better when it works together so

2237
01:17:32,080 --> 01:17:35,280
appreciate that answer

2238
01:17:33,760 --> 01:17:38,560
um michael i'd like to ask you might

2239
01:17:35,280 --> 01:17:41,360
steal that little quick i like that

2240
01:17:38,560 --> 01:17:43,040
you're still whatever absolutely um

2241
01:17:41,360 --> 01:17:45,520
what matters is more regenerative

2242
01:17:43,040 --> 01:17:46,880
agriculture so whatever it takes um

2243
01:17:45,520 --> 01:17:49,679
michael i'd like to start with you for

2244
01:17:46,880 --> 01:17:52,080
this next question um

2245
01:17:49,679 --> 01:17:52,800
uh you mentioned sort of how long

2246
01:17:52,080 --> 01:17:54,960
your

2247
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:56,960
family has been on the land it's kind of

2248
01:17:54,960 --> 01:17:59,120
amazing and so i'm kind of hopeful that

2249
01:17:56,960 --> 01:18:02,719
you have sort of a long-term perspective

2250
01:17:59,120 --> 01:18:05,920
on this how do climate impacts like

2251
01:18:02,719 --> 01:18:07,840
shifting seasons extreme heat drought

2252
01:18:05,920 --> 01:18:10,239
how do those climate impacts affect

2253
01:18:07,840 --> 01:18:13,840
regenerative agriculture differently

2254
01:18:10,239 --> 01:18:13,840
than maybe industrial agriculture

2255
01:18:14,800 --> 01:18:18,560
well the climate impacts to me would be

2256
01:18:16,560 --> 01:18:20,239
less severe on regenerative agriculture

2257
01:18:18,560 --> 01:18:22,239
if and only if the crops that they're

2258
01:18:20,239 --> 01:18:24,159
raising are biodiverse

2259
01:18:22,239 --> 01:18:26,159
you know um that that's that's the big

2260
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:28,000
thing you know unfortunately uh we're

2261
01:18:26,159 --> 01:18:29,760
not moving we have not been moving that

2262
01:18:28,000 --> 01:18:32,000
way for the last 50 or so years we've

2263
01:18:29,760 --> 01:18:33,520
been always mono cropping and so when

2264
01:18:32,000 --> 01:18:35,840
you have one thing that hurts it you

2265
01:18:33,520 --> 01:18:37,199
know like for example like drought or

2266
01:18:35,840 --> 01:18:39,199
too much water

2267
01:18:37,199 --> 01:18:41,840
you wind up wiping up that whole crop so

2268
01:18:39,199 --> 01:18:42,719
there's no diversification whereas hopi

2269
01:18:41,840 --> 01:18:44,480
you know

2270
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:46,480
we they're all the whole things that are

2271
01:18:44,480 --> 01:18:48,480
biodiverse it's not even corn it's not a

2272
01:18:46,480 --> 01:18:51,440
monocrop it comes up at different times

2273
01:18:48,480 --> 01:18:53,040
different years uh things like that it

2274
01:18:51,440 --> 01:18:53,920
sometimes doesn't look palatable but you

2275
01:18:53,040 --> 01:18:55,360
know

2276
01:18:53,920 --> 01:18:56,800
it's at least we know what we're eating

2277
01:18:55,360 --> 01:18:57,600
you know i think that's the important

2278
01:18:56,800 --> 01:18:59,040
thing

2279
01:18:57,600 --> 01:19:00,800
and so uh but with the climate

2280
01:18:59,040 --> 01:19:02,400
fluctuations you can see you know that

2281
01:19:00,800 --> 01:19:04,640
things are getting smaller and so i'm a

2282
01:19:02,400 --> 01:19:06,880
person who talks about biodiversity is

2283
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:08,239
to try to raise something every year

2284
01:19:06,880 --> 01:19:09,760
we're able to look at through our

2285
01:19:08,239 --> 01:19:11,840
knowledge just look at just the the

2286
01:19:09,760 --> 01:19:13,280
different biology the bio of logical

2287
01:19:11,840 --> 01:19:14,480
indicators like the different types of

2288
01:19:13,280 --> 01:19:16,159
plants to figure out we're going to have

2289
01:19:14,480 --> 01:19:18,400
a drought or not but regardless of what

2290
01:19:16,159 --> 01:19:20,480
we see we plan anyway because you know i

2291
01:19:18,400 --> 01:19:22,080
i i like seed banks and stuff like that

2292
01:19:20,480 --> 01:19:23,440
but i guarantee that if you take a seat

2293
01:19:22,080 --> 01:19:25,120
that's been sitting in a sea bank for

2294
01:19:23,440 --> 01:19:27,120
100 years if you try growing in today's

2295
01:19:25,120 --> 01:19:28,800
climate it's not going to do well

2296
01:19:27,120 --> 01:19:30,400
and so we need to think about that so

2297
01:19:28,800 --> 01:19:31,679
the biodiversity that we have things

2298
01:19:30,400 --> 01:19:33,360
that you have you know when you look at

2299
01:19:31,679 --> 01:19:34,960
cattle if you i mean the bison when you

2300
01:19:33,360 --> 01:19:36,640
look at their range and how they raise

2301
01:19:34,960 --> 01:19:38,560
their range and you look at all the

2302
01:19:36,640 --> 01:19:40,159
ecological stuff that's under there it's

2303
01:19:38,560 --> 01:19:42,239
it's very it's very good for the

2304
01:19:40,159 --> 01:19:44,239
environment you know very good for that

2305
01:19:42,239 --> 01:19:46,000
and so uh but i really think the

2306
01:19:44,239 --> 01:19:47,920
biodiversity crops needs to be pushed

2307
01:19:46,000 --> 01:19:49,440
forward further you know and and where

2308
01:19:47,920 --> 01:19:50,320
those biodiversity is gonna come from

2309
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:52,560
they're just going to come from

2310
01:19:50,320 --> 01:19:54,000
indigenous people i know that and so we

2311
01:19:52,560 --> 01:19:56,560
need to also have laws and rules and

2312
01:19:54,000 --> 01:19:58,080
regulations in our in our books set up

2313
01:19:56,560 --> 01:20:00,000
data centers that i believe that would

2314
01:19:58,080 --> 01:20:02,400
help us preserve some of that because if

2315
01:20:00,000 --> 01:20:03,679
you look at corn billion dollar industry

2316
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:05,840
where did that come from you know it

2317
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:08,320
came from indigenous people originally

2318
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:10,320
and so uh we have the diverse crops we

2319
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:11,840
have them we have the seeds available

2320
01:20:10,320 --> 01:20:13,440
it's just a matter of how we're able to

2321
01:20:11,840 --> 01:20:15,360
use those not really protect that but

2322
01:20:13,440 --> 01:20:16,800
also create deterrence uh that would

2323
01:20:15,360 --> 01:20:18,080
allow us to keep moving because if you

2324
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:20,159
really look at that we're holding 80

2325
01:20:18,080 --> 01:20:21,920
percent of biodiversity so listen to

2326
01:20:20,159 --> 01:20:23,760
this people we need to support

2327
01:20:21,920 --> 01:20:25,199
indigenous locally led efforts small

2328
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:27,199
grassroot efforts who are still doing

2329
01:20:25,199 --> 01:20:29,360
this because if not we're going to lose

2330
01:20:27,199 --> 01:20:30,800
that and once we lose that without true

2331
01:20:29,360 --> 01:20:32,320
biodiversity we have no real

2332
01:20:30,800 --> 01:20:33,760
sustainability

2333
01:20:32,320 --> 01:20:35,360
and so just think about that one but

2334
01:20:33,760 --> 01:20:36,560
that's how i answer that question but

2335
01:20:35,360 --> 01:20:38,800
thanks

2336
01:20:36,560 --> 01:20:40,880
hmm interesting chris love to hear from

2337
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:43,120
you what are your thoughts on sort of

2338
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:44,400
how these how climate impacts might

2339
01:20:43,120 --> 01:20:47,360
affect regenerative agriculture

2340
01:20:44,400 --> 01:20:49,280
differently than industrial agriculture

2341
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:50,880
well i certainly think that regenerative

2342
01:20:49,280 --> 01:20:52,080
agriculture is going to be more

2343
01:20:50,880 --> 01:20:53,840
resilient

2344
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,560
it's going to be able to weather the

2345
01:20:53,840 --> 01:20:59,440
storm no pun intended

2346
01:20:56,560 --> 01:21:01,199
you know through through climate changes

2347
01:20:59,440 --> 01:21:02,960
climate impacts

2348
01:21:01,199 --> 01:21:04,400
but as i mentioned in my opening you

2349
01:21:02,960 --> 01:21:07,360
know it doesn't come up without

2350
01:21:04,400 --> 01:21:09,440
challenges as well you know it's still

2351
01:21:07,360 --> 01:21:10,880
you know fewer favorable planting days

2352
01:21:09,440 --> 01:21:13,360
and just

2353
01:21:10,880 --> 01:21:15,360
changing in the seasons it makes it

2354
01:21:13,360 --> 01:21:18,400
a lot more challenging to to plant

2355
01:21:15,360 --> 01:21:20,800
multiple crops in a year to to get

2356
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:23,440
planting done in a timely manner to to

2357
01:21:20,800 --> 01:21:26,480
get harvest done in a timely manner so i

2358
01:21:23,440 --> 01:21:29,360
think we continue to have to adapt and

2359
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:31,600
and and learn from from what's working

2360
01:21:29,360 --> 01:21:33,120
and what isn't and and i think you know

2361
01:21:31,600 --> 01:21:34,719
as michael mentioned the the crop

2362
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:36,719
diversification

2363
01:21:34,719 --> 01:21:38,400
is such a big piece to this so we have

2364
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:40,080
to figure out how we can develop new

2365
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:42,320
markets for crops

2366
01:21:40,080 --> 01:21:45,040
uh that can be grown you know on a on a

2367
01:21:42,320 --> 01:21:45,040
larger scale

2368
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:50,400
brittany are he interested in your

2369
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:52,960
thoughts as well

2370
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:55,040
yeah i mean so we've definitely been

2371
01:21:52,960 --> 01:21:57,280
able to withstand you know we've had

2372
01:21:55,040 --> 01:21:59,120
terrible droughts the last few years as

2373
01:21:57,280 --> 01:22:01,679
senator tester mentioned

2374
01:21:59,120 --> 01:22:04,239
and while we've been able on our ranch

2375
01:22:01,679 --> 01:22:06,000
to get by with the forage that we that

2376
01:22:04,239 --> 01:22:07,840
we have because we're building more

2377
01:22:06,000 --> 01:22:10,239
forage every year

2378
01:22:07,840 --> 01:22:12,080
there's downstream impacts so what

2379
01:22:10,239 --> 01:22:14,639
happened was

2380
01:22:12,080 --> 01:22:16,960
a lot of people couldn't afford to buy

2381
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:18,800
the hay to feed their animals so

2382
01:22:16,960 --> 01:22:20,320
slaughter houses got backed up so

2383
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,600
everybody was sending their animals to

2384
01:22:20,320 --> 01:22:24,159
processing otherwise they were just

2385
01:22:21,600 --> 01:22:25,040
simply going to starve on on the ranch

2386
01:22:24,159 --> 01:22:25,840
and so

2387
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:27,199
then

2388
01:22:25,840 --> 01:22:29,440
you know the bottleneck became

2389
01:22:27,199 --> 01:22:31,440
processing um

2390
01:22:29,440 --> 01:22:33,840
which we're finally getting through now

2391
01:22:31,440 --> 01:22:35,600
but because people were basically

2392
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:37,840
slaughtering their replacement heifers

2393
01:22:35,600 --> 01:22:39,840
and their replacement livestock now

2394
01:22:37,840 --> 01:22:40,960
there's a shortage of animals on the

2395
01:22:39,840 --> 01:22:42,400
market

2396
01:22:40,960 --> 01:22:45,520
and so there's all these unintended

2397
01:22:42,400 --> 01:22:47,280
consequences down you know downstream

2398
01:22:45,520 --> 01:22:50,159
that just because we're a regenerative

2399
01:22:47,280 --> 01:22:52,400
ranch we're not um you know we're not

2400
01:22:50,159 --> 01:22:54,560
protected by that by any means and so

2401
01:22:52,400 --> 01:22:58,000
the infrastructure really is is such a

2402
01:22:54,560 --> 01:22:59,600
big deal to have more capacity um so

2403
01:22:58,000 --> 01:23:03,960
that we don't get you know jammed up

2404
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:03,960
like like we are right now

2405
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:11,520
i think the three panelists nailed it um

2406
01:23:08,960 --> 01:23:14,400
we had there's one interviewee that that

2407
01:23:11,520 --> 01:23:16,080
sticks out in my mind who said something

2408
01:23:14,400 --> 01:23:19,040
really profound for me

2409
01:23:16,080 --> 01:23:21,120
and she said that healthy soil is their

2410
01:23:19,040 --> 01:23:23,840
insurance policy against risk and

2411
01:23:21,120 --> 01:23:25,360
climate change and so i think about that

2412
01:23:23,840 --> 01:23:27,280
quite a lot when

2413
01:23:25,360 --> 01:23:29,280
asked this question about regenerative

2414
01:23:27,280 --> 01:23:31,600
ag's potential to

2415
01:23:29,280 --> 01:23:33,679
um be more resilient to climate change

2416
01:23:31,600 --> 01:23:35,840
than others i mean the fact that healthy

2417
01:23:33,679 --> 01:23:38,960
soil holds onto

2418
01:23:35,840 --> 01:23:40,080
more water than unhealthy soil is a

2419
01:23:38,960 --> 01:23:42,639
direct

2420
01:23:40,080 --> 01:23:44,560
resilient a measure of resilience for

2421
01:23:42,639 --> 01:23:46,080
those extreme weather events for those

2422
01:23:44,560 --> 01:23:47,440
drought events

2423
01:23:46,080 --> 01:23:50,080
um

2424
01:23:47,440 --> 01:23:52,159
so yeah i and and what dr johnson said

2425
01:23:50,080 --> 01:23:54,880
about diversification came up really

2426
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:57,920
frequently in our interviews that they

2427
01:23:54,880 --> 01:23:59,600
by adopting crop diversity by build

2428
01:23:57,920 --> 01:24:01,440
stacking these enterprises like what

2429
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:03,280
brittany mentioned um on their

2430
01:24:01,440 --> 01:24:05,280
regenerative operation they were better

2431
01:24:03,280 --> 01:24:07,760
able to withstand

2432
01:24:05,280 --> 01:24:09,440
external market volatilities because

2433
01:24:07,760 --> 01:24:11,520
they had these different income streams

2434
01:24:09,440 --> 01:24:15,199
from a bunch of different products and

2435
01:24:11,520 --> 01:24:15,199
value-added products on top of that

2436
01:24:15,280 --> 01:24:19,920
well that leads me to sort of i think we

2437
01:24:17,360 --> 01:24:21,760
have time for maybe one last one and

2438
01:24:19,920 --> 01:24:24,000
brittany probably makes sense to direct

2439
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:26,400
this one to you first i'm curious about

2440
01:24:24,000 --> 01:24:28,000
the idea of developing markets for

2441
01:24:26,400 --> 01:24:29,840
products that come out of regenerative

2442
01:24:28,000 --> 01:24:32,239
agriculture and you talked a little bit

2443
01:24:29,840 --> 01:24:33,600
about the consumer's perspective

2444
01:24:32,239 --> 01:24:34,960
and i would love to hear brittany and

2445
01:24:33,600 --> 01:24:37,199
then we'll we can go through the rest of

2446
01:24:34,960 --> 01:24:39,920
the panel maybe some final thoughts on

2447
01:24:37,199 --> 01:24:41,280
you know how we create demand uh and

2448
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:43,760
markets for

2449
01:24:41,280 --> 01:24:45,840
um things like bison bites

2450
01:24:43,760 --> 01:24:45,840
yeah

2451
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:49,360
yeah i mean you know so

2452
01:24:48,560 --> 01:24:52,400
we

2453
01:24:49,360 --> 01:24:55,920
we created a product to save the ranch

2454
01:24:52,400 --> 01:24:57,600
that's the true story um you know i i've

2455
01:24:55,920 --> 01:25:00,400
always had a passion for nutrition and

2456
01:24:57,600 --> 01:25:01,920
for food um if john had it his weight we

2457
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,440
would just be raising animals and we

2458
01:25:01,920 --> 01:25:07,040
wouldn't have to deal with all the other

2459
01:25:03,440 --> 01:25:09,199
parts of the business but it's it's um

2460
01:25:07,040 --> 01:25:11,199
it's sort of um

2461
01:25:09,199 --> 01:25:13,120
it works together when you're out there

2462
01:25:11,199 --> 01:25:14,480
talking to customers when you're

2463
01:25:13,120 --> 01:25:17,120
promoting your product when you have a

2464
01:25:14,480 --> 01:25:19,760
brand when you have a customer

2465
01:25:17,120 --> 01:25:23,199
facing product and you can reach them

2466
01:25:19,760 --> 01:25:26,880
you just have more ability to

2467
01:25:23,199 --> 01:25:28,239
to support the ranch and and the the um

2468
01:25:26,880 --> 01:25:30,800
entities that are closest to the

2469
01:25:28,239 --> 01:25:33,040
customer end up being the ones who

2470
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:35,920
receive the most value from the value

2471
01:25:33,040 --> 01:25:38,719
stream so whereas traditionally um you

2472
01:25:35,920 --> 01:25:41,040
know it's those branded programs or it's

2473
01:25:38,719 --> 01:25:43,760
the big multinational corporations that

2474
01:25:41,040 --> 01:25:45,440
own the shelf space if you can get in

2475
01:25:43,760 --> 01:25:47,920
and actually have access to that

2476
01:25:45,440 --> 01:25:49,600
customer which of course you know um you

2477
01:25:47,920 --> 01:25:51,679
know the internet and

2478
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:54,480
amazon and everything has given us more

2479
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:56,560
access to them you can you can start to

2480
01:25:54,480 --> 01:25:58,560
extract more of the value

2481
01:25:56,560 --> 01:26:02,239
from every animal you produce or every

2482
01:25:58,560 --> 01:26:04,000
crop you know you raise and so um but it

2483
01:26:02,239 --> 01:26:06,480
but it's not easy right i mean i've i've

2484
01:26:04,000 --> 01:26:08,400
spent before this ten years in brand

2485
01:26:06,480 --> 01:26:10,960
marketing developing products and brands

2486
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:12,639
and and working on it and so i think

2487
01:26:10,960 --> 01:26:14,400
it's it is a

2488
01:26:12,639 --> 01:26:16,000
it's a tool that we have

2489
01:26:14,400 --> 01:26:17,440
and i think you know the value added

2490
01:26:16,000 --> 01:26:20,880
producer grant

2491
01:26:17,440 --> 01:26:22,239
is is fabulous at helping producers come

2492
01:26:20,880 --> 01:26:24,000
out with a product but i don't think

2493
01:26:22,239 --> 01:26:24,800
it's the solution for everyone i don't

2494
01:26:24,000 --> 01:26:27,679
think

2495
01:26:24,800 --> 01:26:30,320
that it's realistic to ask producers

2496
01:26:27,679 --> 01:26:32,880
that are already running a full-time

2497
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:34,880
you know 80 hour per week job to say and

2498
01:26:32,880 --> 01:26:37,600
can you just maybe add a product to the

2499
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:40,159
to the list um i think it's it's right

2500
01:26:37,600 --> 01:26:44,320
for some ranches but but certainly it's

2501
01:26:40,159 --> 01:26:44,320
um beyond the expectation for everyone

2502
01:26:44,480 --> 01:26:47,840
and other panelists

2503
01:26:46,080 --> 01:26:49,679
thoughts final thoughts on sort of how

2504
01:26:47,840 --> 01:26:51,840
we create markets for products that come

2505
01:26:49,679 --> 01:26:53,760
from regenerative agriculture

2506
01:26:51,840 --> 01:26:55,600
well to me it's really about telling

2507
01:26:53,760 --> 01:26:56,639
stories you know for indian people you

2508
01:26:55,600 --> 01:26:58,159
know

2509
01:26:56,639 --> 01:26:59,440
we just need to tell stories about the

2510
01:26:58,159 --> 01:27:01,440
good things we're doing out there but

2511
01:26:59,440 --> 01:27:03,040
when it comes to things like i've seen i

2512
01:27:01,440 --> 01:27:04,719
know a person in italy's bill of

2513
01:27:03,040 --> 01:27:06,080
software so when you has a code on it

2514
01:27:04,719 --> 01:27:07,679
just like you know with our phones we

2515
01:27:06,080 --> 01:27:09,679
look at the code and that takes you to a

2516
01:27:07,679 --> 01:27:10,960
story of how that product was developed

2517
01:27:09,679 --> 01:27:13,280
now wouldn't that be something if you

2518
01:27:10,960 --> 01:27:14,639
had you know like a buffalo product and

2519
01:27:13,280 --> 01:27:16,639
you've seen how that that thing was

2520
01:27:14,639 --> 01:27:18,400
raised what it looked like you know the

2521
01:27:16,639 --> 01:27:20,560
buy-in would be overwhelming as far as

2522
01:27:18,400 --> 01:27:22,000
i'm concerned not just to do that

2523
01:27:20,560 --> 01:27:24,000
and then but i don't know if that's

2524
01:27:22,000 --> 01:27:25,679
possible but anyways i thought that'd be

2525
01:27:24,000 --> 01:27:27,520
a good thing to do uh just putting the

2526
01:27:25,679 --> 01:27:29,679
story the value-addedness i think is

2527
01:27:27,520 --> 01:27:31,520
also important because uh the supply

2528
01:27:29,679 --> 01:27:33,920
chain people have control over that you

2529
01:27:31,520 --> 01:27:35,280
know this 100 bushel acres still a

2530
01:27:33,920 --> 01:27:37,360
hundred dollar bush in lakewood from 30

2531
01:27:35,280 --> 01:27:39,520
years ago from understand you know so

2532
01:27:37,360 --> 01:27:41,120
the the person has minimal amount of

2533
01:27:39,520 --> 01:27:43,440
room to to do that as far as the

2534
01:27:41,120 --> 01:27:45,520
producer is concerned and so value-added

2535
01:27:43,440 --> 01:27:46,880
needs to be important now when you but

2536
01:27:45,520 --> 01:27:48,080
if you do have these codes on there that

2537
01:27:46,880 --> 01:27:49,520
show where these which products are

2538
01:27:48,080 --> 01:27:51,520
formed what do you think people are

2539
01:27:49,520 --> 01:27:53,600
going to buy you know but we also

2540
01:27:51,520 --> 01:27:56,080
remember to make those more accessible

2541
01:27:53,600 --> 01:27:58,800
there is no whole foods or no you know

2542
01:27:56,080 --> 01:28:00,800
these these these upscale uh grocery

2543
01:27:58,800 --> 01:28:02,080
stores on indian reservations at all and

2544
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:04,320
so we need to figure out a way to bring

2545
01:28:02,080 --> 01:28:05,840
equity as we do this so as we're as our

2546
01:28:04,320 --> 01:28:07,840
as we're also you know put the market

2547
01:28:05,840 --> 01:28:09,920
out there we also remember you know how

2548
01:28:07,840 --> 01:28:11,280
to create equity at the same time so

2549
01:28:09,920 --> 01:28:13,199
that's how i would kind of do that it's

2550
01:28:11,280 --> 01:28:15,280
just how the story of regenerative and

2551
01:28:13,199 --> 01:28:18,159
what it's about there's just not enough

2552
01:28:15,280 --> 01:28:21,520
uh publicity on that and so i think we

2553
01:28:18,159 --> 01:28:23,440
should increase the publicity so yeah

2554
01:28:21,520 --> 01:28:25,199
chris and then we can give aruhi you can

2555
01:28:23,440 --> 01:28:28,480
have the last word today but chris final

2556
01:28:25,199 --> 01:28:29,920
thoughts on market development

2557
01:28:28,480 --> 01:28:31,679
yeah i think it's uh you know it's a

2558
01:28:29,920 --> 01:28:33,520
huge challenge especially you know

2559
01:28:31,679 --> 01:28:35,120
looking you know

2560
01:28:33,520 --> 01:28:38,080
here in the midwest where there's

2561
01:28:35,120 --> 01:28:40,960
millions of acres of uh you know

2562
01:28:38,080 --> 01:28:43,520
commodity crops being grown and and just

2563
01:28:40,960 --> 01:28:45,360
trying to trying to build that um you

2564
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:47,120
know consumer demand

2565
01:28:45,360 --> 01:28:50,239
um but there's just there's so many

2566
01:28:47,120 --> 01:28:52,000
acres that um that are ripe for more

2567
01:28:50,239 --> 01:28:54,239
crop diversification

2568
01:28:52,000 --> 01:28:56,719
um but but farmers have to have a place

2569
01:28:54,239 --> 01:28:57,840
to to market that crop and um you know

2570
01:28:56,719 --> 01:28:59,520
we've seen

2571
01:28:57,840 --> 01:29:01,280
you know a huge shift in all of the

2572
01:28:59,520 --> 01:29:02,719
infrastructure that's that's here that's

2573
01:29:01,280 --> 01:29:05,840
supporting those crops that we're

2574
01:29:02,719 --> 01:29:11,080
growing today and so it's it's it's

2575
01:29:05,840 --> 01:29:11,080
going to take a lot to change that

2576
01:29:12,159 --> 01:29:15,600
okay now i'll

2577
01:29:13,600 --> 01:29:17,520
end with this um so one of my favorite

2578
01:29:15,600 --> 01:29:19,760
quotes from wendell berry is eating is

2579
01:29:17,520 --> 01:29:22,239
an agricultural act

2580
01:29:19,760 --> 01:29:24,159
and to me that is a call to action both

2581
01:29:22,239 --> 01:29:26,400
from the grass tops level and the

2582
01:29:24,159 --> 01:29:29,760
grassroots level everyone eats

2583
01:29:26,400 --> 01:29:31,120
everyone can participate in changing the

2584
01:29:29,760 --> 01:29:33,280
food system

2585
01:29:31,120 --> 01:29:35,600
from the grass top side the way i see

2586
01:29:33,280 --> 01:29:37,280
markets working is through policy

2587
01:29:35,600 --> 01:29:38,960
thinking about procurement changes in

2588
01:29:37,280 --> 01:29:40,239
procurement policies and procurement

2589
01:29:38,960 --> 01:29:42,080
guidelines we have a whole section about

2590
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:44,719
that in our report but from the

2591
01:29:42,080 --> 01:29:47,120
grassroots side on the consumer side dr

2592
01:29:44,719 --> 01:29:49,360
johnson is totally correct i love this

2593
01:29:47,120 --> 01:29:51,600
anecdote of telling stories of

2594
01:29:49,360 --> 01:29:53,760
getting consumers to feel connected and

2595
01:29:51,600 --> 01:29:55,280
bought in with the folks who are growing

2596
01:29:53,760 --> 01:29:57,600
the food that they eat and raising their

2597
01:29:55,280 --> 01:30:00,239
kids on um

2598
01:29:57,600 --> 01:30:01,520
consumers can vote very loudly with

2599
01:30:00,239 --> 01:30:03,840
their dollars

2600
01:30:01,520 --> 01:30:06,080
based on what they purchase and so i

2601
01:30:03,840 --> 01:30:07,600
encourage folks you know ask questions

2602
01:30:06,080 --> 01:30:09,440
about soil health about regenerative

2603
01:30:07,600 --> 01:30:12,000
agriculture at farmers markets like who

2604
01:30:09,440 --> 01:30:13,600
are you buying from at grocery stores at

2605
01:30:12,000 --> 01:30:15,760
restaurants and even have these

2606
01:30:13,600 --> 01:30:17,520
conversations with family members or

2607
01:30:15,760 --> 01:30:19,920
with for the hill staff on the line with

2608
