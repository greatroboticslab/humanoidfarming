  "text": "uh food safety council or conference education china in july of 2014 and the reason they held it is between 2012 and 2014 they saw a 59 percent increase in cancer rates and whenever grain comes in from argentina now they've got 1.4 billion people and if they have a lot of sick people or autistic children which is growing erratically they just cannot afford it bob can i ask you to stand over here should i we'll get a better song of the life right here would be perfect right there you may have to move if i'm going to stand here and so as long as you can see it i'm good so they know if they can't have that continued increase they can't afford it as we can here now will it make a difference china is a different country i got home and my wife asked are you ready to go back i thought a little bit and i said no i don't think so why i'm not that big on eating cooked cabbage the beds were as hard as the floor here everything was foreign if you ate food and it was a chicken dish they cut up the chicken and they leave the bone fragments in the food so and pollution was terrible but the top seven generals in the chinese army were in the front row of the audience and that's the biggest market for our soybeans in the world they basically import 67 percent of the exported soybeans in the world and roughly 50 to 55 percent of the u.s soybeans end up in china feeding people there and there will be some major changes in their consumption and soybean supply anyhow we think the message about healthy food is getting home the successful farming magazine is published by meredith publishing in des moines iowa and they ran a mid-february issue 2016. it was entitled farmers meet your new boss and it was a 12 star nine segment 12 page story i can send copies to people but in there they said the millennial shopper that's 30 to 35 years old or maybe 30 to 40 they want healthy food they want happy families they want good nutrition in their food and they said farmers even if you don't like the message recognize that these shoppers will make up say 70 of the shopping public in about 10 years so you better adapt and we went and talked to the head editor dave kearns a few days after they showed up and we thanked him for writing it and we asked are you expecting any negative feedback he said yes we're going to the big uh actual here uh commodity classic and we're expecting people to come up and my we've already prepared our answer and that is we publish 34 magazines in different languages and we also publish like ladies home journal and quite a few women's magazines and they knew that uh roughly 100 million women a month read their magazine and they said we like producing the best producing circulating in different countries the best farm magazine possible we also do the same for women's magazines we did our survey we know what the five top hot hot buttons are for women and it's healthy food happy families good nutrition so if any of the egg producers or any people disagree with us we'll let them argue with a hundred million mad women so uh i like uh part of what i'm here for is to share this news and then also interact with people and hopefully learn about some markets where we can connect some midwest producers to maybe consumers out here i'm involved in a big food project that we may move on to different countries but 30 miles north of me in central iowa will be the biggest fish farm in the nation by this fall and within five years after five planned expansions it will be the biggest in the world they're raising barramundi which are australian sea bass so they went after the higher dollar eight dollar pound fish markets to the two dollar pound tilapia market which is a bottom feeding fish anyhow uh nutrient uptake by 200 bushel corn which is kind of the standard servings is listed here and basically the number one used herbicide which is from company in saint louis uh chelates all of these they're all listed here uh richard olrey is speaking quite a bit today he's a good friend and he likes to work with pubmed and he looked at those minerals and he figured out what percent of the genes that are in the human construct involved those minerals he said roughly 59 of them and that's why we're seeing a lot of the diseases in there and i'll get heavier into that uh bob i need you to stay in between those two lines or else you're not on screen for the life people are actually following this life okay right there it's fine [Music] now people are asking is that the education the herbicide or is it the insertion of the gene that's causing the problem and uh basically at universities uh no one gets a grant to do this work or these studies unless they have permission from the seed companies they're not going to do that the two people that have done it is ishmael catmac at purdue and then luis zobioli out of mourinho brazil when he was studying with bob kramer at university of missouri but they looked just at the insertion of the trait and they found pretty significant decrease in those minerals in the plant and the thing is most of those minerals are those uh manganese boron copper and zinc if the plants are missing them they're going to be very prone to disease attack and dying from uh fungal disease probably a root disease if humans are deficient in those minerals they're also going to get sick and very likely end up with alzheimer's okay there's rich's slide there is a chart that shows a correlation or the chelation quotient between the glyphosate product and the different minerals and quite a few of them chart is available what we urge farmers to do now though is take a closer look at their fertility programs number one when they pull soil tests we urge them that if they haven't been looking at those micronutrients pay attention to it part of the problem and lack of decent nutrition to the plants and to the people is that most of these tasks will detect if the mineral is there but it won't detect if it's plant available or if it's being calated by a stronger compound which is the case okay here's the work uh you know i got that in there twice yeah what we're seeing in probably 90 of the fields right now is a general uh instead of a dark green color we got light green dark green streaking and there were a lot of publications 20 years ago where they diagnosed it and there was a chart called be your own corn doctor if you're showing this discoloration it's shortage of sulfur or nitrogen if you're showing this zinc or another mineral we don't see that as much anymore and most farmers look at it and their agronomists don't know about it universities aren't telling them what to look for so the teachers aren't trained but if we see that the plant is going to be much more drought prone stress grown subject to disease attack and also diseases more likely to show up which was the case now in north central iowa i like flying a friend of mine builds his own airplanes and he wins the top prize for homebuilt and oshkosh wisconsin so he's safe to fly with but we're going over fields southwest of fort dodge iowa north central early august of 2010 and all the corn underneath it should be dark green it's not it's brown it's dead from a new disease brought on by lack of nutrition and bacteria that moved into the corn crop and that happened to be the same bacteria collaborator that was used as the promoter when they did the first bt project anyhow these are soybean fields they should all be dark green instead they were attacked by a fusarium fungus which is a root rot again caused due to lack of nutrition everything should be dark green why these are significant is guess where the food supply is coming from oftentimes from these disease fields uh two great uh kind of case studies that were done by lay people are written up in books one is called animal farm and that's p-h-a-r-m written by mark purdy who is an organic british dairy farmer that did not believe the official explanation of what was called mad cow disease or bse which is caused by a biomatrix that we commonly call a prion the other one is when you chelate cobalt with a herbicide it's not available you will demyelinate your nerve sheath and you'll end up like a famous baseball player called lou gehrig and uh if you happen to go to a dentist and he's talking about giving nitrous oxide you may tell the dentist i want to beat our cobalt test first because if you're exposed to nitrous oxide it converts the valency of the cobalt from plus one to the plus two or plus three valency and it will not be body available and as i mentioned to a few people i played softball in iowa falls in our good second baseman ended up being a superintendent in school after he got his doctorate and he went in for a small dental procedure and he never woke up from the anesthetic and it may have been this as the root cause so if people are around different uh products that chelate it there are things you can do in this case we tell people if they're using liberty herbicide to uh take b12 supplements or get some losses or actually get a b12 shot core atom and b vitamins is cobalt uh going a little bit further into that uh investigation as far as why the eighty percent of the u.s corn crop was dying early we ended up getting referred to dr chris johnson who was a head researcher specializing in prions at the national fish and wildlife research group in madison wisconsin and i dropped some samples off with him and they tested it and they got a coke's postulate which is where you take a disease plant isolate the organism and test or treat another new plant healthy plant with it and it comes down to the same disease then that's called fulfilling colt's postulate but he wrote a a good article on it but he was censored and never got published so what we've been working on in the full investigation has been we've been working on since 2009 when the disease first showed up and the full investigation has been going on since 1999 it still hasn't come to a full conclusion but there's a few good books to read one actually started out with kurt vonnegut jr because he helped solve the riddle as far as something that is not living can replicate and as his brother as it turned out he would discuss crystal work with his brother who happened to be a crystal researcher at mit and they would talk about this at thanksgiving dinner and such and he took the talk about crystals replicating and put it in his book called cat's cradle but another good book deadly feast by i think richard rhodes and it was a story about a epidemiologist medical doctor that was working with cannibals in new guinea and at the start of the story they describe a feast where granny is both the guest of honor the main course but they had a strange neurological disease show up called kuru so a fellow by the name of uh well then following that was uh mark purdy who was an organic british dairy farmer that didn't believe the official explanation and he found out that the mad cow was showing up when they had a deficiency in copper an excess of manganese and exposure to high levels of em emission that was sent off a cascade but the prions that were in their brain that are used to store long-term memories in normal humans or in the prc form but when they're exposed to the high levels of em emission and the other factors they convert to the infected prpcs form and the person that did the best work was probably a fellow named stanley prusner who was a neurologist at university of california san francisco he worked on it 20 to 25 years it was his passion everyone says the dead end he ended up winning the nobel prize in medicine in 1997. now if these are in the food supply if they're in the body the way to get them out is by taking a mineral called clinoptillolite c-l-i-n-o-p-t-i-l-o-l-i-t-e and it is ground zeolite which is used in an aquarium to take the nitrogen out of the water it's a volcanic mineral if they grind it at one to three nanometers in size at 105 degree angle and it's considered clean up to light but uh is probably the number one cause for low birth rates in the us because the freon considers the fetus as nutritional rival and how we found it is in a high percentage of young animals who are being miscarried during the mid stages of pregnancy the aborted placental tissue ended up being full filled with these little crystals and diagnostic our vet pathologists that did the staining in the autoclaving uh ended up finding it in the feed source which was a soybean meal at that time but harvard medical is researching these as far as how they're connected to arteriosclerosis parting of the arteries arthritis cataracts and alzheimer's anyhow uh i happen to go with don huber the top ag scientist in the world on a seven-day road trip we took pictures in an industrial scanning electron microscope i got these pictures here at anywhere from fourteen thousand to a hundred eighty thousand times magnification and these are coming from corn and soybean tissue from the midwest chinese found them right away in soybeans imported from the us they just screw the plants up from the seed split the leaves open in the scope or slide to catch the juice that flowed out of the leaves and they found that i mentioned uh as far as verification of this uh dr claudio soto at the university of texas health services wrote a big article probably the best one on it and there's stanley cruz nerf's work he's still alive uh harvard our washu in st louis has a true lab they do the work there also and there's a lot of faculty go between washu and harvard and i've talked to a few of the people and they're correlating it with 24 other human diseases and if you don't have the 45 years experience as a vet pathologist know how to stain it and do the autoclave work you're never going to find these you're never going to see these they made a few bad assumptions and that is the they said they were reductionists they said the presence of one gene controlled the expression one type and what they know now is genetic system press our one trait typically is controlled by the electromagnetic interaction between bullseye so it's a lot more complicated than that and also what they didn't know is that every human has two to five pounds of bacteria in their gut and those bacteria are responsible for extracting nutrients controlling human health and also make up roughly uh seventy percent of the immune system in people okay we basically all pesticides that they have in fact most herbicides might keep work by chelating minerals but the history of pesticides basically starts in europe pre-world war one and the big company is called ig farming and farben is a german word for colors and they were making industrial dies out of coal tar now when after world war ii they had the nuremberg trials and basically ig farben was split up into three companies basf bayer and uh hurst works so and then in this country we had uh pyrethroids were developed by the british from chrysanthemum flowers and then we in this country we had efforts at fort detrick and that's basically where we worked to counter the activity of the russians that was detailed in a book called biohazard adhd is a major problem right now what's the cause of it and what they know is basically insects nervous system is very similar to that of humans so if you work with colonist race inhibitors or nerves in insects and people are exposed to that either as direct say drift or exposure through the food or air they're very unlikely to have some of the same problems and if you talk to any teachers at work with grade school kids discipline is oftentimes our number one problem as far as leaky gut and all of that i was involved in this project i still have a 30 year old t-shirt hanging one time should she throw it away i said no it's a gold mine but what it was trying to uh create insect resistant corn and they did it by taking a genetic sequence from uh soil dwelling bacteria called bacillus thuragensis or bt and they were using clavibacter bacteria to put it into corn and anyhow it was great because number one problem grazing corn in the western corn belt is european corn bark that came from europe and supposedly up the economy during world war one but if that's happened uh they theorized that it was only be effective against insects that have an alkaline gut not something with an acidic gut but it looks like there are some of their assumptions were wrong because if kids are having a problem with leaky gut it's major problem behavior problems and then oftentimes it breaks the blood-brain barrier so they have done a lot of microtoming of different gut cells they know that one type of food causes basically a breakdown of the gut lining loss of integrity loss of attackness with and without and they have got the medical proof that there is an actual problem it's not mental uh we really needed uh to explain this whole thing and to work with us over in china present good evidence we needed the help of two good human biochemists we end up getting help from a guy named anthony sam south who i believe is up in new hampshire not a raspy old guy but very intelligent he started doing the work after he would he's got some greenhouses that he works in at his house and he would just be into a bucket instead of going outside in the cold winter he noticed uh when he's poured the bucket onto plants that would kill them so he thought maybe i've got something in me i should check out so he ended up forcing all of monsignors getting and acquiring all of monsanto's secret research results through the freedom of information act anyhow he partnered up with steph center who's a head biochemist at mit they've written six major review papers about 30 to 40 pages in length very heavy reading but if you read are going to be pretty much kind of impartial expert on it we're also seeing a lot of uh different parts of the country where the price of combines has gotten quite expensive the if they have to hire in uh combines to harvest their crop they want to stay on schedule and they will spray their crop to desiccate it so was all right say next tuesday when the cutting crew gets here and uh the systemic herbicide that late in the season will be sprayed on the leaves and it will be transported directly to the growing point which at that point is the brain so a lot of the people that think that gluten intolerance actually might be very allergic about creating symptoms due to the glyphosate that is contained in there so we really need a replacement for it and there's good progress coming on that but read these papers it's samsel incentive number one two three four five and six and they're already working on seven eight at night again nancy swanson basically showed the correlation between uh bt corn acres and colitis and crohn's crohn's is a nasty disease that if you haven't his lifetime affliction i lost a sister to it there are alternatives out there there's a fellow named bob quinn uh farms up montana he run grows the ancient wheats that were selected for digestibility and flavor rather than being able to be processed quite easily so he raises grains like commute and spelt grinds them and sells under the label bob's red mill and those are alternatives sanaf did work on it as have other people and there's a strong correlation between gut microbes and obesity if you throw off the gut population and you move away from having lactobacillus enterococcus and biofidium as your major three bacteria and move towards salmonella e coli and clostridium you'll have major problems a lady by the name of dergena stanley teaches at queensland university in australia and she has found out that if they do fecal transplants and include specific bacteria in the transplant you can actually cure autism and diabetes she's done the work but when she writes she always writes like she's doing it on poultry and that way she disguises her results but uh there is an obesity switch and it looks like that's being affected uh you go to other parts of the world and the number of people grossly overweight is down quite a bit i guess i've been impressed with the shape of the people here it looks like there's a lot of marathoners and such but you go to different parts of the world germany argentina you can tell they're starting to drink a lot of pop and consuming high fructose corn syrup which hopkins found out doesn't get digested for usage it gets towards fat right away anyhow brings up the question is roundup in our food and if you're eating a modern uh drive-through diet or a fast food diet hamburger cheeseburger with french fries during pop there's quite a few different ways where the glyphosate can get into your system and it looks like it's involved in a high percentage of major diseases they actually tested honey zen honeycut with mothers across america did one study a friend of mine did another one they looked at honey from northwest iowa again honey is made from nectar and pollen from flowers and if you got pesticide drip landing on those flowers it's picked up in the honey so more places than you think there's quite a bit of talk yesterday at the pre-meeting about instruments that could be used to detect it this device is what's called an x-ray diffraction instrument from broker which is a massachusetts country it's it looks like a giant squirt gun and uh it does cost on it there's two tools that come with it together it's about 63 thousand dollars and it was repurposed our broker requested that dr jill clapperton who's the number one or two number uh best soil microbiologists in the world repurpose it so she is using it and she is putting food products in the tray be it uh a fruit a vegetable processed grain and egg or peel off an orange it will analyze for all 94 minerals in about 75 to 80 seconds and it'll give you a total rundown on it and part of the goal is to have these out there it also picks up small molecules which would include pesticides and pharmaceuticals and i work quite a bit with jill and i ask that the number three library be built for mycotoxins because more and more people are being exposed to bacteria or fungal mold or is coming through the grain we're seeing a major problem with if our farmers have grain that basically rots and they can't feed it to their livestock they will take it to an ethanol plant and the ethanol plant will basically concentrate the mycotoxins 3x and then they try to sell it as ddgs to other livestock feeders if they don't accept it they try to get rid of it in animal food pet food and also human food and we've got places where the dogs will not bread anymore in iowa and major problem in humans uh exposure to some of them the symptoms will range from uh refusal to feed or to esophageal cancer so major problems also adhd uh what the 65 000 instrument will replace is probably one that runs 350 to 500 thousand dollars the state of the art is uh the so-called lc tandem ms we're working on a scanner that we hoped would be out two years ago in june um designed and built by the jet propulsion lab engineers price point was going to be 250 and a housewife could take it in scan all of her food before she bought it for mineral content and pesticides but uh things kind of fell apart on that dan was involved and dan has visited with the engineers on it very smart people it's not completely dead i found out this summer one thing if you've got relatives in florida let them know that they probably need to do something with their water this is a slide of data taken by a well water survey taken by the u.s geological survey group which is in the department of interior but is well water in central florida and everything in the pink area uh is contaminated with the number one used herbicide partly because the citrus growers have been using 20 gallons of roundup per acre on some of their ground for 20 years now they excuse me 20 pounds they're putting on four gallons five times a year four quarts five times a year yeah okay now i i'd gas with that figure this shows that if you're irrigating corn with 28 inches of water which typical in their sandy soil they calculated how much glyphosate would be pumped per acre or per square mile and they've got some places 35 million pounds coming up just a huge number and i've got a friend that has the only organic citrus grove in florida they're very proud of it they sell it as uncle max he was caught in a conundrum and his news name are they found glyphosate in orange juice in florida which is not surprising at all he tried to get a permit to dig an irrigation well and they would not give him one they said if you want water for your trees will give you the waste water from orlando and i've got a friend that is an oxford trained forensic medical pathologist he did analysis on the water and it was 24 20 to 40 part per million glyphosate and it also contained a lot of pharmaceuticals and that is why these trees are dying because roundup works not like inhibiting the shikomite pathway but it works by tying up the minerals needed to have an immune system and fight off the root pathogens so we've got food sources this is what is allowed by epa and these levels and standards are not set by science they're based on requests by the herbicide companies and they go in every so often they raise them because they want to be within the standards that are allowed now if you have the uh bessie the cow you can have 400 part per million glyphosate in the hay that you're eating number one problem in cattle sometimes in this country and in europe germany especially is botulism chronic botulism because uh you kill off the three beneficial ones which i mentioned earlier ones that thrive are e coli salmonella and clostridium there's effects out there beverage sources they tested german beer i think they were all contaminated and men had a much higher glyphosate level as tested by urine analysis because germans drink more beer and my favorite one or steiner wheat is on there so i don't drink much anymore at all so if you're a highbrow californian might say i don't drink beer i drink wine they tested in st louis 14 different brands some organic wines and 90 of them were contaminated because usda rules allows organic crops to be fertilized with manures from cattle and been fed gmo brain anyhow this was a german study they did basically city dwellers that do not spray and it was coming through the food or the drink uh fungicides they're used more and more to fight these diseases a good friend of mine is a top plant pathologist with the argentinian usda and he works with a group called jerkus was is a japanese usda and just to prove there were no fungicide residues in the grain they finally tested some for the first time guess what they found and they've got a real bad sleeping disease in northern argentina and all of brazil called asian rust it's a worst disease plant disease people i've ever seen if you see the plants beginning to turn yellow there's no way to say them it will die and we saw it one year wiped about about 15 million acres of soybeans so it places the chinese food supply in jeopardy anyhow north carolina medical school did a study doesn't all show up on this uh slide but anyhow they the second most common fungicides used are the strabil urines they came out of basf as a stabilized synthetic version of a strobiliaris product that prevented other fungi from utilizing pine cones in the forest as a food source but he treated human nerve cells he had a petri dish with these fungicides he found severe neurological damage to the nerve cells so he's theorizing that these are tied into huntington's disease als ms what have you so they need more studies yet lauren pang is the health official former whole official on the island of hawaii know him quite well in where they've got some severe problems with pesticide exposure say on kauai near a town called waimea the companies have to show a list of what they were all spraying and the reason that became a big problem is there were times they were spraying uh op insecticide a neurological affecting herbicide uh insecticide right next to the schools and the winds will change from being 20 miles from the north one minute five minutes later the 20 minutes from the south and there were adults that would have to go to school take their kids right to the hospital to have them treated for an insecticide that companies would not reveal they had been sprayed and at night they'd go home and they'd take their parents to kidney dialysis because all the dust that blew into their houses and they weren't able to get anything done but what lauren did is when they say epa test one herbicide they only did run one task that's all that's required when you test two products you have to test product a and product b and a times b when you've got three you do a b c a times b b times c plus a times c so it was at five or seven or if you're exposed to 87 different things probably simultaneously that's one times 10 to the 23rd different cases or combinations you need to test and they've only got the money to do five i mentioned chronic botulism become a deadly disease for cattle if you ever hear about 200 cattle all of a sudden being found dead on a farm and it's not lightning it's not ufo damage it's probably chronic botulism because what it will do the cattle will get gaunt skeletal the mouth will get paralyzed and they'll just drop over dead in the stanton because the neurological toxin will get our botulism toxin gets so high now when ladies get a botox injection that's the same toxin what the german scientists medical people have discovered is most sid's death crib death are due to exposure to botulism and a friend of mine was filling in for don huber when don was hit in the hospital and he happened to be out in maine and was giving donald's lecture and donna uh dairy farmer invited him out to come see his cattle 200 or 150 dairy cows that the farmer is very proud of and bill day's farmers that have all their cow's name that was herds of 20 or so and anyhow michael watched them walked past and the farmer asked what do you think of my cattle he said you got a really nice herd you should be really proud but you've got three or four that have a problem guy asked what do you mean he said i noticed four are walking stiffly like their joints are hurting them and i watched them drink water by the fountain and they're lapping the water up instead of drinking it and he said what might happen you come in the next two or three days they'll be dead in the stance and the farmer asks how do you know this and mike says well i kind of worked on that my previous life which is where that i talked about that grinder and and then the farmer started crying great big 200 pound guy six foot three and usually farmers don't start crying like that mike asked what's the problem he says my grandson's in the hospital they don't know what's wrong with them i mean you're going downhill and mike says call them up and request a botulism test right away and they did it was positive and they saved the kid anyhow are we seeing it in iowa yeah major problem in dairy herds california i've seen it three times in iowa and it's where they're consuming uh lights of glyphosate which is screwing up the the gut population chronic fatigue also connected with it in germany they counter it by taking a humate product called activa men or active almond in this country there are different uh humate sources uh one that is commercialized and well researched is a product called restore which is developed by a triple certified medical doctor zach bush it is sold in gnc i believe and also walmart for about 63 dollars for a bottle that lasts about 96 days i take it i think everybody should and i'm working with a another humane guy out in idaho and it'll be a powdered pill rather than a liquid but what it does it ties up the active ingredient in cattle they can also take sauerkraut juice because sauerkraut is fermented with the lactobacillus bacteria i'm sorry so what does that do exactly it uh the lac if you're trying to get the gut healthy again the number one thing is to get rid of the herbicide that diet that is dirty and then try to re-establish the gut population the number one bacteria beneficial and being lactobacillus and solid kraut juice or sauerkraut in general contains is fermented using active bacillus bacteria that floats into this sauerkraut from the air so some it sold over the counter in germany a friend of mine that lives along the mississippi river his level was 13 part per billion in his urine and anyhow he is german he went over there brought the product back it's a humane pill he made is basically the shaving off the top of a coal bed which is made of old plant parts high in carbon but you've got a lot of binding sites in it under a microscope that looks like a honeycomb and it ties up the the toxin and then you crap it out you said the product was your store restore it's a liquid product and uh well researched by the nih medical community and if you look up uh do a youtube either jeffrey smith or dr mercola interviewing zach bush zach bush i've got to admit he was on the patrick temple's gmo revealed series and they describe him as probably the best educated best well-spoken young physician they've run across and i would tend to concur except he gets about three things wrong but well worth watching and what he's done uh is he made the excellent connection between healthy soil healthy people uh this was stephanie and anthony's first talk uh that when we're in china one of the presenters was a lady by the name of rowena or makova and we had heard about a study where they fed gm food to lab animals by the end of the second or third generation they're all sterile we heard it was done in russian we thought well probably done in a bathtub our old car radiator well she happens to be head of the neural uh human behavior and neural bioscience institute very good scientist is kind of a good scientist in russia and she did not believe the results when she did it and usually you don't look at rats and think those poor little rats but she didn't believe the results so he had the study repeated nine times the results were the same every single time and i don't know vladimir putin in person a friend of mine has met with him several times but fed said no more gm food in their country they view modified food as a germ warfare weapon as do the chinese wasn't that study also found that the rats were growing but yeah the loss of fecundity was showing up and repeated nine times and uh one medical conference i was at was called the environmental health medical conference they're having one in i think scottsdale arizona in april and anyhow it's the doctors that you go to when the mayo clinic says i've got nothing i can do for you i just go home and prepare to die and what these doctors do uh every community i think should have a doctor trained in this because without it i'll tell about top 16 out later but the learning objective is uh what they are teaching people that are just getting introduced to environmental medicine if if you have a patient come out do about a five step survey and say five step survey first of all look and see what heavy metals they've been exposed to in any previous work or hobby heavy metals what have you number two look and see what maybe bacterial fungal mycotoxins they may have been exposed to number three look and see what industrial compounds such as in paint in wallboard in carpet they've been exposed to then look and see what pesticides may be coming through the food or the water and then lastly look at maybe em emission height levels the electrical circuitry or gauss's coming from electronic equipment a lot of work on cell phones has in wi-fi has been done in the netherlands and israel they do not have been worldwide conferences on that topic a friend of mines whose wife was on six star sunday morning cbs a few years ago when they were researching it caught the start of it before running out doing some work and i said that's what bert's wife has and she is a processing engineer that taught at a university but she could no longer tolerate cell phone power signals and she can't take the signal from u.s cellular her sister cannot tolerate signals from verizon and anyhow they had her living in a metal travel trailer inside a machine shed and that still wasn't enough so she'd get physically out they finally sold some ground and they bought a house in west virginia where they got a big radio uh telescope to listen for signals from outer space and uh that whole valley that people can have cell phones they can't have wi-fi and the whole valley which is big in west virginia is being populated by people from around the world that are sensitive to em signals uh anyhow the major conference was chaired by a senator from iowa and joel lieberman and they ruled this research is real people are affected by having health consequences but basically major companies utilities and cell phone companies were probably at fault partly the utilities because they take the easy way to ground their equipment out now in human medicine it's not a topic in dairy cattle that are very sensitive i've got a couple friends that uh go out and they diagnose three voltage and they're very very sometimes are actually natural because you sit on a tetronic plate but they actually clear up the problem but there is the agenda there's a list that's kind of what i was looking for uh basically look at fam family history have you a history of disease why this is important is the number one detox system in the body for chemicals and in the plants herbicides is what's called the p450 cytochrome system and it allows the body to detox it by breaking it down if you've got poor mineralization in your history or you've got a lower genetic tolerance to it uh you may not be able to detoxify something that you're one of your siblings or one of your cousin can't that's very important now uh dow chemical has a dark history and what it boiled down to is they were using an organophosphate insecticide as a termiticide so people would come and have their house treated for termites the vapor would move and if the kids slept in a downstairs basement uh the day after it was treated some of those kids went into a coma that they were still in 30 years later and dow was paying for their care and that was never revealed but a happy head of a group and the head of research for that company was a good was a friend of mine and great guy to work with and that's why they moved to using fipronil instead of the organophosphate much safer and it lasts longer so what we talk about what contributes to total body burden and basically anytime you're exposed to something that challenges your immune function and detox system it's all cumulative uh the best uh medical health doctor in the country that i've run across is uh jill carnahan she's an illinois farm gal and she is a survivor of cancer in crohn's and also mold exposure when her boulder colorado office was flooded anyhow the way she related is suppose you've all got your personal detox bucket it's a five gallon bucket and some people's buckets are hinged at two inches above the ground others are right at the top and every time you're exposed to something that bucket gets filled forward and fuller when that bucket tips that's when you get sick so if you can decontaminate your body or clean out your liver the main filtration system in the body then you're going to stay healthy and uh you've got different spectrums of viability depending on the mineral levels and then also your diet and your genetics the number two system is methylation there's four of these four minor ones one major one different symptomology all the time rashes sleepiness irritability canker sores look through there quite a list i think i only listed half of them here more red flags allergies infertility brain fog the young fellow i've got with me is a grandson of a good friend of mine that does a lot of ag writing very good investigator and anyhow this kid and his father had severe problem with brain fog they started taking the restore which with the minerals in it repaired the direct circuitry from the gut into the brain and brain fog cleared up within 20 minutes i started taking one of their products it was called h2 and i'm usually usually get six hours of sleep and i'm wired and going yet at three but i was taking that i was going 23 hours a day and i wasn't getting tired that kind of scared me because i know you can't do that too long but it's an h2 product so good slide and this i think came from uh it originally had sweet crawford in there who was from dekalb illinois but it said if a woman is getting out to get dressed up and go out she's exposing herself to 187 potential toxins and this is why i was down in ecuador working on some rose farms and long-term potential is to get them extracting essential oils for the organic cosmetic industry in europe that's where the bumps are anyhow a lot of things you're probably sitting there thinking holy crap i use them all the time so like running into potential problems as far as glyphosate exposure anthony samsel did the study and the gel caps that most medicines come in are made from collagen which comes from cattle tendons and such they boil them and they don't give any regards if there's any glyphosate eaten by those cattle that is in the gel caps and also when they make medicines they use that fermentation and the media typically will continue so my wife's name is carol she was feeling uh doll and she's she's a live wire she's a retirement age and she worked 42 years in a medical lab and anyhow rachel did a over the phone exposure because that's richard's gift go listen to him and he listened and she was full of fluoride 4x normal levels with the hair analysis showed where did she get it from at the time we thought it was from bottled water and from taking cholesterol drugs statins because they're fluoride based anyhow uh she went to arden anderson who's a head's our think tank group and he's a md ph.d masters in public health agronomist air force flight surgeon so he's pretty good and went to his uh got an adt a chelation from him in his office west of kansas city and it came back and her body ate high cholesterol and also stopped like on fire so they did the et chelation 24-hour urine catch they sent it to the lab came back and she was full of lead gallatin galidenium thorium caesium and they said where might these have come from what was your job well iowa state university in the doe lab is their center for rare earth research and they're refining them in the floor right above her my first question is did they have a separate ventilation system the answer was no so she was full of these and why she had the high level of cholesterol is if this was causing inflammation and the body knows that it's the liver to go into high gear reduce as much as you can to protect the brain so she went down had a full body chelation by the top doctor in the country who's also in the think tank down in beaumont down in kirbyville texas and after nine sessions they dropped her cholesterol level by over 100 points got rid of the ache and the pains and she's ready to go for another 20 years so anyhow most people don't know about that they sit there she went to the doctor and the doctor said she couldn't sleep either and her solution all the problem is take a sleeping pill so that's why i think more people need to be aware of this and be aware that turn of the century most hospitals had a chelation office but what they do this guy besides being a medical doctor it was a physicist he built his own equipment but they take the blood out they run it through a uv light they subject it to ozone to get more oxygen in there and they inject the edt8 which is a universal solvent but she got rid of the plaque of her blood vessels 83 year old friend of mine he gets a chelation about twice a year he's got zero plaque in his blood vessels the only thing he's got wrong with his health he's got angina because he put his cell phone in his shirt pocket for too many years so i'm going down there i great health but i know i like steak i like french fries sometimes i fry hash browns i'm going down there just because i know the years i've got some plaque probably so it's there as far as mold what do we do we're down in ecuador and along the coast everyone's got mold problems if you're in hawaii major problem even in fancy houses they pulled the they didn't know where the mold was they took the wallpaper down guess where it was it was growing on the glue which is scottish based in the house in a nice house you think there's no mold except and that one place is on the sofa cushions so uh continuous problem serious problem again symptoms associated with it many there's 14 different ones i think there's two pages 28 major mycotoxins ingrained the thing is if they're coming at you you don't know they're there because they're tough to detect and also say one major one of the t2 toxins there's 400 of them only one has been researched the other 399 have been researched but the data is still classified top secret by the us military and what we're seeing now with more root rots because glyphosate kills off the beneficial bacteria in the soil the fusarium and aspergillus molds are increasing and showing up in the diet this oxford trained medical pathologist went into a local grocery store and he's got the old rebel type but he went and grabbed samples from 20 boxes of kids cereal none of them tested under the allowable level for mycotoxins again health effects of fungi breathe in there numerous common symptoms ones that most people have at some time maybe all the times again symptoms metallic taste quite common sometimes uh supposed not supposed to reveal this yet but uh will anyhow we had the bird flu come through iowa supposedly a viral disease things were extremely fishy with it different producers were told anybody in my group do not allow feed samples to be taken anyhow it ended up in 46 million chickens and turkeys ended up being destroyed sometimes multi-million dollar losses and then a major problem with disposing of the carcasses anyway i was sitting there mentioning to a water research friend of mine i made the comment wouldn't it be nice if someone had a machine you could sit down and using either electronic waves or some sort of smell wipe out all the bacteria and fungi that are causing the problem well one of these has been developed it was tested by the world health organization and he was called to testify in front of the whole over in italy three weeks ago and this device we hope to get on the market looks good we've got a health and wellness page we uh put a website together with the help of the guy that did the website for steppenwolf and a grateful dead and we put a lot of our own content in there and we have a health solution store up there for people trying to get the information and uh a good example if you're a teacher or have kids there was a school in wisconsin up at appleton and it was a school for behavior or disordered kids and uh delinquents kids that didn't go to school getting bad grades didn't want to study true what have you and an outside consultant came in that had a good idea on diet and he looked at the doctor he said everything junk let's get rid of the pop let's get rid of the high fructose corn syrup let's uh put better food in there which ended up being cheaper and after three months all the kids were perfect no behavior problems that was one of the better performing high schools in the state of wisconsin and nationally and anyhow the officials were told whatever you do don't tell anyone else about this thing but a daughter a friend of ours happen to know about this but it's called you can google it miracle in wisconsin some neat stories but it was proof that all these toxins that are in the grain mycotoxins poor diet does have consequences shows up in the kids because they're younger they don't have the big fully functioning immune system so recommendations then for all these problems we tell people clean up the food supply use restore or this hopefully to get on the market called the molecule to repair the gut tract tissue and then to get rid of any prions which were not in the food supply and maybe are linked to alzheimer's because it's a plaque disease uh anthony samsel has done a lot of work on it he concurs with that but there is clean optilite available i get mine from a micro minerals company out of the netherlands i have don bring it back when he comes to europe nine grams per day there is a small religious community in illinois and one of the leaders of the church was in our group and owns a seed company and we're down there putting on a meeting and all of a sudden being as an elder in the church he got word that this lady in his community had miscarried for the third or fourth time in a row and they had not had a live birth in their community for a year and we sent some placental tissue down to the vet pathologist that had done the work on the large animals and the placental tissue was full of these crystals and the next question is what do we do about it and some amish guy came up with a solution before we could figure it out but they started taking the clinton out till the light and within nine months they're going to have a light burst in the community again we've seen the same thing in animals point nine grams per day in with the juice the same thing if you're tr ha if somebody your family is being treated for a cancerous tumor the best way to shrink the size of the tube and maybe make it disappear is take this because it chelates out the iron and energy is delivered to the tumor by a charged iron so if you take it they say take mineral supplements at the same time so where is this available in the u.s different health food stores sell it they jack the price up quite a bit i get mine for maybe 10 a pound out of micro minerals in the netherlands if you anyone in your family has aquariums and you can go to the aquarium store and get a filter that pulls the ammonia out of the water that's called zeolite it's volcanic mineral when they grind it smaller then it comes to an optilite i'll last the fertility organic growers will use a product called azolite hazelnite is also zeolite uh we work with a couple uh our medical doctors environmental health medical people taught one's from illinois there's a real good one from out in mount shasta california they work with us as far as the effect of all of these exposures we don't quite know michael k skinner was a good researcher at washington state university and in his uh multi-year study he exposed lab animals to [Music] five different toxins at levels one one hundredth of what was considered harmful and the genetic damage was done and the damage did not show up until the third generation later again they censored him on that i showed the restored product very usable my friend that developed the other machine has his phd in biophysics from oxford and tokyo he developed an under the counterfeit system for about 1500 that will pull the roundup out of drinking water so if you've got a water supply that is coming stream fed you always want to look upstream and ask what crops are being grown and what pesticides are they're using if it's a pesticide with a long residual life then you should have your urine tested which can be done by john fagan at his lab in fairfield iowa it's called research health lab and he's got the equipment to test for glyphosate and its primary metabolite which is called ampa amino methylphosphonic acid but you should have that done i've had it done but that was when they're using immunoassay which was not as accurate as what the germans could do so i need to get that done i've got a kit paid for just haven't done it there's the under the counter works very well does he talk to don huber he found out the chelation quotient you",
