  "text": "[Music] one of the most difficult things that we struggle with is regular maintenance on equipment and as we're kind of winding down getting to the end of the season and have more free time the equipment comes home from jobs and we've got opportunities to do regular maintenance well it's not regular this would be seasonal maintenance so some of those things include changing oil transmission hydraulic fluids tightening tracks some of those things that that throughout the work season that maybe we didn't get to or that we didn't give enough attention some of the other things that we've done this year is is new teeth on the buckets new cutting edges on the excavator buckets um we've got that 6t grading bucket and we've got a rock bucket here that we put new teeth on and it's it's you can get a lot of wear out of those teeth you can run them right down to to to the nub right down to nothing but we found that they cut a lot better they work a lot better when they're sharp and so it's worth that additional money of changing the teeth regularly to to have that machine working as efficiently as possible so again that's just some of the the annual maintenance that we do that's in addition to regular maintenance like greasing and oiling and oil oil changes and those types of things that may be more regular on the schedule but it's it's a full-time job trying to to keep up on the maintenance in addition to get the work done and keep projects moving forward [Music] throughout the year there are certain projects like if we've got a big road building project then we'll we'll make upgrades to equipment that maybe hasn't gotten upgrades in a few years this year here we put new tires on the road grader because we had we had a couple of miles of road to build and we were going to be working the heck out of that road grader and it needed some new tires I couldn't afford to have a breakdown on the job and not be able to finish the job so got new tires they got new cutting edges they got a full service and then as we started that job I knew that we were going to be able to well have a better shot at getting the job completed with that maintenance done and so it's it's kind of an interesting thing on the equipment that's older and that it's paid for it's almost like there's still payments on that equipment you want to be putting money away so that when the time comes and you need that new tires or new cutting edges or whatever it might be that you've got the money in the bank to service set equipment and keep it running so it can keep making you money we put new tires on the grater and a lot of people said that they're they're not aggressive tires or they're not they're not knobby enough part of the reason that I made the decision on this tire and this tire tread is that The Grater does a lot of compaction on the road as it's traveling back and forth compacting material and these tires do a better job of compacting and making it flat so I can run this greater down on the road I can crab walk and and offset the back from the front just slightly and roll that road with these tires and a great big heavy duty tractor tire doesn't lay it in as smooth as these do and they're these are some really good tires they came highly recommended so far uh I've been impressed [Music] one of the things we're working on this winter is clearing out this 5 acre piece we've recently purchased this 5 1/2 acre piece and our plan is to put up a barn where we can put tools store equipment and have a place to do some of that maintenance whether it's regular maintenance or annual maintenance whatever it might be so we're clearing a lot there's some some saw piles there's some rock and gravel we've got a lot a lot of cleanup to do typically we wouldn't start a project like that like like this right now but it's the weather is warm there's no snow on the ground and we can deal with a little bit of mud the barn will let us take care and do maintenance through the winter when we have these slower times when we can't be out building roads or working on other projects so this is the start of building a barn some of you might recognize this property we we this this 5 and 1/2 acre piece is adjacent to the 40 acre piece where we've been developing houses over the last couple of years really enjoy this area area we like being close to town we like being close to the highway it's I can get to Starbucks in 3 minutes or Home Depot in four um and so this area is really close and and we've spent a lot of time out here and really like this area so when this opportunity came to pick up an adjacent parcel I I knew that I I wanted to jump on it I had to have it I wanted to be out here I really have had a great time working on this development project the last couple years um all of the parcels have sold and there's houses on I think I think there's foundations on seven out of the eight parcels and finished houses on half of that and another by the end of next year I my guess is that there'll be houses built on every single parcel [Music] for",
