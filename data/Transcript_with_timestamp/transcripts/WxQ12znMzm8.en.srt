1
00:00:16,500 --> 00:00:18,019
Often at a GRDC Grains Research

2
00:00:18,690 --> 00:00:20,219
Update, there'd be international

3
00:00:20,220 --> 00:00:21,935
speakers who share their experience

4
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:22,960
and knowledge.

5
00:00:23,100 --> 00:00:24,570
At the Goondiwindi update, one

6
00:00:24,780 --> 00:00:26,544
speaker who shared his international

7
00:00:26,610 --> 00:00:28,649
experience did so from a very

8
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:29,761
different perspective as a

9
00:00:29,762 --> 00:00:30,762
Fullbright scholar.

10
00:00:32,460 --> 00:00:33,659
The purpose of the Fulbright was

11
00:00:33,660 --> 00:00:34,709
really trying to understand

12
00:00:35,490 --> 00:00:37,229
the landscape for agricultural

13
00:00:37,230 --> 00:00:38,945
technologies where new technologies

14
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:40,944
are emerging, how those technologies

15
00:00:41,430 --> 00:00:43,289
inform future challenges both on

16
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:44,466
a global scale, but also

17
00:00:45,210 --> 00:00:46,876
how those technologies will inform

18
00:00:47,130 --> 00:00:48,540
some of the challenges that we have

19
00:00:48,750 --> 00:00:49,969
at the farm level as well.

20
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:51,709
The study tour was a quick four

21
00:00:51,900 --> 00:00:53,370
month trip to attend Texas A&M

22
00:00:54,240 --> 00:00:55,857
University and see where European

23
00:00:56,520 --> 00:00:58,409
agtech R&D is heading.

24
00:00:59,400 --> 00:01:01,259
As Professor Baillie told the update

25
00:01:01,260 --> 00:01:02,926
audience, the focus of his mission

26
00:01:03,360 --> 00:01:05,669
was game changing technologies

27
00:01:05,670 --> 00:01:06,750
in agriculture.

28
00:01:06,930 --> 00:01:08,309
There's been large investments in

29
00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:09,689
agricultural technologies in the

30
00:01:09,690 --> 00:01:11,279
last five to six years and in fact,

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,869
last year there was as much as 20

32
00:01:12,870 --> 00:01:15,299
billion dollars invested

33
00:01:15,300 --> 00:01:16,769
in agtech. And if you go back

34
00:01:16,770 --> 00:01:18,779
probably six or seven years ago,

35
00:01:19,140 --> 00:01:20,309
that was probably only about two or

36
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,329
three dollars billion. So there's

37
00:01:21,330 --> 00:01:22,699
been a rapid investment in agtech

38
00:01:22,980 --> 00:01:23,980
globally.

39
00:01:24,090 --> 00:01:25,379
And one of the things I wanted to do

40
00:01:25,380 --> 00:01:26,849
was look at what's fuelling that

41
00:01:26,850 --> 00:01:28,173
investment, where are those

42
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,900
technologies are being developed.

43
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,829
And one of the things that underpins

44
00:01:31,830 --> 00:01:33,779
this story is the the growing

45
00:01:33,780 --> 00:01:35,129
trend, I guess, in terms of our

46
00:01:35,130 --> 00:01:36,959
population growth and that by the

47
00:01:36,960 --> 00:01:38,099
end of the century it's likely to be

48
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:39,029
11 billion people.

49
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:40,353
And so what that says is if

50
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:42,359
we want to save the world in terms

51
00:01:42,360 --> 00:01:44,669
of food and and other resources,

52
00:01:44,970 --> 00:01:46,829
we need to produce 50 per cent more

53
00:01:46,830 --> 00:01:47,701
than what we're currently producing

54
00:01:47,702 --> 00:01:48,122
now.

55
00:01:48,123 --> 00:01:49,123
Where will the 50

56
00:01:50,190 --> 00:01:51,856
per cent growth in food production

57
00:01:51,870 --> 00:01:52,870
come from?

58
00:01:53,220 --> 00:01:55,079
In Australia, arable land is

59
00:01:55,080 --> 00:01:56,219
a finite resource,

60
00:01:56,970 --> 00:01:58,950
but how we farm makes a difference.

61
00:01:59,470 --> 00:02:01,038
While larger farms are generally

62
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:02,572
more productive, adoption of

63
00:02:03,090 --> 00:02:04,949
technology and innovative farming

64
00:02:04,950 --> 00:02:06,809
practises is related to

65
00:02:06,810 --> 00:02:08,084
increased productivity and

66
00:02:08,669 --> 00:02:10,286
farmer profitability in the order

67
00:02:10,770 --> 00:02:11,770
of 20 per cent. if

68
00:02:12,780 --> 00:02:14,669
all farms performed this well,

69
00:02:14,880 --> 00:02:17,069
output would increase 18 per cent

70
00:02:17,070 --> 00:02:18,929
and farm incomes 24

71
00:02:18,930 --> 00:02:19,930
per cent.

72
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,130
While increasing farm size can drive

73
00:02:22,156 --> 00:02:23,185
economies of scale of

74
00:02:24,120 --> 00:02:25,949
key importance is matching

75
00:02:25,950 --> 00:02:27,175
inputs such as labour and

76
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:29,729
machinery to the size of

77
00:02:29,730 --> 00:02:31,053
a farm business to maximise

78
00:02:31,770 --> 00:02:32,946
profitability and rising

79
00:02:33,930 --> 00:02:35,547
productivity helps offset falling

80
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:37,180
terms of trade.

81
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:39,660
Where there's still a challenge is

82
00:02:39,670 --> 00:02:41,287
yield gap, the difference between

83
00:02:41,550 --> 00:02:43,619
potential and actual yield.

84
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:45,796
In most developing countries, it's

85
00:02:45,870 --> 00:02:47,370
greater than 50 per cent.

86
00:02:47,610 --> 00:02:49,439
And under that, for exporting

87
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:50,441
nations like Australia.

88
00:02:50,442 --> 00:02:52,739
Wider adoption

89
00:02:52,740 --> 00:02:54,509
of agricultural technologies will

90
00:02:54,510 --> 00:02:56,225
have the greatest impact on closing

91
00:02:56,610 --> 00:02:58,469
that gap, according to Professor

92
00:02:58,470 --> 00:02:59,459
Baillie.

93
00:02:59,460 --> 00:03:00,389
Well, I guess, you know, if you

94
00:03:00,390 --> 00:03:01,860
think back in history, there's

95
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:03,839
been waves of technologies being

96
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:05,699
developed and we can go back to what

97
00:03:05,700 --> 00:03:07,049
we call the first revolution, which

98
00:03:07,050 --> 00:03:08,610
was really around mechanisation.

99
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,358
But then there was the you might

100
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:11,939
recall, the Green Revolution and the

101
00:03:11,940 --> 00:03:13,469
Green Revolution was in the 60s.

102
00:03:13,470 --> 00:03:14,729
And that was the introduction of

103
00:03:14,730 --> 00:03:16,186
irrigation fertilisers and ag chem

104
00:03:18,090 --> 00:03:19,315
to get large increases in

105
00:03:19,710 --> 00:03:21,329
production. So we had something like

106
00:03:21,330 --> 00:03:22,769
three times increase in production

107
00:03:22,770 --> 00:03:23,770
through the Green Revolution.

108
00:03:25,470 --> 00:03:26,729
And then more recent times, we've

109
00:03:26,730 --> 00:03:28,304
had genetics and we've had

110
00:03:29,070 --> 00:03:30,269
precision agriculture and

111
00:03:30,270 --> 00:03:31,589
conservation farming and those sort

112
00:03:31,590 --> 00:03:33,305
of things. But the next wave or the

113
00:03:33,330 --> 00:03:34,680
fourth revolution is around,

114
00:03:35,430 --> 00:03:36,779
I guess, electronics, digital

115
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:38,669
agriculture, automation, robotics,

116
00:03:38,670 --> 00:03:39,670
those sorts of things.

117
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:42,180
Professor Baillie told delegates ag

118
00:03:42,190 --> 00:03:44,039
machinery manufacturers are not

119
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:45,509
only developing autonomous

120
00:03:45,510 --> 00:03:47,225
machinery, they are working towards

121
00:03:47,610 --> 00:03:49,919
making it possible for multibrand

122
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:51,390
machines to talk to each other

123
00:03:52,110 --> 00:03:53,110
via the cloud.

124
00:03:53,640 --> 00:03:54,665
And a visit to the Agritechnica

125
00:03:54,666 --> 00:03:56,580
Trade Show in Germany

126
00:03:56,850 --> 00:03:58,516
gave Professor Baillie a chance to

127
00:03:58,680 --> 00:04:00,444
see some of that latest agricultural

128
00:04:00,930 --> 00:04:01,930
technology.

129
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:04,169
And this is some common thinking

130
00:04:04,170 --> 00:04:06,479
around where tractors

131
00:04:06,750 --> 00:04:08,171
and machinery is likely to go

132
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:09,952
from a European perspective.

133
00:04:09,960 --> 00:04:11,039
And this is what they call their

134
00:04:11,040 --> 00:04:13,199
swarm farm initiative,

135
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,479
but also in particularly in Europe.

136
00:04:15,480 --> 00:04:16,979
There's a trend, if you like, to

137
00:04:16,980 --> 00:04:18,990
going towards renewable energy.

138
00:04:19,290 --> 00:04:20,969
And so the tractor here on the left,

139
00:04:20,970 --> 00:04:22,440
the blue tractor, is being run

140
00:04:22,920 --> 00:04:23,920
on biogas,

141
00:04:25,470 --> 00:04:26,730
biomethane, I should say.

142
00:04:27,090 --> 00:04:28,739
And the operating costs are about 30

143
00:04:28,740 --> 00:04:29,916
per cent less and 80 per

144
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,039
cent reduction in overall emissions.

145
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,363
So there's also a focus not

146
00:04:33,870 --> 00:04:35,489
only increasing our productivity on

147
00:04:35,490 --> 00:04:37,290
farm profitability,

148
00:04:37,650 --> 00:04:38,789
but also looking at some of the

149
00:04:38,790 --> 00:04:40,979
environmental benefits impacts

150
00:04:40,980 --> 00:04:41,980
as well.

151
00:04:42,090 --> 00:04:43,280
From what's happening in Europe,

152
00:04:43,291 --> 00:04:44,939
Professor Baillie's update

153
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:46,459
presentation moved on to global

154
00:04:47,100 --> 00:04:48,100
investment.

155
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,618
Agfunder is a US based

156
00:04:50,640 --> 00:04:52,159
investment platform that brings

157
00:04:52,290 --> 00:04:54,149
together venture capitalists and

158
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:55,522
innovation opportunities and

159
00:04:56,100 --> 00:04:58,079
annually reports on agrifood

160
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:00,089
investments globally by

161
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:01,756
grouping technologies into various

162
00:05:02,220 --> 00:05:03,220
categories.

163
00:05:03,510 --> 00:05:05,179
This provides a good sense of agtech

164
00:05:05,580 --> 00:05:06,805
developments and emerging

165
00:05:07,110 --> 00:05:08,110
technologies.

166
00:05:08,370 --> 00:05:09,865
Ag biotech is one of the categories

167
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:10,859
in particular.

168
00:05:10,860 --> 00:05:12,209
The thing I wanted to point out here

169
00:05:12,210 --> 00:05:13,210
is the development of microbiomes

170
00:05:14,450 --> 00:05:16,279
and large investments in

171
00:05:16,280 --> 00:05:17,682
this space around seed coating so

172
00:05:17,870 --> 00:05:19,286
that they identify

173
00:05:19,880 --> 00:05:21,919
naturally occurring microbiomes and

174
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:23,560
incorporate that into seed coatings

175
00:05:23,570 --> 00:05:25,236
to provide some sort of beneficial

176
00:05:25,910 --> 00:05:26,910
to the plant.

177
00:05:27,380 --> 00:05:29,389
Gene editing is also part of the mix

178
00:05:29,390 --> 00:05:30,390
in this space.

179
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:32,059
And this is where you're trying to

180
00:05:32,060 --> 00:05:33,628
get the the the plant to exhibit

181
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:35,389
different traits without actually

182
00:05:35,390 --> 00:05:37,470
genetically modifying the plant.

183
00:05:38,060 --> 00:05:39,824
Another category in this fourth wave

184
00:05:40,070 --> 00:05:41,344
world is the Agri-Business

185
00:05:42,050 --> 00:05:43,765
Marketplace, which is seeing farmer

186
00:05:44,060 --> 00:05:45,889
to farmer networking broaden.

187
00:05:46,460 --> 00:05:47,749
The interest in this category, if

188
00:05:47,750 --> 00:05:49,129
you like, is where a farmer might be

189
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:50,649
able to identify where they can

190
00:05:51,110 --> 00:05:53,240
get the cheapest, cheapest

191
00:05:53,330 --> 00:05:54,259
drum of Roundup.

192
00:05:54,260 --> 00:05:55,880
So a little bit like a Trivago

193
00:05:56,270 --> 00:05:57,642
for for identifying the best

194
00:05:58,370 --> 00:05:59,539
price, if you like, for ag

195
00:05:59,540 --> 00:06:00,439
chemicals.

196
00:06:00,440 --> 00:06:01,788
For farm management software, the

197
00:06:02,420 --> 00:06:03,428
focus at Agritechnica

198
00:06:04,310 --> 00:06:06,170
was on data collectiveness.

199
00:06:06,620 --> 00:06:08,139
Tractor manufacturers and third

200
00:06:08,420 --> 00:06:09,914
parties such as AgriRouter

201
00:06:10,640 --> 00:06:11,810
are leading the charge.

202
00:06:12,590 --> 00:06:14,011
In robotics, the way ahead is

203
00:06:14,300 --> 00:06:15,949
machines that will go beyond

204
00:06:15,950 --> 00:06:17,239
automating a process.

205
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:19,040
There's a couple of development

206
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:20,149
pathways here.

207
00:06:20,150 --> 00:06:22,399
One is around improving

208
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:23,389
the performance of current

209
00:06:23,390 --> 00:06:24,589
machinery, so adding more and more

210
00:06:24,590 --> 00:06:26,149
features to current machinery

211
00:06:26,510 --> 00:06:28,309
versus smaller multiple machines

212
00:06:28,310 --> 00:06:30,529
that are modular and and

213
00:06:30,830 --> 00:06:33,069
consist of robotic swarms.

214
00:06:33,440 --> 00:06:34,959
So the idea here is moving from

215
00:06:35,000 --> 00:06:36,000
highly automated

216
00:06:37,730 --> 00:06:39,889
machinery via artificial

217
00:06:39,890 --> 00:06:41,629
intelligence to fully autonomous

218
00:06:41,630 --> 00:06:42,630
systems.

219
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:44,599
Professor Baillie's presentation

220
00:06:44,780 --> 00:06:47,029
finished on novel farming systems,

221
00:06:47,270 --> 00:06:49,339
which looked at ways of intensifying

222
00:06:49,340 --> 00:06:50,149
production.

223
00:06:50,150 --> 00:06:51,379
If you look at some of the vertical

224
00:06:51,380 --> 00:06:52,570
farming operations that are

225
00:06:52,610 --> 00:06:54,619
currently underway, 95

226
00:06:54,620 --> 00:06:55,698
per cent less land, 95

227
00:06:56,540 --> 00:06:58,579
per cent less water and 10

228
00:06:58,580 --> 00:07:00,829
times more yield with no pesticides.

229
00:07:01,250 --> 00:07:03,079
And these systems are really highly

230
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:04,039
automated.

231
00:07:04,040 --> 00:07:05,804
What broadacre farmers can take from

232
00:07:05,990 --> 00:07:07,639
such novel farming systems

233
00:07:07,970 --> 00:07:09,389
is the recognition that agtech

234
00:07:09,860 --> 00:07:10,987
is changing farming and

235
00:07:11,750 --> 00:07:13,220
the type of people who support

236
00:07:13,700 --> 00:07:15,019
agriculture in the future.

237
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,029
Agtech companies in the US are

238
00:07:17,420 --> 00:07:18,439
interested in artificial

239
00:07:18,440 --> 00:07:20,106
intelligence, and they are looking

240
00:07:20,450 --> 00:07:21,450
to align

241
00:07:22,490 --> 00:07:23,929
their operations with skill sets

242
00:07:23,930 --> 00:07:25,129
that are normally seen in Silicon

243
00:07:25,130 --> 00:07:26,290
Valley in those places.

244
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,099
And so you're seeing a change of the

245
00:07:28,100 --> 00:07:30,169
sort of people that might be

246
00:07:30,620 --> 00:07:31,999
employed by those companies in the

247
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:32,899
future.

248
00:07:32,900 --> 00:07:34,369
But that also informs the sort of

249
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:35,440
people that might be employed on

250
00:07:35,450 --> 00:07:36,619
farm in the future as well.

251
00:07:36,980 --> 00:07:38,499
Professor Craig Bailey from the

252
00:07:38,750 --> 00:07:40,610
University of Southern Queensland.

253
00:07:41,090 --> 00:07:43,189
And this video is one in a series

254
00:07:43,190 --> 00:07:45,019
of update videos recorded

255
00:07:45,020 --> 00:07:47,449
at the 2020 GRDC

256
00:07:47,450 --> 00:07:48,968
