00:00:14,670 --> 00:00:19,900
hello and welcome to wholesome roots

3
00:00:16,930 --> 00:00:22,599
today I'm going to tell you my five

4
00:00:19,900 --> 00:00:25,060
reasons why quail are better than

5
00:00:22,599 --> 00:00:28,840
chickens on the homestead reason number

6
00:00:25,060 --> 00:00:32,529
one they're super easy these quail cages

7
00:00:28,840 --> 00:00:34,750
are designed for comfort and ease for

8
00:00:32,529 --> 00:00:38,140
both the birds and the bird handlers

9
00:00:34,750 --> 00:00:40,809
they are perfectly constructed so that

10
00:00:38,140 --> 00:00:42,550
you don't have to move them every day

11
00:00:40,809 --> 00:00:44,199
and like I have to do with the chicken

12
00:00:42,550 --> 00:00:45,970
tractors or if you're free-ranging

13
00:00:44,199 --> 00:00:48,010
letting them out every day putting them

14
00:00:45,970 --> 00:00:52,000
back in every day and you hear that

15
00:00:48,010 --> 00:00:54,610
that's a quail crow and I find it much

16
00:00:52,000 --> 00:01:01,149
more pleasing than a rooster crow reason

17
00:00:54,610 --> 00:01:04,600
number two it is much cleaner and neater

18
00:01:01,149 --> 00:01:07,750
with quail they mainly go in the bowl

19
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:10,560
and eat all of it out from inside the

20
00:01:07,750 --> 00:01:13,979
bowl occasionally some will splash out

21
00:01:10,560 --> 00:01:17,289
my but my Ducks make quick work of that

22
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:19,500
and the beauty of it is they don't leave

23
00:01:17,289 --> 00:01:23,170
any behind and waste it like chickens do

24
00:01:19,500 --> 00:01:24,850
it's also a much smaller volume of food

25
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:26,770
to feed quail than it is to feed

26
00:01:24,850 --> 00:01:29,380
chickens those things will keep eating

27
00:01:26,770 --> 00:01:31,270
forever and ever-- sometimes and they

28
00:01:29,380 --> 00:01:34,150
always seem like they're starving the

29
00:01:31,270 --> 00:01:35,580
quail seem content with a small scoop of

30
00:01:34,150 --> 00:01:39,040
food every morning

31
00:01:35,580 --> 00:01:41,409
then there's the cleanup being able to

32
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:44,079
consolidate all of the manure in one

33
00:01:41,409 --> 00:01:47,320
place and it's a dry manure it's not wet

34
00:01:44,079 --> 00:01:49,810
and soupy like chicken manure is so it's

35
00:01:47,320 --> 00:01:53,100
very easy to shovel this add it to your

36
00:01:49,810 --> 00:01:57,100
compost or use it for your garden

37
00:01:53,100 --> 00:01:59,079
remember always age and compost your

38
00:01:57,100 --> 00:02:02,710
manure before using it in your garden

39
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:04,479
for vegetables with chickens you'll end

40
00:02:02,710 --> 00:02:06,939
up with coop almost anywhere especially

41
00:02:04,479 --> 00:02:09,399
if they're free-range on your porch on

42
00:02:06,939 --> 00:02:11,470
your sidewalk in between your toes when

43
00:02:09,399 --> 00:02:15,310
you walk barefoot I'm not a fan of that

44
00:02:11,470 --> 00:02:17,739
but with the quail it's easy simple and

45
00:02:15,310 --> 00:02:21,489
ready to be made into compost for my

46
00:02:17,739 --> 00:02:24,220
garden fourth is speed the speed in

47
00:02:21,489 --> 00:02:26,349
which it takes to hatch out the eggs is

48
00:02:24,220 --> 00:02:28,480
some of the fastest there are only three

49
00:02:26,349 --> 00:02:30,849
weeks to hatch whereas chicken

50
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,190
and ducks and turkey could be much

51
00:02:30,849 --> 00:02:38,560
longer 21 to 28 days for them but with

52
00:02:36,190 --> 00:02:41,379
quail you have new babies in three weeks

53
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:44,140
then when during the brooding process of

54
00:02:41,379 --> 00:02:47,349
raising these chicks they are full-grown

55
00:02:44,140 --> 00:02:50,200
at six weeks you can stretch them at six

56
00:02:47,349 --> 00:02:50,860
weeks old they begin laying eggs at six

57
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:53,739
weeks old

58
00:02:50,860 --> 00:02:56,349
it is the fastest turnaround for meat in

59
00:02:53,739 --> 00:03:00,700
eggs than any animal that I know of for

60
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:02,560
homestead use and at ten to twelve weeks

61
00:03:00,700 --> 00:03:04,690
they're ready to harvest

62
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:07,030
whereas chickens you have to wait six

63
00:03:04,690 --> 00:03:11,549
months or more sometimes for the

64
00:03:07,030 --> 00:03:15,160
heritage breeds I find it a much easier

65
00:03:11,549 --> 00:03:19,780
circumstances to have these quick

66
00:03:15,160 --> 00:03:24,420
turnaround easy food in our kitchen so

67
00:03:19,780 --> 00:03:27,220
number five is the easy one

68
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:29,049
sustainability sustainability is very

69
00:03:27,220 --> 00:03:32,980
important to us on our homestead and

70
00:03:29,049 --> 00:03:36,069
quail are far more superior sustainable

71
00:03:32,980 --> 00:03:37,540
resource they don't waste as much they

72
00:03:36,069 --> 00:03:40,810
don't take as much time out of our day

73
00:03:37,540 --> 00:03:43,750
to take care of they hardly have any

74
00:03:40,810 --> 00:03:46,750
work that we need to do outside of feed

75
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:49,120
water and gathering the eggs it makes it

76
00:03:46,750 --> 00:03:51,160
quite easy for us to have a sustainable

77
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:57,040
meat source and egg source on our

78
00:03:51,160 --> 00:04:00,280
homestead that right there that's my

79
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:02,799
bonus reason why quail are better than

80
00:04:00,280 --> 00:04:04,180
chickens granted you don't have to have

81
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:06,760
a rooster but if you're planning on

82
00:04:04,180 --> 00:04:09,880
hatching out fertile eggs having a

83
00:04:06,760 --> 00:04:13,209
rooster is a necessity and the rooster

84
00:04:09,880 --> 00:04:18,760
crow for quail is much more pleasant and

85
00:04:13,209 --> 00:04:20,380
soft that can get on your nerves so tell

86
00:04:18,760 --> 00:04:22,630
me what are your reasons for keeping

87
00:04:20,380 --> 00:04:25,539
quail how do you find them to be

88
00:04:22,630 --> 00:04:27,699
superior to other poultry and if you

89
00:04:25,539 --> 00:04:29,080
haven't started keeping quail why not

90
00:04:27,699 --> 00:04:31,210
what are you waiting for I hope that

91
00:04:29,080 --> 00:04:33,760
this video gives you some insight in

92
00:04:31,210 --> 00:04:36,310
hope and gives you an idea of how easy

93
00:04:33,760 --> 00:04:38,220
it is to take care of quail and how

94
00:04:36,310 --> 00:04:41,879
sustainable they are for your homestead
