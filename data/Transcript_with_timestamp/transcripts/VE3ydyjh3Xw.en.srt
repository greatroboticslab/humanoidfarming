00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,559
and we're excited to share with you 10

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,200
of our favorite vegetables to plant that

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:13,280
will really feed you

6
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:14,960
winter squash which includes pumpkins

7
00:00:13,280 --> 00:00:17,119
butternuts and buttercups and all

8
00:00:14,960 --> 00:00:19,199
different kinds and shapes and sizes of

9
00:00:17,119 --> 00:00:22,000
squash that you can grow to store over

10
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:24,400
the winter are an incredible staple crop

11
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:26,400
not only is the fruit edible but the

12
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:27,599
seeds are edible and nutritious too

13
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:29,840
what's more

14
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:31,679
they sprawl most varieties sprawl and

15
00:00:29,840 --> 00:00:33,280
cover a ton of ground so you can plant

16
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:35,280
them on the edge of your garden they'll

17
00:00:33,280 --> 00:00:36,880
even climb up trees in some cases and

18
00:00:35,280 --> 00:00:39,040
they can take up space that you wouldn't

19
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,480
otherwise be able to cultivate perhaps

20
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:45,800
one of the best things is that they're

21
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:45,800
delicious in sweet and savory dishes

22
00:00:46,320 --> 00:00:50,000
beans are a super rewarding crop to grow

23
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:52,079
in part because they fix their own

24
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:54,079
nitrogen so that means they bring

25
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,920
nitrogen into the soil and they can

26
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:57,600
thrive even in poorer soils there are

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:59,199
lots of different kinds of beans to grow

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,039
some for dry beans like the ones i'm

29
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:04,720
holding in these jars and some for snap

30
00:01:01,039 --> 00:01:06,720
beans or fresh bean pods like these ones

31
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:08,560
there are also cow peas and garbanzo

32
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,479
beans and lots of different kinds that

33
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,720
grow well in different kinds of climates

34
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:14,479
dry beans store well dried in jars like

35
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
this and green beans can be pickled

36
00:01:14,479 --> 00:01:17,600
frozen or canned

37
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:24,479
sweet potatoes can produce a huge amount

38
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,479
of nourishing filling food that stores

39
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,880
well after they're cured all through the

40
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,960
winter they also can thrive even in poor

41
00:01:28,880 --> 00:01:33,119
soils that are low in nitrogen

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:35,040
and they're less susceptible to fungal

43
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:36,720
and viral diseases than white potatoes

44
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:38,960
which makes them a really great option

45
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:40,560
especially in warm wet climates one

46
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,399
thing to keep in mind is that they won't

47
00:01:40,560 --> 00:01:44,399
mature if it's very cool if you don't

48
00:01:42,399 --> 00:01:46,720
have a long hot summer so they're better

49
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:48,799
for warmer areas and less good for cool

50
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:52,079
areas there are so many varieties to

51
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,079
choose from and grow in your garden

52
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:56,399
greens are full of nutrients and an

53
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,040
awesome thing to grow because they

54
00:01:56,399 --> 00:02:01,200
mature relatively quickly they've become

55
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:03,360
kind of the center of a lot of people's

56
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,119
meals these days instead of just being a

57
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:07,040
side dish often times it'll be

58
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,399
everything over a bed of lettuce or over

59
00:02:07,040 --> 00:02:10,479
a bunch of kale

60
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,440
this is kale which i love to grow this

61
00:02:10,479 --> 00:02:16,239
is natalie which is an awesome variety i

62
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:19,040
also like to grow cabbage i like to grow

63
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,680
chard beet greens are awesome and then a

64
00:02:19,040 --> 00:02:23,599
lot of edible weeds are fabulous magenta

65
00:02:21,680 --> 00:02:26,640
spring is a type of lamb's quarters

66
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:28,480
chickweed is awesome callaloo

67
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:32,000
and then all sorts of cover crops like

68
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:32,000
winter peas can also be eaten

69
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,040
corn is another incredible staple crop

70
00:02:35,440 --> 00:02:38,879
when i'm talking about corn as a staple

71
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:41,120
crop i'm talking about field corn or

72
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:42,800
grain corn like i'm holding here sweet

73
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,959
corn is really more of a snack the

74
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:46,720
amount of food that you can produce with

75
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,720
corn and even a small garden is

76
00:02:46,720 --> 00:02:51,280
incredible and it stores really well

77
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:53,040
it's also the only grain that's easy to

78
00:02:51,280 --> 00:02:55,120
process on a small scale you don't need

79
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:56,720
any machines to process it and when it

80
00:02:55,120 --> 00:02:58,720
comes to heirloom or traditional

81
00:02:56,720 --> 00:03:01,120
varieties of corn there's an incredible

82
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,519
diversity of colors flavors textures

83
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,800
stories and it's much more nutritious

84
00:03:03,519 --> 00:03:06,800
than anything you could buy in the store

85
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:14,560
zucchini and other summer squash are

86
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:17,840
enormously productive we've had plants

87
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:20,400
that yield well over 20 pounds per plant

88
00:03:17,840 --> 00:03:22,959
that's a lot of food it's not just

89
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:25,920
boring yucky food it's delicious food i

90
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:28,319

92
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:32,480

stir fries they are so incredibly

94
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:36,560
versatile we do have some pest issues

95
00:03:34,959 --> 00:03:38,720
with them here but

96
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:41,920
it's just amazing how much food they

97
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,920
produce even so

98
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,280
tomatoes are an amazing thing to grow in

99
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,680

100
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:52,959

105
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,200
be like yeah these are from my tomatoes

106
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:07,439
that i grew in my garden

107

108
00:04:07,439 --> 00:04:12,959
you can really get a lot of food from

112
00:04:17,680 --> 00:04:23,919
garlic is a really fun and easy thing to

113

grow you take one clove put it in the

114
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:28,880
ground in the fall and then in the late

spring you have a whole head of garlic

116
00:04:28,880 --> 00:04:33,600
all with relatively little labor in

117
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:36,840
between it's not only a food but it's

118
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,000
also a medicine it's anti-fungal and

119
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,840
antibacterial and it makes other foods

120
00:04:40,000 --> 00:04:43,840
taste really fabulous

121
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:50,560
potatoes also known as the enemy of

122
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:52,320
hunger by chilean poet pablo neruda and

123
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:54,160
he knew what he was talking about

124
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:56,160
they're an incredibly productive storage

125
00:04:54,160 --> 00:04:57,840
craft that even your four-year-old and

126
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:59,840
your grandma will be familiar with and

garden they grow in even cool moist

131
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,280
soils and they're a really good option

132
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:10,479
especially for northern climates and

133
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:12,400
places where

134
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:13,919
other storage crops like sweet potatoes

135
00:05:12,400 --> 00:05:16,479
just won't hack it because there's not

136
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:16,479
enough peat

137
00:05:16,960 --> 00:05:23,039
other root crops can really add variety

138
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:26,960
to your meals beets daikon

139
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:28,720
turnips and parsnips are foods that grow

140
00:05:26,960 --> 00:05:31,600
in the cool weather and they can

141
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:34,240
generally be stored really well beets

142
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:37,039
and turnips can be stored just in sand

143
00:05:34,240 --> 00:05:40,320
or in sawdust and daikons can be

144
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:43,520
fermented to make fabulous kimchi

145
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:45,199
