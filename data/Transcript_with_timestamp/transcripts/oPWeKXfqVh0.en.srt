00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:05,839
hi Welcome to our Channel today we are

2
00:00:03,320 --> 00:00:07,799
good to know about types of farming and

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:11,200
also we show you which method is better

4
00:00:07,799 --> 00:00:13,160
for us so let's start the video

5
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:16,199
Hydroponics farming is a method of

6
00:00:13,160 --> 00:00:18,439
cultivating plants without using soil

7
00:00:16,199 --> 00:00:20,359
with deep water culture the plant roots

8
00:00:18,439 --> 00:00:23,000
are suspended in a nutrient-rich

9
00:00:20,359 --> 00:00:25,240
solution that is continuously

10
00:00:23,000 --> 00:00:27,199
oxygenated the plants are grown in net

11
00:00:25,240 --> 00:00:29,759
pots that are suspended over the

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,599
nutrient solution allowing the roots to

13
00:00:29,759 --> 00:00:34,480
hang down and absorb the nutrients

14
00:00:32,599 --> 00:00:37,079
except that the nutrient solution is

15
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,120
recirculated through the system the

16
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,000
water is pumped from the reservoir to

17
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,960
the plants and then back to the

18
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:46,440
reservoir reducing waste and water

19
00:00:43,960 --> 00:00:48,719
consumption the nutrient film technique

20
00:00:46,440 --> 00:00:51,199
is a hydroponic system that involves a

21
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:52,559
shallow tray or channel that is

22
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:55,120
continuously flooded with a

23
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:57,520
nutrient-rich solution the plants are

24
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:59,160
grown in net pots placed in the tray

25
00:00:57,520 --> 00:01:00,519
allowing the roots to dangle in the

26
00:00:59,160 --> 00:01:03,719
solution

27
00:01:00,519 --> 00:01:06,000
then EB and flow is a hydroponic system

28
00:01:03,719 --> 00:01:08,680
where the plants are grown in a tray or

29
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:12,119
container filled with a growing medium

30
00:01:08,680 --> 00:01:13,960
like perlite or coconut choir the tray

31
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:16,560
is periodically flooded with a

32
00:01:13,960 --> 00:01:18,119
nutrient-rich solution and then drained

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,920
back into the

34
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:23,159
reservoir drip irrigation is a

35
00:01:20,920 --> 00:01:25,560
hydroponic system where the plants are

36
00:01:23,159 --> 00:01:29,159
grown in a growing medium like cocoa

37
00:01:25,560 --> 00:01:31,920
choir or rock wool the nutrient-rich

38
00:01:29,159 --> 00:01:34,520
solution is pumped from a reservoir and

39
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,880
dripped onto the growing medium allowing

40
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:39,880
the plants to absorb the

41
00:01:36,880 --> 00:01:41,920
nutrients aeroponics is a hydroponic

42
00:01:39,880 --> 00:01:45,520
system where the plants are grown in a

43
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:47,840
chamber with no growing medium instead

44
00:01:45,520 --> 00:01:49,280
the roots are suspended in the air and

45
00:01:47,840 --> 00:01:53,040
periodically sprayed with a

46
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:54,880
nutrient-rich Mist in hydroponic system

47
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:57,960
the plant roots are suspended in a

48
00:01:54,880 --> 00:02:00,880
growing medium like coconut choir or

49
00:01:57,960 --> 00:02:03,320
pret the nutrient rich solution is

50
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:06,360
stored in a reservoir and delivered to

51
00:02:03,320 --> 00:02:09,160
the plants through a wick now coming to

52
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:11,440
the traditional farming methods they

53
00:02:09,160 --> 00:02:13,840
have been used for thousands of years

54
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,720
dating back to ancient civilizations

55
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:19,280
such as the Egyptians and the Mayans the

56
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:22,040
earliest known agricultural practices

57
00:02:19,280 --> 00:02:23,840
were based on slash and burn techniques

58
00:02:22,040 --> 00:02:27,200
where Fields were cleared by burning

59
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:29,480
vegitation and then planted with crops

60
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,440
these early farmers also used simple

61
00:02:29,480 --> 00:02:33,080
tools

62
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:36,080
like hose and shovels to cultivate their

63
00:02:33,080 --> 00:02:38,519
land despite changes in technology and

64
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:41,599
methods over time many traditional

65
00:02:38,519 --> 00:02:43,560
farming practices remain popular today

66
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:45,519
particularly in developing countries

67
00:02:43,560 --> 00:02:47,360
where they are often more accessible

68
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:50,760
than modern equipment and

69
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:52,920
chemicals examples include using compost

70
00:02:50,760 --> 00:02:55,280
instead of synthetic fertilizer

71
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:57,760
intercropping different crops together

72
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,599
and using natural pest control methods

73
00:02:57,760 --> 00:03:02,400
like planting companion plants there are

74
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:04,239
several types of traditional farming

75
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:06,840
methods that have been used for

76
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:07,519
Centuries by different cultures around

77
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,280
the

78
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:13,120
world another type is shifting

79
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:15,799
cultivation which involves clearing Land

80
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,159
by burning vegetation and then planting

81
00:03:15,799 --> 00:03:21,599
crops in the cleared area this technique

82
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:24,760
is commonly practiced in tropical

83
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:27,640
regions next is horiculture that refers

84
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:30,360
to the growing of fruits vegetables and

85
00:03:27,640 --> 00:03:33,040
other crops on an individual or family

86
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:35,720
plot it is often associated with

87
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,760
subsistence agriculture after that

88
00:03:35,720 --> 00:03:38,760
another type of traditional farming is

89
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:41,599
permanent

90
00:03:38,760 --> 00:03:44,040
cultivation this involves using tools

91
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:47,280
such as plows and Harrows to break up

92
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:49,400
soil and plant crops over multiple years

93
00:03:47,280 --> 00:03:51,879
this method requires more labor than

94
00:03:49,400 --> 00:03:52,920
shifting cultivation but can lead to

95
00:03:51,879 --> 00:03:57,040
higher

96
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:59,120
yields then agroforestry is another type

97
00:03:57,040 --> 00:04:01,840
this involves combining agricultural

98
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:04,840
crops with with trees and other plants

99
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:07,760
to improve soil health and increase

100
00:04:04,840 --> 00:04:10,480
productivity Hydroponics is using just

101
00:04:07,760 --> 00:04:12,920
nutrient enriched water to grow plants

102
00:04:10,480 --> 00:04:14,879
instead of traditional soil while

103
00:04:12,920 --> 00:04:17,359
conventional farming has been nurturing

104
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:19,680
Humanity with crops planted directly

105
00:04:17,359 --> 00:04:24,000
onto the Earth for countless centuries

106
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:26,120
now in Hydroponics no soil is needed

107
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:28,720
plants are grown in a nutrient-rich

108
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,639
solution this allows farmer to control

109
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:33,880
exactly which Nutri nutrients the plants

110
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:36,280
receive and in what amounts one also

111
00:04:33,880 --> 00:04:40,039
avoids the risk of soil born diseases

112
00:04:36,280 --> 00:04:42,639
and pests secondly hydroponic systems

113
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,000
can produce harvests at a faster rate

114
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,600
and higher

115
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:49,400
volume with the ability to manipulate

116
00:04:46,600 --> 00:04:52,240
factors like temperature pH and

117
00:04:49,400 --> 00:04:55,280
nutrients hydroponic farmers are able to

118
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,520
maximize growth interestingly

119
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:59,440
Hydroponics provides yearr round food

120
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,199
production regardless of weather

121
00:04:59,440 --> 00:05:03,320
conditions

122
00:05:00,199 --> 00:05:05,440
or Seasons if we compare Hydroponics

123
00:05:03,320 --> 00:05:08,479
with traditional farming we come to the

124
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:11,840
conclusion that Hydroponics allows us to

125
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:15,280
control variables like light temperature

126
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:17,639
pH and nutrients to optimize plant

127
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,080
growth traditional farming on the other

128
00:05:17,639 --> 00:05:22,600
hand leaves plants at the mercy of the

129
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:25,360
elements inclement weather and changing

130
00:05:22,600 --> 00:05:28,039
seasons can negatively impact Crop

131
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:30,639
Production with Hydroponics we can

132
00:05:28,039 --> 00:05:32,600
produce more crops in less space

133
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:34,680
plants can be stacked vertically and

134
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:37,720
grown closer together since we don't

135
00:05:34,680 --> 00:05:39,919
need soil this results in higher yields

136
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:42,160
per square foot while traditional

137
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:45,000
farming still produces the vast majority

138
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:48,000
of the world's food Hydroponics may help

139
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,280
address food shortages as populations

140
00:05:48,000 --> 00:05:54,199
rise Hydroponics requires less land and

141
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:57,600
water since we recirculate nutrient

142
00:05:54,199 --> 00:06:00,280
Solutions there's also no soil runoff or

143
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:02,960
erosion this makes hydroponic a more

144
00:06:00,280 --> 00:06:06,840
sustainable option especially in Aid

145
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:09,840
regions or dense urban areas however

146
00:06:06,840 --> 00:06:12,720
Hydroponics does require energy to power

147
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:15,000
equipment like lights pumps and climate

148
00:06:12,720 --> 00:06:18,000
control systems and the nutrient

149
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:20,120
Solutions still require raw materials to

150
00:06:18,000 --> 00:06:23,199
produce the benefits of traditional

151
00:06:20,120 --> 00:06:26,240
farming include lower startup costs

152
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:28,919
better soil health and a more diverse

153
00:06:26,240 --> 00:06:31,680
ecosystem however traditional farming

154
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:34,400
often requires more land and labor and

155
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:37,720
can be affected by weather conditions

156
00:06:34,400 --> 00:06:41,120
hydroponic farming while often more

157
00:06:37,720 --> 00:06:43,639
expensive offers faster growth rates

158
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:46,199
increased crop yields and Water

159
00:06:43,639 --> 00:06:49,479
Conservation the age-old debate

160
00:06:46,199 --> 00:06:52,560
traditional versus hydroponic farming

161
00:06:49,479 --> 00:06:55,319
both systems have their advantages and

162
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:58,120
disadvantages traditional farming often

163
00:06:55,319 --> 00:07:00,759
known as soil-based farming uses soil to

164
00:06:58,120 --> 00:07:03,639
cultivate crops it's a tried and true

165
00:07:00,759 --> 00:07:06,440
strategy that has been around for ages

166
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:08,479
the advantages include decreased prices

167
00:07:06,440 --> 00:07:11,639
and the opportunity to grow a diverse

168
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:15,000
range of crops however it can be

169
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:17,720
influenced by weather soil quality and

170
00:07:15,000 --> 00:07:20,400
pests hydroponic farming on the other

171
00:07:17,720 --> 00:07:23,680
hand cultivates crops in nutrient-rich

172
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:25,720
Solutions rather than soil it is a more

173
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,520
controlled environment that enables for

174
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,360
accurate monitoring of plant nutrients

175
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:33,440
and water levels

176
00:07:30,360 --> 00:07:36,240
Pros include higher agricultural yields

177
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:39,759
less water consumption and faster growth

178
00:07:36,240 --> 00:07:40,840
rates however it requires a considerable

179
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:43,440
initial

180
00:07:40,840 --> 00:07:45,120
expenditure to conclude traditional

181
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,080
farming may be better suited to large

182
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:50,759
scale outdoor operations with a focus on

183
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:53,680
soil health and cultural practices as

184
00:07:50,759 --> 00:07:55,639
well as abundant acreage hydroponic

185
00:07:53,680 --> 00:07:58,919
farming may be advantageous in urban

186
00:07:55,639 --> 00:08:01,879
areas poor soil conditions or locations

187
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:03,960
with limited land and water it also

188
00:08:01,879 --> 00:08:06,000
provides greater control over growing

189
00:08:03,960 --> 00:08:09,479
conditions which can lead to faster

190
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:11,919
growth and larger yields ultimately the

191
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,000
best option is determined by your unique

192
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:17,159
