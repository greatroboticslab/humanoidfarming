1
00:00:00,199 --> 00:00:03,560
have you ever wondered how we could make

2
00:00:01,640 --> 00:00:06,120
our food production more sustainable

3
00:00:03,560 --> 00:00:08,080
efficient and eco-friendly in the Quest

4
00:00:06,120 --> 00:00:10,400
for sustainable farming one solution

5
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:13,120
stands out as a promising Contender

6
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:14,879
aquaponics this isn't just a fancy term

7
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,279
it's a revolutionary concept that

8
00:00:14,879 --> 00:00:19,279
combines the best of Two Worlds

9
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:21,039
aquaculture the practice of raising

10
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,439
aquatic animals like fish and

11
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:25,840
hydroponics the method of growing plants

12
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:28,000
without soil imagine having a closed

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,439
loop system where the waste produced by

14
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:32,840
the fish serves as an organic nutrient

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:34,719
source for the plants in return the

16
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:36,280
plants naturally filter the water

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:38,840
creating a clean environment for the

18
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:40,879
fish to thrive this isn't just a win-win

19
00:00:38,840 --> 00:00:42,559
situation for the fish and the plants

20
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:44,320
it's a Triumph for us too with

21
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:46,640
aquaponics we can produce more food

22
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:48,800
using less water in space and without

23
00:00:46,640 --> 00:00:51,320
the need for harmful fertilizers or

24
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:53,000
pesticides aquaponics is an Innovative

25
00:00:51,320 --> 00:00:55,640
method that could revolutionize The Way

26
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:57,600
We Grow our food but how does aquaponics

27
00:00:55,640 --> 00:01:00,160
work you might ask well it's quite

28
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:02,480
simple and ingenious at its core

29
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:04,920
aquaponics is a marriage of aquaculture

30
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,760
and hydroponics aquaculture is the

31
00:01:04,920 --> 00:01:09,040
practice of raising fish or other

32
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,479
aquatic creatures while Hydroponics is

33
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,840
the cultivation of plants in water so

34
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:16,759
aquaponics combines these two in a

35
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:18,960
symbiotic environment the system begins

36
00:01:16,759 --> 00:01:21,439
with the fish they are fed a diet and

37
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:23,400
naturally they produce waste now this

38
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:25,600
waste might seem like a problem but in

39
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:28,159
an aquaponic system it's a part of the

40
00:01:25,600 --> 00:01:30,439
solution you see Fish waste is rich in

41
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:32,600
ammonia which is harmful to the fish but

42
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:34,960
beneficial to the plants here's where

43
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:37,439
the magic happens the water filled with

44
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:39,200
the fish's waste is pumped from the fish

45
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:41,720
tank to the grow beds where the plants

46
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:43,960
are housed these plants don't just

47
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,680
absorb the ammonia filled water they are

48
00:01:43,960 --> 00:01:48,200
in a symbiotic relationship with

49
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,200
bacteria that reside in the grow bed

50
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,520
these bacteria play a crucial role in

51
00:01:50,200 --> 00:01:54,280
the aquaponic system they break down the

52
00:01:52,520 --> 00:01:57,000
ammonia from the fish waste into

53
00:01:54,280 --> 00:01:59,360
nitrates nitrates are a form of nitrogen

54
00:01:57,000 --> 00:02:01,680
that plants can absorb and use to grow

55
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:03,799
once the bacteria have done their job

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:06,000
the plants then absorb these nitrates

57
00:02:03,799 --> 00:02:08,599
effectively filtering the water but the

58
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,679
plants don't just take they give back

59
00:02:08,599 --> 00:02:12,760
too once the plants have absorbed the

60
00:02:10,679 --> 00:02:14,920
nitrates the water is now clean and is

61
00:02:12,760 --> 00:02:16,920
returned back to the fish tank the fish

62
00:02:14,920 --> 00:02:19,440
now have fresh clean water to live in

63
00:02:16,920 --> 00:02:21,720
and the cycle begins a new this is the

64
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,080
beauty of an aquaponic system it's a

65
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,800
closed loop system that mimics Nature's

66
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:28,519
Way of recycling waste it uses no soil

67
00:02:26,800 --> 00:02:30,440
requires less water than traditional

68
00:02:28,519 --> 00:02:32,480
farming and it's sustainable it's a

69
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:35,160
win-win situation for both the fish and

70
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:37,080
the plants so in essence aquaponics

71
00:02:35,160 --> 00:02:39,519
creates a symbiotic environment where

72
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,280
fish and plants help each other grow now

73
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:42,920
that we understand how aquaponics works

74
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:45,599
you may be wondering what are its

75
00:02:42,920 --> 00:02:47,239
benefits well there are a plethora of

76
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:49,280
benefits that come from adopting

77
00:02:47,239 --> 00:02:50,920
aquaponics first and foremost this

78
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:52,519
method of farming is an absolute

79
00:02:50,920 --> 00:02:54,879
Champion when it comes to water

80
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,200
conservation traditional farming methods

81
00:02:54,879 --> 00:02:59,280
can use up to 10 times more water than

82
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:01,400
aquaponics this is because the water in

83
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:03,920
an aquaponic IC System is constantly

84
00:03:01,400 --> 00:03:05,760
recycled and reused making it an

85
00:03:03,920 --> 00:03:08,080
excellent solution for Regions where

86
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:09,640
water is scarce another advantage of

87
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,159
aquaponics is that it produces

88
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,680
completely organic produce since the

89
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,000
health of both the fish and the plants

90
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,400
are interdependent the use of synthetic

91
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,159
chemicals is not an option this means

92
00:03:18,400 --> 00:03:22,239
that the vegetables grown are not only

93
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,360
healthier for consumption but also taste

94
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:26,400
better then comes the aspect of high

95
00:03:24,360 --> 00:03:28,159
yield the closed loop system of

96
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:29,799
aquaponics creates a symbiotic

97
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:32,840
relationship between the fish and the

98
00:03:29,799 --> 00:03:34,720
plants resulting in a surplus of both

99
00:03:32,840 --> 00:03:36,920
the fish provide the necessary nutrients

100
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:39,080
for the plants and in turn the plants

101
00:03:36,920 --> 00:03:41,680
clean the water for the fish this

102
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:43,760
results in Faster growth rates for both

103
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,239
leading to a higher yield in a shorter

104
00:03:43,760 --> 00:03:48,720
time frame a lesser known but equally

105
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:51,239
important benefit of aquaponics is its

106
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:53,760
potential to reduce our carbon footprint

107
00:03:51,239 --> 00:03:55,920
by sourcing food locally we can greatly

108
00:03:53,760 --> 00:03:58,000
reduce the energy and resources required

109
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:00,120
for transportation this is where

110
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:02,040
aquaponic shines as it can be elemented

111
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,239
in urban settings turning even the

112
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:07,079
smallest rooftop or backyard into a

113
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,760
productive green Oasis and finally

114
00:04:07,079 --> 00:04:11,280
aquaponics promotes local food

115
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,599
production this not only ensures fresher

116
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:15,120
tastier produce but also boosts local

117
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:17,600
economies and creates a sense of

118
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:19,680
community plus it's a fantastic way to

119
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:21,919
educate people about sustainable farming

120
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:24,479
practices and the importance of food

121
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:26,240
security with these benefits aquaponics

122
00:04:24,479 --> 00:04:28,800
is indeed a GameChanger in sustainable

123
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:30,880
farming intrigued by the concept and

124
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,639
benefits of aquaponic onics here's a

125
00:04:30,880 --> 00:04:35,320
simple guide on how you can start your

126
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
own aquaponic system setting up an

127
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:38,919
aquaponic system may seem like a

128
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
daunting task but it's simpler than you

129
00:04:38,919 --> 00:04:43,440
might think all it takes is a bit of

130
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:46,160
understanding and the right materials at

131
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:49,120
its core an aquaponic system consists of

132
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:51,840
three main components a fish tank a grow

133
00:04:49,120 --> 00:04:53,800
bed and a pump the fish tank is where

134
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,560
your fish will live and it's also the

135
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:57,800
source of the nutrients your plants will

136
00:04:55,560 --> 00:04:59,720
need the type of fish you choose will

137
00:04:57,800 --> 00:05:02,400
depend on your local climate and your

138
00:04:59,720 --> 00:05:04,720
personal preference tilapia is a popular

139
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:07,120
choice due to its hearty nature and fast

140
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:09,919
growth rate but other fish like carp

141
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,360
perch or catfish can also be used it's

142
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,240
important to remember that the health of

143
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:16,520
your fish is crucial to the success of

144
00:05:13,240 --> 00:05:18,759
your aquaponic system so Choose Wisely

145
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:21,039
next up the grow bed this is where your

146
00:05:18,759 --> 00:05:23,080
plants will Thrive the grow bed needs to

147
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:25,160
be a shallow watertight container filled

148
00:05:23,080 --> 00:05:27,400
with a suitable growing medium clay

149
00:05:25,160 --> 00:05:29,000
Pebbles are a popular choice as they're

150
00:05:27,400 --> 00:05:31,280
lightweight and allow for good water

151
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:33,440
flow when it comes to choosing plants

152
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:35,560
leafy greens like lettuce and spinach do

153
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,800
particularly well but you can also try

154
00:05:35,560 --> 00:05:40,840
tomatoes cucumbers or even herbs like

155
00:05:37,800 --> 00:05:43,120
basil or mint the final component is the

156
00:05:40,840 --> 00:05:45,120
pump this is what circulates the water

157
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:46,680
from the fish tank to the grow bed

158
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:48,440
you'll need a submersible pump one

159
00:05:46,680 --> 00:05:50,280
that's powerful enough to move the water

160
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:52,680
but not so powerful it disturbs your

161
00:05:50,280 --> 00:05:54,639
fish the pump is also responsible for

162
00:05:52,680 --> 00:05:56,919
oxygenating the water which is vital for

163
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:59,080
both fish and plants now let's get down

164
00:05:56,919 --> 00:06:01,039
to setting up your system start by

165
00:05:59,080 --> 00:06:03,600
placing your fish tank on a sturdy

166
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:06,759
surface next position your grow Bed

167
00:06:03,600 --> 00:06:08,639
above the fish tank ensuring it's secure

168
00:06:06,759 --> 00:06:11,000
install your pump in the fish tank with

169
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,599
a pipe leading to the grow bed fill the

170
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,960
fish tank with water and turn on the

171
00:06:12,599 --> 00:06:16,720
pump to check the water flow once you're

172
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:19,280
happy with the setup you can add your

173
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,400
fish remember to give your fish time to

174
00:06:19,280 --> 00:06:23,840
acclimate to their new home before

175
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:25,759
adding plants to the grow bed once your

176
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,880
fish are settled in you can start adding

177
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:29,880
plants to the grow bed start with a few

178
00:06:27,880 --> 00:06:32,120
plants and gradually increase the number

179
00:06:29,880 --> 00:06:34,120
as your system matures keep an eye on

180
00:06:32,120 --> 00:06:36,400
your system monitoring the health of

181
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:38,199
your fish and plants it's a delicate

182
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,199
balance but once you've got it right

183
00:06:38,199 --> 00:06:43,560
you'll be rewarded with a thriving

184
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:45,000
aquaponic system with these steps you're

185
00:06:43,560 --> 00:06:47,680
ready to start your journey in

186
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:49,919
sustainable farming through aquaponics

to wrap up let's revisit the wonders of

188
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,599
aquaponics this Innovative system

189
00:06:52,000 --> 00:06:56,039
represents a harmonious blend of

190
00:06:53,599 --> 00:06:57,720
aquaculture and hydroponics offering a

191
00:06:56,039 --> 00:07:00,400
sustainable solution to the challenges

192
00:06:57,720 --> 00:07:02,560
of conventional farming at it core

193
00:07:00,400 --> 00:07:05,280
aquaponics revolves around the symbiotic

194
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:07,280
relationship between fish and plants the

195
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,840
waste produced by the fish serves as an

196
00:07:07,280 --> 00:07:12,039
organic food source for the plants and

197
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:14,360
in turn the plants naturally filter the

198
00:07:12,039 --> 00:07:16,639
water in which the fish live it's a

199
00:07:14,360 --> 00:07:18,520
