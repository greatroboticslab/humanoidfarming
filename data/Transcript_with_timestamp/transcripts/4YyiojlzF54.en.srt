1
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:12,500
thank you

2
00:00:15,780 --> 00:00:18,420
thanks very much

3
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:20,580
um

4
00:00:18,420 --> 00:00:23,760
so today what I want to do is try to

5
00:00:20,580 --> 00:00:26,340
talk about mob grazing and I guess mob

6
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,500
grazing's prob probably been around for

7
00:00:26,340 --> 00:00:31,560
you know maybe 10 years

8
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:34,440
and when you talk to people and about

9
00:00:31,560 --> 00:00:37,440
you know what is it no one can give you

10
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:41,760
a real definition and there was an

11
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:45,600
extension uh agent in Nebraska Terry

12
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:48,539
gomper to did a study a survey of of

13
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,300
producers and basically you know try to

14
00:00:48,539 --> 00:00:53,280
get some information about what that is

15
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:55,440
and basically there's

16
00:00:53,280 --> 00:00:59,039
you know probably it's it's a high

17
00:00:55,440 --> 00:01:03,660
stocking density from maybe 20 to 25 000

18
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:05,700
pounds of live weight of animals to to

19
00:01:03,660 --> 00:01:10,080
maybe somewhere up towards a million

20
00:01:05,700 --> 00:01:13,740
pounds and and so people are moving

21
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:15,780
livestock uh perhaps once a day to to

22
00:01:13,740 --> 00:01:18,080
several times a day when you start

23
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:19,820
moving to higher stock densities

24
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:23,520
and

25
00:01:19,820 --> 00:01:26,100
with that one of the targets could be

26
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:28,080
you know High Trampoline and high

27
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:30,600
consumption of forage and another

28
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:33,180
component to this of course is there's

29
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,420
there's more labor that's involved and

30
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:39,420
so there's really no you cannot no one's

31
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:41,280
made a definition of what it is uh there

32
00:01:39,420 --> 00:01:43,320
are people that said it's an it's a high

33
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:45,659
stock density or it's an ultra high

34
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,420
stock density and and perhaps people

35
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:51,780
throw out things like well yeah to you

36
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:54,360
know 25 000 pounds of lightweight per

37
00:01:51,780 --> 00:01:57,240
acre is really kind of a souped-up

38
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:59,640
manage intensive grazing and so really

39
00:01:57,240 --> 00:02:02,040
you've got to be up towards that 200 000

40
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,899
300 000 things like that but when

41
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,939
there's really no standard definition

42
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:08,580
and no

43
00:02:05,939 --> 00:02:12,840
um no no group has come up with that

44
00:02:08,580 --> 00:02:15,360
definition so basically I I just kind of

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:18,080
showcase it is is really shared

46
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:18,080
characteristics

47
00:02:19,080 --> 00:02:24,900
usually when you're talking to

48
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,720
to people about mob grazing or you're

49
00:02:24,900 --> 00:02:29,280
listening to gurus talk about mob

50
00:02:27,720 --> 00:02:32,819
grazing they're really talking about

51
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:35,580
probably two things and one is what they

52
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:37,680
call a landscaping where you're trying

53
00:02:35,580 --> 00:02:40,800
to improve the probably the soil health

54
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:44,040
and the vegetation of that land so the

55
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:46,019
idea is kind of of reclamation so there

56
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:48,420
may be land that had been beat up in the

57
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:51,060
past and you're really looking at trying

58
00:02:48,420 --> 00:02:56,220
to use the livestock in an intensive way

59
00:02:51,060 --> 00:02:58,440
to try to in to get more of that litter

60
00:02:56,220 --> 00:03:01,560
and that biomass above ground biomass

61
00:02:58,440 --> 00:03:03,540
and try to trample it with livestock and

62
00:03:01,560 --> 00:03:06,959
get it in contact with that soil surface

63
00:03:03,540 --> 00:03:09,480
so you can let all that soil biota do

64
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:12,540
its work and try to to add organic

65
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:14,819
matter to that to that soil surface and

66
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:17,099
and it also in that process we're

67
00:03:14,819 --> 00:03:18,659
hearing people are are making

68
00:03:17,099 --> 00:03:22,440
improvements

69
00:03:18,659 --> 00:03:25,980
um with that livestock action uh adding

70
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:28,800
diversity to their systems another

71
00:03:25,980 --> 00:03:31,620
aspect about what's happening with as

72
00:03:28,800 --> 00:03:32,760
you increase that stocking density uh

73
00:03:31,620 --> 00:03:34,319
what we're finding is that we're

74
00:03:32,760 --> 00:03:37,560
actually getting increased Harvest

75
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:39,300
efficiency so that translates to a

76
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,620
higher carrying capacity so what I mean

77
00:03:39,300 --> 00:03:43,560
about

78
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:46,560
um Harvest efficiency is that it's that

79
00:03:43,560 --> 00:03:49,019
percentage of the forage that's produced

80
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:53,340
how much of that goes down the throat of

81
00:03:49,019 --> 00:03:56,519
the animal so in Range Systems rangeland

82
00:03:53,340 --> 00:03:58,140
people we talk about utilization and

83
00:03:56,519 --> 00:04:01,440
utilization is actually The

84
00:03:58,140 --> 00:04:04,319
Disappearance of that vegetation not

85
00:04:01,440 --> 00:04:07,400
that has part to do with consumption but

86
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:11,700
it's also disappearance that's lost

87
00:04:07,400 --> 00:04:14,340
through a maybe destructive forces such

88
00:04:11,700 --> 00:04:16,500
as trampoline and consumption by

89
00:04:14,340 --> 00:04:18,419
wildlife and insects and those kind of

90
00:04:16,500 --> 00:04:23,520
things and the natural weathering

91
00:04:18,419 --> 00:04:28,080
process and so we've in in more semi-air

92
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:29,820
and arid systems where perhaps people

93
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:32,100
have been using more season long

94
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:35,460
continuous grazing when you have very

95
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:38,460
large pastures we've talked about

96
00:04:35,460 --> 00:04:41,400
concepts of take half leave half so that

97
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:44,520
we're aiming for a 50 utilization

98
00:04:41,400 --> 00:04:47,160
and that means uh we're leaving 50 of

99
00:04:44,520 --> 00:04:49,860
that biomass for plant Vigor for that

100
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,440
plant Community to sustain itself and so

101
00:04:49,860 --> 00:04:54,720
what's actually happening if we leave 50

102
00:04:52,440 --> 00:04:57,840
and take 50 percent

103
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:59,940
really only half of that half that we're

104
00:04:57,840 --> 00:05:02,960
taking is actually going down the throat

105
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:05,699
so in our very

106
00:05:02,960 --> 00:05:08,220
conventional systems under season long

107
00:05:05,699 --> 00:05:10,560
continuous grazing moderate stocking

108
00:05:08,220 --> 00:05:13,259
we're only getting about 25 percent

109
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,340
Harvest efficiency so when you have that

110
00:05:13,259 --> 00:05:17,460
assumption and you make your

111
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:19,100
calculations we can set that stocking

112
00:05:17,460 --> 00:05:21,360
rate and so

113
00:05:19,100 --> 00:05:24,240
societies like the society for range

114
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:26,820
management that works with ranchers and

115
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:29,580
and range professionals we've developed

116
00:05:26,820 --> 00:05:32,520
these kind of safety valves where we

117
00:05:29,580 --> 00:05:34,380
know in our in in the way in the

118
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,440
rangeland ecology that we can sustain

119
00:05:34,380 --> 00:05:40,800
that rangeland with A season-long

120
00:05:37,440 --> 00:05:44,220
continuous grazing model or system with

121
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:47,759
taking a 25 Harvest efficiency results

122
00:05:44,220 --> 00:05:49,560
in actually 50 percent utilization and

123
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:51,419
because we were having some of that

124
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:53,280
forage that's disappearing by insects

125
00:05:51,419 --> 00:05:55,680
and Wildlife and then we're we're

126
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:58,080
maintaining that

127
00:05:55,680 --> 00:06:00,840
um that plant Community Integrity with a

128
00:05:58,080 --> 00:06:04,639
50 utilization and so what we're finding

129
00:06:00,840 --> 00:06:07,320
is actually that mob grazing is kind of

130
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,720
ignoring this take half leave half Rule

131
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,539
and just blowing past that and we're

132
00:06:09,720 --> 00:06:15,060
getting much higher efficiencies of

133
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,919
harvest and so I'm going to show that

134
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:21,360
we're actually getting somewhere towards

135
00:06:16,919 --> 00:06:25,259
35 maybe 40 50 60 percent Harvest

136
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:27,479
efficiency and and that is not in a

137
00:06:25,259 --> 00:06:29,580
season-long continuous system so I'll

138
00:06:27,479 --> 00:06:32,220
have to bring together these concepts of

139
00:06:29,580 --> 00:06:35,699
of use and then rest periods that

140
00:06:32,220 --> 00:06:38,940
happens with the mob grazing

141
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:41,580
so this study uh was funded through a

142
00:06:38,940 --> 00:06:43,080
research and education Sarah Grant and

143
00:06:41,580 --> 00:06:46,020
we had

144
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:48,060
um several producers that were contacted

145
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:50,400
and were interested in in developing

146
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,580
this these producers were already doing

147
00:06:50,400 --> 00:06:55,500
mob grazing and uh what what I wanted to

148
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:57,419
do was to kind of come alongside them

149
00:06:55,500 --> 00:06:58,860
and say you know we're not going to ask

150
00:06:57,419 --> 00:07:00,479
you to do anything different than you're

151
00:06:58,860 --> 00:07:02,819
doing what we'd like to do is actually

152
00:07:00,479 --> 00:07:05,220
document what you're doing so that we

153
00:07:02,819 --> 00:07:07,199
can share that with with the public and

154
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:09,360
kind of understand

155
00:07:07,199 --> 00:07:12,600
um you know what is Mob grazing for some

156
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:14,880
people in South Dakota and actually this

157
00:07:12,600 --> 00:07:18,360
also had some other additional funding

158
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:20,340
with it with a with a an nrcscig Grant

159
00:07:18,360 --> 00:07:22,380
where we we partnered with some with

160
00:07:20,340 --> 00:07:24,180
some people in Nebraska so there's

161
00:07:22,380 --> 00:07:26,099
actually five other locations in

162
00:07:24,180 --> 00:07:28,800
Nebraska that were kind of following

163
00:07:26,099 --> 00:07:31,620
similar similar protocols so you can see

164
00:07:28,800 --> 00:07:33,780
we've got a nice uh gradient across the

165
00:07:31,620 --> 00:07:35,639
state of South Dakota on the east side

166
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:37,680
across the west and we had a few part

167
00:07:35,639 --> 00:07:40,319
Partners up in the in the north and kind

168
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:42,120
of in this region close to Aberdeen and

169
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:44,580
if you go if you look across South

170
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:46,560
Dakota on the on the I-29 Corridor on

171
00:07:44,580 --> 00:07:49,199
the eastern part of South Dakota we're

172
00:07:46,560 --> 00:07:50,940
probably 23 inch rainfall and you get

173
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:54,000
out towards Rapid City and then we're

174
00:07:50,940 --> 00:07:55,680
around 15 to 17. so in the middle of the

175
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,319
state they're probably around between 17

176
00:07:55,680 --> 00:08:01,319
and 20 and further out we so we've got a

177
00:07:58,319 --> 00:08:03,120
nice uh understanding of that rainfall

178
00:08:01,319 --> 00:08:05,280
and how that looks in terms of the

179
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,440
vegetation and we're going to see that

180
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,319
people are adapting to that and they're

181
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:13,680
doing things differently because of that

182
00:08:10,319 --> 00:08:16,319
so this is a stocking density kind of

183
00:08:13,680 --> 00:08:17,819
characterizing what people are doing in

184
00:08:16,319 --> 00:08:20,039
terms of the

185
00:08:17,819 --> 00:08:24,300
um thousands of pounds of beef per acre

186
00:08:20,039 --> 00:08:27,060
so we've got a couple of these sites

187
00:08:24,300 --> 00:08:30,120
um the new Underwood site and the queen

188
00:08:27,060 --> 00:08:31,740
site are out west Queen is by Wall South

189
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:33,839
Dakota and the new Underwood is just by

190
00:08:31,740 --> 00:08:35,399
Rapid City and so you can see their

191
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:39,899
stocking densities are somewhere around

192
00:08:35,399 --> 00:08:41,880
20 to 25 000 and as you uh move towards

193
00:08:39,899 --> 00:08:43,260
the east then we're but are typically

194
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:46,260
what we're finding is they're somewhere

195
00:08:43,260 --> 00:08:48,779
around 50 000 pounds per Acres our

196
00:08:46,260 --> 00:08:50,940
stocking density and in 2012 there was a

197
00:08:48,779 --> 00:08:53,760
quite a severe drought and so that

198
00:08:50,940 --> 00:08:57,360
definitely dropped the stocking rate the

199
00:08:53,760 --> 00:09:00,060
one outlier is actually Reliance and

200
00:08:57,360 --> 00:09:01,380
that's actually showing on this graph at

201
00:09:00,060 --> 00:09:03,959
three hundred thousand he was actually

202
00:09:01,380 --> 00:09:06,120
at a million and he was doing that just

203
00:09:03,959 --> 00:09:08,880
for fun to try to demonstrate what that

204
00:09:06,120 --> 00:09:12,779
would look like so I think he was moving

205
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:15,180
somewhere to 12 or 5 15 times a day to

206
00:09:12,779 --> 00:09:17,100
be able to achieve that so that he had I

207
00:09:15,180 --> 00:09:20,040
wanna I think it was somewhere in the uh

208
00:09:17,100 --> 00:09:22,620
of 300 pair that were on a piece of

209
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:25,200
ground for 45 minutes and he had set up

210
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,480
ahead of time some bat latches so that

211
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,920
they were going off on timers and so the

212
00:09:27,480 --> 00:09:31,860
cattle were actually moving themselves

213
00:09:28,920 --> 00:09:35,040
and so and I and it and then we had a

214
00:09:31,860 --> 00:09:37,080
comparison there was a rotation that uh

215
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:40,080
that was just moving once a day or twice

216
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:42,000
a day that at 50 000. so on so he kind

217
00:09:40,080 --> 00:09:45,260
of has this really extreme so it's kind

218
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:48,660
of fun fun to look at

219
00:09:45,260 --> 00:09:50,940
all right there's a lot of information

220
00:09:48,660 --> 00:09:52,680
in this particular slide so I've got to

221
00:09:50,940 --> 00:09:55,320
take you through it to kind of draw out

222
00:09:52,680 --> 00:09:57,720
some really important things here so

223
00:09:55,320 --> 00:10:00,779
first of all what we did is we went and

224
00:09:57,720 --> 00:10:02,360
picked four locations with a graduate

225
00:10:00,779 --> 00:10:05,760
student where we did some pretty

226
00:10:02,360 --> 00:10:08,459
intensives of clipping of vegetation so

227
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:11,459
we would take a quarter meter square and

228
00:10:08,459 --> 00:10:14,519
run several transects and we would clip

229
00:10:11,459 --> 00:10:17,279
all that vegetation uh prior to to the

230
00:10:14,519 --> 00:10:19,500
cattle turning out onto these areas and

231
00:10:17,279 --> 00:10:21,720
then we would we would get the staining

232
00:10:19,500 --> 00:10:23,760
biomass and we'd get the litter the old

233
00:10:21,720 --> 00:10:25,560
litter that was on the ground and then

234
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,120
after the cattle were into that spot and

235
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:29,700
they moved on to another spot we'd come

236
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,920
back and locate those same transects and

237
00:10:29,700 --> 00:10:33,720
then we put down another quarter meter

238
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:36,959
Square paired that up with the previous

239
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:39,660
one and then we collected and separated

240
00:10:36,959 --> 00:10:41,519
stuff that was newly trampled the old

241
00:10:39,660 --> 00:10:43,860
litter and the stuff that was left

242
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:46,560
standing so what we could do by

243
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:49,560
subtraction is kind of get an estimate

244
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,940
of disappearance by of consumption and

245
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:52,380
how much is newly trampled and those

246
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:55,560
kind of things so the first part that

247
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:58,140
you see the the darker green is

248
00:10:55,560 --> 00:11:00,120
basically the the staining biomass of

249
00:10:58,140 --> 00:11:03,839
the vegetation before the cattle were

250
00:11:00,120 --> 00:11:05,820
put into it then the the gray bar is the

251
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:09,180
post vegetation

252
00:11:05,820 --> 00:11:11,399
and uh the the lighter Green in the

253
00:11:09,180 --> 00:11:13,860
middle this is the pre-litter that was

254
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:17,220
already existing and then this is the

255
00:11:13,860 --> 00:11:19,380
post the post litter and so some of that

256
00:11:17,220 --> 00:11:21,060
and theoretically should be the same if

257
00:11:19,380 --> 00:11:22,380
the cattle aren't eating litter which

258
00:11:21,060 --> 00:11:24,540
you wouldn't expect so there's going to

259
00:11:22,380 --> 00:11:25,680
be a little sampling here there but one

260
00:11:24,540 --> 00:11:27,839
of the things that I want to draw your

261
00:11:25,680 --> 00:11:30,120
attention to is this last bar which

262
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:33,240
would be the trampoline so that's that

263
00:11:30,120 --> 00:11:36,959
new litter and so what I want to show is

264
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,940
is uh if you make the subtraction so

265
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,420
you're starting with your pre-biomass

266
00:11:38,940 --> 00:11:44,700
and then with your end biomass if you if

267
00:11:42,420 --> 00:11:46,740
you pull out how much was trampled

268
00:11:44,700 --> 00:11:48,600
then you can get how much was consumed

269
00:11:46,740 --> 00:11:51,660
by livestock and so what I've put down

270
00:11:48,600 --> 00:11:55,200
here is the Harvest efficiency so these

271
00:11:51,660 --> 00:11:56,399
numbers are the percent of that was down

272
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,160
the throat

273
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:01,500
of the existing the pre-biomass

274
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:04,920
vegetation so you can see that there's a

275
00:12:01,500 --> 00:12:07,500
a wide variety but you but it's more

276
00:12:04,920 --> 00:12:10,079
than our typical

277
00:12:07,500 --> 00:12:12,300
um if we plan a season-long continuous

278
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:16,260
grazing at moderate levels that's at

279
00:12:12,300 --> 00:12:18,899
base 25 so why why these producers are

280
00:12:16,260 --> 00:12:21,959
doing this is because they're getting uh

281
00:12:18,899 --> 00:12:25,920
with this intensive stocking densities

282
00:12:21,959 --> 00:12:28,380
up to that 25 to 50 000 to 200 or maybe

283
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:30,060
a million is is they're getting higher

284
00:12:28,380 --> 00:12:33,060
Harvest efficiencies

285
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:36,540
so to put this in perspective if you

286
00:12:33,060 --> 00:12:39,420
think about in Western South Dakota with

287
00:12:36,540 --> 00:12:42,660
our our stocking rates are about a half

288
00:12:39,420 --> 00:12:44,940
an AUM per acre and that translates to

289
00:12:42,660 --> 00:12:47,639
probably a stocking density for a

290
00:12:44,940 --> 00:12:50,540
six-month grazing season that's less

291
00:12:47,639 --> 00:12:54,000
than 500 pounds of live weight per acre

292
00:12:50,540 --> 00:12:56,399
and if you come over to the east side of

293
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:57,959
the state where we have stocking rates

294
00:12:56,399 --> 00:13:00,600
somewhere maybe one and a half to maybe

295
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:03,300
two aums per acre at a traditional

296
00:13:00,600 --> 00:13:05,880
rotation you might be at fi you know

297
00:13:03,300 --> 00:13:09,120
moving cattle once a week we might be at

298
00:13:05,880 --> 00:13:10,560
5 000 pounds per acre of live weight and

299
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:12,600
so what we're seeing is even though when

300
00:13:10,560 --> 00:13:15,120
we go up to 25 000 pounds that doesn't

301
00:13:12,600 --> 00:13:17,700
seem like a lot but it's you know it's

302
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:19,800
probably five times more intensive than

303
00:13:17,700 --> 00:13:21,420
our our typical rotations that we used

304
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:23,820
to be doing you know when we're starting

305
00:13:21,420 --> 00:13:26,760
to move livestock once a day and so one

306
00:13:23,820 --> 00:13:28,800
of our producers that that's by haytai

307
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:31,079
you know he was moving

308
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:33,779
um cattle twice a day and his stocking

309
00:13:31,079 --> 00:13:36,600
densities were closer to that 200 000.

310
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:38,820
the Chamberlain was around 50 000 pounds

311
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,220
per acre so part of it is going to be

312
00:13:38,820 --> 00:13:43,079
the vegetation so what we've been

313
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:46,680
finding is that

314
00:13:43,079 --> 00:13:49,079
in it as the vegetation is shorter and

315
00:13:46,680 --> 00:13:51,060
in a vegetative state they tend not to

316
00:13:49,079 --> 00:13:52,920
trample as much because it's sparser

317
00:13:51,060 --> 00:13:55,620
thin and what they're doing is they're

318
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,800
consuming more and it's actually hard to

319
00:13:55,620 --> 00:14:01,320
get uh newly trampled so out at this

320
00:13:58,800 --> 00:14:04,200
Quinn site you know we're we've we've

321
00:14:01,320 --> 00:14:08,160
got about uh maybe

322
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:11,040
um 20 of that is getting trampled and

323
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:12,800
and interestingly enough at the at the

324
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,000
Chamberlain site

325
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:16,860
you know they're not trampling that much

326
00:14:15,000 --> 00:14:18,360
but at hay Ty

327
00:14:16,860 --> 00:14:21,240
um they were getting a little bit more

328
00:14:18,360 --> 00:14:23,339
trampled and the hay tie sites uh a

329
00:14:21,240 --> 00:14:25,019
little was about or about the same as

330
00:14:23,339 --> 00:14:26,519
productivity of the Chamberlain but it

331
00:14:25,019 --> 00:14:28,800
has to do with you know if that

332
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:30,720
vegetation gets taller you know they're

333
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:33,360
more apt to probably knock some of that

334
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:35,100
down so from the late there's a remember

335
00:14:33,360 --> 00:14:36,240
the two goals that white people are

336
00:14:35,100 --> 00:14:38,339
probably doing this there's a

337
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,100
landscaping goal where you really want

338
00:14:38,339 --> 00:14:43,079
to trample that vegetation to try to

339
00:14:41,100 --> 00:14:45,959
build soil Health you know get more land

340
00:14:43,079 --> 00:14:49,440
covered and then there's kind of maybe a

341
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:52,800
a stocking carrying capacity stocking

342
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:54,720
rate uh you know Harvest efficiency goal

343
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,579
where you're trying to get more

344
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,339
consumption and maintaining animal

345
00:14:56,579 --> 00:15:01,860
performance and so in that same net

346
00:14:59,339 --> 00:15:04,079
standpoint then what we're probably

347
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:06,600
meeting you know that those goals from

348
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:09,079
that that increase Harvest efficiency

349
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:12,660
so this is where the economics play in

350
00:15:09,079 --> 00:15:15,660
that you're spending your time you know

351
00:15:12,660 --> 00:15:18,600
most of the producers probably spend

352
00:15:15,660 --> 00:15:21,540
about a half an hour maybe an hour at

353
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:24,300
most to move the livestock a day and

354
00:15:21,540 --> 00:15:26,399
it's it's paying off in terms of they're

355
00:15:24,300 --> 00:15:29,760
able to you know increase that stocking

356
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,079
density and getting that higher Harvest

357
00:15:29,760 --> 00:15:33,959
efficiency

358
00:15:31,079 --> 00:15:37,260
and so what we're finding is that how

359
00:15:33,959 --> 00:15:40,260
how do they do that if these Harvest

360
00:15:37,260 --> 00:15:43,079
efficiencies and these utilization rates

361
00:15:40,260 --> 00:15:45,779
remember utilization is basically the

362
00:15:43,079 --> 00:15:49,079
consumption plus trampoline and so those

363
00:15:45,779 --> 00:15:52,320
are pretty high notice if you just

364
00:15:49,079 --> 00:15:55,399
calculate utilization that would be your

365
00:15:52,320 --> 00:15:58,500
pre-vegetation minus the post vegetation

366
00:15:55,399 --> 00:15:59,639
and that difference is really high so a

367
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:02,040
lot of times we're getting eighty

368
00:15:59,639 --> 00:16:03,240
percent utilization and of that 80

369
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:06,180
percent

370
00:16:03,240 --> 00:16:07,980
maybe 40 or so of it is is down the

371
00:16:06,180 --> 00:16:09,300
throat the other 40 may be trampled or

372
00:16:07,980 --> 00:16:13,320
you know there's some proportion of

373
00:16:09,300 --> 00:16:16,800
those and so from a as a trained person

374
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:19,139
in the range science that is uh

375
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:21,360
stressful because we're thinking oh

376
00:16:19,139 --> 00:16:23,940
we're blowing past take half leave half

377
00:16:21,360 --> 00:16:26,220
and and that can't be good for the plant

378
00:16:23,940 --> 00:16:29,639
Community is that actually a sustainable

379
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:32,040
practice so had to wrestle with with

380
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,519
these Concepts so so here's what's

381
00:16:32,040 --> 00:16:34,519
happening

382
00:16:34,980 --> 00:16:40,800
you graze a piece of land for one day or

383
00:16:38,699 --> 00:16:42,959
for half a day and you're not coming

384
00:16:40,800 --> 00:16:44,699
back to it for a whole year

385
00:16:42,959 --> 00:16:46,740
so they're getting a long rest period

386
00:16:44,699 --> 00:16:49,019
you got a very intensive

387
00:16:46,740 --> 00:16:51,839
you know utilization very high but a lot

388
00:16:49,019 --> 00:16:54,540
of rest so what I like to do to

389
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:56,759
translate what this means to me is let's

390
00:16:54,540 --> 00:16:58,560
for example let's say you're you're

391
00:16:56,759 --> 00:17:01,680
harvesting a hay field

392
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,839
well we Harvest hay pretty much every at

393
00:17:01,680 --> 00:17:06,900
the same time every year so let's say

394
00:17:03,839 --> 00:17:09,299
you have a hay field it's July 1st you

395
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,699
come in with your sickle bar Mower and

396
00:17:09,299 --> 00:17:13,740
you cut it down at you know a few inches

397
00:17:11,699 --> 00:17:18,059
off the ground you're probably getting

398
00:17:13,740 --> 00:17:20,959
80 90 percent Harvest efficiency and we

399
00:17:18,059 --> 00:17:23,640
do that for 50 hundred years whatever

400
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:26,220
and it comes back and you get the same

401
00:17:23,640 --> 00:17:28,079
productivity every single year obviously

402
00:17:26,220 --> 00:17:29,820
there's fluctuations based on you know

403
00:17:28,079 --> 00:17:31,500
rainfall but that's a sustainable

404
00:17:29,820 --> 00:17:34,919
practice because it's always producing

405
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:36,900
about the same amount so if we switch to

406
00:17:34,919 --> 00:17:39,360
these higher stocking density kind of

407
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:41,840
systems where we're only on that piece

408
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,000
of ground for half a day or for a day

409
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:47,100
essentially we're kind of taking that

410
00:17:45,000 --> 00:17:49,520
same concept and and applying it to

411
00:17:47,100 --> 00:17:51,960
livestock so the livestock are the mower

412
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:53,940
yeah they're not getting 80 or 90

413
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:56,039
percent of it they're maybe getting 40

414
00:17:53,940 --> 00:17:58,500
and knocking down 40 or they're getting

415
00:17:56,039 --> 00:18:00,840
60 and knocking down 20 but you get the

416
00:17:58,500 --> 00:18:04,020
point that because we have such long

417
00:18:00,840 --> 00:18:05,780
rest periods up to a year it does not

418
00:18:04,020 --> 00:18:08,179
hurt the vegetation

419
00:18:05,780 --> 00:18:10,980
now we know that

420
00:18:08,179 --> 00:18:12,179
some of the rest periods some of that

421
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:14,600
time period you know is going to be

422
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:18,179
dormant season so when we talk about

423
00:18:14,600 --> 00:18:20,820
resting for an entire year there are

424
00:18:18,179 --> 00:18:23,460
times when you can rest land in the

425
00:18:20,820 --> 00:18:26,520
winter it does really no good it's going

426
00:18:23,460 --> 00:18:29,700
to be key on what's the growth rate of

427
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:32,940
these plants afterwards so if you graze

428
00:18:29,700 --> 00:18:35,520
these things in a stage where there the

429
00:18:32,940 --> 00:18:37,799
grass is in a boot stage and you hit it

430
00:18:35,520 --> 00:18:39,419
hard every year you're probably going to

431
00:18:37,799 --> 00:18:41,880
set it back because plants are most

432
00:18:39,419 --> 00:18:44,580
vulnerable in the boot stage if you wait

433
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,320
till the plants are headed out and graze

434
00:18:44,580 --> 00:18:48,780
it that time of year you're probably not

435
00:18:46,320 --> 00:18:51,360
going to hurt the plants because when

436
00:18:48,780 --> 00:18:54,660
plants have headed out they've put down

437
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:56,660
most of of what they need from the root

438
00:18:54,660 --> 00:18:59,760
structure so when I think about

439
00:18:56,660 --> 00:19:01,080
simplistic way of grazing and what kind

440
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:03,780
of impact am I going to have below

441
00:19:01,080 --> 00:19:06,360
ground is just think about

442
00:19:03,780 --> 00:19:08,460
um when the plant is tall it's probably

443
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:09,720
tall below ground when the plant is

444
00:19:08,460 --> 00:19:12,480
short it's probably short below ground

445
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:14,160
so depending upon when you graze that's

446
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:15,660
kind of reflective of the impact that

447
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:18,179
you're going to have below ground so

448
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,460
when we graze when the plant is tall

449
00:19:18,179 --> 00:19:24,000
we're not going to hurt it because it's

450
00:19:20,460 --> 00:19:26,360
probably set a lot of you know root

451
00:19:24,000 --> 00:19:26,360
structure

452
00:19:27,299 --> 00:19:31,980
on a side note I had a grad student that

453
00:19:30,299 --> 00:19:34,860
at our Volga site which was near

454
00:19:31,980 --> 00:19:36,900
Brookings to kind of play around with

455
00:19:34,860 --> 00:19:39,900
different stocking densities so we had

456
00:19:36,900 --> 00:19:42,179
our producers where we we let them do

457
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:45,299
what they wanted to do and and to kind

458
00:19:42,179 --> 00:19:47,100
of vary between 25 up to maybe 200 000

459
00:19:45,299 --> 00:19:49,799
pound stocking rate and so what we

460
00:19:47,100 --> 00:19:53,760
wanted to do was look at stocky rates

461
00:19:49,799 --> 00:19:56,580
from from 50 000 pounds up to 800 000

462
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:59,280
pounds so what we did is we just we

463
00:19:56,580 --> 00:20:01,620
would put the enough for one day or two

464
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:03,179
days or we would go towards you know

465
00:20:01,620 --> 00:20:04,860
moving maybe

466
00:20:03,179 --> 00:20:06,240
um eight times a day or ten times a day

467
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,160
those kind of things and so we varied

468
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:11,160
that and then we did the same thing we

469
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,679
went ahead into the paddock before they

470
00:20:11,160 --> 00:20:16,380
came and clipped the samples separated

471
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:18,840
into those standing vegetation litter

472
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:20,760
and then we allowed the animals to graze

473
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:22,559
those paddocks and then we pulled them

474
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,320
off and then we went back to those same

475
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:27,539
areas and put down a sample next to this

476
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:29,580
area that we clipped before and then and

477
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:31,140
we had the new trampled we had the old

478
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:34,080
litter and we had the standing

479
00:20:31,140 --> 00:20:37,020
vegetation so what I'm showing you is

480
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,900
the the utilization so the remember the

481
00:20:37,020 --> 00:20:42,120
utilization is what was

482
00:20:39,900 --> 00:20:44,700
um is the pre-vegetation and you

483
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:48,240
subtract off the post so utilization is

484
00:20:44,700 --> 00:20:51,360
consumption plus trampoline and and two

485
00:20:48,240 --> 00:20:54,900
in 2012 we had that we had that drought

486
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:56,820
and so we had some issues of course

487
00:20:54,900 --> 00:20:59,400
um didn't want to hurt the grass and and

488
00:20:56,820 --> 00:21:01,679
did have as much forage and then in 2013

489
00:20:59,400 --> 00:21:03,919
it was a little bit uh wetter and so

490
00:21:01,679 --> 00:21:06,299
what you're seeing is kind of is that

491
00:21:03,919 --> 00:21:08,520
what are we achieving you know how much

492
00:21:06,299 --> 00:21:10,980
are the cattle eating and knocking

493
00:21:08,520 --> 00:21:14,940
things down and what it kind of appears

494
00:21:10,980 --> 00:21:16,460
that is that how much it's what stocking

495
00:21:14,940 --> 00:21:19,620
density is enough

496
00:21:16,460 --> 00:21:21,539
are is a 50 000 pound stock density

497
00:21:19,620 --> 00:21:23,400
enough to to achieve some of these

498
00:21:21,539 --> 00:21:25,679
things do you need a hundred do you need

499
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:27,000
200 do you need 400 800 because we have

500
00:21:25,679 --> 00:21:29,220
producers

501
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:31,320
um throughout North America that are

502
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:34,520
going from anywhere from that 25 to 50

503
00:21:31,320 --> 00:21:37,320
that maybe are going up to like Dennis

504
00:21:34,520 --> 00:21:39,539
Neil Dennis up in Canada that may be up

505
00:21:37,320 --> 00:21:41,460
towards a million and so is there kind

506
00:21:39,539 --> 00:21:44,460
of this law diminishing returns is like

507
00:21:41,460 --> 00:21:47,159
how much is enough and so what we found

508
00:21:44,460 --> 00:21:50,039
is that you know in that that there's a

509
00:21:47,159 --> 00:21:52,380
you know an increase in utilization then

510
00:21:50,039 --> 00:21:54,299
it kind of levels off and the same kind

511
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,760
of thing here is that there's there's

512
00:21:54,299 --> 00:21:58,260
only so much you can do and so what

513
00:21:56,760 --> 00:21:59,880
we're finding out is that you know yeah

514
00:21:58,260 --> 00:22:02,039
maybe

515
00:21:59,880 --> 00:22:04,740
um you know at 50 000 pounds depending

516
00:22:02,039 --> 00:22:07,500
upon the the vegetation where where

517
00:22:04,740 --> 00:22:09,900
we're at you know maybe 200 000 pounds

518
00:22:07,500 --> 00:22:12,179
is enough in that and that may be moving

519
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:16,080
twice a day in in higher rainfall

520
00:22:12,179 --> 00:22:19,140
environments but at 200 000 pounds of

521
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:20,880
stocking weight or live weight in

522
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:22,440
Western environments with less

523
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:24,620
vegetation you have to move several

524
00:22:22,440 --> 00:22:27,000
times a day

525
00:22:24,620 --> 00:22:29,039
so and then part of the other thing was

526
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:31,080
just to kind of compare this to folks

527
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:33,720
that are doing mob grazing so at some of

528
00:22:31,080 --> 00:22:36,000
the sites they had a comparison that we

529
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:38,280
could do with mob grazing and here this

530
00:22:36,000 --> 00:22:40,200
is just ocular estimates of of the grass

531
00:22:38,280 --> 00:22:42,120
cover so it wasn't the veg it wasn't

532
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:44,039
clipping the vegetation but we would

533
00:22:42,120 --> 00:22:46,620
make these ocular estimates of before

534
00:22:44,039 --> 00:22:49,200
and after and so what I'm showing you

535
00:22:46,620 --> 00:22:51,360
again is the is the before you go into

536
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:53,340
the paddock and then the after and then

537
00:22:51,360 --> 00:22:55,380
you can make those subtractions to get

538
00:22:53,340 --> 00:22:56,820
at that utilization and and kind of

539
00:22:55,380 --> 00:22:59,580
consumption things and so what we're

540
00:22:56,820 --> 00:23:01,440
showing here is that yeah they're

541
00:22:59,580 --> 00:23:03,600
getting more they're getting more

542
00:23:01,440 --> 00:23:06,240
utilization compared to the rotation

543
00:23:03,600 --> 00:23:08,880
with the mob grazing same thing so when

544
00:23:06,240 --> 00:23:11,400
you just look at mob versus rotation

545
00:23:08,880 --> 00:23:13,860
so so the bottom line is you know again

546
00:23:11,400 --> 00:23:16,020
just reiterating why are people wanting

547
00:23:13,860 --> 00:23:18,900
to do this why are they intensifying

548
00:23:16,020 --> 00:23:21,179
this uh rotational grazing with this mob

549
00:23:18,900 --> 00:23:22,860
grazing and it really comes comes down

550
00:23:21,179 --> 00:23:24,600
to it is that

551
00:23:22,860 --> 00:23:27,900
um they're gaining a higher Harvest

552
00:23:24,600 --> 00:23:30,600
efficiency there's that uh higher we're

553
00:23:27,900 --> 00:23:33,299
getting higher utilization but it's a

554
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:36,059
safe practice because we're only on that

555
00:23:33,299 --> 00:23:37,860
piece of land for just one day and it

556
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:39,900
gets to be rested the other parts of the

557
00:23:37,860 --> 00:23:41,760
year

558
00:23:39,900 --> 00:23:43,080
so here are some just some pictures of

559
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:47,340
before and after

560
00:23:43,080 --> 00:23:49,799
so this is a 57 000 pounds stock density

561
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:51,720
just you know moving once a day so

562
00:23:49,799 --> 00:23:54,240
that's what it looks like another

563
00:23:51,720 --> 00:23:57,299
graduate student looked at some uh some

564
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:58,980
of the the weeds and so we looked at uh

565
00:23:57,299 --> 00:24:01,679
Western snowberry which is a native

566
00:23:58,980 --> 00:24:05,460
shrub and we also looked at some of the

567
00:24:01,679 --> 00:24:08,220
um the the thistles and as you increase

568
00:24:05,460 --> 00:24:11,700
that stocking density cattle then tend

569
00:24:08,220 --> 00:24:13,860
to to to utilize some of those broadleaf

570
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:16,679
plants that they normally wouldn't do so

571
00:24:13,860 --> 00:24:20,340
that's part of it as well

572
00:24:16,679 --> 00:24:24,419
this is the one that was at uh Reliance

573
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:26,400
a sandy soil where he um grazed at that

574
00:24:24,419 --> 00:24:27,900
million pounds they're only on that on a

575
00:24:26,400 --> 00:24:30,059
piece of land for

576
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:32,640
um I think it was a third of an acre 45

577
00:24:30,059 --> 00:24:34,620
minutes with a 300 pair and so they

578
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:36,659
really trampled it and really high

579
00:24:34,620 --> 00:24:38,460
distribution of of

580
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:42,240
um of dung and then the there's where

581
00:24:38,460 --> 00:24:45,360
the the rotation for 12 hours on 55 000

582
00:24:42,240 --> 00:24:47,700
so you get a much higher utilization

583
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:50,760
so here's new percent new litter cover

584
00:24:47,700 --> 00:24:51,659
this is again an ocular the the one that

585
00:24:50,760 --> 00:24:54,840
was

586
00:24:51,659 --> 00:24:55,620
um Quinn and the

587
00:24:54,840 --> 00:24:57,659
um

588
00:24:55,620 --> 00:25:01,440
the new Underwood sites are really far

589
00:24:57,659 --> 00:25:04,740
west and so only five percent maybe 10

590
00:25:01,440 --> 00:25:07,740
percent new litter these are areas that

591
00:25:04,740 --> 00:25:09,600
were receiving 15 inches of rainfall and

592
00:25:07,740 --> 00:25:12,600
it's just darn hard

593
00:25:09,600 --> 00:25:14,760
to get new looter I mean when you're

594
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:18,419
there there's a lot of space in between

595
00:25:14,760 --> 00:25:21,059
plants so can mob grazing be used for

596
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:23,039
landscaping in semi-arid arid

597
00:25:21,059 --> 00:25:25,500
environments it's very challenging

598
00:25:23,039 --> 00:25:28,020
because there's not a lot of biomass to

599
00:25:25,500 --> 00:25:29,700
begin with and to and in order to

600
00:25:28,020 --> 00:25:31,080
maintain performance there's not much to

601
00:25:29,700 --> 00:25:34,380
trample

602
00:25:31,080 --> 00:25:37,559
and this is done uh density so we we

603
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,419
looked at the paths per meter square and

604
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:42,299
so that's one of the things is that

605
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:45,179
we're increasing utilization and getting

606
00:25:42,299 --> 00:25:47,520
more evenly distribution of density of

607
00:25:45,179 --> 00:25:49,980
of the excrement

608
00:25:47,520 --> 00:25:52,380
we had a couple tours for the

609
00:25:49,980 --> 00:25:55,919
researchers on the project

610
00:25:52,380 --> 00:25:59,940
in 20 in 2012 and 2013 and we also made

611
00:25:55,919 --> 00:26:02,840
some videos if you want to just go to

612
00:25:59,940 --> 00:26:05,580
the South Dakota grassland Coalition

613
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:08,760
sdgrass.org you can find these videos

614
00:26:05,580 --> 00:26:11,580
you can search you can Google them or go

615
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:13,799
into YouTube and you'll find them packed

616
00:26:11,580 --> 00:26:15,900
up those the one by Quinn Charlie

617
00:26:13,799 --> 00:26:18,720
tottens by Chamberlain and then Rick

618
00:26:15,900 --> 00:26:21,679
Smith is by Watertown and those are

619
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:21,679
available to look at

620
00:26:22,020 --> 00:26:26,880
so bottom line is producers are getting

621
00:26:24,539 --> 00:26:28,980
a higher Harvest efficiency we've also

622
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:31,580
taken soil samples to document carbon

623
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:33,900
but we haven't got all our soil samples

624
00:26:31,580 --> 00:26:36,059
analyzed and so we're we're still

625
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:37,559
waiting for those but what I would say

626
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:39,840
is that

627
00:26:37,559 --> 00:26:43,320
I don't expect soil carbon to probably

628
00:26:39,840 --> 00:26:45,000
increase that's a slow process

629
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:46,799
especially you think about those Western

630
00:26:45,000 --> 00:26:48,539
environments where there's not a lot of

631
00:26:46,799 --> 00:26:50,940
new litter being added

632
00:26:48,539 --> 00:26:52,020
it's that's not the mechanism for it to

633
00:26:50,940 --> 00:26:54,419
happen when you're only getting five

634
00:26:52,020 --> 00:26:56,279
percent new litter on the ground it much

635
00:26:54,419 --> 00:26:58,380
makes a lot more sense that you probably

636
00:26:56,279 --> 00:27:00,360
can increase soil carbon as you move

637
00:26:58,380 --> 00:27:01,799
further east or there's a lot of biomass

638
00:27:00,360 --> 00:27:02,640
and you can get it trampled on the

639
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:04,320
ground

640
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:06,960
does that make sense

641
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,480
so my guess is that we're going to see

642
00:27:06,960 --> 00:27:10,740
these benefits

643
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:13,200
returned to us from the higher Harvest

644
00:27:10,740 --> 00:27:16,020
efficiency to pay for the labor and make

645
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:17,640
make these ranches more sustainable and

646
00:27:16,020 --> 00:27:19,039
these guys are only doing it for maybe

647
00:27:17,640 --> 00:27:21,620
60 days

648
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:24,600
it's not sustainable to kill yourself

649
00:27:21,620 --> 00:27:26,279
working that hard either and so there's

650
00:27:24,600 --> 00:27:28,380
there's reason you know a time period

651
00:27:26,279 --> 00:27:30,240
which which they're doing for so what

652
00:27:28,380 --> 00:27:31,919
we're gonna we're expecting a graduate

653
00:27:30,240 --> 00:27:34,860
student in the econ Department to finish

654
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,120
up his thesis here this semester and

655
00:27:34,860 --> 00:27:38,779
then we're going to be able to put that

656
00:27:36,120 --> 00:27:43,039
economic analysis that he'll do

657
00:27:38,779 --> 00:27:43,039
when we write our final report

658
00:27:43,220 --> 00:27:46,679
so the question is how many how big are

659
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:50,340
the paddocks

660
00:27:46,679 --> 00:27:53,279
so they'll re they're typically uh five

661
00:27:50,340 --> 00:27:55,860
acres of what uh and then it's just

662
00:27:53,279 --> 00:27:59,159
depending upon how many pair so the one

663
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:02,220
by uh Chamberlain he would give four to

664
00:27:59,159 --> 00:28:04,740
five acres and he'd have 250 pair

665
00:28:02,220 --> 00:28:07,799
um the one producer that's since uh by

666
00:28:04,740 --> 00:28:10,500
Selby he's actually here today uh he's I

667
00:28:07,799 --> 00:28:12,120
think he's around four or five acres and

668
00:28:10,500 --> 00:28:14,520
that same kind of thing so they're at

669
00:28:12,120 --> 00:28:16,020
that 50 000 pound stocking density so

670
00:28:14,520 --> 00:28:17,400
the question was did the did the

671
00:28:16,020 --> 00:28:19,440
producers increase their overall

672
00:28:17,400 --> 00:28:21,539
stocking rate for the year and I would

673
00:28:19,440 --> 00:28:23,940
say for yes for that piece of ground

674
00:28:21,539 --> 00:28:26,220
they are increasing their stocking rate

675
00:28:23,940 --> 00:28:29,159
their carrying capacity so these

676
00:28:26,220 --> 00:28:31,080
typically are are older crop or crop

677
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:33,960
land long time ago I've been planted

678
00:28:31,080 --> 00:28:36,539
back to to introduce species and they're

679
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:38,520
purposely getting more bang for the buck

680
00:28:36,539 --> 00:28:41,760
on that spot there are some the one in

681
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:44,580
Reliance it was native or not Reliance

682
00:28:41,760 --> 00:28:47,820
the one by uh Chamberlain was native and

683
00:28:44,580 --> 00:28:50,520
we think with uh with the system that

684
00:28:47,820 --> 00:28:53,279
he's doing he's probably a two and a

685
00:28:50,520 --> 00:28:55,860
half times higher than the typical nrcs

686
00:28:53,279 --> 00:28:58,500
recommended take half leave half first

687
00:28:55,860 --> 00:29:01,380
season long so we are getting higher

688
00:28:58,500 --> 00:29:05,580
stocking rates for those pieces of land

689
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:07,919
mostly um not virgin native most of them

690
00:29:05,580 --> 00:29:10,140
are these old crop land that was in the

691
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:12,480
west it's crested

692
00:29:10,140 --> 00:29:14,940
yep crested wheat crested wheatgrass

693
00:29:12,480 --> 00:29:16,620
Alfalfa out west intermediately

694
00:29:14,940 --> 00:29:18,059
wheatgrass

695
00:29:16,620 --> 00:29:21,059
um brown grass kind of things Kentucky

696
00:29:18,059 --> 00:29:24,200
Bluegrass and the central the one in

697
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:27,720
hetai by Watertown Rick Smith it's a

698
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:30,539
planted back blue stem big blue stem

699
00:29:27,720 --> 00:29:33,059
kind of thing and and so what they're

700
00:29:30,539 --> 00:29:35,279
doing is they're intensifying on land

701
00:29:33,059 --> 00:29:37,159
that can handle that but remember it's

702
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:39,659
getting rested for

703
00:29:37,159 --> 00:29:41,460
essentially a year

704
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:43,500
and then how did the animals perform

705
00:29:41,460 --> 00:29:45,659
like how so they're watching body

706
00:29:43,500 --> 00:29:47,820
condition we didn't have weights and

707
00:29:45,659 --> 00:29:50,640
most people don't take the weights but

708
00:29:47,820 --> 00:29:53,580
you can tell the producers that they're

709
00:29:50,640 --> 00:29:55,440
doing this for 30 days or 60 days and

710
00:29:53,580 --> 00:29:57,240
then they kind of go back to a rotation

711
00:29:55,440 --> 00:29:59,580
where they're getting moved you know

712
00:29:57,240 --> 00:30:01,679
once a month once a week twice a week

713
00:29:59,580 --> 00:30:04,799
kind of thing so they can cows can

714
00:30:01,679 --> 00:30:06,539
compensate there's compensatory gain so

715
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:09,419
even if they're challenged a little bit

716
00:30:06,539 --> 00:30:13,940
for 30 days or 60 days you'll find that

717
00:30:09,419 --> 00:30:16,260
they will make that up in a later period

718
00:30:13,940 --> 00:30:18,779
yep everybody that we're working with

719
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:20,700
our cow calf Piers except Pat guptill

720
00:30:18,779 --> 00:30:22,980
that he's got

721
00:30:20,700 --> 00:30:26,039
um red heifers

722
00:30:22,980 --> 00:30:28,140
and I should mention Gary that's um

723
00:30:26,039 --> 00:30:31,500
Cliff Millsaps over by Gary

724
00:30:28,140 --> 00:30:34,200
he's got steers so he's around

725
00:30:31,500 --> 00:30:35,940
17 000 pound stock density and he's

726
00:30:34,200 --> 00:30:38,399
actually moving through maybe two to

727
00:30:35,940 --> 00:30:40,080
three times a year so he wants to make

728
00:30:38,399 --> 00:30:42,419
