global demand for food

2
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:14,000
and animal source food in particular is

3
00:00:11,360 --> 00:00:14,000
increasing

4
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:19,119
the growing livestock sector brings new

5
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:21,439
opportunities and challenges

6
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:24,000
for food security and nutrition

7
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:26,800
livelihoods and economic growth

8
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:30,560
animal health and welfare and natural

resources and climate change for decades

10
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:34,960
agriculture and the livestock sector

11
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:38,719
have tried to produce more from less

12
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:41,920
and to maximize output sustainably

13
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:43,840
the un 2030 agenda raised the bar

14
00:00:41,920 --> 00:00:46,719
introducing further dimensions to the

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,120
goal of sustainability

16
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,879
however the world is currently off track

17
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,079
to achieve many of the sustainable

18
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,120
development goals by 2030 and the kobit

19
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:59,280
19 pandemic

20
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:01,440
has made this even harder

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:03,359
how can the livestock sector help to

22
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:05,680
achieve the sustainable development

23
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,680
goals

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,119
livestock can help to end hunger and

25
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:11,920
malnutrition

26
00:01:09,119 --> 00:01:12,880
by ensuring healthy and nutritious diets

27
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:14,720
contributing to

28
00:01:12,880 --> 00:01:17,360
incomes and providing vulnerable

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,960

00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
affordable and safe food

32
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,799
livestock can contribute to poverty

33
00:01:26,560 --> 00:01:30,799
reduction and economic growth

34
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:32,320
by supporting the livelihoods of large

35
00:01:30,799 --> 00:01:34,560
numbers of rural people

36
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,520
helping to alleviate poverty creating

37
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:37,280
employment

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,960
stimulating demand for goods and

39
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:42,960
services and feeding

00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,960
into other sectors of the economy

41
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
livestock can contribute to ecosystem

services

43
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,640
by supporting biodiversity and key

44
00:01:49,200 --> 00:01:52,840
ecosystem functions

45
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,720
nutrient cycling and soil carbon

sequestration

47
00:01:54,720 --> 00:01:58,880
livestock can increase resilience by

48
00:01:56,799 --> 00:02:01,280
helping hundreds of millions of people

49
00:01:58,880 --> 00:02:02,799
to survive in marginal areas due to

50
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:05,119
their versatility

51
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,040
when integrated with crop tree or fish

52
00:02:05,119 --> 00:02:08,239

to changing climatic conditions

56
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,680
the livestock sector is important for

57
00:02:17,360 --> 00:02:22,000
each sdg but there are challenges

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:24,000
that need to be managed livestock

59
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:25,120

00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,800
user can cause biodiversity loss

63
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:34,959
and draw heavily on natural resources

64
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:36,720
intensification of animal production

65
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,000
could compromise animal health and

welfare

67
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:41,840
this also threatens human health through

antimicrobial overuse

69
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,519
and increased risk from zoonotic

diseases

71
00:02:45,519 --> 00:02:49,920
in a more competitive sector it is

72
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:50,480
difficult to ensure inclusive access to

73
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,280
markets
