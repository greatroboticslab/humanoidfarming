00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:06,160
in a small community in the pacific

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:07,839
northwest a dynamic company is growing

3
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:10,400
this company has served the equipment

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:12,480
dealer market for 30 years they did it

5
00:00:10,400 --> 00:00:15,040
by following their principles

6
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:17,840
by being the best and by being honest to

7
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,439
their customers

8
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:21,119
dis

9
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:24,520
technology driven

10
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,520
people focused

11
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:44,239
the moisture was good the

12
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,600
commodity prices were real good and we

13
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:48,239
happened to

14
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,760
gamble at the right time and it was one

15
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:50,960
where

16
00:00:49,760 --> 00:00:53,120
we probably shouldn't have gotten as

17
00:00:50,960 --> 00:00:55,520
many sales as we did but it was because

18
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:57,680
of some of our loaner programs where

19
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:59,280
instead of taking the guys that tractors

20
00:00:57,680 --> 00:01:01,520
broke down on the used tractor that we

21
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,960
had we took them a new one you know by

22
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,760
the time we got to

23
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:08,560
uh use one back they said we'll just

24
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:10,320
just keep it and it's one word

25
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:12,000
you don't know until you try

26
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,000
and a lot of these guys won't be able to

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:15,680
make up their mind until it's sitting

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:18,080
there and they put on

29
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:20,400
10 15 hours on it and realize you know

30
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:22,960
what maybe i can do this

31
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:24,400
money happens to be there or sometimes

32
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:26,799
you might not realize that sale right

33
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,759
away it might be a year down the road

34
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:31,439
but if the seed is planted

35
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,200
that's all you can hope for is that it

36
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,720
will grow and it'll get you something to

37
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:35,759
come back with

38
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:37,680
because

39
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,759
that growth for us

40
00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:41,040
yeah is exceptional and

41
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,320
do we

42
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
do we know if we'll ever have another

43
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,640
year like it you know we sure hope we do

44
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,520
it we hope we can improve on that

45
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:49,520
but

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,200
at the same time we're

47
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:53,840
we're optimists but we're we're still

48
00:01:51,200 --> 00:01:55,600
witnessed and if we can't go forward and

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,119
realize that we might not have another

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:59,200
good year like that we are being

51
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:00,479
truthful to ourselves and that's the

52
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:01,600
biggest thing we're honest with

53
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:03,759
ourselves we can be honest with

54
00:02:01,600 --> 00:02:06,240
everybody

55
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:09,200
the main thing about the growth that's a

56
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,039
great great number what have you

57
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:12,800
we measure our growth with customer

58
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:15,440
satisfaction

59
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:18,319
the customers are happy

60
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:19,520
tell your neighbor if you're upset

61
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:21,840
call me

62
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:24,319
call kemp that's what we're here for

63
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:26,160
because at the end of the day that's all

64
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:27,360
that matters i mean

65
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:29,120
we're here

66
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,319
we chose the profession to sell

67
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:32,640
equipment

68
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:34,879
in a rural area which is probably not

69
00:02:32,640 --> 00:02:36,560
the most glamorous for some people

70
00:02:34,879 --> 00:02:39,519
but you know what it's a great place to

71
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:41,440
raise your family the employees love it

72
00:02:39,519 --> 00:02:44,000
the some of the other amenities that we

73
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,800
have around here hunting fishing you

74
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,120
know

75
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:49,680
hear the birds sing so to speak on it

76
00:02:47,120 --> 00:02:51,680
which would drive a lot of people crazy

77
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:54,480
but if we didn't love what we were doing

78
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:57,040
we wouldn't be here and the customers is

79
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,640
our testament to it with our sales and

80
00:02:57,040 --> 00:03:00,640
things like that thing there at the end

81
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:03,640
of the day what we need to do to be

82
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:03,640
