fail now

11

[Music]

12
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:44,040
all right folks

13
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:50,000
I'm in the truck now

14
00:02:44,040 --> 00:02:53,160
and it is extremely hot out here uh

15
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:54,840
I had to stack all that or uh put all

16
00:02:53,160 --> 00:02:57,720
that hay and Rose

17
00:02:54,840 --> 00:03:00,000
our hay trailer will haul eight Bales at

18
00:02:57,720 --> 00:03:02,760
a time so I put it in eight Bell rows

19
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,620
all throughout the property

20
00:03:02,760 --> 00:03:06,239
so that I can just bring the truck and

21
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,680
trailer out here and have the tractor

22
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,200
sitting there and just load eight and

23
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:13,440
move on load eight and move on

24
00:03:10,200 --> 00:03:15,599
so anyway this was a lot easier way of

25
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:19,319
getting a count on actually how much hay

26
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:20,099
there actually was and

27
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:23,099
um

28
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:23,099
so

29
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:28,080
I'm just going to go around here and

30
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:30,300
show you what we got okay

31
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:33,959
in the in that little field that you saw

32
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:37,980
at the end of the hay cutting video that

33
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:39,659
they were cutting a little square field

34
00:03:37,980 --> 00:03:41,940
there are

35
00:03:39,659 --> 00:03:44,580
I have put eight Bales in here but

36
00:03:41,940 --> 00:03:46,140
they're it actually made Seven I brought

37
00:03:44,580 --> 00:03:51,720
one from outside

38
00:03:46,140 --> 00:03:54,980
to make an eight Bale row right there

39
00:03:51,720 --> 00:03:54,980
so there's eight

40
00:03:55,739 --> 00:04:02,459
all right let me go on across here

41
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,260
in this little field right here it made

42
00:04:02,459 --> 00:04:06,120
a lot because there was no second

43
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,519
cutting on it last year

44
00:04:06,120 --> 00:04:10,739
so it was the old stuff and the new

45
00:04:08,519 --> 00:04:13,260
stuff all together

46
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:17,040
and uh it actually made more hay it's

47
00:04:13,260 --> 00:04:18,540
two acres and it made Seven bales

48
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:21,060
so

49
00:04:18,540 --> 00:04:23,780
you go into the next field which is the

50
00:04:21,060 --> 00:04:23,780
big how you feel

51
00:04:23,940 --> 00:04:29,220
one of the big hay fields

52
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:32,820
and right here

53
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:36,660
we made a tiny one and then a about a

54
00:04:32,820 --> 00:04:38,639
half a bale and then there's a

55
00:04:36,660 --> 00:04:41,460
see how many we got there one two three

56
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:43,620
four five six seven and then a half a

57
00:04:41,460 --> 00:04:45,360
bell and then a tiny bell so we're going

58
00:04:43,620 --> 00:04:49,080
to consider that half a bell and a tiny

59
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:52,080
bell one Bell so eight Bells right there

60
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:55,580
all right so it's 16.

61
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,580
then we move across here

62
00:04:57,660 --> 00:05:02,340
and these hay fields are rough I know

63
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:03,780
they look smooth there's glass from the

64
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,639
air but

65
00:05:03,780 --> 00:05:07,639
hayfields are always rough

66
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:14,160
so

67
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:16,699
so we had 16 here's another eight Bale

68
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:16,699
row

69
00:05:17,040 --> 00:05:24,720
three four five six seven eight

70
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:27,500
so that makes 24. so we got 24 bales

71
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:27,500
so far

72
00:05:28,919 --> 00:05:34,580
all right

73
00:05:30,539 --> 00:05:34,580
24 then we'll go across here

74
00:05:34,860 --> 00:05:42,360
and here is another row

75
00:05:39,120 --> 00:05:45,440
of hey eight Bales there

76
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,440
so that makes

77
00:05:45,539 --> 00:05:48,360
30

78
00:05:46,860 --> 00:05:50,900
two

79
00:05:48,360 --> 00:05:50,900
all right

80
00:05:51,240 --> 00:05:56,639
so we got 32 Bales which is pretty sad

81
00:05:54,180 --> 00:05:58,919
for the amount of area that we we

82
00:05:56,639 --> 00:06:02,100
actually bailed we bailed it

83
00:05:58,919 --> 00:06:05,520
pretty huge area you saw from the air I

84
00:06:02,100 --> 00:06:07,680
mean I think I think all of the hay

85
00:06:05,520 --> 00:06:11,639
baling area

86
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,240
is about 60 Acres of open ground

87
00:06:11,639 --> 00:06:14,240
so

88
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:18,660
you know

89
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:23,600
we're not doing good so far on the

90
00:06:18,660 --> 00:06:23,600
amount of hate so we got 32 Bales so far

91
00:06:23,819 --> 00:06:29,120
now I'm going to take a shortcut

92
00:06:26,039 --> 00:06:29,120
up through here

93
00:06:30,840 --> 00:06:34,580
almost cut

94
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:34,580
field

95
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,800
on the neighbor area

96
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:49,639
all right

97
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:54,080
cut around behind here

98
00:06:54,360 --> 00:07:01,699
pretty narrow little spot right here

99
00:06:57,539 --> 00:07:01,699
all right remember we had 32 bales

100
00:07:01,800 --> 00:07:06,660
all right 32 bales

101
00:07:05,220 --> 00:07:11,180
right

102
00:07:06,660 --> 00:07:11,180
there's eight over there that's 40.

103
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:17,960
so there's

104
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,960
it makes 40

105
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,580
. there are eight Bales straight ahead

106
00:07:24,419 --> 00:07:28,080
of me

107
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,380
so that makes

108
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,419
48 with this eight here and then we go

109
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:37,400
get right over here

110
00:07:33,419 --> 00:07:37,400
and we have another eight

111
00:07:37,500 --> 00:07:44,479
right there

112
00:07:39,900 --> 00:07:44,479
so all in all we have

113
00:07:44,780 --> 00:07:49,460
56

114
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:49,460
bales

115
00:07:51,419 --> 00:07:54,560
56 bales

116
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:00,720
we fed about

117
00:07:57,800 --> 00:08:02,039
75 Bales last year

118
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:06,720
so

119
00:08:02,039 --> 00:08:11,460
and my brother needs at least 30.

120
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:14,639
so we're gonna have to at least make

121
00:08:11,460 --> 00:08:18,180
100 510 bales

122
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:23,039
uh in order to kind of break even this

123
00:08:18,180 --> 00:08:26,280
year so the good news is it well bad

124
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:29,160
news bad news it's a hundred today

125
00:08:26,280 --> 00:08:31,560
the good news is it's supposed to start

126
00:08:29,160 --> 00:08:33,539
cooling off today and there are chances

127
00:08:31,560 --> 00:08:35,640
of rain coming

128
00:08:33,539 --> 00:08:38,820
several chances of rain over the next

129
00:08:35,640 --> 00:08:40,560
two weeks they're not great chances but

130
00:08:38,820 --> 00:08:43,140
they are chances

131
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:44,880
so if we get some rain

132
00:08:43,140 --> 00:08:47,339
there's a possibility we can get that

133
00:08:44,880 --> 00:08:52,760
second cutting that we need but right

134
00:08:47,339 --> 00:08:52,760
now we are in a deficit on Hay

135
00:09:24,530 --> 00:09:36,739
[Applause]

136
00:09:39,600 --> 00:09:42,440
foreign

137
00:09:42,780 --> 00:09:45,940
[Applause]

138
00:09:54,019 --> 00:09:59,580
folks that is when the microphone

139
00:09:56,760 --> 00:10:02,640
decided to die so what we have here is

140
00:09:59,580 --> 00:10:04,500
we have a 32 10 10

141
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:07,140
uh

142
00:10:04,500 --> 00:10:09,300
ratio of fertilizer it is nitrogen

143
00:10:07,140 --> 00:10:12,600
phosphorus and potassium

144
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:15,060
32 nitrogen so it's a nitrogen Rich what

145
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:19,080
they do is they take a skid steer and

146
00:10:15,060 --> 00:10:20,160
they load this Hopper with the amount

147
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:23,880
that we wanted

148
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,339
it goes from the Hopper into a tumbler

149
00:10:23,880 --> 00:10:28,860
and what that does is just like Mixing

150
00:10:26,339 --> 00:10:32,339
concrete it goes into that um

151
00:10:28,860 --> 00:10:36,180
into that shot in there by the conveyor

152
00:10:32,339 --> 00:10:37,140
and it is mixed up well inside of that

153
00:10:36,180 --> 00:10:40,380
uh

154
00:10:37,140 --> 00:10:44,579
inside of that uh little tumbler there

155
00:10:40,380 --> 00:10:47,279
so then after it is mixed well in the

156
00:10:44,579 --> 00:10:49,560
tumbler it goes on to that conveyor belt

157
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:52,920
it's right there below it and that

158
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:56,640
conveyor belt it runs up and it loads

159
00:10:52,920 --> 00:11:00,180
itself right into the uh trailer that

160
00:10:56,640 --> 00:11:04,920
I'm pulling the fertilizer trailer

161
00:11:00,180 --> 00:11:09,060
so this is purchased four tons of this

162
00:11:04,920 --> 00:11:11,399
and uh the uh and I and I hate it

163
00:11:09,060 --> 00:11:12,959
because he he wanted to know what I was

164
00:11:11,399 --> 00:11:15,360
doing what I was feeling I believe his

165
00:11:12,959 --> 00:11:16,860
name is either I think it's Jason or

166
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,620
Jaden

167
00:11:16,860 --> 00:11:22,140
um he was helping me out with uh

168
00:11:19,620 --> 00:11:24,779
with putting the fertilizer in there

169
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:27,000
and he was doing a he was doing a

170
00:11:24,779 --> 00:11:29,579
bang-up job and uh

171
00:11:27,000 --> 00:11:31,800
I really appreciate his help getting me

172
00:11:29,579 --> 00:11:33,720
lined up getting the the trailer lined

173
00:11:31,800 --> 00:11:36,360
up and uh that's where I can get on it

174
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:38,399
real good and uh and smoothing out the

175
00:11:36,360 --> 00:11:40,620
fertilizer so it wasn't

176
00:11:38,399 --> 00:11:41,880
you know flying out whenever I was going

177
00:11:40,620 --> 00:11:45,240
down the road

178
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:48,120
so yep I appreciated their help down at

179
00:11:45,240 --> 00:11:51,720
the co-op so anyway

180
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:53,519
uh the fertilizer cost was

181
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:56,839
a little bit north of twenty five

182
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:56,839
hundred dollars so

183
00:11:57,950 --> 00:12:16,140
[Music]

184
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:18,660
okay this is more area where the audio

185
00:12:16,140 --> 00:12:20,760
was broken so what I'm showing is how to

186
00:12:18,660 --> 00:12:22,620
work the fertilizer trailer so what you

187
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,140
do is you pull this pin right here that

188
00:12:22,620 --> 00:12:27,240
holds a lever once you get the pin out

189
00:12:25,140 --> 00:12:28,200
you're able to move the lever to the

190
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:30,060
side

191
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,820
and what you're trying to do is you

192
00:12:30,060 --> 00:12:35,760
slide it up past this plate right here

193
00:12:32,820 --> 00:12:37,620
and then you lock it in once you do that

194
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:39,480
that rod runs this little wheel with

195
00:12:37,620 --> 00:12:42,180
fins on it which pushes down into that

196
00:12:39,480 --> 00:12:43,920
tire which engages that and then you'll

197
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:47,040
see right here there's some belts that

198
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:49,920
run the actual conveyor system and the

199
00:12:47,040 --> 00:12:52,740
uh and the actual Spinners that that

200
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,500
throw the fertilizer this is a gauge

201
00:12:52,740 --> 00:12:57,959
that shows uh actually a chart that

202
00:12:55,500 --> 00:12:59,820
shows if you want to flow a certain

203
00:12:57,959 --> 00:13:01,980
amount of fertilizer then you have a

204
00:12:59,820 --> 00:13:05,220
gate opening rate that you use so we're

205
00:13:01,980 --> 00:13:07,440
going to do a 200 pounds per acre and

206
00:13:05,220 --> 00:13:12,420
it's going to be like a two and a half

207
00:13:07,440 --> 00:13:16,500
inch uh gate opening and and I run the

208
00:13:12,420 --> 00:13:19,800
truck at about oh five to seven miles an

209
00:13:16,500 --> 00:13:21,540
hour to get the required 200 pounds of

210
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,720
fertilizer so what I'm doing right here

211
00:13:21,540 --> 00:13:26,160
is I'm actually opening that gate up to

212
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,339
the two and a half

213
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:31,740
inch Mark to allow the fertilizer to

214
00:13:29,339 --> 00:13:34,139
flow and that you can see the fertilizer

215
00:13:31,740 --> 00:13:36,540
is sitting actually on a conveyor and it

216
00:13:34,139 --> 00:13:38,579
brings it back and runs it onto these uh

217
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:40,740
actual spinner wheels that are that that

218
00:13:38,579 --> 00:13:45,800
I failed to get

219
00:13:40,740 --> 00:13:45,800

236
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:44,820
folks I've got all the fertilizer

237
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,640
sprayed I got to spread all over the

238
00:18:44,820 --> 00:18:49,140
property here where the cattle are where

239
00:18:47,640 --> 00:18:52,260
uh

240
00:18:49,140 --> 00:18:54,179
where the hay is

241
00:18:52,260 --> 00:18:57,780
you can see

242
00:18:54,179 --> 00:19:00,240
the nitrogen on the ground here

243
00:18:57,780 --> 00:19:02,640
so what we're attempting to do now is

244
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:05,280
wait wait out the rain

245
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,240
when the rain comes

246
00:19:05,280 --> 00:19:12,860
then this will just uh just take off

247
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:12,860
but in the meantime

248
00:19:13,980 --> 00:19:18,840
I saw something whenever I was driving

249
00:19:15,660 --> 00:19:20,960
around here and I need to find it if I

250
00:19:18,840 --> 00:19:20,960
can

251
00:19:21,240 --> 00:19:24,720
um

252
00:19:22,620 --> 00:19:26,280
I didn't I didn't think it was going to

253
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:29,520
be this quick but

254
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:33,860
I believe we've got a new baby calf

255
00:19:29,520 --> 00:19:33,860
so let me find that if I can

256
00:19:40,380 --> 00:19:44,480
I'm looking oh there she is

257
00:19:51,780 --> 00:19:55,160
right here

258
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:59,520
baby

259
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:07,220
this is 23 Cal

260
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,780
she is Minnie's mama

261
00:20:10,260 --> 00:20:15,440
and that is Danny's first baby and look

262
00:20:12,780 --> 00:20:15,440
at them ears

263
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:19,980
and this baby appears to have just been

264
00:20:18,840 --> 00:20:21,419
born

265
00:20:19,980 --> 00:20:23,820
but it's up

266
00:20:21,419 --> 00:20:27,080
and it's moving around well and she

267
00:20:23,820 --> 00:20:27,080
looks like she's got a bag

268
00:20:28,620 --> 00:20:31,760
oh don't fall down

269
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:39,419
I wonder if this was a little

270
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:42,120
bull or a heifer

271
00:20:39,419 --> 00:20:44,900
oh look at those ears you sure tell

272
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:44,900
Danny's your daddy

273
00:20:45,720 --> 00:20:51,539
uh we got some little heifer

274
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:53,179
a little heifer

275
00:20:51,539 --> 00:20:56,720
so

276
00:20:53,179 --> 00:20:56,720
that's a keeper

277
00:20:59,720 --> 00:21:03,900
all right

278
00:21:02,220 --> 00:21:05,580
I'm just gonna kind of leave them alone

279
00:21:03,900 --> 00:21:08,340
for a minute

280
00:21:05,580 --> 00:21:10,320
I need some help with this

281
00:21:08,340 --> 00:21:12,539
I need to get a I need to get an ear tag

282
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:15,419
in that calf but

283
00:21:12,539 --> 00:21:17,400
let me see if I can maybe my brother's

284
00:21:15,419 --> 00:21:20,039
home and he can come give me a hand I

285
00:21:17,400 --> 00:21:22,559
don't know we will see I'm gonna leave

286
00:21:20,039 --> 00:21:24,419
them alone for a minute

287
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
anyway

288
00:21:24,419 --> 00:21:29,820

followed by

298
00:21:47,700 --> 00:21:55,440
two or three of the other cattle so uh

299
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:57,539
yep Oreo is coming she'll be next so

300
00:21:55,440 --> 00:22:01,020
that'll be the next calf

00:21:57,539 --> 00:22:03,179
that update should be just any day

302
00:22:01,020 --> 00:22:05,280
all right what a day

303
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:08,640
what a day we got the fertilizing all

304
00:22:05,280 --> 00:22:10,980
done on both properties on the uh on the

305
00:22:08,640 --> 00:22:11,940
hay field and out here at uh where the

306
00:22:10,980 --> 00:22:15,240
cattle are

307
00:22:11,940 --> 00:22:18,120
uh we have a we had a complete surprise

308
00:22:15,240 --> 00:22:21,419
when we got here whenever I uh found

309
00:22:18,120 --> 00:22:24,539
that uh number 20 or number 23 cow had

310
00:22:21,419 --> 00:22:28,020
had a nice little heifer calf out of

311
00:22:24,539 --> 00:22:31,380
Danny this is our first calf from Danny

312
00:22:28,020 --> 00:22:33,539
and you know you always wonder if that

313
00:22:31,380 --> 00:22:35,580
bull that you bought is going to be a

314
00:22:33,539 --> 00:22:38,220
good bull you know we bought that bull

315
00:22:35,580 --> 00:22:41,400
we didn't test him ourselves but what

316
00:22:38,220 --> 00:22:43,140
the fellow told us he tested him he come

317
00:22:41,400 --> 00:22:44,820
out good and he showed me pictures of

318
00:22:43,140 --> 00:22:47,460
all of his calves and he had a lot of

319
00:22:44,820 --> 00:22:49,620
nice calves and you can definitely tell

320
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:54,120
this is Danny's baby I mean he's got 30

321
00:22:49,620 --> 00:22:57,299
those ears so uh but anyway we

322
00:22:54,120 --> 00:22:59,820
so now we've got the a new calf we got

323
00:22:57,299 --> 00:23:02,340
everything all fertilized up

324
00:22:59,820 --> 00:23:03,539
I guess the next thing I got to do is I

325
00:23:02,340 --> 00:23:05,700
got to come out here and do some brush

326
00:23:03,539 --> 00:23:07,679
hogging I need to ear tag this calf it's

327
00:23:05,700 --> 00:23:10,200
a little bit uh

328
00:23:07,679 --> 00:23:12,600
I've got to get that that buggy back to

329
00:23:10,200 --> 00:23:14,280
the co-op because I've got it rented and

330
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,059
I I've got to get it back before they

331
00:23:14,280 --> 00:23:20,820
close so I'm going to run it back and

332
00:23:18,059 --> 00:23:23,400
I need to brush hog here

333
00:23:20,820 --> 00:23:25,020
I noticed that uh the Briar is down on

334
00:23:23,400 --> 00:23:26,580
the on their side of the pond are really

335
00:23:25,020 --> 00:23:28,559
taking over so I need to come down and

336
00:23:26,580 --> 00:23:30,659
brush hog and I need to see if I can get

337
00:23:28,559 --> 00:23:34,880
an ear tag in that calf so that'll

338
00:23:30,659 --> 00:23:34,880
probably be the next time so anyway

339
00:23:35,039 --> 00:23:42,360
