  "text": "what is the fastest way to level up your hourglass for Guardians of Fortune to be honest this has been a mystery to me since hourglass pvp's launch back in season 8. but thanks to fellow content creator toxy Sinclair's latest video we have a new strategy in town that is exactly what we're going to be doing in this video copying um I mean taking inspiration from an amazing video which you should all check out in the description of this video and practicing it on my own terms I mean that wasn't the intention of one of my streams twitch.tv Mystic but when things got interesting I decided it was worth a shot in today's adventure so what is the strategy we aren't going to go the conventional route here and dive below the waves to match make instead we're gonna let the people invade our servers why would anyone do this if you may ask well it's so that we can take advantage of one of the most forgotten features that season 8 brought us the treasure grade you see toxy discovered that regular old Merchant Commodities boost faction grade and as you can imagine farming Commodities from Outpost Outpost is not too difficult of a task there is only one problem though in order to purchase Commodities you need to be a representative of the merchant Alliance and with the fast queue times on EU servers this could become a problem as we would want to end up with grade 5 faction stash but also grade 5 Athena Emissary which requires at least two fights to achieve again I didn't originally plan on doing this method but after my second fight well thank you [\u00a0__\u00a0] you're a streamer huh mistakes your butt blank's friend Birch plank oh right you actually do holy shh [Music] oh I'm gonna get stolen Commodities let's go wait I actually kind of want this things changed so there I was faced with a decision do I risk my streak and go for toxic strategy or call it quits and sell as you can imagine from the title of this video there was no quitting we was going for the faction champion after purchasing Commodities I re-raised Athena Emissary in the case of evasion however I happen to notice a grade 5 merch in Emissary and for sure knew this was going to be the key to getting grade 5 faction stash am I supposed to feel bad I he left okay the thing is people I I need I need his supplies I need his loot you know pirating is just you know it is where you make it right after sinking the ship and starting to board on the treasure we had done it we had successfully reached grade five but just as that happened well we were invaded I knew this would happen right we're grade five Let's uh let's vacate foreign how does this dude have legendary Sea Dog chat I think he's an average tdmr we sank our third ship of the day and decided to travel over to plunder Outpost as this is the closest Outpost nearby where we could sell all of our loot without complications here would be where we would wait in preparation for our fourth and Final Fight for faction Champion we waited for a lot longer than expected as the server seemed to be full so after removing one AFK Sloop later and waiting for our next battle well let's just say it's not how I was expecting to reach faction champion break has gone so okay and now I'm able to vote so is there someone on the island [Music] [Music] yes okay right trap here we go okay they didn't bother turning so there's now a thought of the Damned on the server okay where did they go I think is he trying to sell to the force adapt no I don't Fort Rudder maybe maybe it was meant to be what what the hell is that oh man oh man I don't like this all right let's see how much rep we got come on let's see the wrap bro I got a whole lot a whole level for that whole level try I got a whole level this isn't exactly how I pictured my last battle going and was contemplating continuing this streak however I decided against this as I fought a fortune spawned on the server meaning that the likelihood of invasion was very slim due to the players not leaving our Waters however after all of the fighting the reputation gained by reaching faction Champion while at grade 5 seemed to be worth it that is if you're lucky enough to consistently be invaded been feeling see what rewards we get I don't think you get anything extra for having ending with a grade five okay so let's see let's see the wrap the whole level basically in conclusion do I recommend giving this a try sure but it's a very circumstantial and requires a lot of luck once again thank you toxy for making your video on this strategy without your inspiration I would have never thought to give this a try so people make sure to check out this video in the description and show some love but until the next adventure make sure to leave
