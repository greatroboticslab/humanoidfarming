00:00:56,250 --> 00:01:01,379
home and give my baby a bath a few

25
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,030
minutes before and they can then give

00:01:08,310 --> 00:01:14,040
it's beneficial as well and I know that

00:01:09,990 --> 00:01:15,570
a lot of people also listen we'll listen

31
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:18,780
to the recording as well I know I had a

32
00:01:15,570 --> 00:01:21,570
few people asking about that so so ask

33
00:01:18,780 --> 00:01:23,040
the questions because then the people

34
00:01:21,570 --> 00:01:27,479
that are going to be listening to the

35
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:29,970
recording get some good feedback so so

36
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:32,909
I'll go ahead and get started the first

37
00:01:29,970 --> 00:01:34,820
question I have actually I know Eric

38
00:01:32,909 --> 00:01:38,189
mentioned that he's from out of state

39
00:01:34,820 --> 00:01:41,130
let me see so if you can if you're from

40
00:01:38,189 --> 00:01:44,009
Vermont can you check check the yes

41
00:01:41,130 --> 00:01:51,600
button if those of you remember how to

42
00:01:44,009 --> 00:01:52,979
do that okay see two so if you're from

43
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:55,670
out of state and you can click the no

44
00:01:52,979 --> 00:01:55,670
button I guess

45
00:02:01,479 --> 00:02:06,799
okay great all right well that's good to

46
00:02:04,729 --> 00:02:11,060
just have a little bit of a little bit

47
00:02:06,799 --> 00:02:13,040
of idea because so tonight I'm going to

48
00:02:11,060 --> 00:02:15,620
talk i'm going to start out with talking

49
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:19,910
about food regulations for the state of

50
00:02:15,620 --> 00:02:22,760
Vermont so so Eric and anybody that's

51
00:02:19,910 --> 00:02:24,170
listening to the recording later you

52
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:26,330
know these rate you'll have to find out

53
00:02:24,170 --> 00:02:30,470
from your state of course what exactly

54
00:02:26,330 --> 00:02:32,540
the regulations are but but you know

55
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:34,220
some of the some of the same principles

56
00:02:32,540 --> 00:02:37,760
might be true in other states but they

57
00:02:34,220 --> 00:02:39,950
could also of course be different so so

58
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:42,590
I'll talk about our regulations here in

59
00:02:39,950 --> 00:02:45,590
Vermont and then don't I see sandy is

60
00:02:42,590 --> 00:02:47,510
from Vermont too so thank you so I'll

61
00:02:45,590 --> 00:02:50,140
talk then i'll talk about federal

62
00:02:47,510 --> 00:02:53,060
regulations and that applies to everyone

63
00:02:50,140 --> 00:02:54,950
obviously and then and then i'll talk a

64
00:02:53,060 --> 00:02:59,269
little about food safety best practices

65
00:02:54,950 --> 00:03:03,019
and until you know this the webinar is

66
00:02:59,269 --> 00:03:04,850
kind of geared for farmers that you know

67
00:03:03,019 --> 00:03:06,470
you might be used to growing you know

68
00:03:04,850 --> 00:03:09,230
fresh whole produce and selling

69
00:03:06,470 --> 00:03:12,260
threshold produce and now you're wanting

70
00:03:09,230 --> 00:03:14,959
to get into selling you know some sort

71
00:03:12,260 --> 00:03:16,549
of value-added products and so i'll try

72
00:03:14,959 --> 00:03:20,150
to kind of highlight the things that are

73
00:03:16,549 --> 00:03:22,459
different between threshold produce and

74
00:03:20,150 --> 00:03:23,959
in value added of course a lot of things

75
00:03:22,459 --> 00:03:27,350
are the same too but there's some things

76
00:03:23,959 --> 00:03:28,819
that will be different so and as Jeff

77
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,859
you mentioned that you have questions

78
00:03:28,819 --> 00:03:34,130
throughout the presentation please feel

79
00:03:30,859 --> 00:03:36,470
free to take feel free to write your

80
00:03:34,130 --> 00:03:38,870
questions in the chat box and I can

81
00:03:36,470 --> 00:03:42,950
answer them during our I can we might

82
00:03:38,870 --> 00:03:44,569
like say to them to the end as well but

83
00:03:42,950 --> 00:03:46,160
but if you have a question during the

84
00:03:44,569 --> 00:03:50,120
presentation go ahead and write it down

85
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:51,410
before you forget so um so the first

86
00:03:50,120 --> 00:03:54,049
thing that I want to start talking

87
00:03:51,410 --> 00:03:55,250
talking about Ned's Jessie said I my

88
00:03:54,049 --> 00:03:57,440
title is extension food safety

89
00:03:55,250 --> 00:03:59,810
specialist and I studied public health

90
00:03:57,440 --> 00:04:01,609
and so I'm always interested in a little

91
00:03:59,810 --> 00:04:03,889
bit about statistics and how many people

92
00:04:01,609 --> 00:04:06,859
actually are getting sick from foodborne

93
00:04:03,889 --> 00:04:09,350
illness and and you know so you can see

94
00:04:06,859 --> 00:04:10,790
the statistics listed there but the

95
00:04:09,350 --> 00:04:12,970
thing is that these statistics are

96
00:04:10,790 --> 00:04:16,540
really underreported

97
00:04:12,970 --> 00:04:20,150
and the statistics are usually kind of

98
00:04:16,540 --> 00:04:22,760
skewed a little bit towards towards

99
00:04:20,150 --> 00:04:25,730
large-scale agriculture outbreaks from

100
00:04:22,760 --> 00:04:29,000
large-scale agriculture because of the

101
00:04:25,730 --> 00:04:31,570
way that you know reporting happens you

102
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:34,070
know if you have diarrhea or vomiting

103
00:04:31,570 --> 00:04:36,470
you know not very many of us actually go

104
00:04:34,070 --> 00:04:38,540
to the doctor when that happens I know I

105
00:04:36,470 --> 00:04:41,810
had it a few weekends ago and I didn't

106
00:04:38,540 --> 00:04:43,040
go as a doctor so first you have to go

107
00:04:41,810 --> 00:04:44,810
to the doctors and the deck dress to

108
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,630
take a stool sample and then there has

109
00:04:44,810 --> 00:04:51,980
to be enough people that have that same

110
00:04:47,630 --> 00:04:54,320
strain of microorganism for them to be

111
00:04:51,980 --> 00:04:56,840
able to say oh I wonder if this is you

112
00:04:54,320 --> 00:05:00,110
know this is all from the same same

113
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:03,410
source and so there has to be a lot of

114
00:05:00,110 --> 00:05:05,720
people that ate that food products for

115
00:05:03,410 --> 00:05:08,570
it to actually show up as being a you

116
00:05:05,720 --> 00:05:13,040
know foodborne disease outbreaks so so

117
00:05:08,570 --> 00:05:15,050
all that to say that you know people

118
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:17,210
could get sick from from even

119
00:05:15,050 --> 00:05:18,800
small-scale agriculture but it just

120
00:05:17,210 --> 00:05:20,750
doesn't show up on the radar very

121
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:23,950
awesome because not as many people are

122
00:05:20,750 --> 00:05:29,240
eating food made by you know produced by

123
00:05:23,950 --> 00:05:31,150
a small local producer but but also I

124
00:05:29,240 --> 00:05:34,040
want to make sure I emphasize that

125
00:05:31,150 --> 00:05:37,370
products from small-scale producers can

126
00:05:34,040 --> 00:05:39,620
be very safe and products from large

127
00:05:37,370 --> 00:05:41,270
scale producers can be not safe or they

128
00:05:39,620 --> 00:05:43,790
can be saved you know it all depends on

129
00:05:41,270 --> 00:05:45,470
your practices so so that's the

130
00:05:43,790 --> 00:05:47,810
important thing they really want to make

131
00:05:45,470 --> 00:05:49,130
sure that everybody you know understand

132
00:05:47,810 --> 00:05:51,560
and obviously those of you that are

133
00:05:49,130 --> 00:05:53,390
listening obviously you think support

134
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:55,820
food safety is important otherwise you

135
00:05:53,390 --> 00:05:59,210
wouldn't be spending your hour with us

136
00:05:55,820 --> 00:06:04,400
tonight so so I'm preaching to the choir

137
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:07,000
so to say input borne illness in you

138
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:09,440
know if you're a generally a healthy

139
00:06:07,000 --> 00:06:12,200
healthy adult you know you don't have

140
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:14,180
any major you know major health issues

141
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:16,040
generally speaking foodborne illness

142
00:06:14,180 --> 00:06:19,070
probably probably isn't as big of a

143
00:06:16,040 --> 00:06:20,810
concern for you but if you're selling to

144
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:24,169
any of these groups that are listed on

145
00:06:20,810 --> 00:06:25,700
this slide you know to young people all

146
00:06:24,169 --> 00:06:28,090
these children too

147
00:06:25,700 --> 00:06:30,890
older people if you're selling to

148
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:34,040
nursing homes or maybe a senior center

149
00:06:30,890 --> 00:06:35,660
or you know pregnant women pregnant

150
00:06:34,040 --> 00:06:38,990
women are especially susceptible to

151
00:06:35,660 --> 00:06:42,430
listeria and because the Syria can cross

152
00:06:38,990 --> 00:06:45,740
the placenta and can even cause

153
00:06:42,430 --> 00:06:48,280
miscarriage so you know of course

154
00:06:45,740 --> 00:06:50,360
pregnant women by you know most products

155
00:06:48,280 --> 00:06:52,880
and you know if you're selling to

156
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:55,280
hospitals or anywhere where there might

157
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,500
be sick people you know you really have

158
00:06:55,280 --> 00:07:01,790
to be concerned with especially

159
00:06:57,500 --> 00:07:03,350
concerned with food food safety and so I

160
00:07:01,790 --> 00:07:05,120
since I've already mentioned my daughter

161
00:07:03,350 --> 00:07:08,030
this is a picture of my daughter about a

162
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,710
year ago actually so she's quite a bit

163
00:07:08,030 --> 00:07:12,430
older and has more hair here and this is

164
00:07:09,710 --> 00:07:14,840
my grandma and when I when I think about

165
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:16,760
the importance of food safety I really

166
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,830
think about you know these two extremes

167
00:07:16,760 --> 00:07:21,260
that I've you know that you really want

168
00:07:18,830 --> 00:07:24,770
to make sure that your product is safe

169
00:07:21,260 --> 00:07:32,840
for for those you know for those sort of

170
00:07:24,770 --> 00:07:35,000
groups so to start out with you know

171
00:07:32,840 --> 00:07:37,790
just generally speaking like if i want

172
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:40,760
to start making salsa i want to start

173
00:07:37,790 --> 00:07:43,010
making jams and jellies ors bread or

174
00:07:40,760 --> 00:07:46,760
something you know what what regulations

175
00:07:43,010 --> 00:07:48,920
do i need to follow anyway so the first

176
00:07:46,760 --> 00:07:51,280
question I always ask people is as well

177
00:07:48,920 --> 00:07:54,650
if you're just selling in your state

178
00:07:51,280 --> 00:07:56,540
then really it's the state regulations

179
00:07:54,650 --> 00:07:59,210
that apply so you need to follow your

180
00:07:56,540 --> 00:08:01,430
state regulations once you start selling

181
00:07:59,210 --> 00:08:06,440
across state lines then you need to pay

182
00:08:01,430 --> 00:08:08,390
attention to federal regulations and

183
00:08:06,440 --> 00:08:10,280
when you're selling across state lines

184
00:08:08,390 --> 00:08:11,690
there's no sighs exemptions no matter if

185
00:08:10,280 --> 00:08:13,910
you're selling ten dollars worth of

186
00:08:11,690 --> 00:08:15,530
products or a thousand dollars worth of

187
00:08:13,910 --> 00:08:18,710
products you have to meet the federal

188
00:08:15,530 --> 00:08:20,750
requirements I'll be talking about the

189
00:08:18,710 --> 00:08:24,080
Food Safety Modernization Act and some

190
00:08:20,750 --> 00:08:28,730
upcoming slides and that could really

191
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:30,880
change things in terms of you know if

192
00:08:28,730 --> 00:08:33,770
people if you're only selling in state

193
00:08:30,880 --> 00:08:35,630
you might have to might have to fall

194
00:08:33,770 --> 00:08:39,320
this food safety modernization act so

195
00:08:35,630 --> 00:08:41,419
that that's right now there's

196
00:08:39,320 --> 00:08:43,820
rules are in the proposed rule stage and

197
00:08:41,419 --> 00:08:46,490
that's from FDA so i'll talk about that

198
00:08:43,820 --> 00:08:48,790
in a minute if you're selling your

199
00:08:46,490 --> 00:08:52,040
products to grocery stores or coops

200
00:08:48,790 --> 00:08:55,670
distributors they may have stricter

201
00:08:52,040 --> 00:08:57,260
requirements then then the regulatory

202
00:08:55,670 --> 00:08:59,450
requirements so you need to be sure to

203
00:08:57,260 --> 00:09:03,110
check with them I know a lot of

204
00:08:59,450 --> 00:09:05,150
specialty food producers you know their

205
00:09:03,110 --> 00:09:07,790
goal is to sell to somebody like Whole

206
00:09:05,150 --> 00:09:09,950
Foods someday and I mean that's it's

207
00:09:07,790 --> 00:09:12,020
great you know it's a great market it's

208
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,390
a you know a great place to sell your

209
00:09:12,020 --> 00:09:15,890
products but they do have really strict

210
00:09:14,390 --> 00:09:18,410
requirements they because they have a

211
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:22,040
lot stricter requirements than the

212
00:09:18,410 --> 00:09:23,540
government regulation so and even if

213
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:27,650
you're selling to distributors that are

214
00:09:23,540 --> 00:09:29,300
selling to kind of larger specialty food

215
00:09:27,650 --> 00:09:31,880
stores in larger cities such as in

216
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:34,280
Vermont I know I have I work with

217
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,410
someone that sells to the cells to a

218
00:09:34,280 --> 00:09:38,690
distributor that distributes in to

219
00:09:36,410 --> 00:09:41,330
specialty food stores in Boston and she

220
00:09:38,690 --> 00:09:44,270
has to have a hasit plan and some

221
00:09:41,330 --> 00:09:45,980
additional food safety plans just to be

222
00:09:44,270 --> 00:09:47,960
able to sell them so just check with

223
00:09:45,980 --> 00:09:51,230
your buyer to find out what their

224
00:09:47,960 --> 00:09:53,120
requirements are again in the state of

225
00:09:51,230 --> 00:09:55,160
Vermont to decide sure it's true in most

226
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:57,650
states if you're selling to restaurants

227
00:09:55,160 --> 00:10:01,310
you have to follow the state regulation

228
00:09:57,650 --> 00:10:03,650
there's no sighs exemptions because the

229
00:10:01,310 --> 00:10:07,280
restaurant has to buy products only from

230
00:10:03,650 --> 00:10:09,440
an approved source and so I'll talk in a

231
00:10:07,280 --> 00:10:11,240
minute about these exemptions that are

232
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:12,830
in Vermont but but if you're selling

233
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:16,550
your restaurants those exemptions don't

234
00:10:12,830 --> 00:10:18,380
apply to you and then if you're selling

235
00:10:16,550 --> 00:10:21,560
to farmers market selling at farmers

236
00:10:18,380 --> 00:10:22,550
markets there's not there's depending on

237
00:10:21,560 --> 00:10:23,900
what you're selling if you're selling

238
00:10:22,550 --> 00:10:26,630
prepared foods there are some additional

239
00:10:23,900 --> 00:10:28,040
regulations and some temperatures that

240
00:10:26,630 --> 00:10:30,250
you need to be concerned with I actually

241
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:32,750
did a webinar on this a week or two ago

242
00:10:30,250 --> 00:10:37,340
and I have a number of fact sheets as

243
00:10:32,750 --> 00:10:38,840
well on sorry regulations that best

244
00:10:37,340 --> 00:10:42,800
practices for selling at farmer's

245
00:10:38,840 --> 00:10:44,960
markets so i'll have a link to that

246
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:50,840
website at the end where you can find

247
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:52,730
more information on that okay so so i'm

248
00:10:50,840 --> 00:10:54,170
going to start with talking about the

249
00:10:52,730 --> 00:10:57,230
so as i said i'll start with the state

250
00:10:54,170 --> 00:11:00,410
of Vermont and these are the Health

251
00:10:57,230 --> 00:11:02,510
Department regulations and those of you

252
00:11:00,410 --> 00:11:05,209
that just join I saw Michelle and rac1

253
00:11:02,510 --> 00:11:07,850
joined I asked at the beginning and if

254
00:11:05,209 --> 00:11:12,500
you don't mind if you're from the state

255
00:11:07,850 --> 00:11:15,320
of Vermont there's a above your name

256
00:11:12,500 --> 00:11:17,540
there's a checkbox and there's a green

257
00:11:15,320 --> 00:11:19,250
check for yes and a red check for know

258
00:11:17,540 --> 00:11:21,230
if you don't mind if you're from the

259
00:11:19,250 --> 00:11:24,589
state of Vermont those of you that just

260
00:11:21,230 --> 00:11:26,540
joined if you could click yes if you're

261
00:11:24,589 --> 00:11:28,190
from Vermont and click the red mill if

262
00:11:26,540 --> 00:11:31,160
you're not from Vermont just just so I

263
00:11:28,190 --> 00:11:33,680
have an idea of who we're talking to so

264
00:11:31,160 --> 00:11:36,550
racy is not from Vermont and that's fine

265
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:39,680
just just wanted to just wanted to check

266
00:11:36,550 --> 00:11:44,750
maybe Michelle still finding it okay

267
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:46,190
that's fine all right so so back to the

268
00:11:44,750 --> 00:11:47,389
Vermont regulations that again and

269
00:11:46,190 --> 00:11:49,370
you're so you'll have to check in your

270
00:11:47,389 --> 00:11:53,540
state exactly what el k Michelle is from

271
00:11:49,370 --> 00:11:55,100
Vermont thank you so at you'll have to

272
00:11:53,540 --> 00:11:58,370
check in your state what the regulations

273
00:11:55,100 --> 00:11:59,779
are but in Vermont and you need to have

274
00:11:58,370 --> 00:12:02,959
something called a food processors

275
00:11:59,779 --> 00:12:07,699
license if you're doing you know jams

276
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:09,589
jellies salsa what else candy those sort

277
00:12:07,699 --> 00:12:11,959
of things those off under the food

278
00:12:09,589 --> 00:12:14,300
processors license however there is an

279
00:12:11,959 --> 00:12:16,910
exemption that if you're selling less

280
00:12:14,300 --> 00:12:18,860
okay Tracy's from New York thank you if

281
00:12:16,910 --> 00:12:20,449
you're selling less than ten thousand

282
00:12:18,860 --> 00:12:23,779
dollars worth of product per year you

283
00:12:20,449 --> 00:12:27,500
don't need to have a food processors

284
00:12:23,779 --> 00:12:29,180
license so so you don't you're not

285
00:12:27,500 --> 00:12:31,279
regulated if you're selling less than

286
00:12:29,180 --> 00:12:32,870
ten thousand dollars per year in the

287
00:12:31,279 --> 00:12:35,630
state of Vermont and I know that New

288
00:12:32,870 --> 00:12:38,569
York is stricter than that and i'm

289
00:12:35,630 --> 00:12:40,790
guessing virginia is as well so so

290
00:12:38,569 --> 00:12:43,880
vermont it has a little bit more lenient

291
00:12:40,790 --> 00:12:46,970
in that regard and just to mention as

292
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:53,060
well if you are selling acidified foods

293
00:12:46,970 --> 00:12:57,230
which would be salsas and if you're

294
00:12:53,060 --> 00:12:59,029
selling pickles anything that that's

295
00:12:57,230 --> 00:13:01,819
kind of a vegetable that's had some

296
00:12:59,029 --> 00:13:04,370
vinegar added to it and you're selling

297
00:13:01,819 --> 00:13:06,270
it shelf-stable those are considered

298
00:13:04,370 --> 00:13:07,410
acidified foods and

299
00:13:06,270 --> 00:13:10,500
you have to have what's called a

300
00:13:07,410 --> 00:13:11,790
scheduled process for that so if you

301
00:13:10,500 --> 00:13:13,710
have questions on the scheduling process

302
00:13:11,790 --> 00:13:17,970
I can I can provide you with more

303
00:13:13,710 --> 00:13:20,130
information on that so if you're selling

304
00:13:17,970 --> 00:13:22,980
baked goods like you know breads cakes

305
00:13:20,130 --> 00:13:26,130
etc then you need a bakery license again

306
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:27,600
there's an exemption on so you need that

307
00:13:26,130 --> 00:13:30,990
license if you're selling more than

308
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:33,390
6,500 dollars per year so if you're just

309
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,430
doing a few farmers market selling you

310
00:13:33,390 --> 00:13:36,810
know two hundred dollars or it will

311
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,400
hopefully a little more than that three

312
00:13:36,810 --> 00:13:41,120
hundred four hundred dollars worth of

313
00:13:38,400 --> 00:13:46,440
baked goods you don't need a license in

314
00:13:41,120 --> 00:13:48,870
Vermont if you're selling juice then you

315
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:51,270
need to have a food processors license

316
00:13:48,870 --> 00:13:52,650
again if you're selling more than ten

317
00:13:51,270 --> 00:13:54,630
thousand dollars so if you're under that

318
00:13:52,650 --> 00:13:58,050
you don't need a food processor license

319
00:13:54,630 --> 00:14:00,690
for juice if you're selling juice out of

320
00:13:58,050 --> 00:14:03,120
state you are required to have a hassle

321
00:14:00,690 --> 00:14:05,940
plan which is a hazard analysis and

322
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:08,010
critical control points plan if you're

323
00:14:05,940 --> 00:14:10,110
selling in in the state of Vermont they

324
00:14:08,010 --> 00:14:11,700
just request that you have a hassett

325
00:14:10,110 --> 00:14:16,050
plan that's not really a legal

326
00:14:11,700 --> 00:14:17,370
requirement if you are and again half

327
00:14:16,050 --> 00:14:20,130
the plans I can provide more information

328
00:14:17,370 --> 00:14:24,750
on that if you're interested if you're

329
00:14:20,130 --> 00:14:26,310
selling seafood then there's no sighs

330
00:14:24,750 --> 00:14:29,370
exemption no matter how much you're

331
00:14:26,310 --> 00:14:31,080
selling any sort of you know catching up

332
00:14:29,370 --> 00:14:34,260
seafood and processing it or just

333
00:14:31,080 --> 00:14:39,690
selling it you have to have a hasit plan

334
00:14:34,260 --> 00:14:42,330
you have to follow the regulations okay

335
00:14:39,690 --> 00:14:45,120
so all those regulations that I just

336
00:14:42,330 --> 00:14:47,400
talked about there as well as the

337
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:50,160
restaurant inspection and then catering

338
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:54,200
licenses those are all under the Vermont

339
00:14:50,160 --> 00:14:56,580
Vermont Department of Health then

340
00:14:54,200 --> 00:15:00,450
switching over to the Vermont Agency of

341
00:14:56,580 --> 00:15:04,500
Agriculture they regulate any dairy

342
00:15:00,450 --> 00:15:06,600
products maple especially maple syrup

343
00:15:04,500 --> 00:15:09,470
not so much other maple products that's

344
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:13,530
really under the Department of Health

345
00:15:09,470 --> 00:15:17,040
eng also regulates pet food so now for

346
00:15:13,530 --> 00:15:19,410
all those products there's no sighs

347
00:15:17,040 --> 00:15:20,190
exemption so if you're selling twenty

348
00:15:19,410 --> 00:15:24,390
dollars worth

349
00:15:20,190 --> 00:15:26,730
you have to have a Dairy Dairy

350
00:15:24,390 --> 00:15:29,790
inspection license and they have very

351
00:15:26,730 --> 00:15:33,450
specific regulations and very in

352
00:15:29,790 --> 00:15:36,690
particular it's a pretty stringent you

353
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:40,230
know you can do it you know it is

354
00:15:36,690 --> 00:15:41,580
possible to be able to you know to be

355
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:43,950
able to build a facility on your farm

356
00:15:41,580 --> 00:15:48,360
but but you know you SS stainless steel

357
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:53,040
etc so the agency of AG also regulates

358
00:15:48,360 --> 00:15:54,690
meat and with meat if you if you're

359
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:56,640
selling a product that has more than

360
00:15:54,690 --> 00:15:58,860
three percent meat or poultry by raw

361
00:15:56,640 --> 00:16:01,860
ways that will fall under the Vermont

362
00:15:58,860 --> 00:16:05,520
Agency of Agriculture so if you wanted

363
00:16:01,860 --> 00:16:09,360
to make something like a meat pie you

364
00:16:05,520 --> 00:16:10,800
know our chicken pot pie or you know

365
00:16:09,360 --> 00:16:13,350
something like that and you wanted to

366
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:17,910
sell it you know frozen or refrigerated

367
00:16:13,350 --> 00:16:19,500
or something at a grocery store that

368
00:16:17,910 --> 00:16:22,770
would fall under the agency of

369
00:16:19,500 --> 00:16:25,680
agricultural regulations and meat is

370
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,780
quite strict in their regulations you

371
00:16:25,680 --> 00:16:29,970
have to have a half-foot plan it has to

372
00:16:27,780 --> 00:16:31,740
be quite detailed again that's a hazard

373
00:16:29,970 --> 00:16:35,670
analysis and critical control points

374
00:16:31,740 --> 00:16:37,710
plan and you have to have you have daily

375
00:16:35,670 --> 00:16:43,500
inspection and you again stainless steel

376
00:16:37,710 --> 00:16:44,610
and so on so I know that some people you

377
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,770
know they feel like well they could just

378
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:49,230
you know do a little value added of

379
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:51,390
their own but it has to be done in an

380
00:16:49,230 --> 00:16:53,070
inspected facility again you can you

381
00:16:51,390 --> 00:16:55,170
know get the facility on your farm

382
00:16:53,070 --> 00:17:01,470
inspected but it has to meet the

383
00:16:55,170 --> 00:17:02,760
requirements so so if you're selling and

384
00:17:01,470 --> 00:17:04,319
I think probably many of you know about

385
00:17:02,760 --> 00:17:06,900
the poultry exemption if you're doing

386
00:17:04,319 --> 00:17:08,250
less than a thousand birds per year on

387
00:17:06,900 --> 00:17:11,490
your farm you can do it without

388
00:17:08,250 --> 00:17:13,050
inspection and again I have some fact

389
00:17:11,490 --> 00:17:16,410
sheets that talk more specifically about

390
00:17:13,050 --> 00:17:17,819
the meet regulations to get more

391
00:17:16,410 --> 00:17:21,420
information and also if you're a

392
00:17:17,819 --> 00:17:22,860
producer and you're selling meets you

393
00:17:21,420 --> 00:17:25,199
know depending on where you're selling

394
00:17:22,860 --> 00:17:28,319
you have to have different licenses to

395
00:17:25,199 --> 00:17:31,530
sell alright the agency of Agriculture

396
00:17:28,319 --> 00:17:34,049
is also responsible for all labeling in

397
00:17:31,530 --> 00:17:36,360
the state of Vermont so you

398
00:17:34,049 --> 00:17:39,989
no like your jams and jellies and so on

399
00:17:36,360 --> 00:17:43,649
they might be the safety that might be

400
00:17:39,989 --> 00:17:46,409
inspected by health the labeling of them

401
00:17:43,649 --> 00:17:51,509
is inspected by agriculture in the state

402
00:17:46,409 --> 00:17:53,909
and i see your grace's question here so

403
00:17:51,509 --> 00:17:55,379
I'll dress it while I well it's fresh in

404
00:17:53,909 --> 00:17:57,539
my head do you know how similar these

405
00:17:55,379 --> 00:17:59,700
rules and rules of the different

406
00:17:57,539 --> 00:18:02,879
departments are for New York and

407
00:17:59,700 --> 00:18:05,009
unfortunately i'm not exactly sure i do

408
00:18:02,879 --> 00:18:07,590
know that you that New York's rules are

409
00:18:05,009 --> 00:18:10,710
stricter than Vermont I don't think you

410
00:18:07,590 --> 00:18:14,489
have any exemptions I think my

411
00:18:10,710 --> 00:18:16,889
understanding is that you know if you're

412
00:18:14,489 --> 00:18:18,960
selling any amounts of food products you

413
00:18:16,889 --> 00:18:22,019
have to it has to be inspected there's

414
00:18:18,960 --> 00:18:23,879
not those dollar exemptions one

415
00:18:22,019 --> 00:18:26,129
difference to is the state of New York

416
00:18:23,879 --> 00:18:29,549
does not have a state meat inspection

417
00:18:26,129 --> 00:18:31,200
program like Vermont does so all of your

418
00:18:29,549 --> 00:18:36,659
meat inspection would be under it would

419
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:39,330
be a USDA inspector which the the

420
00:18:36,659 --> 00:18:41,399
requirements really are the same but the

421
00:18:39,330 --> 00:18:44,759
thing is your inspector is a USDA

422
00:18:41,399 --> 00:18:47,159
inspector rather than vacation Vermont

423
00:18:44,759 --> 00:18:51,899
friendly Vermont guys that are that are

424
00:18:47,159 --> 00:18:54,509
inspecting your meat product so son

425
00:18:51,899 --> 00:18:58,379
Jesse just put a link that has all those

426
00:18:54,509 --> 00:19:01,799
fact sheets I was referring to so yeah

427
00:18:58,379 --> 00:19:04,619
and I don't know exactly the breakdown

428
00:19:01,799 --> 00:19:08,220
between health and AG in New York I'm

429
00:19:04,619 --> 00:19:09,779
afraid but but I can find out guys my

430
00:19:08,220 --> 00:19:12,509
email will be at the end racy and if you

431
00:19:09,779 --> 00:19:15,960
want to send me an email to remind me to

432
00:19:12,509 --> 00:19:23,249
look I can I can look for you I can find

433
00:19:15,960 --> 00:19:25,950
out ok so in the state of Vermont again

434
00:19:23,249 --> 00:19:27,899
if you're wanting to apply for these

435
00:19:25,950 --> 00:19:31,109
different state licenses that I talked

436
00:19:27,899 --> 00:19:34,200
about rather than giving you all the

437
00:19:31,109 --> 00:19:38,100
links in this webinar I just decided to

438
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:41,999
to refer you to this fact sheet that I

439
00:19:38,100 --> 00:19:45,450
that I have on I'm 50g requirements for

440
00:19:41,999 --> 00:19:47,190
Vermont food processors and in that fact

441
00:19:45,450 --> 00:19:49,290
sheet there's you know

442
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:51,600
specific information on exactly what's

443
00:19:49,290 --> 00:19:52,950
needed depending on what you're selling

444
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:55,260
and then there's information on how to

445
00:19:52,950 --> 00:19:57,900
get the licenses from the health

446
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:01,770
department and from the agency of

447
00:19:57,900 --> 00:20:05,880
Agriculture so that links that Jesse put

448
00:20:01,770 --> 00:20:09,060
up earlier that you can click on that or

449
00:20:05,880 --> 00:20:11,550
this is a shorter a little bit prettier

450
00:20:09,060 --> 00:20:14,160
URL listed here and then you just click

451
00:20:11,550 --> 00:20:15,570
on food safety for producers and

452
00:20:14,160 --> 00:20:18,330
processors and then it's under

453
00:20:15,570 --> 00:20:20,340
publications and then you could find

454
00:20:18,330 --> 00:20:26,250
this back sheet and the other fact

455
00:20:20,340 --> 00:20:28,050
sheets that I've been referring to ok so

456
00:20:26,250 --> 00:20:30,540
now I'm going to go jump to the federal

457
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:34,010
level and so this would apply to to

458
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:40,700
everybody in all states across the u.s.

459
00:20:34,010 --> 00:20:43,440
so so as I kind of indicated before USDA

460
00:20:40,700 --> 00:20:46,230
inspection USDA would inspect meat and

461
00:20:43,440 --> 00:20:48,780
poultry products so again it's the same

462
00:20:46,230 --> 00:20:51,210
requirement as for Vermont the

463
00:20:48,780 --> 00:20:53,310
three-percent meter poultry by rahway

464
00:20:51,210 --> 00:20:56,610
anything greater than that is under USDA

465
00:20:53,310 --> 00:21:00,030
inspection you're required to have a

466
00:20:56,610 --> 00:21:02,640
half a plan and again there's no sighs

467
00:21:00,030 --> 00:21:04,710
exemptions and just to mention too that

468
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:07,230
the Vermont meat inspection it's

469
00:21:04,710 --> 00:21:10,770
considered equal to USDA inspection but

470
00:21:07,230 --> 00:21:13,080
like I said the big difference is in my

471
00:21:10,770 --> 00:21:16,770
mind the state inspection that the

472
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:18,630
inspectors are you know are a little bit

473
00:21:16,770 --> 00:21:20,730
more a little bit more of an

474
00:21:18,630 --> 00:21:22,500
education-focused rather than just a

475
00:21:20,730 --> 00:21:24,720
regulatory focus where the USDA

476
00:21:22,500 --> 00:21:28,830
inspectors are really having more of a

477
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:30,890
regulatory focus so and i'll get to

478
00:21:28,830 --> 00:21:34,110
Michelle's question after i finish i'll

479
00:21:30,890 --> 00:21:36,860
talk about the nutrition facts and we'll

480
00:21:34,110 --> 00:21:39,750
get to your question um so for meat

481
00:21:36,860 --> 00:21:43,350
there's a well relegates is a year old

482
00:21:39,750 --> 00:21:47,100
now but a regular requirement now for

483
00:21:43,350 --> 00:21:50,430
nutrition facts labeling on unmeet

484
00:21:47,100 --> 00:21:51,870
products whole muscle Cutsem and

485
00:21:50,430 --> 00:21:55,080
products with more than two ingredients

486
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:58,560
so again I have more information about

487
00:21:55,080 --> 00:22:00,140
that in the late labeling fact sheet if

488
00:21:58,560 --> 00:22:01,640
you're interested

489
00:22:00,140 --> 00:22:03,830
so if you're planning to use the

490
00:22:01,640 --> 00:22:08,360
Hardwick food hub hub sorry would you

491
00:22:03,830 --> 00:22:09,860
need a license of your own the Hardwick

492
00:22:08,360 --> 00:22:12,620
food hub a tent I don't know what kind

493
00:22:09,860 --> 00:22:16,520
of product you're interested in they do

494
00:22:12,620 --> 00:22:18,260
not you cannot do meet there but you can

495
00:22:16,520 --> 00:22:21,680
do all the other products that I've

496
00:22:18,260 --> 00:22:23,720
talked about well it they well centrally

497
00:22:21,680 --> 00:22:25,520
to cheese there either necessarily but

498
00:22:23,720 --> 00:22:28,220
but you can do you know salts and all

499
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:31,430
those sort of things you still have to

500
00:22:28,220 --> 00:22:33,910
get a food product if you're doing you

501
00:22:31,430 --> 00:22:36,980
know like jams or jellies or sauces

502
00:22:33,910 --> 00:22:41,090
salsa etc you still have to have your

503
00:22:36,980 --> 00:22:43,550
own food processors license because the

504
00:22:41,090 --> 00:22:47,510
processors license is tied to you not

505
00:22:43,550 --> 00:22:50,630
the facility however it's very easy to

506
00:22:47,510 --> 00:22:52,550
get the license if you're using a

507
00:22:50,630 --> 00:22:56,180
facility like the one in hardwick

508
00:22:52,550 --> 00:22:57,860
because they're already you know the

509
00:22:56,180 --> 00:23:00,140
facility is already passed inspection

510
00:22:57,860 --> 00:23:01,430
and they know you know they know the

511
00:23:00,140 --> 00:23:04,010
facility the inspector knows the

512
00:23:01,430 --> 00:23:06,650
facility very well there they also have

513
00:23:04,010 --> 00:23:10,430
FDA inspectors come through so you know

514
00:23:06,650 --> 00:23:14,960
even if you're doing FDA that would be

515
00:23:10,430 --> 00:23:16,730
fine so so yeah especially if you're

516
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:20,300
doing the in-state license you still

517
00:23:16,730 --> 00:23:22,430
need to have your own license okay great

518
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:24,140
yep sauce barbecue sauce and ketchup yep

519
00:23:22,430 --> 00:23:27,440
exactly so those sort of products would

520
00:23:24,140 --> 00:23:30,050
all be would all be under the food

521
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:31,940
processors license and and again you

522
00:23:30,050 --> 00:23:33,830
know it's really just almost a matter of

523
00:23:31,940 --> 00:23:35,650
just sending in your money and it's like

524
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:40,730
hundred and something dollars per year

525
00:23:35,650 --> 00:23:43,490
for the license and those products

526
00:23:40,730 --> 00:23:45,650
probably would not require a scheduled

527
00:23:43,490 --> 00:23:47,480
process depending on what kind of sauce

528
00:23:45,650 --> 00:23:49,370
you're doing but the barbecue sauce and

529
00:23:47,480 --> 00:23:59,240
ketchup would not require a scheduled

530
00:23:49,370 --> 00:24:01,490
process okay so FDA regulations again

531
00:23:59,240 --> 00:24:04,190
like I mentioned before there's no sighs

532
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:05,960
exemption so if you're selling you know

533
00:24:04,190 --> 00:24:09,380
ten dollars worth of products across

534
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:11,330
state lines you have to have it you have

535
00:24:09,380 --> 00:24:13,149
had you have to be registered with the

536
00:24:11,330 --> 00:24:14,830
FDA and I'll talk about that in a minute

537
00:24:13,149 --> 00:24:20,200
but you have to follow the after your

538
00:24:14,830 --> 00:24:21,339
requirement so FDA really they do you

539
00:24:20,200 --> 00:24:23,139
know processed foods and baked goods

540
00:24:21,339 --> 00:24:25,779
like like I talked about earlier with

541
00:24:23,139 --> 00:24:28,629
the Department of Health in Vermont FCA

542
00:24:25,779 --> 00:24:30,099
also does dairy products maple syrup pet

543
00:24:28,629 --> 00:24:32,139
food those are all things that are

544
00:24:30,099 --> 00:24:38,259
regulated by the agency of Agriculture

545
00:24:32,139 --> 00:24:40,899
here in Vermont but in in SGA they're

546
00:24:38,259 --> 00:24:43,450
regulated by them sorry it's a federal

547
00:24:40,899 --> 00:24:45,070
level of regulated by FDA I don't know

548
00:24:43,450 --> 00:24:47,379
if anybody from New Hampshire is on but

549
00:24:45,070 --> 00:24:48,999
i know that in New Hampshire dairy

550
00:24:47,379 --> 00:24:52,269
products are regulated by the state

551
00:24:48,999 --> 00:24:55,539
health department there and I'm not sure

552
00:24:52,269 --> 00:24:57,729
about New York off top of my head FDA

553
00:24:55,539 --> 00:24:59,349
also regulates seafood and fruit juice

554
00:24:57,729 --> 00:25:05,739
and again they require you to have a

555
00:24:59,349 --> 00:25:07,779
hash of plan alright so so they

556
00:25:05,739 --> 00:25:11,799
mentioned if you're selling products out

557
00:25:07,779 --> 00:25:15,309
of state then you have to you have to be

558
00:25:11,799 --> 00:25:17,379
registered with the FDA and so the steps

559
00:25:15,309 --> 00:25:19,830
for that our first you have to get your

560
00:25:17,379 --> 00:25:23,080
licensing from the state of from the

561
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:24,820
appropriate Vermont Agency so even if

562
00:25:23,080 --> 00:25:26,619
you're selling less than ten thousand

563
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:28,539
dollars worth of product in the state of

564
00:25:26,619 --> 00:25:31,659
Vermont and you're exempt from the state

565
00:25:28,539 --> 00:25:35,589
requirements if you're selling out of

566
00:25:31,659 --> 00:25:37,029
state then you still have to get the

567
00:25:35,589 --> 00:25:39,549
proper licensing from the state of

568
00:25:37,029 --> 00:25:41,499
Vermont because that's the requirement

569
00:25:39,549 --> 00:25:45,639
for FDA's to have the proper state

570
00:25:41,499 --> 00:25:48,609
licensing first so with FDA well with

571
00:25:45,639 --> 00:25:51,969
state of Vermont I kind of alluded to it

572
00:25:48,609 --> 00:25:54,729
it's you know you have to pay a register

573
00:25:51,969 --> 00:25:56,619
a licensing fee like 115 dollars or

574
00:25:54,729 --> 00:26:00,429
something you have to you know send them

575
00:25:56,619 --> 00:26:02,169
your money yearly with FDA it's free at

576
00:26:00,429 --> 00:26:04,049
this point they're talking about having

577
00:26:02,169 --> 00:26:09,159
user fees but at this point it's free

578
00:26:04,049 --> 00:26:10,899
you just register online I didn't share

579
00:26:09,159 --> 00:26:13,059
the link right now but I have it in that

580
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:16,629
fact sheets of food regulations actually

581
00:26:13,059 --> 00:26:18,549
that I mentioned earlier you you're

582
00:26:16,629 --> 00:26:21,159
required to reregister your facility

583
00:26:18,549 --> 00:26:24,299
every two years it's in the fall of the

584
00:26:21,159 --> 00:26:26,590
even-numbered years so 2014 in the fall

585
00:26:24,299 --> 00:26:28,659
you should reregister the

586
00:26:26,590 --> 00:26:31,299
just want to keep track of everyone keep

587
00:26:28,659 --> 00:26:32,860
their list current the FDA might come

588
00:26:31,299 --> 00:26:36,640
and inspect your facility once you

589
00:26:32,860 --> 00:26:40,390
register with them on average I've heard

590
00:26:36,640 --> 00:26:42,400
at national average FDA inspects your

591
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,679
facility once every approximately seven

592
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,539
years because there's so many food

593
00:26:44,679 --> 00:26:49,419
processing facilities across the u.s. of

594
00:26:46,539 --> 00:26:51,460
FDA's meant to inspect they just can't

595
00:26:49,419 --> 00:26:53,980
get to everybody if you're considered a

596
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:56,080
higher risk facility like if you're

597
00:26:53,980 --> 00:26:59,020
doing cheese or something they'll come a

598
00:26:56,080 --> 00:27:01,450
lot more often than once every seven

599
00:26:59,020 --> 00:27:04,720
years but you know no guarantees all

600
00:27:01,450 --> 00:27:07,570
often will come so the FDA requirements

601
00:27:04,720 --> 00:27:11,260
are you have to meet what's called the

602
00:27:07,570 --> 00:27:12,880
Good Manufacturing Practices and I'll

603
00:27:11,260 --> 00:27:14,890
tuck that's what I'm going to be talking

604
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,539
about in the next section are basically

605
00:27:14,890 --> 00:27:20,230
good manufacturing practices kind of

606
00:27:16,539 --> 00:27:21,760
best practices and you can find those

607
00:27:20,230 --> 00:27:24,610
good manufacturing practices they're

608
00:27:21,760 --> 00:27:29,279
available in the Code of Federal

609
00:27:24,610 --> 00:27:32,110
Regulations title 21 part 110 and i

610
00:27:29,279 --> 00:27:33,880
found FCA's URLs are really usually

611
00:27:32,110 --> 00:27:35,950
really long so usually the best way to

612
00:27:33,880 --> 00:27:38,649
find them rather than me giving you a

613
00:27:35,950 --> 00:27:46,210
long URL is to just just google that and

614
00:27:38,649 --> 00:27:50,559
you'll be able to find them there we go

615
00:27:46,210 --> 00:27:55,779
okay so here's as I mentioned earlier

616
00:27:50,559 --> 00:27:57,610
FDA has some proposed rules on what's

617
00:27:55,779 --> 00:28:01,390
called the Food Safety Modernization Act

618
00:27:57,610 --> 00:28:04,779
and there's a proposal on produce safety

619
00:28:01,390 --> 00:28:06,460
as well as a proposed rule on what's

620
00:28:04,779 --> 00:28:08,380
called preventative controls and

621
00:28:06,460 --> 00:28:11,799
preventive controls is basically for

622
00:28:08,380 --> 00:28:14,919
food processors these proposed rules

623
00:28:11,799 --> 00:28:16,720
they're still in the comment period it

624
00:28:14,919 --> 00:28:18,610
looks like the comment periods going to

625
00:28:16,720 --> 00:28:20,470
be extended until like September which

626
00:28:18,610 --> 00:28:24,100
is good to give us more time to look

627
00:28:20,470 --> 00:28:27,549
through them and make some comments and

628
00:28:24,100 --> 00:28:30,010
it'll be a few years before processors

629
00:28:27,549 --> 00:28:31,659
would need to implement them however

630
00:28:30,010 --> 00:28:33,429
I'll talk about the next slide it's a

631
00:28:31,659 --> 00:28:37,419
good idea start thinking about it now

632
00:28:33,429 --> 00:28:40,030
and to start moving towards moving

633
00:28:37,419 --> 00:28:40,480
towards it whether you're going to be

634
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:43,179
exempt

635
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:45,990
not because we don't know what the final

636
00:28:43,179 --> 00:28:49,840
rules are going to say in any case so

637
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:51,220
and you know anyway I have it the next

638
00:28:49,840 --> 00:28:55,480
slide so i'll save it till the next

639
00:28:51,220 --> 00:28:58,299
slide oh and the other thing i wanted to

640
00:28:55,480 --> 00:29:01,240
mention to while i'm talking about it as

641
00:28:58,299 --> 00:29:02,530
i mentioned at the beginning I wanted to

642
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:03,490
kind of highlight the differences a

643
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:07,270
little bit the differences between

644
00:29:03,490 --> 00:29:09,910
produce safety and processing safety

645
00:29:07,270 --> 00:29:12,730
with produce it's currently if you're

646
00:29:09,910 --> 00:29:15,880
selling produce in the state of Vermont

647
00:29:12,730 --> 00:29:17,500
there's absolutely no regulations for

648
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:18,970
you know the safety and produce that

649
00:29:17,500 --> 00:29:22,750
you're selling your so if you're selling

650
00:29:18,970 --> 00:29:24,850
you know your fresh tomatoes and carrots

651
00:29:22,750 --> 00:29:27,490
and whatever at the farmers market fresh

652
00:29:24,850 --> 00:29:30,280
whole you know tomatoes and carrots and

653
00:29:27,490 --> 00:29:32,020
peppers and all those things the only

654
00:29:30,280 --> 00:29:33,850
regulatory requirement is that the

655
00:29:32,020 --> 00:29:37,390
product has not been exposed to flood

656
00:29:33,850 --> 00:29:42,760
waters so so you know for produce

657
00:29:37,390 --> 00:29:45,580
growers these proposed FDA rules are a

658
00:29:42,760 --> 00:29:48,460
big game changer because you know they

659
00:29:45,580 --> 00:29:50,440
haven't had regulations before people

660
00:29:48,460 --> 00:29:53,890
doing value-added products you know

661
00:29:50,440 --> 00:29:55,480
they're more used to regulations and you

662
00:29:53,890 --> 00:29:57,419
know people are kind of aware that they

663
00:29:55,480 --> 00:29:59,320
need to operate under regulations but

664
00:29:57,419 --> 00:30:01,059
it's only that's a big difference

665
00:29:59,320 --> 00:30:03,990
between you know if you're just selling

666
00:30:01,059 --> 00:30:06,070
threshold produce versus selling

667
00:30:03,990 --> 00:30:10,540
value-added products then there's a lot

668
00:30:06,070 --> 00:30:14,850
more regulatory control so so on the

669
00:30:10,540 --> 00:30:17,590
preventive controls proposed rules for

670
00:30:14,850 --> 00:30:18,940
FDA the Food Safety Modernization Act

671
00:30:17,590 --> 00:30:21,730
you can see there's a number of

672
00:30:18,940 --> 00:30:25,120
exemptions and I apologize that it's

673
00:30:21,730 --> 00:30:26,740
small font but it's just to kind of to

674
00:30:25,120 --> 00:30:30,250
show that there's a lot of exemptions

675
00:30:26,740 --> 00:30:33,130
but they're a little bit confusing and

676
00:30:30,250 --> 00:30:36,520
so again I have a fact sheet that that

677
00:30:33,130 --> 00:30:38,350
lists these in more detail and again

678
00:30:36,520 --> 00:30:40,630
everyone different people kind of

679
00:30:38,350 --> 00:30:42,130
interpret these proposed rules a little

680
00:30:40,630 --> 00:30:43,630
bit differently and the thing is we

681
00:30:42,130 --> 00:30:47,169
don't know exactly what's going to come

682
00:30:43,630 --> 00:30:48,580
out in the final rules anyway but but at

683
00:30:47,169 --> 00:30:51,390
this point it looks like small

684
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:53,330
processors would be exempt from

685
00:30:51,390 --> 00:30:58,670
following the FDA

686
00:30:53,330 --> 00:30:59,720
a revised requirements but but you'd

687
00:30:58,670 --> 00:31:03,320
still have to follow the state

688
00:30:59,720 --> 00:31:05,630
regulations one thing that's kind of

689
00:31:03,320 --> 00:31:08,210
interesting is food hubs and people that

690
00:31:05,630 --> 00:31:12,350
are better commingling produce from

691
00:31:08,210 --> 00:31:14,300
multiple multiple growers they would

692
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:16,010
they would fall under the preventive

693
00:31:14,300 --> 00:31:18,560
controls requirements if there's if

694
00:31:16,010 --> 00:31:20,360
they're storing they're having

695
00:31:18,560 --> 00:31:22,790
warehousing of the products you can see

696
00:31:20,360 --> 00:31:24,790
that one's listed at the bottom there so

697
00:31:22,790 --> 00:31:27,980
that's something important for food hubs

698
00:31:24,790 --> 00:31:29,330
and anybody doing kind of you know

699
00:31:27,980 --> 00:31:36,710
commingling of products from different

700
00:31:29,330 --> 00:31:40,970
farms to keep in mind so if you are

701
00:31:36,710 --> 00:31:44,090
going to be covered by the preventive

702
00:31:40,970 --> 00:31:47,750
controls rules if you're not exempt from

703
00:31:44,090 --> 00:31:50,630
them is what would you need you would

704
00:31:47,750 --> 00:31:53,570
need to have a written food safety plan

705
00:31:50,630 --> 00:31:55,040
which is similar to a half the plan I

706
00:31:53,570 --> 00:31:56,480
touch I checked by half with a little

707
00:31:55,040 --> 00:31:59,540
bit of hazard analysis and critical

708
00:31:56,480 --> 00:32:02,870
control points so this preventive

709
00:31:59,540 --> 00:32:04,790
controls plan would require you to do

710
00:32:02,870 --> 00:32:11,060
monitoring and have records and

711
00:32:04,790 --> 00:32:16,120
corrective actions for ya ok so this

712
00:32:11,060 --> 00:32:18,830
preventive controls would require you to

713
00:32:16,120 --> 00:32:21,860
monitor and have records and then

714
00:32:18,830 --> 00:32:24,350
corrective action plans for your food

715
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:28,100
allergen controls and also for your

716
00:32:24,350 --> 00:32:30,320
sanitation of your of your plants our of

717
00:32:28,100 --> 00:32:36,320
your facility and then we clear recall

718
00:32:30,320 --> 00:32:39,290
plans in hasit plans you have to go

719
00:32:36,320 --> 00:32:41,060
through and identify where the biggest

720
00:32:39,290 --> 00:32:43,070
hazards are and where you're most

721
00:32:41,060 --> 00:32:45,350
critical control points are in your

722
00:32:43,070 --> 00:32:48,890
process usually those are like in a

723
00:32:45,350 --> 00:32:50,690
cooking step or a chilling step and then

724
00:32:48,890 --> 00:32:52,700
you have to keep track you have to do

725
00:32:50,690 --> 00:32:55,910
monitoring you know of the temperature

726
00:32:52,700 --> 00:32:59,000
of the time you know and keep records of

727
00:32:55,910 --> 00:33:02,840
that so that's in a typical hasit plan

728
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:05,570
but this preventive controls plan you

729
00:33:02,840 --> 00:33:07,160
would have to have that as well as doing

730
00:33:05,570 --> 00:33:10,490
monitoring and record

731
00:33:07,160 --> 00:33:12,500
and so on for four items that are

732
00:33:10,490 --> 00:33:15,170
typically in half the plans are

733
00:33:12,500 --> 00:33:19,700
considered prerequisite programs so

734
00:33:15,170 --> 00:33:23,750
those those food allergen controls and

735
00:33:19,700 --> 00:33:26,900
sanitation so on so so preventive

736
00:33:23,750 --> 00:33:28,460
controls are kind of language the FDA

737
00:33:26,900 --> 00:33:32,390
uses used in the Food Safety

738
00:33:28,460 --> 00:33:37,430
Modernization Act to talk about you know

739
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:42,100
that the places where you can best

740
00:33:37,430 --> 00:33:46,990
prevent foodborne foodborne illness from

741
00:33:42,100 --> 00:33:51,020
potentially resulting from your process

742
00:33:46,990 --> 00:33:53,720
so it's super magic controls could be

743
00:33:51,020 --> 00:33:56,600
cooking could be chillin it could also

744
00:33:53,720 --> 00:34:01,750
be no sanitation plans that sort of

745
00:33:56,600 --> 00:34:04,750
thing so the other thing with the

746
00:34:01,750 --> 00:34:06,740
preventive controls rule is is that

747
00:34:04,750 --> 00:34:09,290
they're updating the Good Manufacturing

748
00:34:06,740 --> 00:34:10,790
Practices and I talked about those

749
00:34:09,290 --> 00:34:14,360
earlier and we'll talk about them in a

750
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:18,080
minute the language will be updated a

751
00:34:14,360 --> 00:34:20,750
little bit too but but it's not a major

752
00:34:18,080 --> 00:34:22,190
update really but so those good

753
00:34:20,750 --> 00:34:23,480
manufacturing practices and again that's

754
00:34:22,190 --> 00:34:27,470
we'll talk about next are really

755
00:34:23,480 --> 00:34:30,530
important whether you're covered by the

756
00:34:27,470 --> 00:34:31,850
new requirements or not so and again if

757
00:34:30,530 --> 00:34:33,800
you're not going to be covered you know

758
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:35,419
if you are going to be exempt from if

759
00:34:33,800 --> 00:34:37,790
you're small enough producer if you're

760
00:34:35,419 --> 00:34:40,160
if you're selling lower risk products

761
00:34:37,790 --> 00:34:41,840
and you'd be exempt you know why why is

762
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:44,810
this important why do I keep talking

763
00:34:41,840 --> 00:34:47,900
about it well here in Vermont the state

764
00:34:44,810 --> 00:34:51,260
is talking about updating its

765
00:34:47,900 --> 00:34:53,060
regulations and right now as I mentioned

766
00:34:51,260 --> 00:34:56,540
the state of Vermont food processing

767
00:34:53,060 --> 00:35:01,400
regulations are relatively loose

768
00:34:56,540 --> 00:35:03,080
compared to other states so so they

769
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:05,660
really want to so they're talking about

770
00:35:03,080 --> 00:35:08,750
updating those to have Heather be

771
00:35:05,660 --> 00:35:11,270
stricter to kind of match the FDA's

772
00:35:08,750 --> 00:35:13,160
requirements and you know whenever

773
00:35:11,270 --> 00:35:17,270
there's a new regulation that comes into

774
00:35:13,160 --> 00:35:20,810
place buyers very often also increase

775
00:35:17,270 --> 00:35:20,960
their requirements so so the bar is kind

776
00:35:20,810 --> 00:35:23,839
of

777
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:26,240
raised for everybody and then buyers

778
00:35:23,839 --> 00:35:28,640
might also quite have stricter

779
00:35:26,240 --> 00:35:32,540
requirements so so it's something again

780
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:34,339
to keep your eye on okay so if you're

781
00:35:32,540 --> 00:35:38,869
exempt to the federal level how does

782
00:35:34,339 --> 00:35:43,940
that differ from the state GMP so if you

783
00:35:38,869 --> 00:35:46,160
are exempt from the Federal Food Safety

784
00:35:43,940 --> 00:35:49,000
Modernization that specific

785
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:51,380
Modernization Act requirements then

786
00:35:49,000 --> 00:35:55,990
basically you just have to follow the

787
00:35:51,380 --> 00:35:59,990
state your state food safety regulations

788
00:35:55,990 --> 00:36:02,660
and then in addition you have to make

789
00:35:59,990 --> 00:36:06,530
sure that the name of the facility where

790
00:36:02,660 --> 00:36:08,330
you process the product is on the label

791
00:36:06,530 --> 00:36:10,250
which which is already really

792
00:36:08,330 --> 00:36:12,170
essentially a requirement of labeling

793
00:36:10,250 --> 00:36:15,890
and then you're supposed to notify the

794
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:17,990
FDA you know that you're that you're

795
00:36:15,890 --> 00:36:21,710
operating under that small business

796
00:36:17,990 --> 00:36:23,810
exemption but again we don't know

797
00:36:21,710 --> 00:36:25,640
exactly how the final rules are going to

798
00:36:23,810 --> 00:36:27,740
they're going to shake out so that's

799
00:36:25,640 --> 00:36:29,780
that's what we that's what our

800
00:36:27,740 --> 00:36:33,200
interpretation my interpretation is of

801
00:36:29,780 --> 00:36:36,410
the proposed rules at this point does

802
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:37,580
that answer your question Tony or if if

803
00:36:36,410 --> 00:36:40,970
you're looking for something else just

804
00:36:37,580 --> 00:36:49,940
just maybe you can ask another question

805
00:36:40,970 --> 00:36:52,970
too and I can clarify okay I'll I'll

806
00:36:49,940 --> 00:36:54,440
keep going here is it Tony if you have

807
00:36:52,970 --> 00:36:58,430
another question feel free to let me

808
00:36:54,440 --> 00:37:02,450
know so some other steps to starting it

809
00:36:58,430 --> 00:37:04,190
again and these might be a little bit

810
00:37:02,450 --> 00:37:06,619
different in your state but generally

811
00:37:04,190 --> 00:37:08,390
speaking these these are the steps I'm

812
00:37:06,619 --> 00:37:12,230
sure in every state but this for sure in

813
00:37:08,390 --> 00:37:13,250
Vermont you need to do these things so

814
00:37:12,230 --> 00:37:15,790
you need to make sure that you check

815
00:37:13,250 --> 00:37:18,290
with your town or city clerk for any

816
00:37:15,790 --> 00:37:20,180
local zoning restrictions and any

817
00:37:18,290 --> 00:37:21,560
licensing permitting that they might

818
00:37:20,180 --> 00:37:25,940
have so just to make sure that you're

819
00:37:21,560 --> 00:37:28,520
following their requirements it's

820
00:37:25,940 --> 00:37:29,810
important to get a state food processors

821
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:32,450
license here in the state of Vermont

822
00:37:29,810 --> 00:37:34,190
they require that you first talked to

823
00:37:32,450 --> 00:37:34,820
the Department of device sorry the

824
00:37:34,190 --> 00:37:37,820
Department

825
00:37:34,820 --> 00:37:39,830
environmental conservation to check on

826
00:37:37,820 --> 00:37:43,400
the wastewater facility or the

827
00:37:39,830 --> 00:37:46,430
wastewater plan they don't necessarily

828
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,350
require that you have a new you don't

829
00:37:46,430 --> 00:37:50,780
have to necessarily put in a new septic

830
00:37:48,350 --> 00:37:52,310
system they might say you know you're

831
00:37:50,780 --> 00:37:55,130
set with your current septic system is

832
00:37:52,310 --> 00:37:56,210
fine but you do have to check with the

833
00:37:55,130 --> 00:37:59,500
Department of Environmental Conservation

834
00:37:56,210 --> 00:38:03,500
so that's something that's important

835
00:37:59,500 --> 00:38:05,210
they do also require that you check with

836
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:07,340
the Department of Public Safety to make

837
00:38:05,210 --> 00:38:10,510
sure that you're following the

838
00:38:07,340 --> 00:38:13,220
electrical and fire and plumbing codes

839
00:38:10,510 --> 00:38:14,840
so in order to get your state food

840
00:38:13,220 --> 00:38:17,030
processors license you have to be in

841
00:38:14,840 --> 00:38:19,970
compliance with the Dec and the

842
00:38:17,030 --> 00:38:21,200
Department of Public Safety you also

843
00:38:19,970 --> 00:38:25,130
need to check with the tax division

844
00:38:21,200 --> 00:38:26,300
unfortunately I didn't say that but you

845
00:38:25,130 --> 00:38:27,800
have to check out the tax division to

846
00:38:26,300 --> 00:38:29,660
make sure you're doing your tax

847
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:31,760
requirements properly and then you

848
00:38:29,660 --> 00:38:33,050
probably want to protect the name of

849
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:35,180
your business so you might want to

850
00:38:33,050 --> 00:38:37,910
register it with a secretary of state to

851
00:38:35,180 --> 00:38:40,820
protect your your awesome name that you

852
00:38:37,910 --> 00:38:45,230
have for your business and this lake

853
00:38:40,820 --> 00:38:48,610
down here has more has the lakes to all

854
00:38:45,230 --> 00:38:50,450
these different websites that's the

855
00:38:48,610 --> 00:38:55,580
department of health food and lodging

856
00:38:50,450 --> 00:38:56,750
program website down there alright so

857
00:38:55,580 --> 00:39:00,140
I've been talking about these best

858
00:38:56,750 --> 00:39:04,670
practices and so now I'm going to kind

859
00:39:00,140 --> 00:39:06,890
of going to finish up with this so again

860
00:39:04,670 --> 00:39:09,610
these best practices are I mean

861
00:39:06,890 --> 00:39:13,400
generally speaking this is what the

862
00:39:09,610 --> 00:39:16,700
state of Vermont's food safety

863
00:39:13,400 --> 00:39:21,220
requirements are for food processors and

864
00:39:16,700 --> 00:39:24,620
also I guess I haven't listed down here

865
00:39:21,220 --> 00:39:27,290
also this is generally speaking the

866
00:39:24,620 --> 00:39:29,240
FDA's requirements so I'm going to talk

867
00:39:27,290 --> 00:39:32,150
about these best practices kind of in

868
00:39:29,240 --> 00:39:34,880
general terms but again if you look up

869
00:39:32,150 --> 00:39:36,470
you know the FDA's good manufacturing

870
00:39:34,880 --> 00:39:40,460
practices you can get the more specific

871
00:39:36,470 --> 00:39:42,410
details and the state of Vermont to you

872
00:39:40,460 --> 00:39:45,230
can find the specific regulations that

873
00:39:42,410 --> 00:39:47,480
are required so these Good Manufacturing

874
00:39:45,230 --> 00:39:48,270
Practices that's that's the terminology

875
00:39:47,480 --> 00:39:52,470
that

876
00:39:48,270 --> 00:39:54,480
da uses in in the regulations and

877
00:39:52,470 --> 00:39:56,700
they're just they're the basic sanitary

878
00:39:54,480 --> 00:39:57,900
and processing requirements that are

879
00:39:56,700 --> 00:40:00,780
needed to just make sure that you're

880
00:39:57,900 --> 00:40:02,700
processing safe foods so they're to me

881
00:40:00,780 --> 00:40:04,410
they're just they're just best practices

882
00:40:02,700 --> 00:40:07,080
you know they're a good idea for

883
00:40:04,410 --> 00:40:08,700
everyone to follow whether you're exempt

884
00:40:07,080 --> 00:40:11,910
it or not whether you're required to

885
00:40:08,700 --> 00:40:14,040
meet regulations or not being on and

886
00:40:11,910 --> 00:40:16,230
this is yeah like it says here this is

887
00:40:14,040 --> 00:40:18,980
what's needed to to meet the current and

888
00:40:16,230 --> 00:40:23,580
the future state and federal regulations

889
00:40:18,980 --> 00:40:25,860
and this is both for USDA and FDA so if

890
00:40:23,580 --> 00:40:29,190
you're doing anything under if you're

891
00:40:25,860 --> 00:40:30,300
doing the meat processing the USDA also

892
00:40:29,190 --> 00:40:33,960
requires that you follow good

893
00:40:30,300 --> 00:40:36,690
manufacturing practices so again I've

894
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:39,090
been mentioning half the plans if you

895
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:41,100
are required to have a hasit plan that

896
00:40:39,090 --> 00:40:43,140
has the plan requires that you have

897
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:47,420
these good manufacturing practices in

898
00:40:43,140 --> 00:40:51,660
place so so they're really important

899
00:40:47,420 --> 00:40:54,450
again I have a fact sheets that kind of

900
00:40:51,660 --> 00:40:56,160
you know gives a nice or give a two-page

901
00:40:54,450 --> 00:41:00,030
overview of good manufacturing practices

902
00:40:56,160 --> 00:41:03,390
it might be helpful for you okay so to

903
00:41:00,030 --> 00:41:05,040
start out with and in it and I just want

904
00:41:03,390 --> 00:41:07,020
to emphasize to that a lot of these

905
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:09,600
things are probably common sense and in

906
00:41:07,020 --> 00:41:11,910
again if you're kind of going from being

907
00:41:09,600 --> 00:41:15,240
a you know produce grower or some sort

908
00:41:11,910 --> 00:41:17,490
of a producer on the farm to doing food

909
00:41:15,240 --> 00:41:19,440
processing a value-added processing a

910
00:41:17,490 --> 00:41:22,050
lot of these things are kind of common

911
00:41:19,440 --> 00:41:24,000
sense but and some of these things might

912
00:41:22,050 --> 00:41:25,380
be things you're already doing but but

913
00:41:24,000 --> 00:41:26,970
some might be a little bit different

914
00:41:25,380 --> 00:41:31,320
there might be some new things to think

915
00:41:26,970 --> 00:41:33,900
about with food processing so so again

916
00:41:31,320 --> 00:41:35,640
I'll just talk about them so for

917
00:41:33,900 --> 00:41:38,190
buildings and facilities when you're

918
00:41:35,640 --> 00:41:39,390
doing food processing and value-added

919
00:41:38,190 --> 00:41:41,250
processing you just want to make sure

920
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:43,200
that the grounds are free of weeds you

921
00:41:41,250 --> 00:41:44,790
have the drainage you know the

922
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:47,990
facilities you have to have cleanable

923
00:41:44,790 --> 00:41:51,240
surfaces good ventilation and lighting

924
00:41:47,990 --> 00:41:53,580
you know the FDA these regulations they

925
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:55,380
don't really specify you know the

926
00:41:53,580 --> 00:41:57,800
specific surface is that you need to

927
00:41:55,380 --> 00:42:01,319
have just that they need to be cleanable

928
00:41:57,800 --> 00:42:04,709
so that kind of makes it more general

929
00:42:01,319 --> 00:42:08,339
again hand-washing facilities needed

930
00:42:04,709 --> 00:42:10,949
water just kind of fold basic things I

931
00:42:08,339 --> 00:42:13,920
guess your equipment and utensils you

932
00:42:10,949 --> 00:42:15,420
have to make sure that you're using but

933
00:42:13,920 --> 00:42:18,449
they're that they're of a sanitary

934
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:20,579
design again cleanable materials is

935
00:42:18,449 --> 00:42:24,269
important you know make sure that its

936
00:42:20,579 --> 00:42:27,749
food grade materials would grade

937
00:42:24,269 --> 00:42:29,549
equipment that you're using and and then

938
00:42:27,749 --> 00:42:31,049
the set the equipment is you know

939
00:42:29,549 --> 00:42:34,859
installed and maintained that you can

940
00:42:31,049 --> 00:42:36,390
easily clean underneath and behind this

941
00:42:34,859 --> 00:42:39,569
isn't a great picture but you can see

942
00:42:36,390 --> 00:42:41,729
that these carts are on wheels here and

943
00:42:39,569 --> 00:42:44,449
so that you know they can be moved

944
00:42:41,729 --> 00:42:47,400
easily I guess these are excels really

945
00:42:44,449 --> 00:42:49,140
so then you can clean underneath the

946
00:42:47,400 --> 00:42:52,109
shelf and below that are behind the

947
00:42:49,140 --> 00:42:57,119
shelf more easily than if it was tied to

948
00:42:52,109 --> 00:43:00,259
the ground personnel again this is this

949
00:42:57,119 --> 00:43:03,049
is the same as if you're doing produce

950
00:43:00,259 --> 00:43:05,579
raising threshold produce on your farm

951
00:43:03,049 --> 00:43:07,799
you know you have to make sure that no

952
00:43:05,579 --> 00:43:10,469
one is working sick you know think about

953
00:43:07,799 --> 00:43:13,559
all the germs that are spread if you're

954
00:43:10,469 --> 00:43:15,930
sneezing and just you know everybody has

955
00:43:13,559 --> 00:43:17,430
to use good hygienic practices you're

956
00:43:15,930 --> 00:43:20,940
doing value-added production you need to

957
00:43:17,430 --> 00:43:22,499
wear hair restraints you know eating and

958
00:43:20,940 --> 00:43:27,599
production again these are kind of

959
00:43:22,499 --> 00:43:29,789
common-sense things okay that one area

960
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:32,729
that's kind of again kind of different

961
00:43:29,789 --> 00:43:35,039
from just straight production to

962
00:43:32,729 --> 00:43:36,900
value-added processing then you really

963
00:43:35,039 --> 00:43:38,699
need to think about your raw material

964
00:43:36,900 --> 00:43:41,940
and your your raw materials coming in

965
00:43:38,699 --> 00:43:43,769
and your suppliers that you're using you

966
00:43:41,940 --> 00:43:46,289
need to have some sort of a system in

967
00:43:43,769 --> 00:43:49,559
place to make sure that your the raw

968
00:43:46,289 --> 00:43:51,059
materials that are coming in and the

969
00:43:49,559 --> 00:43:53,099
suppliers that you're using that you

970
00:43:51,059 --> 00:43:55,890
know that that those materials are safe

971
00:43:53,099 --> 00:43:57,660
because your product is only as good as

972
00:43:55,890 --> 00:43:59,910
the ingredients that go into that and

973
00:43:57,660 --> 00:44:02,249
then you know of course even if you're

974
00:43:59,910 --> 00:44:03,690
buying produce from your own far are

975
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:05,249
using produce from your own farm i

976
00:44:03,690 --> 00:44:07,819
should say you know you want to make

977
00:44:05,249 --> 00:44:11,390
sure that that's the best quality safest

978
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:13,799
material that it medic that it can be um

979
00:44:11,390 --> 00:44:15,069
so you know especially if you're getting

980
00:44:13,799 --> 00:44:18,849
in

981
00:44:15,069 --> 00:44:20,319
ingredients from from other places or

982
00:44:18,849 --> 00:44:22,449
your own farm of course you want to have

983
00:44:20,319 --> 00:44:24,009
some sort of inspection procedure you

984
00:44:22,449 --> 00:44:26,109
know for incoming low as making sure

985
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:29,680
that everything is you know meeting the

986
00:44:26,109 --> 00:44:31,299
your requirements and and and that

987
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:33,039
you're also just having good you know

988
00:44:31,299 --> 00:44:36,640
good handling and good storage once

989
00:44:33,039 --> 00:44:37,959
those ingredients get into your your

990
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:43,690
facility where you're doing your

991
00:44:37,959 --> 00:44:46,599
processing okay so then when you're

992
00:44:43,690 --> 00:44:49,059
actually processing you know we make

993
00:44:46,599 --> 00:44:50,589
sure that your whatever ingredients are

994
00:44:49,059 --> 00:44:53,949
coming in first that you're using those

995
00:44:50,589 --> 00:44:57,519
first again kind of common sense and

996
00:44:53,949 --> 00:44:59,829
then another important point here they

997
00:44:57,519 --> 00:45:01,989
have a date and log incoming products I

998
00:44:59,829 --> 00:45:04,690
think I have a slide later where I talk

999
00:45:01,989 --> 00:45:07,239
about traceability and recall a lot

1000
00:45:04,690 --> 00:45:09,160
tracking that's something that's going

1001
00:45:07,239 --> 00:45:12,459
to be even more important under these

1002
00:45:09,160 --> 00:45:16,420
new new Food Safety Modernization Act

1003
00:45:12,459 --> 00:45:19,599
requirements so that's so it's really

1004
00:45:16,420 --> 00:45:22,299
important when you do get in ingredients

1005
00:45:19,599 --> 00:45:24,849
that you're dating dating those

1006
00:45:22,299 --> 00:45:27,549
ingredients in keeping track of what

1007
00:45:24,849 --> 00:45:28,900
ingredients are coming in and you know

1008
00:45:27,549 --> 00:45:32,499
just making sure that you're storing

1009
00:45:28,900 --> 00:45:34,900
your materials in a safe manner you know

1010
00:45:32,499 --> 00:45:36,729
making sure that that everything is as

1011
00:45:34,900 --> 00:45:42,940
good temperature control those are all

1012
00:45:36,729 --> 00:45:46,630
important okay sanitation is super

1013
00:45:42,940 --> 00:45:50,410
important as everybody ensures is is

1014
00:45:46,630 --> 00:45:51,910
well understood you you want to make

1015
00:45:50,410 --> 00:45:56,289
sure that your sanitizing everything

1016
00:45:51,910 --> 00:45:58,959
properly your washing everything and you

1017
00:45:56,289 --> 00:46:01,180
know to again once you get up to the

1018
00:45:58,959 --> 00:46:04,869
higher levels of food safety programs

1019
00:46:01,180 --> 00:46:07,239
and the stricter inspections you have to

1020
00:46:04,869 --> 00:46:09,489
have everything documented of what

1021
00:46:07,239 --> 00:46:10,809
you're doing for cleaning you know if

1022
00:46:09,489 --> 00:46:13,299
you're just using if you're just

1023
00:46:10,809 --> 00:46:15,609
operating under a you know just a state

1024
00:46:13,299 --> 00:46:18,599
of Vermont food processors license they

1025
00:46:15,609 --> 00:46:20,739
don't require you to document your your

1026
00:46:18,599 --> 00:46:22,989
sanitation standard operating procedures

1027
00:46:20,739 --> 00:46:24,640
but again once you start getting to the

1028
00:46:22,989 --> 00:46:26,739
higher levels you need to have that

1029
00:46:24,640 --> 00:46:28,190
documented it's just a matter of writing

1030
00:46:26,739 --> 00:46:30,500
down you know

1031
00:46:28,190 --> 00:46:33,619
step one take apart the mixer step to

1032
00:46:30,500 --> 00:46:36,680
spray it off step three you know wash it

1033
00:46:33,619 --> 00:46:38,030
with a brush that sort of thing but it's

1034
00:46:36,680 --> 00:46:39,980
also a good way you know if you have a

1035
00:46:38,030 --> 00:46:42,829
new employee you can you can show them

1036
00:46:39,980 --> 00:46:44,960
like okay here's our slps or standard

1037
00:46:42,829 --> 00:46:47,470
operating procedures for washing and

1038
00:46:44,960 --> 00:46:49,790
then that easy way to train people

1039
00:46:47,470 --> 00:46:53,569
another point I wanted to make is that

1040
00:46:49,790 --> 00:46:56,359
it's important to have make sure that

1041
00:46:53,569 --> 00:46:57,470
you're doing we should have a schedule

1042
00:46:56,359 --> 00:46:59,240
to kind of make sure that you're all

1043
00:46:57,470 --> 00:47:01,250
cleaning the coolers cleaning the

1044
00:46:59,240 --> 00:47:03,500
hallways these areas that you don't have

1045
00:47:01,250 --> 00:47:05,000
to clean every day but you do need to

1046
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:07,700
make sure you clean them periodically

1047
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:12,369
you know weekly monthly whatever is

1048
00:47:07,700 --> 00:47:14,510
appropriate for your facility okay

1049
00:47:12,369 --> 00:47:17,300
allergen control this is something

1050
00:47:14,510 --> 00:47:19,720
that's really important again under the

1051
00:47:17,300 --> 00:47:23,720
Food Safety Modernization Act but also

1052
00:47:19,720 --> 00:47:25,369
it's really important for because so

1053
00:47:23,720 --> 00:47:27,410
many people are sensitive to allergies

1054
00:47:25,369 --> 00:47:29,960
these days people are really aware of

1055
00:47:27,410 --> 00:47:32,810
allergens and you really want to make

1056
00:47:29,960 --> 00:47:34,160
sure that you're paying attention to

1057
00:47:32,810 --> 00:47:37,040
this because you're a lot of your

1058
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:38,750
customers are so you can see the eight

1059
00:47:37,040 --> 00:47:41,300
major allergens that are listed these

1060
00:47:38,750 --> 00:47:47,660
are the ones that you're required by law

1061
00:47:41,300 --> 00:47:51,800
to list on your label and also to alpha

1062
00:47:47,660 --> 00:47:54,980
to monitor in your facility so here's

1063
00:47:51,800 --> 00:47:56,390
the main points for allergen control you

1064
00:47:54,980 --> 00:47:58,910
know make sure that your raw materials

1065
00:47:56,390 --> 00:48:00,349
are properly label to distort make sure

1066
00:47:58,910 --> 00:48:01,940
you know where your allergy and

1067
00:48:00,349 --> 00:48:05,300
container ingredients are in your

1068
00:48:01,940 --> 00:48:07,730
facility so just you know again kind of

1069
00:48:05,300 --> 00:48:09,530
some common sense things but but just

1070
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:14,750
it's really important to keep to be

1071
00:48:09,530 --> 00:48:17,720
aware of allergens okay pest control

1072
00:48:14,750 --> 00:48:19,990
this is another another thing again

1073
00:48:17,720 --> 00:48:22,790
that's probably this is similar again to

1074
00:48:19,990 --> 00:48:24,349
you know if you're growing produce or if

1075
00:48:22,790 --> 00:48:27,380
you have animals obviously you don't

1076
00:48:24,349 --> 00:48:28,849
want pests everywhere because you know

1077
00:48:27,380 --> 00:48:30,670
they're not good for production and

1078
00:48:28,849 --> 00:48:33,109
they're not good for processing either

1079
00:48:30,670 --> 00:48:36,380
so you really want to just make sure you

1080
00:48:33,109 --> 00:48:39,589
prevent any of those pests from getting

1081
00:48:36,380 --> 00:48:41,580
into your facility but then you know if

1082
00:48:39,589 --> 00:48:42,420
you can't get them if they do

1083
00:48:41,580 --> 00:48:43,680
then you want to make sure they don't

1084
00:48:42,420 --> 00:48:46,230
have anything to eat while they're there

1085
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:50,670
and then if you have to exterminate them

1086
00:48:46,230 --> 00:48:52,830
that's the last resort okay chemical

1087
00:48:50,670 --> 00:48:56,420
control it's also very important to make

1088
00:48:52,830 --> 00:49:00,210
sure that any cleaner sanitizers

1089
00:48:56,420 --> 00:49:02,160
lubricants all those things that are in

1090
00:49:00,210 --> 00:49:05,340
your facility that are not they're not

1091
00:49:02,160 --> 00:49:08,370
actually ingredients you want to make

1092
00:49:05,340 --> 00:49:10,770
sure that they are properly labeled that

1093
00:49:08,370 --> 00:49:12,600
they're stored you know away from the

1094
00:49:10,770 --> 00:49:16,170
food and that you're using them at the

1095
00:49:12,600 --> 00:49:19,290
right amount you know if you if you

1096
00:49:16,170 --> 00:49:21,330
think a cup of sanitizer is is good well

1097
00:49:19,290 --> 00:49:24,360
two cups is better that's unfortunately

1098
00:49:21,330 --> 00:49:30,240
not true if a cup is what's required you

1099
00:49:24,360 --> 00:49:31,530
use a cup that's it okay another program

1100
00:49:30,240 --> 00:49:36,900
that you have to think about is blast

1101
00:49:31,530 --> 00:49:39,870
control you know if you're sometimes you

1102
00:49:36,900 --> 00:49:42,420
know if you're using glass glass jars

1103
00:49:39,870 --> 00:49:43,920
you know for your packaging then it's

1104
00:49:42,420 --> 00:49:46,610
pretty obvious like oh I got to make

1105
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:49,650
sure I I don't have breakage of Blass

1106
00:49:46,610 --> 00:49:51,330
but also you know everybody has light

1107
00:49:49,650 --> 00:49:53,460
bulbs almost over it because light bulbs

1108
00:49:51,330 --> 00:49:55,790
in their facility so you want to make

1109
00:49:53,460 --> 00:50:00,210
sure that those light bulbs are covered

1110
00:49:55,790 --> 00:50:02,490
and you want to make sure that you know

1111
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:05,760
that that you know where all the glass

1112
00:50:02,490 --> 00:50:09,300
is in your facility and then you so you

1113
00:50:05,760 --> 00:50:11,730
can prevent any breakage from occurring

1114
00:50:09,300 --> 00:50:13,080
and even if you can't prevent the

1115
00:50:11,730 --> 00:50:14,700
breakage from occurring at least you can

1116
00:50:13,080 --> 00:50:17,460
detect it like you know where to look

1117
00:50:14,700 --> 00:50:20,550
for glass breakage I mean nobody wants

1118
00:50:17,460 --> 00:50:23,070
to have a piece of glass end up in there

1119
00:50:20,550 --> 00:50:29,520
beautiful sauce that they're selling to

1120
00:50:23,070 --> 00:50:31,470
people ok so I think this is the last

1121
00:50:29,520 --> 00:50:34,860
category of these sort of things i'll

1122
00:50:31,470 --> 00:50:37,680
talk about foreign materials again you

1123
00:50:34,860 --> 00:50:41,730
know nobody wants to see a nut your

1124
00:50:37,680 --> 00:50:43,410
bulbs or you know a person knife or you

1125
00:50:41,730 --> 00:50:45,870
know a piece of wood or a chunk of

1126
00:50:43,410 --> 00:50:49,260
plastic you know we don't want to see

1127
00:50:45,870 --> 00:50:51,270
those in our food products and see so

1128
00:50:49,260 --> 00:50:54,270
there's a lot of potential sources you

1129
00:50:51,270 --> 00:50:55,320
can see them all listed here how these

1130
00:50:54,270 --> 00:50:59,550
pharma shows can

1131
00:50:55,320 --> 00:51:01,740
into your food product so in order to

1132
00:50:59,550 --> 00:51:04,410
control them you want to make sure that

1133
00:51:01,740 --> 00:51:06,420
you're doing good visual inspection when

1134
00:51:04,410 --> 00:51:08,460
you're receiving the products to

1135
00:51:06,420 --> 00:51:09,990
receiving the raw material sorry that

1136
00:51:08,460 --> 00:51:11,820
you don't have you know chunks of wood

1137
00:51:09,990 --> 00:51:15,000
and your carrots or something like that

1138
00:51:11,820 --> 00:51:17,190
or big rocks or something and you know

1139
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:18,750
when you're adding ingredients to the

1140
00:51:17,190 --> 00:51:21,930
mixer make sure that you're watching

1141
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:25,080
that there's no you know chunks of stray

1142
00:51:21,930 --> 00:51:27,270
things coming in and just practicing you

1143
00:51:25,080 --> 00:51:29,580
know good hygiene and good housekeeping

1144
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:31,290
those are all important things but just

1145
00:51:29,580 --> 00:51:32,550
things to keep in mind and like you've

1146
00:51:31,290 --> 00:51:36,750
been having a pen in your coat pocket

1147
00:51:32,550 --> 00:51:39,120
your if it's a lab coat if you lean over

1148
00:51:36,750 --> 00:51:42,410
that pen could fall in and you don't

1149
00:51:39,120 --> 00:51:44,820
want to penn ending up in your products

1150
00:51:42,410 --> 00:51:47,520
okay i mentioned earlier traceability

1151
00:51:44,820 --> 00:51:51,000
and recall again this is something

1152
00:51:47,520 --> 00:51:54,000
that's really of growing importance and

1153
00:51:51,000 --> 00:51:55,890
it's important that you know you need to

1154
00:51:54,000 --> 00:51:57,360
know where your ingredients came from

1155
00:51:55,890 --> 00:51:59,790
you need to know who you bought them

1156
00:51:57,360 --> 00:52:01,730
from you need to know which ingredients

1157
00:51:59,790 --> 00:52:04,710
went into every batch of your product

1158
00:52:01,730 --> 00:52:09,240
and then you need to know where your

1159
00:52:04,710 --> 00:52:10,770
products are going because you know we

1160
00:52:09,240 --> 00:52:12,930
hope that everybody is producing say

1161
00:52:10,770 --> 00:52:15,360
product that you never have to issue a

1162
00:52:12,930 --> 00:52:16,890
recall but if you do you need to know

1163
00:52:15,360 --> 00:52:20,460
where your products are going and what

1164
00:52:16,890 --> 00:52:22,350
could also happen to and maybe more more

1165
00:52:20,460 --> 00:52:24,840
likely is that one of the ingredients

1166
00:52:22,350 --> 00:52:28,710
that you use like maybe your salt or

1167
00:52:24,840 --> 00:52:31,560
maybe your you know whatever is your

1168
00:52:28,710 --> 00:52:35,880
starter culture maybe that's recalled

1169
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:39,150
and then you have to know what batches

1170
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:42,630
thats all to that starter culture went

1171
00:52:39,150 --> 00:52:49,260
into so that you can recall that final

1172
00:52:42,630 --> 00:52:53,580
product if you need to so you need to

1173
00:52:49,260 --> 00:52:56,310
have an accurate documentation of your

1174
00:52:53,580 --> 00:53:00,570
receiving of your ingredients of your

1175
00:52:56,310 --> 00:53:02,880
lot coding systems you have to know you

1176
00:53:00,570 --> 00:53:08,070
have to document your distribution where

1177
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:09,210
your products are going and I can I can

1178
00:53:08,070 --> 00:53:13,890
provide you with

1179
00:53:09,210 --> 00:53:17,630
examples of this receiving log if you're

1180
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:23,130
interested and here's that here is the

1181
00:53:17,630 --> 00:53:27,200
distribution record example and Jesse

1182
00:53:23,130 --> 00:53:29,820
your question is an excellent question

1183
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:31,500
you asked about if there's any good

1184
00:53:29,820 --> 00:53:33,890
software programs that help with lot

1185
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,900
tracking are they affordable actually

1186
00:53:33,890 --> 00:53:39,240
thank you for prompting that because the

1187
00:53:36,900 --> 00:53:40,830
Vermont farm viability program is

1188
00:53:39,240 --> 00:53:43,890
actually sponsoring a project right now

1189
00:53:40,830 --> 00:53:45,720
on a lot tracking and they did a survey

1190
00:53:43,890 --> 00:53:48,000
I'm not tracking to find out what people

1191
00:53:45,720 --> 00:53:50,250
are using and and they're looking into

1192
00:53:48,000 --> 00:53:54,150
and the guy's name is Stan Ward that's

1193
00:53:50,250 --> 00:53:57,150
organizing it and he's also looking into

1194
00:53:54,150 --> 00:53:59,700
all the different like software programs

1195
00:53:57,150 --> 00:54:01,530
that are available there's a number of

1196
00:53:59,700 --> 00:54:03,870
them available you just told me today I

1197
00:54:01,530 --> 00:54:05,840
think that's that we found like 27

1198
00:54:03,870 --> 00:54:09,510
different programs or something

1199
00:54:05,840 --> 00:54:12,000
unfortunately all those well some of

1200
00:54:09,510 --> 00:54:16,340
them are definitely more affordable than

1201
00:54:12,000 --> 00:54:19,680
others for those lot tracking software

1202
00:54:16,340 --> 00:54:23,670
and so one of the outcomes of that

1203
00:54:19,680 --> 00:54:26,450
project is intended to intended to make

1204
00:54:23,670 --> 00:54:31,110
sure that there's you know hopefully a

1205
00:54:26,450 --> 00:54:35,060
provision of a affordable and easy to

1206
00:54:31,110 --> 00:54:39,720
use and you know appropriate to scale

1207
00:54:35,060 --> 00:54:42,720
lot tracking system so yeah great

1208
00:54:39,720 --> 00:54:49,890
question and yeah you can buy really

1209
00:54:42,720 --> 00:54:52,290
expensive programs to Tony yeah link is

1210
00:54:49,890 --> 00:54:54,480
that a link for the those records that i

1211
00:54:52,290 --> 00:54:58,200
was talking about the distribution and

1212
00:54:54,480 --> 00:55:00,090
receiving records I can't send I can

1213
00:54:58,200 --> 00:55:10,190
send a link for those if you're

1214
00:55:00,090 --> 00:55:14,480
interested okay so the other

1215
00:55:10,190 --> 00:55:17,010
prerequisite programs wrapping up here

1216
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:20,370
you know we hope that nobody will have

1217
00:55:17,010 --> 00:55:21,450
any complaints because the you know of

1218
00:55:20,370 --> 00:55:22,770
course your products are going to be

1219
00:55:21,450 --> 00:55:28,440
great

1220
00:55:22,770 --> 00:55:29,820
but it's if there is a if you if you do

1221
00:55:28,440 --> 00:55:32,790
ever get complaints you really need to

1222
00:55:29,820 --> 00:55:34,140
log them and track them that way you can

1223
00:55:32,790 --> 00:55:38,550
find out you know if you need to make

1224
00:55:34,140 --> 00:55:40,740
any corrections to your system labeling

1225
00:55:38,550 --> 00:55:41,790
is also really important i mentioned

1226
00:55:40,740 --> 00:55:43,710
labeling a little bit in the

1227
00:55:41,790 --> 00:55:47,640
presentation i do have a fact sheet

1228
00:55:43,710 --> 00:55:50,340
again on labeling and i do workshops and

1229
00:55:47,640 --> 00:55:55,200
so on and labeling as well so that's

1230
00:55:50,340 --> 00:55:57,480
important too and then the food defence

1231
00:55:55,200 --> 00:55:58,890
and security prevention of intentional

1232
00:55:57,480 --> 00:56:06,090
contamination that's also something

1233
00:55:58,890 --> 00:56:08,970
that's kind of growing importance and so

1234
00:56:06,090 --> 00:56:12,600
yeah i'll follow both of the slides and

1235
00:56:08,970 --> 00:56:16,470
i'll address Tony's question there so

1236
00:56:12,600 --> 00:56:18,030
this additional information so you can

1237
00:56:16,470 --> 00:56:19,500
see I have a number so there's some

1238
00:56:18,030 --> 00:56:22,260
upcoming trainings and then these fact

1239
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:24,930
sheets that have been talking about the

1240
00:56:22,260 --> 00:56:27,720
number of links to different places are

1241
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:31,260
available here from this URL that's

1242
00:56:27,720 --> 00:56:34,350
listed Jesse's also listed in the chat

1243
00:56:31,260 --> 00:56:35,970
box a few times then I just want to

1244
00:56:34,350 --> 00:56:38,910
mention Vermont has a food safety task

1245
00:56:35,970 --> 00:56:41,550
force that we're trying to get more

1246
00:56:38,910 --> 00:56:43,530
quickly to information from all

1247
00:56:41,550 --> 00:56:50,220
different aspects of vermont in one

1248
00:56:43,530 --> 00:56:53,160
place there's my contact details so if

1249
00:56:50,220 --> 00:56:54,600
you have any specific questions or any

1250
00:56:53,160 --> 00:56:57,690
information that you want me to be sure

1251
00:56:54,600 --> 00:57:02,040
to provide you you can send me an email

1252
00:56:57,690 --> 00:57:06,060
or give me a call and tony a link for

1253
00:57:02,040 --> 00:57:08,490
the software for the tracking at this

1254
00:57:06,060 --> 00:57:13,260
point like i said there's like twenty

1255
00:57:08,490 --> 00:57:16,460
seven different software systems so I

1256
00:57:13,260 --> 00:57:20,280
don't have I don't have all those links

1257
00:57:16,460 --> 00:57:22,050
readily available but I can send you

1258
00:57:20,280 --> 00:57:26,130
again if you send me an email i can send

1259
00:57:22,050 --> 00:57:30,260
you at least this the report of the slot

1260
00:57:26,130 --> 00:57:33,690
tracking project that's going on and and

1261
00:57:30,260 --> 00:57:35,340
hopefully the final product the final

1262
00:57:33,690 --> 00:57:36,450
results of the project will be out soon

1263
00:57:35,340 --> 00:57:39,089
as and then we'll

1264
00:57:36,450 --> 00:57:40,890
have then we'll have that information

1265
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,599
more readily available as i can give you

1266
00:57:40,890 --> 00:57:44,640
the guy's name is doing that project too

1267
00:57:42,599 --> 00:57:50,040
and he can probably give you all those

1268
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:51,990
links pretty easily so with that I'm

1269
00:57:50,040 --> 00:57:54,960
sorry I see it's two minutes to eight

1270
00:57:51,990 --> 00:57:57,660
but I'm happy to take any questions in

1271
00:57:54,960 --> 00:57:59,700
the remaining time that we have londa

1272
00:57:57,660 --> 00:58:02,550
thank you so much you covered such a

1273
00:57:59,700 --> 00:58:04,589
wealth of information here in a short

1274
00:58:02,550 --> 00:58:08,060
