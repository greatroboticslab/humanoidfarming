  "text": "oh that's crooked whoops okay okay I think we're good to go well hey guys Natalie here and welcome back to hey it's a good life and welcome to my kitchen table where we are going to be spending a lot of time together listen here as we launch this new series than all about featuring people in the community or doing good today's video features Steven Cornett of nature isn't always right steven is a regenerative small-scale farmer who's had a really successful market garden over the last three years he's sold that local farmers market and has his own YouTube channel as well where he shares his knowledge with you he's on a mission to equip as many people as possible to get started with their farm even if it's in their backyard steven is a wealth of knowledge and we covered so many topics please consider this video a 30,000 foot overview of small-scale regenerative farming and how you can get started growing big in a small space I will of course provide as many info cars right here as I possibly can linking topics covered it in this video to videos on Stevens Channel where he goes more in depth so in this video we'll get to know Steven a little bit about how he got into farming his beliefs about farming why his name is nature's always right how he set his farm on a small scale to be really successful and what he and his wife are up to next so without further ado let's get into the video [Music] so what did seven-year-old Stephen do nothing man oh so no seven years old uh probably a video game designer something like that I think my first job was working at a golf course in all 15 and I had to do weed whacking and mowing lawn and I needed it and like I promised myself I'm never working outside ever I'm gonna go to college and then get a desk job you know that's what I thought my head and then I got older and I got some more wisdom and I learned more about reality and the world and all the stuff and and I realized today I'm with my friend Steven Cornett everybody nature's always right and we're here at his property before he leaves to Tennessee and we're doing some cleanup today and I thought I would come out and share with you guys about how you can get started in a small space with regenerative farming so Lauren lemon grove San Diego as you can see we're in a backyard so I do all of this in my backyard plus over time I got other plots so my next-door neighbor's yard had moved into his yard and then I've rented or leased another plot down the road and tell us what your lease terms are you pay them in I pay them in vegetables so I found people that wanted their yards to be improved or turned into gardens and in exchange given the vegetables like it's the best lease ever yeah that's so really nicely if I like those terms how much space did you have when you first started carving yeah okay so well when I first started farming this is like eight years ago another part of San Diego and my best friend Jarrett Smith started a farm called Jared's real food that started just with like 24 8 by 4 foot raised beds now fast forward to here three years ago or a little over three years ago when I started this the first part of the plot was this square right here and initially that's all the landlord's allowed me to do they didn't but over time as they saw be more successful and they liked it more and things like that they allowed me to build a few more beds over here for like a home gardener or I guess someone in their apartment got a bunch of really nice soil these grow bags and the system which is awesome it's a cool system if you want to have another area I can move these to which is kind of neat at different times of the year you're gonna get better Sun in different areas so you can move it there that's something I like about the girl bags and now what I'm doing because I'm leaving I'm just I'm selling these so I'm gonna get a bunch of my money and like the investment money I'll get it back when I sell it I paid off my investment in one season and made like twice what I put into it so it was very effective for a short little season kind of one of the things I wanted to prove was possible in a backyard what's the show you could create all your own nutrients on-site or at least most of the nutrients that you needed for your farm on-site and I wanted you to show that you could start farming in a backyard on a really small scale be successful at that and then go to the next level at a larger scale so that's kind of the whole reason behind this backyard and this YouTube channel that I make all about doing this stuff as well the chicken coop is a big deal for me that's how I make all of my compost 20 chickens in there dropping a lot of manure I can make really good compost I'm betting and everything compost number one so the chicken coop is a deep litter system which means I'm putting in layers of carbon in here vegetative material like straw leaves cardboard things like that floor is like al is alive it's always making compost so what I do is I rake it all out of here and I take it out here and then I mix it with a bed of vegetables that's done for more greens to make the ratio correct and cool so this is what you describe as the engine of your farm yes definitely this works I was able to run my Market Garden for three years basically just off this this compost and not much else but from a business standpoint it's cheaper to buy in the compost that to use my labor if you wanna do this as a business and I recommend buying it but it's still great to have a system like this to process all of your leftover waste they're making compost for me for free with no work what would you tell Stephen eight years ago Stephen okay I got to go work smarter and not harder a lot of things like that were hard on my back I'm just bending over and lifting things like that or you know so now that I'm older I do a lot more things ergonomically and or I'm gonna do a task I try to think well what's the least physical effort I could do to get it done I guess I tell my younger self to think about your future body and take care of it this is the disaster this so this is my worm system it's essentially designed on the three toe system I like I got your top taupe here is where your fresh is adding will be most of your worms will be also a tote underneath this is typically where your castings will be any juice or like the leachate that comes out fall into the third toe and on my system this whole bottom shelf here is the third tone I did this to save money cuz I would have had to buy a third tote for each one of these it's modular I can have more totes to it if you take this out and carry it to where I want to fertilize so it's been a really great system for me why nature is always right sure came from the idea that this is a nature's are already a perfect design as perfect as it could be on this imperfect planet it's the idea that nature itself is gonna provide the best solutions for growing food for health or whatever issues that we really have on this book on this planet it's already the solutions are already here for us to to take and use but unfortunately especially in Western society we've gone down this road of thinking that our God and that we are more than God we can create on top of God so we've done things like GMO crops and other scimplet you know synthetically derived pharmaceuticals you know all of this is just mimicry fentanyl or oxycontin this is a synthetic derivative of opium which comes from a plant so nothing is new the airplane we mimic the bird like we didn't come up with any of this stuff we we saw it we saw it in creation we mimicked it and then we use it or we improve it but we haven't really created any so I guess it just goes back to the idea that nature and natural systems will always be the best way to grow food so trying to find kind of strike the balance between because agriculture isn't a natural process right so trying to make agriculture as natural as as we possibly can what kind of health struggle did you encounter that led you into farming my big one the big health problem that I had was self-inflicted mm-hmm because of listening to medical advice and I was desperate for a cure so I had really bad acne when I was in high school some cystic acne and you know the real nasty bad guy so yeah under my my back and so that's with a lot of teenagers it's a horrible experience and you hate it you hate how you look and so I wanted to fix it like now that I was on an antibiotic for like four or five months because the theory is that you're killing all the germs that live inside the pores so they can't get inflamed and then the pus develops and all that but if you guys know it's obliterates your gut bacteria on your whole body massively damaging to the digestive system then later I did accutane which limits vitamin A production in your body and the lubrication of your body anyways what resulted from this was like digestive problems oh yeah I eventually had to go see a doctor even and to figure out what the heck's going on and but ultimately I adopter didn't help me I solved it myself I had to fix it myself because then I finally figured out what was going on and and while I was having the problems I was having and then change my diet boom fixed never had a problem again back behind here you're seeing 18 different grow beds here they're all about 40 foot long they're 30 inches wide and this is the standard Market Garden like small scale farm size and a lot of people like it just because you can stand over it you can step over the road really easy they're easy to work in stuff now my very small pathways though as you can see because I've got to fit as much grow room in here as possible because like I said I'm on in a backyard I'm this back square right here is about five thousand square feet it's like an eighth of an acre back here so it's not very big and I focus on lots of crops that are the most profitable so things that grow quickly turn over within 60 days typically or I can harvest them for a very long window of time like chard or kale or tomatoes cucumbers salad salad mixes like my my go-to thing I'm make the most money on salad mix heads of lettuce and microgreens I really focus on those and I have a whole method for growing salad mixes and washing and packing them and it's kind of a whole thing because there's a lot of labor involved but we cut out some of that labor by some of these awesome DIY inventions that that the small farmers have come up with like the salad spinner made from a washing machine or a greens bubbler made from just pipe at a Jacuzzi pump so this is kind of half taken apart right now but this is my post-harvest station it's most of its set up to clean salad greens and microgreens but this used to be was a greens bubbler it basically blows air did this jacuzzi pump it blows it through these tubes and creates a ton of bubbles basically just mixing all the the greens pulling the dirt and bugs off and from there it goes to the spinner electricity's off otherwise I would show you but it just spins this basket now I'm just like yourself spinner at your house it gets off most of the water and then it comes through the drying table it's got fans on it to flow air over the top yeah and then after this I would bag the greens Curtis Stone for sure Curtis Stone the urban farmer on YouTube and he's also got a fantastic farming book I recommend for everybody called the urban farmer so he's the one who really kind of dialed in these super small-scale techniques his stuff was all in urban Lots and that's what was different about it so he's one who helped me to really conceptualize how to think of the profitability of a crop how to analyze a crops performance and then and then decide well maybe I should select something else that would make a little bit more money because on a small scale like this every little bit counts all the efficiencies really matter too so he helped me like really put all these ideas together with what I already knew about how to raise plants regenerative lee so how would you describe your style of farming zai know you take from a lot of different methodologies yeah I'm so for me it's I guess to call myself a natural farmer holistic farmer regenerative farmer I don't know what the right term would be I guess but I just like I use any method that is natural it's made from nature I either sell by making compost compost teas do worm castings things that are made within nature like even using plants such as cover crops using the plants themselves to put nutrients down into the soil no-till so we're never or very rarely tilling the ground or you know turning the subsoils and mixing those subsoils together it also chops up microbes fungal strands the communication network all the different billions and billions of organisms that exist some of the soil they're being disturbed their homes being messed up and those microbes are responsible for the breakdown of nutrients in the soil which then gets transmitted to the plants through communication the plants actually ask for specific nutrients and they give out carbohydrates to the microbes so the microbes get food and the plants get food and there's this constant exchange going on the Korean natural farming now making your own nutrients kind of to the extreme where you can you can create every input that you would ever need for your farm so I'm kind of constantly experimenting with all these different methods from around the world to see what works on this context as a growing for money or also for growing just for your home scale what makes sense for everybody and I just want to really awake in people's minds to God's design of nature and plants and all of this how they communicate with the soil give them a deeper understanding that will allow them to garden without any chemicals with nothing just using the design of nature how has farming grown you as a person oh I can't even begin to yeah to tell you I want you to help me grow it helped me realize everything the truth about this world this reality that God is actually real it helped me understand that there is a design and a designer to all of this I studied like biology slow biology and plants the more you dive down deeper deeper deeper it just gets more complex and I just had to admit that how is this not a design it's obviously a design the way it all works together to you the way the soil the plants the birds the animals the everything it's an obvious system and systems are designed I guess that was a big way that it changed me and just the amount of lessons that are out in the garden or the farm it like the whole lesson of life is out there for you to go find if you're paying attention enough but ultimately I think it spiritually just strengthens my belief in God and that it's it is real I can't deny that creation we have no reason to deny God because you can't deny that this is a creation in just finding out the truth that Wow the food that you grow in your backyard that is your medicine that is the key to your health diet and what you put into your body and just knowing that that is the the truth because I've experienced it now for eight years I've experienced the change in my health my families have my mental health so you guys are on a big adventure and something we didn't talk about earlier is why are we cleaning up your farm well because we're shutting it down because we're moving so it's really excited actually we're gonna be going to Tennessee to buy our dream land and homestead and all that so that's kind of the next part of the journey is how do I take a backyard farm take it out to the country and you know build a much bigger really cool property so I'm excited to show everybody what's next so tell us like what do you envision what's your ideal situation on so we're looking for like five to ten acres you know somewhere about like 30 to 50 minutes outside of a major city now for the land I want a little bit of flat a little bit of everything like a little bit flat a little bit of hills a little bit of forest in the back maybe a stream or a pond would be incredible don't have one maybe I'll build a pond but yes Tennessee is cool cuz it you know we get 50 inches of rain out there so it's like you the irrigate and a lot of fun things but it'll be more difficult growing yeah a lot of bugs the weather's more difficult so different obstacles but this is one that you guys have waited for for a long time yeah very long time something you've looked forward to for over a decade okay yeah most of that probably yeah I've been dreaming of having my own land and they're getting to develop whatever I want and doing you know a crazy big very diverse complex system so I'm excited to combine trees and perennials and annuals all together there's something awesome so if you guys know of any cool places out there in Tennessee I've got a lot of snow [Music] you guys thank you so much for joining me tonight it has been so good to be with you I know that I'm sitting at my computer is so happy to be with you guys really excited for 2020 I'm on this mission to help as many people say yes to their dreams say no to the limiting beliefs and get
