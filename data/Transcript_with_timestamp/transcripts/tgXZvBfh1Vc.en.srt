00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,320
so

3
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:50,800
so with organic pesticide this one you

4
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,000
make it with the local available word

5
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:53,920
materials

6
00:00:52,000 --> 00:00:55,600
when you're using the organic pesticide

7
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
if you also cut the water if you have

8
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:58,800
the cost of production because you're

9
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,600
not going to spend some other money in

10
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,600
buying some other

11
00:01:10,840 --> 00:01:15,759
pesticides of that vegetable all you are

12
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,640
enemy they are confessed

13
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:19,040
so

14
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:20,960
what you are producing as vegetable is a

15
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:23,119
food for something

16
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:26,000
so that those living organisms we can

17
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:28,720
come and feed on our plant either by

18
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:29,759
sucking the gross almond or by eating

19
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:32,560
the leaves

20
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:33,840
or by eating the fruits and today we are

21
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:35,840
showing you

22
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,759
how to control

23
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:41,840
the infestation of pests in our

24
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:44,159
vegetables using organic material

25
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:46,240
organic material meals

26
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:49,040
you prepare it in the absence of kevin

27
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:51,360
there is no chemical component here the

28
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,560
whole chemical will come from the

29
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:55,439
solution

30
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:57,600
will act like chemical commercial family

31
00:01:55,439 --> 00:01:58,560
for that in the best okay

32
00:01:57,600 --> 00:02:00,719
so

33
00:01:58,560 --> 00:02:03,360
we want to know how to prepare it

34
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:06,079
locally so that you are able to make

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:09,280
sure that you control pests

36
00:02:06,079 --> 00:02:11,680
at the reduced cost or at low cost

37
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,040
as you maximize profit in your

38
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
production okay

39
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,720
so the materials here

40
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,440
are the things that we are going to use

41
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:21,040
these are all available

42
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:23,200
from today when you go back you have to

43
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:24,640
plant aloe vera red pepper you have to

44
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:26,959
plant bread better

45
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:29,120
right now you are producing onions okay

46
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,720
if the onion the real bulb is not there

47
00:02:29,120 --> 00:02:33,519
you can use the leaves

48
00:02:30,720 --> 00:02:36,980
okay onion beans can also work well

49
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:42,640
because of its fungus

50
00:02:36,980 --> 00:02:44,560
[Music]

51
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:46,239

52
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:47,680
flowers around the corner there are some

53
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:48,800
flowers

54
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:51,280
for us

55
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:53,280

organic pesticides for example i have

65
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:39,200
aloe vera here in my hand

66
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:42,480
which is used

67
00:03:39,200 --> 00:03:45,680
as a fertilizer because it has

68
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:47,040
ingredients like mathematics

69
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:49,840
potassium

70
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:52,239
and many harvest it also

71
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:52,239
control

72
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:59,840
and many other festive

00:03:56,239 --> 00:04:01,599
caterpillars beetles and

74
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,319
this is a red pepper

75
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,680
alpine filling one of the materials used

76
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:10,159
in making our organic persistent

77
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:12,480
in this in this filipina

78
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:16,000
it is when we are using in five liters

79
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:19,040
of water we take one cup of filipinos we

80
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:21,600
found it and we put it in our container

81
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:24,320
milipeli contains the active ingredients

82
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,840
which helps in controlling athletes

83
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:27,120
caterpillars

84
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:29,280
and

85
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:30,800
and also beetles

86
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:32,479
and it's called

87
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:34,240
marigold

88
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,320
when you using it

89
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:38,720
you get like uh

90
00:04:36,320 --> 00:04:40,400
five cups of the leaves

91
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:44,160
how you found it

92
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:47,520
after pounding you put it in your

93
00:04:44,160 --> 00:04:49,680
container the marigold are the active

94
00:04:47,520 --> 00:04:52,400
ingredients that works on

95
00:04:49,680 --> 00:04:54,560
our first like the

96
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:56,560
the caterpillars

97
00:04:54,560 --> 00:05:00,000
and the cat worms

98
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,280
so they are actually used in controlling

99
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,160
those

100
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:05,039
pests

101
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:05,039
in our crops

102
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:12,160
is one of the materials among them and

103
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,840
here i'm having neem leaf it works

104
00:05:12,160 --> 00:05:17,039
in thing like

105
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:19,680
control of fungus diseases

106
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:22,160
bananas weevils

107
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:24,400
today i'm very very happy because we are

108
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,520
learning about how to make

109
00:05:24,400 --> 00:05:27,039
organic

110
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:29,680
pesticides

111
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:32,800
in behind here i have

112
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:35,199
tomatoes leaves when you pound it then

113
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:38,400
mix it with other substances that is

114
00:05:35,199 --> 00:05:40,800
used in making organic pesticides and it

115
00:05:38,400 --> 00:05:42,720
is

116
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:45,440
some it brings some irritation in

117
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,960
insects and definitely kills the insect

118
00:05:45,440 --> 00:05:49,039
like it

119
00:05:46,960 --> 00:05:51,600
helps in controlling

120
00:05:49,039 --> 00:05:53,199
face like heartwarm

121
00:05:51,600 --> 00:05:55,919
caterpillars

122
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:58,560
and the rest of it so we have many pets

123
00:05:55,919 --> 00:06:00,240
that destroyed our crop so this one

124
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:01,600
would help a lot

125
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:04,240
if you're

126
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:05,199
very very proud to be here in a later

127
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:08,080
training

128
00:06:05,199 --> 00:06:10,800
institute here is our one of our

129
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,199
material for making organic pesticide

130
00:06:10,800 --> 00:06:15,440
this is onion balm if you want to make

131
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,160
it you can use this one something like

132
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:20,880
seven of them and in absence of that one

133
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:24,080
you can use the leaf something like half

134
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:25,919
of a kilo and this onion tab you can

135
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:26,800
take it to the mortar and then you pound

136
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:29,199
it

137
00:06:26,800 --> 00:06:30,720
and from there this one it acts as a

138
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,919
repellent also

139
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:36,080
it is it controls what is so-called hand

140
00:06:33,919 --> 00:06:37,840
both red and then

141
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:41,360
and then black and

142
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:43,840
not only that one it can also control

143
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,360
it can also control army warm

144
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:48,639
and then

145
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:52,319
up it and then cut one also so that is

146
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:52,319
all about the onion thank you

147
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:58,199
in case one of them

148
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:05,199
okay thank you very much in case of one

149
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:07,120
of the materials means maybe you don't

150
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:08,720
have the aloe vera

151
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,039
but you have the

152
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:12,240
you have the

153
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:14,639
like the

154
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:17,840
red pepper the red pepper can also work

155
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:19,440
on artists aloe vera can also work on

156
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:22,000
so in the absence of aloe vera you can

157
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:22,000
use that one

158
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:25,759
in the absence of the red pepper you can

159
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:25,759
use that

160
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,880
then you can drop one in the oven of the

161
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,880
tomatoes

162
00:07:33,780 --> 00:07:38,240
[Music]

163
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:39,919
we're going to pound it after pounding

164
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:42,880
we water them when we keep in this

165
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:44,800
container for 3 days after 30 days we're

166
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
going to see the solution

167
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:48,560
and we use it for

168
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:50,160
again for spraying our crops in

169
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:53,280
depending

170
00:07:50,160 --> 00:07:53,280
again the space like

171
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,160
caterpillars

172
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:10,960
this is how you are going to pound it if

173
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,080
you cannot pound like this you can chop

174
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:16,400
them chop them into small pieces

175
00:08:14,080 --> 00:08:19,360
how you chop a green vegetable when

176
00:08:16,400 --> 00:08:19,360
you're preparing it

177
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:25,440
so you make sure that the leaves are

178
00:08:24,319 --> 00:08:26,560
broken

179
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:29,039
to leave

180
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,319
those inner contents to be able to

181
00:08:29,039 --> 00:08:32,959
release their

182
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:35,279
uh substance into the water okay

183
00:08:32,959 --> 00:08:38,000
so if you have water you can pound like

184
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:41,120
this now we have this one it's already

185
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:42,000
five five handful of the tomato leaves

186
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,640
okay

187
00:08:42,000 --> 00:08:46,160
we are also going to add it here okay

188
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:49,200
you add it here

189
00:08:46,160 --> 00:08:49,200
and then we found what

190
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:52,800
let us found aloe vera

191
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,880
aloe vera

192
00:08:54,720 --> 00:08:58,720
we can even you can mix all this

193
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:01,120
material all together and you pound at

194
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:03,760
once if you have a bigger motor

195
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,630
i get to that so you can put this aloe

196
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:09,929
vera

197
00:09:06,630 --> 00:09:09,929
[Music]

198
00:09:14,959 --> 00:09:20,720
so you cut the onions we also found all

199
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,839
together the onion leaves okay

200
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,160
so why are we using onions

201
00:09:23,839 --> 00:09:27,440
it's a repellent and it also controls

202
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,760
our foods okay

203
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:33,519
then we are going to put we are going to

204
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:36,480
also pound together one cup of

205
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,640
red pepper

206
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,320
pants carefully you have to be careful

207
00:09:38,640 --> 00:09:43,600
otherwise

208
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:43,600
so remaining two onions

209
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:51,200
now

210
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:54,320
the process

211
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:58,240
the process of mixing all these things

212
00:09:54,320 --> 00:09:59,600
together and then put add water into it

213
00:09:58,240 --> 00:10:02,240
is to allow

214
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:05,040
what is called decoction

215
00:10:02,240 --> 00:10:07,839
decoction it means

216
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:10,320
you have taken tea all right

217
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
the tea leaves is dry but when you put

218
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,360
in water

219
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,519
after sometimes you find the color of

220
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,720
that water change okay

221
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:18,640
it means

222
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,120
the solute the material then the

223
00:10:18,640 --> 00:10:23,519
component of the tea leaves has gotten

224
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:24,720
into the water and change the color are

225
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:27,040
you getting that

226
00:10:24,720 --> 00:10:28,640
so the active ingredients in these

227
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,680
materials

228
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:33,279
will get into the water the process of

229
00:10:31,680 --> 00:10:35,680
this material this

230
00:10:33,279 --> 00:10:38,160
in active ingredient getting into the

231
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:41,200
water is called the option okay

232
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,760
so the process of

233
00:10:41,200 --> 00:10:46,079
for us to get what we need to control

234
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:48,800
first those active ingredients we must

235
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:50,240
keep it in water for 3

236
00:10:48,800 --> 00:10:52,160
30 days okay

237
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:55,440
so we are going to keep it we are going

238
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:57,920
to stand it in water for feeding days

239
00:10:55,440 --> 00:11:00,079
after 3 days we shall see

240
00:10:57,920 --> 00:11:02,160
this material and then we get only the

241
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,399
solution down there okay

242
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,640
that solution has all the active

243
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:08,640
ingredients which will kill

244
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,279
different kind of pests

245
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:13,760
so long as we apply onto the

246
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:15,279
on to them okay so it will give us a

247
00:11:13,760 --> 00:11:16,480
contact

248
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:19,279
pesticide

249
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:22,000
now you can see this is a mixture of

250
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:24,880
onions red pepper

251
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,959
and the

252
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:28,800
aloe vera okay no

253
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:30,720
you have to take care of your option

254
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:32,959
so you pour it here

255
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:32,959
good

256
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,720
then now you can put some water there

257
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:38,320
you rinse

258
00:11:36,720 --> 00:11:41,120
pour water in the mortar and then you

259
00:11:38,320 --> 00:11:41,120
also add it here

260
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:45,279
so i think this one doesn't doesn't

261
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:47,519
deserve only five liters

262
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:50,480
this material is too much

263
00:11:47,519 --> 00:11:53,120
let us prepare a solution of 10 liter

264
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,399
out of this okay

265
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,200
later

266
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,480
so the only challenge with the organic

267
00:11:57,200 --> 00:12:02,000
materials

268
00:11:58,480 --> 00:12:03,920
we do not know exactly what quantity of

269
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,160
any active ingredient present in that

270
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:08,320
solution okay that is the problem

271
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:10,880
because we cannot be coming we don't

272
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:13,600
have the machine to determine to detect

273
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,600
the amount of

274
00:12:17,279 --> 00:12:21,079
decoction or concoction

275
00:12:31,200 --> 00:12:34,200
so

276
00:12:47,600 --> 00:12:51,360
so you can see now we have put all the

277
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:54,079
material together

278
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:55,760
inside the container okay it is even

279
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:58,480
starting to irritate

280
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,160
i am hearing people are coughing

281
00:12:58,480 --> 00:13:02,320
it means now

282
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,639
our pesticide has started working

283
00:13:02,320 --> 00:13:05,920
it is starting to irritate your throat

284
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,279
and some of you will start shedding

285
00:13:05,920 --> 00:13:10,720
tears okay so now this material is not

286
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:12,320
is more than

287
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:15,360
four five liter okay

288
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:19,639
let us add here ten liter of water

289
00:13:15,360 --> 00:13:19,639
it is very concentrated okay

290
00:13:21,120 --> 00:13:25,519
i told you that

291
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:27,839
this is a serious organic pesticide okay

292
00:13:25,519 --> 00:13:30,320
i can see people are now coughing

293
00:13:27,839 --> 00:13:30,320
it means

294
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:36,800
it means the the pesticide has started

295
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,880
working it is so irritating

296
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:40,480
it is so irritating such that when you

297
00:13:38,880 --> 00:13:42,639
add onto

298
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:45,839
when you apply onto the pest the pest

299
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:45,839
will never survive okay

300
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,839
have you measured water

301
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:54,880
so we are preparing a solution of 10

302
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:57,360
liter okay

303
00:13:54,880 --> 00:14:00,600
a 10 liter solution of organic pesticide

304
00:13:57,360 --> 00:14:00,600
you can form

305
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,720
foreign

306
00:14:36,710 --> 00:14:41,980
[Music]

307
00:14:48,399 --> 00:14:52,720
so we have looked at the final

308
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:54,959
steps

309
00:14:52,720 --> 00:14:58,600
the final step of preparing our organic

310
00:14:54,959 --> 00:14:58,600
pesticide okay

311
00:15:01,850 --> 00:15:15,569
[Music]

312
00:15:16,399 --> 00:15:18,480
