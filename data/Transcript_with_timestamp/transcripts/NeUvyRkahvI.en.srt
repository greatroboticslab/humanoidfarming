reduce frustration and ensure that your

73
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:39,959
system works as intended from the get-go

74
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,080
here's a detailed rundown of what you'll

75
00:02:39,959 --> 00:02:44,640
need to gather before you start first

76
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:46,159
and foremost you'll need solar panels

77
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:48,360
these are the heart of the system

78
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:50,519
converting sunlight into electricity to

79
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:52,519
power the pump the size and number of

80
00:02:50,519 --> 00:02:54,640
panels you need will depend on the size

81
00:02:52,519 --> 00:02:57,000
of your irrigation system and the amount

82
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:58,760
of sunlight you get in your area make

83
00:02:57,000 --> 00:03:00,319
sure to do a bit of research or consult

84
00:02:58,760 --> 00:03:02,879
with a professional to determine the

85
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:04,680
optimal setup for your specific needs

86
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,840
remember the efficiency of your solar

87
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:08,159
panels can vary based on their placement

88
00:03:06,840 --> 00:03:10,239
and the angle at which they are

89
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,799
installed proper positioning can

90
00:03:10,239 --> 00:03:14,280
significantly impact the amount of

91
00:03:11,799 --> 00:03:16,840
energy they generate next up you'll need

92
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:18,519
a solar powered pump this pump will draw

93
00:03:16,840 --> 00:03:21,440
water from your Source whether it's a

94
00:03:18,519 --> 00:03:23,599
well lake or Pond and deliver it to your

95
00:03:21,440 --> 00:03:25,720
crops there are two main types of solar

96
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,120
pumps surface pumps and submersible

97
00:03:25,720 --> 00:03:30,360
pumps each has its own advantages and is

98
00:03:28,120 --> 00:03:32,239
suited for different situations surface

99
00:03:30,360 --> 00:03:34,360
pumps are less expensive and easier to

100
00:03:32,239 --> 00:03:36,799
install but they're not as efficient for

101
00:03:34,360 --> 00:03:38,120
deep Wells they are ideal for shallow

102
00:03:36,799 --> 00:03:40,040
water sources and can be a

103
00:03:38,120 --> 00:03:42,959
cost-effective solution for many small

104
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:44,879
to medium-sized Farms submersible pumps

105
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:46,959
on the other hand are more efficient for

106
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:49,480
deep Wells but they're more expensive

107
00:03:46,959 --> 00:03:50,799
and a bit more complicated to install

108
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:53,000
they are designed to be placed

109
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:55,439
underwater and can handle higher water

110
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:57,920
pressure making them suitable for larger

111
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,360
or deeper water sources you may also

112
00:03:57,920 --> 00:04:01,720
want to consider a battery for your

113
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:04,120
system a battery will store excess

114
00:04:01,720 --> 00:04:06,360
energy generated by the solar panels

115
00:04:04,120 --> 00:04:08,480
allowing you to irrigate your crops even

116
00:04:06,360 --> 00:04:10,560
when the sun isn't shining this is

117
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:12,319
especially useful in areas with cloudy

118
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:14,879
weather or if you need to irrigate at

119
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:16,880
night having a reliable battery backup

120
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,880
can ensure that your irrigation system

121
00:04:16,880 --> 00:04:21,400
remains operational regardless of the

122
00:04:18,880 --> 00:04:23,800
weather conditions of course you'll need

123
00:04:21,400 --> 00:04:26,120
piping or a drip irrigation system to

124
00:04:23,800 --> 00:04:28,000
distribute the water to your crops the

125
00:04:26,120 --> 00:04:30,160
type of piping you choose will depend on

126
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,960
your specific needs and the layout of

127
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:35,080
your farm drip irrigation systems are

128
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,000
highly efficient and can help conserve

129
00:04:35,080 --> 00:04:39,759
water by delivering it directly to the

130
00:04:37,000 --> 00:04:41,840
roots of your plants this method reduces

131
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:43,919
Water waste and ensures that your crops

132
00:04:41,840 --> 00:04:45,680
get the moisture they need and don't

133
00:04:43,919 --> 00:04:47,880
forget about mounting brackets to

134
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,360
securely attach those solar panels

135
00:04:47,880 --> 00:04:51,960
you'll want to choose brackets that are

136
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:53,759
sturdy and can withstand the elements

137
00:04:51,960 --> 00:04:55,800
properly mounted solar panels will not

138
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:57,639
only last longer but will also perform

139
00:04:55,800 --> 00:05:00,280
better as they will be less likely to

140
00:04:57,639 --> 00:05:01,800
shift or get damaged by wind and weather

141
00:05:00,280 --> 00:05:04,880
last but not least you'll need some

142
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:07,400
basic tools such as wrenches screws pipe

143
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:09,440
connectors and a voltmeter having these

144
00:05:07,400 --> 00:05:11,919
tools on hand will make the installation

145
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:13,960
process much easier make sure to double

146
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:15,720
check your toolkit before you start so

147
00:05:13,960 --> 00:05:18,120
you don't have to stop Midway to hunt

148
00:05:15,720 --> 00:05:19,800
for a missing tool a well prepared tool

149
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:22,160
kit can save you a lot of time and

150
00:05:19,800 --> 00:05:23,680
hassle with all these supplies gathered

151
00:05:22,160 --> 00:05:25,880
you're now ready to move on to the

152
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:27,880
installation phase proper preparation

153
00:05:25,880 --> 00:05:29,919
will set you up for success and ensure

154
00:05:27,880 --> 00:05:32,360
that your solar irrigation system runs

155
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:34,280
smoothly and efficiently so take your

156
00:05:32,360 --> 00:05:35,840
time to gather everything you need and

157
00:05:34,280 --> 00:05:37,680
you'll be well on your way to a

158
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:40,120
sustainable and efficient irrigation

159
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,840
system for your garden or Farm now that

160
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:43,479
you have all your gear it's time to find

161
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:45,680
the perfect spot for your solar

162
00:05:43,479 --> 00:05:48,039
irrigation system choosing the right

163
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,039
location is crucial for maximizing the

164
00:05:48,039 --> 00:05:52,400
efficiency of your system and ensuring

165
00:05:50,039 --> 00:05:55,120
its longevity the most important factor

166
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:57,080
to consider is sunlight exposure your

167
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:58,759
solar panels need to be in a spot that

168
00:05:57,080 --> 00:06:01,280
receives direct sunlight for as many

169
00:05:58,759 --> 00:06:03,560
hours of the day as as possible avoid

170
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:06,120
areas that are shaded by trees buildings

171
00:06:03,560 --> 00:06:08,240
or other obstructions the more sunlight

172
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,840
your panels receive the more energy

173
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:12,160
they'll generate and the more

174
00:06:09,840 --> 00:06:14,039
efficiently your system will operate

175
00:06:12,160 --> 00:06:16,280
proximity to your water source is

176
00:06:14,039 --> 00:06:18,479
another important consideration the

177
00:06:16,280 --> 00:06:20,759
closer your pump is to the Water Source

178
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:22,919
the less energy it will require to draw

179
00:06:20,759 --> 00:06:25,400
water this means you can get away with

180
00:06:22,919 --> 00:06:27,639
using smaller less expensive solar

181
00:06:25,400 --> 00:06:29,280
panels in a smaller pump with your

182
00:06:27,639 --> 00:06:31,599
location selected it's time to start

183
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:33,520
setting up your solar panels This is a

184
00:06:31,599 --> 00:06:35,800
critical step as the positioning of your

185
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:38,440
panels directly impacts their energy

186
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,360
production first you'll need to securely

187
00:06:38,440 --> 00:06:42,319
Mount the panels using the brackets you

188
