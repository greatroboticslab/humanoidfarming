1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,879
hey Exiles how we doing Mr a2g back

2
00:00:03,480 --> 00:00:07,000
again playing some more Saga of survival

3
00:00:05,879 --> 00:00:09,120
all right we're going to do something a

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:11,679
little bit uh different today I want to

5
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:14,000
explain as best as I can um about the

6
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:16,760
new adventurers Quest that's come

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,320
through so we only got a little bit

8
00:00:16,760 --> 00:00:20,480
about it in the patch notes saying that

9
00:00:18,320 --> 00:00:23,599
you know every so often on your daily

10
00:00:20,480 --> 00:00:26,679
rewards uh you've got the ability to

11
00:00:23,599 --> 00:00:28,880
claim for you know uh this one here so

12
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:31,840
the adventurer Airship basically it's a

13
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,079
limited time uh zone so we've only got a

14
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,399
certain amount of time to go into the

15
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:37,600
Zone see what it's all about uh fulfill

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:39,760
the quest and then obviously move on

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,480
claim the rewards all that sort of stuff

18
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:43,399
then we've got another one here a little

19
00:00:41,480 --> 00:00:45,480
bit further down on day seven on my end

20
00:00:43,399 --> 00:00:47,719
here whether that matches up with you

21
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:50,600
guys or it's a little bit indifferent um

22
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:52,600
your mileage May differ to mine so I've

23
00:00:50,600 --> 00:00:54,199
already claimed for it and we're going

24
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:55,719
to go ahead and activate that and we're

25
00:00:54,199 --> 00:00:56,879
going to get right into it and we'll see

26
00:00:55,719 --> 00:00:58,800
what it's all about I'll take you

27
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:01,199
through it and hopefully we'll get it

28
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:04,600
wrapped up um pretty soon soon now

29
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:06,760
before you guys go ahead and uh jump on

30
00:01:04,600 --> 00:01:09,200
to the Overworld there to see where it

31
00:01:06,760 --> 00:01:11,400
is you need to claim for it so by doing

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,799
that you need to go into your Vault

33
00:01:11,400 --> 00:01:16,320
scroll down until I've got a lot of

34
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,079
stuff in here by the way um until you

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:22,240
actually find it so you'll find it in a

36
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:24,200
moment's time there we go so you got the

37
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:27,119
Airship Adventure here so you just want

38
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:29,400
to go ahead and claim and let's see if

39
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:32,360
that pops up in our infantry or does it

40
00:01:29,400 --> 00:01:36,280
pop up on the map let's find

41
00:01:32,360 --> 00:01:38,680
out okay so it's there so we go use

42
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:40,159
Limited Time Adventure has begun so I'm

43
00:01:38,680 --> 00:01:42,479
assuming that might be the same thing

44
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:44,600
for the um for the next adventure quest

45
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:46,280
as well uh but for now we'll just roll

46
00:01:44,600 --> 00:01:49,399
with this Adventure Quest and see what

47
00:01:46,280 --> 00:01:52,600
this one's all about it should populate

48
00:01:49,399 --> 00:01:55,600
on our Overworld map there we go so

49
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:57,360
limited time and Adventure a stranger uh

50
00:01:55,600 --> 00:02:01,079

51
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:02,799
sky and AIT go help the pilot

52
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:04,759
well let's go ahead and do that so he's

53
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:07,320
just situated over

54
00:02:04,759 --> 00:02:09,479
here and we'll run in we'll see what

55
00:02:07,320 --> 00:02:11,920
it's all about so it's not a particular

56
00:02:09,479 --> 00:02:14,080
too U too difficult of a zone so one and

57
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:16,000
1 half skulls what I've got here is

58
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,599
completely overpowered for the job um

59
00:02:16,000 --> 00:02:20,280
you know at hand I could even just use

60
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:22,560
my pyro ring that I've got uh stored

61
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:24,000
here I've brought an Axe and a pickaxe

62
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,840
just in case if there's anything that I

63
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:28,440
need to harvest over there and see what

64
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:30,319
we can get um the loot have a look at

65
00:02:28,440 --> 00:02:33,680
the loot table there didn't appear that

66
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:36,040
there was too much out of that so um I

67
00:02:33,680 --> 00:02:37,640
think there was just a little bit of um

68
00:02:36,040 --> 00:02:39,879
basic resources so we'll just quickly go

69
00:02:37,640 --> 00:02:42,599
ahead and have a look at that if I can

70
00:02:39,879 --> 00:02:44,560
ever so tight slightly tap on it so

71
00:02:42,599 --> 00:02:47,480
possible loot we've got a purple star

72
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:50,599
Skillet some oil uh The Amulet the

73
00:02:47,480 --> 00:02:54,000

to find it on one of the Goblins there

91
00:03:34,599 --> 00:03:38,360

just grab one of

130
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:12,360
there and let's see what this area has

131
00:05:09,560 --> 00:05:16,520
we got a couple first

132
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,800

133
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:22,960
take out the goblin completed a quest

134
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:27,280
very good ooh got the little um a little

135
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
scroll there okay we'll s that out in a

136
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:32,800
sec and what's out of here anything

137
00:05:29,960 --> 00:05:35,960
interesting I'll take that o look at

138
00:05:32,800 --> 00:05:40,120
that got the berry

139
00:05:35,960 --> 00:05:42,600
tea if thank you game if you can allow

140
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:44,000
me to actually tap on things that would

141
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,479
be

142
00:05:44,000 --> 00:05:48,840
great um all right what do we got what

143
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:52,759
do we got anything up here don't think

144
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:57,039
so we'll quickly just scan the area

145
00:05:52,759 --> 00:05:59,319
around and anything of Interest not so

146
00:05:57,039 --> 00:06:00,520
much I'll just grab that while we're at

147
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:03,479
it

148
00:06:00,520 --> 00:06:06,919
anything down this way nope dead

149
00:06:03,479 --> 00:06:10,520
end so it doesn't look to be a

150
00:06:06,919 --> 00:06:13,360
particularly uh massive

151
00:06:10,520 --> 00:06:16,000
map we just take out these

152
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:20,080
guys oh okay so these guys are coming up

153
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:22,479
with swamp Okay swamp map section town

154
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:26,479
to piece used to navigate to the swamp

155
00:06:22,479 --> 00:06:29,440
Okay so looks like they might have there

156
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,400
might be a few that we need to check out

157
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:33,479
uh so a few little you know map

158
00:06:31,400 --> 00:06:35,120
coordinates once we've got the required

159
00:06:33,479 --> 00:06:38,680
amount I'm assuming it's going to piece

160
00:06:35,120 --> 00:06:42,039
together and we can uh jump into the uh

161
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:45,919
the swamp uh area and hopefully um we'll

162
00:06:42,039 --> 00:06:47,400
be able to um find uh the lever I take

163
00:06:45,919 --> 00:06:49,639
it in this situation I think that's

164
00:06:47,400 --> 00:06:51,199
probably going to be what we're needing

165
00:06:49,639 --> 00:06:52,960
to look for I'm not going to worry about

166
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,120
the clay at this point I've got so much

167
00:06:52,960 --> 00:06:59,000
clay now ever since this new update

168
00:06:55,120 --> 00:07:00,919
that's dropped I've got so much clay I

169
00:06:59,000 --> 00:07:03,120
it's I'm going to clay bar for days that

170
00:07:00,919 --> 00:07:05,120
that's basically what I'm saying um I'm

171
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,840
not going to need to you know hunt

172
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,840
certain zones or anything like that what

173
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:10,039
problem

174
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:12,960
hey you're a little bit

175
00:07:10,039 --> 00:07:14,400
different and why didn't I kill you in

176
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,759
the first

177
00:07:14,400 --> 00:07:19,400
place take all

178
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:21,000
that and what have we got here nothing

179
00:07:19,400 --> 00:07:23,800
there nothing

180
00:07:21,000 --> 00:07:26,240
there um I wonder if that's

181
00:07:23,800 --> 00:07:28,479
enough I wonder if that is

182
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:30,800
enough well that's a point of Interest

183
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:33,479
by the looks of things just want to see

184
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,000
okay I did Kill everything

185
00:07:33,479 --> 00:07:39,639
there

186
00:07:35,000 --> 00:07:41,599
okay oh okay so I've got all three

187
00:07:39,639 --> 00:07:43,720
claim

188
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:45,639
nice and assuming that's going to take

189
00:07:43,720 --> 00:07:47,560
us to the swap which it does nice and

190
00:07:45,639 --> 00:07:49,879
easy there we

191
00:07:47,560 --> 00:07:52,759
go and that will probably take us back

192
00:07:49,879 --> 00:07:57,240
to where we came from let's take out

193
00:07:52,759 --> 00:07:59,199
these guys I hate these things they they

194
00:07:57,240 --> 00:08:00,879
put they put your curse points so high

195
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:03,120
up

196
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,520
cuz now if you look at the left hand uh

197
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:07,039
part of the screen where my avatar is uh

198
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:08,800
you'll notice that I've got curse points

199
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:11,280
times three so you just want to be

200
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:15,360
careful with

201
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:20,360
that and I'll just grab all of

202
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:21,960
this so this is um so little drop um you

203
00:08:20,360 --> 00:08:24,680
know little chest and things like that

204
00:08:21,960 --> 00:08:25,879
kind of like in the the two skull zones

205
00:08:24,680 --> 00:08:28,319
that you'll

206
00:08:25,879 --> 00:08:30,360
find so you might get like little gifts

207
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:33,120
and things like that

208
00:08:30,360 --> 00:08:35,440
raw materials whatever it might be

209
00:08:33,120 --> 00:08:37,839
so all right let's see what we got out

210
00:08:35,440 --> 00:08:42,120
of this one

211
00:08:37,839 --> 00:08:42,120
rets get rid of that mosquito

212
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:46,480
bed and there's another one there I'm

213
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:47,760
just going to go ahead and hit it I'm

214
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:49,040
it's annoying that they don't come up

215
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
actually on the map so you can't

216
00:08:49,040 --> 00:08:52,480
actually see them but I guess that's the

217
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,600
whole point of it you know you got to be

218
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:58,680
careful you have your wits about

219
00:08:55,600 --> 00:09:02,600
you okay there's that hot bed take that

220
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:05,200

221
00:09:02,600 --> 00:09:06,480
see what's in the barrel here and

222
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,800
hopefully we might find what we're

223
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:10,760
looking

224
00:09:07,800 --> 00:09:13,200
for I'll take those

225
00:09:10,760 --> 00:09:14,720

229
00:09:20,720 --> 00:09:26,399
that I may not need probably that that

230
00:09:24,600 --> 00:09:28,360
and there's

231
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:30,839

00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:35,240
even need that today

233
00:09:30,839 --> 00:09:38,880

guys drop

260
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:54,079
rope okay well that's back to where we

261
00:10:52,680 --> 00:10:55,800
came from there was a little section

262
00:10:54,079 --> 00:10:57,519
there I didn't cover so we'll go through

263
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:01,639
there

264
00:10:57,519 --> 00:11:01,639
now and I didn't see that that

265
00:11:04,279 --> 00:11:10,399
okay so a bit of charcoal Goblin leader

266
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:13,800
do you have my leather uh lever

267
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:15,959
lever I don't know why I said leather

268
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:18,399
anyway H it's too early in the morning

269
00:11:15,959 --> 00:11:23,000
my time here

270
00:11:18,399 --> 00:11:23,000
guys take the nails I do need the nails

271
00:11:26,639 --> 00:11:34,200
actually and one more J there we go

272
00:11:31,200 --> 00:11:38,200
take out you and I think that did say

273
00:11:34,200 --> 00:11:41,040
swamp Goblin it did okay so

274
00:11:38,200 --> 00:11:42,320
hopefully okay I think I've noticed that

275
00:11:41,040 --> 00:11:44,279
in the update let me know if you guys

276
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,720
did where your character didn't actually

277
00:11:44,279 --> 00:11:47,959
you didn't see the

278
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,480
animation uh to him actually attacking

279
00:11:47,959 --> 00:11:52,920
but yet you'd actually see the enemy

280
00:11:50,480 --> 00:11:54,360
health bar reduced yeah let me know if

281
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,880
you'd actually seen that or if you've

282
00:11:54,360 --> 00:11:59,880
experienced

283
00:11:56,880 --> 00:12:01,240
that okay well see now he's doing it

284
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:02,920
actually another thing to note as well

285
00:12:01,240 --> 00:12:06,600
just using my crossbow I feel that it's

286
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:09,720
a lot slower than um in the previous uh

287
00:12:06,600 --> 00:12:11,399
update o dark swamp Goblin okay you're

288
00:12:09,720 --> 00:12:14,360
going to have to have what I

289
00:12:11,399 --> 00:12:17,199
need just take out that hot

290
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:19,600
bed let's take out the other hot bed I

291
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:23,880
just want to take that out yeah so I

292
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:25,480
think the time delay is a lot more on

293
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:27,800
the crossbow than it was in the previous

294
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:29,240
update I don't know if it's just me I

295
00:12:27,800 --> 00:12:30,959
don't know if you guys have experienced

296
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:33,600
that too I want you to let me know in

297
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:36,720
the comments down

298
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:39,160
below yes okay cool so you've got what I

299
00:12:36,720 --> 00:12:41,079
need I don't need that I'm going to grab

300
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,079
that I don't need any of that I'll just

301
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:45,040
leave that

302
00:12:42,079 --> 00:12:46,959
behind loot up the chest and I think

303
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,760
that's probably going to go ahead and

304
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:51,320
call it I guess we well you know I'll

305
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,920
see what else is need I think we need

306
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:56,240
some raw meat which I didn't get from

307
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:59,920
this Z so I know I've got that at home

308
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:04,160
which is not a problem at all

309
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:09,440
okay um what do I give

310
00:13:04,160 --> 00:13:12,920
up I guess I'll use that take

311
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:15,959
that use that and take that there we

312
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,600
go and we did loot that didn't we yeah

313
00:13:15,959 --> 00:13:21,760
we did okay so I think that's it we'll

314
00:13:19,600 --> 00:13:24,720
go sus out

315
00:13:21,760 --> 00:13:26,839
now the rest of

316
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:29,880
everything actually I think I I think I

317
00:13:26,839 --> 00:13:32,560
do definitely need some meat so let's

318
00:13:29,880 --> 00:13:36,199
let's quickly go back home I'll grab the

319
00:13:32,560 --> 00:13:36,199
meat cuz I think that's all I

320
00:13:36,920 --> 00:13:43,279
need and we'll um yeah we'll finish off

321
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,279
this quest for the um for today's

322
00:13:44,440 --> 00:13:49,639
video okay sorry I just had a bit of

323
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:59,000
coffee and let's jump back

324
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:59,000
in go

325
00:14:00,279 --> 00:14:06,199
and you know what for now I just might

326
00:14:01,720 --> 00:14:06,199
dump some of that over here and

327
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:12,000
there and let's just grab the meat I

328
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:15,040
think that's it honestly I think that is

329
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:15,040
but we'll have a

330
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:20,880
look don't want to make a you know

331
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:23,320
complete round trip for everything

332
00:14:20,880 --> 00:14:25,240
so it's a good little Quest I mean you

333
00:14:23,320 --> 00:14:27,279
know just something to break up uh the

334
00:14:25,240 --> 00:14:29,480
norm the mold if you will gives you

335
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:31,079
something uh to do and you got a decent

336
00:14:29,480 --> 00:14:33,320
amount of time so I don't see why not

337
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:35,720
that you guys couldn't complete it um

338
00:14:33,320 --> 00:14:37,120
you should be able to it it's it appears

339
00:14:35,720 --> 00:14:39,759
very easy I don't know what it's going

340
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:41,839
to be for the next um for the next

341
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:43,160
mission um that we'll have but we'll

342
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:45,720
we'll obviously work it out when the

343
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,519
time comes all right so let's go ahead

344
00:14:45,720 --> 00:14:53,800
and claim everything so we need that

345
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:57,480
that that that that and that

346
00:14:53,800 --> 00:15:01,040
claim that's it that's it so he's not

347
00:14:57,480 --> 00:15:03,519
going to so we can't interact with him

348
00:15:01,040 --> 00:15:05,720
anymore um as I said we've only got a

349
00:15:03,519 --> 00:15:09,240
day a little bit over a day for that to

350
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:12,480
um for this Zone to leave but let's go

351
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:15,800
ahead and check out the the skillet pan

352
00:15:12,480 --> 00:15:20,360
going to swap them over so we have 20

353
00:15:15,800 --> 00:15:25,079
attack damage 16 wall uh 32 awareness

354
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:28,120
1.2 oh sorry um yeah and then over 500

355
00:15:25,079 --> 00:15:29,480
uh hit points on it which is not bad you

356
00:15:28,120 --> 00:15:33,480
know what I think this probably be

357
00:15:29,480 --> 00:15:36,000
arguably a decent um uh melee weapon

358
00:15:33,480 --> 00:15:37,440
just for you know one to two skull zones

359
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:39,199
if you really wanted to use it and you

360
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:40,880
don't want to use any decent weapons or

361
00:15:39,199 --> 00:15:43,160
anything like that I think this would be

362
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:44,560
your go-to um if you want to sort of you

363
00:15:43,160 --> 00:15:47,199
know keep it and retain it you probably

364
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:48,480
just want to invest in some uh repair

365
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,680
hammers just to get it back up to

366
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:52,519
scratch that's obviously up to you guys

367
00:15:50,680 --> 00:15:53,680
but that's what I'm thinking about that

368
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:55,920
it's probably going to be a decent

369
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,519
Handler for um for those type of zones

370
00:15:55,920 --> 00:15:58,800

00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:00,480

372
00:15:58,800 --> 00:16:03,800
one just wanted to give you a quick

overview on how that works and um yeah

374
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:07,319
shed some lot because unfortunately in

375
00:16:05,800 --> 00:16:09,079
the patch notes of the developers didn't

376
00:16:07,319 --> 00:16:11,560
