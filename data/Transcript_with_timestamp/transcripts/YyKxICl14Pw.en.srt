1
00:00:06,040 --> 00:00:10,360
in this particular pond we have another

2
00:00:08,200 --> 00:00:12,519
incredible function happening here in

3
00:00:10,360 --> 00:00:15,100
the food forest which is that by turning

4
00:00:12,519 --> 00:00:17,980
a simple valve I can actually flood

5
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:19,960
irrigate systems in this food forest

6
00:00:17,980 --> 00:00:22,270
that will water trees and plants with

7
00:00:19,960 --> 00:00:24,690
this fertile pond water full of

8
00:00:22,270 --> 00:00:29,020
beneficial microorganisms bacteria

9
00:00:24,690 --> 00:00:30,699
nutrients from from the fish from d'être

10
00:00:29,020 --> 00:00:33,730
this which is decomposing plant matter

11
00:00:30,699 --> 00:00:35,320
that that falls to the bottom of the

12
00:00:33,730 --> 00:00:37,449
pond water and gets munched by all the

13
00:00:35,320 --> 00:00:38,199
microorganisms so you have this alive

14
00:00:37,449 --> 00:00:40,300
water

15
00:00:38,199 --> 00:00:42,010
we're actually fertilizing the entire

16
00:00:40,300 --> 00:00:44,729
food forest at the same time that we're

17
00:00:42,010 --> 00:00:44,729
irrigating it
