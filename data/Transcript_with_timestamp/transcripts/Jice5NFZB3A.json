  "text": "[Music] [Music] so [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] do [Music] [Music] [Music] good evening welcome to the private property farming podcast my name is imbalanco and i'm your host every tuesdays and thursdays uh thank you so much for watching us this evening and we've got another amazing show all about traditional farming methods for crop rotation so if you're looking for a number of ways to rotate your crop um and obviously smart ways that that's to ensure that you increase your yields um and that you form just you know um using the maximum amount of space that you have in your land and farming efficiently with different crops then i think this show is for you and tonight we are joined by lofty smiths who is the founder who's pretty much a farmer and founder of the friendly butchery um and we're going to talk about crop rotation traditional farming methods and a bit about his enterprise and how he started and how he's grown his business till date luffy thank you so much for joining us how are you doing i'm i'm fine bali it's it's a pleasure you know to have you and uh yeah let's get going awesome awesome so lofi tell us about your farming journey um when did you start farming are you a second third fourth generation farmer and give us more insight around the friendly butchery [Music] it's it's uh my father bought the farm around about 89 but i grew up in a farm which is basically next door to the farm that i'm on and i was born there and grew up and so on so i've been in the farming business for many years and then i started farming in 1996 with farm from my father and then i you know uh we were still in the culture [Music] five years and a few very funny years where we had you know a lot of crop losses due to heat waves during the the flight of wheat i started realizing you know we got to do something we got to change our methods and ways of farming and that's when i started doing uh going from a mona culture i went over to i went and i started doing medics medics is clovers where i do the clovers in the one year and the following year i will do the wheat on the specific same land so i went on a rotation and and it's been brilliant it has been it's been yes it happened to me because it's nice thing about the mix is it's it's nitrogen fixing and um and you can carry so many animals on on a hectare i mean i have dormers you know which originate from elsa moon it's a meat nice mutton and i run i can run four twin dorma u's meaning four u's with twins on a hectare and it's it's just amazing i mean the the quality of sheep that comes out of there the within 100 days i have my lambs market ready off medics from their mother so you know basically in a hundred days you know it's a lifesaver and because of that um because i was running the sheep with such good success you know on the medics um i started thinking my self you know it's it's a match you know in the in the supermarkets and it's always been just you know dream of mine to start my own butchery and then two years ago about two and a half years ago i i got to the point where i applied for a license and we started the friendly farmer butchery and it's and it's absolutely amazing my wife does all the admin i'm the block man and it's it's just amazing it's just picked up and i've gone with it and i was very fortunate that my my late mother she's from the area uh richmond area where she grew up and always as a kid you know when whenever we would meet i i used to go and help her and she showed me hell of a lot and um i'm actually using sort of all my recipes and so on as you know from my late mother's so you know something something special and i really i it's been it's been a long time coming that i wanted to start a book sharing and like i said two and a half years ago we got going and we do deliveries we don't have any on the farm um shop where you can come and buy due to security reasons and so on you know and uh so we do the we we do the deliveries um we do tape down uh we do balls and uh yeah it's been it's been wonderful it really has been good i certainly saw a hell of a change in my soil after going with the medics it's amazing how much life returned to the soil and also with with this change that we made we went into uh we started doing um we got planters where we use the shank so we we try and do minimum disturbance of the soil to try and keep as much moisture as well when we are doing the week here like i said the one years we the next year we have medics the next year we have wheat again and i also do other rotation crops as well i i use oats i do a lot of oats and some oats we do for otay the other oats you know i'm at the moment i'm actually busy harvesting oats for seed you know for for for the co-operandia and uh and getting a very good yield but it's important to um kernels in your in your oats so it's very important that's why i'm doing oats at the moment also we have now the last four years we've started with um uh regenerative farming where we take our swell and and we started doing cover crops you know obviously you know my medics is is of such nice quality and it's it's it grows you know in abundance you know however nicely so that to me is also a cover crop because in the summer and when the medics goes down and goes and lies down my my soil is basically covered you know and and we do we also bring it in other cover crops we do a little bit of this that the medics can also come through and and you know leave it spurs and everything and and i'll find it absolutely amazing it was incredible it started getting its own life how the earthworms came in and started burrowing and i always say to the people whenever i walk they always say look at this look at this earthworm life because those are my plans those are my is what what is you know doing the thing and and i think i personally that's the way i've gone and i'm i'm on a rate of of 38 are going in at about 110 kilograms of nitrogen on their wheatlands you know so yeah i mean that's something is very easy like you know you can just see what you know what lies in it and i've in fact just finished harvesting my week for this year and it was an amazing crop i must i must say that for the last six years we've really had tough times so we've had chance last year wasn't too bad but we had a bit of of the frost you know during the flowering season but the last six years was really it was tough but this year was amazing and i'm i'm sorry that's great i'm happy for you but stop me if i talk too much no it's okay i mean we want information right and um my question then is you know it sounds like you've you know dabbled a bit in a number of different crops you know for the purpose of crop rotation and when you're going through these processes as a farmer you know um who are the people that you'd sit down and talk to to assist you to say like who made made you say uh now you need the specific crop to rotate with weed wheat for example sorry um and um how did you come about doing that research you know um so just in case maybe people in the audience are thinking yes i wanna do crop rotation but i don't know what to rotate my crops with so how do you find a good companionship with the kind of crops that you're farming which first of all was wheat um so that you could you know rotate and obviously grow your enterprise so at what point did you make that decision and who are the type of people did you liaise with to maybe see if this idea would work or not yeah um here in the western coast you know i always say in the area that you that you are farming you know it's very what do they do there is a success right and the agriculture the western agricultural union that they have a very close to us about 30-40 kilometers away they've got a a farm there where from elsenberg they they do a whole lot of um trials you know doing basically canola doing loop and doing oats doing the medics different variety of medics and then the rotational crop and then you have companies like agricult and you have barrenburg you know that come and they do it on this um on this farm that is that is owned by the the western cape agriculture from elsenberg and and and they all do their little trials there and all different type of trials you know and then what they also do is and it's and it's it's um it's called this uh it's normally in september beginning of september they have a and the farmers day everybody's interested comes along and we have a look what are the varieties that are doing good what you know what what should you do next year for your area which is which to me that that's that's basically where we you learn a lot of things you know because you can see what happens and i think that's the important thing about it also i have a company that i do you know the guy helps me with my fertilizer and you know what to do and so on um you know and i think i think that's the biggest thing of all you must minimize your risk by going in with the least inset but the best outside you know and the best quality and i think that is very important and quite honest with you i think there's a little bit of a you know if you if you if you see the the quality of wheat that we get from from our medic system you know uh we and we specifically i also do um my model that is is um i try and do biological farming with my fertilizer where i use a chicken and and then of course nitrogen and it's all in the little fertilizer little little chicken you know manure pool they they do it in a pool form and then we sew but to me the big disappointment is that as a farmer i don't get because the quality of wheat that produce doing farming you know from the malayan i think that's but i i think it's something that's that's that's going to happen soon you know where when people are now starting move the quality of wheat that they get as to other wheat that has for instance you know had a lot of nitrogen and so on i mean it's just a better quality you know yeah so hopefully that's and and also and also we uh you know we we we in dire straits for next year you know with the first so unbelievably high so fortunately you know i'm on my system of farming where i go with the low insets and i just bring my wrist down and and and that i do my friends uh this friend of mine who you know who who does my fertilizer and then of course you know we use pesticides we have to um and then i try and lay away from things like ronda i try i don't always but i try my best you know to to to sort of keep that out of my system yeah yeah you know typically traditional farming is uh sorry to interject there typically traditional farming is um you know heavily reliant on pesticides and chemicals and fertilizers and it sounds like you've obviously adopted like a biological approach as you've said do you think that you've seen a significant amount of um operational reduction in terms of the expenses that you would have ordinarily paid for when if you had gone you know the traditional farming methods now that you've adopted a more of a regenerative farming or biological approach as you've put it so do you think that with going with a different approach maybe deviating a slightly from traditional farming methods to rather care more for your soil have you seen a a change in your business operational expenses where they have reduced perhaps yeah yeah definitely i mean without a doubt i mean my diesel my you know my fuel account i think has been halved from what it used to be you know and um my fertilizer i mean they used to build in here with you know full of fertilizer i have one truck of city city tons that comes in and does my and and and this is amazing you know it's you know from from those years to now i would say i think there was a reduction of about close on to 40 percent in usage of of of fuel and fertilizer definitely yeah yeah one thing from your from your experience causes the shift for farmers just to think slightly differently from traditional farming practices is it things that happen in the economy or you know like high fuel prices or high input cost prices or is it because maybe over the years farmers are starting to become uh thinking yes definitely much more long-term to say how do i preserve my soil and therefore how do i find companion plants to to ensure that my soil you know could last generations to come if i'm still you know producing in this one specific uh farm or piece of land so what do you think causes the farmers to make that shift um you know to to to to to to focus a lot more on the production practices is it the economy is it the the push from high input costs or is it just do you think that farmers are becoming slightly more conservative rather um um with regards to the environment etc and you know people are starting to just make certain changes yeah molly um i think the the thing that is really hitting home now is is is the weather you know yeah it's been amazing the last five six years to see what global warming and and i believe in global warming i have experienced it myself [Music] we have a september month it's very very important that's when just after the week's flight and it's it it's little it's a little grey you know it must get was set now and and we just haven't had september months we we just don't have rain in september again yeah you know lately and and i put it on to global warming and global warming has made it that you must absolutely at all cost you must try and preserve as much moisture in the ground as possible that means you don't open the up you don't open it up you must turn your will as little as possible and i think that together with the cost of insect costs and everything as really i think um for me that was my game changer because i i just i just thought to myself i just thought my own eyes that if i wasn't going to make a change i wasn't going to be on the farm for very long so that is what i did and i go with the lowest insets as as possible and and at the end of the day that is what it's about you know making a profit and um yeah and that's what's changed and incidentally you know what really changed my my mind as well i can remember um you know when you when you drive along the fence you don't on the fence this is like a half a meter this side half of me to that side that you you never work there and everything that grows on next to the fence you know it's always looks lush and if there's a little weak kernel that falls there or a medic it grows with so much power and why it gets disturbed you understand and that is why i say i try and just as little as possible i don't burn my lands a lot of people still around here they burn the stubble because they're doing the murder culture culture the writings to take place that's why they got to put on like closer than 100 kilograms of nitrogen whereas i go i don't burn it at all i don't disturb it because my material must go into my swell and that's the only way that you're going to get your carbon and one content in your soil goes up then the penetration of water is so much better for the soil and that's what what what set me going i think all those things together you know yeah yeah my last question for you this evening luffy is um you know you've mentioned monoculture right and um for anybody listening and thinking wow there's monocots culture and this crop rotation and you're farming weeds you're farming medics you're farming something else um in between that um all for the purpose of crop rotation is it fair to say that the crop rotation practices and methods become slightly more expensive as opposed to monoculture because in monoculture you're controlling expenses you know year after year you're farming a single crop where you can control your expenses control your input costs whereas crop rotation each crop requires something different and it could be different fertilizers etc so is it true maybe to uh to think that maybe crop rotation um will be slightly more expensive than monoculture or does it not make a difference at all no no not at all especially what i'm doing with my medics you know my clovis what i started um because because i let the clover develop the first year the second year it gets wet the third year when it's clover again you know it comes up naturally in the winter so it's a once off it's a once or thin it's quite expensive the seed because everything comes from australia you know and so it's quite expensive to start off with one sort you look after your your phosphate flux on which which you correct in the in the year of the wheat you know where you put your phosphates down and so on and and and if your ph is fine then it's a once off thing and it's just there every second year you have this most amazing medics you know that you can either harvest or you can use it for for your animals to graze on oats oats to me is is also a very very nice rotation crop oats have an amazing root system which i think it's it's it's conducive to i think magnesium gets you know put into the swell which takes a lot of the i don't know what the english word is for all of them which is amazing i i like to do the the japanese radish it's it's like a whole radish a huge and it breaks up your soil you know so so if you have compact swellings on and you do the radish it breaks the swell it is it it's like a it's like a twine you know that you when you when you plot it it sort of does the same thing it loosens up your swell that's also very nice and then lupins i i i forgot to tell you about lupine's lupines also it's got a nice pen root so it also penetrates that swell you know so it loosens the soil and it's also a nitrogen fixing you know which your following yeah you know you can cut back on your nitrogen application to your wheat and uh yeah that's it and what is it what is amazing is yeah i wish i would just one more thing i wish you could see this the sheep on the medic now it's amazing how the man i think that the nice crust that they have on their legs nice thick bone structures and everything it's just to me it's the best thing off the sliced bread and and really i i enjoy because then you know your lifestyle can definitely benefit from it and your butchery can also benefit from it and that i like the fact that at every process you keep adding certain value into your production and into your agribusiness but thank you so much for your time this evening luffy um it was great chatting to you and i just want to say to the audience just uh you know uh apologies for the um this connection here and there when you was when when lawful was speaking you know connection is not always the greatest at farms but yeah uh lofty thank you for obviously bringing that wisdom and various crop advices in terms of rotation and different um crops that one could use obviously um to obviously improve the the the texture of the soil to prove the composition of the soil nitrogen etc so yeah thank you for coming on to the show this evening and all the best for your farming as well i hope all goes well there and i hope i hope the rain comes eh yeah okay good thank you so much hey okay you definitely need the rain if you miss this conversation we're just speaking to luffy smiths from the friendly farmer butchery um he's a farmer in the western cape and we're speaking about traditional farming methods that one can adopt for the purpose of crop rotation and luffy informed us that he's a weed farmer but also has you know dabbled a bit to medics in clover and also gave us some gems about you know planting radishes to improve your soil and what it is it does to your soil um from farming and all these have obviously created a great impact in his business because he has now reduced his input costs um and also we all i think just trying to win it where climate change is where climate change is concerned as farmers so if you miss this conversation you can catch it on the private property youtube channel under the farming podcast playlist if you have any questions please feel free to drop them into the comment section and we'll answer them to the best of our abilities as well um and yeah keep supporting the podcast thank you so much for tuning in this evening i will catch you on thursday at 8 o'clock take care [Music] [Music] me me [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you",
