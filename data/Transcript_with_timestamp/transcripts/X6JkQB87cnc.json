  "text": "say our screen presentation effectively yes we see it okay very good so uh yeah so I'm Jason and uh I have been working in Vietnam since 2006 uh in collaboration with friends at Kanto University uh have worked there on a range of different basically soil related projects um but firstly with ACR there on a rice shrimp project looking at sustainability of the right shrimp system uh and then that led on to what we call the focus project which is farmer options for crops under saline conditions uh and with me uh I have uh Brooke who who is post-doc on that project so hi everyone I also have worked in vet um for a while but started in 2015 as part of my undergraduate and I have progressed through after getting my PhD and now work full-time on this Focus project and um interested in soil plants sort of microbial interactions so it's a great great space to explore this but yeah so uh yeah the project is funded by Asia and uh and uh it's LED in Australia by us at Charles State University and our um in-country lead is um Kento University so um just as a brief intro because the delta in Vietnam is hugely important to the country uh it's about 12 of the area um very flat area and so it is all pretty much less than four meters above sea level except for a few Hills or the locals called mountains um but yeah so a lot of it's a lot of it's even less than two meters above sea level agriculture is hugely important to the economy in in the Delta um with 80 uh of the of the jobs associated with agriculture in some way and the Delta produces over 50 of the country's rice um production and a lot of that is exported as well so the economic value is is quite large so um the foodball food bowl of Vietnam is the Delta however um over the recent years there's been competition for the water that's coming down through the Mekong River so with Upstream water use uh and damming we've had due to climate change uh drought is a lot more uh regular now and even the rainfall patterns have been disrupted so so 10 years ago the dry and wet season were very set whereas now they're they're quite variable and unpredictable which causes problems of course to the farming the cropping systems sea level rise is an issue um being close to the equator and and so the seawater eyes has been recorded as being about 12 to 14 millimeters per year and of course as the sea water rises the salt water starts coming up through the canal and river system and so um in this diagram in the map here you can see that there's lines that show the extent of salinity coming through um into the Delta Inland up Upstream up canals and salinizing the land and so you can kind of see there in 2010 you know and it's around the coastal areas or pericosal areas 2016 was a rather large drought uh effect and salinity really started to impact rice crops and farmers were were in a lot of trouble because they they never experienced this before in some areas because it had moved so far inland and you can see there in 2020 it happened again and even further in some areas and so you literally have a situation where people who have been able to farm a certain way for decades all of a sudden uh were starting to be impacted by this sea water rise on the salt water intrusion coming up the canal system and of course their response once that happened was okay I can't irrigate from the river anymore because it's saline so old groundwater pump instead and of course removing water from a Delta system uh makes the land subsidence worse and so whilst the sea water rise is that 12 to 14 millimeters per year land subsidence is around 40 millimeters per year and so the net effect of that of course is around 50 mils millimeters a year in a system where you are two meters above sea level so that's like that's pretty that's a bad situation and that's the situation that we're working in and of course the problem is that um that salinity and the effect of the drought uh basically you have hundreds of thousands of hectares impacted by by salt and by lack of water and you have all that loss of production uh loss of fun farm income and impact on communities rural communities so that's our problem and of course this the worst of this situation the the worst of the saltwater intrusion and the drought uh occurs in the dry season so in in a lot of areas through the Delta they'll grow three crops of rice a year and and our problem is largely in this early dry season uh situation and so uh it's this third rice crop that gets often will get killed by the salinity but even in areas where they grow two rice crops they stretch that out such that that second rice crop is still susceptible uh in some years to to impact spice salt so our what we're looking at is alternatives to rice in this dry season period uh and the the farmers that that we work with and the the darts of the Department Of Agricultural and rural development government agencies that we work with they all say you can teach us to grow new crops we can use new soil techniques uh but the the crop has to be valuable we have to it has to have a stronger market value than rice because we can grow more rice and the farmers will still be poor so the alternative has to be has to be a marketable profitable crop and so we focus on that as well so in looking at these alternative crops um we look at the crop but also the soil management and the agricultural management of the field to to be able to grow those crops so we've kind of got the biophysical the the crop the selection of the crop species and also variety and then the soil management that supports that that that crop and that sort of thing Brook will go into more detail but we're talking about raised beds to minimize the effects of of water logging mulches to minimize evaporation and decrease the effects of salinity for example uh and then of course there's nutrition on top of that uh we are looking at the socioeconomic value chain sort of market analysis so you know if we grow these crops is there a market for them what are those markets what are the barriers to adoption of those crops within the supply chain uh so we're examining those within the project we need to have a really good understanding of how salinity of the soil and the waterways changes through time and space and so uh if you look through the literature and online you'll see maps of the Delta that change that show salinity but often they're created by monitoring points in the waterways and not actually measuring salt in soil or salinity in soil and so we're looking at doing that um you know by a range of different mechanisms and so we have a team of people who actually measure salinity in soil and also the waterways but we also are doing it with remote sensing as well because we have a really strong GIS team that's capable of doing that sort of stuff for us and so the value of doing that is we we can understand what can we grow where can we grow it in under what conditions and then with that spatial temporal mapping we actually can match up where you're going to get a large enough scale of land to support those new crops to maybe then inform government to say look you can support Private Industry here or change policy to to create incentives for businesses to come in and fill this nice part of the supply chain to enable uh uptake of this alternative crop and give it a value um and then the fourth part is we're looking at um the role of gender in the whole process from uh knowledge Creation in the research team through to the extension to Growers the uptake on farm and also within Supply chains as well um understanding that it's a really rapidly moving space and often that impacts genders differently and so we need to just understand what we're dealing with there and and how can we help offset some of the changes that are going to be occurring cool so for the purpose of this presentation we'll focus on the biophysical aspect of the project and that comes down to looking at alternative crops to Rice to suit this dry season period so when we first started out we had to make a criteria that we could identify crops that could be suitable uh to start with it was saline tolerant crops so obviously towards the end of the dry season the saline intrusion is is really gets quite high and soil salinization is the worst during that later reproductive phase so salt tolerant crops that can grow and reproduce and then create a profitable yield was a criteria we looked at what are you sufficient crops or crops that used lower amounts of water to complete their life cycle was something that was really important you can get crops that are salt tolerant but use a lot of water and in a system where there's fresh water scarcity it's just not suitable um there's a risk there's a higher risk of failure we also needed crops that could fit the climates of the Mekong Delta in that dry season the temperatures can get to 35 degrees we get these variable very low rainfall patterns you're relying on irrigation so these sort of crops that fit there not not a crop that's a cold tolerant sort of crop they had to be able to work in with the available labor that exists in these small holder Farms there are some crops that can fit both the salt tolerant and water use efficient criteria but require great amounts of manual labor and that just doesn't work in the system so finding something that we can adapt with the available mechanization and tools available to Farmers and most of all as as Jason said it had to be something that is profitable at the end of the day for the farmers because they need a yield to sell at Market um otherwise there's there's no point in investing in this so we sort of based um uh our crop selection of these criteria came up with a few different um species to test and understanding that this there's there will always be more species we can't test them all but we can look at the adoption protocols and practices of how that occurs so we um did a range of glass house and Greenhouse trials both in Australia and Vietnam and these helped us sort of work out um the salinity and drought or water use screening of different species as well as once we identified species the varieties available in Vietnam that could be best suited to those perhaps different spatial areas there may be areas that are sale unaffected but has lots of water and there are varieties that suit that alternatively there are areas of the Delta that have less saline intrusion but water is an issue so you sort of suit varieties to those areas we also yes did water use efficiency sort of screening and through all of those we did things like measuring plant and soil parameters um lots of different relief indexes prolens yields biomasses Roots nodules all those sorts of things from here the range of trials that we did it helped us establish what we could use in the field and so some of the crops we've trialled cow pee there's a legume beetroot watermelon Maize quinoa we've we've done a range of different crops and we utilize the information from The Glass House and Greenhouse trials and to work out where they are best suited in the delta we have trials across uh it's a transect across the Delta starting in sock Trang which is quite close to the coast where saline intrusion is the worst all the way up to Ang Yang where it's a broader scale cropping systems freshwater scarcity is more of an issue rather than saline intrusion so there's an adoption of different species there we have these dry season trials and then it goes back into rice cropping after we're finished and we are looking at both the performance of our alternative species and then things like the impacts of that on Rice afterwards as well as you know different varieties where they suit where they're best located so with those field trials we've got the species that we've selected but we've also looked at different management practices that we can use to enhance the and optimize the growth of these alternative crops the we use a soil monitoring moisture device called chameleon soil moisture sensors and these are australian-made and I'll go into detail in the next slide but we help farmers understand irrigation schedules they're familiar with growing rice which is obviously flood irrigation these Upland crops different water requirements we can make more efficient water decisions and so we're using these tools to test those thresholds there uh rice straw mulching um different mulching trials we're doing rate trials combinations with things like compost and biochar um chameleons so monitoring irrigation with mulch so it's just integrating these different management practices in things like raised beds as you can see in one of the pictures up the top there so chameleons are a pretty cool device they are developed originally by csiro in Australia and now they're sold through the virtual irrigation company Academy which is a non-for-profit organization they measure soil moisture through soil tension and the beauty about this is rather than interpreting um something that could be complex to a farmer is in a reading in kilopascals it comes up with a traffic light system to indicate the level of soil moisture that's there and this makes it really easy to use it provides real-time data back to the farmer and it's relatively cheap compared to things like tensiometers uh they are however limited by um quite high levels of salinity and where working to see where those sort of thresholds exist and how they fit in with our system so the traffic light system just very quickly blue is um it's been calibrated to mean you've got a soil tension between zero and minus 22 kilobasicals so your soil is essentially wet you don't need to irrigate it brain is moist and once a farmer sees the red lights come up they know they have to irrigate you can have a multiple different layers so that each light corresponds to its own sensor and that sensor can be put at different depths so you could have zero to five five to ten ten to Fifteen centimeters or we use them spatially because we've got shallow rooted species we might use them between treatments to determine what irrigation is happening there so it's just it's a really useful tool for Farmer engagement and as an educational tool but also a research tool for us so um there is a chameleon card version which is a cheaper um method of it but it doesn't log data like the Wi-Fi one does so you can see a farmer here um in Vietnam I think the video will play the lights flashing so he attaches the wire and then it will indicate I think a green light there so hopefully he doesn't go and irrigate that crop but um yeah super super easy to use so that's what we're sort of um utilizing in our field trials yeah and without without that intervention the the farmer Behavior that's been observed is they irrigate every day because they think they have to and they've got no other information to say that they that's not a good idea but we've used The Chameleons to show to demonstrate that actually you don't need to irrigate every day yeah so when um this is just an example of sort of a field trial experiment we've got set up and we have what we would call the Pharma practice which is that irrigating every day or whatever they perceive as their ideal irrigation and and what we've found is it is follow something along the lines of what they would do with rice and then we compare that to our treatments of a chameleon with no straw and then various rates of straw mulch to see what water savings we can get and it's been we've done this over a few years now and the results are really consistent and exciting we have found Enzo um we'll report uh beetroot or red beets whatever you'd like to call it um this is just some from a recent trial that we did and along the y-axis you can see the water applied so that's how much water over the growing season that um this trial used and we used farmers in there so we're engaging the farmers in the field trials and getting sort of buying there we can see your First Column is a chameleon with no Mulch and um so that was you know you're irrigating based off what the chameleon says but you don't have any mulch the next one is the same it's chameleon but you've got seven tons of rice straw there and that's then compared to a farmer's irrigation with 10 tons of mulch so more mops than the chameleon one yeah so our seven ton was something that we came up with with our experiments sort of demonstrated that seven tons was the optimal optimal rate for rice rice straw mulch whereas the farmers were doing tent hunt as their standard practice so that's why that rate is different a bit of a comparison we're trying to also show there's efficiencies hopefully through less labor and straw and use like that and this was this was really cool because we had here's our beetroot yields in tons per hectare and you can see um mulching makes a huge difference so chameleon no mulch is significantly less yield but the chameleon with seven tons per hectare and then the farmer irrigation with 10 tons there was no yield difference so the take-home message is that you can use less water and less straw if you use a chameleon and you get the same yield and we've had this um not just across with beetroot we've had it with Maize watermelon we're extending that now into you know cow pea and quinoa so it's exciting to show the farmers these benefits they don't have to water every day you don't have to put on as much straw but you still get you know the same yields that you would if you used that much water and that much mulch so so this is this is really um it's just a feel-good moment when you see this data so what we know from from where we are at this point in the project is that we have found um alternative crops work and as I've mentioned before you know people approach us all the time with different crops you know have you tried this have you tried that we're not there to find um the one crop that will save everything it's the principle of how we Implement and adopt new crops and the criteria that we need to focus on and how we can work that into a system that's been predominantly rice based for for many many years so we've grown these crops novel crops in areas that have not seen alternative crops and they work which is good too and they're profitable profitable yeah yeah be true I don't have the quote here but we interviewed this Farmer in the picture and he made I think 27 million Dong per um 1000 meters squared compared to Rice which was two or three thousand so significant increases in farm income which is fantastic and and I think the next Point um you get that water saving if you combine some management practices to help optimize those crops there will be um there's many other things that you can do but these are two uh achievable and accessible tools for Farmers they have rice straw chameleons are relatively cheap we're looking at ways we can you know get more of these tools out to Farmers or increase awareness of irrigation the seven ton mulch seems to be the magic number consistently throughout our trials 10 tons it either you know it doesn't improve yield or improve anything so that's a good threshold to know and we sort of work from from that now um it's better than two and a half tons but but seven tons is no better than ten so that's that's um useful to know and we have found that 25 saving in labor and that would be um through irrigation like not having to irrigate daily um you can get that back to a household and we have interviews where Farmers have said that they now have more time to take their grandchildren to school and things like that so there's social benefits as well as well as um 25 Savings in fuel and that's from running pumps and things like that so there are all these sort of other benefits to the alternative crops and the management practices that we're looking at however there are still of course things that we still need to know and and need to find these out and these are research questions of Interest timing being a big one so the um finding those sewing Windows where we avoid abiotic stresses like temperature the saline intrusion those sort of water limitations they they are really important in to fit in with a cropping calendar that of rice that's already there no and that's a really big challenge because um because one of the effects of the climate change is the unpredictable weather yeah so in our in our journey working there the last few years we've had the early storm events that have flooded types and we've had the the heat wave effects that you know kill seedlings whereas you know the year before that didn't happen and so um and when you talk to the farmers has it been this hot before and they've never seen it this hot before so things are changing and so um that unpredictability is a real issue for us trying to fit these new crops into into the system yeah and then as Jason said it's fitting them into the system and then fitting them into their cultural practices so Vietnam has a big holiday in the in our new year but it's it's tet and when you speak to Farmers or researchers they say no one will grow crops over that period because they require irrigation daily and everyone takes two weeks off or ten days so it's working out it's you know we might have the scientific answer but it's how that fits into a socio sort of um Family household Dynamic practice and and the implications of changing something like that we have to sort of look into that as well and then um on top of that it's then optimizing once we've sort of got the timing right and it fits into a cycle that works for the farmers how can we optimize those um plants alternative crops is it fertilizer is it you know are we looking at soil constraints those sorts of things the soil is has been growing rice for many years there's probably um micronutrient research macronutrient there's there's a whole gamut of optimization that could go into that to further um in a way that's low input and and high productivity high profitability for Farmers um those are the sort of questions that we're looking at in the future and of course those alternative crops if they have benefit to the subsequent rice crop that means that you can wind back the fertilizer inputs then you change the risk profile because now you don't have so much Capital invested in in fertilizer for example and so the you know if the crop fails the losses aren't as great so there's those sort of things to take account of as well yeah so with that that's um a nice little wrap-up of our project and our um team and fantastic team members in Vietnam who really do a great job of pulling all these field trials and research questions together for us so it's it's a great place to work and explore these um these big big picture questions yeah thanks for the opportunity to present thank you very very much uh for this wonderful presentation I enjoyed it a lot and have a few questions myself but I will give the floor first to others questions please also comments are welcome suggestions and Stefan is first yeah I know a great presentation and a lot of learning for us in the Asia Mecca Delta initiative so linking up is really really useful valuable and hope we can do this further going forward together uh that's just one comment but my question uh is a little bit around the choices that you made that the initial crops that you tested did you do some sort of market analysis before because uh you sort of didn't talk about that that's fine but just to know that you do a market that's beat-root Market out there there's a potential there or for the melon or whatever it may be quinoa Etc over yes yeah so we we didn't as far as we knew that we couldn't do every single crop and so we grouped them into sort of you know serial types or grain crops vegetables and did it that way um but um what's what's what I've learned out of that process is that the scale of operation matters a lot and so there are some small small farms where perhaps the more labor-intensive niche uh like beetroot or something like that which they can sell locally at a at a high price works for that small farm whereas if that was done on a bigger Farm the the higher labor requirement more labor units all of a sudden that's not economical anymore whereas if you move somewhere to a larger scale then mechanization becomes super important and something like quinoa is viable whereas it's not viable on a small farm because you know it's you need to be mechanized to actually make that function and so um so whilst we're doing those we are doing those supply chain studies um we we started with the agronomic to get the ball rolling uh in that and now we can refine and probably chase the winners a little bit better if that makes sense yeah and I think matching up um existing small markets households you know the growth of vegetables sold on the side of the road you understand there's a familiar parity there um and it's just as Jason said matching that to where those smaller communities might exist or if it's broader scale and you can get Harvesters in yeah thanks I my question is actually very similar so I I use my current power to jump the line a bit sorry Mike um how did you come up with the actual crops that you were testing or that you tested in the in the field I mean you you showed the requirements and kind of the the general um yeah framework that they should should meet but that's probably still I mean dozens of options available did you sit down and brainstorm or did you have like a process for that that you ask experts come to University what was the so so we so we had we had the literature we had you know what's possible from the literature we worked very closely and and it's my mistake I have not got that on my um my final slide there in terms of who's in the team but the the dad the the department of agricultural rural development we actually worked really strongly with the the field staff there to hear what they wanted what they are interested in or their farmers are interested in and so so we like I guess quinoa we bought bought in as like that didn't come from Vietnam as an idea but but um everything else is pretty much the the farmers were interested or the dard staff have seen it grown somewhere else and wondered is that possible um and so so yeah it was ground up a lot of the cases but we had the literature there to sort of fill in well this should work and that should work or um when we didn't want to we didn't want to reinvent the wheel so if you know people have grown tomatoes then fine we already know you can do that and so and and just a quick follow-up was the is it General generally crops that hey are grown in the Mekong Delta already because sometimes you also mention new crops so what's the the mix between crops that maybe not those Farmers but that were kind of common in the Mekong Delta and completely new ideas you know the Patriots knew and quinoa's new so yeah so they're out there our newbies um but yeah the um cowpea we were really Keen to get a legume in the system soybean was our recommended from Dad and we with our sort of knowledge of the literature we tested soybean but knowing that it's only moderate salt tolerance and and consequently it failed so looking then they they're interested in a legume what can we find that fits that growing calendar and it's as you know shorter duration was also a big requirement trying to get something that can get through its reproductive phases and avoid those abiotic stresses so cowpe was was great because it's a multi-purpose crop and finding crops that have um Beyond one benefit whether it's because it's a legume or it could be used as a forage crop or it could be harvested as a bean consumed as a vegetable those sorts of things became appealing and then the farmers really got on board with that which is great so it's sort of a yeah you know the suggestions are passed in and we try and optimize what crops might suit that and if it's um if there's longer term Legacy effects as well through a nitrogen fixation I mean what a win for the system okay so so it's a it's a mixed methods approach yeah yeah okay Mike uh you've been very patient yeah thanks very much and thank you for a very interesting presentation my angle comes from the Aquatic side the the fishy side rather than crops but of course recognizing that the the Integrated Systems rice fish and other crops fish uh is are of course interesting for for Delta environments today and on another one CG uh program called asean we're looking at among other things uh regenerative agriculture which have involved soil health and sometime back James quilty who you know from acir asked me and others to evaluate a rice shrimp project which I think you were also involved with and that work promoted a Bayesian belief network uh probability app so my first question is is that application still in use and are farmers finding it useful uh um so I'm not I'm not sure on the um the uptake of of the BBN app I know they're very interested I know they've wanted it it was one of the things that we we need this um but I'm not sure how far that got developed after that project ended um but we had it set up we got it to a point where we had the structure there it functioned but like any any decision support system it's it's value improved with data going into it and so I'm not sure how much has has happened since the project ended okay thank you and the next question part of the question is have you come across something called a biofunk tool it measures soil health by gathering a range of um soil properties to give a prediction about soil health uh short answer no but one of the things that we've um we work with the farmers because we initially started with training programs to train the farmers about salinity as a as a because it's such a high risk factor for cropping um and what came out of that was actually they need just soil soil Health Training and so um it was amazing what the farmers could tell you about their soil um just from their observations like we keep growing rice and the yields kept going down we keep putting more fertilizer on but the yields keep going down but when we grow these alternative crops Everything Changes in the next you know the next rice crops better and and so they they put it together they realize that soil health is really important but they don't know much about it and so we have changed our training from salinity training to soil training soil constraint training and um and that's we've done it and you'll have to forgive us for just being Australian people working with Australian farmers and understanding what that's like uh we've used the models that we know work with our farm and took them to Vietnam and the Vietnamese tell you like oh this isn't going to work like no one's interested in this stuff you won't get Farmers engaged in this week look trust me it works Farmers love this stuff and we did it and the farmers engaged and the diet people oh we've never seen Farmers engaged like this you know and so farmers are farmers they they understand the soil they unders like they want to know more about it if they don't know they want to learn and so so that was um that I don't know the bio fund tool I'm not familiar with it but anything that it links soil fertility or soil health to a farmer is is going to work I think yeah not as long as it's Hands-On okay two quick extra questions the chameleon tool what's its lifespan uh good question it depends where and in what conditions it's being used the creator of the chameleon is is called um Richard sterzaka he's wonderful and he continues to develop the product and um takes feedback uh from from a whole world like range of developing countries that are utilizing the chameleon uh he's had chameleon sensors last one cropping season he's had them last five cropping Seasons so it's it's finding what parameters affect those um and why they would disintegrate quicker he has work on extra durable sensors that are thicker and he's working on Coatings and different things like that to you know expand their longevity the computer part of the sensor will you know will last for a very long time it's just the actual senses that go in the ground that may need replacing and they're they're very cheap so one last question uh have you looked at genetically modified crops saline resistance we haven't no and and there would be you would have to do a bit of work with finding policies um and how that matches in the systems okay yeah great thank you very much thank you thank you I see it now these chameleon sensors by the way can I ask roughly yeah so the card the chameleon card is about fifty dollars Australian with that comes with three senses already and um the Wi-Fi is is 150 200 but looking at um so they're actually produced in Africa which is where Richard started a lot of his work in Tanzania and countries like that trying to um solve Water Crisis issues there which is there's some great work that he's doing and developed a factory um there so there's they're working on trying to get them the price lower each time and more accessible for Farmers yeah so those cards are our go-to for of farmers because it's it's you know economically viable for them yeah yeah I just see a question in the chat um from Stefan I think about natural inoculum of the cowpie there is no current available uh viable inoculum that's commercial in in the Delta but we have found nodulation and we're doing work on identifying it and um looking at salt tolerant rhizobium so there's there's a space there which is exciting and and it's great that the cowpea that we sowed had had nodules when we when we looked at them which is which is great A great sign thanks that's also another question in the chat and that's also a question I had regarding the salinity levels in the different uh sites that you have you mentioned four provinces so it's it's probably a it's a gradient because it's rather Upstream to Coast um did you I mean Target the crops to the different levels and what would what's your how did you do that and what are the levels that's me answer questions yep so in stock training they're oh they can get up to so the Vietnamese use grams per liter so um the canal the sluice Gates will shut at four grams per liter of of the water irrigation water so that was the basis that we used in determining if a crop would be suitable understanding that soil salinization over the the you know course of the dry season that can get a lot worse and solute potentials and things like that so if if a crop can't handle that um it's sort of out of the equation but we were finding um Canal EC up to I think there's been 14 15 deci Siemens recorded um we've got data that sort of says eight and nine um in in those areas of the peak dry season and then um that sort of trend follows slower the lag with the soil yeah and so and so using mulch and and irrigating we can we can minimize the solute potential even though there's salt present we can minimize the effect of the solute potential so we can still get the plants to grow without that mulch there of course you get the evaporation then salts concentrate the solid potential will kill the plant um but the other thing is our because of the nature of the problem uh it's quite normal to grow these plants when there is no salinity but the salinity comes as they grow so it's the end of their you know it's like Brook says the reproductive phase if you get the solution that's the problem and so the the duration of that that crop becomes really important because you can with the right a short duration you can miss the salinity risk you can actually have your crop harvested before the salinity comes in but where where we've done trials in the field you know we've we've got even though like book said like they you'll shut the sluice gate at four Grands per liter um with evaporation and then even irrigation followed by evaporation you'll get higher salinities in the soil and and they will harm the sensitive crops for sure so that's in provinces where there are sluice gate protection we've got other provinces where the sluice gates are so effective that you don't get salinity coming in but you you've you've effectively got a trapped water source and so water scarcity becomes an issue so salinity even though our project is was focused on salinity is it's actually in some provinces it's water scarcity is the problem so there's alternative crops are still better than rice because it's a different risk profile different water use and so it's still much more sensible to grow an alternative crop than it is to try to go rice in the in the dry season when you've got a limited amount of fresh water available to you and and then that's why the chameleons are so important because you you optimize that water use efficiency so you're not wasting water and then there's more water to to go around within those traps enclosed systems yeah maybe you can come in here yes sir go ahead yes um as I also would like to acknowledge this very nice presentation Brooke and Jason as what I really liked was that you always had explanations also you made it an overview and you had always examples so that was really nice and you also showed us um your own lessons you learned so I'm really valuing this in your presentation and I was quite triggered by one that one of you said that it's very important the principles of how to implement and adopt and then I thought um yeah is this something one should go further with as it's it's really this type of thinking of what is needed why we are doing this why not that coming to this point of uh yes uh irrigation every day that is maybe common practice but it's not a best practice and so this uh working with with people in this food system uh more looking into the principles of how doing things so how thinking it's through so not coming up to solution saying okay now use beetroot and then uh so many days before or after that but uh yeah more go into this way of doing things yeah thank you yeah and it's interesting like and and um limit I've only really worked in Vietnam uh as my International experience but the farmers there they'll see something work and just pick up and go with it and so uh the willingness you know you go from literally going from hey um let's consider growing alternative crop instead of rice because rice is risky and then they see it and now let's grow two alternative crops and it's like whoa just calm down like maybe we just get one right first but they they're wanting to keep going faster and faster and so um you know being there to be able to support that interest and that enthusiasm but also protect people from perhaps the risks that come with with changing so rapidly um but so there's a balance there with dealing with the individual the individuals right I think that's the key to it like you you've got to tap into that enthusiasm and and uh they're they're uh it might be their age and stage and and who's there to farm with them or what their goals are um become become really important and we you talk about learning we've spoken about a little bit there's so much learning involved in it but um of course but uh when we when we see the farmers with we're around our field trial and then neighbors then want to get involved and they start expanding out um then you start we have the it's it's uh because if they're not going to grow that alternative crop and they want to grow rice well now we've got a hydrology conflict you know because some people want to have flooded Fields next to something that needs to be drained and so those issues become become important yeah yeah and maybe but you need the rice as a mark So and and if you use the rice as a milk what are you are not doing with rice that you may have done before so then there are always uh yeah a lot of things to uh to be looked into whether it was one that is very good you are causing something else where maybe something is missing at the end so that this is really this uh discussions about trade-offs what what we are using in an in what way yeah yeah in one of the projects we've quite interestingly com so I had a profitability analysis combined with the risk analysis and then you can also see okay some some cropping systems may have higher profit but also have a higher risk and that's that's I mean important to to balance um we are running out of time I would like to still ask you uh what's your what are your next steps what's what's coming next are you going for a second phase how long is the project running what's your do you have a scaling strategy what is next in your vision yes so we're we're roughly halfway through um and like we we started in the covert period so it was a pretty rough start but um luckily the team at Quinto uni um did a lot of work um good work that got the project loaded off in the right direction earlier so that was good we're about halfway through and so what we what we are looking at doing now is is our struggle like Brook said in her presentation that that fitting timing into a cropping calendar is very crucial and so we want to do more work around timing timing of sewing and timing of these Land Management practices and preparation uh and and I think we need to probably start factoring in some like modeling um you know climatic conditions into that and and factoring that into the outcomes and sort of using our field trials to validate those models um so we need to do that we need to at the moment all of our fertility is based on what is common practice in the area which is largely coming off what people do if they grow Maize um and so there's a fair bit of optimization to be had in that space um but yes moving forward so this project ends in mid 2025 and so we are looking at developing a new project that still looks at using alternative crops developing further on what we've been doing like Brooks says focusing on legumes a little bit more and of course um Vietnam like every other country in the world you know um soil carbon greenhouse gas emissions have to be factored into that and so so um looking at the benefits that our improved systems with these alternative crops that deliver benefits to the farmers but also benefits for the system and quantifying some of those as well so that that can be used so it's Quantified it's known that if Farmers change to this practice then these are the benefits um that come from its social as well as you know physical yeah very interesting thank you I'm I'm sure uh you'll get that uh work funded um I also hope that we keep on uh engaging and maybe even uh try and formalize a collaboration uh in more detail uh in the future um for now thank you very much for the presentation it was very enjoyable and the next Delta talks I'm not exactly sure if we have a date already uh we have in about four weeks the international rights Congress coming up and the whole world of course is very busy with that and focuses on that so I'm not sure if that is maybe in the way and we need to find an alternative date we will announce that ASAP so thank you everybody for participating uh thanks for the opportunity it's great to see you again too thank you okay thank you bye thank you bye-bye thank you bye bye thank you foreign",
