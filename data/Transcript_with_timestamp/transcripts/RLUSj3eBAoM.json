  "text": "[Music] [Music] [Music] let's start a new topic on the forward edition system we'll look into the details of the full irrigation system the design aspects the various design parameters which are required for the detailed design but before we do that i'd like to establish a relationship between various elements which are at once time infiltration and depoculation this relationship will be a general purpose relationship which will be used for all these surface irrigation methods even the border irrigation method which we have considered earlier this would be applicable to that this will give you a general understanding that how these items the advance time the infiltration and the deep population are related to each other and these relationships you can exploit for the design purposes so this will be a very important uh way of looking at the overall forces let's take the caustic of relationship which we had defined earlier and this gives the infiltration that the accumulated inflation depth with respect to the opportunity time and these two parameters which we have defined c and alpha are the empirical constants or these parameters we had also seen that how we can derive these parameters from the absorbed infiltration data which is taken in the field so these are basically defining the type of soil for each type of soil these parameters are known and t as nothing but as the infiltration opportunity time in other words if i write t i can write this t in terms of y and these two parameters i can approximate this t which is the infiltration opportunity time to this t here as we have used this t is nothing but infiltration opportunity time which means that at the surface of the ground for how long the water was available and for how long the infiltration opportunity was prevailing so accordingly the depth of infiltration can be determined depending on what is the time of infiltration or what is the time for which at least that assumption is valid that the amount of water is more than the infiltration opportunity or the infiltration capacity those things we have seen and since in irrigation when we are applying irrigation water we are ensuring that the depth of irrigation is always more than the infiltration opportunity of the infiltration capacity prevailing at that particular time but we can make an approximation that this time can be approximated to the time of irrigation so when we find out this time the t t now may be taken as the required time of irrigation but what assumption we are making is that the time of infiltration opportunity is equal to the time of irrigation so indirectly we can we can find out that time if we know the the characteristics of the soil this this relationship is known which we have already looked at now let's assume that the soil is we make two more assumptions first the soil is as uniform that means the soil characteristics are not changing for that particular field which is in question and we also make another assumption that the initial moisture content and also uniform now making these two assumptions let's take that the distance led we take z as the vertical distance the distance set from the soil surface to the depth of nothing if we when we when you irrigate the soil when the infiltration will take place the wetting front will move so if you want to express that wetting front in the form of distance z then this distance z can also be expressed it can be expressed as a function of y okay that will be proportional to with some proportionality constant f k i define as a proportionality constant of case then i can express z with respect to y and if i substitute y from the the caustic of equation this can be expressed as plus c t to the power alpha and okay now this these are two constants i can express this as a new constant which is k dash to the power alpha okay let's take two more quantities tt is time required for advanced curve another field time required for advanced curve to reach the end of the field and of tn is the time required to infiltrate the net irrigation requirement which is y n so t to achieve the net irrigation requirement if you need the time t n that is the time which is required to get this net depth of irrigation and tt is the time of advance of the waterfront to reach the downstream end now here comes the various options available to you it depends on your type of soil as well as the length of the field that what will be the the value of t in terms of t n or what is the proportion of t t of t n which is required for the waterfront to move in the downstream direction and to reach the downstream end of the field for example right now we'll assume that we'll make assumption we'll take one case where we will assume that this tt is 1 4 the time of net infiltration that if that infiltration is 1 unit will take 1 4 the time for the walk with the advanced curve to reach the non-instrument so if we make that assumption there can be various cases it might it depends on the characteristics of the soil it depends on the length of the field that how what will be the tt because the movement is a function of how much of the water is infiltrating with the soil as the water is moving in the forward direction and is also a function of what is the length of the field so these are there's only one possibility there can be many possibilities depending on how you have fixed the other parameters so let's make assumption that assume we are making assumption that dt for the present case which we are going to consider is 1 4 30 n time taken for the net education depth to be achieved is is four times the time taken for the advanced curve to reach the downstream end so with this assumption we we divide the total time taken which is the tn into four different parts in such a way that delta t 1 each one of these are the various intervals which we are going to consider and each one is equal to t n by four okay let's try to have a look what we have done so far i'll try to sketch this then this is your this is your total field this is the upstream and the downstream end okay i say that this is the root zone depth which you are interested in irrigating fine and this rules on depth the total time taken you are divided in when you are trying to consider what will happen each time in towel which you have considered each one is equal to one-fourth the total time requirement so if that is the case let's look at that what will be the the depth of water infiltrated in the first time interval the first time interval is delta t1 that proof infiltration as if i say that in general the depth of infiltration if you want to take in any one interval will be a function of what is the the initial depth in the soil and what is the depth in filtered during this time interval so if y i is the infiltration during that uh or the at the end of the interval and y naught is the infiltration which was already available in the beginning then during that interval you have the the increment depth into the left of infiltration is delta y i so similarly uh the depth of soil which will become wet which we'll call as delta z one you can write because we are we are saying that this is our total z this root zone is the red which we have which we are considered this is the total depth so in the first interval this will be the the depth of soil which will be vectored in the very first interval if we assume that zero to start with let's make an assumption that z zero is zero to start with if it is known you can take that value but if it is not known then if it is it was totally dry you can always take it to be zero not a very appropriate assumption so once you assume this you also need the value of alpha to be used in that equation the caustic of equation let's assume that the value of alpha is also known just for the present problem let's take this to be 0.5 then if these two things are known then the very first interval delta t one you can write this delta z1 is equal to z2 minus sorry is that 1 minus zero and z1 is nothing but you have said that 0.5 minus 0 in this present case this is nothing but z1 okay so in this particular case if this is delta red one i can similarly write the expressions for other intervals or delta t2 time interval i will find out what will be delta z2 as z2 minus z1 okay now z1 is nothing but this much depth isn't it this is z1 is equal to delta z1 so to find out the next depth i am trying to reduce this led to minus the previous step which has been considered earlier and the previous interval so z2 minus z1 which will be equal to k dash into t2 to the power 0.5 minus delta z1 because that one is equal to delta that one now t2 is 2 times t1 okay so if you substitute that your z2 will be k dash into t1 to the power 0.5 into 2 to the power 0.5 minus delta z1 which is nothing but delta z1 this part is defined r1 into two to the power point five minus one okay similarly you can write the the other forms also delta z3 will be delta z1 and 2 3 to the power 0.5 minus 2 to the power 0.5 and so on after that 5 will be 5 to the power 0.5 minus 4 to the power 0.5 so this general relationship can be established and if we plot this onto this you will find that at the end of t is equal to 1 this will be there the simple general trend if we take that this is a linear variation you can find that over the length of the field this would be the variation which will be encountered because of the fact that the water is moving from the upstream into the downstream end and the water is taking one-fourth the time since the time is equal to the time to reach the downstream end when the water will reach just the downstream end the infiltration will be minimum there similarly the other segment you'll find that the side of the segment the depth of infiltration will keep on reducing that is what you will see in the relationship and in each case this will be the the trend of the the infiltration for each of the the smaller segment for example this is for t is equal to 2 d is equal to 3 d is equal to 4 and if you go beyond this if you go beyond this take another segment you will find but in this this is 40 is equal to 5 though you have gone beyond the roots under these equations you if you just analyze these equations you will find that this trend will be shown each successive z or delta z which is lower down we'll be having smaller and smaller depth and that is quite understandable because we have been studying this so far that what happens uh when you go when you have the infiltration for a longer period so that is what is reflected here that the initial infiltration will be at a higher rate the later infiltration will be at a lower rate now if you want to satisfy the the downstream end of the field also you will have to provide the water beyond the stools on depth that means for an additional time period only then this component the the lower part of the field can also be satisfied or in other words what you can say is that if you want to satisfy the needs of the downstream and also you have to ensure that at least the water should be available there for tn time what is the net time for which the infiltration should take place so that to get the achieve the net irrigation requirement okay so that is what you will you can write in the form that to infiltrate depth yn into the lower end of the field there should be opportunity time at the lower end also equal to tn okay but we also know that t4 is equal to how much 4 times t1 and correspondingly z4 is k dash 4 t1 or delta z1 and 2 4 to the power 0.5 the same thing so to achieve this the infiltration opportunity at the in order to achieve this requirement the opportunity time at the upstream end has to be has to be d five which is equal to t n plus t n by four r is also equal to 5 times t1 and the corresponding z5 is delta z1 into 5 to the power 0.5 as we have done here the same thing okay now if that is what we have plotted here also this this is basically the same thing which we have plotted that if you want what will happen at t is equal to 5 so that is what we have plotted already here now we'll define two quantities which are very important quantities for our subsequent analysis and the design purpose we can utilize these the first is that if you want to know the average depth of soil which has been wet by depoculation will be there at average depth of soil is basically this part this portion which i can mark here this is the deep percolation which could have been avoided but since we wanted to take care of the downstream areas we have indulged in this departure so this deep percolation if you want to know that how much depopulation you have indulged into you can express that as delta z 5 by that's the average the population delta 5 is the maximum deep percolation if if we assume that this relationship is linear and is varying from delta five on the upstream and to the zero level at the downstream end then we can say the average deep percolation is delta 5 by 2 which can also be written as z5 minus z4 by 2 because delta delta 5 is nothing but z5 is the absolute value of the total depth up to that level and z4 is the depth up to the root zone level up the upstream end let me let me say that this is delta z2 the next one is i'll charge that 3 this is delta z 4 and that does that 5. okay these are the initial values but for each one this is the z1 up to this up to the next one is z2 z3 is at 4 and that 5 so you can you can use it either way this is z5 minus z4 that's what is detailed at 5 by 2 that is also you can write so this in fact is nothing but you can write this this in the general form minus 4 to the power 0.5 into delta z 1 by 2. okay this is one which gives you that what is the average deep percolation and if you want to find out the average depth of soil which has been wet then you can express that as z 4 plus that five by two so the total depth which has been wet was the average value of that is the average of the the two extremes on one side is z five and the side is z so the average of that will give you the total depth which has been wet this you can also express as 4 to the point 5 plus 5 to the power of okay now if you take the ratio of these two quantities the ratio of average depth of deep population to average depth of wet soil you can write this as that alternate five by two by that four plus z five by two which is five to the power point five minus four to the power point five by five to the power point five plus four to the power point five and z delta that one is cancelled out so this is the ratio which is and this particular case is point zero five six now in this in this specific case what it amounts to is you can now formulate that if the time of advance dt as one fourth the tn is one for the net infiltration time tn and for alpha of 0.5 the average depth of the percolation as 5.6 percent okay this is only one one instance which has been analyzed similarly there are many other instances which have been analyzed by taking different values of alpha which means that by taking different characteristics of the soil and by taking different fvr ratios which is the fractional advance ratio this ratio dt by tn we call it as far or fractional advance ratio so if these are known then you can you can formulate the relationships which can be used subsequently for your analysis and i'll show you some values of the table which have been which has been provided through the similar analysis which we have done just now this table looks like this i'll just pick up some of the the values out of this table so that you can get a feel of this table gives the expected percentage of deep population and on this side you have the fractional advance ratio far here you have the alpha values for different soils maybe ranging from point one two point nine for a fire ratio of one or you can write it as t that means the time of opportunity is same as the time taken by the the advanced curve to reach the downstream end you will have the values you can look at the order of magnitude of these values that how much if you have this parameters fixed in such a way that your advance curve or the time taken to reach for the advanced curve to reach the downstream end is equal to the opportunity time uh requirement for the knight infiltration to take place you will incur a lot of losses and those losses will also vary from soil to soil the soil as a function of alpha so if your alpha is increasing the deep population losses are also increasing let's take another sample of when you have t by 4 out of which we have analyzed only one but for the others for example when alpha is point one and you have a ratio of t by four in this particular case the depopulation losses will be one point one percent 2.2 percent 3.3 4.5 5.6 that is what we have analyzed for alpha is equal to 0.5 and for a fair ratio of d by four or one by four and six point seven some point eight point nine and ten percent let's take the other extreme of t by 10 that means you are you are flooding the total length in a very short period that's where far ratio is t by 10 so in this particular case your the percolation losses will be still smaller this table now can be utilized for picking up some of the parameters you can find out that if you want to accept only the deep population losses of a specific range you don't want the depopulation losses to be more than 10 percent or more than five percent and you know what is the type of soil which is the prevailing type of soil you can pick up that alpha and you can find out what is the the most preferable fpr ratio which is which can be utilized and that can give you some indication towards what should be the the time of allegation should be selected and what will be the the time of accordingly the time of infiltration which will be available is not is not dependent on only these things it will also be dependent on then which stream size you will be picking up what are the other other parameters of the field what is the grade all those things we have not considered so far this is only the starting the those parameters which are independent of the other aspects of the field they are only giving you the relationship between the soil type which is through alpha and the advanced time which is again dependent on the soil type to solve a certain extent and all these relationships can be utilized to start your your design concentrations looking at which are the most suitable parameters which you should be start with okay so this analysis is as i had mentioned in the beginning that this not only concerned with the forward education it is as a general purpose analysis which can be made use of and all the surface irrigation methods next we'll try to now start looking at the furrow irrigation method in particular first of all we'll try to look at those relationships which are obtained through experience through field trials so these relationships which are based on and field trials these relationships are very important in the absence of detailed data because you can also use the hydraulic relationships which are more exact but many a time you will find that the required data is not available so you have to you have to start at least looking at the designs with some some indicators which are available and since this is a very important area all over the world there are word organizations like fu which have compiled this information and made it available in many reports where is easily available where people have come out with under different conditions what will be the the limiting design parameters from various concentrations and we have already considered in the case of border irrigation also the consideration the major concentrations are of the things like that the stream sizes shouldn't be erosive you shouldn't create problems for your uh fields then there's one consideration the other is that your efficiencies should be reasonable as with efficiencies so that will be basically dictated by what sizes you will choose will be the combination of discharge the stream size the size of the field with respect to the soil type and with respect to the slopes the prevailing grades when you look at the grades there again you have to look at are those grades excessive which can create problems of erosion are those grades very flat which can also create problems of the drainage so they are they know specific uh rules and regulations which are applicable all over other places you will have to look at the climate you have to look at as a technical area as it a a red area the rules will be different from the for the similar soils but if the area is humid on one extreme and the other extreme of the area is arid you might have to choose different parameters for example let's assume that it is a humid area in the case of humid areas you will have lot of rainfall occurring and that too the intensity of the infall will be very high if you go in for slopes which are steep slopes maybe that during the irrigation time you can control those those steam sizes you can control the rate of application of water but what will happen when the rain will occur there won't be any control at that time the slopes which are prevailing in the fields they will remain there so when the rain water will be generated the surface runoff will be generated that will create havoc they'll create lot of erosion and all your your fields might be distorted it might be divided of all the fertile land which was there it might damage the crop all together so all those things are possible so when you look at those recommended parameters you will have to take into consideration many other conditions which are beyond the irrigation conditions these things are very important and we'll uh we'll look at all these these relationships which have been formulated on the basis of the experience of the farmer as farmer might not be having the scientific explanations of all these practices which he has been indulging into but through the experience through the the common sense he has arrived at some of the combinations which are which are very scientific which are very realistic and those things have also been taken into consideration when the various researchers have looked into all these various possible details of these parameters and they have taken into confidence or into consideration all those those experiences of the local farmers and those have also been brought out in all those publications wherever possible along with that the other are based on the experimentation which for example in the case of border regression we had seen that how we can do the evaluation runs so through those evaluation runs you keep on taking the observations and then you analyze those those data and come out with the recommended procedures for example in the case of the inversion you run those stream sizes in the fields and see that how much erosion is taking place you find out which are the stream charges which are limiting steam sizes beyond which if you increase the stream size for those specific type of slides under those slopes you will have the erosion problem so that is how you collect the data and you make the recommendations all those things we will discuss in the next class and along with that we'll also look at the hydraulic relationships which have been formulated on the basis of the hydraulic principles and they can be used for the design wherever those data the required data are available okay any question at this stage thank you [Music] [Music] you",
