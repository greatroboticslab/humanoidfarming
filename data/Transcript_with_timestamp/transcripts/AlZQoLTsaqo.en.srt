1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,400
hello you all uh my name is andre de

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:07,040
silva i'm the new extension vegetable

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:08,559
specialist um i have talked with you

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:11,040
before during the

5
00:00:08,559 --> 00:00:14,240
vegetable school 2022 about tomato

6
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:16,160
production about cucurbit

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:18,160
production as well variety selection

8
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,840
fertilizer management irrigation and

9
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,480
today we are switching gears a little

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:24,160
bit and moving to high tunnel uh

11
00:00:22,480 --> 00:00:26,080
vegetable production because i want to

12
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,680
just introduce

13
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:29,439
what are the challenges for heart tunnel

14
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,519
production what you can grow there and

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:34,320
how can you optimize the land and

16
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:36,800
increase your profit so

17
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:37,840
if you are a small grower or a home

18
00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,399
garden

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,960
high tunnel is a very good um

20
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:45,600
it's a very good approach for you to

21
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:48,000
increase the value of your produce per

22
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,280
area because you can produce sometimes

23
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:51,440
that

24
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:54,160
open field cannot do that and if you are

25
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:57,360
a hot um

26
00:00:54,160 --> 00:00:59,440
bigger grower i saw that there from the

27
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:01,760
from the quick survey that they did in

28
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:04,720
the beginning there are one or two uh

29
00:01:01,760 --> 00:01:06,960
large growers here with 20 to 50 acres

30
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:11,600
that's also a good opportunity for you

31
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:14,960
like to provide uh produce or to have

32
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:17,280
produced for like big contracts or even

33
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:20,400
farm markets in a time of the year that

34
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,360
it's like not very common for example

35
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:23,920
lettuce

36
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,759
early during the winter or tomato or the

37
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,920
spring so

38
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:29,439
if you have gone to some grocery stores

39
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:31,200
you have seen that the price of tomato

40
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:34,320
increase and that's because there's a

41
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:36,240
shorter shortage in the market so if you

42
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,400
have a high tuner you can

43
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:41,119
be able to sell your produce at those

44
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:42,640
high high prices so that's what you

45
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,200
would be looking for if you're doing a

46
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,960
high tunnel uh if you want to install a

47
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:49,840
hydronium so this is going to be a very

48
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:52,000
interrogatory one uh so feel free to

49
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:54,159
make question if you have a particular

50
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:56,560
question how to do some specific things

51
00:01:54,159 --> 00:01:58,719
like oh what fertilizer or how much

52
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:00,799
water to apply or feel free to make a

53
00:01:58,719 --> 00:02:03,439
question but first i want to

54
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:04,960
start talking about what is a high tuna

55
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
i don't know if you guys are familiar

56
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:10,319
but a high tuna has the same green is

57
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,560
the same structure as a greenhouse

58
00:02:10,319 --> 00:02:15,760
so it can be um

59
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:18,800
of lumber it can be of

60
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:20,560
aluminium um just one quick thing if you

61
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:23,840
are doing for organic

62
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:26,560
area uh lumber should not be treated

63
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:27,920
while if you have aluminium uh you don't

64
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,519
have any problem

65
00:02:27,920 --> 00:02:32,959
it's you usually cover with one layer of

66
00:02:31,519 --> 00:02:37,920
six mil film

67
00:02:32,959 --> 00:02:40,640
and uh it allows for uh solar heat and

68
00:02:37,920 --> 00:02:42,239
uh wind coolant so you can allow for

69
00:02:40,640 --> 00:02:43,760
ventilation there because you can

70
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:44,959
manually open

71
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,879
uh

72
00:02:44,959 --> 00:02:48,959
the sides of your tunnel like you see

73
00:02:46,879 --> 00:02:51,120
here we have sides or here in the door

74
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,040
we can open the door so this is a

75
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,879
recently new height you know actually we

76
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:57,599
finished building these two high tunnels

77
00:02:54,879 --> 00:03:00,640
last friday so those two high tunnels

78
00:02:57,599 --> 00:03:03,040
are in our organic farm in shelton in

79
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:05,599
the uvsmith so if you guys want to visit

80
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:07,599
and see how it's a brand new high tunnel

81
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:08,879
that's a good opportunity in an organic

82
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:10,560
field

83
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
and we can

84
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:15,599
manage them as we want usually high

85
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:16,480
tunnels can go from 10 feet

86
00:03:15,599 --> 00:03:17,440
by

87
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,879
up to

88
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:23,280
96 like 10 feet off we did like here we

89
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:26,480
have a 32 feet one and can

90
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,680
from 10 to 32 wide and uh

91
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,959
it can go

92
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:33,040
up to 96 foot long so this is what

93
00:03:30,959 --> 00:03:35,200
you're gonna be uh dealing with so if

94
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:37,519
you have a smaller operation so you can

95
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:39,360
go with a 10 feet or a 20 feet you just

96
00:03:37,519 --> 00:03:42,799
need to find what is the best specs

97
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,480
that's gonna allow you for um

98
00:03:42,799 --> 00:03:47,360
for that's gonna allow for your area of

99
00:03:44,480 --> 00:03:49,519
production so this is a brand new one

100
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:51,440
like i said that we can open the side so

101
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,239
allow for ventilation so during the

102
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:55,439
summer when used to well like when

103
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:57,840
you're gonna have like higher

104
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,760
temperatures you can open the sides and

105
00:03:57,840 --> 00:04:02,080
allow for ventilation to don't let like

106
00:03:59,760 --> 00:04:04,080
stress your plants with heat

107
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:06,480
uh those high tunnels they can be

108
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:08,159
permanent which is the most common one

109
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,040
but nowadays you have those that are

110
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:10,799
mobile

111
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:12,720
one and then you can move from one

112
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:14,560
location to another i will not get in

113
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:16,639
depth about those that can be moved i

114
00:04:14,560 --> 00:04:19,680
will focus on the permanent one because

115
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:21,840
like 99.9 of the production we have in

116
00:04:19,680 --> 00:04:25,199
the state is going to be with permanent

117
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:28,400
one and here i just put a quick um

118
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:29,919
a quick uh price per square feet and

119
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:33,040
that's how you're gonna buy it you can

120
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:34,720
get it from like many uh vendors

121
00:04:33,040 --> 00:04:36,960
and uh

122
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:40,400
they are very uh practical first

123
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:42,720
installation or you can build your own

124
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:45,440
but why i'm talking about to use those

125
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:48,400
high tuna because high tunnels have five

126
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,320
points of benefits that i want to talk

127
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:52,720
today and that's going to be the focus

128
00:04:50,320 --> 00:04:53,520
of my uh our conversation

129
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,600
so

130
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:57,919
the first one is because high 2 they can

131
00:04:55,600 --> 00:05:00,800
extend growing season what is it means

132
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,160
we can plant like a particular crop

133
00:05:00,800 --> 00:05:05,039
early

134
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:07,120
early in the season or we can plant when

135
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:09,759
it's in the spring or we can plant a

136
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:11,280
particular crop later in the fall so

137
00:05:09,759 --> 00:05:14,240
that's the benefits and that's what i

138
00:05:11,280 --> 00:05:17,120
want to talk also it can mitigate risks

139
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:18,800
associated to weather like we we're

140
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:21,680
going to talk a little bit later about

141
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:24,240
like the cold this frost that we just

142
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:26,400
got this past weekend or we can talk

143
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:28,800
about heavy rainfall events so that's

144
00:05:26,400 --> 00:05:31,199
some of the benefits of itunes it can

145
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:32,400
also reduce pest pressure

146
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:35,520
and we're going to talk about the

147
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:37,360
permanent plastic exclusion season dr a

148
00:05:35,520 --> 00:05:39,520
has a very strong program on how to

149
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:41,919
install those uh

150
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:43,600
exclusion system and he would be a good

151
00:05:41,919 --> 00:05:46,000
person for you guys to approach in

152
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:47,680
consideration for like how to avoid

153
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:50,639
insects on

154
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:52,800
on high tuning finally how to manage

155
00:05:50,639 --> 00:05:55,440
those high tuners to enhance crop yield

156
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:57,440
and how you can get a higher quality and

157
00:05:55,440 --> 00:06:00,400
as the last one i want to talk i just

158
00:05:57,440 --> 00:06:01,120
want to come back for how marketing

159
00:06:00,400 --> 00:06:02,240
uh

160
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,639
and what is the

161
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:06,800
advantage of a high tuner on you to

162
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:09,280
market your produce so that's how we're

163
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:10,880
going to be talking today

164
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:12,479
so first of all

165
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:13,759
uh we're going to talk about extending

166
00:06:12,479 --> 00:06:15,680
growing scenes

167
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:17,280
so here i put a

168
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:20,240
greek graphic that is an aces

169
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:25,520
publications from dr campbell on how

170
00:06:20,240 --> 00:06:28,319
when to grow vegetable crops in alabama

171
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,240
and we have for all most of our common

172
00:06:28,319 --> 00:06:33,120
vegetable crops here that can also be

173
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:36,880
grown in alabama so those are for open

174
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:39,120
field on high tunnels you can get up to

175
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,160
60 days

176
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:45,360
of early season so just thinking about

177
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:48,000
why a grower can you a open field grower

178
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:51,680
can be will be harvesting their bell

179
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:53,759
peppers in june july and august a high

180
00:06:51,680 --> 00:06:56,240
tunnel grower could be harvesting may

181
00:06:53,759 --> 00:06:57,680
and april when there is no market

182
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,520
when there is no bell pepper in the

183
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:02,240
market so that's when you can have your

184
00:06:59,520 --> 00:07:04,160
higher price so i just emphasized here

185
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:06,639
in this sentence that a well-managed

186
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,520
high tuning growing seed growing system

187
00:07:06,639 --> 00:07:12,240
utilizing plastic mulching

188
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:15,520
with raised bed mulching fume and broke

189
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:19,039
overs can length the growing seas

190
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:20,960
season it's a frost in a frosty period

191
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:23,039
which would be when the grower of the

192
00:07:20,960 --> 00:07:25,759
high tunnel would be planting their bell

193
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,639
pepper or whatever solanaceae

194
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:31,199
by as much as 60 days so that's the

195
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:33,599
first advantage i just show you examples

196
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:36,400
with the bell pepper but the same can be

197
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:40,240
uh protected by cabbage which is a cool

198
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:43,440
crop which we usually harvest in october

199
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:46,160
for the fall season or in april and may

200
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:48,639
for the winter for the spring season

201
00:07:46,160 --> 00:07:50,240
with a high to no cabbage in a high tuna

202
00:07:48,639 --> 00:07:52,400
you can harvest it in december or you

203
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,039
can harvest it in january so you don't

204
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:57,759
have that impact of the frost that we

205
00:07:55,039 --> 00:08:00,000
usually do have in uh during the winter

206
00:07:57,759 --> 00:08:01,120
so those are the kind of advantages that

207
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,199
uh

208
00:08:01,120 --> 00:08:05,199
a high tunu

209
00:08:03,199 --> 00:08:06,160
can provide for a grower

210
00:08:05,199 --> 00:08:08,160
so

211
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:10,960
but to do that you need to be careful

212
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:13,199
you need to prepare your planting dates

213
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:15,759
you need to be like

214
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:18,240
you need to keep track of your planting

215
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:21,280
dates your variety selections when to

216
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:22,960
plant and how to do the crop succession

217
00:08:21,280 --> 00:08:25,280
because you don't want to plant the same

218
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:28,160
crop in the same location to avoid

219
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:29,440
problems with disease and you don't want

220
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:31,280
uh to

221
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:33,599
plant everything in the same day because

222
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:35,599
you need to support a market so you want

223
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,800
to do different planting dates in order

224
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:41,680
in order to provide that um to supply

225
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:43,279
that market with your produce so keep

226
00:08:41,680 --> 00:08:45,440
that in mind

227
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:48,320
playing with planting dates and crop

228
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:51,440
succession it's an important thing for

229
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:53,680
on a high tuna production

230
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:56,240
and how it can mitigate risks associated

231
00:08:53,680 --> 00:08:58,640
with the weather like i said before we

232
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:01,200
can have frost protection here is a

233
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:03,040
common temperature of the this graph

234
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:06,880
here shows a common

235
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:11,360
movement of uh high temperature in uh

236
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:13,279
high maximum temperature in red uh

237
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,440
minimum temperature in blue or how we

238
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,200
have during the spring early season as

239
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:19,200
we have january and then

240
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:22,240
all the way to the end of the season so

241
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:24,800
you need to see when you are planting

242
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:26,880
and what is the weather conditions for

243
00:09:24,800 --> 00:09:28,640
that because when you have it

244
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,240
outside temperatures

245
00:09:28,640 --> 00:09:31,839
of uh

246
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:33,519
the outside temperature is completely

247
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:36,000
different from the the temperature

248
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:38,480
inside the high tunnel so that's what

249
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:40,560
you need to understand in order to

250
00:09:38,480 --> 00:09:42,480
optimize your production and select the

251
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:44,240
right planting dates

252
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:46,320
one good thing off of high tunnel you

253
00:09:44,240 --> 00:09:48,959
don't have wind damage you don't have a

254
00:09:46,320 --> 00:09:51,440
directly sun exposure or you can even

255
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:53,519
cover your high tunnels with some shades

256
00:09:51,440 --> 00:09:55,440
so you can grow during the summer and

257
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:57,760
also you don't have the direct impact of

258
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:58,880
rainfall events that you can like soak

259
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,839
your field

260
00:09:58,880 --> 00:10:03,680
and though all those problems frost wind

261
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:06,000
damage directly sun explosion and

262
00:10:03,680 --> 00:10:09,040
rainfall events can cause some of the

263
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:11,440
common uh disorder in produced like i

264
00:10:09,040 --> 00:10:13,440
talked in my first class on tomato

265
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:16,480
production like sunny scouting in

266
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:17,839
tomatoes or cracking because of rainfall

267
00:10:16,480 --> 00:10:21,120
events and the wrapped growth of

268
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:24,399
tomatoes or even you can have some hails

269
00:10:21,120 --> 00:10:27,120
on by wings or

270
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:29,279
other problems in your tomato so those

271
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:31,600
are the advantage of the tomato it's of

272
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,720
the the high tunas it's gonna

273
00:10:31,600 --> 00:10:38,079
allow you to produce a high quality and

274
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:42,399
reduce the problems with cools when you

275
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,480
are harvesting your uh produce

276
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:46,399
we had a very good example like i said

277
00:10:44,480 --> 00:10:48,399
in the beginning this past week

278
00:10:46,399 --> 00:10:49,440
for a

279
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:52,000
uh

280
00:10:49,440 --> 00:10:54,560
for the frost protection so this is just

281
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:56,480
a graph where we have friday march 11th

282
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:59,680
saturday march 12

283
00:10:56,480 --> 00:11:01,839
march 13 march 14 march 15 which is

284
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:04,399
today during this weekend and this is

285
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:05,839
the weather for central alabama i got

286
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:07,519
this from the

287
00:11:05,839 --> 00:11:11,680
a little bit for a weather station a

288
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:14,240
little bit north of uh montgomery so

289
00:11:11,680 --> 00:11:16,640
just for you to see

290
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:19,279
on high tunnel production

291
00:11:16,640 --> 00:11:22,000
the green area here represent optimum

292
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,760
temperatures of outside for high tunnel

293
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:26,800
production while the red it's going to

294
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:29,680
be too low for high to no production so

295
00:11:26,800 --> 00:11:30,399
imagine if you for food production sorry

296
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,480
so

297
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,000
imagine if you are a grower who thought

298
00:11:32,480 --> 00:11:38,000
that we already had our last our last uh

299
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
frost of the year back in

300
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,839
february and you put your watermelons in

301
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:43,440
the field you put your tomato in the

302
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,440
field

303
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:49,200
but then you suddenly had that lower

304
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:53,200
temperatures on saturday or even sunday

305
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:56,399
where it's got lows of 27.

306
00:11:53,200 --> 00:11:57,920
so that's temperature will definitely

307
00:11:56,399 --> 00:12:00,240
kill your plants

308
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,240
so but if you had a high tuna that would

309
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:04,160
not be the case you would have a

310
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,079
reduction in growth

311
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:09,040
which would delay your season but it

312
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:11,600
will not kill your plants so that's a

313
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,839
benefit of having a high tunnel you

314
00:12:11,600 --> 00:12:17,600
don't have those problems with weather

315
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:19,920
conditions that are very common on open

316
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,920
field

317
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:26,160
another topic that i'm going to go with

318
00:12:22,959 --> 00:12:29,360
very quick on high tunnels is uh that

319
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:31,519
while the weather is

320
00:12:29,360 --> 00:12:34,399
something beneficial

321
00:12:31,519 --> 00:12:38,079
insect disease and weeds are also

322
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:41,120
easier to control however keep in mind

323
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:43,519
if you don't do a proper integrated path

324
00:12:41,120 --> 00:12:45,279
management and that's what dr sakura

325
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:48,240
will be talking later

326
00:12:45,279 --> 00:12:49,760
you're gonna have a quick infestation

327
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:52,000
for example

328
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:54,480
these three white flies here in this

329
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:56,560
leaf can quickly become a high

330
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:59,200
population in a high tunnel because they

331
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:01,600
have all favorable conditions to

332
00:12:59,200 --> 00:13:04,320
reproduce in a high tunnel it's a close

333
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,800
environment rainfall cannot knock then

334
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,839
then down and they can quickly spread

335
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:12,880
they can also quickly grow aphids there

336
00:13:09,839 --> 00:13:14,720
from a small one they can also be large

337
00:13:12,880 --> 00:13:17,279
aphids and they can start to transmit

338
00:13:14,720 --> 00:13:19,120
disease and that's what dr sakota will

339
00:13:17,279 --> 00:13:21,360
be talking later about the disease

340
00:13:19,120 --> 00:13:23,440
problems but see white flies can

341
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,760
transmit crampon virus so it can quickly

342
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:27,680
destroy or

343
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:30,000
outbreak your height you know production

344
00:13:27,680 --> 00:13:33,519
if not properly managed or you can have

345
00:13:30,000 --> 00:13:35,839
even other disease um

346
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,000
for tomatoes if you don't like have soil

347
00:13:35,839 --> 00:13:39,920
borne disease there

348
00:13:38,000 --> 00:13:41,440
you will not be able to plant tomato for

349
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:43,440
a while

350
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:46,480
if you have problems there so the

351
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:49,600
management of disease and also weeds and

352
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:51,040
insects in high tunnel must to be

353
00:13:49,600 --> 00:13:53,120
quickly managed

354
00:13:51,040 --> 00:13:56,320
otherwise you're gonna have that area

355
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:58,320
infested and over us one season to

356
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:00,560
another you will be losing a lot of

357
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:02,399
youth potential so here is just some

358
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:04,800
example of

359
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,040
some goose grass that can go this is an

360
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:08,639
open field that we have but in a high

361
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:11,920
tunnel it's going to be very similar it

362
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:13,760
can quickly spread in the field and we

363
00:14:11,920 --> 00:14:16,240
can uh even see

364
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:19,839
more high tunnels so my recommendation

365
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:22,240
is if you are growing in a high tuna

366
00:14:19,839 --> 00:14:24,480
and you will not

367
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:26,880
plant in the summer because you are

368
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:29,440
achieving highest yield in your market

369
00:14:26,880 --> 00:14:31,120
during early spring and late fall

370
00:14:29,440 --> 00:14:33,600
don't go to the beach and leave your

371
00:14:31,120 --> 00:14:37,040
heart to no unattended

372
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:39,360
please go ahead plant a cover crop try

373
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:42,560
to manage problems that you have during

374
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:46,639
the season with a cover crop or with any

375
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:49,199
other uh practice like solarization or

376
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,760
any other um

377
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:53,120
cash crop during the summer otherwise

378
00:14:51,760 --> 00:14:54,560
you're gonna start to having more

379
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:55,839
problems

380
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:57,839
we're gonna come back and talk a little

381
00:14:55,839 --> 00:15:00,000
bit more about that but i would like to

382
00:14:57,839 --> 00:15:02,399
give one of good examples that dr a

383
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:05,040
usually talked on about the past

384
00:15:02,399 --> 00:15:07,920
exclusion because he has some permanent

385
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:10,240
exclusion system to prevent uh

386
00:15:07,920 --> 00:15:12,639
the past establishment like the use of

387
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:15,360
shade plus is a low-cost option and

388
00:15:12,639 --> 00:15:18,320
easily available for the growers so here

389
00:15:15,360 --> 00:15:20,720
is an example from dr a where we install

390
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:24,160
it he install it in a growers field like

391
00:15:20,720 --> 00:15:26,160
this uh shade cloud is net that will not

392
00:15:24,160 --> 00:15:28,000
allow insects to enter in the high

393
00:15:26,160 --> 00:15:30,639
tunnel so that's why we say that is a

394
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:33,519
permanent exclusion system is gonna be

395
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:35,440
all the time there it is to allow air

396
00:15:33,519 --> 00:15:39,120
movement

397
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:41,040
and most important it will avoid insects

398
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:42,160
to get into your

399
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,160
system

400
00:15:42,160 --> 00:15:47,199
this is a particular photo that i really

401
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:48,399
like from uh dr a because we have like

402
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:50,560
we can see

403
00:15:48,399 --> 00:15:53,680
insects trying to get into the high

404
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,440
tunnel but our um

405
00:15:53,680 --> 00:15:57,519
exclusion system is

406
00:15:55,440 --> 00:16:00,160
working the way how it was supposed to

407
00:15:57,519 --> 00:16:03,920
be so that's one of the way that because

408
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:07,040
you can open your sides allow air um

409
00:16:03,920 --> 00:16:09,920
to ventilation and still protect it from

410
00:16:07,040 --> 00:16:12,639
your from insects

411
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:14,720
so switching gear from the

412
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:16,880
ipm program that we still going to talk

413
00:16:14,720 --> 00:16:19,360
later i want to talk about

414
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:22,000
give you guys some options of how you

415
00:16:19,360 --> 00:16:24,079
can increa enhance your crop yield and

416
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:26,399
your crop yield potential and your

417
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:30,800
quality in high tunnel

418
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:31,759
you want to plant high value crops

419
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:34,160
you

420
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,560
have a high investment to build that

421
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,399
high tuna or to purchase that high

422
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:40,399
tunnel and you want to make that

423
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:42,639
investment worth

424
00:16:40,399 --> 00:16:45,759
so select crops that you're going to

425
00:16:42,639 --> 00:16:50,160
have higher yields or i mean higher

426
00:16:45,759 --> 00:16:52,639
value so tomato cucumber spinach pepper

427
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:55,519
strawberry strawberry

428
00:16:52,639 --> 00:16:58,480
summer squash lettuce and even cut cut

429
00:16:55,519 --> 00:17:00,320
flowers are good options for uh

430
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:02,839
for high tunnel production i just put

431
00:17:00,320 --> 00:17:06,079
some photos here that we have

432
00:17:02,839 --> 00:17:08,640
from from some of the high tuners uh

433
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,520
that we have played tried before and to

434
00:17:08,640 --> 00:17:13,600
show you that like those can all all of

435
00:17:11,520 --> 00:17:17,360
those crops can be produced in high

436
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:19,760
tunnels in the state of alabama

437
00:17:17,360 --> 00:17:22,480
but to do that you need to do a quick

438
00:17:19,760 --> 00:17:24,880
three steps so going let's say you

439
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:27,360
decide to plant on your high tuna you

440
00:17:24,880 --> 00:17:28,960
decide to move forward and yes we're

441
00:17:27,360 --> 00:17:31,600
gonna do a high tunnel once you do a

442
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:34,160
high tunnel you select your crop but now

443
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:36,480
follow three steps in order for you to

444
00:17:34,160 --> 00:17:39,360
maximize your production and don't have

445
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:43,039
problems first step is do a crop

446
00:17:39,360 --> 00:17:45,679
rotation here we have a quick line of

447
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:48,240
what crops should be success succeed by

448
00:17:45,679 --> 00:17:50,559
the other ones so let's go for a four

449
00:17:48,240 --> 00:17:53,440
step crop rotation plant we have first

450
00:17:50,559 --> 00:17:55,919
we grow we we grow our leaf green

451
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:57,840
in area one and then in the same area

452
00:17:55,919 --> 00:18:00,480
which is the same high tuna we go with a

453
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:02,320
fruit a tomato a bell pepper

454
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,160
next season we're going to do some root

455
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:07,760
we can plant some carrots we can plant

456
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:10,000
some potatoes there try to diversify and

457
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:12,960
then later you come with a legume plant

458
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,280
some beans there plant some uh dried in

459
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:17,679
there so this way you can maximize your

460
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:20,640
ear and next and in the next season you

461
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:23,760
come for again with greens this will

462
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:25,039
minimize your problems with disease with

463
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:27,919
insects

464
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:30,160
okay so that's a good operation or a

465
00:18:27,919 --> 00:18:33,440
crop rotation that your operation should

466
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:35,919
have in order to maximize yield

467
00:18:33,440 --> 00:18:38,559
once you select your crop you build your

468
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:39,679
you created your plan of crop rotation

469
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:41,760
then you're going to talk about

470
00:18:39,679 --> 00:18:44,000
irrigation and fertilizer management in

471
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:47,520
high tunnel

472
00:18:44,000 --> 00:18:50,080
i will not go in that crop by crop that

473
00:18:47,520 --> 00:18:52,080
should be uh the fertilization of

474
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,919
the crop by crop fertilization program

475
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:56,480
i'm gonna say follow the fertilizer

476
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:58,559
recommendation and use soil samples we

477
00:18:56,480 --> 00:19:00,559
have the vegetable book the vegetable

478
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:02,400
handbook we have the

479
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,520
high tuna uh

480
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:08,080
vegetable handbook so you guys have all

481
00:19:05,520 --> 00:19:11,679
this information on hand if you don't

482
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:13,679
find it contact your uh your agent they

483
00:19:11,679 --> 00:19:15,520
can they can contact us or you can

484
00:19:13,679 --> 00:19:17,520
contact us directly and we're gonna help

485
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:20,320
you with that but one thing that i would

486
00:19:17,520 --> 00:19:22,960
like to emphasize on the fertilizer end

487
00:19:20,320 --> 00:19:26,400
is nowadays the price of fertilizer is

488
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:28,799
just increasing so consider use compost

489
00:19:26,400 --> 00:19:30,880
and manure that's not a problem our

490
00:19:28,799 --> 00:19:34,480
currently recommendation for goals from

491
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:37,200
120 to 400 gallons per 100 square feet

492
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:39,600
in high tunnel production and do that

493
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,160
about 120 days

494
00:19:39,600 --> 00:19:44,880
before harvesting your crop follow the

495
00:19:42,160 --> 00:19:47,840
food safety is important in high tunnel

496
00:19:44,880 --> 00:19:50,000
production as well because you cannot

497
00:19:47,840 --> 00:19:52,559
apply raw manure

498
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:55,919
before if you are harvesting your crop

499
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:58,080
in 120 days so apply it before that

500
00:19:55,919 --> 00:20:00,000
otherwise if this is raw manure if you

501
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:03,440
have a composite manure or a treated

502
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:06,720
manure then you are good but if not do

503
00:20:03,440 --> 00:20:09,120
if it's a raw manure 120 days before

504
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:11,520
harvesting and i would recommend you

505
00:20:09,120 --> 00:20:12,400
guys to apply this

506
00:20:11,520 --> 00:20:13,840
uh

507
00:20:12,400 --> 00:20:16,480
this uh

508
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:20,000
manure or this compost before planting

509
00:20:16,480 --> 00:20:22,320
in advance so you can allow it for uh

510
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:24,960
nutrients to be available and follow up

511
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,280
with some liquid fertilization that's

512
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,120
important for you to supply nutrients in

513
00:20:27,280 --> 00:20:31,280
the middle of the season don't only

514
00:20:29,120 --> 00:20:33,679
apply it pre-plant and think that oh

515
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:35,440
we're gonna be all fine remember

516
00:20:33,679 --> 00:20:37,360
if you have like

517
00:20:35,440 --> 00:20:39,919
high temperatures you're gonna have

518
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:41,600
mineralization of your nitrogen there

519
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:44,480
you're gonna have maybe that nitrogen

520
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:47,200
will not be available for your uh

521
00:20:44,480 --> 00:20:50,400
for your crop most importantly a lot of

522
00:20:47,200 --> 00:20:52,960
compost they are high in phosphorus and

523
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:56,080
then if they have high temperature that

524
00:20:52,960 --> 00:20:58,559
phosphorus will uh

525
00:20:56,080 --> 00:21:01,200
not other nutrients and will not allow

526
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,080
plants to uptake other nutrients so

527
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:06,320
don't rely only in a high application of

528
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:08,960
compost and manure it's a very good

529
00:21:06,320 --> 00:21:12,880
approach to use manure i would strongly

530
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:15,120
recommend however follow with

531
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,960
other fertilization don't only apply the

532
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:18,080
manure

533
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,880
and

534
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:23,120
fertilizer or nutrients are linked in a

535
00:21:20,880 --> 00:21:24,799
way with irrigation that if you change

536
00:21:23,120 --> 00:21:27,120
one you're going to affect the other so

537
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:29,679
irrigation is another key important

538
00:21:27,120 --> 00:21:31,760
aspect in a height to you mostly because

539
00:21:29,679 --> 00:21:34,640
when you have a high tunnel you are

540
00:21:31,760 --> 00:21:36,559
change the environment of your crop you

541
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:39,440
have higher temperatures that will

542
00:21:36,559 --> 00:21:42,480
enhance your plant growth but those

543
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,799
plant growth that those higher are

544
00:21:42,480 --> 00:21:47,200
faster growth also require more water

545
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:49,760
for your plants so irrigation management

546
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:51,520
becomes important in the high tunnel so

547
00:21:49,760 --> 00:21:53,760
there are two things when we talk about

548
00:21:51,520 --> 00:21:56,240
irrigation management first is what

549
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:59,039
system to use the most common ones are

550
00:21:56,240 --> 00:22:00,799
drip and sprinkler irrigation however i

551
00:21:59,039 --> 00:22:02,000
would say say no for sprinkler

552
00:22:00,799 --> 00:22:04,480
irrigation

553
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:07,200
because you want to apply water

554
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:09,600
in the soil not in the plant if you

555
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:12,240
apply water in the plant you are create

556
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:14,080
optimal conditions for disease to get

557
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:17,520
into your plants and that's going to be

558
00:22:14,080 --> 00:22:20,320
a problem so prioritize drip irrigation

559
00:22:17,520 --> 00:22:22,640
if drip is not okay it's not feasible

560
00:22:20,320 --> 00:22:24,799
for your operation then it's okay to go

561
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:27,280
with sprinkler or with an overhead

562
00:22:24,799 --> 00:22:28,400
irrigation and most of the growers think

563
00:22:27,280 --> 00:22:31,840
that oh

564
00:22:28,400 --> 00:22:34,400
uh sprinkler irrigation is a single um

565
00:22:31,840 --> 00:22:36,320
a single uh investment while drip we

566
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:39,440
need to change every year

567
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:41,600
yes that's true however the likelihood

568
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:44,159
for you to fail with a sprinkler is much

569
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:45,840
higher than with a drip irrigation or

570
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:49,120
you're gonna need to have a higher

571
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:51,520
investment in uh disease and pest

572
00:22:49,120 --> 00:22:54,240
control with a sprinkler when compared

573
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:56,720
with a drip also sprinkle require more

574
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:58,640
water consumption than a drip

575
00:22:56,720 --> 00:23:00,960
consequently you're gonna have more cost

576
00:22:58,640 --> 00:23:03,840
with pumping that water

577
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:05,919
more water also is required so

578
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,760
because of all that factors i strongly

579
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,520
recommend our growers to install drip

580
00:23:07,760 --> 00:23:11,440
irrigation in their

581
00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:14,080
high tunnels that they're gonna they're

582
00:23:11,440 --> 00:23:16,960
gonna see a considerable uh increase in

583
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:19,360
yield and reduction in inputs

584
00:23:16,960 --> 00:23:20,720
once the the irrigation system is

585
00:23:19,360 --> 00:23:23,440
determined i would go with the

586
00:23:20,720 --> 00:23:25,440
irrigation scan if you have seen my

587
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:27,679
talks about irrigation scheduling i

588
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:29,919
usually recommend

589
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:32,559
three types of scheduling in alabama for

590
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:34,720
open field which is the systematic the

591
00:23:32,559 --> 00:23:37,039
crop evapotranspiration and soil

592
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:40,159
moisture sensors but that's for open

593
00:23:37,039 --> 00:23:42,320
field in high tunnel i would recommend

594
00:23:40,159 --> 00:23:45,039
or you do the systematic irrigation

595
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,480
which requires a irrigation panel in

596
00:23:45,039 --> 00:23:48,720
your high tunnel and you're going to

597
00:23:46,480 --> 00:23:50,240
apply the same volume of water every day

598
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:52,880
or you're going to run your system at

599
00:23:50,240 --> 00:23:54,320
the same time or you're going to use the

600
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:57,520
soil moisture sensors where you're going

601
00:23:54,320 --> 00:24:00,159
to apply water according to your soil

602
00:23:57,520 --> 00:24:01,919
your soil water availability the reason

603
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,240
why i don't recommend the crop water

604
00:24:01,919 --> 00:24:06,159
demand or using evapotranspiration is

605
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:08,080
because the environmental conditions

606
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:10,640
within a high tunnel is different than

607
00:24:08,080 --> 00:24:11,679
outdoor so you will not be able to

608
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:14,559
provide

609
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:16,960
you will not be able to s like to

610
00:24:14,559 --> 00:24:18,720
estimate how much water is being lost by

611
00:24:16,960 --> 00:24:20,960
your plant

612
00:24:18,720 --> 00:24:23,039
so using the soil moisture sensors are

613
00:24:20,960 --> 00:24:26,159
currently the best approach for high

614
00:24:23,039 --> 00:24:28,960
tunnels in irrigation scan systematics

615
00:24:26,159 --> 00:24:30,640
are okay however you also is applying

616
00:24:28,960 --> 00:24:32,799
you are applying water by feeding you

617
00:24:30,640 --> 00:24:35,039
think that your your plants need that

618
00:24:32,799 --> 00:24:36,960
that volume of water which might be

619
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:38,480
not true so if you are a very

620
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:41,520
experienced uh

621
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:43,679
high tuna grower your uh the systematic

622
00:24:41,520 --> 00:24:45,520
irrigation or using a panel to apply the

623
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:47,600
same volume every day it's probably

624
00:24:45,520 --> 00:24:49,760
going to be a good option however if you

625
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,159
are not if you are new i would strongly

626
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,799
recommend soi moisture sensors and if

627
00:24:52,159 --> 00:24:55,840
from those experience one using sensors

628
00:24:54,799 --> 00:24:57,679
they're going to see that they have a

629
00:24:55,840 --> 00:24:59,760
much better return and an increase in

630
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:00,400
their use

631
00:24:59,760 --> 00:25:02,559
so

632
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:04,480
once you are finished with step two i

633
00:25:02,559 --> 00:25:07,600
will move for step three which is the

634
00:25:04,480 --> 00:25:11,039
pest management know your disease know

635
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:12,880
your insects know your weeds we have all

636
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:14,400
the publications available for you to

637
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:16,960
identify that

638
00:25:14,400 --> 00:25:20,400
know it in advance for your crop because

639
00:25:16,960 --> 00:25:23,760
like i said a disease a insect can

640
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:25,840
quickly spread in your high tunnel for

641
00:25:23,760 --> 00:25:27,760
disease do a good cultivar selection

642
00:25:25,840 --> 00:25:29,679
select coachbars that are resistant for

643
00:25:27,760 --> 00:25:32,320
particular disease in your area and

644
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:34,080
you're going to do always a preventive

645
00:25:32,320 --> 00:25:36,240
management which means you don't want to

646
00:25:34,080 --> 00:25:38,480
see the disease there you want to first

647
00:25:36,240 --> 00:25:41,120
up you want to first

648
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:43,440
apply products and that will not allow

649
00:25:41,120 --> 00:25:45,200
the disease to grow in your area or use

650
00:25:43,440 --> 00:25:48,240
cultivars that are resistant for that

651
00:25:45,200 --> 00:25:50,720
disease while insect use the permanent

652
00:25:48,240 --> 00:25:53,760
exclusion system insects it's more like

653
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:54,960
you control it as you see there

654
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:57,760
so

655
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:00,080
frequent scoutings of your high tuners

656
00:25:57,760 --> 00:26:01,840
are very important while the weed

657
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:03,760
management you're gonna be doing the

658
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:06,159
scouting for the insect and you need to

659
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:09,279
do that some problems that you have that

660
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:10,880
you're gonna have in alabama with uh

661
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:13,120
weeds in our

662
00:26:10,880 --> 00:26:16,400
high tunnel will be nutsed will be

663
00:26:13,120 --> 00:26:18,720
morning glory and those are like uh

664
00:26:16,400 --> 00:26:21,039
pigweed and those are those

665
00:26:18,720 --> 00:26:23,279
weeds that are very common also outdoor

666
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:24,960
so follow those um

667
00:26:23,279 --> 00:26:28,400
know what you're gonna be dealing with

668
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:31,360
so this way you can be like more in

669
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:34,640
quickly on the prevention or on the

670
00:26:31,360 --> 00:26:36,880
management of these pests so do those

671
00:26:34,640 --> 00:26:39,440
three steps and you're gonna be able to

672
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:43,440
see some increase on your yield this is

673
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:46,000
a data that a group of um

674
00:26:43,440 --> 00:26:48,480
in the southeast put together for how

675
00:26:46,000 --> 00:26:50,640
much yield can be increased in high

676
00:26:48,480 --> 00:26:52,559
tunnel production when compared to open

677
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:55,440
field so just take a look on the

678
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:58,559
cucumber while you can you can yield

679
00:26:55,440 --> 00:27:00,960
point half pound half pound per square

680
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,640
feet in the open field in a high tunnel

681
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:04,799
you can double it

682
00:27:02,640 --> 00:27:07,520
and look at this spinach you can have

683
00:27:04,799 --> 00:27:10,159
like almost six or nine times ten times

684
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,440
almost nine eight times more on spinach

685
00:27:10,159 --> 00:27:16,400
production bell pepper five times more

686
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:19,679
tomato you can increase four times more

687
00:27:16,400 --> 00:27:21,600
so just see how better how higher is

688
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:23,919
your yield if you do a good crop

689
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:25,760
management in your high tunnel so those

690
00:27:23,919 --> 00:27:27,520
are the benefits of the heightening if

691
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:29,360
you do a good crop management you

692
00:27:27,520 --> 00:27:31,120
consequently will have a higher yield

693
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:33,279
than in an open field and you're going

694
00:27:31,120 --> 00:27:35,440
to be adding value to that product

695
00:27:33,279 --> 00:27:36,159
because high tunnel is much easier for

696
00:27:35,440 --> 00:27:38,960
you

697
00:27:36,159 --> 00:27:40,640
to a management than open field even for

698
00:27:38,960 --> 00:27:43,120
organic so if you are doing a high

699
00:27:40,640 --> 00:27:45,520
tunnel i would strongly recommend try to

700
00:27:43,120 --> 00:27:47,600
certify that high tuning if you certify

701
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:49,200
that high tunnel for organic production

702
00:27:47,600 --> 00:27:51,039
that's going to be a good approach for

703
00:27:49,200 --> 00:27:52,559
you to even increase your profit per

704
00:27:51,039 --> 00:27:54,480
area

705
00:27:52,559 --> 00:27:57,360
so those are all the benefits that a

706
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:59,039
high tuna have and when we are talking

707
00:27:57,360 --> 00:28:01,200
about marketing that i said that would

708
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:02,799
be my last topic i would come back for

709
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:05,039
those planting dates that i talked in

710
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:07,520
the beginning of my um of these

711
00:28:05,039 --> 00:28:10,720
presentations so you are looking for

712
00:28:07,520 --> 00:28:12,399
off-season windows remember bell pepper

713
00:28:10,720 --> 00:28:14,399
you don't want to harvest bell pepper of

714
00:28:12,399 --> 00:28:18,320
a high tuna in june you want to harvest

715
00:28:14,399 --> 00:28:20,559
that before june or after november

716
00:28:18,320 --> 00:28:22,480
so that's when you have your best winter

717
00:28:20,559 --> 00:28:23,760
same thing that we talked about cabbage

718
00:28:22,480 --> 00:28:25,840
and now and

719
00:28:23,760 --> 00:28:28,559
and like that and you go on for every

720
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:30,880
single crop do a succession of crops and

721
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:33,279
planting days try to diversify your

722
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:35,440
production and finally add value for

723
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:38,240
your product conventional versus organic

724
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:40,960
hype tuna versus on open field this way

725
00:28:38,240 --> 00:28:43,919
you're gonna have a higher profit and

726
00:28:40,960 --> 00:28:45,520
optimize the use of your high tune so

727
00:28:43,919 --> 00:28:48,320
just to summarize a little bit the

728
00:28:45,520 --> 00:28:51,279
importance of height of of uh to the

729
00:28:48,320 --> 00:28:53,120
take-home message from this uh

730
00:28:51,279 --> 00:28:55,840
this presentation today keep in mind

731
00:28:53,120 --> 00:28:57,679
that high tunnel they do have an extreme

732
00:28:55,840 --> 00:29:00,480
potential and they can be done in

733
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:02,480
alabama in the entire state however it

734
00:29:00,480 --> 00:29:04,799
does require an investment

735
00:29:02,480 --> 00:29:06,399
it is an upfront investment that you

736
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:08,880
should be considering

737
00:29:06,399 --> 00:29:10,880
when you select uh when you have your

738
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,679
high tunnel selecting the high value

739
00:29:10,880 --> 00:29:15,520
crops can help this pain back but

740
00:29:13,679 --> 00:29:17,279
remember you need to do your crop

741
00:29:15,520 --> 00:29:19,840
management and your high tunnel

742
00:29:17,279 --> 00:29:21,600
maintenance this is key for you to

743
00:29:19,840 --> 00:29:22,960
maintain that high tunnel for a long

744
00:29:21,600 --> 00:29:25,520
time and you don't need to do more

745
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:27,679
investment or rebuild a high tunnel and

746
00:29:25,520 --> 00:29:29,919
