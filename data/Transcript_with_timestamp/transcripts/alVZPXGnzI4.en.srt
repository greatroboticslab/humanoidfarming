00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:29,039
that we are going to use to make our own

00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:33,920
compost we're going to be using

7
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:37,760
greens live foods that we don't use

8
00:00:33,920 --> 00:00:40,879
you put it in one side of the container

9
00:00:37,760 --> 00:00:44,239
and it will compost to make your own

10
00:00:40,879 --> 00:00:47,280

25
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:41,119
if y'all have not had experience with

26
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:44,720
one two or three little tiny fire ants

27
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:46,720
it's horrible getting stung by a bee is

28
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:55,840
bad but

29
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:55,840
holy spiritual buckets

30
00:01:56,719 --> 00:02:01,040
so this is where we're going to make the

31
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,040
compost at

32
00:02:04,079 --> 00:02:09,360
you can never have too much fun when

33
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:14,400
you're on your homestead

34
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:17,440
literally every day is fun day

35
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:18,879
even when it doesn't feel fun i'm still

36
00:02:17,440 --> 00:02:22,560
making fun

37
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,040
beanta is in the round pen the donkeys

38
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:25,520
have

39
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:27,760
chewed it by the way right there hi

40
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:31,599
binta

41
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:34,720
you want out so miss haley was

42
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:37,760
using these bags to help with her

43
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:41,120
training of desensitizing her

44
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:43,680
because she's very scared of the bags

45
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:45,599
and the sound of a bag so we had her in

46
00:02:43,680 --> 00:02:50,879
this training pen

47
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:53,440
to gently get her desensitized

48
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:54,800
i'll probably do a video on that someday

49
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:57,920
but

50
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,560
right now we're working on several other

51
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,480
things aren't we being tough

52
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:04,560
all right so what is this called a less

53
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,440
pitchfork this is a pitchfork and what

54
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:09,200
are you going to use it for

55
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:12,239
i bought you this pitchfork it was 33

56
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,760
at russell's feed and

57
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:15,280
you really really wanted it what's it

58
00:03:13,760 --> 00:03:18,560
for oh well

59
00:03:15,280 --> 00:03:20,720
i'm using it to

60
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:23,280
flip my compost so we're going to flip

61
00:03:20,720 --> 00:03:26,560
our compost

62
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:27,280
with the pitchfork oh what do we have in

63
00:03:26,560 --> 00:03:30,840
here already

64
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,760
is that hey um yeah grass popping

65
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:36,560
sleeves horse manures okay

66
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:36,959
grass clippings leaves horse manure and

67
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:38,959
then

68
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
were we gonna do like any i guess

69
00:03:38,959 --> 00:03:44,720
leftover lettuce maybe

70
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,720
from the bunnies and the guinea pigs

71
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:51,040
oh the watermelon rinds oh my gosh

72
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,959
the ones that the chickens ate yeah it's

73
00:03:51,040 --> 00:03:55,599
pretty hard is it really gonna

74
00:03:52,959 --> 00:03:56,720
is that really gonna mush up into

75
00:03:55,599 --> 00:03:58,959
anything

76
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,120
yeah the bacteria will just attack it

77
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,720
that's pretty crazy

78
00:04:01,120 --> 00:04:05,040
you know thank goodness i don't have to

79
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,159
throw away my watermelon rinds

80
00:04:05,040 --> 00:04:09,040
anymore in the trash oh we can do

81
00:04:08,159 --> 00:04:11,760
cardboard

82
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:13,280
and this is all okay so when do you know

83
00:04:11,760 --> 00:04:14,080
that you're going to now transfer it to

84
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,840
this side

85
00:04:14,080 --> 00:04:19,600
of the compost well this is a two-step

86
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:21,519
one so basically that one would be for

87
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,120
the finished compost like once it's like

88
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,160
dirt looking you put it in there so you

89
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,800
can use it

90
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:28,400
okay um there's also like a three style

91
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,000
one where you flip it and then flip it

92
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:31,840
back into there

93
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:33,919
so yeah so where's the dirt is it gonna

94
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:36,400
be on the bottom or the top

95
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:38,000
yeah it's gonna decompose at the bottom

96
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,320
and then work its way up

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:42,000
why i don't know i think it's a mix i

98
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:44,639
know see we're homesteaders

99
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:47,040
in the learning process yeah so that's

100
00:04:44,639 --> 00:04:48,639
what i love about this it's all hands-on

101
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:50,240
people don't just magically know the

102
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:53,520
stuff you start

103
00:04:50,240 --> 00:04:55,120
and we're learning and then

104
00:04:53,520 --> 00:04:56,720
this is going to be passed down to

105
00:04:55,120 --> 00:05:02,240
generations

106
00:04:56,720 --> 00:05:06,080
of carols and wonderful texan

107
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:09,199
son-in-laws manly

108
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:12,880
husbands that my daughters are going to

109
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,880
find good men

110
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,880
and they're going to know how to do this

111
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:20,160
stuff too

112
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:22,000
someday my grand kitties

113
00:05:20,160 --> 00:05:23,919
they're going to know this like the back

114
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:25,440
of their hand and it's going to be all

115
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:29,759
because we had to start

116
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:33,520
fresh on our own learn it all ourselves

117
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:34,240
with our neighbors our family my

118
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:37,199

she has such wisdom my father-in-law has

120
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:43,199
such wisdom

121
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:47,120
my dad has a lot of uh experience with

122
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:50,160

[Music]

128
00:06:04,080 --> 00:06:10,960
here is an update on our compost

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:14,000
that we have been working on

130
00:06:10,960 --> 00:06:18,479
as you can see we have

131
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:21,680
expanded it isn't this so cool

132
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:23,919
our good neighbors brought some over to

133
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:27,199
us they donated these cute

134
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:28,160
blue ones nice texas colors some red

135
00:06:27,199 --> 00:06:30,560
ones

136
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:31,759
so we're expanding so we can have more

137
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,199
options of

138
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:37,440
separating like this is the cardboard

139
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,639
and the horse manure that's going to be

140
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:42,000
starting one

141
00:06:38,639 --> 00:06:42,400
once it starts then she will move it

142
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,720
over

143
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:45,600
to have the dirt on this side that we

144
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:48,479
can use

145
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:49,599
by next spring we're hoping this one

146
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:53,360
right here

147
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:56,479
she's got more of pine shavings

148
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:59,599
just dirt mulch from the chicken coop

149
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:01,360
some weeds and such and she will move it

150
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:03,360
over to this section

151
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,360
you have to keep it moist for this

152
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,039
compost

153
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:11,680
to develop and then she's planning on

154
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,639
making another one right here

155
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,680
where we can do more of fruits and

156
00:07:14,639 --> 00:07:18,319
vegetables

157
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:19,280
the rinds of the watermelon things like

158
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:21,440
that

159
00:07:19,280 --> 00:07:23,360
that you can use anything really for the

160
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:27,360
compost you just can't use

161
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:30,160
any meat any dairy any animal products

162
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:33,599
other than manure because you want it to

163
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:36,319
be a natural source where it's going to

164
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:36,720
develop into a dirt that you can then

165
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,680
use

166
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:41,280
for your garden boxes you know many

167
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:44,720
different things that you can use the

168
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:47,599
compost for

169
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:48,479
you can compost veggie cuttings fruit

170
00:07:47,599 --> 00:07:51,520
peels

171
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:55,039

round pen that we made in previous

178
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:13,280
videos we had just a plain orange one

179
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:15,120
we did have to replace it because of our

180
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,440
naughty donkeys they like to play with

181
00:08:15,120 --> 00:08:19,520

00:08:17,440 --> 00:08:21,120
she's already trained i will have an

183
00:08:19,520 --> 00:08:23,840
