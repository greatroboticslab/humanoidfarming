00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:36,440
cover crops are an integral part of

00:00:34,120 --> 00:00:39,559
sustainable agriculture because of their

00:00:36,440 --> 00:00:42,320
role in soil stewardship Pest Management

00:00:39,559 --> 00:00:45,320
and crop rotation while many vegetable

00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,559
farmers in the Northeast use cover crops

8
00:00:45,320 --> 00:00:50,239
typically the practice is limited to

00:00:47,559 --> 00:00:52,879
small grains for preventing winter soil

I'm Hank Bell we're at Lewis Creek Farm

21
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:48,920
in starksboro Vermont we have 60 Acres

22
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:51,880
under cultivation 35 Acres of vegetables

23
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:56,000
we sell wholesale retail at the farmers

Stand I'm a cover crop fanatic anything

26
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:05,600
that's not in vegetables I want to keep

27
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:08,399
in a cover crop I think of it as a bit

28
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:11,959
of a free lunch where there's very

29
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:15,120
little time or money invested for a lot

30
00:02:11,959 --> 00:02:15,120
of fertility

31
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:33,920
returned winter Ry is the basic cover

32
00:02:30,360 --> 00:02:38,440
crop that most people use I used to just

33
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:42,519
grow winter rye and about 10 years ago I

34
00:02:38,440 --> 00:02:46,200
started growing hary vetch in with the

35
00:02:42,519 --> 00:02:48,280
Rye hary vetch is a winter annual it's

36
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,519
planted in the fall puts on a little bit

37
00:02:48,280 --> 00:02:54,519
of growth stays alive through the winter

38
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:59,560
and then puts on a lot of growth in the

39
00:02:54,519 --> 00:02:59,560
spring much the way Rye does

40
00:03:12,599 --> 00:03:17,360
without

41
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:20,280
nodulation the vetch wouldn't fix any

42
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:23,840
nitrogen when I first started growing

43
00:03:20,280 --> 00:03:27,280
vetch I inoculated it every

44
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:30,000
year I'm much more casual about it now

45
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:33,720
sometimes I don't inoculate at all this

46
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:36,280
field was not inoculated last fall and

47
00:03:33,720 --> 00:03:40,000
it does have nodules on it now that I've

48
00:03:36,280 --> 00:03:43,799
grown it all over my farm the inoculant

49
00:03:40,000 --> 00:03:43,799
is resident in the

50
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:53,560
fields when I plow Ryan Harry vetch down

51
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:57,680
at this stage for crop sweet corn for

52
00:03:53,560 --> 00:04:01,159
instance I find that I can do without

53
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,480
most of the nitrogen uh normal nitrogen

54
00:04:01,159 --> 00:04:06,879
applications I do put on a starter I put

55
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:08,760
on about 30 pounds with a starter mix 30

56
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:11,680
pounds of nitrogen then I keep track of

57
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,720
it with a prid dress nitrogen test to

58
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:16,680
see if I've got you know if we've got

59
00:04:13,720 --> 00:04:19,959
heavy rains we might lose a lot of it I

60
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:23,560
find that the amount of nitrogen that uh

61
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:26,199
Ryan Harry vetch produces will

62
00:04:23,560 --> 00:04:30,080
feed early to

63
00:04:26,199 --> 00:04:34,080
mid uh season varieties of corn

64
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:36,160
completely so Corn's up to about 5 feet

65
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,639
high when you get into those big late

66
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:41,560
varieties of corn they seem to be using

67
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:44,320
enough more nitrogen that it requires an

68
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:44,320
additional side

69
00:04:55,280 --> 00:05:01,039
dressing this is a field of oats and

70
00:04:58,280 --> 00:05:04,759
vetch what's noticeable is there's no

71
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,160
oats this is the spring the oats have

72
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:11,080
winterkilled what's good about that is

73
00:05:07,160 --> 00:05:14,479
you don't have that coarse grassy matter

74
00:05:11,080 --> 00:05:17,800
that takes so much time to break

75
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:20,039
down the major thing I like about oats

76
00:05:17,800 --> 00:05:22,840
and vetch is that when it's plowed it

77
00:05:20,039 --> 00:05:25,319
leaves a lot less stemy trash and makes

78
00:05:22,840 --> 00:05:28,319
a nice fine seed bed it's good for

79
00:05:25,319 --> 00:05:30,840
direct seeding the Ryan vetch is better

80
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:33,759
for transplanting

81
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:37,440
yeah C well they always look good

82
00:05:33,759 --> 00:05:37,440
yeah white that

83
00:05:41,120 --> 00:05:46,199
pretty I like to get all the fields

84
00:05:43,199 --> 00:05:49,080
covered with a cover crop but some crops

85
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:51,800
come off too late in the season to get a

86
00:05:49,080 --> 00:05:56,520
cover crop in the last seating date for

87
00:05:51,800 --> 00:05:58,840
winter Rye is October 15th so for crops

88
00:05:56,520 --> 00:06:01,479
that are harvested after that date you

89
00:05:58,840 --> 00:06:04,240
either have to leave the the field be or

90
00:06:01,479 --> 00:06:07,599
you can intercede them we came in with

91
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:10,680
buckets of Ry seed each person taking

92
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:11,560
one row and scattering seed up through

93
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,720
the

94
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:17,560
row one person could do an acre in 40

95
00:06:15,720 --> 00:06:19,639
minutes I use this technique of

96
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:22,360
interceding rye on most of the late

97
00:06:19,639 --> 00:06:24,280
season coal crops broccoli cauliflower

98
00:06:22,360 --> 00:06:27,000
cabbage brussels

99
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:28,960
sprouts this was a field of cauliflower

100
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:31,280
the rows are closer together than

101
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:35,560
Brussels sprad outs you have to be a

102
00:06:31,280 --> 00:06:39,039
little bit careful not to get rice seed

103
00:06:35,560 --> 00:06:41,000
into the cauliflower plants you don't

104
00:06:39,039 --> 00:06:43,960
want the Rye to get in the plants

105
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:47,199
because it'll actually grow in the head

106
00:06:43,960 --> 00:06:49,280
uh just from the moisture of dew

107
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:51,000
alone this is a field of Brussels

108
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:54,160
sprouts that was protected through the

109
00:06:51,000 --> 00:06:57,479
winter by winter Rye we got the Rye on

110
00:06:54,160 --> 00:07:01,759
here the first week in September we

111
00:06:57,479 --> 00:07:03,919
cultivated it in and and now we have a

112
00:07:01,759 --> 00:07:08,240
good crop of Rye protecting the field

113
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:08,240
and something to plow down as well
