2
00:00:04,040 --> 00:00:08,240
in Wyoming we tend to have soils that

3
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:09,719
are lacking in organic matter and one of

4
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:11,559
the best things you can do before you

5
00:00:09,719 --> 00:00:13,679
begin to prep a garden site is to have a

6
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,480
soil test done and that will tell you

7
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,320
the amount of organic matter you have in

8
00:00:15,480 --> 00:00:18,920
your soil as well as the nutrients you

9
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:21,359
do have and things that you might need

10
00:00:18,920 --> 00:00:23,320
to add to that soil so some of the

11
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:25,840
different organic matters that you might

12
00:00:23,320 --> 00:00:28,800
use are composted kitchen scraps and

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:30,880
yard waste from your own garden and yard

14
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:32,040
um compost that you can get from the

15
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:34,480
garden

16
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:38,879
centers composted manure that you can

17
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:41,559
buy in packages Pete Moss straw anything

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,960
that was plant-based before it became a

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,280
product that you'd use for a soil

20
00:00:42,960 --> 00:00:50,399
amendment in the garden that will help

21
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:54,559
with drainage for heavy clay soils um

22
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:56,280
and holding on to water in sandier soils

23
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:58,519
so that you get the benefit of the

24
00:00:56,280 --> 00:01:01,160
nutrient that you add to the soil rather

25
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,080
than having it drain away

26
00:01:01,160 --> 00:01:06,960
when you put on organic matter um we

27
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:09,600
would recommend that you put on about 2

28
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,479
in and then rake it into your soil and

29
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,680
then roota till it in as deeply as you

30
00:01:11,479 --> 00:01:15,600
can if you're lacking in nutrients you

31
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,880
can get a variety of different

32
00:01:15,600 --> 00:01:20,240
fertilizers to add to your soil and then

33
00:01:17,880 --> 00:01:22,360
your garden is really prepared and ready

34
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,159
to use for your gardening season this

35
00:01:22,360 --> 00:01:26,079
