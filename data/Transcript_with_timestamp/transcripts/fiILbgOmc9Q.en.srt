1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:08,069
good morning everybody thanks for being

2
00:00:04,650 --> 00:00:10,380
here this is another seminars and quite

3
00:00:08,069 --> 00:00:12,059
a series that we have been organizing

4
00:00:10,380 --> 00:00:14,240
and actually I want to take the

5
00:00:12,059 --> 00:00:16,859
opportunity to thank Issa Bell for

6
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,680
following up on the seminars if you have

7
00:00:16,859 --> 00:00:22,050
any idea for your own to present or any

8
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:24,630
speaker you think should come and give a

9
00:00:22,050 --> 00:00:28,170
seminar you can always float the idea

10
00:00:24,630 --> 00:00:31,080
today we invited Luke don dava

11
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,780
ludendorff is a very esteemed colleague

12
00:00:31,080 --> 00:00:36,420
with whom we have been working over the

13
00:00:33,780 --> 00:00:38,820
past years in a very fruitful

14
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:41,219
collaboration between CIMMYT and simba

15
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,770
stuff when you see some of the numbers

16
00:00:41,219 --> 00:00:46,140
about publications coming out of the

17
00:00:43,770 --> 00:00:50,340
long term trial infrastructure the long

18
00:00:46,140 --> 00:00:52,469
term trials we have here in in Mexico

19
00:00:50,340 --> 00:00:55,949
part of those publications come from

20
00:00:52,469 --> 00:00:58,020
student collaborations that we have been

21
00:00:55,949 --> 00:01:00,899
doing together with Simba stuff and

22
00:00:58,020 --> 00:01:02,879
Luke's research team what I always say

23
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:06,630
is the uniqueness is Luke has a lot of

24
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:09,000
nice ideas nice research tools that we

25
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:11,390
don't have and we have the long term

26
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:14,220
trials that can actually be the

27
00:01:11,390 --> 00:01:18,360
background or the can generate a story

28
00:01:14,220 --> 00:01:21,780
to buy through using those that those

29
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:22,920
insights that are way more upstream than

30
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:25,500
what we are doing

31
00:01:22,920 --> 00:01:29,210
Luke is a very long and recognized

32
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:31,500
career he started its its work at

33
00:01:29,210 --> 00:01:34,439
university university of lurvin

34
00:01:31,500 --> 00:01:38,369
dan was quite some time active in Rotom

35
00:01:34,439 --> 00:01:41,729
step and finally landed in Mexico in

36
00:01:38,369 --> 00:01:43,619
Simla stuff where he's still leading one

37
00:01:41,729 --> 00:01:46,860
of the most important research teams on

38
00:01:43,619 --> 00:01:51,270
carbon nitrogen cycling and recently

39
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:54,329
micro organism processes but I'm sure he

40
00:01:51,270 --> 00:01:56,820
will explain that way better than I can

41
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:58,770
do so thank you and let's give a round

42
00:01:56,820 --> 00:02:02,550
of applause

43
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:05,380
[Applause]

44
00:02:02,550 --> 00:02:06,790
good morning good morning and thanks for

45
00:02:05,380 --> 00:02:10,770
coming

46
00:02:06,790 --> 00:02:10,770
I try

47
00:02:41,980 --> 00:03:12,099
relations but okay to give certain

48
00:02:57,489 --> 00:03:15,519
characteristics to bacteria I don't know

49
00:03:12,099 --> 00:03:17,410
if soap actress or important in that it

50
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:29,470
might be competition it might be

51
00:03:17,410 --> 00:03:32,650
predictors are not collaboration between

52
00:03:29,470 --> 00:03:44,980
friend institutes some younger

53
00:03:32,650 --> 00:03:49,389
researchers working we already it's

54
00:03:44,980 --> 00:03:50,859
rather a good collaboration I'm quite

55
00:03:49,389 --> 00:03:53,200
proud of it

56
00:03:50,859 --> 00:03:56,950
we have now 31 published peer-reviewed

57
00:03:53,200 --> 00:04:00,010
manuscripts we've got seven hundred

58
00:03:56,950 --> 00:04:02,350
forty-five citations some Morpher these

59
00:04:00,010 --> 00:04:05,859
citations come from some very important

60
00:04:02,350 --> 00:04:10,329
papers of Braun Road we have an index of

61
00:04:05,859 --> 00:04:14,380
14 so I'm quite pleased with this

62
00:04:10,329 --> 00:04:19,720
collaboration we have quite a lot of

63
00:04:14,380 --> 00:04:22,479
other papers ready to submit okay we

64
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:26,860
know that agriculture practices affect

65
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:31,990
yields so characteristics we studied

66
00:04:26,860 --> 00:04:45,910
some of these Elberton and Obregon but I

67
00:04:31,990 --> 00:04:48,880
focus mostly pitfall in Elberton so in

68
00:04:45,910 --> 00:04:50,979
sole characteristics abdominal pattern I

69
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:53,950
mentioned it immediately I got to

70
00:04:50,979 --> 00:04:56,080
replicated plots so if you do an

71
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:57,849
analysis statistical analysis

72
00:04:56,080 --> 00:05:02,250
you get problems because the variation

73
00:04:57,849 --> 00:05:04,719
is rather great so often you see

74
00:05:02,250 --> 00:05:09,539
clear-cut effects that they are not

75
00:05:04,719 --> 00:05:11,949
significant so yeah some of the problem

76
00:05:09,539 --> 00:05:16,870
that's one of the commands of the last

77
00:05:11,949 --> 00:05:19,750
paper that we submit doesn't even know

78
00:05:16,870 --> 00:05:29,349
it is to accept it but this is a command

79
00:05:19,750 --> 00:05:32,590
I often receive we know but I'm a bit

80
00:05:29,349 --> 00:05:40,120
worried about because it returns and

81
00:05:32,590 --> 00:05:41,889
returns that's why obregón is that if we

82
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:45,009
want to get some soul samples and

83
00:05:41,889 --> 00:05:46,060
extract DNA time becomes difficult and

84
00:05:45,009 --> 00:05:52,090
if we want to expect

85
00:05:46,060 --> 00:05:56,169
Aaron aid and it's even more okay but

86
00:05:52,090 --> 00:05:58,060
these differences especially which have

87
00:05:56,169 --> 00:06:00,849
a large effect on carbon nitrogen

88
00:05:58,060 --> 00:06:02,800
mineralization this is a very simple

89
00:06:00,849 --> 00:06:05,259
representation of the AI robic

90
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:08,440
incubation we do who got some soul which

91
00:06:05,259 --> 00:06:12,370
are carbon dioxide and we measure in the

92
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,979
soil mineral M and now recently we saw

93
00:06:12,370 --> 00:06:17,860
to extract a DNA to see what is

94
00:06:14,979 --> 00:06:21,370
happening there another command that I

95
00:06:17,860 --> 00:06:23,889
was not really aware but if you start to

96
00:06:21,370 --> 00:06:30,550
work with bacteria then you have

97
00:06:23,889 --> 00:06:31,900
non-parametric data I've never well did

98
00:06:30,550 --> 00:06:36,639
a lot of research on soul

99
00:06:31,900 --> 00:06:39,690
characteristics parametric but bacteria

100
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:42,509
if you count they're nonparametric and

101
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:47,110
again if you try to do some analysis

102
00:06:42,509 --> 00:06:49,409
than yeah significant difference is

103
00:06:47,110 --> 00:06:52,750
rather difficult to obtain because

104
00:06:49,409 --> 00:06:55,659
nonparametric or more stringent if I can

105
00:06:52,750 --> 00:07:00,099
say it all that okay so I said I would

106
00:06:55,659 --> 00:07:01,690
mention the problems really these are

107
00:07:00,099 --> 00:07:03,639
some results of carbon and nitrogen

108
00:07:01,690 --> 00:07:05,909
mineralization you see not a lot of

109
00:07:03,639 --> 00:07:09,699
differences between your treatments

110
00:07:05,909 --> 00:07:12,909
although you have a difference in carbon

111
00:07:09,699 --> 00:07:16,180
content and I compare that with ballpark

112
00:07:12,909 --> 00:07:18,599
and Rothamsted where after how long as

113
00:07:16,180 --> 00:07:21,339
it's more than hundred and sixty years

114
00:07:18,599 --> 00:07:27,550
you really have a big difference in in

115
00:07:21,339 --> 00:07:31,060
carbon carbon content is extremely

116
00:07:27,550 --> 00:07:32,589
different I just want to mention you

117
00:07:31,060 --> 00:07:37,180
know that maybe Jenkins have published a

118
00:07:32,589 --> 00:07:40,659
paper on micro biomass carbon there's no

119
00:07:37,180 --> 00:07:43,899
replicator broad book so if you look at

120
00:07:40,659 --> 00:07:45,959
the data on his original paper then

121
00:07:43,899 --> 00:07:52,180
there's no replicates there

122
00:07:45,959 --> 00:07:54,880
additionally he includes soil and you

123
00:07:52,180 --> 00:07:58,659
look at the line so but anyway I think a

124
00:07:54,880 --> 00:08:03,399
very important paper but I have some

125
00:07:58,659 --> 00:08:05,860
questions anyway we didn't detect a big

126
00:08:03,399 --> 00:08:07,539
difference in carbon nitrogen

127
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:09,880
mineralization we did some measurements

128
00:08:07,539 --> 00:08:11,529
also in the field we did that quite a

129
00:08:09,880 --> 00:08:13,509
while ago and that was one of the

130
00:08:11,529 --> 00:08:17,949
problems we faced when separate his

131
00:08:13,509 --> 00:08:20,050
paper on carbon carbon dioxide emission

132
00:08:17,949 --> 00:08:22,930
tonightís outside the mission the median

133
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:27,149
emissions that reviews pointing out you

134
00:08:22,930 --> 00:08:27,149
only have two replicants okay

135
00:08:36,620 --> 00:08:46,680
conservation agriculture possession but

136
00:08:44,939 --> 00:08:50,759
okay you have these data you have these

137
00:08:46,680 --> 00:08:54,329
differences so what is the effect of

138
00:08:50,759 --> 00:08:58,620
these different on microbial populations

139
00:08:54,329 --> 00:09:02,189
and this is a principal component

140
00:08:58,620 --> 00:09:05,999
analysis and it's a you try to get all

141
00:09:02,189 --> 00:09:19,279
your data on bacterial groups you try to

142
00:09:05,999 --> 00:09:22,999
correlate them or whatever so a

143
00:09:19,279 --> 00:09:27,029
separation between permanent vets

144
00:09:22,999 --> 00:09:29,699
between conventional birds and what do

145
00:09:27,029 --> 00:09:37,009
you get in in conventional vets you get

146
00:09:29,699 --> 00:09:39,480
copy of drops fresh organic material

147
00:09:37,009 --> 00:09:46,259
consumed it that they're graded them in

148
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:52,949
ER allows it to organisms that neutral

149
00:09:46,259 --> 00:09:55,589
depleted its might be questionable as a

150
00:09:52,949 --> 00:09:56,970
word because normally it has more to do

151
00:09:55,589 --> 00:10:00,720
with nutrients down the foreground

152
00:09:56,970 --> 00:10:04,769
epithelial but Auto for organic material

153
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,809
so if there is a microbiologist followed

154
00:10:04,769 --> 00:10:08,990
up using that because some people are

155
00:10:06,809 --> 00:10:08,990
very

156
00:10:15,900 --> 00:10:54,490
yep Fermi could the agriculture

157
00:10:52,300 --> 00:10:57,490
practices do you affect our markable

158
00:10:54,490 --> 00:11:02,410
populations as I meant to permanent bats

159
00:10:57,490 --> 00:11:05,680
they favor these groups which are only

160
00:11:02,410 --> 00:11:06,640
go trough stat prefer nothing this is

161
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,070
the opposite

162
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:11,050
they prefer our nutrient rich this

163
00:11:09,070 --> 00:11:13,900
should be reversed but anyway and then

164
00:11:11,050 --> 00:11:18,070
we have conventional bats where we get

165
00:11:13,900 --> 00:11:19,990
these organisms that prefer organic rich

166
00:11:18,070 --> 00:11:31,470
environments why because if you have

167
00:11:19,990 --> 00:11:31,470
conventional bets then you deal on top

168
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:59,340
ok sampling in 2012 2014 we'll get the

169
00:11:56,260 --> 00:12:01,900
same results permanent bats preferred by

170
00:11:59,340 --> 00:12:06,760
oligotrophic preferred they are favored

171
00:12:01,900 --> 00:12:09,360
and if you go to conventional practices

172
00:12:06,760 --> 00:12:09,360
conventional

173
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:15,330
um I always have questions is this for

174
00:12:14,220 --> 00:12:18,030
real

175
00:12:15,330 --> 00:12:20,430
do you have changes over time or my

176
00:12:18,030 --> 00:12:22,650
results correct because your was a

177
00:12:20,430 --> 00:12:25,920
problem often and what do I mean by

178
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:29,660
technique the when we did these first

179
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:33,150
analysis we had clones we had about 150

180
00:12:29,660 --> 00:12:37,550
sequences of DNA and then we went to a

181
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:40,620
biro which is about a hundred thousand

182
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:43,620
sequences and now we go to Illumina and

183
00:12:40,620 --> 00:12:46,920
we can talk about whatever you want 400

184
00:12:43,620 --> 00:13:05,250
million two hundred so the question is

185
00:12:46,920 --> 00:13:11,660
always there's an evolution okay now so

186
00:13:05,250 --> 00:13:13,890
what we start experiment is here trying

187
00:13:11,660 --> 00:13:16,860
salt samples over the year

188
00:13:13,890 --> 00:13:18,420
and we want to look at population we try

189
00:13:16,860 --> 00:13:21,600
to look at certain processes also

190
00:13:18,420 --> 00:13:22,740
because it's one of the critiques you

191
00:13:21,600 --> 00:13:25,770
can have on this work it's very

192
00:13:22,740 --> 00:13:27,450
descriptive descriptive what this is all

193
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,400
about what you're really doing what is

194
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,990
the importance of all this and I will

195
00:13:29,400 --> 00:13:32,910
say we try to start with getting the

196
00:13:30,990 --> 00:13:35,880
techniques right and then we can start

197
00:13:32,910 --> 00:13:37,770
to focus on some questions we have so

198
00:13:35,880 --> 00:13:40,770
I'll mention some some questions at the

199
00:13:37,770 --> 00:13:45,170
end of my talk but we want to focus on

200
00:13:40,770 --> 00:13:50,310
on or nitrification and functionality

201
00:13:45,170 --> 00:13:52,190
functionality are all RNA from a soul is

202
00:13:50,310 --> 00:13:55,020
very difficult if you look at literature

203
00:13:52,190 --> 00:13:59,430
you will find some papers on it but very

204
00:13:55,020 --> 00:14:02,610
little problem is solo conditions and we

205
00:13:59,430 --> 00:14:05,190
are very lucky that Obregon we succeed

206
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:08,430
in extracting Parana in Elberton forget

207
00:14:05,190 --> 00:14:12,140
about it so you check the literature

208
00:14:08,430 --> 00:14:17,300
it's the same week I mentioned bacteria

209
00:14:12,140 --> 00:14:20,300
because extract or amplifying DNA from

210
00:14:17,300 --> 00:14:20,300
fungi

211
00:14:21,050 --> 00:14:27,529
Ryota is not so easy RK are we can do it

212
00:14:24,800 --> 00:14:30,110
but it's a borderline so look at the

213
00:14:27,529 --> 00:14:33,019
literature you will see some papers but

214
00:14:30,110 --> 00:14:36,850
if you try to compare because NL in we

215
00:14:33,019 --> 00:14:40,970
published a paper on fungi in Sonora and

216
00:14:36,850 --> 00:14:43,760
microscopic eukaryota there's nothing to

217
00:14:40,970 --> 00:14:46,100
compare it really somewhere it's okay

218
00:14:43,760 --> 00:14:52,880
you have some but microscopic areata

219
00:14:46,100 --> 00:14:56,180
very little okay if we have the question

220
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:58,339
about copier tropes and not of Stan my

221
00:14:56,180 --> 00:15:00,440
idea was we got organic material if we

222
00:14:58,339 --> 00:15:03,320
got organic me too available

223
00:15:00,440 --> 00:15:08,329
we'll get some copy at Rose the writers

224
00:15:03,320 --> 00:15:12,890
is normally organic carbon so what we're

225
00:15:08,329 --> 00:15:15,589
trying to do all of these two behaving

226
00:15:12,890 --> 00:15:25,610
in fear there's a lot of organic comedy

227
00:15:15,589 --> 00:15:28,970
correct environments and also we apply

228
00:15:25,610 --> 00:15:31,910
organic material crop residue to the

229
00:15:28,970 --> 00:15:36,770
soil who is going to degrade eat an

230
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:39,050
organic material okay this is still a

231
00:15:36,770 --> 00:15:43,520
recent and I haven't gone into all the

232
00:15:39,050 --> 00:15:48,950
details but we did we met pollution

233
00:15:43,520 --> 00:15:51,980
vegetative flowering gratefully so the

234
00:15:48,950 --> 00:15:54,940
Pope's whole versus free this dynamics a

235
00:15:51,980 --> 00:16:00,550
bit and then again they saw a lot of

236
00:15:54,940 --> 00:16:06,199
rolling track development I with sass

237
00:16:00,550 --> 00:16:10,670
and people convinced me that error it's

238
00:16:06,199 --> 00:16:13,070
much better it is a magnificent tool but

239
00:16:10,670 --> 00:16:15,529
it takes some time first to adjust to it

240
00:16:13,070 --> 00:16:18,230
because sass is very straightforward

241
00:16:15,529 --> 00:16:21,529
errors it's strange if you're not used

242
00:16:18,230 --> 00:16:24,589
to it another problem see with I can do

243
00:16:21,529 --> 00:16:26,480
this dis graph so well the results were

244
00:16:24,589 --> 00:16:28,010
obtained in our eye and then put it in

245
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:31,810
Excel because I don't like the graphs

246
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:33,950
but you have about six or set packages

247
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:37,700
that can do this

248
00:16:33,950 --> 00:16:39,290
and it's I get lost sometimes that's

249
00:16:37,700 --> 00:16:44,260
easy it's straightforward towards the

250
00:16:39,290 --> 00:16:47,240
same but to edit it's all these

251
00:16:44,260 --> 00:16:49,430
biological techniques they don't exist

252
00:16:47,240 --> 00:16:50,390
and in error you've got all these

253
00:16:49,430 --> 00:16:54,590
updates

254
00:16:50,390 --> 00:16:58,480
well daily I think so my advice is

255
00:16:54,590 --> 00:17:02,120
people really want to want to work in

256
00:16:58,480 --> 00:17:03,440
bio informatics go to arrow or fight

257
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:04,760
them I don't know fight them because

258
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:08,150
they're trying to convince me also to

259
00:17:04,760 --> 00:17:10,000
start working in frightened I don't know

260
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:14,810
pursue me I will end up doing it but

261
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:17,480
anyway but then we get we get some clear

262
00:17:14,810 --> 00:17:21,740
changes again in population in the

263
00:17:17,480 --> 00:17:30,500
rhizosphere so are they holds more or

264
00:17:21,740 --> 00:17:32,450
less it's there in in error sure if it

265
00:17:30,500 --> 00:17:35,780
will all give better results but and

266
00:17:32,450 --> 00:17:38,240
this is also very recent although I

267
00:17:35,780 --> 00:17:39,680
think the program of this was they

268
00:17:38,240 --> 00:17:43,430
started to write it when we were in

269
00:17:39,680 --> 00:17:49,390
Oakridge they mentioned it this is where

270
00:17:43,430 --> 00:17:51,880
you've got your bacteria identified with

271
00:17:49,390 --> 00:17:54,830
ribosome al DNA sorry

272
00:17:51,880 --> 00:17:59,000
and then you try to link these

273
00:17:54,830 --> 00:18:02,240
populations to functions and that is

274
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:08,150
very interesting because although as you

275
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:10,940
go six hundred or thousand species lobby

276
00:18:08,150 --> 00:18:13,040
hell what are they doing okay I know

277
00:18:10,940 --> 00:18:16,580
Posse lose and I know so don't wanna

278
00:18:13,040 --> 00:18:19,910
know akise and I know that but this

279
00:18:16,580 --> 00:18:22,460
becomes interesting now I think that

280
00:18:19,910 --> 00:18:24,380
Bala ping it because Aaron R is not so

281
00:18:22,460 --> 00:18:31,090
easy to extract but I hope we can link

282
00:18:24,380 --> 00:18:31,090
this with Erina ah this is he

283
00:18:34,350 --> 00:18:45,750
I think of Tillich but I said it's just

284
00:18:41,009 --> 00:18:48,720
I did it two days ago and then this is

285
00:18:45,750 --> 00:18:50,730
another experiment - from these are

286
00:18:48,720 --> 00:18:54,210
Cubase over time so if you see these

287
00:18:50,730 --> 00:19:00,450
seven and fourteen normally we have

288
00:18:54,210 --> 00:19:03,210
about 260 250 data points and then you

289
00:19:00,450 --> 00:19:04,830
see here we are added being material and

290
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:07,500
this is on the mend it and then you see

291
00:19:04,830 --> 00:19:09,899
that the beam the population is a shift

292
00:19:07,500 --> 00:19:11,610
in pollution the story is I apply

293
00:19:09,899 --> 00:19:14,570
organic material and there's a shift in

294
00:19:11,610 --> 00:19:27,000
my population okay

295
00:19:14,570 --> 00:19:39,360
as I said we can confirm Earth as always

296
00:19:27,000 --> 00:19:41,820
once you get some answers they define

297
00:19:39,360 --> 00:19:43,740
certain groups as being oligo troughs

298
00:19:41,820 --> 00:19:47,340
and certain groups being copy of troughs

299
00:19:43,740 --> 00:19:49,230
and then you you compare RT no bacteria

300
00:19:47,340 --> 00:19:51,600
this group what is it micro focus area

301
00:19:49,230 --> 00:19:54,000
and then you've got here Gail Alessia

302
00:19:51,600 --> 00:19:57,240
and then you see these are favored by

303
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:01,129
organic material you apply and the

304
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:01,129
others not so yeah

305
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:10,380
you

306
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:21,890
so I think it would be rather difficult

307
00:20:17,059 --> 00:20:25,730
to say that one bacterial group has

308
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:28,760
these characteristics I have to mention

309
00:20:25,730 --> 00:20:31,490
when we go to species in bacteria then

310
00:20:28,760 --> 00:20:34,490
we talk about 97% of similitude

311
00:20:31,490 --> 00:20:37,160
similarly to dia we differ from

312
00:20:34,490 --> 00:20:40,610
chimpanzees I think zero three percent

313
00:20:37,160 --> 00:20:46,429
so what are we talking about really okay

314
00:20:40,610 --> 00:20:50,150
but we are aware of this problem but we

315
00:20:46,429 --> 00:20:52,280
should sometimes not forget it okay

316
00:20:50,150 --> 00:20:54,049
as I mentioned these groups are very

317
00:20:52,280 --> 00:20:56,480
easy to isolate so they are well

318
00:20:54,049 --> 00:20:58,340
described but in a soil they are

319
00:20:56,480 --> 00:21:00,559
normally not that important only three

320
00:20:58,340 --> 00:21:02,870
percent of them and we got the other

321
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:06,110
bacillus of five percent so what is all

322
00:21:02,870 --> 00:21:09,740
the rest do we one of the other problems

323
00:21:06,110 --> 00:21:13,309
when we write these papers than normally

324
00:21:09,740 --> 00:21:15,980
we mentioned about 15 groups at the

325
00:21:13,309 --> 00:21:22,580
maximum and normally you found between

326
00:21:15,980 --> 00:21:25,039
500 and thousand sinners so what all the

327
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:26,990
rest is doing we don't know and we don't

328
00:21:25,039 --> 00:21:28,580
even want to talk about it because we

329
00:21:26,990 --> 00:21:32,270
would go the pit get a paper off I don't

330
00:21:28,580 --> 00:21:34,190
know how many pages but anyway so would

331
00:21:32,270 --> 00:21:37,970
you the question was would sort

332
00:21:34,190 --> 00:21:40,220
characteristics affect our behavior of

333
00:21:37,970 --> 00:21:44,409
groups when we apply ionic materials who

334
00:21:40,220 --> 00:21:44,409
we apply organic material in one system

335
00:21:44,919 --> 00:21:50,750
permanent pets so we would hope that

336
00:21:47,570 --> 00:21:53,600
this group which is acido bacteria ie

337
00:21:50,750 --> 00:21:56,210
this is a very important group but we

338
00:21:53,600 --> 00:21:58,789
don't know actually what it is doing and

339
00:21:56,210 --> 00:22:02,059
then you see in employment that's when

340
00:21:58,789 --> 00:22:04,190
you apply beam material their relative

341
00:22:02,059 --> 00:22:08,450
abundance increases when you apply it to

342
00:22:04,190 --> 00:22:11,000
a conventional but it's an effect or so

343
00:22:08,450 --> 00:22:14,470
characteristic so we wanted to have some

344
00:22:11,000 --> 00:22:17,990
sort of a bit more diverse to see how

345
00:22:14,470 --> 00:22:23,540
different bacterias group respond to and

346
00:22:17,990 --> 00:22:23,909
this we used to janaba and we used to

347
00:22:23,540 --> 00:22:28,469
take

348
00:22:23,909 --> 00:22:31,489
Coco and now this is quite nice so you

349
00:22:28,469 --> 00:22:38,279
get a complete separation of your

350
00:22:31,489 --> 00:22:40,709
different groups oh yeah one of the

351
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:44,369
problems I have is with economical

352
00:22:40,709 --> 00:22:47,309
correlations when I do a principal

353
00:22:44,369 --> 00:22:50,729
component analysis it's very nice

354
00:22:47,309 --> 00:22:54,209
I go to canonical and it's not so nice

355
00:22:50,729 --> 00:22:56,909
so my explanation is there is a factor

356
00:22:54,209 --> 00:23:01,559
of defining this that I can't or I don't

357
00:22:56,909 --> 00:23:03,389
measure it or is it that it's important

358
00:23:01,559 --> 00:23:06,419
or its interaction between my

359
00:23:03,389 --> 00:23:08,849
populations in the given environment but

360
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:12,809
I mean I said I would mention the

361
00:23:08,849 --> 00:23:16,529
problems I see but okay I think we can

362
00:23:12,809 --> 00:23:21,229
on this system and the different

363
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:27,149
ecosystems now you have the chinampa

364
00:23:21,229 --> 00:23:30,539
barton Texcoco i Tyrael how are these

365
00:23:27,149 --> 00:23:34,469
groups respond Tyrael and then you see

366
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:36,289
Tillett it's increasing why it gives the

367
00:23:34,469 --> 00:23:38,989
organic material that's very well known

368
00:23:36,289 --> 00:23:44,299
but then you start to see these groups

369
00:23:38,989 --> 00:23:48,569
like oh think I missed that one this

370
00:23:44,299 --> 00:23:52,289
which is rather well known and normally

371
00:23:48,569 --> 00:23:54,569
it is a copy of drove however and this

372
00:23:52,289 --> 00:23:56,669
system index KOCO one outlaw organic

373
00:23:54,569 --> 00:23:58,819
material it participates in the

374
00:23:56,669 --> 00:24:01,079
degradation of the organic material and

375
00:23:58,819 --> 00:24:05,099
when our look hotel our tongue

376
00:24:01,079 --> 00:24:07,229
not at all so conclusion these groups

377
00:24:05,099 --> 00:24:09,599
adapt themselves or they add them at a

378
00:24:07,229 --> 00:24:11,309
bullet metabolic capacity but the

379
00:24:09,599 --> 00:24:14,339
environment the competition with other

380
00:24:11,309 --> 00:24:19,699
groups defines how they respond yeah

381
00:24:14,339 --> 00:24:19,699
so what we made a little

382
00:24:21,240 --> 00:24:27,960
which organisms fit along a gradient so

383
00:24:24,720 --> 00:24:30,060
we apply here some organic material and

384
00:24:27,960 --> 00:24:34,080
we measured populations they want they

385
00:24:30,060 --> 00:24:35,610
freely 7 14 28 256 and then you see the

386
00:24:34,080 --> 00:24:39,210
groups that were favored their relative

387
00:24:35,610 --> 00:24:41,250
abundance increase Allah - and they've a

388
00:24:39,210 --> 00:24:44,790
good button down we see it in normal

389
00:24:41,250 --> 00:24:47,970
basileus and some step two misses so

390
00:24:44,790 --> 00:24:55,020
long yeah but you see there are

391
00:24:47,970 --> 00:24:57,390
different groups it or faith or okay I

392
00:24:55,020 --> 00:24:59,330
think I remember if I remember correctly

393
00:24:57,390 --> 00:25:03,780
teacher said that theory and soil

394
00:24:59,330 --> 00:25:06,000
normally keep genetic capacity they

395
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:08,700
don't shed so much of the capacity as

396
00:25:06,000 --> 00:25:16,020
you will see in the reactor or in my

397
00:25:08,700 --> 00:25:19,380
stomach genes in so this is again three

398
00:25:16,020 --> 00:25:22,650
systems in material they get a shift in

399
00:25:19,380 --> 00:25:25,260
your population okay

400
00:25:22,650 --> 00:25:27,170
as I mentioned very well very nice you

401
00:25:25,260 --> 00:25:32,720
got beautiful

402
00:25:27,170 --> 00:25:32,720
bcoz you say oh we've got a shift but

403
00:25:35,240 --> 00:25:40,950
can we learn for all this first of all I

404
00:25:38,160 --> 00:25:43,530
think cooking techniques to specific

405
00:25:40,950 --> 00:25:45,390
questions are one of the specific

406
00:25:43,530 --> 00:25:51,920
questions we were trying to address now

407
00:25:45,390 --> 00:25:51,920
is in Obregon it's a problem with sewing

408
00:25:53,960 --> 00:26:05,130
that my nation plant emerges and plan to

409
00:26:02,520 --> 00:26:08,040
stand decreased on the dry sowing but

410
00:26:05,130 --> 00:26:10,590
not in wet conditions so we retreat them

411
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:15,240
with four pesticides or herbicides or

412
00:26:10,590 --> 00:26:17,430
whatever insecticides fungicides done so

413
00:26:15,240 --> 00:26:19,620
we assume it is a problem there with so

414
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:22,350
I think with all these techniques we now

415
00:26:19,620 --> 00:26:27,380
have we try to look if it's really a

416
00:26:22,350 --> 00:26:27,380
biological problem or facing ok

417
00:26:28,570 --> 00:26:39,890
well that's not that difficult but this

418
00:26:33,200 --> 00:26:42,080
is not that easy so conditions there are

419
00:26:39,890 --> 00:26:45,170
some people extracting method anomic

420
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:48,070
sore where you pay a lot extract all the

421
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:53,360
DNA and then you'll know is everything

422
00:26:48,070 --> 00:26:55,100
yeah it's rather cost costs a bit but

423
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,780
then you need and I'll mention that

424
00:26:55,100 --> 00:27:00,200
later on when you need to computer power

425
00:26:56,780 --> 00:27:03,740
and your knowledge to all these species

426
00:27:00,200 --> 00:27:07,010
of 300 or 100 DNA spares to link them

427
00:27:03,740 --> 00:27:12,050
that's not that easy neither but anyway

428
00:27:07,010 --> 00:27:18,890
were working on as I mentioned as and

429
00:27:12,050 --> 00:27:21,260
then another study we started this to

430
00:27:18,890 --> 00:27:25,100
look at our populations why do we look

431
00:27:21,260 --> 00:27:26,780
at different years were related to trace

432
00:27:25,100 --> 00:27:29,570
gas emission greenhouse gas emission

433
00:27:26,780 --> 00:27:32,000
nitrous oxide why do we focus on like

434
00:27:29,570 --> 00:27:35,210
two fires and not on the United occasion

435
00:27:32,000 --> 00:27:37,940
and all that many so we try to focus on

436
00:27:35,210 --> 00:27:40,910
something that is Raleigh's study

437
00:27:37,940 --> 00:27:43,130
additionally the genes or the yeah the

438
00:27:40,910 --> 00:27:48,050
proteins involved in the process or

439
00:27:43,130 --> 00:27:50,990
rather limited however for instance mor

440
00:27:48,050 --> 00:27:52,340
which mon IAM mono oxygenase on or i

441
00:27:50,990 --> 00:27:54,620
thought there was one now they're

442
00:27:52,340 --> 00:27:55,910
already three different types so if you

443
00:27:54,620 --> 00:27:57,740
want to look at these things these

444
00:27:55,910 --> 00:28:01,250
processes you have to consider all the

445
00:27:57,740 --> 00:28:02,900
possible genes so we're looking at we

446
00:28:01,250 --> 00:28:06,320
are looking at permanent as conventional

447
00:28:02,900 --> 00:28:09,190
burnt and then we have minus and plus we

448
00:28:06,320 --> 00:28:12,860
want to measure this this is a first

449
00:28:09,190 --> 00:28:17,080
preliminary experiment with ammonium to

450
00:28:12,860 --> 00:28:17,080
these different sites and what we when

451
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:23,960
applied in the field that then you see

452
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:26,480
that a lot of oxidation of ammonium so

453
00:28:23,960 --> 00:28:30,400
you have a rather vivid or active

454
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:32,740
notifier population which is not that

455
00:28:30,400 --> 00:28:34,420
yeah

456
00:28:32,740 --> 00:28:36,610
okay we want to measure we've measured

457
00:28:34,420 --> 00:28:38,230
that we want to measure these gases we

458
00:28:36,610 --> 00:28:40,929
want to measure biomass we go for

459
00:28:38,230 --> 00:28:43,420
microbial structure nitrifiers this is

460
00:28:40,929 --> 00:28:45,429
not that complicated as I mentioned you

461
00:28:43,420 --> 00:28:48,010
already have three of them I don't know

462
00:28:45,429 --> 00:29:10,570
how many I have of these but then we

463
00:28:48,010 --> 00:29:13,090
want to if you can 90% of the activity

464
00:29:10,570 --> 00:29:14,620
is normal activity of the organisms it's

465
00:29:13,090 --> 00:29:17,470
not related to the process you're

466
00:29:14,620 --> 00:29:20,820
studying got a bit of a needle and not

467
00:29:17,470 --> 00:29:20,820
think so

468
00:29:23,890 --> 00:29:29,050
it's too evident so we're trying to work

469
00:29:26,200 --> 00:29:32,559
on that um one of the things I haven't

470
00:29:29,050 --> 00:29:36,220
mentioned yet but I think with all the

471
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:38,590
changes in techniques we have what I

472
00:29:36,220 --> 00:29:39,940
mentioned it we start 150 clones then we

473
00:29:38,590 --> 00:29:41,890
went to a hundred thousand and now I

474
00:29:39,940 --> 00:29:44,910
don't know how many to two hundred

475
00:29:41,890 --> 00:29:52,390
million you need a bit of computer power

476
00:29:44,910 --> 00:29:55,270
and we only starting so we will start

477
00:29:52,390 --> 00:29:59,260
now since yesterday I think finally

478
00:29:55,270 --> 00:30:01,300
after two years of negotiating we can

479
00:29:59,260 --> 00:30:03,600
have a new option within the department

480
00:30:01,300 --> 00:30:06,580
which will focus on bioinformatics

481
00:30:03,600 --> 00:30:09,040
statistics and supercomputing one of the

482
00:30:06,580 --> 00:30:14,320
problems I see in statistics personally

483
00:30:09,040 --> 00:30:16,179
if time series I mean if you have a

484
00:30:14,320 --> 00:30:17,890
change over time how do you compare this

485
00:30:16,179 --> 00:30:20,050
population what we normally do what

486
00:30:17,890 --> 00:30:21,790
Richard Webster always told me you just

487
00:30:20,050 --> 00:30:23,170
take them in and you compare the mean

488
00:30:21,790 --> 00:30:26,320
and there will be enough and forget

489
00:30:23,170 --> 00:30:30,100
about all the rest but I think we need

490
00:30:26,320 --> 00:30:33,100
it some some just that supercomputers

491
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:37,650
simply to get your make the genome meet

492
00:30:33,100 --> 00:30:40,540
a genome together bioinformatics yeah

493
00:30:37,650 --> 00:30:42,730
there's a lot of dispute about the

494
00:30:40,540 --> 00:30:45,440
systems you've got your secrets and then

495
00:30:42,730 --> 00:30:48,890
you have different system

496
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:52,370
verify or check identify the organisms

497
00:30:48,890 --> 00:30:54,260
it belonged to and so you have sir NAL's

498
00:30:52,370 --> 00:30:56,260
that say we want that system Europeans

499
00:30:54,260 --> 00:31:00,920
normally go for the European system

500
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:04,460
America the American system and but

501
00:31:00,920 --> 00:31:08,240
anyway that's another of the questions

502
00:31:04,460 --> 00:31:09,830
we have and then another thing we will

503
00:31:08,240 --> 00:31:12,110
try to do is we did a lot of these

504
00:31:09,830 --> 00:31:13,880
experiments organic material copier

505
00:31:12,110 --> 00:31:17,260
troughs oligotrophic you want to get it

506
00:31:13,880 --> 00:31:20,750
all together it's about 20 experiments

507
00:31:17,260 --> 00:31:23,750
we want to compare and see if all these

508
00:31:20,750 --> 00:31:26,690
data we have some bitty bit of meta data

509
00:31:23,750 --> 00:31:32,960
mining see we can get something out okay

510
00:31:26,690 --> 00:31:37,130
that's or at the moment I must admit as

511
00:31:32,960 --> 00:31:40,310
you can see this is not my work cover a

512
00:31:37,130 --> 00:31:43,780
lot of people and I haven't mentioned

513
00:31:40,310 --> 00:31:46,760
them all but would like to fight them

514
00:31:43,780 --> 00:31:49,280
one of the advantages I think with the

515
00:31:46,760 --> 00:31:50,540
Mexico we have a lot of people that's

516
00:31:49,280 --> 00:31:54,650
for sure a lot of very enthusiastic

517
00:31:50,540 --> 00:31:57,580
people very capable people funding is

518
00:31:54,650 --> 00:32:02,710
not always that easy but ok we get along

519
00:31:57,580 --> 00:32:06,560
and we have no access is to booster

520
00:32:02,710 --> 00:32:09,290
sophisticated equipment but ok these

521
00:32:06,560 --> 00:32:15,470
sequences we Santa Marta micro gent

522
00:32:09,290 --> 00:32:21,620
Korea about the German group who now

523
00:32:15,470 --> 00:32:24,710
extract DNA from soil from our ancestors

524
00:32:21,620 --> 00:32:27,440
and have you read about that that now

525
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:30,470
they can extract DNA from so because lbn

526
00:32:27,440 --> 00:32:33,500
a doesn't agree date and so so you it is

527
00:32:30,470 --> 00:32:37,760
preserved so we if you look at the under

528
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:41,330
talus where they walked yeah we can find

529
00:32:37,760 --> 00:32:43,460
traces of this DNA only mention it the

530
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:46,430
amount of soil you meet to do this is

531
00:32:43,460 --> 00:32:49,280
not 20 grams like you do in the bottom

532
00:32:46,430 --> 00:32:51,170
but a huge amount and what these sorry

533
00:32:49,280 --> 00:32:55,110
these Germans have they developed a

534
00:32:51,170 --> 00:33:01,110
robot so you can assess so

535
00:32:55,110 --> 00:33:02,820
process an enormous amount of what we

536
00:33:01,110 --> 00:33:07,970
have the people they have the robot we

537
00:33:02,820 --> 00:33:07,970
have been 20th time robot will be cheap

538
00:33:08,120 --> 00:33:17,730
all the rest will be rather expensive

539
00:33:10,230 --> 00:33:19,559
Belen I would be very - for the field

540
00:33:17,730 --> 00:33:25,650
experiment I think what Brom mentioned

541
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:27,630
is is true it's a unique yeah

542
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:30,540
a unique experiment when I answer these

543
00:33:27,630 --> 00:33:34,380
question two replicates I always say

544
00:33:30,540 --> 00:33:37,290
it's the only field experiment in the

545
00:33:34,380 --> 00:33:39,450
tropics that I have access to okay there

546
00:33:37,290 --> 00:33:41,850
- replicates but well maintained

547
00:33:39,450 --> 00:33:46,710
experiments for more than 25 years

548
00:33:41,850 --> 00:33:49,410
correct bro don't find them so if you

549
00:33:46,710 --> 00:33:52,410
will study these things okay it might be

550
00:33:49,410 --> 00:33:54,330
useless I'm not sure then you need

551
00:33:52,410 --> 00:33:56,460
something you can rely on it's well done

552
00:33:54,330 --> 00:33:58,470
because if you go into the field and we

553
00:33:56,460 --> 00:34:03,950
compare whatever little bot done what we

554
00:33:58,470 --> 00:34:07,550
compare forests the variation is huge

555
00:34:03,950 --> 00:34:13,440
you know if you don't know what they did

556
00:34:07,550 --> 00:34:16,260
so I am grateful it and also when the

557
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,470
money thought they were more than

558
00:34:16,260 --> 00:34:24,300
willing to help me I am in depth to see

559
00:34:19,470 --> 00:34:27,560
this stuff for the infrastructure and of

560
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:33,859
course corners it was very generous with

561
00:34:27,560 --> 00:34:33,859
funding us I think that's it yep

562
00:34:38,280 --> 00:34:44,649
[Applause]

563
00:34:40,950 --> 00:34:46,750
things look and even that I was involved

564
00:34:44,649 --> 00:34:48,579
in in the work I still got some new

565
00:34:46,750 --> 00:34:52,289
ideas by seeing it presented like that

566
00:34:48,579 --> 00:34:56,099
so as always you keep us on our toes any

567
00:34:52,289 --> 00:34:58,839
questions from the from the audience

568
00:34:56,099 --> 00:35:00,880
please use the microphones because we

569
00:34:58,839 --> 00:35:04,420
have over I don't know how many people

570
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:07,049
but several connected via the webinar so

571
00:35:04,420 --> 00:35:09,010
if you can use the microphone even I

572
00:35:07,049 --> 00:35:11,950
look hi

573
00:35:09,010 --> 00:35:14,650
very interesting I I think I might have

574
00:35:11,950 --> 00:35:17,529
missed when you collect your soil

575
00:35:14,650 --> 00:35:19,660
samples to do your extractions what

576
00:35:17,529 --> 00:35:22,420
depth or from what part of the soil are

577
00:35:19,660 --> 00:35:24,940
those soils we normally we normally work

578
00:35:22,420 --> 00:35:28,000
on the topsoil layer why we do that is

579
00:35:24,940 --> 00:35:29,589
because we hope with the biggest

580
00:35:28,000 --> 00:35:32,109
diversity I know there are papers

581
00:35:29,589 --> 00:35:34,450
published that you have to be careful

582
00:35:32,109 --> 00:35:36,970
with the proof well I I'm well aware of

583
00:35:34,450 --> 00:35:40,089
that but it's it all has to do with

584
00:35:36,970 --> 00:35:44,680
where do you want to focus on if I said

585
00:35:40,089 --> 00:35:48,460
200 samples to analyze if I would go

586
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:54,700
into profiles tonight I get lost it's a

587
00:35:48,460 --> 00:35:57,490
little always trying to 0 to 20 0 to 15

588
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:59,940
C to 10 to 20 it depends it depends a

589
00:35:57,490 --> 00:36:03,690
bit yeah but nobody's here written I

590
00:35:59,940 --> 00:36:05,880
don't know you could go back to the soil

591
00:36:03,690 --> 00:36:08,829
tests of the three different locations

592
00:36:05,880 --> 00:36:27,670
yeah I don't know if I thought this KOCO

593
00:36:08,829 --> 00:36:30,299
with a pH is it to acetic acidic pH 9 is

594
00:36:27,670 --> 00:36:34,180
not here at this station right what this

595
00:36:30,299 --> 00:36:36,069
oh no no no oh sorry oh yes okay I have

596
00:36:34,180 --> 00:36:38,289
to explain this because you you have

597
00:36:36,069 --> 00:36:40,809
this differences in in air bottom we see

598
00:36:38,289 --> 00:36:44,920
a difference and so we see an effect of

599
00:36:40,809 --> 00:36:48,059
what we do on our population so to to

600
00:36:44,920 --> 00:36:51,109
stress to to go in an excess of

601
00:36:48,059 --> 00:36:53,509
variation we were too

602
00:36:51,109 --> 00:36:59,479
Sol's in the area it's a chinampa it's

603
00:36:53,509 --> 00:37:01,999
in Xochimilco Texcoco you you got nine

604
00:36:59,479 --> 00:37:05,479
point four which is not a lot because in

605
00:37:01,999 --> 00:37:10,819
texcoco we have ten point five but we do

606
00:37:05,479 --> 00:37:13,819
not do go to be too extreme yeah it's a

607
00:37:10,819 --> 00:37:17,660
tech school it's it like yeah yeah and

608
00:37:13,819 --> 00:37:20,989
and you have a huge salinity also the

609
00:37:17,660 --> 00:37:38,650
lot of studies of context Coco that's

610
00:37:20,989 --> 00:37:42,769
why I sorry say yeah yeah sorry

611
00:37:38,650 --> 00:37:44,900
one last question no no what's your view

612
00:37:42,769 --> 00:37:52,039
on these bio fertilizers that are

613
00:37:44,900 --> 00:37:55,190
dealing with these bacteria well this is

614
00:37:52,039 --> 00:37:57,920
not my well it's personal but I'm not

615
00:37:55,190 --> 00:38:01,609
the only one who would say that I

616
00:37:57,920 --> 00:38:04,699
remember David Jenkinson say and I

617
00:38:01,609 --> 00:38:06,979
remember Martin Alexander saying that I

618
00:38:04,699 --> 00:38:09,199
agree completely I think it would be

619
00:38:06,979 --> 00:38:11,150
very difficult to there that there are

620
00:38:09,199 --> 00:38:12,739
two reasons first of all you have an

621
00:38:11,150 --> 00:38:15,249
equilibrium you have a system in

622
00:38:12,739 --> 00:38:19,670
equilibrium you apply something

623
00:38:15,249 --> 00:38:22,819
organisms second if you have a soil you

624
00:38:19,670 --> 00:38:24,109
apply it how are you going to apply it

625
00:38:22,819 --> 00:38:28,489
where you need it

626
00:38:24,109 --> 00:38:31,279
I can imagine you fertilize a seat and

627
00:38:28,489 --> 00:38:33,559
then you hope we did some experiments we

628
00:38:31,279 --> 00:38:36,529
did an experiment bath serum and it was

629
00:38:33,559 --> 00:38:39,349
fantastic it was the best we had an

630
00:38:36,529 --> 00:38:41,479
effect for one month on the roots and

631
00:38:39,349 --> 00:38:46,009
that was it I'm actually doing

632
00:38:41,479 --> 00:38:50,630
experiment with mace one of the farmers

633
00:38:46,009 --> 00:38:54,979
who has this brilliant system of bio

634
00:38:50,630 --> 00:38:57,589
fertilizer and and we sterilized is

635
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:58,940
consortium and in the beginning the

636
00:38:57,589 --> 00:39:01,789
sterilized consortium gave better

637
00:38:58,940 --> 00:39:03,829
results than the consortium there's

638
00:39:01,789 --> 00:39:05,480
another reason why I'm very skeptical

639
00:39:03,829 --> 00:39:08,480
for this experiment we took the

640
00:39:05,480 --> 00:39:10,790
literature check the literature and it

641
00:39:08,480 --> 00:39:14,980
tells you quite a lot where was it

642
00:39:10,790 --> 00:39:16,849
published which journals was published I

643
00:39:14,980 --> 00:39:22,400
get very doubtful

644
00:39:16,849 --> 00:39:24,859
I remember in Berlin Berlin but it was

645
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:27,140
cut off flocek with also superior in

646
00:39:24,859 --> 00:39:28,640
brazil and i had a positive result so

647
00:39:27,140 --> 00:39:33,319
they published it and it could never

648
00:39:28,640 --> 00:39:36,079
repeat it so I am but the expendable

649
00:39:33,319 --> 00:39:39,109
doing is we using these techniques we

650
00:39:36,079 --> 00:39:40,400
have now to look more at survived so we

651
00:39:39,109 --> 00:39:43,849
have this consortium will characterize

652
00:39:40,400 --> 00:39:45,950
it will see what is happening problem is

653
00:39:43,849 --> 00:39:48,050
always okay I'm working in green house

654
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:49,400
because if I do it in a field and again

655
00:39:48,050 --> 00:39:52,609
you know the problems in the field

656
00:39:49,400 --> 00:39:54,470
people do thinks he don't know one of

657
00:39:52,609 --> 00:39:56,599
the other that's the reason why I prefer

658
00:39:54,470 --> 00:40:03,920
to work with cement we started to work

659
00:39:56,599 --> 00:40:05,630
with somebody yeah in route to correct

660
00:40:03,920 --> 00:40:07,700
our room I don't remember the name

661
00:40:05,630 --> 00:40:10,040
typically be bugged Apache I don't

662
00:40:07,700 --> 00:40:11,930
remember the village and and you try to

663
00:40:10,040 --> 00:40:14,240
collaborate and then they call you and

664
00:40:11,930 --> 00:40:20,359
they say only we fertilized yeah do you

665
00:40:14,240 --> 00:40:22,160
have sample so you can't and that's also

666
00:40:20,359 --> 00:40:24,530
one of the questions of reviews why did

667
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:26,809
you do it in a greenhouse yeah can't say

668
00:40:24,530 --> 00:40:29,690
I can't work in this because it's not

669
00:40:26,809 --> 00:40:31,700
like Europe remember we measured some

670
00:40:29,690 --> 00:40:35,180
trace gases in Chiapas and su Chiapas

671
00:40:31,700 --> 00:40:37,520
and we we left our PVC tubes in the

672
00:40:35,180 --> 00:40:40,640
field they stole them and we were

673
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:45,170
communicating constantly with local

674
00:40:40,640 --> 00:40:46,940
people I yeah it's one of the reasons

675
00:40:45,170 --> 00:40:49,579
also why I think field experiments are

676
00:40:46,940 --> 00:40:52,549
similar brilliant and that we do some

677
00:40:49,579 --> 00:40:54,980
some field some lab experiments it's

678
00:40:52,549 --> 00:41:00,760
very difficult to justify to review says

679
00:40:54,980 --> 00:41:00,760
yeah ok yeah

680
00:41:08,230 --> 00:41:13,640
just a comment we actually also have a

681
00:41:11,210 --> 00:41:17,030
field trial that's been going on for 20

682
00:41:13,640 --> 00:41:19,130
years and San Luis Potosi haha at any

683
00:41:17,030 --> 00:41:23,110
flop station so might be interesting

684
00:41:19,130 --> 00:41:25,460
also to do some investigation there also

685
00:41:23,110 --> 00:41:29,330
evaluate conservation agriculture

686
00:41:25,460 --> 00:41:33,500
minimal village and conventional system

687
00:41:29,330 --> 00:41:37,550
and two replications okay okay what what

688
00:41:33,500 --> 00:41:39,550
kind of soil is it so it's if we can

689
00:41:37,550 --> 00:41:42,700
extract that or an A then that , meter

690
00:41:39,550 --> 00:41:45,890
because it's rather copper notes no no

691
00:41:42,700 --> 00:41:47,930
no no it's it's it's not it's not even

692
00:41:45,890 --> 00:41:52,220
no sorry this is this it's not even to

693
00:41:47,930 --> 00:41:54,470
do with the type of soil it is it is at

694
00:41:52,220 --> 00:41:56,480
random we had in the beginning for

695
00:41:54,470 --> 00:41:58,400
instance in in Elberton we sampled or

696
00:41:56,480 --> 00:42:00,500
you said you're trying to extract DNA

697
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:02,840
you got 9 replicate where you've got

698
00:42:00,500 --> 00:42:05,090
treatments and all of sudden once all

699
00:42:02,840 --> 00:42:07,990
you can't extract it whatever you do now

700
00:42:05,090 --> 00:42:11,780
we optimize that on blah blah blah but

701
00:42:07,990 --> 00:42:13,880
it's it's you you you if you go to

702
00:42:11,780 --> 00:42:17,450
conferences or congresses that was one

703
00:42:13,880 --> 00:42:20,050
at Broadway last year in December where

704
00:42:17,450 --> 00:42:21,790
and then you hear the scene the same

705
00:42:20,050 --> 00:42:24,740
questions

706
00:42:21,790 --> 00:42:28,630
DNA nor the problem RNA proteins that

707
00:42:24,740 --> 00:42:30,890
people huge map what kind of money

708
00:42:28,630 --> 00:42:33,740
dedicated to extract proteins because

709
00:42:30,890 --> 00:42:36,580
that's the final solution I mean DNA RNA

710
00:42:33,740 --> 00:42:40,240
and proteins puppets and they got money

711
00:42:36,580 --> 00:42:42,140
you know Europe it's 1 million euros but

712
00:42:40,240 --> 00:42:44,630
you know what I mean it's these

713
00:42:42,140 --> 00:42:46,820
techniques are not yet what they should

714
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:47,180
be but I think they're brilliant I love

715
00:42:46,820 --> 00:42:49,100
it

716
00:42:47,180 --> 00:42:57,560
I think Simon for your comment and

717
00:42:49,100 --> 00:43:00,560
actually slowly are going to be ready to

718
00:42:57,560 --> 00:43:03,170
be put in in this kind of this kind of

719
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:05,780
networks and taking advantage of off of

720
00:43:03,170 --> 00:43:08,630
thinking all the PhD students that

721
00:43:05,780 --> 00:43:10,340
actually have been connected to the work

722
00:43:08,630 --> 00:43:12,830
and that I think that's something we

723
00:43:10,340 --> 00:43:14,990
have to reactivate also in the in the

724
00:43:12,830 --> 00:43:15,980
team to see how can we can they be a PhD

725
00:43:14,990 --> 00:43:19,640
student working on

726
00:43:15,980 --> 00:43:22,369
to see or so definitely nila

727
00:43:19,640 --> 00:43:23,690
is working on that Yvonne is working on

728
00:43:22,369 --> 00:43:26,150
attracting more students so I think

729
00:43:23,690 --> 00:43:30,830
that's how we can keep this kind of work

730
00:43:26,150 --> 00:43:39,100
going any more questions question over

731
00:43:30,830 --> 00:43:39,100
there somebody else know somebody online

732
00:43:39,460 --> 00:43:45,859
somebody online has a question now that

733
00:43:43,850 --> 00:43:47,630
I was recently following a seminar

734
00:43:45,859 --> 00:43:50,020
online I know how frustrated it is you

735
00:43:47,630 --> 00:43:52,070
want to say something and nobody

736
00:43:50,020 --> 00:43:59,780
remembers that you're actually hanging

737
00:43:52,070 --> 00:44:02,119
on your computer no one time two times

738
00:43:59,780 --> 00:44:06,950
last time no question Luke you other

739
00:44:02,119 --> 00:44:10,400
question was a specific question you I'm

740
00:44:06,950 --> 00:44:13,640
not I'm willing to investigate it but

741
00:44:10,400 --> 00:44:15,590
the descriptive I think no because we've

742
00:44:13,640 --> 00:44:17,750
done it I think we should we should

743
00:44:15,590 --> 00:44:20,570
start using these techniques to really I

744
00:44:17,750 --> 00:44:24,050
have a problem here can I can I answer

745
00:44:20,570 --> 00:44:28,390
with my molecular biology I think so so

746
00:44:24,050 --> 00:44:31,250
if you have questions more number yep

747
00:44:28,390 --> 00:44:32,660
okay thank you very much look and I

748
00:44:31,250 --> 00:44:34,520
think this is a clear example of

749
00:44:32,660 --> 00:44:36,710
research research are in fact true

750
00:44:34,520 --> 00:44:39,140
partnerships when I'm asked what is the

751
00:44:36,710 --> 00:44:42,109
value of the long term drugs I just show

752
00:44:39,140 --> 00:44:44,510
Luke's first slide with I don't know I

753
00:44:42,109 --> 00:44:47,810
don't even remember more than 30 share

754
00:44:44,510 --> 00:44:50,300
joint publications and 18 decks of 14

755
00:44:47,810 --> 00:44:53,480
and that usually helps to convince them

756
00:44:50,300 --> 00:44:55,400
more academically or oriented donors so

757
00:44:53,480 --> 00:44:57,140
look thank you very much it has been a

758
00:44:55,400 --> 00:44:59,859
brilliant partnership and there's more

759
00:44:57,140 --> 00:44:59,859
to come in future

760
00:45:03,320 --> 00:45:08,869
[Applause]

761
00:45:16,230 --> 00:45:19,380
[Applause]

762
