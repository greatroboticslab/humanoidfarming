1
00:00:00,880 --> 00:00:05,440
it's my last day at overview farms and

2
00:00:03,360 --> 00:00:06,399
i i don't know where the time has gone

3
00:00:05,440 --> 00:00:09,040
um

4
00:00:06,399 --> 00:00:11,519
and i have to say i didn't expect to

5
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:13,200
like working with cows as much as i did

6
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:14,719
um i've been here a month now and i've

7
00:00:13,200 --> 00:00:15,759
kind of made friends with a few of them

8
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:18,640
um they've all got their own

9
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:20,960
personalities so i wanted to introduce

10
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:22,000
a couple of my favorites to you this is

11
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:25,199
granny

12
00:00:22,000 --> 00:00:25,760
she's my absolute favorite and poor

13
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:27,680
granny

14
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:30,400
she can't walk very well she's getting

15
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,840
old she's got stuff in her feet

16
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:34,160
we've put some blocks on her to try and

17
00:00:31,840 --> 00:00:35,680
help her walk but it's it's a chore for

18
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:37,040
her getting around

19
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:38,719
i come around in the morning and i get

20
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,559
her out of her stall and she's always

21
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:42,399
the last one and she'll sort of

22
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:43,760
make her way slowly down towards the

23
00:00:42,399 --> 00:00:44,719
milking parlor and she'll look behind

24
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,360
her

25
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:50,000
as if she's saying are you sure are you

26
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:51,680
sure i have to go down there and say yes

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,920
and she will she'll eventually make it

28
00:00:51,680 --> 00:00:54,719
down and she'll eventually make it back

29
00:00:53,920 --> 00:00:57,360
and i just

30
00:00:54,719 --> 00:01:00,719
i guess i just admire her persistence

31
00:00:57,360 --> 00:01:04,000
but yeah i've got a soft spot for granny

32
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:06,720
and this is annabelle and annabelle

33
00:01:04,000 --> 00:01:08,000
has got to be the most stubborn cow on

34
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,159
the farm

35
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:12,320
she was made a pet by the daughter of

36
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:14,240
the heifer razor when she was off farm

37
00:01:12,320 --> 00:01:15,759
and so she doesn't think she has to

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:18,320
listen

39
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:18,960
and so when i come and get her up in the

40
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:21,040
morning

41
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:22,720
she'll be sitting in her stall and i'll

42
00:01:21,040 --> 00:01:25,759
come along and

43
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:27,200
okay cows time to get up and she'll be

44
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:28,159
sitting in her stall and she'll look at

45
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:31,360
me

46
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:33,280
she said what are you gonna do about it

47
00:01:31,360 --> 00:01:35,119
and so i'll i'll come and i'll have to

48
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,520
stand next to her and i'll give her a

49
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:38,799
pat

50
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,159
and you know let her know hey it's time

51
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:43,680
to go

52
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:45,119
and eventually she'll get up but in her

53
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,880
time

54
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,560
but despite all of her stubbornness

55
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:50,399
she's super curious and super

56
00:01:48,560 --> 00:01:52,240
comfortable around people and

57
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:53,280
when i'm around she'll come and knows

58
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:54,000
and she'll just want to come and see

59
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:56,320
what i'm doing

60
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:57,119
and she's just really really friendly

61
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:58,960
and

62
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:01,280
kind of frustrating when you want to do

63
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:04,560
something

64
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:07,840
so we've got about 120 cows here

65
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:09,280
and as you can imagine 120 cows they eat

66
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,039
a lot of food

67
00:02:09,280 --> 00:02:13,840
in fact they eat about two and a half

68
00:02:11,039 --> 00:02:16,959
tons of food twice a day

69
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:17,920
and well two and a half tons is a lot of

70
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:19,840
feed

71
00:02:17,920 --> 00:02:20,959
so we can't just sort of bring it out in

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:24,400
wheelbarrows

73
00:02:20,959 --> 00:02:26,560
we need bigger machinery and it's

74
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:28,239
pretty simple this is a feed mixer if

75
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:29,040
you look inside there's two corkscrews

76
00:02:28,239 --> 00:02:32,160
going around

77
00:02:29,040 --> 00:02:34,000
turning and mixing the feed and then

78
00:02:32,160 --> 00:02:35,280
robert toes the feed mixer down the

79
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,680
aisles of the barn

80
00:02:35,280 --> 00:02:40,160
and the feed mixer just dispenses a line

81
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:41,840
of food right where the cows can get it

82
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:44,000
so this feed mixer is actually really

83
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,760
important because

84
00:02:44,000 --> 00:02:47,200
the amount of milk that the cows produce

85
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:48,879
is tied to what they eat

86
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,720
and so a lot of thought goes into

87
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:52,160
getting the nutrition for the cows just

88
00:02:50,720 --> 00:02:55,440
right

89
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:58,480
so i want to share well what do cows eat

90
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:59,760
so this bale here this is not hay um

91
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:01,440
and the plastic that it's wrapping is

92
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:03,280
actually really functional because when

93
00:03:01,440 --> 00:03:06,159
it's wrapped up and made airtight

94
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:07,680
what starts out is hay inside ferments

95
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,959
and turns into what's called grass

96
00:03:07,680 --> 00:03:11,840
silage which i think is a little bit

97
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:14,080
easier for the cows to digest

98
00:03:11,840 --> 00:03:15,519
and to that you add a little bit of

99
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:18,640
milled corn

100
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:19,040
which adds calories and energy you'll

101
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:21,519
add

102
00:03:19,040 --> 00:03:22,239
a little bit of soy meal or maybe some

103
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:24,560
canola

104
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,680
to add protein which helps keep the milk

105
00:03:24,560 --> 00:03:28,720
production up

106
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:30,239
you'll add some minerals and some room

107
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,280
and bypass fat

108
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:34,799
which i think helps bulk them up

109
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:36,959
and then you'll top it all off with

110
00:03:34,799 --> 00:03:39,280
another scoop of fermented hay

111
00:03:36,959 --> 00:03:40,400
this is also grass silage but stored in

112
00:03:39,280 --> 00:03:43,120
a silo

113
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:43,599
rather than in a veil and you mix all

114
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:47,120
that up

115
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:48,799
and that's what cows eat so this is my

116
00:03:47,120 --> 00:03:50,319
last day at overview farms

117
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:52,480
and it's actually the last video i'm

118
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:54,159
going to make while i'm on a farm

119
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:56,239
i've been on the road for eight months

120
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,720
now and i've been filming the whole time

121
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,480
so i

122
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,040
really hope i have enough footage to

123
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:02,319
make a pretty decent documentary

124
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:04,000
but that means i'm going to take a

125
00:04:02,319 --> 00:04:05,680
hiatus from these videos for a couple

126
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,599
weeks as i drive from nova scotia

127
00:04:05,680 --> 00:04:09,680
all the way back to british columbia

128
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,840
where i'm going to edit the film

129
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:13,680
and then once i start editing the film

130
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,680
i'll start posting videos again

131
00:04:13,680 --> 00:04:17,600
with some highlights of the footage or

132
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,280
maybe good interview clips

133
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,799
so i'll keep posting videos and you can

134
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:21,840
catch those videos by subscribing to the

135
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:23,199

00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:24,880
you can find out more about the big

137
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:26,639

weeks when i

142
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:35,280
get back to british columbia
