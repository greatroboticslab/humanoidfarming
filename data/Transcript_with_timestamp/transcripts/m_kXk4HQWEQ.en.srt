1
00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:04,440
hey Geto guys it's Wayne Perkins here

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:07,000
we're at the ataga Field Days uh in

3
00:00:04,440 --> 00:00:08,400
ataga funny that and it's it's a cloudy

4
00:00:07,000 --> 00:00:10,759
day but we're here with the Sol water

5
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:14,000
pump the react pump and um it's pumping

6
00:00:10,759 --> 00:00:15,920
well it's done about 22,000 l so far for

7
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,080
the day we got two panels set up behind

8
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:20,519
it uh just want to give you a little bit

9
00:00:18,080 --> 00:00:21,960
of information about the react pump um

10
00:00:20,519 --> 00:00:24,199
it's capable of pumping up to about

11
00:00:21,960 --> 00:00:25,960
10,000 l a day maybe a little bit more

12
00:00:24,199 --> 00:00:27,760
depending on what we do with it on and

13
00:00:25,960 --> 00:00:30,039
on the height so that's that's a pretty

14
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:32,279
good quantity and it's capable of uh

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,239
pumping to about 150 M head we can go

16
00:00:32,279 --> 00:00:37,000
higher than that but the standard model

17
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,520
here will pump up to about 150 M head

18
00:00:37,000 --> 00:00:40,079
that's kind of based on the amount of

19
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:43,239
water is based on how high we need to

20
00:00:40,079 --> 00:00:45,000
pump it uh few options with it we

21
00:00:43,239 --> 00:00:46,719
basically this is the two panel system

22
00:00:45,000 --> 00:00:49,199
we can put four panels on it or six

23
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,760
panels which basically maximizes the

24
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:54,520
amount of water you can get out of it uh

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,960
so the the two panel system it'll pump

26
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,760
um it'll pump that 150 M head but it's

27
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:00,440
going to struggle on the cloudy days or

28
00:00:58,760 --> 00:01:02,719
days that aren't so good

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:04,519
uh so with with the four Panel System

30
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:05,920
what we're doing is we we're giving you

31
00:01:04,519 --> 00:01:07,759
more water on the good days but we're

32
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,759
giving you a lot more water on the bad

33
00:01:07,759 --> 00:01:12,080
days we just got a lot more we can grab

34
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:13,240
a lot more power from the sky so hey

35
00:01:12,080 --> 00:01:15,840
look if you're interested if you need to

36
00:01:13,240 --> 00:01:18,240
get water to your stock on your farm or

37
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:20,439
whatever um you know Keen to have a chat

38
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:21,960
to you just give me a call love to hear

00:01:20,439 --> 00:01:23,320
from you and we want we want to go

through and we want to talk through the

41
00:01:23,320 --> 00:01:26,360
process with you we we're going to want

42
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,960
to know how high you need to pump the

43
00:01:26,360 --> 00:01:30,600
water we're going to want to need know

44
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:32,520
over what distance and on on average per

45
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:33,759
day how much water you need and out of

46
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:35,640
that there we'll start working with you

47
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:37,920
on figuring out whether this pump or one

48
00:01:35,640 --> 00:01:39,759
of one of our other pumps uh we'll do

49
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:40,920
the job for you so um if you're in the

50
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:42,439
