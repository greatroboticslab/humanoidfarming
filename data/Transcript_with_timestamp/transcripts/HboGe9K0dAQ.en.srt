00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
today i'm going to demonstrate a simple

2
00:00:02,480 --> 00:00:07,359
way to attach a lay flat header pipe to

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:09,760
a regular garden hose

4
00:00:07,359 --> 00:00:12,719
begin by using a clamp to attach a gray

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,360
barb connected to a leg flat header

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,680
if it is hard to get on use some food

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:20,480
grade lubricant like vegetable oil

8
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,480
tighten the clamp

9
00:00:21,520 --> 00:00:26,400
wrap teflon tape around the threads on a

10
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:28,640
two inch male pvc coupling keeping in

11
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:30,320
mind the tape must go on clockwise so

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:33,040
that it doesn't bunch up when you screw

13
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:34,880
it into the grey bulb connector

14
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:37,920
use pipe wrenches to make sure it is

15
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:40,000
tight then apply pvc glue to the outside

16
00:00:37,920 --> 00:00:41,520
of the three-quarter inch female reduced

17
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,840
threaded piece

18
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:45,840
and the inside of the two inch male pvc

19
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:48,320
cover

20
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:50,640
now we will wrap the threads of a 3 4

21
00:00:48,320 --> 00:00:52,800
inch female connector with teflon tape

22
00:00:50,640 --> 00:00:56,239
and screw it into the reducer

23
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:59,199
next apply more pvc glue which will

24
00:00:56,239 --> 00:01:02,399
attach to a short two to three piece of

25
00:00:59,199 --> 00:01:05,199
pvc three quarter inch pipe

26
00:01:02,399 --> 00:01:07,280
apply more pvc glue to attach the valve

27
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:08,799
to the pvc

28
00:01:07,280 --> 00:01:11,439
the valve has to flow in the right

29
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:14,880
direction so double check the direction

30
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:17,280
the arrow points use more pvc glue to

31
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:19,119
attach another short piece of pvc pipe

32
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:21,520
and then a three quarter inch female

33
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:24,720
connector then make sure the water hose

34
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:27,840
or faucet is clean and add teflon tape

35
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:27,840
to the threads

36
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,240
if you choose to add fertigation to the

37
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,320
irrigation system it should be attached

38
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:38,400
in the center of the pipe

39
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:40,560
we hope this video was very useful

simple irrigation system on a small

phone thank you
