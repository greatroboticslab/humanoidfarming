1
00:00:02,800 --> 00:00:06,640
i farm with

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:07,680
my parents and my wife jamie and our

3
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:09,760
four kids

4
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:10,880
here in spin county diversified

5
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:15,360
operation with

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:31,110
small grains corn beans and cow calf

7
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:39,040
cattle and cover crops

8
00:00:31,110 --> 00:00:40,800
[Music]

9
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:43,440
when we plant cover crops we've always

10
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:44,239
got a handful of species in there you

11
00:00:43,440 --> 00:00:48,039
know it could be

12
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:50,000
three to eight we've been no-till since

13
00:00:48,039 --> 00:00:52,640
1986.

14
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
it's been a real success for us through

15
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,199
the

16
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:59,440
decades now especially the past you know

17
00:00:57,199 --> 00:01:00,480
several years with the weather extremes

18
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,680
that we've been through here in south

19
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:05,280
dakota

20
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:07,760
just being flexible to planting

21
00:01:05,280 --> 00:01:09,760
different things and not being stuck in

22
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:13,920
a rut with a two crop rotation

23
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:16,159
really really helps it's allowed us to

24
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:19,040
be able to still you know produce crops

25
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:21,759
on our fields and get in and get planted

26
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,960
and save the moisture when needed but

27
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,640
the cover crops

28
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:27,200
will utilize the moisture when we've got

29
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:29,040
too much

30
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,479
you know those drought years of 17 and

31
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:33,200
18 our trend

32
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,079
for our yields kept going up and in 18

33
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,200
we were

34
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:41,040
really dry our corn looked like

35
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:42,640
pineapple i mean it was that dry

36
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,320
i just told brian it's just

37
00:01:42,640 --> 00:01:46,240
heartbreaking this is just going to be

38
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,520
the worst year ever

39
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,960
and then we just got enough rain and it

40
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,159
popped out of it and that's all we

41
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:54,399
needed

42
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,479
it was best crop we've ever pulled off

43
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,320
this farm

44
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,320
that confirmed to us that what we're

45
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:04,240
doing works and

46
00:02:00,320 --> 00:02:06,840
we can withstand the weather extremes

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,239
i feel pretty confident with what we do

48
00:02:06,840 --> 00:02:10,959
and

49
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:12,400
how we manage things that it it does

50
00:02:10,959 --> 00:02:15,360
bring our stress level down

51
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,560
quite a bit i'm just more comfortable

52
00:02:15,360 --> 00:02:16,879
with what we're doing because i know

53
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:19,200
it's

54
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,560
sustainable and it's going to work for

55
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:22,480
us

56
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:23,920
the last two or three years have been a

57
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,520
great example

58
00:02:23,920 --> 00:02:30,080
on weather extremes and how well

59
00:02:27,520 --> 00:02:31,120
we can perform in those situations that

60
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:33,840
really

61
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,200
sets your mind at ease this is exactly

62
00:02:33,840 --> 00:02:38,319
what we need to be doing

63
00:02:35,200 --> 00:02:41,519
because we can sustain and get through

64
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:42,000
these weather extremes and so my stress

65
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:51,840
level

66
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:51,840
is significantly less than it used to be

67
00:02:57,830 --> 00:03:00,959

68
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:06,959
