00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,560
welcome back everybody recently i posted

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:06,640
a survey on my social media

3
00:00:04,560 --> 00:00:08,480
to real tractor owners what is your

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:10,719
favorite tractor attachment that you

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:12,320
have we got a lot of feedback a lot of

6
00:00:10,719 --> 00:00:13,679
results we compiled everything and made

7
00:00:12,320 --> 00:00:15,920
a top 10 list we're going to share that

8
00:00:13,679 --> 00:00:17,680
with you now now we asked this survey in

9
00:00:15,920 --> 00:00:19,199
the summertime and

10
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:20,560
funny enough there wasn't much snow

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,920
equipment mentioned on there so

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,240
depending when you're watching this

13
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:25,920
video maybe snow equipment is a bigger

14
00:00:24,240 --> 00:00:28,160
deal at that point in the year and let's

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:30,320
have some fun how many of the top 10

16
00:00:28,160 --> 00:00:32,480
tractor attachments do you own yourself

goodworkstractors.com we're going to go

31
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:02,800
in reverse order from number 10 all the

32
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:04,479
way to number one

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:05,680
it was overwhelming not even close

34
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:07,439
number one you'll want to stick around

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,439
for that but number 10

36
00:01:07,439 --> 00:01:11,439
is a tiller folks are looking for

37
00:01:09,439 --> 00:01:13,280
attachments that are life-changing i

38
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:16,000
think and a tiller is something you

39
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,360
cannot replicate by doing by hand and

40
00:01:16,000 --> 00:01:18,640
the ability

41
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:20,640
to turn

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,000
unfinished ground into prepped ground

43
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:23,920
for seeding whether that's for food

44
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:25,520
plots or for

45
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:27,200
a garden maybe you're even doing

46
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:28,720
driveway prep we did that recently as

47
00:01:27,200 --> 00:01:30,320
well it makes a huge difference in

48
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:31,920
something many of you can't live without

49
00:01:30,320 --> 00:01:34,320
on our website you'll find tillers by

50
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:36,320
rhino by tar river and by dirt dog so

51
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:38,799

53
00:01:38,799 --> 00:01:41,920
next up on the list i was a little

54
00:01:40,479 --> 00:01:43,439
surprised about this one not that i

55
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:45,119
don't appreciate it because i enjoy it

56
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:47,040
myself but i wouldn't have said it was

57
00:01:45,119 --> 00:01:48,799
my favorite the hydraulic top link i

58
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,399
didn't see a hydraulic side length like

59
00:01:48,799 --> 00:01:52,240
a top and a tilt kit that wasn't

60
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,399
mentioned at all but just the top link

61
00:01:52,240 --> 00:01:56,320
which for me is very handy for a couple

62
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,759
of reasons the ability to hook up to any

63
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,680
attachment or to be able to quickly

64
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:01,200
switch between different attachments

65
00:01:59,680 --> 00:02:02,399
that are maybe sitting at a bit of a

66
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:03,920
different angle is going to be very

67
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,280
helpful additionally when you're using

68
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,520
those attachments on your three-point

69
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:09,200
hitch maybe ground engaging

70
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:11,360
things like a box blade or a lamp plane

71
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,599
or maybe it's a tiller or maybe even a

72
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:15,840
rotary cutter you can quickly and easily

73
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,520
from the operator seat change that angle

74
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,680
the only downside of having a hydraulic

75
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:22,080
top link in my opinion is the fact that

76
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:23,599
it does require an additional hydraulic

77
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,270
outlet on the back of the tractor in

78
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:27,840
order to operate

79

[Music]

80
00:02:27,840 --> 00:02:31,440
i'm proud of you guys for choosing this

81
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:34,000
one those of you that did but a ballast

82
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:35,680
box or a ballast solution was next on

83
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:38,080
the list now this isn't something that

84
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:39,920
you actually do any work with however it

85
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:41,519
is going to allow you to do more work

86
00:02:39,920 --> 00:02:42,640
with your front end loader or maybe if

87
00:02:41,519 --> 00:02:43,599
you have ballast on the front of your

88
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:45,200
tractor

89
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:46,640
you can use a tiller or a brush hog

90
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:47,840
easier if you don't have a loader but

91
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:49,920
it's going to let you do work more

92
00:02:47,840 --> 00:02:52,400
safely and more confidently knowing that

93
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:54,000
you are properly planted on the ground

94
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:56,640
now many tractor manuals i'll take the

95
00:02:54,000 --> 00:02:58,319
1025r for example it's a small tractor a

96
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,920
sub compact the manual is going to tell

97
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:01,760
you to use a thousand pounds or actually

98
00:02:59,920 --> 00:03:02,800
a thousand and fifty pounds minimum of

99
00:03:01,760 --> 00:03:04,319
ballast weight when you're using the

100
00:03:02,800 --> 00:03:05,680
front end loader now that is a lot of

101
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,519
weight and if you have a larger tractor

102
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:09,440
that number is going to keep on climbing

103
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,040
typically you need a lot of different

104
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:12,720
types of ballast weight to achieve that

105
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:14,640
minimum with a ballast box it's going to

106
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:16,080
be one of the cheaper solutions get some

107
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:17,760
wheel weights maybe liquid ballast

108
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:19,519
inside your tires i've done some videos

109
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:21,060
all about ballast weight but i'm glad to

110
00:03:19,519 --> 00:03:23,200
see it on the list

[Music]

112
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:26,480
i didn't have to walk very far for this

113
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:28,080
next one it's sitting right next to our

114
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:29,519
ballast box it is going to be the

115
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:31,120
backhoe that's what you guys chose for

116
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:33,040
the next attachment on your list now

117
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:34,720
remember this survey was done and these

118
00:03:33,040 --> 00:03:36,879
results are compiled of real tractor

119
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:38,480
owners folks like you at home we all

120
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,159
know i wouldn't be choosing tobacco to

121
00:03:38,480 --> 00:03:41,440
be on this list now i do think a backhoe

122
00:03:40,159 --> 00:03:43,280
is useful for many different

123
00:03:41,440 --> 00:03:44,959
applications and projects that come up

124
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,200
that's not why i wouldn't put it on this

125
00:03:44,959 --> 00:03:48,720
list it's more of a

126
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,159
a return on your investment for a lot of

127
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,480
folks they're going to have

128
00:03:50,159 --> 00:03:53,680
this big old very expensive attachment

129
00:03:52,480 --> 00:03:55,439
besides the tractor it's probably the

130
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:57,200
most expensive part of their purchase

131
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:59,040
that they would make they have a project

132
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:00,720
or two not everybody but just a lot of

133
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:02,640
folks they use it they take it off it

134
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:04,640
sits there and it's gonna just kind of

135
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:06,159
sit out in the sun or fade away and it

136
00:04:04,640 --> 00:04:08,239
ends up being thousands and thousands of

137
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:10,799
dollars that is just sitting there not

138
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:13,280
getting used when perhaps you could just

139
00:04:10,799 --> 00:04:15,680
rent out a mini excavator for two or

140
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:17,040
three weekends get your projects done

141
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:18,120
and you don't have all that money tied

142
00:04:17,040 --> 00:04:20,160
up

00:04:18,120 --> 00:04:23,040
[Music]

144
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:25,199
so the word bucket showed up a whole lot

145
00:04:23,040 --> 00:04:26,960
in the survey results and so i took the

146
00:04:25,199 --> 00:04:28,720
liberty of combining the stump bucket

147
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,639
the regular bucket just buckets in

148
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,639
general and lump them together and it's

149
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:34,880
hard to argue with folks because buckets

150
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:36,960
are so so handy when you need them for

151
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,040
moving large quantities of material for

152
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:41,360
digging out stumps for maybe planting

153
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:42,400
trees moving rocks all sorts of

154
00:04:41,360 --> 00:04:44,800
different applications

155
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:46,320
it's easy to see why a standard tractor

156
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:47,840
bucket is going to come with pretty much

157
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,360
every compact tractor on the market

158
00:04:47,840 --> 00:04:50,560
these days and while the stump bucket

159
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:52,080
like this one right here is one of the

160
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:53,380
top attachments i sell at good works

161
00:04:52,080 --> 00:04:55,360
tractors

162
00:04:53,380 --> 00:04:56,960
[Music]

163
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:58,800
now i do want to give a shout out to an

164
00:04:56,960 --> 00:05:00,960
honorable mention the quick hitch was

165
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,320
listed quite a few times didn't quite

166
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:04,000
make the cut but it was right on the

167
00:05:02,320 --> 00:05:05,360
cusp so a quick hitch really isn't a

168
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:06,800
tractor attachment it's more of an

169
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:08,720
accessory that's going to make hooking

170
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:10,720
up to three-point attachments that much

171
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:12,639
easier you simply back up to an

172
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:14,160
attachment maybe you have to lengthen or

173
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,400
shorten your top link but it's going to

174
00:05:14,160 --> 00:05:18,400
make that connection process that much

175
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:20,240
easier which can be a major pain to deal

176
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:21,759
with especially for larger heavier

177
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:23,919
attachments the special thing about the

178
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:26,320
category 1 spiko quick hitch is that it

179
00:05:23,919 --> 00:05:27,840
does not require bushings the land

prides of the world the john deere eye

181
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:32,080
match the harbor freights all require

182
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:34,080
you to put bushings on every three-point

183
00:05:32,080 --> 00:05:36,400
attachment you have these are sized to

184
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:37,520
be a direct fit to category one pins we

00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:43,919
[Music]

188
00:05:41,440 --> 00:05:45,680
this next one kind of validates why i

189
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:47,520
don't ever buy tractors without front

190
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:49,919
end loaders because so many of you

191
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:52,160
responded and said a front end loader

192
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,320
itself is the most valuable tractor

193
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,600
attachment so i buy and sell used

194
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:57,840
tractors along with all the new

195
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
attachments that i sell and whether it's

196
00:05:57,840 --> 00:06:01,759
kubota or john deere you're going to see

197
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:03,680
a front end loader on every single one

198
00:06:01,759 --> 00:06:05,120
out of the hundreds and hundreds maybe

199
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,280
thousands of tractors that i sold over

200
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,120
the years i can think of two instances

201
00:06:07,280 --> 00:06:11,759
where somebody did not want the front

202
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:14,000
end loader on there that's how much of

203
00:06:11,759 --> 00:06:15,360
almost a standard it should be although

204
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:16,720
when you're shopping for a new tractor

205
00:06:15,360 --> 00:06:18,319
it is typically going to be priced

206
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:19,759
separately so make sure that's included

207
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:21,759
in your quote but i think where folks

208
00:06:19,759 --> 00:06:23,440
are going with a front-end loader is the

209
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,120
fact that you can put a bucket on there

210
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:27,600
you can put a set of pallet forks a snow

211
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:29,759
pusher a grapple a bale sphere the list

212
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:31,840
goes on and on and on with the different

213
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:33,280
things you can do as long as you have a

214
00:06:31,840 --> 00:06:34,960
quick attached system like a skid steer

215
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,120
quick attach or a john deere quick

216
00:06:34,960 --> 00:06:38,080
attach

217
00:06:36,120 --> 00:06:39,600
[Music]

218
00:06:38,080 --> 00:06:40,720
next up on the list we're talking about

219
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:42,560
mowers

220
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,360
including a couple different kinds a

221
00:06:42,560 --> 00:06:47,360
brush hog a slasher a shredder

222
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,960
a cutter a bush hog

223
00:06:47,360 --> 00:06:50,880
you hear it called a lot of things and

224
00:06:48,960 --> 00:06:52,160
then also flail mowers all right so

225
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:53,680
we're not talking about finish mowers

226
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,280
not your belly mower or not even a

227
00:06:53,680 --> 00:06:56,880
three-point finish mower but these are

228
00:06:55,280 --> 00:06:58,319
for cutting your fields maintaining that

229
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,000
long stuff before it gets too out of

230
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,440
control and if there ever was an item i

231
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,280
think that's on this list because of the

232
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:05,280
time of year that the survey was done i

233
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:06,560
definitely think it would be a cutter it

234
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:08,290
is hard to think about living without

235
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:10,160
one of those right now

236
00:07:08,290 --> 00:07:12,960
[Music]

237
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:14,319
next up grapples and you know what we're

238
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:16,000
getting pretty high what are we number

239
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,160
three now on the list and it's easy to

240
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:20,000
see why you know you can just grab and

241
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:21,520
pick whatever you want to with the front

242
00:07:20,000 --> 00:07:22,880
end loader that's why the front end

243
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,880
loader made the list because these are

244
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:27,280
one of the handiest attachments now we

245
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,199
carry all sorts of grapples here

246
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:30,800
one of the downsides of many grapples is

247
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:32,880
you have to have a third function on

248
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:35,199
them so if you use any traditional

249
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,639
hydraulic grapple you got to have

250
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,080
you know you have two functions on your

251
00:07:36,639 --> 00:07:39,360
tractor right to raise and lower your

252
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:41,199
front end loader and to curl and roll

253
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:42,800
the bucket that's two functions in order

254
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:44,720
to open and close the jaws of the

255
00:07:42,800 --> 00:07:46,000
grapple you got to have a third function

256
00:07:44,720 --> 00:07:47,840
on there so if you don't have those

257
00:07:46,000 --> 00:07:49,520
hydraulics on your tractor there's three

258
00:07:47,840 --> 00:07:50,960
options that we can help with so number

259
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:53,039
one is going to be the brush crusher

260
00:07:50,960 --> 00:07:55,120
it's a completely mechanical system

261
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:57,039
there's no extra hydraulics no extra

262
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:59,120
electric that's required you hook it up

263
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,960
to your front end loader and away you go

264
00:07:59,120 --> 00:08:02,720
the next option for sub compacts and

265
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:05,440
small compact tractors is going to be a

266
00:08:02,720 --> 00:08:07,199
work saver electric mini grapple it's

267
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,120
essentially a self-contained system it

268
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:10,400
includes and comes with the harness

269
00:08:09,120 --> 00:08:11,919
everything you need to get up and

270
00:08:10,400 --> 00:08:14,160
running you can have it installed in

271
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:15,440
about an hour and get to work the last

272
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:17,759
option if you do want to go with a

273
00:08:15,440 --> 00:08:19,360
traditional hydraulic grapple is that we

274
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,440
have done videos about how you can

275
00:08:19,360 --> 00:08:23,280
install a summit diverter kit so you use

276
00:08:21,440 --> 00:08:25,120
your tractor's existing hydraulics

277
00:08:23,280 --> 00:08:26,560
divert that flow you get a thumb switch

278
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,879
that way you can open and close the

279
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,800
grapple jaws it's going to be a diy

280
00:08:28,879 --> 00:08:33,279
solution you can save five percent using

281
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:34,970
code gwt your order at summit hydraulics

282
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,039
link down below

283
00:08:34,970 --> 00:08:39,680
[Music]

284
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,919
okay number two on the list is gonna be

285
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:44,000
i'm summing it up graders box blades

286
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:47,680
land planes it was something to level

287
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:49,120
out move material maintain resurface

288
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,120
that kind of thing with your three-point

289
00:08:49,120 --> 00:08:52,800
hitch on your tractor so one of the main

290
00:08:51,120 --> 00:08:55,120
purposes that comes to mind is going to

291
00:08:52,800 --> 00:08:56,720
be resurfacing a gravel driveway maybe

292
00:08:55,120 --> 00:08:58,560
you have washouts maybe it just hasn't

293
00:08:56,720 --> 00:09:00,560
been maintained in a long time you can

294
00:08:58,560 --> 00:09:02,399
get yourself a land plane or a box blade

295
00:09:00,560 --> 00:09:04,399
and quickly and easily resurface that

296
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:05,839
and smooth out the ruts now with a tool

297
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,360
like a box blade we have a couple of

298
00:09:05,839 --> 00:09:08,800
them here this is a rollover box blade

299
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:10,560
which i've never used and then we have a

300
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:13,519
traditional box blade those are going to

301
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,880
be also able to resurface driveways

302
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:16,560
they're going to be able to trap and

303
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,000
hold more material so if you want to

304
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:19,440
move maybe your

305
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,000
landscaping and want to kind of change

306
00:09:19,440 --> 00:09:23,760
the contour of the ground you can scoop

307
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:25,040
up or almost drag a larger quantity of

308
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:26,720
material and move it from point a to

309
00:09:25,040 --> 00:09:28,560
point b with a box blade and we're going

310
00:09:26,720 --> 00:09:30,959
to go ahead and roll these pulverizers

311
00:09:28,560 --> 00:09:32,320
into that same category a new tool for

312
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,920
me something i've never used i'm going

313
00:09:32,320 --> 00:09:35,920
to have an opportunity to do so out of

314
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:38,160
the property but this is going to be

315
00:09:35,920 --> 00:09:39,920
great for resurfacing and leveling

316
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:41,170
smoothing out rough areas especially on

317
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:43,200
drives

318
00:09:41,170 --> 00:09:45,120
[Music]

319
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,399
finally we've reached number one the top

320
00:09:45,120 --> 00:09:48,160
of the mountain

321
00:09:46,399 --> 00:09:49,760
so suspenseful i know

322
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:52,320
number one is going to be pallet forks

323
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:54,959
which it's hard to argue this was

324
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:57,279
far and away the number one response and

325
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:59,279
number one with good reason the uses for

326
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:01,519
pallet forks are just numerous and

327
00:09:59,279 --> 00:10:03,360
lifting actual pallets is probably just

328
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:05,120
the tip of the iceberg and something

329
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:06,880
that most of you maybe never use them

330
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,560
for but many of you have responded and

331
00:10:06,880 --> 00:10:10,800
said those pallet forks stay on your

332
00:10:08,560 --> 00:10:12,480
tractor more often than a bucket does or

333
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:14,640
any other attachment because you can

334
00:10:12,480 --> 00:10:16,000
pick up and move anything under the sun

335
00:10:14,640 --> 00:10:17,760
that you can think of out of your truck

336
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:19,600
bed maybe moving attachments around

337
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:21,360
maybe picking up logs out of the woods a

338
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:22,800
poor man's grapple anytime you don't

339
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,959
feel like bending over and breaking your

340
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,320
back is a good time to use pallet forks

341
00:10:24,959 --> 00:10:28,560
we've done it we've made it through the

342
00:10:26,320 --> 00:10:30,399
list how many attachments on this list

343
00:10:28,560 --> 00:10:32,160
do you own right now is there something

344
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:33,920
else that should be on the list maybe

345
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:36,079
depending on the time of year maybe it's

346
00:10:33,920 --> 00:10:37,839
fall i can see a bagger being a pretty

347
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,200
important item maybe it's winter time

348
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,120
you have your snow blower your snow push

349
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,640
or your snow plow whatever it is join
