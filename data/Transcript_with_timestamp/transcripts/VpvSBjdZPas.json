  "text": "hello and welcome to an early morning episode in this one i finally get to prune my apple trees so right now we are in about a week and a couple of days away from spring which is a little late to be honest ideally we'll do this in january or february but the buds haven't broken yet there's no green showing so it's not too late we're still good so i'm gonna do it now now these trees are one year old which means i've had them for one year um i think when i got them they were probably about a year old still for the nursery to grow them because obviously they have to get them up to size so they're about two years old in total now it is pretty normal for your tree to be about one or two years old now as far as pruning goes there's a couple different choices most commonly for apples and pears you would prune them to what's called a central leader which is where you have a single trunk coming up and then anywhere from three to five branches coming off horizontally where all your fruit is going to be on these branches are ideally spaced out pretty evenly um it's let's say two or three inches or about ten centimeters apart so they all get their own light and they all face a different direction so like north south south east west you know they all get their own little space all facing out a different direction all around the center of the tree from the center of the tree alternatively you could also prune them and this is most common for stone fruits in something that's called a vase shape or also called an open center this what you do is you lop off the top of the tree usually about 30 centimeters about a foot off the ground so like say right here maybe a branch left over they will all come off down here about three or four branches shooting up again spaced out evenly but they're all coming from the same the same point that causes problems when you have snow or anything like that weighing down on those branches that's why it's not ideal these branches they might snipe off so what i'm going to be doing is pruning my apple trees into something that's called a modified central leader i got this idea from steven at home from skill cult so give credit where credit is due i was always going to do a central leader with a modified central leader sounds even better this is where you're combining the central leader and the voice shape combined you have your branches coming out evenly along the trunk and they're all go growing up to kind of compete with that central leader so you don't get that too much of that apical dominance it's just apples that parents like to do so you have about three or four branches ideally coming out horizontally growing up all competing then for that for that main apical dominance which it helps to keep your tree small and i'll explain and document and show you how i'm going to do this as we go along so with that said let's get down to the first tree which is my calypso so with the one-year-old apple tree there's really not a whole lot of pruning that you have to do it's more so just guiding it into the form that you're trying to train your fruit tree in and as you do this every year you'll find that there's just it's just maintaining the the shape that you have set up for your tree and it's becomes very little work really so the first one branch it's pretty obvious you can see it's swooping down ideally this tree was swooping over a little bit more and i had it tied up at the top here to kind of straighten it out because it was very it was leaning over a lot and that caused this branch which was horizontal to be very swooping so i'm going to correct that first off and how we're going to do that is by pruning it down to a bud that it comes out more horizontally and ideally it's on the top here so it'll also swoop up a little bit so this bud right here fits that build perfectly so i'm just going to prune it down to this bud which will take off all that swooping motion that we've got going on currently so here we go we're gonna leave a little bit of a stub right there just like that takes off all that swooping action that we don't want there's only one other branch that i want to prune on this tree and that's at the top so let me show you that now so as you can see i still have it tied up although i could probably remove that after this year as you can also see i've got way more than the three to five branches that i was suggesting i'm not really worried about it i'm gonna do my own interpretation of it i feel like as long as it has you know light then it should be fine then it will be fine i'm gonna i guess it's gonna be a little bit of an experiment but i know it'll be fine a lot of this is also fruiting wood like this back here there's some fruiting wood i've even got some up here and down here and obviously don't remove that down here i obviously don't want to remove that so 12 branches i'll be leaving but i'm going to be maintaining it over the years and i'll be taking you guys along now the brands that i was talking about is that little fork that you have here and this is kind of what i'm talking about with guiding the tree you can see that i've got two branches coming off of the same area which is not ideal it's going to swell up so you're just going to want to remove one of them however if you look a little further you can see that this branch is already here which currently is being shared right above this one so that's not good these two are going to compete for light so ideally what i want to do is remove this one and then just let this one take over because this has more of its own area you know this one is a little it's going on a slightly different angle than this one down below here so that's the type of things i would want you to think about when you're making these pruning cuts now i'm going to prune this which might start sparking little buds and growth happening at the cut point here which you're going to want to take out when the time comes you could just rub off the little little buds there leave a little bit of a stub and there we go so there's a little bit of a stub there it's a little bit of a stub it's going to have more branch spark out and we're going to want to remove those because we already have a main branch in this one that's already going to be the main scaffold so we don't need that branch any branches beside it so that's pretty much this tree done it's it's very minor like i said it's just small changes that you're making to the tree so let's go on to the next one now so this is my odisso apple and i'm really glad that i have multiple trees to prune because it really allows me to show you some of the different scenarios that you're going to run into when you're pruning your trees so with this one there's really only one branch that i want to remove and that's the fact that they have two central leaders you don't want that you want just a single central leader so that you know you just have one single trunk coming up where all the energy can go into having two is not good it's just gonna compe they're just gonna compete together and you just don't want that ideally you just have one where all the energy can go into i'm gonna leave this branch right here this could be a side branch or alternatively really what you could do is if you didn't so let's say i didn't want this branch here what i could do is prune it off right there it would then have a new leader here to take over rather than this one but i don't mind this branch being here so i can just prune this lower one off and that is what i'm gonna do so same thing with the other one i'm gonna leave a little bit of a stub here and any branches that are gonna come off of it i might remove we'll just take it as it happens it's a bit of a stub it's kind of hard to do one-handed but there it goes and that's really all i want to do to this tree one single leader alternatively if i didn't want it to be this high i could take down this height down a little bit this might be too high ah i don't mind my tree being about seven or eight foot high so i'm going to leave it in this case but you might decide that you want to reduce the height on this a little bit in which case she would just take it down to one of these buds that grows a favorable direction so i can take over you know what actually [Music] i might just take it off a little bit because you're going to get i'm going to prune this off and i'm going to have essentially a second row of scaffolds that are going to be the canopy of the tree up here that's part of the modified central leader technique there is to have your scaffolds down low and have your central leader all the way to tippy top have a second um second set of scaffolds that are gonna keep it small so i thought i could have to be a little bit taller but you're gonna have to take that second scaffold in the top here you have to keep that in mind so i actually will have to prune this off because if i have a scaffold up top here that's going to be way too tall even for me so i'm going to prune it down a little bit and then see where i go so i'm gonna take i'm gonna take it down this is probably about two meters so about seven foot then you have to add on another foot for the second set of scaffolds so i'm gonna take it down to here a fair chunk we'll start with that i could always adjust later all right so here we go boom [Music] and that's it so yeah so this is gonna this is gonna subdivide all along here over the course of uh the growing season because you know what they do is they send up a long straight chute and then they subdivide later on so we'll see where the branches come out and uh next year we'll take the next step on to the next tree so the last tree here i kind of messed it with this red maple here but it's the same thing you can see here this this main scaffold is coming out way too vertical okay you can see how it's not coming out horizontal like at all like maybe this branch down here is actually a perfect example it comes out nice and horizontal this one really wants to be the main leader i don't want it to be the main leader because i already have a main leader so this one has to come out that's what's going to be the first operation here get in there burn it off and you can just see how tall it got hello kitty yeah so it just got way too tall i'm going to be shooting for about seven foot as well and then uh extra scaffold the last top scaffold will be another foot so that'll make it eight feet which you know i'm relatively tall so that should be comfortable for me obviously you can adjust this to whatever is comfortable for you this is about seven foot a little bit of a stub here take all that top growth off there we go boom it's done so that's all the pruning i'll be doing on my apple trees this year it's not very much like i said in the first year i'm not you won't have to do a whole lot and if you just do it every year it'll all just become just maintaining it's very easy all right guys so that's all the pruning i'm going to be doing this year on these apple trees and i really feel like this modified central leader is going to be the best way to go about it for these apple trees i just think it's going to be a much more natural looking tree rather than you know they're pretty tailored and catered to trees that you see in a normal orchard i feel like this is going to look more natural and i also think it's going to be more healthy in the long run because it is you know there's more more branching and better branching and all that stuff going on and not like the floss shape i just i'm not a big fan of it even when i do get stoned for at some point i'll probably be pruning them in a similar fashion to be honest and we'll just kind of see how that goes so i appreciate you coming along thank you for watching and we'll see you in the next one",
