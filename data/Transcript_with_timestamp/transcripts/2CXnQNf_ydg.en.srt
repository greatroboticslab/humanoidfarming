1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,000
this is day one of the great challenge

2
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:14,799
so now first job today is to level the

3
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:17,760
field

4
00:00:14,799 --> 00:00:19,039
now lee why is leveling the field so

5
00:00:17,760 --> 00:00:22,960
important and how

6
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:25,279
do we do this for wet seated rice

7
00:00:22,960 --> 00:00:26,000
you're dealing with a with a seedling

8
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
that is

9
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:31,039
two days old young and very fragile

10
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,480
and there's the two most important

11
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:36,320
criteria you've got to meet

12
00:00:32,480 --> 00:00:39,520
early are water control and weed control

13
00:00:36,320 --> 00:00:41,840
and in some ways they're one in the same

14
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
so by leveling you can ensure that each

15
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:44,320
each seedling has a consistent amount of

16
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:46,079
water

17
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,760
or a consistent lack of water depending

18
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,600
on what you're trying to achieve

19
00:00:47,760 --> 00:00:54,480
at the time so we really think

20
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:56,480
leveling the field is the very first and

21
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,079
most important step probably to get the

22
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,079
good crop established

23
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,320
particularly if it's wet seeded rice as

24
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:04,080
we want to do in our agronomy challenge

25
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:07,119
this year

26
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:08,720
yes we're targeting a high yield and for

27
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:10,400
a high yield we need a good

28
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:13,040
establishment density we need a good

29
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:16,479
number of plants in the field so we need

30
00:01:13,040 --> 00:01:18,720
a good survival of and growing of the

31
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,360
the seeds that we we will put out with

32
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:23,280
the drum seeder in two days time

33
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,119
and leveling is definitely the

34
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:27,759
foundation upon which

35
00:01:25,119 --> 00:01:29,680
a good high yield is built and how does

36
00:01:27,759 --> 00:01:31,439
that laser leveling thing work here

37
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:33,200
we have a big tractor we have a

38
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:34,479
attachment back there well what does it

39
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:37,280
actually do

40
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:38,960
right well there's two implement

41
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:39,600
electronic implements talking to each

42
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:41,920
other

43
00:01:39,600 --> 00:01:43,200
the first implement is transmitting

44
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:44,399
transmitting a signal

45
00:01:43,200 --> 00:01:47,119
over there at the other side of the

46
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:50,159
field it's sending a laser beam

47
00:01:47,119 --> 00:01:52,479
and a completely level grade

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:53,759
the second device is picking up that

49
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:57,439
beam

50
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:59,040
and ensuring that the the implement the

51
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,200
rotavator

52
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:02,560
is traveling along the field at a

53
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:04,320
consistent height

54
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:05,600
so if it's traveling a consistent height

55
00:02:04,320 --> 00:02:07,680
it's leaving the soil

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,119
at a consistent height so it's it's

57
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:11,200
achieving that final

58
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:13,200
final leveling we're looking to looking

59
00:02:11,200 --> 00:02:14,800
at yeah lee i don't know what you think

60
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:16,879
but i think you've done a great job this

61
00:02:14,800 --> 00:02:19,120
looks pretty level to me

62
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:20,400
i think it's satisfactory now my

63
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:22,160
leveling coach at the other end of the

64
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,239
field he assures me that this

65
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,680
leveling task is complete the leveling

66
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,800
is satisfactory

67
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:30,319
so we are ready to drum seed in two days

68
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:34,840
time to seed the field

69
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,840
fantastic see you back in two days thank

70
00:02:34,840 --> 00:02:37,840
you

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,200
you
