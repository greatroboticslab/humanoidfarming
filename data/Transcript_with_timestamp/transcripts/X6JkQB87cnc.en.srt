1
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:09,420
say our screen presentation effectively

2
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:13,019
yes we see it okay very good so uh yeah

3
00:00:09,420 --> 00:00:16,379
so I'm Jason and uh I have been working

4
00:00:13,019 --> 00:00:18,660
in Vietnam since 2006 uh in

5
00:00:16,379 --> 00:00:21,539
collaboration with friends at Kanto

6
00:00:18,660 --> 00:00:23,220
University uh have worked there on a

7
00:00:21,539 --> 00:00:25,019
range of different basically soil

8
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:28,920
related projects

9
00:00:25,019 --> 00:00:30,840
um but firstly with ACR there on a rice

10
00:00:28,920 --> 00:00:33,600
shrimp project looking at sustainability

11
00:00:30,840 --> 00:00:36,180
of the right shrimp system uh and then

12
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:38,160
that led on to what we call the focus

13
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:40,320
project which is farmer options for

14
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:44,100
crops under saline conditions

15
00:00:40,320 --> 00:00:47,399
uh and with me uh I have uh Brooke who

16
00:00:44,100 --> 00:00:50,579
who is post-doc on that project so hi

17
00:00:47,399 --> 00:00:54,840
everyone I also have worked in vet um

18
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:56,879
for a while but started in 2015 as part

19
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:00,420
of my undergraduate and I have

20
00:00:56,879 --> 00:01:02,940
progressed through after getting my PhD

21
00:01:00,420 --> 00:01:05,100
and now work full-time on this Focus

22
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:08,280
project and

23
00:01:05,100 --> 00:01:10,799
um interested in soil plants sort of

24
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:13,799
microbial interactions so it's a great

25
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:16,020
great space to explore this

26
00:01:13,799 --> 00:01:20,159
but yeah so uh yeah the project is

27
00:01:16,020 --> 00:01:22,200
funded by Asia and uh and uh it's LED in

28
00:01:20,159 --> 00:01:24,479
Australia by us at Charles State

29
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:27,299
University and our

30
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:28,680
um in-country lead is um Kento

31
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:31,020
University

32
00:01:28,680 --> 00:01:33,540
so

33
00:01:31,020 --> 00:01:36,060
um just as a brief intro because the

34
00:01:33,540 --> 00:01:40,979
delta in Vietnam is hugely important to

35
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:45,240
the country uh it's about 12 of the area

36
00:01:40,979 --> 00:01:47,100
um very flat area and so it is all

37
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:49,860
pretty much less than four meters above

38
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:51,899
sea level except for a few Hills or the

39
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:53,880
locals called mountains

40
00:01:51,899 --> 00:01:55,920
um but yeah so a lot of it's a lot of

41
00:01:53,880 --> 00:01:56,600
it's even less than two meters above sea

42
00:01:55,920 --> 00:01:59,579
level

43
00:01:56,600 --> 00:02:02,100
agriculture is hugely important to the

44
00:01:59,579 --> 00:02:05,840
economy in in the Delta

45
00:02:02,100 --> 00:02:08,940
um with 80 uh of the of the jobs

46
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:12,239
associated with agriculture in some way

47
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:13,920
and the Delta produces over 50 of the

48
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:16,440
country's rice

49
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,540
um production and a lot of that is

50
00:02:16,440 --> 00:02:21,060
exported as well so the economic value

51
00:02:18,540 --> 00:02:22,560
is is quite large

52
00:02:21,060 --> 00:02:25,680
so

53
00:02:22,560 --> 00:02:26,760
um the foodball food bowl of Vietnam is

54
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:28,620
the Delta

55
00:02:26,760 --> 00:02:29,340
however

56
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:31,920
um

57
00:02:29,340 --> 00:02:33,720
over the recent years there's been

58
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,000
competition for the water that's coming

59
00:02:33,720 --> 00:02:39,360
down through the Mekong River so with

60
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:42,060
Upstream water use uh and damming we've

61
00:02:39,360 --> 00:02:45,360
had due to climate change uh drought is

62
00:02:42,060 --> 00:02:48,180
a lot more uh regular now and even the

63
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:50,640
rainfall patterns have been disrupted so

64
00:02:48,180 --> 00:02:52,620
so 10 years ago the dry and wet season

65
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,800
were very set whereas now they're

66
00:02:52,620 --> 00:02:57,360
they're quite variable and unpredictable

67
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:00,180
which causes problems of course to the

68
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:02,940
farming the cropping systems

69
00:03:00,180 --> 00:03:05,879
sea level rise is an issue

70
00:03:02,940 --> 00:03:08,940
um being close to the equator and and so

71
00:03:05,879 --> 00:03:11,760
the seawater eyes has been recorded as

72
00:03:08,940 --> 00:03:12,720
being about 12 to 14 millimeters per

73
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,560
year

74
00:03:12,720 --> 00:03:18,239
and of course as the sea water rises the

75
00:03:16,560 --> 00:03:20,580
salt water starts coming up through the

76
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:22,680
canal and river system and so

77
00:03:20,580 --> 00:03:25,319
um in this diagram in the map here you

78
00:03:22,680 --> 00:03:29,040
can see that there's lines that show the

79
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:32,340
extent of salinity coming through

80
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:35,340
um into the Delta Inland up Upstream up

81
00:03:32,340 --> 00:03:38,220
canals and salinizing the land and so

82
00:03:35,340 --> 00:03:40,560
you can kind of see there in 2010 you

83
00:03:38,220 --> 00:03:44,040
know and it's around the coastal areas

84
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:48,420
or pericosal areas 2016 was a rather

85
00:03:44,040 --> 00:03:51,780
large drought uh effect and salinity

86
00:03:48,420 --> 00:03:53,459
really started to impact rice crops and

87
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:55,500
farmers were were in a lot of trouble

88
00:03:53,459 --> 00:03:56,940
because they they never experienced this

89
00:03:55,500 --> 00:03:58,440
before in some areas because it had

90
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:00,599
moved so far inland and you can see

91
00:03:58,440 --> 00:04:03,780
there in 2020 it happened again

92
00:04:00,599 --> 00:04:05,640
and even further in some areas and so

93
00:04:03,780 --> 00:04:07,980
you literally have a situation where

94
00:04:05,640 --> 00:04:09,900
people who have been able to farm a

95
00:04:07,980 --> 00:04:12,659
certain way for decades all of a sudden

96
00:04:09,900 --> 00:04:14,819
uh were starting to be impacted by this

97
00:04:12,659 --> 00:04:17,280
sea water rise on the salt water

98
00:04:14,819 --> 00:04:19,199
intrusion coming up the canal system and

99
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,139
of course their response once that

100
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:24,840
happened was okay I can't irrigate from

101
00:04:22,139 --> 00:04:27,120
the river anymore because it's saline so

102
00:04:24,840 --> 00:04:29,699
old groundwater pump instead and of

103
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:33,600
course removing water from a Delta

104
00:04:29,699 --> 00:04:36,720
system uh makes the land subsidence

105
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,320
worse and so whilst the sea water rise

106
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:43,020
is that 12 to 14 millimeters per year

107
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:45,960
land subsidence is around 40 millimeters

108
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,120
per year and so the net effect of that

109
00:04:45,960 --> 00:04:50,280
of course is around 50 mils millimeters

110
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:52,680
a year in a system where you are two

111
00:04:50,280 --> 00:04:56,160
meters above sea level so that's like

112
00:04:52,680 --> 00:04:57,720
that's pretty that's a bad situation and

113
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,840
that's the situation that we're working

114
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:03,660
in and of course the problem is that

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:06,000
um that salinity and the effect of the

116
00:05:03,660 --> 00:05:09,060
drought uh basically you have hundreds

117
00:05:06,000 --> 00:05:11,940
of thousands of hectares impacted by by

118
00:05:09,060 --> 00:05:15,000
salt and by lack of water and you have

119
00:05:11,940 --> 00:05:18,240
all that loss of production uh loss of

120
00:05:15,000 --> 00:05:20,100
fun farm income and impact on

121
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:21,240
communities rural communities so that's

122
00:05:20,100 --> 00:05:24,300
our problem

123
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:26,639
and of course this the worst of this

124
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:29,880
situation the the worst of the saltwater

125
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:33,000
intrusion and the drought uh occurs in

126
00:05:29,880 --> 00:05:34,320
the dry season so in in a lot of areas

127
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:36,960
through the Delta they'll grow three

128
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:40,560
crops of rice a year and and our problem

129
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:43,500
is largely in this early dry season uh

130
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:46,139
situation and so uh it's this third rice

131
00:05:43,500 --> 00:05:47,940
crop that gets often will get killed by

132
00:05:46,139 --> 00:05:50,160
the salinity but even in areas where

133
00:05:47,940 --> 00:05:52,440
they grow two rice crops they stretch

134
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:55,139
that out such that that second rice crop

135
00:05:52,440 --> 00:05:58,860
is still susceptible uh in some years to

136
00:05:55,139 --> 00:06:01,320
to impact spice salt so our what we're

137
00:05:58,860 --> 00:06:04,500
looking at is alternatives to rice in

138
00:06:01,320 --> 00:06:07,259
this dry season period uh and the the

139
00:06:04,500 --> 00:06:08,699
farmers that that we work with and the

140
00:06:07,259 --> 00:06:10,259
the darts of the Department Of

141
00:06:08,699 --> 00:06:12,419
Agricultural and rural development

142
00:06:10,259 --> 00:06:15,000
government agencies that we work with

143
00:06:12,419 --> 00:06:17,280
they all say you can

144
00:06:15,000 --> 00:06:21,360
teach us to grow new crops we can use

145
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:23,400
new soil techniques uh but the the crop

146
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,500
has to be valuable we have to it has to

147
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:27,300
have a stronger market value than rice

148
00:06:25,500 --> 00:06:29,639
because we can grow more rice and the

149
00:06:27,300 --> 00:06:31,979
farmers will still be poor so the

150
00:06:29,639 --> 00:06:33,840
alternative has to be has to be a

151
00:06:31,979 --> 00:06:36,020
marketable profitable crop and so we

152
00:06:33,840 --> 00:06:39,539
focus on that as well

153
00:06:36,020 --> 00:06:43,080
so in looking at these alternative crops

154
00:06:39,539 --> 00:06:44,759
um we look at the crop but also the soil

155
00:06:43,080 --> 00:06:47,580
management and the agricultural

156
00:06:44,759 --> 00:06:49,500
management of the field to to be able to

157
00:06:47,580 --> 00:06:51,720
grow those crops so we've kind of got

158
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:54,419
the biophysical the the crop the

159
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:56,460
selection of the crop species and also

160
00:06:54,419 --> 00:06:59,819
variety and then the soil management

161
00:06:56,460 --> 00:07:01,560
that supports that that that crop and

162
00:06:59,819 --> 00:07:03,360
that sort of thing Brook will go into

163
00:07:01,560 --> 00:07:05,580
more detail but we're talking about

164
00:07:03,360 --> 00:07:09,419
raised beds to minimize the effects of

165
00:07:05,580 --> 00:07:11,580
of water logging mulches to minimize

166
00:07:09,419 --> 00:07:14,100
evaporation and decrease the effects of

167
00:07:11,580 --> 00:07:16,860
salinity for example uh and then of

168
00:07:14,100 --> 00:07:19,500
course there's nutrition on top of that

169
00:07:16,860 --> 00:07:21,960
uh we are looking at the socioeconomic

170
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:24,780
value chain sort of market analysis so

171
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:26,580
you know if we grow these crops is there

172
00:07:24,780 --> 00:07:28,440
a market for them what are those markets

173
00:07:26,580 --> 00:07:31,560
what are the barriers to adoption of

174
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,300
those crops within the supply chain uh

175
00:07:31,560 --> 00:07:34,560
so we're examining those within the

176
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:36,419
project

177
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:39,240
we need to have a really good

178
00:07:36,419 --> 00:07:42,060
understanding of how salinity of the

179
00:07:39,240 --> 00:07:46,080
soil and the waterways changes through

180
00:07:42,060 --> 00:07:48,000
time and space and so uh if you look

181
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:50,099
through the literature and online you'll

182
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:52,440
see maps of the Delta that change that

183
00:07:50,099 --> 00:07:55,259
show salinity but often they're created

184
00:07:52,440 --> 00:07:57,840
by monitoring points in the waterways

185
00:07:55,259 --> 00:08:00,180
and not actually measuring salt in soil

186
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:01,560
or salinity in soil and so we're looking

187
00:08:00,180 --> 00:08:03,180
at doing that

188
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:06,060
um you know by a range of different

189
00:08:03,180 --> 00:08:08,280
mechanisms and so we have a team of

190
00:08:06,060 --> 00:08:10,440
people who actually measure salinity in

191
00:08:08,280 --> 00:08:12,300
soil and also the waterways but we also

192
00:08:10,440 --> 00:08:14,120
are doing it with remote sensing as well

193
00:08:12,300 --> 00:08:17,280
because we have a really strong

194
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:20,220
GIS team that's capable of doing that

195
00:08:17,280 --> 00:08:23,400
sort of stuff for us and so the value of

196
00:08:20,220 --> 00:08:25,199
doing that is we we can understand what

197
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,900
can we grow where can we grow it in

198
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:29,879
under what conditions and then with that

199
00:08:27,900 --> 00:08:32,219
spatial temporal mapping we actually can

200
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:34,140
match up where you're going to get a

201
00:08:32,219 --> 00:08:37,620
large enough scale of land to support

202
00:08:34,140 --> 00:08:40,260
those new crops to maybe then inform

203
00:08:37,620 --> 00:08:43,500
government to say look you can support

204
00:08:40,260 --> 00:08:45,959
Private Industry here or change policy

205
00:08:43,500 --> 00:08:48,959
to to create incentives for businesses

206
00:08:45,959 --> 00:08:51,899
to come in and fill this nice part of

207
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:53,459
the supply chain to enable uh uptake of

208
00:08:51,899 --> 00:08:55,380
this alternative crop and give it a

209
00:08:53,459 --> 00:08:57,899
value

210
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:59,339
um and then the fourth part is we're

211
00:08:57,899 --> 00:09:01,680
looking at

212
00:08:59,339 --> 00:09:04,560
um the role of gender in the whole

213
00:09:01,680 --> 00:09:06,660
process from uh knowledge Creation in

214
00:09:04,560 --> 00:09:09,540
the research team through to the

215
00:09:06,660 --> 00:09:12,839
extension to Growers the uptake on farm

216
00:09:09,540 --> 00:09:14,220
and also within Supply chains as well

217
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:18,000
um understanding that it's a really

218
00:09:14,220 --> 00:09:20,279
rapidly moving space and often that

219
00:09:18,000 --> 00:09:22,380
impacts genders differently and so we

220
00:09:20,279 --> 00:09:24,420
need to just understand what we're

221
00:09:22,380 --> 00:09:26,820
dealing with there and and how can we

222
00:09:24,420 --> 00:09:29,660
help offset some of the changes that are

223
00:09:26,820 --> 00:09:29,660
going to be occurring

224
00:09:30,600 --> 00:09:35,640
cool so for the purpose of this

225
00:09:33,779 --> 00:09:38,339
presentation we'll focus on the

226
00:09:35,640 --> 00:09:41,519
biophysical aspect of the project

227
00:09:38,339 --> 00:09:43,920
and that comes down to looking at

228
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:47,279
alternative crops to Rice to suit this

229
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,860
dry season period so when we first

230
00:09:47,279 --> 00:09:53,220
started out we had to make a criteria

231
00:09:49,860 --> 00:09:56,399
that we could identify crops that could

232
00:09:53,220 --> 00:09:59,160
be suitable uh to start with it was

233
00:09:56,399 --> 00:10:02,160
saline tolerant crops so obviously

234
00:09:59,160 --> 00:10:04,800
towards the end of the dry season the

235
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,279
saline intrusion is is really gets quite

236
00:10:04,800 --> 00:10:11,279
high and soil salinization is the worst

237
00:10:08,279 --> 00:10:14,040
during that later reproductive phase so

238
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:16,800
salt tolerant crops that can grow and

239
00:10:14,040 --> 00:10:20,339
reproduce and then create a profitable

240
00:10:16,800 --> 00:10:23,040
yield was a criteria we looked at

241
00:10:20,339 --> 00:10:26,040
what are you sufficient crops or crops

242
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:28,620
that used lower amounts of water to

243
00:10:26,040 --> 00:10:30,660
complete their life cycle was something

244
00:10:28,620 --> 00:10:33,300
that was really important you can get

245
00:10:30,660 --> 00:10:35,279
crops that are salt tolerant but use a

246
00:10:33,300 --> 00:10:37,740
lot of water and in a system where

247
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:39,240
there's fresh water scarcity it's just

248
00:10:37,740 --> 00:10:41,040
not suitable

249
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,600
um there's a risk there's a higher risk

250
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:45,420
of failure

251
00:10:42,600 --> 00:10:48,660
we also needed crops that could fit the

252
00:10:45,420 --> 00:10:51,000
climates of the Mekong Delta in that dry

253
00:10:48,660 --> 00:10:55,500
season the temperatures can get to 35

254
00:10:51,000 --> 00:10:57,360
degrees we get these variable very low

255
00:10:55,500 --> 00:11:00,480
rainfall patterns you're relying on

256
00:10:57,360 --> 00:11:03,600
irrigation so these sort of crops that

257
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:05,880
fit there not not a crop that's a cold

258
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:09,540
tolerant sort of crop

259
00:11:05,880 --> 00:11:12,300
they had to be able to work in with the

260
00:11:09,540 --> 00:11:15,060
available labor that exists in these

261
00:11:12,300 --> 00:11:19,140
small holder Farms there are some crops

262
00:11:15,060 --> 00:11:21,440
that can fit both the salt tolerant and

263
00:11:19,140 --> 00:11:24,360
water use efficient criteria but require

264
00:11:21,440 --> 00:11:26,700
great amounts of manual labor and that

265
00:11:24,360 --> 00:11:28,920
just doesn't work in the system so

266
00:11:26,700 --> 00:11:31,620
finding something that we can adapt with

267
00:11:28,920 --> 00:11:33,420
the available mechanization and tools

268
00:11:31,620 --> 00:11:36,779
available to Farmers

269
00:11:33,420 --> 00:11:39,120
and most of all as as Jason said it had

270
00:11:36,779 --> 00:11:41,760
to be something that is profitable at

271
00:11:39,120 --> 00:11:44,940
the end of the day for the farmers

272
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:45,899
because they need a yield to sell at

273
00:11:44,940 --> 00:11:47,640
Market

274
00:11:45,899 --> 00:11:51,180
um otherwise there's there's no point in

275
00:11:47,640 --> 00:11:53,399
investing in this so we sort of based

276
00:11:51,180 --> 00:11:56,100
um uh our crop selection of these

277
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:58,260
criteria came up with a few different

278
00:11:56,100 --> 00:12:00,000
um species to test and understanding

279
00:11:58,260 --> 00:12:02,700
that this there's there will always be

280
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:05,820
more species we can't test them all but

281
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:09,000
we can look at the adoption protocols

282
00:12:05,820 --> 00:12:10,980
and practices of how that occurs

283
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:13,380
so we

284
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:15,360
um did a range of glass house and

285
00:12:13,380 --> 00:12:19,079
Greenhouse trials both in Australia and

286
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:20,339
Vietnam and these helped us sort of work

287
00:12:19,079 --> 00:12:22,260
out

288
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:25,079
um the salinity and drought or water use

289
00:12:22,260 --> 00:12:28,079
screening of different species

290
00:12:25,079 --> 00:12:30,959
as well as once we identified species

291
00:12:28,079 --> 00:12:33,720
the varieties available in Vietnam that

292
00:12:30,959 --> 00:12:37,079
could be best suited to those perhaps

293
00:12:33,720 --> 00:12:39,300
different spatial areas there may be

294
00:12:37,079 --> 00:12:40,740
areas that are sale unaffected but has

295
00:12:39,300 --> 00:12:42,800
lots of water

296
00:12:40,740 --> 00:12:45,060
and there are varieties that suit that

297
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:49,019
alternatively there are areas of the

298
00:12:45,060 --> 00:12:51,839
Delta that have less saline intrusion

299
00:12:49,019 --> 00:12:54,839
but water is an issue so you sort of

300
00:12:51,839 --> 00:12:57,899
suit varieties to those areas

301
00:12:54,839 --> 00:13:01,380
we also yes did water use efficiency

302
00:12:57,899 --> 00:13:04,079
sort of screening and through all of

303
00:13:01,380 --> 00:13:06,120
those we did things like measuring plant

304
00:13:04,079 --> 00:13:07,860
and soil parameters

305
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:12,079
um lots of different

306
00:13:07,860 --> 00:13:15,420
relief indexes prolens yields biomasses

307
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:18,540
Roots nodules all those sorts of things

308
00:13:15,420 --> 00:13:21,180
from here the range of trials that we

309
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:24,360
did it helped us establish what we could

310
00:13:21,180 --> 00:13:27,899
use in the field and so some of the

311
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:31,560
crops we've trialled cow pee there's a

312
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:33,779
legume beetroot watermelon Maize quinoa

313
00:13:31,560 --> 00:13:36,540
we've we've done a range of different

314
00:13:33,779 --> 00:13:39,060
crops and we utilize the information

315
00:13:36,540 --> 00:13:42,899
from The Glass House and Greenhouse

316
00:13:39,060 --> 00:13:45,240
trials and to work out where they are

317
00:13:42,899 --> 00:13:48,600
best suited in the delta

318
00:13:45,240 --> 00:13:51,839
we have trials across uh it's a transect

319
00:13:48,600 --> 00:13:54,120
across the Delta starting in sock Trang

320
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:56,820
which is quite close to the coast where

321
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,820
saline intrusion is the worst all the

322
00:13:56,820 --> 00:14:02,459
way up to Ang Yang where it's a broader

323
00:13:59,820 --> 00:14:04,620
scale cropping systems freshwater

324
00:14:02,459 --> 00:14:07,200
scarcity is more of an issue rather than

325
00:14:04,620 --> 00:14:10,700
saline intrusion so there's an adoption

326
00:14:07,200 --> 00:14:14,040
of different species there

327
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:16,740
we have these dry season trials and then

328
00:14:14,040 --> 00:14:19,380
it goes back into rice cropping after

329
00:14:16,740 --> 00:14:22,740
we're finished and we are looking at

330
00:14:19,380 --> 00:14:25,139
both the performance of our alternative

331
00:14:22,740 --> 00:14:29,459
species and then things like the impacts

332
00:14:25,139 --> 00:14:31,380
of that on Rice afterwards as well as

333
00:14:29,459 --> 00:14:33,899
you know different varieties where they

334
00:14:31,380 --> 00:14:37,320
suit where they're best located

335
00:14:33,899 --> 00:14:39,839
so with those field trials we've got the

336
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:42,300
species that we've selected but we've

337
00:14:39,839 --> 00:14:46,680
also looked at different management

338
00:14:42,300 --> 00:14:48,480
practices that we can use to enhance the

339
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:51,240
and optimize the growth of these

340
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:55,199
alternative crops

341
00:14:51,240 --> 00:14:57,660
the we use a soil monitoring moisture

342
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,940
device called chameleon soil moisture

343
00:14:57,660 --> 00:15:01,740
sensors and these are australian-made

344
00:14:59,940 --> 00:15:05,779
and I'll go into detail in the next

345
00:15:01,740 --> 00:15:08,760
slide but we help farmers understand

346
00:15:05,779 --> 00:15:10,920
irrigation schedules they're familiar

347
00:15:08,760 --> 00:15:14,120
with growing rice which is obviously

348
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:18,180
flood irrigation these Upland crops

349
00:15:14,120 --> 00:15:21,120
different water requirements we can make

350
00:15:18,180 --> 00:15:23,519
more efficient water decisions and so

351
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:25,980
we're using these tools to test those

352
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:29,339
thresholds there

353
00:15:25,980 --> 00:15:31,860
uh rice straw mulching

354
00:15:29,339 --> 00:15:35,279
um different mulching trials we're doing

355
00:15:31,860 --> 00:15:38,160
rate trials combinations with things

356
00:15:35,279 --> 00:15:40,680
like compost and biochar

357
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:43,199
um chameleons so monitoring irrigation

358
00:15:40,680 --> 00:15:46,199
with mulch so it's just integrating

359
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:48,180
these different management practices in

360
00:15:46,199 --> 00:15:51,600
things like raised beds as you can see

361
00:15:48,180 --> 00:15:53,120
in one of the pictures up the top there

362
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:58,500
so

363
00:15:53,120 --> 00:16:01,800
chameleons are a pretty cool device they

364
00:15:58,500 --> 00:16:03,959
are developed originally by csiro in

365
00:16:01,800 --> 00:16:06,300
Australia and now they're sold through

366
00:16:03,959 --> 00:16:10,440
the virtual irrigation company Academy

367
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:13,199
which is a non-for-profit organization

368
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:16,920
they measure soil moisture through soil

369
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:19,560
tension and the beauty about this is

370
00:16:16,920 --> 00:16:20,120
rather than interpreting

371
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,440
um

372
00:16:20,120 --> 00:16:25,620
something that could be complex to a

373
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:28,320
farmer is in a reading in kilopascals it

374
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:30,959
comes up with a traffic light system to

375
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:32,100
indicate the level of soil moisture

376
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:35,519
that's there

377
00:16:32,100 --> 00:16:38,040
and this makes it really easy to use it

378
00:16:35,519 --> 00:16:40,320
provides real-time data back to the

379
00:16:38,040 --> 00:16:43,920
farmer and it's relatively cheap

380
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:47,220
compared to things like tensiometers

381
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:49,620
uh they are however limited by um quite

382
00:16:47,220 --> 00:16:52,139
high levels of salinity and where

383
00:16:49,620 --> 00:16:54,420
working to see where those sort of

384
00:16:52,139 --> 00:16:56,100
thresholds exist and how they fit in

385
00:16:54,420 --> 00:16:58,560
with our system

386
00:16:56,100 --> 00:17:01,560
so the traffic light system just very

387
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:05,100
quickly blue is

388
00:17:01,560 --> 00:17:07,799
um it's been calibrated to mean you've

389
00:17:05,100 --> 00:17:10,020
got a soil tension between zero and

390
00:17:07,799 --> 00:17:11,579
minus 22 kilobasicals so your soil is

391
00:17:10,020 --> 00:17:12,720
essentially wet you don't need to

392
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:16,020
irrigate it

393
00:17:12,720 --> 00:17:18,179
brain is moist and once a farmer sees

394
00:17:16,020 --> 00:17:22,020
the red lights come up they know they

395
00:17:18,179 --> 00:17:25,319
have to irrigate you can have a multiple

396
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:27,900
different layers so that each light

397
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:29,880
corresponds to its own sensor and that

398
00:17:27,900 --> 00:17:32,460
sensor can be put at different depths so

399
00:17:29,880 --> 00:17:35,039
you could have zero to five five to ten

400
00:17:32,460 --> 00:17:37,559
ten to Fifteen centimeters or we use

401
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:40,500
them spatially because we've got shallow

402
00:17:37,559 --> 00:17:43,980
rooted species we might use them between

403
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:46,740
treatments to determine what irrigation

404
00:17:43,980 --> 00:17:49,080
is happening there so it's just it's a

405
00:17:46,740 --> 00:17:52,200
really useful tool for Farmer engagement

406
00:17:49,080 --> 00:17:53,760
and as an educational tool but also a

407
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,260
research tool for us

408
00:17:53,760 --> 00:17:57,600
so

409
00:17:55,260 --> 00:18:00,360
um there is a chameleon card version

410
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:03,120
which is a cheaper

411
00:18:00,360 --> 00:18:06,000
um method of it but it doesn't log data

412
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:08,460
like the Wi-Fi one does so you can see a

413
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:10,440
farmer here um in Vietnam

414
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:13,860
I think the video will play the lights

415
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:16,080
flashing so he attaches the wire and

416
00:18:13,860 --> 00:18:18,539
then it will indicate I think a green

417
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,480
light there so hopefully he doesn't go

418
00:18:18,539 --> 00:18:23,940
and irrigate that crop but um yeah super

419
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:25,380
super easy to use so that's what we're

420
00:18:23,940 --> 00:18:27,840
sort of

421
00:18:25,380 --> 00:18:29,760
um utilizing in our field trials yeah

422
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:32,400
and without without that intervention

423
00:18:29,760 --> 00:18:34,320
the the farmer Behavior that's been

424
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,360
observed is they irrigate every day

425
00:18:34,320 --> 00:18:38,400
because they think they have to and

426
00:18:36,360 --> 00:18:40,919
they've got no other information to say

427
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:42,900
that they that's not a good idea but

428
00:18:40,919 --> 00:18:44,460
we've used The Chameleons to show to

429
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:45,900
demonstrate that actually you don't need

430
00:18:44,460 --> 00:18:49,020
to irrigate every day

431
00:18:45,900 --> 00:18:50,760
yeah so when

432
00:18:49,020 --> 00:18:53,000
um this is just an example of sort of a

433
00:18:50,760 --> 00:18:56,220
field trial experiment we've got set up

434
00:18:53,000 --> 00:18:58,020
and we have what we would call the

435
00:18:56,220 --> 00:19:00,980
Pharma practice which is that irrigating

436
00:18:58,020 --> 00:19:04,799
every day or whatever they perceive as

437
00:19:00,980 --> 00:19:06,900
their ideal irrigation and and what

438
00:19:04,799 --> 00:19:08,400
we've found is it is follow something

439
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:11,580
along the lines of what they would do

440
00:19:08,400 --> 00:19:15,059
with rice and then we compare that to

441
00:19:11,580 --> 00:19:18,260
our treatments of a chameleon with no

442
00:19:15,059 --> 00:19:21,120
straw and then various rates of straw

443
00:19:18,260 --> 00:19:24,299
mulch to see what water savings we can

444
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:26,220
get and it's been we've done this over a

445
00:19:24,299 --> 00:19:28,440
few years now and the results are really

446
00:19:26,220 --> 00:19:30,960
consistent and exciting

447
00:19:28,440 --> 00:19:33,299
we have found Enzo

448
00:19:30,960 --> 00:19:36,360
um we'll report uh beetroot or red beets

449
00:19:33,299 --> 00:19:38,280
whatever you'd like to call it

450
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:42,419
um this is just some from a recent trial

451
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:44,940
that we did and along the y-axis you can

452
00:19:42,419 --> 00:19:48,240
see the water applied so that's how much

453
00:19:44,940 --> 00:19:51,179
water over the growing season that

454
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:52,919
um this trial used and we used farmers

455
00:19:51,179 --> 00:19:55,559
in there so we're engaging the farmers

456
00:19:52,919 --> 00:19:56,940
in the field trials and getting sort of

457
00:19:55,559 --> 00:19:59,640
buying there

458
00:19:56,940 --> 00:20:03,539
we can see your First Column is a

459
00:19:59,640 --> 00:20:06,539
chameleon with no Mulch and um so that

460
00:20:03,539 --> 00:20:08,160
was you know you're irrigating based off

461
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:11,039
what the chameleon says but you don't

462
00:20:08,160 --> 00:20:13,200
have any mulch the next one is the same

463
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,020
it's chameleon but you've got seven tons

464
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:19,440
of rice straw there and that's then

465
00:20:16,020 --> 00:20:22,320
compared to a farmer's irrigation with

466
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:25,740
10 tons of mulch so more mops than the

467
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:27,780
chameleon one yeah so our seven ton was

468
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:29,280
something that we came up with with our

469
00:20:27,780 --> 00:20:31,500
experiments sort of demonstrated that

470
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,620
seven tons was the optimal optimal rate

471
00:20:31,500 --> 00:20:36,360
for rice rice straw mulch whereas the

472
00:20:34,620 --> 00:20:38,299
farmers were doing tent hunt as their

473
00:20:36,360 --> 00:20:41,039
standard practice so that's why that

474
00:20:38,299 --> 00:20:43,860
rate is different a bit of a comparison

475
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,260
we're trying to also show there's

476
00:20:43,860 --> 00:20:49,860
efficiencies hopefully through less

477
00:20:46,260 --> 00:20:51,960
labor and straw and use like that and

478
00:20:49,860 --> 00:20:54,840
this was this was really cool because we

479
00:20:51,960 --> 00:20:58,140
had here's our beetroot yields in tons

480
00:20:54,840 --> 00:20:59,820
per hectare and you can see

481
00:20:58,140 --> 00:21:02,580
um mulching makes a huge difference so

482
00:20:59,820 --> 00:21:03,600
chameleon no mulch is significantly less

483
00:21:02,580 --> 00:21:06,419
yield

484
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:08,760
but the chameleon with seven tons per

485
00:21:06,419 --> 00:21:11,220
hectare and then the farmer irrigation

486
00:21:08,760 --> 00:21:14,280
with 10 tons there was no yield

487
00:21:11,220 --> 00:21:17,880
difference so the take-home message is

488
00:21:14,280 --> 00:21:19,020
that you can use less water and less

489
00:21:17,880 --> 00:21:22,020
straw

490
00:21:19,020 --> 00:21:25,080
if you use a chameleon and you get the

491
00:21:22,020 --> 00:21:27,000
same yield and we've had this

492
00:21:25,080 --> 00:21:29,940
um not just across with beetroot we've

493
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:32,640
had it with Maize watermelon we're

494
00:21:29,940 --> 00:21:35,760
extending that now into you know cow pea

495
00:21:32,640 --> 00:21:38,280
and quinoa so it's exciting to show the

496
00:21:35,760 --> 00:21:41,039
farmers these benefits they don't have

497
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:43,919
to water every day you don't have to put

498
00:21:41,039 --> 00:21:45,600
on as much straw but you still get you

499
00:21:43,919 --> 00:21:47,460
know the same yields that you would if

500
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:51,240
you used that much water and that much

501
00:21:47,460 --> 00:21:53,580
mulch so so this is this is really

502
00:21:51,240 --> 00:21:55,980
um it's just a feel-good moment when you

503
00:21:53,580 --> 00:22:00,059
see this data

504
00:21:55,980 --> 00:22:03,179
so what we know from from where we are

505
00:22:00,059 --> 00:22:04,620
at this point in the project is that we

506
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,780
have found

507
00:22:04,620 --> 00:22:08,280
um alternative crops work and as I've

508
00:22:06,780 --> 00:22:10,260
mentioned before

509
00:22:08,280 --> 00:22:12,720
you know people approach us all the time

510
00:22:10,260 --> 00:22:15,840
with different crops you know have you

511
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:17,880
tried this have you tried that we're not

512
00:22:15,840 --> 00:22:20,220
there to find um

513
00:22:17,880 --> 00:22:23,460
the one crop that will save everything

514
00:22:20,220 --> 00:22:27,059
it's the principle of how we Implement

515
00:22:23,460 --> 00:22:29,700
and adopt new crops and the criteria

516
00:22:27,059 --> 00:22:31,679
that we need to focus on and how we can

517
00:22:29,700 --> 00:22:34,980
work that into a system that's been

518
00:22:31,679 --> 00:22:38,340
predominantly rice based for for many

519
00:22:34,980 --> 00:22:41,520
many years so we've grown these crops

520
00:22:38,340 --> 00:22:44,340
novel crops in areas that have not seen

521
00:22:41,520 --> 00:22:45,780
alternative crops and they work which is

522
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,240
good too and they're profitable

523
00:22:45,780 --> 00:22:50,159
profitable yeah yeah be true I don't

524
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:52,500
have the quote here but we interviewed

525
00:22:50,159 --> 00:22:56,220
this Farmer in the picture and he made I

526
00:22:52,500 --> 00:22:58,500
think 27 million Dong per

527
00:22:56,220 --> 00:23:00,679
um 1000 meters squared compared to Rice

528
00:22:58,500 --> 00:23:04,980
which was two or three thousand so

529
00:23:00,679 --> 00:23:08,400
significant increases in farm income

530
00:23:04,980 --> 00:23:09,780
which is fantastic and and I think the

531
00:23:08,400 --> 00:23:12,600
next Point

532
00:23:09,780 --> 00:23:15,240
um you get that water saving if you

533
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:18,480
combine some management practices to

534
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:20,159
help optimize those crops there will be

535
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:22,140
um there's many other things that you

536
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,679
can do but these are two

537
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:28,200
uh achievable and accessible tools for

538
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:30,539
Farmers they have rice straw chameleons

539
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:33,659
are relatively cheap we're looking at

540
00:23:30,539 --> 00:23:35,700
ways we can you know get more of these

541
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:39,080
tools out to Farmers or increase

542
00:23:35,700 --> 00:23:42,360
awareness of irrigation

543
00:23:39,080 --> 00:23:44,820
the seven ton mulch seems to be the

544
00:23:42,360 --> 00:23:48,600
magic number consistently throughout our

545
00:23:44,820 --> 00:23:50,400
trials 10 tons it either you know it

546
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:53,100
doesn't improve yield or improve

547
00:23:50,400 --> 00:23:55,440
anything so that's a good threshold to

548
00:23:53,100 --> 00:23:56,820
know and we sort of work from from that

549
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:58,860
now

550
00:23:56,820 --> 00:24:02,039
um it's better than two and a half tons

551
00:23:58,860 --> 00:24:05,520
but but seven tons is no better than ten

552
00:24:02,039 --> 00:24:10,080
so that's that's um useful to know

553
00:24:05,520 --> 00:24:12,059
and we have found that 25 saving in

554
00:24:10,080 --> 00:24:14,280
labor and that would be

555
00:24:12,059 --> 00:24:16,380
um through irrigation like not having to

556
00:24:14,280 --> 00:24:18,840
irrigate daily

557
00:24:16,380 --> 00:24:20,820
um you can get that back to a household

558
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:23,520
and we have interviews where Farmers

559
00:24:20,820 --> 00:24:25,799
have said that they now have more time

560
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,360
to take their grandchildren to school

561
00:24:25,799 --> 00:24:29,159
and things like that so there's social

562
00:24:27,360 --> 00:24:33,120
benefits as well

563
00:24:29,159 --> 00:24:34,679
as well as um 25 Savings in fuel and

564
00:24:33,120 --> 00:24:37,200
that's from running pumps and things

565
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:39,720
like that so there are all these sort of

566
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:41,580
other benefits to the alternative crops

567
00:24:39,720 --> 00:24:45,059
and the management practices that we're

568
00:24:41,580 --> 00:24:47,220
looking at however there are still of

569
00:24:45,059 --> 00:24:49,320
course things that we still need to know

570
00:24:47,220 --> 00:24:52,520
and and need to find these out and these

571
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:57,059
are research questions of Interest

572
00:24:52,520 --> 00:24:59,220
timing being a big one so the

573
00:24:57,059 --> 00:25:02,240
um finding those sewing Windows where we

574
00:24:59,220 --> 00:25:05,900
avoid abiotic stresses like temperature

575
00:25:02,240 --> 00:25:09,240
the saline intrusion those sort of water

576
00:25:05,900 --> 00:25:11,280
limitations they they are really

577
00:25:09,240 --> 00:25:13,140
important in to fit in with a cropping

578
00:25:11,280 --> 00:25:14,880
calendar that of rice that's already

579
00:25:13,140 --> 00:25:16,380
there no and that's a really big

580
00:25:14,880 --> 00:25:18,419
challenge because

581
00:25:16,380 --> 00:25:19,919
um because one of the effects of the

582
00:25:18,419 --> 00:25:22,260
climate change is the unpredictable

583
00:25:19,919 --> 00:25:25,020
weather yeah so in our in our journey

584
00:25:22,260 --> 00:25:28,559
working there the last few years we've

585
00:25:25,020 --> 00:25:31,799
had the early storm events that have

586
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:34,380
flooded types and we've had the the heat

587
00:25:31,799 --> 00:25:37,140
wave effects that you know kill

588
00:25:34,380 --> 00:25:39,360
seedlings whereas you know the year

589
00:25:37,140 --> 00:25:41,400
before that didn't happen and so

590
00:25:39,360 --> 00:25:43,020
um and when you talk to the farmers has

591
00:25:41,400 --> 00:25:45,299
it been this hot before and they've

592
00:25:43,020 --> 00:25:47,220
never seen it this hot before so things

593
00:25:45,299 --> 00:25:49,200
are changing and so

594
00:25:47,220 --> 00:25:51,720
um that unpredictability is a real issue

595
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:56,340
for us trying to fit these new crops

596
00:25:51,720 --> 00:25:57,900
into into the system yeah and then as

597
00:25:56,340 --> 00:26:00,120
Jason said it's fitting them into the

598
00:25:57,900 --> 00:26:03,960
system and then fitting them into their

599
00:26:00,120 --> 00:26:07,740
cultural practices so Vietnam has a big

600
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:11,159
holiday in the in our new year but it's

601
00:26:07,740 --> 00:26:14,400
it's tet and when you speak to Farmers

602
00:26:11,159 --> 00:26:16,860
or researchers they say no one will grow

603
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,900
crops over that period because they

604
00:26:16,860 --> 00:26:22,620
require irrigation daily and everyone

605
00:26:18,900 --> 00:26:24,600
takes two weeks off or ten days so it's

606
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:28,320
working out it's you know we might have

607
00:26:24,600 --> 00:26:32,220
the scientific answer but it's how that

608
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:35,100
fits into a socio sort of

609
00:26:32,220 --> 00:26:36,960
um Family household Dynamic practice and

610
00:26:35,100 --> 00:26:39,720
and the implications of changing

611
00:26:36,960 --> 00:26:41,940
something like that we have to sort of

612
00:26:39,720 --> 00:26:43,740
look into that as well

613
00:26:41,940 --> 00:26:46,500
and then

614
00:26:43,740 --> 00:26:48,720
um on top of that it's then optimizing

615
00:26:46,500 --> 00:26:51,480
once we've sort of got the timing right

616
00:26:48,720 --> 00:26:55,080
and it fits into a cycle that works for

617
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:57,840
the farmers how can we optimize those

618
00:26:55,080 --> 00:26:59,820
um plants alternative crops is it

619
00:26:57,840 --> 00:27:02,220
fertilizer is it you know are we looking

620
00:26:59,820 --> 00:27:06,120
at soil constraints those sorts of

621
00:27:02,220 --> 00:27:09,360
things the soil is has been growing rice

622
00:27:06,120 --> 00:27:12,240
for many years there's probably

623
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:14,600
um micronutrient research macronutrient

624
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:18,179
there's there's a whole gamut of

625
00:27:14,600 --> 00:27:19,679
optimization that could go into that to

626
00:27:18,179 --> 00:27:22,200
further

627
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:25,020
um in a way that's low input and and

628
00:27:22,200 --> 00:27:26,520
high productivity high profitability for

629
00:27:25,020 --> 00:27:28,320
Farmers

630
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:30,299
um those are the sort of questions that

631
00:27:28,320 --> 00:27:32,220
we're looking at in the future and of

632
00:27:30,299 --> 00:27:35,460
course those alternative crops if they

633
00:27:32,220 --> 00:27:37,980
have benefit to the subsequent rice crop

634
00:27:35,460 --> 00:27:40,559
that means that you can wind back the

635
00:27:37,980 --> 00:27:43,020
fertilizer inputs then you change the

636
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:45,539
risk profile because now you don't have

637
00:27:43,020 --> 00:27:48,539
so much Capital invested in in

638
00:27:45,539 --> 00:27:50,640
fertilizer for example and so the you

639
00:27:48,539 --> 00:27:52,679
know if the crop fails the losses aren't

640
00:27:50,640 --> 00:27:54,600
as great so there's those sort of things

641
00:27:52,679 --> 00:27:58,380
to take account of as well

642
00:27:54,600 --> 00:28:02,520
yeah so with that that's um a nice

643
00:27:58,380 --> 00:28:05,520
little wrap-up of our project and our

644
00:28:02,520 --> 00:28:07,919
um team and fantastic team members in

645
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,440
Vietnam who really do a great job of

646
00:28:07,919 --> 00:28:12,179
pulling all these field trials and

647
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:14,400
research questions together for us so

648
00:28:12,179 --> 00:28:16,860
it's it's a great place to work and

649
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:19,380
explore these um these big big picture

650
00:28:16,860 --> 00:28:21,960
questions yeah thanks for the

651
00:28:19,380 --> 00:28:25,980
opportunity to present

652
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:28,559
thank you very very much uh for this

653
00:28:25,980 --> 00:28:31,200
wonderful presentation I enjoyed it a

654
00:28:28,559 --> 00:28:35,940
lot and have a few questions myself but

655
00:28:31,200 --> 00:28:40,380
I will give the floor first to others

656
00:28:35,940 --> 00:28:41,880
questions please also comments are

657
00:28:40,380 --> 00:28:46,400
welcome

658
00:28:41,880 --> 00:28:46,400
suggestions and Stefan is first

659
00:28:46,500 --> 00:28:51,779
yeah I know a great presentation and a

660
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:54,539
lot of learning for us in the Asia Mecca

661
00:28:51,779 --> 00:28:58,799
Delta initiative so linking up is really

662
00:28:54,539 --> 00:29:01,700
really useful valuable and hope we can

663
00:28:58,799 --> 00:29:05,100
do this further going forward together

664
00:29:01,700 --> 00:29:05,840
uh that's just one comment but my

665
00:29:05,100 --> 00:29:08,880
question

666
00:29:05,840 --> 00:29:11,039
uh is a little bit around the choices

667
00:29:08,880 --> 00:29:13,620
that you made that the initial crops

668
00:29:11,039 --> 00:29:16,740
that you tested did you do some sort of

669
00:29:13,620 --> 00:29:17,880
market analysis before because uh you

670
00:29:16,740 --> 00:29:19,919
sort of didn't talk about that that's

671
00:29:17,880 --> 00:29:22,380
fine but just to know that you do a

672
00:29:19,919 --> 00:29:24,179
market that's beat-root Market out there

673
00:29:22,380 --> 00:29:26,820
there's a potential there or for the

674
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:30,899
melon or whatever it may be quinoa Etc

675
00:29:26,820 --> 00:29:33,539
over yes yeah so we we didn't as far as

676
00:29:30,899 --> 00:29:36,120
we knew that we couldn't do every single

677
00:29:33,539 --> 00:29:39,059
crop and so we grouped them into sort of

678
00:29:36,120 --> 00:29:41,700
you know serial types or grain crops

679
00:29:39,059 --> 00:29:45,299
vegetables and did it that way

680
00:29:41,700 --> 00:29:48,360
um but um what's what's what I've

681
00:29:45,299 --> 00:29:51,480
learned out of that process is that the

682
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:55,020
scale of operation matters a lot and so

683
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:57,919
there are some small small farms where

684
00:29:55,020 --> 00:30:00,840
perhaps the more labor-intensive niche

685
00:29:57,919 --> 00:30:04,140
uh like beetroot or something like that

686
00:30:00,840 --> 00:30:06,840
which they can sell locally at a at a

687
00:30:04,140 --> 00:30:08,820
high price works for that small farm

688
00:30:06,840 --> 00:30:11,279
whereas if that was done on a bigger

689
00:30:08,820 --> 00:30:12,899
Farm the the higher labor requirement

690
00:30:11,279 --> 00:30:15,240
more labor units all of a sudden that's

691
00:30:12,899 --> 00:30:17,460
not economical anymore whereas if you

692
00:30:15,240 --> 00:30:19,320
move somewhere to a larger scale then

693
00:30:17,460 --> 00:30:21,899
mechanization becomes super important

694
00:30:19,320 --> 00:30:23,700
and something like quinoa is viable

695
00:30:21,899 --> 00:30:26,520
whereas it's not viable on a small farm

696
00:30:23,700 --> 00:30:28,380
because you know it's

697
00:30:26,520 --> 00:30:31,080
you need to be mechanized to actually

698
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:32,039
make that function and so

699
00:30:31,080 --> 00:30:34,260
um

700
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,720
so whilst we're doing those we are doing

701
00:30:34,260 --> 00:30:39,000
those supply chain studies

702
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:41,640
um we we started with the agronomic to

703
00:30:39,000 --> 00:30:43,860
get the ball rolling uh in that and now

704
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,539
we can refine and probably chase the

705
00:30:43,860 --> 00:30:49,320
winners a little bit better if that

706
00:30:45,539 --> 00:30:52,919
makes sense yeah and I think matching up

707
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:55,740
um existing small markets households you

708
00:30:52,919 --> 00:30:57,240
know the growth of vegetables sold on

709
00:30:55,740 --> 00:31:00,840
the side of the road you understand

710
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:02,820
there's a familiar parity there

711
00:31:00,840 --> 00:31:05,159
um and it's just as Jason said matching

712
00:31:02,820 --> 00:31:07,679
that to where those smaller communities

713
00:31:05,159 --> 00:31:12,500
might exist or if it's broader scale and

714
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:12,500
you can get Harvesters in yeah

715
00:31:13,500 --> 00:31:18,960
thanks I my question is actually very

716
00:31:16,320 --> 00:31:21,779
similar so I I use my current power to

717
00:31:18,960 --> 00:31:24,960
jump the line a bit sorry Mike

718
00:31:21,779 --> 00:31:27,059
um how did you come up with the actual

719
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,860
crops that you were testing or that you

720
00:31:27,059 --> 00:31:31,020
tested in the in the field I mean you

721
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,419
you showed the requirements and kind of

722
00:31:31,020 --> 00:31:35,399
the the general

723
00:31:33,419 --> 00:31:39,659
um yeah framework that they should

724
00:31:35,399 --> 00:31:41,880
should meet but that's probably still I

725
00:31:39,659 --> 00:31:44,520
mean dozens of options available did you

726
00:31:41,880 --> 00:31:46,559
sit down and brainstorm or did you have

727
00:31:44,520 --> 00:31:49,500
like a process for that that you ask

728
00:31:46,559 --> 00:31:52,860
experts come to University what was the

729
00:31:49,500 --> 00:31:55,380
so so we so we had we had the literature

730
00:31:52,860 --> 00:31:57,600
we had you know what's possible from the

731
00:31:55,380 --> 00:32:00,179
literature we worked very closely and

732
00:31:57,600 --> 00:32:02,460
and it's my mistake I have not got that

733
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:05,220
on my um my final slide there in terms

734
00:32:02,460 --> 00:32:06,720
of who's in the team but the the dad the

735
00:32:05,220 --> 00:32:08,640
the department of agricultural rural

736
00:32:06,720 --> 00:32:11,580
development we actually worked really

737
00:32:08,640 --> 00:32:14,460
strongly with the the field staff there

738
00:32:11,580 --> 00:32:15,840
to hear what they wanted what they are

739
00:32:14,460 --> 00:32:19,500
interested in or their farmers are

740
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:21,840
interested in and so so we like I guess

741
00:32:19,500 --> 00:32:24,120
quinoa we bought bought in as like that

742
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:25,080
didn't come from Vietnam as an idea but

743
00:32:24,120 --> 00:32:26,820
but

744
00:32:25,080 --> 00:32:29,640
um everything else is pretty much the

745
00:32:26,820 --> 00:32:31,559
the farmers were interested or the dard

746
00:32:29,640 --> 00:32:34,140
staff have seen it grown somewhere else

747
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:37,620
and wondered is that possible

748
00:32:34,140 --> 00:32:39,059
um and so so yeah it was ground up a lot

749
00:32:37,620 --> 00:32:40,380
of the cases but we had the literature

750
00:32:39,059 --> 00:32:42,360
there to sort of fill in well this

751
00:32:40,380 --> 00:32:43,679
should work and that should work or

752
00:32:42,360 --> 00:32:45,840
um when we didn't want to we didn't want

753
00:32:43,679 --> 00:32:48,779
to reinvent the wheel so if you know

754
00:32:45,840 --> 00:32:51,059
people have grown tomatoes then fine we

755
00:32:48,779 --> 00:32:53,760
already know you can do that and so and

756
00:32:51,059 --> 00:32:57,059
and just a quick follow-up was the is it

757
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:58,620
General generally crops that hey are

758
00:32:57,059 --> 00:33:00,659
grown in the Mekong Delta already

759
00:32:58,620 --> 00:33:03,659
because sometimes you also mention new

760
00:33:00,659 --> 00:33:07,740
crops so what's the

761
00:33:03,659 --> 00:33:09,720
the mix between crops that maybe not

762
00:33:07,740 --> 00:33:11,220
those Farmers but that were kind of

763
00:33:09,720 --> 00:33:13,260
common in the Mekong Delta and

764
00:33:11,220 --> 00:33:15,960
completely new ideas

765
00:33:13,260 --> 00:33:18,480
you know the Patriots knew and quinoa's

766
00:33:15,960 --> 00:33:19,559
new so yeah so they're out there our

767
00:33:18,480 --> 00:33:23,220
newbies

768
00:33:19,559 --> 00:33:25,340
um but yeah the um cowpea we were really

769
00:33:23,220 --> 00:33:30,840
Keen to get a legume in the system

770
00:33:25,340 --> 00:33:33,899
soybean was our recommended from Dad and

771
00:33:30,840 --> 00:33:36,779
we with our sort of knowledge of the

772
00:33:33,899 --> 00:33:39,779
literature we tested soybean but knowing

773
00:33:36,779 --> 00:33:41,880
that it's only moderate salt tolerance

774
00:33:39,779 --> 00:33:44,760
and and consequently it failed so

775
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:47,279
looking then they they're interested in

776
00:33:44,760 --> 00:33:50,159
a legume what can we find that fits that

777
00:33:47,279 --> 00:33:51,960
growing calendar and it's as you know

778
00:33:50,159 --> 00:33:54,059
shorter duration was also a big

779
00:33:51,960 --> 00:33:56,399
requirement trying to get something that

780
00:33:54,059 --> 00:34:00,120
can get through its reproductive phases

781
00:33:56,399 --> 00:34:03,419
and avoid those abiotic stresses so

782
00:34:00,120 --> 00:34:06,240
cowpe was was great because it's a

783
00:34:03,419 --> 00:34:07,380
multi-purpose crop and finding crops

784
00:34:06,240 --> 00:34:09,419
that have

785
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,980
um Beyond one benefit whether it's

786
00:34:09,419 --> 00:34:13,260
because it's a legume or it could be

787
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,720
used as a forage crop or it could be

788
00:34:13,260 --> 00:34:18,179
harvested as a bean consumed as a

789
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,040
vegetable those sorts of things became

790
00:34:18,179 --> 00:34:22,260
appealing and then the farmers really

791
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,560
got on board with that which is great so

792
00:34:22,260 --> 00:34:27,899
it's sort of a yeah you know the

793
00:34:25,560 --> 00:34:30,659
suggestions are passed in and we try and

794
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:33,659
optimize what crops might suit that and

795
00:34:30,659 --> 00:34:35,639
if it's um if there's longer term Legacy

796
00:34:33,659 --> 00:34:38,040
effects as well through a nitrogen

797
00:34:35,639 --> 00:34:40,800
fixation I mean what a win for the

798
00:34:38,040 --> 00:34:45,780
system okay so so it's a it's a mixed

799
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:45,780
methods approach yeah yeah okay

800
00:34:46,159 --> 00:34:51,780
Mike uh you've been very patient

801
00:34:49,679 --> 00:34:54,839
yeah thanks very much and thank you for

802
00:34:51,780 --> 00:34:57,900
a very interesting presentation my angle

803
00:34:54,839 --> 00:34:59,460
comes from the Aquatic side the the

804
00:34:57,900 --> 00:35:01,619
fishy side

805
00:34:59,460 --> 00:35:04,560
rather than crops but of course

806
00:35:01,619 --> 00:35:05,940
recognizing that the the Integrated

807
00:35:04,560 --> 00:35:10,800
Systems

808
00:35:05,940 --> 00:35:13,320
rice fish and other crops fish uh is are

809
00:35:10,800 --> 00:35:17,780
of course interesting for for Delta

810
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:20,700
environments today and on another one CG

811
00:35:17,780 --> 00:35:24,060
uh program called asean

812
00:35:20,700 --> 00:35:27,119
we're looking at among other things uh

813
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:29,280
regenerative agriculture which have

814
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:34,020
involved soil health

815
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:35,940
and sometime back James quilty who you

816
00:35:34,020 --> 00:35:39,240
know from acir

817
00:35:35,940 --> 00:35:42,300
asked me and others to evaluate a rice

818
00:35:39,240 --> 00:35:43,680
shrimp project which I think you were

819
00:35:42,300 --> 00:35:44,940
also involved with

820
00:35:43,680 --> 00:35:47,880
and

821
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:51,060
that work promoted a Bayesian belief

822
00:35:47,880 --> 00:35:53,579
network uh probability app

823
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:56,760
so my first question is is that

824
00:35:53,579 --> 00:35:59,660
application still in use and are farmers

825
00:35:56,760 --> 00:35:59,660
finding it useful

826
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:06,720
uh um so I'm not I'm not sure on the um

827
00:36:03,540 --> 00:36:08,880
the uptake of of the BBN app I know

828
00:36:06,720 --> 00:36:10,260
they're very interested I know they've

829
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:12,240
wanted it it was one of the things that

830
00:36:10,260 --> 00:36:13,680
we we need this

831
00:36:12,240 --> 00:36:16,380
um but I'm not sure how far that got

832
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:18,480
developed after that project ended

833
00:36:16,380 --> 00:36:20,099
um but we had it set up we got it to a

834
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:23,760
point where we had the structure there

835
00:36:20,099 --> 00:36:27,000
it functioned but like any any decision

836
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:30,240
support system it's it's value improved

837
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:33,060
with data going into it and so I'm not

838
00:36:30,240 --> 00:36:34,560
sure how much has has happened since the

839
00:36:33,060 --> 00:36:37,140
project ended

840
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:38,820
okay thank you and the next question

841
00:36:37,140 --> 00:36:42,420
part of the question is have you come

842
00:36:38,820 --> 00:36:44,820
across something called a biofunk tool

843
00:36:42,420 --> 00:36:48,359
it measures soil health

844
00:36:44,820 --> 00:36:50,579
by gathering a range of

845
00:36:48,359 --> 00:36:52,440
um soil properties to give a prediction

846
00:36:50,579 --> 00:36:55,140
about soil health

847
00:36:52,440 --> 00:36:57,180
uh short answer no but one of the things

848
00:36:55,140 --> 00:36:58,980
that we've um

849
00:36:57,180 --> 00:37:02,280
we work with the farmers because we

850
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:04,560
initially started with training programs

851
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,359
to train the farmers about salinity as a

852
00:37:04,560 --> 00:37:08,280
as a because it's such a high risk

853
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:09,839
factor for cropping

854
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:13,079
um and what came out of that was

855
00:37:09,839 --> 00:37:15,180
actually they need just soil soil Health

856
00:37:13,079 --> 00:37:17,099
Training and so

857
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,320
um it was amazing what the farmers could

858
00:37:17,099 --> 00:37:21,660
tell you about their soil

859
00:37:19,320 --> 00:37:23,339
um just from their observations like we

860
00:37:21,660 --> 00:37:24,359
keep growing rice and the yields kept

861
00:37:23,339 --> 00:37:26,460
going down we keep putting more

862
00:37:24,359 --> 00:37:28,800
fertilizer on but the yields keep going

863
00:37:26,460 --> 00:37:31,500
down but when we grow these alternative

864
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:33,359
crops Everything Changes in the next you

865
00:37:31,500 --> 00:37:35,640
know the next rice crops better and and

866
00:37:33,359 --> 00:37:36,839
so they they put it together they

867
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:38,040
realize that soil health is really

868
00:37:36,839 --> 00:37:40,260
important but they don't know much about

869
00:37:38,040 --> 00:37:43,380
it and so we have changed our training

870
00:37:40,260 --> 00:37:46,560
from salinity training to soil training

871
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:48,720
soil constraint training and um and

872
00:37:46,560 --> 00:37:50,460
that's we've done it and you'll have to

873
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:52,140
forgive us for just being Australian

874
00:37:50,460 --> 00:37:54,780
people working with Australian farmers

875
00:37:52,140 --> 00:37:56,579
and understanding what that's like uh

876
00:37:54,780 --> 00:37:58,760
we've used the models that we know work

877
00:37:56,579 --> 00:38:01,260
with our farm and took them to Vietnam

878
00:37:58,760 --> 00:38:02,339
and the Vietnamese tell you like oh this

879
00:38:01,260 --> 00:38:03,599
isn't going to work like no one's

880
00:38:02,339 --> 00:38:05,579
interested in this stuff you won't get

881
00:38:03,599 --> 00:38:07,200
Farmers engaged in this week look trust

882
00:38:05,579 --> 00:38:09,660
me it works Farmers love this stuff and

883
00:38:07,200 --> 00:38:11,280
we did it and the farmers engaged and

884
00:38:09,660 --> 00:38:13,560
the diet people oh we've never seen

885
00:38:11,280 --> 00:38:15,480
Farmers engaged like this you know and

886
00:38:13,560 --> 00:38:17,099
so farmers are farmers they they

887
00:38:15,480 --> 00:38:18,660
understand the soil they unders like

888
00:38:17,099 --> 00:38:20,820
they want to know more about it if they

889
00:38:18,660 --> 00:38:23,640
don't know they want to learn and so so

890
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:25,440
that was um that I don't know the bio

891
00:38:23,640 --> 00:38:28,020
fund tool I'm not familiar with it but

892
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:29,040
anything that it links soil fertility or

893
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,099
soil health

894
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,740
to a farmer is is going to work I think

895
00:38:32,099 --> 00:38:37,859
yeah not as long as it's Hands-On

896
00:38:34,740 --> 00:38:41,940
okay two quick extra questions the

897
00:38:37,859 --> 00:38:45,780
chameleon tool what's its lifespan

898
00:38:41,940 --> 00:38:48,140
uh good question it depends where and in

899
00:38:45,780 --> 00:38:52,140
what conditions it's being used

900
00:38:48,140 --> 00:38:55,440
the creator of the chameleon is is

901
00:38:52,140 --> 00:38:58,440
called um Richard sterzaka he's

902
00:38:55,440 --> 00:39:02,579
wonderful and he continues to develop

903
00:38:58,440 --> 00:39:05,040
the product and um takes feedback uh

904
00:39:02,579 --> 00:39:07,020
from from a whole world like range of

905
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:10,140
developing countries that are utilizing

906
00:39:07,020 --> 00:39:13,140
the chameleon uh he's had chameleon

907
00:39:10,140 --> 00:39:15,780
sensors last one cropping season he's

908
00:39:13,140 --> 00:39:19,200
had them last five cropping Seasons so

909
00:39:15,780 --> 00:39:20,460
it's it's finding what parameters affect

910
00:39:19,200 --> 00:39:22,859
those

911
00:39:20,460 --> 00:39:27,060
um and why they would disintegrate

912
00:39:22,859 --> 00:39:29,700
quicker he has work on extra durable

913
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:31,800
sensors that are thicker and he's

914
00:39:29,700 --> 00:39:34,859
working on Coatings and different things

915
00:39:31,800 --> 00:39:37,859
like that to you know expand their

916
00:39:34,859 --> 00:39:37,859
longevity

917
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:45,540
the computer part of the sensor will you

918
00:39:43,380 --> 00:39:47,460
know will last for a very long time it's

919
00:39:45,540 --> 00:39:49,740
just the actual senses that go in the

920
00:39:47,460 --> 00:39:52,020
ground that may need replacing and

921
00:39:49,740 --> 00:39:55,079
they're they're very cheap so

922
00:39:52,020 --> 00:39:58,940
one last question uh have you looked at

923
00:39:55,079 --> 00:39:58,940
genetically modified crops

924
00:39:59,000 --> 00:40:02,599
saline resistance

925
00:40:03,599 --> 00:40:08,640
we haven't no and and there would be you

926
00:40:07,020 --> 00:40:10,800
would have to do a bit of work with

927
00:40:08,640 --> 00:40:12,960
finding policies

928
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:15,980
um and how that matches in the systems

929
00:40:12,960 --> 00:40:19,740
okay yeah great thank you very much

930
00:40:15,980 --> 00:40:22,020
thank you thank you I see it now these

931
00:40:19,740 --> 00:40:25,320
chameleon sensors by the way can I ask

932
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:28,200
roughly yeah so the card the chameleon

933
00:40:25,320 --> 00:40:30,180
card is about fifty dollars Australian

934
00:40:28,200 --> 00:40:32,400
with that comes with three senses

935
00:40:30,180 --> 00:40:37,140
already and

936
00:40:32,400 --> 00:40:38,280
um the Wi-Fi is is 150 200 but looking

937
00:40:37,140 --> 00:40:40,200
at

938
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,660
um so they're actually produced in

939
00:40:40,200 --> 00:40:45,000
Africa which is where Richard started a

940
00:40:42,660 --> 00:40:48,060
lot of his work in Tanzania and

941
00:40:45,000 --> 00:40:50,640
countries like that trying to

942
00:40:48,060 --> 00:40:52,260
um solve Water Crisis issues there which

943
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:55,320
is there's some great work that he's

944
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:57,000
doing and developed a factory

945
00:40:55,320 --> 00:40:59,339
um there so there's they're working on

946
00:40:57,000 --> 00:41:01,020
trying to get them the price lower each

947
00:40:59,339 --> 00:41:04,020
time and more accessible for Farmers

948
00:41:01,020 --> 00:41:06,599
yeah so those cards are our go-to for of

949
00:41:04,020 --> 00:41:10,079
farmers because it's it's you know

950
00:41:06,599 --> 00:41:12,900
economically viable for them yeah yeah I

951
00:41:10,079 --> 00:41:16,619
just see a question in the chat um from

952
00:41:12,900 --> 00:41:19,579
Stefan I think about natural inoculum of

953
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:23,460
the cowpie there is no current available

954
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:26,220
uh viable inoculum that's commercial in

955
00:41:23,460 --> 00:41:30,020
in the Delta but we have found

956
00:41:26,220 --> 00:41:32,700
nodulation and we're doing work on

957
00:41:30,020 --> 00:41:35,579
identifying it and um

958
00:41:32,700 --> 00:41:37,079
looking at salt tolerant rhizobium so

959
00:41:35,579 --> 00:41:39,420
there's there's a space there which is

960
00:41:37,079 --> 00:41:42,720
exciting and and it's great that the

961
00:41:39,420 --> 00:41:44,820
cowpea that we sowed had had nodules

962
00:41:42,720 --> 00:41:48,359
when we when we looked at them which is

963
00:41:44,820 --> 00:41:50,700
which is great A great sign

964
00:41:48,359 --> 00:41:53,280
thanks that's also another question in

965
00:41:50,700 --> 00:41:56,460
the chat and that's also a question I

966
00:41:53,280 --> 00:41:59,460
had regarding the salinity levels in the

967
00:41:56,460 --> 00:42:01,980
different uh sites that you have you

968
00:41:59,460 --> 00:42:04,940
mentioned four provinces so it's it's

969
00:42:01,980 --> 00:42:08,640
probably a it's a gradient because it's

970
00:42:04,940 --> 00:42:10,680
rather Upstream to Coast

971
00:42:08,640 --> 00:42:13,140
um did you

972
00:42:10,680 --> 00:42:16,200
I mean Target the crops to the different

973
00:42:13,140 --> 00:42:19,140
levels and what would what's your how

974
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:21,780
did you do that and what are the levels

975
00:42:19,140 --> 00:42:25,440
that's me answer questions

976
00:42:21,780 --> 00:42:27,180
yep so in stock training they're oh they

977
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:29,700
can get up to so the Vietnamese use

978
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:33,420
grams per liter so

979
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:36,839
um the canal the sluice Gates will shut

980
00:42:33,420 --> 00:42:38,820
at four grams per liter of of the water

981
00:42:36,839 --> 00:42:41,700
irrigation water

982
00:42:38,820 --> 00:42:44,400
so that was the basis that we used in

983
00:42:41,700 --> 00:42:47,220
determining if a crop would be suitable

984
00:42:44,400 --> 00:42:49,920
understanding that soil salinization

985
00:42:47,220 --> 00:42:52,260
over the the you know course of the dry

986
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:54,060
season that can get a lot worse and

987
00:42:52,260 --> 00:42:57,720
solute potentials and things like that

988
00:42:54,060 --> 00:42:59,640
so if if a crop can't handle that

989
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:01,680
um it's sort of out of the equation but

990
00:42:59,640 --> 00:43:05,640
we were finding

991
00:43:01,680 --> 00:43:09,660
um Canal EC up to I think there's been

992
00:43:05,640 --> 00:43:11,940
14 15 deci Siemens recorded

993
00:43:09,660 --> 00:43:13,859
um we've got data that sort of says

994
00:43:11,940 --> 00:43:16,319
eight and nine

995
00:43:13,859 --> 00:43:18,359
um in in those areas of the peak dry

996
00:43:16,319 --> 00:43:21,780
season and then

997
00:43:18,359 --> 00:43:24,240
um that sort of trend follows slower the

998
00:43:21,780 --> 00:43:29,579
lag with the soil yeah and so and so

999
00:43:24,240 --> 00:43:31,740
using mulch and and irrigating we can we

1000
00:43:29,579 --> 00:43:33,119
can minimize the solute potential even

1001
00:43:31,740 --> 00:43:34,800
though there's salt present we can

1002
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:37,319
minimize the effect of the solute

1003
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:39,839
potential so we can still get the plants

1004
00:43:37,319 --> 00:43:41,099
to grow without that mulch there of

1005
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:42,960
course you get the evaporation then

1006
00:43:41,099 --> 00:43:45,060
salts concentrate the solid potential

1007
00:43:42,960 --> 00:43:47,160
will kill the plant

1008
00:43:45,060 --> 00:43:49,800
um but the other thing is our because of

1009
00:43:47,160 --> 00:43:53,160
the nature of the problem uh it's quite

1010
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:55,980
normal to grow these plants when there

1011
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:57,839
is no salinity but the salinity comes as

1012
00:43:55,980 --> 00:43:58,800
they grow so it's the end of their you

1013
00:43:57,839 --> 00:44:00,359
know it's like Brook says the

1014
00:43:58,800 --> 00:44:03,240
reproductive phase if you get the

1015
00:44:00,359 --> 00:44:06,359
solution that's the problem and so the

1016
00:44:03,240 --> 00:44:07,920
the duration of that that crop becomes

1017
00:44:06,359 --> 00:44:09,780
really important because you can with

1018
00:44:07,920 --> 00:44:12,300
the right a short duration you can miss

1019
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,859
the salinity risk you can actually have

1020
00:44:12,300 --> 00:44:16,680
your crop harvested before the salinity

1021
00:44:13,859 --> 00:44:19,140
comes in but where where we've done

1022
00:44:16,680 --> 00:44:22,020
trials in the field you know we've we've

1023
00:44:19,140 --> 00:44:24,480
got even though like book said like they

1024
00:44:22,020 --> 00:44:26,339
you'll shut the sluice gate at four

1025
00:44:24,480 --> 00:44:28,020
Grands per liter

1026
00:44:26,339 --> 00:44:29,940
um with evaporation and then even

1027
00:44:28,020 --> 00:44:31,980
irrigation followed by evaporation

1028
00:44:29,940 --> 00:44:34,260
you'll get higher salinities in the soil

1029
00:44:31,980 --> 00:44:36,720
and and they will harm the sensitive

1030
00:44:34,260 --> 00:44:38,839
crops for sure so that's in provinces

1031
00:44:36,720 --> 00:44:42,180
where there are sluice gate protection

1032
00:44:38,839 --> 00:44:44,339
we've got other provinces where the

1033
00:44:42,180 --> 00:44:46,380
sluice gates are so effective that you

1034
00:44:44,339 --> 00:44:48,720
don't get salinity coming in but you

1035
00:44:46,380 --> 00:44:50,700
you've you've effectively got a trapped

1036
00:44:48,720 --> 00:44:54,420
water source and so water scarcity

1037
00:44:50,700 --> 00:44:56,660
becomes an issue so salinity even though

1038
00:44:54,420 --> 00:44:59,940
our project is was focused on salinity

1039
00:44:56,660 --> 00:45:03,000
is it's actually in some provinces it's

1040
00:44:59,940 --> 00:45:04,980
water scarcity is the problem so there's

1041
00:45:03,000 --> 00:45:06,960
alternative crops are still better than

1042
00:45:04,980 --> 00:45:10,859
rice because it's a different risk

1043
00:45:06,960 --> 00:45:12,839
profile different water use and so it's

1044
00:45:10,859 --> 00:45:14,460
still much more sensible to grow an

1045
00:45:12,839 --> 00:45:16,079
alternative crop than it is to try to go

1046
00:45:14,460 --> 00:45:17,640
rice in the in the dry season when

1047
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:20,160
you've got a limited amount of fresh

1048
00:45:17,640 --> 00:45:21,660
water available to you and and then

1049
00:45:20,160 --> 00:45:25,319
that's why the chameleons are so

1050
00:45:21,660 --> 00:45:27,540
important because you you optimize that

1051
00:45:25,319 --> 00:45:29,339
water use efficiency so you're not

1052
00:45:27,540 --> 00:45:32,819
wasting water and then there's more

1053
00:45:29,339 --> 00:45:36,000
water to to go around within those traps

1054
00:45:32,819 --> 00:45:40,079
enclosed systems yeah maybe you can come

1055
00:45:36,000 --> 00:45:42,359
in here yes sir go ahead yes um as I

1056
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:44,760
also would like to acknowledge this very

1057
00:45:42,359 --> 00:45:47,520
nice presentation Brooke and Jason as

1058
00:45:44,760 --> 00:45:50,160
what I really liked was that you always

1059
00:45:47,520 --> 00:45:52,500
had explanations also you made it an

1060
00:45:50,160 --> 00:45:55,859
overview and you had always examples so

1061
00:45:52,500 --> 00:45:56,579
that was really nice and you also showed

1062
00:45:55,859 --> 00:45:58,980
us

1063
00:45:56,579 --> 00:46:01,160
um your own lessons you learned so I'm

1064
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:04,980
really valuing this in your presentation

1065
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:07,859
and I was quite triggered by one that

1066
00:46:04,980 --> 00:46:10,560
one of you said that it's very important

1067
00:46:07,859 --> 00:46:13,140
the principles of how to implement and

1068
00:46:10,560 --> 00:46:16,140
adopt and then I thought

1069
00:46:13,140 --> 00:46:18,480
um yeah is this something one should go

1070
00:46:16,140 --> 00:46:22,079
further with as it's it's really this

1071
00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:25,079
type of thinking of what is needed why

1072
00:46:22,079 --> 00:46:28,740
we are doing this why not that coming to

1073
00:46:25,079 --> 00:46:31,140
this point of uh yes uh irrigation every

1074
00:46:28,740 --> 00:46:34,619
day that is maybe common practice but

1075
00:46:31,140 --> 00:46:37,859
it's not a best practice and so this uh

1076
00:46:34,619 --> 00:46:40,800
working with with people in this food

1077
00:46:37,859 --> 00:46:42,900
system uh more looking into the

1078
00:46:40,800 --> 00:46:45,119
principles of how doing things so how

1079
00:46:42,900 --> 00:46:49,380
thinking it's through so not coming up

1080
00:46:45,119 --> 00:46:52,859
to solution saying okay now use beetroot

1081
00:46:49,380 --> 00:46:57,060
and then uh so many days before or after

1082
00:46:52,859 --> 00:46:58,800
that but uh yeah more go into this way

1083
00:46:57,060 --> 00:47:02,099
of doing things

1084
00:46:58,800 --> 00:47:03,359
yeah thank you yeah and it's interesting

1085
00:47:02,099 --> 00:47:05,160
like and and

1086
00:47:03,359 --> 00:47:07,440
um limit I've only really worked in

1087
00:47:05,160 --> 00:47:10,740
Vietnam uh as my International

1088
00:47:07,440 --> 00:47:12,720
experience but the farmers there

1089
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:15,540
they'll see something work and just pick

1090
00:47:12,720 --> 00:47:17,400
up and go with it and so uh the

1091
00:47:15,540 --> 00:47:20,040
willingness you know you go from

1092
00:47:17,400 --> 00:47:22,079
literally going from hey

1093
00:47:20,040 --> 00:47:23,880
um let's consider growing alternative

1094
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:27,119
crop instead of rice because rice is

1095
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:29,280
risky and then they see it and now let's

1096
00:47:27,119 --> 00:47:31,560
grow two alternative crops and it's like

1097
00:47:29,280 --> 00:47:33,540
whoa just calm down like maybe we just

1098
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:35,700
get one right first but they they're

1099
00:47:33,540 --> 00:47:37,319
wanting to keep going faster and faster

1100
00:47:35,700 --> 00:47:40,079
and so

1101
00:47:37,319 --> 00:47:41,520
um you know being there to be able to

1102
00:47:40,079 --> 00:47:44,240
support that interest and that

1103
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:46,920
enthusiasm but also protect people from

1104
00:47:44,240 --> 00:47:49,079
perhaps the risks that come with with

1105
00:47:46,920 --> 00:47:51,480
changing so rapidly

1106
00:47:49,079 --> 00:47:52,619
um but so there's a balance there with

1107
00:47:51,480 --> 00:47:54,420
dealing with the individual the

1108
00:47:52,619 --> 00:47:56,819
individuals right I think that's the key

1109
00:47:54,420 --> 00:48:00,420
to it like you you've got to tap into

1110
00:47:56,819 --> 00:48:02,579
that enthusiasm and and uh they're

1111
00:48:00,420 --> 00:48:05,280
they're uh it might be their age and

1112
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:07,319
stage and and who's there to farm with

1113
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:09,839
them or what their goals are

1114
00:48:07,319 --> 00:48:12,420
um become become really important and we

1115
00:48:09,839 --> 00:48:13,800
you talk about learning we've spoken

1116
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:16,140
about a little bit there's so much

1117
00:48:13,800 --> 00:48:18,960
learning involved in it but

1118
00:48:16,140 --> 00:48:21,180
um of course but uh when we when we see

1119
00:48:18,960 --> 00:48:22,859
the farmers with we're around our field

1120
00:48:21,180 --> 00:48:24,359
trial and then neighbors then want to

1121
00:48:22,859 --> 00:48:25,440
get involved and they start expanding

1122
00:48:24,359 --> 00:48:28,500
out

1123
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:30,839
um then you start we have the it's it's

1124
00:48:28,500 --> 00:48:32,460
uh because if they're not going to grow

1125
00:48:30,839 --> 00:48:35,520
that alternative crop and they want to

1126
00:48:32,460 --> 00:48:38,579
grow rice well now we've got a hydrology

1127
00:48:35,520 --> 00:48:40,079
conflict you know because some people

1128
00:48:38,579 --> 00:48:41,880
want to have flooded Fields next to

1129
00:48:40,079 --> 00:48:44,400
something that needs to be drained and

1130
00:48:41,880 --> 00:48:47,720
so those issues become become important

1131
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:47,720
yeah yeah and maybe

1132
00:48:48,660 --> 00:48:55,680
but you need the rice as a mark So and

1133
00:48:52,859 --> 00:48:57,960
and if you use the rice as a milk what

1134
00:48:55,680 --> 00:49:00,300
are you are not doing with rice that you

1135
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:03,480
may have done before so then there are

1136
00:49:00,300 --> 00:49:05,579
always uh yeah a lot of things to uh to

1137
00:49:03,480 --> 00:49:07,619
be looked into whether it was one that

1138
00:49:05,579 --> 00:49:09,720
is very good you are causing something

1139
00:49:07,619 --> 00:49:11,880
else where maybe something is missing at

1140
00:49:09,720 --> 00:49:14,940
the end so that this is really this uh

1141
00:49:11,880 --> 00:49:18,260
discussions about trade-offs what what

1142
00:49:14,940 --> 00:49:21,839
we are using in an in what way yeah yeah

1143
00:49:18,260 --> 00:49:24,480
in one of the projects we've

1144
00:49:21,839 --> 00:49:26,579
quite interestingly com so I had a

1145
00:49:24,480 --> 00:49:28,740
profitability analysis combined with the

1146
00:49:26,579 --> 00:49:31,680
risk analysis and then you can also see

1147
00:49:28,740 --> 00:49:33,720
okay some some cropping systems may have

1148
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:35,940
higher profit but also have a higher

1149
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:38,760
risk and that's that's I mean important

1150
00:49:35,940 --> 00:49:41,220
to to balance

1151
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:44,400
um we are running out of time I would

1152
00:49:41,220 --> 00:49:46,740
like to still ask you uh what's your

1153
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,660
what are your next steps what's what's

1154
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:50,819
coming next are you going for a second

1155
00:49:48,660 --> 00:49:53,420
phase how long is the project running

1156
00:49:50,819 --> 00:49:56,940
what's your do you have a scaling

1157
00:49:53,420 --> 00:50:01,380
strategy what is next in your vision yes

1158
00:49:56,940 --> 00:50:04,920
so we're we're roughly halfway through

1159
00:50:01,380 --> 00:50:06,960
um and like we we started in the covert

1160
00:50:04,920 --> 00:50:08,160
period so it was a pretty rough start

1161
00:50:06,960 --> 00:50:11,400
but

1162
00:50:08,160 --> 00:50:13,560
um luckily the team at Quinto uni

1163
00:50:11,400 --> 00:50:15,900
um did a lot of work

1164
00:50:13,560 --> 00:50:17,280
um good work that got the project loaded

1165
00:50:15,900 --> 00:50:18,660
off in the right direction earlier so

1166
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:21,240
that was good we're about halfway

1167
00:50:18,660 --> 00:50:23,640
through and so what we what we are

1168
00:50:21,240 --> 00:50:25,560
looking at doing now is is our struggle

1169
00:50:23,640 --> 00:50:27,900
like Brook said in her presentation that

1170
00:50:25,560 --> 00:50:30,480
that fitting timing into a cropping

1171
00:50:27,900 --> 00:50:33,060
calendar is very crucial and so we want

1172
00:50:30,480 --> 00:50:34,440
to do more work around timing timing of

1173
00:50:33,060 --> 00:50:37,260
sewing and timing of these Land

1174
00:50:34,440 --> 00:50:40,319
Management practices and preparation uh

1175
00:50:37,260 --> 00:50:44,040
and and I think we need to probably

1176
00:50:40,319 --> 00:50:45,900
start factoring in some like modeling

1177
00:50:44,040 --> 00:50:48,059
um you know climatic conditions into

1178
00:50:45,900 --> 00:50:49,680
that and and factoring that into the

1179
00:50:48,059 --> 00:50:52,260
outcomes and sort of using our field

1180
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:55,380
trials to validate those models

1181
00:50:52,260 --> 00:50:57,900
um so we need to do that we need to at

1182
00:50:55,380 --> 00:51:00,720
the moment all of our fertility is based

1183
00:50:57,900 --> 00:51:02,400
on what is common practice in the area

1184
00:51:00,720 --> 00:51:04,559
which is largely coming off what people

1185
00:51:02,400 --> 00:51:06,180
do if they grow Maize

1186
00:51:04,559 --> 00:51:09,300
um and so there's a fair bit of

1187
00:51:06,180 --> 00:51:11,220
optimization to be had in that space

1188
00:51:09,300 --> 00:51:14,059
um but yes moving forward so this

1189
00:51:11,220 --> 00:51:18,000
project ends in mid 2025

1190
00:51:14,059 --> 00:51:19,200
and so we are looking at developing a

1191
00:51:18,000 --> 00:51:22,559
new project

1192
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:24,780
that still looks at using alternative

1193
00:51:22,559 --> 00:51:26,880
crops developing further on what we've

1194
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:29,579
been doing like Brooks says focusing on

1195
00:51:26,880 --> 00:51:31,500
legumes a little bit more and of course

1196
00:51:29,579 --> 00:51:33,420
um Vietnam like every other country in

1197
00:51:31,500 --> 00:51:35,940
the world you know

1198
00:51:33,420 --> 00:51:39,420
um soil carbon greenhouse gas emissions

1199
00:51:35,940 --> 00:51:41,160
have to be factored into that and so so

1200
00:51:39,420 --> 00:51:43,319
um looking at the benefits that our

1201
00:51:41,160 --> 00:51:45,119
improved systems with these alternative

1202
00:51:43,319 --> 00:51:47,040
crops that deliver benefits to the

1203
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:49,619
farmers but also benefits for the system

1204
00:51:47,040 --> 00:51:52,260
and quantifying some of those as well so

1205
00:51:49,619 --> 00:51:54,359
that that can be used so it's Quantified

1206
00:51:52,260 --> 00:51:55,800
it's known that if Farmers change to

1207
00:51:54,359 --> 00:51:57,300
this practice then these are the

1208
00:51:55,800 --> 00:51:59,280
benefits

1209
00:51:57,300 --> 00:52:00,599
um that come from its social as well as

1210
00:51:59,280 --> 00:52:03,540
you know

1211
00:52:00,599 --> 00:52:06,359
physical yeah

1212
00:52:03,540 --> 00:52:11,460
very interesting thank you I'm I'm sure

1213
00:52:06,359 --> 00:52:14,220
uh you'll get that uh work funded

1214
00:52:11,460 --> 00:52:16,619
um I also hope that we keep on uh

1215
00:52:14,220 --> 00:52:20,220
engaging and maybe even uh try and

1216
00:52:16,619 --> 00:52:23,040
formalize a collaboration uh in more

1217
00:52:20,220 --> 00:52:26,220
detail uh in the future

1218
00:52:23,040 --> 00:52:29,520
um for now thank you very much for the

1219
00:52:26,220 --> 00:52:32,640
presentation it was very enjoyable and

1220
00:52:29,520 --> 00:52:34,940
the next Delta talks I'm not exactly

1221
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:39,059
sure if we have a date already

1222
00:52:34,940 --> 00:52:41,220
uh we have in about four weeks the

1223
00:52:39,059 --> 00:52:43,619
international rights Congress coming up

1224
00:52:41,220 --> 00:52:46,260
and the whole world of course is very

1225
00:52:43,619 --> 00:52:48,540
busy with that and focuses on that so

1226
00:52:46,260 --> 00:52:50,160
I'm not sure if that is maybe in the way

1227
00:52:48,540 --> 00:52:55,020
and we need to find an alternative date

1228
00:52:50,160 --> 00:52:58,500
we will announce that ASAP

1229
00:52:55,020 --> 00:52:59,760
so thank you everybody for participating

1230
00:52:58,500 --> 00:53:01,680
uh

1231
00:52:59,760 --> 00:53:02,880
