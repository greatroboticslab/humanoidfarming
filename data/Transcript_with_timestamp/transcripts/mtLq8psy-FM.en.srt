[Music]

2
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,320
it's not possible to have a good yields

3
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:23,220
of soft shop without pollination

4
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:26,100
a hand pollination no preparing to get

5
00:00:23,220 --> 00:00:31,859
the collected the pollen grain

6
00:00:26,100 --> 00:00:34,559
or one flower and the male stage

7
00:00:31,859 --> 00:00:39,000
in the main stage we can see that we are

8
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:42,180
getting some answers and this enters it

9
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:45,719
is impregnated with the pollen grain

10
00:00:42,180 --> 00:00:48,420
this yellowish color that you can see we

11
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:51,539
can go through this flower

12
00:00:48,420 --> 00:00:53,940
into this flower we can observe that it

13
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:57,840
is it is the female stage

14
00:00:53,940 --> 00:01:00,000
so in this female stage I need

15
00:00:57,840 --> 00:01:03,379
to transfer

16
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:06,840
the pollen grain from this

17
00:01:03,379 --> 00:01:11,040
from this brush to the flower for

18
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:15,060
example I pouch it in the recipients it

19
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:19,080
will be full of pollen grain and I or

20
00:01:15,060 --> 00:01:23,400
your transfer this pollen grain to

21
00:01:19,080 --> 00:01:26,000
the flower with one hand I tried to open

22
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:26,000
the flower

23
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,400
to expose

24
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:35,280
the female part

25
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:38,640
the female part of the flower

26
00:01:35,280 --> 00:01:43,860
and after that I put

27
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:47,479
my brush with pollen grain in contact

28
00:01:43,860 --> 00:01:52,399
with the female part the stigma I do it

29
00:01:47,479 --> 00:01:56,479
Crossing and that's all it is pollinated

30
00:01:52,399 --> 00:02:00,720
this flower will continue

31
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:04,520
developing but developing only inside

32
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:09,780
these flowers or they were pollinated

33
00:02:04,520 --> 00:02:12,120
maybe some five something days ago and

34
00:02:09,780 --> 00:02:16,319
they continue in this with this

35
00:02:12,120 --> 00:02:19,440
formation with this appearance for 60

36
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:22,800
days for about two months

37
00:02:19,440 --> 00:02:24,360
and after that fruits will begin

38
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,080
developing

39
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,879
and with the development of the fruits

40
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:34,800
we can say that we have to protect these

41
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:37,800
fruits

42
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:37,800
foreign

43
00:02:37,820 --> 00:02:43,719
[Music]

44
00:02:45,060 --> 00:02:49,800
this fruit

45
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:53,340
just after 60 days of the pollination

46
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:56,760
the fruits begin to develop we can see

47
00:02:53,340 --> 00:02:59,819
the spine that they appear to develop

48
00:02:56,760 --> 00:03:01,980
to separate one from another and this is

49
00:02:59,819 --> 00:03:05,400
the moment of protecting these fruits

50
00:03:01,980 --> 00:03:09,019
because now it's fruits and from this

51
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:12,659
time it is possible to have infection

52
00:03:09,019 --> 00:03:17,340
with the city border the number one

53
00:03:12,659 --> 00:03:21,360
insect in the world to Source up so from

54
00:03:17,340 --> 00:03:22,099
this phase to when through it it be the

55
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:24,720
size

56
00:03:22,099 --> 00:03:27,780
the the

57
00:03:24,720 --> 00:03:30,599
the silver can attack so we have to

58
00:03:27,780 --> 00:03:34,019
protect at this phase because if you

59
00:03:30,599 --> 00:03:37,860
protect when fruit is large one it will

60
00:03:34,019 --> 00:03:41,400
not work it will not avoid the the

61
00:03:37,860 --> 00:03:44,180
problem so I put the fruits one or two

62
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:44,180
fruits together

63
00:03:44,220 --> 00:03:51,360
I protect it with

64
00:03:48,319 --> 00:03:54,379
this this protection

65
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:54,379
with this bag

66
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:07,739
this protection should be kept

67
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:11,099
at least during two more months

68
00:04:07,739 --> 00:04:14,700
now it is protected in this case means

69
00:04:11,099 --> 00:04:19,560
that the past the silver has no capacity

70
00:04:14,700 --> 00:04:22,079
of getting into this uh this uh this

71
00:04:19,560 --> 00:04:26,699
environment because they are protected

72
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:30,360
with this net with this this material so

73
00:04:26,699 --> 00:04:33,600
I will keep this fruit here during two

74
00:04:30,360 --> 00:04:36,840
modern months at least and after that I

75
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:40,320
take out this protection and the food

76
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:43,259
continue developing and naturally the

77
00:04:40,320 --> 00:04:47,160
the insect is not capable anymore to

78
00:04:43,259 --> 00:04:51,180
produce any kind of damage the seeds is

79
00:04:47,160 --> 00:04:52,910
not do not permit the of a position of

80
00:04:51,180 --> 00:04:58,880
the female insect

81
00:04:52,910 --> 00:05:01,500
[Music]

82
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:05,759
now let's talk something about pruning

83
00:05:01,500 --> 00:05:09,360
pruning is very important in search of

84
00:05:05,759 --> 00:05:12,120
production is a a practice that you have

85
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:14,040
practice that you have to adopt if you

86
00:05:12,120 --> 00:05:16,860
want to get good results if if you

87
00:05:14,040 --> 00:05:19,860
wanted to get a better control of

88
00:05:16,860 --> 00:05:22,139
diseases and also to help you to

89
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:25,560
pollinate to protect the fluids with

90
00:05:22,139 --> 00:05:29,100
pecking and also if you during the

91
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:31,680
moment of spraying against some insects

92
00:05:29,100 --> 00:05:36,660
some diseases and also during the time

93
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:40,139
of of harvesting so the pruning is very

94
00:05:36,660 --> 00:05:43,740
important you have to open the center of

95
00:05:40,139 --> 00:05:47,100
the search up tree in order to get some

96
00:05:43,740 --> 00:05:51,539
sunlight inside every day and also to

97
00:05:47,100 --> 00:05:53,699
permit the circulation of air so

98
00:05:51,539 --> 00:05:56,820
aeration should be here either you

99
00:05:53,699 --> 00:06:01,020
reduce the problems of diseases and also

100
00:05:56,820 --> 00:06:04,259
will help us to make other practice for

101
00:06:01,020 --> 00:06:07,139
example in this case it was pruned here

102
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:09,419
this Branch was spoons this also

103
00:06:07,139 --> 00:06:13,560
disorder that this Center was also

104
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:17,280
pruned here we have other branches that

105
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:20,960
was also pruned because it was growing

106
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:24,240
in this direction I need to keep it open

107
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:27,660
and after pruning we can do it with a

108
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:30,780
saw we can do it with a Shear in this

109
00:06:27,660 --> 00:06:33,180
case of new suits that usually appear

110
00:06:30,780 --> 00:06:37,639
after pruning we have also to eliminate

111
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:40,759
it we have to eliminate it in order to

112
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:42,660
in order to avoid

113
00:06:40,759 --> 00:06:46,020
heavy

114
00:06:42,660 --> 00:06:49,800
closing again the central part of the

115
00:06:46,020 --> 00:06:51,620
canopy so we can do it

116
00:06:49,800 --> 00:06:55,080
every every

117
00:06:51,620 --> 00:06:57,600
branch that suit that is growing we have

118
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:59,759
to eliminate it

119
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:05,100
when you do it once twice or three times

120
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:08,180
after that we can see that it you do not

121
00:07:05,100 --> 00:07:11,699
it will not

122
00:07:08,180 --> 00:07:14,340
appear no new suits again because you

123
00:07:11,699 --> 00:07:17,759
you're reducing its Force its strongness

124
00:07:14,340 --> 00:07:19,500
over this material so this is what we

125
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,120
have to do

126
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:25,860
another thing that we have to understand

127
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:27,360
that every time that this plant is

128
00:07:25,860 --> 00:07:30,240
growing

129
00:07:27,360 --> 00:07:32,580
in the height for example more than

130
00:07:30,240 --> 00:07:38,220
three meters in height

131
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:41,759
or more than a 10 feet in height I have

132
00:07:38,220 --> 00:07:46,620
to put like this plant here for example

133
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:48,960
when this Branch it is very high I

134
00:07:46,620 --> 00:07:50,639
should cut it

135
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,500
I should cut it

136
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:56,460
I should

137
00:07:52,500 --> 00:08:00,479
cut it to avoid growing and closing

138
00:07:56,460 --> 00:08:05,340
again with one tree like this in at this

139
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:07,800
this height I can make all the practices

140
00:08:05,340 --> 00:08:10,940
that this plant will need

141
00:08:07,800 --> 00:08:16,560
like pollination

142
00:08:10,940 --> 00:08:19,560
sprays packing harvesting and so on so I

143
00:08:16,560 --> 00:08:22,860
have to maintain this source of tree

144
00:08:19,560 --> 00:08:25,379
with pruning continuously

145
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:29,879
because it's the way that we can

146
00:08:25,379 --> 00:08:33,560
increase yield and we can have fruits of

147
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:33,560
God of good quality

148
00:08:34,099 --> 00:08:37,099
foreign

149
00:08:45,500 --> 00:08:52,260
we have to take a look on the spines and

150
00:08:49,019 --> 00:08:56,640
the color of the skin to see if it is

151
00:08:52,260 --> 00:08:59,459
ready to to be harvested in this case

152
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:03,000
for example we take a look on the skin

153
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:06,300
you can see some change in the color of

154
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,180
the skin and especially when you do that

155
00:09:06,300 --> 00:09:12,420
when you cut

156
00:09:08,180 --> 00:09:15,420
you take this spine and you force it you

157
00:09:12,420 --> 00:09:18,660
see that you broke easily it becomes

158
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:21,899
soft at this stage and also the

159
00:09:18,660 --> 00:09:27,660
operation of harvesting should be done

160
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:31,500
with a shear and you have to be a good

161
00:09:27,660 --> 00:09:34,740
care so you have to put your Shear near

162
00:09:31,500 --> 00:09:38,580
the the pedal nearly stock near the

163
00:09:34,740 --> 00:09:39,540
fridge near the fruit and Cuts Like This

164
00:09:38,580 --> 00:09:43,860
Way

165
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:46,800
you can cut it this way and the stock

166
00:09:43,860 --> 00:09:49,620
should remain on the branch because it's

167
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:53,160
important because in this Zone in this

168
00:09:49,620 --> 00:09:56,100
site it will continuous producing new

169
00:09:53,160 --> 00:09:59,640
flowers it's very important to get in

170
00:09:56,100 --> 00:10:03,300
One Tree like search up to get the site

171
00:09:59,640 --> 00:10:06,839
like this one where we can install a

172
00:10:03,300 --> 00:10:10,440
flower Bud like this one it means that

173
00:10:06,839 --> 00:10:13,019
we have produced or harvested one foot

174
00:10:10,440 --> 00:10:15,120
in this site at this region you can see

175
00:10:13,019 --> 00:10:18,959
this car we have a fruit that we

176
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:22,740
harvested some months ago it means if it

177
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:27,120
is well harvested we can get at this

178
00:10:22,740 --> 00:10:30,000
site a lot of new flowers flowers button

179
00:10:27,120 --> 00:10:33,779
it is very important because it means

180
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:35,700
that in this during many many years we

181
00:10:33,779 --> 00:10:39,380
can produce flowers and fruit every

182
00:10:35,700 --> 00:10:42,720
sites and we have to prune to stimulated

183
00:10:39,380 --> 00:10:45,839
new sites like these new buds like this

184
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:48,120
one in this position in this position in

185
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:51,180
this position like this one in this

186
00:10:48,120 --> 00:10:54,180
position like here it will help us to

187
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:57,420
increase more and more fruits flowers

188
00:10:54,180 --> 00:11:00,600
and fruits the following years it will

189
00:10:57,420 --> 00:11:01,380
help us in increasing yield and fruits

190
00:11:00,600 --> 00:11:05,120

192
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:10,440
traditionally people use both organic

193
00:11:08,040 --> 00:11:13,200
matter and also fertilize chemical

194
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,620
fertilizers you can use both okay but if

195
00:11:13,200 --> 00:11:18,899
you say no I don't want to apply

196
00:11:15,620 --> 00:11:20,519
chemical material no problem but you

197
00:11:18,899 --> 00:11:22,140
have to apply a lot of organic matter

198
00:11:20,519 --> 00:11:25,440
it's very important to apply because

199
00:11:22,140 --> 00:11:29,519
there is good response for social trip

200
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:33,560
to what we apply organic matter and also

201
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:38,899
you have to consider that when do you

202
00:11:33,560 --> 00:11:42,600
prune when you prune one three of salsa

203
00:11:38,899 --> 00:11:46,079
you are we estimate that you are you are

204
00:11:42,600 --> 00:11:48,060
putting four to eight tons per acre of

205
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:50,060
leaves and branches you can see after

206
00:11:48,060 --> 00:11:53,880
two or three years that the root system

207
00:11:50,060 --> 00:11:57,959
goes through this material

208
00:11:53,880 --> 00:12:00,180
superficially with very nice results

209
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:02,399
and also when you have opportunity you

210
00:12:00,180 --> 00:12:05,519
can use your warm compost to be bio

211
00:12:02,399 --> 00:12:07,860
fertilizer and so on in this case for

212
00:12:05,519 --> 00:12:09,540
example you can see related to to

213
00:12:07,860 --> 00:12:12,000
nutrient cycling

214
00:12:09,540 --> 00:12:15,300
Observer for example in this

215
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:17,459
the source of tree it was pruned all the

216
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:20,760
leaves and branches should be put

217
00:12:17,459 --> 00:12:24,300
together Under The Canopy under the

218
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:25,860
shade of the canopy but you should not

219
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:31,260
put fruits

220
00:12:25,860 --> 00:12:34,980
please never put fruits small one bigger

221
00:12:31,260 --> 00:12:36,899
one natural fruits never put fluids in

222
00:12:34,980 --> 00:12:40,200
this situation on leaves and breakfasts

223
00:12:36,899 --> 00:12:43,320
never fruits why because fruits usually

224
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:45,260
develops and track noses call It pottery

225
00:12:43,320 --> 00:12:48,600
code

226
00:12:45,260 --> 00:12:51,010
is the most important disease that we

227
00:12:48,600 --> 00:12:55,990
have in salsa

228
00:12:51,010 --> 00:12:55,990
