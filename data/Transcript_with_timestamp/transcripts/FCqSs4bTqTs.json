  "text": "today i'm going to demonstrate a simple way to patch a lay flat head apart when a leak occurs the first thing you should do is identify exactly where the leak is in the late flat header pipe if you identify a hole in the lay flat you will make a cut directly over that leak point you will cut it completely in half so you are working with even edges we are going to use a coupling or bob splice fitting to join the two parts back together take two clamps and insert them on both sides of pipe they can go on either way but we are putting them on so that we can easily reach to tighten the clamps insert the bar splice fitting into one side and then the other push both sides of the leg flat together over the fitting a little vaseline or vegetable oil will help the lay flat slide on the feeding move the pipe clamps just past the barbs and tighten them with the screwdriver now the leak is fixed turn the water on and make sure it worked we hope this video was very useful please check out our video series to learn all the steps in installing a simple irrigation system on a small phone thank you you",
