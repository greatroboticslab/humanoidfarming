[Music]

2
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:16,740
what are you guys doing here

3
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:18,060
what am I doing here well I came out to

4
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:21,029
just practice hooking up the three-point

5
00:00:18,060 --> 00:00:24,529
attachments that's not crazy you guys

6
00:00:21,029 --> 00:00:26,279
don't do that in your spare time huh

7
00:00:24,529 --> 00:00:28,800
well since you're here you want me to

8
00:00:26,279 --> 00:00:32,700
show you some tips all right let's get

9
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,559
into it all right I apologize I think

10
00:00:32,700 --> 00:00:36,660
quarantine has me going a little crazy

11
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:38,640
but I do want to show you some tips on

12
00:00:36,660 --> 00:00:40,500
how to hook up attachments to your

13
00:00:38,640 --> 00:00:42,149
three-point hitch and maybe we'll get

14
00:00:40,500 --> 00:00:44,789
one or two in there on the PTO as well

15
00:00:42,149 --> 00:00:47,309
but should be a good overview and as I

16
00:00:44,789 --> 00:00:49,170
usually do I learn some things simply by

17
00:00:47,309 --> 00:00:51,539
looking in the manual a little bit

18
00:00:49,170 --> 00:00:52,980
harder than I normally do so you know

19
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,140
let's go ahead and go through this will

20
00:00:52,980 --> 00:00:56,910
give you a good lay of the land here on

21
00:00:55,140 --> 00:00:59,520
how to have everything set up properly

22
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:01,469
at least my interpretation of it you

23
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:03,090
know your mileage may vary as they say

24
00:01:01,469 --> 00:01:04,559
but I want to give you some advice here

25
00:01:03,090 --> 00:01:06,750
because it could make your life a lot

26
00:01:04,559 --> 00:01:08,580
easier I absolutely used to hate hooking

27
00:01:06,750 --> 00:01:10,470
up the three-point attachments but it's

28
00:01:08,580 --> 00:01:11,760
pretty much a piece of cake anymore so

29
00:01:10,470 --> 00:01:13,200
I've got several tractors here and

30
00:01:11,760 --> 00:01:14,909
that's intentional you know I want to

31
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:16,110
give you some different setups here some

32
00:01:14,909 --> 00:01:17,580
different versions that you can see

33
00:01:16,110 --> 00:01:19,259
because all the tractors are different

34
00:01:17,580 --> 00:01:20,670
out there and this doesn't clearly

35
00:01:19,259 --> 00:01:22,259
represent everything that's gonna be on

36
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:24,750
the market but it gives you a good idea

37
00:01:22,259 --> 00:01:26,759
and a good basic understanding so we do

38
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:28,470
have a forty sixty six R right here

39
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:30,780
gonna have a thirty thirty nine are

40
00:01:28,470 --> 00:01:32,670
right here and then a twenty thirty two

41
00:01:30,780 --> 00:01:34,680
R as well over there and you can't see

42
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:36,930
it in this footprint right here but I do

43
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:39,270
have my 10 25 R as well we might get

44
00:01:36,930 --> 00:01:41,040
that into the mix also I've talked about

45
00:01:39,270 --> 00:01:42,600
this rate of drop or speed of drop

46
00:01:41,040 --> 00:01:44,549
control before which is essentially

47
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:46,530
opening and closing a valve that's gonna

48
00:01:44,549 --> 00:01:48,329
be tied into your three-point hitch or

49
00:01:46,530 --> 00:01:51,450
your rock shaft control system and

50
00:01:48,329 --> 00:01:53,520
looking in the manual surprisingly it's

51
00:01:51,450 --> 00:01:55,259
underneath the section of attaching and

52
00:01:53,520 --> 00:01:56,240
detaching your three-point-four asian

53
00:01:55,259 --> 00:01:58,290
all that kind of thing

54
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,850
surprisingly it says you want to set

55
00:01:58,290 --> 00:02:02,009
this so that it takes two seconds to

56
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:04,680
lower to the ground otherwise you could

57
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:06,689
you know potentially damage or injure or

58
00:02:04,680 --> 00:02:08,970
whatever else you know so good note

59
00:02:06,689 --> 00:02:10,229
there to in or two seconds to get all

60
00:02:08,970 --> 00:02:12,270
the way down to the ground from a fully

61
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,890
raised position that means it's gonna

62
00:02:12,270 --> 00:02:16,020
have to be almost completely closed

63
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:18,030
maybe just a hair backed off from that

64
00:02:16,020 --> 00:02:19,740
but I'll show you what I mean so I've

65
00:02:18,030 --> 00:02:22,500
got this valve completely closed right

66
00:02:19,740 --> 00:02:24,330
now I'm gonna pack it off just a little

67
00:02:22,500 --> 00:02:26,569
bit and we'll see how long it takes to

68
00:02:24,330 --> 00:02:26,569
lower

69
00:02:28,930 --> 00:02:33,659
what was that like three seconds three

70
00:02:31,030 --> 00:02:33,659
and a half seconds

71
00:02:34,630 --> 00:02:37,860
open it a little more

72
00:02:39,349 --> 00:02:42,859
that's about two seconds right there

73
00:02:40,930 --> 00:02:44,900
okay so while we're out here looking at

74
00:02:42,859 --> 00:02:46,639
the 1025 R I want to take a quick second

75
00:02:44,900 --> 00:02:49,010
show you how to make attaching to this

76
00:02:46,639 --> 00:02:50,269
PTO shaft that much easier so if you

77
00:02:49,010 --> 00:02:53,030
have a machine that's equipped with both

78
00:02:50,269 --> 00:02:56,150
a mid and a rear pto what I want you to

79
00:02:53,030 --> 00:02:58,069
do is go ahead and take your PTO lover

80
00:02:56,150 --> 00:03:00,439
here okay this is your PTO select lever

81
00:02:58,069 --> 00:03:02,359
it's going to control which PTO you're

82
00:03:00,439 --> 00:03:04,280
operating whether it's the rear the mid

83
00:03:02,359 --> 00:03:07,819
or both at the same time so I've gone

84
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:10,400
ahead and moved my PTO select shaft to

85
00:03:07,819 --> 00:03:12,139
the rear PTO alright and so that means

86
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,510
that if I had this machine on and pulled

87
00:03:12,139 --> 00:03:16,519
out the the knob for the PTO or flipped

88
00:03:14,510 --> 00:03:18,169
a button that the rear PTO would be

89
00:03:16,519 --> 00:03:20,540
spinning and engaged okay say I had a

90
00:03:18,169 --> 00:03:22,909
tiller or a brush hog attached so if I

91
00:03:20,540 --> 00:03:25,370
come back here and try to spin this PTO

92
00:03:22,909 --> 00:03:27,409
shaft it's not gonna spin you can hear

93
00:03:25,370 --> 00:03:29,689
it kind of rattling as it's locked in

94
00:03:27,409 --> 00:03:32,599
place there so now if I move this PTO

95
00:03:29,689 --> 00:03:35,599
lever to the mid PTO position okay so

96
00:03:32,599 --> 00:03:37,400
only the mid PTO was running and it

97
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:39,019
would not be the rear PTO if I had the

98
00:03:37,400 --> 00:03:42,590
machine on let's go ahead and see what

99
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:45,470
happens see how it freely spins so if I

100
00:03:42,590 --> 00:03:47,989
move this back to the to the rear there

101
00:03:45,470 --> 00:03:49,609
we go it's gonna be locked in place if I

102
00:03:47,989 --> 00:03:51,829
move it back to the mid it's gonna

103
00:03:49,609 --> 00:03:54,319
freely move and that will help you align

104
00:03:51,829 --> 00:03:56,389
your splines that are on your PTO shaft

105
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:59,019
with the splines that are on here on the

106
00:03:56,389 --> 00:04:01,099
output shaft on the tractor

107
00:03:59,019 --> 00:04:03,530
hey and as we go through this video

108
00:04:01,099 --> 00:04:05,060
today keep your eyes on these quick

109
00:04:03,530 --> 00:04:06,500
itches here because I'll get to it later

110
00:04:05,060 --> 00:04:08,689
in the video but if you think that this

111
00:04:06,500 --> 00:04:10,040
sounds like a major chore attach and

112
00:04:08,689 --> 00:04:12,259
detach them from the three-point hitch

113
00:04:10,040 --> 00:04:14,509
then you might find that a quick hitch

114
00:04:12,259 --> 00:04:16,039
is what you need and if you haven't done

115
00:04:14,509 --> 00:04:17,930

subscribe make sure you read the

118
00:04:19,310 --> 00:04:22,490

information down there as well and go to

120
00:04:22,490 --> 00:04:25,610
good works tractors com2 would love to

121
00:04:24,500 --> 00:04:28,130
help you with a tractor or an attachment

122
00:04:25,610 --> 00:04:29,360
delivery and financing as well you know

123
00:04:28,130 --> 00:04:30,979
to set your tractor up right on your

124
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,300
three-point hitch it's actually a little

125
00:04:30,979 --> 00:04:34,490
bit more involved than you might think

126
00:04:32,300 --> 00:04:37,580
and if you've ever wondered why there's

127
00:04:34,490 --> 00:04:39,680
three positions up here well so today so

128
00:04:37,580 --> 00:04:41,539
finally what do you know I looked into

129
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:43,580
it a little bit further and these three

130
00:04:41,539 --> 00:04:45,199
different positions totally mean

131
00:04:43,580 --> 00:04:47,690
something okay there's a reason for

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,159
those so let's go through it so before

133
00:04:47,690 --> 00:04:51,080
we actually hook up to the three-point

134
00:04:49,159 --> 00:04:52,980
hitch it's important to know which pin

135
00:04:51,080 --> 00:04:54,890
position you should put your top leg

136
00:04:52,980 --> 00:04:57,360
okay you're sent a link right here and

137
00:04:54,890 --> 00:04:59,310
this all mean something different these

138
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:00,990
three different locations now not every

139
00:04:59,310 --> 00:05:02,880
tractor has three locations but for

140
00:05:00,990 --> 00:05:04,500
those that do there's a reason for it I

141
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,140
have to break off the manual to show you

142
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:10,560
let's take a quick peek okay this is a

143
00:05:07,140 --> 00:05:13,080
John Deere 2032 our 2038 manual we are

144
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:14,940
opening to our positioning center leaks

145
00:05:13,080 --> 00:05:16,410
links section right here and you're

146
00:05:14,940 --> 00:05:18,780
gonna see for light and medium loads

147
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:21,920
install Center link and the bottom hole

148
00:05:18,780 --> 00:05:25,110
B okay down here medium and heavy loads

149
00:05:21,920 --> 00:05:28,230
see ok the middle one for very heavy

150
00:05:25,110 --> 00:05:30,420
draught loads D the top one okay also

151
00:05:28,230 --> 00:05:33,300
notice you're gonna see a category one

152
00:05:30,420 --> 00:05:35,870
implement hey there mister fly tilts

153
00:05:33,300 --> 00:05:37,770
forward while raising in this position

154
00:05:35,870 --> 00:05:40,080
category I wanna implement tilts forward

155
00:05:37,770 --> 00:05:42,330
varies slightly while raised in this

156
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,030
position and category one raises but

157
00:05:42,330 --> 00:05:46,350
angle remains constant okay so important

158
00:05:45,030 --> 00:05:48,180
note there depending on the tool that

159
00:05:46,350 --> 00:05:50,460
you're using I can't believe that fly is

160
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:52,320
just doing what he wants I get

161
00:05:50,460 --> 00:05:53,310
distracted too easy anyway pay attention

162
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:55,830
to that because that can mean something

163
00:05:53,310 --> 00:05:57,270
could mean a difference to the implement

164
00:05:55,830 --> 00:06:01,200
that you're using and hooking up to your

165
00:05:57,270 --> 00:06:02,820
three-point hitch okay so the first

166
00:06:01,200 --> 00:06:04,860
thing that you need to do is gonna be to

167
00:06:02,820 --> 00:06:06,990
put your tractor in park turn that

168
00:06:04,860 --> 00:06:09,180
sucker off for the initial hookup okay

169
00:06:06,990 --> 00:06:11,400
so we may need to turn the machine on it

170
00:06:09,180 --> 00:06:13,530
at a certain point in time here but get

171
00:06:11,400 --> 00:06:15,420
your tractor off get it in park in

172
00:06:13,530 --> 00:06:16,770
neutral that kind of thing so safety

173
00:06:15,420 --> 00:06:18,960
first as always I want to make sure

174
00:06:16,770 --> 00:06:20,880
that's above and beyond everything else

175
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:23,010
that we do next thing after that you're

176
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:24,690
gonna see I am on a completely level

177
00:06:23,010 --> 00:06:26,880
section of ground here you know that's

178
00:06:24,690 --> 00:06:28,110
gonna make your life so much easier you

179
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,790
know there's a point in time when I had

180
00:06:28,110 --> 00:06:32,370
a lot of attachments stored in my back

181
00:06:29,790 --> 00:06:34,620
yard and it has just a slight slope you

182
00:06:32,370 --> 00:06:36,450
know it's not significant it's enough to

183
00:06:34,620 --> 00:06:38,580
notice but it's nothing crazy and I

184
00:06:36,450 --> 00:06:40,650
always used to Park attachments in the

185
00:06:38,580 --> 00:06:42,510
back edge of my lawn on my yard there

186
00:06:40,650 --> 00:06:43,830
along that slope and it was just a

187
00:06:42,510 --> 00:06:45,660
nightmare to constantly hook those

188
00:06:43,830 --> 00:06:47,280
things up and detach them and everything

189
00:06:45,660 --> 00:06:49,110
else and I just absolutely hated it so

190
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,030
if you can park on a piece of level

191
00:06:49,110 --> 00:06:53,190
ground your attachments it's gonna make

192
00:06:51,030 --> 00:06:55,080
life so much easier next thing you're

193
00:06:53,190 --> 00:06:57,120
gonna see I do have all my attachments

194
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:58,950
typically gonna be stored on a pallet

195
00:06:57,120 --> 00:07:00,600
and that's for a couple of reasons one

196
00:06:58,950 --> 00:07:01,680
you know you can move them around easier

197
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:03,540
if you need to move them from point A to

198
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:05,160
point B if they're already on a pallet

199
00:07:03,540 --> 00:07:06,169
and set up and ready to go it's a lot

200
00:07:05,160 --> 00:07:08,090
easier that way

201
00:07:06,169 --> 00:07:10,009
- it gets that attachment a little bit

202
00:07:08,090 --> 00:07:11,779
higher off the ground it's not fun you

203
00:07:10,009 --> 00:07:13,279
know the older you get the less you want

204
00:07:11,779 --> 00:07:14,840
to be bent down hunkered over and

205
00:07:13,279 --> 00:07:16,189
everything else so you know even the

206
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:18,289
four or five inches that you see here

207
00:07:16,189 --> 00:07:19,520
makes a big difference the other reason

208
00:07:18,289 --> 00:07:21,650
that I find a pallet useful is because

209
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,330
on a machine like my forty sixty six are

210
00:07:21,650 --> 00:07:26,029
the three-point hitch doesn't always

211
00:07:23,330 --> 00:07:27,529
drop down far enough to allow like the

212
00:07:26,029 --> 00:07:29,539
quick hitch for instance here to release

213
00:07:27,529 --> 00:07:31,129
from underneath these pins and so if I

214
00:07:29,539 --> 00:07:32,569
have an elevator a little bit higher and

215
00:07:31,129 --> 00:07:34,099
makes that process a lot easier

216
00:07:32,569 --> 00:07:36,319
so there's several reasons there to use

217
00:07:34,099 --> 00:07:38,330
pallets or something else to raise up

218
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:39,589
your attachments it's also nice just to

219
00:07:38,330 --> 00:07:41,960
keep them off the ground from moisture

220
00:07:39,589 --> 00:07:43,819
corrosion that kind of thing as well you

221
00:07:41,960 --> 00:07:45,710
know so it's much easier to focus on one

222
00:07:43,819 --> 00:07:48,319
point rather than trying to focus here

223
00:07:45,710 --> 00:07:50,300
and here and here all three points you

224
00:07:48,319 --> 00:07:52,039
know so the biggest thing that I try to

225
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:54,560
do when I'm backing up to an implement

226
00:07:52,039 --> 00:07:56,659
is lining up the center link with the

227
00:07:54,560 --> 00:07:58,789
top pin position here on the three-point

228
00:07:56,659 --> 00:08:00,889
hitch don't worry so much about the

229
00:07:58,789 --> 00:08:02,569
sides down here as long as you feel like

230
00:08:00,889 --> 00:08:03,830
you're pretty square it's gonna come out

231
00:08:02,569 --> 00:08:05,479
all right you'll be able to have enough

232
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:07,639
adjustment there typically or you can

233
00:08:05,479 --> 00:08:09,439
get on the tractor and slightly go back

234
00:08:07,639 --> 00:08:11,689
further or forward after you have one

235
00:08:09,439 --> 00:08:13,310
pin attached focus on the center link

236
00:08:11,689 --> 00:08:14,629
getting it aligned up here in the middle

237
00:08:13,310 --> 00:08:16,430
because that way you know your spacing

238
00:08:14,629 --> 00:08:20,539
is correct and your top link is correct

239
00:08:16,430 --> 00:08:22,129
as well typically what I like to do is

240
00:08:20,539 --> 00:08:24,199
start out with my three-point hitch as

241
00:08:22,129 --> 00:08:26,089
low as possible and then I'll raise it

242
00:08:24,199 --> 00:08:28,430
down up from there so let's go ahead and

243
00:08:26,089 --> 00:08:30,289
get that done now and this is something

244
00:08:28,430 --> 00:08:31,909
you can do with the tractor off in the

245
00:08:30,289 --> 00:08:33,589
park position so if it's not in the

246
00:08:31,909 --> 00:08:35,180
lowest position right now you can just

247
00:08:33,589 --> 00:08:37,099
go ahead and move that rock shaft lever

248
00:08:35,180 --> 00:08:38,719
all the way down and it'll naturally do

249
00:08:37,099 --> 00:08:40,130
its thing if there's nothing on the

250
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:41,870
three-point arms for example then you

251
00:08:40,130 --> 00:08:43,399
might just need to give it a little bit

252
00:08:41,870 --> 00:08:47,290
of a push in order to encourage you to

253
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:47,290
go down but it will go down okay

254
00:08:50,860 --> 00:09:01,360
I should probably open up this rated rap

255
00:08:53,380 --> 00:09:03,010
a little bit more now if you're lucky

256
00:09:01,360 --> 00:09:06,370
enough to have a model of tractor that

257
00:09:03,010 --> 00:09:08,709
has this style of sway arm down here

258
00:09:06,370 --> 00:09:10,180
okay with just a pin where you can pull

259
00:09:08,709 --> 00:09:12,160
it out and position it in different

260
00:09:10,180 --> 00:09:15,100
areas now is the time that I would say

261
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:18,790
to release those do it on this side as

262
00:09:15,100 --> 00:09:24,279
well see how much flexibility that gives

263
00:09:18,790 --> 00:09:26,110
you the other style is gonna be this

264
00:09:24,279 --> 00:09:28,000
turnbuckle style of sway arm down here

265
00:09:26,110 --> 00:09:29,320
as well typically once they're set up

266
00:09:28,000 --> 00:09:31,120
there's not going to be a whole lot of

267
00:09:29,320 --> 00:09:33,250
adjustment that's required but there is

268
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,470
a tightening nut on here or sometimes a

269
00:09:33,250 --> 00:09:37,630
pin that goes through to hold this

270
00:09:35,470 --> 00:09:39,130
little Center link in place you undo

271
00:09:37,630 --> 00:09:41,500
that and then you can loosen it up and

272
00:09:39,130 --> 00:09:43,390
it'll shorten this gap here or lengthen

273
00:09:41,500 --> 00:09:47,260
it out to give you more adjustment that

274
00:09:43,390 --> 00:09:49,120
way so at this point here I'm just going

275
00:09:47,260 --> 00:09:50,500
to go ahead and back up to it and what

276
00:09:49,120 --> 00:09:52,990
I'm gonna do is I'm gonna attach these

277
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,240
lower links first and so as I'm backing

278
00:09:52,990 --> 00:09:58,060
up you can see you can pick up on on the

279
00:09:55,240 --> 00:09:59,860
the arms here okay and so I'm gonna keep

280
00:09:58,060 --> 00:10:01,750
them just slightly lower than what the

281
00:09:59,860 --> 00:10:03,430
elevation is here and then once I get

282
00:10:01,750 --> 00:10:05,550
back here I'm gonna attach the lower

283
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:07,930
link first whatever one appears to be

284
00:10:05,550 --> 00:10:09,130
just slightly lower I know it's level

285
00:10:07,930 --> 00:10:10,660
ground but there's still gonna be one

286
00:10:09,130 --> 00:10:12,220
that's probably not perfectly level you

287
00:10:10,660 --> 00:10:14,470
know so I'm gonna put the lower one on

288
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:16,779
first and then if I need to I can lift

289
00:10:14,470 --> 00:10:18,699
up I can turn the machine on lift up

290
00:10:16,779 --> 00:10:23,399
just slightly and get the other side

291
00:10:18,699 --> 00:10:23,399
link to match up and slide over the pin

292
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:39,060
so you can see at this point we're just

293
00:10:36,480 --> 00:10:40,140
about there all right and with an

294
00:10:39,060 --> 00:10:41,610
attachment that's a little bit lighter

295
00:10:40,140 --> 00:10:43,470
like this you can actually just kind of

296
00:10:41,610 --> 00:10:45,180
scoot it forward a little bit you know

297
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:47,610
and get it into place there if you

298
00:10:45,180 --> 00:10:48,840
needed to you could actually just have

299
00:10:47,610 --> 00:10:50,520
it go right underneath those pins

300
00:10:48,840 --> 00:10:51,780
completely and then you can pull out to

301
00:10:50,520 --> 00:10:53,520
the side you see how they're gonna go

302
00:10:51,780 --> 00:10:55,740
out to the side a little bit and give

303
00:10:53,520 --> 00:10:57,240
yourself some more room that way so what

304
00:10:55,740 --> 00:11:00,450
I'm gonna do in this situation is just

305
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:04,170
scoot it slightly forward here get these

306
00:11:00,450 --> 00:11:05,340
pins off of here throw it over there and

307
00:11:04,170 --> 00:11:12,060
now let's lift up you can see how I'm

308
00:11:05,340 --> 00:11:16,400
just lifting up just like that and we'll

309
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:18,690
just give it a little jiggle and it's on

310
00:11:16,400 --> 00:11:20,820
so to make the connection over on this

311
00:11:18,690 --> 00:11:22,020
second lower pin over here I'm gonna go

312
00:11:20,820 --> 00:11:24,210
ahead and turn the machine on just a

313
00:11:22,020 --> 00:11:26,100
little bit and raise it up so that way

314
00:11:24,210 --> 00:11:28,760
this arm is raising a touch to slide

315
00:11:26,100 --> 00:11:28,760
over here easier

316
00:11:33,329 --> 00:11:40,589
and I'm guessing that's all that's gonna

317
00:11:35,489 --> 00:11:43,019
be needed give it a little jiggle like

318
00:11:40,589 --> 00:11:45,959
that and I have this here just in case

319
00:11:43,019 --> 00:11:48,290
because feel free you know if you just

320
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,309
need a centimeter more or whatever else

321
00:11:48,290 --> 00:11:52,639
give a little whack like that and that's

322
00:11:50,309 --> 00:11:55,499
no problem at all

323
00:11:52,639 --> 00:11:58,379
put that lower link there now we're on

324
00:11:55,499 --> 00:11:59,549
to the top link here so with the top

325
00:11:58,379 --> 00:12:02,279
link here you're gonna see it is

326
00:11:59,549 --> 00:12:03,749
adjustable got this locking or Jam nut

327
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,119
on here too so if it is tightened down

328
00:12:03,749 --> 00:12:08,220
you're not gonna be able to lengthen out

329
00:12:06,119 --> 00:12:10,049
this side once it's attached but you can

330
00:12:08,220 --> 00:12:20,459
loosen that up too and then we'll get

331
00:12:10,049 --> 00:12:22,049
this attached and you'll see that

332
00:12:20,459 --> 00:12:38,399
sometimes if these don't have any grease

333
00:12:22,049 --> 00:12:40,079
on him they're a little stiff okay so

334
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:42,689
you have two ways that you can level

335
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:45,059
this three-point attachment out okay so

336
00:12:42,689 --> 00:12:47,819
first is you're gonna have your top link

337
00:12:45,059 --> 00:12:49,679
that will level this way okay or pitch

338
00:12:47,819 --> 00:12:51,419
if you want something to you know to get

339
00:12:49,679 --> 00:12:53,249
a more aggressive dig or line if you

340
00:12:51,419 --> 00:12:54,689
want or to have it ride a little bit

341
00:12:53,249 --> 00:12:56,939
more smoothly and evenly all the way

342
00:12:54,689 --> 00:12:58,679
across so depends on the attachment that

343
00:12:56,939 --> 00:13:01,470
you have on how you want it set up by

344
00:12:58,679 --> 00:13:02,850
giving that angle or levelness forward

345
00:13:01,470 --> 00:13:05,009
to backwards is gonna be with the top

346
00:13:02,850 --> 00:13:06,989
link here now what gives you level

347
00:13:05,009 --> 00:13:09,540
side-to-side okay this way in this way

348
00:13:06,989 --> 00:13:11,220
is gonna be with these two arms here and

349
00:13:09,540 --> 00:13:13,559
that's so much with this arm over here

350
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:14,879
but you are gonna have adjustment right

351
00:13:13,559 --> 00:13:17,189
here in this arm and so in the same way

352
00:13:14,879 --> 00:13:18,540
that you can adjust a top link you know

353
00:13:17,189 --> 00:13:20,489
you can put your set of channel locks or

354
00:13:18,540 --> 00:13:22,769
wherever else on here and you can rotate

355
00:13:20,489 --> 00:13:25,290
this and adjust it along this threaded

356
00:13:22,769 --> 00:13:26,759
rod here to either level it out if you

357
00:13:25,290 --> 00:13:29,279
want or if you want to say you're

358
00:13:26,759 --> 00:13:30,449
grading with a with a back blade or a

359
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,919
box weight or something else and you

360
00:13:30,449 --> 00:13:34,350
want one side to dig in more for

361
00:13:31,919 --> 00:13:36,600
instance you can offset it that way to

362
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:38,519
allow for that to happen what you will

363
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:40,379
see on some fancier setups like this one

364
00:13:38,519 --> 00:13:42,569
here are gonna be a little bit of an

365
00:13:40,379 --> 00:13:45,059
easier adjustment that you can make with

366
00:13:42,569 --> 00:13:47,310
this contraption right here whatever you

367
00:13:45,059 --> 00:13:48,330
want to call it and so but a little bit

368
00:13:47,310 --> 00:13:50,340
you're that way to do and you can just

369
00:13:48,330 --> 00:13:52,200
slot it right back down in there and

370
00:13:50,340 --> 00:13:53,820
make that adjustment a little bit easier

371
00:13:52,200 --> 00:13:58,350
but let me show you an even easier way

372
00:13:53,820 --> 00:14:00,810
yet okay so yeah this is definitely as

373
00:13:58,350 --> 00:14:02,700
easy as you can get it all right and so

374
00:14:00,810 --> 00:14:04,200
this is also the most expensive way

375
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:05,490
there's no doubt about it but it is

376
00:14:04,200 --> 00:14:07,800
pretty cool so I wanted to show it to

377
00:14:05,490 --> 00:14:09,270
you you know there's a there's a lot of

378
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,950
money that's tied up in something like

379
00:14:09,270 --> 00:14:12,810
this set up here because you need to

380
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:15,180
have two functions okay like a fourth

381
00:14:12,810 --> 00:14:17,910
and a fifth remote right here dedicated

382
00:14:15,180 --> 00:14:19,560
to operating the setup in addition to

383
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:21,900
that you have to buy you know your

384
00:14:19,560 --> 00:14:24,270
hydraulic top link here and your

385
00:14:21,900 --> 00:14:26,250
hydraulic side link over here so instead

386
00:14:24,270 --> 00:14:27,750
of having to mess with the monkeying

387
00:14:26,250 --> 00:14:29,040
around you know manually threading the

388
00:14:27,750 --> 00:14:30,990
rods in and out and trying to get a

389
00:14:29,040 --> 00:14:32,910
level and everything else you can simply

390
00:14:30,990 --> 00:14:34,830
after you have this whole system set up

391
00:14:32,910 --> 00:14:36,660
you know use a couple levers right from

392
00:14:34,830 --> 00:14:38,700
your operator station and make those

393
00:14:36,660 --> 00:14:40,710
adjustments on the fly or if you need to

394
00:14:38,700 --> 00:14:42,720
if you're detaching from one and then

395
00:14:40,710 --> 00:14:44,670
going up to hook up to another one even

396
00:14:42,720 --> 00:14:47,490
on those uneven surfaces because you can

397
00:14:44,670 --> 00:14:48,630
just simply angle your you're quick

398
00:14:47,490 --> 00:14:51,300
hedge here or your three-point hitch

399
00:14:48,630 --> 00:14:55,380
this way for instance and then hook up

400
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:57,089
to it level it out and away you go now

401
00:14:55,380 --> 00:14:58,830
the other really cool feature found on

402
00:14:57,089 --> 00:15:00,990
the 4-hour series and I think some

403
00:14:58,830 --> 00:15:03,690
larger series as well is called hitch

404
00:15:00,990 --> 00:15:05,070
assist and with this knob right here I

405
00:15:03,690 --> 00:15:06,300
can raise and lower the three-point

406
00:15:05,070 --> 00:15:08,490
hitch from right back here off the

407
00:15:06,300 --> 00:15:09,990
operator seat and with these functions

408
00:15:08,490 --> 00:15:12,030
right here I can actually move the

409
00:15:09,990 --> 00:15:14,700
tractor slowly forward or backwards to

410
00:15:12,030 --> 00:15:16,589
just allow it to slowly creep backwards

411
00:15:14,700 --> 00:15:18,420
and hook up or slowly go forwards and

412
00:15:16,589 --> 00:15:19,710
hook up that way with or without a quick

413
00:15:18,420 --> 00:15:21,750
edge doesn't matter if it's just the

414
00:15:19,710 --> 00:15:24,089
three-point arms itself or a quick hitch

415
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:25,710
either way I have done an entire video

416
00:15:24,089 --> 00:15:27,030
on this system and how to operate it

417
00:15:25,710 --> 00:15:28,380
I'll post a link above but I don't want

418
00:15:27,030 --> 00:15:30,810
to spend too much time going through the

419
00:15:28,380 --> 00:15:31,920
ins and outs of it right now you know so

420
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,839
if you think that hooking up to a

421
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:36,330
three-point hitch is a real pain in the

422
00:15:33,839 --> 00:15:38,610
butt then you're not alone and that's

423
00:15:36,330 --> 00:15:40,500
why these quick hitches have become so

424
00:15:38,610 --> 00:15:42,240
popular with everybody you can't

425
00:15:40,500 --> 00:15:43,950
actually do any work with it but it

426
00:15:42,240 --> 00:15:46,320
takes so much of the frustration and

427
00:15:43,950 --> 00:15:48,480
just the horribleness about hooking up

428
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:50,550
to a three point attachment out of that

429
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,870
process so I'm gonna go ahead and show

430
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:54,209
you really quick here how to put one of

431
00:15:51,870 --> 00:15:55,860
these on once it's on it's on right so

432
00:15:54,209 --> 00:15:58,680
it's good for any attachment you just

433
00:15:55,860 --> 00:16:00,750
hook and unhook as needed and it's just

434
00:15:58,680 --> 00:16:01,950
a lot simpler process

435
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:03,510
I can sell one of these to you as well I

436
00:16:01,950 --> 00:16:05,070
can even ship them for a really

437
00:16:03,510 --> 00:16:06,360
reasonable rate so go ahead and get a

438
00:16:05,070 --> 00:16:08,220
hold of me and go to good works tractors

439
00:16:06,360 --> 00:16:12,150
comm and check them out they're gonna

440
00:16:08,220 --> 00:16:15,870
come with three pins here all the

441
00:16:12,150 --> 00:16:17,640
hardware you need to hook them up and

442
00:16:15,870 --> 00:16:20,100
these quick hitches are built to a

443
00:16:17,640 --> 00:16:22,620
standard a SAE specification which is

444
00:16:20,100 --> 00:16:24,180
just a dimensional spacing requirement

445
00:16:22,620 --> 00:16:32,820
for quick hitches and for quick hitch

446
00:16:24,180 --> 00:16:36,660
compatible attachments it can make it

447
00:16:32,820 --> 00:16:39,090
easier for some of the heavier ones like

448
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:40,710
this is a pretty heavy footage here you

449
00:16:39,090 --> 00:16:44,610
know if you want to have another person

450
00:16:40,710 --> 00:16:47,040
helping you out but otherwise once you

451
00:16:44,610 --> 00:16:48,560
get it on there it's pretty

452
00:16:47,040 --> 00:16:54,090
straightforward

453
00:16:48,560 --> 00:17:08,670
it's just a matter managing it all by

454
00:16:54,090 --> 00:17:10,770
yourself your top link in here and boom

455
00:17:08,670 --> 00:17:12,390
there you go you do have adjustments

456
00:17:10,770 --> 00:17:13,589
here for the top hook okay so you can

457
00:17:12,390 --> 00:17:15,120
see the different positions you can

458
00:17:13,589 --> 00:17:18,449
raise it up and down if you need to in

459
00:17:15,120 --> 00:17:21,780
there you know these are just spring

460
00:17:18,449 --> 00:17:23,100
loaded on the arms here again you do

461
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:25,110
need a set of bushings for every

462
00:17:23,100 --> 00:17:26,540
attachment that you put that you plan to

463
00:17:25,110 --> 00:17:28,620
hook up to your quick hitch here but

464
00:17:26,540 --> 00:17:30,390
really sweet piece of equipment here

465
00:17:28,620 --> 00:17:32,850
again you can't do any work with it

466
00:17:30,390 --> 00:17:36,230
specifically but man it makes work more

467
00:17:32,850 --> 00:17:36,230
efficient and more enjoyable

468
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:15,160
so really quick just go over how to hook

469
00:18:12,400 --> 00:18:16,480
up a three-point hitch attachment or the

470
00:18:15,160 --> 00:18:19,000
rear shaft of a three-point hitch

471
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:20,679
attachment to your rear pto you can see

472
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:22,360
there's the splines in there okay and

473
00:18:20,679 --> 00:18:24,280
these simply it's just like a keys just

474
00:18:22,360 --> 00:18:26,080
got to fit right with the splines that

475
00:18:24,280 --> 00:18:27,850
are on the back of your tractor the

476
00:18:26,080 --> 00:18:29,950
output shaft there for the rear pto and

477
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:31,630
so typically what you need to do after

478
00:18:29,950 --> 00:18:34,090
you get to a certain point you're gonna

479
00:18:31,630 --> 00:18:36,010
have a little button like this or you're

480
00:18:34,090 --> 00:18:37,330
gonna have a collar to pull back okay

481
00:18:36,010 --> 00:18:38,679
it's gonna help it seat on there and

482
00:18:37,330 --> 00:18:40,360
then lock into place so it doesn't fly

483
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:42,190
off while you're actually using the

484
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:44,710
implement you'll be able to get the

485
00:18:42,190 --> 00:18:46,000
shaft on partway but then before you get

486
00:18:44,710 --> 00:18:48,280
it the whole way you're gonna have to

487
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:50,020
hit that button there or again pull the

488
00:18:48,280 --> 00:18:51,790
collar back to get it to go all the way

489
00:18:50,020 --> 00:18:53,679
on and then pull back a little bit get

490
00:18:51,790 --> 00:18:55,330
it to seat you'll be good to go so this

491
00:18:53,679 --> 00:18:56,890
is gonna be the collar style instead of

492
00:18:55,330 --> 00:18:59,049
that little push button you just have a

493
00:18:56,890 --> 00:19:00,580
collar to pull back on and so same thing

494
00:18:59,049 --> 00:19:02,320
when you're releasing the pto chef and

495
00:19:00,580 --> 00:19:03,700
you want to take it off the tractor you

496
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:05,320
got to either pull back on that collar

497
00:19:03,700 --> 00:19:07,120
or we have to push on that button and

498
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:09,760
then pull back at the same time okay

499
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:14,590
same concept for a mid pto as well for

500
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:16,510
you folks with mower decks so I'm a

501
00:19:14,590 --> 00:19:18,490
pretty realistic guy I know that a

502
00:19:16,510 --> 00:19:20,290
hydraulic top and tilt kit and this

503
00:19:18,490 --> 00:19:22,120
whole setup here is just not gonna

504
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:24,910
happen for most of us you know it's just

505
00:19:22,120 --> 00:19:26,919
a cool thing it's it's the cat's meow

506
00:19:24,910 --> 00:19:28,210
you know the creme de la creme the kind

507
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,340
of the best setup you can get for that

508
00:19:28,210 --> 00:19:32,710
the worst setup is your traditional

509
00:19:30,340 --> 00:19:34,059
three-point hitch right so a good middle

510
00:19:32,710 --> 00:19:36,160
ground there and actually a pretty

511
00:19:34,059 --> 00:19:37,750
reasonable price point is gonna be that

512
00:19:36,160 --> 00:19:39,130
quick hitch there if that's the route

513
00:19:37,750 --> 00:19:40,690
you want to go I can definitely help you

514
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:43,360
out with it again go to good works

tractors comm I can ship them to you if

516
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:46,780
you're not too far away you know seven

517
00:19:45,040 --> 00:19:48,309
eight nine hundred miles I can ship them

518
00:19:46,780 --> 00:19:49,660
really cheap and not a whole lot more

519
00:19:48,309 --> 00:19:51,340
even a little bit further than that so
