1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:03,959
you'll notice this plant has the roots

2
00:00:02,159 --> 00:00:05,720
circling the bottom of the pot The Roots

3
00:00:03,959 --> 00:00:07,439
haven't grown out of the holes yet but

4
00:00:05,720 --> 00:00:10,200
the roots are growing in a circular

5
00:00:07,439 --> 00:00:11,559
motion and we want to break that um and

6
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:13,000
this one you'll see that the roots are

7
00:00:11,559 --> 00:00:15,000
actually coming out of the bottom of the

8
00:00:13,000 --> 00:00:17,400
pot so those are two signals that it's

9
00:00:15,000 --> 00:00:19,119
time to repot because these plants are

10
00:00:17,400 --> 00:00:20,840
about to take off with new growth

11
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:22,320
because in Spring there's more light so

12
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:23,760
there's more photosynthesis there's more

13
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,960
opportunity for the plant to generate

14
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:26,960
food to grow grow grow
