  "text": "my name is dawn delhi i'm a senior scientist with dari indeed based in canterbury but for the last 10 or so years have been involved in research projects around wintering in also fog system design and Zetland in South Otago and currently I'm leading the farm systems implementation at southern Derry hub and a couple of projects relating to what a bit of feeding so today and my session what I'm going to try to do is bring together some of the key messages that you've heard from Nick and Helen and relation to good management practice and animal welfare and talk about the importance of pedak setup and contingency plans for adverse weather and partway through I'm going to flick over to Olivia and she's going to give us some perspective from a max livestock point of view so next slide please so why is it important that we have pedak grazing plans well first of all it helps to see wintering expectations and if you can do this with your team it means that everybody is on the same page and they know what success is going to look like for your farm it also helps the team to understand the way that you do things in a particular way on your farm so we know there's lots of different systems out here and everybody does things slightly differently so understanding the why for your farm means that they'll be in a better position to make informed decisions if things are going off plan also by having individual paddock grazing plans you can identify and highlight the risks of specific paddocks so if I think about the southern dairy hub we went to on both our upper terrace and also on our lower flex we know that the soil type on our lowest terrace for a lot of the flat as Hibiya we have a number of paddocks with critical source areas and also we have a waterway that runs through the middle so those paddocks have quite different risks in terms of implementation of grazing compared with the ones on our upper terrace the other thing was having these pallet grazing plans is it allows you to discuss implant for the adverse weather events and think about some of those things that Helens just highlighted in relation to animal welfare and it yes the the overall objective is really looking at maximizing the chances of achieving your spring curving in lemon targets so what I'm going to go through an exercise thank so much as just the key factors to consider in the plane and it's really about bringing together things that neck in hello talked about onto into a concise form and sharing it with the team or developing with the team so what I'm going to talk about is and they recently released brickbeard wintering resource it's an update obvious accessible imposture wintering material that's been out there previously so in terms of the plan thinking about your critical source areas in waterways putting them on your on your map then with it you can look at your grazing direction and how you can utilize in a shelter where your bales are going to be placed how you're going to manage your portable troughs and alongside the back fencing and then also looking at more access points you've got to the paddock and do your specific access points for people animals and vehicles so we'll just move on and look at what the resources are that you need to develop this plan so it's not actually a lot of resource required either affirm map or within the brake feed wintering guides there are some resource templates that you can use if you don't have a farm that you need some writing material pens or pencils the farm team in some dedicated time so what you may choose to do is if you've got a number of panics on your farm and you've got a few on your team maybe give each member of the team I've had it to go away and think through the initial plan for and then come back as a group exercise or n discuss what everybody's come up with one of the things that we've found valuable at the southern dairy hub is using Google Maps over our farm map and from there we can pick up sometimes some more subtle critical source areas that we might need to deal with they might not be weak when they're in grass but potentially can be a challenge when the Herren crop so yeah just get your farm team involved and start documenting how you're planning on grazing those paddocks next slide thanks Hamish the other thing with developing those pellet plans is thinking about your how that fits with your address with a contingency plan so Helens highlighted some of these aspects were really so from the animal welfare perspective the plan needs to consider access to shelter so we have you've got those opportunities what does the you're lying surface look like and also the access to feed so in potentially having additional feed available for periods of adverse events from an environmental perspective we need to take into consideration and you salt right and what that looks like after 2 or 3 days of heavy rain in wet weather looking at any areas that maybe came come larger risk in terms of runoff and to surface water ways and and particularly any flooding risk that there might be as well in the third area for our contingency plan to consider is around people in safety so having developed the plan as everybody on board with it and how easy is it to implement when they be it may arise how can you keep your people safe and being able to access the the paddocks in the animals through that period of time and for snow means keeping particularly animals safe if we lose power during that event so just move on and look at some of the factors or things that you can consider in terms of an invis plan for cash walk so things Hamish so in terms our contingency plan for cattle some of the options well initially we need to think about and their feed budgeting process having an additional feed on hand for that period of time so recommendations having an extra team sit there looking at options to increase the area are available through this adverse event so that might be by giving an extra break up of crop we need to be mindful with Fatih Beach and depending on what the allocation level is that that may not be feasible option without risking animal health issues however there may be instances we actually taking your back fence further away from the crop face may allow the animals to EXCI some drier areas that I've already been through and gives them more space to spread out and find those those better areas when you're developing your pet grazing plan looking it is their opportunity to save crop and a drier lower risk part of the paddock may be a week's worth of feed Thea that you can bring animals back to if necessary or as I mentioned earlier what we look at the southern dairy hunters the opportunity to bring animals of a heavier soils on to dry a lower risk Penix up on the upper terrace if you're looking at out of pedak options there might be opportunity to stand off and laneways or yards or some rough grass areas but it's important to remember that cows don't particularly or animals don't particularly like lying on hard concrete surfaces so that's really a short-term solution and there are some may be opportunity to use some safety blocks when I say save tree blocks probably not a good idea to have your pregnant animals and areas with macrocarpa but there might be some pine plantations you can use so now I'm going to hand over to Olivia who's going to go through and what you might need to consider differently from the sheep perspective thanks for that dawn use some of those cater options obviously guys can be used but for other livestock including sheep and deer there might be some other options that you haven't thought of and I'm just going to go through some of them for you to consider so getting livestock to shout in areas with water you may be able to consider a grass runoff paddock when the weather is foul and have other options like utilizing green and sheet nuts while in those areas if it's going to be for extended period of time to make sure you can maximize shelter again you can use those lower risk Drive headaches as well you may consider larger breaks or day breaks or no number of people are doing that now as well from a deer perspective do you require bigger breaks than cattle and some deer farmers have been giving deer the whole paddock rather than strip grazing ensuring that critical source area is well protected the BET fencing of deer can increase stress which can result in spacing so it's best to properly avoid that if possible but each situation again is going to be different you look at prioritizing your stock classes so body condition scoring at skinning could be an option and look at transferring liner animals to grass and supplement you could be looking at doing some of us now as well if Fleming dates are split ensure that you feed stock based on their lemming and carving dates and if you want to share and I'm sure I don't need to tell you but the shearing increases feed demand and freshly shorn sheep are at higher risk in bad weather so make sure that you're considering the use of cover combs to reduce that risk lifters may be needed as well depending on their season and reduce that risk by just sharing one full sheet at a time and having a three-day get between especially if their weather is really unpredictable so that pretty much covers it the adorne so proceed back to you thanks for that Olivia so just a few of the factors to consider in terms of your abuse with a plan does all the team know when and how to implement that plan it's really important if you're the maybe the key decision-maker and you're going to be on farm for a period of time so having some clear triggers is to win that plan as needed is really important need to consider the crop type that the animals are grazing as well and can you keep feeding it during the adverse weather event this is particularly important for for the beach where we know it's really important that animals are transitioned onto on to the crop and have a consistent diet so if you're pulling them off and are for more than a couple of days then you might you would need to have some re transitioning picked it into your plan or an alternative might be to hit some lifted for the beach that you can give them a net out of paddock area so they stay on that drive through that period thinking about the impact of a decreased feed utilization during those adverse events on and take and how you're going to manage making sure that your animals are getting enough feed through that period of time and as I've mentioned previously thinking about your access in and out of paddocks for stock in people if you do have to move your stroke out and maybe that the gateways not not looking the beasts are the options to drop fences and move them out over a bigger area we acknowledge that it's pretty difficult to completely mitigate the conditions but by having a plan you can definitely look at options to minimize the impact so just in terms of finishing up by hemming sitting down taking some time and developing these plans it's a really great opportunity to see clear expectations around what success looks like for wintering on your property by involving the team and the process they can understand the why behind the activities and tasks that they're going out in doing on a daily basis and why it might be different between parrots on the property it encouraged you to steel with pride and any ideas from your farming colleagues is Helen mentioned people do have lots of really good ideas and they're doing things differently so just look just talk to your neighbors and and others and find out what are doing especially in terms of the adverse weather and I guess really encourage that doing something is better than doing nothing and real value in their pain and everybody being on the same page at the start of winter so I just want to finish off by with a quote from Napoleon that's his plan your work and work your plan",
