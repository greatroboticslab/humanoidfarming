1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,140
folks that we doing welcome to Good

2
00:00:01,380 --> 00:00:05,640
Works tractors it's a chilly day to say

3
00:00:04,140 --> 00:00:07,319
the least outside so I thought we'd do

4
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:09,540
something inside I just got

5
00:00:07,319 --> 00:00:12,360
a new air compressor and I've got a

6
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:14,160
couple other of the California yeah

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:15,839
California air tools brand air

8
00:00:14,160 --> 00:00:17,220
compressors as well and what I like

9
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,480
about them most you can't get them

10
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,460
locally at least that I've been able to

11
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:22,680
find but they're very quiet if you're

12
00:00:20,460 --> 00:00:24,060
inside I just hate all that noise you

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:25,920
can hear the heater going right now in

14
00:00:24,060 --> 00:00:27,960
the background probably and you just

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:29,939
well under compressor is way worse so if

16
00:00:27,960 --> 00:00:32,940
the saw goes well and I bought all the

17
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,500
right stuff for it here on Amazon then

18
00:00:32,940 --> 00:00:36,180
uh I'll turn it on at the end of this

19
00:00:34,500 --> 00:00:38,100
and show you how quiet it is it's it's

20
00:00:36,180 --> 00:00:39,420
pretty incredible this is this is the

21
00:00:38,100 --> 00:00:41,940
biggest one that I bought but it still

22
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:44,760
uh well it says says on there somewhere

23
00:00:41,940 --> 00:00:46,559
yeah oil free and ultra quiet so we'll

24
00:00:44,760 --> 00:00:48,660
see what's all about just plugs into a

25
00:00:46,559 --> 00:00:50,039
regular 110 outlet let's get to it here

26
00:00:48,660 --> 00:00:51,780
here well actually a couple of things

27
00:00:50,039 --> 00:00:53,340
too I wanted to point out

28
00:00:51,780 --> 00:00:55,079
well I'm still getting moved in here so

29
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,899
everything's a mess I don't have all my

30
00:00:55,079 --> 00:00:59,760
tools together but I saw this earlier I

31
00:00:57,899 --> 00:01:02,340
want to show you I did get

32
00:00:59,760 --> 00:01:04,379
I got a yank them rope like you guys

33
00:01:02,340 --> 00:01:07,560
talked about back when we got the uh the

34
00:01:04,379 --> 00:01:10,200
skid steer stuck so got this right here

35
00:01:07,560 --> 00:01:12,420
haven't had to use it yet but I'm sure I

36
00:01:10,200 --> 00:01:14,820
will sometime soon but got this big old

37
00:01:12,420 --> 00:01:17,220
there's a fat rope I think I got one

38
00:01:14,820 --> 00:01:18,840
that was rated for a lot of weight did

39
00:01:17,220 --> 00:01:20,820
come with a couple of shackles here too

40
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:23,280
so

41
00:01:20,820 --> 00:01:25,680
anyway that was your guy's suggestion

42
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,140
and I've got one other thing to show you

43
00:01:25,680 --> 00:01:30,180
that I need a suggestion on because this

44
00:01:28,140 --> 00:01:31,680
is super annoying here watch this let me

45
00:01:30,180 --> 00:01:33,720
get this out of the way

46
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:36,000
I've got this little piece of paper

47
00:01:33,720 --> 00:01:37,560
holding that drawer in but watch if you

48
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:39,960
just open it and want to close it again

49
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:41,159
it just starts to open back up that's

50
00:01:39,960 --> 00:01:43,500
real Annoying none of the other drawers

51
00:01:41,159 --> 00:01:45,000
do that

52
00:01:43,500 --> 00:01:48,900
stay in place you know this one here

53
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:50,340
stays all the other ones stay

54
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:53,579
but not that top one that's real

55
00:01:50,340 --> 00:01:55,759
Annoying how do I fix that

56
00:01:53,579 --> 00:01:58,079
we'll put that back in there for now

57
00:01:55,759 --> 00:01:59,399
yeah here we go all right folks thought

58
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:01,259
I'd tell you a little bit about this

59
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:04,259
thing uh while we're putting it together

60
00:02:01,259 --> 00:02:06,659
again it's my third one I've got two of

61
00:02:04,259 --> 00:02:07,619
the one horsepower units one that I

62
00:02:06,659 --> 00:02:08,940
bought a lot well I bought both of them

63
00:02:07,619 --> 00:02:12,420
a long time ago one for my house and one

64
00:02:08,940 --> 00:02:14,160
for my shop and uh still using one at

65
00:02:12,420 --> 00:02:15,180
the shop I got the other one at the barn

66
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:16,980
I'll probably end up bringing the

67
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:18,840
smaller one up here to the to the house

68
00:02:16,980 --> 00:02:20,760
and leave this new bigger one out there

69
00:02:18,840 --> 00:02:24,360
at the barn it'll be more useful out

70
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:28,319
there this is a 10 gallon tank on here

71
00:02:24,360 --> 00:02:32,580
70 decibels two horsepower motor 125 psi

72
00:02:28,319 --> 00:02:34,260
Max 5.3 CFM at 90 PSI that must be a

73
00:02:32,580 --> 00:02:36,540
common readout I don't know so this

74
00:02:34,260 --> 00:02:38,940
thing is well it's California air tools

75
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,400
but I don't want you to be misled there

76
00:02:38,940 --> 00:02:44,700
on the box it says made in Mexico the

77
00:02:41,400 --> 00:02:46,920
the motor itself says made in China

78
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:48,000
110 volt 15 amp so you can see we're

79
00:02:46,920 --> 00:02:50,400
going to have it hooked up just a

80
00:02:48,000 --> 00:02:51,900
regular outlet in our garage oh we're

81
00:02:50,400 --> 00:02:53,459
going to do a sound test too at the end

82
00:02:51,900 --> 00:02:56,160
and show you just how loud this thing is

83
00:02:53,459 --> 00:02:57,900
or how quiet it is maybe depending on on

84
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:00,000
what way you want to go with it but the

85
00:02:57,900 --> 00:03:02,099
manufacturer of the video too it looks

86
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:04,620
like maybe they found the noisiest air

87
00:03:02,099 --> 00:03:07,140
compressor to compare it against but

88
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:10,440
that does give you a pretty good

89
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:12,060
sound comparison between something that

90
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:13,920
is pretty darn quiet versus something

91
00:03:12,060 --> 00:03:15,780
that is like chattering and loud and

92
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:17,640
really annoying a few interesting points

93
00:03:15,780 --> 00:03:19,200
that the manufacturers States they've

94
00:03:17,640 --> 00:03:21,540
got an easy start valve allowing it for

95
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:23,760
easier startups using less starting amps

96
00:03:21,540 --> 00:03:25,560
oil free pump allows it for use in a

97
00:03:23,760 --> 00:03:28,500
variety of temperatures you know and

98
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:30,540
quotes cold starts and uneven terrain no

99
00:03:28,500 --> 00:03:32,220
oil in the pump the easy start valve

100
00:03:30,540 --> 00:03:34,620
releases a small amount of air from the

101
00:03:32,220 --> 00:03:36,360
pump at startup to produce a no load

102
00:03:34,620 --> 00:03:38,519
condition allowing the motor to spin

103
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:41,099
freely and again it is a pretty large

104
00:03:38,519 --> 00:03:43,799
for its size at least 10 gallon steel

105
00:03:41,099 --> 00:03:44,760
air tank I read a review on on this one

106
00:03:43,799 --> 00:03:47,159
just because I wanted to make sure it

107
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,599
was similar to the other ones I have and

108
00:03:47,159 --> 00:03:50,640
they didn't put this

109
00:03:48,599 --> 00:03:53,099
I think it was just this

110
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:55,620
um little hose in here that made a big

111
00:03:53,099 --> 00:03:57,900
difference on the the sound level

112
00:03:55,620 --> 00:03:59,580
maybe they forgot to put the entire

113
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:01,019
filter on I can't remember what it was

114
00:03:59,580 --> 00:04:04,519
but uh

115
00:04:01,019 --> 00:04:04,519
regardless don't forget to do it

116
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,040
here we go

117
00:04:37,380 --> 00:04:42,060
I think that's how that goes

118
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:45,800
was there a there was an unthreaded

119
00:04:42,060 --> 00:04:45,800
space there must have been

120
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:57,900
all right five Ace

121
00:04:54,900 --> 00:04:57,900
13.

122
00:04:58,020 --> 00:05:04,320
maybe it's metric

123
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:07,320
real sloppy 17.

124
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:07,320
17.

125
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:21,720
it's fine now but boy that nut is oh was

126
00:05:19,620 --> 00:05:24,979
spinning with it

127
00:05:21,720 --> 00:05:24,979
that nut is not

128
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:29,340
oh that one's

129
00:05:27,180 --> 00:05:32,479
must just be a real fine line at how

130
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:32,479
much you have to tighten it

131
00:05:35,280 --> 00:05:38,720
careful not to over tighten

132
00:05:39,360 --> 00:05:44,460
nope too tight

133
00:05:42,419 --> 00:05:46,800
that other one seems to go freely I

134
00:05:44,460 --> 00:05:49,820
don't know what

135
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:49,820
I'm doing here

136
00:05:56,460 --> 00:06:00,979
still skidding a bit

137
00:05:58,440 --> 00:06:00,979
better

138
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:05,460
but that

139
00:06:03,180 --> 00:06:07,740
maybe it won't

140
00:06:05,460 --> 00:06:09,780
it's literally gonna

141
00:06:07,740 --> 00:06:12,199
it's gonna come it's gonna take itself

142
00:06:09,780 --> 00:06:12,199
right off

143
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:16,800
all right I thought we did something

144
00:06:14,280 --> 00:06:18,840
wrong on these uh casters you can see

145
00:06:16,800 --> 00:06:22,440
skid marks here

146
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:24,060
no not that kind of skid marks but uh it

147
00:06:22,440 --> 00:06:26,280
is not

148
00:06:24,060 --> 00:06:28,880
freely moving I thought we were doing

149
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,880
something wrong

150
00:06:28,919 --> 00:06:31,759
and we're not

151
00:06:32,580 --> 00:06:38,520
says tighten firmly come on

152
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,199
I'm not over tightening that seemed to

153
00:06:38,520 --> 00:06:41,520
make the condition worse

154
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:43,319
but if you don't tighten enough they

155
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120
just the nut starts to spin right off

156
00:06:43,319 --> 00:06:46,620
pretty quick

157
00:06:45,120 --> 00:06:48,419
anyway I don't know maybe we've got to

158
00:06:46,620 --> 00:06:50,819
add some grease on there

159
00:06:48,419 --> 00:06:53,400
it didn't call for it but

160
00:06:50,819 --> 00:06:55,139
but look that is it's not freely

161
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:57,300
spinning I'm pretty sure it's the same

162
00:06:55,139 --> 00:06:59,100
casters on all my other ones too I don't

163
00:06:57,300 --> 00:07:00,060
feel like that's going to loosen up with

164
00:06:59,100 --> 00:07:03,240
time

165
00:07:00,060 --> 00:07:07,639
I could be wrong that one

166
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,639
what the heck that one spins real nice

167
00:07:09,900 --> 00:07:13,919
oh we got one out of two of them

168
00:07:12,539 --> 00:07:15,120
working we'll just kind of lean it to

169
00:07:13,919 --> 00:07:16,620
the side a little bit we need to move it

170
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:18,479
around folks we are proud to be

171
00:07:16,620 --> 00:07:19,979
sponsored by rim guard Solutions a

172
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:21,539
liquid ballast weight it goes right

173
00:07:19,979 --> 00:07:23,520
inside your tires completely hidden

174
00:07:21,539 --> 00:07:25,139
we're big on safety on this channel

175
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:26,759
these tractors are just too light and

176
00:07:25,139 --> 00:07:28,259
Tippy right out of the factory not only

177
00:07:26,759 --> 00:07:29,580
is it going to help with safety keeping

178
00:07:28,259 --> 00:07:31,979
those rear tires planted on the ground

179
00:07:29,580 --> 00:07:33,599
it helps with loader efficiency and

180
00:07:31,979 --> 00:07:35,580
traction too the benefits of rim guard

181
00:07:33,599 --> 00:07:37,199
include being the heaviest all-natural

182
00:07:35,580 --> 00:07:38,699
liquid ballast weight on the market it's

183
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:40,440
not going to corrode your rims like the

184
00:07:38,699 --> 00:07:42,240
old calcium chloride it's not going to

185
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,860

dealer near you at rimguardsolutions.com

188
00:07:46,979 --> 00:07:51,680
well that just actually fits right down

189
00:07:49,319 --> 00:07:51,680
in there

190
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:13,379
[Applause]

191
00:08:15,780 --> 00:08:18,500
whoa

192
00:08:27,720 --> 00:08:29,900
foreign

193
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:06,800
why doesn't that want to go on there

194
00:09:07,019 --> 00:09:12,549
must be why they give you two

195
00:09:09,370 --> 00:09:12,549
[Applause]

196
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,700
it's a little bit better

197
00:09:19,160 --> 00:09:23,839
I don't think any of these are big

198
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,839
enough though

199
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:36,240
okay this thing it is off right now

200
00:09:33,000 --> 00:09:38,100
oh and it came in listen to this

201
00:09:36,240 --> 00:09:39,540
a little bit of air in there probably

202
00:09:38,100 --> 00:09:40,560
because that's lighter for shipping that

203
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:42,899
way

204
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:45,380
there you go plug this in oh a little

205
00:09:42,899 --> 00:09:45,380
bit closer

206
00:09:47,240 --> 00:09:53,240
got that

207
00:09:49,740 --> 00:09:53,240
get ready you ready Chris

208
00:09:53,399 --> 00:09:55,820
okay

209
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:09,140
it's not that high pitched still have a

210
00:10:07,620 --> 00:10:11,279
conversation in here instead of the

211
00:10:09,140 --> 00:10:12,839
what's going on

212
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,760
that's pretty nice

213
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:17,300
this is louder though than my smaller

214
00:10:14,760 --> 00:10:17,300
one I think

215
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:21,480
one horsepower this is a two horsepower

216
00:10:19,560 --> 00:10:23,279
unit

217
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:25,140
a little bit bigger I think it's like 10

218
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:27,420
decibels louder

219
00:10:25,140 --> 00:10:29,279
but that's pretty quiet I'm assuming you

220
00:10:27,420 --> 00:10:32,700
can still hear me talking right now

221
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:34,760
what happens if I take this out oh

222
00:10:32,700 --> 00:10:34,760
yeah

223
00:10:35,040 --> 00:10:38,959
that is actually louder wow

224
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:42,919
[Music]

225
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:46,579
off

226
00:10:49,019 --> 00:10:53,899
pull

227
00:10:50,760 --> 00:10:53,899
oh it disconnects

228
00:10:55,019 --> 00:10:58,220
and then you pop it out to

229
00:11:00,420 --> 00:11:06,839
crush your regulator safety

230
00:11:04,140 --> 00:11:12,540
see the pressure right now is

231
00:11:06,839 --> 00:11:14,220
oh 40 50 60 65 ish no sorry oh that's

232
00:11:12,540 --> 00:11:16,800
that's a 60 there

233
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,320
30 to 60.

234
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:22,860
so what it divided by

235
00:11:19,320 --> 00:11:28,079
it's an interesting uh Dash sequence

236
00:11:22,860 --> 00:11:29,220
so it goes up six pounds per 36 42 48 54

237
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,440
60.

238
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:33,720
that's natural

239
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:35,880
no anywho that's what that's at

240
00:11:33,720 --> 00:11:37,440
pressure regulator

241
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:40,100
so this is the regulated air pressure

242
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:40,100
this is a tank

243
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:44,160
what you're putting out right here which

244
00:11:42,060 --> 00:11:47,880
we're at

245
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:50,339
about 45 or a little bit over 40.

246
00:11:47,880 --> 00:11:52,320
so you can turn that down

247
00:11:50,339 --> 00:11:53,640
and then once you're using it or I guess

248
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,839
if you had enough pressure to go up

249
00:11:53,640 --> 00:11:57,060
above here

250
00:11:54,839 --> 00:11:58,320
you know this is way up here or maybe

251
00:11:57,060 --> 00:11:59,760
way up here

252
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:01,140
you can still regulate it so it wasn't

253
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,940
too much coming out like if you're using

254
00:12:01,140 --> 00:12:07,279
air tools

255
00:12:02,940 --> 00:12:07,279
that kind of thing on off

256
00:12:21,779 --> 00:12:24,240
foreign

257
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:26,760
so you're going to see this is a pretty

258
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:29,100
easy simple thing to put together we did

259
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:30,839
have some issues with the the Caster

260
00:12:29,100 --> 00:12:32,459
wheel down there at the bottom

261
00:12:30,839 --> 00:12:33,540
on one side I'm going to reach out to

262
00:12:32,459 --> 00:12:35,700
them see if we can get a different one

263
00:12:33,540 --> 00:12:37,440
the other one works just like it should

264
00:12:35,700 --> 00:12:38,880
I

265
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:41,100
I don't think I'm doing anything wrong I

266
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:43,680
probably am but we did have to get I

267
00:12:41,100 --> 00:12:46,320
bought a whole new uh hose kit and

268
00:12:43,680 --> 00:12:48,540
fittings and and just some some basic

269
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:50,040
accessories for now until I get the

270
00:12:48,540 --> 00:12:51,240
Barn's getting finished so I'm going to

271
00:12:50,040 --> 00:12:53,100
get that all set up soon and I think

272
00:12:51,240 --> 00:12:54,600
we'll probably get a few air tools to

273
00:12:53,100 --> 00:12:57,420
keep out there as well but smaller units

274
00:12:54,600 --> 00:12:58,560
I've had for I think three years maybe a

275
00:12:57,420 --> 00:13:00,300
little bit longer and they've been

276
00:12:58,560 --> 00:13:01,560
serving me well and in fact not too long

277
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:03,839
ago the guys at the shop just kind of

278
00:13:01,560 --> 00:13:06,959
pointed out just how quiet that

279
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:08,639
compressor is out there so anyway

280
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:10,680
we'll see as long as they fix that that

281
00:13:08,639 --> 00:13:12,000
wheel down there I'm probably going to

282
00:13:10,680 --> 00:13:13,860
be another satisfied customer I keep

283
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:15,120
coming back to them I bought this one on

284
00:13:13,860 --> 00:13:16,440
Amazon I'll put a link down there you

285
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:18,660
don't have to get the two horsepower

286
00:13:16,440 --> 00:13:20,700
they make a lot smaller ones too but for

287
00:13:18,660 --> 00:13:23,579
me the big selling point with these guys

288
00:13:20,700 --> 00:13:26,639
is is quiet so I I hate the loud

289
00:13:23,579 --> 00:13:27,899
chattery sound and uh this seems to fit

290
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:29,040
the bill so that'll wrap it up for us

291
00:13:27,899 --> 00:13:30,600
today if there's anything else I should

292
00:13:29,040 --> 00:13:32,040
