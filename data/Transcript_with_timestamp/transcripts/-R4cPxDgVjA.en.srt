00:02:04,399 --> 00:02:07,200
podcast brought to you by private

joining us this

17
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:16,160
um tuesday evening i almost forgot

18
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,000
i was about to say thursday evening

19
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:18,800
clearly i'm rushing into quarter two

20
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:21,040
already

21
00:02:18,800 --> 00:02:22,720
but welcome for joining us this tuesday

22
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:25,040
evening today's show

23
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:26,560
is a bit interesting because we get to

24
00:02:25,040 --> 00:02:29,840
speak to someone

25
00:02:26,560 --> 00:02:31,599
who's built their career within the

26
00:02:29,840 --> 00:02:33,760
agricultural sector

27
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:34,959
but doing something slightly different

28
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:37,680
not being a farmer

29
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:38,480
not being a marketer but we are speaking

30
00:02:37,680 --> 00:02:42,080
to

31
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:44,160
an agri-journalist photographer

32
00:02:42,080 --> 00:02:45,680
who's also had an agribusiness within

33
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,239
the agri-valley chain so we're going to

34
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:48,959
get some

35
00:02:46,239 --> 00:02:51,120
insights into the different or

36
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,840
alternative farming methods

37
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:54,720
that are available to ensure that our

38
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:57,120
beautiful

39
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,800
sector that we all dearly love which is

40
00:02:57,120 --> 00:03:01,519
the agricultural sector

41
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,920
remains sustainable for the long term i

42
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,319
think

43
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:05,440
it's important to contributing towards

44
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:08,239
food security

45
00:03:05,440 --> 00:03:08,879
but at the same time being sustainable

46
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:10,560
um

47
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,080
i just want to say that before we

48
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:13,840

96
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:50,080
nitty-gritty miranda

97
00:04:47,680 --> 00:04:52,560
please just give us a short introduction

98
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,240
what you've done in the agri industry

99
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,479
especially with your compost making

100
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:00,720
business etc and what you do

101
00:04:56,479 --> 00:05:00,720
now as an agri journalist etc

102
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:07,280
great question thank you very much um

103
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:10,080
my composting of my agri career actually

104
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:10,800
started as a as a packaging technologist

105
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:14,320
it was a

106
00:05:10,800 --> 00:05:15,280
export table grape company exporting

107
00:05:14,320 --> 00:05:18,960
grapes to

108
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:21,520
to the eu and to europe and beyond and

109
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:23,759
they wanted to convert from conventional

110
00:05:21,520 --> 00:05:26,400
farming to organic farming

111
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:26,400
so the farm

112
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:31,039
and it was very sandy soil so what

113
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:33,520
needed to be done

114
00:05:31,039 --> 00:05:34,800
and especially in organic farming is

115
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:36,720
that you need to build the soil

116
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,280
structure and add organic matter the

117
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:42,400
best way to do that is composting

118
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:45,680
so i was sent on a composting

119
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:48,160
course to austria um and i

120
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:50,400
completed the composting course there

121
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:52,639
and then i started

122
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:54,000
with idli reeling ace we started

123
00:05:52,639 --> 00:05:57,120
reliance compost

124
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:59,520
which is now a national

125
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:00,880
composting company providing organic

126
00:05:59,520 --> 00:06:04,000
compost to quite a few

127
00:06:00,880 --> 00:06:07,680
farms and landscapers and so on

128
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:10,160
so that basically was the base also of

129
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,240
of organic farming and sustainable

130
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:14,319
farming as the compost

131
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:16,479
and then um eventually i actually

132
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:18,080
started writing about composting and

133
00:06:16,479 --> 00:06:21,199
organic farming

134
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:24,319
and that led to a career in in

135
00:06:21,199 --> 00:06:26,479
journalism took me to media 24 to eu

136
00:06:24,319 --> 00:06:29,520
magazine and high school art and then

137
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:31,520
freelancing and event writing

138
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:33,039
agricultural articles on anything

139
00:06:31,520 --> 00:06:36,080
ranging from

140
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:38,240
quinoa farming to goat farming and

141
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:39,600
alternative farming systems in south

142
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:42,240
africa

143
00:06:39,600 --> 00:06:44,479
wow so but what is the what does

144
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:47,280
alternative farming systems mean

145
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,000
are we talking about changing soil and

146
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:51,199
rather farming

147
00:06:48,000 --> 00:06:52,560
and compost or um you know the the new

148
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:54,400
term or kid on the block is

149
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,440
hydroponically etc

150
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:59,199
using growing medium etc um uh

151
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,960
this is regarding into crop production

152
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:02,880
but maybe moving on to livestock

153
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:05,280
what are some of the alternative farming

154
00:07:02,880 --> 00:07:07,120
methods but if you could just explain

155
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,039
that concept broadly so we could

156
00:07:07,120 --> 00:07:11,680
understand

157
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:12,160
i think alternative farming is is

158
00:07:11,680 --> 00:07:15,199
looking

159
00:07:12,160 --> 00:07:18,080
at historical conventional farming

160
00:07:15,199 --> 00:07:20,720
but looking at it from a different angle

161
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:23,680
or farming better or smarter

162
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:26,400
um it can also mean alternative farming

163
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,400
systems such as vertical farming

164
00:07:26,400 --> 00:07:29,680
if you live in high density areas and

165
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:33,440
you don't have land

166
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:36,800
surface that you farm vertically you

167
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:38,199
rooftop farming we see that bee hives

168
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:41,120
are being kept on top of

169
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:44,160
skyscrapers so

170
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:47,360
people farming in water acroponics

171
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:51,199
hydroponics people farming

172
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:54,240
oysters avalone and seawater kelp

173
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:56,479
and then also fresh water farming so

174
00:07:54,240 --> 00:07:58,160
alternative farming is not only looking

175
00:07:56,479 --> 00:08:00,240
at conventional farming

176
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:02,319
and doing it differently in terms of

177
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:03,360
organic but it could also be totally

178
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:06,800
different

179
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:08,479
farming systems you know

180
00:08:06,800 --> 00:08:11,120
what are some of the upsides and

181
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:13,759
downsides of having to explore

182
00:08:11,120 --> 00:08:15,280
alternative farming systems uh you

183
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,520
mentioned for example

184
00:08:15,280 --> 00:08:18,560
uh instead of farming like the old

185
00:08:17,520 --> 00:08:21,120
traditional ways

186
00:08:18,560 --> 00:08:23,120
people can now farm vertically it sounds

187
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,759
very fancy and technical

188
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:26,800
does it come at a high price etc you

189
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:30,319
spoke about

190
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:33,200
bees being kept in skyscrapers um

191
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:33,519
you know what type of infrastructure and

192
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:35,519
uh

193
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,279
investment is required in that and who

194
00:08:35,519 --> 00:08:39,039
looks after the bees at the top of the

195
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,760
skyscrapers you know what i mean

196
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:45,360
so what are what are the pros and cons

197
00:08:41,760 --> 00:08:48,240
of alternative farming systems

198
00:08:45,360 --> 00:08:48,240
um well

199
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:51,760
the reason for alternative farming is

200
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:54,880
that the

201
00:08:51,760 --> 00:08:56,240
old or historical ways of farming is not

202
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,160
working anymore you see that

203
00:08:56,240 --> 00:09:00,240
conventional farmings they need to to

204
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,519
add more chemicals they need to increase

205
00:09:00,240 --> 00:09:04,800
the dosages

206
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:06,720
but also um our export markets are

207
00:09:04,800 --> 00:09:08,959
starting to demand less and less

208
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:11,040
chemical sprays and

209
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:13,279
the standards are very very high in

210
00:09:11,040 --> 00:09:15,360
terms of what for example fruit farmers

211
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,440
are allowed to use and spray

212
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:19,680
on the apples and pears and citrus that

213
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:22,080
goes to international markets

214
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:23,120
so from the one hand there's a demand

215
00:09:22,080 --> 00:09:25,760
from customers

216
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:26,320
to reduce chemical and other input and

217
00:09:25,760 --> 00:09:29,760
also

218
00:09:26,320 --> 00:09:31,519
it becomes costly but also um

219
00:09:29,760 --> 00:09:33,040
we need to look at our resources our

220
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:36,160
waters are water and

221
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:38,000
soils being diminished so from that

222
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,040
point of view we also need to look

223
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:41,920
differently

224
00:09:39,040 --> 00:09:42,560
or look for alternative ways of farming

225
00:09:41,920 --> 00:09:44,640
um

226
00:09:42,560 --> 00:09:46,880
so there's pressure from both sides both

227
00:09:44,640 --> 00:09:49,440
from nature and the resources we have

228
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:51,839
available and then the markets itself

229
00:09:49,440 --> 00:09:53,279
the demands that we look the demand that

230
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:56,720
we look differently to

231
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:59,200
to how we farm um and then also

232
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:00,640
we need to develop new markets we we

233
00:09:59,200 --> 00:10:04,320
want to start farming

234
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:05,279
different products um we need more bees

235
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:08,320
to pollinate

236
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:09,360
uh the more uh almond trees and

237
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:11,360
blueberries that

238
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:12,880
that are being planted in south africa

239
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:17,120
so you find that from

240
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:18,720
one industry another industry grows and

241
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:20,880
you also find that farmers need to

242
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:21,440
diversify even more in terms of the

243
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:24,560
product

244
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:27,360
range that they have available so um i

245
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:30,800
don't know if that answers your question

246
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:31,360
yeah i mean you spoke about from your

247
00:10:30,800 --> 00:10:34,079
answer

248
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,920
you've also just alluded to you know the

249
00:10:34,079 --> 00:10:37,040
reason why alternative farming methods

250
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:39,200
are critical

251
00:10:37,040 --> 00:10:40,399
is that they help us preserve our

252
00:10:39,200 --> 00:10:42,800
natural resources

253
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:44,399
you know um and that being water and

254
00:10:42,800 --> 00:10:47,040
soil which is such a big

255
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:47,839
uh component into the farming industry

256
00:10:47,040 --> 00:10:49,680
and you've i think

257
00:10:47,839 --> 00:10:51,519
mentioned that you've just done a bit of

258
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:54,000
work or research around

259
00:10:51,519 --> 00:10:56,079
water and soil can you share something

260
00:10:54,000 --> 00:10:59,120
something about those two elements

261
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:01,519
for us i think the two

262
00:10:59,120 --> 00:11:02,160
the two is very inter interrelated to

263
00:11:01,519 --> 00:11:04,880
each other

264
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:07,279
um uh the example that i mentioned was

265
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:07,279
the sound

266
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:11,519
that when you put nutrients when you

267
00:11:10,000 --> 00:11:14,000
give nutrients to the plant

268
00:11:11,519 --> 00:11:15,600
and water and if there's not a good soil

269
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:17,920
structure your water will and

270
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:19,839
your nutrients will leach out so what

271
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,680
you need to do and what certainly what

272
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:22,560
what south africa needs to do is build

273
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:25,040
the organic

274
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,200
matter content in the soil what that

275
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:29,519
means basically is adding

276
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:30,399
uh composting in the soil or on top of

277
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:33,600
the soil

278
00:11:30,399 --> 00:11:36,240
mulching that not only helps

279
00:11:33,600 --> 00:11:36,959
with the evaporation of moisture from

280
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:40,000
the soil

281
00:11:36,959 --> 00:11:42,399
it prevents weeds growing in in terms of

282
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:45,040
the mulch that you put on top um

283
00:11:42,399 --> 00:11:46,160
but it also helps to create a soil

284
00:11:45,040 --> 00:11:48,000
structure it

285
00:11:46,160 --> 00:11:49,279
creates aggregates if that's the word i

286
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,720
can use that

287
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:54,000
help to maintain soil in the moisture in

288
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:56,959
the water so

289
00:11:54,000 --> 00:11:58,880
your soil quality and soil structure um

290
00:11:56,959 --> 00:12:02,000
goes hand in hand with the type

291
00:11:58,880 --> 00:12:04,720
and the amount of water that you use um

292
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,279
and then um yes but it determine depends

293
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:07,440
on which

294
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:08,320
soil type you use and also which crop

295
00:12:07,440 --> 00:12:09,920
and how you

296
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:12,000
are you water are you managing your

297
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:12,560
water and what type of irrigation so

298
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:14,560
there's

299
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
many other parameters in terms of water

300
00:12:14,560 --> 00:12:20,720
usage that one can look at to reduce the

301
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,680
amount of water that one uses yeah going

302
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:23,440
back to uh

303
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:25,600
compost melinda because you ran a

304
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:26,399
business uh within the composting and i

305
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:28,320
suppose

306
00:12:26,399 --> 00:12:29,440
some of the key insights that you're

307
00:12:28,320 --> 00:12:32,480
sharing as well

308
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:35,680
um are you know real life

309
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:36,959
or lived experiences within your compost

310
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:38,399
business

311
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:40,000
and you mentioned that you know you sold

312
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,920
the compost to farmers

313
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:43,279
as well as uh private individuals in

314
00:12:41,920 --> 00:12:46,160
their home gardens

315
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,560
um and i'm just thinking yeah i mean as

316
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,480
as a farmer who's just farming uh on

317
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:52,800
fast stretches of land

318
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:55,040
um you know that wants to far more

319
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:57,839
sustainably i'm sure compost

320
00:12:55,040 --> 00:12:59,920
might not work for him or her um you

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:03,040
know unless they tried different

322
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:06,079
methods to preserve soil etc but

323
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:08,560
um do you think for professionals who

324
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:10,720
are farming you know in the backyard

325
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:12,320
gardens or sorry individuals who are

326
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:14,000
growing food systems in their backyard

327
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:16,639
gardens etc how

328
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:17,600
how can they preserve their compost time

329
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:20,079
and time again

330
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:22,079
because sometimes as a farmer myself i

331
00:13:20,079 --> 00:13:24,959
get queries from individuals saying

332
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:26,800
oh my crops died what happened and then

333
00:13:24,959 --> 00:13:29,200
you know they'd send their picture

334
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,639
um or someone would say i just bought a

335
00:13:29,200 --> 00:13:33,680
new house

336
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:34,079
my you know i can never grow anything in

337
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
this

338
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:37,760
in this backyard garden what's wrong

339
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,000
with the soil you know is the soil too

340
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:43,120
red or yellow or whatever the case is

341
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:45,600
and people sometimes need advice so um

342
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:47,360
you know for people then maybe who are

343
00:13:45,600 --> 00:13:49,199
not sure about their soil compositions

344
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:52,720
and want to go into compost

345
00:13:49,199 --> 00:13:55,920
and maybe just do the two or mix the two

346
00:13:52,720 --> 00:13:58,720
in there in their uh private spaces um

347
00:13:55,920 --> 00:13:59,120
how can they preserve compost how can

348
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,120
they

349
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:02,399
ensure that you know they can grow

350
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,240
healthy food

351
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,519
um for that for their for their own

352
00:14:04,240 --> 00:14:10,399
individual or family consumption

353
00:14:07,519 --> 00:14:13,279
sure it's uh it's a lot of questions in

354
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,279
in one um

355
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:18,079
i'll try to try and give you lots of

356
00:14:16,639 --> 00:14:21,760
answers as well

357
00:14:18,079 --> 00:14:24,720
um composting and using compost is just

358
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:25,279
one way of adding organic matter in the

359
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
soil

360
00:14:25,279 --> 00:14:29,279
adding plant matter back into the soil

361
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,760
because you need to feed

362
00:14:29,279 --> 00:14:33,279
the microbes and the soil life that's

363
00:14:31,760 --> 00:14:35,279
inside the soil

364
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:37,279
you don't necessarily only have to use

365
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:39,440
compost you don't have to buy compost if

366
00:14:37,279 --> 00:14:43,519
you don't have it but if you've got

367
00:14:39,440 --> 00:14:45,760
leaves or grass or weeds

368
00:14:43,519 --> 00:14:47,760
you can you can use that all all of

369
00:14:45,760 --> 00:14:49,360
those are organic matter that you can

370
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:52,160
put back in the soil

371
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:54,399
something else in terms of crops dying

372
00:14:52,160 --> 00:14:54,399
and

373
00:14:54,560 --> 00:15:00,000
using companion planting or making use

374
00:14:57,600 --> 00:15:01,199
of a system or method called companion

375
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:03,839
planting

376
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:06,079
is also beneficial companion companion

377
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:06,639
planting means that you plant certain

378
00:15:06,079 --> 00:15:09,040
plants

379
00:15:06,639 --> 00:15:10,320
next to each other the one is the

380
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:13,199
natural repellent

381
00:15:10,320 --> 00:15:13,600
of pests of the other so it means that

382
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:16,880
they

383
00:15:13,600 --> 00:15:20,000
that attract certain um insects that

384
00:15:16,880 --> 00:15:23,199
will that are predators of pests

385
00:15:20,000 --> 00:15:25,120
and it also means some some plants

386
00:15:23,199 --> 00:15:27,040
actually secrete stuff in their roots

387
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:29,279
that actually help

388
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:30,639
manage soil health so companion planting

389
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,639
is planting different

390
00:15:30,639 --> 00:15:33,920
plants together that are beneficial for

391
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:37,279
the other ones growth

392
00:15:33,920 --> 00:15:38,079
or protection so composting is one

393
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:40,720
aspect

394
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:43,279
of of farming or soil health but there's

395
00:15:40,720 --> 00:15:45,040
also other aspects such as using mulch

396
00:15:43,279 --> 00:15:47,279
mulch is a layer of organic matter

397
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:50,560
whether it's old leaves or grass or

398
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:52,720
cuttings or whatever so using that

399
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:54,079
on top of the soil to prevent weed

400
00:15:52,720 --> 00:15:56,079
growth that is

401
00:15:54,079 --> 00:15:58,240
that's another way of preventing

402
00:15:56,079 --> 00:16:01,759
moisture loss and preventing weed for

403
00:15:58,240 --> 00:16:04,480
using a mulch um and then

404
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:06,320
companion planting as i mentioned it

405
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:10,079
also attracts insects that's

406
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:13,279
important to reduce your insecticide

407
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:15,120
um inputs um

408
00:16:13,279 --> 00:16:16,959
what are the other there's so many

409
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:17,519
questions in one but composting you

410
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:19,440
don't need

411
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,279
an encompassing is not always practical

412
00:16:19,440 --> 00:16:25,279
or viable in terms of cost

413
00:16:21,279 --> 00:16:26,480
for usual a huge fines yes on commercial

414
00:16:25,279 --> 00:16:28,720
scale

415
00:16:26,480 --> 00:16:30,079
ah thank you before i move on to the

416
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:32,560
next question i just want to

417
00:16:30,079 --> 00:16:34,240
uh encourage any of you watching at home

418
00:16:32,560 --> 00:16:37,360
this evening we are joined by

419
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:40,480
marinda low who's an agri-journalist

420
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:42,800
slash photographer um and i suppose

421
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:45,839
entrepreneur in the composting space

422
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:47,440
or agripreneur should i say and today

423
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,040
we're talking about alternative farming

424
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:51,199
methods and earlier on if you

425
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:52,480
uh missed uh some critical points that

426
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:55,839
you mentioned is that

427
00:16:52,480 --> 00:16:56,320
um she highlighted a few of uh examples

428
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,040
of what

429
00:16:56,320 --> 00:17:00,480
alternative farming methods are so um if

430
00:16:59,040 --> 00:17:02,720
you missed the first part of

431
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,640
the show you could definitely catch it

432
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:05,439
um on our youtube channel but please

433
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:08,319
comment

434
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:09,439
um ask any questions that you have to

435
00:17:08,319 --> 00:17:11,120
marinda

436
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:13,600
unless you want her to clarify

437
00:17:11,120 --> 00:17:15,280
specifically on farming sustainably

438
00:17:13,600 --> 00:17:18,400
on alternative farming methods

439
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:21,280
conventional farming organic compost

440
00:17:18,400 --> 00:17:21,839
um yeah this show is for you melinda i

441
00:17:21,280 --> 00:17:25,520
just want to

442
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:26,959
find out um uh with your

443
00:17:25,520 --> 00:17:29,440
now i'm just thinking with the farmer's

444
00:17:26,959 --> 00:17:30,799
head yeah with the composting business

445
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:32,880
and for people that are listening to you

446
00:17:30,799 --> 00:17:34,799
and maybe would want to try

447
00:17:32,880 --> 00:17:36,960
being in the composting industry or

448
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:39,679
start their own compost business

449
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:41,760
and you mentioned the word organic in

450
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:45,039
some examples that you explained

451
00:17:41,760 --> 00:17:46,160
is every single compost in the

452
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:49,120
composting business

453
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:50,480
is it is it a hundred percent organic so

454
00:17:49,120 --> 00:17:52,720
when you're going into the business do

455
00:17:50,480 --> 00:17:54,480
you have to be certified organic

456
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:55,840
because i know to be organically

457
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,120
certified requires

458
00:17:55,840 --> 00:18:01,520
some um someone to go through uh

459
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:03,280
what a certification process of some

460
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:05,760
sort

461
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:08,400
i think we need to distinguish between

462
00:18:05,760 --> 00:18:10,160
organic farming and sustainable farming

463
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:13,919
organic farming is

464
00:18:10,160 --> 00:18:15,679
um it's when when you go through a

465
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:18,160
certification process

466
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:19,280
to get a label that you could put in

467
00:18:18,160 --> 00:18:22,400
your product

468
00:18:19,280 --> 00:18:24,880
that gets sold as organic and organic

469
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:26,320
product in a retailer so the retailer

470
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:28,160
might have some standards and there

471
00:18:26,320 --> 00:18:28,799
might be organic body that might have

472
00:18:28,160 --> 00:18:30,559
standards

473
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:32,880
and then your product is certified

474
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:36,000
organic so it's

475
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:39,120
uh to form organically morally

476
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:42,320
to a a certification system um

477
00:18:39,120 --> 00:18:45,919
to farm sustainably is to look after the

478
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:49,120
resources that you put in whether it's

479
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:51,039
looking at the chemical inputs it's not

480
00:18:49,120 --> 00:18:53,440
necessarily an organic that you're not

481
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:55,120
allowed to use sprays or insecticides or

482
00:18:53,440 --> 00:18:56,640
weed killers and so on but it's the

483
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,840
sustainable use

484
00:18:56,640 --> 00:19:01,840
of all your inputs um something else i

485
00:18:59,840 --> 00:19:02,640
just want to mention we we're focusing

486
00:19:01,840 --> 00:19:04,960
on on

487
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:06,160
organic farming and and composting and

488
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:09,360
soil based but

489
00:19:06,160 --> 00:19:09,919
um we alternative farming systems could

490
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:12,960
also

491
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:13,760
involve farming in and with water and

492
00:19:12,960 --> 00:19:16,320
that

493
00:19:13,760 --> 00:19:17,039
that is aquaculture which means your

494
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,679
plant is

495
00:19:17,039 --> 00:19:21,760
is physically in a liquid medium it's

496
00:19:19,679 --> 00:19:25,520
physically hanging in water so

497
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:28,640
the roots are suspended in in the water

498
00:19:25,520 --> 00:19:32,320
um but um and aquaponics is

499
00:19:28,640 --> 00:19:34,559
um aquaculture actually sorry um

500
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:36,080
wrong way other way around is that you

501
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:39,200
you farm

502
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:40,640
um you farm fish or you farm crustacean

503
00:19:39,200 --> 00:19:42,880
or portland or something

504
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:43,919
so it's a it's water animals water

505
00:19:42,880 --> 00:19:46,480
plants that's been

506
00:19:43,919 --> 00:19:47,280
um it's being farmed or often in

507
00:19:46,480 --> 00:19:49,679
combination

508
00:19:47,280 --> 00:19:50,799
with plants so that the nutrient-rich

509
00:19:49,679 --> 00:19:54,000
water of the fish

510
00:19:50,799 --> 00:19:57,120
let's say use that example is then fed

511
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,000
through to herbs and other plants

512
00:19:57,120 --> 00:20:01,760
um which then purify the water and use

513
00:20:00,000 --> 00:20:03,679
the nutrients and then the purified

514
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:06,960
water filtered back to the

515
00:20:03,679 --> 00:20:07,919
animals the the fish so it's a closed

516
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,760
loop system

517
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:11,360
not always closed loop but it's it's a

518
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:14,240
water-based system

519
00:20:11,360 --> 00:20:14,799
so alternative farming systems could

520
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:17,120
intel

521
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:19,679
farming on land but it can also entail

522
00:20:17,120 --> 00:20:22,880
farming within water

523
00:20:19,679 --> 00:20:24,640
wow so moving on to something else i

524
00:20:22,880 --> 00:20:25,200
think maybe could also that could also

525
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:27,039
come

526
00:20:25,200 --> 00:20:28,240
much closer to home for our audience

527
00:20:27,039 --> 00:20:30,880
this evening is that

528
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,080
um also you have like a non-conventional

529
00:20:30,880 --> 00:20:35,360
career right um

530
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:36,320
it's not a traditional um uh line that

531
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:39,200
one would pick up

532
00:20:36,320 --> 00:20:39,679
based on the um the skill set that you

533
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:41,919
have

534
00:20:39,679 --> 00:20:43,600
like photography and you started writing

535
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:46,720
first and then you moved into

536
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:47,039
uh journalism etc what what are some of

537
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:50,240
the

538
00:20:47,039 --> 00:20:51,360
non-farming opportunities that exist in

539
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:54,640
the agricultural

540
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:57,120
sector um you know based on

541
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,159
your experience and looking at you how

542
00:20:57,120 --> 00:21:02,480
your career

543
00:20:58,159 --> 00:21:05,760
has also turned excellent

544
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:07,360
question um in terms of photography uh

545
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:09,919
what is interesting when i was

546
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:12,480
researching uh uh

547
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,760
uh writing articles for south africa dot

548
00:21:12,480 --> 00:21:16,000
co dot ca

549
00:21:13,760 --> 00:21:18,240
uh i wrote about farming and

550
00:21:16,000 --> 00:21:18,799
agricultural commodities in south africa

551
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:21,280
and that was

552
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:23,360
translated into all 11 south african

553
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:26,480
languages it was a huge project

554
00:21:23,360 --> 00:21:28,559
but the absence of good photos

555
00:21:26,480 --> 00:21:30,240
of south african farmers and south

556
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,039
african products and south african

557
00:21:30,240 --> 00:21:34,960
commodities that i realize is also a

558
00:21:33,039 --> 00:21:37,760
huge opportunity that there's

559
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:38,240
not a lot of images available you know

560
00:21:37,760 --> 00:21:42,080
of

561
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:42,799
of um trout cages you know we're trying

562
00:21:42,080 --> 00:21:46,080
to being

563
00:21:42,799 --> 00:21:49,360
bred and things like millet

564
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:52,320
in south africa you know um in terms of

565
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:54,559
non-aggregate cultural opportunities in

566
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:58,640
within the agricultural sector

567
00:21:54,559 --> 00:22:00,960
um sure there's a lot i'm thinking of

568
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:04,480
venues you know a few

569
00:22:00,960 --> 00:22:07,760
wedding venues um training venues um

570
00:22:04,480 --> 00:22:10,880
if you want to train farm workers

571
00:22:07,760 --> 00:22:14,400
um you know

572
00:22:10,880 --> 00:22:16,400
how to prune how to how to trim

573
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:18,400
the hooves of your goats you know that

574
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:20,880
kind of training venues

575
00:22:18,400 --> 00:22:22,640
um i'm thinking of restaurants coffee

576
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:25,520
shops um

577
00:22:22,640 --> 00:22:26,000
farm stores something else that's

578
00:22:25,520 --> 00:22:29,039
probably

579
00:22:26,000 --> 00:22:30,960
non non-farming but definitely related

580
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:32,720
to agricultural commodities is

581
00:22:30,960 --> 00:22:35,200
processing i mean if you've got

582
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:36,799
you tomato farmer and your market is

583
00:22:35,200 --> 00:22:38,480
satisfied with

584
00:22:36,799 --> 00:22:40,000
saturated with tomatoes and you're

585
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:42,880
sitting with tomatoes

586
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:43,600
then preserving those products is a

587
00:22:42,880 --> 00:22:46,799
secondary

588
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:50,880
secondary industry whether you jam it uh

589
00:22:46,799 --> 00:22:53,039
dry it speckle it um

590
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:55,120
you know the you know further processing

591
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:58,480
of agricultural products

592
00:22:55,120 --> 00:23:00,640
um certainly agri-tourism is is

593
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:02,640
huge and i think that that's also in

594
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,280
terms of people wanting to buy property

595
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:05,919
i think that

596
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:08,159
could also be an option to look at is is

597
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:09,919
how can i use this property also not

598
00:23:08,159 --> 00:23:11,840
only to farm but as a

599
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:14,080
destination probably a tourism

600
00:23:11,840 --> 00:23:14,480
destination it could be people wanting

601
00:23:14,080 --> 00:23:16,400
to

602
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:18,880
take part and see what happens on the

603
00:23:16,400 --> 00:23:20,799
working farm but it might also be people

604
00:23:18,880 --> 00:23:23,600
wanting to escape the city and just

605
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:24,320
experience fresh farm air so there's so

606
00:23:23,600 --> 00:23:28,320
many

607
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,559
aspects of of agriculture

608
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:31,360
that that doesn't that doesn't

609
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:35,440
necessarily

610
00:23:31,360 --> 00:23:38,880
involve getting your hands dirty um

611
00:23:35,440 --> 00:23:41,919
yeah but um and and then involving into

612
00:23:38,880 --> 00:23:45,200
into other value-added products and and

613
00:23:41,919 --> 00:23:47,200
and offerings that's related to a farm

614
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:48,400
yeah i like that example that you

615
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:51,440
brought in with

616
00:23:48,400 --> 00:23:52,240
uh your photography that you know you

617
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,360
you found

618
00:23:52,240 --> 00:23:58,400
a gap pretty much um

619
00:23:55,360 --> 00:24:00,080
where you can't just yeah

620
00:23:58,400 --> 00:24:01,600
i can attest to the fact that there

621
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:04,000
aren't so many pictures

622
00:24:01,600 --> 00:24:05,120
of south african farms farmers or

623
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:07,120
farming you know

624
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:08,480
and the ones that you do find online are

625
00:24:07,120 --> 00:24:11,200
always just um

626
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:12,400
mostly repetitive or it's a head holding

627
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:14,720
a cell phone

628
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,400
um or when you're talking about farming

629
00:24:14,720 --> 00:24:17,840
it's just attracting the field

630
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:19,520
but you could see that these

631
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,000
destinations are non

632
00:24:19,520 --> 00:24:22,799
african destinations and also non-south

633
00:24:22,000 --> 00:24:26,080
african

634
00:24:22,799 --> 00:24:27,600
and so um with your photography um

635
00:24:26,080 --> 00:24:30,080
what did that entail were you just

636
00:24:27,600 --> 00:24:31,840
taking photos around different farms

637
00:24:30,080 --> 00:24:33,840
were you traveling and finding very

638
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,640
beautiful destinations that exist within

639
00:24:33,840 --> 00:24:37,360
the sub

640
00:24:34,640 --> 00:24:38,480
uh in south africa uh and taking

641
00:24:37,360 --> 00:24:40,960
pictures of that

642
00:24:38,480 --> 00:24:41,760
so infusing it with a bit of tourism and

643
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:44,159
farming

644
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:47,440
um what type of pictures did you send in

645
00:24:44,159 --> 00:24:50,559
where did they land up

646
00:24:47,440 --> 00:24:52,960
um it's it's interesting what kind of

647
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:54,559
what kind of photos get sold but also

648
00:24:52,960 --> 00:24:56,400
what kind of photos are people

649
00:24:54,559 --> 00:24:57,600
commenting on and what people want to

650
00:24:56,400 --> 00:25:00,799
see is is

651
00:24:57,600 --> 00:25:03,840
for example um uh one's

652
00:25:00,799 --> 00:25:04,799
one series of articles i wrote was how

653
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:06,799
to clip

654
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:07,840
the hooves of your goat and why it's

655
00:25:06,799 --> 00:25:10,480
important to trim

656
00:25:07,840 --> 00:25:11,520
the hooves of a goat but no one no one

657
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,520
understands

658
00:25:11,520 --> 00:25:15,279
not many people understand how important

659
00:25:13,520 --> 00:25:17,120
it is for a goat to have

660
00:25:15,279 --> 00:25:19,840
the hooves regularly clipped because he

661
00:25:17,120 --> 00:25:22,559
needs to it he needs to

662
00:25:19,840 --> 00:25:24,400
walk far and trade very securely to get

663
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:25,279
to where he wants to go it's a climbing

664
00:25:24,400 --> 00:25:29,039
animal

665
00:25:25,279 --> 00:25:32,080
so i took photos of someone trimming

666
00:25:29,039 --> 00:25:33,440
you know cutting step by step of the

667
00:25:32,080 --> 00:25:35,760
hooves of a goat

668
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:36,720
certainly not a glamorous it wasn't a

669
00:25:35,760 --> 00:25:40,000
glamorous day

670
00:25:36,720 --> 00:25:43,120
but it was fantastic um and then another

671
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:45,360
one for example was blueberry farming is

672
00:25:43,120 --> 00:25:46,320
how people how blueberries are grown

673
00:25:45,360 --> 00:25:49,679
that it grows in

674
00:25:46,320 --> 00:25:51,440
in peat it's very it's important uh

675
00:25:49,679 --> 00:25:53,600
if they grow in pots they don't grow in

676
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:55,360
soil and

677
00:25:53,600 --> 00:25:56,960
the nutrient goes through the water and

678
00:25:55,360 --> 00:26:01,200
dripper systems into

679
00:25:56,960 --> 00:26:02,880
into the individual buckets or pots

680
00:26:01,200 --> 00:26:04,240
and then the different varieties how

681
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:07,760
it's been picked um

682
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:10,960
how it's been packaged and also

683
00:26:07,760 --> 00:26:14,400
just being outside eating directly

684
00:26:10,960 --> 00:26:15,520
from from the plant and chatting to

685
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:18,640
people while they're

686
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,760
working it a fantastic experience

687
00:26:18,640 --> 00:26:22,840
so i think there's a there's a we don't

688
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,600
see enough

689
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:28,320
of farmers and real life

690
00:26:25,600 --> 00:26:28,960
farmers and what they do and the good

691
00:26:28,320 --> 00:26:30,880
stories

692
00:26:28,960 --> 00:26:32,799
you know that might be simple stories it

693
00:26:30,880 --> 00:26:35,840
might be spectacular stories but

694
00:26:32,799 --> 00:26:39,120
um the stories of people farming and

695
00:26:35,840 --> 00:26:40,080
um there's so many different ways of

696
00:26:39,120 --> 00:26:41,919
doing things and

697
00:26:40,080 --> 00:26:44,320
alternative ways of doing things and we

698
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:47,440
can learn so much from each other

699
00:26:44,320 --> 00:26:48,400
oh wow i think uh just to sum up our

700
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:50,840
conversation

701
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:52,320
today we spoke about some non-farming

702
00:26:50,840 --> 00:26:54,559
opportunities um

703
00:26:52,320 --> 00:26:55,919
and also earlier on in our conversation

704
00:26:54,559 --> 00:26:58,559
you mentioned um

705
00:26:55,919 --> 00:27:00,000
different or various alternative farming

706
00:26:58,559 --> 00:27:02,480
systems or methods

707
00:27:00,000 --> 00:27:04,159
um for anybody listening this evening

708
00:27:02,480 --> 00:27:06,000
and is also maybe thinking of

709
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:07,520
alternative farming systems

710
00:27:06,000 --> 00:27:10,320
specifically in the south african

711
00:27:07,520 --> 00:27:13,440
context what opportunities

712
00:27:10,320 --> 00:27:15,600
are available for a new entrant wanting

713
00:27:13,440 --> 00:27:17,120
to come into the agriculture industry to

714
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:20,320
specifically farm

715
00:27:17,120 --> 00:27:22,159
what alternative farming systems are

716
00:27:20,320 --> 00:27:25,120
available within the south african

717
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:28,159
context that someone can take

718
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:28,159
take advantage of

719
00:27:29,360 --> 00:27:34,080
sure that's a good question i think if

720
00:27:32,799 --> 00:27:37,360
you're a non-farmer

721
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:38,159
and you need to decide on on you want to

722
00:27:37,360 --> 00:27:39,840
farm

723
00:27:38,159 --> 00:27:42,320
what do you want to farm that will

724
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:43,760
determine what the market wants

725
00:27:42,320 --> 00:27:45,760
you're not going to farm something that

726
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:47,919
you won't get sold so determine

727
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:50,320
determining what the market wants if

728
00:27:47,919 --> 00:27:52,480
there's a huge market for organic apples

729
00:27:50,320 --> 00:27:54,320
and you sitting in an area where there's

730
00:27:52,480 --> 00:27:54,720
organic or you know where it's suitable

731
00:27:54,320 --> 00:27:58,080
for

732
00:27:54,720 --> 00:27:59,120
growing fruit and you've got bridging

733
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,799
capital for five

734
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:02,799
six years until your apples become

735
00:28:00,799 --> 00:28:03,919
viable then then that's something you

736
00:28:02,799 --> 00:28:05,520
need to consider

737
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:07,200
so you look at the environment you look

738
00:28:05,520 --> 00:28:09,039
at your soil type you look at where your

739
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:10,559
farm is situated you also look at what

740
00:28:09,039 --> 00:28:12,880
the market wants

741
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:14,640
um and then that will determine what

742
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:16,000
kind of crop or livestock or what

743
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:18,559
farming system you're going to use

744
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:20,320
if you want to farm cucumbers but the

745
00:28:18,559 --> 00:28:20,799
area is probably not viable then you

746
00:28:20,320 --> 00:28:22,799
need to

747
00:28:20,799 --> 00:28:24,720
think of an alternative farming system

748
00:28:22,799 --> 00:28:26,159
and then think probably on tunnels you

749
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:29,360
know using tunnels

750
00:28:26,159 --> 00:28:30,000
farming cucumbers in tunnels um so i

751
00:28:29,360 --> 00:28:31,679
think

752
00:28:30,000 --> 00:28:33,039
there's a lot of parameters that one

753
00:28:31,679 --> 00:28:35,279
needs to look at when

754
00:28:33,039 --> 00:28:36,960
you when you want to want to enter the

755
00:28:35,279 --> 00:28:38,880
farming but it's certainly you want to

756
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:40,320
form something that you want to sell at

757
00:28:38,880 --> 00:28:41,919
the end of the day and then

758
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:43,760
therefore you need to be close to a

759
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:45,279
market you need to be able to provide

760
00:28:43,760 --> 00:28:47,440
the right product

761
00:28:45,279 --> 00:28:48,399
um to the market but you also need to

762
00:28:47,440 --> 00:28:50,960
look at

763
00:28:48,399 --> 00:28:52,720
your soil type what kind of soil what

764
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,840
kind of quality of water and do you have

765
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:56,080
