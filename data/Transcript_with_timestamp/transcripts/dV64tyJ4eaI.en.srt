1
00:00:09,040 --> 00:00:14,320
okay here's a bit of soil chemistry

2
00:00:11,040 --> 00:00:15,440
so i'm holding this piece of mud that i

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:17,840
just took off

4
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:19,199
from the surface of the soil and it's

5
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:22,080
interesting because you see

6
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:22,880
a brownish layer on top here a thin one

7
00:00:22,080 --> 00:00:25,760
it's about

8
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:27,680
maybe extends about two three

9
00:00:25,760 --> 00:00:29,439
millimeters deep into the salt on top of

10
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,920
that is actually a bit more greenish

11
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:32,800
yeah and then underneath of that we have

12
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:36,079
this dark

13
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,040
gray blackish soil and that's basically

14
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:38,960
what's happened

15
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:40,480
happening in the flooded soil it's what

16
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:42,160
we call a chemical

17
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,160
reaction which is actually driven by

18
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:47,280
microbial processes

19
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:48,239
reducing the the iron compounds from

20
00:00:47,280 --> 00:00:52,160
iron two

21
00:00:48,239 --> 00:00:55,039
iron three oxides and hydroxides

22
00:00:52,160 --> 00:00:56,800
which have a reddish color into iron two

23
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,719
compounds which have a grayish

24
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:00,719
color so what we have up here is

25
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:03,280
basically a layer where the oxygen

26
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:04,080
still comes in from the water that we

27
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:07,680
put on

28
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:10,240
and though that always stays oxidized

29
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:11,280
and underneath that we have this highly

30
00:01:10,240 --> 00:01:14,240
anaerobic

31
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:15,200
reduced soil in which the roots are but

32
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:17,439
this is also

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,280
up here a very biologically active layer

34
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,479
which is why it's greenish on top so

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,119
you've got

36
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:27,840
algae living on top doing nitrogen

37
00:01:23,119 --> 00:01:27,840
fixation and all kinds of things
