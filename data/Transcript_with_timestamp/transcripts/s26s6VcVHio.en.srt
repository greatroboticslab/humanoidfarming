1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,919
you hear the term regenerative practices

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:06,720
a lot and I'll I'll say that's something

3
00:00:03,919 --> 00:00:08,480
that like I'm not sure exists um to me

4
00:00:06,720 --> 00:00:11,599
like regenerative agriculture and

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,960
regeneration in general it's based on

6
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,839
principles and so a regenerative

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:17,480
practice doesn't necessarily exist

8
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:20,119
because there aren't practices that are

9
00:00:17,480 --> 00:00:21,680
re regenerative right regeneration is an

10
00:00:20,119 --> 00:00:23,480
outcome that we're trying to achieve and

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:24,880
so how do we achieve that outcome and

12
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:26,880
there's lots of different ways to do

13
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:30,039
that but it's kind of in the way that

14
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,640
you apply whatever practice it is

15
00:00:30,039 --> 00:00:34,719
because any given practice can achieve a

16
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:37,200
regenerative outcome or it could

17
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:39,960
degenerate the same practice on

18
00:00:37,200 --> 00:00:42,200
different operations in different uh

19
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:44,800
climates in different states different

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:47,000
rainfall areas and so you know I try to

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:49,399
keep that in mind that it's it's it's a

22
00:00:47,000 --> 00:00:51,480
lot I say it's simpler it's more complex

23
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:54,440
than just practices it's it's how do you

24
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:54,440
apply principles
