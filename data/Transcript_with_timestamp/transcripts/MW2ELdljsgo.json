  "text": "[Music] good morning we're actually going to hear Ali bellow I guess as you know here's this tension we used you see this is just always old fits board it always did everything it needed for Elsa kept her in a barrier kept me away now Ali will go in and but Ali gets a little crazy so we're gonna beat this up that way it is ready for her to go buckle out in here because most time we're not we're not putting her in and locking her down we're fixing to start because her stands and training spend to get a little bit longer a little bit more intense because she's getting closer to having a calf so we need to make sure she is ready so we're going to go ahead and put the crossbar in to pull her close to us like we had in the other stanchion also we're going to beat these up a little bit to where once we wrap up and put a chain around them she can't get out of them and then this backboard right here which is just old fence post or a fencing she said oh really one by six we're gonna go ahead and beef up put a 2x4 here and get it real tight on her that way she will be she'll be tough but she can't jump out and break it down like like she could with this little board so I don't think she knows what's in store for me okay so you see I put a bolt in my bolt it on this side just got a simple hook another bolt to this 2x4 now what I'm gonna do is take this 2x4 and use it like it's supposed to be used and basically I'll pull it in with a chain against her rear end I there and that way it keeps her very close to me where she can't move also when dealing with that I'm gonna take this take that to before and brace it right here to where it keeps her tight against me too so that way she's encapsulated with really 2x4 is more than just the look of a stanchion this tension is beefed up up top but I never really beefed it up cuz I never had to but now was like I said with Ali and kind of training her a little bit more and she's a little bit more stubborn and bullheaded I'm gonna just kind of beef it up but so I've got this start as you see got that the end we're gonna go ahead to the other side put the bolt on it over here and then finish up right here and then that way I'm gonna get her in let her let you see me go ahead and do extension training on her and then that way we'll kind of get her prepared okay so I got it done this bar up I did secure it in we put this extra heavier-duty clamp here what we'll do is have this swing this is just hang like this until she gets in once she gets in I just unlatch this you'll drop this chain and then I'll just put this here and let it on right there so it's not gonna be hard we're just gonna see if this will work I'm gonna put her in it and I'm so not stress her out but just kind of leave her in here especially for foods done and see if she can still get out we're trying to get to where she really can't get out well you got that you know the feets tension I've never really had to close it for Elsa I am gonna close it on Ali's head just because the horns I don't want to try to warn me so I've got a chain to go around that too so let's let's see if we can get her in I'll let her do some training let her just eat and kind of calm down and I'm trying to lock her in and see if it makes a difference Hickory I see if we can get her over getting ready to go I'll be a lot more alright so there we go a little bit okay hey there we go alright so you see how we got our tighter they say see how we got her tighter she can't really move so that's how we got the stitching going now we're gonna work on a little stanton training this is how we've been doing Ally and this is how we kind of keep her from from actually I'm trying to keep me so Athens won't go get a towel and also get some apple cider vinegar spray and we'll go ahead and least get a little training done and try to rub on her a little bit you know the main thing is letting her feel like she's comfortable so when the kids are here petting her and we're just talking around her we've ran the pump around her I felt all over but every time she kicks I'll give her a good pop on my hind leg and that teachers are know so she's done really good I mean she really has but you know standing here for five minutes eating that's not locked in so now I'm gonna stand here maybe 30 or 40 minutes locked in with that our calf being the one in milker we'll see how that goes but again training is all part of getting hurt broken in so Amy's gonna get that stuff and we'll go and see if we can spray a little bit show you how we have been breaking her and Sam just gonna work hopefully when she has this Dam all right so this is typically how we mail again she's she's a lot smaller than Elsa now you see she's got her leg behind her I don't know why she's stand like that we have been working with her so I'll grab her like I do Elsa and she'll move her leg back now never seen her like go behind her so that's a new trick so we'll see how she does when I try to feel owner you see that she's not kicking me yet she used to keep me but you are close she does have good feed I don't feed her unless I'm stationed training her so she sees this a treat again apple cider vendor here's what we used to make sure the cow gets covered and cleaned off we want to train her like we were just now moving her so she's kind of see she trying to just come on say Scrabble right there and show using a judge she may do it again cuz she's still trying to work on training you say yeah I'm just trying to just get her used to me to fill in older she's doing goodness she do you never never get comfortable even with the calots you've been training for a while unless you are you're comfortable with her milking for even a year or two as uh Elsa I'm comfortable with but just because she's been milking almost a year I don't want to ever think that that eight eight nine hundred thousand pound cow can I you know hurt me well this one's smaller but she's even more feisty and she's not used to milk and I want to make sure she's comfortable and the last thing I'll do is just trust her I put my head down here and try to get her I try to just trust her that way so we're just gonna do a little bit more training stand here eat let me just kind of mess with her as if I was fish no milker none any bond it's just loosely around her neck so it makes her feel like she's she's there but it's not where she is choking or anything like that you've got plenty of room ally getting petted by Ellie Ellie be careful baby so she's fighting her again she's been training good there's always remember if she decides to try to keep pop it right here now she hadn't done it so it won't pop I won't hurt just know that she's doing a really good job but I'll give her if she does good on my kid girl good job and I just love owner rubber belly and just kind of let her know that I she has done a great job but there's a different command than where she starts to try to kick me or tries to put her leg in front I'll give her a gentle pop here if she doesn't do it then I'll grab back here and then that way she knows I'm trying to teach her that's two commands I do with her now your kill may be different and you may have different ways to train your cow but the main thing is you want to be able to say a command and she knows what you're talking about like I can say two or three commands with with Elsa and she knows I don't like her using the restroom intention and she's learned that I can say and she will not do it until she's done but it's because I've just steady trained her same way if else is not close enough I can grab her just like I'm trying to teach Ali back here just kind of barely touch her and she'll notice step over now with Ali I've got her tight to me so she don't have to worry about trying to step over however what we're trying to do with her is just make sure she can move her leg back so you see how she's standing it's perfect for me that's exactly how I want her to stand with that left leg back just a little bit so that way I can get either at a hand milk or put a pump owner and that way she mean she's doing really good how much do you sense and train you need to have your cow way before she has her baby if she's not used to you she's not gonna be used to estancia she's not gonna be used to you hand milking even even Elsa who was a a milk cow and milked for a long time at a milk barn local milk Marne she still took hurt a long time just to get used to us now she's used to us but still you want to make sure that you have your cow you love with your cap she gets to know y'all just to know you she knows your commands and then that way you know when she's ready to start extension training now say she's getting ready to have a cat well I started extensive training in alle pride about three four months ago halfway through a pregnancy because I want her to get used to it the only time she gets feed and all this good sweet food and all this very pellets is only when she comes in the stanchion there's times you can ask a a you can vouch for me hey that's we would not feed her and all sudden she's walking the stanchion walk right back out well she didn't get any feed that day so we're teaching her this is a treat only when you come in to get milked and when you're good if she starts kicking and she wouldn't abide to the stanchion room we would not keep her in here and she would do we take her feet away and that way she new for the day she messed up and she don't want to do that look at this her real right here she's so big with this calf that she is like poking out on the ribs so I think she's doing good what what do you think I think she's gonna do she might surprise this and they better than I think as long as she's eaten she'll let you do anything you want to so um so it's like she's done great I mean we won't know until all the time gets here but I think the more that we keep working with her the better she's gonna do of course right four months ago I couldn't even touch her here she'd run out of things she has those horns which is one of her big things where she's just she's not natured as much like Elsa which was one of our concerns they also just she don't care what you did to her Ali's a little bit different so training Ali it was very important and see we've already bought a calf halter and we're gonna wrap it around here before she is an eye view of her cow her cab that will also let help her milk come out okay bro we're dealing with her jerseys are notorious for holding back their milk for their calf which is where their cream is so the more they hold back the more cream we won't get so we're gonna put that cap right there in front of her where she knows how important it is to let her let her fool milk down we're not gonna be over fully out like we would Elsa because we won't hurt get good and fed good she is put on some weight for this cash she's not normally this big at all so but she's doing really good I'm very pleased with her um again part of statue training is making making sure you're getting comfortable with a cow but more than that the cow getting comfortable with you she needs to know your commands if a pop right here is what teaches our cows that that's wrong that's what she needs to know if a grabbing her here teaches her that's what we need when we want her leg moved that's what she needs to know if we know aunt is a bad command when she's trying to do things she shouldn't be doing like pulling away from the top here the V then she needs to know but she won't know that if you had trained her over the last few weeks or months cows are not don't know they can be stubborn but they're not dumb so learn to give them treats just like you would a dog or any other animals at the same time make sure you're rewarding them taking care of them and they'll take care of you hope this video is a good old video teaches you have we stench and train our heifers as they get ready to cap and we hope you have good day we hope you're enjoying our content of our Channel all right we say illing happy homesteading [Music]",
