[Music]

3
00:00:08,490 --> 00:00:13,900
you know a lot of buzz in the industry

4
00:00:10,959 --> 00:00:15,670
now is the the weeds that you're not

5
00:00:13,900 --> 00:00:18,970
killing with the herbicides you know

6
00:00:15,670 --> 00:00:20,800
well we really don't have on our farm we

7
00:00:18,970 --> 00:00:23,439
really don't have a lot of problems with

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:28,059
that and I think that can be attributed

9
00:00:23,439 --> 00:00:30,329
to using you know the small grains in

10
00:00:28,059 --> 00:00:32,950
the rotation and keeping it diverse

11
00:00:30,329 --> 00:00:35,170
because of that diversity in your crop

12
00:00:32,950 --> 00:00:37,600
rotation you also have a diversity in

13
00:00:35,170 --> 00:00:39,399
your herbicides that you can choose you

14
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:40,890
know whether your fries or your posts

15
00:00:39,399 --> 00:00:43,539
you know and so you've got multiple

16
00:00:40,890 --> 00:00:46,629
layers there too for weed suppression

17
00:00:43,539 --> 00:00:48,850
right and so it all works together yeah

18
00:00:46,629 --> 00:00:51,069
so I'm assuming you know what you're

19
00:00:48,850 --> 00:00:54,249
making savings on inputs as well

20
00:00:51,069 --> 00:00:55,870
herbicides is that correct yeah and part

21
00:00:54,249 --> 00:00:58,899
of that is just because we don't have

22
00:00:55,870 --> 00:01:01,749
the weed pressure yeah and so we don't

23
00:00:58,899 --> 00:01:04,360
have to go out there more than twice a

24
00:01:01,749 --> 00:01:06,490
year to knock these weeds back and still

25
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:08,950
have escapes you know you know it's

26
00:01:06,490 --> 00:01:11,860
pretty much by placing your pre and then

27
00:01:08,950 --> 00:01:16,810
if you have to do a post your field is

28
00:01:11,860 --> 00:01:18,430
clean got a diverse mix now of radish

29
00:01:16,810 --> 00:01:21,640
bench and lentils you know you've got

30
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:23,620
this natural action from these plants

31
00:01:21,640 --> 00:01:26,020
that are digging deep down breaking up

32
00:01:23,620 --> 00:01:28,480
compaction while still providing those

33
00:01:26,020 --> 00:01:30,370
nutrients in that zone for the next year

34
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:31,660
and those roots for those that next

35
00:01:30,370 --> 00:01:33,940
year's crop does not have to look very

36
00:01:31,660 --> 00:01:35,970
far to find those nutrients that it

37
00:01:33,940 --> 00:01:35,970
needs

38
00:01:36,040 --> 00:01:46,060
