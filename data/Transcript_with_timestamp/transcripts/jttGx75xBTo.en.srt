today Rick Percy with multi-seal you're

15
00:00:34,079 --> 00:00:37,980
looking at a tire right here that has

16
00:00:35,399 --> 00:00:40,250
over 300 holes in it but it's still

17
00:00:37,980 --> 00:00:43,200
holding air how's that even possible

18
00:00:40,250 --> 00:00:46,200

[Music]

21
00:01:01,879 --> 00:01:07,500
pair using multi-seal you need weight

22
00:01:04,820 --> 00:01:09,000
centrifugal force and air pressure and

23
00:01:07,500 --> 00:01:11,220
all we have in this tire is air pressure

24
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:13,320
but you can still hear it seal the tire

25
00:01:11,220 --> 00:01:15,720
hey Rick question for you can a guy like

26
00:01:13,320 --> 00:01:16,920
me sure give this a shot sure all right

27
00:01:15,720 --> 00:01:19,020
I mean it looks like a really good

28
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:22,020
stress relief sure what I got to do just

29
00:01:19,020 --> 00:01:25,500
whack it yep okay right there yep all

30
00:01:22,020 --> 00:01:28,500
right let's see how this goes

31
00:01:25,500 --> 00:01:28,500
foreign

32
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:37,680

33
00:01:42,119 --> 00:01:45,960
boy

34
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:47,100
I'm afraid of busting my knuckles

35
00:01:45,960 --> 00:01:52,200
you gotta whack it hard

36
00:01:47,100 --> 00:01:54,659
[Music]

37
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:56,100
there you go all right was that good

38
00:01:54,659 --> 00:01:58,799
enough that's good okay that's like a

39
00:01:56,100 --> 00:02:00,540
half inch right yep this stuff is only

40
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:02,820
good to is this a three three quarters

41
00:02:00,540 --> 00:02:04,880
yep look so that's uh near the max so

42
00:02:02,820 --> 00:02:08,540
just kind of turn it yep

43
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:08,540
I'll spin it for you

44
00:02:11,640 --> 00:02:16,200
that's it sealed

45
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,819
it's cool that's some good stress relief

46
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:20,060
right there

47
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:22,620
very cool all right Rick so I guess

48
00:02:20,060 --> 00:02:24,180
layman's terms what did we just see

49
00:02:22,620 --> 00:02:26,400
happen here well we had this tire

50
00:02:24,180 --> 00:02:29,700
pre-treated with our product multi-seal

51
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:31,980
Pro HD 2500 and it's a true preventative

52
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:34,200
tire sealant additive that goes in the

53
00:02:31,980 --> 00:02:36,540
tire ahead of time to help prevent flats

54
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:38,400
and what happened was the liquid accent

55
00:02:36,540 --> 00:02:41,220
carrier takes our synthetic fibers to

56
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:42,900
the wound one of them being Kevlar fills

57
00:02:41,220 --> 00:02:44,879
that void immediately almost like a

58
00:02:42,900 --> 00:02:46,019
beaver dam or a blood clot it makes it

59
00:02:44,879 --> 00:02:47,760
permanent repair

60
00:02:46,019 --> 00:02:50,640
within one or two revolutions of the

61
00:02:47,760 --> 00:02:52,200
tire okay so you know I've I've seen I

62
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:53,940
guess like the tire Slime type products

63
00:02:52,200 --> 00:02:55,860
on the shelves before use those I know

64
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,360
that my dealer over in Matawan does not

65
00:02:55,860 --> 00:02:59,760
like to service a tire that has that in

66
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,200
there but your product is different it

67
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:04,019
seems like yes

68
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:04,860
our product has uh all synthetic fibers

69
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,440
in it

70
00:03:04,860 --> 00:03:09,720
we do not contain any glues or adhesives

71
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:11,580
of any type it's all water clean up

72
00:03:09,720 --> 00:03:13,680
water washable one-time application

73
00:03:11,580 --> 00:03:16,680
lasts the life of the tire and we do not

74
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:18,420
contain any organic fibers in there at

75
00:03:16,680 --> 00:03:20,879
all that will break down over time well

76
00:03:18,420 --> 00:03:22,800
so my experience I guess with the other

77
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,300
products though is that it's if you get

78
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:26,540
a leak and you're tired then you're

79
00:03:24,300 --> 00:03:28,739
going to use that and fill it up whereas

80
00:03:26,540 --> 00:03:30,659
multi-seal is meant to be more

81
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:33,480
preventative correct it's a preventative

82
00:03:30,659 --> 00:03:36,300
sealant to be put in ahead of time to

83
00:03:33,480 --> 00:03:38,640
help save the customer farmer trucker

84
00:03:36,300 --> 00:03:40,739
whatever downtime so for me what I'm

85
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,420
looking for is a product that that saves

86
00:03:40,739 --> 00:03:44,819
that annoyance that comes up years ago

87
00:03:42,420 --> 00:03:48,120
Chris was doing a delivery for me

88
00:03:44,819 --> 00:03:49,319
brand new trailer tires nonetheless and

89
00:03:48,120 --> 00:03:50,700
he had a flat on the side of the road

90
00:03:49,319 --> 00:03:52,860
you know we've been out to our other

91
00:03:50,700 --> 00:03:54,120
property you drive a half hour out there

92
00:03:52,860 --> 00:03:56,159
you want to hop on your tractor and get

93
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,780
work done and you see a flat tire right

94
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,840
there we've had them on our Gator you

95
00:03:57,780 --> 00:04:02,519
know the tractors and the trailers all

96
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:04,200
zero turns everything has had flat tires

97
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:06,900
so the point is you don't want to have

98
00:04:04,200 --> 00:04:08,280
that frustration that anger that you

99
00:04:06,900 --> 00:04:09,720
can't get your job done so you get this

100
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:11,580
kind of product installed ahead of time

101
00:04:09,720 --> 00:04:13,319
okay so Rick so I'm looking at this tire

102
00:04:11,580 --> 00:04:15,360
just seeing all these holes and and I

103
00:04:13,319 --> 00:04:17,760
guess just air pressure in general is

104
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,019
kind of on my mind I mean how does this

105
00:04:17,760 --> 00:04:20,880
relate to air pressure and how does that

106
00:04:19,019 --> 00:04:22,320
work it's a great question a multi-seal

107
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:24,419
remains a liquid the entire life of the

108
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:26,280
tire and by doing that It Coats the

109
00:04:24,419 --> 00:04:29,040
inside of the tire like an inner liner

110
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:31,680
it'll minimize air loss by the porosity

111
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,060
the rubber uh bead leaks and valve stem

112
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,800
leaks keep the tire running the correct

113
00:04:33,060 --> 00:04:36,780
air pressure at all times a properly

114
00:04:34,800 --> 00:04:38,460
inflated Tire deflects more objects than

115
00:04:36,780 --> 00:04:40,860
it receives so the tire will perform

116
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:43,440
better like ninja is designed to perform

117
00:04:40,860 --> 00:04:45,240
and they'll get less Flats when a

118
00:04:43,440 --> 00:04:46,560
properly inflated tire so do you have to

119
00:04:45,240 --> 00:04:49,020
worry about this product freezing at all

120
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:52,259
no we've got our product rated at 35 to

121
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:53,460
40 below zero fahrenheit okay not around

122
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:55,380
here at least

123
00:04:53,460 --> 00:04:56,460
okay so a question I had when we first

124
00:04:55,380 --> 00:04:58,380
started talking probably the first

125
00:04:56,460 --> 00:04:59,940
discussion was is this something that I

126
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:02,100
can install myself or do we have to make

127
00:04:59,940 --> 00:05:03,960
a special trip to a tire shop to get it

128
00:05:02,100 --> 00:05:05,940
done no certainly we do have a lot of

129
00:05:03,960 --> 00:05:08,100
tire service providers that are dealers

130
00:05:05,940 --> 00:05:09,500
for us but no an end user consumer can

131
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:11,580
install this it's real easy to install

132
00:05:09,500 --> 00:05:12,780
just right to the valve stem with the

133
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:14,280
different tools that we have provided

134
00:05:12,780 --> 00:05:16,080
for you all right so I think it's time

135
00:05:14,280 --> 00:05:18,120
take us through what we have here I know

136
00:05:16,080 --> 00:05:20,340
you've told me a little bit already but

137
00:05:18,120 --> 00:05:21,540
I want to go through it again so let us

138
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:24,300
know what products are we looking at

139
00:05:21,540 --> 00:05:26,520
sure start out with closest to you is

140
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:28,380
the flat out that will seal up to a half

141
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:31,500
inch puncture okay once again all

142
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:33,900
synthetic fibers water cleanup no glue

143
00:05:31,500 --> 00:05:35,340
no adhesives can be installed right

144
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:37,560
through the bottle right through the

145
00:05:35,340 --> 00:05:39,660
valve cap there's a hose that pops out

146
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:42,960
installation is real easy okay and so

147
00:05:39,660 --> 00:05:44,580
again this retail version includes

148
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:46,440
what you need to hook up to your tire

149
00:05:44,580 --> 00:05:48,060
yes and start it into your tire yes

150
00:05:46,440 --> 00:05:49,680
there's an easy dispensing cap at the

151
00:05:48,060 --> 00:05:51,300
top it pulls straight out because the

152
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:53,639
valve core newer built in there remove

153
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:56,039
the valve core stick the tigon tubing

154
00:05:53,639 --> 00:05:58,500
hosing on your valve stem and squeeze

155
00:05:56,039 --> 00:06:00,419
the amount required for a specific Tire

156
00:05:58,500 --> 00:06:01,979
okay so nothing else required all in one

157
00:06:00,419 --> 00:06:04,620
kit right here and good for something

158
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,680
like a set of boat trailer tires or one

159
00:06:04,620 --> 00:06:09,840
ATV tire okay one ATV tire so and you

160
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:12,060

00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:12,840
guard Channel sponsor thank you but

187
00:07:10,979 --> 00:07:14,880
can it be installed only at the time

188
00:07:12,840 --> 00:07:16,319
does it have to be mixed in with the

189
00:07:14,880 --> 00:07:18,060
water when you're installing it or can

190
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:19,560
you already have liquid ballast in your

191
00:07:18,060 --> 00:07:22,139
tire and installed this after the fact

192
00:07:19,560 --> 00:07:25,080
the answer is yes to both you can okay

193
00:07:22,139 --> 00:07:26,819
mix it right before you install it not

194
00:07:25,080 --> 00:07:28,380
not way ahead of time but immediately

195
00:07:26,819 --> 00:07:30,419
before you install it you can mix it or

196
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:32,280
your tire is out there already has

197
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:34,139
existing ballast in it you move your

198
00:07:32,280 --> 00:07:36,120
valve stream to 12 o'clock install the

199
00:07:34,139 --> 00:07:38,520
product and it'll mix automatically with

200
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:40,979
the product our 3500 is our true

201
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:42,479
industrial heavy duty sealant it'll do

202
00:07:40,979 --> 00:07:45,000
up to an inch and a quarter puncture in

203
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,160
a high ply tire to go over it again the

204
00:07:45,000 --> 00:07:50,520
hydro 1500 will seal up to a half inch

205
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:53,520
puncture the Pro HD 2500 three-quarter

206
00:07:50,520 --> 00:07:55,500
inch puncture and the armor 3500

207
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:57,000
into their quarter puncture all right so

208
00:07:55,500 --> 00:07:58,620
there's really not a whole lot of math

209
00:07:57,000 --> 00:08:00,120
that goes into this because multi-seal

210
00:07:58,620 --> 00:08:01,680
takes care of that for you but let's

211
00:08:00,120 --> 00:08:03,120
take you through some real world

212
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,800
examples here so you can figure out

213
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:06,720
exactly what you need for your tractor

214
00:08:04,800 --> 00:08:08,460
so Rick we went and took a look at that

215
00:08:06,720 --> 00:08:10,500
Summit tractor we have back there we

216
00:08:08,460 --> 00:08:12,720
kind of used that one as the initial

217
00:08:10,500 --> 00:08:13,800
example we have the tire sizes on the

218
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,900
front and the back it's two different

219
00:08:13,800 --> 00:08:18,960
products right we have rim guard and the

220
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:20,580
rear tires so you only use the hydro 15.

221
00:08:18,960 --> 00:08:22,740
this there's no other products that work

222
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,020
with the rim guard or liquid ballast

223
00:08:22,740 --> 00:08:26,639
it's just the hydro 1500 yes and then

224
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:28,319
you have a separate product for the

225
00:08:26,639 --> 00:08:30,599
pneumatic tires up front correct the Pro

226
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:34,200
HD 2500 is from pneumatic tire okay so

227
00:08:30,599 --> 00:08:35,760
we had uh 12-16 and a half tires on the

228
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:37,020
rear of that Summit tractor filled with

229
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:39,060
rim guard

230
00:08:37,020 --> 00:08:40,800
about 30 gallons total of rim guard

231
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:43,560
between the two tires it's a one to ten

232
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:45,600
ratio so we need three gallons of hydro

233
00:08:43,560 --> 00:08:47,279
1500 okay so that takes care of the rear

234
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:49,140
tires three gallons of the hydro 1500

235
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:52,560
the fronts

236
00:08:49,140 --> 00:08:54,839
over the 23 and a half 23. I forgot but

237
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,580
uh the fronts are 23 8 and a half 12

238
00:08:54,839 --> 00:08:59,040
tires and we looked up on the chart

239
00:08:56,580 --> 00:09:02,100
there those take 52 ounces per tire okay

240
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:04,200
so we have a 104 ounces that we need so

241
00:09:02,100 --> 00:09:05,700
a little bit under a gallon yes to take

242
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:07,440
care of the front tires correct and for

243
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,660
that we would use well actually we could

244
00:09:07,440 --> 00:09:11,580
use this right here a gallon of the Pro

245
00:09:09,660 --> 00:09:13,860
HD 2500 right yes we take care of those

246
00:09:11,580 --> 00:09:15,120
two front tires okay all right so that

247
00:09:13,860 --> 00:09:16,800
takes care of the product that we need

248
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:18,420
now tell us about the pump motor Shield

249
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:20,339
makes three different or provides you

250
00:09:18,420 --> 00:09:22,620
three different hand pumps that can be

251
00:09:20,339 --> 00:09:25,200
used in our five gallon pails on all

252
00:09:22,620 --> 00:09:27,000
three of our pumps every full stroke on

253
00:09:25,200 --> 00:09:28,800
the pump is eight ounces so you just go

254
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,420
to your app tell you how many ounces it

255
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:32,399
is divided by eight that's how many

256
00:09:30,420 --> 00:09:34,680
strokes you'd put in each wheel position

257
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:36,720
the one gallon bottle of our product has

258
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,700
a pump available for it for a separate

259
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:40,500
charge but if you already have your five

260
00:09:38,700 --> 00:09:42,120
gallon hand pump on one of our three

261
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,680
products you can literally take this

262
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,660
gallon bottle and pour it in the five

263
00:09:43,680 --> 00:09:47,580
gallon pail and pump out of that it'll

264
00:09:45,660 --> 00:09:49,800
be a lot easier for you multi sale also

265
00:09:47,580 --> 00:09:51,779
can provide you a injection cart pump

266
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:53,880
that's ran off your air system that has

267
00:09:51,779 --> 00:09:55,740
a 15 gallon Hopper with two graduated

268
00:09:53,880 --> 00:09:57,420
cylinders down below that you can

269
00:09:55,740 --> 00:09:59,399
install your product using your air

270
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:01,200
system it makes installation quick for

271
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,240
larger fleets so Rick what can this

272
00:10:01,200 --> 00:10:04,560
product be used in our product can be

273
00:10:03,240 --> 00:10:07,440
used in anything

274
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:09,000
off-road regardless of air pressure size

275
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,040
or weight

276
00:10:09,000 --> 00:10:13,260
over the road three-quarter ton trucks

277
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:15,959
and above multi-seal does not recommend

278
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:19,200
the use of our product in any Passenger

279
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,360
cars or light duty Vehicles due to the

280
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:23,040
TPMS systems okay so basically I can use

281
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:24,420
this for anything here I have in my

282
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:27,540
Homestead besides my truck my

283
00:10:24,420 --> 00:10:29,100
four-wheeler my tractors

284
00:10:27,540 --> 00:10:30,779
my trailers

285
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:33,060
my Zero Turns

286
00:10:30,779 --> 00:10:34,800
all that stuff yes correct very good

287
00:10:33,060 --> 00:10:36,420
okay so we use our calculator really

288
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:38,040
easy to do on the Polaris Ranger you

289
00:10:36,420 --> 00:10:39,300
just measure the height and the width of

290
00:10:38,040 --> 00:10:42,300
the tires and it tells you what you need

291
00:10:39,300 --> 00:10:44,640
so we needed 150 total ounces for the

292
00:10:42,300 --> 00:10:47,120
rear tires and then 126 ounces for the

293
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:51,180
fronts oh man

294
00:10:47,120 --> 00:10:52,380
276 ounces I think however however that

295
00:10:51,180 --> 00:10:53,640
comes out in gallons what is that a

296
00:10:52,380 --> 00:10:54,959
little up two and a half about two and a

297
00:10:53,640 --> 00:10:56,040
half gallons yeah yeah okay so a little

298
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:57,540
over two and a half gallons for this

299
00:10:56,040 --> 00:11:01,019
again that's all pneumatic so we would

300
00:10:57,540 --> 00:11:02,519
use the 2500 or the 3500 in here 2500

301
00:11:01,019 --> 00:11:05,519
2500 is the right application for this

302
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:07,800
okay okay our Kubota M4 71 700

303
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:10,620
horsepower tractor eat about six gallons

304
00:11:07,800 --> 00:11:14,220
per tire of hydroseal of hydroseal so

305
00:11:10,620 --> 00:11:16,740
the 2500 1500 oh sorry yeah there we go

306
00:11:14,220 --> 00:11:19,680
the 1500 here we have rim guard inside

307
00:11:16,740 --> 00:11:23,760
here okay so 1500 goes in these and then

308
00:11:19,680 --> 00:11:26,040
on the fronts the Pro HD 2500 yep 152

309
00:11:23,760 --> 00:11:28,980
ounces per tire yeah 300 ounces total

310
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:30,060
300 ounces there okay so yeah this

311
00:11:28,980 --> 00:11:31,920
starts to add up a little bit when you

312
00:11:30,060 --> 00:11:34,019
get the bigger machines out yeah okay on

313
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:35,760
the 1025 this could be a Kubota BX

314
00:11:34,019 --> 00:11:37,260
anything similar you know they're all

315
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,820
these sub compacts they're all basically

316
00:11:37,260 --> 00:11:41,399
the same size give you an idea at least

317
00:11:38,820 --> 00:11:43,440
so uh we have rim guard and the rears on

318
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:46,200
here one gallon of product per tire yeah

319
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:48,420
two gallons total of the 1500 the hydro

320
00:11:46,200 --> 00:11:50,519
1500 to mix in with that on the fronts

321
00:11:48,420 --> 00:11:52,800
combined it was a half gallon of the

322
00:11:50,519 --> 00:11:54,899
2500 needed so you can get a gallon jug

323
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:56,459
of it and it's got an indefinite shelf

324
00:11:54,899 --> 00:11:57,779
life right correct okay so it's not

325
00:11:56,459 --> 00:11:59,700
going to go bad and keep it on there for

326
00:11:57,779 --> 00:12:01,560
a couple years whatever else okay very

327
00:11:59,700 --> 00:12:02,700
good okay so a trailer this is a

328
00:12:01,560 --> 00:12:05,760
different application anything that's

329
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:06,959
high speed over 45 correct okay is a

330
00:12:05,760 --> 00:12:09,779
different application so you don't need

331
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:12,779
to use as much of the material so one

332
00:12:09,779 --> 00:12:14,459
gallon of the 2500 is going to to take

333
00:12:12,779 --> 00:12:16,500
care of all four of these tires and in

334
00:12:14,459 --> 00:12:18,540
fact this is the same trailer that Chris

335
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:20,040
had that flat tire on years ago I think

336
00:12:18,540 --> 00:12:21,360
I had two other flat tires on here I

337
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:23,480
ended up replacing all four of these

338
00:12:21,360 --> 00:12:25,740
tires down the road just because

339
00:12:23,480 --> 00:12:26,940
but anyway one gallon that's all it

340
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:28,440
takes to take care of all four of these

341
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:30,000
tires pretty cool all right Rick so this

342
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:31,860
has been a lot of fun something I just

343
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:33,779
actually noticed I love it when I can

344
00:12:31,860 --> 00:12:35,880
see this this seal right here made in

345
00:12:33,779 --> 00:12:37,980
the USA that's awesome we try to get as

346
00:12:35,880 --> 00:12:39,720
many made in the USA products on this

347
00:12:37,980 --> 00:12:41,160
channel as we possibly can but what else

348
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:42,899
should we know about multi-seal the
