1
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:10,240
my name is chip east with the alabama

2
00:00:08,080 --> 00:00:12,639
cooperative extension system

3
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:15,599
and today i'll be talking to you about

4
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:18,800
grafting tomatoes

5
00:00:15,599 --> 00:00:21,119
why graft tomatoes there are several

6
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:22,320
reasons to graft tomatoes but my number

7
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:25,039
one reason

8
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:27,119
is to increase the resistance to soil

9
00:00:25,039 --> 00:00:30,240
borne diseases

10
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:33,360
for example grafting a non-disease

11
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:35,440
heirloom onto a hybrid root stock

12
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:37,360
would be an excellent way to increase

13
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:40,480
disease resistance

14
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,879
without grafting crop rotation and

15
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:46,719
choosing a disease-resistant cultivar

16
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,120
could help as well you need to select

17
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:51,360
your root stock seed based on potential

18
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,399
problems

19
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:57,440
such as nematodes and fusion wilt

20
00:00:54,399 --> 00:00:59,600
those could be avoided from grafting but

21
00:00:57,440 --> 00:01:00,960
other diseases such as early blight and

22
00:00:59,600 --> 00:01:04,720
bacterial spot

23
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:07,680
will not you need to select heirloom

24
00:01:04,720 --> 00:01:09,920
varieties based on your market factors

25
00:01:07,680 --> 00:01:10,799
if your heirloom varieties do not make

26
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,479
more money

27
00:01:10,799 --> 00:01:15,280
it may be better to grow a disease

28
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:17,600
resistant hybrid instead

29
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:19,200
and grafting requires a lot of

30
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,560
additional time

31
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:23,840
and you need to take that into

32
00:01:20,560 --> 00:01:25,920
consideration and plan for that

33
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:28,960
you should construct a healing chamber

34
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:31,119
before the grafting process begins

35
00:01:28,960 --> 00:01:33,360
this chamber should hold the humidity at

36
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:35,520
80 to 95 percent

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:38,159
the temperature should be between 70 and

38
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:40,720
80 degrees fahrenheit

39
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,079
we should exclude light and we can set

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:45,920
this up in advance

41
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:48,000
before the grafting process begins

42
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:50,159
the black plastic over this chamber will

43
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,320
exclude light in this example

44
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,640
and it's hard to see but there's water

45
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:56,240
standing in the bottom of this there's

46
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:57,520
plastic with water in it to keep the

47
00:01:56,240 --> 00:01:59,280
humidity high

48
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:03,600
the hard part of this is keeping the

49
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,600
temperature between 70 and 80 degrees

50
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:07,840
sanitation is very important when

51
00:02:06,320 --> 00:02:09,840
grafting

52
00:02:07,840 --> 00:02:11,680
we're grafting to hopefully avoid

53
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:12,319
diseases so we don't want to spread

54
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,120
diseases

55
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:16,319
while we're doing this process a razor

56
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:19,680
blade has

57
00:02:16,319 --> 00:02:21,920
been a good thing to make the cuts with

58
00:02:19,680 --> 00:02:22,800
the only special equipment other than

59
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,840
the

60
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:28,000
healing chamber is these and you can get

61
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,599
silicone grafting clips but there are

62
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,879
other grafting clips available the

63
00:02:29,599 --> 00:02:32,560
pictures i'm going to show are these

64
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:34,239
silicone grafting clips

65
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:36,000
and they come in different sizes

66
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,120
depending on the plant material

67
00:02:36,000 --> 00:02:40,400
which one you would use what time of day

68
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,040
is best for this type

69
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,040
grafting is whenever the water stress is

70
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:48,239
lowest maybe early in the morning

71
00:02:45,040 --> 00:02:50,800
or late in the evening inside

72
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,760
under a shade maybe out of the wind all

73
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,840
those are good

74
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:55,840
examples of places to be when grafting

75
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:59,280
tomatoes

76
00:02:55,840 --> 00:03:02,239
the sign or the desirable temela

77
00:02:59,280 --> 00:03:04,000
is cut at a 45 degree angle the root

78
00:03:02,239 --> 00:03:06,879
stock is cut at a 45

79
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:08,879
degree angle placed together and held

80
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,720
with a grafting clip

81
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:13,120
this is just an example we have it

82
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:16,239
laying down normally the

83
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,360
root stock would just remain in the pot

84
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:23,040
or cell pack and we would hold our

85
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:26,640
razor blade at an angle to make the cut

86
00:03:23,040 --> 00:03:29,040
try to do a 45 degree angle as possible

87
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:30,640
but the stem diameter is the most

88
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:33,440
important thing

89
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,000
the root stock and the sign need to have

90
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,640
the same

91
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:38,239
size stem you would think we could plant

92
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:39,920
the seeds at the same time

93
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:41,840
and they would always be the same size

94
00:03:39,920 --> 00:03:45,440
stem but sometimes

95
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:47,599
this root stock might grow faster

96
00:03:45,440 --> 00:03:49,760
so we might have to plant one of the

97
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:52,480
varieties a week or two early

98
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:52,480
than the other

99
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:58,799
here you can see an example of the sign

100
00:03:56,480 --> 00:04:00,799
held in place to the root stock with the

101
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,239
use of that silicone grafton clip and

102
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:05,120
you can see that

103
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:07,519
a 45 degree angle or as close to it as

104
00:04:05,120 --> 00:04:09,200
possible

105
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:11,200
the newly grafted plants will go

106
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,319
directly into the healing chamber

107
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:16,239
as soon as possible for two to four days

108
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,720
exclude light and give them high

109
00:04:16,239 --> 00:04:19,759
humidity if you have to water water

110
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:22,320
under the bottom

111
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:23,199
do not wet them on top they look pretty

112
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,880
stressed

113
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:27,680
but after a couple of days they start

114
00:04:24,880 --> 00:04:29,600
looking a lot better

115
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:32,800
after two or three days those grafted

116
00:04:29,600 --> 00:04:34,479
plants should start looking a lot better

117
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:37,120
then we start introducing them to a

118
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:38,240
little more light we do this by opening

119
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:40,479
up that

120
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:43,040
healing chamber that would lower the

121
00:04:40,479 --> 00:04:45,199
humidity and give them a little light

122
00:04:43,040 --> 00:04:47,919
and we just open a little more each day

123
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,600
for several days

124
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,840
don't allow the plants to become

125
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,320
stressed but we do want to start

126
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:56,400
preparing them to go into the field

127
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:58,240
we can give them more light but don't

128
00:04:56,400 --> 00:05:00,080
put them in the full sun for several

129
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,240
days

130
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:04,320
after about two weeks the plants would

131
00:05:02,240 --> 00:05:06,880
be ready to go into the field

132
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,560
and do not bury the graft union when you

133
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:10,960
plant them

134
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,919
if you bury the graft union that plant

135
00:05:10,960 --> 00:05:15,840
can

136
00:05:11,919 --> 00:05:18,000
root out above the graft and

137
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:19,520
become infected by these soil borne

138
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:21,440
diseases

139
00:05:19,520 --> 00:05:23,840
one potential problem is the plant

140
00:05:21,440 --> 00:05:25,840
sucker in below the graft union

141
00:05:23,840 --> 00:05:29,520
remove those suckers from below the

142
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:31,919
graft union as soon as you find them

143
00:05:29,520 --> 00:05:34,000
if you have any questions about grafton

144
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:35,840
grafton tomato plants you can contact

145
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:39,840
your local extension office

146
00:05:35,840 --> 00:05:39,840
or you can call me direct

147
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,680
you
