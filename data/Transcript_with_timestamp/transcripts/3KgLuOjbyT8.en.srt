food security and rural development

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:08,960
in collaboration with world university

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:11,280
service of canada

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:13,599
have engaged local farmers in a series

6
00:00:11,280 --> 00:00:16,000
of training workshops on the role of

7
00:00:13,599 --> 00:00:18,480
vegetable grafting in climate smart

8
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:20,400
agriculture strategies

9
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:21,680
according to crop protection officer

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:24,640
johnny smith

11
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:26,880
this intervention will facilitate a more

12
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:29,760
reliable and consistent supply of

13
00:00:26,880 --> 00:00:32,880
produce to the market so the current

14
00:00:29,760 --> 00:00:36,160
grafting training covers a

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,600
theoretical session and it covers a

16
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:40,160
practical session

17
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:42,879
so we have the morning we normally start

18
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:45,600
at nine and we run until one

19
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,200
we start with lectures on

20
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:51,600
the work that has been done locally

21
00:00:49,200 --> 00:00:52,640
on grafting vegetables so we've looked

22
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:54,719
at

23
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:56,480
grafting tomatoes on various root stocks

24
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:58,399
we've grafted sweet peppers on different

25
00:00:56,480 --> 00:01:00,800
root stocks and we've looked at how they

26
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:03,760
perform against biotic stresses and

27
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,519
abiotic stresses so we're going to now

28
00:01:03,760 --> 00:01:06,880
present that information that research

29
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:10,640
to the farmers so that they could see

30
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:13,200
the possibilities that they could

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,920
gain from actually practicing vegetable

32
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:18,159
grafting vegetable grafting helps in

33
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:20,960
reducing losses and the amount of money

34
00:01:18,159 --> 00:01:23,040
spent in managing disease problems

35
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,520
it gives the farmer a better chance at

36
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:27,439
being successful in the enterprise and

37
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:31,439
in overall production

38
00:01:27,439 --> 00:01:34,880
it also promotes less pesticide use what

39
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:36,640
ipm tries to do is to discourage the

40
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,200
immediate normally farmers run to

41
00:01:36,640 --> 00:01:40,640
chemicals immediately first stop so we

42
00:01:39,200 --> 00:01:42,560
tried to put chemicals at the as the

43
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:44,720
last option so vegetable grafting now

44
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:45,600
would be one of your first options

45
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:48,240
so

46
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:51,119
if you have a problem a biotic problem a

47
00:01:48,240 --> 00:01:53,840
bacteria fungus in your soil you can

48
00:01:51,119 --> 00:01:55,200
use this technique to protect your crop

49
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:57,520
okay so if you're not using the

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:02:00,719
technique normally the crop would you'd

51
00:01:57,520 --> 00:02:02,399
lost maybe 50 of your crop actual plants

52
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:04,560
so that means your yield would be

53
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:06,479
decreased and that directly affects food

54
00:02:04,560 --> 00:02:08,319
security because you you have less

55
00:02:06,479 --> 00:02:10,640
coming from your farm the farmer also

56
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,560
has to spend more in terms of management

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:15,200
so he has more pesticide to buy he has

58
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:17,280
to pay workers to apply that pesticide

59
00:02:15,200 --> 00:02:18,480
and you have more and then even after

60
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:20,800
you've done that sometimes you're not

61
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,480
successful in managing that disease so

62
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,879
it costs more and the farmer is

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,440
experiencing losses the crop protection

64
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:29,920
officers indicated that the response

65
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:31,920
from participating farmers have been

66
00:02:29,920 --> 00:02:34,560
very encouraging and they have

67
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:36,959
recommended varieties of vegetables that

68
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:38,720
can be used for grafting

69
00:02:36,959 --> 00:02:40,400
just as impressive

70
00:02:38,720 --> 00:02:43,440
farmers have already been applying the

71
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:45,040
principles that have been taught

72
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,800
from the ministry of agriculture
