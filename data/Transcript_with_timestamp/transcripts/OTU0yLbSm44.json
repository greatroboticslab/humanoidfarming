  "text": "[Music] Nathan dony here with crop King and today we're going to go through and be transplanting Our tomato plants for this upcoming year so last week we went through and we filled all of the buckets with the perite and I've had the irrigation in here running since Friday to a go through and make sure that everything's running the way that it's supposed to it's therefore if I had a selenoid that was going to fail or a line that was going to go through and plug up I'd know that before I had tomato plants in here um then the other thing too is to go through and make sure that we've got that whole meteor profile moist so we go through and Transplant plants into here that they're going to go through and have all the moisture that they need to go through and get their initial route started when we go through and plant we're going to go through and do two plants per bucket and then we go through and we've got our top covers already on top of the bucket so that that gives us an indication where our plants need to go and when we start these plants out we'll take our irrigation stake and it'll go directly into the rock wool to go through and make sure that that rock wo stays moist until those roots have an opportunity to go through and root out into the perite and so then about days 10 or 14 as when we'll come back through and move those irrigation Stakes back out away from the plants into the holes in the top covers where they're supposed to be so here we've got half of our top covers so this goes through and shows us where our plants are going to go so we make our little Dibbles here we' go through transplant the plant into there then we've got our other half of our top cover that goes through and sits in the bucket and then our plants would be here so we would take our two irrigation stakes and that would go directly into the rock wall so again these would go through and stay here for the first 10 to 14 days and then after the plants rooted out we'd go through and we move these Stakes into here where they'd go through and stay for their duration the time that we have the crop in the greenhouse so typically when we go through and we transplant the tomatoes they're going to go through and be in their full sheet 98 counts 1 and 1/2 in x 1 and 1/2 in Cubes but due to needing to get the greenhouse cleaned up and some different things fixed we knew that we were going to go through and have these plants a basically a week late transplanting them so what we did is we went through and we moved them up into these grow smart trays so it's a rigid plastic tray that goes through and has 78 holes and then I went through and we spaced them out into every other hole to go through and basically end up with 39 plants in that same 10x 20 footprint just to go through and give these plants a little bit of additional space so they didn't become overcrowded end up shading the growing points and causing them to stretch if you knew you were going to be late and it was going to go through and be 2 or 3 weeks before you were going to go through and get those transplanted you can go through and shift up into the 3X3 grow Cube so basically what this does is you take that plant and you go through and you stick it into this hole here make sure this cube is wet it'll go through and root out into this Cube giving you a couple more weeks of growth before you need to go through and get that plant transplanted into the bucket so a grower might decide that they want to go into these blocks if they know that the weather's coming in and it's going to be you know highs of 5\u00b0 and they don't want to go through and heat a 5 10,000 ft Greenhouse to go through and take care of plants that are this size to go through and occupy that space to go through and buy them a couple more weeks wait for a little bit warmer weather they can go through and heat a smaller space but give those plants enough space that they need to go through so they don't go through and [Music] stretch [Music]",
