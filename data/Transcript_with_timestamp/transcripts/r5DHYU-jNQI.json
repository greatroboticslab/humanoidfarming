  "text": "[Music] I'm saman Amira farming here in Weldon West Otago with my wife Penny and three children and we're farming 565 hectare shaking beef property we're looking at a wandering block here we were wondering Frisian Bulls on Fatih beat and I just looked at the way we're grazing them really so that's what we're here for today with the one to the waders we really have to carry some feed through from the summer into the winter to be able to to get through and you know product great and kale and winter brassicas are a good good option just to carry some quality right through and especially for to beat with cattle we're taking some good quality feed that they can grow right through into October on so it's been a real winner yeah Palmer Hawk catchment project was started up about three years ago and it's basically a group of farmers all farmers sheep and beef dairy in forestry and everybody all got together and decided that we needed to improve the polymer Hakka River because it was labeled by the taga Regional Council was the West River and Otago so we thought well that's not really good enough so we got together and thought how we're gonna go about improving it so we decided the best way was to see what the problem was with a lot of water testing and here so the group started off tasting a lot of trouble trees all the trouble trees the main river as well and saw where the problem was and found out that it wasn't actually just a diri problem and it was pretty much catchment wide so and that was when we started doing some on-farm water testing and here maybe being a shape and be far more thorough it's not my problem but when we started testing on this place we found out that yeah there was water quality issues here might be different to the dairy industry beware it was more sediment and phosphorous but so that's why we've needed to focus a bit more on winter crops because that seems to be a Wikus length with women we've got the best of oil what we're doing is changing the way we graze paddocks making sure we don't let anything anywhere near any water ways and when grazing paddocks from the top down so that we can you know stop the sediment ending up in the waterways so grazing down the hill from top to bottom where around what we're doing is when the stock loosening up any soil and there's a rainfall event the sediment will come down the hill through the break where it's been eaten through the crop and then there'll be a grass buffer before the waterway or the drain or the critical source area but so the oval cinnamon will get trapped before it gets under the waterway so that's the that's the crux of the grazing management with the last breakers you're coming into the wrapping up grazing the paddock with your mob um you want to have a good buffer zone of grass on a flat area probably least 2 to 3 meters and on a steep area maybe anything up to 20 meters and so the further back you go the better but if your grazing late last that last break an enjoy day preferably or a dry couple of days so that there's no seiderman loss that's going to end up in the waterway here when we're grazing the paddocks you know top to bottom now we're seeing it when we're coming down the hill worm there's a rainfall event the sediments actually flying through the crop that's been grazed under the leaft area that hasn't been grazed and it stops there it's not even getting into the grassed area so that's showing us that it really does work yes I think it's something that every farmer should have docked initially especially with cattle that's a no-brainer just to do straightaway that there's you know real gains to be made with stopping that scene when there's a lot of storm has been shown to be moving with cattle grazing on when the crops with it all that beer soil we're really vulnerable in the winter so yeah you've just got to get on and do it it's it's just stopping that sediment right where it's where it started rather than waiting for it to come downstream that's been reasonably easy it's just a change of mine see it really where you're grazing them and you've got something else to think about you're not just thinking about water troughs or we put them on the only easiest gauge udders to get to it's a matter of you know thinking about it a year in advance and planning making sure you've got water in the right place and maybe putting up a couple of extra electric fences to make sure that you've can do it properly [Music]",
