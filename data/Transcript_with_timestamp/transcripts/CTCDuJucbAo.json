  "text": "wind breaks and shelterbelts have many benefits traditionally shelterbelts have been established for stocked shelter during extreme weather following the 2015 primary fire we heard from our land holders and farmers have shelter up to native vegetation impacted on fire behavior and wind patterns across the odd late rains and lower mid north on the day of the fire here we we decided to stay and defend the home probably right up to the house so since the fire we've actually started to to regen and replant I had a look around them and and really started to study the trees that actually survived and then I asked the question why did they survive and everything else didn't but I'd really like you oughta ask questions it's designed around shelterbelts but a lot of your plantings may be for shade for making you feel better for your gardens for reefs or or natural bush so just ask today we're going to discuss the most important issues about shelter belt planting and in reality that's good planning and think about your property as a whole and what do you want to achieve into the future shelter belts have many benefits they can provide biodiversity they can provide fantastic bird habitat they can Harbor insects that will attack the pests in your crops you'll get higher wall growths from sheltered sheep dairy cows have definitely shown an increase in milk production if they're not so cold crops will increase near the shelter belts and you decrease the evaporation across the paddock the shelter belts decrease the wind speeds and therefore your erosion reduces total votes should be placed at right angles to the prevailing winds make sure that you don't have too many gaps you can get wind tunneling you can get increase velocities so if you can't place a gate at the end of a windbreak you may need to redesign the ends of those wind breaks to decrease that impact of the tunneling wind if you have a solid wall of trees it acts like a brick wall the wind will hit it go up over the top and cause turbulence on the other side so that becomes a bigger problem than what you had before you had the trees if you're going to have a very simple shelter belt you need to be permeable or the wind needs to go through it so that decreases the speed of the wind and less turbulence all the way through the composition of a shoulder belt should include small shrubs on the outside rows slowly building up to the largest tree row in the center five rows wide the species that you would be planting usually local species that have the right form for the position in the shelter belt it could be you clipped or a sea oak and a various perm abilities but in general the outside rows and a closely planted bushy shrubs this one's a KC pendulum and I got about 15 trees that I specifically went in God if you can't use local species you can't get enough height look for a plant that will do the job but won't become a weed the dry land tea tree or the Melaleuca prevented fire in and around our farm and our farm buildings and another in another location at least a year Allah hair do you need to look at ripping your land starting your week control and ordering your plants ripping means that you can get good subsoil moisture and a lot of root development once you've planted your trees you need to make sure that you have air pockets taken out of that rip line so that's why it's important to have a year ahead in this region and the agricultural areas of South Australia it's really beneficial to plant before the break of the season in April or autumn the reason is that the soil still warm and you can water before the break and those trees will get roots into the ground and get established before it gets too cold to grow that means that when it starts to dry out in the following summer they're less needy of water and so the planting and this planting was the first planting after the fire winning on irrigation in about February last year plants came from the Barossa Bush gardens and so the prosperous garden supplied all of the plants from here shelterbelts are a big investment on a property but there are wonderful compromise for planting they provide so many benefits for the property the habitat for animals and birds and reptiles it's well worth looking at putting in shelterbelts you'll be better off in your bank balance and the environment will be better off in the long run in 2016 and 2017 land holders were given free native plants tree guards and stakes to help rebuild native vegetation across the fire scar okay Chris what was your aim was it to get height through here yeah I'm trying to get a bit of height in here particularly with like with this sort of that's a commercial interest we have a red gum type quite a tall tree quite a big bit of structure coming off the edges and there's a mix between that and the saya she act that I've got here and a pendulum which is a nice sort of taller tree here what I'm really just trying to get that sort of structure in there in the actual windbreak and help that develop and using your Melaleuca as a really good wind barrier which you saw was successful in the fire yeah interfering the flow to fire certainly the Melaleuca that once it rubs up formed a quite a nice break in other areas so we're pretty keen to sort of see that clunk and come back in hopefully we never see another Pinery but we just want to make sure that if we are planning and planting trees we're planning and planning for the next potential event if you would like to learn more about shelterbelts natural resources adlai Mount Lofty ranges greeny Australia and their barossa Busch Gardens are great sources of information and support for more information about how we can support you
