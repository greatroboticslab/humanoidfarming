  "text": "[Music] [Music] [Music] hi I'm Mark H with the Alabama Cooperative Extension system and with me today is Chad Norris director of the Tennessee Valley research and Extension Center here in Limestone County Alabama Chad tell we have worked with uh harvesting water for irrigation for several years on the station uh what's the concept of harvesting water for irrigation here in the Tennessee Valley Mark as you know most of the Iration systems pull from streams it's extremely difficult to obtain well water although there are some wells but the majority of them pull from streams so there's a tremendous Demand on these small streams during drought times when we really need the irrigation water so the idea came about here at the center 18 years ago for us to have a water harvesting and storage project so what we do we have limestone Creek a leg of limestone Creek that runs through the center so if you're in high water water times which is typically November through March stream is in full pool there's a lot of water and it's running down to the Tennessee River at that time we'll pump water from Limestone creb into a reservoir that we have that contains 140 acre feet and we'll fill that Reservoir and then strictly use that stored water for our irrigation needs during the growing season so it gives you water in wet times to use in dry times what type farming operation might this fit with Chad it fits well with us of course we uh B small LR compared to through larger Growers uh I see some instances where Mak some Growers of some specialty crops which would be smaller Acres perhaps could utilize this type of system and I also understand there's some towns municipalities that have considered using this type of stor water system for backup Water Supplies perhaps those typ thank you chip appreciate your information on harvesting water for all of our irrigation videos and other AD videos visit our website on YouTube here's the address for that website thank you for watching our video today if we can help you please let us know",
