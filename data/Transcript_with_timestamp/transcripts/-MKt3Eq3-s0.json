  "text": "okay so here we are at bradley nook farm this is run by jay and katya and we're going to go talk to them because there's a very special story about this farm and it's very heartwarming and i can't wait to meet them let's go so jay this is your farm here it is yes how long you been you guys been here for um well i i was more or less born here and it's like about the third day after i was born i i came here with my parents and well they started farming so you've been here your whole life basically yes yes amazing so this was a dairy it was a dairy yeah yeah yeah yeah everything was manual very hard work so you've been basically been a farmer or involved with farming your entire life and well that's that's what happens when you're born on a farm base you know it's hard to escape yeah so um and i noticed in the area like there's a lot of farming in this in this area yes yeah yeah that's sort of dairy farming and in fact like 50 years ago practically every house in the area yeah was a small farm of some kind so your entire environment your family life like past on your heritage it's all farming oh yeah everything's fine everything's farming yeah yeah when when you've got a family dairy farm it's so time-consuming uh needs so much energy and commitment it's what you do you don't have time for hobbies or you know you get up in the morning you start looking after the cows and by the time you finished at night you're just too knackered to do anything basically a lot of farmers they live and breathe this stuff and it's oh yes definitely yeah it's a way of life you know it is it is a way of life it's not it's more than a lifestyle it's an all-encompassing wow and that's what makes it so difficult for farmers to contemplate change yeah it's not like another industry where you like go to work somewhere else you could go anywhere to go to work yeah it is a very distinct way of life so far as to say to a farmer and say like you've got to change this whole facility right now and stop farming animals like that would be a daunting concept like that they wouldn't even something that would even cross their mind no no it would seem impossible yeah you've got to have a very good um you know like offer or incentive for people to change yeah all right let's go to a different um part of the farm and we'll talk about um we'll start talking about your change could call it like a awakening kind of thing wasn't it um yeah sort of but but um you know i think the rocks set in for me when i i learned transcendental meditation about 30 years ago i really it would be 40 years ago now and everybody connected with that was vegan or vegetarian yeah even back then and so um i found it difficult to look after the animals and then sit down and eat them basically which is what you know that was what you were expected to do that was the way things were um so i became vegetarian then and um so when the when we approached the vegan society i was good and ready to take the next step wow but it was how to do it on the farm and i really wanted to produce food on the farm i didn't want to sort of sell it and walk away and say okay i've had enough of this i can't do it anymore we want to provide a some kind of template or example that you can do something different you can feed people yeah but you don't have to have fields full of animals and animals going to the slaughterhouse or animals having calves every year yeah um permanently pregnant basically and you just don't need to do it in order to feed the the world's population and in order in order to live the farming lifestyle that is truly hard and true to your tradition you have to that's it you you feel responsible for the farm you know it's um some obviously you enjoy being in the the countryside who wouldn't yeah um and let's face it we need farmers yeah we need farmers but we don't necessarily need the no the animals the stuff that goes with it that's 30 years worth of crap you can see the where two cows used to live and they've got the water bowl in front of them we had probably 80 80 milk cows tied up in there okay to be milked every day and so in the winter you'd get up get your wheelbarrow clean the manure from behind the cows and then the day starts yeah so back back then with the um because being a dairy you wouldn't have any sex semen back then did you have to send any of the calves away um yes the the most of the male calves yeah had to go to it was a regular like friday run to derby uh cattle market to to take the calves to market so and back then the male cast would be sent for beef or growing for veal um you know i don't know i presume they went for beef yeah but um i was ours were not extreme dairy breeds so possibly they they went for beef and i think um probably holsteins or more extreme dairy breeds probably go for veal i'd say yeah a lot of them are they actually kill them on the farm yeah england yeah no we never did that no i see over here we've got some some little friends over here yeah yeah yes 17 friends this is what they for the winter wow and um they eat on average 10 of those a week wow even the few that we've got so um and how many have you got 17. you've got 17 here so only a small amount of animals oh yes comparably to like oh yeah a large scale yes yes and that just shows the environmental impact of keeping livestock yeah because ours are not producing anything no they eat ten of these a week just to live just and if you were fattening them for beef you'd have to supplement that with grains barley or something or if they were milking obviously they'd have enormous energy demands and eating what they call dairy concentrates which which contain micronized protein stuff from all over the world in particular soya which is very damaging yeah and and of course cereals that people could eat of course yeah yeah a lot of people think that because uh like they see the cows on the grass and they don't ever supplement their diets yeah yeah no that's only part of it um yeah there are there are people making grass-fed and beef and away milk but um they're still harvesting a lot of grass so the environmental cost of just producing food through animals is just it's just magnifying all of the resources it just doesn't make sense anymore with the the growing world population and the climate crisis and the loss of habitat uh agriculture is responsible for and when you look around on the countryside it's just it all is this flattened grass exactly yeah yeah people think that's just normal that's just normal no it isn't it's um i mean that's panda hello panda you look like a panda hello darling so so you said you started to make the connection you went you went vegetarian and you still had uh cattle on your farm that you were having to yeah yeah can you explain that what that felt like making the connection to the animals and still having to do what you had to do kind of thing you in two minds or torn a little bit or well i was very torn because i mean you look after somebody like this and or panda panda should have been a beef a beef animal and you sort of look after them and i mean look into their eyes you can see there's somebody in there and then you have to put them in a trailer and take them to the abattoir it's just it's um like it must feel like because you're kind of their only carer they've never known that it's like a sense of betrayal it is a sense of betrayal you feel you like sending somebody you know to be murdered basically in terrifying circumstances we used to go to a you know big abattoir in shropshire and like at the front it's all like glossy like a supermarket and you go around the back where the farmers take the animals and there's pens where you put the animals and and you know you can smell the smells from the slaughter process coming out the back and you can tell that they you know as soon as they you can tell they've got a pretty pretty good idea what's coming for yeah and you can feel the stress in there you know the whole it's like a nightmare place to go and um you can see you've seen the images of cows trying to escape the slaughterhouse yeah yeah yeah i never saw that i never saw inside yeah it was not something i had an ambition to do so as farmers even though they're connected to the animals on the farm do you think they have a level of disconnect from the slaughterhouse process like um yes you couldn't do it otherwise but i couldn't do it so i obviously knew there was a different way it had to be a different way a different way yeah you didn't have to didn't have to put yourself to it let alone the animals just the act of putting them in the trailer it must completely freak them out well it does because they were wondering where they're going and then when they get there so you've got names for all these yes yes yeah yeah panda and blue badger hole in the head yeah we treat them like individuals yeah but we have to realize that they're cattle yeah and they have different instincts and different ways of reacting to the behaviors yeah so how long have you has it been since you have been operating as a normal you know beef farmer it could be four years now i think it's four years um since the vegan society visited and um yeah we sat around the kitchen table and and they said well there's something else you can do on your farm apart from keeping animals and that's when we decided yeah that's what we've been looking for that's what we want to do yeah so phil was pretty crazy like thinking that you know like going back to that mindset where you're in before and then now that now you don't even have to worry about taking them to this corner no no it's just it's it's incredible you can't believe what a a revelation and a a life-changing experience it was not to have to do that anymore and to know that um well people animals like panda won't have to go through what what they used to have to go through but as i say i was in the same position of as other farmers up till then i didn't know what else i could do yeah and um yeah that would be interesting to talk about like what would be like let's just say there's farmer out there that kind of felt feels the same way they're kind of in two minds and they feel like there's no other way like what would you say like to someone like that that we're at that place in time where you were at um well just take stock of what you're doing you know real think think about what effect you're having on the animals what effect you're having on the planet and yourself and realize that you don't have to do this you can do something else you could grow vegetables like we hoped to still not started um you could turn your farm into a sanctuary um or you could grow trees go into forestry do what you know just you've got this farm most people own the farm i know some people rent the farm so it's a lot more difficult for them um but you know the land is there you can do whatever you want with it yeah so what have you chosen to do here um well we we we've been delayed by covid the same as everybody else but we should have been producing vegetables this spring yeah and that's the overall plan that a small area of the farm will produce as much food as all the animals used to um yeah we'll grow vegan organic vegetables which need no animal inputs whatsoever amazing that's crazy like to think like this is 17 cows what they're eating like what an intensive dairy in canada needs to feed them oh yeah yeah it's it's just unfathomable like um yeah it's one thing that um i mean that will be different that i've been sort of wandering around this huge site for years on my own since my dad died and hopefully in a couple of years time there might be 12 20 people employed here okay so that will be a massive boost for local employment yeah and you know really useful jobs as well you know yeah yeah definitely fulfilling jobs definitely yeah yeah that's that's something that you see farmers saying a lot that that you know that this movement of plant-based eating it's just like attacking their their livelihood and um like if new markets open up and you know there's more plant-based foods available that food needs to be grown and produced and you know it's got to come from somewhere well if more people um give up meat and dairy the market will force people to produce food differently it'll decide what the farmers move into yeah and it will provide an opportunity the opportunity will be there the market will be there yeah and it'll be stupid to do anything else yeah well it would make life on the planet possible in the future we've got to do it and it would be a better world without slaughterhouses that's for sure definitely yeah absolutely so this is like a little portable so it's almost like it looks like a truck container it does yeah yeah it used to be a milk delivery truck well so well that's even better so this was a dairy milk delivery truck we've got a cheese kettle that um we heat the oats and the water and the other ingredients okay sort of extract the products from the oats yeah it is a mini mini uh factory really yeah wow see how crazy is that you can make a little mini oat drink factory in the back backyard of your farm there that's it you don't even you don't even need a suitable building you can convert something like this and literally drop it off the back of a truck and next day could be in business and no animals um being you know chained up and on a milking machine in the milking club absolutely no no no carvings no calves being taken away that's it it's the only ethical way yeah that's it wants you to if you want to put something on your cereal in the morning then your coffee yeah it doesn't need to come out of a cow no it doesn't need to go through all that no that process exactly don't have to impregnate the cow all that yeah because the milk is coming from a cow that's been pregnant don't forget that part now this just seems like such a insane way to get a beverage to put on top of your cereal very yeah it's such a such a sweat isn't it basically all unnecessary and better if if people didn't do it really yeah yeah this is the way forward it is and it's all assert everything every ingredient is certified organic so it's it's not just animal free it's the highest possible production standards amazing well i came to the farm because jay said i want to get out of farming but the idea then of course was renewable energy wow okay you are also very much bound by what your land is capable of producing yeah growing up if the farmers in wales say i can't grow avocados that's true but you know other things are possible and not everybody has to produce food you know we need timber you know we need we need carbon capture you know other other things are possible but they will need a lot of support also from this new uh hopefully from the new government subsidies scheme and that that might actually open a few doors for people to get out of life stuck into doing something different with the land yeah no definitely there's there's always different alternatives not just food i mean if you can't grow something there's there's like like you put a trucking container at the back here [Music] it doesn't matter if they've got some in front of them already there's always something better i think the two oh here comes rosie rosie we're rolling the hay [Music] they got is it got protein in that that oh yeah yeah it has got protein where the cows get their protein from yeah well they're all vegans don't don't tell anybody so who's got the most interesting personality out of all the cows [Music] some of them are cheeky here comes uh this one's called hole in there yes that one's cheeky yeah it's a bit cheeky so a lot of the cows have gone to sanctuaries we send we send around 60 to hillside animal sanctuary in norfolk who took them all and that was amazing especially satisfying because they could all stay with their calves or the cows i think when you change you've got to accept that what you did previously wasn't a good thing yeah i think that's a big hurdle for people that you know you've got to say you think about all those hundreds of animals who went to the slaughterhouse or you think of all that the imported protein maize soya whatever that that you were responsible for being grown on what used to be grassland or forest and which is now intensive cropland until you start really thinking about it it's just what you do and they talk about farming being a close-knit community it is because farmers talk farming amongst farmers and and nobody else has a clue what it's about or you can't relate to other people i mean i always say that um farmers interact with animals more than more than uh you know your average vegan activist does you know and so they know they know more than me how much of a personality these animals have so like i try to sort of ask them to like you know you know you know more than me like how much these animals are individuals and they want to because you've got years of um living with them literally living with them and you recognize that families have different personalities and you can say oh yes she's just like her mother wow yeah so they pass on their their attributes absolutely yes so how do you think that um someone could be so connected to animals but still eat them i think it's this thing tradition isn't it an expectation and um like community it's the people define themselves as oh i i like my meat i like my cheese it's who i am one thing um referring back to your question uh you know if farmers care so much for the animals i can part of the answer is that farmers care for the animals to the point where they will retreat when it comes to the slaughter and you will hear anecdotes and people will say oh i love the animals but when they get slaughtered you know i just have to clear out i can't be around yeah so i guess like a lot of farmers will just put them on the truck and then that'll be it like i know some some driving to this look like smallholders will drive them to the slaughterhouse yeah yeah but uh some some will just lead them onto the truck and that's it and then forget that we're back to back to the new bed yeah yeah put it tuck it away in the back of their mind and most people are safely removed from the physical reality of it they know it happens but they they don't like to think about it they like to buy the little packet of something with something with a silly name like steak or veal that doesn't actually refer to an animal it's kind of a product you're going to go to the supermarket you buy a little tray of yeah it doesn't say this was rosie no no rosie went to the slaughterhouse and didn't want to die this is a piece of british raised red grass-fed uh steak it's detached from the individual isn't it yeah yeah yeah so what we're what we sort of think is well you can get your protein you can get your carbohydrate you can get your vitamins and minerals you don't have to feed all that stuff to a cow first then kill the cow yeah yeah why bother it's it's just all bad what a silly thing to do why not just eat the stuff in the first place yeah it's hazel's like the best seat oh it turns definitely yeah like i just push it it's got the best cushioning it's very good here you go i'll be your personal servant okay so this is uh this is the product here this is this is what you produced in the amazing little facility out the back look at that looks beautiful and it's in this traditional glass bottle here returnable and this so you guys are doing this actually you guys are actually producers for uh like an operation called refarmed yeah yeah refarmed and and what their goal is is to turn animal-based farmers into oat drink producers yeah yeah wow oh look look at that it reminds me of like a creamy like like porridge well i guess it's because of oats but it is super creamy it does yeah it's really good so this is all this is just just very very simple ingredients in here now you've got it in the bottle here like and it's been a long sort of progression from you know where you come from to here but um you haven't been alone in this you've had helpers so who's helped you along the way to get you to where you guys to where you are now um well first of all the vegan society and then they kind of offshoot the vegan organic network okay who um who are promoting animal-free agriculture wow in in all its forms and laterally reformed and that's the whole idea of refarmed isn't it yeah it's to provide a real solid genuine alternative that real people can do wow to change their lives and change the way we react the way we interact with the planet as whole amazing so it's all good well you have to say that refund only found us because of the help we had from the vegan society of the vegan organic network amazing because obviously there was a lot of media exposure and that's how they knew about us if you ever return hopefully we can offer you some vegan organic vegetables amazing that would be that would be like veganic vegetables veganic farming is there is a way forward isn't it absolutely so they don't need any animal inputs or anything like that no no no no manure um nothing at all amazing yeah well they said that they say it can't be done but it can be done and it will be done yes the the trick is um the knowledge is out there but on a very small scale in many places um it just needs upscaling upscaling and when you get the message out there hopefully uh people just have a change of heart or there's a massive change in demand and everyone's gonna you know a lot of people might need something to fall back on and look oat drink is where it's at and yeah and for farmers don't say oh dear somebody's trying to put me out of business say somebody's offering me a new business something exciting different something that that enables a future for everybody yeah for generations to come i think we finished the that of well unless there's anything that you guys would want to add support hillside animal sanctuary yes yes amazing hillside animal sanctuary we're going to leave those everyone that we mentioned we're going to leave down below especially hillside as well if you want to support the animals that have gone from this previous farm to the sanctuary and quite a few other farms and quite a few other farms as well so thank you hillside thank you refarmed thank you vegan society and the organic the vegan organic network so what an amazing story hey what an amazing place a story of like personal revolution of like awakening of someone making the connection of like um moving forwards into the future with more ethical farming better for the environment and just seeing those animals in there and they've got another chance now and all the other animals that got taken to the sanctuary is just a beautiful story and the oat milk is fantastic the oat drink is fantastic and it's just a really positive story and i hope this inspires some other farmers out there who are they might be at a crossroads i don't like taking the animals to the slaughterhouse well there's another way and this is the future really plant-based food is the future so [Music] amazing you",
