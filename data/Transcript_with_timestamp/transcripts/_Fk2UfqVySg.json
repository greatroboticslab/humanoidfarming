  "text": "foreign [Music] hi welcome to another episode on this Frosty morning we're already on year four of pruning my apple trees my three apple trees now there's a few things I want to mention before we get going because these videos do tend to be fairly long one is you don't have to watch the other three episodes or parts necessarily it's just that there's more examples there plus you get to see the natural progression over the years which is pretty fun or if you want like I said more examples then they're there for you I'll put them up in the cards here second is it's going to be pruned to all of my trees are going to be pruned to a modified central leader now I have a video separately for that as well put it up in the cards and I just go into much more detail if I had to include that here the video would just be far too long and number three if you mess up if you feel like you made a wrong cut or whatever don't worry too much about that it's a good thing about trees and shrubs and things is that they're alive and they keep growing so you can always correct your mistake next year as long as you don't completely butcher it to death then you know have it die on you as long as that doesn't happen I think you'll be okay so that said let's get to the first three all right so this is the first tree that I'm gonna be pruning and you can start at one of two places either you start in your main scaffold where you start at your top scaffold I'm not too concerned with the top scaffold I mean I have to select out some branches but overall I don't have to reduce a height or anything I'm pretty happy with it so I'm going to start with the main scaffold because that is just way too many branches here I've definitely got to simplify this down quite a bit I also like to try and keep my bottom branch and the topmost branch which in this case I would consider it to be this one just so that there's plenty of space in between each branch in the middle there you get the only other consideration is that with the lowest Branch you want to make sure that you have plenty of trunk you don't want it to be like all the way on the bottom maybe like a third of the way up or something that should be good so that spot right there is actually quite nice so this right here is my topmost branch which is fine there's nothing really wrong with it this one however is not as great I just don't like this weird vertical Branch coming up so quickly after it starts going because ideally you have it kind of come out like a 45 degree angle and then slowly kind of arch up which this one isn't really doing that either kind of comes out kind of weird and then it kind of goes down a little bit which a lot of my branch on the street do that but overall it just doesn't look as good there's also this weird Jordan Branch coming out so I might as well just prune that off first because it's sticking your right in your eye and then I'm going to prune this off that Crow really wants to be heard he'd like to ideally have a branch space or Bud space in between each branch and what I mean by that is essentially just either if the if there was a bud right here and it wasn't a branch I'd like to have that in between the next Branch down below or above it so if I remove this one then I'd achieve that goal because I know be this space in between these two main branches that I'm keeping so start with that when you're pruning you want to leave a bit of your branch collar which is where the branch thickens don't damage that leaving the branch collar will allow it to heal over better so I'm going to break my own rule pretty early on already I'm gonna make an exception for this one because I quite like it the only thing I'm going to take off is the part right here that's rubbing up against the house and leave this vertical one since it's at the tip I don't mind it on the next set of branches I already pruned a branch off over here you can just see the little the little swelling the branch collar right here so that's good there's already space in between this one and that one here there's only one thing I want to change on this Branch here so let me show you that this Branch it's got this fairly weird Fork thing going on I don't particularly like that I want it to be focusing its growth on the upper portion so I'm just going to remove this lower portion and that's pretty much all I'm going to do to that again leave a little Branch the bench collar there just like so and that'll do it for that Branch see the guy up there it's been there for hours I think he's here to stay it has been several hours now because there were just far too many interruptions but it looks like it's died down a little bit so uh let's keep going back here is a branch node that I or a branch that I removed last year but the note is still there so there's a good spacing in between these two branches here but as you can already tell these two branches are directly competing and so one of them has to go I'd like to keep my lowest Branch it's flowing out fairly decently so I'm just gonna go with this Branch here uh that'll also free up this little area in the middle here as well so let's just remove that now leaving that Branch caller intact like that there's only a couple things left to do so the first thing is you can see that this branch is really long way too long in fact it's also kind of a fork I guess because you got another one coming off here this Branch this branch is fine curls up quite nicely well with this one I just wanna bend it over so it effectively comes out straight from the trunk and I also want to prune it back because it is so long to a breath to a bud at least but in this case it looks like it's a little fruit bud that grows more upright so I can start start to curve up kind of like what's happened here but it just happened too far down and it also ended up drooping quite a bit so I'm just going to tie it up for this time around so first thing pruning it to this butt here a fruit spur it's not a vegetative bud so there goes the next two cuts are just to bring it back in a little bit more and also just to kind of remove weird branches because you look at this one so bizarre but it has a branch that kind of grows up it's vegetative which is good like the fact that this is a fruit Bud means it's not going to start curving up as as much but we'll see what happens with that but this one is vegetative so I'm just going to remove this lower weird branch all the way back to that one there and then the other one has a weird Fork coming out if you remember a lot if you've watched last year's video I removed several of these another one formed so I'm just going to remove this one as well and it'll end up in a fruit Bud which is not ideal I'd rather have this be a vegetative bud but for now this will do coming in on an angle there and snip it off so that's looking much more manageable now the next thing I'm going to do is just remove kind of what I did down below but just leave essentially a Branch note or butt space in between so like I'm going to remove this one is this is the top right here so I'm going to remove that one to give the one back there space I'm going to remove this one to give this one up here space because these are all fruit buds I'm not really worried about leaving those so I'm just going to leave those where they're at that Branch caller the next one I will just remove this one as well because I have plenty of branches down below if I ever need to replace it so that's looking a lot better I am very pleased with that before we move on there's a fruit Bud down below here but there's a branch that comes out right here that's trying to compete with the main leader I don't want that so I'm just going to remove that branch and try not to damage the fruit bud that's right beside it which is actually a separate Branch so see if I can do this without damaging up fruit Bud beside it all right there we go free Bud's still intact that looks a lot better with the next treat there really isn't that much that I've got to do as far as the lower scaffold goes because it's pretty much all done in previous years like for instance this Branch here was removed last year and then these two branches now have plenty of space there's a butt over here so this one has plenty of space same thing with this one and then there's a fruit bud I'm just gonna let that do its thing so nothing too crazy honestly in the main scaffold the only thing I want to do is just pruning back this long squiggly part it's just way too long honestly I would like to remove it even further than what I'm going to but for now I'm just going to prune it back probably to this fruit butt over here and we have a lot of other options I thought about going back to this one because this is also fruit bud so I will lose a couple fruit buds but that's okay I'm gonna prune it back to here for now so here we go that really just leaves the top scaffold here and as you can see there's a lot of branches so one of the first things that I like to do is just identify which branches you like the most for instance for me this Branch here I really like it competes with the top which is that Branch there that leader that's the leader there so getting branch that compete with it will help keep it small or manageable I suppose same thing with this one I like that one a lot as well and then the one in the back it comes out a little weird which I don't like but of all the branches this one is a pretty good one as well and they all go their own Direction I also really like this one but um I'm probably gonna have to remove it unfortunately because you can see it's either this one or that one and I like them both so that way you got to make choices the top scaffolds all that's left and I'm going to first remove fairly obvious branches that I know I want to remove so for instance I have this branch that is essentially the same as this one but this one is just far stronger and I like it a lot better so I'm just going to remove that one small one leave the little Branch collar there that can come off so that leaves space for this larger one here and then I'm going to remove this small one here because I don't need that either like so which leaves space for this one back here the next is that fairly major Branch here leave the branch collar intact and snip now the other one I want to do is this one here it's a vegetative branch so I'm just gonna open that off and I'll leave this one for now I'll leave uh this one and that one it's not really hurting anything so those branches can stay all right so the last thing on the agenda for this tree is to Simply remove the height a little bit on it because it's it's fairly tall a little bit too tall even for me and this branch in particular kept getting caught underneath the garage door here so I'd really like to reduce that so let's start with that now I'm going to remove them or prune them down to these fruit buds here so first take it out of that that means it probably won't get too much taller than what they are but it's all right and on here I kind of want to keep them fairly equal so I've got a bud just right there which means I'm essentially pruning off last year's growth and the whole Branch here is loaded with fruit buds so that's kind of nice just like that I'm gonna prune it back to that one there I don't mind this being still the tallest and then lastly this one doesn't look like it has fruit buds on it until quite a bit lower down um I mean I kind of want to remove at least a tip of it so bring it down to the same Heights maybe down to there just a tip mostly all right so it's the next day now yesterday I was just doing the interruptions between the kids playing it ended up riding for a while and then there was also landscapers out there with leaf blowers and things like that just making way too much noise so I had to count it yesterday but we're gonna go back out there and finish up that last tree all right so there it is it is raining currently looks like it's picking up a little bit actually we should still be fine to finish it up but we probably shouldn't dildo too long all right so as far as the lower scaffold there really isn't a whole lot that I would change the only thing that I did do is to the branch that I like is I tied it up so that it comes up a little bit more and it doesn't stick out so much I may end up removing this vertical Branch here maybe both not sure yet but yeah that's really the only thing I would do to it the other Branch I like as well the only thing I don't like is how there isn't a butt space or Branch note in between these two branches that's a little unfortunate but there isn't much I can do about it yet I don't really have a lot of options so maybe a future years when some of these develop I would change that out and there's a lot of fruit buds on here so I just kind of want to leave that this year yeah like I said next year that might change so you're looking at the main scaffold right now the top scaffold to be exact and this right here that's my leader which I like this one beside it I also like but then you notice I kind of want to remove this one right because you want to keep a space in between every single Branch or butt space Branch note in between every single branch but this one also happens to be essentially the same as this one here however this one has fruit buds all over it and um it's just a better more developed Branch than this one is obviously this one is a lot smaller so this one is definitely going to be removed in favor of that one so let's start with that let's come in leaving our Branch collar like so and then the one below it it's not bad probably leave it the one that I don't like however is this main one it has a lot of fruit buds you can see it has fruit buds all over it it's kind of unfortunate but as you can also see there is not really a lot of space these branches are extremely close together which I don't really want so I'm going to remove this one here gave you a little bit of a better view of it but yeah as you can see it's way too close together it doesn't make sense to keep them both I was going back and forth between keeping this one or that one but I just really like the way that this Branch arches as compared to this one this one is kind of weird and wonky you can't quite see it it's just out of frame but it doesn't flow as well so I'm just going to remove that leaving a branch collar again now the next one you can see quite clear clearly already is that these two branches are essentially growing the exact same way which means you just want to ideally pick one or the other so I'm just gonna pick this one here I like that one better so I'm just going to remove that right at the branch collar again there are a lot of branches that are growing left as you can see here all these Branch are growing left and that's really one of the reasons why I was trying to hold on to this one here just because it's one of the few that was going right so hopefully in future something will develop I do have this small little Branch here that may end up becoming that Branch I also like this one here that's coming towards you but I really just don't need these two here so I'm going to remove those two in favor of this larger one here turn that off prune the one beside it so really the last thing that I would like to do this tree I should just reduce the height a little bit now this to take this branch is an example this branch is two years old uh the first year grew up to about here and then the second year it grew the remaining of that Branch there so all these buds over here that you see are fruit buds so this was two years ago this was first Year's growth and then the last little big group last year I'm essentially just going to remove last year's growth so if I take this Branch as a guide go to remove this to right above that first food butt there and then I'm gonna prune the other ones to be kind of similar to that size so prune that one off to a favorable node there same thing with one beside it it's gonna take the tip off just like so so and that will do it all right so I'm happy with that and this next growing season we'll see what develops and see if I can maybe get a branch growing that way somewhere that'd be nice to kind of fill it out although I guess that main scaffold branch is actually filling that space pretty well right now but that'll be something that I'm going to look for next year we'll get there when we get there I feel like all these other buds in here they're fine most of these are fruit buds there are some vegetative ones I may end up removing that you can certainly if you want to so anyway with that said thank you all for watching and I'll see you in the next one foreign",
