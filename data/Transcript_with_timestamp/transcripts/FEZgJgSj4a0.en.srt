11
00:00:36,420 --> 00:00:40,620
conservation agriculture has three

12
00:00:39,420 --> 00:00:45,719
principles

13
00:00:40,620 --> 00:00:49,860
one talk of a minimum soil disturbance

14
00:00:45,719 --> 00:00:52,020
second principle maximum soil cover

15
00:00:49,860 --> 00:00:54,480
and then the third principle crop

16
00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:57,239
rotation whereas the conventional

17
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:58,800
agriculture you just use the normal ways

18
00:00:57,239 --> 00:01:00,899
of large tillage conservation

19
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:05,000
agriculture we advocate for it so that

20
00:01:00,899 --> 00:01:08,760
we can minimize the costs of production

21
00:01:05,000 --> 00:01:12,840
improve water retention and also you

22
00:01:08,760 --> 00:01:15,780
have better yields the k-step crawl is
