1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:07,980
should I walk run really fast like they

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:09,780
do in the old time yes yes we planted

3
00:00:07,980 --> 00:00:12,150
this in 2013 it's a Gravenstein apples

4
00:00:09,780 --> 00:00:15,020
and it desperately needs pruning let's

5
00:00:12,150 --> 00:00:30,410
see what you can do in one minute

6
00:00:15,020 --> 00:00:30,410
[Music]

7
00:00:33,450 --> 00:00:37,939
[Music]

8
00:00:42,710 --> 00:00:58,369
[Music]

9
00:00:59,010 --> 00:01:10,320
I think that may have been the 45-second

10
00:01:05,909 --> 00:01:12,090
foe but it's okay can you tell us I can

11
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,430
tell you why I did what I did okay

12
00:01:12,090 --> 00:01:18,300
because I only had 60 seconds that's why

13
00:01:14,430 --> 00:01:20,850
I did what I did okay so just for the

14
00:01:18,300 --> 00:01:22,290
quick and dirty you know we hadn't this

15
00:01:20,850 --> 00:01:24,240
Scot was getting what you called leggy

16
00:01:22,290 --> 00:01:26,550
it was getting too long the branches the

17
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,259
fruit can break the branch right so what

18
00:01:26,550 --> 00:01:29,610
essentially what did you do what I guess

19
00:01:28,259 --> 00:01:31,380
I took out all the branches that were

20
00:01:29,610 --> 00:01:33,450
really low that may be when you mow and

21
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:35,940
drive a tractor and I took all the

22
00:01:33,450 --> 00:01:37,610
branches going straight up and the ones

23
00:01:35,940 --> 00:01:39,990
that are going way out too far because

24
00:01:37,610 --> 00:01:42,390
this branch is way too long for its

25
00:01:39,990 --> 00:01:45,869
thickness okay so what I did is I found

26
00:01:42,390 --> 00:01:47,899
a side branch here that and I left the

27
00:01:45,869 --> 00:01:52,830
tip you always live to terminal bud oh

28
00:01:47,899 --> 00:01:54,869
and I left the tip there and that will

29
00:01:52,830 --> 00:01:56,970
become where the new branch goes out but

30
00:01:54,869 --> 00:01:58,770
it's not near as long it was so long

31
00:01:56,970 --> 00:02:00,690
that it was going to bend down like this

32
00:01:58,770 --> 00:02:02,009
when the fruit came on yeah and bent out

33
00:02:00,690 --> 00:02:05,039
of shape and then it would stop

34
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,679
producing as well and for the top what I

35
00:02:05,039 --> 00:02:10,410
did it was about six feet taller yeah

36
00:02:07,679 --> 00:02:13,380
and so what I did is I took I found a

37
00:02:10,410 --> 00:02:14,670
branch that we could Bend like this so

38
00:02:13,380 --> 00:02:17,190
there's still one more thing needs to be

39
00:02:14,670 --> 00:02:20,160
done here okay I'm gonna put a stake up

40
00:02:17,190 --> 00:02:22,080
here Oh like you're gonna put a stake

41
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,450
here yeah and you're gonna take this

42
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:25,980
branch and you're gonna tie it with a

43
00:02:24,450 --> 00:02:28,620
piece of bamboo like this and this is

44
00:02:25,980 --> 00:02:30,390
the new top oh so it has a top and

45
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:32,520
because the top still has a terminal bud

46
00:02:30,390 --> 00:02:34,230
that I didn't cut back yeah it would

47
00:02:32,520 --> 00:02:37,380
gives a message to all the other bud

48
00:02:34,230 --> 00:02:39,420
other branches to grow out and produce

49
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:41,099
fruit if I would have cut that off yeah

50
00:02:39,420 --> 00:02:42,629
whenever you cut a terminal bud off a

51
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:44,910
branch it puts out a bunch of side

52
00:02:42,629 --> 00:02:47,580
branches below that and we didn't want

53
00:02:44,910 --> 00:02:49,920
more branches so I made sure I didn't

54
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:52,739
just cut it off like here I cut it off

55
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:55,260
to a branch that we could tie up with a

56
00:02:52,739 --> 00:02:56,550
terminal bud and that's gonna be your

57
00:02:55,260 --> 00:02:58,530
new top and you've got to remember to

58
00:02:56,550 --> 00:03:01,410
put a little bamboo stake right up there

59
00:02:58,530 --> 00:03:04,379
and now your trees about five foot

60
00:03:01,410 --> 00:03:06,209
shorter and it has the branches going

61
00:03:04,379 --> 00:03:08,099
where they want okay is that something

62
00:03:06,209 --> 00:03:10,469
that we would never trim off later then

63
00:03:08,099 --> 00:03:12,329
that will always stay there no what's

64
00:03:10,469 --> 00:03:12,840
going to happen is this is going to grow

65
00:03:12,329 --> 00:03:15,120
way

66
00:03:12,840 --> 00:03:16,709
yeah and eventually it's gonna get way

67
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:18,870
taller than you want and you're gonna do

68
00:03:16,709 --> 00:03:20,730
the same thing so imagine now instead of

69
00:03:18,870 --> 00:03:23,099
standing on the ground I've climbed up a

70
00:03:20,730 --> 00:03:25,560
ladder and this it's like 10 years from

71
00:03:23,099 --> 00:03:26,400
now and I'm like about safe five six

72
00:03:25,560 --> 00:03:28,110
feet off the ground

73
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:30,300
and I'm up at the top of the tree it

74
00:03:28,110 --> 00:03:32,700
it's really tall like that I'm gonna

75
00:03:30,300 --> 00:03:34,890
look for a new branch like this one

76
00:03:32,700 --> 00:03:37,500
right here and I'm gonna cut everything

77
00:03:34,890 --> 00:03:38,880
off above there and this thing new one's

78
00:03:37,500 --> 00:03:41,280
going to become the top but I'm not

79
00:03:38,880 --> 00:03:43,739
going to tip it back I'm gonna let it

80
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:45,330
stay and it'll become the new top and

81
00:03:43,739 --> 00:03:48,209
that's what you always keep doing it on

82
00:03:45,330 --> 00:03:50,970
your trees you make them shorter but you

83
00:03:48,209 --> 00:03:54,180
always keep a top by finding a less

84
00:03:50,970 --> 00:03:58,530
vigorous branch that's going upwards and

85
00:03:54,180 --> 00:04:00,630
that's well usually like in the winter

86
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:02,730
and stuff we could probably could have

87
00:04:00,630 --> 00:04:04,319
found a branch that was going up enough

88
00:04:02,730 --> 00:04:07,380
we wouldn't a need even to stay give it

89
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:09,630
okay it's kind of kind of a rule of

90
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,730
thumb and you're thinning your fruit and

91
00:04:09,630 --> 00:04:14,280
it's a good time to do it what you want

92
00:04:11,730 --> 00:04:15,810
to do is put your hand out and wherever

93
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:17,579
your thumb is and your your little

94
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,519
finger that's about how far the fruit

95
00:04:17,579 --> 00:04:23,190
should be apart so you can do that now

96
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:25,289
in just a second the other door so take

97
00:04:23,190 --> 00:04:26,669
these two off well you can leave one

98
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:27,660
about here what about here is fine

99
00:04:26,669 --> 00:04:29,400
that's enough

100
00:04:27,660 --> 00:04:31,500
usually they're in a cluster of like

101
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:33,300
five you picked the just one of them to

102
00:04:31,500 --> 00:04:35,010
keep out of the cluster so you go

103
00:04:33,300 --> 00:04:37,410
through your orchard and about this time

104
00:04:35,010 --> 00:04:40,169
of year when the fruit is roughly the

105
00:04:37,410 --> 00:04:42,840
size of a Super Bowl yeah and you start

106
00:04:40,169 --> 00:04:44,039
pulling that off mm-hmm and you can you

107
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:59,880
can pull it or you can use a little

108
00:04:44,039 --> 00:05:06,389
pruners and turn it off but here is it

109
00:04:59,880 --> 00:05:08,610
so pretty much you got a figure about 35

110
00:05:06,389 --> 00:05:10,889
leaves can support one fruit in general

111
00:05:08,610 --> 00:05:12,360
give you an idea but if you don't want

112
00:05:10,889 --> 00:05:14,669
to count leaves you could use the rule

113
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:18,060
of thumb I really enjoyed editing this

114
00:05:14,669 --> 00:05:20,250
video and kind of just kind of was a

115
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:23,280
reminder of what a wonderful time we had

116
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:25,710
with with Sam and James from rain tree

117
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,610
nursery that came out and helped us with

118
00:05:25,710 --> 00:05:28,199
us orchard

119
00:05:26,610 --> 00:05:30,960
or with our orchard I think this video

120
00:05:28,199 --> 00:05:32,939
is really important because it it really

121
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:34,710
distills them I think it really

122
00:05:32,939 --> 00:05:37,080
simplifies for the you know for the

123
00:05:34,710 --> 00:05:38,759
common person kind of some basic things

124
00:05:37,080 --> 00:05:41,219
to help take care of our fruit trees

125
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:43,560
that I have never really known how to do

126
00:05:41,219 --> 00:05:46,199
to be honest with you I've always been

127
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,879
somewhat intimidated about cutting that

128
00:05:46,199 --> 00:05:50,580
I was afraid I was gonna do something

129
00:05:47,879 --> 00:05:51,900
wrong and I have never really known why

130
00:05:50,580 --> 00:05:54,840
we weren't getting a lot of fruit and

131
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:56,939
just by adopting this rule of thumb and

132
00:05:54,840 --> 00:05:59,729
thinning the fruit out if you know in

133
00:05:56,939 --> 00:06:01,590
June or early summer and and the the

134
00:05:59,729 --> 00:06:04,259
simple tricks or instructions for

135
00:06:01,590 --> 00:06:06,210
pruning I feel confident to be able to

136
00:06:04,259 --> 00:06:08,870
go out and do this so I hope you enjoyed

137
00:06:06,210 --> 00:06:12,569
the video and again another very

138
00:06:08,870 --> 00:06:14,610
