00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:21,160
everyone welcome to the afternoon

2
00:00:19,279 --> 00:00:23,840
sessions The forers

3
00:00:21,160 --> 00:00:26,119
Forum my name is David trinkin I'm on

4
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:27,240
the faculty of the pl Sciences unit

5
00:00:26,119 --> 00:00:30,119
University of

6
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:33,559
Missouri it's my pleasure to moderate

7
00:00:30,119 --> 00:00:35,800
the first uh three hours worth of

8
00:00:33,559 --> 00:00:38,600
sessions to begin with I would like to

9
00:00:35,800 --> 00:00:42,000
introduce my colleague Dr San Jen goo

10
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:43,879
who is state vegetable extension

11
00:00:42,000 --> 00:00:47,160
specialist as well as a faculty member

12
00:00:43,879 --> 00:00:50,480
at Lincoln University in Jefferson

13
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:52,960
City before Dr Goo arrived in Missouri I

14
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:55,520
don't think many missourians at least

15
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:58,239
heard of the concept of vegetable

16
00:00:55,520 --> 00:01:01,680
grafting much less tomato

17
00:00:58,239 --> 00:01:04,839
grafting since his Ral it's been kind of

18
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:08,560
a standard best management practice and

19
00:01:04,839 --> 00:01:10,439
today he's going to give us an update on

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,479
some of the research he's been carried

21
00:01:10,439 --> 00:01:14,479
out in in grafting Dr

22
00:01:14,600 --> 00:01:18,080
Goo thank you

23
00:01:18,520 --> 00:01:25,400
div I give one presentation before I

24
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:28,240
mean this morning for the seminar and uh

25
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:31,479
let me let me get this started uh this

26
00:01:28,240 --> 00:01:34,960
morning I talked about uh uh hold on let

27
00:01:31,479 --> 00:01:34,960
me let me move to the other

28
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:51,479
one you can see the outline over there

29
00:01:47,680 --> 00:01:54,520
just for today whole day so this morning

30
00:01:51,479 --> 00:01:57,880
I talk about uh the introduction part

31
00:01:54,520 --> 00:01:59,600
and what why and then we talk about how

32
00:01:57,880 --> 00:02:01,159
and this afternoon I'm going to talk

33
00:01:59,600 --> 00:02:04,200
about

34
00:02:01,159 --> 00:02:08,160
uh my research at the linol University

35
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:11,440
um before you before we start

36
00:02:08,160 --> 00:02:14,640
um for those who were not able to make

37
00:02:11,440 --> 00:02:16,239
to my presentation I do have a handouts

38
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:19,519
which is actually our newsletter

39
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:22,840
articles and my two assistants Sean and

40
00:02:19,519 --> 00:02:25,400
C going to uh distribute them to you

41
00:02:22,840 --> 00:02:27,120
there to be two and there should be

42
00:02:25,400 --> 00:02:29,160
three articles but I'm still working on

43
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:32,560
the third one so the first one is

44
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,959
introduction about vegetable grafting uh

45
00:02:32,560 --> 00:02:38,879
the second one is about tomato

46
00:02:34,959 --> 00:02:41,480
grafting uh this morning I discussed in

47
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:45,319
detail about how to do grafting in

48
00:02:41,480 --> 00:02:48,720
general not only for tomatoes but also

49
00:02:45,319 --> 00:02:52,080
for pepper for for eggplants for

50
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:54,800
watermelon cucumber and curbage stuff so

51
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,560
if you are interested in my presentation

52
00:02:54,800 --> 00:03:01,120
uh send me email so I can send you a pdf

53
00:02:57,560 --> 00:03:03,080
version um so um just give you a

54
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:05,720
pre-warning this afternoon's talk will

55
00:03:03,080 --> 00:03:08,200
be my research update and it will be

56
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:10,400
really dry so you'll see a lot of

57
00:03:08,200 --> 00:03:12,519
figures in the graphics stuff so it's

58
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:14,400
not going to be so colorful with

59
00:03:12,519 --> 00:03:18,000
pictures like this

60
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:22,159
morning and also um I wasn't able to get

61
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:24,159
all the data analyzed for this year um

62
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:25,319
we made some mistake there and by not

63
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,080
including the

64
00:03:25,319 --> 00:03:30,280
controls so so the result will be

65
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:35,040
primarily from last year

66
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:38,799
but um uh you you find what we did last

67
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:41,400
year so how many of you have uh attended

68
00:03:38,799 --> 00:03:46,040
my seminar this

69
00:03:41,400 --> 00:03:48,840
morning okay um so how many of you think

70
00:03:46,040 --> 00:03:50,560
you are very confident with the grafting

71
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:53,200
part

72
00:03:50,560 --> 00:03:57,280
already one hand two hands three hands

73
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:59,879
pretty good so like I said today and

74
00:03:57,280 --> 00:04:02,120
this afternoon will be research update I

75
00:03:59,879 --> 00:04:05,560
will not give you a lot of information

76
00:04:02,120 --> 00:04:06,959
about the general General uh grafting

77
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:10,920
technology

78
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,920
stuff uh it will be just some

79
00:04:13,480 --> 00:04:19,919
research

80
00:04:16,359 --> 00:04:22,680
okay again my name is sanin and sanin

81
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:26,360
with linkoln University extension uh I

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:30,759
have been with I've been in Missouri

83
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:36,039
for almost five five years now time F

84
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:38,360
time just passes fast okay um what we

85
00:04:36,039 --> 00:04:41,759
did last year we did two research at

86
00:04:38,360 --> 00:04:44,360
least to research projects number one is

87
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:46,400
the grafting compatibility study with

88
00:04:44,360 --> 00:04:49,759
heirloom tomatoes because we I

89
00:04:46,400 --> 00:04:52,120
introduced the idea to our Farmers about

90
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:55,240
uh tomato grafting they always ask me

91
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:58,240
questions whether you know if I have a

92
00:04:55,240 --> 00:05:00,039
heirloom can I just go try them you know

93
00:04:58,240 --> 00:05:02,600
do you have any research data to see

94
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:04,400
where they're going to take because you

95
00:05:02,600 --> 00:05:07,039
put two things together there is a good

96
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:09,400
chance they will not attack so that's

97
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,800
the reason behind this research of

98
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:16,520
course people are interested in U in in

99
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:19,479
uh High tunnel uh or field airom tomato

100
00:05:16,520 --> 00:05:23,440
production especially for organic or for

101
00:05:19,479 --> 00:05:27,759
or for farmers markets um so that's why

102
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:29,759
I did this research and uh um for those

103
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:33,560
who those of you who don't really know

104
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:37,160
about grafting yet um I can tell you

105
00:05:33,560 --> 00:05:39,759
some Advantage number one it'll have a

106
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:43,000
uh disease especially Sor born disease

107
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:45,160
resistance because of the root stock and

108
00:05:43,000 --> 00:05:48,440
number two if you choose a good roof

109
00:05:45,160 --> 00:05:51,440
stock you usually have a enhanced Vigor

110
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:55,639
and your yield usually be enhanced to be

111
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:58,560
increased uh and also uh High tunnel has

112
00:05:55,639 --> 00:06:01,280
been getting popular and we use high

113
00:05:58,560 --> 00:06:05,840
tunnel for season extension especially

114
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:08,080
in win uh in early fall or uh early

115
00:06:05,840 --> 00:06:10,680
spring or later spring so we want to

116
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:13,639
catch maybe two more months time to

117
00:06:10,680 --> 00:06:15,199
produce more warm seeding vegetables as

118
00:06:13,639 --> 00:06:19,599
well as some of the cold seeding

119
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:23,199
vegetables so grafting uh with correct

120
00:06:19,599 --> 00:06:25,520
roof stock you do enhance your s on um

121
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:29,599
code hardness so just some background

122
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:32,599
information for you okay um for this

123
00:06:29,599 --> 00:06:34,240
research what we did uh this is just

124
00:06:32,599 --> 00:06:38,120
introduction part we don't have to go

125
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:40,080
through this again um what we did last

126
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:43,280
year we choose about

127
00:06:40,080 --> 00:06:47,479
21 uh heirloom

128
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:51,520
tomatoes and we grafted them on two root

129
00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:54,720
stocks uh bufort and a maxi for so we

130
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:59,919
use the tubing grafting method we tried

131
00:06:54,720 --> 00:07:00,960
all those um aom Tomatoes you can see

132
00:06:59,919 --> 00:07:04,319
some of

133
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:09,039
them like a Kentucky beef steak Branny

134
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:12,560
wine uh pink heart I like this one

135
00:07:09,039 --> 00:07:14,800
actually so what we did briefly we used

136
00:07:12,560 --> 00:07:17,240
the tubing Masters this shows you how

137
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:20,360
you do it and for those of you who went

138
00:07:17,240 --> 00:07:22,919
to my talk this morning is should look

139
00:07:20,360 --> 00:07:26,240
familiar uh this picture was from uh

140
00:07:22,919 --> 00:07:29,800
those pictures were from Dr uh revert

141
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:32,319
from uh can Kansas State University and

142
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:34,960
basically what you do you grw your your

143
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:38,479
roof stock and your s on the similar

144
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:43,639
size you cut your roof stock and either

145
00:07:38,479 --> 00:07:46,120
before about or up below or uh over the

146
00:07:43,639 --> 00:07:48,400
cuton Lance I prefer this one because

147
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:51,120
later you don't have to remove suckers

148
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:53,800
and put a tube on it this is called a

149
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:56,240
tube graphing method because the tubes

150
00:07:53,800 --> 00:08:00,599
were designed specifically for this

151
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:04,360
method and you slide this tube in and

152
00:08:00,599 --> 00:08:07,280
then you cut your cion different angle

153
00:08:04,360 --> 00:08:10,240
45° and you slide this in make sure the

154
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,319
two surfaces contact each other and

155
00:08:10,240 --> 00:08:15,840
that'll be it of course later you have

156
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:20,199
to move into a growth chamber to to heal

157
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:22,759
them um so basically for this uh in

158
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,639
clamation process for day one to three

159
00:08:22,759 --> 00:08:29,720
you keep to close to 100% darkness and

160
00:08:25,639 --> 00:08:32,760
close to 100% humidity and after 3 days

161
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:35,959
you slowly reduce darkness and keep

162
00:08:32,760 --> 00:08:39,039
relatively high humidity and then after

163
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:43,800
7 to 10 days they are as normal if they

164
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:47,600
take uh one lesson I learned from this

165
00:08:43,800 --> 00:08:50,200
year was uh the temperature even though

166
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:52,920
it's not listed here the temperature

167
00:08:50,200 --> 00:08:55,640
plays very important role in the

168
00:08:52,920 --> 00:08:58,200
survival I guess um you don't want to

169
00:08:55,640 --> 00:09:01,240
keep your temperature before 80°

170
00:08:58,200 --> 00:09:04,760
Fahrenheit and the uh room temperature

171
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:07,600
will be actually very nice uh the story

172
00:09:04,760 --> 00:09:11,000
was for for my my observation was before

173
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:13,959
a meeting um I grafted something for

174
00:09:11,000 --> 00:09:16,560
some kids and uh I just dropped them in

175
00:09:13,959 --> 00:09:18,600
my office and then they came back 7 days

176
00:09:16,560 --> 00:09:20,800
later they all survived without any

177
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:24,560
cover so that gave me the hand that the

178
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,240
temperature is very very critical uh my

179
00:09:24,560 --> 00:09:29,839
office temperature in summer time is

180
00:09:26,240 --> 00:09:31,839
about 70° or lower so the this survived

181
00:09:29,839 --> 00:09:36,160
really well and humidity maybe just less

182
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:38,000
than 50 so keep that in mind okay um we

183
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:40,120
did the greenhouse research this is my

184
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,120
growth chamber we did just build some

185
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:46,079
frame and cover with some plastic that's

186
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:47,880
it I do have a a household humidity fire

187
00:09:46,079 --> 00:09:49,160
inside uh this is just show you the

188
00:09:47,880 --> 00:09:52,560
picture of the

189
00:09:49,160 --> 00:09:55,399
grafted uh transplant and those are

190
00:09:52,560 --> 00:10:00,000
survived transplants so those Greenhouse

191
00:09:55,399 --> 00:10:02,200
study and I graph them and to see uh the

192
00:10:00,000 --> 00:10:04,680
survival whether they are successful or

193
00:10:02,200 --> 00:10:07,440
not so here's the result like I said

194
00:10:04,680 --> 00:10:10,279
it's all graphic stuff and this is my

195
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:14,079
heirloom variety and this is my survival

196
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:18,279
rate rate with one is 100% so this is on

197
00:10:14,079 --> 00:10:20,880
Buford the roock bford you can see the

198
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:23,839
lowest one is The Branding one red is

199
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:26,240
actually not too bad 80% by the way I

200
00:10:23,839 --> 00:10:28,920
gravitated all this by

201
00:10:26,240 --> 00:10:31,920
myself it took me a lot of time so most

202
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:36,000
of them close to 100% take so it was

203
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:39,079
really really good and for Maxi for

204
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,600
however I did this some difference and

205
00:10:39,079 --> 00:10:44,360
uh you can see this mortgage lifter and

206
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:48,000
the um I don't I don't even know how to

207
00:10:44,360 --> 00:10:51,639
read it the h55 they were particularly

208
00:10:48,000 --> 00:10:54,279
low I tried to find out why it was this

209
00:10:51,639 --> 00:10:59,440
low I guess I probably was just too

210
00:10:54,279 --> 00:11:00,360
tired I don't know so uh however if you

211
00:10:59,440 --> 00:11:04,000
see the

212
00:11:00,360 --> 00:11:08,760
statistics you see even those 90 80% on

213
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:12,800
bord survival and the 72% on Maxi for

214
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:15,720
by uh the uh statistic analysis they are

215
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:17,800
not significantly difference so even

216
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:22,200
though there are some exceptions there

217
00:11:17,800 --> 00:11:25,240
uh we will see in general uh there's not

218
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:28,680
there was not at least in the greenhouse

219
00:11:25,240 --> 00:11:31,279
uh setting incompatibility issue so

220
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:34,720
which means you can grab them they can

221
00:11:31,279 --> 00:11:36,279
take really well and they can grow and

222
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:38,959
then whether they going to be okay in

223
00:11:36,279 --> 00:11:43,120
the field or not we don't know because

224
00:11:38,959 --> 00:11:46,279
earlier just like a just like the uh uh

225
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:48,160
the grips you grab them they look really

226
00:11:46,279 --> 00:11:51,720
well you plant them some of them you

227
00:11:48,160 --> 00:11:55,560
know they they will die or slowly reduce

228
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:58,040
the Vigor after 10 15 years so we did

229
00:11:55,560 --> 00:12:00,360
the greenhouse study just to see whether

230
00:11:58,040 --> 00:12:03,120
crafting is successful or not and then

231
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:07,600
we plant them in the field to test them

232
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:10,360
in the real um environment especially in

233
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:14,320
the open field and last year was a good

234
00:12:10,360 --> 00:12:18,800
year to test because it was hot and dry

235
00:12:14,320 --> 00:12:21,240
uh so we we planed those successfully um

236
00:12:18,800 --> 00:12:23,720
survived uh graphity transplants in the

237
00:12:21,240 --> 00:12:27,079
field this is how we did it in OB field

238
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:30,040
it was really dry and we we measured the

239
00:12:27,079 --> 00:12:32,000
grow and yield and yield dat is not

240
00:12:30,040 --> 00:12:34,040
available yet I believe because last

241
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:36,519
year we just didn't have a Tomatoes

242
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:38,040
until later in the growing season and

243
00:12:36,519 --> 00:12:40,920
when the weather was cold and we

244
00:12:38,040 --> 00:12:44,519
harvested a lot Green Tomatoes not not

245
00:12:40,920 --> 00:12:47,360
red ones so we we measured the uh stem

246
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:50,320
diameter and then we measured the stem

247
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:53,639
diameter above and below the graph Union

248
00:12:50,320 --> 00:12:57,120
trying to find index to see uh to

249
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:59,760
measure the uh compatibility so so

250
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:03,240
here's one picture showing this any wi

251
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:05,399
pink graphy Buford you can see the roads

252
00:13:03,240 --> 00:13:08,199
and here is graft Union here is graph

253
00:13:05,399 --> 00:13:09,959
Union here's graph Union and some of the

254
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:12,920
plants we actually planted a little bit

255
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:16,040
too too deep uh however you don't see a

256
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:18,680
lot of roots growing out above the graph

257
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:22,320
Union you know which was okay we don't

258
00:13:18,680 --> 00:13:27,120
want any rules come out from from the S

259
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:31,279
part okay um I split this this graph

260
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:35,199
Union and uh you see the picture here uh

261
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:37,199
you do see a kind of a diagonal line

262
00:13:35,199 --> 00:13:40,279
here showing the graph Union but even

263
00:13:37,199 --> 00:13:43,440
those here so in this so this one is non

264
00:13:40,279 --> 00:13:44,680
grafted you see visually you don't see a

265
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:47,839
lot of

266
00:13:44,680 --> 00:13:49,839
difference so which means they they do

267
00:13:47,839 --> 00:13:52,240
really well if you see the the

268
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:55,440
connection here this is a scon this is

269
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:57,040
your root stock there's no obvious stop

270
00:13:55,440 --> 00:13:59,920
stop there even though you can see

271
00:13:57,040 --> 00:14:02,000
something there so I draw a line there

272
00:13:59,920 --> 00:14:04,959
just to show the graphity unit over

273
00:14:02,000 --> 00:14:07,399
there and for stem diameter we always

274
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:10,199
tell people that if by choosing the good

275
00:14:07,399 --> 00:14:12,839
roof stock uh your growth the your s

276
00:14:10,199 --> 00:14:16,120
growth rigor can be enhanced so we

277
00:14:12,839 --> 00:14:20,959
measure the stem diameter you can see on

278
00:14:16,120 --> 00:14:24,880
bu for or Maxi for all those stems were

279
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:27,079
bigger than the non-gravity control so

280
00:14:24,880 --> 00:14:30,240
with does show the difference on the on

281
00:14:27,079 --> 00:14:33,440
your on the thickness of your your your

282
00:14:30,240 --> 00:14:37,040
stamp that's one way to say you have a

283
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:40,680
enhanced Vigor uh then for the diameter

284
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:43,120
ratio above and below of course non-ra

285
00:14:40,680 --> 00:14:46,199
will be zero I mean it will be one and

286
00:14:43,120 --> 00:14:48,600
for bord and maxfor the graph Union

287
00:14:46,199 --> 00:14:50,120
actually did something to the plant see

288
00:14:48,600 --> 00:14:52,920
above the graph unit is a little bit

289
00:14:50,120 --> 00:14:55,199
thicker than the lower one even though

290
00:14:52,920 --> 00:14:57,040
visually by your bare eyes you don't see

291
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:59,160
the difference if you measure with

292
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,759
measure them with the caliber you

293
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:04,519
actually see the difference so we do see

294
00:15:01,759 --> 00:15:09,759
some difference over

295
00:15:04,519 --> 00:15:12,839
there and the conclusion here is um um

296
00:15:09,759 --> 00:15:12,839
well here is

297
00:15:13,079 --> 00:15:20,120
uh well this is about the the greenhouse

298
00:15:17,320 --> 00:15:22,480
trial uh we had a better luck with

299
00:15:20,120 --> 00:15:26,399
maxford than

300
00:15:22,480 --> 00:15:30,279
Buford and then we know I just said that

301
00:15:26,399 --> 00:15:31,600
we had a bigger or thicker uh stems for

302
00:15:30,279 --> 00:15:35,560
the graphic

303
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:38,079
ones so the most important conclusion

304
00:15:35,560 --> 00:15:41,319
for this part is a grafting

305
00:15:38,079 --> 00:15:44,480
compatibility seem not to be an issue so

306
00:15:41,319 --> 00:15:47,800
at least in the tested 21 varieties so

307
00:15:44,480 --> 00:15:50,560
if you have a heirloom tomato I'm I'm

308
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:51,680
thinking I'm about maybe 90% sure you

309
00:15:50,560 --> 00:15:55,040
will not have

310
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:56,759
incompatibility if you for for for uh

311
00:15:55,040 --> 00:15:59,480
Tomatoes you know the reing

312
00:15:56,759 --> 00:16:00,519
incompatibility is so important

313
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:03,160
uh just

314
00:16:00,519 --> 00:16:06,000
because uh if you think about it you do

315
00:16:03,160 --> 00:16:09,079
grab you you grab the watermelon or

316
00:16:06,000 --> 00:16:11,040
cucumber or Melon you know if you add

317
00:16:09,079 --> 00:16:13,040
some bitterness to your watermelon I

318
00:16:11,040 --> 00:16:16,120
don't think people like it but for

319
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:19,639
tomatoes I don't think it's a big

320
00:16:16,120 --> 00:16:23,720
challenge so um then again that last

321
00:16:19,639 --> 00:16:26,440
year we we did some uh um uh airom trial

322
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:29,639
with graft with grafting in the high

323
00:16:26,440 --> 00:16:32,079
tunnels and uh we I have two High tels

324
00:16:29,639 --> 00:16:34,680
one is double layer poly uh the other

325
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:37,360
one is single layer poly so we did some

326
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,360
research on

327
00:16:37,639 --> 00:16:43,639
that and uh the with some uh what we

328
00:16:40,720 --> 00:16:46,120
want to do to find out uh if grafting

329
00:16:43,639 --> 00:16:49,040
will enhance the heirloom tomato

330
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:51,720
production in high tunnels and number

331
00:16:49,040 --> 00:16:54,759
two to find out whether single layer

332
00:16:51,720 --> 00:16:57,279
versus double probably will do some diff

333
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:58,680
do something to the earum tomatoes

334
00:16:57,279 --> 00:17:00,839
especially graphite ones in the High

335
00:16:58,680 --> 00:17:00,839
Time

336
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:05,280
and uh I I placed one sentence here

337
00:17:03,440 --> 00:17:06,559
tomato gravity and the high tunnel could

338
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:09,439
be a perfect

339
00:17:06,559 --> 00:17:13,079
combination uh the reason behind that

340
00:17:09,439 --> 00:17:16,480
you know people started to do uh High

341
00:17:13,079 --> 00:17:19,160
tunnels uh well largely because the NCS

342
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:21,919
got involved they get they get they got

343
00:17:19,160 --> 00:17:25,319
involved with the the cost share program

344
00:17:21,919 --> 00:17:28,520
so we have seen a lot High tunnels

345
00:17:25,319 --> 00:17:31,039
everywhere almost in the middle west so

346
00:17:28,520 --> 00:17:33,799
when people try to use new high tunnels

347
00:17:31,039 --> 00:17:35,840
they don't have a at least they don't

348
00:17:33,799 --> 00:17:38,080
maybe just beginners like I don't know

349
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:41,120
but their soil is kind of new they don't

350
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,120
have a lot of soil born disease problems

351
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:47,520
but in the future since high tunnel is a

352
00:17:44,120 --> 00:17:50,440
little bit cost costly to build to

353
00:17:47,520 --> 00:17:53,360
maintain and it give you more money so

354
00:17:50,440 --> 00:17:56,360
you tend to produce more of your cash

355
00:17:53,360 --> 00:17:59,000
crop like tomatoes and the rotation is

356
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:01,520
limited in the high tunnel and you want

357
00:17:59,000 --> 00:18:04,320
plan you want to apply more manures or

358
00:18:01,520 --> 00:18:07,440
compost so sooner or later your soil

359
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:10,200
disease will build up your soil salinity

360
00:18:07,440 --> 00:18:14,440
May Will May uh May build up if you're

361
00:18:10,200 --> 00:18:16,080
not careful enough so by doing that you

362
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:18,880
cause a lot of trouble for your

363
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:21,799
production and then and you cannot use

364
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:25,159
mes bomide anymore because it's banned

365
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:28,919
for it environment to damage so you

366
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:32,480
cannot use f Fant to do that the new one

367
00:18:28,919 --> 00:18:34,679
not be uh as well as the one we used

368
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:37,520
before like M bomide or they may have

369
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:40,520
some environmental issue as well or

370
00:18:37,520 --> 00:18:41,840
simply because you are organic or all

371
00:18:40,520 --> 00:18:44,679
natural farmer you don't want to do

372
00:18:41,840 --> 00:18:47,960
anything with that so but doing hype

373
00:18:44,679 --> 00:18:50,480
doing but but adapting the grafting

374
00:18:47,960 --> 00:18:51,919
technology you can avoid those uh

375
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:55,799
fumigation

376
00:18:51,919 --> 00:18:58,480
part so that we we did we use two s

377
00:18:55,799 --> 00:19:03,000
variety we have an ananas in the German

378
00:18:58,480 --> 00:19:06,240
pain two big fruit uh type variety um

379
00:19:03,000 --> 00:19:10,360
pretty good quality and uh we graft them

380
00:19:06,240 --> 00:19:14,039
into bufort emperador and Maxi for this

381
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:16,000
year I wasn't able to find this variety

382
00:19:14,039 --> 00:19:19,320
and for some reason seed companies don't

383
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:21,760
carry over uh seeds over years anymore I

384
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:25,760
don't know why so I couldn't find this

385
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:29,320
one uh for roof stock I have

386
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:32,360
a bu for and this and for the

387
00:19:29,320 --> 00:19:35,559
combinations for German pink I do have a

388
00:19:32,360 --> 00:19:37,080
self-grafted German Pink as control I

389
00:19:35,559 --> 00:19:40,360
have a non-grafted

390
00:19:37,080 --> 00:19:43,720
grafted on itself as control but for ANS

391
00:19:40,360 --> 00:19:47,679
I didn't have enough seeds so that's the

392
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:51,000
uh uh combination of grafting grafted

393
00:19:47,679 --> 00:19:55,240
tomatoes and um I can tell you I didn't

394
00:19:51,000 --> 00:19:57,240
take this picture I didn't really um

395
00:19:55,240 --> 00:20:01,000
it's a little fuzzy but this is German

396
00:19:57,240 --> 00:20:03,799
pink and this this is anus Nora it's

397
00:20:01,000 --> 00:20:06,440
very tasty

398
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:08,039
variety and same thing we do the tubing

399
00:20:06,440 --> 00:20:11,080
graphing method we graphing the

400
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:14,200
greenhouse last year we were late so we

401
00:20:11,080 --> 00:20:16,000
planted them in May usually we be in

402
00:20:14,200 --> 00:20:19,559
this area we will plant them in the high

403
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,919
tunnel late week of March or early April

404
00:20:19,559 --> 00:20:24,400
but we were late uh we were not getting

405
00:20:21,919 --> 00:20:27,760
the seeds in time for some reason the

406
00:20:24,400 --> 00:20:29,400
seed company agreed to send me the seeds

407
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:32,080
they forgot to do it

408
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:35,799
so anyhow and then the first batch of

409
00:20:32,080 --> 00:20:39,120
the the grafting graphed stuff uh it

410
00:20:35,799 --> 00:20:41,039
were killed with one weekend uh my I

411
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:43,400
guess my technician was not on campus

412
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:46,240
and the student worker didn't do a good

413
00:20:43,400 --> 00:20:48,960
job they just they just cooked in when

414
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:51,679
they were in the chamber so in the green

415
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:55,360
house with sunny light with black stuff

416
00:20:51,679 --> 00:20:58,039
on it they were killed so um people ask

417
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:59,760
me did you fire fire your uh student

418
00:20:58,039 --> 00:21:01,320
worker as no I didn't give give him

419
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:04,039
another

420
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:07,559
chance uh another story so this is my

421
00:21:04,039 --> 00:21:10,320
highight tonal 30 by 96 uh with Rich

422
00:21:07,559 --> 00:21:14,679
vent and uh this is single layer this is

423
00:21:10,320 --> 00:21:18,120
double layer it's uh it's a li men's

424
00:21:14,679 --> 00:21:22,159
brand yeah remember we're in zone 5B and

425
00:21:18,120 --> 00:21:26,080
uh like I said we plan them late and

426
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:29,240
then we ran right into this heat uh uh

427
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:31,720
weather so for quite a few while we

428
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,640
didn't have a uh we didn't have a

429
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:38,000
harvest because it was too hot but

430
00:21:34,640 --> 00:21:42,320
however we kept them there or kept them

431
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:45,279
going until later fall so um we do have

432
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:48,360
some data for last year and this is how

433
00:21:45,279 --> 00:21:51,440
my plans look like I do have automatic

434
00:21:48,360 --> 00:21:54,159
system to to drop the curtain down and

435
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:57,679
up and also a controller to control the

436
00:21:54,159 --> 00:22:01,000
r event so I had a pretty good system um

437
00:21:57,679 --> 00:22:03,400
to automatically manipulate my

438
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:05,919
temperature just because I cannot be

439
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:10,000
there every day neither did my

440
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:12,919
technician so you know this is a When I

441
00:22:10,000 --> 00:22:15,720
Was preparing this talk yesterday um I

442
00:22:12,919 --> 00:22:19,120
used one previous presentation I have a

443
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:21,320
the extreme hot and dry summer in 2011

444
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,240
but it wasn't true anymore this year was

445
00:22:21,320 --> 00:22:28,120
even bad so I removed that word but

446
00:22:24,240 --> 00:22:30,320
still tells you you know in late June to

447
00:22:28,120 --> 00:22:33,279
to almost the early part of August we

448
00:22:30,320 --> 00:22:37,240
have a really really to this part as

449
00:22:33,279 --> 00:22:39,240
well really bad uh weather and know we

450
00:22:37,240 --> 00:22:42,400
know that I think I have another line

451
00:22:39,240 --> 00:22:46,240
here you know pretty much here

452
00:22:42,400 --> 00:22:49,480
75 uh you see the plant growth for

453
00:22:46,240 --> 00:22:52,720
tomatoes get influenced about 97 I think

454
00:22:49,480 --> 00:22:56,440
pollination will will stop and if about

455
00:22:52,720 --> 00:22:59,600
1202 degree the whole plant may just may

456
00:22:56,440 --> 00:23:02,240
just not grow so this is especially true

457
00:22:59,600 --> 00:23:04,520
for for heirloom tomatoes which

458
00:23:02,240 --> 00:23:07,080
primarily is just in

459
00:23:04,520 --> 00:23:10,279
indeterminate so you can see I do have

460
00:23:07,080 --> 00:23:12,400
some heat tolerant varieties there

461
00:23:10,279 --> 00:23:15,480
unfortunately this is my variety trial

462
00:23:12,400 --> 00:23:18,480
part that's not the the grafted part but

463
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:24,120
other just like this for a long time no

464
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:24,120
fruit because pollination was was

465
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:28,919
impossible so we do see some temperature

466
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:30,600
difference between the two high tunnels

467
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:32,440
the single layer versus double layer

468
00:23:30,600 --> 00:23:35,760
basically in the early in the early in

469
00:23:32,440 --> 00:23:37,240
the morning well in in the morning the

470
00:23:35,760 --> 00:23:39,600
the the single ler has higher

471
00:23:37,240 --> 00:23:41,760
temperature and then the night at night

472
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:42,720
you you double at a higher temperature

473
00:23:41,760 --> 00:23:45,880
this is

474
00:23:42,720 --> 00:23:48,600
May uh and then the pr is the

475
00:23:45,880 --> 00:23:51,200
photosynthetic activity radiation you

476
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:54,039
see the difference between the two uh

477
00:23:51,200 --> 00:23:57,400
ler system you know in the high tunnels

478
00:23:54,039 --> 00:23:59,600
so if you um if you think about um

479
00:23:57,400 --> 00:24:02,360
maintaining the Heat in a high tunnel

480
00:23:59,600 --> 00:24:06,039
you may think about using double layer

481
00:24:02,360 --> 00:24:08,960
but in the in zone 6 b or above I don't

482
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:11,720
think it's necessary just give you some

483
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:15,080
um environmental factors there to help

484
00:24:11,720 --> 00:24:17,640
explain the uh explain the result so for

485
00:24:15,080 --> 00:24:20,720
the yield this is single layer you have

486
00:24:17,640 --> 00:24:22,720
a we have a green uh German pink German

487
00:24:20,720 --> 00:24:25,720
pink on German pink and then on three

488
00:24:22,720 --> 00:24:28,840
roof stocks you see pretty much similar

489
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:31,080
from U August here the basically you

490
00:24:28,840 --> 00:24:33,080
don't have I didn't have any Harvest and

491
00:24:31,080 --> 00:24:36,760
then we I do have a some Harvest

492
00:24:33,080 --> 00:24:40,399
starting in the late uh where early part

493
00:24:36,760 --> 00:24:42,039
of October until uh the frost came well

494
00:24:40,399 --> 00:24:44,679
not a frost the freeze temperature came

495
00:24:42,039 --> 00:24:46,440
in um I was actually in Pennsylvania for

496
00:24:44,679 --> 00:24:49,760
a meeting where my technician students

497
00:24:46,440 --> 00:24:51,600
are Harvest those tomatoes so you see

498
00:24:49,760 --> 00:24:54,360
really you don't see a lot of big

499
00:24:51,600 --> 00:24:57,320
difference for double year you do you do

500
00:24:54,360 --> 00:25:00,640
see some difference here for this one

501
00:24:57,320 --> 00:25:03,960
the green line is the German pink on

502
00:25:00,640 --> 00:25:07,159
bufor and we always see the the Maxi

503
00:25:03,960 --> 00:25:10,120
Fort will uh transfer the most Vigor to

504
00:25:07,159 --> 00:25:13,240
your s but u under that condition you

505
00:25:10,120 --> 00:25:16,320
know it is so hot bu for is less

506
00:25:13,240 --> 00:25:20,120
vigorous variet roock variety actually

507
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:22,240
didn't did better than others and uh for

508
00:25:20,120 --> 00:25:26,320
this one you can see the non- graphit

509
00:25:22,240 --> 00:25:30,320
one overall perform the worst so we

510
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:30,320
still see some difference in double year

511
00:25:30,399 --> 00:25:37,559
poly for for for the ananas you see the

512
00:25:34,960 --> 00:25:40,360
the similar chain but you don't see a

513
00:25:37,559 --> 00:25:44,200
lot of big difference here so for the

514
00:25:40,360 --> 00:25:47,399
double year uh this ones on this EMP

515
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:51,320
paror roof stock did a little bit better

516
00:25:47,399 --> 00:25:53,640
than others similar to this one so if

517
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:58,440
put this in together

518
00:25:53,640 --> 00:26:02,840
for for the an German pink we see very

519
00:25:58,440 --> 00:26:04,399
difference uh between uh the root stock

520
00:26:02,840 --> 00:26:07,279
treatment you know different root root

521
00:26:04,399 --> 00:26:10,520
stock and S of combinations for example

522
00:26:07,279 --> 00:26:13,080
this one the double layer seem to be

523
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:14,240
better for this one as well but others

524
00:26:13,080 --> 00:26:18,399
may

525
00:26:14,240 --> 00:26:20,320
not so so it varies depends on the

526
00:26:18,399 --> 00:26:23,399
variety but

527
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:25,760
for ananas the other variety you see the

528
00:26:23,399 --> 00:26:27,919
double or did better so we do see the

529
00:26:25,760 --> 00:26:28,880
difference between the two type of high

530
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:30,960
tunnel

531
00:26:28,880 --> 00:26:34,080
when you graft those

532
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:35,880
Tomatoes uh so this is result know

533
00:26:34,080 --> 00:26:37,919
generally speaking I don't see a lot of

534
00:26:35,880 --> 00:26:40,880
difference between the grafted ones and

535
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:44,520
non-grafted ones even though for for uh

536
00:26:40,880 --> 00:26:47,200
I think for for NS nor uh one Ro stock

537
00:26:44,520 --> 00:26:48,840
vary performed better and we see the

538
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:52,000
difference you know the the non-grafted

539
00:26:48,840 --> 00:26:54,799
tend to be lower yield but because the

540
00:26:52,000 --> 00:26:57,360
heat last year it didn't show the

541
00:26:54,799 --> 00:26:59,559
potential difference so I cannot see the

542
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:02,799
significant different

543
00:26:59,559 --> 00:27:05,679
um and but in the field in in the in the

544
00:27:02,799 --> 00:27:08,679
greenhouse I did see that the graphed

545
00:27:05,679 --> 00:27:08,679
ones were more

546
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:13,200
vigorous here is the arrow so

547
00:27:11,640 --> 00:27:15,799
temperature was different between the

548
00:27:13,200 --> 00:27:18,320
single double e or high tunnels so

549
00:27:15,799 --> 00:27:21,600
basically the tick home message for you

550
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:24,880
is uh grafting can enhance Vigor number

551
00:27:21,600 --> 00:27:27,399
one number two uh the Double year will

552
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:30,360
be better and the weather you know the

553
00:27:27,399 --> 00:27:33,679
three for whether the the grafting had a

554
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:36,200
benefit or advantage on this trial uh

555
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:39,399
you I cannot tell you but this year we

556
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:41,200
may have a better result however well

557
00:27:39,399 --> 00:27:44,200
this year we tried the same variety on S

558
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:46,320
on different root stock 1 2 3 4 five

559
00:27:44,200 --> 00:27:49,399
however we when I was trying to analyze

560
00:27:46,320 --> 00:27:52,039
data found out the control uh were not

561
00:27:49,399 --> 00:27:54,399
included there I mean we were data was

562
00:27:52,039 --> 00:27:57,120
there but were for the arrange data were

563
00:27:54,399 --> 00:28:00,279
not there so wasn't able to do the stats

564
00:27:57,120 --> 00:28:03,039
analysis statistic analysis so I'll

565
00:28:00,279 --> 00:28:05,760
present the data probably at the great

566
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:08,760
PLS conference in January and also going

567
00:28:05,760 --> 00:28:11,279
to post the result on our website so you

568
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:13,880
get this sooner or

569
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:16,120
later okay um this is a just quick

570
00:28:13,880 --> 00:28:18,679
update and again this is just a result

571
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:21,279
research results I think I have a couple

572
00:28:18,679 --> 00:28:21,279
minutes for

573
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:25,159
questions

574
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:28,120
first

575
00:28:25,159 --> 00:28:30,919
yes I saw where you're doing melons and

576
00:28:28,120 --> 00:28:32,600
cucumbers has anybody done this or is it

577
00:28:30,919 --> 00:28:34,519
does cantaloupe fall in the same

578
00:28:32,600 --> 00:28:37,519
category as

579
00:28:34,519 --> 00:28:37,519
watermelons

580
00:28:38,080 --> 00:28:43,600
uhal yeah his question is um um whether

581
00:28:41,480 --> 00:28:46,399
people have been doing research or or or

582
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:49,279
demonstration with uh curbage stuff like

583
00:28:46,399 --> 00:28:53,080
watermelons cucumbers and I haven't done

584
00:28:49,279 --> 00:28:55,720
this yet I have collected uh uh three

585
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:57,679
cucumber uh roock varieties which can

586
00:28:55,720 --> 00:28:58,640
also be used for watermelon and the

587
00:28:57,679 --> 00:29:00,320
melon

588
00:28:58,640 --> 00:29:02,559
so I'm going to do some research with

589
00:29:00,320 --> 00:29:05,799
cucumber the English cucumber type this

590
00:29:02,559 --> 00:29:09,240
year uh Dr hin Jaw from un University of

591
00:29:05,799 --> 00:29:12,039
Florida she's been doing uh melon

592
00:29:09,240 --> 00:29:13,799
cantaloup grafting study and there's

593
00:29:12,039 --> 00:29:16,840
another USD guy doing watermelon so

594
00:29:13,799 --> 00:29:20,440
there's big uh special crop research

595
00:29:16,840 --> 00:29:23,640
initiative Grant um it is looking at

596
00:29:20,440 --> 00:29:27,440
different aspect of grafting so uh that

597
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:30,919
Grant started last year I'm I'm assuming

598
00:29:27,440 --> 00:29:34,039
results will start to come out next

599
00:29:30,919 --> 00:29:37,360
year but in China they grabbed all

600
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:40,159
watermelons and cucumbers and melons in

601
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:41,960
the uh uh in the greenhouse and high

602
00:29:40,159 --> 00:29:46,240
tunnel

603
00:29:41,960 --> 00:29:48,960
settings they are doing great yeah simar

604
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,559
cucum it's a similar process as melons

605
00:29:48,960 --> 00:29:55,240
and cucumbers yes yes for for all cubits

606
00:29:52,559 --> 00:29:58,519
the graphing message will be similar and

607
00:29:55,240 --> 00:30:00,159
uh the result may vary because if you're

608
00:29:58,519 --> 00:30:02,080
talking about watermelon and melon

609
00:30:00,159 --> 00:30:04,399
you're talking about the sugar content

610
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:07,320
so the sometimes if you're not careful

611
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:10,200
and choose the wrong variety variety the

612
00:30:07,320 --> 00:30:12,200
the the quality may be may be reduced

613
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:15,159
however the research done by USD people

614
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:19,120
with watermelon they found out know if

615
00:30:15,159 --> 00:30:22,799
you grafted them it enhance the shelf

616
00:30:19,120 --> 00:30:25,360
life other questions

617
00:30:22,799 --> 00:30:27,799
question um what about as far as like

618
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:30,919
other online Resources with little you

619
00:30:27,799 --> 00:30:33,399
know uh you know the indepth specifics

620
00:30:30,919 --> 00:30:35,320
of grafting and planting schedules and

621
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:38,000
that kind of

622
00:30:35,320 --> 00:30:39,240
thing is there like any more like online

623
00:30:38,000 --> 00:30:40,720
resources or books that you might

624
00:30:39,240 --> 00:30:43,080
suggest for vegetable grafting in

625
00:30:40,720 --> 00:30:46,279
general um there are quite a few

626
00:30:43,080 --> 00:30:48,559
Publications for Farmers is extension

627
00:30:46,279 --> 00:30:52,360
Publications um there are some research

628
00:30:48,559 --> 00:30:54,440
projects as well uh I know in in in

629
00:30:52,360 --> 00:30:57,120
heart science in heart technology there

630
00:30:54,440 --> 00:30:58,639
are some Publications on grafted

631
00:30:57,120 --> 00:31:01,360
tomatoes

632
00:30:58,639 --> 00:31:05,039
and there is a review in heart science

633
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:08,360
on grafted watermelons and Artic cbits

634
00:31:05,039 --> 00:31:10,760
so uh our I don't know how good you are

635
00:31:08,360 --> 00:31:13,200
with uh scientific journal but at least

636
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:16,960
you can try if you want to you want to

637
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:19,559
do the uh uh scholar.google.com

638
00:31:16,960 --> 00:31:23,240
uh you can get a lot scientific

639
00:31:19,559 --> 00:31:23,240
information there
