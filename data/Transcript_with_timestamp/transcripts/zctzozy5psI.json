  "text": "[Music] I was telling you that the first two years were outstanding we had lead we got different cover crop mixes seeded you have these great strips we had awesome field days with between 40 to 80 people at them everything was great the first year so I was like wow I'm going to get two more years of this because this is going so well and then we got into really wet harvests and then we got into PPE on a couple of our fields and so really by the end of this I have some great baseline data but I don't have a lot of long-term data from it from the four years so what I'm going to focus on though are other partnerships and and those partnerships of those regional for farmers that were part of the grants are very strong we work about them I've met a lot of other farmers through them and through those boxes through those field days what we've now expanded so just on our files that they're doing on their parts and things that were measuring and they've come in as co-operators on their other projects through commodity funding or through NRCS or Sarah or any of those things they participate our workshops are Sarah professional development workshop grants as well so so this isn't going to be directly related to the projects I have if you go look at the reports online area I think it's what we've done is this has yeah push years would be great if it's the second two years before I go over failure but I think you'll see after way it's really fun some great partnerships within North Dakota because it's going to do this I was noticing that a lot of farmers I was talking with that part of the source s podcast that we have now so I'm actually going to walk through it in a way through their episodes and things they're trying the things they explain and describe so that you could go back and listen to those different episodes if you want to hear the farmers talk about what they're doing whether they're trying right but I think you know the essence of our podcast was this which is exactly what the partnership grant is is that you know saw was a journey it requires collaboration and curiosity amongst farmers researchers consultants and extension and those are the partnerships we really focused on and we have people from each of those groups talking about their experiences in still health on this podcast which the second series now comes out at March 1st so here's another example of the work that we're doing Dave Franzen is our soil fertility specialist and he's gone away from doing fertility trials on research centers and taking them out to farmers fields because it means more it means more to those farmers that have in field data that made changes based on those projects so here's de France and use one of the most traditional rigorous scientists that you'll find doing all these on-farm trials because it means more I think we can all agree to that it also has to be trust ready we can do always work in the world and unless somebody trusts us in the information we're providing they're not going to do those things so those those partnerships won't develop and so one of the things we're mostly on is system crop consult does Lee breeze is those partnerships of those relationships so I'd said earlier when we're talking about there's a presentation on on you know just the crisis that's happening with our farmers right then things that they're going throughout their farms and probably half this half of this past year I spent just trying to help farmers through that and it wasn't always about you know that they were in a state of crisis or there or they have these cos it was more just hey I'm gonna be there and let's go look at some fields let's talk about something more positive and and so that's where that trust comes in and I guarantee any of those farmers know we have a trust that if I need anything you're gonna help me out on a project if they need anything they don't the help them out but here's one farmer that we work with closely you Sam lemon he's episode 5 it's kind of the calendar who's got a say mr. genius Nancy I'm far away just turned 30 he's got his first kid on the way and and he's he's up in north northeastern North Dakota so many of those guys are still harvesting right now Sam was able to give us was pintos off you didn't have any acres of corn he's cooperating on a large field scale project we have where he's looking at notes Phil pintos will be looking at no-till pintos corn soybean and wheat with a cover crop and then full tillage to no cover crop and he's got a firm trial for that but he likes he's he's getting more and more confident that he can just do if he runs anything at vertical tillage he's gonna do in the spring and he's gonna keep his soils covered over the winter and if he's gonna try to get a cover crop in it's gonna be early and if it's not early enough he's gonna skip the cover crop because he thinks that his planter his drill will do more cutting up a president or damage than it will he just leaves the residue and doesn't have a cover crop because he wouldn't get enough growth so making some really good important decisions but he's got to figure out those new management so this is one of his fields it's got to warm up in the spring he's got him the plant into it so he's concerned about low temperatures he's concerned about it being too wet I mean these guys have rust everywhere in their fields this year but the notes what guys don't have as many ruts I'll tell you that they've been pretty proud about this year the seeds at hare pinning he's very concerned about that with his equipment his stand his emergence seeding into this is kind of scary force and so he's got to figure out how to manage it so his approach he's doing cover crops with bio strip too so in that case it's planting his radish uses a sugar beet play tennis in his planter 30 inch rows facing and they comes back in the following year and plants as pintos on that so he's creating a space for those for the cover crops to be very intensified in a strip where he's going to plant his cover crop the next year his cash crop the next year this gives him a little bit of relief of that wheat straw that he's concerned about but you know his reward news reward is that there's no reason to tell on the fall he's had great stance with Miss residue you see zero you know minimal difference if I had zero difference between yields on his pintos whether they're planted into residue or into and the cultivated soil and he's looking for that moisture in August and this year they didn't need Meister in August unfortunately but that's what he still in front of those dry years he's going to see I think he'll really see the benefits of what he's doing at this party Doug Toussaint was the dark operator episode 11 the sheriff farm on this the sare project got shared arm ser and a lot of them different acronyms the dog is he's one of those farmers at five years ago he transitions one quarter into no-till and use cover crops and the new transition the whole farm the next year so he's his his quote is cover crops it's not where to quit spending money one year he cut back and he didn't spend money on cover crops and he said it was his biggest regret that you didn't get every acre covered on his farm and so either I don't know him fail that if you just didn't do it at all and I think Doug is a man of few words often times there are problems of whatever but he says about his system and so he will get his come across and every single ad here he will make sure that happens whether is flowing on seated however he's gonna do is gonna get it done but this is one of the when we were finding you know the cover crops after leach was not happy because the harvests are so wet we just couldn't ask a farmer to get out there and add more to what they were doing plus the cover crops would have grown he switched his project to getting cover crops with in sunflowers and this one is a lot of people are really interested in this he was looking at it for the benefits of getting some extra roots in his high clay soil as he wants the beneficial insects out there to be pretty bittersweet affirmative the pest pressures not so flowers and then he's looking to manage weeds because he just think about like he didn't have enough tools to manage weeds in his system so we did never threw the strip's we had three fields for I think now it's been three years if he passes out there forty feet wide 60 feet long he sees this cover his sunflowers on thirty inch row spacing and then that same day he's seeding with the journal at seven and a half inch spacing the cover crop mixes we've got the mix down to you know eighteen bucks an acre which he can spray that out if he has to and not feel that out about it and that's kind of our goal and we're seeing no difference it's statistically no difference in the yield or oil content of those sunflowers there's still two hundred pound difference for the cover crops are 200 pounds low and where he has no cover crops and even though it's not stated statistically significant to him it's enough to be concerned about it so he will probably never take all fields which is fine I think he could get away with it on the borders of the field there you can do strips in a field and not not have that risk of doing the whole field or the cost of doing the whole field but he had the beautiful state IDs were some of these beautiful fields we worked in because those cover crops were blooming throughout the growing season to bring in the beneficial insects his approach of cover crops on every acre this is what he's often dealing with in the spring this is a late spring - so he's got a concern as he's you know his potential issues with getting cover crops that degree of care of man-hours and power how many people they do does he have to get out there and do these things to get around that he's flying out more cover crops and having good establishment getting in a growth having a bad residue other options of cover crops which he put out there which do not put out there what can you manage but the reward is he's also getting in the field not a problem and he's not got a problem on any field or he's had cover crops where he's not having cover crops like cereal right but went awry he may have potential issues and that's what that's a few loses sleep over maybe you can see this field so this is why I was walking through in the middle of it no no issues walking through all that water on a 60% clay and then that title field I stepped into next next to it that was the first step by token that was the last one I took his approach planting into something living so this is what he plants into in the spring and this is very different for the southeastern corner of North Dakota I mean this is not we typically see it he's got you know he's like 200 pounds of cereal rise where he's putting on his fields because he likes a lot of green I would recommend that for everybody but we could have too much growth when you if we have a job spring and could rob him of moisture you have too much water use seed placement equipment he's he's played with his cronies put things on and pull them off they're trying to get it so he can get that seed in the ground in a consistent way but the reward from this is that 9:00 p.m. phone call doug is always very respectful of my time and only calls me during work hours but one time he called me at 9:00 p.m. and he said you gotta see this and so that next day I was down there and and we look to this field this is his field that has had cover crops and no-till on it for I think at this point it was four years they had a soybean crop on it and they went through harvest and two-wheel-drive in the compound this is the neighbors feel that that has had rippers chisel plows field cultivators leech soybean rotation on it they use tracks to harvest this it was the same day and you can see the ruts and he was so excited to see that and this is also a benefit or the guy the aerial applicator I was flying over the field at the time Eric going to see cover crops in somebody else's farm that was starting to use cover crops and we call that very good said hey could you swing or not take a picture and you did and this is and this is what we have to show for it so this is a really really proud day for him this fall we went around to the same thing we drove and we looked at it looked at his fields and came up with a plan and he's love zero ruts in this field and everybody else was sliding all around knocked out ground and they had a really rough harvest people were chit were reusing rippers in full season cover crops I got out there that were PP I mean it was a it was there's a lot going on but he he was pretty proud about all of us profit off his field and this is this is what we saw this all this systemic field we drove across it he started laughing at me because we drove to a really standing water area and he looked at my face and this apparently looks like I was really scared you guys didn't think we're gonna make it did you and we sat we looked at this field and you could just see on this face how proud he is of what he's done and then this other field this child right across the road and that's what it was like in that field my government so those compaction issues are gonna be reflected in that crop for years the deep compaction this is another farmer Tony that I work with to Jamestown he he's been no-till for 15 20 years he uses cover crops intensively at least a third of his land and he farms a lot a lot of land so he's always out there receiving cover crops as the way he does it and he farms a lot of sandy soils that he doesn't like see in a so low blow away and so that for him its erosion he wants to keep his solos in place this is an example at one of his sandy fields where he's he had just taken this one over he had a short season crop on it because it's a sand so he adjusted his rotation had a short season crop on it followed it with an oak cover crop he left it just he just did oats because he wanted to come back in and spray over the top of it to control some wounds he had out there so this is how this field looks going to bed for the winter but he does have some concerns lack or residue too much water he's potentially on sandy soil lack of growth but he's been doing he's been getting a really really nice stance he also uses residue to his advantage so he bought a stripper had a couple years ago this is how he leaves his wheat straw standing a lot of bare ground underneath it becomes a profit seeds it people think it's gonna be a nightmare that next year well then the residue and everything standing it's not a problem to get into it and so that's what he's learned and that's what he's done don't catch a lot of snow and he's caught a lot of snow this is my turn this field but it's even and across the field so it's gonna melt evenly into the into the field that's not patched up in low spots or on the edge of the field he was that residue going around so he has a very consistent field in the spring to plant into and this was Tony's reward I did a video from one of his fields that he just took over and then one of his fields and he's been doing these practices on for 14 years they were just kiddy Korner to each other and I picked up the soils and it's the first time he's ever seen him side-by-side he's never thought to take one slope on my field and look at it next to the other and you can see in this how dark his soil is how much he's built up with organic matter and how much more walk moisture he can retain and for him that was that he knew he always knew Rudy's doing is working but this told him again that what he's doing is working and he needed that confirmation I have an episode two for this awesome and I talk about the program we're gonna done so oftentimes whether you're two miles away or you're 200 miles away there's something that you can take from each other's systems and so a lot of what I do is this network approach to getting farmers to talk and gave people an extension to talk and researchers and Industry and consultants to talk so the green dots on here are our NDSU people whether they're researchers are extension the red wants our consultants the blue ones are farmers and the other ones are industry and so if you look at the idea of this is that you have all the locations where we've had programs particularly this cafe talk program that I do which stairs is funding this year so you've all these talks and all these farmers show up and as they move to the center of this diagram and there's in there dot gets bigger that means they're they're having programs they're potentially having more influence on people and sharing conversations so we have people on the inside that are sharing a lot of information showing up to a lot of events we have the people on the outside that we want to get on the inside so I can see where we're going to go we're gonna bring on the outside to the inside we're going to continue to strengthen this will get more people on the outside and keep this network building and the idea of this is that one person could step away at any time and the network won't fail so it makes it so that one person is not important it's how everybody interacts that's important what we do this we do another social network analysis where we have farmers list names and the three people they talk to from like research perspective and then three people they talk to in general about soil health and in that one the more somebody's name is listed as somebody if somebody talks to the larger their dockets and so there are farmers that that we can pick out that are very influential in their areas because people listed them as somebody is a resource and they're talking to them all the time and so that helps us with our program you say wow I'm gonna make sure that that farmer has the information they need the tools they need whatever they need to make sure that the information they're sharing is science-based that it's practical applications that we can keep soil health of science and not just an observation type program and then here's one of the farmers are relying heavily Joe Rutger who's been 40 some years no-till and his 20 years of cover crops he's a very wise farmer and she says every situation is unique he never pushes what he says on anybody else every situations neat but he thinks that everybody has the opportunity to make these steps on their farms it's just what steps they're going to use and how they're gonna make it work and so he he helps he helps quite a bit a lot of these farmers I call and I say could you come to this event because I think that that you could talk about this person or you know they would benefit your from hearing your message or hey could you just be there and if somebody has a question then you can help them answer it and they and these farmers will do that now because of this network we've built it because of the relationships we've built I'm so I'm very grateful for that and then one last thing I want to show you is so are we seeing changes we do pretty extensive evaluations every three years is what we've been kind of doing and so this is from our programming these are the topics you know establishing a cover crop a standing soybean using multiple species diversifying crop rotation for inclusion of cover crops establishing cover crop and corn growing cover crop proceed establishing after harvest using steroids alignment and the green part on this and this is a draft this is literally I was like gosh I show it or not that this is I want to show it so they change a little bit as we clean up continue to clean up the data but this is in the green is what people are doing is result attending one of our programs called the cafe talks so they are using these practices of cover crops now because they learned about it at one of our programs this black area is where we see the most potential because they're considering it and so these are the practices we are going to make sure that we show work establishing something is standing soybean establishing a cover crop that's where I'm going to focus a lot of efforts because 51 percent of people are thinking about it and they need more information to pull the trigger and make that decision same with the multi-species cover crop mix let's help them find five species that really are going to work for them that they can control again with establishing a cover crop and standing corn let's find out if you fly it on or if you seated or how you're going to get that cover crop out there how are you gonna modify equipment to get that done and what fixes should you use and then also that inclusion of diversifying the crop rotation which we know diversifying our operation is like the number one tool we have and so if we can get away from two crops or soybean on soybean or corn on corn benefit the system from a whole system perspective and then the other things like growing cover crop proceed 44% people are thinking of doing that so we're not going to sleep it's not going to be something I'm gonna make sure they don't break any laws when they sow seed to make sure it's not protected or whatever if they're gonna start selling things so that they use certified see their aspects like that but I'm gonna keep them out of trouble but I'm not gonna focus on it because they're not really interested in it and then this is another reward this podcast is going to be played over 11,000 times since we released in August first so when I see this this keeps me going this is one of those things that I need to see that I know that what I'm doing is is working and if I didn't see this it was only like ten dots then I doing it probably not the right tool so let's find something else and ask the farmers what do they want what do they need so I'll take any questions [Music] [Applause] you know I'm not familiar with that study that they're that they're talking about but my thought okay when you think about tillage right you're incorporating plant material from the surface into the soil and then you collect that soil sample and you send it off for analysis so timing could be everything on that did they collect it after they chisel out it or tilt it and then set it off and I've got big chunks of residue that have a lot of carbon in it that are complaining that organic matter - say yeah this is working or is it its season and they're capturing the roots from the Krait you know of it and that's why I think that test is very difficult because it depends on timing it depends on how the sample is collected it depends on like I think a lot of people when they transition from a full tillage to no-till situation you know they sample containers where you know they don't have any other residue on the surface and they could have sampled it whenever in the season and then they come back in and that consultants is in their pickup and they drop the the auger down to sample they don't brush away the residue on the surface so then that inflates that organic matter never that comes back because it's determining litter as part of that organic matter pool but is it you know I mean that's it so it all depends on what you think is part of organic matter if I can identify it I don't think it's organic matter if I can say that's a piece of corn trash then to me that's not sort of organic matter so if it doesn't know it's residue yeah organic matter something you can't identify you look at it you say boy I don't know what that was but I bet it could've been rude he's a residue it could have been imposed wasn't the core part of the question people to the right question have to do the examples I haven't look for examples for that but because the process is flawed I can't even I can't even make an assumption on whether that could happen or not because summit I've seen a lot of really inflated numbers and no-till systems to but it's a big a so I don't find out Ashley I don't mean fight I guess they just don't really look at that of her so I did you like yeah mister annual ryegrass and Dutch white clover oh yeah I'm sorry I think my concern was if I did a peer stand of clover it's a little slower to establish and so that we would get some more weed growth that would be coming up through that so that was my goal to have something that was would kind of grow quickly it can't be over relatively quickly so yeah I mean the mixture is good I would certainly consider doing a but having some kind of grass in there it's kind of a good good balance see look here you're no you're not plastic culture where the the pepper pot was right next to the roots at first but you didn't see any high spikes a nitrogen that might have caused loss memmer are any issues like that Oh spikes an extra from having a leg you in there yeah no no in fact we saw quite a little bit of a nitrogen detriment it takes a little while for clover to get going right so it's not doing a whole lot of extra fixing until probably probably realistically probably next year and I'll guess to your operational or your scale for a certified mechanic yeah and then after you had your pledge stick out and you had seven establish covered you didn't see me go and they broadcast whatever was left over there so I mean you could do that I'd like to avoid it part of the issue is that I didn't think we were getting much benefit when we were putting down winter I and late October in Oregon's snow the first week of November so certainly you couldn't you could go you drop I don't really have an easy way just just like bandit on those areas that you probably drawed cast got alcohol field in Broadway stood some speed so certainly you could do that and if you got a crop that came out earlier and you thought you could actually get some good growth then it might be worth doing we we did probably because it was coming out like the 28th Rock dough that's kind of part of the purposes well you got we have 40 or 50 percent of our field with like these strips you can do a pretty pretty good job given your New Deal which is the constraints of the crop and production system you",
