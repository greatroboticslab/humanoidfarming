23
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:56,640
the vast Peach Orchards across the US

24
00:00:54,440 --> 00:00:58,480
peaches are not only a beloved fruit but

25
00:00:56,640 --> 00:01:00,960
also an important part of American

26
00:00:58,480 --> 00:01:04,360
agriculture every year the US produces

27
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:06,640
around 620,000 tons of peaches with

28
00:01:04,360 --> 00:01:09,320
States like California Georgia and New

29
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:12,280
Jersey leading the way California is the

30
00:01:09,320 --> 00:01:14,520
largest producer accounting for 81% of

31
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:16,560
the nation's Peach production at

32
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:19,479
American Farms peach trees are usually

33
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:21,360
planted in late winter or early spring

34
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:23,280
the process begins with selecting the

35
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,520
right Peach varieties and preparing the

36
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,119
soil with optimal pH levels peaches

37
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:31,119
require well- drained soil and

38
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,759
meticulous care to ensure healthy growth

39
00:01:31,119 --> 00:01:34,920
although these peach trees are only one

40
00:01:32,759 --> 00:01:37,640
year old they promise fruitful harvest

41
00:01:34,920 --> 00:01:39,320
in the future most Peach varieties take

42
00:01:37,640 --> 00:01:41,720
three years or more to Bear their first

43
00:01:39,320 --> 00:01:43,920
fruit caring for peach trees is a

44
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:45,640
crucial part of the process the trees

45
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,640
are pruned at the top to direct

46
00:01:45,640 --> 00:01:50,159
nutrients to the roots and trunk

47
00:01:47,640 --> 00:01:52,159
promoting strong growth pruning is an

48
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,200
important step to ensure sunlight can

49
00:01:52,159 --> 00:01:56,320
penetrate the canopy efficiently

50
00:01:54,200 --> 00:01:58,320
managing water especially during the

51
00:01:56,320 --> 00:02:01,119
ripening stage when Peach blossoms are

52
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:03,479
in full bloom Farmers carefully prune

53
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:06,360
the trees leaving about 60% of the

54
00:02:03,479 --> 00:02:08,720
blossoms to ensure optimal fruit density

55
00:02:06,360 --> 00:02:10,520
and enhance Peach quality in Peach

56
00:02:08,720 --> 00:02:13,080
Orchards millions of honeybees are

57
00:02:10,520 --> 00:02:15,440
brought in to assist with pollination

58
00:02:13,080 --> 00:02:17,879
after pollination Farmers assess fruit

59
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:20,400
density and remove excess fruits to

60
00:02:17,879 --> 00:02:22,200
maintain the best quality peaches are

61
00:02:20,400 --> 00:02:24,840
typically harvested in late February and

62
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:27,120
early March for Orchards with multiple

63
00:02:24,840 --> 00:02:29,519
Peach varieties the harvest season

64
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:30,400
usually lasts about 2 weeks with several

65
00:02:29,519 --> 00:02:32,319
picking

66
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,440
to ensure the peaches are harvested at

67
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,080
Peak ripeness preserving the best

68
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:39,560
quality and flavor most Farms choose to

69
00:02:37,080 --> 00:02:41,360
harvest peaches by hand a process that

70
00:02:39,560 --> 00:02:43,760
is carried out with great care and

71
00:02:41,360 --> 00:02:45,480
precision Farmers usually Begin work

72
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:48,040
early in the morning when the weather is

73
00:02:45,480 --> 00:02:49,800
still cool they gently hold the peach

74
00:02:48,040 --> 00:02:52,000
and twist it slightly to detach it from

75
00:02:49,800 --> 00:02:54,560
the branch without damaging the tree or

76
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:56,920
the fruit the peaches are then placed

77
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:59,120
carefully into baskets or bins to avoid

78
00:02:56,920 --> 00:03:01,080
bruising next the peaches are sorted

79
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,360
into baskets or bins to ensure that none

80
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,560
are damaged during the Harvest at the

81
00:03:03,360 --> 00:03:07,879
packing facilities farmers use

82
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:10,080
specialized scales to weigh multiple

83
00:03:07,879 --> 00:03:12,239
peaches at once these scales are

84
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:14,280
designed with several compartments where

85
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:16,159
the peaches are sorted by weight before

86
00:03:14,280 --> 00:03:19,159
being transferred into the appropriate

87
00:03:16,159 --> 00:03:21,040
bins based on size thousands of workers

88
00:03:19,159 --> 00:03:23,360
from Mexico and Guatemala come to help

89
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,799
with the peach Harvest each worker can

90
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:28,840
prune about 12 Trees in just 30 minutes

91
00:03:25,799 --> 00:03:31,360
and earns an average of $13 per hour

92
00:03:28,840 --> 00:03:35,120
peaches are hand harvested each year by

93
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:37,750
about 5,300 workers with wages ranging

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:50,720

97
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:58,360
facilities peaches undergo several steps

98
00:03:55,760 --> 00:04:00,519
to ensure the best quality after being

99
00:03:58,360 --> 00:04:03,079
harvested peaches are cooled to remove

100
00:04:00,519 --> 00:04:05,760
field heat helping to slow the ripening

101
00:04:03,079 --> 00:04:07,560
process and preserve freshness the

102
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,959
peaches then go through inspection and

103
00:04:07,560 --> 00:04:12,799
washing to remove dirt and pesticide

104
00:04:09,959 --> 00:04:15,439
residues here they undergo a meticulous

105
00:04:12,799 --> 00:04:17,280
process to become various products first

106
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:19,720
the peaches are sorted by size and

107
00:04:17,280 --> 00:04:22,199
quality the best peaches are blanched in

108
00:04:19,720 --> 00:04:24,440
hot water to soften the Skins making

109
00:04:22,199 --> 00:04:27,120
them easier to peel without damaging the

110
00:04:24,440 --> 00:04:29,240
flesh after peeling the peaches are

111
00:04:27,120 --> 00:04:31,440
sliced and pitted in preparation for

112
00:04:29,240 --> 00:04:33,639
