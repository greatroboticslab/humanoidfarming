1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:06,080
anyway I'm going to talk about uh some

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:07,720
of the capturing and the utilization of

3
00:00:06,080 --> 00:00:10,880
the nutrients and I'm going to talk

4
00:00:07,720 --> 00:00:13,519
about it a lot from the standpoint of

5
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:15,839
people that have moved from open feed

6
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:17,439
lots to these types of facilities some

7
00:00:15,839 --> 00:00:18,279
of the things that are different some of

8
00:00:17,439 --> 00:00:21,199
the

9
00:00:18,279 --> 00:00:23,279
considerations that you need to make

10
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:27,840
that are are going to make

11
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:30,519
things some of the big differences um

12
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:33,320
with an open feed lot you can uh do

13
00:00:30,519 --> 00:00:35,680
chores probably once every six months as

14
00:00:33,320 --> 00:00:38,680
far as scraping and cleaning out the

15
00:00:35,680 --> 00:00:41,840
barns or cleaning out the pens and so

16
00:00:38,680 --> 00:00:45,840
forth it needs to be very timely in

17
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:49,879
these barns um so it becomes part of

18
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:55,600
weekly chores uh also you are in close

19
00:00:49,879 --> 00:00:58,559
proximity with the c um when you're

20
00:00:55,600 --> 00:01:00,840
moving moving in there with equipment

21
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:04,040
and I take it nobody wants to scrape

22
00:01:00,840 --> 00:01:07,880
these barns by hand right okay you're

23
00:01:04,040 --> 00:01:09,759
going to be in there with the cattle um

24
00:01:07,880 --> 00:01:12,640
different cattle are going to behave

25
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:16,280
differently but often times they become

26
00:01:12,640 --> 00:01:18,960
more and more accustomed to the uh

27
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:20,520
tractors the equipment in there and

28
00:01:18,960 --> 00:01:24,400
there's a

29
00:01:20,520 --> 00:01:26,680
tendency to bump them especially late

30
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:29,280
late in the uh feeding period when

31
00:01:26,680 --> 00:01:31,880
you've got all the money and so forth in

32
00:01:29,280 --> 00:01:33,640
and uh you got to be very very careful

33
00:01:31,880 --> 00:01:36,079
and think about what you're doing think

34
00:01:33,640 --> 00:01:38,079
about the way you design these so that

35
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:40,840
you can clean out the manure on a

36
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:43,159
regular basis and not injure the cattle

37
00:01:40,840 --> 00:01:45,880
especially when they're ready to go on

38
00:01:43,159 --> 00:01:48,200
the truck tomorrow as far as the

39
00:01:45,880 --> 00:01:50,479
nutrients that are out

40
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:52,360
there I guess I'm going to think about

41
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,640
them in terms of where they're coming

42
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,960
from and we have the two different types

43
00:01:54,640 --> 00:02:00,000
we've got the the part that's coming out

44
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:03,439
of the urine um which is going to be

45
00:02:00,000 --> 00:02:06,240
mostly all our potassium very soluble in

46
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:10,000
the open lots a lot of times that is

47
00:02:06,240 --> 00:02:11,920
lost through run off that comes off the

48
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:15,000
top we're going to be able to cap

49
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,680
capture that it does attach quickly to

50
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:20,319
exchange sight so some of the soil and

51
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:22,000
so forth under an open lot will have it

52
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:25,640
otherwise we're going to be capturing

53
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:29,160
that with our bedding ammonia and we've

54
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:31,800
done the study it can but volatilize and

55
00:02:29,160 --> 00:02:34,920
often times if you're losing very much

56
00:02:31,800 --> 00:02:38,239
ammonia from just your standpoint you

57
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:41,959
can smell if you can smell it a lot that

58
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:44,239
probably means that we've got it leaving

59
00:02:41,959 --> 00:02:49,200
it also will attach to the exchange

60
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:53,720
sites on things um cattle produce a lot

61
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:57,080
of species or the organic matter that

62
00:02:53,720 --> 00:03:00,280
Parts probably always or very often

63
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:02,480
going to be all captured in our uh

64
00:03:00,280 --> 00:03:05,200
facilities that's the part that takes

65
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:07,599
some additional breakdown in order for

66
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:11,280
our plants to use

67
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:14,040
it and it actually contains lots of

68
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:16,720
exchange sites and so if you've got a a

69
00:03:14,040 --> 00:03:19,959
piece of property that you've applied

70
00:03:16,720 --> 00:03:22,159
manure on year after year often times

71
00:03:19,959 --> 00:03:24,799
you'll you'll see that it's able to

72
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,159
retain more it has a higher organic

73
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:30,519
matter in it that's because that's where

74
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:33,280
it came from

75
00:03:30,519 --> 00:03:36,560
we take a look at at how much the

76
00:03:33,280 --> 00:03:41,560
animals produce versus how much we're

77
00:03:36,560 --> 00:03:45,040
able to capture in the different systems

78
00:03:41,560 --> 00:03:49,000
um reason why in the beded

79
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:52,840
barns we're probably going to be adding

80
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:55,920
around a baale 1,00 to 1200 lb of

81
00:03:52,840 --> 00:03:59,319
additional material out there to soak up

82
00:03:55,920 --> 00:04:02,760
that urine uh keep things dry and that's

83
00:03:59,319 --> 00:04:05,560
why we have a a higher amount here in

84
00:04:02,760 --> 00:04:09,239
terms of the capture versus the open

85
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:14,280
lot uh on a a deep

86
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:17,479
pit um we put things down here and this

87
00:04:14,280 --> 00:04:19,199
is I get a lot of people asking me when

88
00:04:17,479 --> 00:04:23,280
they've done some manure

89
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:27,160
analysis why do you have so much more

90
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:30,759
captured from a deep pit and it's really

91
00:04:27,160 --> 00:04:35,960
just a matter of how we Mar measure it

92
00:04:30,759 --> 00:04:38,800
okay this is measured in pound per th000

93
00:04:35,960 --> 00:04:44,919
gallons there

94
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:48,000
is in 1,000 gallons there are 4 tons of

95
00:04:44,919 --> 00:04:51,360
material so these are actually going to

96
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:53,400
be roughly speaking four times as great

97
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,320
as this because of the difference in the

98
00:04:53,400 --> 00:05:00,440
way that we're actually

99
00:04:56,320 --> 00:05:04,759
measuring when people are building um

100
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:06,080
livestock facilities for cattle um one

101
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:09,919
of the

102
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:11,400
thing salesman often talk about the cost

103
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:14,880
per head

104
00:05:11,400 --> 00:05:17,360
space on their facilities yes I'd like

105
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:20,720
you to take a look at it in terms of

106
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:24,840
cost per square foot so that you can

107
00:05:20,720 --> 00:05:28,319
evaluate all of these on I'll say the

108
00:05:24,840 --> 00:05:31,919
same basis is and also when we move

109
00:05:28,319 --> 00:05:34,639
cattle into facilities the facilities

110
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:38,960
are relatively speaking

111
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:40,520
expensive and so we squeeze more animals

112
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,280
into less

113
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:45,520
space

114
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:49,560
um we're normally down in in the lower

115
00:05:45,520 --> 00:05:53,240
end of this I'll say at least uh uh 40

116
00:05:49,560 --> 00:05:56,759
square ft per head at 40 square ft per

117
00:05:53,240 --> 00:06:00,479
head the amount of urine that you get on

118
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:03,039
a daily basis is a/4 inch

119
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:07,599
okay that's with little

120
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:11,319
C that is as much as we get in terms of

121
00:06:07,599 --> 00:06:13,240
evaporation on the warm day so a lot of

122
00:06:11,319 --> 00:06:15,240
times we're going to have them in here

123
00:06:13,240 --> 00:06:18,520
dense enough that you're going to keep

124
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:21,680
everything wet I put this into the paper

125
00:06:18,520 --> 00:06:25,520
and it's also up here at the various

126
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:28,400
stocking densities how much depth of a

127
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:30,280
manure do you get in a week and think

128
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:33,360
then about how free frequently you're

129
00:06:30,280 --> 00:06:39,199
going to scrape and get that cleaned up

130
00:06:33,360 --> 00:06:41,919
okay and over time U that I've been with

131
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,560
Iowa State University extension service

132
00:06:41,919 --> 00:06:48,720
we move from finished cattle that were

133
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:52,560
900 to 1,000 head now I I see

134
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:54,240
14500 lb cattle routinely being that big

135
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:57,199
before they're going to Market when

136
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:59,840
they're that big they produce a lot more

137
00:06:57,199 --> 00:07:01,720
manure we've done some things in terms

138
00:06:59,840 --> 00:07:05,240
of feeding so that we can still put on

139
00:07:01,720 --> 00:07:06,680
muscle on those uh big animals but

140
00:07:05,240 --> 00:07:08,039
they're eating a lot of feed they're

141
00:07:06,680 --> 00:07:10,599
gaining a lot of weight and they're

142
00:07:08,039 --> 00:07:14,840
producing a lot of manure if they're in

143
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:17,560
tight tight uh positions we're looking

144
00:07:14,840 --> 00:07:20,199
at a lot of manure being produced at

145
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,120
large cattle we're looking at over 5 in

146
00:07:20,199 --> 00:07:25,720
per

147
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:28,680
week okay and if you have a cleaning

148
00:07:25,720 --> 00:07:30,400
schedule that's on here the difference

149
00:07:28,680 --> 00:07:33,080
between The Big C cattle and the little

150
00:07:30,400 --> 00:07:37,160
cattle and at the end of the feeding

151
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:40,000
period you need to be on it on on your

152
00:07:37,160 --> 00:07:42,520
schedule or adjust your schedule so you

153
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:45,560
you can be on it because being one or

154
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,960
two days late is the difference between

155
00:07:45,560 --> 00:07:50,159
having cattle that clean and nice and

156
00:07:47,960 --> 00:07:51,879
are able to keep their hair coat and

157
00:07:50,159 --> 00:07:56,039
those that

158
00:07:51,879 --> 00:07:58,919
aren't this is uh why we use the bedding

159
00:07:56,039 --> 00:08:00,319
help soak up the manure keep the cattle

160
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:06,120
clean

161
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:09,479
okay change the uh manure from a semi or

162
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:13,199
slurry into a semisolid that we're able

163
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:16,800
to handle something that's at least uh

164
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:21,199
80% water that sounds like a lot right

165
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:24,639
20% solids 80% water that will stand up

166
00:08:21,199 --> 00:08:27,199
nicely in a manure sprad okay if it gets

167
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:30,199
higher than that it runs out the back

168
00:08:27,199 --> 00:08:33,240
gate um what are the cons considerations

169
00:08:30,199 --> 00:08:35,959
of course betting has cost involved with

170
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:39,680
it and it's gotten higher over time and

171
00:08:35,959 --> 00:08:42,039
especially in years when you have a late

172
00:08:39,680 --> 00:08:43,880
wet season when you need betting the

173
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:46,040
most it's going to be the hardest to

174
00:08:43,880 --> 00:08:48,360
make and if you can't make it nobody

175
00:08:46,040 --> 00:08:51,320
else did and it's going to be very

176
00:08:48,360 --> 00:08:53,320
expensive so just put that on your your

177
00:08:51,320 --> 00:08:57,640
thing every time you handle it it costs

178
00:08:53,320 --> 00:09:00,640
more money storing it costs some money

179
00:08:57,640 --> 00:09:03,120
and of course processing helps to

180
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,440
improve the surface area so you can soak

181
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:09,519
that stuff the urine up quickly but of

182
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:11,720
course that costs more money uh where do

183
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:14,200
you want to store it uh of course you

184
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:17,440
want to often times have it very close

185
00:09:14,200 --> 00:09:20,360
to the bar um and you'd like to keep it

186
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:23,600
high and dry so that you have as Le the

187
00:09:20,360 --> 00:09:27,399
least amount of sto spoilage as

188
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:33,680
possible and here we've got it high and

189
00:09:27,399 --> 00:09:37,120
dry now uh with uh with these if you are

190
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:39,680
slow and late or also I'll say you you

191
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:41,440
got to make sure that you evaluate how

192
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,720
good the quality is of the beding

193
00:09:41,440 --> 00:09:46,560
especially late in the year when we've

194
00:09:43,720 --> 00:09:49,200
had some de decomposition of it you

195
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:52,839
might need to add a few Bales so we

196
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:56,040
don't end up with a with a cattle that

197
00:09:52,839 --> 00:09:59,120
have lost their hair coat they lose the

198
00:09:56,040 --> 00:10:03,120
hair coat and they're also going to have

199
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:04,959
to use more of their the feed to control

200
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:06,120
their body temperature especially when

201
00:10:04,959 --> 00:10:10,880
it gets

202
00:10:06,120 --> 00:10:14,120
cold Bing is going to change with the

203
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:16,079
season and uh with cattle at least a lot

204
00:10:14,120 --> 00:10:19,200
of the individuals I'm working with

205
00:10:16,079 --> 00:10:22,120
we're feeding uh Cals Cavs in the fall

206
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:24,440
maybe yearlings uh to get another turn

207
00:10:22,120 --> 00:10:27,640
through there uh when we bring them in

208
00:10:24,440 --> 00:10:30,279
in the fall dealing with the smaller

209
00:10:27,640 --> 00:10:34,399
cabs probably start them out on a a

210
00:10:30,279 --> 00:10:38,440
little bit uh less hot diet in terms of

211
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:41,440
nutrients and so forth um it's normally

212
00:10:38,440 --> 00:10:44,000
dry um the betting is the highest

213
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:45,959
quality we're going to have each year so

214
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,959
that we're probably going to start out

215
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:52,560
with using utilizing the least amount at

216
00:10:49,959 --> 00:10:54,880
that time as winter goes on hopefully

217
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:58,279
the Cals are growing the quality of

218
00:10:54,880 --> 00:11:01,399
bending still good we will have the the

219
00:10:58,279 --> 00:11:04,440
occasional snow storms that come through

220
00:11:01,399 --> 00:11:07,880
and big openings on our buildings will

221
00:11:04,440 --> 00:11:10,079
allow U some of that to come in need to

222
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:13,120
adjust and in increase the amount of

223
00:11:10,079 --> 00:11:16,160
bedding when that happens uh

224
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:20,000
spring we're dealing now with bigger

225
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:22,360
cattle normally if we have some uh rain

226
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:25,079
or so forth the bedding is going to be

227
00:11:22,360 --> 00:11:27,880
wet so part of its usefulness has

228
00:11:25,079 --> 00:11:30,040
already been used up we have that thaw

229
00:11:27,880 --> 00:11:32,279
period and high humidity so we're not

230
00:11:30,040 --> 00:11:34,760
going to get the the

231
00:11:32,279 --> 00:11:36,920
evaporation and we do get the frequent

232
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,000
rains so again we're going to have to

233
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:43,320
adjust our Bing

234
00:11:39,000 --> 00:11:45,959
upward now uh the last one is Summer and

235
00:11:43,320 --> 00:11:51,839
I put this on here for the people that

236
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:56,000
have changed from a open feed lot to a

237
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:59,760
beded barn they tell me that the biggest

238
00:11:56,000 --> 00:12:03,120
thing that was a aha moment in in terms

239
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:06,160
of it is you use more bedding in the

240
00:12:03,120 --> 00:12:09,760
summer than you did the fall and winter

241
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:11,800
which is the exact opposite if you beded

242
00:12:09,760 --> 00:12:14,000
in an open lot you beded during the

243
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:17,399
winter but you never did anything during

244
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:20,040
the summer with these facilities to keep

245
00:12:17,399 --> 00:12:23,000
things moving one you've got great big

246
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:27,279
cattle you've got hot conditions the

247
00:12:23,000 --> 00:12:30,160
cattle are drinking more some of the uh

248
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:32,480
feed ingredients we have may contain

249
00:12:30,160 --> 00:12:34,440
some additional sodium some additional

250
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:37,320
things that cause the animals to drink

251
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:41,320
more more drinking is going to produce

252
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:43,800
more urine needs to be soaked up and

253
00:12:41,320 --> 00:12:46,720
often at the very end of the feeding

254
00:12:43,800 --> 00:12:50,079
period we're dealing with deterior

255
00:12:46,720 --> 00:12:55,160
deteriorated bedding it's pretty much

256
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:58,120
used up so they'll often times use 50%

257
00:12:55,160 --> 00:13:00,959
more bedding in the summer than they do

258
00:12:58,120 --> 00:13:04,639
in the winter and did not expect that to

259
00:13:00,959 --> 00:13:06,920
be um when they started out with the

260
00:13:04,639 --> 00:13:09,760
facility uh deep

261
00:13:06,920 --> 00:13:10,959
pits um they're going to be under the

262
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:14,959
the

263
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:17,760
slots um when you look at back to where

264
00:13:14,959 --> 00:13:21,519
we were in terms of how much manure

265
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:23,440
you're producing if you have a 8 to 10t

266
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:26,880
pit you're going to have to pump that

267
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:29,440
out twice a year in order to have the

268
00:13:26,880 --> 00:13:32,399
storage that you need to keep the cattle

269
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,360
in there uh and I don't see anybody

270
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:36,000
that's putting in a deep enough pit to

271
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:39,720
make it through one year so you're going

272
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,959
to plan on doing that it will tend to be

273
00:13:39,720 --> 00:13:43,600
more

274
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:47,440
consistent and you're going to be able

275
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:50,279
to capture that and put that

276
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:52,600
through when you think about building

277
00:13:50,279 --> 00:13:55,360
the building with something that you're

278
00:13:52,600 --> 00:14:00,560
going to be in there at least weekly

279
00:13:55,360 --> 00:14:03,279
probably bi-weekly to uh clean okay and

280
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:05,440
often times with the cattle in there we

281
00:14:03,279 --> 00:14:08,800
need to make sure that we've got curbs

282
00:14:05,440 --> 00:14:11,759
so we can scrape along the edges make it

283
00:14:08,800 --> 00:14:14,160
easy to get done uh push walls for

284
00:14:11,759 --> 00:14:16,800
loading up that manure maybe where we're

285
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:22,360
going to place our Manure Spreader so we

286
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:25,360
can put that all together um and then

287
00:14:22,360 --> 00:14:27,199
also maybe some extra mirrors on the

288
00:14:25,360 --> 00:14:29,519
thing so you can monitor where that

289
00:14:27,199 --> 00:14:32,600
cattle are often times we move moving

290
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:35,680
forward slamming the uh tractor into

291
00:14:32,600 --> 00:14:38,199
reverse after we've load it up a load

292
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:40,920
and often times We're Not Looking Back

293
00:14:38,199 --> 00:14:44,360
where those cattle as they especially

294
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:46,720
get accustomed to the equipment might be

295
00:14:44,360 --> 00:14:49,079
very very close to you and end up

296
00:14:46,720 --> 00:14:54,199
bumping

297
00:14:49,079 --> 00:14:56,880
them uh here's a push wall um and I when

298
00:14:54,199 --> 00:14:59,600
I talk about push walls this is going to

299
00:14:56,880 --> 00:15:03,639
be a reinforced concrete wall

300
00:14:59,600 --> 00:15:07,000
that you can push the loader into it and

301
00:15:03,639 --> 00:15:09,160
not worry about breaking anything okay

302
00:15:07,000 --> 00:15:13,199
and when you think about uh the

303
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:16,000
equipment that you're going to use for

304
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:18,880
uh for building since these buildings

305
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:21,360
are going to last what 30 40

306
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:24,680
years look at the equipment that you

307
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:27,880
would like to own not the equipment that

308
00:15:24,680 --> 00:15:31,399
you now have cuz it how many of you guys

309
00:15:27,880 --> 00:15:31,399
want to buy a small smaller

310
00:15:32,680 --> 00:15:37,440
Tractor No

311
00:15:34,920 --> 00:15:40,440
Hands oh there's a couple hands somebody

312
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:43,519
wants one anyway so make sure you you

313
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:45,639
reinforce it so that you you won't have

314
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:47,759
the problems and think about the

315
00:15:45,639 --> 00:15:49,800
individual you might hire that doesn't

316
00:15:47,759 --> 00:15:53,440
have any experience with the tractor

317
00:15:49,800 --> 00:15:56,680
that might hit the the top of the push

318
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:59,920
wall uh when he slips the his foot off

319
00:15:56,680 --> 00:15:59,920
the clutch

320
00:16:00,560 --> 00:16:06,160
uh here's here is a nice curb along this

321
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:08,680
Edge and you will be moving back and

322
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:10,680
forth along there and think about

323
00:16:08,680 --> 00:16:13,000
especially when you get down into the

324
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:15,399
really tight ones where there's enough

325
00:16:13,000 --> 00:16:16,519
room for the cattle to get back away

326
00:16:15,399 --> 00:16:20,040
from

327
00:16:16,519 --> 00:16:23,720
it Angie if you guys want to know how

328
00:16:20,040 --> 00:16:27,800
big that is Angie right there is our as

329
00:16:23,720 --> 00:16:30,399
our marker um as far as storage inside

330
00:16:27,800 --> 00:16:32,600
the building versus out inside the

331
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:35,880
building of course it's going to be

332
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:38,639
expensive but it's very convenient um to

333
00:16:35,880 --> 00:16:40,480
have some storage inside the building

334
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:43,519
we're probably not going to put it very

335
00:16:40,480 --> 00:16:48,120
much there but uh having a couple weeks

336
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:49,519
is uh nice uh it's under roof it's also

337
00:16:48,120 --> 00:16:53,680
going to be in a place where you're

338
00:16:49,519 --> 00:16:57,519
going to capture everything um can also

339
00:16:53,680 --> 00:17:00,759
put it just outside nice uh push walls

340
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:03,319
here also can contain it makes it

341
00:17:00,759 --> 00:17:05,600
convenient so you can get the job done

342
00:17:03,319 --> 00:17:08,160
even when the weather conditions are

343
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:10,439
poor outside and you need to have be

344
00:17:08,160 --> 00:17:12,240
able to do this in all weather

345
00:17:10,439 --> 00:17:16,559
conditions with

346
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:19,880
bars okay if we move that off site and

347
00:17:16,559 --> 00:17:22,959
uh often times we'll have both but move

348
00:17:19,880 --> 00:17:25,839
it away from the barn uh to the field

349
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:29,799
where it's going to be utilized uh it is

350
00:17:25,839 --> 00:17:32,919
a second place to manage uh and may be

351
00:17:29,799 --> 00:17:36,400
regulations and Community standards and

352
00:17:32,919 --> 00:17:38,080
I'll just say I get calls each year

353
00:17:36,400 --> 00:17:40,080
somebody says they don't want to smell

354
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:44,600
it next to their house so they moved it

355
00:17:40,080 --> 00:17:47,440
out to the field where I'm at um and

356
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:51,240
even if it doesn't quote unquote breed

357
00:17:47,440 --> 00:17:53,720
flies it will attract flies and all I

358
00:17:51,240 --> 00:17:55,000
say is don't put it in front of the

359
00:17:53,720 --> 00:17:57,919
person's

360
00:17:55,000 --> 00:18:01,600
house and we've had that happen before

361
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:05,159
but it does help it normally the uh

362
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:07,760
Fields adjacent to our facilities have

363
00:18:05,159 --> 00:18:10,600
high nutrient contents those fields that

364
00:18:07,760 --> 00:18:13,280
are out a long ways away could really

365
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:15,679
use the p and the K that we are able to

366
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:18,679
capture

367
00:18:15,679 --> 00:18:21,280
from um managing it make sure that we're

368
00:18:18,679 --> 00:18:24,320
not losing it to the

369
00:18:21,280 --> 00:18:25,880
ground uh keep it high and

370
00:18:24,320 --> 00:18:29,480
dry

371
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:33,280
um do not stockpile it and grab

372
00:18:29,480 --> 00:18:37,559
Waterway and minimize the time that it's

373
00:18:33,280 --> 00:18:37,559
out there where we can have losses
