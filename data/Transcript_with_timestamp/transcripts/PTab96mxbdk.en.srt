2
00:00:12,049 --> 00:00:15,719
farmers and ranchers have many

3
00:00:14,450 --> 00:00:18,090
responsibilities

4
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:20,790
two important responsibilities are

5
00:00:18,090 --> 00:00:25,349
producing food and protecting natural

6
00:00:20,790 --> 00:00:28,109
resources such as soil water air plants

7
00:00:25,349 --> 00:00:30,900
and animals these objectives are not

8
00:00:28,109 --> 00:00:34,410
mutually exclusive and in fact often

9
00:00:30,900 --> 00:00:36,150
complement each other even so producers

10
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:38,820
do have to balance the ways in which

11
00:00:36,150 --> 00:00:41,730
they allocate time money and other

12
00:00:38,820 --> 00:00:43,290
resources this video explores how

13
00:00:41,730 --> 00:00:45,840
producers balance and achieve

14
00:00:43,290 --> 00:00:49,260
environmental goals while managing

15
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:51,629
animals crops and business this video

16
00:00:49,260 --> 00:00:53,690
introduces some general conservation

17
00:00:51,629 --> 00:00:56,340
practices while outlining specific

18
00:00:53,690 --> 00:00:59,129
practices that are relevant to animal

19
00:00:56,340 --> 00:01:02,370
production manure management and air and

20
00:00:59,129 --> 00:01:04,649
water quality it also highlights the

21
00:01:02,370 --> 00:01:06,899
technical and financial assistance that

22
00:01:04,649 --> 00:01:09,700
may be available for producers to apply

23
00:01:06,899 --> 00:01:12,070
conservation practices

24
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:14,320
such assistance is offered through the

25
00:01:12,070 --> 00:01:17,700
US Department of Agriculture's Natural

26
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,679
Resources Conservation Service or NRCS

27
00:01:17,700 --> 00:01:23,530
local Soil and Water Conservation

28
00:01:19,679 --> 00:01:27,240
districts or s WCS and other federal

29
00:01:23,530 --> 00:01:27,240
state and local programs

30
00:01:30,650 --> 00:01:35,550
conservation on farms is based on

31
00:01:33,210 --> 00:01:38,060
maintaining or improving productive

32
00:01:35,550 --> 00:01:40,860
agricultural lands and natural resources

33
00:01:38,060 --> 00:01:43,800
farms and ranches of all types and sizes

34
00:01:40,860 --> 00:01:46,560
can benefit from NRCS conservation

35
00:01:43,800 --> 00:01:48,630
practices to improve or preserve soil

36
00:01:46,560 --> 00:01:52,850
health air and water quality and

37
00:01:48,630 --> 00:01:55,549
wildlife habitat on and around farms

38
00:01:52,850 --> 00:01:58,430
these components make up productive and

39
00:01:55,549 --> 00:02:01,190
functional ecosystems which in turn have

40
00:01:58,430 --> 00:02:05,409
economic environmental and community

41
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:05,409
value that extends beyond the farm

42
00:02:05,619 --> 00:02:11,860
with these elements of sustainability in

43
00:02:08,140 --> 00:02:13,390
mind NRCS and others support producers

44
00:02:11,860 --> 00:02:15,900
as they make decisions about

45
00:02:13,390 --> 00:02:18,610
conservation practices for their farms

46
00:02:15,900 --> 00:02:20,550
although certain conservation practices

47
00:02:18,610 --> 00:02:23,260
are implemented to help meet regulatory

48
00:02:20,550 --> 00:02:26,500
requirements the majority are adopted

49
00:02:23,260 --> 00:02:28,690
voluntarily but even when required the

50
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:30,430
specific combinations of measures are

51
00:02:28,690 --> 00:02:33,129
usually chosen by the producers

52
00:02:30,430 --> 00:02:37,150
themselves to meet individual needs and

53
00:02:33,129 --> 00:02:39,819
site-specific conditions many NRCS

54
00:02:37,150 --> 00:02:43,200
conservation practices apply to animal

55
00:02:39,819 --> 00:02:46,360
agriculture for example producers can

56
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:48,220
store manure and plan application to

57
00:02:46,360 --> 00:02:50,379
achieve the right amount in form of

58
00:02:48,220 --> 00:02:54,250
nutrients at the right time in the right

59
00:02:50,379 --> 00:02:56,349
place for growing crops manage livestock

60
00:02:54,250 --> 00:03:00,370
grazing to promote healthy soil and

61
00:02:56,349 --> 00:03:01,480
vegetation and plant cover crops to

62
00:03:00,370 --> 00:03:04,810
retain topsoil

63
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:07,420
and reduce nutrient losses such

64
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:09,430
practices support productive livestock

65
00:03:07,420 --> 00:03:12,040
and cropping systems while also

66
00:03:09,430 --> 00:03:16,000
protecting water quality and promoting

67
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:18,370
soil health conservation practices have

68
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:21,099
the potential to significantly benefit

69
00:03:18,370 --> 00:03:22,900
Natural Resources although some

70
00:03:21,099 --> 00:03:25,690
practices can save money in the long

71
00:03:22,900 --> 00:03:28,209
term by reducing fuel or fertilizer use

72
00:03:25,690 --> 00:03:31,019
they can also require the producer to

73
00:03:28,209 --> 00:03:33,340
invest financial resources upfront

74
00:03:31,019 --> 00:03:35,169
farmers and ranchers can access

75
00:03:33,340 --> 00:03:37,930
technical and financial assistance

76
00:03:35,169 --> 00:03:39,970
through their local and rcs office to

77
00:03:37,930 --> 00:03:43,680
help offset the cost of implementing

78
00:03:39,970 --> 00:03:43,680
certain conservation practices

79
00:03:43,860 --> 00:03:50,430
the local NRCS office is a valuable

80
00:03:46,950 --> 00:03:52,500
resource where NRCS and conservation

81
00:03:50,430 --> 00:03:55,200
district staff technical service

82
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:57,900
providers and other local partners work

83
00:03:55,200 --> 00:04:00,650
directly with producers to select design

84
00:03:57,900 --> 00:04:04,110
and implement conservation practices

85
00:04:00,650 --> 00:04:05,940
they ensure conservation practices not

86
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:08,040
only follow the state's technical

87
00:04:05,940 --> 00:04:10,110
standards but are also carefully

88
00:04:08,040 --> 00:04:13,740
customized to account for the unique

89
00:04:10,110 --> 00:04:16,820
soils location management and needs of

90
00:04:13,740 --> 00:04:19,170
an individual farm there is rarely a

91
00:04:16,820 --> 00:04:22,290
one-size-fits-all approach when it comes

92
00:04:19,170 --> 00:04:24,630
to conservation practices tailoring

93
00:04:22,290 --> 00:04:27,020
conservation practices to the specific

94
00:04:24,630 --> 00:04:29,310
farm and local resource concerns

95
00:04:27,020 --> 00:04:33,480
maximizes the benefits to Natural

96
00:04:29,310 --> 00:04:36,150
Resources NRCS and the producer develop

97
00:04:33,480 --> 00:04:39,000
a contract that specifies exactly what

98
00:04:36,150 --> 00:04:41,340
will be done to the site and when the

99
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:43,260
contract also specifies the amount of

100
00:04:41,340 --> 00:04:45,810
financial assistance provided to the

101
00:04:43,260 --> 00:04:50,160
producer the assistance can come from a

102
00:04:45,810 --> 00:04:53,350
variety of sources in addition to NRCS

103
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:55,570
nrcs the conservation district or other

104
00:04:53,350 --> 00:04:57,360
partners continue to provide technical

105
00:04:55,570 --> 00:05:00,130
assistance throughout the process

106
00:04:57,360 --> 00:05:02,210
checking in on the progress and quality

107
00:05:00,130 --> 00:05:05,360
of the work

108

more specific details on some practices

109
00:05:05,360 --> 00:05:10,070
used on animal agriculture operations

110
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,850
are presented in the next video in this

111
00:05:10,070 --> 00:05:15,680
module conservation practices are one of

112
00:05:13,850 --> 00:05:18,740
several ways that farmers and ranchers

113
00:05:15,680 --> 00:05:21,139
work towards sustainability to ensure

114
00:05:18,740 --> 00:05:23,570
productive agriculture and healthy

115
00:05:21,139 --> 00:05:24,220
natural resources for generations to
