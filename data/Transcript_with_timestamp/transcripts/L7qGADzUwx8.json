  "text": "hey everyone this is IA roadkill and i am going to attempt to explain how to use the crop rotation planner for seasons in farming simulator 19 I need to add a disclaimer right now I play on the PlayStation 4 I do not have access to seasons I've watched numerous videos and I can see that everyone is struggling with the idea I think I might know how it's done so I'm gonna make this video I invite people that are on the PC to try my method see if it works and let me know if I have mentioned something incorrectly I will correct it that way we have a good video out there on how to set up your planner so let's get started I don't have access to the game so I'm using a spreadsheet on my Mac so here is my number little page that I built your crop rotation is vertical going from the top down step 1 pick a field to plan so for this example we're gonna say it's called field 1 go to the field and look at the history for that field I believe it will say 2 years prior what it had last year and what it had the year before that keep a mental note of those two crops step two key in the history for the field field one in this case now before you do any plowing I don't know if it would remove the history if you plowed or not by keying in the history I mean go to the first open field at the top on the left's call left column which we're calling field one and key in the crop that would have been the oldest or two years ago in this case we're gonna say that it was fallow in the next field down you want to key in the prior year or last year's what was in the ground right now what can you see his stubble and for this example we'll say it was wheat we don't know that it was wheat but it would be labeled as cereal so pick something that was a cereal crop you now have the history of that field in your system so that you can start a good plan step 3 start adding your crop ideas for this year on the next open slot you want to look for the best percentage on the column to the right of that one point zero zero being neutral one point two being better 0.9 being worse you want to get the highest number possible of a fruit or crop that you want in the next year play around with different crops and see what you can get for the highest percentage remember that this slot is for what you are going to plant this spring step 4 repeat step 3 for your year 2 of the game in other words go to the next box down and you want to try different crops until you get the best percentage for that year now repeat step 4 until you have your sheet filled out for as many years as you want if your rotation only has 3 years of different crops that's fine you don't have to use all of them but there are up to six spaces remember you can only use four of your own crops at the present time because we have two crops in history at the top you at this point you have the first field field one planned for the next four years and it would be time to plan field number two which is the next one to the right field number three which is the third one field number four which would be the fourth one or the farthest one to the right we're not going to fill those in right now we'll just pretend you only have one field and that's all you're concerned about after year one is over in other words you're in spring one of year two okay or you could do it in winter but it's easier to explain if you are in the next year or spring one step eight is to move all the planner entries up one line so you're going to remove line one history field from step number two and move everything up the next step is to add the next crop idea in this case it would be for year five to get the best percentage after year two is over in other words spring one of year three you'll want to repeat this last steps again move all your planner entries up one line removing line one history of field from step two and add another crop idea in this last open slot cleared out again remember you don't have to add all of them but you may as you enter this last time keep an eye on what that's going to do to your year one that is now at the top of the list it will affect your rotation when you start this over again remember that this is only a planner for your benefit it does not affect how the game runs I hope this hasn't been too confusing I hope it has simplified how the procedure would work again if you have any suggestions please leave them in the comments and I can correct any errors that I have made I'd like to thank everyone who stayed to watch the entire video if you found it enjoyable or educational I would appreciate it if you would hit that like button and also hit that subscribe button I'd like to wish everyone including you a very wonderful day good bye for now you",
