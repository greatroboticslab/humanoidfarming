00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:07,520
hello

2
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:09,440
my name is brian parman i'm the ag

3
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,840
finance specialist in the department of

4
00:00:09,440 --> 00:00:13,920
ag business and applied economics i work

5
00:00:11,840 --> 00:00:16,160
in for extension

6
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:17,440
and today as you can see from the title

7
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:19,920
slide i'm going to be talking about

8
00:00:17,440 --> 00:00:21,840
backgrounding budgets and profits

9
00:00:19,920 --> 00:00:24,560
this particular talk we're going to be

10
00:00:21,840 --> 00:00:27,119
looking at steers and heifers

11
00:00:24,560 --> 00:00:28,240
running looking at several scenarios in

12
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:30,480
terms of

13
00:00:28,240 --> 00:00:32,160
average daily rates of gain

14
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,480
um as as

15
00:00:32,160 --> 00:00:36,880
so different feed rations as well as

16
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:39,200
fattening or growing them up to

17
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,800
different weights for both heifers and

18
00:00:39,200 --> 00:00:43,280
steers

19
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:46,000
using current feed costs and prices as

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:49,280
well as current market prices

21
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:50,879
and so as i go through this uh obviously

22
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:52,399
keep in mind that

23
00:00:50,879 --> 00:00:55,120
um

24
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:59,280
what we're trying to do here is is see

25
00:00:55,120 --> 00:01:02,480
both a if there's some money to be made

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:04,879
fattening or or background in calves

27
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:06,799
as well as what is the sort of the

28
00:01:04,879 --> 00:01:09,040
optimal scenario and that's kind of what

29
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:10,640
i'm what i'm hoping to hit on uh and

30
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:13,439
again this is a lot of these are

31
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:15,680
projections so when i go through the

32
00:01:13,439 --> 00:01:17,680
prices here we're taking today's prices

33
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,840
and just kind of projecting

34
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:22,720
with no real

35
00:01:19,840 --> 00:01:26,600
expectation of of price movement too

36
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,600
much one way or another

37
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:32,799
all right so compared to last year and i

38
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,400
gave this a similar talk uh last year on

39
00:01:32,799 --> 00:01:36,000
backgrounding budgets and did some

40
00:01:34,400 --> 00:01:38,479
different scenarios but

41
00:01:36,000 --> 00:01:40,960
the the feeds the feed price situation

42
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,720
is a bit different this year

43
00:01:40,960 --> 00:01:44,960
for one thing

44
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:47,520
fall crop prices are much higher this

45
00:01:44,960 --> 00:01:49,360
year than they were last fall

46
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:51,040
we had a situation here in north dakota

47
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:52,640
last fall where we had a lot of low

48
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:55,200
quality wheat

49
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,960
that our our farmers weren't really sure

50
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:59,119
what to do with and you might have been

51
00:01:56,960 --> 00:02:02,079
able to purchase some of that and feed

52
00:01:59,119 --> 00:02:04,640
it uh at a relatively low cost

53
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,000
hay prices are are

54
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,879
slightly

55
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,640
elevated for for like grass hay a little

56
00:02:08,879 --> 00:02:12,400
bit lower for alfalfa hay and i'll show

57
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:14,720
you that in a minute trucking and

58
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:16,959
shipping costs and yardage costs uh in

59
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:18,560
these scenarios uh remain mostly the

60
00:02:16,959 --> 00:02:20,480
same as last year

61
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:22,480
not a lot of movement in those those

62
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:24,640
costs and then cattle prices for feeder

63
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:27,040
cattle are a bit higher than last year

64
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:28,560
but not dramatically uh we're kind of

65
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:31,040
you know if you'd uh

66
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:32,319
looked at prices last spring you know we

67
00:02:31,040 --> 00:02:34,560
might have been thinking that feeder

68
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:37,200
calves were going to be fairly cheap but

69
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:39,120
prices rebounded uh quite a bit and so

70
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:40,959
this fall we're kind of we're in a

71
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,840
similar situation where we were last

72
00:02:40,959 --> 00:02:43,760
fall

73
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:45,360
around this time in terms of the price

74
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,800
of feeder calves

75
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,200
so when you're thinking about

76
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
backgrounding obviously whether you keep

77
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:52,879
your own or you're going in and

78
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:55,519
purchasing them we charge ourselves the

79
00:02:52,879 --> 00:02:58,159
market price for whatever 500 or 600

80
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,560
weight calf that we're we're retaining

81
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,000
because obviously you could have if they

82
00:03:00,560 --> 00:03:03,760
were your own you could have taken them

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:05,680
down the road and sold them and and

84
00:03:03,760 --> 00:03:07,760
received whatever whatever the market

85
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:10,400
price was so you got to obviously charge

86
00:03:07,760 --> 00:03:11,680
yourself that

87
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,920
so

88
00:03:11,680 --> 00:03:15,440
this is the corn pr price of corn i was

89
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:18,720
talking about and i just wanted to show

90
00:03:15,440 --> 00:03:20,800
a chart of corn prices uh and this is on

91
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:22,239
a continuous contract basis over the

92
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:24,239
last three years

93
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:27,040
and this fall

94
00:03:24,239 --> 00:03:29,920
you know if you see here on the right

95
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:32,560
um is not not uh not the peak the peak

96
00:03:29,920 --> 00:03:34,879
was uh there in 2019

97
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:37,640
uh especially the early part of 2019

98
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,200
where we had that

99
00:03:37,640 --> 00:03:43,519
4.54.80 corn for a for a period of time

100
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,680
we're not nearly that high obviously the

101
00:03:43,519 --> 00:03:48,480
beginning of 2020 when the pandemic hit

102
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:51,280
for covid uh corn prices went down to

103
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:54,879
nearly three dollars but here this fall

104
00:03:51,280 --> 00:03:56,720
we're seeing in over four bucks so

105
00:03:54,879 --> 00:03:59,360
and then if you compare it to last fall

106
00:03:56,720 --> 00:04:01,920
it was more like 380 so corn prices are

107
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:03,680
elevated uh relative to last year that's

108
00:04:01,920 --> 00:04:07,120
that's for sure

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:10,239
so this is this here is the 2020 alfalfa

110
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:12,480
prices from usda uh this they just they

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,920
collect average prices for uh and then

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,199
they rate it premium good fare

113
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,199
what we would typically what you'd

114
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,600
probably typically feed beef cattle is

115
00:04:19,199 --> 00:04:22,800
going to be in that good or fair range

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:25,120
um so

117
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,880
our near our nearest neighbors south

118
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,720
dakota for good hay

119
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:33,280
128 to 180 bucks a ton and then for fair

120
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:37,600
a lower protein content maybe closer to

121
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:40,240
uh 16 percent or or 14 protein 103 to

122
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:42,479
113 dollars per ton

123
00:04:40,240 --> 00:04:46,160
um for alfalfa and then we also have

124
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:48,080
montana here uh similar uh maybe

125
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:50,560
about the same as as what you're gonna

126
00:04:48,080 --> 00:04:53,360
see in south dakota so i'd use those as

127
00:04:50,560 --> 00:04:55,759
a proxy for for hay prices across north

128
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:57,520
dakota is these uh these montana and

129
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:58,400
south dakota prices which are tracked

130
00:04:57,520 --> 00:04:59,360
here

131
00:04:58,400 --> 00:05:00,960
and and

132
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,840
again i'm going to show you on the next

133
00:05:00,960 --> 00:05:07,360
slide but how alfalfa price is down

134
00:05:03,840 --> 00:05:08,639
perhaps a little bit uh over last year

135
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:12,080
and here it is

136
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:15,039
2019 versus 2020 alfalfa hay prices

137
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:20,400
here's november 12 2019

138
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:23,680
we had uh montana at you know 110 to 180

139
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:25,039
and then 80 to 150 on this end so again

140
00:05:23,680 --> 00:05:26,720
it's a range but they're not

141
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:28,639
dramatically different and then if we

142
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:32,639
look uh here

143
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:36,000
and then also south dakota 175 to 225

144
00:05:32,639 --> 00:05:38,479
and then this year 128 to 180 so alfalfa

145
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:40,880
is is lower especially the south dakota

146
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,680
market than than what was seen last year

147
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:42,960
so

148
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:45,280
if you're thinking about feeding

149
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:47,520
obviously feed costs are a big deal

150
00:05:45,280 --> 00:05:49,840
they're extremely important so we have a

151
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,120
higher price of corn this year

152
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:55,360
and a lower price in alfalfa

153
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:58,000
and then grass hay grass hay prices are

154
00:05:55,360 --> 00:06:00,240
similar to last year's prices but again

155
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,319
they're slightly elevated

156
00:06:00,240 --> 00:06:05,039
for whatever reason alfalfa is a bit

157
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:06,880
cheaper than last year grass type hay is

158
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:09,120
a bit more expensive than last year but

159
00:06:06,880 --> 00:06:11,600
not dramatically so pretty much your

160
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,600
your hay costs i would expect them to be

161
00:06:11,600 --> 00:06:15,680
roughly if you did any background in

162
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:16,960
last year roughly what they were uh the

163
00:06:15,680 --> 00:06:18,800
year before

164
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:20,880
corn on the other hand not so much with

165
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,199
with corn prices being as elevated as

166
00:06:20,880 --> 00:06:23,199
they are

167
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:28,880
so here's my cost price assumptions as

168
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:31,039
i'm as i go through this is i've got

169
00:06:28,880 --> 00:06:34,000
grass hay at 75 bucks a ton we're going

170
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:37,199
to be using you know the high-end affair

171
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:40,240
to good uh alfalfa hay prices here's

172
00:06:37,199 --> 00:06:42,400
corn silage corn grain at 380 a bushel

173
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,759
um that would be if you know if you're

174
00:06:42,400 --> 00:06:46,319
growing it and you're looking at cash

175
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:47,600
prices yes i know spot was closer to 420

176
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,599
but cash

177
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:55,440
you're not going to get that not up here

178
00:06:49,599 --> 00:06:57,520
so 380 ddgs 160 a ton limestone bag salt

179
00:06:55,440 --> 00:06:59,680
and then some pre-mix yardage we're

180
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,919
charging 35 cents a day that's what they

181
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:03,759
charge at carrington

182
00:07:01,919 --> 00:07:05,599
we have this budget online that i'm

183
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,080
going to be going through and you can

184
00:07:05,599 --> 00:07:10,720
change the yardage if you want to and

185
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:12,720
and you you may see other budgets

186
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,960
that have much higher or much lower

187
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:17,199
yardage fees it really depends on how

188
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:19,759
they break out the cost i've seen some

189
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:21,360
instances where feed costs are included

190
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:23,840
in the yardage so you'll see this really

191
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:26,160
high yardage cost of maybe a dollar

192
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:27,840
fifty a day or something like that well

193
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,720
if you throw the lump the feed in there

194
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:32,560
then that makes sense trump trucking at

195
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,000
about 75 cents a hundred weight and then

196
00:07:32,560 --> 00:07:36,080
you got your vet costs and i'm just

197
00:07:34,000 --> 00:07:37,680
going to use a shrink and death loss of

198
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:41,599
three percent and one percent

199
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:44,160
respectively as we go through here

200
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,479
so six different scenarios uh three

201
00:07:44,160 --> 00:07:49,520
steer scenarios and three heifer

202
00:07:46,479 --> 00:07:52,479
i'm gonna do the the first deer one is a

203
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:54,639
1.8 pounds 80 average daily gain and

204
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:57,520
we're feeding from a 500 weight and to

205
00:07:54,639 --> 00:08:00,560
an 800 weight and then 2.8 pounds on a

206
00:07:57,520 --> 00:08:02,879
steer from 525 weight to 805

207
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,720
and then this one we're basically

208
00:08:02,879 --> 00:08:07,759
finishing going all the way from a calf

209
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:09,919
to 1270 pounds at a really high rate of

210
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:12,319
gain of 3.6 pounds

211
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:15,599
and then heifers uh we're running two

212
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:19,120
scenarios at 1.8 pound uh adg

213
00:08:15,599 --> 00:08:20,960
and that's from 450 to 750 and then 550

214
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:22,800
to 850.

215
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:25,440
okay so that's 1.8 pound and then a

216
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:28,319
higher rate of gain uh 2.8 pounds from

217
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:30,639
525 to 805 on the heifers

218
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:32,159
so i'm going to go through these

219
00:08:30,639 --> 00:08:36,399
six scenarios and we're going to look at

220
00:08:32,159 --> 00:08:38,000
the profitability uh under each case

221
00:08:36,399 --> 00:08:39,599
so we'll start with steers we'll just

222
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,919
run through the the steer feeding

223
00:08:39,599 --> 00:08:43,599
scenarios first and then and then again

224
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:46,080
we'll go through the the heifer

225
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:48,160
scenarios

226
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,160
all right so the prices that i'm using

227
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:53,519
are from the uh

228
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:57,040
usda auction summary for north dakota

229
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:59,600
so here's the average across the state a

230
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,120
summary ending november 13th so when

231
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:04,000
you're thinking about okay so what am i

232
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,000
going to put in for my cost of a 500

233
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:09,279
weight steer i'm going to put them at

234
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:11,680
167 dollars a piece that was the average

235
00:09:09,279 --> 00:09:14,240
so if i'm going to background the steer

236
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:16,080
my upfront cost is going to be 167

237
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:18,160
dollars per hundred weight and then when

238
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:20,399
i go to put in the

239
00:09:18,160 --> 00:09:22,720
actual prices or the the revenue

240
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:26,160
expectation let's say we're going to

241
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:29,200
uh 850 pounds roughly i'm going to use

242
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:31,120
this 139 uh dollar range now if i'm

243
00:09:29,200 --> 00:09:33,920
going to 800 weight

244
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:35,519
now maybe one i'm going to use this 128.

245
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:40,160
so if i'm going to 800 pounds i'd use

246
00:09:35,519 --> 00:09:43,040
this 128 at uh 850 800 plus

247
00:09:40,160 --> 00:09:44,880
or 850 plus this 139

248
00:09:43,040 --> 00:09:46,959
and then for the finished one

249
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:49,839
uh the the last scenario where they get

250
00:09:46,959 --> 00:09:51,519
really where we feed them up to 1270

251
00:09:49,839 --> 00:09:53,200
pounds i'm gonna use this hundred and

252
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,920
twenty seven dollars per hundred weight

253
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:58,480
right here i had to cut this off and and

254
00:09:55,920 --> 00:10:00,880
attach it because the there isn't a ton

255
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:04,560
of these sales so i'm not sure how

256
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:06,320
strong this 127 dollars is but uh you

257
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:08,000
know we could look around if we really

258
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:09,519
wanted to get more detailed but again

259
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,680
we're projecting because that animal is

260
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,360
going to be on feed for a while so you

261
00:10:11,680 --> 00:10:16,240
could go through with your own budget

262
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:18,959
there and play with that number that 127

263
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:21,360
and move it down say seven bucks or up

264
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,440
ten bucks and and it would really uh

265
00:10:21,360 --> 00:10:25,040
make a difference in your bottom line

266
00:10:23,440 --> 00:10:26,720
but for this presentation since we're

267
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:27,839
already doing multiple scenarios i

268
00:10:26,720 --> 00:10:30,240
didn't

269
00:10:27,839 --> 00:10:31,440
run that so that would be an interesting

270
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:34,000
thing to do

271
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,680
is once you decide maybe after you watch

272
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:38,079
this and you do some thinking on your

273
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:39,560
own operation you decide okay i'm gonna

274
00:10:38,079 --> 00:10:44,000
uh background

275
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:46,480
525 up to 850 pound steers uh i would go

276
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:49,200
in there and play with the

277
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:50,640
expected sale price uh per 100 weight

278
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,800
there at the end

279
00:10:50,640 --> 00:10:55,600
and move that around once you decide on

280
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:58,000
which scenario suits you best and see

281
00:10:55,600 --> 00:11:00,000
exactly how how much prices can move one

282
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:02,399
way or another and you still make a

283
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:04,959
profit or or how much the the loss would

284
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:04,959
actually be

285
00:11:05,440 --> 00:11:12,800
so here's the 525 to 850 pound scenario

286
00:11:09,360 --> 00:11:16,399
uh a 1.8 pound average daily gain see it

287
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:18,560
here and this is the ration um that was

288
00:11:16,399 --> 00:11:20,480
put forth and and i have to thank carl

289
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:22,560
hoppy for putting these uh ration

290
00:11:20,480 --> 00:11:25,040
scenarios together for me based on what

291
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:28,640
i what i needed him to do

292
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:31,120
and so he had it uh we've got

293
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,680
10 pounds per head per day in grass hay

294
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,440
17 and silage two and a half pounds of

295
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,440
ddgs

296
00:11:35,440 --> 00:11:39,920
and then a little bit of salt and then

297
00:11:37,440 --> 00:11:42,880
this comes out to about 88 cents a day

298
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,320
for this for this scenario

299
00:11:42,880 --> 00:11:46,800
okay

300
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:48,800
so then when i put it into the budget

301
00:11:46,800 --> 00:11:50,240
spreadsheet and there's a lot of stuff

302
00:11:48,800 --> 00:11:52,399
when you look at this budget there's a

303
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:55,279
lot of stuff below this return to labor

304
00:11:52,399 --> 00:11:57,920
is management risk i cut all that off

305
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:00,639
because what it adds up to are these

306
00:11:57,920 --> 00:12:02,079
these prices in here anyway so i just

307
00:12:00,639 --> 00:12:03,760
this way it fit on the slide better and

308
00:12:02,079 --> 00:12:04,480
you can see it

309
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:06,519
but

310
00:12:04,480 --> 00:12:10,720
i used that projected selling price of

311
00:12:06,519 --> 00:12:12,079
139. my beginning value was 167 as

312
00:12:10,720 --> 00:12:14,240
you'll recall

313
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:17,600
and then we got the shrink shrinking

314
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:19,600
death loss down here so weaned at 525

315
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:21,120
and we're feeding them up to 850 pounds

316
00:12:19,600 --> 00:12:24,800
that animal is going to be on feed for

317
00:12:21,120 --> 00:12:26,480
180 days to achieve that at a 1.8 pound

318
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:29,040
average daily gain

319
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:29,920
and we basically get a profit

320
00:12:29,040 --> 00:12:31,680
of

321
00:12:29,920 --> 00:12:34,240
13.28

322
00:12:31,680 --> 00:12:36,880
so that's that's pretty pretty slim

323
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:39,760
margin there on backgrounding under this

324
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:41,519
scenario here this 1.8 pound average

325
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:43,839
daily gain

326
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,839
all right

327
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:48,800
so our next scenario is this 500 pound

328
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,839
to 800 pound

329
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:52,880
steer

330
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:55,519
and we're gonna feed them to uh achieve

331
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:56,560
a 2.8 pounds average daily gain and we

332
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:58,959
see here

333
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:02,079
that they're gonna again i have this uh

334
00:12:58,959 --> 00:13:05,279
grass legume hay silage corn corn grain

335
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:07,800
ddgs and then some salt for about 35

336
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:10,240
pounds total of feed

337
00:13:07,800 --> 00:13:11,680
35.071 if you include the salt

338
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,040
and obviously it's going to be more

339
00:13:11,680 --> 00:13:18,560
expensive to feed this animal per day

340
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:21,040
at a dollar and six cents estimated cost

341
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:24,880
to achieve this 2.8 pounds and we're

342
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:27,440
going from 500 to 800 weight

343
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,959
and then what you have here okay is so

344
00:13:27,440 --> 00:13:32,000
we're starting at this 500 weaning

345
00:13:28,959 --> 00:13:33,600
weight uh the cost is still about 167

346
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:35,920
dollars that's roughly what it was for

347
00:13:33,600 --> 00:13:37,760
those 500 to 550s for just same

348
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:39,680
projected selling price

349
00:13:37,760 --> 00:13:41,279
because we're talking about that 800

350
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:43,519
plus range

351
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:45,360
feed cost of a dollar six here's my

352
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:47,199
yardage i always have it highlighted but

353
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:49,360
that's where it is at that 35 cents so

354
00:13:47,199 --> 00:13:53,120
in this case we're making 72 dollars per

355
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:53,920
head um by by getting that 2.8 pounds on

356
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,000
there

357
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:57,760
and while we're selling at similar

358
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:59,120
weights and we're purchasing at the

359
00:13:57,760 --> 00:14:01,760
similar price

360
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:05,600
uh putting on all that weight faster

361
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:08,079
essentially we get a lower yardage cost

362
00:14:05,600 --> 00:14:10,639
not not in uh

363
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:13,120
cents per day but in total cost because

364
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:16,240
you see this animal is only on feed for

365
00:14:13,120 --> 00:14:19,040
for a 108 days versus that other one

366
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:21,040
that was on feed for 180 days right so

367
00:14:19,040 --> 00:14:23,839
then that that yardage fee just keeps

368
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:25,680
adding up i mean it's 80 percent longer

369
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:27,760
that you're feeding that animal and the

370
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,639
labor and everything that goes into it

371
00:14:27,760 --> 00:14:30,800
so

372
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:33,199
what this is showing is that relative to

373
00:14:30,800 --> 00:14:35,199
like yardage costs and other things

374
00:14:33,199 --> 00:14:37,120
feed costs even though corn is higher

375
00:14:35,199 --> 00:14:39,279
are not all that high

376
00:14:37,120 --> 00:14:42,399
they're not prohibitively high so

377
00:14:39,279 --> 00:14:44,079
putting on the weight here is fa faster

378
00:14:42,399 --> 00:14:46,880
actually pays quite a bit more and

379
00:14:44,079 --> 00:14:48,240
you're looking at 72 dollars ahead

380
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:49,440
and again some some of the stuff i'm

381
00:14:48,240 --> 00:14:51,279
putting in here for costs is

382
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:53,440
conservative you might be able to do

383
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:55,199
better um uh

384
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,040
pay uh given what you're going to have

385
00:14:55,199 --> 00:14:58,560
to pay this year

386
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:00,800
we we try to be

387
00:14:58,560 --> 00:15:02,560
realistic but a little conservative with

388
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,800
some of this so again seventy two

389
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,760
dollars and three cents

390
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:10,240
okay so this is the the finisher uh

391
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:12,959
scenario where we're going for a

392
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:14,079
predicted date average daily gain of 3.6

393
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:17,519
pounds

394
00:15:14,079 --> 00:15:19,519
um this animal we're going from a 575

395
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:22,959
way to 1270

396
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:24,320
and that animal is going to average 34.4

397
00:15:22,959 --> 00:15:25,920
pounds per day

398
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:27,600
and the dollar per head per day

399
00:15:25,920 --> 00:15:29,759
obviously is quite a bit higher at a

400
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:30,480
dollar 53 a day

401
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:32,399
so

402
00:15:30,480 --> 00:15:34,720
this this critter is going to be on feed

403
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:36,959
for quite a while to get there and it's

404
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:40,399
going to be a fairly um

405
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:43,040
strong ration to be able to achieve 3.6

406
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:45,440
pounds per day

407
00:15:43,040 --> 00:15:47,199
and here it is uh broken out on on the

408
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:48,959
spreadsheet and so this projected

409
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:49,639
selling price changes

410
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:52,079
to

411
00:15:49,639 --> 00:15:53,440
127 dollars per hundred weight so less

412
00:15:52,079 --> 00:15:55,199
than the others because because he's

413
00:15:53,440 --> 00:15:56,720
heavier

414
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,839
the beginning value is a little bit

415
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,079
lower

416
00:15:57,839 --> 00:16:01,839
because it's in the 575 you're getting

417
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:05,680
close to the 600 weight category so

418
00:16:01,839 --> 00:16:07,480
that's 127 dollars right now

419
00:16:05,680 --> 00:16:10,880
this animal is going to be on feed for

420
00:16:07,480 --> 00:16:13,199
193 days to achieve 1270

421
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,399
to go from 575 to

422
00:16:13,199 --> 00:16:18,720
12 70 193 days but the profit on this is

423
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:21,040
almost 250 dollars ahead

424
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:23,040
so it the animal is on feed for a long

425
00:16:21,040 --> 00:16:24,320
time this steer is but you're putting on

426
00:16:23,040 --> 00:16:26,399
a lot of weight

427
00:16:24,320 --> 00:16:28,880
and so this is this is again showing

428
00:16:26,399 --> 00:16:30,800
that being able to put the weight on

429
00:16:28,880 --> 00:16:32,000
right now is definitely profitable and

430
00:16:30,800 --> 00:16:35,360
you're talking about two hundred and

431
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:37,240
fifty dollars ahead uh profit uh by by

432
00:16:35,360 --> 00:16:39,120
feeding this animal all the way out to

433
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:41,279
1270 pounds

434
00:16:39,120 --> 00:16:43,839
at a very hot ration now

435
00:16:41,279 --> 00:16:46,160
i don't i don't have this scenario run

436
00:16:43,839 --> 00:16:48,399
but i can guarantee you if you drop this

437
00:16:46,160 --> 00:16:51,040
3.6

438
00:16:48,399 --> 00:16:52,560
to a lower value 2.8 or 1.8 or something

439
00:16:51,040 --> 00:16:55,040
like that and then he has to stay on

440
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:56,880
feed a whole lot longer this profit will

441
00:16:55,040 --> 00:16:59,199
go down quite a bit

442
00:16:56,880 --> 00:17:00,399
so right now it's showing definitely

443
00:16:59,199 --> 00:17:01,759
that it pays

444
00:17:00,399 --> 00:17:05,839
to to

445
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:05,839
put the weight on as quickly as possible

446
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:10,720
so then the next three scenarios we're

447
00:17:08,959 --> 00:17:12,799
going to go through and and again i'm

448
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:14,880
gonna at the end i have a table that i'm

449
00:17:12,799 --> 00:17:16,799
gonna show that compares all six

450
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:19,039
scenarios so we can look at them side by

451
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,799
side as i go through this but in this uh

452
00:17:19,039 --> 00:17:24,319
the next three are going to be a heifer

453
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:26,480
backgrounding scenarios that uh

454
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:29,280
carl hoppy also put the put the feed

455
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:31,520
ration together for me uh and and i'm

456
00:17:29,280 --> 00:17:35,039
gonna go through the same budgetary

457
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,160
budgetary discussion with this

458
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:38,400
so

459
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:41,039
media i use that same

460
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:43,440
usda auction prices for the week ending

461
00:17:41,039 --> 00:17:45,280
november 13th in north dakota this is

462
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:48,000
what i have

463
00:17:45,280 --> 00:17:48,960
nothing really over 766 weights so i

464
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:51,120
have to

465
00:17:48,960 --> 00:17:53,200
finish it out there i'll use that price

466
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:55,840
and then for the um

467
00:17:53,200 --> 00:17:57,679
the values or the costs of retaining the

468
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:59,919
animal or going and buying them

469
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:02,000
that obviously comes in here quite a bit

470
00:17:59,919 --> 00:18:03,919
cheaper than steers right now

471
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:05,679
the price slide for heifers was pretty

472
00:18:03,919 --> 00:18:08,080
pretty severe this fall

473
00:18:05,679 --> 00:18:09,760
with you know almost 30 40 difference

474
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:12,400
between heifers and steers per hundred

475
00:18:09,760 --> 00:18:12,400
weight right now

476
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:19,360
so our first scenario were heifers from

477
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,120
450 to 750 pounds at a 1.8 pounds per

478
00:18:19,360 --> 00:18:23,679
day

479
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:27,280
uh 28 pounds of feed comes out to about

480
00:18:23,679 --> 00:18:31,280
83 cents per head per day in feed cost

481
00:18:27,280 --> 00:18:34,880
so putting on 300 pounds 1.8 pound per

482
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:37,360
day at about 83 cents in feed costs

483
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:38,160
and so here's that heifer scenario

484
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:40,160
and

485
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:42,640
what we wind up with we're beginning

486
00:18:40,160 --> 00:18:44,400
value at 126. i'm using the same shrink

487
00:18:42,640 --> 00:18:47,360
and the same death loss

488
00:18:44,400 --> 00:18:50,080
finished out at 750 and then headed down

489
00:18:47,360 --> 00:18:51,440
the road sale price at 113 dollars per

490
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,679
hundredweight

491
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:57,120
and we wind up with a profit of about 28

492
00:18:53,679 --> 00:19:00,320
bucks per head in this case so

493
00:18:57,120 --> 00:19:01,919
profitable definitely uh always always

494
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:04,240
better when this is above zero than

495
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,960
below it but not terribly lucrative in

496
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:09,039
this case where you're talking about

497
00:19:06,960 --> 00:19:10,640
barely thirty dollars per head

498
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:12,480
but again it's kind of a theme that

499
00:19:10,640 --> 00:19:14,960
we're that that i'm showing in this in

500
00:19:12,480 --> 00:19:16,240
this scenario that uh it

501
00:19:14,960 --> 00:19:18,320
it's lower but it's similar to the

502
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,960
steers this these lower

503
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:22,880
average daily gain rates tend not to be

504
00:19:20,960 --> 00:19:23,840
as profitable as the higher ones as

505
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:25,679
you'll see

506
00:19:23,840 --> 00:19:27,760
moving forward

507
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:30,480
but they're putting on and then you know

508
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:32,960
this animal's on feed for 165 days and

509
00:19:30,480 --> 00:19:33,840
again that's where that yardage of 35

510
00:19:32,960 --> 00:19:38,160
cents

511
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:40,960
really starts to add up um

512
00:19:38,160 --> 00:19:42,960
so then our next scenario is 525 pounds

513
00:19:40,960 --> 00:19:46,720
to 800 pounds so in this case we're

514
00:19:42,960 --> 00:19:48,880
putting on 275 pounds at that same 1.8

515
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:51,039
pounds average daily gain animals a

516
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:52,880
little bigger when we get it so our our

517
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:53,919
cost per day are higher right out of the

518
00:19:52,880 --> 00:19:56,480
gate

519
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:58,720
at 90 cents per day and then the ration

520
00:19:56,480 --> 00:20:02,080
of 32 and a half pounds of feed today

521
00:19:58,720 --> 00:20:02,080
with uh with this breakout

522
00:20:03,520 --> 00:20:08,559
so here it is with the the the the

523
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:11,760
numbers that were plugged in there and

524
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:13,280
this is actually showing a loss

525
00:20:11,760 --> 00:20:15,600
and the

526
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:17,840
big reason for that is that

527
00:20:15,600 --> 00:20:21,120
we're only we're making money putting on

528
00:20:17,840 --> 00:20:23,600
the weight and putting on 275 pounds for

529
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:25,440
this long just isn't enough to pay out

530
00:20:23,600 --> 00:20:27,919
and that's what this is showing here and

531
00:20:25,440 --> 00:20:29,280
i i think i have this scenario uh toward

532
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:31,520
the end of the presentation that i'm

533
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:34,080
going to show uh where we where we make

534
00:20:31,520 --> 00:20:35,760
some adjustments real quick to it but

535
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:37,280
beginning value is about the same

536
00:20:35,760 --> 00:20:39,039
similar

537
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:42,080
projected sale price is about the same

538
00:20:39,039 --> 00:20:46,400
feed cost a little bit higher a lot cost

539
00:20:42,080 --> 00:20:48,480
the same and 155 days on feed that gets

540
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:50,559
us a loss of two bucks so

541
00:20:48,480 --> 00:20:52,799
we we really aren't putting on enough

542
00:20:50,559 --> 00:20:54,799
weight in this scenario fast enough to

543
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:56,720
actually pay off is is what this is

544
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:58,799
showing

545
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:03,360
and then our final heifer scenario is

546
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,760
550 to 850 pounds back to uh 300 pounds

547
00:21:03,360 --> 00:21:08,960
that we're putting on the animal at a

548
00:21:05,760 --> 00:21:10,960
2.8 pounds uh per day so quite uh higher

549
00:21:08,960 --> 00:21:13,039
than the 1.8 before

550
00:21:10,960 --> 00:21:14,960
this is more expensive again per day at

551
00:21:13,039 --> 00:21:16,240
a dollar eight which which should be

552
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:18,240
obvious because we're putting on more

553
00:21:16,240 --> 00:21:20,480
weight and here's the pounds of feed per

554
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:22,880
day and the breakout there a lot of

555
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:25,120
silage uh for this in this particular

556
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:28,480
scenario again put together by uh carl

557
00:21:25,120 --> 00:21:30,960
hoppy for for this uh for this talk

558
00:21:28,480 --> 00:21:32,559
but this is our uh final heifer scenario

559
00:21:30,960 --> 00:21:34,400
there

560
00:21:32,559 --> 00:21:36,240
and then here is the breakout of the

561
00:21:34,400 --> 00:21:37,520
heifer scenario here

562
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:40,320
and

563
00:21:37,520 --> 00:21:42,320
what we got 550 pounds to 850 this

564
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:45,120
animal's only in the in the yard there

565
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:46,880
for 107 days a lot a lot shorter period

566
00:21:45,120 --> 00:21:48,640
of time than the other two

567
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:50,720
uh projected selling price roughly the

568
00:21:48,640 --> 00:21:53,200
same beginning value they didn't change

569
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:55,360
much between 450 weights and 550 weights

570
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:57,120
really and 126

571
00:21:55,360 --> 00:21:59,520
feed costs at a hundred a dollar eight

572
00:21:57,120 --> 00:22:01,600
per day and we get down here and the

573
00:21:59,520 --> 00:22:04,720
profit is about sixty two dollars per

574
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:05,520
head okay so quite a bit higher profit

575
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:07,520
and

576
00:22:05,520 --> 00:22:10,640
getting to that 850 pounds and the

577
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:12,880
explanation is again this yardage fee

578
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:15,360
total cost on yardage is much lower

579
00:22:12,880 --> 00:22:19,120
because we're only at 107 days instead

580
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:21,039
of 150 or 160 and and that's achieved by

581
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:24,400
this higher average daily rate of gain

582
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:27,440
so if you're seeing a theme here

583
00:22:24,400 --> 00:22:29,200
feed costs relative to the value of the

584
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,440
pounds that are being put on is still

585
00:22:29,200 --> 00:22:34,080
relatively low and

586
00:22:31,440 --> 00:22:37,200
enabling us to to make a profit

587
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:40,080
i'm not even messing with

588
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:42,159
prices of fed cattle or anything like

589
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,400
that this is just straight up showing

590
00:22:42,159 --> 00:22:46,480
that that putting on the weight uh that

591
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:48,480
right now despite higher corn prices

592
00:22:46,480 --> 00:22:50,880
it's it pays to put weight on these

593
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:50,880
animals

594
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:56,000
so as i said there's a i was going to

595
00:22:52,880 --> 00:22:57,760
put together a profit loss breakdown

596
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,919
that kind of compared them all side by

597
00:22:57,760 --> 00:23:04,480
side and so here's our

598
00:22:59,919 --> 00:23:05,919
three steer examples 1.8 2.8 3.6 average

599
00:23:04,480 --> 00:23:09,360
daily gains

600
00:23:05,919 --> 00:23:10,720
the the varying days on feed

601
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:13,280
and then you kind of look here to this

602
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:15,520
column the profit and loss and

603
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:18,480
uh the more weight we put on or the

604
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:20,559
faster we put it on the more valuable uh

605
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:23,200
and the more profit we make so you see

606
00:23:20,559 --> 00:23:26,480
like this this uh fed out steer here

607
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:30,400
from 575 to 1270 you we're profiting a

608
00:23:26,480 --> 00:23:33,120
dollar 29 per day per head uh doing that

609
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:36,320
on the 500 to 800 weight at 2.8 pounds

610
00:23:33,120 --> 00:23:38,240
per day we're making 67 cents uh per

611
00:23:36,320 --> 00:23:40,320
head per day profit uh putting the

612
00:23:38,240 --> 00:23:42,880
weight on so that that's pretty solid

613
00:23:40,320 --> 00:23:46,000
and then this 1.8 pounds is is likely

614
00:23:42,880 --> 00:23:47,840
that's almost a break-even proposition

615
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:50,080
it's just they're the the animals in the

616
00:23:47,840 --> 00:23:52,640
yard too long the yardage fees are

617
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:54,640
starting to add up too fast and we're

618
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:56,080
just not putting on enough weight

619
00:23:54,640 --> 00:23:58,000
um so then we come down here to the

620
00:23:56,080 --> 00:24:00,159
heifer scenarios

621
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:01,840
and you see a similar theme with the

622
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:04,000
exception of

623
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:05,600
you know the the first scenarios is

624
00:24:04,000 --> 00:24:06,799
barely a kind of a break even

625
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,799
proposition

626
00:24:06,799 --> 00:24:10,480
the second scenario for all intents and

627
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:11,679
purposes i know it shows a negative two

628
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:13,120
bucks but that's

629
00:24:11,679 --> 00:24:15,679
when you're doing estimates it's pretty

630
00:24:13,120 --> 00:24:17,039
close to zero so these two scenarios

631
00:24:15,679 --> 00:24:18,880
really don't

632
00:24:17,039 --> 00:24:20,320
help us out a lot it's not until we

633
00:24:18,880 --> 00:24:22,960
start putting on

634
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:25,279
two three pounds a day or more that we

635
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:28,400
start really seeing a profit

636
00:24:25,279 --> 00:24:30,480
and that's this 550 to 850 weight

637
00:24:28,400 --> 00:24:33,919
example putting on almost three pounds

638
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:37,440
per day we're netting 58 cents to go up

639
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:39,120
to 850 pounds okay so

640
00:24:37,440 --> 00:24:41,360
i think you guys are probably by now

641
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:43,520
getting the theme of all of this which

642
00:24:41,360 --> 00:24:44,840
is that putting on weight as fast as you

643
00:24:43,520 --> 00:24:47,520
can

644
00:24:44,840 --> 00:24:49,440
pays now obviously you do you can't you

645
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:51,360
there's only so much you can do but

646
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:53,200
right now that that's that's the theme

647
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:55,440
through all of the scenarios that i ran

648
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:57,679
whether it's steers or heifers there it

649
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:59,919
that it pays to put on weight

650
00:24:57,679 --> 00:25:01,760
not not go cheap or anything like that

651
00:24:59,919 --> 00:25:03,600
you know put the weight on pack on the

652
00:25:01,760 --> 00:25:05,360
pounds and get them out the door as

653
00:25:03,600 --> 00:25:07,200
quickly as possible that's what this is

654
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:09,200
showing here so that we keep those

655
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:10,880
yardage and overhead costs that you got

656
00:25:09,200 --> 00:25:13,200
to deal with labor and whatever else

657
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,200
lower

658
00:25:13,440 --> 00:25:19,279
and as i said i had some scenarios so uh

659
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:21,679
to kind of re emphasize that point and

660
00:25:19,279 --> 00:25:24,720
if we say all else equal what happens if

661
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:27,600
i keep the 500 weight steer with 2.8

662
00:25:24,720 --> 00:25:29,520
average daily gain to 850 pounds uh

663
00:25:27,600 --> 00:25:31,200
before that we we we had them down to

664
00:25:29,520 --> 00:25:34,000
eight hundred and

665
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:36,400
look what it does it actually increases

666
00:25:34,000 --> 00:25:38,480
our profit pretty considerably to a

667
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:40,080
hundred and eight dollars and uh and

668
00:25:38,480 --> 00:25:42,240
instead of what we showed before which i

669
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:45,600
think was what 67 or something like that

670
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:47,279
70. so putting adding adding another 50

671
00:25:45,600 --> 00:25:49,760
pounds onto the animal

672
00:25:47,279 --> 00:25:52,159
uh makes sense and the reason is because

673
00:25:49,760 --> 00:25:54,480
this 2.8 pounds average daily gain we're

674
00:25:52,159 --> 00:25:56,159
making money every quite a bit of money

675
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:57,679
every day that that animal is in the

676
00:25:56,159 --> 00:26:00,400
yard

677
00:25:57,679 --> 00:26:02,000
at 2.8 pound average daily gain

678
00:26:00,400 --> 00:26:04,159
it's sort of a balancing act you're

679
00:26:02,000 --> 00:26:06,960
trying to figure out okay how much is it

680
00:26:04,159 --> 00:26:09,279
costing me to have this critter here in

681
00:26:06,960 --> 00:26:11,840
veterinary and labor and

682
00:26:09,279 --> 00:26:12,720
my own time and everything else

683
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,760
and

684
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:15,200
versus

685
00:26:13,760 --> 00:26:17,279
what about uh

686
00:26:15,200 --> 00:26:19,919
putting in the feed and

687
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,760
feed costs and being able to to achieve

688
00:26:19,919 --> 00:26:23,679
these higher average daily gains and

689
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:25,440
what this shows is that 2.8 pounds

690
00:26:23,679 --> 00:26:27,440
you're making money keeping them in the

691
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:29,600
lot and putting weight on and and the

692
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:32,240
other example that made quite a bit more

693
00:26:29,600 --> 00:26:33,840
with putting on 3.6 really pays because

694
00:26:32,240 --> 00:26:35,600
you're more than covering overhead and

695
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:36,720
variable costs and every day that

696
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:40,400
they're sitting there in the yard

697
00:26:36,720 --> 00:26:40,400
getting bigger you're making money

698
00:26:41,440 --> 00:26:45,919
alright so let's do the same thing with

699
00:26:43,279 --> 00:26:48,799
the heifer uh if we have all else equal

700
00:26:45,919 --> 00:26:51,360
what happens if i keep the 512 25 weight

701
00:26:48,799 --> 00:26:54,159
heifer with a 1.8 pound average daily

702
00:26:51,360 --> 00:26:57,919
gain to 850 and i i believe it went from

703
00:26:54,159 --> 00:27:00,960
a negative two dollars to 15.82 so what

704
00:26:57,919 --> 00:27:03,039
this kind of shows is 1.8 pounds is

705
00:27:00,960 --> 00:27:05,120
uh fairly close to a break even

706
00:27:03,039 --> 00:27:06,720
proposition on heifers we need to get a

707
00:27:05,120 --> 00:27:08,000
we need to have a higher average daily

708
00:27:06,720 --> 00:27:10,960
gain than that

709
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:14,320
in order to really make a profit yes 1.8

710
00:27:10,960 --> 00:27:17,200
pounds adg is is is above break even

711
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:19,760
but just barely i mean and we're not

712
00:27:17,200 --> 00:27:21,120
we're that's the margin is too slim in

713
00:27:19,760 --> 00:27:23,120
my opinion

714
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:25,120
to go with that so i would definitely be

715
00:27:23,120 --> 00:27:27,840
looking at trying to get to that

716
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,840
three pounds per day or better

717
00:27:27,840 --> 00:27:32,080
on all my steers and heifers if i'm

718
00:27:29,840 --> 00:27:34,399
looking to background them and put some

719
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:35,919
weight on and right now all the all the

720
00:27:34,399 --> 00:27:39,039
cost data and everything else and the

721
00:27:35,919 --> 00:27:41,679
market data is showing that that uh uh

722
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:43,200
buyers uh are willing to to pay for

723
00:27:41,679 --> 00:27:44,720
weight that that's that's what they're

724
00:27:43,200 --> 00:27:47,440
willing to do and feed costs are low

725
00:27:44,720 --> 00:27:51,120
enough that we can put it on and make a

726
00:27:47,440 --> 00:27:51,120
profit as things stand right now

727
00:27:52,080 --> 00:27:55,679
so some key points to this presentation

728
00:27:54,640 --> 00:27:57,679
uh

729
00:27:55,679 --> 00:28:00,320
i'll reiterate it again it pays to put

730
00:27:57,679 --> 00:28:03,200
on weight so the purchase costs for 500

731
00:28:00,320 --> 00:28:05,840
to 575 way steers are high

732
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:08,159
but feed costs remain lower or low

733
00:28:05,840 --> 00:28:11,360
relatively low compared to what our

734
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:14,000
market prices are for eight 800 uh

735
00:28:11,360 --> 00:28:15,360
weight animals all the way up to 12 1200

736
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:16,880
so

737
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:18,880
what that says is

738
00:28:16,880 --> 00:28:21,679
you know it that there's money to be

739
00:28:18,880 --> 00:28:23,840
made doing this and then as i as i said

740
00:28:21,679 --> 00:28:25,760
it in the last few slides putting on

741
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:27,760
weight faster is better because it

742
00:28:25,760 --> 00:28:29,279
reduces your yardage costs as well as

743
00:28:27,760 --> 00:28:32,159
the number of days the animal has to be

744
00:28:29,279 --> 00:28:34,640
managed for every pound gained okay

745
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:35,360
so that's that's kind of the theme here

746
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:37,440
is

747
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,399
put on as much weight as reasonably

748
00:28:37,440 --> 00:28:42,320
possible as fast as possible uh and and

749
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:44,320
you stand to make

750
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:48,480
as much uh the most amount of money from

751
00:28:44,320 --> 00:28:48,480
from any kind of uh feeding enterprise

752
00:28:50,320 --> 00:28:54,559
so the other key points is you need to

753
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:56,720
put on at least 300 pounds on heifers

754
00:28:54,559 --> 00:28:58,880
otherwise there just isn't

755
00:28:56,720 --> 00:29:00,880
enough enough there to really make it

756
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:02,799
worth it so you're gonna want to

757
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:04,320
if they're 500 pounds feed them up to

758
00:29:02,799 --> 00:29:05,760
eight eight fifty

759
00:29:04,320 --> 00:29:07,279
four hundred fifty pounds up to seven

760
00:29:05,760 --> 00:29:09,120
fifty eight hundred and again you're

761
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,000
gonna wanna do it as fast as possible at

762
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:14,080
least that 2.8 pound let's call it three

763
00:29:12,000 --> 00:29:16,000
pounds average daily gain i should

764
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:18,000
definitely be your target so we're

765
00:29:16,000 --> 00:29:20,320
talking about 300 pounds per animal on

766
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,919
the heifer side at three pounds per day

767
00:29:20,320 --> 00:29:23,600
that's that that should be our target

768
00:29:21,919 --> 00:29:25,679
and if we can achieve that

769
00:29:23,600 --> 00:29:27,600
all else holds equal

770
00:29:25,679 --> 00:29:29,679
where we stand to make a decent profit

771
00:29:27,600 --> 00:29:31,440
on on everything we retain and put

772
00:29:29,679 --> 00:29:33,279
weight on so

773
00:29:31,440 --> 00:29:34,880
that's kind of that's good news and and

774
00:29:33,279 --> 00:29:36,799
it's a similar story to what we were

775
00:29:34,880 --> 00:29:38,640
seeing last year that the last couple of

776
00:29:36,799 --> 00:29:41,360
years had they have paid

777
00:29:38,640 --> 00:29:43,760
for for producers to to put weight on

778
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:46,399
these animals and and we're seeing that

779
00:29:43,760 --> 00:29:46,399
now as well

780
00:29:47,679 --> 00:29:54,399
so with that i'd like to thank everyone

781
00:29:50,320 --> 00:29:55,679
who watched i have my email address here

782
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:57,360

788
00:30:04,799 --> 00:30:08,480

789
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:10,320
person but thanks to everyone who
