1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:04,920
all right well we took a break after the

2
00:00:02,280 --> 00:00:08,000
bridge now we're going to go do uh fence

3
00:00:04,920 --> 00:00:09,519
we're going to repair fence so I like to

4
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:11,719
get the fences done every now and then

5
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:14,240
so the animals don't uh scratch their

6
00:00:11,719 --> 00:00:17,640
eyes so gatlin's getting his driver's

7
00:00:14,240 --> 00:00:19,640
license right now hey hello so same

8
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:21,600
Principle as a big vehicle but slightly

9
00:00:19,640 --> 00:00:25,279
different uh you got to hold in the

10
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,080
brake when you turn the key all

11
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:30,279
right all

12
00:00:27,080 --> 00:00:32,960
right there you go you can let off now

13
00:00:30,279 --> 00:00:35,360
so it's got a clutch that's on a belt so

14
00:00:32,960 --> 00:00:39,120
it doesn't roll like a car wheel but you

15
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:40,680
notice it's in gear right now so uh just

16
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:43,680
drive out underneath this tree there's

17
00:00:40,680 --> 00:00:46,399
no seat belts okay there no seat belts

18
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:49,160
for said there's a clutch or no clutch

19
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:51,520
no nothing you just as you press the gas

20
00:00:49,160 --> 00:00:54,039
the uh belt will will compress the

21
00:00:51,520 --> 00:00:56,800
clutch is automatic and it'll Lurch

22
00:00:54,039 --> 00:00:56,800
forward but then

23
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,879
dry you got it

24
00:01:02,719 --> 00:01:07,239
yep keep going you'll want to go right

25
00:01:04,280 --> 00:01:07,239
in between the tree and the

26
00:01:09,880 --> 00:01:14,000
trailer and what you'll do is uh as soon

27
00:01:12,439 --> 00:01:17,000
as you get the driveway you'll turn and

28
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:19,240
go up that way right yeah and we'll go

29
00:01:17,000 --> 00:01:21,680
we start following the fence we're going

30
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:23,360
to pull down all that electric old

31
00:01:21,680 --> 00:01:25,400
electric wire we're going to get rid of

32
00:01:23,360 --> 00:01:28,119
those yellow insulators and then

33
00:01:25,400 --> 00:01:30,759
anything that's broken we go ahead and

34
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:32,399
take care of as well there things like

35
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,520
that you can just drive right through it

36
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:38,200
it won't

37
00:01:34,520 --> 00:01:41,119
matter this as fast as it goes no it

38
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:44,119
it'll do 70 but I put a regulator on it

39
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:45,560
so to keep it under 20 but once you get

40
00:01:44,119 --> 00:01:47,159
out there you could go you know once you

41
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:51,320
get straight and through the gate just

42
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,320
floor it and you'll see

43
00:01:51,430 --> 00:01:54,599
[Music]

44
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:13,039
W yeah it's got a little pick them up

45
00:02:25,640 --> 00:02:30,920
juice then we'll just go down to the

46
00:02:27,959 --> 00:02:33,519
gate and we'll start there what you're

47
00:02:30,920 --> 00:02:35,360
looking for is the broken wires so when

48
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:37,480
you see a broken wire you can just take

49
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:39,640
your foot off the gas it's got a brake

50
00:02:37,480 --> 00:02:41,280
clutch all right uh but if you need a

51
00:02:39,640 --> 00:02:44,599
hard stop you can use the brake but

52
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:46,159
usually it'll Coast Coast to a stop and

53
00:02:44,599 --> 00:02:48,360
then any of those yellow things we're

54
00:02:46,159 --> 00:02:51,000
going to pull those off the p uh off the

55
00:02:48,360 --> 00:02:53,879
pipes too right those used to be an old

56
00:02:51,000 --> 00:02:55,280
insulator all this old scraps of wire

57
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:57,239
that I've been pulling out of the ground

58
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:58,840
we're going to throw in the bed at back

59
00:02:57,239 --> 00:03:02,159
of this thing and just clean it up so

60
00:02:58,840 --> 00:03:05,200
the animals don't get hurt and fix the

61
00:03:02,159 --> 00:03:06,640
brakes there's yeah there's a brake all

62
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:10,280
right

63
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:12,959
perfect turn the key you can turn it

64
00:03:10,280 --> 00:03:16,000
off and those yellow things are super

65
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:18,720
hard to get off the uh pipes I mean I

66
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:20,640
just all I do is just torque at them and

67
00:03:18,720 --> 00:03:21,959
see I like that one I I don't know if I

68
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,799
left it or

69
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,319
not but I'm trying to clean up you know

70
00:03:24,799 --> 00:03:27,159
what I mean like I don't want to leave a

71
00:03:26,319 --> 00:03:30,159
bunch

72
00:03:27,159 --> 00:03:32,519
of you know that I hit play yeah I did

73
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:36,040
um

74
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:38,680
record just walk down and Gatlin and

75
00:03:36,040 --> 00:03:41,680
just you know anywhere we see these but

76
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:44,720
I'll teach you to do this right now

77
00:03:41,680 --> 00:03:46,640
there's a lot of ways of doing wire this

78
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:49,519
is the way I don't like to do it whoever

79
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:49,519
fixed it last

80
00:03:50,360 --> 00:03:55,760
time but it's the way most ranchers tell

81
00:03:53,239 --> 00:03:57,680
you is right but I don't like to do that

82
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:59,840
so see what happened is the Bulls came

83
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:01,599
through here fighting yeah and they

84
00:03:59,840 --> 00:04:05,079
broke it and so a lot of people will

85
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:07,480
crimp a crimp repair in here I don't

86
00:04:05,079 --> 00:04:11,560
think that lasts so um I'll get my

87
00:04:07,480 --> 00:04:11,560
gloves and show you how I do it all

88
00:04:12,280 --> 00:04:18,759
right so what I do you know obviously

89
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:18,759
the crimp I'll cut that

90
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:30,680
off so what I do is I unravel the um The

91
00:04:26,400 --> 00:04:34,360
Wire yeah back about 6 in 8 in

92
00:04:30,680 --> 00:04:36,080
in and then I braid in the uh the

93
00:04:34,360 --> 00:04:38,759
solution that way I'm not buying

94
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,360
anything I'm just using what wire is

95
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:45,680
there so you know I just unravel

96
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:48,160
it and then if I can grab the other side

97
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,160
I'll just wave it in but sometimes I can

98
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:54,520
right so see how this is all broken so

99
00:04:51,160 --> 00:04:54,520
I'll have to pull this staple

100
00:04:56,639 --> 00:05:01,880
out first time well I have a better

101
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:03,800
video on this uh this without me

102
00:05:01,880 --> 00:05:06,479
blocking it right here I'm just teaching

103
00:05:03,800 --> 00:05:08,600
Gatlin how to do this so uh you know his

104
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:11,479
presentation's for him but basically I

105
00:05:08,600 --> 00:05:14,479
spay those two pieces of wire apart then

106
00:05:11,479 --> 00:05:17,160
I braid one strand over it and the other

107
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:19,039
strand over that in opposite directions

108
00:05:17,160 --> 00:05:21,160
one clockwise one

109
00:05:19,039 --> 00:05:23,160
counterclockwise I do that on both ends

110
00:05:21,160 --> 00:05:25,919
then I don't need any extra grommets I

111
00:05:23,160 --> 00:05:28,720
don't need ferals I don't need special

112
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:32,280
expensive CRI crimping devices and I

113
00:05:28,720 --> 00:05:35,039
find if I pull this tight uh it spreads

114
00:05:32,280 --> 00:05:36,880
the load out over a longer surface area

115
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:38,960
so you can pull them a little bit tight

116
00:05:36,880 --> 00:05:40,639
now I'm careful not to tighten these too

117
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:42,600
much these old strands cuz you break

118
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:46,600
them but that's what I'm doing I'm just

119
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,600
weaving two kinds of Bob wire

120
00:05:50,479 --> 00:05:57,160
together it's already got you whoopsie

121
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:09,639
did not see that I was too focused on

122
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:13,000
here bar wire it really does have a mind

123
00:06:09,639 --> 00:06:13,000
of its own

124
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:36,479
[Music]

125
00:06:34,599 --> 00:06:38,360
all right you want to grab it like right

126
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:40,800
there and just put a little tension look

127
00:06:38,360 --> 00:06:43,120
down the line make sure I you know that

128
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:45,759
it's not real

129
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:47,880
floppy I'll do the same over here a help

130
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:50,280
here he's pulling the tension in the

131
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:52,080
line so that it's a a little tighter now

132
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:54,800
I could have a fence stretcher do this

133
00:06:52,080 --> 00:06:56,720
with a fence stretcher I've got one but

134
00:06:54,800 --> 00:06:59,879
I find setting it up and getting it to

135
00:06:56,720 --> 00:07:02,800
hold on with these old strands and not

136
00:06:59,879 --> 00:07:05,280
going too tight breaking them uh just a

137
00:07:02,800 --> 00:07:06,800
human touch seems to make do and later

138
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,720
on I'll show you how I tighten them

139
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:12,120
anyway but uh so he's he's holding on to

140
00:07:09,720 --> 00:07:14,599
it with the pliers and giving me a

141
00:07:12,120 --> 00:07:17,560
little tension there so the line doesn't

142
00:07:14,599 --> 00:07:19,360
just flop down but I just twist these by

143
00:07:17,560 --> 00:07:21,960
hand all together I leave the little end

144
00:07:19,360 --> 00:07:25,560
up like a barb wire that's all I do on

145
00:07:21,960 --> 00:07:27,560
it so nothing fancy uh but I am teaching

146
00:07:25,560 --> 00:07:30,160
Gatlin here he's picking up pretty fast

147
00:07:27,560 --> 00:07:33,039
he's a a quick learner he's a young man

148
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:34,639
he's not a late teen he's an early teen

149
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:36,919
kid just heading into getting his

150
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:38,720
driver's permit so uh there'll be

151
00:07:36,919 --> 00:07:40,440
opportunity I'm going to let them drive

152
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,479
a little bit more the more you let kids

153
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:45,280
drive the safer the world is for them

154
00:07:42,479 --> 00:07:47,440
and the happier we all are so I'm happy

155
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:49,479
to have him here he's he's driving

156
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:51,159
around today I'm not driving nothing but

157
00:07:49,479 --> 00:07:55,080
there's that strand all mended up you

158
00:07:51,159 --> 00:07:57,319
hardly even notice all right now this is

159
00:07:55,080 --> 00:07:59,919
uh this is how I pull it tight if I need

160
00:07:57,319 --> 00:08:01,919
to

161
00:07:59,919 --> 00:08:04,599
so once you you find the post is where

162
00:08:01,919 --> 00:08:06,919
you do it well after you do the post if

163
00:08:04,599 --> 00:08:09,520
you give them a little crimp like that

164
00:08:06,919 --> 00:08:12,039
Ben they'll do that so uh let me get the

165
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:14,759
hammer and a

166
00:08:12,039 --> 00:08:17,400
staple would you grab the and uh the

167
00:08:14,759 --> 00:08:21,039
split in there and just pull it uh tight

168
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:25,000
for me SPL yeah just grab it here and

169
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:25,000
just lean against it

170
00:08:36,479 --> 00:08:42,519
all right and let's do it the opposite

171
00:08:39,880 --> 00:08:45,880
direction we grab it this way and pull

172
00:08:42,519 --> 00:08:45,880
the fence that way

173
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:53,800
okay oh over here on this side got

174
00:08:51,480 --> 00:08:58,519
one and then when I want to make them

175
00:08:53,800 --> 00:09:01,240
tight what I do uh from this point on is

176
00:08:58,519 --> 00:09:04,240
uh I told all the slack into this spot I

177
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:08,480
physically just kind

178
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:12,240
of you know drive a nail into it against

179
00:09:08,480 --> 00:09:14,480
the post right so um in fact you could

180
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:16,880
do that that one that's good I dropped

181
00:09:14,480 --> 00:09:17,839
the staple somewhere in here hope I lost

182
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:20,800
it

183
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:23,120
huh well Gone

184
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:26,440
Forever it's really hard to drive those

185
00:09:23,120 --> 00:09:29,399
Staples so it's good practice for you uh

186
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:32,120
go uh running and it ran into a piece of

187
00:09:29,399 --> 00:09:33,839
the barb wire dangling like this and the

188
00:09:32,120 --> 00:09:36,320
barb wire went right through its eye

189
00:09:33,839 --> 00:09:37,360
into its brain killed it instantly Oh e

190
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:39,839
yeah it was

191
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:43,200
terrible you see that once it sticks

192
00:09:39,839 --> 00:09:46,000
with you how dangerous bad fence is you

193
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,000
know

194
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:51,959
yeah and uh for me it was in Michigan

195
00:09:50,120 --> 00:09:54,760
middle of winter so I couldn't even bury

196
00:09:51,959 --> 00:09:57,279
the thing I had this Dead Goat that I

197
00:09:54,760 --> 00:10:00,800
had figure out what to do well I've got

198
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,440
a playful nature so I gave uh Gatlin

199
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,920
here the hardest of uh of jobs to do

200
00:10:03,440 --> 00:10:08,920
keep tension on a wire driving a staple

201
00:10:06,920 --> 00:10:11,959
listen I don't even know if he's ever

202
00:10:08,920 --> 00:10:14,680
picked up a hammer before he showed up

203
00:10:11,959 --> 00:10:16,839
out to the farm I did not ask him for

204
00:10:14,680 --> 00:10:20,600
his extensive resume this is a boy's

205
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:24,120
first job and when you hire a young man

206
00:10:20,600 --> 00:10:26,519
your job is to help him and they're not

207
00:10:24,120 --> 00:10:28,839
ready for a eight hour day they're not

208
00:10:26,519 --> 00:10:32,040
ready to be yelled at they're not ready

209
00:10:28,839 --> 00:10:34,320
to do a lot of things and we forget as

210
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:37,279
we get older what it was like for us

211
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:40,079
when we had our first job and hopefully

212
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:42,360
we had a good good boss a good teacher I

213
00:10:40,079 --> 00:10:44,839
had good ranchers they're all kindly a

214
00:10:42,360 --> 00:10:47,959
little ory and so I'm a little ory to

215
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:50,160
this young man I tease him a smidgen and

216
00:10:47,959 --> 00:10:52,279
all in good fun letting them know but

217
00:10:50,160 --> 00:10:55,399
this is the hard job and if you'll

218
00:10:52,279 --> 00:10:57,959
notice there I'm using a hatchet Hammer

219
00:10:55,399 --> 00:11:00,639
uh so you got that sharp edge to

220
00:10:57,959 --> 00:11:02,600
intimidate you uh on top of it but

221
00:11:00,639 --> 00:11:05,320
driving these staples in if you've never

222
00:11:02,600 --> 00:11:08,680
driven a staple into a fence you have no

223
00:11:05,320 --> 00:11:12,600
idea how how hard this is so I let this

224
00:11:08,680 --> 00:11:14,040
run with uh with Gatlin uh regular speed

225
00:11:12,600 --> 00:11:16,600
so you can

226
00:11:14,040 --> 00:11:18,240
appreciate his struggle now I'm watching

227
00:11:16,600 --> 00:11:20,680
them out of the corner of the eye while

228
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:23,279
I'm uh fixing fence down down the way

229
00:11:20,680 --> 00:11:25,920
I'm I'm wiring all the fence there is

230
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:28,320
dozens and dozens and dozens of the wire

231
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:32,440
straps out so I'm I'm fixing all them as

232
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:34,760
I'm going L do this every spring not hes

233
00:11:32,440 --> 00:11:34,760
in the

234
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:45,720
fence I told you it's hard isn't it it's

235
00:11:43,560 --> 00:11:48,839
hard to get the right the right angle

236
00:11:45,720 --> 00:11:50,680
it's really hard he's still he's still

237
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:53,320
working on that staple I'm trying to get

238
00:11:50,680 --> 00:11:55,720
it in there without one hurting

239
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:59,639
myself

240
00:11:55,720 --> 00:12:02,240
to No it's it's hard get in there it's

241
00:11:59,639 --> 00:12:05,480
surprisingly

242
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:08,480
hard well can you uh hold this area over

243
00:12:05,480 --> 00:12:13,600
here like pull on it a little

244
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:17,440
bit so I can get more room to come on

245
00:12:13,600 --> 00:12:17,440
right there I need

246
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:25,959
more you want me to do this one yeah my

247
00:12:23,720 --> 00:12:28,800
friend I can't I can't get the right

248
00:12:25,959 --> 00:12:31,880
angle no I I set you up on that one it

249
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,959
really is hard to

250
00:12:31,880 --> 00:12:36,000
do you're going to do it in half the

251
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:38,800
time no I will well I'll do it but I

252
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:42,480
won't do it in half the

253
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,480
time yeah there you

254
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:52,279
go anyway that's how I pull them tight

255
00:12:49,240 --> 00:12:54,800
all right after the fact as I physically

256
00:12:52,279 --> 00:12:59,880
do that I'll get it next time yeah what

257
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:59,880
next time yeah yeah I set you

258
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:09,160
woo but uh and then as far as uh see

259
00:13:06,120 --> 00:13:11,399
where it's kind of floppy yeah so what I

260
00:13:09,160 --> 00:13:13,480
do is I go down see how and I give them

261
00:13:11,399 --> 00:13:16,279
all a little

262
00:13:13,480 --> 00:13:20,880
crmp and you don't even notice

263
00:13:16,279 --> 00:13:24,320
it but's see how it draws that right

264
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:27,079
up so that's all you do is just give

265
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:29,160
them a little crimp as you walk down oh

266
00:13:27,079 --> 00:13:31,760
hey this one's just straight on grab a

267
00:13:29,160 --> 00:13:35,320
stretch staple to do this one all right

268
00:13:31,760 --> 00:13:35,320
and that one won't be as hard for

269
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:41,639
you all right so what happens the fences

270
00:13:39,240 --> 00:13:43,440
that messes it up well the Bulls come

271
00:13:41,639 --> 00:13:45,160
through on each side and when they're

272
00:13:43,440 --> 00:13:48,040
after each they just walk right through

273
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:49,720
like a spaghetti and then it breaks the

274
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:51,800
fence and then you have to put it back

275
00:13:49,720 --> 00:13:54,160
together so that's what we're working on

276
00:13:51,800 --> 00:13:55,880
right now plus you know the post can let

277
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:59,120
go of you know a little wear and tear as

278
00:13:55,880 --> 00:14:01,040
normal but this is all bold damage

279
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:03,560
that's bull crap man while he learns to

280
00:14:01,040 --> 00:14:06,320
do this and just know uh I know that he

281
00:14:03,560 --> 00:14:08,199
is struggling and uh but I let him

282
00:14:06,320 --> 00:14:10,240
struggle and that's all part two of of

283
00:14:08,199 --> 00:14:12,240
the training listen I didn't hire a

284
00:14:10,240 --> 00:14:15,360

00:16:36,199 --> 00:16:40,160
looking for the next broken strand so

341
00:16:38,279 --> 00:16:44,600
many of these were missing their ties

342
00:16:40,160 --> 00:16:47,720
that I decided to walk down let's

343
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:51,279
see already you found a broken strand

344
00:16:47,720 --> 00:16:53,639
one right there on the bottom oh I see

345
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:53,639
it

346
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:01,199
yeah left over here on top on top these

347
00:16:58,920 --> 00:17:03,880
bottom ones I'm just going to wrap

348
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:06,079
around try to make tight and wrap around

349
00:17:03,880 --> 00:17:06,079
all

350
00:17:07,600 --> 00:17:12,120
right this one's actually broken

351
00:17:14,319 --> 00:17:18,839
twice what happens to these besides

352
00:17:17,160 --> 00:17:21,600
being close to the ground is they get

353
00:17:18,839 --> 00:17:23,480
caught by the mower decks you know and

354
00:17:21,600 --> 00:17:26,919
then they get snapped

355
00:17:23,480 --> 00:17:26,919
off yep good

356
00:17:27,160 --> 00:17:33,200
eye once I can I'll try to fix ones like

357
00:17:31,520 --> 00:17:36,240
this that are just all rusted away I

358
00:17:33,200 --> 00:17:36,240
don't see any point in

359
00:17:36,720 --> 00:17:42,520
it well not only were you responsible

360
00:17:39,919 --> 00:17:45,559
for hiring them at first but they are

361
00:17:42,520 --> 00:17:47,440
and uh what their experiences are but uh

362
00:17:45,559 --> 00:17:49,600

paying them a man's wage uh but also I I

366
00:17:54,360 --> 00:17:58,320
want him to use me as a job reference

367

when you're a job reference for somebody

368
00:17:58,320 --> 00:18:02,840
your job when somebody calls you isn't

369
00:18:00,440 --> 00:18:05,400
to play The Devil's Advocate and to say

370
00:18:02,840 --> 00:18:09,000
good and bad about uh the young man

371
00:18:05,400 --> 00:18:11,960

job but you're going to talk like here

375
00:18:15,840 --> 00:18:20,799
where uh Gatlin is totally focused on

376
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,919
helping me he's there ahead of me quite

377
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:25,240

384
00:18:39,080 --> 00:18:44,200
of things you say when somebody uses you

385
00:18:41,679 --> 00:18:46,679
for a job reference for a young person

386
00:18:44,200 --> 00:18:48,200
uh you focus on the strengths that

387
00:18:46,679 --> 00:18:50,440
breaks to young people let them wander

388
00:18:48,200 --> 00:18:52,840
around a little bit let them uh uh you

389
00:18:50,440 --> 00:18:54,520
know give them a bit of time but also

390
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:56,559
when you're a job reference make sure

391
00:18:54,520 --> 00:18:59,320
it's a solid reference or don't even

392
00:18:56,559 --> 00:19:01,240
offer

393
00:18:59,320 --> 00:19:04,159
so I mentioned earlier that Gatlin

full speed at at the end of the day here

399
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:17,840
he is on a a post without my help

400
00:19:15,320 --> 00:19:20,440
without my intervention and he is

401
00:19:17,840 --> 00:19:23,400
doggedly determined on each one of these

402
00:19:20,440 --> 00:19:26,960
posts sure he doesn't have a 240b man

403
00:19:23,400 --> 00:19:29,600
swing like I do uh but I got you know 40

404
00:19:26,960 --> 00:19:31,720
years of experience Beyond him him don't

405
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:33,840
expect people to be at your experience

406
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:36,240
level give them that Grace where they

407
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:38,200
can figure things out and give them the

408
00:19:36,240 --> 00:19:41,000
time don't sit there over their shoulder

409
00:19:38,200 --> 00:19:43,679
and helicopter them and micromanage

410
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:46,320
every post that Gatlin runs into he just

411
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:49,240
gets better at doing what he needs to do

412
00:19:46,320 --> 00:19:51,480
for that particular job and uh you know

413
00:19:49,240 --> 00:19:54,880
this is an hour and a half into him uh

414
00:19:51,480 --> 00:19:56,840
driving uh post and I I enjoy hearing

415
00:19:54,880 --> 00:20:00,640
him make man noises when he gets up off

416
00:19:56,840 --> 00:20:00,640
the ground like uh ooh

417
00:20:00,679 --> 00:20:06,039
he it cracks me up so then I don't feel

418
00:20:03,200 --> 00:20:09,679
so so old having a young person around

419
00:20:06,039 --> 00:20:11,919
is just as good for me as it is for him

420
00:20:09,679 --> 00:20:13,559
to be around now I've got a couple other

421
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:16,200
fellas that come out that are in their

422
00:20:13,559 --> 00:20:18,760
30s and then frons is as Elder he's

423
00:20:16,200 --> 00:20:21,840
retired so them old Cowboys come out and

424
00:20:18,760 --> 00:20:24,280
help me too uh but uh I so I say I'm a

425
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,440
solo Builder but the fact of the matter

426
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:29,159
is I could use a full-time young man

427
00:20:26,440 --> 00:20:30,600
like Gatlin uh but uh I got to go pick

428
00:20:29,159 --> 00:20:32,720
him up he doesn't have his driver's

429
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:35,280
license yet so why am I letting him

430
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:38,240
drive my stuff around uh one he can't

431
00:20:35,280 --> 00:20:41,360
hurt anybody and uh two I got a uh

432
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:43,799
regulator on that uh UTV he could not go

433
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:46,760
70 miles an hour will he make mistakes

434
00:20:43,799 --> 00:20:49,400
on it well I hope not uh but that is the

435
00:20:46,760 --> 00:20:51,880
nature of being a kid you remember when

436
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:54,640
you were a kid and you treat kids better

437
00:20:51,880 --> 00:20:57,200
than somebody misuse you you make sure

438
00:20:54,640 --> 00:20:58,880
you don't misuse some other kid your job

439
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:01,640
is to help young men get off off the

440
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:03,320
ground and and be excited about work and

441
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:06,080

uh let them get excited it doesn't cost

445
00:21:10,640 --> 00:21:15,760

470
00:22:17,799 --> 00:22:23,600
the whole day went a lot faster for me

471
00:22:20,080 --> 00:22:26,679
listen I get tired uh running fences too

472
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:28,000
and uh they are a heck of a job so uh to

473
00:22:26,679 --> 00:22:30,720
have somebody out there that I could

474
00:22:28,000 --> 00:22:32,240
talk with this bottom line that he's

475
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,760
fiddling with pulling them out of the

476
00:22:32,240 --> 00:22:36,919
dirt I'm not sure about five strand barb

477
00:22:34,760 --> 00:22:39,159
wire with one just a couple inches off

478
00:22:36,919 --> 00:22:41,760
the ground but I appreciate Gatlin glad

479
00:22:39,159 --> 00:22:44,159
to help glad to have him working this

480
00:22:41,760 --> 00:22:47,080
big boy right there that's a fence

481
00:22:44,159 --> 00:22:50,360
wrecker everybody I have seen him come

482
00:22:47,080 --> 00:22:53,200
through this fence after another bowl

483
00:22:50,360 --> 00:22:56,559
and then when he knocked that bowl down

484
00:22:53,200 --> 00:23:00,039
he sat on it to kill

485
00:22:56,559 --> 00:23:02,480
it and uh d did out of all of its energy

486
00:23:00,039 --> 00:23:04,840
he did as soon as he put his 2,000 plus

487
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:07,480
pounds on anyway that guy when he wants

488
00:23:04,840 --> 00:23:09,840
to walk through a fence a fence doesn't

489
00:23:07,480 --> 00:23:12,240
mean anything to him he just goes right

490
00:23:09,840 --> 00:23:15,039
through it so he'll come through my lane

491
00:23:12,240 --> 00:23:17,360
and then fight the bowl on that side so

492
00:23:15,039 --> 00:23:19,480
the bowl on that side's a young one now

493
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:22,600
but it used to be an older one who ran

494
00:23:19,480 --> 00:23:24,320
the show Romo was his name and he had

495
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,919
horns and I thought for sure this guy

496
00:23:24,320 --> 00:23:30,440
wouldn't win he came through and whipped

497
00:23:27,919 --> 00:23:30,440
old ROM

498
00:23:35,679 --> 00:23:42,600

532
00:25:26,480 --> 00:25:30,200
while it takes a while but it's not

533
00:25:28,120 --> 00:25:31,960
difficult cool anyone can do it really

00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:49,320
Island good Lord oh my God you every day

541
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:50,840

542
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,880
right well I'm going to wrap this thing

543
00:25:50,840 --> 00:25:56,799
up we did uh let's see a little over um

544
00:25:54,880 --> 00:25:59,480
I'm going to guess that's 3/10 so we did

545
00:25:56,799 --> 00:26:03,000
a little over a half mile fence repair

546
00:25:59,480 --> 00:26:04,279
I've got 1.2 miles around the outside

547
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:07,480
then I'm going to guess another couple

548
00:26:04,279 --> 00:26:09,520
of miles going up and down so there's

549
00:26:07,480 --> 00:26:11,720
plenty of fence to do between now and

550
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:13,039
