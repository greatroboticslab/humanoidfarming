1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:03,199
so it's that time of the year again

2
00:00:01,680 --> 00:00:05,680
things are starting to warm up

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:07,200
it's past mother's day now and we want

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:08,240
to get out in our yard and we want to

5
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,760
plant a garden

6
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:12,160
but like a lot of us we don't like

7
00:00:09,760 --> 00:00:14,320
watering those gardens so i have a great

8
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:15,759
solution and alternative for you that's

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:18,640
cheap and effective

10
00:00:15,759 --> 00:00:18,640
so let's get started

11
00:00:19,660 --> 00:00:24,949
[Music]

12
00:00:25,279 --> 00:00:29,199
so this is my backyard area we have

13
00:00:27,680 --> 00:00:31,039
three raised beds here

14
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:32,559
in my backyard we started this about

15
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:34,800
three years ago

16
00:00:32,559 --> 00:00:36,160
they're just made of out of two by sixes

17
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,840
with a post

18
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,760
in the corner and then we basically

19
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:42,239
brought in a leaf compost

20
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,160
uh you could call it topsoil if you want

21
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:46,160
but it was a leaf basically i'd leave

22
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:47,520
compost and filled them in

23
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,440
and we started our garden like i said

24
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:51,280
about three years ago so like i said we

25
00:00:49,440 --> 00:00:53,120
started this about three years ago

26
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,039
um we have a bunch of vegetables in here

27
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,320
we have tomatoes cucumbers we have

28
00:00:55,039 --> 00:00:58,640
asparagus

29
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:00,480
we actually have some strawberries um so

30
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:02,079
we really enjoy that um that's something

31
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,800
that my family really likes to do some

32
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:05,680
organic

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,479
gardening um so basically what i'm gonna

34
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,960
show you today

35
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,720
is drip irrigation i know a lot of us

36
00:01:08,960 --> 00:01:11,040
out there think of drip irrigation i

37
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,600
think

38
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,159
it's a lot of work but it's not it's

39
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:16,960
actually

40
00:01:14,159 --> 00:01:18,640
a lot of fun you can customize it so i'm

41
00:01:16,960 --> 00:01:20,720
going to show you how i did my

42
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:22,720
raised garden beds back here and how you

43
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:24,720
can do it at your home as well

44
00:01:22,720 --> 00:01:26,080
so basically what drip irrigation is

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:28,080
it's basically tubing

46
00:01:26,080 --> 00:01:29,439
that runs throughout your yard and you

47
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:31,600
have basically emitters

48
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:32,720
that run off of it into your various

49
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:35,200
plants

50
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:35,759
this is a half inch pipe here they sell

51
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:38,479
in a

52
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,159
uh 100 feet at home depot and i believe

53
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:42,799
they sell it at lowe's as well

54
00:01:40,159 --> 00:01:43,920
um this hundred foot pipe is less than

55
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,240
10 bucks

56
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:47,600
um basically from here you would connect

57
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:49,600
it to a water timer

58
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,840
i'll show you that in a couple minutes

59
00:01:49,600 --> 00:01:54,399
um and then basically off of here

60
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:56,479
you can run lines to your plants so like

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:58,240
i said home depot sells this rain bird

62
00:01:56,479 --> 00:02:00,079
water timer i've had this for two

63
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:00,719
seasons now i haven't had any problems

64
00:02:00,079 --> 00:02:03,280
with it

65
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:05,040
it just hooks up to my faucet here

66
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:07,439
basically what's really cool about this

67
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:09,440
is it's battery operated you can turn

68
00:02:07,439 --> 00:02:10,879
the dial you can set the clock you can

69
00:02:09,440 --> 00:02:13,040
set the duration to how

70
00:02:10,879 --> 00:02:14,879
long you want you can have it come on

71
00:02:13,040 --> 00:02:16,640
two times a day if you would like

72
00:02:14,879 --> 00:02:18,400
you can have it come on any day the week

73
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:19,599
every day a week however long as you

74
00:02:18,400 --> 00:02:22,720
want

75
00:02:19,599 --> 00:02:23,520
you can also have a manual turn on here

76
00:02:22,720 --> 00:02:25,520
as well

77
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:26,640
and there's also a rain delay as well

78
00:02:25,520 --> 00:02:28,400
here

79
00:02:26,640 --> 00:02:30,400
like i said two seasons i haven't had a

80
00:02:28,400 --> 00:02:32,000
problem with this and it's only 35 bucks

81
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:34,239
at home depot

82
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,519
from there what you're gonna do is

83
00:02:34,239 --> 00:02:39,280
you're gonna connect

84
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:39,760
your um water here basically you have

85
00:02:39,280 --> 00:02:41,920
your half

86
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:43,599
inch line come down here you have a

87
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:46,959
couple connections here

88
00:02:43,599 --> 00:02:48,480
that go into a backflow preventer here

89
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:50,000
and then your half inch line is just

90
00:02:48,480 --> 00:02:51,840
going to go out underneath

91
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,840
your ground and into where you want it

92
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,280
out in your yard so like i said i have

93
00:02:53,840 --> 00:02:58,319
my half inch line here

94
00:02:55,280 --> 00:03:00,159
i just run it down in my mulch bed here

95
00:02:58,319 --> 00:03:05,760
and i just have it buried and it

96
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:08,800
basically goes along my house here

97
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:11,040
and it goes all along here

98
00:03:08,800 --> 00:03:13,040
and then i have a turn here they sell

99
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,920
elbows that you can cut and easily put

100
00:03:13,040 --> 00:03:18,879
together

101
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:22,319
and it goes all underground here

102
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:22,319
we're going to go into my backyard

103
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,720
and then basically what happens is it

104
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,360
goes along here underground

105
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,519
all the way back to my raised beds so

106
00:03:31,360 --> 00:03:35,840
once we come around my fence line here

107
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:37,680
we come up here and then we connect in

108
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,040
here again to another half inch and i

109
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,760
have this just long

110
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:43,440
run along the middle of the raised bed

111
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,319
here

112
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:47,360
and then basically what these uh brown

113
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:49,599
ones are

114
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,480
these are four inch emitters so they're

115
00:03:49,599 --> 00:03:53,200
spaced out

116
00:03:50,480 --> 00:03:54,319
four inches apart and basically they

117
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:57,439
emit water

118
00:03:54,319 --> 00:03:58,480
out into your garden it's a really cool

119
00:03:57,439 --> 00:04:00,000
feature

120
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:01,840
they're really easy to hook up to your

121
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,439
half inch line here with

122
00:04:01,840 --> 00:04:05,200
the adapters that they bought you can

123
00:04:03,439 --> 00:04:07,840
buy at the store

124
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:09,040
and i just have that run around my

125
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:12,480
garden

126
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:14,319
um and then also in the middle of my

127
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:15,920
garden in certain areas i have these

128
00:04:14,319 --> 00:04:18,160
larger

129
00:04:15,920 --> 00:04:19,040
adapters here that they just plug in and

130
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,919
they also

131
00:04:19,040 --> 00:04:22,479
emit water as well so what i'm going to

132
00:04:21,919 --> 00:04:24,080
do next

133
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:25,919
is i'm going to turn on this section

134
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:26,320
here so you guys can see what it looks

135
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:28,720
like

136
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:30,240
coming out of the water lines so like i

137
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,040
said it's really easy to manually turn

138
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,960
this on

139
00:04:31,040 --> 00:04:34,880
you're gonna hit the water nail you're

140
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:37,680
gonna just set your duration

141
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:38,720
um i have it already set here for 10

142
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,919
minutes and you just hit

143
00:04:38,720 --> 00:04:42,720
ok and then the water is going to start

144
00:04:41,919 --> 00:04:44,320
flowing out

145
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:45,759
through your system and we're going to

146
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:46,639
go back and check it out at the raised

147
00:04:45,759 --> 00:04:48,720
bed now

148
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,000
so we're back out to our raised bed here

149
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:52,560
um as you can see here

150
00:04:50,000 --> 00:04:53,840
our emitters they are dripping here

151
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:55,759
every four inches

152
00:04:53,840 --> 00:04:58,000
um and what's really cool about this

153
00:04:55,759 --> 00:04:59,040
line is you can have it maneuver

154
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:00,720
wherever you want

155
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:02,560
you could have it run like a snake you

156
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:03,360
could have it run it directly over your

157
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,520
plants

158
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:08,240
where they're at um this section of my

159
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:10,400
garden right here is asparagus

160
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,120
as you can see here you have these

161
00:05:10,400 --> 00:05:15,440
emitter as emitters as well

162
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:16,400
these ones emit out more water than

163
00:05:15,440 --> 00:05:19,840
these ones

164
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:21,919
um so they're really great for shrubs uh

165
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:23,120
flowers plants whatever you can put

166
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:24,880
these wherever you want

167
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:26,160
so this section over here we just put

168
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,880
these in

169
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:31,120
this year these raised beds um we have

170
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:33,440
some various vegetables throughout here

171
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:35,120
um what's really cool about over here is

172
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,759
we also have the emitters

173
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:38,560
as well uh they're spaced out four

174
00:05:37,759 --> 00:05:41,360
inches

175
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:42,160
um basically i'm just using these uh

176
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:44,960
staples

177
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:45,680
uh here to clamp them down and then from

178
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:50,000
here

179
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:52,240
they also sell these uh poly tube here

180
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:53,919
these are a solid tube and what's really

181
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:56,319
cool about these tubes are

182
00:05:53,919 --> 00:05:56,960
is you can pretty much run these tubes

183
00:05:56,319 --> 00:06:00,080
to out

184
00:05:56,960 --> 00:06:03,680
anywhere you want so for example

185
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:06,960
this tube basically runs

186
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:07,840
and connects all four or actually all

187
00:06:06,960 --> 00:06:10,720
three

188
00:06:07,840 --> 00:06:11,919
of these raised beds together and then

189
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:14,560
this tube here

190
00:06:11,919 --> 00:06:16,639
runs underground and then it comes

191
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:20,080
through this garden here

192
00:06:16,639 --> 00:06:22,319
and then my half inch poly tube

193
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:23,680
is underground there and i have it just

194
00:06:22,319 --> 00:06:26,479
connected to there

195
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:27,280
so that main water source is putting

196
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,560
that water

197
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:33,039
through that small tube here and it's

198
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:35,600
coming through here

199
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:36,880
and it's connecting these three raised

200
00:06:35,600 --> 00:06:38,240
beds together

201
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:40,240
and they're all getting the drip

202
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,360
irrigation together so you're probably

203
00:06:40,240 --> 00:06:43,840
wondering by now

204
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:44,800
how easy is it to do it joe it's really

205
00:06:43,840 --> 00:06:47,759
easy

206
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:49,440
anybody can do it my wife's done it um

207
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,680
i've showed her how to do it she can do

208
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,919
it

209
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:53,440
uh anyone can do it so let's i'm gonna

210
00:06:51,919 --> 00:06:55,840
show you a couple examples

211
00:06:53,440 --> 00:06:57,520
of how to get connections off of your

212
00:06:55,840 --> 00:06:59,680
main water line here

213
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,840
so let's just use this pipe here as an

214
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:02,960
example let's just say that your timer

215
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:05,440
is down here

216
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:06,720
and then your end point is down here so

217
00:07:05,440 --> 00:07:09,120
what you're going to want to do

218
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:09,919
is when you have various points where

219
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:12,240
you want to

220
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:13,759
connect off of it they sell this punch

221
00:07:12,240 --> 00:07:15,919
tool here

222
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:17,840
it's a really cool tool all you do is

223
00:07:15,919 --> 00:07:20,720
basically

224
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:23,759
put a little bit of pressure and you're

225
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:25,680
going to just make a little hole here

226
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,759
and then from there they sell these

227
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:29,840
little barb

228
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:31,759
here this is a straight one it has a

229
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:34,160
connection on both ends

230
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:35,919
all you're going to do is basically push

231
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:37,680
that in there

232
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,759
and once you hear that popping noise

233
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:41,680
that you know that that's in there

234
00:07:39,759 --> 00:07:44,080
and then from there you can connect your

235
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:46,400
four inch spacing

236
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:47,919
emitters if you want but for this

237
00:07:46,400 --> 00:07:50,479
example what i'm going to show you is

238
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:52,879
how to make an extension off of this

239
00:07:50,479 --> 00:07:54,160
so basically you have your smaller poly

240
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,919
tube here

241
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:57,199
and then you can just connect that to

242
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,440
here

243
00:07:57,199 --> 00:08:00,560
it's really hard sometimes to connect

244
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:03,280
these together

245
00:08:00,560 --> 00:08:04,400
so what i like to do is either get a

246
00:08:03,280 --> 00:08:06,160
blowtorch here

247
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:08,639
i got this at harbor freight it's pretty

248
00:08:06,160 --> 00:08:09,919
inexpensive you just put a butane at the

249
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,120
bottom

250
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:14,560
you can also even use a lighter as well

251
00:08:13,120 --> 00:08:18,319
basically what you want to do is just

252
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:21,520
heat up this section here a little bit

253
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:21,520
it's a little windy today

254
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:28,560
just a little bit and then from there

255
00:08:27,039 --> 00:08:31,120
you're just going to feed that onto your

256
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:31,120
barb there

257
00:08:31,199 --> 00:08:35,360
and then it's connected and then at the

258
00:08:33,599 --> 00:08:38,000
other end you can connect these little

259
00:08:35,360 --> 00:08:39,039
emitters here um these come in a pack a

260
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:41,279
10 pack here

261
00:08:39,039 --> 00:08:42,080
i believe they're i think they're less

262
00:08:41,279 --> 00:08:43,599
than

263
00:08:42,080 --> 00:08:45,600
two dollars or three dollars something

264
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,200
like that um you can find these at home

265
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:50,880
depot or lowe's

266
00:08:47,200 --> 00:08:53,360
these put out two gallons per hour

267
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:55,360
i don't get caught up in that too much i

268
00:08:53,360 --> 00:08:56,640
just look out at my plants if they need

269
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,959
a little bit more water

270
00:08:56,640 --> 00:09:01,120
i adjust my timer that way i don't get

271
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:02,560
too caught up in the gallons per hour

272
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:04,080
but basically from here you're going to

273
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:05,600
take your poly tube here and you're

274
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:07,519
going to connect it together

275
00:09:05,600 --> 00:09:08,880
and again these poly tubes are a little

276
00:09:07,519 --> 00:09:10,640
bit hard to connect

277
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,760
so what i like to do is just heat up the

278
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:13,760
end a little bit here

279
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:23,839
once i can get it to go

280
00:09:28,030 --> 00:09:32,399
[Applause]

281
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:33,279
and then you can just connect the green

282
00:09:32,399 --> 00:09:37,040
end

283
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:39,680
to here and again you can easily

284
00:09:37,040 --> 00:09:41,120
cut this tube um what i use to cut this

285
00:09:39,680 --> 00:09:43,760
is basically uh this

286
00:09:41,120 --> 00:09:45,200
knife here it's used for pecks um again

287
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:46,720
you can find these pretty much at any

288
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:50,480
hardware store as well

289
00:09:46,720 --> 00:09:52,000
um so if you have to cut this it's very

290
00:09:50,480 --> 00:09:55,680
easy to cut

291
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,040
you just clamp that on and it cuts right

292
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:59,360
off

293
00:09:57,040 --> 00:10:01,440
and then from there they also sell these

294
00:09:59,360 --> 00:10:02,160
adapters as well they sell straight ones

295
00:10:01,440 --> 00:10:04,560
they sell the

296
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:08,320
elbows as i have here and all you got to

297
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:10,959
do is basically just feed this on

298
00:10:08,320 --> 00:10:13,040
until it gets pretty tight and then you

299
00:10:10,959 --> 00:10:15,120
have your connections there

300
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,320
another great thing they sell is these

301
00:10:15,120 --> 00:10:18,959
little goof

302
00:10:16,320 --> 00:10:20,160
plugs so basically what happens is if

303
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:23,360
you make a mistake

304
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:24,320
uh in your main water line here um or if

305
00:10:23,360 --> 00:10:26,480
you want to stop

306
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:28,880
uh one of these lines as well which can

307
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:32,240
be cut with a pair of scissors

308
00:10:28,880 --> 00:10:33,839
as well what basically what you do is

309
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:36,079
say if i had a hole

310
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:38,240
in my line here and i didn't want that

311
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:39,600
line anymore or that hole there anymore

312
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:43,360
you can just take one of these goof

313
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:43,360
plugs and you can

314
00:10:43,920 --> 00:10:47,839
just snap those in there

315
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:52,560
and you're good to go so here's a

316
00:10:51,279 --> 00:10:54,880
perfect example here

317
00:10:52,560 --> 00:10:56,079
of how to use that extension that i just

318
00:10:54,880 --> 00:10:58,160
showed you

319
00:10:56,079 --> 00:11:00,079
in your various plants in your yard i

320
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:03,279
have here blueberry bushes we have them

321
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:04,240
along a our fence line here they come

322
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,320
from hamilton

323
00:11:04,240 --> 00:11:07,600
new jersey a lot of you don't know but

324
00:11:06,320 --> 00:11:08,720
hamilton's actually the blueberry

325
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,800
capital of the world

326
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,640
um there's more blueberry plants there

327
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:14,959
than i've ever seen

328
00:11:12,640 --> 00:11:16,720
the blueberries are just the best so we

329
00:11:14,959 --> 00:11:17,920
went down there a couple years ago and

330
00:11:16,720 --> 00:11:20,000
we picked up some

331
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
and we put them out in our yard so

332
00:11:20,000 --> 00:11:23,600
basically what i did was is

333
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:25,519
i have my half inch line underground

334
00:11:23,600 --> 00:11:27,839
here that runs back

335
00:11:25,519 --> 00:11:29,440
to my garden bed but what's really great

336
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,640
about the half inch line is you can just

337
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:32,880
branch off of that

338
00:11:30,640 --> 00:11:34,800
to other various parts of your yard so

339
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,519
that's basically what i did here

340
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,240
um i have my tubing come out for my half

341
00:11:37,519 --> 00:11:40,399
inch

342
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,519
with my straight barb connector like i

343
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:43,519
just showed you

344
00:11:41,519 --> 00:11:44,800
um and then from there i've run my poly

345
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:47,360
tubing to the

346
00:11:44,800 --> 00:11:48,000
drip uh emitter here and then what's

347
00:11:47,360 --> 00:11:50,720
really cool

348
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:52,000
is they sell these stakes as well um and

349
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:54,240
you can just connect these

350
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:56,399
to the end here you can just place them

351
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:56,800
to the base of the plant and you can

352
00:11:56,399 --> 00:11:59,760
just

353
00:11:56,800 --> 00:12:00,560
easily segregate basically what each

354
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:02,560
plant

355
00:12:00,560 --> 00:12:04,000
is and you can easily segregate water

356
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,600
into each plant

357
00:12:04,000 --> 00:12:08,000
so i have them go into each of the

358
00:12:05,600 --> 00:12:10,160
blueberry bushes and it's really easy

359
00:12:08,000 --> 00:12:12,079
to keep them ordered as well and

360
00:12:10,160 --> 00:12:12,560
basically i have that seeing concept

361
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:15,279
along

362
00:12:12,560 --> 00:12:17,440
my flower beds as well each of these

363
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:20,240
plants along my flower bed here

364
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:21,279
has that same extension concept as the

365
00:12:20,240 --> 00:12:23,200
blueberries do

366
00:12:21,279 --> 00:12:24,560
so what's really great is you can keep

367
00:12:23,200 --> 00:12:26,240
your rose bushes

368
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
you can keep any kind of shrub that you

369
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:30,240
have watered

370
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:32,720
and basically i just have that half inch

371
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:34,959
line just keep running along

372
00:12:32,720 --> 00:12:37,360
my mulch line there along the edge of my

373
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:40,000
house and i can easily just branch

374
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,959
off of there and get each of these

375
00:12:40,000 --> 00:12:44,320
plants

376
00:12:40,959 --> 00:12:48,000
enough water to last out through the

377
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:49,519
summertime so that's pretty much it

378
00:12:48,000 --> 00:12:51,120
today i just wanted to show you the drip

379
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:52,880
irrigation in my yard

380
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:54,560
um like i said i've had this for about

381
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:57,839
three years now i love it

382
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:59,519
it just runs so smoothly we can keep all

383
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,519
of our plants nicely water throughout

384
00:12:59,519 --> 00:13:04,720
the spring and the summertime

385
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:05,279
our garden loves it it's really easy to

386
00:13:04,720 --> 00:13:06,880
do

387
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,480
you can probably do it less than a

388
00:13:06,880 --> 00:13:11,279
hundred bucks maybe even a

389
00:13:08,480 --> 00:13:12,079
less than 50 bucks depending on the size

390
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:14,000
of your garden

391
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:15,440
or your yard i think it's really

392
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:16,639
inexpensive

393
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:18,720

394
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:21,200

just a quick note for the products that

410
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:50,560
were used in today's video

411
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:52,240
pretty much everything can be found at

412
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,160
home depot or lowe's

413
00:13:52,240 --> 00:13:56,240
they pretty much have the same variation

414
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,639
of the drip irrigation adapters

415
00:13:56,240 --> 00:14:00,880
at either store the only thing i didn't

416
00:13:58,639 --> 00:14:04,320
purchase at home depot or those was the

417
00:14:00,880 --> 00:14:06,079
brown uh garden adapter um the four inch

418
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:08,000
spacing i couldn't get the four inch

419
00:14:06,079 --> 00:14:10,160
spacing at home depot or lowe's

420
00:14:08,000 --> 00:14:11,360
so i actually got that off of rain birds

421
00:14:10,160 --> 00:14:13,440
website

422
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:15,199
