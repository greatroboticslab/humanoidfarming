00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:07,120
A mechanical harvester can replace an

2
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:10,639
entire manual workforce, harvesting

3
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:12,880
dozens of acres per day. This method

4
00:00:10,639 --> 00:00:15,400
also helps to minimize the risk of

5
00:00:12,880 --> 00:00:18,160
damage to the

6
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:21,600
cabbage. The machine's front unit

7
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:24,800
handles all the work. As it moves across

8
00:00:21,600 --> 00:00:27,519
the field, rotating metal spindles wrap

9
00:00:24,800 --> 00:00:30,240
around the cotton fibers, pulling them

10
00:00:27,519 --> 00:00:30,240
from the plants.
