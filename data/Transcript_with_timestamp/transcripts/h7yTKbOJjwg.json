  "text": "[Applause] Heat. Heat. [Music] Heat up here. [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Applause] [Music] Heat [Music] up here. [Music] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] Heat up here. [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Music] [Applause] [Music] [Applause] I charge the power fans. This video comes to you from a corn field located in southwest Indiana where a 16 row 30in John Deere C16F folding corn head is harvesting the crop paired with a 690 engine horsepower 460 bushel John Deere X9100 combine. In this video, I would like to share with you the abilities of this 40 foot wide corn head as well as its production history, specifications, and list price tag. But first, let's head out to the field so you can see and hear all this harvesting action. [Applause] [Music] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] [Music] Heat up here. [Music] Heat up here. Heat up here. [Music] [Music] [Applause] The 40 foot wide, 16 row, 30in space John Deere C6. 16F folding corn head was introduced in model year 2020 as part of the company's range of C series corn heads which includes nine different models of rigid and folding headers manufactured at John Deere's Harvester Works located in East Molen, Illinois. The corn heads range from the C6R six row 30in head all the way up to the C18F 20in folding corn head. The C16F is equipped with a 19in augur which allows the header to consume a large amount of corn. The C16F can harvest 65 more acres per day than a 12 row 30in space corn head. Paired with an X9100, this header allows the large combine to harvest 7,200 bushels of corn per hour. The farm featured in this video is harvesting their crop with two John Deere X9100 combines equipped with the C16F corn head. The combines harvest 14,400 bushels of corn per hour. that requires four J&M 1150 grain carts with a carrying capacity of 1,150 bushels. The carts are operated by four 620 engine horsepower John Deere 9620 RX tractors. It takes a fleet of 13 semi trucks to haul the corn away from all this harvesting action. The C16F, in addition to picking corn in a hurry, also helps to size and reduce the amount of residue out in the field. It's equipped with Romax chopping stock rolls, which help chop up the stocks into pieces that are 6 in or less, which help speed up the breakdown and burial of the residue left out in the field without it washing or blowing away. The headers are also equipped with John Deere stock deflectors which are used to push down the stubble and fracture it which again helps in the breakdown of the residue and it also reduces the chance of damage to the tires and tracks on the combines. These deflectors are placed behind each row unit across the header. You can see from the aerial views of the video how the Romax units and stock stompers leave the residue in the field as flat as a pancake. The outside points on the C16F cornhead snouts light up at night. This feature allows the farmer to have better visibility of the 40ft wide cornet from inside the cab as well as the grain cart operator to have a good view of where the corn head ends and how far they need to be away from the combine. This header's ability to fold up speeds up the harvesting process. When it goes into transport mode, it drops down from 40 feet wide to 20.75 ft. Being able to leave the header attached to the combine and move on to the next field saves a lot of time without the hassle of loading it onto a header wagon and moving it separately from the combine. The C16F weighs in at [Music] 13,462 lb. And according to John Deere.com, it has a list price of $270,520 for model year 2022. The C16F corn head featured in this video is attached to a John Deere X9100 combine. This machine was introduced in model year 2020 and went into full production for model year 2021. It's manufactured at the company's Harvester Works located in East Molen, Illinois. It's powered by a 13.6 L John Deere Power Tech 830 cubic in engine rated at 690 engine horsepower. It threshes grain using a pair of 24 in diameter, 11 1/2 ft long rotors. It has a grain bin storage capacity of 460 bushels that unloads through a 31 ft augur at 5.3 bushels per second. According to John Deere.com, the list price for an X9100 combine for mall year 2022 is 921,348. [Applause] [Music] [Applause] Heat up here. [Music] Heat. Heat. I think that's good. [Music] I'm up in the cab of the John Deere X9 1100 combine and we're harvesting corn today with a John Deere C 16F stock master. This is probably about heat. Heat up here. Heat up here. I hope you've enjoyed spending some time out in the field hearing and seeing the capabilities of the 16 row 30in John Deere C16F cornhead paired with the X9 1100 combine. I'd like to hear in the comment section below this video if you raise corn on your farm. Tell me about the combine that you're operating and the corn head that you use with it.
