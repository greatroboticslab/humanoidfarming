  "text": "in the side meeting I was in the main message was who will be the spokesperson who is this trusted messenger who will drive The Innovation platform and what was clear was that we may be sidelined traditional leaders we have not looked at non scientists non uh technocrats and we should be focusing more on empowering them with the scientific evidence because they live in these basins they are the ones who are affected by these problems and they should be given capacity to inform policy processes that's where sustainability will come from African institutions are weak they are weak because we have not invested in research there's still very little appreciation of the role that research plays in development and for as long as our researchers are sitting idle with no resources they doing their research in a closet within the station and not getting out to the farmers there is no way that we are going to help Africa feed itself so I think the starting point is a call on governance can we use African money to invest in African research institutions that way we will have researchers who can follow the development agenda we have policies that cannot be implemented because they are created bottom down we want policies that are created bottom up where the evidence comes from practitioners but it's packaged such that it can fed directly into policy and I think that's what the Innovation platforms have a new way of doing business where you don't stop a project level but you move vertically to inform change at a higher level District National and Regional level so that you have policies that save the people really it's exciting because Innovation platform is about equipping all the actors to be drivers of change but we are saying this change has to be led through evidence and evidence that emanates from research so when we are talking about impact and outcomes the the chain starts from those who are affected by the problem being around the table and those who want to experiment research and deliver options for development sitting as equal partners and that's what the new CG is",
