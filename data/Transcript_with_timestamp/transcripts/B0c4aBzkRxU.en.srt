joining us and I'm going to turn this

20
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:51,300
webinar over to Lisa well good evening

21
00:00:49,219 --> 00:00:53,520
thank you all for joining us our

22
00:00:51,300 --> 00:00:56,370
speakers tonight all this as specialists

23
00:00:53,520 --> 00:00:58,890
are dealing with many of the same winner

24
00:00:56,370 --> 00:01:01,770
management issues and challenges that

25
00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:04,409
you are and so please feel free to ask

26
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:06,299
questions I was asked to talk about

27
00:01:04,409 --> 00:01:09,350
assessing cow and ball condition in

28
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,880
managing bolts in a tough winter

29
00:01:09,350 --> 00:01:13,710
situation and so the first thing I'm

30
00:01:11,880 --> 00:01:16,979
going to talk about is body condition

31
00:01:13,710 --> 00:01:20,130
scoring this is a really nice three-step

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:23,220
system for body condition scoring first

33
00:01:20,130 --> 00:01:26,100
I'd encourage you to look at the ribs of

34
00:01:23,220 --> 00:01:29,549
the cow or the bull that's denoted by

35
00:01:26,100 --> 00:01:33,060
number one on your screen if you can see

36
00:01:29,549 --> 00:01:35,369
those last two ribs and that animal is

37
00:01:33,060 --> 00:01:38,250
in a body condition score less than five

38
00:01:35,369 --> 00:01:40,950
if those last two ribs are not visible

39
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:44,520
that animal is in a body condition score

40
00:01:40,950 --> 00:01:46,649
five or greater next we would encourage

41
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:50,250
you to look at the spine that's denoted

42
00:01:46,649 --> 00:01:54,180
by number two here on the cap Wow

43
00:01:50,250 --> 00:01:56,549
if that spine is visible the animal is

44
00:01:54,180 --> 00:01:59,969
in a body condition score of three or

45
00:01:56,549 --> 00:02:02,119
less next look at the shape between the

46
00:01:59,969 --> 00:02:04,710
hooks and the pins in the dairy industry

47
00:02:02,119 --> 00:02:06,230
we call that area of the Theroux

48
00:02:04,710 --> 00:02:09,950
if that animal

49
00:02:06,230 --> 00:02:12,820
has a strong v-shape in that area that

50
00:02:09,950 --> 00:02:16,700
animals in a body condition score - if

51
00:02:12,820 --> 00:02:19,510
it's a strong V but a little more flat

52
00:02:16,700 --> 00:02:22,250
that would be a body condition score 3 a

53
00:02:19,510 --> 00:02:25,430
V shape would be a body condition score

54
00:02:22,250 --> 00:02:27,380
4 and then as we move into a u-shape in

55
00:02:25,430 --> 00:02:30,980
that area it would be a body condition

56
00:02:27,380 --> 00:02:33,440
score 5 and as we move into a flatter

57
00:02:30,980 --> 00:02:37,010
shape those move into body condition

58
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:39,170
scores six seven and eight in the United

59
00:02:37,010 --> 00:02:42,410
States our beef body condition scores

60
00:02:39,170 --> 00:02:46,190
range from a 1 to a 9 a body condition

61
00:02:42,410 --> 00:02:49,460
score one is considered a callable that

62
00:02:46,190 --> 00:02:51,800
is starved very emaciated and a body

63
00:02:49,460 --> 00:02:54,379
condition score 9 is considered an

64
00:02:51,800 --> 00:02:57,030
animal that is obese

65
00:02:54,379 --> 00:03:00,060
so let's look at body condition scoring

66
00:02:57,030 --> 00:03:03,120
we would like to see our animals in a

67
00:03:00,060 --> 00:03:05,489
body condition score 5 to 7 a calving

68
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:07,319
time those are the two body condition

69
00:03:05,489 --> 00:03:10,019
scores on the right side of the screen

70
00:03:07,319 --> 00:03:12,390
here so we'd like our material cows to

71
00:03:10,019 --> 00:03:15,810
be in a body condition score of 5 again

72
00:03:12,390 --> 00:03:19,290
we are not able to see those last two

73
00:03:15,810 --> 00:03:19,950
ribs the spine is not available it's not

74
00:03:19,290 --> 00:03:22,620
visible

75
00:03:19,950 --> 00:03:24,329
excuse me and the shape between the

76
00:03:22,620 --> 00:03:27,150
hooks and the pins is in a strong

77
00:03:24,329 --> 00:03:29,190
u-shape and so you can see that this cow

78
00:03:27,150 --> 00:03:32,010
at the top on the right hand side is in

79
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:34,349
a body condition score 5 the cow below

80
00:03:32,010 --> 00:03:37,799
her we cannot see those last two ribs

81
00:03:34,349 --> 00:03:40,590
the spine is not visible in the shape

82
00:03:37,799 --> 00:03:43,109
between her hooks and pins is very flat

83
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:46,349
and so she's in about a condition score

84
00:03:43,109 --> 00:03:49,650
of 6 or greater now why did we talk

85
00:03:46,349 --> 00:03:52,349
about this well for every body condition

86
00:03:49,650 --> 00:03:55,379
score you lose you lose between 80 and

87
00:03:52,349 --> 00:03:58,650
100 pounds of weight it takes a great

88
00:03:55,379 --> 00:04:01,560
deal of energy and cost to get cows up

89
00:03:58,650 --> 00:04:04,650
in that to increase body condition score

90
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:07,319
at calving or right before breeding and

91
00:04:04,650 --> 00:04:09,239
so we really are concerned about body

92
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:12,319
condition score there's a lot of impact

93
00:04:09,239 --> 00:04:17,720
on calf help calf health and calf

94
00:04:12,319 --> 00:04:17,720
productivity along with cow productivity

95
00:04:17,790 --> 00:04:21,870
we tend to forget about bowls when we

96
00:04:20,520 --> 00:04:24,240
manage in the wintertime

97
00:04:21,870 --> 00:04:26,010
and we certainly forget about looking at

98
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:29,190
our body condition scores of bulls so

99
00:04:26,010 --> 00:04:32,040
these are two bowls the bowl on the left

100
00:04:29,190 --> 00:04:34,590
is a body condition score five again

101
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:37,440
just like our cows we cannot see his

102
00:04:34,590 --> 00:04:39,960
last two ribs we cannot see his spine

103
00:04:37,440 --> 00:04:43,110
and that shape between his hooks and his

104
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:46,350
pins is the strong new shape so he's a

105
00:04:43,110 --> 00:04:48,990
body condition score five the ball new

106
00:04:46,350 --> 00:04:51,390
light is a yearling bull this bowl at a

107
00:04:48,990 --> 00:04:54,930
sale time had a back fat of about a

108
00:04:51,390 --> 00:04:57,510
quarter of an inch 2,600 and again as we

109
00:04:54,930 --> 00:05:00,180
look at him you cannot see his last two

110
00:04:57,510 --> 00:05:02,040
ribs his spines not available in this

111
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,020
area between his hooks and misses pins

112
00:05:02,040 --> 00:05:07,820
is very flat and so he's going to be a

113
00:05:04,020 --> 00:05:10,850
body condition score six or greater

114
00:05:07,820 --> 00:05:13,190
so as we move into talking about balls

115
00:05:10,850 --> 00:05:15,980
we have rows around to improve the our

116
00:05:13,190 --> 00:05:17,510
herd but also to breed our cows right

117
00:05:15,980 --> 00:05:19,270
and that's how we get back herd

118
00:05:17,510 --> 00:05:21,590
improvement so let's talk about

119
00:05:19,270 --> 00:05:24,860
spermatogenesis that's the fancy term

120
00:05:21,590 --> 00:05:27,920
for semen development in those that take

121
00:05:24,860 --> 00:05:29,330
61 days or about two months and so

122
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:32,090
anything that has happened in that

123
00:05:29,330 --> 00:05:33,740
period of time will impact semen quality

124
00:05:32,090 --> 00:05:36,560
and the ability to pass a breeding

125
00:05:33,740 --> 00:05:38,990
soundness exam I always encourage people

126
00:05:36,560 --> 00:05:41,450
to think of semen development as a

127
00:05:38,990 --> 00:05:45,020
factory so anything that has happened

128
00:05:41,450 --> 00:05:47,480
along that production in that line over

129
00:05:45,020 --> 00:05:49,670
the past two months will reserve result

130
00:05:47,480 --> 00:05:52,430
in the lemon in the semen production

131
00:05:49,670 --> 00:05:56,410
system we certainly don't want any

132
00:05:52,430 --> 00:05:59,000
women's when it comes time to breed cows

133
00:05:56,410 --> 00:06:01,430
so what's the effect of body condition

134
00:05:59,000 --> 00:06:05,120
score on semen quality and physically

135
00:06:01,430 --> 00:06:07,250
normal Bulls Waldner embark they are out

136
00:06:05,120 --> 00:06:09,470
of the vet school in Saskatoon at the

137
00:06:07,250 --> 00:06:13,000
University of Saskatchewan looked at

138
00:06:09,470 --> 00:06:16,790
body condition scores of bulls it

139
00:06:13,000 --> 00:06:19,070
breeding sound this time exam time in a

140
00:06:16,790 --> 00:06:22,130
time period from January to March which

141
00:06:19,070 --> 00:06:25,220
is the green bars in April to June which

142
00:06:22,130 --> 00:06:27,440
is the yellow bars we would ideally like

143
00:06:25,220 --> 00:06:29,780
to see balls in the body condition score

144
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:32,750
of four or five or six at breeding time

145
00:06:29,780 --> 00:06:35,150
and at turnout time and here's the

146
00:06:32,750 --> 00:06:37,340
reason why you can see that the body

147
00:06:35,150 --> 00:06:39,110
condition when we have those boys in

148
00:06:37,340 --> 00:06:41,060
those body condition scores the

149
00:06:39,110 --> 00:06:43,640
percentage of those Bulls the

150
00:06:41,060 --> 00:06:46,820
satisfactory semen goes up significantly

151
00:06:43,640 --> 00:06:52,340
higher so we range from anywhere being

152
00:06:46,820 --> 00:06:55,460
60% satisfactory to 78% and a January to

153
00:06:52,340 --> 00:06:59,360
March timeframe for semen checking to 80

154
00:06:55,460 --> 00:07:01,660
percent almost 85% in that April's June

155
00:06:59,360 --> 00:07:01,660
time frame

156
00:07:01,879 --> 00:07:06,709
so what happens when we buy yelling

157
00:07:04,189 --> 00:07:09,139
bowls or even two-year-old balls at the

158
00:07:06,709 --> 00:07:10,550
local production sale typically those

159
00:07:09,139 --> 00:07:12,080
bowls are a little heavier and

160
00:07:10,550 --> 00:07:15,679
conditioned because we are trying to

161
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:17,449
optimize production we're trying to

162
00:07:15,679 --> 00:07:19,999
optimize weight gain and marbling in

163
00:07:17,449 --> 00:07:22,009
those bowls and so you can see here on

164
00:07:19,999 --> 00:07:24,889
this screen that this shows a comparison

165
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:27,469
of bulls that were weighed at say a time

166
00:07:24,889 --> 00:07:29,659
and then weighed again when they were

167
00:07:27,469 --> 00:07:31,759
tested and they looked at the percentage

168
00:07:29,659 --> 00:07:34,459
of balls that would pass braiding

169
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:37,610
soundness exam so in a short period of

170
00:07:34,459 --> 00:07:41,599
time after that sale 74% to those bulls

171
00:07:37,610 --> 00:07:44,179
has to semen semen test or breeding

172
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:46,519
soundness exam at that point in time is

173
00:07:44,179 --> 00:07:49,849
those were losing about seven pounds a

174
00:07:46,519 --> 00:07:52,189
day when you get out to about 43 to 85

175
00:07:49,849 --> 00:07:54,139
days after that sale those bills are

176
00:07:52,189 --> 00:07:57,139
losing still about two and a half to

177
00:07:54,139 --> 00:07:59,839
three pounds a day but only half of them

178
00:07:57,139 --> 00:08:01,939
pass the breeding soundness exam so the

179
00:07:59,839 --> 00:08:04,939
take-home messages is that when we buy

180
00:08:01,939 --> 00:08:07,249
these Bulls young bulls a yearling more

181
00:08:04,939 --> 00:08:09,050
two-year-old bowl and take them home we

182
00:08:07,249 --> 00:08:11,479
want to make sure that we are still

183
00:08:09,050 --> 00:08:14,389
maintaining their quality of diet so

184
00:08:11,479 --> 00:08:19,639
that we don't lose a lot of weight body

185
00:08:14,389 --> 00:08:21,709
condition in fact so this year we are

186
00:08:19,639 --> 00:08:23,779
going to see a lot of bowls what you're

187
00:08:21,709 --> 00:08:26,240
likely going to see a lot of bulls with

188
00:08:23,779 --> 00:08:30,009
scrotal frostbite and so what's that

189
00:08:26,240 --> 00:08:32,449
impact on semen quality so in this slide

190
00:08:30,009 --> 00:08:35,029
satisfactory semen quality is in the

191
00:08:32,449 --> 00:08:37,610
green bar questionable semen quality is

192
00:08:35,029 --> 00:08:40,939
in the yellow bar and unsatisfactory

193
00:08:37,610 --> 00:08:43,399
semen quality is in the gray bar I want

194
00:08:40,939 --> 00:08:46,310
you to look at the the boxes with the

195
00:08:43,399 --> 00:08:48,410
red squares around them so they looked

196
00:08:46,310 --> 00:08:51,199
at frostbite and they graded frostbite

197
00:08:48,410 --> 00:08:54,740
by the number of scabs that were a penny

198
00:08:51,199 --> 00:08:56,990
or larger or a penny and smaller severe

199
00:08:54,740 --> 00:08:59,389
frostbite were those scat were those

200
00:08:56,990 --> 00:09:02,810
Bulls that had one or more scabs on

201
00:08:59,389 --> 00:09:04,970
their scrotum that were larger than a

202
00:09:02,810 --> 00:09:07,009
penny slight was one or more that were

203
00:09:04,970 --> 00:09:09,290
smaller so when we look at severe

204
00:09:07,009 --> 00:09:11,899
frostbite in bowls that had breeding

205
00:09:09,290 --> 00:09:15,840
soundness exams for example conducted it

206
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:17,940
from January to March zero men

207
00:09:15,840 --> 00:09:20,220
those bowls had what we would consider

208
00:09:17,940 --> 00:09:24,060
to be a satisfactory breeding soundness

209
00:09:20,220 --> 00:09:26,250
exam somewhere around 30% had what we

210
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:28,800
would consider to be a questionable one

211
00:09:26,250 --> 00:09:31,140
as we move down here to may in June you

212
00:09:28,800 --> 00:09:34,650
can see that the percentage of bulls

213
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:36,470
that have satisfactory breeding

214
00:09:34,650 --> 00:09:40,350
soundness exams or semen quality

215
00:09:36,470 --> 00:09:42,450
increases significantly so the take-home

216
00:09:40,350 --> 00:09:43,830
message is to protect the scrotum and

217
00:09:42,450 --> 00:09:48,630
testicles from the cold

218
00:09:43,830 --> 00:09:50,760
the easiest way most logical way to do

219
00:09:48,630 --> 00:09:53,040
that is with some good wind break and

220
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:54,600
good bedding and so on the picture on

221
00:09:53,040 --> 00:09:56,490
the left you can see that these bulls

222
00:09:54,600 --> 00:09:59,190
are bedded with some nice straw and

223
00:09:56,490 --> 00:10:02,279
there's some really nice natural wind

224
00:09:59,190 --> 00:10:04,770
break through these trees this can also

225
00:10:02,279 --> 00:10:07,290
be a man-made one break how weather that

226
00:10:04,770 --> 00:10:09,420
happens to be stacks of bales or some of

227
00:10:07,290 --> 00:10:11,550
these portable wind breaks as you can

228
00:10:09,420 --> 00:10:14,070
see in Canada maybe they protect the

229
00:10:11,550 --> 00:10:16,529
scrotum and testicles of boughs a little

230
00:10:14,070 --> 00:10:19,020
bit different they utilized a Crown

231
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:21,300
Royal sac we know that that is maybe not

232
00:10:19,020 --> 00:10:22,970
appropriate here and the easiest thing

233
00:10:21,300 --> 00:10:26,130
to do

234
00:10:22,970 --> 00:10:29,940
so in summary both should be in the body

235
00:10:26,130 --> 00:10:31,920
condition score of 4 to 7 a pre breeding

236
00:10:29,940 --> 00:10:33,720
to command it turn out we want those

237
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,550
boys to maintain condition through the

238
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:38,640
breeding season but we don't want them

239
00:10:35,550 --> 00:10:40,560
to be too fast maintain young recently

240
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,839
purchased Bulls on a similar plane of

241
00:10:40,560 --> 00:10:44,310
nutrition and diet as they were when

242
00:10:42,839 --> 00:10:47,490
they were purchased and then slowly

243
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,589
stepped them down if you have not done

244
00:10:47,490 --> 00:10:52,589
so check out the body condition scores

245
00:10:49,589 --> 00:10:54,870
of your herd sires now ask someone who's

246
00:10:52,589 --> 00:10:56,550
knowledgeable about cattle to check out

247
00:10:54,870 --> 00:11:00,330
the body condition score of your herd

248
00:10:56,550 --> 00:11:03,530
after bulls and cows to don't confuse

249
00:11:00,330 --> 00:11:06,600
hair muscle and/or hey belly with a

250
00:11:03,530 --> 00:11:09,089
condition and get help developing a

251
00:11:06,600 --> 00:11:10,560
ration if you need to add some condition

252
00:11:09,089 --> 00:11:12,089
this is really important in bills

253
00:11:10,560 --> 00:11:14,160
because we don't want to get them too

254
00:11:12,089 --> 00:11:15,690
fat and we don't want to step them up on

255
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:17,880
too hot of a diet

256
00:11:15,690 --> 00:11:21,180
most of our County Extension offices

257
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:24,440
have software and rash and development

258
00:11:21,180 --> 00:11:27,080
ability if you need some help

259
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,330
next we talked about this betting bills

260
00:11:27,080 --> 00:11:32,080
and in fact betting cattle is really

261
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:34,400
important provide some windbreak

262
00:11:32,080 --> 00:11:35,870
breeding soundness exams really

263
00:11:34,400 --> 00:11:38,570
important we need to have our bills

264
00:11:35,870 --> 00:11:41,030
tested within a month of breeding season

265
00:11:38,570 --> 00:11:44,180
that gives us enough time to find those

266
00:11:41,030 --> 00:11:46,750
if our bows happen to not test well but

267
00:11:44,180 --> 00:11:49,430
it also is an appropriate amount of time

268
00:11:46,750 --> 00:11:53,990
for them to have that breeding soundness

269
00:11:49,430 --> 00:11:56,450
exam be accurate when you turn them out

270
00:11:53,990 --> 00:11:58,730
don't save pennies to waste dollars by

271
00:11:56,450 --> 00:12:02,240
skipping a breeding soundness again exam

272
00:11:58,730 --> 00:12:04,760
most veterinarians charge 50 to $100 for

273
00:12:02,240 --> 00:12:06,380
breeding soundness exam and while that

274
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:09,440
seems like a lot of money think about

275
00:12:06,380 --> 00:12:12,440
this if your cows breed just 21 days

276
00:12:09,440 --> 00:12:14,450
later because you're both failed a

277
00:12:12,440 --> 00:12:16,970
breeding soundness exam that ends up

278
00:12:14,450 --> 00:12:19,730
being some around 50 pounds of weaning

279
00:12:16,970 --> 00:12:22,940
weight if calves sell for a dollar and a

280
00:12:19,730 --> 00:12:25,250
half a pound that is $75 per head that

281
00:12:22,940 --> 00:12:26,840
you have lost you could have paid for

282
00:12:25,250 --> 00:12:29,450
that breeding soundness exam with just

283
00:12:26,840 --> 00:12:31,250
one calf remember that that semen test

284
00:12:29,450 --> 00:12:34,100
is only good for the day it was taken

285
00:12:31,250 --> 00:12:36,830
and that semen development takes 60 days

286
00:12:34,100 --> 00:12:38,750
and so with that thank you I wish you

287
00:12:36,830 --> 00:12:41,660
the best of luck and as we move into

288
00:12:38,750 --> 00:12:44,450
spring and next dr. Jerry stuck is going

289
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:46,370
to talk about managing calves that have

290
00:12:44,450 --> 00:12:51,320
been chilled and pulled stress and

291
00:12:46,370 --> 00:12:54,020
calves idea Lisa good to be with you

292
00:12:51,320 --> 00:12:57,050
this evening I know that this is really

293
00:12:54,020 --> 00:12:58,730
not a topic that it's all I'm enjoyable

294
00:12:57,050 --> 00:13:00,710
to talk about we're gonna talk about it

295
00:12:58,730 --> 00:13:03,200
anyway we've still got winter left and a

296
00:13:00,710 --> 00:13:04,940
storm coming and I hope none of you have

297
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,190
to deal with cold stress calves but

298
00:13:04,940 --> 00:13:09,080
we're gonna focus in for the next few

299
00:13:07,190 --> 00:13:10,850
minutes on talking about how we handle

300
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:13,450
and how we deal with it and how we

301
00:13:10,850 --> 00:13:13,450
recognize

302
00:13:17,059 --> 00:13:21,389
well these are the three things we're

303
00:13:19,169 --> 00:13:23,309
gonna discuss we're gonna talk about how

304
00:13:21,389 --> 00:13:26,160
to recognize a calf and maybe in trouble

305
00:13:23,309 --> 00:13:27,779
and I'm sure that's nothing new for

306
00:13:26,160 --> 00:13:29,220
those of you in the audience you know

307
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:31,709
how to tell when calves aren't doing

308
00:13:29,220 --> 00:13:33,479
well or doing right we're going to talk

309
00:13:31,709 --> 00:13:35,069
about them in for intervention and then

310
00:13:33,479 --> 00:13:39,839
maybe some things about what the

311
00:13:35,069 --> 00:13:41,699
outcomes might be you know I noticed

312
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:44,160
some things that all of us are gonna

313
00:13:41,699 --> 00:13:47,369
talk about betting and wind protection

314
00:13:44,160 --> 00:13:50,160
come into play here and and yet the snow

315
00:13:47,369 --> 00:13:51,899
months are talking about it does cause

316
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,600
us some issues it's supposed to be wet

317
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:56,489
snow and whenever we have those kind of

318
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:57,959
conditions the problem with moisture is

319
00:13:56,489 --> 00:14:00,869
that it decreases the level of

320
00:13:57,959 --> 00:14:03,779
insulation on an animal it's not just

321
00:14:00,869 --> 00:14:06,959
the cows but it's those calves and those

322
00:14:03,779 --> 00:14:09,269
those calves with not a lot of body

323
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:11,819
weight not a and a lot of surface area

324
00:14:09,269 --> 00:14:13,529
they tend to suffer the most when it

325
00:14:11,819 --> 00:14:16,679
gets to be these tough conditions so you

326
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:18,419
need to be doing what you can be out

327
00:14:16,679 --> 00:14:20,789
there as often as you can during this

328
00:14:18,419 --> 00:14:22,410
tough weather I know you're gonna

329
00:14:20,789 --> 00:14:25,589
probably lose some sleep over the next

330
00:14:22,410 --> 00:14:27,959
few days but being out there probably

331
00:14:25,589 --> 00:14:29,819
saves you some calves and so think about

332
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:33,629
what your schedule is and if you can get

333
00:14:29,819 --> 00:14:36,389
somebody to check calves for you during

334
00:14:33,629 --> 00:14:38,369
the night time or even even the day

335
00:14:36,389 --> 00:14:43,109
times you can get some sleep sure helps

336
00:14:38,369 --> 00:14:44,970
barns through help and just a reminder

337
00:14:43,109 --> 00:14:49,160
to keep them as clean as possible and

338
00:14:44,970 --> 00:14:49,160
fresh bedding at this time of the year

339
00:14:50,050 --> 00:14:55,060
um I just want to talk a little bit

340
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:58,899
about behavior of animals that are under

341
00:14:55,060 --> 00:15:00,910
some stress and and cold stress and and

342
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:04,149
remember that cold stress can happen in

343
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:06,519
a lot of different outside temperatures

344
00:15:04,149 --> 00:15:08,320
I mean the critical temperature for

345
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:11,019
calves is probably somewhere around 55

346
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:12,490
degrees so and all that means that is

347
00:15:11,019 --> 00:15:14,470
when the temperature goes below that

348
00:15:12,490 --> 00:15:16,060
they have to take in more energy to

349
00:15:14,470 --> 00:15:19,390
maintain that body heat

350
00:15:16,060 --> 00:15:21,670
we'd like 55 degrees now but calves can

351
00:15:19,390 --> 00:15:23,410
handle it if they if they're able to get

352
00:15:21,670 --> 00:15:25,570
up and nurse and the mother takes care

353
00:15:23,410 --> 00:15:28,000
of them but the behavior that you need

354
00:15:25,570 --> 00:15:30,519
to be aware of that they'll exhibit when

355
00:15:28,000 --> 00:15:32,589
they're in cold stress is maybe standing

356
00:15:30,519 --> 00:15:34,390
off by themselves and hunched up and and

357
00:15:32,589 --> 00:15:36,550
of course you'll see that when there

358
00:15:34,390 --> 00:15:38,740
can't get out of the wind but they also

359
00:15:36,550 --> 00:15:41,800
can be just laying down even next to the

360
00:15:38,740 --> 00:15:43,540
mother and you won't notice it and you

361
00:15:41,800 --> 00:15:45,760
need to determine whether that calf is

362
00:15:43,540 --> 00:15:47,980
nursed or not and sometimes I'll admit

363
00:15:45,760 --> 00:15:50,769
it's hard to it's hard to determine that

364
00:15:47,980 --> 00:15:52,660
but look at the otter do the teats look

365
00:15:50,769 --> 00:15:54,399
dry and when it's moisture outside they

366
00:15:52,660 --> 00:15:56,260
probably won't look dry they'll look wet

367
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,630
but is the hair on the utter dry or the

368
00:15:56,260 --> 00:16:01,060
other quarters full a lot of things to

369
00:15:58,630 --> 00:16:04,180
look for but if you're still wondering

370
00:16:01,060 --> 00:16:06,940
you need to put your fingers and clean

371
00:16:04,180 --> 00:16:08,829
fingers preferably in the mouth and see

372
00:16:06,940 --> 00:16:10,540
if that mouth is cold if that mouth is

373
00:16:08,829 --> 00:16:13,149
cold they have not nursed and you're

374
00:16:10,540 --> 00:16:15,160
gonna have to intervene and and even

375
00:16:13,149 --> 00:16:18,100
beyond that when you get a calf that's

376
00:16:15,160 --> 00:16:21,640
cold and vocalising that is a really bad

377
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:25,750
clinical sign I sometimes use the term

378
00:16:21,640 --> 00:16:28,690
five percent chance of survival so the

379
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:32,529
prognosis in a calf that's vocalizing is

380
00:16:28,690 --> 00:16:34,899
really really poor we define hypothermia

381
00:16:32,529 --> 00:16:37,240
and calves as anything below 98 degree

382
00:16:34,899 --> 00:16:39,100
Fahrenheit rectal temperature you know

383
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:43,360
newborn calves should be somewhere in

384
00:16:39,100 --> 00:16:45,970
that 90 902 we can actually have severe

385
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:48,040
hypothermia down to 86 degrees those

386
00:16:45,970 --> 00:16:50,260
calves will definitely need to be

387
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:51,820
intervened I don't I don't I'm not

388
00:16:50,260 --> 00:16:53,560
telling you need to run around with a

389
00:16:51,820 --> 00:16:55,720
rectal thermometer I'm telling you that

390
00:16:53,560 --> 00:16:58,510
you can probably identify those calves

391
00:16:55,720 --> 00:17:00,339
that need help just by their behavior if

392
00:16:58,510 --> 00:17:02,079
you have one that's fine but it's not

393
00:17:00,339 --> 00:17:05,230
something you need to need to have to

394
00:17:02,079 --> 00:17:07,510
identify calf that needs help

395
00:17:05,230 --> 00:17:09,669
this is just a reminder that better days

396
00:17:07,510 --> 00:17:12,549
are ahead we will get through this March

397
00:17:09,669 --> 00:17:15,459
and we will have green grass and some of

398
00:17:12,549 --> 00:17:17,169
you will have calves on green grass just

399
00:17:15,459 --> 00:17:20,529
remember this doesn't these next two

400
00:17:17,169 --> 00:17:22,929
days don't last forever just want to

401
00:17:20,529 --> 00:17:25,439
make a couple of comments about this in

402
00:17:22,929 --> 00:17:28,029
order for a calf to maintain its

403
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:31,299
maintain its core temperature and

404
00:17:28,029 --> 00:17:33,220
maintain its life when it's cold out he

405
00:17:31,299 --> 00:17:34,929
has to increase metabolic activity and

406
00:17:33,220 --> 00:17:36,580
of course that happens when that calf

407
00:17:34,929 --> 00:17:39,159
leaves the uterine environment that's

408
00:17:36,580 --> 00:17:40,960
nice and warm and and safe and all the

409
00:17:39,159 --> 00:17:44,080
shop know all the sudden he shoved out

410
00:17:40,960 --> 00:17:47,200
into the the cold environment and so his

411
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,169
metabolic activity has to really jump

412
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:51,940
ahead and get on board there so

413
00:17:50,169 --> 00:17:54,309
mentioned that the metabolic activity

414
00:17:51,940 --> 00:17:56,799
will increase 5x over the resting phase

415
00:17:54,309 --> 00:17:58,570
and I mean what calves end up doing is

416
00:17:56,799 --> 00:18:02,320
they end up shivering and that helps

417
00:17:58,570 --> 00:18:04,690
them to to generate heat and I've got a

418
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:08,110
comment in here below sharing its talks

419
00:18:04,690 --> 00:18:10,659
about calving difficulty when a calf is

420
00:18:08,110 --> 00:18:13,299
having trouble being born or the mothers

421
00:18:10,659 --> 00:18:15,760
having trouble delivering that calf that

422
00:18:13,299 --> 00:18:18,490
actually is a detriment to that calves

423
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:21,760
ability to withstand cold temperatures

424
00:18:18,490 --> 00:18:24,639
because it messes with the metabolic

425
00:18:21,760 --> 00:18:26,409
activity even a calf that's born

426
00:18:24,639 --> 00:18:28,480
unassisted is going to have increased

427
00:18:26,409 --> 00:18:30,220
cortisol and just a little bit of

428
00:18:28,480 --> 00:18:32,710
cortisol allows that calf to better

429
00:18:30,220 --> 00:18:35,080
utilize fat we're going to talk about

430
00:18:32,710 --> 00:18:36,940
brown fat in just a little bit but also

431
00:18:35,080 --> 00:18:39,909
the sugar stores the glycogen and

432
00:18:36,940 --> 00:18:41,769
protein to create heat and what happens

433
00:18:39,909 --> 00:18:43,990
in cold temperatures in addition to

434
00:18:41,769 --> 00:18:45,730
increased metabolic activity when it's

435
00:18:43,990 --> 00:18:47,860
cold out there's vasoconstriction in

436
00:18:45,730 --> 00:18:51,070
other words the vessels will constrict

437
00:18:47,860 --> 00:18:52,840
and you don't have that that blood flow

438
00:18:51,070 --> 00:18:55,019
to the ears and feet and tail and that's

439
00:18:52,840 --> 00:18:57,960
why when it gets really cold and you see

440
00:18:55,019 --> 00:19:00,429
problems a result that's that's the

441
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:04,899
pieces of the anatomy that that get

442
00:19:00,429 --> 00:19:07,299
affected the most just a little comment

443
00:19:04,899 --> 00:19:09,100
on calving is just to back up what I

444
00:19:07,299 --> 00:19:11,980
just mentioned about calving knees and

445
00:19:09,100 --> 00:19:14,799
calves ability to withstand cold and get

446
00:19:11,980 --> 00:19:16,659
up and nurse I'm answering something

447
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:18,400
about brown fat and we don't often think

448
00:19:16,659 --> 00:19:19,990
about that you think

449
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:22,180
in terms of white fat while calves are

450
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,460
born with brown fat and and they have

451
00:19:22,180 --> 00:19:26,560
the unique ability and it's gone after

452
00:19:24,460 --> 00:19:28,390
just a short period of time but they

453
00:19:26,560 --> 00:19:31,720
have an unique ability to use that fat

454
00:19:28,390 --> 00:19:34,210
to keep warm and and calves that are

455
00:19:31,720 --> 00:19:35,740
born to cows an adequate body condition

456
00:19:34,210 --> 00:19:37,690
score back to what Lisa was talking

457
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:39,580
about those calves will have a little

458
00:19:37,690 --> 00:19:41,110
better supply of brown fat that gets

459
00:19:39,580 --> 00:19:44,230
them through the tough times and gets

460
00:19:41,110 --> 00:19:47,260
them to get up and start nursing so it's

461
00:19:44,230 --> 00:19:49,000
a big deal having cows and in adequate

462
00:19:47,260 --> 00:19:52,750
body condition score especially cold

463
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:54,640
temperatures it's really important just

464
00:19:52,750 --> 00:19:58,060
a couple comments about colostrum we'll

465
00:19:54,640 --> 00:20:00,310
come back to this again in just a bit if

466
00:19:58,060 --> 00:20:03,340
you think about a calf in thermo neutral

467
00:20:00,310 --> 00:20:06,160
zone thermo neutral zone and I mentioned

468
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:07,750
this earlier but the mono thermo neutral

469
00:20:06,160 --> 00:20:10,090
zone for calf's probably somewhere in

470
00:20:07,750 --> 00:20:13,660
that 50 to 55 degree fahrenheit range

471
00:20:10,090 --> 00:20:16,600
they need in order to maintain their

472
00:20:13,660 --> 00:20:18,160
their heat source they need almost two

473
00:20:16,600 --> 00:20:20,350
thirds of a gallon of colostrum milk

474
00:20:18,160 --> 00:20:22,780
colostrum will different for cod a cow

475
00:20:20,350 --> 00:20:25,060
and from from breed to breed and dairy

476
00:20:22,780 --> 00:20:27,250
breeds and beef breeze but just there

477
00:20:25,060 --> 00:20:29,470
kind of an idea of what those calves at

478
00:20:27,250 --> 00:20:31,300
calves actually need and when that

479
00:20:29,470 --> 00:20:33,550
temperature falls below that thermo

480
00:20:31,300 --> 00:20:35,230
neutral zone then they actually need a

481
00:20:33,550 --> 00:20:39,340
little bit more just to maintain their

482
00:20:35,230 --> 00:20:42,040
their energy that they need for internal

483
00:20:39,340 --> 00:20:44,320
body heat and remember that our beef

484
00:20:42,040 --> 00:20:45,940
cattle do an amazing job of acclimating

485
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:49,330
to the cold when I talk about thermal

486
00:20:45,940 --> 00:20:52,300
neutral zone I mean our cattle grow

487
00:20:49,330 --> 00:20:54,130
longer hair they do lots of things to

488
00:20:52,300 --> 00:20:55,810
acclimate to the cold if they didn't we

489
00:20:54,130 --> 00:20:58,480
wouldn't be able to raise cattle out pop

490
00:20:55,810 --> 00:21:00,250
doors I mean even in temperatures way

491
00:20:58,480 --> 00:21:01,360
below zero if the sun is shining and

492
00:21:00,250 --> 00:21:03,700
there's no win and they're laying

493
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:09,000
embedding those calves actually do

494
00:21:03,700 --> 00:21:12,730
extremely well frostbite is one of the

495
00:21:09,000 --> 00:21:14,140
one of the side effects of this cold

496
00:21:12,730 --> 00:21:16,780
stress that you can have it can have

497
00:21:14,140 --> 00:21:18,730
frostbite rot on the skin but a lot of

498
00:21:16,780 --> 00:21:21,370
times what we see happen first is that

499
00:21:18,730 --> 00:21:22,900
the tips of the years will freeze and

500
00:21:21,370 --> 00:21:25,570
then they old necrosis and then they'll

501
00:21:22,900 --> 00:21:27,520
fall off and that's okay those calves

502
00:21:25,570 --> 00:21:29,890
will be okay if it's just the tips of

503
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:32,320
the years the one that becomes really

504
00:21:29,890 --> 00:21:34,090
dangerous is when their feet freeze and

505
00:21:32,320 --> 00:21:37,090
you'll notice you can notice this early

506
00:21:34,090 --> 00:21:39,549
on perhaps when when you feel the feet

507
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:41,110
and they're just frozen solid and if you

508
00:21:39,549 --> 00:21:42,610
don't notice that then those calves will

509
00:21:41,110 --> 00:21:45,460
actually get up and move around and be

510
00:21:42,610 --> 00:21:48,100
fine but after a day or so maybe about

511
00:21:45,460 --> 00:21:49,299
48 hours those feet become swollen they

512
00:21:48,100 --> 00:21:52,269
actually get a little what I call

513
00:21:49,299 --> 00:21:54,490
squishy because there's edema fluid in

514
00:21:52,269 --> 00:21:56,919
the tissues and and they're painful and

515
00:21:54,490 --> 00:21:58,600
you can wait a while to see if somehow

516
00:21:56,919 --> 00:22:01,120
there's a miracle that occurs and they

517
00:21:58,600 --> 00:22:02,380
improve but they're most of the time

518
00:22:01,120 --> 00:22:05,529
they're not going to be treatable at

519
00:22:02,380 --> 00:22:09,029
those at that stage and those calves

520
00:22:05,529 --> 00:22:11,980
will likely have to be put down

521
00:22:09,029 --> 00:22:13,809
so how do we heat those calves up lots

522
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:16,720
of different ways lots of different

523
00:22:13,809 --> 00:22:19,960
methods you know heaters floor heats and

524
00:22:16,720 --> 00:22:21,580
blankets and hot boxes and I just want

525
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,340
you to think about this though because

526
00:22:21,580 --> 00:22:26,559
when a calf is really hypothermic you

527
00:22:24,340 --> 00:22:29,440
know I mentioned that 86 degree rectal

528
00:22:26,559 --> 00:22:31,269
temperatures is extreme hypothermia it's

529
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:33,669
going to be hard to conduct enough heat

530
00:22:31,269 --> 00:22:36,639
through the hide to raise that internal

531
00:22:33,669 --> 00:22:38,440
body temperature so and in order to do

532
00:22:36,639 --> 00:22:40,779
that really the calf has to also have

533
00:22:38,440 --> 00:22:42,519
the ability to produce heat and that's

534
00:22:40,779 --> 00:22:45,730
why in both of these instances those

535
00:22:42,519 --> 00:22:47,470
calves need colostrum I know you're in a

536
00:22:45,730 --> 00:22:49,000
hurry to get that calf formed up but

537
00:22:47,470 --> 00:22:50,649
some time during that period when you're

538
00:22:49,000 --> 00:22:53,350
warm and you you got to provide

539
00:22:50,649 --> 00:22:56,139
colostrum because that allows calf that

540
00:22:53,350 --> 00:22:59,259
calf to get some energy that it really

541
00:22:56,139 --> 00:23:02,169
needs warm water is tends to be very

542
00:22:59,259 --> 00:23:03,460
efficient at warming calves and some of

543
00:23:02,169 --> 00:23:05,320
you may have bathtubs available

544
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,450
sometimes you need to carry them right

545
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:09,580
in the house and put them in the bathtub

546
00:23:07,450 --> 00:23:11,759
100 degrees fahrenheit water and I'd be

547
00:23:09,580 --> 00:23:14,320
like I'll just caution you a little bit

548
00:23:11,759 --> 00:23:16,750
sometimes it's okay to warm those calves

549
00:23:14,320 --> 00:23:19,379
up a little bit with dry heat first so

550
00:23:16,750 --> 00:23:22,899
that it's not so much of a shock so

551
00:23:19,379 --> 00:23:25,299
robbing and putting external heat on is

552
00:23:22,899 --> 00:23:27,429
okay so you can start to raise some of

553
00:23:25,299 --> 00:23:28,929
that temperature but the bathtub still

554
00:23:27,429 --> 00:23:31,149
may be needed in those calves that are

555
00:23:28,929 --> 00:23:34,090
extremely help affirming and also they

556
00:23:31,149 --> 00:23:36,100
need colostrum yes this is my famous

557
00:23:34,090 --> 00:23:38,950
picture of a calf in the bathtub and

558
00:23:36,100 --> 00:23:40,370
that one actually did survive believe it

559
00:23:38,950 --> 00:23:43,250
or not

560
00:23:40,370 --> 00:23:46,760
um just a couple comments again on

561
00:23:43,250 --> 00:23:49,490
colostrum itself fresh is the best some

562
00:23:46,760 --> 00:23:51,290
is better than none and sometimes you

563
00:23:49,490 --> 00:23:53,000
need to put that beef cow that doesn't

564
00:23:51,290 --> 00:23:55,309
know that you're trying to help her in

565
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:58,700
the calf got to put up in ahead catch

566
00:23:55,309 --> 00:24:00,110
and this is where you need some help you

567
00:23:58,700 --> 00:24:01,490
need somebody to grab the tail any of

568
00:24:00,110 --> 00:24:03,800
the bass and move it to a vertical

569
00:24:01,490 --> 00:24:06,020
position so she won't kick so much and

570
00:24:03,800 --> 00:24:07,760
put your head in that flank and milk the

571
00:24:06,020 --> 00:24:10,130
nearest heat and then once they kind of

572
00:24:07,760 --> 00:24:13,309
calm down you can kind of release some

573
00:24:10,130 --> 00:24:17,059
pressure but that fresh colostrum is the

574
00:24:13,309 --> 00:24:19,880
best energy source immune source that

575
00:24:17,059 --> 00:24:22,190
those calves need frozen classrooms fine

576
00:24:19,880 --> 00:24:24,890
I prefer if you harvest it from your own

577
00:24:22,190 --> 00:24:26,510
herd I'm a little leery of taking frozen

578
00:24:24,890 --> 00:24:27,200
claws from from other herds and from

579
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:29,540
dairy herds

580
00:24:27,200 --> 00:24:30,170
there are colostrum substitutes on the

581
00:24:29,540 --> 00:24:32,570
market today

582
00:24:30,170 --> 00:24:34,210
and look at the label make sure they got

583
00:24:32,570 --> 00:24:36,410
a minimum of hundred grams of

584
00:24:34,210 --> 00:24:38,929
immunoglobulins that those calves need I

585
00:24:36,410 --> 00:24:41,559
know always get questions about brandy

586
00:24:38,929 --> 00:24:43,700
and whisky and 5-hour energy drinks

587
00:24:41,559 --> 00:24:45,950
brandy and whisky I'm pretty sure are

588
00:24:43,700 --> 00:24:47,600
designed for human consumption I'm not

589
00:24:45,950 --> 00:24:49,730
sure about five hours I don't know of

590
00:24:47,600 --> 00:24:52,100
any studies done on them so stick with

591
00:24:49,730 --> 00:24:54,070
the things you know colostrum is the

592
00:24:52,100 --> 00:24:56,170
best

593
00:24:54,070 --> 00:24:58,540
I'm going to pass this over at this time

594
00:24:56,170 --> 00:25:01,810
to Janna block our extension livestock

595
00:24:58,540 --> 00:25:04,290
specialist out in heading her Janna you

596
00:25:01,810 --> 00:25:04,290
take it away

597
00:25:04,420 --> 00:25:14,830
all right thanks Jerry okay so I'm gonna

598
00:25:12,940 --> 00:25:17,020
be visiting with you a little bit about

599
00:25:14,830 --> 00:25:20,470
how to evaluate your nutrition program

600
00:25:17,020 --> 00:25:23,050
and I know it's been a long haul for

601
00:25:20,470 --> 00:25:25,210
many of us and still looking like we're

602
00:25:23,050 --> 00:25:26,890
facing a little bit of winter so it's

603
00:25:25,210 --> 00:25:28,420
important to be really critical and

604
00:25:26,890 --> 00:25:30,130
evaluate what's going on with your

605
00:25:28,420 --> 00:25:31,450
nutrition programs as we try to finish

606
00:25:30,130 --> 00:25:35,020
out the rest of this winter and head

607
00:25:31,450 --> 00:25:37,090
into spring so things that we need to

608
00:25:35,020 --> 00:25:39,070
consider our obviously quality and

609
00:25:37,090 --> 00:25:41,170
quantity of our base diet most the time

610
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:43,420
that's going to consist of forage so

611
00:25:41,170 --> 00:25:44,710
don't be like the guy on this cartoon

612
00:25:43,420 --> 00:25:47,320
here and let the whitetail show you

613
00:25:44,710 --> 00:25:49,150
which are the best bales get your hay

614
00:25:47,320 --> 00:25:52,810
inventory conducted and I'll talk about

615
00:25:49,150 --> 00:25:54,640
an example of that shortly and also make

616
00:25:52,810 --> 00:25:56,290
sure you get nutrient analysis conducted

617
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:57,390
so that you know exactly what you're

618
00:25:56,290 --> 00:25:59,170
dealing with

619
00:25:57,390 --> 00:26:00,550
obviously you have to know what

620
00:25:59,170 --> 00:26:02,770
different types of production groups

621
00:26:00,550 --> 00:26:04,750
that you have to take care of if you've

622
00:26:02,770 --> 00:26:07,960
got some first-half heifers some old

623
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:09,280
thin cows mature cows or bulls those are

624
00:26:07,960 --> 00:26:10,330
all going to have different requirements

625
00:26:09,280 --> 00:26:12,370
and you're going to need to feed them

626
00:26:10,330 --> 00:26:15,730
strategically based on your feed

627
00:26:12,370 --> 00:26:17,980
resources most of you are calving now or

628
00:26:15,730 --> 00:26:20,290
you have been for some time and so

629
00:26:17,980 --> 00:26:22,330
that's going to impact requirements in

630
00:26:20,290 --> 00:26:24,400
terms of when your cows gets peak

631
00:26:22,330 --> 00:26:27,480
lactation which is approximately 60 days

632
00:26:24,400 --> 00:26:30,070
after calving that's also going to

633
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:31,900
really kind of match up with our pasture

634
00:26:30,070 --> 00:26:33,600
turnout dates in terms of when we have

635
00:26:31,900 --> 00:26:36,820
to feed that high quality forage win

636
00:26:33,600 --> 00:26:38,770
requirements out there at highest what's

637
00:26:36,820 --> 00:26:40,390
the condition of our cow herd evaluate

638
00:26:38,770 --> 00:26:41,980
body condition score and I'll talk about

639
00:26:40,390 --> 00:26:44,710
a couple of other strategies to kind of

640
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:46,120
monitor nutrient status and then of

641
00:26:44,710 --> 00:26:47,830
course your considerations are going to

642
00:26:46,120 --> 00:26:49,600
always come back to the bottom line what

643
00:26:47,830 --> 00:26:50,890
kind of costs are you looking at what

644
00:26:49,600 --> 00:26:52,780
facilities and labor do you have

645
00:26:50,890 --> 00:26:54,940
available and you might need to consider

646
00:26:52,780 --> 00:27:07,420
some alternatives rather than just a

647
00:26:54,940 --> 00:27:09,220
full feed hay diet okay so this chart

648
00:27:07,420 --> 00:27:11,500
gives you just some rule of thumb for

649
00:27:09,220 --> 00:27:13,930
estimating can take based on energy

650
00:27:11,500 --> 00:27:17,560
content or a TD n total digestible

651
00:27:13,930 --> 00:27:18,200
nutrients so as you can see here the low

652
00:27:17,560 --> 00:27:19,640
quality

653
00:27:18,200 --> 00:27:21,410
Raja's will have the least amount of

654
00:27:19,640 --> 00:27:23,450
intake that's just due to bulk or

655
00:27:21,410 --> 00:27:26,360
physical fill due to fiber content and

656
00:27:23,450 --> 00:27:28,700
so our dry cows are going to be able to

657
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:30,670
eat around one at 1.8 percent of their

658
00:27:28,700 --> 00:27:33,770
body weight of that low quality forage

659
00:27:30,670 --> 00:27:35,930
lactating cows will increase the intake

660
00:27:33,770 --> 00:27:38,000
of that and again intake will just

661
00:27:35,930 --> 00:27:41,510
continue to increase as forage quality

662
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:44,360
increases and I have just an example of

663
00:27:41,510 --> 00:27:46,850
down here on the bottom of comparing an

664
00:27:44,360 --> 00:27:50,240
intake of a low quality forage @ 30.8

665
00:27:46,850 --> 00:27:52,280
pounds to a high quality forage at 37.8

666
00:27:50,240 --> 00:27:54,560
pounds so again that's where

667
00:27:52,280 --> 00:27:56,720
understanding the quality of your forage

668
00:27:54,560 --> 00:27:58,670
is helpful and this can be used when

669
00:27:56,720 --> 00:28:01,070
you're looking at your hay inventory and

670
00:27:58,670 --> 00:28:03,350
trying to figure out what the intake

671
00:28:01,070 --> 00:28:05,770
should be on various forages based on

672
00:28:03,350 --> 00:28:05,770
quality

673
00:28:08,240 --> 00:28:13,019
so Jimmy kind of mentioned the lower

674
00:28:10,860 --> 00:28:15,059
critical temperature so in beef cattle

675
00:28:13,019 --> 00:28:17,490
that's just the temperature below which

676
00:28:15,059 --> 00:28:20,220
they have to utilize energy to maintain

677
00:28:17,490 --> 00:28:21,960
body heat and so in mature cattle we're

678
00:28:20,220 --> 00:28:23,909
talking about 32 degrees with a dry

679
00:28:21,960 --> 00:28:25,889
winter coat or 18 degrees with a heavy

680
00:28:23,909 --> 00:28:28,080
dry winter coat and so as the

681
00:28:25,889 --> 00:28:29,789
temperature starts to decline you can

682
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:32,250
see that feed intake will increase

683
00:28:29,789 --> 00:28:38,909
energy for production is lost and the

684
00:28:32,250 --> 00:28:40,830
maintenance requirement increases so we

685
00:28:38,909 --> 00:28:43,350
can utilize the ambient temperature and

686
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:45,990
wind speed to calculate an effective

687
00:28:43,350 --> 00:28:47,429
temperature and we use this effective

688
00:28:45,990 --> 00:28:49,289
temperature to determine how much

689
00:28:47,429 --> 00:28:51,570
additional energy those cattle are going

690
00:28:49,289 --> 00:28:53,340
to require just to maintain body heat so

691
00:28:51,570 --> 00:28:56,070
again a basic rule of thumb is to

692
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,960
increase T DT DN or energy by one

693
00:28:56,070 --> 00:29:00,600
percent for every degree below the lower

694
00:28:57,960 --> 00:29:02,129
critical temperature so if we have the

695
00:29:00,600 --> 00:29:04,740
dry heavy winter coat that I talked

696
00:29:02,129 --> 00:29:07,320
about in the previous slide our lower

697
00:29:04,740 --> 00:29:09,509
critical temperature is 18 degrees so if

698
00:29:07,320 --> 00:29:11,549
we have air temperature of zero in a

699
00:29:09,509 --> 00:29:14,490
wind speed of 20 we're looking at an

700
00:29:11,549 --> 00:29:15,559
effective temperature of minus 39 so we

701
00:29:14,490 --> 00:29:19,049
take our lower critical temperature

702
00:29:15,559 --> 00:29:22,919
minus our -39 and with those cows are

703
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:24,179
going to require 57% more energy so just

704
00:29:22,919 --> 00:29:25,620
going through some nutrition

705
00:29:24,179 --> 00:29:27,929
calculations here and I know I'm

706
00:29:25,620 --> 00:29:29,549
throwing a lot of numbers at you I can

707
00:29:27,929 --> 00:29:31,590
definitely get you copies of this slide

708
00:29:29,549 --> 00:29:34,830
or you can print it from the webinar

709
00:29:31,590 --> 00:29:36,360
later just showing you the relative

710
00:29:34,830 --> 00:29:38,309
difference in how much energy is going

711
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:40,860
to be required by that cow just based on

712
00:29:38,309 --> 00:29:44,070
that wind speed and temperature and so

713
00:29:40,860 --> 00:29:45,269
if we were able to feed that cow then

714
00:29:44,070 --> 00:29:46,950
not afford to that she's going to need

715
00:29:45,269 --> 00:29:49,590
to meet her energy requirements she'd be

716
00:29:46,950 --> 00:29:51,269
eating 3.6 percent of body weight that

717
00:29:49,590 --> 00:29:53,519
might be possible in some feed black

718
00:29:51,269 --> 00:29:55,590
diets that's still on the high side and

719
00:29:53,519 --> 00:29:57,269
probably not possible with our forage

720
00:29:55,590 --> 00:29:58,860
based diets so we have to find some

721
00:29:57,269 --> 00:30:00,960
other ways to reduce maintenance

722
00:29:58,860 --> 00:30:08,100
requirements and the amount of feed that

723
00:30:00,960 --> 00:30:11,009
those cows are going to require so just

724
00:30:08,100 --> 00:30:12,480
a couple ways that you can do that many

725
00:30:11,009 --> 00:30:14,460
of you are probably already doing some

726
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:16,529
of these things need to think about

727
00:30:14,460 --> 00:30:18,960
providing some higher quality forages or

728
00:30:16,529 --> 00:30:21,120
grain or by-product feeds just more

729
00:30:18,960 --> 00:30:23,130
energy-dense feeds

730
00:30:21,120 --> 00:30:26,550
again forage will generate the most

731
00:30:23,130 --> 00:30:28,860
amount of heat per unit but we can't get

732
00:30:26,550 --> 00:30:31,440
in the forage into them based on that

733
00:30:28,860 --> 00:30:33,750
really high energy requirement and it's

734
00:30:31,440 --> 00:30:35,760
also difficult for cattle to utilize our

735
00:30:33,750 --> 00:30:38,640
quality feeds when it's cold because

736
00:30:35,760 --> 00:30:40,440
intake increases passage rate increases

737
00:30:38,640 --> 00:30:42,840
and nutrient utilization will actually

738
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:44,460
decrease and so just providing the

739
00:30:42,840 --> 00:30:48,000
higher quality feeds is a good idea at

740
00:30:44,460 --> 00:30:49,620
that time separating off thin and young

741
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:51,180
cows seperate and feeding them

742
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:53,610
separately is a good idea if you have

743
00:30:51,180 --> 00:30:55,410
facilities just to give them a little

744
00:30:53,610 --> 00:30:57,630
more attention and again be strategic

745
00:30:55,410 --> 00:31:00,150
about the cattle that you need to maybe

746
00:30:57,630 --> 00:31:04,110
provide a little more nutrient-dense

747
00:31:00,150 --> 00:31:05,850
feeds also Lisa mentioned that Gerry

748
00:31:04,110 --> 00:31:08,280
mentioned it wind breaks and shelter are

749
00:31:05,850 --> 00:31:10,500
really critical that's going to really

750
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:13,800
help reduce the effect of the windchill

751
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:15,900
and reduce that effective temperature if

752
00:31:13,800 --> 00:31:17,190
natural shelter isn't available need to

753
00:31:15,900 --> 00:31:20,190
get out there and provide some portable

754
00:31:17,190 --> 00:31:22,830
wind brakes tires hay bales whatever

755
00:31:20,190 --> 00:31:24,330
you've got a lot of you already probably

756
00:31:22,830 --> 00:31:26,190
feed in late afternoon or early evening

757
00:31:24,330 --> 00:31:28,860
if you can stand it I know a lot of

758
00:31:26,190 --> 00:31:31,080
times it's hard for producers to kind of

759
00:31:28,860 --> 00:31:33,420
wait to feed but basically what that

760
00:31:31,080 --> 00:31:37,380
does is just kind of generates more heat

761
00:31:33,420 --> 00:31:38,730
of fermentation later in the middle of

762
00:31:37,380 --> 00:31:40,200
the night when those cattle me with most

763
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:46,520
and typically the temperatures at the

764
00:31:40,200 --> 00:31:49,860
lowest wanted to just mention hay waste

765
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:53,610
most producers are utilizing round bales

766
00:31:49,860 --> 00:31:55,290
and that's good for minimizing labor but

767
00:31:53,610 --> 00:31:58,530
we do know that studies have shown that

768
00:31:55,290 --> 00:32:00,179
waste is could be pretty high when

769
00:31:58,530 --> 00:32:03,630
you're rolling out bales twenty to forty

770
00:32:00,179 --> 00:32:05,130
five percent so you are in the situation

771
00:32:03,630 --> 00:32:07,260
where you're having to unroll bales out

772
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:10,080
on feed ground it's a good idea to try

773
00:32:07,260 --> 00:32:13,170
to limit access a one versus a four day

774
00:32:10,080 --> 00:32:15,630
supply they've shown that is a waste is

775
00:32:13,170 --> 00:32:17,070
reduced by twenty percent so obviously

776
00:32:15,630 --> 00:32:18,690
if we're coming into a blizzard

777
00:32:17,070 --> 00:32:20,730
situation and you feel like you need to

778
00:32:18,690 --> 00:32:22,610
put a few days of feed out go ahead and

779
00:32:20,730 --> 00:32:25,920
do that this is just thinking long term

780
00:32:22,610 --> 00:32:27,210
over the entire feeding period providing

781
00:32:25,920 --> 00:32:30,270
it one day at a time is probably your

782
00:32:27,210 --> 00:32:31,740
best bet feeding on fresh ground if

783
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:34,170
possible is going to be important to

784
00:32:31,740 --> 00:32:34,620
increase utilization and intake and then

785
00:32:34,170 --> 00:32:36,240
obvious

786
00:32:34,620 --> 00:32:39,120
defeating low-quality hey first and

787
00:32:36,240 --> 00:32:40,650
trying to encourage them to consume all

788
00:32:39,120 --> 00:32:42,960
that before they go to the high quality

789
00:32:40,650 --> 00:32:44,490
feeds it's really difficult to put out

790
00:32:42,960 --> 00:32:45,930
high quality feed and then kind of force

791
00:32:44,490 --> 00:32:49,230
them to go back and consume that low

792
00:32:45,930 --> 00:32:51,450
quality forage so we're thinking about

793
00:32:49,230 --> 00:32:54,480
reducing waste a couple things come to

794
00:32:51,450 --> 00:32:56,340
mind obviously using a bail processor so

795
00:32:54,480 --> 00:32:58,500
basically that just functions to reduce

796
00:32:56,340 --> 00:33:00,840
particle size increase passage rate and

797
00:32:58,500 --> 00:33:03,480
then increase intake so it's a good way

798
00:33:00,840 --> 00:33:07,350
to increase utilization of low to medium

799
00:33:03,480 --> 00:33:09,360
quality forages disadvantages possibly

800
00:33:07,350 --> 00:33:12,030
some increased costs due to labor fuel

801
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,980
investment in equipment you can also get

802
00:33:12,030 --> 00:33:15,660
some leaf loss particularly on windy

803
00:33:13,980 --> 00:33:18,240
days which we have a lot here in Norfolk

804
00:33:15,660 --> 00:33:20,610
North Dakota so that's just a

805
00:33:18,240 --> 00:33:22,440
consideration you can look at your

806
00:33:20,610 --> 00:33:24,840
increased feed availability and

807
00:33:22,440 --> 00:33:27,140
utilization versus the amount of cost

808
00:33:24,840 --> 00:33:29,730
that it's going to take to get you there

809
00:33:27,140 --> 00:33:31,620
hay feeders are certainly another option

810
00:33:29,730 --> 00:33:34,020
they've been shown to really reduce

811
00:33:31,620 --> 00:33:36,179
feeding losses it doesn't work in every

812
00:33:34,020 --> 00:33:38,520
situation obviously but the cone feeder

813
00:33:36,179 --> 00:33:41,280
with a waste panel at the bottom it's

814
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:45,260
definitely a consistent feeder that

815
00:33:41,280 --> 00:33:45,260
results in the least amount of hay waste

816
00:33:47,780 --> 00:33:54,059
so this just goes back to calculating

817
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:55,170
you know conducting a hay inventory and

818
00:33:54,059 --> 00:33:56,670
calculating how much you're going to

819
00:33:55,170 --> 00:33:56,940
need to get you through the rest of the

820
00:33:56,670 --> 00:33:59,640
winter

821
00:33:56,940 --> 00:34:01,410
again just a couple of examples here so

822
00:33:59,640 --> 00:34:03,780
we need to know body weight of our cows

823
00:34:01,410 --> 00:34:05,520
need to know the percent of body weight

824
00:34:03,780 --> 00:34:07,380
as forage that they're consuming and

825
00:34:05,520 --> 00:34:09,510
that's based on forage quality which you

826
00:34:07,380 --> 00:34:10,770
get from your forage analysis and then

827
00:34:09,510 --> 00:34:13,470
we're going to need to calculate in a

828
00:34:10,770 --> 00:34:16,679
waist factor here to get pounds of

829
00:34:13,470 --> 00:34:19,020
forage consumed per cow per day just

830
00:34:16,679 --> 00:34:21,030
example 1400 pounds eating 2 and 1/2

831
00:34:19,020 --> 00:34:23,429
percent of body weight I put in the

832
00:34:21,030 --> 00:34:25,050
waist factor of 25 percent and so

833
00:34:23,429 --> 00:34:27,990
they're gonna be eating red needy right

834
00:34:25,050 --> 00:34:29,490
around 44 pounds per cow per day if we

835
00:34:27,990 --> 00:34:31,230
have a 60 day feeding period to get

836
00:34:29,490 --> 00:34:33,480
through hopefully we're gonna have green

837
00:34:31,230 --> 00:34:35,490
forage available after that and so

838
00:34:33,480 --> 00:34:38,100
that's the total amount of forage needed

839
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:39,960
per cow you also need to know your Bale

840
00:34:38,100 --> 00:34:42,750
weights and your dry matter again that's

841
00:34:39,960 --> 00:34:44,879
your nutrient analysis and so based on

842
00:34:42,750 --> 00:34:46,589
our vale weight and a 90% dry matter

843
00:34:44,879 --> 00:34:49,349
that's how much dry matter we have

844
00:34:46,589 --> 00:34:52,319
will prevail so we end up right around

845
00:34:49,349 --> 00:34:54,089
2.2 bales per cow and you could do a

846
00:34:52,319 --> 00:34:56,549
quick estimation of this just based on

847
00:34:54,089 --> 00:34:58,049
one bale per cow per month adding in a

848
00:34:56,549 --> 00:35:00,660
little bit of extra like I said for

849
00:34:58,049 --> 00:35:02,489
waste and this doesn't necessarily mean

850
00:35:00,660 --> 00:35:04,349
that this is exactly how much each cow

851
00:35:02,489 --> 00:35:06,239
needs I'm just gonna have to adjust

852
00:35:04,349 --> 00:35:07,799
based on temperature condition forage

853
00:35:06,239 --> 00:35:14,249
quality and all those other factors that

854
00:35:07,799 --> 00:35:16,349
we've kind of talked about when you do

855
00:35:14,249 --> 00:35:18,839
look at supplementing some low quality

856
00:35:16,349 --> 00:35:20,969
forages it's important to know what your

857
00:35:18,839 --> 00:35:22,920
goal is and how to most effectively meet

858
00:35:20,969 --> 00:35:24,930
that goal and so if we're talking about

859
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:27,599
low quality forages that have less than

860
00:35:24,930 --> 00:35:29,519
7% protein that's the point at which

861
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:31,710
ruminal fermentation could be limited

862
00:35:29,519 --> 00:35:33,329
and so we need to look at providing a

863
00:35:31,710 --> 00:35:36,839
high quality protein supplement

864
00:35:33,329 --> 00:35:38,700
containing greater than 20% so we've got

865
00:35:36,839 --> 00:35:41,309
alfalfa hay soybean meal distillers

866
00:35:38,700 --> 00:35:42,900
grains the nice thing about cows is they

867
00:35:41,309 --> 00:35:44,519
can be fed these every two to three days

868
00:35:42,900 --> 00:35:47,969
because of their ability to recycle

869
00:35:44,519 --> 00:35:50,700
nitrogen if you've got a forage with

870
00:35:47,969 --> 00:35:52,380
greater than 7 percent protein might

871
00:35:50,700 --> 00:35:54,059
need to look at supplying an energy

872
00:35:52,380 --> 00:35:55,619
supplement and again that's going to be

873
00:35:54,059 --> 00:35:57,630
based on the different requirements of

874
00:35:55,619 --> 00:35:58,950
your various production groups and you

875
00:35:57,630 --> 00:36:00,749
need to kind of look at whether you

876
00:35:58,950 --> 00:36:02,549
choose a fibre versus a starch based

877
00:36:00,749 --> 00:36:04,650
supplement so some of our fiber

878
00:36:02,549 --> 00:36:07,019
supplements are soy hulls wheat myths

879
00:36:04,650 --> 00:36:08,999
and distillers grains and our starches

880
00:36:07,019 --> 00:36:11,489
are our feed grains corn barley and

881
00:36:08,999 --> 00:36:13,589
other things like that so we know if we

882
00:36:11,489 --> 00:36:15,479
feed too much starch on a forage based

883
00:36:13,589 --> 00:36:17,099
diet it's gonna reduce digestibility and

884
00:36:15,479 --> 00:36:19,289
intake of the forage and that's just

885
00:36:17,099 --> 00:36:21,410
based on changes to microbial population

886
00:36:19,289 --> 00:36:24,539
so there's some things you can do to

887
00:36:21,410 --> 00:36:25,979
strategic and make sure that you're

888
00:36:24,539 --> 00:36:31,229
meeting those needs effectively without

889
00:36:25,979 --> 00:36:32,579
too much impact on the microbes just

890
00:36:31,229 --> 00:36:35,130
when I quickly show you a feed cost

891
00:36:32,579 --> 00:36:37,019
calculator this was developed jointly by

892
00:36:35,130 --> 00:36:39,289
the North Dakota farm management

893
00:36:37,019 --> 00:36:42,119
education program and NDSU Extension

894
00:36:39,289 --> 00:36:44,489
this is just a simple Excel spreadsheet

895
00:36:42,119 --> 00:36:47,369
and you can go in and customize all of

896
00:36:44,489 --> 00:36:49,440
your feed stuffs and you can put in

897
00:36:47,369 --> 00:36:51,170
weight we thought it was really

898
00:36:49,440 --> 00:36:53,369
important to include your trucking cost

899
00:36:51,170 --> 00:36:55,979
how many miles that you have to

900
00:36:53,369 --> 00:36:58,469
incorporate when you're evaluating that

901
00:36:55,979 --> 00:37:00,239
so you get a total tracking cost you can

902
00:36:58,469 --> 00:37:02,039
go down here and nutrient content

903
00:37:00,239 --> 00:37:04,559
and use your values from your feet

904
00:37:02,039 --> 00:37:06,899
analysis and plug those in it'll

905
00:37:04,559 --> 00:37:08,819
calculate your dry matter per ton your

906
00:37:06,899 --> 00:37:10,979
new trip your energy and protein per ton

907
00:37:08,819 --> 00:37:13,259
and what you end up with is dollar

908
00:37:10,979 --> 00:37:14,549
amount per pound of nutrient and so

909
00:37:13,259 --> 00:37:15,989
that's what we want you to use to

910
00:37:14,549 --> 00:37:19,729
compare supplements when you're trying

911
00:37:15,989 --> 00:37:19,729
to make those supplementation decisions

912
00:37:20,869 --> 00:37:26,069
and just a couple additional

913
00:37:23,389 --> 00:37:29,099
considerations before I turn it over to

914
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:31,229
John really important to not forget

915
00:37:29,099 --> 00:37:34,319
about water we know that cold use is

916
00:37:31,229 --> 00:37:36,809
going to increase metabolic water use

917
00:37:34,319 --> 00:37:38,969
and so this time of year we don't think

918
00:37:36,809 --> 00:37:40,889
about cow's water requirements as much

919
00:37:38,969 --> 00:37:43,109
as we do in the heat of summer but they

920
00:37:40,889 --> 00:37:45,029
still require adequate water for making

921
00:37:43,109 --> 00:37:47,609
sure that we get good feed I jest in the

922
00:37:45,029 --> 00:37:49,469
utilization and maintain performance and

923
00:37:47,609 --> 00:37:53,069
health especially with lactating cows

924
00:37:49,469 --> 00:37:55,439
so probably minimum a gallon 400 pounds

925
00:37:53,069 --> 00:37:57,959
of body weight I know people have had a

926
00:37:55,439 --> 00:38:00,509
huge amount of challenges this year I'm

927
00:37:57,959 --> 00:38:02,609
just dealing with ice and the tanks so a

928
00:38:00,509 --> 00:38:05,279
couple different options here for tanks

929
00:38:02,609 --> 00:38:07,529
that maybe aren't next to an electric

930
00:38:05,279 --> 00:38:09,539
source a propane stock tank heater

931
00:38:07,529 --> 00:38:13,109
there's water circulators some of those

932
00:38:09,539 --> 00:38:16,079
may result in some excess water flow and

933
00:38:13,109 --> 00:38:17,459
so that can be a challenge but check

934
00:38:16,079 --> 00:38:19,679
into different products that are

935
00:38:17,459 --> 00:38:22,169
available out there and then another

936
00:38:19,679 --> 00:38:24,509
thing is you just need to once we get

937
00:38:22,169 --> 00:38:26,399
your forage analysis done your hay

938
00:38:24,509 --> 00:38:28,099
inventory done want to take a look at

939
00:38:26,399 --> 00:38:30,719
how that's performing in your cow herd

940
00:38:28,099 --> 00:38:32,869
again evaluate that body condition score

941
00:38:30,719 --> 00:38:35,909
and take a look at manure consistency

942
00:38:32,869 --> 00:38:37,619
this pile here or there's not really a

943
00:38:35,909 --> 00:38:39,979
lot of solid rating shows that that cows

944
00:38:37,619 --> 00:38:42,509
getting a little bit of excess protein

945
00:38:39,979 --> 00:38:45,149
here we have adequate protein but you

946
00:38:42,509 --> 00:38:47,729
see some rings and again there's usually

947
00:38:45,149 --> 00:38:50,009
a crater type appearance at the top of

948
00:38:47,729 --> 00:38:51,089
the pile and then down here we get into

949
00:38:50,009 --> 00:38:54,629
deficient protein

950
00:38:51,089 --> 00:38:57,089
there's definitely very obvious rings

951
00:38:54,629 --> 00:38:59,339
and usually this manure pile would be

952
00:38:57,089 --> 00:39:02,069
very firm so that's just one other

953
00:38:59,339 --> 00:39:04,229
option for evaluating the nutrient

954
00:39:02,069 --> 00:39:06,449
status of your herd again I've known

955
00:39:04,229 --> 00:39:08,009
I've thrown a lot at you tonight be sure

956
00:39:06,449 --> 00:39:10,289
to contact me if you have questions or

957
00:39:08,009 --> 00:39:11,729
put them in the chat box and I'm going

958
00:39:10,289 --> 00:39:13,289
to go ahead and turn things over to John

959
00:39:11,729 --> 00:39:14,070
do better and he's going to talk to you

960
00:39:13,289 --> 00:39:19,620
about

961
00:39:14,070 --> 00:39:21,510
in limited hey Thank You Jana welcome to

962
00:39:19,620 --> 00:39:25,560
anybody who might have joined us on the

963
00:39:21,510 --> 00:39:27,900
webinar up here in mine it we've had a

964
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:31,040
couple days a reprieve from the weeks

965
00:39:27,900 --> 00:39:34,140
and weeks of bitter cold wind chills

966
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:37,940
which stressed a lot of things equipment

967
00:39:34,140 --> 00:39:40,080
people a livestock and calves and

968
00:39:37,940 --> 00:39:41,820
unfortunately I think we're all aware

969
00:39:40,080 --> 00:39:43,680
that there's some more stuff coming to

970
00:39:41,820 --> 00:39:46,910
North Dakota and some new challenges

971
00:39:43,680 --> 00:39:46,910
with some blizzard conditions

972
00:40:05,450 --> 00:40:11,700
it's truly amazing to me just how Hardy

973
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:17,070
our cattle are is these pictures kind of

974
00:40:11,700 --> 00:40:18,780
illustrate they can cope with a lot when

975
00:40:17,070 --> 00:40:22,160
we do our part to get them out of the

976
00:40:18,780 --> 00:40:25,080
wind have a little back pad on them and

977
00:40:22,160 --> 00:40:27,000
keep their rumen full so they generate

978
00:40:25,080 --> 00:40:29,040
some heat of fermentation and have some

979
00:40:27,000 --> 00:40:32,730
energy to deal with the wind chills and

980
00:40:29,040 --> 00:40:34,770
the cold in the cases when we can't do

981
00:40:32,730 --> 00:40:36,540
that for one reason or another we got

982
00:40:34,770 --> 00:40:39,570
some cattle suffering from some lameness

983
00:40:36,540 --> 00:40:42,240
or age it's pretty conceivable to have

984
00:40:39,570 --> 00:40:44,430
cows lose three or four pounds a day in

985
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:49,980
a condition score within less than a

986
00:40:44,430 --> 00:40:52,619
month of time we've talked about how

987
00:40:49,980 --> 00:40:55,190
their energy needs go up with the cold

988
00:40:52,619 --> 00:40:57,930
and the wind chill and along with that

989
00:40:55,190 --> 00:41:00,090
their appetites go up the rate of

990
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:01,680
passage goes up they can eat more feed

991
00:41:00,090 --> 00:41:05,119
and we a stock them and give them more

992
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:05,119
feed because it's absolutely necessary

993
00:41:05,240 --> 00:41:11,460
what that does though is it puts us in a

994
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:13,350
position now that some things have

995
00:41:11,460 --> 00:41:14,970
happened what we thought was an adequate

996
00:41:13,350 --> 00:41:16,619
feed supply all sudden is starting to

997
00:41:14,970 --> 00:41:18,900
look a little short and we've got some

998
00:41:16,619 --> 00:41:21,030
instances of people running a little low

999
00:41:18,900 --> 00:41:23,820
and concerned that their hay might not

1000
00:41:21,030 --> 00:41:25,680
get them to where they need to go how

1001
00:41:23,820 --> 00:41:28,800
that happens is just looking at what

1002
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:32,130
we've had to do if we've been feeding 35

1003
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:34,680
pounds of hay normally under more normal

1004
00:41:32,130 --> 00:41:37,950
weather and we've had weeks upon weeks

1005
00:41:34,680 --> 00:41:40,500
of extreme weather with minus 40 and 30

1006
00:41:37,950 --> 00:41:43,140
wind chills daily and we've had 50

1007
00:41:40,500 --> 00:41:45,690
pounds we've all sudden fed 40 percent

1008
00:41:43,140 --> 00:41:47,730
more hay over those two months that's

1009
00:41:45,690 --> 00:41:50,220
led us to a situation where we might

1010
00:41:47,730 --> 00:41:56,190
have to adapt some management to stretch

1011
00:41:50,220 --> 00:41:59,369
the aid that we still have we're not

1012
00:41:56,190 --> 00:42:02,280
there any worse close to grass for most

1013
00:41:59,369 --> 00:42:03,990
of us turnout might be in mid-may even

1014
00:42:02,280 --> 00:42:08,190
late May so we need to have a plan on

1015
00:42:03,990 --> 00:42:09,750
how we're going to get there one of the

1016
00:42:08,190 --> 00:42:11,460
things that we can do is we could

1017
00:42:09,750 --> 00:42:15,330
probably go out and try to find some

1018
00:42:11,460 --> 00:42:17,580
additional hay the reality of being able

1019
00:42:15,330 --> 00:42:18,750
to find it and the cost we might be able

1020
00:42:17,580 --> 00:42:21,390
to locate it

1021
00:42:18,750 --> 00:42:24,930
or is probably time to look at some

1022
00:42:21,390 --> 00:42:27,180
other alternatives most cases beating

1023
00:42:24,930 --> 00:42:29,700
some grain or concentrate feed and

1024
00:42:27,180 --> 00:42:31,440
limiting the hay somewhat might be an

1025
00:42:29,700 --> 00:42:35,460
option that we really have to consider

1026
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:37,920
Lee sit consider I've got two rations in

1027
00:42:35,460 --> 00:42:40,470
this slide one for the last month of

1028
00:42:37,920 --> 00:42:42,480
gestation the one for the and one for

1029
00:42:40,470 --> 00:42:45,420
the first month of lactation as calving

1030
00:42:42,480 --> 00:42:47,760
is undergoing right now we know what a

1031
00:42:45,420 --> 00:42:49,500
cow needs for her energy needs and we

1032
00:42:47,760 --> 00:42:52,110
know we can supply that with medium to

1033
00:42:49,500 --> 00:42:55,080
better quality hay if we've had 40

1034
00:42:52,110 --> 00:42:58,470
pounds in late gestation or fed 45

1035
00:42:55,080 --> 00:43:00,750
pounds in early lactation if we don't

1036
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:04,380
have that much hey we could restrict the

1037
00:43:00,750 --> 00:43:06,450
hay to probably 30 pounds feed 5 or 6

1038
00:43:04,380 --> 00:43:07,770
pounds of corn and with the bedding and

1039
00:43:06,450 --> 00:43:10,200
a little extra straw out there to help

1040
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:12,810
her get content and fill up the room and

1041
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:16,470
we could still meet her tdn or energy

1042
00:43:12,810 --> 00:43:18,750
needs if we happen to have a limited

1043
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:21,360
supply hay but we're long on silage we

1044
00:43:18,750 --> 00:43:24,230
can adjust the ration as well to feed a

1045
00:43:21,360 --> 00:43:28,080
lower percent hey maybe a third hay

1046
00:43:24,230 --> 00:43:30,660
two-thirds or more silage and we can

1047
00:43:28,080 --> 00:43:32,310
mean her needs that way now I recognize

1048
00:43:30,660 --> 00:43:34,290
some people are a little careful about

1049
00:43:32,310 --> 00:43:36,660
how much silage a high-energy feed they

1050
00:43:34,290 --> 00:43:38,790
could feed a calving time bill concerned

1051
00:43:36,660 --> 00:43:40,500
about hi milk production to a young calf

1052
00:43:38,790 --> 00:43:42,630
who can't handle it the potential will

1053
00:43:40,500 --> 00:43:44,730
cause some digestive or scouring calves

1054
00:43:42,630 --> 00:43:53,160
but we can manage that by limiting that

1055
00:43:44,730 --> 00:43:54,450
to an appropriate level feeding grain is

1056
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:56,310
a little different than feeding hay so

1057
00:43:54,450 --> 00:43:58,770
we got to take things a little slower

1058
00:43:56,310 --> 00:44:00,510
and understand that we got a potential

1059
00:43:58,770 --> 00:44:03,030
to cause some digestive problems if we

1060
00:44:00,510 --> 00:44:04,860
don't do it right for the most part it's

1061
00:44:03,030 --> 00:44:07,140
a new feed to cow it's a fast digesting

1062
00:44:04,860 --> 00:44:09,390
feed and it should be introduced into

1063
00:44:07,140 --> 00:44:11,220
the rash and fairly slowly we don't want

1064
00:44:09,390 --> 00:44:14,880
any cows to overeat too fast

1065
00:44:11,220 --> 00:44:16,920
create and acidotic rumen and might have

1066
00:44:14,880 --> 00:44:18,020
some consequences of bloat and Founder

1067
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:20,580
and so forth

1068
00:44:18,020 --> 00:44:22,440
typically we also want to try to feed

1069
00:44:20,580 --> 00:44:25,350
these start to your grains at a low

1070
00:44:22,440 --> 00:44:27,120
percent of the ration just so we don't

1071
00:44:25,350 --> 00:44:28,740
interfere with the digestion of the

1072
00:44:27,120 --> 00:44:30,450
fiber that might be in the ration we

1073
00:44:28,740 --> 00:44:32,220
still get the value out of our forages

1074
00:44:30,450 --> 00:44:34,590
general that's feed

1075
00:44:32,220 --> 00:44:36,840
less than four 10% of body weight or in

1076
00:44:34,590 --> 00:44:39,990
the cows in this state that might be

1077
00:44:36,840 --> 00:44:42,330
four to six pounds for wheat and barley

1078
00:44:39,990 --> 00:44:44,670
we know cracking them breaking the seed

1079
00:44:42,330 --> 00:44:48,359
coats gonna create intensive

1080
00:44:44,670 --> 00:44:50,940
digestibility of those feeds and we also

1081
00:44:48,359 --> 00:44:53,070
like Janice said some of our rations may

1082
00:44:50,940 --> 00:44:55,200
be short of protein and maybe a grain

1083
00:44:53,070 --> 00:44:56,910
by-product which is typically higher in

1084
00:44:55,200 --> 00:44:59,849
protein may be more appropriate than

1085
00:44:56,910 --> 00:45:01,530
feeding just a straight grain as well as

1086
00:44:59,849 --> 00:45:03,210
when we feed these byproducts or a

1087
00:45:01,530 --> 00:45:05,460
higher grain ration they're high in

1088
00:45:03,210 --> 00:45:08,250
phosphorous low in calcium you might

1089
00:45:05,460 --> 00:45:09,690
want to consider that or check our

1090
00:45:08,250 --> 00:45:11,130
mineral to make sure we're not over

1091
00:45:09,690 --> 00:45:12,599
feeding phosphorus and under feeding

1092
00:45:11,130 --> 00:45:15,109
calcium and pick a mineral with the

1093
00:45:12,599 --> 00:45:17,400
right blender proportions of those two

1094
00:45:15,109 --> 00:45:19,140
but most importantly if we're gonna feed

1095
00:45:17,400 --> 00:45:20,880
a limit amount of grain to a herd of

1096
00:45:19,140 --> 00:45:22,590
cows we have to have a way of getting it

1097
00:45:20,880 --> 00:45:24,480
out there get distributed so we don't

1098
00:45:22,590 --> 00:45:26,460
have some cows eating excessive amounts

1099
00:45:24,480 --> 00:45:28,500
that some cows not getting enough so we

1100
00:45:26,460 --> 00:45:30,300
got to give each cow her fair share and

1101
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:38,700
distribute the grain over a pretty wide

1102
00:45:30,300 --> 00:45:40,260
area for that to happen one of the

1103
00:45:38,700 --> 00:45:43,500
biggest challenges is how you do that

1104
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:47,310
how you get four or five pounds of grain

1105
00:45:43,500 --> 00:45:49,800
to your cows you know timely matter and

1106
00:45:47,310 --> 00:45:52,200
everybody gets a share and it's hard to

1107
00:45:49,800 --> 00:45:54,930
handle grain if all you've got is a

1108
00:45:52,200 --> 00:45:56,460
loader tractor for most people who are

1109
00:45:54,930 --> 00:45:59,070
for people who are feeding a mixed

1110
00:45:56,460 --> 00:46:01,109
ration it's a feed bragging certainly

1111
00:45:59,070 --> 00:46:03,300
just weighing in the grain adding it to

1112
00:46:01,109 --> 00:46:06,000
the mix of forages and feeding it out

1113
00:46:03,300 --> 00:46:07,560
works very well some people are not

1114
00:46:06,000 --> 00:46:14,430
equipped with silage you're gonna feed

1115
00:46:07,560 --> 00:46:16,560
silage and so we've got some other

1116
00:46:14,430 --> 00:46:19,650
options with that and we could probably

1117
00:46:16,560 --> 00:46:21,839
get a cake feeder or kick box go out

1118
00:46:19,650 --> 00:46:26,550
there and put it all on the ground or we

1119
00:46:21,839 --> 00:46:27,990
can add an attachment to a you know a

1120
00:46:26,550 --> 00:46:31,109
bale process or some of them have

1121
00:46:27,990 --> 00:46:36,410
hoppers you can put 2030 bushels of corn

1122
00:46:31,109 --> 00:46:36,410
or grain in and top dress the Shred hay

1123
00:46:42,040 --> 00:46:46,910
feeding grain has also got some

1124
00:46:44,720 --> 00:46:48,560
challenges and that sometimes it's

1125
00:46:46,910 --> 00:46:50,000
pretty difficult with a large herd of

1126
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:55,640
cattle to feed them in such a way that

1127
00:46:50,000 --> 00:46:57,680
we can actually minimize the waste you

1128
00:46:55,640 --> 00:47:00,680
know if we've got hard frozen ground dry

1129
00:46:57,680 --> 00:47:01,940
sod or compacted snow and ice

1130
00:47:00,680 --> 00:47:03,620
you know cows will do a pretty good job

1131
00:47:01,940 --> 00:47:06,290
of licking up grain off of those

1132
00:47:03,620 --> 00:47:07,880
surfaces however if we get some slush

1133
00:47:06,290 --> 00:47:11,210
and mud and deep snow

1134
00:47:07,880 --> 00:47:13,070
it won't work very well in those cases

1135
00:47:11,210 --> 00:47:16,580
we almost have to go to feeding these

1136
00:47:13,070 --> 00:47:18,590
things in some kind of a bunk system or

1137
00:47:16,580 --> 00:47:19,160
if we're feeding it on the sod or the

1138
00:47:18,590 --> 00:47:20,960
ground

1139
00:47:19,160 --> 00:47:23,750
certainly it's even better to feed small

1140
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:25,550
piles that's with a trip hopper on your

1141
00:47:23,750 --> 00:47:27,680
feeding attachment so we put little

1142
00:47:25,550 --> 00:47:30,320
files over a roll rather than a

1143
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:39,440
continuous very small shallow line of

1144
00:47:30,320 --> 00:47:41,540
grain certainly grain feeding is a

1145
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:44,840
weight and stretch artery for a little

1146
00:47:41,540 --> 00:47:47,150
bit it's also something that we might be

1147
00:47:44,840 --> 00:47:50,960
kind of required to as hay by the hay

1148
00:47:47,150 --> 00:47:54,740
piles this diminishes and we just have

1149
00:47:50,960 --> 00:47:56,630
to stretch everything so we're gonna do

1150
00:47:54,740 --> 00:47:58,670
what it takes and I commend you for

1151
00:47:56,630 --> 00:48:00,140
being the Stockman you are and you know

1152
00:47:58,670 --> 00:48:02,300
taking care of these cattle under these

1153
00:48:00,140 --> 00:48:05,150
difficult conditions and now I'm gonna

1154
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:06,410
turn it over to dr. Karl toppy and he's

1155
00:48:05,150 --> 00:48:07,790
gonna talk to us a little about where

1156
00:48:06,410 --> 00:48:10,510
maybe we can source some of these

1157
00:48:07,790 --> 00:48:10,510
additional treats

1158
00:48:11,950 --> 00:48:19,040
thank you John I know in our part of the

1159
00:48:16,100 --> 00:48:21,650
world here when has really been extended

1160
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,300
cold and I hear you've been used up

1161
00:48:21,650 --> 00:48:26,690
pretty quickly this year and we're now

1162
00:48:23,300 --> 00:48:28,730
looking for other options to supplement

1163
00:48:26,690 --> 00:48:30,050
our cow herds so I'll turn the feeds are

1164
00:48:28,730 --> 00:48:32,660
certainly one of those things can be

1165
00:48:30,050 --> 00:48:35,090
used co-product feeds are moderate to

1166
00:48:32,660 --> 00:48:37,340
high in protein they're moderate to high

1167
00:48:35,090 --> 00:48:39,470
in energy content as well a couple of

1168
00:48:37,340 --> 00:48:42,140
things that poor quality forages straws

1169
00:48:39,470 --> 00:48:44,240
definitely need to have added to it so

1170
00:48:42,140 --> 00:48:46,190
Coke products work well as a supplement

1171
00:48:44,240 --> 00:48:48,830
or a partial replacement for a forage

1172
00:48:46,190 --> 00:48:50,720
space ration we're excitingly well for

1173
00:48:48,830 --> 00:48:52,790
low quality forages like straws or

1174
00:48:50,720 --> 00:48:54,140
Slough Hays or we've already used our

1175
00:48:52,790 --> 00:48:55,670
good quality feeds and

1176
00:48:54,140 --> 00:48:57,859
we need to add something to the poor

1177
00:48:55,670 --> 00:49:01,690
quality feeds co-products certainly are

1178
00:48:57,859 --> 00:49:03,980
something that Brooke held quite well

1179
00:49:01,690 --> 00:49:07,190
surprisingly North Dakota has many

1180
00:49:03,980 --> 00:49:09,049
co-products Mills crushes refineries and

1181
00:49:07,190 --> 00:49:10,549
processing plants across the state when

1182
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:12,410
you get the other states they don't have

1183
00:49:10,549 --> 00:49:15,019
the number of opportunities that we have

1184
00:49:12,410 --> 00:49:16,789
in North Dakota now I recognize that

1185
00:49:15,019 --> 00:49:18,619
most of these crushes and mills and

1186
00:49:16,789 --> 00:49:20,720
processing plants are located in the

1187
00:49:18,619 --> 00:49:22,670
eastern part of the state which means

1188
00:49:20,720 --> 00:49:24,619
that we have ready access on our side

1189
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:26,299
and western side of the state they have

1190
00:49:24,619 --> 00:49:29,140
the same access but they have freight

1191
00:49:26,299 --> 00:49:29,140
costs and EPA

1192
00:49:30,809 --> 00:49:35,079
just how much coke products do we

1193
00:49:32,979 --> 00:49:36,579
produce in North Dakota there's two

1194
00:49:35,079 --> 00:49:39,219
examples that I'll share of just how

1195
00:49:36,579 --> 00:49:41,049
much volume we produce our state mill

1196
00:49:39,219 --> 00:49:43,089
and elevator that's owned by the state

1197
00:49:41,049 --> 00:49:45,729
of North Dakota it's the largest single

1198
00:49:43,089 --> 00:49:47,529
durum wheat mill located in the world at

1199
00:49:45,729 --> 00:49:49,539
one location there's other companies

1200
00:49:47,529 --> 00:49:52,390
that are bigger but we actually have the

1201
00:49:49,539 --> 00:49:54,969
largest in one location at mills 90,000

1202
00:49:52,390 --> 00:49:57,430
bushels of wheat a day our durum into

1203
00:49:54,969 --> 00:50:00,819
flour semolina that means it produces a

1204
00:49:57,430 --> 00:50:02,349
co-product they mail out the starch the

1205
00:50:00,819 --> 00:50:04,239
co product the fiber and the proteins

1206
00:50:02,349 --> 00:50:06,069
are left over and that's called wheat

1207
00:50:04,239 --> 00:50:09,009
meds or wheat middlings and they produce

1208
00:50:06,069 --> 00:50:11,259
a hundred ton a day which is around 33

1209
00:50:09,009 --> 00:50:15,039
semi-loads just to give a feeling at 10

1210
00:50:11,259 --> 00:50:17,439
pounds per head per day they produce

1211
00:50:15,039 --> 00:50:22,239
enough feed to feed 20,000 head of

1212
00:50:17,439 --> 00:50:23,979
cattle uh daily North Dakota has 900

1213
00:50:22,239 --> 00:50:25,809
thousand head of cattle almost a million

1214
00:50:23,979 --> 00:50:29,229
head of cattle so you can see that 20%

1215
00:50:25,809 --> 00:50:30,880
of our of our cowards in North Dakota

1216
00:50:29,229 --> 00:50:31,989
could be fed just what would produce out

1217
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:33,699
of this one particular mill it's a

1218
00:50:31,989 --> 00:50:36,749
high-quality feed of 18 percent crude

1219
00:50:33,699 --> 00:50:36,749
protein and 83 percent

1220
00:50:37,310 --> 00:50:40,610
even more production in co-product

1221
00:50:39,500 --> 00:50:42,980
feeders found in our ethanol

1222
00:50:40,610 --> 00:50:46,600
distilleries across North Dakota we have

1223
00:50:42,980 --> 00:50:50,330
five plants in North Dakota they produce

1224
00:50:46,600 --> 00:50:51,920
3,000 3,500 to 4,000 tons daily of

1225
00:50:50,330 --> 00:50:54,680
distillers grains that's on a dry matter

1226
00:50:51,920 --> 00:50:56,450
basis give them the cow inventory that

1227
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:59,450
we have we could feed seven pounds of

1228
00:50:56,450 --> 00:51:02,360
distillers grace utilizes feed to every

1229
00:50:59,450 --> 00:51:04,160
cow every day or if we just looked at a

1230
00:51:02,360 --> 00:51:05,990
seventh month period we could feed

1231
00:51:04,160 --> 00:51:07,700
twelve pounds of distillers grains per

1232
00:51:05,990 --> 00:51:10,190
day there's that much product produced

1233
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,960
in North Dakota 12 pounds of distillers

1234
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:14,090
grains would really take the edge off of

1235
00:51:11,960 --> 00:51:16,430
how much hay is needed for our cow

1236
00:51:14,090 --> 00:51:18,530
ration not only that if you look at 30

1237
00:51:16,430 --> 00:51:20,660
percent good protein you're giving

1238
00:51:18,530 --> 00:51:23,330
almost three and a half pounds of crude

1239
00:51:20,660 --> 00:51:25,340
protein per cow per day which just is a

1240
00:51:23,330 --> 00:51:27,500
heck of a lot of protein to provide to a

1241
00:51:25,340 --> 00:51:29,060
cow but on a poor quality ration that

1242
00:51:27,500 --> 00:51:30,860
might be something at Cal certainly

1243
00:51:29,060 --> 00:51:32,900
needs this time of the year again it's

1244
00:51:30,860 --> 00:51:37,910
38 percent crude protein and eighty-six

1245
00:51:32,900 --> 00:51:39,980
EDM again high-quality feeds go products

1246
00:51:37,910 --> 00:51:42,350
there's two big issues that occur with

1247
00:51:39,980 --> 00:51:45,710
them and that's going to be the pricing

1248
00:51:42,350 --> 00:51:47,720
of it as well as the freight

1249
00:51:45,710 --> 00:51:50,150
freight costs can get to be pretty high

1250
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:51,589
it's very competitive with other local

1251
00:51:50,150 --> 00:51:53,150
feeds when you look at the price of

1252
00:51:51,589 --> 00:51:55,309
these Co products but you have to

1253
00:51:53,150 --> 00:51:56,809
include the price of the freight Western

1254
00:51:55,309 --> 00:51:58,400
North Dakota certainly will have a

1255
00:51:56,809 --> 00:52:00,799
higher costs on our eastern part of

1256
00:51:58,400 --> 00:52:02,809
North Dakota it has to compete with our

1257
00:52:00,799 --> 00:52:05,329
other feats like grains Hays and other

1258
00:52:02,809 --> 00:52:08,089
available Co products but there are some

1259
00:52:05,329 --> 00:52:09,859
limitations on our products there are

1260
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:11,180
some long-term stability issues with

1261
00:52:09,859 --> 00:52:13,299
some wheat meds tend to take moisture

1262
00:52:11,180 --> 00:52:15,680
out of the air and consequently mold

1263
00:52:13,299 --> 00:52:17,599
unless they've been put on the air floor

1264
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:19,549
during the summertime the cellar screens

1265
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:21,980
used to have abridging problems with it

1266
00:52:19,549 --> 00:52:26,420
you can still have things like

1267
00:52:21,980 --> 00:52:28,130
distillers excuse me wheat mids is very

1268
00:52:26,420 --> 00:52:29,750
light and fluffy unless it's pelleted

1269
00:52:28,130 --> 00:52:32,180
which increases density to foal and

1270
00:52:29,750 --> 00:52:36,410
makes it a lot easier to transport some

1271
00:52:32,180 --> 00:52:38,779
feeds like the wet corn gluten feed or

1272
00:52:36,410 --> 00:52:40,880
the wet distillers grains or beet

1273
00:52:38,779 --> 00:52:42,650
tailings or beet pulp all are high in

1274
00:52:40,880 --> 00:52:47,720
moisture and of course mold can become

1275
00:52:42,650 --> 00:52:52,579
an issue to calculate and cost per pound

1276
00:52:47,720 --> 00:52:55,400
a nutrient and easily be done it's just

1277
00:52:52,579 --> 00:52:59,329
a matter of taking the feed that you're

1278
00:52:55,400 --> 00:53:01,819
going to be using and taking the cost

1279
00:52:59,329 --> 00:53:04,339
per ton and dividing it by the energy

1280
00:53:01,819 --> 00:53:07,579
content of the feed so in this example I

1281
00:53:04,339 --> 00:53:09,980
used $90 ton wheat meds that has an 80

1282
00:53:07,579 --> 00:53:11,359
60 DM you do the math and all of a

1283
00:53:09,980 --> 00:53:14,329
sudden your cost per pound of protein

1284
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:16,970
counted tdn or energy content is five

1285
00:53:14,329 --> 00:53:19,430
cents a pound if you need these tdn

1286
00:53:16,970 --> 00:53:22,339
values go to our NDSU a s 1182

1287
00:53:19,430 --> 00:53:27,950
alternative by-product feeds publication

1288
00:53:22,339 --> 00:53:30,230
that has a directory of of prices of tdn

1289
00:53:27,950 --> 00:53:32,549
values in the end the price of TD n

1290
00:53:30,230 --> 00:53:35,380
values

1291
00:53:32,549 --> 00:53:38,709
we have a bunch of co-products across

1292
00:53:35,380 --> 00:53:41,380
North Dakota in most parts they're all

1293
00:53:38,709 --> 00:53:43,900
low in starch and high in fiber and high

1294
00:53:41,380 --> 00:53:47,009
in protein feeds that are perfect for a

1295
00:53:43,900 --> 00:53:50,880
coward that's being fed a low for a low

1296
00:53:47,009 --> 00:53:53,289
quality forage in the milling process or

1297
00:53:50,880 --> 00:53:56,650
fermentation process most of the starch

1298
00:53:53,289 --> 00:53:59,319
is removed in these products and/or the

1299
00:53:56,650 --> 00:54:00,849
oil if it's a oil seed results going to

1300
00:53:59,319 --> 00:54:03,309
be something that's very high in fiber

1301
00:54:00,849 --> 00:54:04,719
and usually high in protein - and this

1302
00:54:03,309 --> 00:54:09,219
fiber I need to point out is very

1303
00:54:04,719 --> 00:54:10,569
digestible in the rumen diet distillers

1304
00:54:09,219 --> 00:54:12,849
grains are produced in five different

1305
00:54:10,569 --> 00:54:15,160
plants in North Dakota third senescent

1306
00:54:12,849 --> 00:54:16,929
all at Casselton Hank is in renewable

1307
00:54:15,160 --> 00:54:19,569
energy at Hank and Sutton Dakota spirit

1308
00:54:16,929 --> 00:54:21,489
AG ethanol spirit wood bluefin ethanol

1309
00:54:19,569 --> 00:54:25,029
at underwood as well as red trail energy

1310
00:54:21,489 --> 00:54:27,939
at Richardson it's a very popular feed

1311
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:30,189
you can see some of the values over here

1312
00:54:27,939 --> 00:54:31,749
it's very palatable that that's an

1313
00:54:30,189 --> 00:54:33,160
understatement cows really go after the

1314
00:54:31,749 --> 00:54:35,469
sweet quite well it mixes well with

1315
00:54:33,160 --> 00:54:37,569
other feeds conditions the feed maybe

1316
00:54:35,469 --> 00:54:39,369
there's a limit to 30% of the diet this

1317
00:54:37,569 --> 00:54:41,289
is some of the sulfur issues that you

1318
00:54:39,369 --> 00:54:43,539
want to use there are ethanol plants and

1319
00:54:41,289 --> 00:54:45,189
other parts of the in South Dakota and

1320
00:54:43,539 --> 00:54:47,199
other states that can be trucked into

1321
00:54:45,189 --> 00:54:49,029
North Dakota too right now they've

1322
00:54:47,199 --> 00:54:53,259
raised the price of distillers grain so

1323
00:54:49,029 --> 00:54:55,660
it's still cost competitive but at $160

1324
00:54:53,259 --> 00:54:57,729
a ton it's no longer the cheapest feeds

1325
00:54:55,660 --> 00:55:00,759
out there that we can provide to our cow

1326
00:54:57,729 --> 00:55:02,709
herd wheat middlings is another option

1327
00:55:00,759 --> 00:55:03,609
there's five plants in North Dakota that

1328
00:55:02,709 --> 00:55:06,099
produces wheat meds

1329
00:55:03,609 --> 00:55:08,049
Dakota growers in Carrington Minot

1330
00:55:06,099 --> 00:55:08,650
milling in Minot iron in milling down at

1331
00:55:08,049 --> 00:55:10,059
Fairmont

1332
00:55:08,650 --> 00:55:12,459
of course North Dakota Mellon Alva that

1333
00:55:10,059 --> 00:55:16,890
we talked about in Grand Forks and to a

1334
00:55:12,459 --> 00:55:20,589
lesser extent the plant up in can do

1335
00:55:16,890 --> 00:55:22,239
some of these have already been their

1336
00:55:20,589 --> 00:55:24,489
source to supply has been booked out for

1337
00:55:22,239 --> 00:55:26,589
the year although at the mill and

1338
00:55:24,489 --> 00:55:29,019
elevator and Dakota growers availability

1339
00:55:26,589 --> 00:55:33,689
is still available an 80 or 90 dollars a

1340
00:55:29,019 --> 00:55:33,689
ton turns into a fairly competitive feed

1341
00:55:33,730 --> 00:55:40,690
corn gluten feed is created through the

1342
00:55:37,630 --> 00:55:42,369
process of a wet corn milling which is

1343
00:55:40,690 --> 00:55:44,500
the plant located on a Wahpeton North

1344
00:55:42,369 --> 00:55:46,359
Dakota at Cargill of course when corn

1345
00:55:44,500 --> 00:55:51,460
milling makes high fructose corn syrup

1346
00:55:46,359 --> 00:55:55,180
and the leftover product is 83% tdn 20%

1347
00:55:51,460 --> 00:55:57,400
protein very palatable it can be sold as

1348
00:55:55,180 --> 00:55:58,960
either dried or wet you need to contact

1349
00:55:57,400 --> 00:56:01,210
these people because usually

1350
00:55:58,960 --> 00:56:02,530
availability is was rather reduced

1351
00:56:01,210 --> 00:56:03,579
because they're sold out it's that

1352
00:56:02,530 --> 00:56:06,160
popular

1353
00:56:03,579 --> 00:56:08,380
it's very palatable soy hauls is a

1354
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:10,089
product that we haven't had in North

1355
00:56:08,380 --> 00:56:12,400
Dakota unless we Freight it in for

1356
00:56:10,089 --> 00:56:14,710
Minnesota or South Dakota until the

1357
00:56:12,400 --> 00:56:17,799
recent several years now the ADM planted

1358
00:56:14,710 --> 00:56:19,030
Enderlin is producing soy hauls since

1359
00:56:17,799 --> 00:56:21,609
they're now crushing North Dakota

1360
00:56:19,030 --> 00:56:23,920
soybeans so high energy content feed

1361
00:56:21,609 --> 00:56:26,020
it's pelleted it's protein can range

1362
00:56:23,920 --> 00:56:27,819
from 8 to 13 percent so be sure to know

1363
00:56:26,020 --> 00:56:30,130
what your product is if you may not be

1364
00:56:27,819 --> 00:56:31,480
considered a protein source for your

1365
00:56:30,130 --> 00:56:34,180
feed but it certainly is a replacement

1366
00:56:31,480 --> 00:56:35,680
for for our feed I do have to point out

1367
00:56:34,180 --> 00:56:37,390
that it's usually high in calcium and

1368
00:56:35,680 --> 00:56:39,819
low in phosphorus most of our other co

1369
00:56:37,390 --> 00:56:42,099
products are always high in phosphorus

1370
00:56:39,819 --> 00:56:44,170
maybe triple x amount of phosphorus it

1371
00:56:42,099 --> 00:56:48,359
would be in green and of course calcium

1372
00:56:44,170 --> 00:56:52,329
is quite low a coin like John identified

1373
00:56:48,359 --> 00:56:55,000
adding extra calcium to co-product feeds

1374
00:56:52,329 --> 00:56:58,370
is always indicated

1375
00:56:55,000 --> 00:57:00,710
if you're located close enough to a beet

1376
00:56:58,370 --> 00:57:02,570
pulp plant or a sugar refinery like

1377
00:57:00,710 --> 00:57:04,700
American crystalline Hillsboro

1378
00:57:02,570 --> 00:57:07,640
drayton East Grand Forks or Crookston or

1379
00:57:04,700 --> 00:57:09,560
even min dak down at Wahpeton

1380
00:57:07,640 --> 00:57:11,780
they have a supply of beet pulp and

1381
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,270
tailings that they usually at least

1382
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:17,360
American crystal provides a no cost

1383
00:57:14,270 --> 00:57:19,040
other than trucking bar says you need to

1384
00:57:17,360 --> 00:57:20,510
be on the list to be able to get it and

1385
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:21,950
if you have a trucker that hauls that

1386
00:57:20,510 --> 00:57:24,530
this is a product that works quite well

1387
00:57:21,950 --> 00:57:26,870
I think of it as a nice replacement for

1388
00:57:24,530 --> 00:57:29,300
silage if it's if you're feeding the wet

1389
00:57:26,870 --> 00:57:31,010
pulp or the wet retailing be sure to

1390
00:57:29,300 --> 00:57:33,380
know if the moisture content is quite

1391
00:57:31,010 --> 00:57:35,330
high so that's what limits trucking to

1392
00:57:33,380 --> 00:57:38,060
usually around a hundred miles away from

1393
00:57:35,330 --> 00:57:42,020
the plant before other sources of feed

1394
00:57:38,060 --> 00:57:44,150
get to be priced more competitive we do

1395
00:57:42,020 --> 00:57:46,790
have protein sources or crushes in North

1396
00:57:44,150 --> 00:57:48,590
Dakota canola meal is very popular if

1397
00:57:46,790 --> 00:57:51,080
that's all you need it's usually priced

1398
00:57:48,590 --> 00:57:52,850
competitive it's produced in Belva as

1399
00:57:51,080 --> 00:57:54,950
well as in Belem or West Fargo even up a

1400
00:57:52,850 --> 00:57:57,830
holic Minnesota these plants are

1401
00:57:54,950 --> 00:58:00,770
available linseed Mills crushed him in

1402
00:57:57,830 --> 00:58:02,630
Cargill and West Fargo on a sporadic

1403
00:58:00,770 --> 00:58:04,670
basis but it is available soybean meal

1404
00:58:02,630 --> 00:58:07,130
is priced very high and it works quite

1405
00:58:04,670 --> 00:58:09,350
well if you want to use soybean in your

1406
00:58:07,130 --> 00:58:11,750
ration that's produced down ADM and

1407
00:58:09,350 --> 00:58:13,400
envelope 46% crude protein the real

1408
00:58:11,750 --> 00:58:16,070
bargain on these particular protein

1409
00:58:13,400 --> 00:58:19,100
sources right now a sunflower meal so if

1410
00:58:16,070 --> 00:58:20,570
you're needing protein sunflower meal

1411
00:58:19,100 --> 00:58:22,940
could be a hundred and twenty dollars a

1412
00:58:20,570 --> 00:58:24,800
ton even less than that and it's

1413
00:58:22,940 --> 00:58:26,270
available out of Cargill and West Fargo

1414
00:58:24,800 --> 00:58:30,420
and it can be available out of northern

1415
00:58:26,270 --> 00:58:32,599
Sun and Android if you

1416
00:58:30,420 --> 00:58:34,980
need to have a list of co-products

1417
00:58:32,599 --> 00:58:36,990

00:58:34,980 --> 00:58:38,660
recent price please go to our account

1419
00:58:36,990 --> 00:58:41,369
and research extensions on their

homepage on the internet and look for

1421
00:58:41,369 --> 00:58:45,780
livestock and then look for livestock

1422

Dakota and with that good luck in trying

1425
00:58:50,790 --> 00:58:54,510
to source extra feed for your cow herd

1426
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:57,930
if you're running yourself short on hay

1427
00:58:54,510 --> 00:58:59,549
and can't find a there is a vast amount

1428
00:58:57,930 --> 00:59:01,559
of co products available in North Dakota

1429
00:58:59,549 --> 00:59:03,210
if you can find out what's available our

1430
00:59:01,559 --> 00:59:06,299
next speaker is going to be Miranda

1431
00:59:03,210 --> 00:59:08,040
Meehan she's our environmental livestock

1432
00:59:06,299 --> 00:59:09,770
environmental steward specialist and dr.

1433
00:59:08,040 --> 00:59:14,720
Meehan is here to talk to us about

1434
00:59:09,770 --> 00:59:14,720
pasture and range turnout issues

1435
00:59:15,770 --> 00:59:21,360
good evening so I'm gonna just change

1436
00:59:18,720 --> 00:59:23,850
paces a little bit here and talk about

1437
00:59:21,360 --> 00:59:27,810
as what we expect as we look forward to

1438
00:59:23,850 --> 00:59:30,630
a greener grass especially into some

1439
00:59:27,810 --> 00:59:33,930
strategies to help you plan for the 2019

1440
00:59:30,630 --> 00:59:36,930
grazing season one thing I want to keep

1441
00:59:33,930 --> 00:59:38,310
you all to keep in mind is that yes we

1442
00:59:36,930 --> 00:59:41,040
do have a lot of snow and there's a lot

1443
00:59:38,310 --> 00:59:45,630
of moisture in that snow but due to of

1444
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:48,780
the timing of melt and in how things

1445
00:59:45,630 --> 00:59:50,550
melt a lot of that snow is going to be

1446
00:59:48,780 --> 00:59:52,830
run off and yes it's going to be great

1447
00:59:50,550 --> 00:59:56,580
for refilling some of our stock dams and

1448
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:58,830
surface waters however that is not going

1449
00:59:56,580 --> 01:00:01,830
to be available there's not going to be

1450
00:59:58,830 --> 01:00:05,250
the principal source of responsible for

1451
01:00:01,830 --> 01:00:07,170
our forage production this year 80

1452
01:00:05,250 --> 01:00:10,350
percent of forage production in North

1453
01:00:07,170 --> 01:00:14,310
Dakota B comes from precipitation in May

1454
01:00:10,350 --> 01:00:16,110
and June so don't be making your grazing

1455
01:00:14,310 --> 01:00:17,970
management decisions based off of the

1456
01:00:16,110 --> 01:00:23,940
available precipitation snow that we

1457
01:00:17,970 --> 01:00:26,190
have right now so when we when I talk we

1458
01:00:23,940 --> 01:00:28,020
talk about preparing for a grazing

1459
01:00:26,190 --> 01:00:30,210
season and when should we be putting

1460
01:00:28,020 --> 01:00:32,430
those cattle out there I know a lot of

1461
01:00:30,210 --> 01:00:35,340
people use a calendar date the ideal way

1462
01:00:32,430 --> 01:00:37,020
to do this is to look at grazing

1463
01:00:35,340 --> 01:00:38,940
readiness based off a plant development

1464
01:00:37,020 --> 01:00:40,800
or you can estimate it using growing

1465
01:00:38,940 --> 01:00:42,600
degree days we do have a publication

1466
01:00:40,800 --> 01:00:45,030
that goes through that so I'm not going

1467
01:00:42,600 --> 01:00:46,680
to go in detail the simplest way is to

1468
01:00:45,030 --> 01:00:49,590
go out there look at plant development

1469
01:00:46,680 --> 01:00:51,330
or introduce pasture species such as

1470
01:00:49,590 --> 01:00:53,580
crested wheatgrass smooth round grass

1471
01:00:51,330 --> 01:00:56,460
meadow chrome that would be the three

1472
01:00:53,580 --> 01:00:57,720
leaf stage and so you just simply are

1473
01:00:56,460 --> 01:01:00,780
gonna count the leaves starting from the

1474
01:00:57,720 --> 01:01:03,720
bottom one two three and then for our

1475
01:01:00,780 --> 01:01:09,510
native species it would be the three and

1476
01:01:03,720 --> 01:01:11,550
a half leaf stage and why do we use this

1477
01:01:09,510 --> 01:01:13,170
as a rule of thumb it's important to be

1478
01:01:11,550 --> 01:01:16,410
looking at this and not crazy in our

1479
01:01:13,170 --> 01:01:17,940
class too early because grazing too

1480
01:01:16,410 --> 01:01:20,570
early can stress those plants out and

1481
01:01:17,940 --> 01:01:22,860
actually result in up to a sixty percent

1482
01:01:20,570 --> 01:01:25,590
decrease in your forage production for

1483
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:27,599
the grazing season as a typical rule of

1484
01:01:25,590 --> 01:01:30,209
thumb we expect

1485
01:01:27,599 --> 01:01:33,690
our crested wheatgrass is already early

1486
01:01:30,209 --> 01:01:35,309
May our ohms smooth brown grass metal

1487
01:01:33,690 --> 01:01:37,559
grown grass being the most common

1488
01:01:35,309 --> 01:01:40,380
typically ready to graze in mid-may if

1489
01:01:37,559 --> 01:01:43,949
you have post contracts here peel and

1490
01:01:40,380 --> 01:01:46,289
that's typically stuff that's coming on

1491
01:01:43,949 --> 01:01:48,839
contract is typically somewhere called

1492
01:01:46,289 --> 01:01:50,759
intermediate wheat grasses and you can

1493
01:01:48,839 --> 01:01:54,420
expect that to be available in late May

1494
01:01:50,759 --> 01:01:57,239
and our native pastures typically aren't

1495
01:01:54,420 --> 01:02:00,119
ready until earliest is early June

1496
01:01:57,239 --> 01:02:01,499
depending if you're cool or warm season

1497
01:02:00,119 --> 01:02:03,989
dominated and that would be our full

1498
01:02:01,499 --> 01:02:09,029
season dominated pastures which are most

1499
01:02:03,989 --> 01:02:12,390
common across the state however I want

1500
01:02:09,029 --> 01:02:14,400
to keep him remind you and is that that

1501
01:02:12,390 --> 01:02:16,769
there's a lot of variability so we don't

1502
01:02:14,400 --> 01:02:20,640
want you want to be careful but just

1503
01:02:16,769 --> 01:02:23,069
looking at those states it varies across

1504
01:02:20,640 --> 01:02:25,259
the state some research that we've been

1505
01:02:23,069 --> 01:02:27,630
doing with with the extension agents

1506
01:02:25,259 --> 01:02:30,660
across the state shows a two week

1507
01:02:27,630 --> 01:02:33,359
variability between counties when

1508
01:02:30,660 --> 01:02:36,089
different species are available to graze

1509
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:38,009
and also we have year to year

1510
01:02:36,089 --> 01:02:40,019
variability so just because that's the

1511
01:02:38,009 --> 01:02:42,239
gate you were able to start crazy last

1512
01:02:40,019 --> 01:02:44,400
year does not mean that that's when our

1513
01:02:42,239 --> 01:02:48,059
species are going to be available to

1514
01:02:44,400 --> 01:02:50,039
graze this year so the last two years I

1515
01:02:48,059 --> 01:02:53,329
have been recommending agents across the

1516
01:02:50,039 --> 01:02:55,469
state to monitor grazing readiness for

1517
01:02:53,329 --> 01:02:57,569
some of our common passion of these

1518
01:02:55,469 --> 01:03:01,829
species Chris wheatgrass smooth brown

1519
01:02:57,569 --> 01:03:04,259
grass and then our most common native

1520
01:03:01,829 --> 01:03:05,969
species would be Western week for us we

1521
01:03:04,259 --> 01:03:07,739
also have some what that green needle

1522
01:03:05,969 --> 01:03:09,329
grass but there's some challenges there

1523
01:03:07,739 --> 01:03:11,630
because it's a little bit more difficult

1524
01:03:09,329 --> 01:03:17,249
to identify early in the grazing season

1525
01:03:11,630 --> 01:03:20,999
in 2017 if we found that crested wheat

1526
01:03:17,249 --> 01:03:25,229
grass was a was ready to graze at that

1527
01:03:20,999 --> 01:03:29,009
three leaf stage around May fourth where

1528
01:03:25,229 --> 01:03:31,859
a broom was actually earlier at late

1529
01:03:29,009 --> 01:03:34,829
April April 24th where our Western wheat

1530
01:03:31,859 --> 01:03:37,650
grass wasn't avail wasn't at the three

1531
01:03:34,829 --> 01:03:40,020
and a half leaf stage until the end of

1532
01:03:37,650 --> 01:03:42,240
May almost Morial day

1533
01:03:40,020 --> 01:03:43,560
one of the reasons you'd be probably

1534
01:03:42,240 --> 01:03:45,180
wondering why is crested wheat grass

1535
01:03:43,560 --> 01:03:46,740
behind smooth grown grass when I said

1536
01:03:45,180 --> 01:03:48,990
that should be available to graze

1537
01:03:46,740 --> 01:03:51,330
earlier I don't know if you guys if you

1538
01:03:48,990 --> 01:03:56,790
remember that we warmed up pretty early

1539
01:03:51,330 --> 01:03:58,410
in 2017 but then we had a cold snap

1540
01:03:56,790 --> 01:04:00,089
later as things were starting to grow

1541
01:03:58,410 --> 01:04:02,580
and that said some of our grasses back

1542
01:04:00,089 --> 01:04:05,280
including the crusted me curse which was

1543
01:04:02,580 --> 01:04:07,530
further in development at that time I

1544
01:04:05,280 --> 01:04:09,680
did have to get a lot of pictures from

1545
01:04:07,530 --> 01:04:11,849
County agents where they were out there

1546
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:15,619
monitoring and grazing readiness and

1547
01:04:11,849 --> 01:04:15,619
they had pictures of the grass was snow

1548
01:04:17,359 --> 01:04:27,510
looking at 2018 a crested wheat grass

1549
01:04:21,780 --> 01:04:30,690
was similar we were at May 11th and then

1550
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:34,410
our smooth brown grass was actually two

1551
01:04:30,690 --> 01:04:36,300
weeks later at May 7th so typically

1552
01:04:34,410 --> 01:04:40,140
around where we would normally expect it

1553
01:04:36,300 --> 01:04:44,040
to be our Western grass was about the

1554
01:04:40,140 --> 01:04:47,910
same at that end of May May it May 20th

1555
01:04:44,040 --> 01:04:49,500
it was this year so one of the things

1556
01:04:47,910 --> 01:04:52,010
that we've seen here though we actually

1557
01:04:49,500 --> 01:04:55,800
seen a delay in some of the species

1558
01:04:52,010 --> 01:04:57,750
because of the drought to 2017 depending

1559
01:04:55,800 --> 01:05:01,580
on if those areas if pastures were

1560
01:04:57,750 --> 01:05:03,990
grazed hard they seen a decrease in in

1561
01:05:01,580 --> 01:05:08,640
productivity and a delay and grazing

1562
01:05:03,990 --> 01:05:11,490
readiness in some areas so I expected

1563
01:05:08,640 --> 01:05:13,080
something similar this year with we will

1564
01:05:11,490 --> 01:05:15,570
have a delay in our Gracie and readiness

1565
01:05:13,080 --> 01:05:17,280
because it's gonna there's a delay with

1566
01:05:15,570 --> 01:05:19,320
all the snow when our plants are going

1567
01:05:17,280 --> 01:05:20,730
to start growing and photosynthesizing

1568
01:05:19,320 --> 01:05:23,490
and her grounds going to take longer to

1569
01:05:20,730 --> 01:05:26,820
warm up how long that delay is going to

1570
01:05:23,490 --> 01:05:30,240
be I can't say right now we do plan on

1571
01:05:26,820 --> 01:05:31,589
working with the agents across the state

1572
01:05:30,240 --> 01:05:33,000
and monitoring again this year so

1573
01:05:31,589 --> 01:05:39,270
hopefully we can keep you up to date on

1574
01:05:33,000 --> 01:05:40,770
that as we move forward I know a lot of

1575
01:05:39,270 --> 01:05:43,500
you are probably it changed to get out

1576
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,730
and get your cows out of lots and

1577
01:05:43,500 --> 01:05:45,810
especially the snow when it starts to

1578
01:05:44,730 --> 01:05:47,220
melt you're going to have a mess and

1579
01:05:45,810 --> 01:05:50,130
really like you want to get them out of

1580
01:05:47,220 --> 01:05:52,800
there you're also running hit short on

1581
01:05:50,130 --> 01:05:53,820
hay supplies so here there's some

1582
01:05:52,800 --> 01:05:55,800
strategies

1583
01:05:53,820 --> 01:05:59,130
you can look at you get them out there a

1584
01:05:55,800 --> 01:06:02,220
little earlier but while reducing that

1585
01:05:59,130 --> 01:06:04,350
the stress to those those pastures and

1586
01:06:02,220 --> 01:06:08,550
I'm talking about these and what I would

1587
01:06:04,350 --> 01:06:11,700
say the order preference so ideally if

1588
01:06:08,550 --> 01:06:14,940
you can looking at supplementing on hair

1589
01:06:11,700 --> 01:06:17,510
pastureland kasher again need it or we

1590
01:06:14,940 --> 01:06:19,620
those can graft species not native

1591
01:06:17,510 --> 01:06:23,820
specifically things like the domes and

1592
01:06:19,620 --> 01:06:25,050
your and your crested and then providing

1593
01:06:23,820 --> 01:06:27,510
them some additional forward if you

1594
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:29,490
Forge if you still have it available are

1595
01:06:27,510 --> 01:06:33,150
supplementing with some of the other

1596
01:06:29,490 --> 01:06:35,010
products that Carl talked about the next

1597
01:06:33,150 --> 01:06:36,570
one thing to look at would be grazing

1598
01:06:35,010 --> 01:06:40,260
some of those domesticated grass

1599
01:06:36,570 --> 01:06:41,760
pastures then moving and if you don't

1600
01:06:40,260 --> 01:06:43,290
have that as option utilizing some of

1601
01:06:41,760 --> 01:06:45,660
your winter annuals for spring grazing

1602
01:06:43,290 --> 01:06:50,400
and Phil should be available early May

1603
01:06:45,660 --> 01:06:54,590
so things like triticale rye or winter

1604
01:06:50,400 --> 01:06:57,690
wheat if if you planted those last fall

1605
01:06:54,590 --> 01:07:00,570
then the next thing if those aren't

1606
01:06:57,690 --> 01:07:02,730
options for you would be evaluating what

1607
01:07:00,570 --> 01:07:06,360
you have for native native pastures

1608
01:07:02,730 --> 01:07:07,650
native rangelands we have a pretty big

1609
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:09,540
issue across the state with kentucky

1610
01:07:07,650 --> 01:07:12,750
bluegrass invading our native rangelands

1611
01:07:09,540 --> 01:07:14,610
and and becoming dominant on a melon

1612
01:07:12,750 --> 01:07:16,350
long pasture especially eastern portion

1613
01:07:14,610 --> 01:07:19,410
of the state so if look at this picture

1614
01:07:16,350 --> 01:07:20,640
here this would be a patch or pasture

1615
01:07:19,410 --> 01:07:23,970
that's been taken over by a Kentucky

1616
01:07:20,640 --> 01:07:25,890
bluegrass so that would be a good option

1617
01:07:23,970 --> 01:07:27,420
if you're gonna graze native range if

1618
01:07:25,890 --> 01:07:30,150
you have a pasture looks like that

1619
01:07:27,420 --> 01:07:31,890
starting there actually could help

1620
01:07:30,150 --> 01:07:34,140
decrease your Kentucky bluegrass you're

1621
01:07:31,890 --> 01:07:36,240
using it early in the season and give

1622
01:07:34,140 --> 01:07:40,140
some your Nadeau's a competitive

1623
01:07:36,240 --> 01:07:42,210
advantage one thing is that this would

1624
01:07:40,140 --> 01:07:43,470
be very bowl of protein so you

1625
01:07:42,210 --> 01:07:48,300
definitely would need to supplement

1626
01:07:43,470 --> 01:07:51,290
protein in this situation and then

1627
01:07:48,300 --> 01:07:55,290
finally if if you have to graze native

1628
01:07:51,290 --> 01:07:57,990
pastures choosing one that's dominated

1629
01:07:55,290 --> 01:08:00,000
by cool season grasses and if you're not

1630
01:07:57,990 --> 01:08:03,120
sure about composition need some help

1631
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:05,760
with the identification contact your

1632
01:08:03,120 --> 01:08:06,730
extension agent or your NRCS I'm sure

1633
01:08:05,760 --> 01:08:11,589
they'll be happy

1634
01:08:06,730 --> 01:08:14,560
and help you with that few other

1635
01:08:11,589 --> 01:08:18,100
considerations which we haven't talked

1636
01:08:14,560 --> 01:08:19,719
about yet is this is what especially

1637
01:08:18,100 --> 01:08:24,549
with this coming storm we're talking in

1638
01:08:19,719 --> 01:08:27,850
record level historic storms that we

1639
01:08:24,549 --> 01:08:29,500
need to be thinking about flooding if we

1640
01:08:27,850 --> 01:08:30,819
have a riparian passion that we usually

1641
01:08:29,500 --> 01:08:33,190
turn out in the spring

1642
01:08:30,819 --> 01:08:35,380
maybe avoiding that because it's going

1643
01:08:33,190 --> 01:08:38,670
to be a mess for one and you're gonna

1644
01:08:35,380 --> 01:08:42,310
have the decline in health but also that

1645
01:08:38,670 --> 01:08:44,950
that is gonna tear that pasture up and

1646
01:08:42,310 --> 01:08:49,779
may reduce its productivity in the long

1647
01:08:44,950 --> 01:08:51,880
run other thing is you know a lot of you

1648
01:08:49,779 --> 01:08:54,069
aren't thinking about drill right now

1649
01:08:51,880 --> 01:08:58,719
except for maybe those of you that were

1650
01:08:54,069 --> 01:09:01,150
impacted in 2018 but we do we did see

1651
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:03,759
that keep that delay in grazing

1652
01:09:01,150 --> 01:09:05,620
readiness from those areas impacted by

1653
01:09:03,759 --> 01:09:07,989
the 2017 drought if they're a grazed

1654
01:09:05,620 --> 01:09:10,600
hard to be also seen decrease in

1655
01:09:07,989 --> 01:09:13,900
productivity this is a good example of

1656
01:09:10,600 --> 01:09:17,890
that delay in all over county last year

1657
01:09:13,900 --> 01:09:19,690
our Western B grass on in mid-may was at

1658
01:09:17,890 --> 01:09:23,020
the one and a half leaf stage compared

1659
01:09:19,690 --> 01:09:25,420
to the three and a half leaf stage early

1660
01:09:23,020 --> 01:09:27,100
May the year before and there's a pretty

1661
01:09:25,420 --> 01:09:28,900
significant it's probably hard to see in

1662
01:09:27,100 --> 01:09:30,460
these photos but there's a pretty

1663
01:09:28,900 --> 01:09:32,950
significant difference in the

1664
01:09:30,460 --> 01:09:34,750
productivity and the height of the

1665
01:09:32,950 --> 01:09:38,589
forage and those in those two pictures

1666
01:09:34,750 --> 01:09:40,089
and they actually seen that as it stayed

1667
01:09:38,589 --> 01:09:42,730
pretty stunted as it got to the three

1668
01:09:40,089 --> 01:09:46,049
and a half leaf stage there was an

1669
01:09:42,730 --> 01:09:50,529
isolated part of the state that did

1670
01:09:46,049 --> 01:09:53,290
experience drought in 2018 so if you

1671
01:09:50,529 --> 01:09:55,900
were in that area you also some of you

1672
01:09:53,290 --> 01:09:59,920
also had the experience don't in in 17

1673
01:09:55,900 --> 01:10:01,660
and so being cautious and maybe not

1674
01:09:59,920 --> 01:10:04,060
starting on pastures that you put extra

1675
01:10:01,660 --> 01:10:05,980
pressure on and those in those years so

1676
01:10:04,060 --> 01:10:09,760
they have a little extra time to recover

1677
01:10:05,980 --> 01:10:11,469
as always try not you know not over

1678
01:10:09,760 --> 01:10:14,680
grazing if you do put a little extra

1679
01:10:11,469 --> 01:10:16,900
pressure on a pasture make sure they're

1680
01:10:14,680 --> 01:10:19,480
you're allowing enough time for it to

1681
01:10:16,900 --> 01:10:20,430
recover from that extra prep pressure so

1682
01:10:19,480 --> 01:10:22,200
if you started

1683
01:10:20,430 --> 01:10:25,140
in a year starting in one of your native

1684
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:28,590
pastures early in the grazing season

1685
01:10:25,140 --> 01:10:30,450
this year making sure that you don't

1686
01:10:28,590 --> 01:10:36,480
come back into that pasture again until

1687
01:10:30,450 --> 01:10:38,790
next fall if you need any help with some

1688
01:10:36,480 --> 01:10:40,890
thoughts or ideas on how increasing

1689
01:10:38,790 --> 01:10:44,460
management strategies contact me contact

1690
01:10:40,890 --> 01:10:47,430
your Extension agent or your NRCS and

1691
01:10:44,460 --> 01:10:51,780
they'll be glad to help you set up some

1692
01:10:47,430 --> 01:10:53,910
strategies there so with that I am gonna

1693
01:10:51,780 --> 01:10:56,040
turn it over back over to dr. Charlie

1694
01:10:53,910 --> 01:10:57,540
was he's gonna have some closing remarks

1695
01:10:56,040 --> 01:11:01,260
and then we can open it up for Question

1696
01:10:57,540 --> 01:11:03,420
and Answer all right Thank You Miranda

1697
01:11:01,260 --> 01:11:06,450
and thanks to all our presenters out

1698
01:11:03,420 --> 01:11:09,060
there we really appreciate that time

1699
01:11:06,450 --> 01:11:10,290
you've taken and our attendees out there

1700
01:11:09,060 --> 01:11:12,060
might notice that many of our

1701
01:11:10,290 --> 01:11:13,500
specialists are doing this from home and

1702
01:11:12,060 --> 01:11:15,450
so we want to thank you for the

1703
01:11:13,500 --> 01:11:18,780
opportunity to come into your homes

1704
01:11:15,450 --> 01:11:20,730
tonight and from ours to yours so this

1705
01:11:18,780 --> 01:11:23,930
is the question and answer time we have

1706
01:11:20,730 --> 01:11:26,310
a few questions as we go through these

1707
01:11:23,930 --> 01:11:28,740
if you have other questions please type

1708
01:11:26,310 --> 01:11:31,410
them in and so the first question X I'm

1709
01:11:28,740 --> 01:11:34,530
going to call on dr. stuck and the

1710
01:11:31,410 --> 01:11:35,940
question is can you feed a hyperthermic

1711
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:38,040
calf colostrum

1712
01:11:35,940 --> 01:11:40,590
I've heard that a cap won't utilize the

1713
01:11:38,040 --> 01:11:42,420
classroom until its internal body temp

1714
01:11:40,590 --> 01:11:44,910
is increased and it will just sit in a

1715
01:11:42,420 --> 01:11:48,840
cat's stomach can cause blood is this

1716
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:50,880
true yeah good question and I think when

1717
01:11:48,840 --> 01:11:52,620
we talk we were talking about the need

1718
01:11:50,880 --> 01:11:55,380
for colostrum no matter what method

1719
01:11:52,620 --> 01:11:57,030
you're warming the calf I think I did

1720
01:11:55,380 --> 01:11:59,040
say some time during that warming

1721
01:11:57,030 --> 01:12:03,300
process you need to get colostrum into

1722
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:06,090
that calf because you won't have as much

1723
01:12:03,300 --> 01:12:08,430
success with warming the calf unless

1724
01:12:06,090 --> 01:12:10,500
that calf has been granted this is warm

1725
01:12:08,430 --> 01:12:12,990
colostrum so that actually helps a

1726
01:12:10,500 --> 01:12:14,910
little bit as well so it's just it's

1727
01:12:12,990 --> 01:12:17,400
every bit as important as you're warming

1728
01:12:14,910 --> 01:12:20,070
method whether it's a hotbox or or a

1729
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:22,470
warm water bath I'm not telling you to

1730
01:12:20,070 --> 01:12:24,900
put in the colostrum before you start

1731
01:12:22,470 --> 01:12:26,370
warming the persuit process but at least

1732
01:12:24,900 --> 01:12:28,920
some time during that warming process

1733
01:12:26,370 --> 01:12:32,670
put claustrum into that calf and it'll

1734
01:12:28,920 --> 01:12:34,179
help it'll help that calf build his own

1735
01:12:32,670 --> 01:12:35,589
energy

1736
01:12:34,179 --> 01:12:40,389
in addition to what you're already

1737
01:12:35,589 --> 01:12:45,069
providing to warm that calf all right

1738
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:46,959
thanks Jerry next one I think Miranda

1739
01:12:45,069 --> 01:12:49,209
I'm going to call on you what growth

1740
01:12:46,959 --> 01:12:51,609
stage should cows be turned out and I

1741
01:12:49,209 --> 01:12:53,709
think the growth stage is with what

1742
01:12:51,609 --> 01:12:56,079
growth stage should Cosby turned out on

1743
01:12:53,709 --> 01:13:01,539
winter annual pastures such as winter

1744
01:12:56,079 --> 01:13:03,879
rye so we want to turn it out at the

1745
01:13:01,539 --> 01:13:06,729
vegetative stage I would use the same

1746
01:13:03,879 --> 01:13:09,699
rule of thumb as we do for our

1747
01:13:06,729 --> 01:13:11,919
introduced grasses like the three latest

1748
01:13:09,699 --> 01:13:15,129
age with these if you manage it

1749
01:13:11,919 --> 01:13:17,169
correctly and don't don't graze it too

1750
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:18,789
low you can actually take them off and

1751
01:13:17,169 --> 01:13:21,129
you'll get regrowth that you'll be able

1752
01:13:18,789 --> 01:13:23,829
to create again so managing the grazing

1753
01:13:21,129 --> 01:13:26,050
and one of the keys with these is a lot

1754
01:13:23,829 --> 01:13:27,489
of people are watching these pastures

1755
01:13:26,050 --> 01:13:30,819
they have a lot of other things going on

1756
01:13:27,489 --> 01:13:32,229
so getting them early enough so you can

1757
01:13:30,819 --> 01:13:34,179
get that wreath grilled because once you

1758
01:13:32,229 --> 01:13:36,069
head so you don't have that potential

1759
01:13:34,179 --> 01:13:39,629
for me girl and there's a serious

1760
01:13:36,069 --> 01:13:39,629
decline in quality too

1761
01:13:39,899 --> 01:13:48,459
alright thanks Miranda the next question

1762
01:13:42,669 --> 01:13:51,369
I have is well this is a toss-up I think

1763
01:13:48,459 --> 01:13:54,129
I'll call on dr. hoppy first but then

1764
01:13:51,369 --> 01:13:55,899
other panels can come in on that feeding

1765
01:13:54,129 --> 01:13:58,899
in late afternoon and early evening a

1766
01:13:55,899 --> 01:14:01,689
her this better for having I was told is

1767
01:13:58,899 --> 01:14:03,879
this true oh I'm not sure if it's better

1768
01:14:01,689 --> 01:14:07,059
for actually calving but if you're

1769
01:14:03,879 --> 01:14:09,010
looking for calving changing the time

1770
01:14:07,059 --> 01:14:11,319
frame which cattle calf throughout the

1771
01:14:09,010 --> 01:14:13,149
day feeding in the evening will tend the

1772
01:14:11,319 --> 01:14:15,280
delay calving until earlier in the

1773
01:14:13,149 --> 01:14:18,339
morning you'll end up having less night

1774
01:14:15,280 --> 01:14:22,359
time calvings if you're feeding late in

1775
01:14:18,339 --> 01:14:24,159
the afternoon or early evening actually

1776
01:14:22,359 --> 01:14:25,749
the opposite is true in sheep by feeding

1777
01:14:24,159 --> 01:14:27,429
them within four or five hours you'll

1778
01:14:25,749 --> 01:14:28,989
end up having more lambs to happen so

1779
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:32,019
you don't you want to get away from

1780
01:14:28,989 --> 01:14:33,429
nighttime watches and sheep be sure to

1781
01:14:32,019 --> 01:14:36,879
feed them in the morning if you want to

1782
01:14:33,429 --> 01:14:39,309
get away from nighttime calving be sure

1783
01:14:36,879 --> 01:14:41,639
to feed the cattle at night or late

1784
01:14:39,309 --> 01:14:41,639
evening

1785
01:14:41,640 --> 01:14:49,510
all right thanks Carl we're at Wow hour

1786
01:14:47,950 --> 01:14:50,500
and 15 minutes we've been at this and

1787
01:14:49,510 --> 01:14:54,250
thank you very much

1788
01:14:50,500 --> 01:14:56,440
and all those attending one last call

1789
01:14:54,250 --> 01:14:58,480
for questions I'm going to call on the

1790
01:14:56,440 --> 01:15:00,580
presenters if there's any final comments

1791
01:14:58,480 --> 01:15:03,220
that anything has come up while you

1792
01:15:00,580 --> 01:15:05,920
watch you present things that you want

1793
01:15:03,220 --> 01:15:07,960
to make a point duck otherwise if

1794
01:15:05,920 --> 01:15:10,500
there's no questions cause you're a

1795
01:15:07,960 --> 01:15:10,500
little bit antsy

1796
01:15:12,540 --> 01:15:25,180
we shared the link where you can find

1797
01:15:18,340 --> 01:15:30,130
the feed cost comes later sure Carl if

1798
01:15:25,180 --> 01:15:32,800
you what we're going to do is at the end

1799
01:15:30,130 --> 01:15:35,770
of this session and you type in an email

1800
01:15:32,800 --> 01:15:37,450
so we should be able to email you we

1801
01:15:35,770 --> 01:15:38,890
have some other supporting documents

1802
