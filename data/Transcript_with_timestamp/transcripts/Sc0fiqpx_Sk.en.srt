1
00:00:17,610 --> 00:00:24,189
water soil and Sun these make the
universe with ample water on good soil

2
00:00:24,189 --> 00:00:32,079
warmed by the Sun crops grow luxurious
lush bountiful luscious yes on this

3
00:00:32,079 --> 00:00:41,080
earth we live by water for water is life
to plants to animals to man down from

4
00:00:41,080 --> 00:00:46,090
the heavens it comes water for the land
billions upon billions of tons of it

5
00:00:46,090 --> 00:00:51,670
immeasurable oceans of water pulled by
the matchless power of the Sun lifted

6
00:00:51,670 --> 00:00:58,300
atom by atom up to the clouds again
without water crops that once gave

7
00:00:58,300 --> 00:01:06,009
promise wither in the Sun and wind water
can be the difference between life or

8
00:01:06,009 --> 00:01:11,049
death production or destruction proper
handling of rainwater and melting snows

9
00:01:11,049 --> 00:01:18,999
will prevent such damage as is evident
in the eroded pasture beyond nature's

10
00:01:18,999 --> 00:01:23,619
own way was to cover the earth with a
protective mantle of grass trees and

11
00:01:23,619 --> 00:01:30,249
other vegetation but man must till the
land to live there is no water erosion

12
00:01:30,249 --> 00:01:34,179
problem on this manure livid field if
all the land were covered with

13
00:01:34,179 --> 00:01:39,369
vegetation or were perfectly leveled or
if it absorbed rainfall readily there

14
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:45,429
would be little runoff but there are
slopes with soils that cannot drink in

15
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:50,619
dashing rain fast enough runoff carries
silt seed and fertilizers to the

16
00:01:50,619 --> 00:01:55,029
lowlands both of the fields and into the
creeks and rivers starting ugly washes

17
00:01:55,029 --> 00:01:59,880
that may someday twist or break your
equipment

18
00:02:01,340 --> 00:02:06,140
this is sheet erosion the beginning of
gullies the forerunners of eventual

19
00:02:06,140 --> 00:02:13,010
abandonment of the land this is the
result of faulty Park here maybe the

20
00:02:13,010 --> 00:02:18,260
cause rose up and down a gentle slope
encouraging runoff in heavy or long

21
00:02:18,260 --> 00:02:24,049
continued rains each little shovel mark
a channel to the sea after the deluge

22
00:02:24,049 --> 00:02:30,319
the little waters have run away taking
soil seed fertility fortunately there

23
00:02:30,319 --> 00:02:37,760
are effective defenses against runoff
damming one of the simplest is contour

24
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:45,500
farming tilling and planting across the
slope instead of up and down for the

25
00:02:45,500 --> 00:02:51,049
best view go into the skies this is
conservation farming round farming in

26
00:02:51,049 --> 00:02:54,099
square country

27
00:03:01,870 --> 00:03:06,980
contouring will prevent serious runoff
in the ordinary rain a shovel mark a

28
00:03:06,980 --> 00:03:12,380
wheel track row of grain level across
the slope hold the water until it seeps

29
00:03:12,380 --> 00:03:18,320
into the soil where the slopes are long
or steep or on land that absorbs water

30
00:03:18,320 --> 00:03:23,540
slowly contouring alone may not be
enough strip dropping another bulwark of

31
00:03:23,540 --> 00:03:29,420
soil depends can be added here you have
it feels contour strip against erosion

32
00:03:29,420 --> 00:03:31,870
that

33
00:03:40,570 --> 00:03:43,790
this is the principle working to
perfection

34
00:03:43,790 --> 00:03:48,710
each strip of field in the established
crop rotation alternating bands of small

35
00:03:48,710 --> 00:03:54,050
grain row crops and grass legume hay
fields spreads squarely across the path

36
00:03:54,050 --> 00:04:03,170
of runoff water in these fields you see
two vegetated water outlets the natural

37
00:04:03,170 --> 00:04:07,550
depressions and drainage ways paved with
grass against the gully in effect of

38
00:04:07,550 --> 00:04:15,770
excess runoff that otherwise will
inevitably occur a third line of defense

39
00:04:15,770 --> 00:04:20,060
against soil erosion is the terrace in
this field you see how effectively

40
00:04:20,060 --> 00:04:24,230
terraces trap the surplus water most
terrace systems are the so called

41
00:04:24,230 --> 00:04:28,790
drainage type each Terrace constructed
with a gentle gradient thus water caught

42
00:04:28,790 --> 00:04:33,470
in its downward race moved slowly and
safely out of the terrace and into a

43
00:04:33,470 --> 00:04:37,790
protected outlet as with the terrace
system itself the outlet should be

44
00:04:37,790 --> 00:04:41,570
designed with the help of a soil
conservationist your county agent an

45
00:04:41,570 --> 00:04:47,120
experienced farmer or anyone qualified
to do the job we have seen three of the

46
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:52,490
main mechanical defenses against erosion
with all three of them simple contouring

47
00:04:52,490 --> 00:04:58,420
strip cropping and terracing tillage is
on the contour

48
00:05:01,930 --> 00:05:06,710
railways use the contour principle
trains run as nearly on the level as

49
00:05:06,710 --> 00:05:11,750
possible contour farming is like that
on the level to lighten the load save

50
00:05:11,750 --> 00:05:16,820
fuel and time and money farming up and
down slope is about as illogical as

51
00:05:16,820 --> 00:05:20,630
running a train over the hills first up
with a hard pull

52
00:05:20,630 --> 00:05:26,800
then coasting down easy wasteful of time
and fuel and energy

53
00:05:28,290 --> 00:05:33,690
if your farm is even gently rolling the
chances are you can profitably use

54
00:05:33,690 --> 00:05:39,990
contouring strip cropping or terracing
perhaps all free but you may ask will I

55
00:05:39,990 --> 00:05:44,870
need special equipment to practice soil
conservation the answer is definitely no

56
00:05:44,870 --> 00:05:49,620
you can do it with your present
equipment but many farms that are

57
00:05:49,620 --> 00:05:55,130
adopting a conservation plan must be
conditioned for it

58
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:04,790
Gulley's like this wasteful and costly
to farm around can be filled quickly and

59
00:06:04,790 --> 00:06:09,890
inexpensively with the disk tiller or
the moldboard plow the operator cuts the

60
00:06:09,890 --> 00:06:13,580
first slice with the tiller away from
the gulley bank on successive rounds he

61
00:06:13,580 --> 00:06:17,560
sweeps the loose soil in toward the
gully

62
00:06:25,740 --> 00:06:34,230
round and round cut and sweep take a new
bite and sweep it in actually that's all

63
00:06:34,230 --> 00:06:39,030
there is to this job
however avoid driving your outfit too

64
00:06:39,030 --> 00:06:43,350
closely to ditch banks at the start but
that is not only dangerous but also

65
00:06:43,350 --> 00:06:48,210
unnecessary instead you roll the soil up
to the gully edge repeat the process

66
00:06:48,210 --> 00:06:53,250
until the soil falls into the ditch this
job can be hurried along by setting the

67
00:06:53,250 --> 00:06:57,960
tiller or plough shallow if necessary in
order to drive faster and throw the soil

68
00:06:57,960 --> 00:07:00,410
farther

69
00:07:17,009 --> 00:07:20,789
when the gully is nearly full the
operator can work his outfit in closer

70
00:07:20,789 --> 00:07:25,889
as the accident hazard is lessen whether
the gully filling job requires a round

71
00:07:25,889 --> 00:07:31,349
or two as with a small wash or a dozen
rounds or more as in this instance the

72
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:39,779
principle of earth-moving is the same in
little more than an hour's time this

73
00:07:39,779 --> 00:07:45,930
ditch was filled ready for grassing or
for cropping establishing waterways is

74
00:07:45,930 --> 00:07:49,710
one of the initial steps in a
conservation plan because terraces

75
00:07:49,710 --> 00:07:53,999
concentrate water thus giving it cutting
power outlet should be well established

76
00:07:53,999 --> 00:07:57,830
before the terraces are constructed

77
00:08:03,870 --> 00:08:08,340
the initial step in building terraces is
surveying and staking the terrace lines

78
00:08:08,340 --> 00:08:18,720
again a job for someone who has had
previous experience or training with

79
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:23,400
guide stakes set a helper leads the
operator on his first round where you

80
00:08:23,400 --> 00:08:27,330
start the cuts the order in which you
make them varies widely

81
00:08:27,330 --> 00:08:31,729
follow the approved method in your
locality

82
00:08:41,820 --> 00:08:46,690
the return trip of the first round on
the lower side of guts takes the first

83
00:08:46,690 --> 00:08:50,880
complete round establishes the island

84
00:08:53,220 --> 00:08:59,110
usually the ridge is built by moving
soil down from above and up from below

85
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:03,880
you want a farmable channel on the
upside a down slope that is equally

86
00:09:03,880 --> 00:09:11,550
adapted to the use of modern power
equipment the terrace is taking shape

87
00:09:16,130 --> 00:09:21,380
this is an earthmoving job the disk
tiller is ideally suited to it if

88
00:09:21,380 --> 00:09:25,280
operated at the proper speed on this
trip the ridge is being built by

89
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:34,010
throwing the soil up from below the
tiller gives even this loosened soil a

90
00:09:34,010 --> 00:09:38,000
noticeable throw number of rounds
necessary will vary with soil type

91
00:09:38,000 --> 00:09:42,740
steepness of slope and other conditions
it will vary with soil that's wet or dry

92
00:09:42,740 --> 00:09:51,020
Saudi or loose ordinarily 20 to 35
rounds will do the job up one side and

93
00:09:51,020 --> 00:09:55,910
back on the other around and around
until channel terrace and back slope

94
00:09:55,910 --> 00:09:59,410
meet the desired standard

95
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,800
the last wave moves up to the ridge
where the guide steaks were originally

96
00:10:11,800 --> 00:10:16,269
set now we've built a terrace having a
channel as well as upper and lower

97
00:10:16,269 --> 00:10:22,089
slopes that are tillable ears prove that
this terrace will catch hold and carry

98
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:26,259
away excess water ridge height and
channel cross-section exceed

99
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:32,259
requirements many farmers construct
terraces with the moldboard plow the

100
00:10:32,259 --> 00:10:36,759
principle is the same survey and
stakeout the terrace Ridgeline establish

101
00:10:36,759 --> 00:10:42,399
the island then move the soil in to form
the ridge speed counts here too the

102
00:10:42,399 --> 00:10:47,490
faster you move the better your plow
throws the soil

103
00:11:02,290 --> 00:11:06,850
this is terras construction as
accomplished by an experienced farmer a

104
00:11:06,850 --> 00:11:11,769
past winner of terracing contests he
knows just where and how to drive for

105
00:11:11,769 --> 00:11:15,209
best results on each round

106
00:11:20,730 --> 00:11:24,770
taking a slice on the lower side

107
00:11:33,240 --> 00:11:38,730
he loses no time on turns with modern
power equipment he lifts and lowers the

108
00:11:38,730 --> 00:11:43,860
bottoms without even looking around down
one side and up the other sweeping soil

109
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:49,980
in to make the rig any farmer can easily
learn to do this job cutting a slice on

110
00:11:49,980 --> 00:12:01,110
the outside the downslope here the plow
must throw soil uphill and back again on

111
00:12:01,110 --> 00:12:04,860
the inside
he's throwing soil down slope but upward

112
00:12:04,860 --> 00:12:08,750
against the upper slope of the terrace

113
00:12:22,970 --> 00:12:27,620
nearing the end of the job the terrace
is almost finished and ready to prepare

114
00:12:27,620 --> 00:12:30,220
for Planet

115
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:40,680
this is a terrace as built by a champion
that's what an experienced farmer can do

116
00:12:40,680 --> 00:12:51,260
with the moldboard plow unless
established terraces are painstakingly

117
00:12:51,260 --> 00:12:56,940
maintained watched constantly for minor
breaks channel water may overtop them

118
00:12:56,940 --> 00:13:01,800
wash through as it has done in this
minor break the tiller and the plow are

119
00:13:01,800 --> 00:13:10,080
good maintenance tools the return trip
on the upper side the operation here is

120
00:13:10,080 --> 00:13:14,040
maintenance plowing of the terrace
combined with normal tillage operations

121
00:13:14,040 --> 00:13:22,560
on the balance of the field the
operation shown here parallels the

122
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:26,550
original terraced construction simply
throwing soil to the ridge from above

123
00:13:26,550 --> 00:13:31,110
and below rebuilding it replacing the
soil that has worked down from the ridge

124
00:13:31,110 --> 00:13:35,430
if the terrorists area is in normal
cropping maintenance of this sort is

125
00:13:35,430 --> 00:13:38,779
usually done each year

126
00:13:42,970 --> 00:13:49,380
now the break the over top place in the
ridge is almost completely refilled

127
00:13:52,920 --> 00:13:58,060
but that loose soil will settle with the
rains the careful conservation farmer

128
00:13:58,060 --> 00:14:02,470
will watch this danger area keeping the
low spot field to prevent another

129
00:14:02,470 --> 00:14:06,790
breakthrough
Tara's maintenance plowing with the

130
00:14:06,790 --> 00:14:10,950
tiller is customary in the south also

131
00:14:15,540 --> 00:14:23,700
the job is combined with flat breaking
of the entire field common practice in

132
00:14:23,700 --> 00:14:27,810
many sections is to cut stocks into the
soil with the stock cutter and disk

133
00:14:27,810 --> 00:14:32,420
Errol this view is on southern
terrorists land

134
00:14:38,610 --> 00:14:43,679
and farmers in the deep south using
power equipment more and more find the

135
00:14:43,679 --> 00:14:50,850
better planner well adapted to the broad
base terrace the lister works equally

136
00:14:50,850 --> 00:14:55,499
well tractor and better find no
difficulty following contours or working

137
00:14:55,499 --> 00:15:06,299
over the terrace ridges even in loose
soil listing on the contour is an

138
00:15:06,299 --> 00:15:10,739
additional aid in holding water until it
seeps into the soil regardless of the

139
00:15:10,739 --> 00:15:21,420
type of planting equipment you have it
can be used on terraced land in the Corn

140
00:15:21,420 --> 00:15:26,249
Belt farmers are adopting soil saving
methods to hold their rich soil on this

141
00:15:26,249 --> 00:15:30,360
completely terraced and contoured farm
the operator plants his terraced fields

142
00:15:30,360 --> 00:15:35,489
easily with the to road drawn planter
how it works on terraces may be judged

143
00:15:35,489 --> 00:15:40,230
from the fact that the height of this
Terrace is 26 inches at least 6 inches

144
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:44,119
higher than ordinary in this territory

145
00:15:55,250 --> 00:16:00,199
cultivating corn is always a job
requiring accurate work the outfit must

146
00:16:00,199 --> 00:16:04,850
stay precisely on the roll and move the
proper amount of soil into the roll

147
00:16:04,850 --> 00:16:09,529
this modern outfit does that and does it
on the tightly curving contours and even

148
00:16:09,529 --> 00:16:13,910
on the sharply sloping terrace ridges
when you see it done you know it can be

149
00:16:13,910 --> 00:16:16,240
done

150
00:16:22,029 --> 00:16:26,410
and it gets the weeds and grass
particularly that troublesome small

151
00:16:26,410 --> 00:16:34,930
grass in the corn row in the south to
farmers do this ticklish job on sharply

152
00:16:34,930 --> 00:16:40,860
bending terraced slopes cultivating
cotton peanuts and other crops

153
00:16:45,540 --> 00:16:50,480
they do it clean fast and right

154
00:16:56,579 --> 00:17:01,930
conservation farming often means more
hay bigger harvests the hey chopper

155
00:17:01,930 --> 00:17:08,189
simplifies the hay making job saves
labor and cuts costs to the minimum

156
00:17:08,189 --> 00:17:13,809
there is no heavy pitching with an
outfit like this on the job it picks up

157
00:17:13,809 --> 00:17:18,150
all the hay around the curves and on the
slopes

158
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:26,319
remember the strip crop fields the bands
of small grain around the heels they are

159
00:17:26,319 --> 00:17:31,059
no problem to the light combine farmers
find it equally maneuverable inside

160
00:17:31,059 --> 00:17:35,500
those narrow strips or on the short
abrupt slopes of terraces where this

161
