00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:26,800
Hello everybody welcome back to the

2
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:28,320
farming simar 25 tips and tricks video

3
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:30,160
today we're continuing our Series where

4
00:00:28,320 --> 00:00:34,559
we talk about all the crops and farming

5
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:36,960
sim25 by focusing on wheat barley and

6
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:39,360
oats now we're combining all three of

7
00:00:36,960 --> 00:00:40,960
these grain crops into a single video

8
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:43,079
because they all share something in

9
00:00:40,960 --> 00:00:45,960
common that is that we can put down a

10
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,800
straw windro after harvest and then

11
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:51,760
collect that straw windro in one of

12
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,640
couple various ways and use that straw

13
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:57,120
in again multiple ways now we've learned

14
00:00:54,640 --> 00:01:00,039
through our animal videos that many of

15
00:00:57,120 --> 00:01:03,519
the various animals will accept straw as

16
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:06,320
beding and as result will produce manure

17
00:01:03,519 --> 00:01:08,240
we also know by our TMR video that we'll

18
00:01:06,320 --> 00:01:11,799
be able to use straw to make total mixed

19
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,680
rations for our cows and water buffalo

20
00:01:11,799 --> 00:01:18,040
or you can just choose to collect the

21
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:19,240
straw and sell it whichever thing fits

22
00:01:18,040 --> 00:01:22,000
your

23
00:01:19,240 --> 00:01:24,119
fancy now this video is also going to

24
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:26,479
focus on well what can you do with your

25
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:28,119
grain after you harvest it because we

26
00:01:26,479 --> 00:01:30,600
have a couple different Productions that

27
00:01:28,119 --> 00:01:33,799
we can run our grain through

28
00:01:30,600 --> 00:01:36,799
we can run our wheat barley or oats

29
00:01:33,799 --> 00:01:38,600
through the Grain Mill and produce flour

30
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:41,079
and once we produce that flour we can

31
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:44,799
take it to a secondary production in the

32
00:01:41,079 --> 00:01:48,159
bakery and produce bread or cakes with

33
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:51,000
that flour our oats can go over here to

34
00:01:48,159 --> 00:01:53,479
the cereal factory in combination with a

35
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:57,479
few other products in order to make

36
00:01:53,479 --> 00:01:59,079
cereal as a finished good in addition we

37
00:01:57,479 --> 00:02:01,560
really haven't talked about storing

38
00:01:59,079 --> 00:02:03,439
crops in any of our videos up to this

39
00:02:01,560 --> 00:02:05,079
point and for the most part that is

40
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,759
because up till this point we haven't

41
00:02:05,079 --> 00:02:10,360
been able to technically store any of

42
00:02:07,759 --> 00:02:12,720
those crops that we have done videos on

43
00:02:10,360 --> 00:02:16,200
that is about to change because we can

44
00:02:12,720 --> 00:02:19,400
store Wheat barley and oats in any

45
00:02:16,200 --> 00:02:21,720
ingame Silo so I've got placed here a

46
00:02:19,400 --> 00:02:23,599
few different samples of the silos that

47
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:27,080
are available in game we have kind of an

48
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,000
old school Brick and concrete

49
00:02:27,080 --> 00:02:35,879
variety we have more of an Americanized

50
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:38,760
concrete Silo here a more modern steel

51
00:02:35,879 --> 00:02:41,319
Silo and then we have a singular grain

52
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,959
bin and we're going to be doing a

53
00:02:41,319 --> 00:02:46,200
separate video talking about silos

54
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:49,599
specifically and demonstrating how we

55
00:02:46,200 --> 00:02:51,760
can make use of these grain bin silos

56
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:54,720
with the use of

57
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:57,080
augers now once you have harvested your

58
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,040
crop you're going to be able to collect

59
00:02:57,080 --> 00:03:01,120
the straw and in order to collect the

60
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:03,959
straw you can either use a Bor which we

61
00:03:01,120 --> 00:03:06,879
have already demonstrated in our hay and

62
00:03:03,959 --> 00:03:09,200
grass video or you can make use of a

63
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:12,440
forge wagon which is how we're going to

64
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:12,440
be collecting the straw

65
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:19,120
today in addition to harvesting our

66
00:03:15,959 --> 00:03:20,480
wheat barley and oats a single time

67
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:22,120
we're going to be coming through a

68
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:24,159
second time and harvesting the same

69
00:03:22,120 --> 00:03:28,319
field but this time we're going to use

70
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:31,439
the macdon swather from the macdon pack

71
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:35,560
because I can tell you in in my testing

72
00:03:31,439 --> 00:03:35,560
already we see a

73
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:45,560
24.9% basically 25% bonus to our output

74
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:48,560
by swapping our crop with the Macon and

75
00:03:45,560 --> 00:03:51,599
then picking that swath up with our

76
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:54,640
pickup header Again part of the macdon

77
00:03:51,599 --> 00:03:58,239
pack with our Harvester and then we're

78
00:03:54,640 --> 00:04:00,920
also seeing a bonus with respect to our

79
00:03:58,239 --> 00:04:02,239
straw that we collected off those fields

80
00:04:00,920 --> 00:04:05,560
as

81
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:08,879
well now we caveat this that the macdown

82
00:04:05,560 --> 00:04:12,480
pack is an upgrade it is an add-on bonus

83
00:04:08,879 --> 00:04:15,560
at this point a paid DLC I received the

84
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:17,919
macdown pack as a pre-order bonus as did

85
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:19,479
many that pre-ordered the game but at

86
00:04:17,919 --> 00:04:22,240
this point now that the game is out

87
00:04:19,479 --> 00:04:24,360
there is going to be a paid DLC that is

88
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:26,240
the macdown pack if you are interested

89
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:28,040
that I do have a link to that down in

90
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:29,800
the description below it is using my

91
00:04:28,040 --> 00:04:31,560
affiliate code so it wouldn't be much

92
00:04:29,800 --> 00:04:33,320
obliged if you would make use of that

93
00:04:31,560 --> 00:04:35,400
code if you go ahead and pick up that

94
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:38,000
macdown pack now that code is going to

95
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:39,880
be able to be used for PC players only

96
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:43,479
if you are a console player then by all

97
00:04:39,880 --> 00:04:47,280
means pick up the macdown pack via your

98
00:04:43,479 --> 00:04:49,360
store of your console of

99
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:52,240
choice now let's take a look at some

100
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:54,800
infog graphics now these infog Graphics

101
00:04:52,240 --> 00:04:57,280
come from the Farming Simulator Academy

102
00:04:54,800 --> 00:05:00,560
which is the tutorial site over at the

103
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:04,039
Giants website and got information here

104
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:06,840
about oats and I've run various tests

105
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:11,320
already on oat and

106
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:13,400
barley it says seeds per hectar 500 now

107
00:05:11,320 --> 00:05:17,400
on field 41 which we are using because

108
00:05:13,400 --> 00:05:21,080
it is very near one hectar in size I

109
00:05:17,400 --> 00:05:23,960
only use 329 L worth the seed here in

110
00:05:21,080 --> 00:05:26,800
Farm Sim 25 so it does appear that our

111
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:30,400
seed usage is down from what is listed

112
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:33,440
here on this infographic from FS2

113
00:05:30,400 --> 00:05:35,680
to what is accurate is the planting

114
00:05:33,440 --> 00:05:37,919
season of March and April the growing

115
00:05:35,680 --> 00:05:40,880
duration of 4 months and the Harvest

116
00:05:37,919 --> 00:05:43,080
duration of July and August those things

117
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:48,560
are accurately

118
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:51,319
reflected the yield per hectar 5700 l i

119
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:55,759
saw a yield that was

120
00:05:51,319 --> 00:06:00,800
93% bonus to this my field was prepared

121
00:05:55,759 --> 00:06:02,840
at plus 95% I saw a 93% in increase I

122
00:06:00,800 --> 00:06:06,560
actually was able to harvest

123
00:06:02,840 --> 00:06:09,759
11,043 L worth of Oats using the

124
00:06:06,560 --> 00:06:10,599
traditional cloth grain Harvester and

125
00:06:09,759 --> 00:06:12,240
the

126
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:15,639
macdon

127
00:06:12,240 --> 00:06:17,800
header more on that here in a moment as

128
00:06:15,639 --> 00:06:21,720
far as straw I was able to collect

129
00:06:17,800 --> 00:06:24,120
71,2 L worth of straw after I harvested

130
00:06:21,720 --> 00:06:26,840
with the traditional cloth

131
00:06:24,120 --> 00:06:29,080
Harvester by using the swapping method

132
00:06:26,840 --> 00:06:30,720
using the macdon and then following it

133
00:06:29,080 --> 00:06:35,960
up with the pickup header using the

134
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,960
cloth I was able to harvest

135
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:45,560
13,798 L worth of Oats that would be a

136
00:06:41,560 --> 00:06:49,080
24.9% increase over the CL Harvester the

137
00:06:45,560 --> 00:06:52,880
traditional way of harvesting or a

138
00:06:49,080 --> 00:06:55,520
242 increase over the yield per hectar

139
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:57,840
listed here in this

140
00:06:55,520 --> 00:07:01,039
infographic in addition I was able to

141
00:06:57,840 --> 00:07:03,080
harvest our straw after using the back

142
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:04,759
dawn after using the pickup header with

143
00:07:03,080 --> 00:07:09,120
the Closs

144
00:07:04,759 --> 00:07:13,840
87,3 191 l so an increase of

145
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:17,000
approximately 1,600 L of

146
00:07:13,840 --> 00:07:21,039
straw now with respect to our

147
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:25,240
barley barley again lists needing 500 L

148
00:07:21,039 --> 00:07:29,240
of seed per hectar I used

149
00:07:25,240 --> 00:07:31,000
257 basically half of that seed usage so

150
00:07:29,240 --> 00:07:34,759
again this infographic seems to be a

151
00:07:31,000 --> 00:07:36,800
little bit off for Farm Sim 25 what is

152
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:39,720
accurate is the planting season of

153
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:43,160
September in October and the Harvest

154
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:45,919
duration of June through July so it has

155
00:07:43,160 --> 00:07:48,400
a growing duration of 9 months basically

156
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:53,479
over winter and

157
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:56,120
spring yield per hectar was 9600 L well

158
00:07:53,479 --> 00:08:00,000
when I ran my Closs Harvester with the

159
00:07:56,120 --> 00:08:04,240
macdon header I saw 18,000

160
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:08,560
595 L of harvest that was again a

161
00:08:04,240 --> 00:08:11,240
93% increase over what is listed here on

162
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:13,879
this infographic and my field was listed

163
00:08:11,240 --> 00:08:16,919
as having a plus 95%

164
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:19,240
bonus after collecting the grain I went

165
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:21,159
around and collected the straw and I

166
00:08:19,240 --> 00:08:25,360
basically saw the same output that I got

167
00:08:21,159 --> 00:08:29,240
with oats at 71,0 8

168
00:08:25,360 --> 00:08:31,720
L then comes swafing with the macdon

169
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:33,399
after I SWA with the macdon I used a

170
00:08:31,720 --> 00:08:36,760
pickup header from the macdon pack with

171
00:08:33,399 --> 00:08:40,880
the CL Harvester and I received

172
00:08:36,760 --> 00:08:43,000
23,2 128 L worth of barley that again

173
00:08:40,880 --> 00:08:46,720
was a 29 or

174
00:08:43,000 --> 00:08:49,160
24.9% increase from what we had with the

175
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:52,519
traditional Harvester or a

176
00:08:49,160 --> 00:08:53,399
242 increase from what is listed here on

177
00:08:52,519 --> 00:08:56,600
this

178
00:08:53,399 --> 00:08:59,760
infographic I then collected a straw and

179
00:08:56,600 --> 00:09:03,000
I didn't see quite the increase of straw

180
00:08:59,760 --> 00:09:06,640
that I had with oats I only saw

181
00:09:03,000 --> 00:09:08,920
85587 l so a little bit of a reduction

182
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:12,279
there I'm going to call that margin of

183
00:09:08,920 --> 00:09:14,560
error because well maybe there was a

184
00:09:12,279 --> 00:09:16,640
couple things that I did wrong on that

185
00:09:14,560 --> 00:09:18,640
field and that might be a result why the

186
00:09:16,640 --> 00:09:21,839
straw was a little bit

187
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:23,240
lower now with respect to our wheat and

188
00:09:21,839 --> 00:09:25,959
I haven't done this test so we're going

189
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:28,519
to be doing this test

190
00:09:25,959 --> 00:09:31,120
together says our seeds per hectar will

191
00:09:28,519 --> 00:09:34,240
be 500 later so be interesting to see do

192
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:37,560
I do about 250 or do I do a little bit

193
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:39,920
more than that we are planning our wheat

194
00:09:37,560 --> 00:09:40,920
in September and October and then we're

195
00:09:39,920 --> 00:09:44,040
going to be able to harvest the

196
00:09:40,920 --> 00:09:46,640
following year in July or August so a

197
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:48,480
10mon growing duration and we're going

198
00:09:46,640 --> 00:09:53,480
to have an average yield of

199
00:09:48,480 --> 00:09:55,640
8,900 L per hectar so keep remembering

200
00:09:53,480 --> 00:10:00,600
that number because we will be coming

201
00:09:55,640 --> 00:10:00,600
back to that in a little bit

202
00:10:03,279 --> 00:10:08,760
now let's run

203
00:10:05,720 --> 00:10:10,920
through the vehicle shop and where we're

204
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:12,320
going to get all this stuff I apologize

205
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:14,320
I shouldn't have been standing by the

206
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:16,040
Grain Mill that was a little annoying

207
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:18,600
for me I'm sure that was annoying for

208
00:10:16,040 --> 00:10:20,160
everyone else let's take a look at our

209
00:10:18,600 --> 00:10:23,959
vehicle

210
00:10:20,160 --> 00:10:26,000
shop so with respect to our

211
00:10:23,959 --> 00:10:28,160
Harvesters we're going to come to

212
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:30,360
combine harvesting and we're going to be

213
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:35,519
able to basically use any of these

214
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:38,160
Harvesters to harvest our grain now I

215
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:40,519
have the Gold Edition because I also

216
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:43,160
happen to have pre-ordered from the

217
00:10:40,519 --> 00:10:46,160
Giants eShop and also have a collector's

218
00:10:43,160 --> 00:10:48,959
edition so that is why this appears if

219
00:10:46,160 --> 00:10:50,680
anyone has any questions for this video

220
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:52,600
we're using the

221
00:10:50,680 --> 00:10:56,200
lexion

222
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:58,399
6900 standard base

223
00:10:56,200 --> 00:11:00,240
configuration in combination with your

224
00:10:58,399 --> 00:11:02,800
combine harvester you're going to need a

225
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:05,600
grain header you can use any of these

226
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:08,079
grain headers for this particular video

227
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:12,320
I'm going to be making use of the macdon

228
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:14,320
flex Draper from the macdon pack just to

229
00:11:12,320 --> 00:11:17,360
see if there would be any sort of

230
00:11:14,320 --> 00:11:20,040
differences between the flex Draper and

231
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:22,480
any of these other headers now of course

232
00:11:20,040 --> 00:11:25,040
you can use literally any header with

233
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:28,160
any Harvester but you should note that

234
00:11:25,040 --> 00:11:30,720
these bigger headers well your pipe may

235
00:11:28,160 --> 00:11:32,639
not clear the header and if that's the

236
00:11:30,720 --> 00:11:34,720
case you're going to run into a little

237
00:11:32,639 --> 00:11:37,279
bit of difficulty in offloading your

238
00:11:34,720 --> 00:11:39,480
Harvester so what I would suggest is

239
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:41,399
coming here to a harvester figuring out

240
00:11:39,480 --> 00:11:43,839
which Harvester you want to use coming

241
00:11:41,399 --> 00:11:47,279
down here to combinations and it will

242
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,120
tell you the appropriate combinations of

243
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:51,560
headers that will work best with the

244
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:53,760
particular Harvester that you have

245
00:11:51,560 --> 00:11:56,440
selected so we can see here the listing

246
00:11:53,760 --> 00:11:58,959
of headers for this particular size

247
00:11:56,440 --> 00:12:01,760
Closs Harvester and if I come up here

248
00:11:58,959 --> 00:12:02,920
and I select a smaller gloss Harvester

249
00:12:01,760 --> 00:12:05,720
but you're going to see it is going to

250
00:12:02,920 --> 00:12:08,880
suggest a different set of headers same

251
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:10,200
can be said for the larger CLA Harvester

252
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,800
we're going to again we're going to get

253
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,720
a different set of header

254
00:12:13,800 --> 00:12:18,480
choices with respect to collecting our

255
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,399
straw well you're going to be able to

256
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:22,880
use a 4ed wagon and in this particular

257
00:12:21,399 --> 00:12:25,440
video we're going to be using the fent

258
00:12:22,880 --> 00:12:27,839
tigro 75

259
00:12:25,440 --> 00:12:32,680
vrd or you can come through with a

260
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:35,519
square Bor or r B to bail that

261
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:40,120
straw as far as seeding goes we're going

262
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:42,760
to seed our wheat barley and oats with a

263
00:12:40,120 --> 00:12:45,839
traditional Cedar and for this video I'm

264
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:48,639
going to be using lykin sultar 12 so

265
00:12:45,839 --> 00:12:50,839
back here in our shop if we scroll up to

266
00:12:48,639 --> 00:12:53,160
seeding we're going to find a category

267
00:12:50,839 --> 00:12:56,240
of Cedars and we can use any of these

268
00:12:53,160 --> 00:12:58,240
seeders to put our wheat barley or oats

269
00:12:56,240 --> 00:13:02,440
in the ground for this video we're using

270
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:06,399
the sultar 12 and we can use our seed in

271
00:13:02,440 --> 00:13:10,240
the form of a ballet pallet big bag a

272
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:12,639
big bag or a pallet of little bags the

273
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:15,600
two big bags are going to cost

274
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:18,320
$1,260 and provide you with 1,000 lers

275
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:21,000
worth of seed whereas the Pioneer pallet

276
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:23,760
of bags is going to give you 50 extra

277
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:26,760
lers worth of seed for the same cost as

278
00:13:23,760 --> 00:13:30,399
the rest you can also find your seed

279
00:13:26,760 --> 00:13:32,519
down here under objects

280
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:38,160
in big bag

281
00:13:32,519 --> 00:13:38,160
categories big bag pallet category and

282
00:13:39,560 --> 00:13:45,360
pallets with respect to our field prep I

283
00:13:42,560 --> 00:13:50,160
have already gone ahead and prepared

284
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:53,480
this field it is been plowed or does it

285
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:55,279
need plowing it has had lime applied to

286
00:13:53,480 --> 00:13:58,480
it it has actually already been

287
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,240
fertilized to 100% and it has already

288
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:05,480
been cul ated so it is right and ready

289
00:14:02,240 --> 00:14:08,399
for our seating and that is exactly what

290
00:14:05,480 --> 00:14:08,399
we are about to

291
00:14:18,519 --> 00:14:24,519
do I'm going to load this Cedar up with

292
00:14:21,160 --> 00:14:28,759
1,000 L worth the seed just to make it a

293
00:14:24,519 --> 00:14:28,759
bit easier on the math

294
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:36,240
and a lot of seater we're just going to

295
00:14:31,560 --> 00:14:39,360
pull up here alongside our big bag

296
00:14:36,240 --> 00:14:41,560
pallet and we're going to hit R to load

297
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:41,560
our

298
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:47,519
seed it looks like it has decided to

299
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:50,040
load our pallet bags as opposed to

300
00:14:47,519 --> 00:14:54,759
whatever doesn't matter so we'll start

301
00:14:50,040 --> 00:14:56,800
with 1,50 L now the game defaults us to

302
00:14:54,759 --> 00:14:58,639
wheat which is exactly what we want to

303
00:14:56,800 --> 00:15:00,880
put in the ground but if we did want to

304
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,680
change it just to Barley or oats we

305
00:15:00,880 --> 00:15:05,959
would hit Y until the respective crop

306
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:06,800
does come up just going to toggle back

307
00:15:05,959 --> 00:15:09,160
over

308
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:12,279
to

309
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:14,519
wheat we're going to address the field

310
00:15:12,279 --> 00:15:17,000
as we have seen in other videos if you

311
00:15:14,519 --> 00:15:17,000
have seen

312
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:25,000
those we going to lower our Cedar

313
00:15:22,760 --> 00:15:29,519
[Music]

314
00:15:25,000 --> 00:15:33,319
down turn it on with B

315
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,319
and Off to the Races we

316
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:40,360
go so I'm going to keep track of how

317
00:15:36,319 --> 00:15:42,839
much seed we've put to the ground and I

318
00:15:40,360 --> 00:15:45,839
will report back once we

319
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:45,839
have

320
00:15:47,800 --> 00:15:54,880
finished so we've down to 752 L wor of

321
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:59,399
seed and that means that basically we

322
00:15:54,880 --> 00:16:01,480
have used 298 L of seed because so again

323
00:15:59,399 --> 00:16:04,120
we started at

324
00:16:01,480 --> 00:16:06,959
1,50 because we grabbed the wrong pallet

325
00:16:04,120 --> 00:16:09,240
or the seed so any rate we're kind of

326
00:16:06,959 --> 00:16:14,199
we're kind of in the middle there right

327
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:18,399
where barley used less seed at 257 L oat

328
00:16:14,199 --> 00:16:20,880
used more seed at 329 L and wheat is

329
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:24,160
kind of there in the middle at 298 but

330
00:16:20,880 --> 00:16:28,480
still it is lower than the infographics

331
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:31,560
500 L per hectar as reported from the

332
00:16:28,480 --> 00:16:35,720
academy me which was built around

333
00:16:31,560 --> 00:16:38,399
fs22 now I am going to go ahead and weed

334
00:16:35,720 --> 00:16:41,000
this field with

335
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:45,680
herbicide because if we come over here

336
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:49,959
and check the field stats

337
00:16:45,680 --> 00:16:54,519
out it says we are at plus

338
00:16:49,959 --> 00:16:56,440
92% and it we have weeds

339
00:16:54,519 --> 00:17:00,480
growing so like I said I'm going to go

340
00:16:56,440 --> 00:17:04,560
ahead and spray this and and

341
00:17:00,480 --> 00:17:04,560
uh see if we can get her up to

342
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:09,559
95% it's just like magic we've moved

343
00:17:07,160 --> 00:17:13,880
into October we have our first growth of

344
00:17:09,559 --> 00:17:16,319
our wheat on the field and I think let's

345
00:17:13,880 --> 00:17:19,400
go ahead and talk about our crop

346
00:17:16,319 --> 00:17:21,199
calendar for these various crops again

347
00:17:19,400 --> 00:17:22,799
wheat as we mentioned with the

348
00:17:21,199 --> 00:17:26,000
infographic you're going to be able to

349
00:17:22,799 --> 00:17:28,439
plant it in September and October you're

350
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:31,320
going to have to wait 10 months the

351
00:17:28,439 --> 00:17:33,280
entire of Winter the entirety of spring

352
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:36,440
all the way up to July before you can

353
00:17:33,280 --> 00:17:38,919
start to harvest that wheat and you have

354
00:17:36,440 --> 00:17:41,280
until the end of August to get all the

355
00:17:38,919 --> 00:17:44,600
wheat off the ground otherwise it's

356
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:46,480
going to wilt with respect to Barley

357
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:49,160
well again we can plant that in

358
00:17:46,480 --> 00:17:51,520
September and October although Barley's

359
00:17:49,160 --> 00:17:53,120
going to be available one month sooner

360
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:56,880
and the fact we only have to wait nine

361
00:17:53,120 --> 00:18:00,960
months until June and July in order to

362
00:17:56,880 --> 00:18:05,120
get our barley off the field now the the

363
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:09,400
Speedy Gonzales of all of these crops is

364
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:11,880
oat oat you have to plant in March or

365
00:18:09,400 --> 00:18:15,559
April and then well just a few short

366
00:18:11,880 --> 00:18:17,480
months afterwards in July or August of

367
00:18:15,559 --> 00:18:21,480
the same year you're going to be able to

368
00:18:17,480 --> 00:18:23,799
get those oats off the ground so if you

369
00:18:21,480 --> 00:18:26,240
don't like waiting well then oats might

370
00:18:23,799 --> 00:18:30,360
be the crop for

371
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:35,200
you let's go ahead and move forward

372
00:18:30,360 --> 00:18:38,000
into September and we'll check on our

373
00:18:35,200 --> 00:18:40,280
crop soly me I was already in September

374
00:18:38,000 --> 00:18:42,360
so how can I fast forward to September

375
00:18:40,280 --> 00:18:44,840
it's now November and you can see we

376
00:18:42,360 --> 00:18:47,320
still have our first grow State

377
00:18:44,840 --> 00:18:50,080
basically of our

378
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:52,480
wheat let's go ahead and move on into

379
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:54,360
spring so I'll see you all back around

380
00:18:52,480 --> 00:18:57,880
the March time

381
00:18:54,360 --> 00:18:59,919
frame winter is over spring is here and

382
00:18:57,880 --> 00:19:02,640
as such are we wheat has now moved into

383
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:05,400
the second growth state so don't be

384
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:09,840
surprised if your wheat doesn't grow at

385
00:19:05,400 --> 00:19:12,559
all from November or September up till

386
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,679
March that's pretty normal it's going to

387
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:16,360
be in winter it's going to be dormant

388
00:19:14,679 --> 00:19:18,320
and now that this weather is starting to

389
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:20,120
warm up sun's out a little bit more

390
00:19:18,320 --> 00:19:23,520
longer while your wheat is going to

391
00:19:20,120 --> 00:19:25,880
start to grow like weeds thankfully

392
00:19:23,520 --> 00:19:29,400
there aren't any weeds in this

393
00:19:25,880 --> 00:19:32,320
field May is here and our crop is coming

394
00:19:29,400 --> 00:19:35,200
along quite nicely with respect to our

395
00:19:32,320 --> 00:19:37,520
wheat so just another two months and

396
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:40,640
we'll be ready to

397
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:43,720
harvest okay so July is here our wheat

398
00:19:40,640 --> 00:19:49,440
is ready to harvest and it is at this

399
00:19:43,720 --> 00:19:52,799
stage where I am going to save the game

400
00:19:49,440 --> 00:19:56,320
because I want to be able to after we

401
00:19:52,799 --> 00:19:59,320
Harvest our wheat I'm going to bring you

402
00:19:56,320 --> 00:20:02,480
back we're going to tabulate our our

403
00:19:59,320 --> 00:20:06,280
results of our wheat Harvest and our

404
00:20:02,480 --> 00:20:08,760
straw collection after that wheat

405
00:20:06,280 --> 00:20:12,919
Harvest then I'm going to load this save

406
00:20:08,760 --> 00:20:15,480
game back up exactly to this

407
00:20:12,919 --> 00:20:18,520
point and then we are going to run the

408
00:20:15,480 --> 00:20:21,600
same Harvest this time using the

409
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:25,320
macdon and then we will tabulate our

410
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,640
results and close everything out now as

411
00:20:25,320 --> 00:20:30,600
I've said I've already run the results

412
00:20:27,640 --> 00:20:34,000
for barley and I've already run the

413
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:36,480
results for oats we've already kind of

414
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:40,000
gone over those results but we will go

415
00:20:36,480 --> 00:20:44,320
over those results again after we

416
00:20:40,000 --> 00:20:47,760
tabulate our wheat results and I've done

417
00:20:44,320 --> 00:20:51,480
this exact method with the other two

418
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:55,720
crops so we're just going to repeat this

419
00:20:51,480 --> 00:20:58,720
exact method we need to switch over to

420
00:20:55,720 --> 00:20:58,720
straw

421
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:05,000
actually let's not switch over to straw

422
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:09,559
I want to I want to demonstrate

423
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:13,799
something so this is a little bit of a

424
00:21:09,559 --> 00:21:15,880
variance from what I did with our barley

425
00:21:13,799 --> 00:21:18,440
and our

426
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:22,480
oats but I do want to demonstrate

427
00:21:18,440 --> 00:21:25,600
something so our straw will be slightly

428
00:21:22,480 --> 00:21:28,000
reduced with respect to our wheat

429
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:32,120
Harvest because we are changing up our

430
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:36,120
methodology just a little bit and that

431
00:21:32,120 --> 00:21:38,240
is that I wanted to

432
00:21:36,120 --> 00:21:39,520
demonstrate that if we come here and we

433
00:21:38,240 --> 00:21:43,159
check

434
00:21:39,520 --> 00:21:43,159
our soil

435
00:21:43,480 --> 00:21:51,760
composition we can see that this area

436
00:21:47,200 --> 00:21:55,559
here which we have just scattered straw

437
00:21:51,760 --> 00:21:57,960
to the wind is listed as mulched this

438
00:21:55,559 --> 00:21:59,440
area over here which we did not get any

439
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:02,919
straw

440
00:21:59,440 --> 00:22:06,679
on is not

441
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:09,559
mulched as we now lay down

442
00:22:06,679 --> 00:22:13,120
a straw

443
00:22:09,559 --> 00:22:15,960
SWA okay we are now going to be able to

444
00:22:13,120 --> 00:22:15,960
collect our

445
00:22:18,840 --> 00:22:25,640
straw we're going to see that we are not

446
00:22:23,440 --> 00:22:27,520
leaving this field in a

447
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:30,400
mulched

448
00:22:27,520 --> 00:22:32,960
state you see that we are

449
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:36,039
basically removing the mulch State

450
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:41,000
because this field had a mulched state

451
00:22:36,039 --> 00:22:45,679
from theoretically the previous year's

452
00:22:41,000 --> 00:22:47,799
Harvest so with your wheat barley and

453
00:22:45,679 --> 00:22:52,279
oats you have a

454
00:22:47,799 --> 00:22:55,200
choice do you get straw in a wi row such

455
00:22:52,279 --> 00:22:59,480
that you can collect it and use it for

456
00:22:55,200 --> 00:23:01,679
bedding use it for TMR or or just sell

457
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:05,080
it for additional

458
00:23:01,679 --> 00:23:09,480
money or do you scatter that straw to

459
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:11,559
the wind as we demonstrated by turning

460
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:15,240
off the straw

461
00:23:11,559 --> 00:23:20,279
SWA and if you do that then you will not

462
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:25,559
be able to collect the straw instead you

463
00:23:20,279 --> 00:23:29,279
will basically be given a mulch State on

464
00:23:25,559 --> 00:23:34,559
your field so a 22% bonus

465
00:23:29,279 --> 00:23:34,559
to the next crop that you put into this

466
00:23:34,799 --> 00:23:41,679
field what you should so do is up to

467
00:23:38,520 --> 00:23:45,320
you I personally think that I would

468
00:23:41,679 --> 00:23:49,520
rather collect the straw because I have

469
00:23:45,320 --> 00:23:54,080
other uses for the straw and a 2 and

470
00:23:49,520 --> 00:23:56,600
half% yield bonus really isn't that

471
00:23:54,080 --> 00:24:00,720
attractive to me versus collecting the

472
00:23:56,600 --> 00:24:03,080
money from selling the straw and as I'm

473
00:24:00,720 --> 00:24:04,440
sure we will find out when it comes to

474
00:24:03,080 --> 00:24:09,039
using the

475
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:13,720
macdon if I can get 25% more

476
00:24:09,039 --> 00:24:17,840
crop 2 and 1 12% better

477
00:24:13,720 --> 00:24:19,919
yield maybe it offsets by a lot maybe it

478
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:22,480
doesn't matter because I also get a

479
00:24:19,919 --> 00:24:26,880
whole lot more strong and therefore I

480
00:24:22,480 --> 00:24:32,640
can collect more money or make more TMR

481
00:24:26,880 --> 00:24:35,000
or get and use more manure depending on

482
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:37,679
if we are needing to use it or

483
00:24:35,000 --> 00:24:40,120
not so let me go ahead and finish this

484
00:24:37,679 --> 00:24:44,279
and I'll report

485
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:46,320
back so our Harvest is over and we have

486
00:24:44,279 --> 00:24:50,080
collected

487
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:52,559
17,23 L for the wheat if you remember

488
00:24:50,080 --> 00:24:54,720
from our infographic it said that we

489
00:24:52,559 --> 00:24:57,960
would have

490
00:24:54,720 --> 00:25:01,840
8900 lers worth of wheat so that means

491
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:05,760
that we we have a yield of

492
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:09,840
93% over what the infographic said which

493
00:25:05,760 --> 00:25:12,279
is pretty darn close to our 95% yield

494
00:25:09,840 --> 00:25:13,960
bonus of

495
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:17,960
17,23

496
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:22,559
L now let's run through our Harvest

497
00:25:17,960 --> 00:25:24,240
totals for our barley our barley we had

498
00:25:22,559 --> 00:25:29,320
18,

499
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:31,960
595 lers worth of barley after

500
00:25:29,320 --> 00:25:35,279
Harvest so a little bit more barley than

501
00:25:31,960 --> 00:25:38,559
we had wheat and we had

502
00:25:35,279 --> 00:25:43,320
11, 43 L worth of

503
00:25:38,559 --> 00:25:47,120
Oats a decent amount less than our wheat

504
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:50,799
and barley but if we look at our prices

505
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:53,919
screen here I think we're going to

506
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:56,600
see that our barley well it's going to

507
00:25:53,919 --> 00:26:02,159
have an average high of

508
00:25:56,600 --> 00:26:06,600
$1,137 on easy at an average low of

509
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:08,600
763 with respect to our oats though an

510
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:11,799
average high of

511
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:15,840
1883 with an average low of

512
00:26:11,799 --> 00:26:16,760
1314 so our oats are more valuable than

513
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:20,880
our

514
00:26:16,760 --> 00:26:25,159
barley and then our wheat is going to be

515
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:25,159
1,90 when average low of

516
00:26:25,640 --> 00:26:33,720
832 so a little bit more

517
00:26:28,799 --> 00:26:36,120
than our barley but a fair bit less than

518
00:26:33,720 --> 00:26:40,159
our

519
00:26:36,120 --> 00:26:41,559
oats kind of holds to the overall yields

520
00:26:40,159 --> 00:26:45,840
doesn't

521
00:26:41,559 --> 00:26:48,760
it now let's go and collect our straw

522
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:53,000
now remember we scatter to the

523
00:26:48,760 --> 00:26:57,080
wind the straw on the other end of the

524
00:26:53,000 --> 00:27:00,640
field when it comes time to doing our

525
00:26:57,080 --> 00:27:01,679
swathing testing with the macdon swather

526
00:27:00,640 --> 00:27:05,799
we will

527
00:27:01,679 --> 00:27:08,039
also not collect the straw that is on

528
00:27:05,799 --> 00:27:10,679
the North part of the

529
00:27:08,039 --> 00:27:15,360
field uh simply

530
00:27:10,679 --> 00:27:18,799
to be the same as this run and that

531
00:27:15,360 --> 00:27:22,480
should basically then normalize our

532
00:27:18,799 --> 00:27:24,840
straw totals between the two

533
00:27:22,480 --> 00:27:25,760
tests but again we're going to expect

534
00:27:24,840 --> 00:27:28,799
less

535
00:27:25,760 --> 00:27:33,000
straw than we had with our are barley

536
00:27:28,799 --> 00:27:36,640
and oat numbers because I didn't scatter

537
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:39,559
this end of the field in those tests but

538
00:27:36,640 --> 00:27:42,679
more or less we're comparing our

539
00:27:39,559 --> 00:27:46,279
standard Harvest and our macdown

540
00:27:42,679 --> 00:27:50,640
swapping for the same crop as opposed to

541
00:27:46,279 --> 00:27:50,640
our straw output between the different

542
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:55,039
crops so with respect to our straw and

543
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:58,440
remember our numbers are going to be

544
00:27:55,039 --> 00:28:01,480
lower because we didn't SWA or leave a

545
00:27:58,440 --> 00:28:03,200
wind row to the other side of the field

546
00:28:01,480 --> 00:28:07,159
we collected

547
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:09,360
65,7 25 L with the straw with our

548
00:28:07,159 --> 00:28:13,440
traditional

549
00:28:09,360 --> 00:28:15,919
Harvest now we're going to load up the

550
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:20,919
save game and we're going to make use of

551
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:22,919
the macdon in order to swath the crop

552
00:28:20,919 --> 00:28:26,200
we're going to make use of the pickup

553
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:30,200
header to then pick up that swath and

554
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:32,919
separate the grain from the straw and

555
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:36,320
then we will go back and use the forage

556
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:39,559
wagon to collect the straw and then

557
00:28:36,320 --> 00:28:42,399
we'll compare the numbers we just got

558
00:28:39,559 --> 00:28:45,120
with those

559
00:28:42,399 --> 00:28:48,200
numbers okay so here we are loaded up

560
00:28:45,120 --> 00:28:50,799
with the macdon with the save game right

561
00:28:48,200 --> 00:28:53,159
where we were before and let's go ah and

562
00:28:50,799 --> 00:28:55,880
talk about the macdown pack before we

563
00:28:53,159 --> 00:28:58,519
get too far into it so under mods and

564
00:28:55,880 --> 00:29:01,480
DLCs we have the macdown Pack we the

565
00:28:58,519 --> 00:29:02,960
m1240 this is going to be the swather

566
00:29:01,480 --> 00:29:04,760
this is going to be the vehicle that

567
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:07,039
drives

568
00:29:04,760 --> 00:29:09,559
everything and we have the choice of

569
00:29:07,039 --> 00:29:13,480
different engines here we have 173

570
00:29:09,559 --> 00:29:15,919
horsepower or 262 horsepower we can

571
00:29:13,480 --> 00:29:18,640
change the tire

572
00:29:15,919 --> 00:29:21,440
types and that is pretty much

573
00:29:18,640 --> 00:29:24,200
it then we have the

574
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,080
macdon swathing

575
00:29:24,200 --> 00:29:28,559
header so we can get this with transport

576
00:29:27,080 --> 00:29:32,200
wheels or

577
00:29:28,559 --> 00:29:35,600
not and the way this can work is we can

578
00:29:32,200 --> 00:29:37,960
transport this like we would transport a

579
00:29:35,600 --> 00:29:41,080
rain header and we'd actually put the

580
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:43,399
macdon in Reverse drive to do that it's

581
00:29:41,080 --> 00:29:45,240
a pretty neat setup we then have the

582
00:29:43,399 --> 00:29:49,240
mowing head so this is what we're going

583
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:51,000
to use to mow our grass then we have the

584
00:29:49,240 --> 00:29:54,720
pickup head which is going to be used on

585
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:56,960
our standard Harvester to pick up the

586
00:29:54,720 --> 00:30:00,880
swap that we're putting down and then we

587
00:29:56,960 --> 00:30:03,080
have the fd1 40 Flex straper this is

588
00:30:00,880 --> 00:30:05,679
actually the header that we're using on

589
00:30:03,080 --> 00:30:09,600
our class Harvester so this is going to

590
00:30:05,679 --> 00:30:12,919
be a traditional grain header 12.5 m

591
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:15,440
versus the swather which is 12.2 M so

592
00:30:12,919 --> 00:30:19,080
they're very similar in working

593
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:24,080
with the swather will be able to swath

594
00:30:19,080 --> 00:30:25,600
wheat barley oat canola and soybeans so

595
00:30:24,080 --> 00:30:28,000
those are the crops that we are going to

596
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:32,039
do this test with with respect to

597
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:34,120
comparing standard Harvest to swapping

598
00:30:32,039 --> 00:30:36,720
Harvest and the way this works we're

599
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:39,120
just going to turn our header on we're

600
00:30:36,720 --> 00:30:43,279
going to drop it down and we are going

601
00:30:39,120 --> 00:30:43,279
to basically dive into the

602
00:30:44,080 --> 00:30:48,000
field we're going to use one Headland

603
00:30:46,640 --> 00:30:50,919
we're going to go ahead and set that up

604
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:54,279
so we can keep our nice line straight

605
00:30:50,919 --> 00:30:58,000
and the way this works is it cuts the

606
00:30:54,279 --> 00:31:00,519
crop and gently lays it on the header or

607
00:30:58,000 --> 00:31:01,720
belts that move it toward the middle and

608
00:31:00,519 --> 00:31:04,279
then

609
00:31:01,720 --> 00:31:07,960
the swather just

610
00:31:04,279 --> 00:31:10,559
runs over top of that and straddles it

611
00:31:07,960 --> 00:31:10,559
for the most

612
00:31:18,760 --> 00:31:23,159
part and we're going to go ahead

613
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:31,840
and make a cut on either either side of

614
00:31:28,559 --> 00:31:36,320
the field and then I just want to

615
00:31:31,840 --> 00:31:38,919
demonstrate using the CL Harvester and

616
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:40,440
the pickup header this is exactly how I

617
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:43,240
did it with the other two

618
00:31:40,440 --> 00:31:46,600
props is I did a cut off across the top

619
00:31:43,240 --> 00:31:47,760
of the field I did two cuts along the

620
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:51,760
long

621
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:53,080
sides and then I harvested the swath

622
00:31:51,760 --> 00:31:56,320
with the standard

623
00:31:53,080 --> 00:31:59,000
Harvester such that I wasn't driving

624
00:31:56,320 --> 00:32:00,600
over the crop too much when I was

625
00:31:59,000 --> 00:32:03,159
harvesting the rest of the

626
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:05,679
field then I also went ahead and canted

627
00:32:03,159 --> 00:32:10,480
that straw so again I wasn't driving

628
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:13,760
over any of that as I was harvesting the

629
00:32:10,480 --> 00:32:17,279
field so let me finish this cut and I'll

630
00:32:13,760 --> 00:32:19,360
come back with our CLA Harvester and

631
00:32:17,279 --> 00:32:23,159
demonstrate the pickup

632
00:32:19,360 --> 00:32:27,639
header so if we take a quick look at

633
00:32:23,159 --> 00:32:31,360
our wheat swath we can see that we can

634
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:35,519
actually see the wheat heads in this

635
00:32:31,360 --> 00:32:38,840
texture so the grain is still here all

636
00:32:35,519 --> 00:32:40,440
we've done is cut it and lay it down

637
00:32:38,840 --> 00:32:44,039
nice and gently on the

638
00:32:40,440 --> 00:32:48,519
field now we can come through with our

639
00:32:44,039 --> 00:32:49,880
standard rain Harvester with this custom

640
00:32:48,519 --> 00:32:52,440
pickup

641
00:32:49,880 --> 00:32:55,720
header and you'll see what this header

642
00:32:52,440 --> 00:32:56,679
does is it gently picks the crop up off

643
00:32:55,720 --> 00:33:01,159
the

644
00:32:56,679 --> 00:33:04,120
field and and then runs it through the

645
00:33:01,159 --> 00:33:07,919
Harvester and since it is being

646
00:33:04,120 --> 00:33:10,600
gentle with the crop then we are in

647
00:33:07,919 --> 00:33:14,039
essence getting more yield because we

648
00:33:10,600 --> 00:33:16,360
are losing less of the

649
00:33:14,039 --> 00:33:20,120
crop just like we did with our weed

650
00:33:16,360 --> 00:33:21,600
Harvest we scattered the Top Cut Across

651
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:25,080
the

652
00:33:21,600 --> 00:33:31,840
field and we're going to get that as

653
00:33:25,080 --> 00:33:33,799
a mulching bonus and now we are leaving

654
00:33:31,840 --> 00:33:39,559
straw

655
00:33:33,799 --> 00:33:42,440
behind and let's compare the straw

656
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:44,880
windro the heads are gone

657
00:33:42,440 --> 00:33:48,880
now we don't actually see the Grain on

658
00:33:44,880 --> 00:33:54,399
there anymore so that is our straw

659
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:54,399
windro versus our wheat swath

660
00:34:01,679 --> 00:34:05,399
all right let me go ahead and finish

661
00:34:02,799 --> 00:34:07,639
this out and I'll be back and we'll

662
00:34:05,399 --> 00:34:09,760
close this video

663
00:34:07,639 --> 00:34:12,040
out all right so let's crunch some

664
00:34:09,760 --> 00:34:13,440
numbers here we finished our weed

665
00:34:12,040 --> 00:34:18,560
Harvest I have

666
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:22,520
21, 533 l in this trailer and again this

667
00:34:18,560 --> 00:34:25,079
wheat was harvested with the macdon then

668
00:34:22,520 --> 00:34:26,760
we used the pickup header with our

669
00:34:25,079 --> 00:34:29,240
traditional Harvester to extract the

670
00:34:26,760 --> 00:34:34,320
grain from the straw then we used our

671
00:34:29,240 --> 00:34:34,320
Forge wagon to pick the straw up so

672
00:34:34,919 --> 00:34:43,560
21532 that is a

673
00:34:39,200 --> 00:34:45,919
24.9% Bas 25% increase for all intense

674
00:34:43,560 --> 00:34:49,280
purposes above and beyond the

675
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:53,800
traditional Harvest with the traditional

676
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:56,640
Macon grain header and the CL Harvester

677
00:34:53,800 --> 00:35:00,599
which again netted us

678
00:34:56,640 --> 00:35:04,960
17,23 2 L off of a field that had a plus

679
00:35:00,599 --> 00:35:09,320
95% bonus We have basically a plus 93%

680
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:17,480
bonus off of the Baseline Harvest crop

681
00:35:09,320 --> 00:35:20,480
value of 8900 L per the Giants Academy

682
00:35:17,480 --> 00:35:22,440
infographic now as far as our straw

683
00:35:20,480 --> 00:35:26,800
goes I

684
00:35:22,440 --> 00:35:31,320
collected two full loads from our fent

685
00:35:26,800 --> 00:35:36,280
our fent holds 40,500 l so that would be

686
00:35:31,320 --> 00:35:40,280
81,000 L with the straw from the field

687
00:35:36,280 --> 00:35:43,000
that again used the macdon the pickup

688
00:35:40,280 --> 00:35:47,400
header with the Harvester and then our

689
00:35:43,000 --> 00:35:49,880
Forge wagon that is a 24% increase from

690
00:35:47,400 --> 00:35:52,599
the straw that we had just off the clth

691
00:35:49,880 --> 00:35:55,319
Harvester itself at

692
00:35:52,599 --> 00:35:59,800
65325

693
00:35:55,319 --> 00:36:02,400
L if we go back now to to our

694
00:35:59,800 --> 00:36:05,000
barley remember I said our barley with

695
00:36:02,400 --> 00:36:06,560
the traditional Harvester we had

696
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:10,040
18595

697
00:36:06,560 --> 00:36:13,079
lers with our swather using the macdon

698
00:36:10,040 --> 00:36:19,839
sorry and then the pickup header we

699
00:36:13,079 --> 00:36:24,280
increased by 25% to 23,2 28 L our straw

700
00:36:19,839 --> 00:36:28,599
with the coloss Harvester 71,0 in8 L our

701
00:36:24,280 --> 00:36:31,599
straw after swapping with the macdon 85

702
00:36:28,599 --> 00:36:31,599
587

703
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:39,880
L oats our standard Harvest with our CLA

704
00:36:36,040 --> 00:36:42,200
Harvester 11,043

705
00:36:39,880 --> 00:36:47,000
L we had

706
00:36:42,200 --> 00:36:50,040
13,798 L with the macdon then the pickup

707
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:52,119
header and the Closs Harvester a

708
00:36:50,040 --> 00:36:55,359
24.9%

709
00:36:52,119 --> 00:36:58,800
bonus with respect to our straw we had

710
00:36:55,359 --> 00:37:00,079
21,26 L wor the straw

711
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:04,880
sorry

712
00:37:00,079 --> 00:37:08,280
71,2 L worth the straw with the CL

713
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:14,160
Harvester and

714
00:37:08,280 --> 00:37:16,680
87,3 191 L worth of straw after using

715
00:37:14,160 --> 00:37:19,240
the macdon a

716
00:37:16,680 --> 00:37:24,000
23%

717
00:37:19,240 --> 00:37:27,599
bonus so the straw bonus is is around

718
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:29,319
the same bonus as our Harvest although

719
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:31,960
it wasn't as

720
00:37:29,319 --> 00:37:36,560
consistent and I would attribute it not

721
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:39,240
being as consistent to that the header

722
00:37:36,560 --> 00:37:41,440
we used on

723
00:37:39,240 --> 00:37:45,880
both the

724
00:37:41,440 --> 00:37:49,359
macdon and the traditional CLA Harvester

725
00:37:45,880 --> 00:37:53,560
was just a little bit too

726
00:37:49,359 --> 00:37:56,240
narrow to get all of the field without

727
00:37:53,560 --> 00:38:00,920
having a little bit left over so there

728
00:37:56,240 --> 00:38:04,200
was this little REM Remer left over here

729
00:38:00,920 --> 00:38:04,200
in this general

730
00:38:05,240 --> 00:38:13,200
area and what I have found is the macdon

731
00:38:10,200 --> 00:38:16,160
pickup header that picks up straw

732
00:38:13,200 --> 00:38:19,599
swath does not necessarily like to pick

733
00:38:16,160 --> 00:38:24,079
up small wind RS of

734
00:38:19,599 --> 00:38:26,640
swath so we will leave a little bit here

735
00:38:24,079 --> 00:38:29,040
that couldn't be picked up if I bring

736
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:31,359
that header back over over here it

737
00:38:29,040 --> 00:38:34,440
likely isn't going to be able to pick

738
00:38:31,359 --> 00:38:37,319
up these little bits here and

739
00:38:34,440 --> 00:38:40,000
there of straw

740
00:38:37,319 --> 00:38:42,640
swath and as a result of not being a

741
00:38:40,000 --> 00:38:46,119
pick up the straw swath it couldn't pick

742
00:38:42,640 --> 00:38:47,440
up the straw in addition there was a

743
00:38:46,119 --> 00:38:50,800
couple areas

744
00:38:47,440 --> 00:38:52,720
where well we had straw that came out

745
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:55,040
late and it's over here on the other

746
00:38:52,720 --> 00:38:58,880
side of the field we couldn't pick it up

747
00:38:55,040 --> 00:39:01,319
yada yada yada so that's why I'm

748
00:38:58,880 --> 00:39:04,720
attributing a little bit more variance

749
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,599
with our straw collection over our grain

750
00:39:04,720 --> 00:39:10,640
collection but it's pretty clear that

751
00:39:07,599 --> 00:39:15,480
the macdon while in a previous video we

752
00:39:10,640 --> 00:39:19,240
saw gave no bonus to grass is giving us

753
00:39:15,480 --> 00:39:20,760
a bonus for wheat barley and oats we're

754
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:24,200
going to continue to do this test when

755
00:39:20,760 --> 00:39:27,760
we get to our canola video and our

756
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:30,520
soybean video see if we continue to see

757
00:39:27,760 --> 00:39:33,599
that 25%

758
00:39:30,520 --> 00:39:34,359
bonus now what are we going to do with

759
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:38,240
this

760
00:39:34,359 --> 00:39:41,280
graen we talked about storing it and we

761
00:39:38,240 --> 00:39:43,440
talked about being able to use it in

762
00:39:41,280 --> 00:39:45,920
production I wanted to demonstrate

763
00:39:43,440 --> 00:39:45,920
storing

764
00:39:46,280 --> 00:39:53,800
it now we know we can store the straw

765
00:39:50,599 --> 00:39:57,560
from our hay and grass video we can

766
00:39:53,800 --> 00:40:01,839
store that in the hay loft which is

767
00:39:57,560 --> 00:40:05,880
going to be found here under

768
00:40:01,839 --> 00:40:08,800
silos Hay Loft right this we can store

769
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:11,839
our straw in if we wanted to store it

770
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:13,880
loose or of course we could bail it and

771
00:40:11,839 --> 00:40:16,800
if we bailed it then we could put it in

772
00:40:13,880 --> 00:40:16,800
our bail storage

773
00:40:16,960 --> 00:40:21,440
building if we restore our grain well we

774
00:40:19,960 --> 00:40:27,240
could just come up here

775
00:40:21,440 --> 00:40:27,240
to any one of these silos

776
00:40:27,599 --> 00:40:30,599
and dump our

777
00:40:31,000 --> 00:40:36,839
grain and then we'll be able to also

778
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:40,839
bring our grain out of it if we have one

779
00:40:36,839 --> 00:40:40,839
of these single

780
00:40:40,920 --> 00:40:46,079
bins I can't the camera won't let me get

781
00:40:44,200 --> 00:40:47,319
to that if we have one of the singular

782
00:40:46,079 --> 00:40:50,800
Bend

783
00:40:47,319 --> 00:40:54,400
silos well we're going to have to

784
00:40:50,800 --> 00:40:56,359
use an augur in order to pull grain out

785
00:40:54,400 --> 00:40:59,000
of that I'm going to have a separate

786
00:40:56,359 --> 00:41:01,040
video on how to do all of that basically

787
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:03,560
we're going to come down here and we're

788
00:41:01,040 --> 00:41:07,160
going to find our

789
00:41:03,560 --> 00:41:07,160
augers under

790
00:41:08,119 --> 00:41:13,280
miscellaneous belt

791
00:41:10,200 --> 00:41:17,119
systems the Meridian will be used to

792
00:41:13,280 --> 00:41:21,000
take grain out of The Silo meanwhile the

793
00:41:17,119 --> 00:41:23,440
convey all will use to put grain

794
00:41:21,000 --> 00:41:26,040
Into The Silo but again we're going to

795
00:41:23,440 --> 00:41:29,240
have a completely separate video on that

796
00:41:26,040 --> 00:41:29,240
a little bit later

797
00:41:30,480 --> 00:41:36,079
if we look here at our

798
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:40,800
production our Grain Mill well we can

799
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:43,119
bring barley oat and wheat to our Grain

800
00:41:40,800 --> 00:41:45,119
Mill five units of wheat is going to

801
00:41:43,119 --> 00:41:47,800
make four units of

802
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,560
flour 30 units of barley is going to

803
00:41:47,800 --> 00:41:52,520
make 22 units of

804
00:41:49,560 --> 00:41:55,640
flour and 15 units of oat is going to

805
00:41:52,520 --> 00:41:58,680
make 15 units of flour so this is a one:

806
00:41:55,640 --> 00:42:01,599
one meanwhile with with our wheat and

807
00:41:58,680 --> 00:42:04,319
our barley we're putting in more grain

808
00:42:01,599 --> 00:42:07,560
then we're getting flour

809
00:42:04,319 --> 00:42:09,520
out with respect to our Cereal Factory

810
00:42:07,560 --> 00:42:13,680
well we're going to be able to

811
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:16,920
bring oats to our Cereal Factory and we

812
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:20,160
can make chocolate cereal 36 units of

813
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:23,160
corn 36 units of oat 10 units of

814
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,119
chocolate 10 units of Honey to 20 units

815
00:42:23,160 --> 00:42:27,720
of

816
00:42:24,119 --> 00:42:31,040
cereal or we can make raisin

817
00:42:27,720 --> 00:42:34,680
cereal 40 units of corn 40 units with

818
00:42:31,040 --> 00:42:38,160
the oats 10 units of raisins 10 units of

819
00:42:34,680 --> 00:42:40,559
Honey 20 units of cereal the other two

820
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:42,680
cereals are going to be exclusively for

821
00:42:40,559 --> 00:42:45,680
rice and therefore are not going to be

822
00:42:42,680 --> 00:42:48,720
able to make use of our

823
00:42:45,680 --> 00:42:51,040
oats our Bakery is going to be a down

824
00:42:48,720 --> 00:42:53,640
process with respect to our flour that

825
00:42:51,040 --> 00:42:57,680
we make and we can make bread with our

826
00:42:53,640 --> 00:43:00,359
flour 90 units of bread for 45 unit

827
00:42:57,680 --> 00:43:03,079
9 units of flour 45 units of bread

828
00:43:00,359 --> 00:43:05,440
basically two to one two units of flour

829
00:43:03,079 --> 00:43:08,000
is going to make one unit of bread or we

830
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:10,200
could use cakes and that is going to

831
00:43:08,000 --> 00:43:12,720
require a lot more ingredients but 8

832
00:43:10,200 --> 00:43:15,160
units of flour 8 units of sugar 8 units

833
00:43:12,720 --> 00:43:17,520
of milk eight units of eggs butter and

834
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:20,079
strawberries are all going to make 21

835
00:43:17,520 --> 00:43:24,119
units worth of

836
00:43:20,079 --> 00:43:27,599
cake what you should decide to do with

837
00:43:24,119 --> 00:43:33,119
respect to your grain is basically up to

838
00:43:27,599 --> 00:43:37,119
you now we can also use our wheat and

839
00:43:33,119 --> 00:43:39,680
barley with respect to our pigs so right

840
00:43:37,119 --> 00:43:40,440
there it's also going to be eligible for

841
00:43:39,680 --> 00:43:43,359
pig

842
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:47,119
food so guys I hope that has giving you

843
00:43:43,359 --> 00:43:51,440
a good idea as to what your wheat barley

844
00:43:47,119 --> 00:43:54,359
and oat is good for also how to harvest

845
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,280
how to seed and how to care for your

846
00:43:54,359 --> 00:44:00,480
wheat barley and oats or

847
00:43:58,280 --> 00:44:03,920
overall let me know down in the comments

848
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:06,200
below what do you think of our tips and

849
00:44:03,920 --> 00:44:08,720
tricks series are you looking forward to

850
00:44:06,200 --> 00:44:11,000
the next video I've got one hopefully

851
00:44:08,720 --> 00:44:13,440
scheduled every day for the remainder of

852
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:16,520
this month if you're watching it fairly

853
00:44:13,440 --> 00:44:19,200
soon after the video is dropped

854
00:44:16,520 --> 00:44:21,640
otherwise this is basically a historical

855
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:24,240
reference for anyone coming into the

856
00:44:21,640 --> 00:44:27,400
game that is not quite sure how to do

857
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:31,640
any one of these specific crops

858
00:44:27,400 --> 00:44:31,640
until next time happy

859
00:44:56,040 --> 00:45:00,040
farming for
