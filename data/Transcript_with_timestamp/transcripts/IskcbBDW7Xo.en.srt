foreign

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:16,139
it is used in diverse ways in the form

3
00:00:13,980 --> 00:00:19,680
of salads

4
00:00:16,139 --> 00:00:21,900
juices sauces ingredient for various

5
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,920
urinary preparations

6
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:26,760
Etc

7
00:00:22,920 --> 00:00:31,580
interestingly China ranks number one

8
00:00:26,760 --> 00:00:31,580
and the largest producer of tomatoes

9
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:36,559
and the next point is a tomato plant

10
00:00:34,860 --> 00:00:39,180
information

11
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:42,180
botanically called

12
00:00:39,180 --> 00:00:42,180
percicum

13
00:00:42,780 --> 00:00:48,120
tomato plants are actually wines if we

14
00:00:46,200 --> 00:00:51,059
will adequate support

15
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:53,879
they can grow up to six feet to tall

16
00:00:51,059 --> 00:00:57,300
in traditional farming in greenhouses

17
00:00:53,879 --> 00:01:01,079
they can live up to three years

18
00:00:57,300 --> 00:01:05,939
The Vines are covered with short hairs

19
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:08,180
all over and the flowers are yellow in

20
00:01:05,939 --> 00:01:08,180
color

21
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:21,020
and the next point is ideal conditions

22
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:21,020
for tomato cultivation

23
00:01:23,060 --> 00:01:30,299
it can't tolerate height right

24
00:01:26,420 --> 00:01:34,700
intensity as well as as well since it

25
00:01:30,299 --> 00:01:34,700
affects the fruit pigmentation

26
00:01:35,299 --> 00:01:41,640
our next point is the climate for a

27
00:01:38,340 --> 00:01:44,100
tomato farming being one seasoned crop

28
00:01:41,640 --> 00:01:48,680
tomato crop requires an ideal

29
00:01:44,100 --> 00:01:51,060
temperature of 21 to 30 23 degrees C

30
00:01:48,680 --> 00:01:54,420
tomatoes are highly sensitive to

31
00:01:51,060 --> 00:01:58,200
climatic changes for ideal growth and

32
00:01:54,420 --> 00:02:01,619
yield tomatoes need a diverse effect of

33
00:01:58,200 --> 00:02:03,360
climatic conditions at very every stage

34
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:06,439
of

35
00:02:03,360 --> 00:02:10,380
growth such as seed germination

36
00:02:06,439 --> 00:02:13,319
flowering fruiting Etc tomato farming

37
00:02:10,380 --> 00:02:16,800
needs a warm and food climate with

38
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:19,920
medium sunlight both heavy rainfall and

39
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:23,099
a prolonged with a dry spells affect the

40
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:27,239
growth of tomato plants

41
00:02:23,099 --> 00:02:30,780
our next wine diesel soil for tomato

42
00:02:27,239 --> 00:02:34,620
cultivation tomato needs a virus set of

43
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:37,260
climate for its growth

44
00:02:34,620 --> 00:02:41,040
diverse effect of climate for its growth

45
00:02:37,260 --> 00:02:44,760
it can grow on all types of soils from

46
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:47,819
light sandy soil to heavy creamy soil

47
00:02:44,760 --> 00:02:51,420
a well-drained soil with a depth of 15

48
00:02:47,819 --> 00:02:53,780
to 20 cm is ideal for yielding a healthy

49
00:02:51,420 --> 00:02:53,780
crop

50
00:02:54,120 --> 00:03:00,200
pH for tomato farming soil PH falling in

51
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:06,379
the range of food

52
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:10,560
6.2 6.0 to 0.0 is preferred

53
00:03:06,379 --> 00:03:13,680
along with adequate nutrient Supply can

54
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:16,879
help to Tomato crops grow better in

55
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:16,879
acidic soil

56
00:03:21,260 --> 00:03:26,879
and the next point is water requirement

57
00:03:24,180 --> 00:03:29,519
in tomato Plantation

58
00:03:26,879 --> 00:03:33,120
converters are sensitive to both excess

59
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:35,159
water as well as very little water image

60
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:38,280
is challenging tomato cultivation is

61
00:03:35,159 --> 00:03:40,620
maintained and even moisture Supply

62
00:03:38,280 --> 00:03:44,420
during summer it is necessary to

63
00:03:40,620 --> 00:03:48,959
irrigate the crop once a week while

64
00:03:44,420 --> 00:03:51,620
irrigating it once in every two weeks is

65
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:51,620
the sufficient

66
00:03:51,780 --> 00:03:56,940
care should be taken to prevent any

67
00:03:54,120 --> 00:04:00,360
drought period after a heavy

68
00:03:56,940 --> 00:04:02,040
watering goes drought followed by an

69
00:04:00,360 --> 00:04:04,980
abruptive

70
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:09,840
watering during the fruiting

71
00:04:04,980 --> 00:04:12,420
phase would cause cracking in tomatoes

72
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:14,159
our next point is a crop rotation with

73
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:18,359
the Tomato crop

74
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:20,400
tomato belongs to solanasia family it

75
00:04:18,359 --> 00:04:22,440
can't be rotated with other crops

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:26,060
belonging to the same family like potato

77
00:04:22,440 --> 00:04:26,060
tobacco bell pepper

78
00:04:26,280 --> 00:04:30,620
Etc it must be rotated with crops

79
00:04:40,979 --> 00:04:46,680
that fulfill the nitrogen content of the

80
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:49,020
soil leguminous crops are the most

81
00:04:46,680 --> 00:04:52,199
recommended for this purpose

82
00:04:49,020 --> 00:04:56,960
tomato crops are hence rotated with a

83
00:04:52,199 --> 00:04:56,960
leguminous crops like beans pulses Etc

84
00:05:00,180 --> 00:05:04,199
next point is the land preparation for

85
00:05:02,340 --> 00:05:07,560
tomato cultivation

86
00:05:04,199 --> 00:05:10,380
the field for growing tomatoes must be

87
00:05:07,560 --> 00:05:13,680
thoroughly indicated and decimated and

88
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:15,120
fragmented thorough repeated flowing it

89
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:18,960
means about

90
00:05:15,120 --> 00:05:22,020
five programs five plugins before

91
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:24,900
cultivation the step after plowing is

92
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:27,840
leaving leveling the land is level in

93
00:05:24,900 --> 00:05:30,900
the evenings and beds are prepared for

94
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:33,360
planting the tomato seeds the land must

95
00:05:30,900 --> 00:05:36,780
be sterilized after plowing

96
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:40,080
so as to destroy the disease causing

97
00:05:36,780 --> 00:05:43,560
fascism on the microbes

98
00:05:40,080 --> 00:05:45,010
they are commonly sterilized by

99
00:05:43,560 --> 00:05:47,699
solarizations

100
00:05:45,010 --> 00:05:49,919
[Music]

101
00:05:47,699 --> 00:05:51,660
and next point is the season for tomato

102
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:54,419
Plantation

103
00:05:51,660 --> 00:05:57,240
since the tomatoes are dead neutral they

104
00:05:54,419 --> 00:05:58,979
can be grown during any season in the

105
00:05:57,240 --> 00:06:01,400
southern part Circle

106
00:05:58,979 --> 00:06:04,320
in southern past

107
00:06:01,400 --> 00:06:08,060
tomatoes are transplanted in three

108
00:06:04,320 --> 00:06:08,060
Cycles December to January

109
00:06:13,100 --> 00:06:17,960
the transplantation schedule is below

110
00:06:18,180 --> 00:06:22,639
the crop next point is Krampus

111
00:06:27,240 --> 00:06:33,120
February months Jade season it

112
00:06:30,660 --> 00:06:35,880
transplanted during September and

113
00:06:33,120 --> 00:06:38,220
October months in the Southern Plains

114
00:06:35,880 --> 00:06:39,960
only if adequate irrigation facilities

115
00:06:38,220 --> 00:06:44,539
are available

116
00:06:39,960 --> 00:06:44,539
similarly in the northern

117
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:52,440
plants in the Northern Plains a Ravi

118
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:55,100
crop may not be taken since they may get

119
00:06:52,440 --> 00:06:58,460
affected

120
00:06:55,100 --> 00:06:58,460
during winter

121
00:07:00,199 --> 00:07:06,300
seeds these seeds the seeds are first

122
00:07:03,900 --> 00:07:07,680
raised in the nurseries and then

123
00:07:06,300 --> 00:07:11,600
transplanted

124
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:16,199
after a period of 30 to 40 days 45 days

125
00:07:11,600 --> 00:07:19,440
hybrid and exodico varieties are sown in

126
00:07:16,199 --> 00:07:22,860
small plastic cups while other varieties

127
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:26,699
that are not too closely to produce are

128
00:07:22,860 --> 00:07:28,440
soon in a nursery beds especially for

129
00:07:26,699 --> 00:07:30,860
the purpose

130
00:07:28,440 --> 00:07:33,900
next point is transplantation

131
00:07:30,860 --> 00:07:37,080
transplantation is done in Shallow

132
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:40,319
furrows or flat beds as per the

133
00:07:37,080 --> 00:07:42,979
irrigation availability during the

134
00:07:40,319 --> 00:07:46,740
monsoon and in case of heavy soils

135
00:07:42,979 --> 00:07:48,000
seedlings are planted in brine in dry it

136
00:07:46,740 --> 00:07:51,720
in bridges

137
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:55,440
so that the water doesn't get robbed in

138
00:07:51,720 --> 00:07:58,520
case of hybrids and in the determinative

139
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,800
varieties seedlings must be stacked

140
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:05,280
using bamboo sticks if planted in

141
00:08:01,800 --> 00:08:08,699
furrows then they are planted at a

142
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:11,699
spacing of a 30 cm from each other

143
00:08:08,699 --> 00:08:16,800
for spring summer crop the spacing

144
00:08:11,699 --> 00:08:19,500
maintained is 75 to 45 cm and 75 to 60

145
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:22,500
cm for ottoman winter crop

146
00:08:19,500 --> 00:08:25,020
and the next point is harvesting from

147
00:08:22,500 --> 00:08:27,599
tomato Plantation Tomatoes can be

148
00:08:25,020 --> 00:08:29,520
harvested within two to three months of

149
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,700
Plantation depending on the market you

150
00:08:29,520 --> 00:08:34,440
demand

151
00:08:31,700 --> 00:08:37,500
harvesting of tomato is done on a yearly

152
00:08:34,440 --> 00:08:40,800
basis the average tomato crop yield for

153
00:08:37,500 --> 00:08:45,060
actually India is about 10 tons although

154
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:48,300
the yield varies from 15 to 20 tons per

155
00:08:45,060 --> 00:08:50,519
acre in case of irrigated crops

156
00:08:48,300 --> 00:08:52,860
this is the information regarding the

157
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:55,560
Tomato Farm which is having very good

158
00:08:52,860 --> 00:08:58,940
demand in the world

159
00:08:55,560 --> 00:08:58,940
for commercial choices

160
00:08:59,459 --> 00:09:03,899
and

161
00:09:01,580 --> 00:09:06,680
vegetable work in the vegetable market

162
00:09:03,899 --> 00:09:10,920
also this is the main source of

163
00:09:06,680 --> 00:09:11,899
cooking pot tomato he is having very

164
00:09:10,920 --> 00:09:15,779
much

165
00:09:11,899 --> 00:09:18,980
so it is also a profitable problem but

166
00:09:15,779 --> 00:09:21,420
only one thing is marketing areas also

167
00:09:18,980 --> 00:09:24,060
Farmers you should find out

168
00:09:21,420 --> 00:09:27,120
according to the marketing areas they

169
00:09:24,060 --> 00:09:29,459
should Supply in time frequently

170
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:32,580
then only it will be successful only

171
00:09:29,459 --> 00:09:34,620
lots of tomatoes are coming unders

172
00:09:32,580 --> 00:09:37,320
there's no Market means they will lost

173
00:09:34,620 --> 00:09:40,440
so much so periodical supply has to be

174
00:09:37,320 --> 00:09:43,140
there to the market units so marketing

175
00:09:40,440 --> 00:09:46,980
strategies are most important and where

176
00:09:43,140 --> 00:09:48,720
to supply when to supply and how we can

177
00:09:46,980 --> 00:09:51,360
collect their money all these things

178
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,760
also we should think common then only it

179
00:09:51,360 --> 00:09:57,620
will be a successful successful business

180
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:57,620
because production will be there

181
00:09:57,920 --> 00:10:03,899
we should catch the demand also in the

182
00:10:00,660 --> 00:10:05,880
same way that is also most important so

183
00:10:03,899 --> 00:10:08,399
Communications are most important in

184
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:10,920
this manner to Farmer to Farmer and

185
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,860
farmer to dealer and supplier and

186
00:10:10,920 --> 00:10:15,959
distributor and all these so if you

187
00:10:13,860 --> 00:10:18,300
maintain all these things you will be

188
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:21,740
successful in this awareness wishing you

189
00:10:18,300 --> 00:10:21,740
all the way all the rest
