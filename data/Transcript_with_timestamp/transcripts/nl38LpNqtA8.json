  "text": "[Music] When you say you're feeling lonely. [Music] All right, here we go guys. Another day. Welcome everybody. Welcome. Welcome. If you're watching video on demand, skip through about 4 minutes. We will be started very shortly with farmer's life. [Music] Everything looks like it's working. Oh, that's a good start. That's a good start. Excellent. Scrapn, how you doing, buddy? Always good to see you, my friend. Love having you here. Hope you're having a great day. All right, everything is working today. Everything's going [Music] well, right? That's good to see. Well, I better get this game started cuz I'm pretty sure my character's going to fall asleep. [Music] logged in the other day to send a screenshot to somebody and I've got that black screen again. Oh, cool. Blime me. At least we know what it is now. It's just my character falling asleep standing up. I can understand that. [Music] Yep. He's asleep. I I knew it. I'll wait for him to wake up this time instead of starting with a black screen like we did last time. Come on, wake up. There we go. Right, let's hold that. Now, we need chats. We want that one. We want that one. Let's try text to speech. See if we get that one working today. I need to add those. I'm going to try and get to that this week. I do not have any of the blurps working in here. Was it a blurp? I think it was. Um, I need to go back to installing that software. We've been testing for a couple of weeks now. We know everything else is working. I think what I'll do is I'll go back to running my source clone this week. source plane will bring all that [Music] back. Yeah, unfortunately we had issues. So, I switched extra stuff off and never added that one back. All right, let's jump into this, shall we? Hello and welcome to today's live stream. I'm Glenn Bixley and we are back with more Farmers Life. Welcome everybody. So, first thing we'll do as I always do, we take a bit of a look around just to see where we are. Okay, so the still is still running. Get it? Still still. Oh, okay. I'll come down. Uh, next bottle. 2 hours 45. Got 27 hours on the clock. There's Dez. How you been, my friend? Good to have you here, Dez. Thank you, buddy. I don't know if I say it enough, but you're a great moderator. and I do appreciate you. Uh, blueberry mash will be ready in 11 minutes. Okay, 11 minutes. We got 28:00. So, we're all right there. We're all right there. Okay. Now, for anyone that might be new, welcome. This is This is our farm in the dark. Let's switch our lights on. There we go. So, in the last couple of weeks, what we've done is we have built a pigsty recently. We've built all new sheds. You'll get to see them better in the daylight. Uh we do have all these new sheds built, which we can have a look at shortly. We have a new chicken coupe. We have a new entrance way and a new mushroom farm. And we have 30 hours on those potatoes. Right. So, let's go to bed and wake up in the morning and let's get this day started. What was our temperature, by the way? We're coming into winter, I think. 18\u00b0. Yes, it's getting a little cold. Okay, okay. All right. So, yes, let's go to bed. We shall wake up. 10 hours sleep sounds pretty good. I think cuz we're coming into winter. No, let's go with a 10hour sleep. We'll do some longer sleeps in winter, I think. Let's actually see how that sets us anyway for stamina. Oh, I've never noticed that. So, even the night takes a little longer. Okay. While you're sleeping. Okay, we do have full stamina. Excellent. Yeah, everything's a little slower now. We changed our clock speed or at least our game speed last week and I am now playing with reduced speed. We're at 0.1 speed which I am finding a lot more relaxing and enjoyable. Really love the slower speed. Uh let's grab Oops, wrong button. I keep forgetting. You can't do that. Uh, let's drag you over and we'll grab eight is more than enough. We only need like two. Probably three. Oh, there you go. I wasn't far off. All right. Next bottle is what? 1 hour 42. Okay. And we still have mash. So, let's throw that back in there. We have six bottles of moonshine to sell. Beautiful. Why am I holding on to some mash? cuz I just took that off the stove clean. All right, I think what we should do today is buy some more distilleries. Now, I've had a few people criticize that I only have one still. And considering I brew in real life, I do agree. One still, it's just still not enough. Uh, let's Oops, not the lights. No, not the lights. The door thingy. Right. Thank you. Let's have a quick drink of some water. We'll go check on our animals. Make sure they're all good. We'll grab some food as we go and do our rounds. Actually, let's just cuz this is so much more organized now. Let's do our rounds properly. We need a pitchfork. We need a brush. Oh, we need our coffee. Oh, we've actually got some in there. Actually, we'll leave some in the tool shed. I think that's probably a good idea. All right. All right. This is so much more organized. Look at that. We can go straight from there to there. 116 food. Oh, that might be a little too much. Oh, no. We can carry more now. I forgot I also turned up the carry capacity so I wouldn't have to spend so much time running back and forth all the time cuz that can be a little boring to watch as a live stream. We've got the pretty good idea on how the base game runs now with time as well as Oops. The cat is still missing. Yes. Um with time and everything else. We pretty much got that sus now. Can you move? Cuz I want to get that food without getting you. All right. Um we'll clean this place up before I brush them. I think this is much nicer with fewer picks. I should clean up the dung. I did. So now we've got a few less pigs or fewer fewer. Yeah, we got less pigs and there's a lot more space in here. Hey Fluffy, this is certainly a lot easier to get around. The only thing is we're going to want some of this done for our fields in spring. Hopefully there'll be enough. All right, let's clean these guys up. Actually, if I put that on two and I put the pitchfork on one, that'll make it easier. Right now, we can just hot pee these. So, well, yes, we'll just feed the animals. We'll clean up the place a little bit. There's a bit done I missed. And then we'll figure out what we got to do. So, we are coming up towards winter now. I have one small potato crop. Other than that, we're pretty much just getting ready for what's going to be my longest winter. And I say that because of the slower time, but it may mean all these jobs that I keep saying I will do in winter are finally going to be able to get done. So, this enclosure here, the pigs die, was one I've been trying to do for about 3 years in game in game years, I mean, and never actually managed to get it done until last winter. So much nicer. I think we'll keep all the trees and everything in here. I kind of like those for the pig sty. That's right. This is a small gate, isn't it? I keep forgetting about that one. Uh, our berries all along the back of the house. We got some wood there. All right, so we got to clean up a little bit this winter. Do we brush sheep? We do. I stepped on dung. Damn it. Oh, well, we better clean that up first. All right, we'll give the give the ladies a haircut. Uh, not a haircut. Sorry. Give him a brush. We'll clean up all this dung. Hey, Mumu. How are you? Oh, this is so much better with less animals. You don't step in it everywhere you go. My shoes wreak. I didn't step in it, did I? Oh, man. Now my shoes are going to stick all day. It's so much easier to clean up when you got less animals. I think what I need to do as part of our new organization this winter will be to make separate areas for each animal. So, this will be for the cows. At the moment, the sheep are in here. Oh, I need another bin back here, don't I? I do. No, we got this one. We got the original one. I forgot about it. Right. That's the very first one. Right. Why are you sleeping in the dung pile? Recovering after giving birth 1 month. Okay, you will live for 15. So, we might sell you this year. Well, maybe it wasn't you. Maybe it was a rat. Uh, fatness pregnant seven month not have get back here and I'm brushing you. Lamb chops. I remember watching lamb chops when I was a kid. Was that not the lamb chops you me? We could make lamb chops. We certainly could. Hey, get back here. Right, you're done. All right. I love lamb. Lamb is my favorite meat. I have to say I eat a lot of chicken, but that's cuz it's cheap. When I was a kid, lamb used to be cheap. Some of you have probably heard that New Zealand's in the country with more sheep than people. That's true, but we need more sheep in this country. We used to have more and now there's not enough. Lamb is so expensive here. Used to be a really cheap meal. All right, let's uh actually we're going to need we're going to need probably a bin in here. Let's do that now to keep a milking bucket. That's not what you meant to press. Cuz I would like a milking bucket here. A chest. Big chests, aren't they? So, we might build this this winter just to make sure that we have stuff for the cows. Oh, tree needs material. I keep forgetting in this game you have to have materials to lay down a blueprint. Um, that's all right. We'll get to it. Okay, you can cancel the blueprint now. Thank you. We'll get to that. So, that'll be something we'll do during this winter as well. Right. Let's throw some food in [Music] here. Excellent. Shut that. Actually, that's right. I left the other side open in case chickens decide to come in here. Now, we've got no animals in here at the moment. All right. Do we brush the dog in this game? I've never thought about it. Let's try brushing the dog. Oh, you're 100% clean. Still have not seen the cat. No, no idea where the cat's gone, but there is food in the cat's bowl, so that's not an excuse. Maybe we could try finding the cat today, cuz we did find some animals last week. amazed at the amount of animals we found with slower time period. Is there a bucket in here? We could use this one instead of the shed bucket. Oh, I want that. And we'll give that to the pigs. We'll give that to the pigs. So, they have a second food bowl. All right. Uh, wrong button. inventory. If I bring the tractor through that way, let's actually just pop it over here. Make it nice and easy when they're side by side. There we go. Plenty of food for the pigs. No excuse for them to not fatten up this season. Cuz last year they got a bit skinny. When we sold them, they were all very skinny. I'm going to keep the brush. I was about to get rid of it, but let's see. Oh, yeah. Okay. Stupid idea. I was about to say, let's see if we can brush a chicken or a duck. How you going to catch it, Glenn? Right. Now that we've got a lot of food trays in here, we should end up with more chickens and ducks this year as well. Now, in this game, you do not need to worry about the eggs you take from the nests. They don't prevent the chickens from breeding. You can take them all. When I first started, I was leaving eggs behind cuz I wanted the chickens to breed. And then it didn't seem to make any difference. So, I Googled. And according to the developers on Steam, it says you don't need to worry about it. Some of those uh Steam forums are pretty good and you need help. All right, go check our mushrooms. I think our mushrooms are going to need another day or so. But we do have chicken. I'm going to brush. I'd watch out if I was you. I think I actually managed to brush that chicken. I heard the noise. All right. Why are you not There we go. Okay. So, yeah, we got a couple of days. We are going to run out of manure. We're going to need more animals just for the manure. Interesting. Unless we start buying poo. What's the best place to click? I've been clicking hack, but I don't think Oh, maybe it is. I say I don't think it is, but I don't know cuz see when you click these they highlight. Oh no, it did work. I must have just missed before. Oh well, we're all good. Yeah, they have a day to go. We have another day on the potatoes. 19 hours. All right, let's put our tools away. So, our sheds that we have, this is our new repair shed. We can actually repair our items. I wonder if a brush ever needs repairs. Do brushes ever need repairs? I had never thought about it before. I've never actually repaired. I don't know how to repair this. Ah, that won't make sense. What about this? I don't know how to repair it. Is that cuz it's not broken? All right. We have our new sewing shed. Last week, we made a whole lot of new clothes. So, we made a night gown for when we get married. And we also made was it not bear fur? No. We also made which set was it? Welcome Michelle. How are you? Red set. Oh, we might need to get a red set. We need three wool and raspberry. Oh, we can actually make that. I might make some more cloves today. I want to see a few more of the clothing items. Um, nothing you can actually do in here. This is the sharing shed, but you don't actually need it. So long as you've got a sharing shed and you've got clippers, you can share your sheep. I don't know who you're going to share them with, but it's always nice to share, isn't it? All right, let's pop those away. Pop the rest of this food away. Oh, okay. Is that all the food we have? I might have to think about that. We're going through a lot of food right now. Okay. So, what do we have in the dugout? Okay. Is that cooked fish? Fried fish. Well, fried fish does not need to be in the dugout. It won't go rotten. I don't know if these go rotten. That's an interesting one. We might have to try that this year. I think I did last season, actually. I think I did last season. Um, I think they did go wrong. Oh, sorry. I'm thinking what is that game noise? It's not actually a game noise. It's sitting outside. All right. Put our fish away. We don't really need that. We'll put our eggs away for now. We're not going to the shop right now. Okay. Yes. Welcome everybody. I hope everybody is having a brilliant day. And if you're new to the channel, thank you for uh joining us. I hope you subscribe because we've got a very friendly community and I am so happy to have every one of you here. Uh let's do some more cooked ham. Requires a stove burning. That generally tends to be a thing. So yes, thank you everybody whether you be a subscriber, channel member. I definitely appreciate every last one of you. I don't say it enough. All right, we'll throw the ham on. An hour and a half. We got plenty of time. I've got to better make sure it doesn't burn. But because we're not actually moving time so fast now, I should be all right with that. Actually, we could go sell all of this and our eggs. What are we at? 22. Wait. Let's grab our eggs and anything else we have to sell. I'm going to sell these because we can't use three. We need four. And you can't plant them. Excuse me. can't plant them. So, I think if we take that I haven't milked the cows yet. I got to milk the cows before I go. What is that? That's our sourdough. True. That's something I need to try in real life. Making sourdough. I've never made sourdough. Thanks for the dono. Oh, $2. Thank you, script mech. Appreciate it, mate. Thank you. Can we sell Mark? We would never do that. You know better than that. Why would you do that? Where would we be without people like you and Mark? I mean, I appreciate all of you guys. We'd never sell you. Okay, we do actually have a lot of broth I could sell. Now, somebody was asking the other day on the Discord how to make broth. And in all honesty, I don't remember how I made that. But the answer from the developers looked a lot more complicated than I thought. Apparently getting the recipe is a bit of trial and error. Bit of experimentation. What are you doing the wiggle for? I haven't got him on leash by chance, have I? So apparently there's a bit of experimentation. We're getting the right brute. What is your problem? Come here. I don't know what his problem is. I can't even get him out of the door. All right, that's a load of bull. Never mind. Let's milk the cows. What? What' that say? Everything works just fine, but there's no milk yet. What's your problem? Fatness 96%. Pregnant 3 months. Oh, we might have to wait for her to give birth. Let's Let's put you out in the field for the day. Oh, we got two from that one. We're going to let you out for the day as well. Come on, ladies. Come and enjoy the day. You didn't get a brush though. That's probably not good. We'll get to you guys later or ladies actually cuz you're both at 95%. Come over here where the food is. That hell got out. I just noticed. What happened to your friend? Did I not have her on the lead? I do. Okay. She's having issues. Okay, we're having a couple of issues today. That's all right. At least now we're not in such a rush. Little issues like that used to stress me out a bit because with the time flow Oh, you're right there. What are you trying to do with the time flow? It made it really frustrating cuz you'd spend 5 10 minutes trying to sort them out. Not such a problem now that time is slow. We'll ignore them. We'll move on. All right. So, that's all of our little jobs done. Where should I put this bucket? Cuz I really need the bucket for milking the cows. What did I just see? Oh, the dog. All right. So, let's I think we should go and buy ourselves a new still. Get another one going. And then what we could probably do is use the stills to make more income. Okay, so we have Okay, let's put the milk away. I'm not selling my milk. We use that for making butter. We're probably better off to sell the butter, but at the moment, all my butter's been getting used for cooking cuz we're doing a lot of cooking in game at the moment. Okay. All right. All right. We're good. Everything's good. See you guys. An hour and 16 minutes. I Oh, the last king of retail. I thought you meaning there's another one. What is it? Retail. The first one was really good. Oh, it's King of Retail. Yeah. Oh, sorry. Okay. I misread. Yes. King of Retail 2. It's actually out. Is it? That looks Well, I don't know about King of Retail, too, but I saw that the other day. Where's my bike? And King of Retail looked like a really cool game. I don't know where my bike is. Oh, well, how's anybody going to say on your bike if we don't know where it is? Did I leave it in town or is it over here? Are you saying no to the potatoes, dog? You don't have to eat them. Maybe my bike's over here. Oh, there's a goose in the shed. Here's my bike. All right. Hey, you guys can s your bike. Oh, too late. I'm already on it. Let's have a look in this shed and see what's here. Let's just see what's here. I'm curious to know. No, that's the wrong one for this game. It's E. Oops. Oh, so we do have more food. I was thinking I'm sure we have more food. Yeah, we do. We do. I'll sort that out when we get back or at least in winter. something. All right. So, things found by Telka. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. That was last week. All right. All the pigs are home now. Okay. Keep getting off on the wrong side of the bike. Our trailer's here, too. Maybe we can take that home. [Music] All right, you'll buy the [Music] eggs. Oops. Where's Henry? Has he just not spawned in? Where is Henry? Usually Henry the drunk is standing in the middle of town and trying to pick a fight for no reason. Uh, actually, we don't need to go to everybody, Glenn. We just need to go to the ones that you have goods for. No Costa. Nope. We haven't got to her yet. We'll get to her in a sec. Right. We'll sell that to you cuz we're going to have to go sell the rest of our eggs to the no cost lady. Um, you'll buy that. You'll buy these. Oh, we should have used these pelts. Oh, there wasn't enough. I want to make some money today. Well, what about making pelts in winter? We can go hunting in winter. Oh, why am I trying to sell that to you? Can we pet the doggy? I want to pet the dog. Can I pet that dog? Oh, sorry. Oh, here is here. Henry's here. Um, I don't know where Henry got to, but he's here now. Are you not going to buy my beets? You are going to buy my beets. I just didn't try. You have already sold out on eggs. Yeah, they only sell so much of a certain produce. So, if you've got too much, they will not buy it. You need to take it to the state farm. So, what we might do is grab our trailer today cuz apparently I left it here for whatever reason last week. Well, that sent it flying. Okay, let's try this again. Not sure why that didn't connect. Can you stay standing? Oh, said stay standing. No. What am I doing wrong? Attach. Thank you. Right. So, we get this trailer home. Then I think we should go buy a new still. How much money did we have? Two grand. That's enough. I'm pretty sure that's enough. Matt, it's fast travel home. 1 minute. All right, detach that. Um, whoops. Stuck, stuck, stuck. Right. So, now another thing discussed on the Discord for any of you who are from the Farmers Life Discord. I did say I have most of the equipment cuz somebody was wondering about equipment. So, of course, this is your original tractor. It's generally found over that way somewhere. I think next to here. You need to put it together using the wrench. So if you when you start, you'll have a wrench, pretty sure. Otherwise, you can go and purchase one. When you walk up to the tractor with the wrench, it will then tell you what parts are required to fix it. I have the trailer. One of the most important things you'll need. We have the lawn mower. We have a tiller cuz somebody was suggesting that the game needs a tiller. Uh sorry, a a plow. So this is our three row plow. There is also a single row plow I believe as well. But this is the three row. Then you've got the digger. So that is what we use to dig out our potatoes and other vegetables. Then we have our manure spreader. What a load of that is. Uh sorry I had to. Um and then of course our cedar. Probably the most important of all of our vehicles is the cedar. And I forgot we had tobacco in the ground. 32 hours. Excellent. All right. So, that is most of the equipment. There may be a few other items that I haven't as yet got to, but that is the bulk of it. Okay. So, we're going to head down now to the state farm and go sell the rest of our eggs. I don't know why I always turn around. Oh, that was the other two pieces of equipment we purchased. Well, we had one for a while. We have the threshers. So, these are the big thresher, which you put your grain crops into. It will give you wheat or other grains, but it also gives you straw for feeding your animals. And then down here, don't run that way, goose. I'm scaring you. Like we have the small threshes which we put some of our hay into and and then of course we get our foder as well as we get straw from that. Right. Let's fast travel. Is it an? I don't think it is an but oh wait I shouldn't have done that. Okay let's let's go and see. I'm pretty sure it's not Anne. I think I've come to the wrong person, but I was meant to go all the way into town first anyway. How you doing, Anne? So, yeah. No, Anne does not sell the stills. I didn't think so. Okay. I think that's Thaddius's wife. Pretty sure that's Thaddius's wife. But we need to go sell the rest of these eggs. There we go. No Costa. All right. Check the board. Check our prices. So, we are here to sell eggs. So, you can see all your prices for everything on here basically. No eggs though cuz eggs is not a crop. Glenn, you can't grow eggs. What are you crazy? Yeah. Okay. Okay. So, it is only it's only crops that you grow. Okay. All right. Mimi sprry. Mimi sprry. Exactly. Yeah. Buy some eggs off me, love. 500 bucks. Nice. That gives us 2 six. Excellent. Right. Two six should be more than enough to buy us still. Pretty sure that's Thaddius's wife. Let's go visit the wife. Fadius isn't important to us right now. How you doing? Helen, that's your name. Okay, so a distillery. They are 1,120 each, so we can afford two. Freaking awesome. All right. All right. All right. Tobacco, but not tobacco seed. 68. We might be able to make some money. buying tobacco, rolling cigarettes, which I really hate doing cuz it's such a thing that my brain doesn't work with. That's something we might try this winter. Actually, we've only got 400 bucks left. Okay, let's try that. I'm going to see if we can take $400 worth of tobacco and make money out of it. And if you want to buy any com of your tractor parts, anything you need to assemble your tractors, this uh nice fine young man here will sell you your bicycle, your trailers, your motor for your equipment, all your tools, including the wrench that you need to fix the tractor, and then of course your tractor parts and a saw bench. So any of your tractor parts that you need to assemble your tractor, they're all right here. Um, yeah, cuz I know somebody on the Discord was having a bit of trouble trying to figure out how to get their tractor running. So, there's where you get all your parts. That's what you need. Let's head back home with our two new stills. Now, we might end up finding Oh, you're going to stand now. Like we might end up finding that we don't have enough room in this kitchen. Actually, I have an idea. Disassemble the table. We don't need that anymore. We're going to get new furniture this season, too. I want to get all new furniture this season. Uh we're just going to pop that there. Look at this rag. A rug. I was going to call it a rag. It looks like a bit of a rag, doesn't it? God blow me. Uh, I actually think what we could do is we rotate this cabinet. Now, do I have to put it down or can I put it? No, that's what I thought. Put it down first. We'll make this our brewing kitchen. I mean, um, is it the stall in the way? Is the rug in the way? Cancel. Only. Whoops, wrong button. Uh, can't remember how to rotate in this game. This is our stool for rolling our tobacco. Pop that down there. Can I move a still while it's still running? Oh, sorry. Um. Oh, I can. Don't know if that was a good idea or a bad idea, but we did it. And then what we can do, pop you out of the way for now. Um, actually I can pop you back here because that's now moved. But I want to be able to see out my window. So, let's grab this. Grab you out of the way. Oh, there's another thermometer here. Well, I've never even noticed this. Let's just pop it up there for now. I'm going to rearrange the room to make us a little bit more space. There's still room. Right. Silent protagonist thing. I got it laughed and I turned it off not knowing what it did. And now that he's back to moaning again, I kind of missed it. I kind of like listening to him moan. I don't know why. It's going a bit further, I think. Hard up against the wall. That's what we want. All right. I used Oh, I was going to say thought it was working for a sec. What happened to the wood? Did we lose the wood when I picked it up? We lost everything when I picked it up. All right. I should have left it alone. Should have waited, but never mind. What's done is done. Oh, that's what I believe. What about that cupboard when I picked up that cupboard? Oh, that still has a stuff in it. That still has stuff in it. And that still has stuff in it. Okay, so we didn't lose all of that at least. That's good. What I might do, though, is I'm going to pack up these cupboards, cuz we don't use them. We don't need them. And I want to make a bit more space in this kitchen for the brute. Uh, it's all one covered. I'm pretty sure this is I've never pulled this one apart. Let's disassemble. It's all one covered. I thought it was right. Just going to get this stuff out of here for now. And this will just give us a bit more space in the kitchen. That's fine. Why are you off to one side? That is really awkward. Okay. And now we've got enough space for one more still. We still have space for a still. Something like that. That plate up. All right. I think I like that. Much better. Much better. We can put another cabinet down here, actually. All right. So, we have 24 minutes left on the ham. Okay. Excellent. Yeah. When I took picked this up, we lost everything. We lost the wood. We lost the water. That's a real shame. And we also lost the mash and any else that was in it. I don't think there was any brew cuz we actually picked that up. Okay, we need another bucket as well. There's a few things I want to get on top of this winter. Now that we got more time, we're going to be able to do that. Excuse me. I'm just a little um disappointed we lost all of that wood. There was quite a bit of wood in that distillery, but never mind. Oh, saved. Okay. No, the stills. So, what we're going to do, let's get all these stills ready to go. We can get all three of them started now. And we'll use the money from these to get another one. Actually, you know what I should have done? I should have taken the booze that we had in that cupboard and sold that to get another one. We still could. I think the actually the lady that sells us the stills will buy our booze. All right. Yeah, it's a pity we lost at wood. That would not be good. Uh, so where do we have wood? I'm just going to check. I'm pretty confident there's nothing in here. I think there might be some in here for repairs. 14. It's not a lot. It's not a lot. We're going to take it. We're going to have to find some more. We might have to go out this winter and just find wood. Oh, we are going to have to get more wood. Okay. Is that going to be enough wood to at least get the three stills running? We go. Five. Five. Let's just try that for now while I've still got some. So, blueberry mash, not raspberry mash. Ah, stink. I want to do an apple mash. Actually, we got three stills. We could do apple mash in one start. Oh, this one's having trouble starting. Here we go. Okay, 3 hours. Give it another bit of wood. Okay, we have enough wood to do that. Excellent. We'll do potato mash in here. Yeah, I had a lot of wood in there. I lost. Never mind. That's life. Okay. We're going to need to get some more wood. the mash back. And we've got empty jars. They can go. Oh, might put some jars in here for now. I think what we should do sell this booze. Now I have flowers. What am I? Oh, flowers could go over here in the cupboard with the flowers on it. There's yeast in here. I must have run out of space and put yeast in there. I didn't know it was in there. We need to put that in the other cupboard. Just going to stick all of this in here for now. More yeast. We could do more bread then. All right. Uh let's pop this down somewhere. Right here will do. and we'll pop you down. Right, that might light up our kitchen a little bit. Now, I'm going to do the cigarettes later cuz I don't want to confuse the money from the brew. Let's go sell this brew. Actually, I'm just going to leave this bucket in here. Tobacco. We have more tobacco than I thought. 27 tobacco. Okay, we'll get to that shortly. Should I? No, let's just do it all in one go. Actually, I'm not going to do what I thought. I'm going to leave that till later. What we're going to do, let's roll some cigarettes. Now, I have a bit of issues with this. So, you put down your paper and your tobacco. Then you get the dot has to stay inside the bike bar, but my brain always looks at it differently. And I used to try and keep the white bar to keep up with the red dot, which is completely wrong. You got to keep the red dot inside the white bar. Jeez, I've got more right today so far. Doing well. Nope. We're definitely not lost. So, we'll go sell all this booze. We'll sell these cigarettes. We'll go and get ourselves another still. And then we're going to have to find some more wood. Now, cigarettes can be used to bribe or make friends. Are you bribing people or are you making friends? You need them anyway to bring up the level of friendship between you and some of the traders. Some people will like cigarettes. Oh, that's what we needed cigarettes for today. We needed to bribe somebody. Sorry, not bribe. It's probably the wrong word. Excuse me for a sec. I'm going to take my jacket off. Caught my throat. It's croaky today. Get my jacket off. Starting to warm up now. Sun's out. It's winter, so I've got my window uh my curtains open, letting the sunlight in. During summer, I tend to keep my curtains closed. Keep the house cooler. But yeah, I forgot we need these cigarettes in order to make friends with somebody. I don't recall who it was, though. really can't recall who we needed the cigarettes for. We might have to go around and visit everybody. Oops. Screwed that one up. Let's do it again. But I do remember last week we went to try and trade with somebody. It makes no sense to start without any tobacco. Yeah, you're right. It does. We went to trade with somebody last week, but we did not have a high enough friendship level. So, we need to sort that out today. Okay. So, that'll be ready in 7 minutes. So, we'll have to sort that out before we go anywhere. Oh, it would have been this one. Next spot already. said one of the bottles was ready. I swear it said a bottle was ready. I don't know. But we're going to run out of wood real soon. All right. I think what I might do very quickly is we'll just go and look for some wood. We are going to need it. already picked it all up out here. Now I can probably cut these logs into firewood. It's not really a good use for Oh, that's um not really the best use. This is what we really need. Sticks. Um take it all. It's not much. It's not much. Yeah. We'll very quickly go over here into the trees, get some wood so we can get those stills running. I have to wait seven minutes anyway for the ham to be cooked. Quite full. And we need to do these while we're out. only sticks out in the trees is not the best way to get away. Oh, there's berry picking to do. All right. Well, that's what we're going to do then. We're going to get berries. We're going to get mushrooms. And we're going to get sticks. We'll kill eight birds with one rock or whatever that expression is. Yeah, I hope you guys are enjoying this game. I am. I'm thoroughly enjoying it. It's a great little game and the developers are listening to feedback. So, if you do have the game and you'd like to make suggestions, okay, there's no sticks in here. You got suggestions or ideas, the developers are listening. They have a big list apparently of things they want to do. Give me a second. I need to clear my throat. All right. I don't know why I'm so croaky today. Don't know why I'm so croaky. Don't really like to cough or clear my throat when the mic's on. I try to mute it. All right. Yeah, we'll get some sticks. We'll get some berries. We'll get some uh mushrooms. And then I think we need at least one more still to finish that kitchen. We might get more more of them later. But for now, the big problem is going to be keeping enough wood to keep them all burning. So, there's no point me going out and buying 12 stills and then only be able to afford to run a couple cuz of wood. That makes no sense at all. That would make no sense. It's still a bad idea. Oh, okay. I'll stop with the puns. They're not punny. There's two. We definitely need to come back and do a bit more of this today, actually. Oh, where's the hit box? Stop being awkward. Thank you, silly little stick. We should have brought the rifle as well so we could do some hunting. Come back in a minute. All right, we'll get those hams off the stove. We're going to need to cut all this firewood this winter. We'll use this for building next season. Another question that somebody had asked on this Discord was in regards to making money out of selling wood from growing trees. I wouldn't know because I've put all my wood so far into building. Right, there's another four hams on. Hour and 25 hour and 30. Perfect. We're not going to burn that lot, are we? Um, I'll throw my berries in the cupboard. So, we're going to make mash out of those probably. Uh, we want to put the sticks into them stills. I'm just going to put these tools in here for now just to get rid of them. We're going to leave the cigarettes cuz we don't need to be carrying them. And we'll come back to that bottle of booas later. Oh, setting this one. I'll get the order of those right soon. All right. So, how are we doing? You have three, you have two, and you have one. Okay. Let's give you I didn't really do math very well at school. 10 for you. That's 11. Give you half roughly. I'll give you half roughly. Okay, they all have around about 10 each. Excellent. Now, how much time do they have though? Burning for 4 and 1/2 hours. We're good. And 10 sticks. Seven uh 7 hours. 10 sticks. Yep. 7 hours and 11. Yep. We're good. We're good. Okay. Actually, what I'd like to do before we take off again. Is it raspberry mash? Don't need all of that. And wool. Do I have any more wool? I think we have some out in the shed out side. I hope we do. Otherwise, we might try and share some sheep. I don't know how often you can share sheep in this game. In real life, you only share them once a year. We do have wool. Okay, some wool, some string. And why not? We might actually try shearing some more sheep. See if we can do it again. In theory, I shouldn't be able to. No harm in trying, though. Right. Now, I wanted to try the red set. Raspberry mash. Is it? That's what we have. Raspberries. Oh, Glenn. Yes. It's not mash. It's raspberries. We need to make the mash. Oh, fine. Be like that. Did we have raspberry mash? No. No. Blueberry mash. Okay. There's a difference. There is. We'll get to that later. for now. Throw all of this back in here. Let's go try shearing some sheep. Oops. I'm just going to drop it in there. We got plenty of space in there right now. I don't think we can, but it be interesting to see. The sheep are not in here. That's pigs. They look similar, but they're not the same. Right. I don't think this should work. Can we shear them every m every day? We can shear the sheep every day. We're going to end up with a lot of wool. You have to have a sharing shed. You haven't got a sharing shed. Don't worry, pal. I'm not going to try shearing you. Right. Let's try fixing you cuz the fact that you're broken is kind of bothering me. You're not going to move, are you? Is it? I haven't done the math on that. Let's fix this cow. Now, one thing that the developers said to me, if you have any issues with any of the animals getting stuck, put them on the lead and fast travel them to the entrance uh to your gate. And so far, that rule has worked cuz yeah, I was having a few issues with occasionally the animals do get a bit stuck in their path, but that was the advice from the developers. stick him on a um lead and then just fast travel to the gate. Right. Uh actually, we'll keep the wool on us cuz we put the other wool inside. No, I won't empty out my inventory. Got other jobs to do. Glenn, let's head back. We'll do some more berry picking. Actually, if we take a bicycle and at least ride it up to the tree line. That'll just hopefully get us here a little quicker. I don't know if it actually does or not. Um, where should we start? I think up here in this corner. We can always find the bike next to this tree. Yeah, exactly. All right. So, we'll get some more berries, sticks, mushrooms. Let's look at the map for a sec. We're heading up to Thaddius. That's where we're actually going. Oh, but I didn't bring I didn't bring the booze with me. Doesn't matter. I have it. Thank you. All right. Yeah, it's actually really nice to have the time to just come out and do this cuz I have not had time to get out and pick up sticks and Oh, I didn't bring the rifle. That's your fault, Dez. You didn't remind me. And speaking of reminding, I need to bring my chat back up. Put it down when I'm muted cuz I always like to make sure that it unmutes with the mic I've got doesn't actually have a light on it. So, you can't tell if I've muted or unmuted. And I like to visually check. All right. Oh, pardon. Well, this should keep our STS running for a day. We'll make a whole lot of mash. And then I think next season if we've got four stills or maybe five. I'm actually thinking five is a really good round number. Oh, we're getting a bit of freezing. We got five stills. The amount of booze that we'll be able to make in a day, we should be better make some pretty good money. And now that we've got the better chicken coupe, our chickens will start to well chickens and ducks now will start to breed. And we should get a few more of them. In the past, they were kind of struggling to get enough food between all of them, and they weren't breeding very well. I am kind of keen to see how much wood we would get if we cut up a log. But at the moment, I don't know if it's going to be worth doing. I probably want to start growing some trees. I wonder I've not growing any trees in this game. Should we try growing a tree? Is it a tree, not an ice cream? Told you I should have brought the rifle. Need to remember that when you go out from now on when we go out berry picking. We've also got to get sticks, mushrooms, take the rifle, and then what we need is little areas where we can just dump everything on the edge of the forest. Empty our inventory out. near a road somewhere. See, like this would be a perfect spot. It's next to Thaddius's farm. It's really easy to remember where it is. And if we drop this stuff on the edge of the road, it's really easy to find. So, that's what we might have to start doing in future. I want to know if we can sell clothing this winter as well. Who would we sell clothing to? I'm guessing it would be the shop in town, the general store. No mushrooms here. Oh, there's some. Yeah, I'm definitely preferring this more relaxed speed. I like this. Oh, it's a fox. I was thinking, was that one of my sheep? No, it's a fox. A white fox. I bet you we could make a really cool piece of clothing out of a white fox. Isn't it terrible when Glenn now looks at animals and thinks clothing, food? Yeah, there's animals that look at us that think food, too. Bet lions in Africa look at people and think food. There's more mushrooms that went past. All right. Who's that? Oh, it's a stick. So, we probably didn't get you there. Now, I've remapped my farmer's vision to my middle mouse button. I think it started out as Z, but I was having issues with that cuz I had to keep looking at my keyboard. So, I've remapped it. I still have the Z. I think it's C. Yeah, it is. Yep. But I don't tend to use it. Middle mouse button is a lot more convenient. Some of these sticks I'm picking up twice. Not going to complain. We're getting on 42. When I first started, this is how I made all my money. I've had people on the Discord asking what's the best way to make money. I don't know. I haven't figured that out yet, but this is a really good convenient way to get started. Oh, it's a deer. I was thinking, is that one of my sheep? Why do I keep thinking everything's my sheep? I don't know about Rich, but hey, we do all right, I think, considering this is how we started the game and we were struggling to make any money. Now, when we have a harvest, go out, spend good amounts of money. I think we're doing all right in the game. Character is not any younger. We definitely need to get him married off soon. Now, I don't know what the story is with as far as I know your character can die of old age. I'm guessing it's probably around 65 years of age. I'm guessing, but I don't know. Oh, three. However, what we do need to figure out is what happens when he does die. Can you leave him an air to carry on? Now, this game has a before and an after. So, you've got the farmer's father, which although it came out after this game, is set before it. You're actually playing the part of our father. Now, I've looked at that one in the past. At the time, it needed more work, but I do think we could go back and have another look at that at some point. being the same developers. Hopefully, they've made improvements to it and it could be worth trying again. But then there is another one which the developers are working on which is set after this one and that's going to be Cyber Farmer. I have no idea what it's like cuz it's still in development, but that might be one that I'd like to try as well. a robot farmer. Yeah, I think something along those lines. It seems a bit weird, but I like this game. And as part of the story line, I think it could be worth just at least the very least taking a look. Is that a tree or a nice? Um, definitely worth at least taking a look to see what it's going to be like. Yes, I should have brought my rifle. Never mind. Okay. Thought I saw mushrooms there. Nope. Right. I didn't actually bring anything on me, but how much cigarette? I never thought about it. So, oh, I thought she had a sale price on here as well. A buy and a sell price. No, we can buy them for 101, but I don't know what the sale price is. I would have to have some on me. Okay. No costa. None at all. What is that one? Cider. Oh, we're making cider now. Okay. So, cider, raspberry, blueberry, vodka, moonshine. Okay. And it still is, 1100. It's still,00. Hasn't changed, right? Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Yep. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Uh-huh. Okay. See, even an apple tree is something we need, cuz apples can be used to feed the animals, too. Maybe an apple tree would have been something good early game. I don't know. But for now, let's head back. We got some sticks finally. We'll go check on whatever's cooking. Where's our bike? have a quick drink. How you getting on? 10, 10, and 11. Okay, so they're actually still good. They're still good. Oh, sorry. What I might do for now is we're just going to stick that in there. It won't take it. Oh, we're not going to take it. Nope, we're not going to take it. What about this one? No, that won't take it either. Ah, can we put sticks in here? Brilliant. All right, let's empty out our inventory. So, we could go sell these berries. Let's actually see what we end up with. 31 mushrooms. 40 and 152. A lot of raspberry. We really do. I mean, if I sold the raspberry, not chocolates, they're worth five each, I think. So, that's only 500 if I sold them. It's not enough for a still. Okay, it's still not enough for a still. Oh, we do have this. That can't be right. Five. Is that the sale price? That can't be right. Let's try. Let's sell that. And I am going to take take those cuz we have way more than we can deal with right now. So, let's take a 100. We'll go and sell that. I'm actually thinking let's just sell the meat. Let's Okay, here I go. Let's sell the meat. But let's take the meat gathering device. That could be a good way of going, I think. And if we're going to go out and sell, let's get rid of these two. Okay, 40 and 52. That sounds fair. I think we'll keep that. All right, we have 12 yeast. Let's Oh, I'm too heavy. Way too heavy. Put something back. Actually, actually, hang on. Rather than put something back. Well, what we'll do is we'll drop the coffees. We'll drop our buns. 158. I'm just thinking if we get on the bike, we can get on the bike. I don't think it takes us any additional time cuz we're on the bike. Weight doesn't matter when you're on the bike. Let's just let's just let's just grab the bite. Bring the bite. to the berries. Sure, there's an old proverb there somewhere. Bring the bike to the berries. Pretty sure it'll still only take us about 15 minutes to get to the farm. Yeah, cuz we're on a bike, the weight doesn't matter. Or does it? We seem to be biking really slow. Stop. Okay. By God, blink and blow me. It didn't stop. Me my spry. Me my spry. Exactly. Yeah. Buy these off us, love. 2,100. Now we're talking. All right. Does this guy buy our meat? I'm pretty sure he does. I don't normally sell meat to this guy. I usually sell meat to the one in the town, but pretty sure. Beautiful. Beautiful. All right. So, what does that give us now? 2,600. It's enough there for another couple of stills, mate. Why are we going backwards? All right. No trial. There you go. Five. Nice. What is this? Raspberry mash. Oh, true. Okay. Well, we want your last still. Right. I might even buy another bucket. $112. No. No. Let's prioritize. I want I think we're going to go up and visit Ann or at least go to Ann's farm and won't be here. She's in the town. What trees do you have? Oh, you don't have any trees. I thought she had some sort of tree here, like an apple or something. Apparently not. Do you sell buckets for the same price? I think yours are dera. Okay, so all the trees must come from the forestry. Gentlemen, I I actually thought this lady had the apple trees. I'm You don't sell trees. He does. Okay. So, we have popppler, which I've heard is very popular these days, and birds. I don't know another tree as charming as this one. Not only does it have its snow white bark, but in autumn the leaves take on beautiful colors. Yes, these are lots there are lots of growing around, but lots of them get turned into fences, sheds, and outouses. So, we might run out of these one day. Okay. Yes, there are lots. Hang on. The description on fur and popular is the same. Okay. So, let's take one of those. One of those. And we can't afford that. 756. We're $45 short. Man, that just sucks like a raspberry. All right. 45 freaking dollars. Okay, I want to start growing some trees. Now, we paid 750 for those. I think I might plant them right here. Can I plant them this time of year? Maybe we might have to wait till spring. And I'll need to ho the ground. Okay. I don't know. Do we wait till spring or do we take a chance? Take a chance on me. Oh, sorry. I think Oh, the tools aren't in here anymore. Glenn, you moved them. I think what I'm going to do is I'm going to try planting them. I think if I get them in the ground now, it'll be fine. If it's not, we've just wasted 1,500 bucks. We need a ho ho ho. Merry Christmas. We need that. Yeah, we're coming into winter. Coming into winter. All right. So, what do I think? Actually, no. Cuz we have this line of trees here. Um I put in a popler here. 375 hours. Interesting. Actually, this ground's already been hoed. Need to cut down the voltage. Okay. All right. For now, we're going to try one of each tree. There we go. 375 for a fur, 375 for a popler. They're the same. Okay. Interesting. I've got a little bit of grass on me. I'm just going to go and give it to the cows. Not enough space. All right. At least then it's not wasted, right? It's about the gate over here. You look like you're longing for somebody else's farm. [Laughter] Cal 375 hours to grow trees. Man, that's a long time. All right. What I think we should do is go out hunting. Get us some meat. Cuz now that we've got better control over the time, hunting is going to be a lot easier to do. Still, that's what I was thinking. Cuz in the past, going out hunting could take a lot of time. We'll leave some sticks in there. What? Oh, yep. Um, grab a bucket of water. That's all smoky in this house. Has somebody been smoking in here? We're definitely going to have to put more water into these stills, but it's enough to get us started for now. We now have five stills. I guess it doesn't really make any difference which one I use, actually. Oh, no. Cuz it'll take ages anyway. I was going to say we could do the raspberry mash now, but no, we got to cook that. All right, that's off and going. Keep the mash. Oops, this one's mashed clean. All right. Um, take these off. I sold all my meat. So, let's do some mash. We wanted a raspberry mash. Can I do a raspberry mash? Raspberry mash. Must obtained a recipe. Yeah, it's why we're not doing it. We might have to buy it. We may need to buy it. Okay, in that case, let's do blueberry. Do they all take the same length of time? I wonder. Um, they should. Did I click the wrong thing? Cook. We did blueberry. Don't have any apple. Oat mash. We could do that one too to do our vodka. We got no potatoes. Okay, so there is only one mash I can do today. Oh no, I'm out of sugar. Oh man, sugar. So now that's going to be a problem, too. We're going to have to go and buy some sugar. Okay. Right. Exactly. That's exactly right. We need sugar. So, we only have 700 bucks. Sugar. Can you get $700? Not a lot. I bet you, you know, I don't know about you guys, I like sugar. I like things that are bad for me. I am actually thinking the farm might be the best place. Let's see what it's going to cost us. Rather than buying sugar, let's see what the beets will cost. Mimi Bry. Mimi Bry. Exactly. So, the beats the beats are 14 [Music] each. How many can we buy? 50. All right. Sold. I probably should have hung on to those other ones before, but we only had three and you need four. That's fine. Head back home. What's that chicken doing in my potato patch? And then what we might do is go out and do some more berry picking cuz there's not a lot we can do other than building fences and things. And I think if we go out berry picking could be a damn good idea just to get us some extra cash coming in. Right. Cook sugar from beets. Yeah. Four water. Oh, and six beets. I thought it was four. That's why I said before we didn't have enough. Okay, we'll get some sugar going. Sugar takes 5 hours 42. The blueberry mash is about the same. Let's throw some more wood in there. About 6 hours. 558. Beautiful. Yep. All right, we're going to go hunting, berry picking. I could go fishing. I don't know. Don't know. Aussiey's playing out of ore again. Yeah, I think we'll we'll head up around the outside. We'll do some more berry picking and if we see any animals this time, we'll hunt them. We'll leave our bike here cuz it's junk. Sort this out while we're at it. Oh, this is already done. Oh, yes, yes, yes, yes. I recall there's something in that mountain and we need to get that out. Right. Let's grab our rifle. Actually, let's hotkey the rifle for slot five. Is this thing loaded? Yes. So, sticks, berries, animals, mushrooms. This should make us a few green. Bambi running away. Yeah, definitely getting close to winter now. All the rain starting to set in. Winter will be a good time to do our building. We must have already been in here berry picking. Yeah. All these berry bushes are harvested. Yep. We've already been in here apparently. Must have been last time I played. Be more sticks in this forestry area. Berry bush is right here. What? Oh, in the rock face. That's a cool place for a berry bush to be growing. Sorry, just having a quick sip of my coffee. All right, there's another berry bush in the [Laughter] cliff. What am I stuck on? You're not complaining. and hunt Call of the Wild again. Haven't played that for a few weeks, have I? We might have to go on a community hunt again sometime soon. It's been a we while. What about some of you new community members? Have you do you play Hunter Call of the Wild? We used to go on a bit of a community hunt together. Haven't been on one for a while. Nice relaxing game like this is now. Nice and relaxing. Good bit of fun going out hunting every so often. Come here. Freaking egg. No animals out here in the open. kind of hoping I might see something out here in the open. I was hoping to find something in the open. Okay. Um, typical. I bring him a gun and we're not seeing any damn thing to shoot now. We're going to have more than enough berries to do mash. I mean, one bottle of mash. What is it? 3 and 1/2 hours in game. Well, to brew. It's actually 4 and a half in real life. So at that rate, you're only getting few bottles a day. Anyhow, so the 50 odd that we have should be plenty. We might be able to sell more of them quite frankly. Oh, looking at the wrong tree. They're both looking red. Ah, now found you. Found this earlier, but I couldn't remember where we found it. Hell, this is a quest that we're on at the moment, but um we might have to bring a spanner to it. Oh, nope. It's ours. It's already ours. So, first gear has no fuel. Okay, if that's the case, let's Oh, I just hit the damn tree. Oh, Gen, what did you hit the tree for? All right. Um, can we push? No, I can't push. Can I use my physical body to push? I shouldn't hit the damn tree, should I? We were coasting downhill until I did that. Come on, get off the tree. Come back with some fuel. No, we'll come back with fuel cuz I'm just wasting time otherwise. All right, where exactly are we? We're just behind the sawmill next to the river. Who do you and I bring? Okay, we're right behind the buildings. We should be able to easy find that. We'll get some gas. We'll come back. Grab our motorcycle. We're not lost. We just found a motorcycle. So, I did find that earlier, as I say, but we couldn't do anything with it. Only. Now, one of the quests that I did recently, he told me about the bike out in the bush or we discussed it. I can't remember quite how it came about, but during that quest when I completed it, I was told we can have the bike. So, that's our new transport. Bet it'll be better than a bicycle. Reload. Yeah, we just got to get some gas. I couldn't remember where it was. And one of the things I had in the back of my mind was, let's try and find the motorcycle while we're out here. Fall over you stupid pig. Damn pig. Stop running. Why is this pig running away from a man with a gun? That makes no sense. Why would a pig ever run away from a man with a gun? Silly damn pig. You know how many berries we probably missed cuz of you? All over. Thank you. Okay. Right. Let's pick you up. Where are we going to take you to? Oh, we're a long way from a road. Free range bacon. Definitely freerange bacon is yum. Nobody's ever had wild pork. There's a huge difference in taste. Any wild animal though, there's a big difference in taste. When I used to breed my own chickens, cuz they were truly free range. Even though I eat a lot of chicken and I love chicken. When I had my freerange chickens, the flavor to them was so strong that I actually didn't like a roast chicken. I actually had to do other things with them. So, I made chicken soup or chicken pie or something else because the taste was so much stronger. I kind of want to go and get that. Oh, there's another pig. Kind of want to go and get that gas now. Don't run from me, pig. Oh, then the deer ran too. Trying to get a head shot, but it's not easy. Not when they stand side on to you. Damn pig. Stop running. I wonder if we can stick a trailer on the motorcycle. I know we can stick Fluffy on the motorcycle and take Fluffy for a ride. We might have to do that just for a bit of fun. Grab Fluffy and stick him on the motorcycle in the side car of the motorcycle. I know you can do that cuz I've seen the picture of it. screaming. I bet you that's what that pig was thinking while I was chasing after him with a gun. Crazy man with a gun. Run. So, what have we got? Two pigs so far. I think we'll be all right when we sell these berries. Sell that meat. I think I'm just going to sell the meat and the skins and everything for now. rather than make clothes or any cooking. I think we just want some fast cash so we can get ready for next spring. So that those two trees we planted 365 hours or whatever it said. I'm guessing that's an entire year. I'm guessing it's one year. I would be very keen to know what sort of money we can make out of them cuz forestry should in theory be a relatively good income. You only have some luck. I tell you what, we need to figure out what the best money-making crop is. Cuz I mean, somebody asked me on the Discord and it's not for that reason, but if we can figure out what the best money-making crop is, start really making some money. I do have to laugh cuz with the farmlands this good, it seems very much that the developers are quite happy to sit back and let the community just help each other. And it seems at the moment everybody seems to think, even though it's a lie, it's incorrect. Well, it's not a lie. It's an incorrect assumption. They all seem to think I'm a professor and I know everything about this game. Far from it. Yeah, I've been asking answering a few questions on the Discord and trying to help other people get problems solved that I've had. I would prefer questions came on the video. So guys, if any of you from the Discord rather than asking me questions on the Discord, ask me questions on the video cuz that helps to promote the video in the algorithm. YouTube considers it interaction and leaving a comment on a video always helps a lot to promote that video. So, if any of you ever feel like coming in and leaving a comment on a video afterwards, I'd appreciate it. And I answer all the questions, all the comments, whether it be a question or just a comment. It helps to promote the video in the algorithm. And most people don't leave any comments on my videos. I don't know why. Maybe they think I don't need comments. I'm not sure. But it does help. rightly in the algorithm. I know one of our community members, Oddball, always actually asks people to go and leave comments after the videos, but yeah, look at that. I don't know how successful he is with that. All I know is it makes a huge difference. If you guys want to leave comments after the video in the comment section, I'd appreciate it and I'll definitely respond to them. Where are we? Okay, let's take that carcass to the nearest road. Where was it? Right there. So, the nearest road is that one. Yes. One shot straight through the head. Now he's dead. That was a good shot. Even if I do say so myself. We'll come back with a trailer for collect all of these up later. Who was that other one? Don't run, pig. What's wrong with him? What's wrong with him? He seemed broken. Right, we'll pick you up. Get you off the track. What you with that one? There's a fox. We're doing all right with the hunt now. Missed. Let's get a bit closer. Don't be rude. Trying to shoot you. That's just being rude. Trying to run away. Have some manners, Fox. Lay down. I'll try and get as many as I can along this roadway cuz then it means we can just turn up later with the tractor, pick them all up at the same time. Look at them all. Freaking awesome, mate. Drop this with the other one. Two in the same spot just makes it easier. Now, what time is it? It seems to be getting a little dark. Uh, it's only lunchtime. It might be about to rain. Now, with all this extra time on our hands, we might actually be able to make some really good money just hunting alone. Why have you got your head buried in a tree? Had his head buried in a tree. Let's try and get a head shot. Whoa, we're getting a bit of freezing today. Apologize. Maybe I should turn my settings down. Wonder if that would make a big difference. Let's have a quick look. Settings. Visual quality. Post-processing. Texture quality. Lamp shadows. Shadow quality can go down. average. I'm not sure what anti-aliasing does. Texture quality. I don't know. Feat quality. We'll go down to average. See if that just helps to avoid some of the freezing. I've got a damn good computer. It shouldn't be freezing, but this game tends to freeze a little. Right next to the road. Perfect. Why am I not getting There we go. Spamming the E key and it wasn't picking it up. I do find sticks a little hard to pick up sometimes. The hit boxes aren't huge. Ah, is that him over there? Oh, that's a fox, though. I don't have the recipe for rat soup. You got to have recipes. You can't make things without recipes. If you got the recipe for rat soup, you let me [Laughter] know. Yeah, we need the recipe first. Just like we need the recipe for raspberry mash, we need the recipe for rat soup as well. Fox. Foxes are good cuz you can just pick them straight up and put them in your backpack. Not that we have a backpack, but you know what I mean. Right away. Oh, I thought he was coming towards us. Thought I'd pick up a couple of sticks while he was coming towards us. Turns out he's not. I might have scared him off. Give me. Give me. Give me. Where was he? Looked down to pick up that and now I've lost sight. Oh well. It was a pig there. I saw it. I think I'm getting a little heavy. Yes, I am. Okay, so let's do this pig. We'll head home, go get some gas for our motorcycle, and then we can all start to sing the motorcycle song. [Laughter] to you an operator. Stop freezing. Turn down the freaking settings. Where's that pig? Let's get it off. Any more carcasses just here? Yes, there is. Bugger. Got to take a quick snap at him. I hit a fox. Oh, straight over his head. Yeah, I'll go back and get the trailer. Still over his head. Actually, what I could do is if we put all of this down, we're going to be able to move a little quicker. We're coming back with the trailer anyway. Everything here in one spot. What? What did I just hit? I think it was Q. Oh, it was Q's a auto run. Stupid fox. Stop running away, coward. Get back here and fight like a real man. Says a guy shooting small animals with a gun. Oh, kind of wanted that white fox, too. Kind of. Still missing that damn fox. How many times have I missed that same fox now? Barely worth the amount of bullets I spent on it. That was too low. I've been trying to get the right distance, but [Laughter] No, stop running, pig. That's not a pig thing. Damn foxes cost me a fortune. It's gone now. That one fox, he's cost me like 10 bullets. All right, let's head home. Let's go get that gas. I feel funny sitting on the back of the bike. Where am I? Need to go left. Where's that damn fox? Feel like I'm on the back of the bike. How'd that happen? I zoomed out. How do I change the zoom? Whoa. V button. That'll look [Laughter] cool. All right. The V button. Right. Leave you there. How much gas do we even have? Cuz we're going to need Oh, we got a bit. And so we're going to need gas for the tractor. Okay. Our gun needs fixing. What is that going to take? Tools. Okay. Do we still have tools in here? All right, let's grab the track guitar track. Yep, we're good. Uh, refuel it. Watch out if I was you, chicken. I'm not good with this machine. straight in front of us. We'll gather up all the animals that we've [Applause] shot. Can't shoot on the tractor. missed. All right, let's just admit I'm a bad shot. Move on. Oh, come on. That was a head shot. That's just rude. Okay, so the first one's just to the right. Not with a view. Why do I keep ending up behind? It feels very strange being behind, right? We might as well go down to the road and go up that way. Come on, old girl. Oh, do you have to keep your finger on the accelerator? Okay. See, I was thinking cuz it's a tractor, you don't need to do that. But apparently you do. In real life with a tractor, you just pull the throttle lever down to the position where you want it. And then it'll just stay at that speed. Can I shoot through this barn? Should be able to, right? No. Apparently, you can't. Oh, they're running for their lives. I forgot about that. People don't like it when you pull out a gun and start shooting me at them. Don't know why. It's kind of bizarre. Don't get in front of my tractor, boys. I run you [Applause] over. Oh, you ran away, too. It's just rude. Got the wrong side. Oops. Didn't mean to gut on sight to get less meat. [Applause] No, it's not what I said. Pick it back up. Right. And then we'll take all these we'll take all these home and we'll gut them this evening. Thought I butchered them anyway. All right, just ignore the damn bullet. What the Can you pretend to at least be dead? They're not doing a very good job of pretending to be dead, are they? I'm not sure. Is that hitting the bush in front of it? Six. Oh, come on. All you're doing is wasting my bullets. We definitely need that better gun. How many bullets do I have left? Only four left. Oh well, let's use up the last of our bullets then, shall we? Where's that big white stag gone? Really wanted that big white stag. It's not actually a white, is it? But Oh, come on. I've only got four bullets. Don't do this to me. It's rude. Get back here. You come towards me. That's it. Was that last comment on this day? This is my last bullet. Missed. Oh, we got one. That freaking fox. He just keeps getting further and further away. Oh, wait. Hang on. Nope. I'm out of ammo. All right, we're going to have to spend this money on more ammo. See, now that they I've got no ammo, that fox is not afraid of me. All right. Where is our tractor? Oh, there's that carcass over there, too. We got plenty of meat. We'll go sell the meat. We'll um get some more bullets. We got all those berries to sell as well. Bring the tracker a bit closer. [Applause] The lawnmowing crew are here. It's going to get noisy soon. Okay. I can't get out. I can't get up there cuz you pigs in the way. A rare. Nope. Get back here. Escape. It's too late for that. You're already being shot. You're dead. You do a gymnastics thing. I don't mind. That bag didn't fit. It fitted. It okay. Well, that one did. So, the bags aren't going on properly, but there we go. Yeah, lawn mowing crew is here, so it's going to get noisy shortly. Oh, now just put these in your inventory. Clean. Let them all now sitting next to the road like they feel safe just cuz they know I got no freaking bullets. Go away. Okay, I'm going to have to climb up. Ah, what is that? No, not closed. Mr. Climb on. Can you please behave? And I fell off. Oh, come on. You don't have to be difficult about this, pig. All right, behave yourself, please. Still trying to figure out the best way to load as many animals onto the tractor as possible. because they're a little awkward to load as you can tell. Right, you're on. Oh, I think I know what it is. I'm on the downhill slope, so I'm having trouble reaching up. That could be what it is. Can you throw it? I haven't thought about that. Let's try throwing it. Oh, that worked. Who would have thought you could throw it? Should have should have thought of that earlier. That is not climbing game. Okay. It doesn't like that, does it? Okay. Let's try throwing it on then. Oh, here you go. That'll work. [Applause] I think that went straight over the other side, didn't it? No, not gut on sight. A you get less meat if you go on site. Nope. Can you behave, please? Nope. You're not going to climb on either. It's too full now, I think. Oh, it doesn't like me doing that, does it? Beautiful. I didn't hear it make a noise though, so it may not be on there properly. See if we can rotate it around rather than the legs being on. Ah, keep it and get on sight. Not what I want. It's costing us meat. I'm sure it is. There we go. I heard that one. Yeah, I think one of these might fall off. [Applause] No noise. Makes a noise when it goes on correctly. Yeah, you're fine. You made the noise. That's all that matters. All right, that's all about carcasses. While I was looking at the map, I very nearly hit a rock. There's a few hours work here. I should be throwing them. I keep forgetting you can throw them. Can you throw? Thank you. See if we can throw it right over the top. Not even close. blanking mower. Anyway, Chicken looking at all the dead animals thinking, \"I got to get out of here. This man's gone crazy. Oh, what a stat. Just seeing how much I can stack it now. Stay up there. Ah, that's rude. What do you reckon, dog? I got all of those. What time is it? 1:00. Oops. Oh, that might have been a bit much. Oh, dropped the foxes. Drop the gas now. Can we move here? All right, that's all we can fit in there is 97. Okay, good enough. And you still got eight. Okay. How does this get on? 3 hours. You still got plenty of time. Oh, this is so much better with a slow speed. Getting so much more done today. Look at these animals. Freaking awesome. That bounced back. Okay, whatever. Right, let's go get our motorcycle and then we'll come back and gut all of those. Run, chicken. But not that way. 14 hours on the spuds. All right, we just teleport fast travel now. Hang on. So that's his farm. Motorcycle must be here. That can't be right. It was behind the sawmill. I thought it was behind Thaddius. We did pick that fuel up. I didn't grab the fuel. I took the fuel off the tractor. Oops. Right, let's try that again. Was it actually Thaddius or was it the sawmill? I'm sure it was behind Thaddius. Ruined church. Yeah. So, was it in there or over here? Don't think it was next to the ruined church, was it? I'm lost. That's your fault, Dez, cuz Yuri is telling me I'm lost. Where was it? Yeah, exactly. I think it must have been behind the ruined church, was it? Actually, while we're here. Oh, look at all this. Oh, it's 25. Look like so much more. Gather all this up while we're here. Um, that thing looks like it might be a bad idea to play with. We don't have a loaded gun. Where did he go? We're supposed to hunt that thing. Where did he go? Oh, there he is. There he is. Run. I hope you can't get in here. Freaking heck. Quiet. Now, I've been up here already, but let's just take another look. Now that time has slowed down, maybe we'll see something we didn't before. Oh, I didn't mean to stick down. Where's the bear gone? That's what you usually say when all the booze is gone. Where's the bear gone? Now, did we check this? Yeah, I thought so. Can we see the motorbike from here? Nothing in the bird's nest. I want to try and ring the bell. Oh, we can get in here, but we can't ring the bell. I was thinking I wasn't going to get going to be able to get here cuz I thought I'd fall down. Where is me cycle? Whoa, whoa, whoa. Oh Oh man. I presume that beer will kill me given half a chance. Even quarter of a chance, I presume. Where did he go now? Okay, we know where the bear is. Hi, bear. We know where he is now. We can come back and try to get him later. Let's go this way. And let's just run. We'll see if we can get a bravery award. Run. Oops. Probably shouldn't have done that. It's a bear following us. No, we might have lost him. We either outsmarted him or out maneuvered him. Maybe even both. Where's that freaking bicycle? Uh, M. No, we've definitely not sure. It was near Thaddius, wasn't it? Mushrooms must be over this way. Maybe I should have come back with the rifle. I do have my rifle. Oh, yeah. But I don't have any bullets. It's not going to help me. I need the bullets. I need to refill my refill. Where the stinking heck was that motorcycle? Can't believe I've lost it. Disappear. Uh, where was it? I really think maybe I should just go home, get all that meat, and we'll come back when we have more bullets so I can take out that beer. I'm freaking lost. All right. Was it behind the sawmill? I'm sure it was near Thaddius. Damn sure it was near Thaddius, but let's head over here. Oh, guys, I haven't got my gun out today. Calm down. Whoa. Did you see that? That man can fly literally, figuratively, probably in other ways as well. Okay, here it is. Here it is. No, no, no. Refill. Yeah, now we got a broom. Don't crash this stinking thing as soon as you get it, Glenn. At least wait five [Applause] minutes. This seems quite fast actually. Find out in a minute when I get out onto the open. Not afraid to go fast in here, though. [Music] Oh, you idiot. He ran straight in front of the bloody bike. I don't think you can kill them, can you? Far route, man. What a monkey. He ran straight in front of me bike. All right. See what sort of speed this thing's got. Oh, Glenn. Glenn, stop. Wow. It's changing gears. This thing's not easy to ride, man. This thing is not easy to ride. It slides. [Applause] I don't know if I like it. Every little turn is quite dramatic. Plus, I've found every vehicle in this game seems to pull to the blowen left. I don't know why. We can do 30 km per hour. 35. Look at the boys. 42. [Applause] Oh, well, we got it. Yeah, even if it does feel like it's um crazy machine, we got it. That's the good news. All right. And it is 1:00 in the afternoon. Should I? Yeah, there's a few hours work in this. Let's do this. I don't want to be up all night doing it. See, 39 minutes per animal. There's about a dozen animals here. Yeah. See, it's getting dark now. Oh, we're pretty heavy. Uh, we'll drop the toes. Drop the mates. You're not close enough. be interested to see what time it is. Definitely getting dark. Oh, look at that. I'm glad I didn't leave it too much later. Let's turn the light on. Make sure everything's done. Pardon me. Okay, let's go empty out this weight. Now, I'm pretty sure we have one more day to sell this meat. Pretty sure it wasn't a complete waste of meat. We've got all the carcasses, but the meat has to be sold before the end of winter if I'm not mistaken. So, we have at least one more day, I think, at least. 58 bits of meat. All right, let's head to bed. How we doing for time? Two and three hours for a day. God blam me. We're not going to get another day out of it then, are we? Let's get up at 8:00. I mean, 3 hours. I could call it a day, but I want to sell all this meat. Okay, so let's add something to eat. Some animals will die soon. That's what happens. die eventually. We all get there one day. That's why everybody should always take care of each other. Make sure that you don't get you nowhere. Thank you. All right. So, we're going to sell all this meat today. So, I'll keep the fuel cuz we're probably going to run out. Mushrooms. All right, we need to buy ammo. Woof woof. Oh, sorry. Dog's still asleep. Dog got it. There's more meat. More mushrooms. Let's see what we can make out of this lot. I'm going to sell these berries. cuz we can't do those ones. So, let's just sell them. That wasn't all of them anyway. Ah, it's not even all of them. Oh, man. I'm so heavy. Okay, hang on. Let's One didn't stack. There we go. Oh, true. I've never bothered to never actually bothered to put any of these up on the wall. Just the one. Put our fox heads above the wall. We could put our deer over the bed. A pig up there. Right. Um, grab these. I could have sold them, but I just thought, let's decorate the house with a few. What am I stuck on? Oh, motorcycle. I left the light on all night last night. That's cost me some power. I should not have left the light on. You know the song, don't leave the light on for me. Oh, never mind. Right, that's What time is it? It's 1:00 in the stinky morning. What do you mean it's 1:00 in the morning? I thought I slept until a proper time. I didn't, did I? Oh well. Can we make anything out of this? Oh, I need the spring and the wall. I thought we slept through the night. I must have only slept for 1 hour. Oh well. Albino set. Nice. Albino set too. Nice. We can't do the bear set. The black set. The bore set. The bore set. Hang on. No, we just need Yep. We need more spring. Okay, we're going to make some clothes and then we'll go back to bed again cuz apparently I forgot to sleep through the night. But we got some cool new winter clothing. So the beer set. No black set. Bore set. Four. Three. Bore furs. I only have two. Ah, I have deer. Okay, I only have the deer. So, deer set. Deer set. That's all we can do. Be fur. We need potato mash for doing the springtime set. We'll get that done before spring, summertime set, and a work set. Oh, we've got lots of clothing now. I'll go sell the rest of my fur rather than hang on to it. I'll sell it. Oh, wait. That's not where we putting clothes now, is it? Uh, should we use this one? Cuz it's where I put Yeah, we'll put all of it together. Oh, we got two of the same. I wonder if we can sell them. Never mind. Okay. So, what's this? Fur cat. Fur vest. Fur hat. Well, aren't they all winter? Aren't they all winter clothing? I'm a little confused by that. Let's go back and have another look. Yeah, maybe what we could do is actually call it a day cuz we have been going for 3 hours. We did the deer set. Oh, I can do more. True. And the albino set. Oh, that was the difference. I did the albino set, right? Okay. But I don't think we can sell clothing. Let's just have a look and see if it has a value. I'm not sure if that's a value. No, it's weight and storage capacity. It's not value. Ah, okay. Yeah, I don't know if we can sell this stuff. I think what we'll do is we'll keep one of each on us and we'll try and sell them tomorrow. I probably can't, but why not give it a try? If I can start selling clothing. Yeah, why not? All right, I think what we'll do because it has been three hours and I didn't sleep a full night and I've just noticed YouTube has started buffering. There we go. I don't know why YouTube's buffering, but I'm having a bit of a slow internet week. I have noticed that sometime my YouTube pages aren't loading fully. All right. I think what we'll do is we'll try and sell all of this. Yeah, it's back again now. We'll try and sell all of that next time we play. So, we'll call that it for today. Next time we come back, we got all that and all of this stuff. We're going to try and sell all of it. We're already after midnight, so our food's not going to go off. Yeah, hopefully. That's a lot of good stuff to sell. So, yes, I'm going to call that it for the day. I'll call that it for the stream. And next week when we come back, we're going to sell all of that stuff. I kind of like it with that on the wall. That's kind of cool. We're going have to start decorating our house this winter, too. Um, yeah. So, we'll be back to this again next week.
