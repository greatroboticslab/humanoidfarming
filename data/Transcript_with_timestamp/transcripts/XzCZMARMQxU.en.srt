00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:04,080
hello to everyone so just for you to

2
00:00:02,490 --> 00:00:06,330
know that the ultimate G community of

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:09,540
practice of the CJ a platform for big

4
00:00:06,330 --> 00:00:13,230
data and agriculture started the webinar

5
00:00:09,540 --> 00:00:16,020
series about the ontology product of the

6
00:00:13,230 --> 00:00:19,289
members of our community of practice we

7
00:00:16,020 --> 00:00:21,630
want to know about the content and their

8
00:00:19,289 --> 00:00:24,359
current use in key applications of

9
00:00:21,630 --> 00:00:26,369
platform so the objective is to increase

10
00:00:24,359 --> 00:00:28,640
the knowledge about what's the current

11
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:31,619
statutes of ontologies in agriculture

12
00:00:28,640 --> 00:00:35,010
how they are developed what is their

13
00:00:31,619 --> 00:00:37,410
content and also they up stimulate some

14
00:00:35,010 --> 00:00:40,170
collaborative creation and additional

15
00:00:37,410 --> 00:00:42,840
uses so today Maeda

16
00:00:40,170 --> 00:00:46,460
maja Angelique and the Saleen will

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:51,120
present the agronomy Orochi about

18
00:00:46,460 --> 00:00:53,460
management practices and why it was

19
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,910
necessary to develop this ontology and

20
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:58,980
how it is currently developed and how it

21
00:00:56,910 --> 00:01:02,609
is used in the context of the global

22
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:04,199
economy shall be cool ago Pheebs great

23
00:01:02,609 --> 00:01:06,210
Thank You Elizabeth first we're gonna

24
00:01:04,199 --> 00:01:08,729
start off with Maeda Davari

25
00:01:06,210 --> 00:01:11,280
she's gonna present she is representing

26
00:01:08,729 --> 00:01:13,950
if pre she's a senior fellow research

27
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,049
fellow and module lead at the CGI our

28
00:01:13,950 --> 00:01:17,240
Big Data Platform for agriculture over

29
00:01:16,049 --> 00:01:20,670
to you Maeda

30
00:01:17,240 --> 00:01:23,100
Thank You Man so I leave the the

31
00:01:20,670 --> 00:01:23,820
organize module of CG ARS Big Data

32
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:26,640
Platform

33
00:01:23,820 --> 00:01:29,909
and the module is all about as you might

34
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:34,740
guess organizing data and getting data

35
00:01:29,909 --> 00:01:37,770
to be both open as well as useable by

36
00:01:34,740 --> 00:01:39,930
other people so what are some of the

37
00:01:37,770 --> 00:01:41,790
questions that that we might encounter I

38
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:44,520
mean it's always good to start from what

39
00:01:41,790 --> 00:01:46,710
the what the issues really are so some

40
00:01:44,520 --> 00:01:48,390
of the real real life questions that

41
00:01:46,710 --> 00:01:50,009
we've encountered or you know something

42
00:01:48,390 --> 00:01:51,869
like this what does variation in crop

43
00:01:50,009 --> 00:01:55,049
response to fertilizer look like for

44
00:01:51,869 --> 00:01:58,009
sub-saharan Africa I need data for my

45
00:01:55,049 --> 00:02:00,840
crop model where am I going to find that

46
00:01:58,009 --> 00:02:04,500
I want to predict land-use change

47
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,509
between 2030 and 2050 at both national

48
00:02:04,500 --> 00:02:09,270
and sub-national level in South Asia or

49
00:02:06,509 --> 00:02:11,760
anywhere in the world really where do I

50
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:12,630
go for that data well now we have

51
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,260
through the big

52
00:02:12,630 --> 00:02:19,200
platform we have a data portal called

53
00:02:16,260 --> 00:02:21,720
Guardian which looks across all of CGI

54
00:02:19,200 --> 00:02:24,300
our centers as well as several other

55
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:28,710
entities in the agricultural domain

56
00:02:24,300 --> 00:02:30,630
including USAID USDA the World Bank some

57
00:02:28,710 --> 00:02:34,680
a portion of the world bank's data

58
00:02:30,630 --> 00:02:37,050
assets the the government of India's

59
00:02:34,680 --> 00:02:40,820
open data portal the agricultural part

60
00:02:37,050 --> 00:02:43,050
of that and a few other entities as well

61
00:02:40,820 --> 00:02:45,260
so when you do a search like this in

62
00:02:43,050 --> 00:02:48,450
Guardian what you'll see is a bunch of

63
00:02:45,260 --> 00:02:50,220
hits on publications and data sets I've

64
00:02:48,450 --> 00:02:53,850
clicked on the data sets link here so

65
00:02:50,220 --> 00:02:56,490
you can see some of the data sets that

66
00:02:53,850 --> 00:03:00,420
are coming from you know a bunch of the

67
00:02:56,490 --> 00:03:02,070
CGI our centers as well as USDA here but

68
00:03:00,420 --> 00:03:03,780
you'll also see data depending on the

69
00:03:02,070 --> 00:03:06,180
searches that you're doing as prevention

70
00:03:03,780 --> 00:03:07,920
from from the World Bank from the

71
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:09,540
government of India's open data portal

72
00:03:07,920 --> 00:03:11,760
and for agricultural research that data

73
00:03:09,540 --> 00:03:14,010
is coming from ICA are the Indian

74
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:18,780
Council for agricultural research u.s.

75
00:03:14,010 --> 00:03:22,440
aid did USDA and that list is growing as

76
00:03:18,780 --> 00:03:25,530
we develop Guardian more and more so the

77
00:03:22,440 --> 00:03:27,750
the issue about finding data is a little

78
00:03:25,530 --> 00:03:30,900
bit better in hand now you can go to a

79
00:03:27,750 --> 00:03:32,820
one-stop shop you can find data we're

80
00:03:30,900 --> 00:03:35,670
still working on Guardian we continue to

81
00:03:32,820 --> 00:03:37,080
improve it so we're getting to that

82
00:03:35,670 --> 00:03:39,270
point where we're creating a knowledge

83
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:42,540
base for the data now when you find the

84
00:03:39,270 --> 00:03:45,090
data what does it look like this is data

85
00:03:42,540 --> 00:03:49,020
a very very well described data set of

86
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:51,300
that I I found from Guardian and even if

87
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:53,100
it's well described what you see is you

88
00:03:51,300 --> 00:03:56,360
know some some questions about what

89
00:03:53,100 --> 00:03:59,690
these gaps are in these in these cells

90
00:03:56,360 --> 00:04:02,550
some of the notations that keep changing

91
00:03:59,690 --> 00:04:04,260
and some of these are described in the

92
00:04:02,550 --> 00:04:06,240
data there are data variables there's a

93
00:04:04,260 --> 00:04:08,580
tab a metadata tab for this particular

94
00:04:06,240 --> 00:04:11,550
data set and you see that for most data

95
00:04:08,580 --> 00:04:12,810
sets that is still sort of a mystery you

96
00:04:11,550 --> 00:04:14,220
know if you're an agronomist you might

97
00:04:12,810 --> 00:04:17,220
be able to guess what these things are

98
00:04:14,220 --> 00:04:20,280
but not always you continue on down the

99
00:04:17,220 --> 00:04:22,830
data set these two four columns the

100
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:25,120
fifth or sixth column are still you know

101
00:04:22,830 --> 00:04:27,820
question marks the

102
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:30,910
rotation is continuing to change and as

103
00:04:27,820 --> 00:04:32,979
you keep moving down the data said this

104
00:04:30,910 --> 00:04:36,250
is about 8,000 rows of data for multiple

105
00:04:32,979 --> 00:04:38,410
countries in Africa again now you see

106
00:04:36,250 --> 00:04:40,120
the notations changing so here it looks

107
00:04:38,410 --> 00:04:42,729
like there's intercropping with pigeon

108
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:46,590
pea that was intercropping up above in

109
00:04:42,729 --> 00:04:48,280
the data set that wasn't noted the the

110
00:04:46,590 --> 00:04:51,340
treatments or what seemed to be

111
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:53,320
treatments are also changing and they're

112
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:55,240
all noted very differently even where

113
00:04:53,320 --> 00:04:57,150
there are commonalities and this is just

114
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:59,220
one dataset across different countries

115
00:04:57,150 --> 00:05:02,080
presumably with different people

116
00:04:59,220 --> 00:05:03,940
collecting that data what's interesting

117
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:07,330
is the language changes as well within

118
00:05:03,940 --> 00:05:10,600
the data set so while a lot of this as I

119
00:05:07,330 --> 00:05:12,610
said is well described the notations are

120
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,490
well described even for this data set

121
00:05:12,610 --> 00:05:19,330
not all of it is so even though you can

122
00:05:15,490 --> 00:05:21,280
find the data can you actually reuse it

123
00:05:19,330 --> 00:05:23,260
can you actually understand what that

124
00:05:21,280 --> 00:05:26,139
data is telling you so the question is

125
00:05:23,260 --> 00:05:28,570
how do I collect or find well-described

126
00:05:26,139 --> 00:05:30,700
data for model simulations that won't

127
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:33,550
involve months of pain in terms of

128
00:05:30,700 --> 00:05:35,380
trying to contact the owners trying to

129
00:05:33,550 --> 00:05:37,000
understand what that data is trying you

130
00:05:35,380 --> 00:05:39,340
know saying what those variables are

131
00:05:37,000 --> 00:05:41,229
trying to tell you you might need

132
00:05:39,340 --> 00:05:42,669
standardized data to recommend your best

133
00:05:41,229 --> 00:05:45,880
bet intensive sustainable

134
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:49,270
intensification possibilities you might

135
00:05:45,880 --> 00:05:51,820
be told as as CGI our scientists are

136
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:54,070
increasingly told it's great to make

137
00:05:51,820 --> 00:05:56,849
your data agronomic data fair fair

138
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:59,199
meaning make it findable accessible

139
00:05:56,849 --> 00:06:01,900
interoperable and reusable that means

140
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:04,449
adhering to the fair principles well how

141
00:06:01,900 --> 00:06:06,520
do I do this just give me the tools to

142
00:06:04,449 --> 00:06:09,130
do it tell me how to do it and maybe I

143
00:06:06,520 --> 00:06:11,500
will so these are the kinds of issues

144
00:06:09,130 --> 00:06:13,900
that we're trying to address through the

145
00:06:11,500 --> 00:06:15,310
project that we're going to describe the

146
00:06:13,900 --> 00:06:18,460
three of us are going to describe today

147
00:06:15,310 --> 00:06:21,940
I've already shown you Guardian we're

148
00:06:18,460 --> 00:06:23,949
trying to get semantically enabled data

149
00:06:21,940 --> 00:06:26,229
that's where the ontologies come in that

150
00:06:23,949 --> 00:06:29,039
you'll be hearing about today to be able

151
00:06:26,229 --> 00:06:31,389
to query the vast data pool that is

152
00:06:29,039 --> 00:06:34,780
represented in the knowledge base that

153
00:06:31,389 --> 00:06:36,669
Guardian is in addition to that we're

154
00:06:34,780 --> 00:06:38,530
building Fair workflows into the

155
00:06:36,669 --> 00:06:38,920
Guardian data ecosystem so that whether

156
00:06:38,530 --> 00:06:41,470
or not

157
00:06:38,920 --> 00:06:43,990
you choose to put your to make your data

158
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:46,330
available to us we would like to make

159
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:49,660
available tools that allow you to more

160
00:06:46,330 --> 00:06:51,580
easily make historical data fair or data

161
00:06:49,660 --> 00:06:52,270
that's not collected use it using any

162
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:54,340
fuel books

163
00:06:52,270 --> 00:06:55,630
so that's part of that cog there but

164
00:06:54,340 --> 00:06:56,620
what we're going to be talking about

165
00:06:55,630 --> 00:06:59,080
today and what I'm going to be

166
00:06:56,620 --> 00:07:00,280
describing in a minute is how to

167
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:02,590
generate data that's already

168
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:04,570
semantically enabled so this is a

169
00:07:02,590 --> 00:07:09,820
standardized data collection tools part

170
00:07:04,570 --> 00:07:11,830
of it which in for the agronomy domain

171
00:07:09,820 --> 00:07:14,020
is called Agri films or the agronomy

172
00:07:11,830 --> 00:07:16,600
field information management system I'm

173
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:19,300
an agronomist myself and so this is very

174
00:07:16,600 --> 00:07:21,520
near to my heart because I faced a lot

175
00:07:19,300 --> 00:07:24,310
of these issues that that I'm that I've

176
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:27,250
just described what a graph ins does is

177
00:07:24,310 --> 00:07:29,590
it allows you to standardize standardize

178
00:07:27,250 --> 00:07:30,910
your data at the collection point so

179
00:07:29,590 --> 00:07:32,830
you're not having to monkey with it

180
00:07:30,910 --> 00:07:36,190
after you collect after you publish

181
00:07:32,830 --> 00:07:39,880
trying to struggle with it in those

182
00:07:36,190 --> 00:07:44,340
terms we have enabled digital data

183
00:07:39,880 --> 00:07:46,510
collection and as well as quality checks

184
00:07:44,340 --> 00:07:50,200
preliminary quality checks of the data

185
00:07:46,510 --> 00:07:52,060
and statistical reports and I realized

186
00:07:50,200 --> 00:07:54,160
that through all of this I did not

187
00:07:52,060 --> 00:07:55,510
include a link to Agri films but I see

188
00:07:54,160 --> 00:07:58,210
that Saleem has been putting it in the

189
00:07:55,510 --> 00:08:02,080
chat Thank You Saleem for that and

190
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:04,840
apologies for missing that again the

191
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:06,670
whole thing that the the collection the

192
00:08:04,840 --> 00:08:09,280
ability to collect data is reliant on

193
00:08:06,670 --> 00:08:12,100
the fact that it's based on the agronomy

194
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:15,220
ontology and other ontology x' and

195
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:18,810
aligns with the cg core metadata schema

196
00:08:15,220 --> 00:08:21,940
which has a generalized or a customized

197
00:08:18,810 --> 00:08:23,530
instance of an industry-standard the

198
00:08:21,940 --> 00:08:24,700
Dublin core metadata schema which is

199
00:08:23,530 --> 00:08:28,240
what we use across all of our

200
00:08:24,700 --> 00:08:29,800
repositories right so just diving into

201
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:32,130
the field book I'm gonna show you some

202
00:08:29,800 --> 00:08:34,720
quick screens of what that looks like

203
00:08:32,130 --> 00:08:36,820
you'll have to play with it yourself we

204
00:08:34,720 --> 00:08:39,610
hope that it's we think it's quite user

205
00:08:36,820 --> 00:08:41,500
friendly but we're always happy Selene

206
00:08:39,610 --> 00:08:43,980
and I to to meet with you individually

207
00:08:41,500 --> 00:08:46,300
and walk you through it in more detail

208
00:08:43,980 --> 00:08:49,270
so the field book is organized

209
00:08:46,300 --> 00:08:52,490
essentially based on kind of the suite

210
00:08:49,270 --> 00:08:54,950
of things that you would do in the

211
00:08:52,490 --> 00:08:56,209
EAL is an agronomist the first thing you

212
00:08:54,950 --> 00:08:59,060
want to do is to describe your

213
00:08:56,209 --> 00:09:01,640
experiment so here are some of the

214
00:08:59,060 --> 00:09:03,800
screen the the fields that I've taken

215
00:09:01,640 --> 00:09:06,230
from the screen that allows you to put

216
00:09:03,800 --> 00:09:08,060
in your experiment details and I've just

217
00:09:06,230 --> 00:09:09,950
shown you that that when you click on

218
00:09:08,060 --> 00:09:12,709
any one of these drop-down things like

219
00:09:09,950 --> 00:09:14,660
type of experiment there you see a list

220
00:09:12,709 --> 00:09:17,540
of choices so it's wherever possible

221
00:09:14,660 --> 00:09:19,880
we've included pick lists and all of the

222
00:09:17,540 --> 00:09:23,149
content of those pick lists is part of

223
00:09:19,880 --> 00:09:24,500
the ontology now the other things I'm

224
00:09:23,149 --> 00:09:26,750
going to describe to you here there's a

225
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:29,270
number of different screens that you

226
00:09:26,750 --> 00:09:31,880
step through in Agri films I'll just

227
00:09:29,270 --> 00:09:33,770
focus on the site the crop the the

228
00:09:31,880 --> 00:09:36,020
design part of this and the crop

229
00:09:33,770 --> 00:09:38,330
measurement part of it just to give you

230
00:09:36,020 --> 00:09:40,220
a flavor of what this looks like now

231
00:09:38,330 --> 00:09:42,020
when you go to site the first thing

232
00:09:40,220 --> 00:09:46,550
you're gonna do is try to identify where

233
00:09:42,020 --> 00:09:48,200
your trials are set up so this is kind

234
00:09:46,550 --> 00:09:49,970
of a drop down menu that's that's

235
00:09:48,200 --> 00:09:51,620
organized by first level second level

236
00:09:49,970 --> 00:09:55,490
third level fourth level fifth level

237
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:57,290
admin divisions wherever the data is

238
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:59,420
available we go down to the fifth level

239
00:09:57,290 --> 00:10:02,470
admin where it's not we stop at

240
00:09:59,420 --> 00:10:06,940
whatever's the authoritative source

241
00:10:02,470 --> 00:10:10,360
allows us to get to so once you start

242
00:10:06,940 --> 00:10:15,339
zooming in on your on your on your

243
00:10:10,360 --> 00:10:18,589
location the what you see is is the the

244
00:10:15,339 --> 00:10:20,540
tool fills in your lap' long information

245
00:10:18,589 --> 00:10:22,430
so that's kind of helpful as well one of

246
00:10:20,540 --> 00:10:24,589
the things that we probably will want to

247
00:10:22,430 --> 00:10:27,170
do is to be able to take your pin and

248
00:10:24,589 --> 00:10:29,450
drop it on your your site and hone in

249
00:10:27,170 --> 00:10:32,060
further that way rather than having to

250
00:10:29,450 --> 00:10:33,740
know the names that you you you you are

251
00:10:32,060 --> 00:10:34,310
doing so that's that that'll be coming

252
00:10:33,740 --> 00:10:37,250
soon

253
00:10:34,310 --> 00:10:40,190
that's how you choose your site and once

254
00:10:37,250 --> 00:10:42,500
you've done that you go on to to the

255
00:10:40,190 --> 00:10:45,130
other parts if you're of the screen that

256
00:10:42,500 --> 00:10:48,470
I showed you earlier so here's the crop

257
00:10:45,130 --> 00:10:51,500
oops here's the crop part the crop

258
00:10:48,470 --> 00:10:53,870
screens that you can see you can choose

259
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:56,300
monocrop into crop real a crop those

260
00:10:53,870 --> 00:10:58,610
choices will can be modified as we get

261
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:01,670
more input from users we have a number

262
00:10:58,610 --> 00:11:04,880
of crops already pre-loaded into the

263
00:11:01,670 --> 00:11:06,259
system and more will be being made

264
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,929
available as we as

265
00:11:06,259 --> 00:11:11,179
continue to work on a graphics it's

266
00:11:08,929 --> 00:11:13,720
completely usable usable right now by

267
00:11:11,179 --> 00:11:16,489
the way version one is already up and

268
00:11:13,720 --> 00:11:19,129
available for you to play with so you

269
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:20,569
choose your crop this is all again part

270
00:11:19,129 --> 00:11:26,569
of the ontology all of these choices

271
00:11:20,569 --> 00:11:29,419
that you see and once you do that you

272
00:11:26,569 --> 00:11:32,499
can go in and specify an experimental

273
00:11:29,419 --> 00:11:35,029
design so we've got some commonly used

274
00:11:32,499 --> 00:11:37,699
experimental designs in the agronomy for

275
00:11:35,029 --> 00:11:39,769
the agronomy domain already there and

276
00:11:37,699 --> 00:11:43,069
again they're part of the ontology so

277
00:11:39,769 --> 00:11:46,339
that when I specify an AR CBD and

278
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:50,059
somebody else specifies the same design

279
00:11:46,339 --> 00:11:52,100
and I'm you know a user who's looking

280
00:11:50,059 --> 00:11:54,829
for for whatever reason I'm using for

281
00:11:52,100 --> 00:11:57,559
I'm looking for certain experiments with

282
00:11:54,829 --> 00:12:00,109
that have to do with weeds and bean into

283
00:11:57,559 --> 00:12:02,600
crops a which is a little unusual but it

284
00:12:00,109 --> 00:12:05,809
exists and a better that are set up as

285
00:12:02,600 --> 00:12:08,869
are CBDs now because all of this is

286
00:12:05,809 --> 00:12:12,199
already standardized I can I can get at

287
00:12:08,869 --> 00:12:15,859
those at those experiments those trials

288
00:12:12,199 --> 00:12:18,769
I specify my experimental unit we have

289
00:12:15,859 --> 00:12:21,769
the choices of plot field and pot I can

290
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:23,689
specify the units the dimensions of that

291
00:12:21,769 --> 00:12:27,199
experimental unit and I go on and

292
00:12:23,689 --> 00:12:28,850
describe my design as part of the

293
00:12:27,199 --> 00:12:31,129
experimental design I also want to

294
00:12:28,850 --> 00:12:33,499
specify what my what the factors are

295
00:12:31,129 --> 00:12:35,749
that I'm bearing so here again it's a

296
00:12:33,499 --> 00:12:37,850
huge pick list with an autocomplete to

297
00:12:35,749 --> 00:12:39,799
make your life a little easier so I can

298
00:12:37,850 --> 00:12:42,470
choose a nutrient element type and

299
00:12:39,799 --> 00:12:44,480
amount I can choose my crop in case of

300
00:12:42,470 --> 00:12:45,919
an intra crop I'll choose you know I may

301
00:12:44,480 --> 00:12:47,720
I may be fertilizing the crops

302
00:12:45,919 --> 00:12:49,909
differently so I want to do it that way

303
00:12:47,720 --> 00:12:53,119
here I've said okay I'm going to vary

304
00:12:49,909 --> 00:12:54,739
nitrogen and I have two levels 100

305
00:12:53,119 --> 00:12:56,149
kilograms per hectare and 50 kilograms

306
00:12:54,739 --> 00:12:58,419
per hectare that I'm testing I'm

307
00:12:56,149 --> 00:13:01,639
applying for each of those levels I'm

308
00:12:58,419 --> 00:13:03,259
applying to applications or to split so

309
00:13:01,639 --> 00:13:05,899
I'm applying the fertilizer into splits

310
00:13:03,259 --> 00:13:08,389
essentially and then I can click on the

311
00:13:05,899 --> 00:13:12,319
fertilizer application details or I can

312
00:13:08,389 --> 00:13:14,269
add more nutrients I may have NPK sulfur

313
00:13:12,319 --> 00:13:18,130
copper whatever it is we have all of

314
00:13:14,269 --> 00:13:20,110
that possible for you to to add

315
00:13:18,130 --> 00:13:22,360
once I click on the fertilizer

316
00:13:20,110 --> 00:13:25,210
application details I get taken to

317
00:13:22,360 --> 00:13:27,460
another screen that looks like this that

318
00:13:25,210 --> 00:13:29,470
is actually something we're very proud

319
00:13:27,460 --> 00:13:32,680
of it took a lot of work for us to get

320
00:13:29,470 --> 00:13:35,140
to this stage and this is kudos to the

321
00:13:32,680 --> 00:13:36,340
to the SIP development team because a

322
00:13:35,140 --> 00:13:38,890
lot of this develop all of this

323
00:13:36,340 --> 00:13:41,260
development really is done at sip except

324
00:13:38,890 --> 00:13:44,320
for the ontology development work which

325
00:13:41,260 --> 00:13:48,430
has done a diversity or the Alliance

326
00:13:44,320 --> 00:13:50,770
Bioversity see at now so I'm now at the

327
00:13:48,430 --> 00:13:53,650
screen where the the tool is helping me

328
00:13:50,770 --> 00:13:55,840
calculate the amount of product that I

329
00:13:53,650 --> 00:13:59,530
would need to add so I specify okay I

330
00:13:55,840 --> 00:14:01,330
want to add 70 kilograms I've had a 70

331
00:13:59,530 --> 00:14:04,210
kilograms per hectare of nitrogen and my

332
00:14:01,330 --> 00:14:07,120
first split I can specify timing days

333
00:14:04,210 --> 00:14:09,910
after planting the technique and the

334
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:12,550
traction as well by using these pick

335
00:14:09,910 --> 00:14:14,650
lists and therefore most of these there

336
00:14:12,550 --> 00:14:17,320
is an other when we have pick lists so

337
00:14:14,650 --> 00:14:19,420
that I can also we try to give you

338
00:14:17,320 --> 00:14:21,520
flexibility so that if your choice is

339
00:14:19,420 --> 00:14:23,710
not part of the choices we have in the

340
00:14:21,520 --> 00:14:25,480
ontology you can add that and at some

341
00:14:23,710 --> 00:14:27,340
point we will try to build that into the

342
00:14:25,480 --> 00:14:30,100
ontology that's the thinking behind this

343
00:14:27,340 --> 00:14:32,500
behind the flexibility part of this so

344
00:14:30,100 --> 00:14:34,600
I'm adding 70/30 split for my hundred

345
00:14:32,500 --> 00:14:38,650
kilograms per hectare and I'm adding a

346
00:14:34,600 --> 00:14:41,260
forty ten split for my 50 kilogram per

347
00:14:38,650 --> 00:14:42,880
hectare treatment off of nitrogen I'm

348
00:14:41,260 --> 00:14:46,060
adding it all as ammonium nitrate in

349
00:14:42,880 --> 00:14:48,700
this case I can also specify using this

350
00:14:46,060 --> 00:14:51,850
little table that you see here NPK

351
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:55,300
calcium magnesium sulfur bla bla I can

352
00:14:51,850 --> 00:14:58,570
specify the the the product content so

353
00:14:55,300 --> 00:15:01,200
the content of these different of these

354
00:14:58,570 --> 00:15:04,120
different elements in a particular

355
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:05,470
formulation that I'm choosing to use so

356
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:08,710
we've tried to give you flexibility

357
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:11,590
there once I do all of this the the tool

358
00:15:08,710 --> 00:15:14,200
will give me how much of the amount to

359
00:15:11,590 --> 00:15:16,330
add and then of course it's not going

360
00:15:14,200 --> 00:15:18,940
down to the level of saying okay you you

361
00:15:16,330 --> 00:15:22,960
this is the amount per hectare now you

362
00:15:18,940 --> 00:15:26,470
have to sort of figure out you know how

363
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:28,240
much for your plot the amount for the

364
00:15:26,470 --> 00:15:31,450
plot that's coming in

365
00:15:28,240 --> 00:15:34,750
next generation trying to get much more

366
00:15:31,450 --> 00:15:37,600
useful information to the user per crop

367
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:39,490
measurement you want to specify what are

368
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:41,500
the different things you want to be

369
00:15:39,490 --> 00:15:43,209
measuring in the field so here I'm going

370
00:15:41,500 --> 00:15:44,980
to say ok this is I've clicked on the

371
00:15:43,209 --> 00:15:47,950
wheat tab this is an inter crop that I'm

372
00:15:44,980 --> 00:15:50,170
showing you for being in wheat and I and

373
00:15:47,950 --> 00:15:52,450
for wheat I'm going to choose these

374
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,850
different measurements there's a number

375
00:15:52,450 --> 00:15:57,459
of parameters when I choose fresh weight

376
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:59,680
and I say here I want the total

377
00:15:57,459 --> 00:16:02,440
above-ground biomass including spikes I

378
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:04,680
you know I want the grain all of that is

379
00:16:02,440 --> 00:16:08,170
possible as I go down through this this

380
00:16:04,680 --> 00:16:12,820
screen for crop measurements I can I can

381
00:16:08,170 --> 00:16:14,770
specify the units here in again we've

382
00:16:12,820 --> 00:16:16,510
tried to get flexibility for people who

383
00:16:14,770 --> 00:16:18,339
might have other units you know if

384
00:16:16,510 --> 00:16:20,700
you're if you're working as I did in

385
00:16:18,339 --> 00:16:22,720
Nepal you might have local

386
00:16:20,700 --> 00:16:24,540
specifications of unit you might want to

387
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:27,070
add those at least for the time being so

388
00:16:24,540 --> 00:16:30,850
we've we've tried to include some

389
00:16:27,070 --> 00:16:33,790
flexibility there to encourage use for

390
00:16:30,850 --> 00:16:35,350
people again drop lists wherever

391
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:38,730
possible pick lists wherever possible

392
00:16:35,350 --> 00:16:42,670
with the potential to specify something

393
00:16:38,730 --> 00:16:44,380
bespoke if it doesn't exist right so

394
00:16:42,670 --> 00:16:48,250
what is this all of this give you once I

395
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:50,320
go through and walk my way through the

396
00:16:48,250 --> 00:16:52,540
field book through the through the

397
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:55,300
system I end up with a field book that

398
00:16:52,540 --> 00:16:57,310
looks like this which which has

399
00:16:55,300 --> 00:16:59,860
randomized all the different treatments

400
00:16:57,310 --> 00:17:01,600
that I've specified it gives me the the

401
00:16:59,860 --> 00:17:03,640
plot number of the block number the row

402
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:06,880
number depending on the design I choose

403
00:17:03,640 --> 00:17:08,829
it will lay this out for me it'll lay

404
00:17:06,880 --> 00:17:11,170
out my treatments and then it will also

405
00:17:08,829 --> 00:17:13,209
give me the the things that I've

406
00:17:11,170 --> 00:17:16,750
specified for measurement so I'm showing

407
00:17:13,209 --> 00:17:18,189
you here the tab that that says okay for

408
00:17:16,750 --> 00:17:20,589
common being here the measurements have

409
00:17:18,189 --> 00:17:22,949
specified for crop measurement for wheat

410
00:17:20,589 --> 00:17:26,400
here the crop measurements are specified

411
00:17:22,949 --> 00:17:28,630
these other tabs here are our

412
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:32,230
specifications through sort of the

413
00:17:28,630 --> 00:17:35,050
general practices that I want my team in

414
00:17:32,230 --> 00:17:41,429
the field to follow for irrigation for

415
00:17:35,050 --> 00:17:43,919
weeding for planting etc so all of those

416
00:17:41,429 --> 00:17:47,640
directions are essentially already coded

417
00:17:43,919 --> 00:17:51,400
ontology and given to my to my team

418
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:54,780
right so once I've done this what we've

419
00:17:51,400 --> 00:17:57,130
done is to work with the Katie smart

420
00:17:54,780 --> 00:17:59,679
application so the Katie smart tool

421
00:17:57,130 --> 00:18:02,200
which allows you to go out in the in the

422
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:05,830
in the field and collect data digitally

423
00:18:02,200 --> 00:18:09,669
using either an Android telephone or or

424
00:18:05,830 --> 00:18:12,250
a tablet so I can katie smart will now

425
00:18:09,669 --> 00:18:15,370
accept this field book that I've created

426
00:18:12,250 --> 00:18:17,140
and it will allow me to step through the

427
00:18:15,370 --> 00:18:19,990
field and actually collect the data

428
00:18:17,140 --> 00:18:22,780
it'll it'll give me what measurements I

429
00:18:19,990 --> 00:18:24,580
have specified or or give to my field

430
00:18:22,780 --> 00:18:27,580
crew if I'm not the person collecting

431
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:29,770
that the data it'll it'll give them an

432
00:18:27,580 --> 00:18:31,990
indication of what needs to be collected

433
00:18:29,770 --> 00:18:34,809
and when and and how many of those

434
00:18:31,990 --> 00:18:37,960
samples need to be taken it'll it'll

435
00:18:34,809 --> 00:18:40,360
give them an idea also of the management

436
00:18:37,960 --> 00:18:43,330
scenario you know when do i or gate how

437
00:18:40,360 --> 00:18:45,880
do i irrigate etc so all of that is is

438
00:18:43,330 --> 00:18:48,039
codified because the field book has that

439
00:18:45,880 --> 00:18:51,309
information katie smart collects it and

440
00:18:48,039 --> 00:18:52,990
and you can use that in the field once

441
00:18:51,309 --> 00:18:55,120
you've collected your data what you want

442
00:18:52,990 --> 00:18:58,059
to do is send it back actually to a

443
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:59,799
griffons for analysis because you can do

444
00:18:58,059 --> 00:19:01,900
preliminary analysis now you've chosen

445
00:18:59,799 --> 00:19:04,659
your statistical design you said it's

446
00:19:01,900 --> 00:19:06,549
our CBD you select your the treatments

447
00:19:04,659 --> 00:19:09,130
you've specified and then you can go

448
00:19:06,549 --> 00:19:10,330
through and and what you get up get out

449
00:19:09,130 --> 00:19:13,260
of it is a criminal

450
00:19:10,330 --> 00:19:15,730
preliminary very simple sort of

451
00:19:13,260 --> 00:19:17,740
statistical analysis which you may

452
00:19:15,730 --> 00:19:19,870
choose to use it's a nice word document

453
00:19:17,740 --> 00:19:23,770
you may choose to use parts of that in a

454
00:19:19,870 --> 00:19:25,870
publication or at at you know it works

455
00:19:23,770 --> 00:19:28,929
really it's a very quick way of getting

456
00:19:25,870 --> 00:19:32,590
a sense of what your data actually looks

457
00:19:28,929 --> 00:19:34,360
like so this is the soup to nuts that

458
00:19:32,590 --> 00:19:38,140
that we've envisioned we try to build

459
00:19:34,360 --> 00:19:40,720
value in for our users by already giving

460
00:19:38,140 --> 00:19:44,799
them metadata by already making this

461
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:47,190
data conformant with with the ontology

462
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:50,580
and this was really the use case

463
00:19:47,190 --> 00:19:52,970
for the development off the agronomy

464
00:19:50,580 --> 00:19:55,410
ontology we realized that we needed a

465
00:19:52,970 --> 00:19:57,570
field book we need it's a way of

466
00:19:55,410 --> 00:20:00,780
standardizing field information so that

467
00:19:57,570 --> 00:20:03,710
now we can operate over large pools of

468
00:20:00,780 --> 00:20:06,420
data that are described in the same way

469
00:20:03,710 --> 00:20:08,820
we cannot use our big data and machine

470
00:20:06,420 --> 00:20:11,640
learning techniques to do this and to

471
00:20:08,820 --> 00:20:14,250
gain more insight from the vast amounts

472
00:20:11,640 --> 00:20:16,380
of data that we're producing as agronomy

473
00:20:14,250 --> 00:20:18,470
community really this is a soup to nuts

474
00:20:16,380 --> 00:20:22,230
approach of a griffin's

475
00:20:18,470 --> 00:20:25,410
and I am almost done but not without

476
00:20:22,230 --> 00:20:28,440
thanking the many many folks who have

477
00:20:25,410 --> 00:20:31,200
contributed to this the the people who

478
00:20:28,440 --> 00:20:34,230
are in bold are the ones who have done a

479
00:20:31,200 --> 00:20:35,910
lot of the work the lion's share of the

480
00:20:34,230 --> 00:20:38,580
work but there have been a lot of others

481
00:20:35,910 --> 00:20:39,960
who have contributed quite significantly

482
00:20:38,580 --> 00:20:43,800
to this so I want to acknowledge that

483
00:20:39,960 --> 00:20:45,080
and with that I'll stop and hand over to

484
00:20:43,800 --> 00:20:48,990
the next speaker

485
00:20:45,080 --> 00:20:50,670
Aman over to you yeah thank you so much

486
00:20:48,990 --> 00:20:53,190
made up for that comprehensive overview

487
00:20:50,670 --> 00:20:56,100
so yeah we'll pass it now on to marry

488
00:20:53,190 --> 00:20:57,230
Angelique lepre associate scientist at

489
00:20:56,100 --> 00:21:01,380
the Alliance of Bioversity international

490
00:20:57,230 --> 00:21:03,270
and see at over to you thank you I'm an

491
00:21:01,380 --> 00:21:04,320
you know if we weren't so in my

492
00:21:03,270 --> 00:21:06,660
presentation today

493
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,640
I'm saving and I I mean it's not my

494
00:21:06,660 --> 00:21:10,140
presentation you shared with 13 we are

495
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,150
going to present like the agronomy

496
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:13,920
ontology so I'm gonna present more on

497
00:21:12,150 --> 00:21:16,440
the ergonomy structure and content and

498
00:21:13,920 --> 00:21:19,770
how we build it and sitting is gonna

499
00:21:16,440 --> 00:21:23,830
explain how to use it to annotate like

500
00:21:19,770 --> 00:21:26,260
your data so just read

501
00:21:23,830 --> 00:21:28,120
context or domain Amira gave a good

502
00:21:26,260 --> 00:21:30,279
overview of what we wanted to do really

503
00:21:28,120 --> 00:21:32,200
we wanted to have like an ontology that

504
00:21:30,279 --> 00:21:35,649
will be that could be used to harmonize

505
00:21:32,200 --> 00:21:37,840
like economic data and when we started

506
00:21:35,649 --> 00:21:39,610
like this project there was there were a

507
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:41,769
lot of ontology that was already

508
00:21:39,610 --> 00:21:45,130
existing that were relevant to the

509
00:21:41,769 --> 00:21:46,809
agronomy domain Feinstein's some cover

510
00:21:45,130 --> 00:21:49,000
like the cod Museum and thoughts on the

511
00:21:46,809 --> 00:21:51,360
environment but really there was a big

512
00:21:49,000 --> 00:21:53,649
gap in terms of how to describe like

513
00:21:51,360 --> 00:21:55,960
treatments that are really important and

514
00:21:53,649 --> 00:21:57,429
also experimental protocol and this

515
00:21:55,960 --> 00:22:00,010
information is really important

516
00:21:57,429 --> 00:22:02,500
particularly in the context of using the

517
00:22:00,010 --> 00:22:04,750
data because if you don't have this

518
00:22:02,500 --> 00:22:06,730
information maybe you can misinterprets

519
00:22:04,750 --> 00:22:10,360
part of the data so for instance if you

520
00:22:06,730 --> 00:22:11,980
look at yield maize yield data and you

521
00:22:10,360 --> 00:22:14,350
don't know that some of the he had been

522
00:22:11,980 --> 00:22:17,110
collecting and already be like stress

523
00:22:14,350 --> 00:22:19,960
conditions then maybe when you use a

524
00:22:17,110 --> 00:22:22,360
data set I mean you can you can that can

525
00:22:19,960 --> 00:22:24,159
miss to some mistake so that's really

526
00:22:22,360 --> 00:22:26,880
what we wanted to do with the economy

527
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:30,130
ontology and the economy ontology now

528
00:22:26,880 --> 00:22:32,019
provides like all the semantics needed

529
00:22:30,130 --> 00:22:34,690
to describe like agricultural trials

530
00:22:32,019 --> 00:22:37,000
that's really what we focused on from

531
00:22:34,690 --> 00:22:40,000
the experimental condition to economic

532
00:22:37,000 --> 00:22:42,250
parties to the implements used for this

533
00:22:40,000 --> 00:22:46,899
practiced fertilizer and also to code

534
00:22:42,250 --> 00:22:49,419
measurements so as I said when we

535
00:22:46,899 --> 00:22:51,669
started a lot of ontology were already

536
00:22:49,419 --> 00:22:54,309
out there and that were and were

537
00:22:51,669 --> 00:22:56,500
covering part of the agronomy domain so

538
00:22:54,309 --> 00:22:58,480
what we wanted to do is not start from

539
00:22:56,500 --> 00:23:00,940
from scratch of course but what we want

540
00:22:58,480 --> 00:23:03,820
wanted to do is reuse terms that were

541
00:23:00,940 --> 00:23:06,519
directly relevant to to an agronomy

542
00:23:03,820 --> 00:23:09,039
ontology into like the economy ontology

543
00:23:06,519 --> 00:23:10,960
and being only the classes and the terms

544
00:23:09,039 --> 00:23:13,510
or add only the classes and the terms

545
00:23:10,960 --> 00:23:17,200
that were really like specific to the

546
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:19,720
economy domain so how did we so when we

547
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:22,659
started we started from this basic form

548
00:23:19,720 --> 00:23:25,990
an ontology that is really like the glue

549
00:23:22,659 --> 00:23:28,360
to to to murder and to align together

550
00:23:25,990 --> 00:23:31,059
all the pieces and all this different

551
00:23:28,360 --> 00:23:32,919
domain into the economy ontology because

552
00:23:31,059 --> 00:23:35,500
the BFO is providing like the common

553
00:23:32,919 --> 00:23:37,870
semantics that all these anthologies are

554
00:23:35,500 --> 00:23:40,210
are using some

555
00:23:37,870 --> 00:23:43,240
we also have used like the chemical

556
00:23:40,210 --> 00:23:44,920
ontology KB for everything all the

557
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:47,200
chemical entities that we needed like

558
00:23:44,920 --> 00:23:50,800
some fertilizer or chemical that I

559
00:23:47,200 --> 00:23:52,570
applied during an experiment we reused

560
00:23:50,800 --> 00:23:55,270
like the environment on Karrueche for

561
00:23:52,570 --> 00:23:57,100
everything related to environment where

562
00:23:55,270 --> 00:23:59,530
I used like the full ontology because

563
00:23:57,100 --> 00:24:01,809
sometimes some food that derived of food

564
00:23:59,530 --> 00:24:04,210
products can be used at 30 right so as

565
00:24:01,809 --> 00:24:06,430
well we'll use the OB ontology for

566
00:24:04,210 --> 00:24:09,910
everything related to studio designs and

567
00:24:06,430 --> 00:24:12,190
protocols really use the pet ontology

568
00:24:09,910 --> 00:24:13,679
for like qualities what we call

569
00:24:12,190 --> 00:24:16,150
qualities that are really like

570
00:24:13,679 --> 00:24:18,790
components that are like the main

571
00:24:16,150 --> 00:24:21,190
component of like the variables that are

572
00:24:18,790 --> 00:24:23,309
coding in the fields so that's gonna

573
00:24:21,190 --> 00:24:26,860
give like semantics to describe these

574
00:24:23,309 --> 00:24:28,630
variables we use like the plant

575
00:24:26,860 --> 00:24:31,350
experimental and condition ontology

576
00:24:28,630 --> 00:24:34,110
because it lists like at least a lot of

577
00:24:31,350 --> 00:24:36,400
biotic treatments and going conditions

578
00:24:34,110 --> 00:24:38,559
we reuse of course like the unit

579
00:24:36,400 --> 00:24:42,100
ontology because as Mira said we want to

580
00:24:38,559 --> 00:24:45,750
to annotate like datasets and so the

581
00:24:42,100 --> 00:24:48,309
unit's exam is a big part of that and

582
00:24:45,750 --> 00:24:50,950
finally because we focused like the

583
00:24:48,309 --> 00:24:53,860
ontology at least for now more unlike

584
00:24:50,950 --> 00:24:55,990
the plants we reuse like the plant

585
00:24:53,860 --> 00:24:58,030
ontology for everything to get a

586
00:24:55,990 --> 00:24:59,830
question like the prom part that

587
00:24:58,030 --> 00:25:02,470
obviously do a thing like that from the

588
00:24:59,830 --> 00:25:05,050
peel and we reuse like the chihwan a cop

589
00:25:02,470 --> 00:25:08,290
ontology for the phenotypic traits and

590
00:25:05,050 --> 00:25:11,500
and enviable that I can be recorded

591
00:25:08,290 --> 00:25:15,670
during the experiment and so all of

592
00:25:11,500 --> 00:25:18,040
these domain yeah integrated nicely in

593
00:25:15,670 --> 00:25:20,920
the economy ontology and then we focused

594
00:25:18,040 --> 00:25:22,540
our efforts on describing terms that

595
00:25:20,920 --> 00:25:27,220
were really specific to the economy

596
00:25:22,540 --> 00:25:28,990
ontology so now I'm gonna explain a bit

597
00:25:27,220 --> 00:25:30,760
like the different types of terms that

598
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:35,340
you're gonna find in the ontology and

599
00:25:30,760 --> 00:25:36,760
also how they how these terms are linked

600
00:25:35,340 --> 00:25:40,240
to each other

601
00:25:36,760 --> 00:25:42,480
so first the main element 3d of the

602
00:25:40,240 --> 00:25:45,130
economy ontology is this notion of

603
00:25:42,480 --> 00:25:48,400
magnitude to agricultural experiment our

604
00:25:45,130 --> 00:25:50,200
plot so this is in the plot or that can

605
00:25:48,400 --> 00:25:52,210
be like an entire feed that can be like

606
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:55,240
a product like in the

607
00:25:52,210 --> 00:25:57,639
in when you have a specific design that

608
00:25:55,240 --> 00:25:59,919
can be so really this notion of of plot

609
00:25:57,639 --> 00:26:02,980
is where you're gonna have like all the

610
00:25:59,919 --> 00:26:05,529
things happening and this brought in the

611
00:26:02,980 --> 00:26:07,750
ontology so this term or class in the

612
00:26:05,529 --> 00:26:10,899
ontology is linked to different concepts

613
00:26:07,750 --> 00:26:12,970
so this plot is thing it's an object and

614
00:26:10,899 --> 00:26:15,760
is linked of close to the agricultural

615
00:26:12,970 --> 00:26:18,850
experiment it is also linked as you can

616
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:21,549
see here two things that can be measured

617
00:26:18,850 --> 00:26:24,580
on that plot like like the lands or the

618
00:26:21,549 --> 00:26:28,630
area so and then on that plot something

619
00:26:24,580 --> 00:26:31,120
happened so you plant a cob and then you

620
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:32,710
have a certain type of of terms that we

621
00:26:31,120 --> 00:26:34,960
have any ontology that are going to be

622
00:26:32,710 --> 00:26:37,659
processes so you know I represent it

623
00:26:34,960 --> 00:26:39,370
like a planting process and a new

624
00:26:37,659 --> 00:26:42,039
process is really like everything that

625
00:26:39,370 --> 00:26:44,980
is time-bound so he has a start it has

626
00:26:42,039 --> 00:26:47,320
an end and then you can see on the the

627
00:26:44,980 --> 00:26:49,090
the schema here that the element that

628
00:26:47,320 --> 00:26:51,190
are linked to a process are defined from

629
00:26:49,090 --> 00:26:55,210
the element that are linked to like

630
00:26:51,190 --> 00:26:57,429
objects or entities so here for each

631
00:26:55,210 --> 00:26:59,980
process you're going to find find like a

632
00:26:57,429 --> 00:27:02,320
list of what we call participants so

633
00:26:59,980 --> 00:27:04,149
this participant can be like tools like

634
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:06,549
you can see it or it can be like the

635
00:27:04,149 --> 00:27:08,110
seed that is used like that you use all

636
00:27:06,549 --> 00:27:10,929
the cop like the seed of the cob that

637
00:27:08,110 --> 00:27:13,419
you use during your grunting process and

638
00:27:10,929 --> 00:27:16,620
then this way you can use the ontology

639
00:27:13,419 --> 00:27:19,809
to describe what is happening like

640
00:27:16,620 --> 00:27:21,399
during over time in your plot then you

641
00:27:19,809 --> 00:27:24,309
can have like for instance an ergonomic

642
00:27:21,399 --> 00:27:26,230
fertilization process happening so this

643
00:27:24,309 --> 00:27:28,240
is the the two types of terms so the

644
00:27:26,230 --> 00:27:31,600
processes and then the object that we

645
00:27:28,240 --> 00:27:34,120
redefine in the ontology and her all of

646
00:27:31,600 --> 00:27:36,909
this is linked together so now I'm going

647
00:27:34,120 --> 00:27:39,880
to get a little bit on in the economy

648
00:27:36,909 --> 00:27:42,159
like the ontology structure so as I said

649
00:27:39,880 --> 00:27:44,470
at the beginning our goal was to

650
00:27:42,159 --> 00:27:47,169
describe agricultural experiment

651
00:27:44,470 --> 00:27:49,600
so this agricultural experiment photos

652
00:27:47,169 --> 00:27:52,049
like a design soil it's completely

653
00:27:49,600 --> 00:27:54,340
randomized design and this economy

654
00:27:52,049 --> 00:27:56,260
experimental curves and in this cycle

655
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:58,029
could draw an experimental plot so

656
00:27:56,260 --> 00:28:00,370
that's gonna be like the the main

657
00:27:58,029 --> 00:28:02,529
element as I said before and then

658
00:28:00,370 --> 00:28:05,140
something happen also in this product

659
00:28:02,529 --> 00:28:07,930
like this fertilization process

660
00:28:05,140 --> 00:28:09,970
and and this fertilization process I

661
00:28:07,930 --> 00:28:12,160
started to say before it cannot like

662
00:28:09,970 --> 00:28:14,110
participant that are likely that is

663
00:28:12,160 --> 00:28:16,390
really the two that you are using during

664
00:28:14,110 --> 00:28:18,040
your 30-day the fertilization process so

665
00:28:16,390 --> 00:28:21,040
here you're going to use like a manual

666
00:28:18,040 --> 00:28:22,450
spreader for instance this process is

667
00:28:21,040 --> 00:28:24,880
also like a different type of

668
00:28:22,450 --> 00:28:26,920
participants so it's gonna be like the

669
00:28:24,880 --> 00:28:29,710
fertilizer itself that you are using and

670
00:28:26,920 --> 00:28:32,860
here you can see that is that this

671
00:28:29,710 --> 00:28:34,240
limestone is not coming from the economy

672
00:28:32,860 --> 00:28:36,150
ontology but is coming from the

673
00:28:34,240 --> 00:28:38,830
environment ontology

674
00:28:36,150 --> 00:28:41,680
so this is how we link like the

675
00:28:38,830 --> 00:28:43,810
different domain together and then what

676
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:45,610
is really important in when we do like

677
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:47,710
this fertilization process is to know

678
00:28:45,610 --> 00:28:50,350
like the the amount of fertilizer that

679
00:28:47,710 --> 00:28:52,030
we're gonna apply in the field and so we

680
00:28:50,350 --> 00:28:54,160
have like this you know the night you

681
00:28:52,030 --> 00:28:56,140
know then fertilizer amount class in the

682
00:28:54,160 --> 00:28:59,410
ontology and then that is linked also to

683
00:28:56,140 --> 00:29:02,650
an external term and then to a unit so

684
00:28:59,410 --> 00:29:05,560
this is like a simplified view I mean I

685
00:29:02,650 --> 00:29:08,260
just created one process and even like

686
00:29:05,560 --> 00:29:12,220
partially one describe one process but

687
00:29:08,260 --> 00:29:15,310
this is how like how the deontology is

688
00:29:12,220 --> 00:29:18,850
built an athenian is gonna explain later

689
00:29:15,310 --> 00:29:21,220
how you use like the the classes to tell

690
00:29:18,850 --> 00:29:23,050
your data but really once you you tell

691
00:29:21,220 --> 00:29:25,300
your data what you get is really like

692
00:29:23,050 --> 00:29:27,760
this entire graph thanks to the ontology

693
00:29:25,300 --> 00:29:32,920
and or the semantics that is really even

694
00:29:27,760 --> 00:29:34,450
between like all these these terms so

695
00:29:32,920 --> 00:29:36,340
now i'm just going to give you like a

696
00:29:34,450 --> 00:29:38,620
quick overview of things that you can

697
00:29:36,340 --> 00:29:40,420
find in in the economy ontology so as i

698
00:29:38,620 --> 00:29:43,930
said you're gonna find like different

699
00:29:40,420 --> 00:29:46,390
types of agricultural experiments that

700
00:29:43,930 --> 00:29:49,120
are like describe you're going to find

701
00:29:46,390 --> 00:29:51,670
like different agricultural processes so

702
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:54,400
we've seen like the branching process

703
00:29:51,670 --> 00:29:56,200
30 different process but also irrigation

704
00:29:54,400 --> 00:29:59,710
Arvest like you know long levering

705
00:29:56,200 --> 00:30:01,780
everything then you're going to find

706
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:03,640
these stuff like our actual implement

707
00:30:01,780 --> 00:30:06,790
that can be used like during these

708
00:30:03,640 --> 00:30:08,770
processes and finally you can you can

709
00:30:06,790 --> 00:30:11,410
also find like a list of of fertilizer

710
00:30:08,770 --> 00:30:13,660
like organic and inorganic fertilizer

711
00:30:11,410 --> 00:30:17,050
that that can be used during like a

712
00:30:13,660 --> 00:30:18,880
fertilization process and so that's just

713
00:30:17,050 --> 00:30:20,680
a quick overview of

714
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:23,050
things that we have in agronomy ontology

715
00:30:20,680 --> 00:30:26,440
and I really invite you to to look at

716
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:28,230
more into details of of the content

717
00:30:26,440 --> 00:30:32,610
because I mean I couldn't of course like

718
00:30:28,230 --> 00:30:32,610
yeah make a screenshot of everything

719
00:30:32,730 --> 00:30:38,190
so in terms of maintenance so we

720
00:30:35,490 --> 00:30:40,950
followed like the open zipper that are

721
00:30:38,190 --> 00:30:44,610
good very good practice to follow when

722
00:30:40,950 --> 00:30:48,120
you build ontology and so the ontology

723
00:30:44,610 --> 00:30:49,620
is open it's like open to everyone to

724
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:52,050
contribute

725
00:30:49,620 --> 00:30:54,450
it's like version control and everything

726
00:30:52,050 --> 00:30:56,520
so yeah all of that is listed in the

727
00:30:54,450 --> 00:31:00,930
over family point seeker that we are we

728
00:30:56,520 --> 00:31:04,650
followed for the ontology building

729
00:31:00,930 --> 00:31:06,720
itself we use like the Protege tool in

730
00:31:04,650 --> 00:31:10,200
addition of like the ontology

731
00:31:06,720 --> 00:31:12,540
development kit for dealing with all

732
00:31:10,200 --> 00:31:15,630
like the ontology development kit is

733
00:31:12,540 --> 00:31:18,210
like a suite of tools that we use for

734
00:31:15,630 --> 00:31:20,460
instance to deal with like reusing terms

735
00:31:18,210 --> 00:31:23,460
coming from external ontology in a very

736
00:31:20,460 --> 00:31:25,020
like in a very easy way so we don't have

737
00:31:23,460 --> 00:31:27,510
to maintain all of that like this

738
00:31:25,020 --> 00:31:28,350
ontology development kit take care of

739
00:31:27,510 --> 00:31:31,530
everything

740
00:31:28,350 --> 00:31:33,630
so make it's very easy to to to reduce

741
00:31:31,530 --> 00:31:35,490
external authorities and also to make

742
00:31:33,630 --> 00:31:35,910
release of the ontology and anything

743
00:31:35,490 --> 00:31:39,510
like that

744
00:31:35,910 --> 00:31:42,840
and finally the ontology ontology is to

745
00:31:39,510 --> 00:31:46,380
be shown on github you can find the link

746
00:31:42,840 --> 00:31:47,880
here and and we use github so for the

747
00:31:46,380 --> 00:31:50,310
publishing but also we have the issue

748
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:55,860
tracker on github and Cellini's gonna

749
00:31:50,310 --> 00:31:58,170
explain that a bit more later and then

750
00:31:55,860 --> 00:32:00,270
in terms of next steps or an ontology is

751
00:31:58,170 --> 00:32:03,210
never really finished so we are still

752
00:32:00,270 --> 00:32:07,800
looking at adding more content so it can

753
00:32:03,210 --> 00:32:09,570
be used like Bodley and so the one of

754
00:32:07,800 --> 00:32:12,600
the big tasks that we want to continue

755
00:32:09,570 --> 00:32:14,340
is like to to add more units of

756
00:32:12,600 --> 00:32:16,800
measurement that I released specific to

757
00:32:14,340 --> 00:32:19,440
the economy domain because sovereign the

758
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:21,060
unique that that I use are currently

759
00:32:19,440 --> 00:32:24,510
missing so that's really like something

760
00:32:21,060 --> 00:32:26,850
that would like to address and also we

761
00:32:24,510 --> 00:32:28,500
want to continue working with like the

762
00:32:26,850 --> 00:32:30,390
different external ontology and

763
00:32:28,500 --> 00:32:34,020
contribute to them in terms of terms

764
00:32:30,390 --> 00:32:36,360
that are like 11 for the economy domain

765
00:32:34,020 --> 00:32:40,290
for instance in terms of fertilizer we

766
00:32:36,360 --> 00:32:43,080
are diligently we I mean we we made the

767
00:32:40,290 --> 00:32:45,330
request to 2 KB to add some new

768
00:32:43,080 --> 00:32:46,530
fertilizer but also we are going to do

769
00:32:45,330 --> 00:32:49,190
that for involve

770
00:32:46,530 --> 00:32:53,520
we cannot like more so related terms or

771
00:32:49,190 --> 00:32:56,850
fertilizer even that can be be imported

772
00:32:53,520 --> 00:33:00,090
than in the economy ontology and finally

773
00:32:56,850 --> 00:33:02,940
we would like to to map I go with the

774
00:33:00,090 --> 00:33:04,830
cassava a bar so the cassava a birds are

775
00:33:02,940 --> 00:33:07,470
like variables that are widely used by

776
00:33:04,830 --> 00:33:10,200
caught murderers so we started looking

777
00:33:07,470 --> 00:33:13,490
at the Casa viable when viable when we

778
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:16,320
started like the agronomy ontology but

779
00:33:13,490 --> 00:33:18,390
so we have some of them but now we would

780
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:20,490
like to to like have a more

781
00:33:18,390 --> 00:33:21,900
comprehensive list of of this viable in

782
00:33:20,490 --> 00:33:24,330
in the ontology and be sure that

783
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:26,160
everything can be map easily so then

784
00:33:24,330 --> 00:33:28,110
when the data are notated using the

785
00:33:26,160 --> 00:33:31,050
ontology the code module can directly

786
00:33:28,110 --> 00:33:32,850
take the data and then use them more

787
00:33:31,050 --> 00:33:36,030
easily without spending time cleaning

788
00:33:32,850 --> 00:33:37,800
the data and all of that so yes so

789
00:33:36,030 --> 00:33:40,920
that's that's all for me

790
00:33:37,800 --> 00:33:42,540
great thank you so much Mary so yes we

791
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:44,580
have made it has given us a

792
00:33:42,540 --> 00:33:47,100
comprehensive overview of the agro

793
00:33:44,580 --> 00:33:49,890
themes and you have given us the

794
00:33:47,100 --> 00:33:52,200
overview and insights into a girl and

795
00:33:49,890 --> 00:33:54,510
now Selene is going to give us kind of

796
00:33:52,200 --> 00:33:57,060
the link and in some of those more

797
00:33:54,510 --> 00:33:58,940
specific ideas and concepts that you

798
00:33:57,060 --> 00:34:01,590
referred to both in your in your

799
00:33:58,940 --> 00:34:03,810
presentation so now Alberta Cellino that

800
00:34:01,590 --> 00:34:07,190
who is an agro curator a guru of beams

801
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:09,120
coordinator and consultant at if

802
00:34:07,190 --> 00:34:10,470
pre-high I think you a man hello

803
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:14,010
everyone

804
00:34:10,470 --> 00:34:16,169
so yeah as Mary told you she has

805
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:20,040
presented in detail what is a grew and

806
00:34:16,169 --> 00:34:22,169
what is its content and so now I will

807
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:25,320
tell you a bit more where to find a

808
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:27,720
group first and then how it uses so to

809
00:34:25,320 --> 00:34:30,540
browse over download a grow you have

810
00:34:27,720 --> 00:34:34,080
different options but the first one is

811
00:34:30,540 --> 00:34:35,610
to go on the agro web page so in the web

812
00:34:34,080 --> 00:34:38,640
page you will find all the information

813
00:34:35,610 --> 00:34:41,550
about the ontology you have also the

814
00:34:38,640 --> 00:34:45,480
contact and you have the possibility to

815
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:48,450
browse or download agro you can also go

816
00:34:45,480 --> 00:34:50,700
on the ontology lookup service of EBI I

817
00:34:48,450 --> 00:34:52,830
have to mention that maybe the OLS is

818
00:34:50,700 --> 00:34:55,440
going through maintenance and sever

819
00:34:52,830 --> 00:34:57,510
migration so by a consequent the

820
00:34:55,440 --> 00:34:59,580
ontology has not been updated there

821
00:34:57,510 --> 00:35:00,150
because they stopped doing updates

822
00:34:59,580 --> 00:35:02,250
during mint

823
00:35:00,150 --> 00:35:07,500
but everything should be back to normal

824
00:35:02,250 --> 00:35:10,140
by Aprill twenties you can also use a

825
00:35:07,500 --> 00:35:12,720
group bottle it's a platform the blood

826
00:35:10,140 --> 00:35:16,740
by the Liam and it's gathering a

827
00:35:12,720 --> 00:35:20,220
different origin in agriculture and agro

828
00:35:16,740 --> 00:35:22,950
is also available in on Toby and finally

829
00:35:20,220 --> 00:35:26,309
you can also go to github and download

830
00:35:22,950 --> 00:35:28,109
aggro on your laptop so you can choose

831
00:35:26,309 --> 00:35:32,309
the tool you are the more familiar with

832
00:35:28,109 --> 00:35:36,180
and so now I will show you how you can

833
00:35:32,309 --> 00:35:38,520
use OLS EBI that is well available

834
00:35:36,180 --> 00:35:40,770
directly on the website of the OLS or

835
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:44,309
you can also find it on a grower web

836
00:35:40,770 --> 00:35:46,410
page on the OLS you can use the search

837
00:35:44,309 --> 00:35:50,460
box to directly type the term you are

838
00:35:46,410 --> 00:35:56,130
looking for and so then the others will

839
00:35:50,460 --> 00:35:59,579
give you a list of available terms if

840
00:35:56,130 --> 00:36:01,770
you are a bit more adventurous and you

841
00:35:59,579 --> 00:36:05,190
want to explore your year key you can

842
00:36:01,770 --> 00:36:06,690
directly type into the ontology tree and

843
00:36:05,190 --> 00:36:09,690
look at their different classes and

844
00:36:06,690 --> 00:36:13,619
subclasses so here you can see the

845
00:36:09,690 --> 00:36:15,539
different tillage process we have so you

846
00:36:13,619 --> 00:36:18,180
don't only see the rich tool but you can

847
00:36:15,539 --> 00:36:21,210
still see mulch the strip till and to

848
00:36:18,180 --> 00:36:23,099
differentiate aki and on the right side

849
00:36:21,210 --> 00:36:28,170
you can also see the different relation

850
00:36:23,099 --> 00:36:31,880
between the classes so once you serve

851
00:36:28,170 --> 00:36:36,180
like the term that you are interested in

852
00:36:31,880 --> 00:36:38,609
you will have a definition of the term

853
00:36:36,180 --> 00:36:41,940
with the reference to this definition

854
00:36:38,609 --> 00:36:43,710
you as I say you have also the the

855
00:36:41,940 --> 00:36:47,160
relation of this term with the other

856
00:36:43,710 --> 00:36:51,690
classes of the anthology and you will

857
00:36:47,160 --> 00:36:54,059
find a UI I so this URI is an identifier

858
00:36:51,690 --> 00:36:57,440
that is unique for each ontology term

859
00:36:54,059 --> 00:37:02,180
and so this is what you will use to

860
00:36:57,440 --> 00:37:04,410
annotate your document your data so

861
00:37:02,180 --> 00:37:07,559
basically what you will do is copy paste

862
00:37:04,410 --> 00:37:11,099
this URL in your file in your excel file

863
00:37:07,559 --> 00:37:13,200
or database to link your data with the

864
00:37:11,099 --> 00:37:15,420
ontology

865
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:17,460
and so you will have to follow the same

866
00:37:15,420 --> 00:37:20,220
schema looking in the ontology for each

867
00:37:17,460 --> 00:37:23,970
term and copy pasting them in your file

868
00:37:20,220 --> 00:37:26,540
for each of your term so this is quite

869
00:37:23,970 --> 00:37:29,700
cumbersome and time-consuming exercise

870
00:37:26,540 --> 00:37:33,990
but luckily there are some tools to help

871
00:37:29,700 --> 00:37:37,560
you in this task so the first tool I

872
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:40,830
will talk about is capo you might have

873
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:43,680
heard about it already it's a portal

874
00:37:40,830 --> 00:37:50,520
link to ontology that is the description

875
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:53,220
of the data of with ontologies so when

876
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:56,190
you go to capo first you upload your

877
00:37:53,220 --> 00:37:59,370
file so here i've uploaded an excel file

878
00:37:56,190 --> 00:38:02,100
and capo this is displaying the

879
00:37:59,370 --> 00:38:06,090
different columns of my file you can see

880
00:38:02,100 --> 00:38:09,420
them here so i've selected your first

881
00:38:06,090 --> 00:38:13,320
column the root fresh weight and then i

882
00:38:09,420 --> 00:38:16,200
go to the search box type the name of my

883
00:38:13,320 --> 00:38:19,140
term and then capo will look into the

884
00:38:16,200 --> 00:38:22,170
difference oncologist what is the

885
00:38:19,140 --> 00:38:24,090
closest term to the one i'm looking so

886
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:26,130
you can look at the different terms and

887
00:38:24,090 --> 00:38:29,520
the definition and then you select the

888
00:38:26,130 --> 00:38:31,470
one that you are interested in it will

889
00:38:29,520 --> 00:38:34,230
be saved here and capo might directly

890
00:38:31,470 --> 00:38:38,220
make the link between this term and your

891
00:38:34,230 --> 00:38:39,750
column in your file and so you do this

892
00:38:38,220 --> 00:38:43,320
for all the different column of your

893
00:38:39,750 --> 00:38:46,460
file and at the end you can export all

894
00:38:43,320 --> 00:38:49,680
the different annotation as a JSON file

895
00:38:46,460 --> 00:38:52,020
so this is a great tool to help you

896
00:38:49,680 --> 00:38:55,620
annotate data file that are already

897
00:38:52,020 --> 00:38:57,680
created because cocoa create the links

898
00:38:55,620 --> 00:39:00,680
between your file and the ontologies

899
00:38:57,680 --> 00:39:00,680
directly

900
00:39:01,740 --> 00:39:06,960
if you have not yet collected your data

901
00:39:04,580 --> 00:39:10,080
there is a great tool that I can

902
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:13,050
recommend to use directly at the start

903
00:39:10,080 --> 00:39:18,380
of your agronomic experiment and it's

904
00:39:13,050 --> 00:39:20,520
well a griffin's so midde already

905
00:39:18,380 --> 00:39:23,970
demonstrated the different step to

906
00:39:20,520 --> 00:39:26,310
follow to create a fill book ready to

907
00:39:23,970 --> 00:39:29,580
collect agronomic data using mobile

908
00:39:26,310 --> 00:39:32,280
device and so once you have collected

909
00:39:29,580 --> 00:39:34,589
your data with your mobile device you

910
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:36,660
will get a file like this one with

911
00:39:34,589 --> 00:39:39,359
annotation in the column headers like

912
00:39:36,660 --> 00:39:43,500
here you can see you have the UI of a

913
00:39:39,359 --> 00:39:46,800
group and so the annotation are

914
00:39:43,500 --> 00:39:49,830
automatically done without any

915
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:51,960
additional additional work from you so

916
00:39:49,830 --> 00:39:56,310
you don't need to look for each term in

917
00:39:51,960 --> 00:39:59,960
the ontology this feature is currently

918
00:39:56,310 --> 00:40:03,150
under development with maje we are

919
00:39:59,960 --> 00:40:06,420
adding the last missing term in a grow

920
00:40:03,150 --> 00:40:09,720
to be able to create this automatic link

921
00:40:06,420 --> 00:40:13,680
between a graphemes and the ontology it

922
00:40:09,720 --> 00:40:17,040
should be completed by the rider or in

923
00:40:13,680 --> 00:40:20,849
the coming months and so this will be an

924
00:40:17,040 --> 00:40:24,599
easy way to create data file that well

925
00:40:20,849 --> 00:40:27,450
annotated for the data but also for the

926
00:40:24,599 --> 00:40:28,859
metadata and without additional work for

927
00:40:27,450 --> 00:40:31,609
you are looking in the different

928
00:40:28,859 --> 00:40:31,609
anthologies

929
00:40:32,330 --> 00:40:42,230
so I hope our presentation gets you

930
00:40:37,310 --> 00:40:43,460
motivated to use aggro you can find a

931
00:40:42,230 --> 00:40:46,300
group we have the different platforms

932
00:40:43,460 --> 00:40:51,290
that I shared with you in the chat box

933
00:40:46,300 --> 00:40:52,730
and so once you use a group please feel

934
00:40:51,290 --> 00:40:55,760
free to send us your feedback and

935
00:40:52,730 --> 00:40:58,820
ontology is a collaborative tool that is

936
00:40:55,760 --> 00:41:00,680
always evolving so if you are looking

937
00:40:58,820 --> 00:41:02,840
for a term and you don't find it or

938
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:05,360
maybe you'd like to discuss the new

939
00:41:02,840 --> 00:41:08,180
Yaqui or provide any type of feedback

940
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:11,540
feel free to open an issue on github

941
00:41:08,180 --> 00:41:14,540
issue tracker and we'll get into contact

942
00:41:11,540 --> 00:41:16,910
with you so if you never use github you

943
00:41:14,540 --> 00:41:19,490
can well follow the link that I shared

944
00:41:16,910 --> 00:41:21,860
with you and then you go to the issues

945
00:41:19,490 --> 00:41:24,080
and you will find you don't see it in

946
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:28,400
the picture but you will find here like

947
00:41:24,080 --> 00:41:30,830
new issues and so then you just say in

948
00:41:28,400 --> 00:41:32,690
the comment whatever you whatever your

949
00:41:30,830 --> 00:41:35,960
feedback is and then we'd get in contact

950
00:41:32,690 --> 00:41:38,630
with you so finally I would like to

951
00:41:35,960 --> 00:41:42,260
thank the people that I have contributed

952
00:41:38,630 --> 00:41:45,470
to I grow by giving us super hoods and

953
00:41:42,260 --> 00:41:49,820
feedback the ontology would not be so

954
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:51,470
strong without the advice so thank you

955
00:41:49,820 --> 00:41:54,020
very much for your attention and I hope

956
00:41:51,470 --> 00:41:55,100
I grow and Agri films will be useful for

957
00:41:54,020 --> 00:41:57,650
your research

958
00:41:55,100 --> 00:42:00,080
please feel free to contact us if you

959
00:41:57,650 --> 00:42:03,260
like to get some supports when you are

960
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:05,750
using them Thank You Celine and just

961
00:42:03,260 --> 00:42:07,130
just for clarification if people want to

962
00:42:05,750 --> 00:42:09,230
get in contact should they get in

963
00:42:07,130 --> 00:42:12,380
contact with you Celine or would it be

964
00:42:09,230 --> 00:42:14,870
any three of you if it's a question more

965
00:42:12,380 --> 00:42:17,060
related to deontology they can get in

966
00:42:14,870 --> 00:42:19,760
contact with Marie angelic and myself

967
00:42:17,060 --> 00:42:21,710
and if the question is related to a

968
00:42:19,760 --> 00:42:25,640
Griffins it's better to get in contact

969
00:42:21,710 --> 00:42:26,270
with Smita and myself okay great thank

970
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:28,850
you so much

971
00:42:26,270 --> 00:42:31,880
Celine and and so now we are at our

972
00:42:28,850 --> 00:42:34,820
question and answer and comments session

973
00:42:31,880 --> 00:42:38,630
for the webinar today so maybe we go to

974
00:42:34,820 --> 00:42:40,880
Elizabeth for your first question yeah

975
00:42:38,630 --> 00:42:43,400
thank you for the demonstration of ago

976
00:42:40,880 --> 00:42:45,140
themes and my question was people they

977
00:42:43,400 --> 00:42:46,130
need to create parameters or new

978
00:42:45,140 --> 00:42:50,839
variables on the

979
00:42:46,130 --> 00:42:53,809
priced at lots we know that so how how

980
00:42:50,839 --> 00:42:56,509
do you make sure that those new

981
00:42:53,809 --> 00:42:59,960
parameters and variables created in a

982
00:42:56,509 --> 00:43:02,180
graphing by the users can be feedback to

983
00:42:59,960 --> 00:43:06,559
the ergonomic Raji what would be the

984
00:43:02,180 --> 00:43:09,200
process at currently and what could be

985
00:43:06,559 --> 00:43:13,369
done in the future to make the

986
00:43:09,200 --> 00:43:16,339
submission more seamless thank you so

987
00:43:13,369 --> 00:43:19,730
right now the the way you submit things

988
00:43:16,339 --> 00:43:22,819
that are not in that you cannot find in

989
00:43:19,730 --> 00:43:24,680
in the ontology is first of all you you

990
00:43:22,819 --> 00:43:28,039
try to describe something you're doing

991
00:43:24,680 --> 00:43:30,980
in the field if it's not there and you

992
00:43:28,039 --> 00:43:32,869
can't sort of compromise and use what

993
00:43:30,980 --> 00:43:36,730
whatever is there that doesn't meet your

994
00:43:32,869 --> 00:43:40,039
needs then you would choose the other

995
00:43:36,730 --> 00:43:42,079
part the other the other sort of feature

996
00:43:40,039 --> 00:43:44,750
of the of most of these pick lists and

997
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:49,099
add what it is that you want now once

998
00:43:44,750 --> 00:43:50,750
that's added we will we will hopefully

999
00:43:49,099 --> 00:43:52,819
be able to see it we haven't actually

1000
00:43:50,750 --> 00:43:55,009
engineered the links right now that that

1001
00:43:52,819 --> 00:43:57,829
provides a little alert for us or that

1002
00:43:55,009 --> 00:44:01,400
put that term as an automatic sort of

1003
00:43:57,829 --> 00:44:02,750
issue into the into the github but we're

1004
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:05,029
gonna have to wait we're gonna have to

1005
00:44:02,750 --> 00:44:07,609
see what what is possible with the

1006
00:44:05,029 --> 00:44:09,349
developers if that's possible and that

1007
00:44:07,609 --> 00:44:11,180
would be one way that we catch what the

1008
00:44:09,349 --> 00:44:16,759
issue is and can get in touch with

1009
00:44:11,180 --> 00:44:18,559
whoever has wants it to make sure that

1010
00:44:16,759 --> 00:44:21,650
we understand correctly before we create

1011
00:44:18,559 --> 00:44:24,259
a new concept and an integral for it or

1012
00:44:21,650 --> 00:44:25,670
we look for a matching concept in

1013
00:44:24,259 --> 00:44:29,000
another ontology that we might have

1014
00:44:25,670 --> 00:44:31,150
missed so the short answer I guess is

1015
00:44:29,000 --> 00:44:33,380
that we don't have the processes already

1016
00:44:31,150 --> 00:44:36,619
available but we have some thoughts as

1017
00:44:33,380 --> 00:44:38,660
to as to how that can work and within

1018
00:44:36,619 --> 00:44:40,570
the next year or so we hope to to build

1019
00:44:38,660 --> 00:44:43,240
all of that out

1020
00:44:40,570 --> 00:44:47,260
there are other things that that we we

1021
00:44:43,240 --> 00:44:51,180
we also are trying to do that we see is

1022
00:44:47,260 --> 00:44:53,830
kind of very high priority in terms of

1023
00:44:51,180 --> 00:44:56,590
more improvements to the to the user

1024
00:44:53,830 --> 00:44:58,240
interface the accommodation of survey

1025
00:44:56,590 --> 00:45:01,030
type trials because that's something

1026
00:44:58,240 --> 00:45:03,460
that our users have asked of us very

1027
00:45:01,030 --> 00:45:05,560
large survey type trials multi

1028
00:45:03,460 --> 00:45:07,600
locational trials with thousands of

1029
00:45:05,560 --> 00:45:09,700
farmers right now Agri firms cannot

1030
00:45:07,600 --> 00:45:12,670
handle that very well so that we're

1031
00:45:09,700 --> 00:45:14,730
working on those bits first but

1032
00:45:12,670 --> 00:45:18,790
hopefully we will also be able to

1033
00:45:14,730 --> 00:45:20,470
address this issue of the feedback as we

1034
00:45:18,790 --> 00:45:22,930
go forward we also want to make sure

1035
00:45:20,470 --> 00:45:25,480
that we're not just enabling KT smart as

1036
00:45:22,930 --> 00:45:28,450
the digital collection tool we want to

1037
00:45:25,480 --> 00:45:31,570
also make sure that people can use ODK

1038
00:45:28,450 --> 00:45:33,640
open data kit and the field will gap as

1039
00:45:31,570 --> 00:45:36,310
well so that those are two pieces of

1040
00:45:33,640 --> 00:45:40,230
high priority development that will

1041
00:45:36,310 --> 00:45:40,230
happen in 2020

1042
00:45:40,260 --> 00:45:44,490
great think you made that we have

1043
00:45:42,090 --> 00:45:47,670
several more questions coming in you can

1044
00:45:44,490 --> 00:45:52,200
start off with a lantern bassoon my

1045
00:45:47,670 --> 00:45:57,900
question is from agrifim with respects

1046
00:45:52,200 --> 00:46:01,500
to using the KD smart data collection

1047
00:45:57,900 --> 00:46:08,280
tool Hadid it has been connected with

1048
00:46:01,500 --> 00:46:16,190
this hub how is the data obligated ready

1049
00:46:08,280 --> 00:46:20,100
start so the data is collected with your

1050
00:46:16,190 --> 00:46:21,600
KT smart application on your phone say

1051
00:46:20,100 --> 00:46:23,400
or your or your tablet

1052
00:46:21,600 --> 00:46:25,320
once you've finished collecting the data

1053
00:46:23,400 --> 00:46:26,970
you ship it back in the form of the

1054
00:46:25,320 --> 00:46:29,760
field book essentially an excel field

1055
00:46:26,970 --> 00:46:32,370
book back to algorithms you can do your

1056
00:46:29,760 --> 00:46:34,380
statistical analysis and you can either

1057
00:46:32,370 --> 00:46:38,640
download the data and store it locally

1058
00:46:34,380 --> 00:46:42,210
or you can it's stored in the server and

1059
00:46:38,640 --> 00:46:43,590
you can you can play with it there one

1060
00:46:42,210 --> 00:46:48,390
of the things that we want to also

1061
00:46:43,590 --> 00:46:51,710
enable is the the ability to to try and

1062
00:46:48,390 --> 00:46:53,970
enable sort of people to share the data

1063
00:46:51,710 --> 00:46:55,650
and now with the implementation of

1064
00:46:53,970 --> 00:46:58,790
Globus across CGR

1065
00:46:55,650 --> 00:47:02,160
I would like to see whether we can bring

1066
00:46:58,790 --> 00:47:03,930
somehow tie algorithms to to Guardian

1067
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:07,290
more tightly so that the Guardian now

1068
00:47:03,930 --> 00:47:09,480
has CG labs collaborative Guardian labs

1069
00:47:07,290 --> 00:47:12,630
which allow not only searching of the

1070
00:47:09,480 --> 00:47:14,430
data but but secure sharing and and

1071
00:47:12,630 --> 00:47:16,920
transferring of data as well as

1072
00:47:14,430 --> 00:47:18,840
collaborative analysis of the data and

1073
00:47:16,920 --> 00:47:20,580
the development of scripts and all of

1074
00:47:18,840 --> 00:47:22,590
that so it's it's a kind of a

1075
00:47:20,580 --> 00:47:26,820
full-service solution and so if we can

1076
00:47:22,590 --> 00:47:29,990
tie a graph ends and and CG labs closely

1077
00:47:26,820 --> 00:47:33,450
together then that data can be stored on

1078
00:47:29,990 --> 00:47:35,790
the CG lab server and it'll be a secure

1079
00:47:33,450 --> 00:47:37,950
transfer or insecure sharing that's

1080
00:47:35,790 --> 00:47:41,100
that's behind that with Globus putting

1081
00:47:37,950 --> 00:47:43,950
the stamp on it and Globus is HIPAA

1082
00:47:41,100 --> 00:47:48,000
certified so that it's it it conforms to

1083
00:47:43,950 --> 00:47:50,040
the very very high levels of privacy

1084
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:52,110
private data sharing secure data sharing

1085
00:47:50,040 --> 00:47:53,880
that's required in the medical domain

1086
00:47:52,110 --> 00:47:58,650
HIPPA has an Americans

1087
00:47:53,880 --> 00:48:01,440
but it basically allows you it tells you

1088
00:47:58,650 --> 00:48:05,750
that that data sharing will be secure

1089
00:48:01,440 --> 00:48:05,750
does that answer your question Busan

1090
00:48:06,820 --> 00:48:16,270
yes I mean yes I say have some little

1091
00:48:12,270 --> 00:48:21,550
concern in the sense that I know that

1092
00:48:16,270 --> 00:48:23,950
some scientists on some projects all

1093
00:48:21,550 --> 00:48:28,540
right I want to have the data exclusive

1094
00:48:23,950 --> 00:48:30,610
to themselves during the life span I

1095
00:48:28,540 --> 00:48:33,070
mean they'd like the active life of the

1096
00:48:30,610 --> 00:48:36,040
project until when I said we do not

1097
00:48:33,070 --> 00:48:37,990
mandate that the data should be open

1098
00:48:36,040 --> 00:48:40,300
they can do that they can download the

1099
00:48:37,990 --> 00:48:42,850
data and and that that will be fine you

1100
00:48:40,300 --> 00:48:45,730
know then it's residing on their laptop

1101
00:48:42,850 --> 00:48:47,170
until they choose to make it until the

1102
00:48:45,730 --> 00:48:50,050
choose to upload it to the institutional

1103
00:48:47,170 --> 00:48:51,970
repository for example but if they

1104
00:48:50,050 --> 00:48:55,600
choose to work in CG labs that is a

1105
00:48:51,970 --> 00:48:57,970
secure environment so just just CG labs

1106
00:48:55,600 --> 00:49:00,460
is something you know CGIAR has not

1107
00:48:57,970 --> 00:49:02,620
heard very much about because it's very

1108
00:49:00,460 --> 00:49:06,220
hot off the presses but that'll be

1109
00:49:02,620 --> 00:49:10,120
coming as well that webinar on that will

1110
00:49:06,220 --> 00:49:12,190
be coming soon great think you made that

1111
00:49:10,120 --> 00:49:15,390
thank you for for that question as well

1112
00:49:12,190 --> 00:49:17,980
though the next question is from Khaled

1113
00:49:15,390 --> 00:49:20,050
presentation my question is about is

1114
00:49:17,980 --> 00:49:23,290
there any kind of integration currently

1115
00:49:20,050 --> 00:49:26,310
done between your team and the breeding

1116
00:49:23,290 --> 00:49:29,920
management system from IPP in terms of

1117
00:49:26,310 --> 00:49:32,620
unify the ontology and and something

1118
00:49:29,920 --> 00:49:33,340
like that yeah that's a good question as

1119
00:49:32,620 --> 00:49:37,060
well

1120
00:49:33,340 --> 00:49:39,850
so so we started out actually looking at

1121
00:49:37,060 --> 00:49:41,830
the BMS to see if there was a way in

1122
00:49:39,850 --> 00:49:44,400
which we could modify the BMS in some

1123
00:49:41,830 --> 00:49:46,840
way to make it available also for

1124
00:49:44,400 --> 00:49:48,970
agronomist and and confer or not

1125
00:49:46,840 --> 00:49:51,460
confirmed but but you know appropriate

1126
00:49:48,970 --> 00:49:54,400
for agronomist but the issue there was

1127
00:49:51,460 --> 00:49:58,180
that the breeders are very much focused

1128
00:49:54,400 --> 00:49:59,950
on germ plasm whereas agronomists I

1129
00:49:58,180 --> 00:50:01,900
won't say they don't care about the germ

1130
00:49:59,950 --> 00:50:04,180
plasm but that's not the focus of what

1131
00:50:01,900 --> 00:50:06,640
they do it's it's more the the

1132
00:50:04,180 --> 00:50:09,040
management and so we couldn't find a way

1133
00:50:06,640 --> 00:50:12,790
to sort of make it appropriate for both

1134
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:16,510
and and where the integration now is is

1135
00:50:12,790 --> 00:50:19,330
the fact that the ontology provides that

1136
00:50:16,510 --> 00:50:20,170
ability to to crosswalk across the tooth

1137
00:50:19,330 --> 00:50:25,270
so

1138
00:50:20,170 --> 00:50:27,940
there's there's the potential for once

1139
00:50:25,270 --> 00:50:31,180
you have the data actually then you can

1140
00:50:27,940 --> 00:50:33,040
sort of start to do some more seamless

1141
00:50:31,180 --> 00:50:34,600
integration between breeding data and

1142
00:50:33,040 --> 00:50:37,750
agronomic data because they're both

1143
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:40,350
reliant on ontologies that's that's the

1144
00:50:37,750 --> 00:50:44,530
level of integration there is right now

1145
00:50:40,350 --> 00:50:46,210
yeah and also I would add to on that I

1146
00:50:44,530 --> 00:50:49,150
mean we have been discussing with the

1147
00:50:46,210 --> 00:50:51,970
technical team of the BMS to see how the

1148
00:50:49,150 --> 00:50:54,010
cue implement also the economy ontology

1149
00:50:51,970 --> 00:50:56,260
terms particularly on the experimental

1150
00:50:54,010 --> 00:50:58,780
conditioning treatments into the systems

1151
00:50:56,260 --> 00:51:01,570
I mean for the cop on the part on the

1152
00:50:58,780 --> 00:51:03,850
cop measurement they are using like the

1153
00:51:01,570 --> 00:51:06,160
the cop ontology so that's fine I mean

1154
00:51:03,850 --> 00:51:08,560
these two part are going to be more or

1155
00:51:06,160 --> 00:51:11,560
less harmonized between like the economy

1156
00:51:08,560 --> 00:51:13,630
system and and the gradient management

1157
00:51:11,560 --> 00:51:14,770
system so that that's good although as

1158
00:51:13,630 --> 00:51:16,630
me I said I mean there are some

1159
00:51:14,770 --> 00:51:18,160
differences but like most of the terms

1160
00:51:16,630 --> 00:51:20,110
that are in comment would be implement

1161
00:51:18,160 --> 00:51:21,670
so that's already something good but

1162
00:51:20,110 --> 00:51:24,280
yeah we are in discussion with the

1163
00:51:21,670 --> 00:51:26,020
technical team also the BMS we are the

1164
00:51:24,280 --> 00:51:28,420
meeting recently to to show them like

1165
00:51:26,020 --> 00:51:30,220
the last advancement of of the economy

1166
00:51:28,420 --> 00:51:33,550
ontology to see how they could integrate

1167
00:51:30,220 --> 00:51:35,320
that in in that system we have a

1168
00:51:33,550 --> 00:51:37,810
question from Eddie and so the question

1169
00:51:35,320 --> 00:51:40,870
is on a grow what is the percentage of

1170
00:51:37,810 --> 00:51:43,240
terms reused from other ontology x' how

1171
00:51:40,870 --> 00:51:45,430
many new entries were added into a grow

1172
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:47,920
and how do you deal with updates when

1173
00:51:45,430 --> 00:51:51,480
other ontology x' sources of terms

1174
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:54,820
change percentage rostrum is about like

1175
00:51:51,480 --> 00:51:57,430
75 percent of the terms coming from

1176
00:51:54,820 --> 00:52:00,460
external anthologies and 25 percent of

1177
00:51:57,430 --> 00:52:04,270
jumps coming from from from ago directly

1178
00:52:00,460 --> 00:52:06,700
that we we created and so yeah there

1179
00:52:04,270 --> 00:52:09,760
there's about like 500 something terms

1180
00:52:06,700 --> 00:52:14,320
that we created like but only under the

1181
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:16,120
economy ontology namespace and how do we

1182
00:52:14,320 --> 00:52:18,010
deal with the update in external

1183
00:52:16,120 --> 00:52:21,040
ontology that's why we are using like

1184
00:52:18,010 --> 00:52:23,080
the ontology development kit

1185
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:25,630
suite of tools because that make that

1186
00:52:23,080 --> 00:52:27,880
very easy so every time we update the

1187
00:52:25,630 --> 00:52:31,090
economy ontology we just make sure to

1188
00:52:27,880 --> 00:52:32,740
unlike the script that's gonna check

1189
00:52:31,090 --> 00:52:34,029
that everything is still in place

1190
00:52:32,740 --> 00:52:36,009
sometime we find like

1191
00:52:34,029 --> 00:52:38,169
you know that some update might cause

1192
00:52:36,009 --> 00:52:40,719
issues in the economy ontology but then

1193
00:52:38,169 --> 00:52:42,849
we work on fixing that but yeah at the

1194
00:52:40,719 --> 00:52:45,249
end by using the tools that are very

1195
00:52:42,849 --> 00:52:48,009
like standards and while using the Oba

1196
00:52:45,249 --> 00:52:51,099
community we can do that like pretty

1197
00:52:48,009 --> 00:52:54,189
easily so so yeah so that's how we do

1198
00:52:51,099 --> 00:52:59,109
like to particularly true to build like

1199
00:52:54,189 --> 00:53:01,269
this this list of reuse Xterra where we

1200
00:52:59,109 --> 00:53:04,509
want to reuse external ontology terms

1201
00:53:01,269 --> 00:53:06,429
and one we are one add like terms that

1202
00:53:04,509 --> 00:53:10,809
we we don't have so that's also very

1203
00:53:06,429 --> 00:53:12,489
easy we just have a list of terms that

1204
00:53:10,809 --> 00:53:14,139
that we want so if someone make a

1205
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:16,839
request and say oh I want to add this

1206
00:53:14,139 --> 00:53:19,989
fertilizer for instance and but we don't

1207
00:53:16,839 --> 00:53:23,589
maintain really fertilizer in not gone

1208
00:53:19,989 --> 00:53:25,839
and it's like the inorganic one so we

1209
00:53:23,589 --> 00:53:26,889
will ask heavy to do it and then one

1210
00:53:25,839 --> 00:53:28,629
Skippy

1211
00:53:26,889 --> 00:53:31,089
I'd like the term then we are gonna

1212
00:53:28,629 --> 00:53:32,679
import it in in a go and really I mean

1213
00:53:31,089 --> 00:53:35,439
we did it like recently and that's

1214
00:53:32,679 --> 00:53:37,239
really yeah that works what well to do

1215
00:53:35,439 --> 00:53:39,069
like that because we cannot maintain

1216
00:53:37,239 --> 00:53:42,999
everything so it's easier to maintain

1217
00:53:39,069 --> 00:53:45,849
what is really directly relevant to the

1218
00:53:42,999 --> 00:53:47,949
economy domain and to let like the other

1219
00:53:45,849 --> 00:53:51,249
like expert to maintain like you know

1220
00:53:47,949 --> 00:53:55,649
list of chemicals or list of different

1221
00:53:51,249 --> 00:53:55,649
like by own so things like that

1222
00:53:55,679 --> 00:54:00,659
great thank you Mary we have another

1223
00:53:58,479 --> 00:54:03,729
question that came in actually through

1224
00:54:00,659 --> 00:54:06,789
LinkedIn chat platform and it's from

1225
00:54:03,729 --> 00:54:09,759
Kathy sled from data Co and the question

1226
00:54:06,789 --> 00:54:12,639
is I think specifically for Marie does a

1227
00:54:09,759 --> 00:54:14,949
grill include soil properties we are

1228
00:54:12,639 --> 00:54:16,029
working on a global soil information

1229
00:54:14,949 --> 00:54:20,759
system for file

1230
00:54:16,029 --> 00:54:26,010
I think soil properties is where we meet

1231
00:54:20,759 --> 00:54:30,320
yes so we import some so we have

1232
00:54:26,010 --> 00:54:32,760
a few properties in ago that are mainly

1233
00:54:30,320 --> 00:54:35,310
imported from the environment ontology

1234
00:54:32,760 --> 00:54:37,260
and I know that currently they are

1235
00:54:35,310 --> 00:54:39,900
working like they have a project to work

1236
00:54:37,260 --> 00:54:42,510
on that how to add like more muscle

1237
00:54:39,900 --> 00:54:43,320
properties into the the environment

1238
00:54:42,510 --> 00:54:44,820
ontology

1239
00:54:43,320 --> 00:54:47,250
so that's not something that we are

1240
00:54:44,820 --> 00:54:48,930
going to maintain ourselves but that's

1241
00:54:47,250 --> 00:54:52,260
something that we are going to be used

1242
00:54:48,930 --> 00:54:54,990
from this environment ontology and and I

1243
00:54:52,260 --> 00:55:00,240
mean be happy to two years with that the

1244
00:54:54,990 --> 00:55:01,860
environment ontology develop go to two

1245
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:05,340
year to provide like this feedback and

1246
00:55:01,860 --> 00:55:08,070
and say that sometimes might be needed

1247
00:55:05,340 --> 00:55:10,200
and then we can like import them or yeah

1248
00:55:08,070 --> 00:55:12,810
we use them in the economy ontology so

1249
00:55:10,200 --> 00:55:14,640
so so we have them but yeah we we don't

1250
00:55:12,810 --> 00:55:18,260
want to maintain mokopuna stop so

1251
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:18,260
properties ourselves

1252
00:55:19,190 --> 00:55:24,450
great Thank You Mari I don't see any

1253
00:55:22,499 --> 00:55:26,099
more questions coming in a lot of thank

1254
00:55:24,450 --> 00:55:28,380
yous thank you again for participating

1255
00:55:26,099 --> 00:55:31,999
and thank you again to the presenters I

1256
00:55:28,380 --> 00:55:34,349
think what will now do is wrap up and

1257
00:55:31,999 --> 00:55:36,480
again thank you to the three presenters

1258
00:55:34,349 --> 00:55:37,980
and those who have logged in today I'm

1259
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:39,660
going to hand it back over to Elizabeth

1260
00:55:37,980 --> 00:55:41,760
to just let us know

1261
00:55:39,660 --> 00:55:45,960
what's coming next

1262
00:55:41,760 --> 00:55:48,570
thank you a man so thank you for three

1263
00:55:45,960 --> 00:55:50,130
speakers for the very interesting and

1264
00:55:48,570 --> 00:55:52,680
informative presentation

1265
00:55:50,130 --> 00:55:55,140
I think it was super useful and it was a

1266
00:55:52,680 --> 00:55:57,450
successful webinar given the number of

1267
00:55:55,140 --> 00:56:00,300
attendees this was the second webinar of

1268
00:55:57,450 --> 00:56:03,540
the series about the community of

1269
00:56:00,300 --> 00:56:06,390
practice products we have an agenda in

1270
00:56:03,540 --> 00:56:09,570
fact already so we hope to get you

1271
00:56:06,390 --> 00:56:11,730
online for the next webinars thank you

1272
00:56:09,570 --> 00:56:14,190
very much thank you a man and Celine who

1273
00:56:11,730 --> 00:56:17,450
had me organizing this webinar and

1274
00:56:14,190 --> 00:56:17,450
thanks again to our speakers
