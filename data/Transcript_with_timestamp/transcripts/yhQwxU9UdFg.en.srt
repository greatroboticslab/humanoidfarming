let's give them all over welcome

19
00:01:18,920 --> 00:01:24,450
Corey Cronin Casey Cronin and we're

20
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:26,220
seeing such a big value in bringing

21
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:29,759
livestock into our farming operation

22
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:31,380
because it was a few years ago we

23
00:01:29,759 --> 00:01:34,590
decided that wasn't the thing we should

24
00:01:31,380 --> 00:01:37,200
do and now we're going to excuse me if

25
00:01:34,590 --> 00:01:39,000
you guys can't see but you know that

26
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:41,850
Casey and I are going to kind of

27
00:01:39,000 --> 00:01:44,039
tag-team this but you know and see the

28
00:01:41,850 --> 00:01:47,220
data on the bottom 2007 so we've been

29
00:01:44,039 --> 00:01:48,869
grazing the coverage since 2007 the more

30
00:01:47,220 --> 00:01:51,420
we learned the more questions we have

31
00:01:48,869 --> 00:01:53,159
we're trying to put cents to this in

32
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,679
dollars wise because that's what we

33
00:01:53,159 --> 00:01:57,149
really feel we have to do you can say

34
00:01:55,679 --> 00:02:02,250
whatever you want to do but it still

35
00:01:57,149 --> 00:02:04,200
comes down to about $2 they said they

36
00:02:02,250 --> 00:02:07,110
said but on the Leopold award you guys

37
00:02:04,200 --> 00:02:08,819
in and you know besides Janet could

38
00:02:07,110 --> 00:02:11,160
she's a young one but just look at right

39
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,890
here cut this in half and look at the

40
00:02:11,160 --> 00:02:17,310
age of these people right here everybody

41
00:02:13,890 --> 00:02:19,290
on our farm understand soil health what

42
00:02:17,310 --> 00:02:21,720
we need to do to make soil health and

43
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:24,390
when we talk we talk a lot of carbon we

44
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:26,010
talk a lot of soil health because soil

45
00:02:24,390 --> 00:02:28,739
health is a driving force and if a

46
00:02:26,010 --> 00:02:30,269
person doesn't think it is if we keep

47
00:02:28,739 --> 00:02:32,700
doing what we're doing the next 10 years

48
00:02:30,269 --> 00:02:35,220
we're going to every year we see it so

49
00:02:32,700 --> 00:02:39,200
soil health is it is it really a driving

50
00:02:35,220 --> 00:02:43,440
force Katie's going to hear Corey Casey

51
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:46,140
know we've got about 775 cows cow cats

52
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:49,319
that we have out every year we run on

53
00:02:46,140 --> 00:02:52,380
about 8,500 acres mostly along the river

54
00:02:49,319 --> 00:02:53,549
here and pastures and then we we take

55
00:02:52,380 --> 00:02:54,840
them back up to the farm in the

56
00:02:53,549 --> 00:02:57,959
wintertime and that's where we do all

57
00:02:54,840 --> 00:02:58,709
our cover crop graze and corn stocks get

58
00:02:57,959 --> 00:03:02,519
out on the field

59
00:02:58,709 --> 00:03:07,049
so this slide thought was pretty

60
00:03:02,519 --> 00:03:09,030
interesting this is I didn't ever

61
00:03:07,049 --> 00:03:10,620
understand that well why can't we just

62
00:03:09,030 --> 00:03:12,000
mold this pasture off what's the big

63
00:03:10,620 --> 00:03:15,269
deal with that I mean it's there it's

64
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:19,170
going well this pretty much explains it

65
00:03:15,269 --> 00:03:21,090
once I got used to that where if you are

66
00:03:19,170 --> 00:03:25,079
leaving something you're going to have a

67
00:03:21,090 --> 00:03:27,330
lot more to graze later on you know what

68
00:03:25,079 --> 00:03:30,240
I then and I

69
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:32,160
really appreciate what Casey and Cory

70
00:03:30,240 --> 00:03:33,900
are doing and not saying money wasn't

71
00:03:32,160 --> 00:03:37,410
there also but they're really

72
00:03:33,900 --> 00:03:39,330
understanding the the divide tenses in

73
00:03:37,410 --> 00:03:41,760
the movement and different water systems

74
00:03:39,330 --> 00:03:44,130
and sold but I mean not I just think

75
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:46,170
that's something you guys you don't

76
00:03:44,130 --> 00:03:50,190
think about that but just think I mean

77
00:03:46,170 --> 00:03:52,290
that's and this is something that you

78
00:03:50,190 --> 00:03:55,440
know you can't put a value on this is

79
00:03:52,290 --> 00:03:58,590
Casey and Wylie you cannot put a value

80
00:03:55,440 --> 00:04:00,120
on what the what Casey's doing to build

81
00:03:58,590 --> 00:04:03,630
for the future because that's what we

82
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:06,510
have to do you know but the one thing is

83
00:04:03,630 --> 00:04:09,870
is so there are three generations to

84
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:11,850
build the lasting legacy so on our farm

85
00:04:09,870 --> 00:04:14,010
we want everybody to understand what's

86
00:04:11,850 --> 00:04:15,990
going on we want to understand why we're

87
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:18,750
doing this we're not doing this just

88
00:04:15,990 --> 00:04:20,430
because it's it's it doesn't cost as

89
00:04:18,750 --> 00:04:24,240
much whatever we understand and we're

90
00:04:20,430 --> 00:04:25,410
all building soil health you know one

91
00:04:24,240 --> 00:04:27,810
thing we talked about rain and

92
00:04:25,410 --> 00:04:29,910
everybody's gets everybody talks about

93
00:04:27,810 --> 00:04:32,760
well yeah you got this rain we got this

94
00:04:29,910 --> 00:04:38,070
rain and so you know 19 inches as our

95
00:04:32,760 --> 00:04:41,910
norm but so we these are our pivots down

96
00:04:38,070 --> 00:04:43,710
here so in in May June in July we had

97
00:04:41,910 --> 00:04:47,850
half as much rain that's what we

98
00:04:43,710 --> 00:04:49,590
normally do in the last 30 years so you

99
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:52,140
need the soil health you need to have

100
00:04:49,590 --> 00:04:54,150
the good growth you need to capture

101
00:04:52,140 --> 00:04:56,580
every bit of water you can do and that's

102
00:04:54,150 --> 00:04:58,380
where pivots come in because it usually

103
00:04:56,580 --> 00:05:00,090
used to be corn bean guys and we found

104
00:04:58,380 --> 00:05:03,180
out where that really isn't what we

105
00:05:00,090 --> 00:05:06,750
should do and then another thing and we

106
00:05:03,180 --> 00:05:08,550
will protect our resource we we farm we

107
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:11,760
ranch up along this river and we are

108
00:05:08,550 --> 00:05:13,590
going to protect that resource so these

109
00:05:11,760 --> 00:05:16,770
are some of the rotations but this is

110
00:05:13,590 --> 00:05:18,750
the neatest thing about the rotations if

111
00:05:16,770 --> 00:05:21,450
any time we can we come back with a

112
00:05:18,750 --> 00:05:23,010
cover we come back with the cover we

113
00:05:21,450 --> 00:05:28,150
come back with that cover it's a graze

114
00:05:23,010 --> 00:05:35,820
and cover Casey

115
00:05:28,150 --> 00:05:38,560
so this is done yahooza pointer okay

116
00:05:35,820 --> 00:05:41,830
here's a green so we can tell each other

117
00:05:38,560 --> 00:05:44,320
apart we can do all here so this is one

118
00:05:41,830 --> 00:05:46,990
of the the circles down on the river up

119
00:05:44,320 --> 00:05:49,330
above we planted peas on it

120
00:05:46,990 --> 00:05:52,300
combine the peas and went in with a with

121
00:05:49,330 --> 00:05:54,340
the six-way mix like it says there we

122
00:05:52,300 --> 00:05:57,220
luckily had the the pivot on it we

123
00:05:54,340 --> 00:05:59,410
watered it up and then we ran ran our

124
00:05:57,220 --> 00:06:01,930
cows on it for a couple weeks and then

125
00:05:59,410 --> 00:06:04,360
after that we turned in we fenceline

126
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:07,270
Wiener calves which would really like

127
00:06:04,360 --> 00:06:09,580
and they were we turned the cows in

128
00:06:07,270 --> 00:06:11,620
their cows around the other calves were

129
00:06:09,580 --> 00:06:13,570
on the other side of it and the college

130
00:06:11,620 --> 00:06:16,090
just went to Eton and everybody just

131
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:17,949
kind of weaned themselves after that we

132
00:06:16,090 --> 00:06:19,840
harvested the lower circles the cows

133
00:06:17,949 --> 00:06:22,000
went down on that we put the calves in

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:25,000
for a couple more weeks on that and got

135
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:27,010
quite a bit of value on it calves did

136
00:06:25,000 --> 00:06:29,199
great on it really really excited to do

137
00:06:27,010 --> 00:06:30,850
some more of that so you know another

138
00:06:29,199 --> 00:06:33,160
thing and what Doug brought up and we'll

139
00:06:30,850 --> 00:06:35,950
get into it later too is the neat thing

140
00:06:33,160 --> 00:06:39,610
about grades and covers I mean I figure

141
00:06:35,950 --> 00:06:41,470
I'll take in 20% we're always going to

142
00:06:39,610 --> 00:06:42,870
lead part of our residue we're going to

143
00:06:41,470 --> 00:06:45,099
leave a third of our residue that's

144
00:06:42,870 --> 00:06:46,419
carbon now it's protection to the ground

145
00:06:45,099 --> 00:06:48,700
we're never going to graze it in the

146
00:06:46,419 --> 00:06:51,639
ground we've got at least 10% but you

147
00:06:48,700 --> 00:06:53,500
guys are snow here so they Casey what

148
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:58,900
you probably kept the calves out of the

149
00:06:53,500 --> 00:07:02,110
feedlot for another two three weeks and

150
00:06:58,900 --> 00:07:04,479
then just touch once on on grades and

151
00:07:02,110 --> 00:07:06,880
younger cattle how they how they adapt

152
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,370
where the older date yeah so these gaps

153
00:07:06,880 --> 00:07:13,460
well we went to a fence light weeds and

154
00:07:10,370 --> 00:07:16,669
your 2015 with the first preview did it

155
00:07:13,460 --> 00:07:19,160
and those jobs they just seem to take

156
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:21,470
off by themselves and they're out there

157
00:07:19,160 --> 00:07:23,150
on that grass they're doing what they're

158
00:07:21,470 --> 00:07:26,360
supposed to you haven't been sending a

159
00:07:23,150 --> 00:07:27,889
lot and now we're having out there well

160
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,010
this be the second group of peppers that

161
00:07:27,889 --> 00:07:34,370
we tapped out and those house they spend

162
00:07:31,010 --> 00:07:35,810
more time out grazing on a field that

163
00:07:34,370 --> 00:07:38,110
everything we get them up to the place

164
00:07:35,810 --> 00:07:40,910
and anything with ever app they'll

165
00:07:38,110 --> 00:07:42,650
they'll go after that stuff pull your

166
00:07:40,910 --> 00:07:45,740
tracker laying out there that's where

167
00:07:42,650 --> 00:07:47,690
they want to be an update I feel it

168
00:07:45,740 --> 00:07:49,220
attributes to the best line weaning

169
00:07:47,690 --> 00:07:51,670
event get them out early office of

170
00:07:49,220 --> 00:07:53,800
profit college students

171
00:07:51,670 --> 00:07:55,990
you know there's totally still appease

172
00:07:53,800 --> 00:07:58,720
from and you know it takes a while to

173
00:07:55,990 --> 00:08:00,670
click especially for me because I'm I'm

174
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:02,110
old and gray haired I listen to it I

175
00:08:00,670 --> 00:08:03,250
don't believe it I don't believe it

176
00:08:02,110 --> 00:08:04,510
don't believe it's the fourth time I

177
00:08:03,250 --> 00:08:06,220
said well you know there is something

178
00:08:04,510 --> 00:08:09,190
here but you know all you're doing in

179
00:08:06,220 --> 00:08:11,020
cycle and you residue faster and you but

180
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:13,000
you want to leave that third but you

181
00:08:11,020 --> 00:08:15,510
want to cycle that residues faster to

182
00:08:13,000 --> 00:08:18,070
make it available for next year's crop

183
00:08:15,510 --> 00:08:19,750
I'm going to talk some on carbon because

184
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:22,060
carbons are tremendously important

185
00:08:19,750 --> 00:08:25,230
things this whole system we have to

186
00:08:22,060 --> 00:08:28,090
harvest carbon we have to harvest carbon

187
00:08:25,230 --> 00:08:32,290
and what do you how you do that is you

188
00:08:28,090 --> 00:08:34,030
do it through plant management carbons

189
00:08:32,290 --> 00:08:35,680
the key ingredient to organic matter

190
00:08:34,030 --> 00:08:40,300
everybody talks about organic matter

191
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,430
carbon is 57 percent organic matter 57

192
00:08:40,300 --> 00:08:43,720
percent carbon so the only way we're

193
00:08:42,430 --> 00:08:45,190
going to harvest carbon is we're going

194
00:08:43,720 --> 00:08:47,320
to help things grow under their green

195
00:08:45,190 --> 00:08:50,290
we're going to take in the carbon from

196
00:08:47,320 --> 00:08:52,780
the air so and I think that there's just

197
00:08:50,290 --> 00:08:54,820
not enough emphasis put on this because

198
00:08:52,780 --> 00:08:56,950
with us we've got a full system

199
00:08:54,820 --> 00:08:59,110
approached where our covers you're

200
00:08:56,950 --> 00:09:01,120
harvesting carbon we don't want to we

201
00:08:59,110 --> 00:09:04,720
want to leave our residue so it's up

202
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:06,940
it's a kind of a holistic approach you

203
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:10,000
know this is a nation that destroys that

204
00:09:06,940 --> 00:09:13,420
soil destroys itself so this is the way

205
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:17,260
we were this is the way we were and but

206
00:09:13,420 --> 00:09:21,100
now I don't know so what's that grandpa

207
00:09:17,260 --> 00:09:25,540
telling his grandson he said I made a

208
00:09:21,100 --> 00:09:27,550
mistake it took me about 10-15 years of

209
00:09:25,540 --> 00:09:31,600
mining your organic matter but I made a

210
00:09:27,550 --> 00:09:34,420
mistake it's up to you to fix it it's up

211
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,220
to you to fix it and this is the best

212
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:38,110
way we can do it with covers I'm not

213
00:09:36,220 --> 00:09:40,960
saying only farming but as long as we

214
00:09:38,110 --> 00:09:43,510
think about the carbon it's just a

215
00:09:40,960 --> 00:09:45,160
win-win this is what we've done in our

216
00:09:43,510 --> 00:09:48,460
place not going to spend a lot of time

217
00:09:45,160 --> 00:09:50,500
this is grass soil sample it was been

218
00:09:48,460 --> 00:09:52,690
grass put in after the 30s and so that's

219
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:55,390
kind of what we've done on our place

220
00:09:52,690 --> 00:10:01,450
benefits of organic matter water holding

221
00:09:55,390 --> 00:10:02,080
capacity is a huge one and then the I

222
00:10:01,450 --> 00:10:04,450
just

223
00:10:02,080 --> 00:10:05,230
you just can't emphasize what organic

224
00:10:04,450 --> 00:10:07,920
matter will do

225
00:10:05,230 --> 00:10:10,990
what a percent of organic matter will do

226
00:10:07,920 --> 00:10:13,120
we've got to start a great deal of

227
00:10:10,990 --> 00:10:15,700
carbon once stored in the soil no store

228
00:10:13,120 --> 00:10:18,040
in the atmosphere we need to retain this

229
00:10:15,700 --> 00:10:21,070
back into the soil assume us just have

230
00:10:18,040 --> 00:10:22,750
to do that so I'm not talking about

231
00:10:21,070 --> 00:10:25,960
building organic matter I'm talking

232
00:10:22,750 --> 00:10:29,620
about building soils on our full season

233
00:10:25,960 --> 00:10:32,710
covered this is a shovel full of soil if

234
00:10:29,620 --> 00:10:34,570
Casey's holding the shovel but so what

235
00:10:32,710 --> 00:10:37,720
we're building soil so it's residue

236
00:10:34,570 --> 00:10:41,110
humans good job Casey organic master

237
00:10:37,720 --> 00:10:43,750
topsoil so you know and I never you know

238
00:10:41,110 --> 00:10:45,820
how things kind of slow I'm slow but I

239
00:10:43,750 --> 00:10:49,360
hang around during Dwayne Beck we went

240
00:10:45,820 --> 00:10:52,420
to Montana for a week great week geez

241
00:10:49,360 --> 00:10:54,070
just unreal but one thing he said he

242
00:10:52,420 --> 00:10:57,160
said when if you guys ever noticed when

243
00:10:54,070 --> 00:10:59,470
you walk along down in the in town and

244
00:10:57,160 --> 00:11:01,720
all of a sudden the sidewalk down in

245
00:10:59,470 --> 00:11:05,620
this and you say boy that sidewalks sunk

246
00:11:01,720 --> 00:11:07,720
that sidewalk didn't sink the organic

247
00:11:05,620 --> 00:11:10,150
matters building soil so you're building

248
00:11:07,720 --> 00:11:13,420
soil so when you walk out in our fields

249
00:11:10,150 --> 00:11:16,210
even the ones that we they're grazed all

250
00:11:13,420 --> 00:11:18,040
the time with your with so if you manage

251
00:11:16,210 --> 00:11:20,800
it right it's just like walking on a

252
00:11:18,040 --> 00:11:23,050
really nice shag carpet you can feel

253
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:26,020
that cush well what you're doing right

254
00:11:23,050 --> 00:11:28,720
now is you're building houmous you're

255
00:11:26,020 --> 00:11:33,160
building organic matter it's just a

256
00:11:28,720 --> 00:11:35,710
win-win situation you've got to feed

257
00:11:33,160 --> 00:11:39,640
these Doug talked on that you've got to

258
00:11:35,710 --> 00:11:42,220
feed these so this is a mistake

259
00:11:39,640 --> 00:11:44,740
in 2006 we planted her first field of

260
00:11:42,220 --> 00:11:47,110
cover crop everything went 2007 it

261
00:11:44,740 --> 00:11:49,450
rained and boy that's a nice field but

262
00:11:47,110 --> 00:11:51,750
you know where the mistake was made we

263
00:11:49,450 --> 00:11:55,150
didn't pay any attention to the carbon I

264
00:11:51,750 --> 00:11:57,820
went in there with a very low carbon no

265
00:11:55,150 --> 00:11:59,560
carbon so all of a sudden I was paying

266
00:11:57,820 --> 00:12:02,020
it took me about three years after that

267
00:11:59,560 --> 00:12:04,510
to make up for that proof so now anytime

268
00:12:02,020 --> 00:12:07,380
we talk about cover crop we want we want

269
00:12:04,510 --> 00:12:11,830
the carbon nitrogen ratio to be up there

270
00:12:07,380 --> 00:12:14,680
carbon you know and then so these are

271
00:12:11,830 --> 00:12:17,950
just three different mixes

272
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,450
I will get back to Casey someone said

273
00:12:17,950 --> 00:12:22,870
Casey and I are going to talk and he

274
00:12:19,450 --> 00:12:24,820
said yeah I feel sorry for Casey so

275
00:12:22,870 --> 00:12:26,890
cover crop and carbon nitrogen this came

276
00:12:24,820 --> 00:12:29,020
from Ray Ward and this all makes sense

277
00:12:26,890 --> 00:12:32,230
the one thing you guys and this is where

278
00:12:29,020 --> 00:12:34,920
the NRCS has got to help help and they

279
00:12:32,230 --> 00:12:37,000
will when you start talking about a

280
00:12:34,920 --> 00:12:40,600
cover crop with a carbon and nitrogen

281
00:12:37,000 --> 00:12:42,160
ratio what you want I want a 24 to 30 a

282
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:43,839
lot of people tabled why you even

283
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:45,339
talking about that on a cover crop I

284
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:48,820
think you have to talk about that on

285
00:12:45,339 --> 00:12:50,529
cover crop but we have to find out what

286
00:12:48,820 --> 00:12:52,000
plants because if you get into the

287
00:12:50,529 --> 00:12:54,850
middle of August towards the end of

288
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:57,390
August you can't plant a it's hard to

289
00:12:54,850 --> 00:12:59,670
get a high carbon it's hard to like a

290
00:12:57,390 --> 00:13:02,380
forage sorghum it's too late in the year

291
00:12:59,670 --> 00:13:04,149
so yet like a notes is a good one but

292
00:13:02,380 --> 00:13:06,310
also get mature so you have to

293
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:08,200
understand how late you can go on this

294
00:13:06,310 --> 00:13:13,870
season with Phil your carbon to nitrogen

295
00:13:08,200 --> 00:13:17,110
ratio so this is where we want to be I

296
00:13:13,870 --> 00:13:18,910
want to be like right up in here 26 to

297
00:13:17,110 --> 00:13:21,339
one because our soil is reactive enough

298
00:13:18,910 --> 00:13:23,440
I want to slow things down I want to

299
00:13:21,339 --> 00:13:25,810
slow things down when I did at the other

300
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:28,529
time I was right down in here and we

301
00:13:25,810 --> 00:13:28,529
just speed up

302
00:13:35,350 --> 00:13:43,550
these are kids from Gettysburg FFA the

303
00:13:41,660 --> 00:13:45,710
teacher he just look like oh the ones a

304
00:13:43,550 --> 00:13:47,210
teacher could would the teacher want to

305
00:13:45,710 --> 00:13:49,430
raise your hand okay

306
00:13:47,210 --> 00:13:53,360
you guys find us find a chair there's

307
00:13:49,430 --> 00:13:55,390
chairs around you know these are two

308
00:13:53,360 --> 00:13:58,190
good books you guys and I really

309
00:13:55,390 --> 00:13:59,990
especially this one any question you've

310
00:13:58,190 --> 00:14:02,090
got on how much carbon what you're going

311
00:13:59,990 --> 00:14:04,300
to do you could download this as a PDF

312
00:14:02,090 --> 00:14:09,130
you can download that off the internet

313
00:14:04,300 --> 00:14:14,150
it's just a really good book okay Casey

314
00:14:09,130 --> 00:14:16,400
so so this is it's not have all this but

315
00:14:14,150 --> 00:14:20,780
we're on this is kind of the chunk the

316
00:14:16,400 --> 00:14:22,970
pasture we have most of it you know will

317
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:24,320
never ever be farming because it looks a

318
00:14:22,970 --> 00:14:28,910
lot like that it's pretty rough country

319
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:34,460
thank goodness great great but now back

320
00:14:28,910 --> 00:14:37,340
to the rotational stuff when I got back

321
00:14:34,460 --> 00:14:40,220
it was well I think we should probably

322
00:14:37,340 --> 00:14:41,720
move on well we don't have one health

323
00:14:40,220 --> 00:14:44,690
road let's just open the gate

324
00:14:41,720 --> 00:14:46,280
no moving so well after a couple weeks

325
00:14:44,690 --> 00:14:48,560
of that you got it turned in on

326
00:14:46,280 --> 00:14:50,930
everything you have so what we've done

327
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:52,910
is we started cross fencing we're

328
00:14:50,930 --> 00:14:55,730
nowhere like doug is but that's kind of

329
00:14:52,910 --> 00:14:57,740
the end goal is to try to break

330
00:14:55,730 --> 00:14:58,660
everything up it's going to be a lot

331
00:14:57,740 --> 00:15:00,910
easier to score

332
00:14:58,660 --> 00:15:04,029
I run all the cows through us to handle

333
00:15:00,910 --> 00:15:05,410
them in smaller pastures like that water

334
00:15:04,029 --> 00:15:08,470
is going to present a challenge but

335
00:15:05,410 --> 00:15:10,360
we're working on that and I've been

336
00:15:08,470 --> 00:15:12,129
bringing them home Casey yes and then

337
00:15:10,360 --> 00:15:13,810
this is where we bring home too with

338
00:15:12,129 --> 00:15:15,730
this trail across country you're

339
00:15:13,810 --> 00:15:17,490
bringing home this is where we run on

340
00:15:15,730 --> 00:15:21,279
that home now

341
00:15:17,490 --> 00:15:24,069
back to when I got home again when we

342
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:26,889
start a girl in cover crops in 2007

343
00:15:24,069 --> 00:15:32,800
we just threw them on everything that we

344
00:15:26,889 --> 00:15:35,920
have around there so they go when they

345
00:15:32,800 --> 00:15:37,600
need the green stuff first and then you

346
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:39,970
know they're they're taking too much so

347
00:15:37,600 --> 00:15:42,550
now we're starting to cross fence that

348
00:15:39,970 --> 00:15:44,620
let them have certain things and then

349
00:15:42,550 --> 00:15:46,149
we're controlling how much garden how

350
00:15:44,620 --> 00:15:47,970
much we're reading we're taking 2/3

351
00:15:46,149 --> 00:15:50,170
leading in thirds and that's our goal

352
00:15:47,970 --> 00:15:51,730
we're seeing a lot more benefit than

353
00:15:50,170 --> 00:15:54,810
that rather than just turning them out

354
00:15:51,730 --> 00:15:59,529
lesson great let's take a cheese

355
00:15:54,810 --> 00:16:01,300
you know what's new for 2016 and Casey

356
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:03,459
I'll let you touch on this this is the

357
00:16:01,300 --> 00:16:06,699
helper you can't quite see the top but

358
00:16:03,459 --> 00:16:09,040
it's the heifers yes so our first half

359
00:16:06,699 --> 00:16:12,639
after is bringing hold a bell run this

360
00:16:09,040 --> 00:16:15,550
is a full team right out back some kind

361
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:17,470
of a I don't basically a 38 a lot is

362
00:16:15,550 --> 00:16:20,410
what is so they'll grades is down it and

363
00:16:17,470 --> 00:16:21,379
we don't control this this is where we

364
00:16:20,410 --> 00:16:22,939
be another thing

365
00:16:21,379 --> 00:16:25,220
and then this is where they run but

366
00:16:22,939 --> 00:16:27,829
there's also a porter out to the last

367
00:16:25,220 --> 00:16:29,569
year that was planted because we went

368
00:16:27,829 --> 00:16:31,429
back to cover drop the grades on that

369
00:16:29,569 --> 00:16:33,889
and then to the north where that this is

370
00:16:31,429 --> 00:16:36,349
this important stops and they also ran

371
00:16:33,889 --> 00:16:37,970
on that now everything that's covered up

372
00:16:36,349 --> 00:16:40,879
to gauge they'd open for them because

373
00:16:37,970 --> 00:16:42,619
they they once they got through all this

374
00:16:40,879 --> 00:16:45,079
we got covered up with snow

375
00:16:42,619 --> 00:16:46,699
now that we've melted off they've headed

376
00:16:45,079 --> 00:16:49,099
right back out to that cover and they're

377
00:16:46,699 --> 00:16:52,249
dating tourism and hammering away on

378
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:54,159
that again so really really like reason

379
00:16:52,249 --> 00:16:56,929
okay

380
00:16:54,159 --> 00:16:59,269
you know this is something I did so I

381
00:16:56,929 --> 00:17:01,759
talk about carbon talk about carbon look

382
00:16:59,269 --> 00:17:04,490
at this cover crop mix there's no carbon

383
00:17:01,759 --> 00:17:06,620
what I like is this price here turnips

384
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:08,360
I'm uh you know I think we're going to

385
00:17:06,620 --> 00:17:11,000
go to a pod you turn up because the

386
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:13,250
purple top it grows but I mean it cattle

387
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:15,110
will kick it out easy and a pod you'll

388
00:17:13,250 --> 00:17:16,100
get more of a tuber on it more relief

389
00:17:15,110 --> 00:17:18,889
more of a grazer

390
00:17:16,100 --> 00:17:20,449
I love plaque to mycorrhizae the for

391
00:17:18,889 --> 00:17:23,809
HP's I don't know if I'll do that again

392
00:17:20,449 --> 00:17:25,759
it's just because of the we have we have

393
00:17:23,809 --> 00:17:27,139
a pulse crop center rotation I don't

394
00:17:25,759 --> 00:17:31,340
know if I'll do that again but the

395
00:17:27,139 --> 00:17:34,100
reason I did this is this is 7080 bushel

396
00:17:31,340 --> 00:17:36,590
stripper headed Shelbourne stripper

397
00:17:34,100 --> 00:17:38,990
headed what if we stumble so we had all

398
00:17:36,590 --> 00:17:41,000
kinds of carbon we had all kinds of

399
00:17:38,990 --> 00:17:43,610
carbons from that old straw so all I was

400
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:46,240
trying to do is put some low carbon and

401
00:17:43,610 --> 00:17:49,730
another thing when that first flush of a

402
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:51,139
volunteer wheat came when I wanted to be

403
00:17:49,730 --> 00:17:52,730
able to take it out with collected them

404
00:17:51,139 --> 00:17:56,059
so you just take the grass out and you

405
00:17:52,730 --> 00:17:57,740
leave everything else alone this is what

406
00:17:56,059 --> 00:18:01,700
it was the for each piece had a great

407
00:17:57,740 --> 00:18:04,190
year my big worry was is what was going

408
00:18:01,700 --> 00:18:05,960
to happen now because with the cattle

409
00:18:04,190 --> 00:18:09,260
eat this in case they'll let you do this

410
00:18:05,960 --> 00:18:13,010
and they sure did yeah dispensed out and

411
00:18:09,260 --> 00:18:14,930
out there there was a live field that

412
00:18:13,010 --> 00:18:17,450
our planet that wasn't going to our full

413
00:18:14,930 --> 00:18:19,430
season cover with this year next to this

414
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:22,400
and they just they hit open well but

415
00:18:19,430 --> 00:18:24,140
they finally capped out on this move

416
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:29,180
them along through that before we got to

417
00:18:24,140 --> 00:18:31,760
LOC this is the cow bouquet

418
00:18:29,180 --> 00:18:33,610
now there were where we take our gas to

419
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:36,170
and start background you know we had a

420
00:18:33,610 --> 00:18:39,410
hundred and eleven acres to this is

421
00:18:36,170 --> 00:18:41,660
instead of our feedlot area here not

422
00:18:39,410 --> 00:18:44,390
sure but this is the five way mix that

423
00:18:41,660 --> 00:18:46,190
was planted our goal is to get out on it

424
00:18:44,390 --> 00:18:48,680
but we thought we had more time than

425
00:18:46,190 --> 00:18:51,770
what we did and it's no different we

426
00:18:48,680 --> 00:18:54,680
just didn't get it done so it's a goal

427
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:56,390
to be able to at least for the calves

428
00:18:54,680 --> 00:19:00,140
that we're keeping for our replacements

429
00:18:56,390 --> 00:19:01,610
even grazing on that as long you know

430
00:19:00,140 --> 00:19:04,370
and another thing in case you already

431
00:19:01,610 --> 00:19:08,660
said this but our cattle really under

432
00:19:04,370 --> 00:19:11,420
our or I'm I'm the cow but their cattle

433
00:19:08,660 --> 00:19:13,130
really understand electric fences I mean

434
00:19:11,420 --> 00:19:17,180
they respect and they really understand

435
00:19:13,130 --> 00:19:21,770
them and the kids can move a offense in

436
00:19:17,180 --> 00:19:24,830
a hurry so in 2016 we're going to have a

437
00:19:21,770 --> 00:19:27,680
full season grades this sounds really

438
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:29,810
good on paper and it was will work on

439
00:19:27,680 --> 00:19:32,840
paper but so we're going to have a full

440
00:19:29,810 --> 00:19:34,640
season graze so this is our mix and

441
00:19:32,840 --> 00:19:36,830
there's a reason for everything in here

442
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:39,170
what I was trying to do see the carbon

443
00:19:36,830 --> 00:19:41,690
and nitrogen ratio was 32 to 1 that was

444
00:19:39,170 --> 00:19:43,070
real important to me the buckwheat you

445
00:19:41,690 --> 00:19:45,440
know a lot of people if you got

446
00:19:43,070 --> 00:19:47,180
buckwheat if you have wheat next you got

447
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:49,460
to have a two years off wheat

448
00:19:47,180 --> 00:19:52,070
otherwise the wheat can be rejected if

449
00:19:49,460 --> 00:19:53,480
there's buckwheat and export I don't

450
00:19:52,070 --> 00:19:55,970
know probably I like what it did

451
00:19:53,480 --> 00:19:58,700
enhances phosphorus the old career is

452
00:19:55,970 --> 00:20:01,790
going to go away the and then and then

453
00:19:58,700 --> 00:20:06,350
the turnips is going to be a bit of a

454
00:20:01,790 --> 00:20:08,630
podge of turnip kale I love kale a half

455
00:20:06,350 --> 00:20:10,640
a pound the kale goes a long ways it

456
00:20:08,630 --> 00:20:12,920
gets it will stay green until November

457
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:17,780
gets tall and then but you'll see all

458
00:20:12,920 --> 00:20:19,970
these after the mycorrhizae association

459
00:20:17,780 --> 00:20:21,890
and i think that's really important and

460
00:20:19,970 --> 00:20:23,070
I'm not saying we're ever going to have

461
00:20:21,890 --> 00:20:26,190
it to where

462
00:20:23,070 --> 00:20:27,930
we cut out phosphorous altogether but

463
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:31,020
it's really what that'll do is you'll

464
00:20:27,930 --> 00:20:33,900
actually go out and it'll it'll go it'll

465
00:20:31,020 --> 00:20:36,900
trade carbon and they'll go and it will

466
00:20:33,900 --> 00:20:38,940
trade it for organic phosphorus but look

467
00:20:36,900 --> 00:20:42,120
at here the microwaves I so look at the

468
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:45,120
root system 700 times more root system

469
00:20:42,120 --> 00:20:46,830
on the micro as I plant and I just think

470
00:20:45,120 --> 00:20:49,680
this is something we just have to keep

471
00:20:46,830 --> 00:20:51,390
keep in the back of your mind I mean you

472
00:20:49,680 --> 00:20:53,010
guys that I hope there's no seed dealers

473
00:20:51,390 --> 00:20:55,770
in here but if they do I hope you learn

474
00:20:53,010 --> 00:20:57,990
from what I say is don't ever be

475
00:20:55,770 --> 00:21:00,780
satisfied but the guy goes in and saved

476
00:20:57,990 --> 00:21:02,460
this is what you need to plant you

477
00:21:00,780 --> 00:21:04,110
research it and you'll be able that you

478
00:21:02,460 --> 00:21:10,140
know enough what's going on where you're

479
00:21:04,110 --> 00:21:13,020
telling him what you want this is a wee

480
00:21:10,140 --> 00:21:14,700
planter and testable we we took a

481
00:21:13,020 --> 00:21:16,530
cutting to tap off and then we always

482
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,080
leave the second cut and come back and

483
00:21:16,530 --> 00:21:20,790
so the cattle graze this there's about a

484
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:22,410
foot of snow so there's a foot of

485
00:21:20,790 --> 00:21:24,720
stubble left I mean they weren't on it

486
00:21:22,410 --> 00:21:25,730
very long our cover crop mix everything

487
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:28,770
goes together

488
00:21:25,730 --> 00:21:29,370
July 10th we're going to get rid of the

489
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:33,690
okra

490
00:21:29,370 --> 00:21:35,250
I like this the it kind of scares you

491
00:21:33,690 --> 00:21:37,530
and you look at the plan at the shorter

492
00:21:35,250 --> 00:21:39,630
is just shorter brown mid Rhea but I

493
00:21:37,530 --> 00:21:41,760
like brown midrib because of the press

494
00:21:39,630 --> 00:21:45,090
ik acid it takes some of that threat

495
00:21:41,760 --> 00:21:48,720
away or paretic acid and this is our

496
00:21:45,090 --> 00:21:51,870
field layout and I wanted to find out so

497
00:21:48,720 --> 00:21:54,740
there's a three-way mix known in and

498
00:21:51,870 --> 00:21:59,490
then the rest of this we put on we had

499
00:21:54,740 --> 00:22:01,500
40 units of we had about 80 units of in

500
00:21:59,490 --> 00:22:04,500
on this and a lot of people said you

501
00:22:01,500 --> 00:22:07,080
know it's it's you shouldn't have to put

502
00:22:04,500 --> 00:22:08,670
fertilizer on covers and so we just

503
00:22:07,080 --> 00:22:11,280
wanted to see so that's the full season

504
00:22:08,670 --> 00:22:15,920
graze July 29th

505
00:22:11,280 --> 00:22:18,480
there's our in our non end strips

506
00:22:15,920 --> 00:22:21,210
there's a biomass 214th

507
00:22:18,480 --> 00:22:24,030
so we did a Jason Miller came up in

508
00:22:21,210 --> 00:22:26,010
August 14th we did a biomass and then

509
00:22:24,030 --> 00:22:28,890
this is kind of what bothered me a

510
00:22:26,010 --> 00:22:30,720
little bit because within there's 70 100

511
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:33,230
pounds of biomass and without the under

512
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:35,929
70 600 pounds of biomass

513
00:22:33,230 --> 00:22:39,450
but you know you stop and think about it

514
00:22:35,929 --> 00:22:42,059
the without the end the others does the

515
00:22:39,450 --> 00:22:44,340
undergrowth like the forage peas and the

516
00:22:42,059 --> 00:22:46,020
and the cow peas and everything they had

517
00:22:44,340 --> 00:22:48,480
more chance to grow because they didn't

518
00:22:46,020 --> 00:22:51,320
have the competition for sunlight so you

519
00:22:48,480 --> 00:22:54,419
know I thought well did we waste our in

520
00:22:51,320 --> 00:22:54,750
second biomass eleven twenty eight weeks

521
00:22:54,419 --> 00:22:57,059
old

522
00:22:54,750 --> 00:22:59,309
I really recommend everybody you do a

523
00:22:57,059 --> 00:23:01,740
biomass if nothing else just to find out

524
00:22:59,309 --> 00:23:05,880
where you're at so we just took a yard

525
00:23:01,740 --> 00:23:09,299
square went out but you can see on our

526
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:11,520
twelve ways within look at the

527
00:23:09,299 --> 00:23:15,059
difference there that went away but look

528
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:18,419
at here so 25 to one I said I wanted to

529
00:23:15,059 --> 00:23:21,720
be 26 27 but I was still happy 11

530
00:23:18,419 --> 00:23:23,309
percent crude protein but this is

531
00:23:21,720 --> 00:23:24,360
something that we've got to get answered

532
00:23:23,309 --> 00:23:26,940
and I don't know how we're going to

533
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:30,330
answer this right down here we had 80

534
00:23:26,940 --> 00:23:34,500
200 pounds of biomass left 960 pounds of

535
00:23:30,330 --> 00:23:36,059
protein or 144 pounds a.m. so how are we

536
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,390
going to get that back to next year's

537
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:41,100
crop someone said don't worry about it

538
00:23:38,390 --> 00:23:42,900
but if you're if you're talking

539
00:23:41,100 --> 00:23:45,750
financially you have to be thinking

540
00:23:42,900 --> 00:23:48,390
about it so what we're doing is we're

541
00:23:45,750 --> 00:23:51,270
grazing it so you're grazed the top two

542
00:23:48,390 --> 00:23:53,549
thirds you leave the bottom third that

543
00:23:51,270 --> 00:23:55,200
cycle through the cattle and so it

544
00:23:53,549 --> 00:23:57,000
should be more available we still

545
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,220
Jason's we're going to work on this

546
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:03,780
quite a bit next summer we're trying to

547
00:23:59,220 --> 00:24:08,820
get an answer to this on our farm so

548
00:24:03,780 --> 00:24:10,440
here's our here's a great board and one

549
00:24:08,820 --> 00:24:11,730
thing I like about sending down there

550
00:24:10,440 --> 00:24:13,230
and I know there's a lot of good labs

551
00:24:11,730 --> 00:24:16,710
but he'll actually give you a carbon

552
00:24:13,230 --> 00:24:19,500
nitrogen ratio so I mean it's just uh we

553
00:24:16,710 --> 00:24:23,520
felt really good about our mix so here

554
00:24:19,500 --> 00:24:25,919
we go so we had a yield biomass we're

555
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:27,720
going to graze pounds had eighty eight

556
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:29,669
hundred forty thousand pounds six

557
00:24:27,720 --> 00:24:32,159
hundred fifty twenty six pounds a day if

558
00:24:29,669 --> 00:24:33,780
the temperatures right so we had forty

559
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:39,390
six pounds of grades and that sounds

560
00:24:33,780 --> 00:24:40,890
easy without to slam dunk so we had $147

561
00:24:39,390 --> 00:24:42,360
that's charged yourselves around one

562
00:24:40,890 --> 00:24:45,270
hundred forty seven dollars into the

563
00:24:42,360 --> 00:24:46,950
cover crop mix so we're going to it's

564
00:24:45,270 --> 00:24:49,520
going to cost seventy-five cents a day

565
00:24:46,950 --> 00:24:54,330
11% protein and here we go I mean

566
00:24:49,520 --> 00:24:57,300
slam-dunk dollar 65 20 degrees to feed

567
00:24:54,330 --> 00:24:59,610
through the wagon so that's one hundred

568
00:24:57,300 --> 00:25:00,870
seventy two dollars an acre so let's

569
00:24:59,610 --> 00:25:03,720
just write that down because we've

570
00:25:00,870 --> 00:25:08,940
already made that I mean that's that we

571
00:25:03,720 --> 00:25:10,350
you know so I figured on seventy bushel

572
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:13,680
spring wheat which that field would have

573
00:25:10,350 --> 00:25:16,230
gone to at 475 we would indebted seventy

574
00:25:13,680 --> 00:25:18,030
six dollars an acre so you know we're

575
00:25:16,230 --> 00:25:19,830
kind of making headway plus he left the

576
00:25:18,030 --> 00:25:22,520
manure on the field there's a lot of

577
00:25:19,830 --> 00:25:25,740
benefit of what happened on the field

578
00:25:22,520 --> 00:25:27,330
Casey suddenly he got into the winter

579
00:25:25,740 --> 00:25:32,250
and Mother Nature has a different plan

580
00:25:27,330 --> 00:25:34,950
Lord we started out well I mean nine

581
00:25:32,250 --> 00:25:37,290
times 2020 to put it was back from home

582
00:25:34,950 --> 00:25:39,570
for the river sooner and got on this

583
00:25:37,290 --> 00:25:43,160
quicker and you know we would have had

584
00:25:39,570 --> 00:25:45,930
all that but it started snowin and

585
00:25:43,160 --> 00:25:48,120
between the snow and the beer the beer

586
00:25:45,930 --> 00:25:50,970
itself it took away one of the paddocks

587
00:25:48,120 --> 00:25:52,560
for us but it just we didn't get

588
00:25:50,970 --> 00:25:54,810
everything out of it that we thought

589
00:25:52,560 --> 00:25:58,400
plus it was cold so they were eating a

590
00:25:54,810 --> 00:25:58,400
lot more than anticipated

591
00:25:58,770 --> 00:26:04,480
this is a Fischer after 70 degrees in

592
00:26:01,780 --> 00:26:06,520
one of the paddocks now you'd say well

593
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:08,980
you didn't leave a third there well that

594
00:26:06,520 --> 00:26:12,250
smells a couple feet deep to it a lot in

595
00:26:08,980 --> 00:26:14,890
Fletcher but the cattle I was happy with

596
00:26:12,250 --> 00:26:16,809
them once we got them up there no summit

597
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:18,280
never ever left it I mean it you got

598
00:26:16,809 --> 00:26:20,590
it's just out in the open on the

599
00:26:18,280 --> 00:26:22,539
blasters not a lot of protection and

600
00:26:20,590 --> 00:26:26,429
they dug through it got to get it out

601
00:26:22,539 --> 00:26:26,429
again so I'm very happy with that part

602
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:33,250
you want you know so we've got another

603
00:26:30,669 --> 00:26:35,530
one so we got to make sense to this we

604
00:26:33,250 --> 00:26:37,419
have to make sense to this so just like

605
00:26:35,530 --> 00:26:40,000
right now so you increase your feed is

606
00:26:37,419 --> 00:26:43,000
the temperature drop so this is 24

607
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:46,510
degrees refrigerator is going to take 23

608
00:26:43,000 --> 00:26:49,150
just about 24 pounds a day ok so now all

609
00:26:46,510 --> 00:26:51,460
of a sudden we at we are average

610
00:26:49,150 --> 00:26:54,340
temperature with the windchill was minus

611
00:26:51,460 --> 00:26:57,220
3 what we were on that so you take that

612
00:26:54,340 --> 00:26:59,740
so I take 31 pounds a day did they

613
00:26:57,220 --> 00:27:01,539
really need it we're not going to let

614
00:26:59,740 --> 00:27:04,750
our cattle go backwards their cattle

615
00:27:01,539 --> 00:27:07,390
didn't go backwards right Casey so so

616
00:27:04,750 --> 00:27:09,640
this is our average we had average

617
00:27:07,390 --> 00:27:13,120
temperature average wind speed wind

618
00:27:09,640 --> 00:27:15,429
chill but look at our max when speed is

619
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:18,659
you know so I mean it was a it was just

620
00:27:15,429 --> 00:27:22,059
a tough winter you guys tough winter but

621
00:27:18,659 --> 00:27:24,880
another thing 36 inches of snow and

622
00:27:22,059 --> 00:27:27,730
everybody knows that Christmas what two

623
00:27:24,880 --> 00:27:29,530
quarter inch of rain will do and so we

624
00:27:27,730 --> 00:27:36,460
were still grazed in this so we had to

625
00:27:29,530 --> 00:27:38,309
keep working at it yes and we might have

626
00:27:36,460 --> 00:27:40,799
created a few months

627
00:27:38,309 --> 00:27:43,320
by me but like I said we didn't wanna

628
00:27:40,799 --> 00:27:44,999
let her account slip like I said earlier

629
00:27:43,320 --> 00:27:47,969
some of them cows never ever left come

630
00:27:44,999 --> 00:27:49,739
back and we were putting out through the

631
00:27:47,969 --> 00:27:52,139
language but not a little silence made

632
00:27:49,739 --> 00:27:53,669
and then we feet pieces or protein just

633
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:58,349
just so they were given up to keep

634
00:27:53,669 --> 00:28:00,389
everywhere and then yeah so it says loss

635
00:27:58,349 --> 00:28:02,940
of $35 per acre is kind of what we

636
00:28:00,389 --> 00:28:04,559
figured that well but there again I mean

637
00:28:02,940 --> 00:28:07,169
you gotta look at it as you're kind of

638
00:28:04,559 --> 00:28:08,549
doing this for the future - so what is

639
00:28:07,169 --> 00:28:12,749
it going to do this year for our crop

640
00:28:08,549 --> 00:28:18,029
and a few things like that it's hard to

641
00:28:12,749 --> 00:28:21,509
put a value on some of that go ahead

642
00:28:18,029 --> 00:28:22,919
yeah we've got a lot of deer are doing

643
00:28:21,509 --> 00:28:27,210
over I wouldn't recommend a deer or

644
00:28:22,919 --> 00:28:29,249
until but we have my dad left his Ranger

645
00:28:27,210 --> 00:28:30,659
in the tracks so if he didn't figure you

646
00:28:29,249 --> 00:28:32,820
need them in Arizona so we use that

647
00:28:30,659 --> 00:28:35,190
otherwise we probably would have wore

648
00:28:32,820 --> 00:28:37,200
out those snowshoes but a lot of our

649
00:28:35,190 --> 00:28:40,229
chain but they tore down our fence

650
00:28:37,200 --> 00:28:41,849
pretty much every day the cows stayed

651
00:28:40,229 --> 00:28:43,649
pretty good they didn't they filled it

652
00:28:41,849 --> 00:28:45,749
like step across that you know it's on

653
00:28:43,649 --> 00:28:48,839
the ground we battled it a little bit

654
00:28:45,749 --> 00:28:51,509
but these deer they sit there we started

655
00:28:48,839 --> 00:28:54,659
on started on the east and give them

656
00:28:51,509 --> 00:28:56,770
give them that chunk for their side

657
00:28:54,659 --> 00:28:59,500
chops and then we just work your way

658
00:28:56,770 --> 00:29:01,180
less than worker we eat candies here you

659
00:28:59,500 --> 00:29:03,220
go out there to move fast and they just

660
00:29:01,180 --> 00:29:04,840
kind of hang that move off a little bit

661
00:29:03,220 --> 00:29:06,760
and then they just stayed on the stuff

662
00:29:04,840 --> 00:29:09,760
that the cows were on till we got to the

663
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,760
to the end of it that we made they have

664
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:16,240
some good taken out of it so we

665
00:29:12,760 --> 00:29:19,660
definitely lost part of it too that the

666
00:29:16,240 --> 00:29:22,540
whole north side was it was tough for

667
00:29:19,660 --> 00:29:25,810
the cows you can get it it was bit fluid

668
00:29:22,540 --> 00:29:27,880
it was chest deep on me so but after

669
00:29:25,810 --> 00:29:30,340
after it felt a little bit those house

670
00:29:27,880 --> 00:29:31,120
did go in there hey strangers what they

671
00:29:30,340 --> 00:29:33,550
stood out

672
00:29:31,120 --> 00:29:36,070
you know Casey's and another thing too

673
00:29:33,550 --> 00:29:38,020
with this is your side the paddocks were

674
00:29:36,070 --> 00:29:39,280
yet all right what's it are would you do

675
00:29:38,020 --> 00:29:40,960
it different or what do you think then

676
00:29:39,280 --> 00:29:42,670
like how we productions and jam

677
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:44,830
everything about space to get around and

678
00:29:42,670 --> 00:29:46,240
everything without number of cows on

679
00:29:44,830 --> 00:29:51,190
there I thought I thought it worked out

680
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:52,660
real well okay then we did do a Belgrade

681
00:29:51,190 --> 00:29:56,770
this year for the first time so this

682
00:29:52,660 --> 00:29:59,710
about 63 acres that it's kind of between

683
00:29:56,770 --> 00:30:01,810
the windbreak and the PTR in the water

684
00:29:59,710 --> 00:30:04,600
and everything so it stays open to the

685
00:30:01,810 --> 00:30:07,240
cows over here so we just got to be I

686
00:30:04,600 --> 00:30:09,250
mean every year at discount abused well

687
00:30:07,240 --> 00:30:11,350
what we did is we planted it back grass

688
00:30:09,250 --> 00:30:14,080
we took their first cutting hay off of

689
00:30:11,350 --> 00:30:16,390
it this year we took bailed off and then

690
00:30:14,080 --> 00:30:18,490
we decided well let's let's go ahead and

691
00:30:16,390 --> 00:30:21,220
bail green so we took that we're going

692
00:30:18,490 --> 00:30:23,860
to go build back out and and we have

693
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,430
never thought of but I I got there on

694
00:30:23,860 --> 00:30:27,280
the loader

695
00:30:24,430 --> 00:30:29,800
Cory but all that plug them all has to

696
00:30:27,280 --> 00:30:32,020
work very very well you can see how

697
00:30:29,800 --> 00:30:34,120
Jesus no is I I was worried about him

698
00:30:32,020 --> 00:30:36,370
getting out around in there but and then

699
00:30:34,120 --> 00:30:38,260
just like Doug today I was cross that

700
00:30:36,370 --> 00:30:41,050
and there's a layer of ice underneath

701
00:30:38,260 --> 00:30:42,010
there that leads to put keep a thin

702
00:30:41,050 --> 00:30:45,220
layer a on it

703
00:30:42,010 --> 00:30:46,990
this year will probably rest it our

704
00:30:45,220 --> 00:30:49,750
bowls get a little anxious that right

705
00:30:46,990 --> 00:30:51,670
along with highway 83 so it was the

706
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:53,200
reading time they like to venture out or

707
00:30:51,670 --> 00:30:55,780
else we're going to bring them up and

708
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:59,440
grade this with them just kind of just

709
00:30:55,780 --> 00:31:01,300
equipment for up to three weeks and then

710
00:30:59,440 --> 00:31:02,620
that will rest goes for the ended here

711
00:31:01,300 --> 00:31:05,010
and then we'll decide whether we want

712
00:31:02,620 --> 00:31:08,190
the other grades again this year or

713
00:31:05,010 --> 00:31:08,190
arrested much

714
00:31:08,370 --> 00:31:17,460
this is just kind of the layout so this

715
00:31:12,510 --> 00:31:20,279
is the farm here this is where we build

716
00:31:17,460 --> 00:31:23,010
race here this is our feed yard here

717
00:31:20,279 --> 00:31:25,470
this is corn stocks this is winter wheat

718
00:31:23,010 --> 00:31:29,570
so this will go back to a to agreement

719
00:31:25,470 --> 00:31:29,570
cover this is going to be our post even

720
00:31:31,430 --> 00:31:35,930
just kind of a layout the thing that

721
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:38,510
I've learned the most since I've gotten

722
00:31:35,930 --> 00:31:40,370
back even on the grass pasture group if

723
00:31:38,510 --> 00:31:43,310
you have a plan going into something

724
00:31:40,370 --> 00:31:45,500
you're a lot more likely to do it rather

725
00:31:43,310 --> 00:31:48,290
than just saying well maybe I should do

726
00:31:45,500 --> 00:31:50,600
this you set yourself up with some some

727
00:31:48,290 --> 00:31:52,910
sort of a plan anything you can go

728
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:55,130
deviating from that whatever but have

729
00:31:52,910 --> 00:31:57,170
some type of plan in place I need to

730
00:31:55,130 --> 00:31:59,660
work a lot for us because it's so easy

731
00:31:57,170 --> 00:32:01,880
to say well yeah let's go ahead and move

732
00:31:59,660 --> 00:32:04,400
in taos today or whatever Jeff if you

733
00:32:01,880 --> 00:32:08,120
know what direction you want to go with

734
00:32:04,400 --> 00:32:10,160
it it's a lot easier city you know

735
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:12,170
another thing I want to compliment Casey

736
00:32:10,160 --> 00:32:14,780
Corey on because they came up with the

737
00:32:12,170 --> 00:32:16,490
plan before Kyle did come home and it

738
00:32:14,780 --> 00:32:18,710
was just wherever they wanted to go and

739
00:32:16,490 --> 00:32:20,930
they actually had it where they had a

740
00:32:18,710 --> 00:32:23,120
fence here they ran the corn stalks for

741
00:32:20,930 --> 00:32:27,830
a while we kept them off of here because

742
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,390
this is wonderfully and but excuse me it

743
00:32:27,830 --> 00:32:31,340
is not this wouldn't wait down here

744
00:32:29,390 --> 00:32:33,440
but anyway so this the full season

745
00:32:31,340 --> 00:32:35,720
grades but everything they had a plan on

746
00:32:33,440 --> 00:32:37,850
how they were going to raise them you

747
00:32:35,720 --> 00:32:41,630
know it's old and like you say this is

748
00:32:37,850 --> 00:32:43,880
planted back to Rye I like rye but so

749
00:32:41,630 --> 00:32:45,620
this is corn stocks and the and the

750
00:32:43,880 --> 00:32:47,870
heifers ran they came through the fence

751
00:32:45,620 --> 00:32:49,760
they ran here and they ran here so what

752
00:32:47,870 --> 00:32:51,860
we'll do after corn stocks we want to

753
00:32:49,760 --> 00:32:54,080
keep our carbon up we're big believers

754
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:54,920
in carbon so what we'll do is we'll come

755
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:58,250
back with oats

756
00:32:54,920 --> 00:33:01,150
we love oats we love oh so also come

757
00:32:58,250 --> 00:33:03,320
back and then and then we'll actually

758
00:33:01,150 --> 00:33:04,010
didn't come back with the cover after

759
00:33:03,320 --> 00:33:06,320
our oats

760
00:33:04,010 --> 00:33:08,240
so our heifers next year pull teas and

761
00:33:06,320 --> 00:33:09,770
grades which that's just the way it

762
00:33:08,240 --> 00:33:13,040
works and then here and then this will

763
00:33:09,770 --> 00:33:15,680
be corn stocks that right on and then

764
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:17,900
another thing this is a this is a slough

765
00:33:15,680 --> 00:33:20,390
area of what we call it where they feed

766
00:33:17,900 --> 00:33:22,550
dead for a lot of years and what we do

767
00:33:20,390 --> 00:33:24,650
now is we put a full season cover in

768
00:33:22,550 --> 00:33:27,500
there one thing to you guys on full

769
00:33:24,650 --> 00:33:29,540
season cover when you do a biome out we

770
00:33:27,500 --> 00:33:31,400
get a biomass on this and we send it in

771
00:33:29,540 --> 00:33:32,390
and the clip it at the ground so all the

772
00:33:31,400 --> 00:33:34,550
sudden you say where you are

773
00:33:32,390 --> 00:33:35,360
where are your on nitrates that's

774
00:33:34,550 --> 00:33:37,490
something you've got to be very

775
00:33:35,360 --> 00:33:40,310
concerned about don't ask your neighbor

776
00:33:37,490 --> 00:33:42,920
if it's is safe to graze find out find

777
00:33:40,310 --> 00:33:45,059
out a nitrate test and so what we were

778
00:33:42,920 --> 00:33:46,529
like we were just when

779
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:49,080
with clipped all the way to the ground

780
00:33:46,529 --> 00:33:52,080
we're right at 1,400 parts per million

781
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:53,309
so that didn't really concern us because

782
00:33:52,080 --> 00:33:57,690
we knew we're only going to let them

783
00:33:53,309 --> 00:33:59,749
have 2/3 and then KC as far as will they

784
00:33:57,690 --> 00:34:02,009
ever go back to the old paddock

785
00:33:59,749 --> 00:34:04,769
once they grade the paddock and they

786
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:06,360
move it will they go back they do I mean

787
00:34:04,769 --> 00:34:08,730
that's kind of a good telltale to when

788
00:34:06,360 --> 00:34:10,980
you do when you need to move to is if

789
00:34:08,730 --> 00:34:13,409
you come back to another one but nowhere

790
00:34:10,980 --> 00:34:15,750
every time we move it they seem to go

791
00:34:13,409 --> 00:34:18,000
after the new stuff now after we were

792
00:34:15,750 --> 00:34:19,950
all done we knew we've had so much under

793
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:21,329
the snow that we love have it for the

794
00:34:19,950 --> 00:34:24,780
whole thing for another week and it

795
00:34:21,329 --> 00:34:27,119
pretty much even expand out but they

796
00:34:24,780 --> 00:34:30,419
they love it up there that's where they

797
00:34:27,119 --> 00:34:32,760
want this is just a picture that this is

798
00:34:30,419 --> 00:34:35,310
going to be next year's cover so we cut

799
00:34:32,760 --> 00:34:36,540
silage and are kind of our goal I don't

800
00:34:35,310 --> 00:34:38,970
know if we'll get away from it right

801
00:34:36,540 --> 00:34:40,889
cases to maybe eliminate silage but I

802
00:34:38,970 --> 00:34:43,050
don't know if we will or not but we

803
00:34:40,889 --> 00:34:45,030
really like to plant right back on we're

804
00:34:43,050 --> 00:34:46,649
in wonderful country but we really

805
00:34:45,030 --> 00:34:48,569
manage your ride we don't let it ride

806
00:34:46,649 --> 00:34:50,389
get very big but it's unbelievable to

807
00:34:48,569 --> 00:34:52,829
what the root structure will be from Rye

808
00:34:50,389 --> 00:34:56,639
you know and Doug talked a lot about

809
00:34:52,829 --> 00:34:59,190
Canada and the round you know and so we

810
00:34:56,639 --> 00:35:00,960
say we can't do this and but they're

811
00:34:59,190 --> 00:35:02,790
doing it but one thing I think and this

812
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:05,069
is what we need to do I mean I'm not

813
00:35:02,790 --> 00:35:07,579
saying any of these but this is what we

814
00:35:05,069 --> 00:35:10,589
need to do they've got it they've got a

815
00:35:07,579 --> 00:35:12,780
number for their nutrient cycling and we

816
00:35:10,589 --> 00:35:15,420
need to do that as a farm we need to do

817
00:35:12,780 --> 00:35:17,220
that and we will find that out some guys

818
00:35:15,420 --> 00:35:20,040
say well what difference to make take

819
00:35:17,220 --> 00:35:23,250
half a cap I think we really need to to

820
00:35:20,040 --> 00:35:25,380
understand what's going on you can tell

821
00:35:23,250 --> 00:35:27,450
your soils healthy by looking at it has

822
00:35:25,380 --> 00:35:29,880
great texture crumbles like maurice

823
00:35:27,450 --> 00:35:32,099
chocolate cake it will have a smell of

824
00:35:29,880 --> 00:35:33,750
the freshly dug potato so if you guys

825
00:35:32,099 --> 00:35:35,220
ever come to our farm the first thing

826
00:35:33,750 --> 00:35:37,140
we're going to do is we will get some

827
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:38,520
soil i'm not going to cauldron i'm going

828
00:35:37,140 --> 00:35:40,740
to call it soil i'm going to ask you to

829
00:35:38,520 --> 00:35:43,310
smell it because it will smell if you've

830
00:35:40,740 --> 00:35:46,140
got healthy soil yourself soil tell you

831
00:35:43,310 --> 00:35:47,849
our farm and ranch fields we should do

832
00:35:46,140 --> 00:35:50,160
everything we can to make this a better

833
00:35:47,849 --> 00:35:52,230
world you know we do not ask ourselves

834
00:35:50,160 --> 00:35:54,420
why we know the answer and the picture's

835
00:35:52,230 --> 00:35:58,000
worth a thousand words we've got a

836
00:35:54,420 --> 00:36:01,000
little clip here of the time-lapse

837
00:35:58,000 --> 00:36:02,950
um that we're going to show and it was

838
00:36:01,000 --> 00:36:04,870
kind of neat the NRCS say they put a

839
00:36:02,950 --> 00:36:07,150
camera out when the cover crop was just

840
00:36:04,870 --> 00:36:10,060
tall and it's still out there right now

841
00:36:07,150 --> 00:36:14,200
but they're going to Joshua guns this is

842
00:36:10,060 --> 00:36:16,450
uh in the middle of though like the

843
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:18,850
third week in November so you can kind

844
00:36:16,450 --> 00:36:20,680
of see what we're up against but you

845
00:36:18,850 --> 00:36:23,380
could see on a normal year where we

846
00:36:20,680 --> 00:36:26,070
would had a pretty good grade even there

847
00:36:23,380 --> 00:36:26,070
we could handle

848
00:36:30,980 --> 00:36:35,500
ladies getting beer in the picture we do

849
00:36:40,200 --> 00:36:46,570
Randy Halverson it was a contract with

850
00:36:43,090 --> 00:36:48,160
NRCS and and and there are a ton Dakota

851
00:36:46,570 --> 00:36:49,720
lakes the cameras are still there and

852
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:51,820
the cameras still out there so it's

853
00:36:49,720 --> 00:36:55,270
going to be well you can see here now

854
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:56,920
we're getting to the end I mean it's the

855
00:36:55,270 --> 00:36:58,210
college route to your grazing right now

856
00:36:56,920 --> 00:37:02,110
and you'll be able to see the deer right

857
00:36:58,210 --> 00:37:06,640
see there's a deer right now just so you

858
00:37:02,110 --> 00:37:08,530
think well that's about enough snow so

859
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:10,390
you can see what we were up against I

860
00:37:08,530 --> 00:37:14,050
mean so I feel really good about what

861
00:37:10,390 --> 00:37:16,630
happened because I don't you Casey still

862
00:37:14,050 --> 00:37:20,350
save a ton of evening by doing all this

863
00:37:16,630 --> 00:37:22,720
and close into the soils and so is this

864
00:37:20,350 --> 00:37:24,790
so is this a one year out of 10 it

865
00:37:22,720 --> 00:37:26,230
probably is that's just like saying is

866
00:37:24,790 --> 00:37:28,390
there going to be dry next year well I'm

867
00:37:26,230 --> 00:37:29,950
not going to go plant my corn very heavy

868
00:37:28,390 --> 00:37:31,870
to that's going to be dry so we're going

869
00:37:29,950 --> 00:37:35,040
to go ahead with things and we're going

870
00:37:31,870 --> 00:37:35,040
to take the average so

871
00:37:41,839 --> 00:37:43,900
you
