[Music]

2
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:18,800
so i'm holly katrin

3
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:20,560
and i'm going to present on a sare grant

4
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:23,840
that we completed

5
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:26,560
introducing a new or a unique

6
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:30,160
application of cover crops in a garden

7
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:32,880
market operation

8
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:33,600
these are just a few um farm pictures

9
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:36,160
and

10
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:37,840
my husband jim and i had a dream to own

11
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:39,840
a farm

12
00:00:37,840 --> 00:00:41,360
i grew up on the corner of a family farm

13
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:44,079
up in northern indiana

14
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:45,600
and we were for some reason all about it

15
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:47,840
and kind of compelled to own it and

16
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,680
sometimes i think people that farm

17
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:52,079
are like driven to do it it's like you

18
00:00:49,680 --> 00:00:55,760
have to do it so that's how we felt

19
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:58,079
so um we were all about

20
00:00:55,760 --> 00:01:00,239
animals and just having fun on the farm

21
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,160
and then healthy food

22
00:01:00,239 --> 00:01:04,159
we have seven grandkids and we like to

23
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:07,519
teach them about food and farming and

24
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,519
kind of some of those roots

25
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:12,000
so we purchased a 11 and a half acre

26
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,880
farm in lebanon

27
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:17,439
indiana which is in boone county and we

28
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:21,759
named it hallelujah acres farm

29
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:21,759
and here's just a a picture of it

30
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:26,159
we wanted to our first goal was to grow

31
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:28,320
our own produce

32
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,479
and be able to preserve that and kind of

33
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,320
eat it year round

34
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,600
and you can see our barn there but the

35
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:35,759
first

36
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:36,799
piece of land that we tilled was just in

37
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:40,240
front of the barn

38
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:43,040
on the side it hadn't been tilled before

39
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:45,280
it was under grass and then you can see

40
00:01:43,040 --> 00:01:46,640
in the distance those um there were two

41
00:01:45,280 --> 00:01:49,360
pastures

42
00:01:46,640 --> 00:01:51,280
there's two pastures on the farm that we

43
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:53,759
ended up tilling up one of them so

44
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:56,560
probably about a half an acre total

45
00:01:53,759 --> 00:01:58,159
and then beyond that was a small um

46
00:01:56,560 --> 00:02:02,079
woods

47
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:05,600
and then to the left was a six acre

48
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:06,399
hay field so we purchased our little

49
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,520
tractor

50
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,640
and began to work our soil which was the

51
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:14,400
sandy loam

52
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:17,040
type of soil at that point the state of

53
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:20,560
the soil was very clumpy

54
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:22,879
it retained water it was really hard to

55
00:02:20,560 --> 00:02:25,120
plant seeds in it and then get the seeds

56
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:27,680
to grow subsequently

57
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:30,000
so we began right away to use some

58
00:02:27,680 --> 00:02:32,080
winter cover crops we used a mixture of

59
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,160
crimson clover

60
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:39,120
daikon radish and oats

61
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:39,599
and we also added some compost to the

62
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:42,800
land

63
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:46,400
so after about two years that soil was

64
00:02:42,800 --> 00:02:49,120
easy to work it was more porous

65
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:50,000
had a lot of earthworms in it and in

66
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:52,080
many cases we

67
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:53,760
didn't need to tell so in that length of

68
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:57,519
time we just saw this

69
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:57,519
significant change in our soil

70
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:04,319
so do you use cover crops now is one of

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:06,560
my questions and we've heard a lot about

72
00:03:04,319 --> 00:03:07,599
the benefits of it but we are like true

73
00:03:06,560 --> 00:03:09,840
believers in it

74
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:11,200
um healthy soil is critical to plant

75
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:13,920
growth

76
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:16,640
and a sustainable way to build the soil

77
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:19,840
is through the use of these cover crops

78
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:22,159
sown after the plants are harvested

79
00:03:19,840 --> 00:03:23,120
in the fall usually late summer to early

80
00:03:22,159 --> 00:03:27,040
fall

81
00:03:23,120 --> 00:03:28,799
and then incorporated in the spring

82
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:30,560
but one of the questions in our minds

83
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:34,560
was can cover crops

84
00:03:30,560 --> 00:03:34,560
do more so can we do more with it

85
00:03:34,879 --> 00:03:41,200
so in the meantime um having grown our

86
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:42,480
own food in 2016 we became a market

87
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:45,040
garden

88
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,000
our goal was to provide healthy chemical

89
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,400
free food to

90
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:49,760
our community and in boone county there

91
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,799
weren't a lot of

92
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,480
growers at that time so the timing was

93
00:03:52,799 --> 00:03:58,319
perfect for us to do this and

94
00:03:54,480 --> 00:04:03,280
we were well received in the community

95
00:03:58,319 --> 00:04:05,439
um we uh participated in two local

96
00:04:03,280 --> 00:04:07,599
farmers markets and this picture is a

97
00:04:05,439 --> 00:04:08,560
picture of the whitestown farmers market

98
00:04:07,599 --> 00:04:11,680
which was

99
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:15,360
relatively new at that time

100
00:04:11,680 --> 00:04:18,320
we managed 25 csas

101
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:19,440
we provided some on-farm sales and some

102
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:24,080
online sales

103
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:28,080
also through one of the food hubs

104
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:31,520
and we had fruit vegetables eggs we also

105
00:04:28,080 --> 00:04:34,960
had some dairy goats

106
00:04:31,520 --> 00:04:36,720
so we did some herd shares offered those

107
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,160
and then we had a really small mushroom

108
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:39,680
operation because we

109
00:04:38,160 --> 00:04:42,080
learned about that and couldn't help but

110
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:45,280
do it so we had that

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,639
um and if you're not familiar with the

112
00:04:45,280 --> 00:04:48,639
sara grants

113
00:04:46,639 --> 00:04:50,080
i like to think of them as kind of an

114
00:04:48,639 --> 00:04:52,720
experiment

115
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:54,560
so basically you get a grant and you're

116
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:55,759
trying to solve a problem that you have

117
00:04:54,560 --> 00:04:57,919
on your farm

118
00:04:55,759 --> 00:05:00,000
in this case our problem was a lot of

119
00:04:57,919 --> 00:05:02,160
weed pressure um probably

120
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:03,120
probably because what we tilled up was

121
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,639
pasture and

122
00:05:03,120 --> 00:05:07,600
um grass area so when we were thinking

123
00:05:06,639 --> 00:05:09,360
about

124
00:05:07,600 --> 00:05:11,039
and learned about the sare projects we

125
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:13,360
thought about three different options

126
00:05:11,039 --> 00:05:14,960
and they're kind of listed here

127
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:16,880
but this controlling weeds through

128
00:05:14,960 --> 00:05:18,800
interceded cover crops

129
00:05:16,880 --> 00:05:20,240
but then we also thought effective

130
00:05:18,800 --> 00:05:22,000
succession planting

131
00:05:20,240 --> 00:05:24,720
on the soil would be a good one or

132
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:27,039
control pass-through companion planning

133
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:29,039
so we did go ahead and apply for that

134
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:31,840
first one

135
00:05:29,039 --> 00:05:33,680
the sarah grant really funds research

136
00:05:31,840 --> 00:05:35,600
and education projects

137
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
and they keep all that knowledge in a

138
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,160
database so that you can go and refer to

139
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:43,280
that when you're looking for information

140
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:46,800
we applied for the farmer rancher grant

141
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,800
and the program's run since 1988

142
00:05:46,800 --> 00:05:50,560
and it funds projects and conducts

143
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:53,840
outreach designed to improve

144
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:53,840
agricultural systems

145
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,840
okay

146
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:05,280
so our project specifics our goal was to

147
00:06:03,759 --> 00:06:08,000
measure the effectiveness

148
00:06:05,280 --> 00:06:10,000
of inter-seeded cover crops for

149
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:12,639
proactive weed prevention

150
00:06:10,000 --> 00:06:14,639
in a chemical-free low-till vegetable

151
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:19,440
market operation

152
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:22,080
and we received 7 500 was awarded to us

153
00:06:19,440 --> 00:06:23,600
what we wanted to compare is the labor

154
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:27,120
and cost

155
00:06:23,600 --> 00:06:29,600
to implement our prevention strategies

156
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,440
the weed pressure so kind of the results

157
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:35,039
of our work

158
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:38,000
the labor to remove the weeds

159
00:06:35,039 --> 00:06:38,720
and then the impact of soil health of

160
00:06:38,000 --> 00:06:41,680
using the

161
00:06:38,720 --> 00:06:41,680
various methods

162
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:47,600
one of the tasks that we had to complete

163
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:49,520
was um

164
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:50,880
choosing what cover crops we were going

165
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:53,520
to use

166
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:55,680
for the i call it an experiment but for

167
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:58,639
the project okay

168
00:06:55,680 --> 00:07:00,240
that piece was not as easy as it seemed

169
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:02,400
it would be

170
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:05,199
you have to look at the cover crops and

171
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:08,400
say do they use or produce the nutrients

172
00:07:05,199 --> 00:07:13,520
that that specific plant needs

173
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,520
do they conserve or use soil moisture

174
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:18,880
and do they encourage or discourage

175
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:18,880
insect pests

176
00:07:18,960 --> 00:07:22,160
what is the length of the growth cycle

177
00:07:21,120 --> 00:07:26,720
of the cover crop

178
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:28,720
compared to the actual vegetable crop

179
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:32,479
and then when do you plant it to have

180
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:34,319
that impact on weed prevention

181
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:36,160
here are two of my favorite resources

182
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:36,479
and i noticed lori had one of these up

183
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:40,160
but

184
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:43,599
um this managing cover crops profitably

185
00:07:40,160 --> 00:07:47,440
is a sare handbook

186
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:50,800
and then the cover crop field guide

187
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:52,240
we found was really helpful in doing

188
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,440
this but it took a little while to

189
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:56,479
analyze this which

190
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,479
kind of surprised me

191
00:07:56,720 --> 00:08:01,280
so our final decisions um we took

192
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:03,599
several of our different crops so we

193
00:08:01,280 --> 00:08:05,919
took green peppers

194
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,360
and decided that we would try some with

195
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:10,160
the buckwheat

196
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:12,240
as that inner seeded cover crop we would

197
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:14,319
try some with paper mulch

198
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,000
and some with hoeing and kind of compare

199
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:17,039
and contrast those to see what our

200
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:20,720
results are

201
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:22,160
were tomatoes we looked at crimson

202
00:08:20,720 --> 00:08:25,759
clover

203
00:08:22,160 --> 00:08:28,560
interceded red plastic mulch

204
00:08:25,759 --> 00:08:28,560
or hoeing

205
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,880
summer squash we wanted to try the

206
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:36,560
icicle radishes and thought they could

207
00:08:32,880 --> 00:08:36,560
also be a secondary crop

208
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:43,519
hoeing and nasturtiums

209
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:46,720
and then for the broccoli and onion we

210
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,920
looked at crimson clover plastic mulch

211
00:08:46,720 --> 00:08:50,720
for the onion only

212
00:08:47,920 --> 00:08:50,720
and then hoeing

213
00:08:53,040 --> 00:08:58,080
our process um was to first submit some

214
00:08:57,040 --> 00:09:01,200
soil tests

215
00:08:58,080 --> 00:09:03,839
um like the pre

216
00:09:01,200 --> 00:09:05,120
count the reeds weed starts so if you

217
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:08,320
look at the picture

218
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:10,800
um here we built a box

219
00:09:08,320 --> 00:09:12,959
like one foot by one foot and in order

220
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:14,880
to count the weed starts we would place

221
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:17,120
the box on the ground and then count

222
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,240
what was within it so that gave us a way

223
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,839
to um

224
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:22,880
compare you know how many weeds were

225
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:25,360
there

226
00:09:22,880 --> 00:09:27,839
compare the cost and time for

227
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,800
installation

228
00:09:27,839 --> 00:09:30,800
track our labor

229
00:09:30,880 --> 00:09:34,080
and then take all of our data and

230
00:09:32,640 --> 00:09:37,200
compare it and then

231
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,160
be able to report that out and then

232
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:41,760
finally submit

233
00:09:38,160 --> 00:09:43,120
soil test post because one of our

234
00:09:41,760 --> 00:09:46,160
thoughts was that

235
00:09:43,120 --> 00:09:48,720
because we're using these cover crops

236
00:09:46,160 --> 00:09:51,519
we thought the soil might improved

237
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,839
improved through that use

238
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,760
and you can see here the tracking sheet

239
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:59,040
we used in our um

240
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,560
garden where we specified what crop and

241
00:09:59,040 --> 00:10:04,160
row and the date

242
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:07,920
what we did the weed count at that time

243
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,920
and then the the time it took us

244
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:14,720
so for our results i'll just run through

245
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:18,399
those quickly but

246
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:18,959
um we decided that for hold on one

247
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:21,519
second

248
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,399
okay that we would use the paper mulch

249
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:26,079
for the green

250
00:10:22,399 --> 00:10:27,200
peppers or be very careful um how we

251
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:29,040
planted the buckwheat

252
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:31,360
so as you can see on the picture on the

253
00:10:29,040 --> 00:10:32,480
right in the center there that actually

254
00:10:31,360 --> 00:10:35,360
is a green pepper

255
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:36,720
okay so we planted the buckwheat it grew

256
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:39,600
very quickly

257
00:10:36,720 --> 00:10:42,240
we had kind of a coolish spring so that

258
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:45,040
green pepper plant did not grow quickly

259
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,800
and we ended up with um the buckwheat

260
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:49,200
overshadowing the green pepper so this

261
00:10:46,800 --> 00:10:51,680
is just to me a good illustration of

262
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,720
um picking the proper timing and maybe

263
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,360
the proper

264
00:10:52,720 --> 00:10:55,360
cover crop

265
00:10:56,399 --> 00:11:01,200
with tomatoes we're going to use the

266
00:10:58,640 --> 00:11:03,279
plastic mulch for the tomatoes

267
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,519
we did the inner seeding of the crimson

268
00:11:03,279 --> 00:11:06,800
clover and it it just did not work out

269
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:09,040
well for us

270
00:11:06,800 --> 00:11:11,120
we had a lot of weed pressure so that

271
00:11:09,040 --> 00:11:14,240
may be some reason for that

272
00:11:11,120 --> 00:11:16,560
but overall it just didn't for us do the

273
00:11:14,240 --> 00:11:16,560
trick

274
00:11:18,240 --> 00:11:22,959
for the summer squash we had a great

275
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:26,640
success using those icicle radishes

276
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:29,519
um we only usually use one

277
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:32,079
plant um planting and we would use

278
00:11:29,519 --> 00:11:34,079
multiple plantings in the future

279
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:35,120
um we were able to use those as

280
00:11:34,079 --> 00:11:38,240
secondary

281
00:11:35,120 --> 00:11:41,279
crops and you could just plant those

282
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:44,240
several times and take them out and

283
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:45,279
that would work well and then we did not

284
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
have

285
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:49,200
any luck with the nasturtiums um for

286
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:52,480
some reason nasturtiums

287
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:54,639
never grew well in our soil so we

288
00:11:52,480 --> 00:11:57,440
were going to go back to marigolds for

289
00:11:54,639 --> 00:12:02,000
some of the pest prevention

290
00:11:57,440 --> 00:12:04,800
we did use white clover in the aisles

291
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:06,959
and that was very successful in fixing

292
00:12:04,800 --> 00:12:07,839
nitrogen so you can see the picture to

293
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:10,880
the right

294
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:13,040
the white dots are actually nitrogen

295
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:13,920
that was fixed in the soil as a result

296
00:12:13,040 --> 00:12:16,639
of that

297
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:18,240
white clover so that was a good thing

298
00:12:16,639 --> 00:12:21,519
and that would make that nitrogen

299
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:21,519
available to the plants

300
00:12:23,360 --> 00:12:27,360
um for broccoli and onion we will use

301
00:12:25,519 --> 00:12:29,440
the plastic mulch for the onions

302
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:32,160
and the crimson clover worked well for

303
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:32,160
the broccoli

304
00:12:34,720 --> 00:12:38,800
here's a chart that kind of illustrates

305
00:12:37,360 --> 00:12:40,639
some of our data

306
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:42,240
on the left hand side we're looking at

307
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:44,800
weed count

308
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,880
the yellow is the hoeing the green is

309
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:49,920
the cover crop and the

310
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:52,240
kind of the orange or red is the

311
00:12:49,920 --> 00:12:55,040
plastic mulch and you can see that the

312
00:12:52,240 --> 00:12:57,279
as far as weed count

313
00:12:55,040 --> 00:13:01,360
the plastic mulch was most effective but

314
00:12:57,279 --> 00:13:03,120
the cover crop was pretty close to it

315
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:05,279
in the center one the same thing with

316
00:13:03,120 --> 00:13:07,120
time and this did include the time also

317
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,800
to remove the weeds so it makes sense

318
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:10,959
that it's pretty consistent with the

319
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:14,000
wheat count

320
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:18,079
and then finally on the right hand chart

321
00:13:14,000 --> 00:13:21,519
the cost to install the mulch

322
00:13:18,079 --> 00:13:22,720
was the plastic mulch was higher than

323
00:13:21,519 --> 00:13:24,639
the cost to

324
00:13:22,720 --> 00:13:27,040
plant the cover crops so that's

325
00:13:24,639 --> 00:13:30,079
something to consider

326
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,079
in your operation

327
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:36,800
we were able to hold a couple of grant

328
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:38,399
sarah grant field days they encourage

329
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:39,920
that you share your

330
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:42,399
information you receive with your

331
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
community and we had the boone county

332
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:46,800
master gardeners in our garden

333
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:48,720
and hosted them to talk about this sarah

334
00:13:46,800 --> 00:13:50,160
grant and we also worked with the

335
00:13:48,720 --> 00:13:53,360
lebanon high school

336
00:13:50,160 --> 00:14:02,370
ffa group and they came out to the farm

337
00:13:53,360 --> 00:14:19,600
to learn about this

338
00:14:02,370 --> 00:14:21,680
[Music]

339
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:21,680
