  "text": "everybody this is Ross in today's video I thought I'd give you guys a bit of a seedling update show you guys how they're doing what my plans are for these seedlings here you can see obviously now we've got them in the greenhouse and then we'll show you guys the cold frame because that's where they're gonna be going I'm gonna be planting them actually quite soon you can see that the sugar snappies have done exceptionally well I mean look how beautiful they are I had pretty good germination this year and then also you can see over here that I have the the broccoli and the Brussels sprouts they're a bit lankier than I'd like probably cuz of the lighting that we had in inside the house when we we germinated these but I figured because we're getting you know this greenhouse off to a head start this year you know we've turned on the heater for those of you guys who saw that video we turned on the small space heater down here in the greenhouse and that's heating this we've also we took the the tarp off the top [Music] so now we're letting some light come in and you know it's heating up through the day and it's also staying heated through the night then also the fact that there's just less stuff in here then the normally is I have you know two pots stacked high of fig trees but normally we have like four or five so there's almost like even double the amount of trees in here or there's half the amount of trees in here then there normally is so I figure I have a lot of room and I can actually do some seating this year inside the greenhouse and I'm like wow that's awesome I'm seeing a lot of great benefits out of this obviously you know it's a lot less work it's a lot less hassle right and how to deal with lights and the inside the house a lot to do with making a mess inside the house just obviously much better off doing it this way I want to show you guys the cold frame because we did beef it up a lot of you guys had recommend it to me when we showed you guys that video some improvements and a lot of you were right I made those improvements and it's looking great it's also really hot and really warm in there because the greenhouse is actually warming up pretty nicely but mostly that's with the help of this heater but you'd be surprised I think even without the gear how much during the day this cold frame actually gets heated up and not only that but the the soil is staying really warm that's really been the key and I'm able to transplant those those snap peas and the broccoli and the brussel sprouts as soon as they fill up those cells and those trays I don't really see a you know a time limit on all this I think this thing's pretty much ready to go to be planted into and you can see one of the recommendations that some of you guys had made was these kind of support the the cold frame in the middle because a lot of the water if it snows or if it rains is gonna collect on top of this and the plastic is gonna collapse and actually believe it or not it did that I think it was Rocco that recommended that and one other person but it actually did that literally the day after and I was sick I couldn't come out here and observe the thing and take care of it but you guys were right so I beefed it up a bit hopefully that's enough I also added some like support in the back here to help lift the the plastic to give it more of an angle and then I also want to show you guys the insight here something bare with me while I open this up we also made an improvement on the inside based off of another recommendation which is obviously brilliant and obviously how it should be but you can see we've sort of wrapped the plastic from the outside brought it on the inside and then stapled it to the inside of the frame with a staple gun and then someone recommended just get some trim and drill the trim pressure-treated trim to the plastic to give it some extra protection that way this plastic isn't really coming off the frame here or at least it's quite difficult for it to come off but you can obviously see I mean I've been noticing quite a big difference in just the last few days that I've had this this cold frame altogether these plants are really starting to take off and it's really all in the soil temperatures I put my hand in here touch the ground even just a you know touching it with my hand the difference is quite extreme I have to get a thermometer to know for sure but I would say it's a good 10 to 15 degree difference and just soil temperatures alone so I'm pretty excited you know that's that's really what's gonna happen here is that we've got the seedlings in there you know everything that I want to start this year in this cold frame is gonna get started it's off to a good start I'm pretty happy about that it's also sort of got me thinking about potentially what else can I do in this greenhouse I'm thinking about doing some citrus trees bringing them from you know inside the house putting them in the greenhouse or even next year I can get myself a couple loquats I can get myself maybe a few more tropical trees guys and really strongly consider trying that again like the citrus but even more tropical than that and then having them fruit for me you know earlier in the year is really the goal things like the citrus can fruit for me throughout the winter or even in the spring and the very early spring maybe even the loquat the loquats can do that as well so I'd be interested to see if I can do that in the house for most of the winter and then bring them out when I take the cover off the greenhouse put the heater on I think it'd be a fun and interesting experiment and I'm sure we'd have pretty decent success so I want to thank you guys here for watching this one check
