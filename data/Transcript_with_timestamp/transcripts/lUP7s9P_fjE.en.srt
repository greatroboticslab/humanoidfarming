00:00:52,020 --> 00:00:56,489
farmers are changing out the seed to try

20
00:00:54,120 --> 00:00:58,890
a different variety farmers sometimes

00:00:58,890 --> 00:01:03,780
which type grows better the hoppers are

23
00:01:01,739 --> 00:01:06,299
the yellow plastic bins that hold the

24
00:01:03,780 --> 00:01:08,460
seed while they're empty the farmers

25
00:01:06,299 --> 00:01:11,040
check the seed brushes which clean off

26
00:01:08,460 --> 00:01:14,299
debris from cottonseed right before they

27
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,299
are dropped into the soil

00:02:40,599 --> 00:02:50,290
thousands of years this spray is a

41
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:52,870
pesticide to help fight bugs and a

42
00:02:50,290 --> 00:02:55,260
fertilizer to help the cotton grow this

00:02:52,870 --> 00:02:58,629
planner plants twelve rows of the tongue

44
00:02:55,260 --> 00:03:00,730
depositing two seeds every 13 inches it

45
00:02:58,629 --> 00:03:02,860
will take around two months to plant

46
00:03:00,730 --> 00:03:04,810
four thousand acres of cotton which will

47
00:03:02,860 --> 00:03:06,550
be ready for picking in six to eight

48
00:03:04,810 --> 00:03:21,389

00:03:24,970 --> 00:03:32,500
that changes to pink as the bloom dries

52
00:03:28,060 --> 00:03:34,989
a hard ball or a bowl is formed the soft

53
00:03:32,500 --> 00:03:37,420
cotton emerges when this bowl cracks

54
00:03:34,989 --> 00:03:39,130
open now it's time to pick the cotton

55
00:03:37,420 --> 00:03:42,220
which will take about three to four

56
00:03:39,130 --> 00:03:44,560
months with a great big huge machine

00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:49,150
equipment the cotton picker it won't be

60
00:03:49,150 --> 00:03:53,920
ready to be picked these yellow

61
00:03:51,160 --> 00:03:56,080
triangles cover up barbed spindles that

62
00:03:53,920 --> 00:03:58,420
rotate quickly to pick the cotton the

63
00:03:56,080 --> 00:04:00,940
black tubes blow it upward into the

64
00:03:58,420 --> 00:04:03,190
basket when the basket gets full the

65
00:04:00,940 --> 00:04:05,200
cotton is dumped into the back module

66
00:04:03,190 --> 00:04:09,010
builder which presses it into a round

67
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:10,989
shape the cotton has been bailed and

68
00:04:09,010 --> 00:04:13,750
wrapped the farmer decides when and

69
00:04:10,989 --> 00:04:15,970
where to drop the module a round cotton

70
00:04:13,750 --> 00:04:18,310
module can weigh six thousand pounds

71
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:20,919
that three tons are as much as an

72
00:04:18,310 --> 00:04:23,950
elephant the modules will be taken to a

73
00:04:20,919 --> 00:04:26,350
local gym to be separated into seed lint

74
00:04:23,950 --> 00:04:28,890
and trash it will then be taken to a

75
00:04:26,350 --> 00:04:39,129
