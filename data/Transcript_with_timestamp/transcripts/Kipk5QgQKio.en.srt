1
00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:04,520
so we've been building um a big water

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:05,920
system to send we have a lot of

3
00:00:04,520 --> 00:00:08,480
elevation change in this property

4
00:00:05,920 --> 00:00:10,679
there's several probably 500 feet from

5
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:13,960
top to bottom or 400 and something feet

6
00:00:10,679 --> 00:00:17,080
so we're we have a spring at the bottom

7
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:19,720
so we've been sending that water up high

8
00:00:17,080 --> 00:00:21,720
and then storing it high and then using

9
00:00:19,720 --> 00:00:24,439
it to gravity feed through like

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:27,199
irrigated pastures and you know I I kind

11
00:00:24,439 --> 00:00:30,160
of have this dream of building a small

12
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:32,680
hydroelectric plant like just like a 2in

13
00:00:30,160 --> 00:00:34,440
PVC pipe with a hydroelectric plant so

14
00:00:32,680 --> 00:00:36,280
you know at night I can spring that

15
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:38,160
water back down the hill and create

16
00:00:36,280 --> 00:00:39,520
power at night which is what my problem

17
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:41,640
is now right I have so much power during

18
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:43,760
the day but nothing at night so if I can

19
00:00:41,640 --> 00:00:45,239
send the water uphill and at night pull

20
00:00:43,760 --> 00:00:47,160
it back down through a hydro little

21
00:00:45,239 --> 00:00:49,039
hydrop plant and just feed my system

22
00:00:47,160 --> 00:00:50,840
then then I'm fully so you know I never

23
00:00:49,039 --> 00:00:53,120
need that generator to turn on do you

24
00:00:50,840 --> 00:00:54,760
also irrigate along the way yeah you can

25
00:00:53,120 --> 00:00:56,680
so then we'd pull it down and then we'd

26
00:00:54,760 --> 00:00:59,399
we we'd go even further and irrigate

27
00:00:56,680 --> 00:01:00,440
farther down with it so um you know with

28
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:02,960
the animal

29
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:06,040
right now we don't

30
00:01:02,960 --> 00:01:09,479
have like we could we could probably

31
00:01:06,040 --> 00:01:09,479
keep growing our herd a little bit but
