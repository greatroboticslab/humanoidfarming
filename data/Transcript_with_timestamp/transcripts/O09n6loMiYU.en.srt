1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:04,240
I'm Mike with new way egg and also drone

2
00:00:02,600 --> 00:00:06,440
deer recovery we've talked about it for

3
00:00:04,240 --> 00:00:10,120
a long time that we're going to release

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:12,719
our own egg drone trailer and here it is

5
00:00:10,120 --> 00:00:15,440
I'm super excited this thing is

6
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:17,320
basically 99% done there's only one

7
00:00:15,440 --> 00:00:18,880
small thing that isn't completely done

8
00:00:17,320 --> 00:00:20,400
so I'll point that out once we get up

9
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:25,400
top but we're going to start with this

10
00:00:20,400 --> 00:00:28,720
it is a deck over 22t trailer built with

11
00:00:25,400 --> 00:00:31,320
a 32t flight deck up top for your drone

12
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:34,440
so it's going to be absolutely the best

13
00:00:31,320 --> 00:00:37,520
trailer if you're looking to do a lot of

14
00:00:34,440 --> 00:00:39,520
Acres so farmers or custom applicators

15
00:00:37,520 --> 00:00:43,079
that are really wanting to cover Acres

16
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,800
this is built to run the DJI drones the

17
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:48,280
t40s you're going to get two DJI

18
00:00:45,800 --> 00:00:50,360
generators they're set up with charge

19
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:52,680
boxes up top so those have cooling

20
00:00:50,360 --> 00:00:55,879
station in them as well it's got power

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:57,800
running up top to the top deck so you

22
00:00:55,879 --> 00:01:00,039
get your uh charges done and your

23
00:00:57,800 --> 00:01:01,559
batteries there and then you get power

24
00:01:00,039 --> 00:01:03,039
up there as well for charging your

25
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:07,360
controllers or something like that it's

26
00:01:03,039 --> 00:01:10,320
going to come with a Honda GX 160 to

27
00:01:07,360 --> 00:01:12,200
pump this will basically run on idle and

28
00:01:10,320 --> 00:01:14,799
have enough it'll always be circulating

29
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:18,600
it's a 2-in pump up to 200 gallons per

30
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:21,360
minute so plenty of pressure so 1,000g

31
00:01:18,600 --> 00:01:22,680
clear water tank and the 175 gallon

32
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:25,520
induction tank this is where you're

33
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:27,479
going to do your chemical mixing but up

34
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:30,880
top that's where it gets good so the

35
00:01:27,479 --> 00:01:33,119
flight deck up top is welded by Amish

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:35,119
craftsmanship it's the best stuff that

37
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:38,200
we can do in this area I'm telling you

38
00:01:35,119 --> 00:01:41,560
it's strong we did not go cheap I wanted

39
00:01:38,200 --> 00:01:43,320
the very best strong Top Flight Deck and

40
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:45,240
so that's what we got with this uh

41
00:01:43,320 --> 00:01:48,399
Flight Deck let's hop up top and I'll

42
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:51,960
show you the super secret sauce that we

43
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,960
have that nobody else has right

44
00:01:53,040 --> 00:01:59,360
now all right so up top what I'm super

45
00:01:55,759 --> 00:02:01,079
excited about is this floor this is the

46
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:04,280
part where we're just not completely

47
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:05,759
done this floor up top will be one solid

48
00:02:04,280 --> 00:02:07,119
piece currently we have a couple

49
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:09,360
different pieces but it's going to be

50
00:02:07,119 --> 00:02:11,239
one solid piece in the trailers that are

51
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:13,920
being mass-produced I'm telling you guys

52
00:02:11,239 --> 00:02:15,720
I did over 11,000 acres in Indiana last

53
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:18,120
year great you know this is where we

54
00:02:15,720 --> 00:02:20,879
come up through when we get on the top

55
00:02:18,120 --> 00:02:22,640
deck we got the railing up top here this

56
00:02:20,879 --> 00:02:24,319
is the power if you want to charge your

57
00:02:22,640 --> 00:02:26,519
controllers and that type of thing this

58
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,840
is to put an umbrella to to have some

59
00:02:26,519 --> 00:02:31,319
shade you're going to get a hose rail as

60
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:33,599
well it it'll go all the way out to the

61
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:36,080
the farthest drone that's set out there

62
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:38,160
this is another cool thing that I think

63
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:42,480
I haven't seen another trailer that has

64
00:02:38,160 --> 00:02:45,000
done this but we built the charge boxes

65
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
into the deck of the trailer and why we

66
00:02:45,000 --> 00:02:48,599
did this is we want to be really

67
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,879
efficient we don't want to be carrying

68
00:02:48,599 --> 00:02:53,360
batteries from the front to the back you

69
00:02:50,879 --> 00:02:56,640
grab one obviously lift with your legs

70
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:59,840
come over here drop it in and you're

71
00:02:56,640 --> 00:03:01,840
like within two steps from you know

72
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:04,280
being able to put your battery into your

73
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:07,680
drone that is one thing that I haven't

74
00:03:04,280 --> 00:03:07,680
seen anybody else do the
