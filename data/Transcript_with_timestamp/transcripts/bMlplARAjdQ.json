  "text": "hi i'm chris i'm here at the experimental greenhouse at crop king in lodi ohio to talk about hydroponics and not just hydroponics we've covered the process of hydroponics in previous episodes but i want to talk to you now about what can you grow hydroponically that means what can we grow with just water nutrients in the absence of dirt and the answer is going to be almost anything so we're in the lettuce house right now but there's so much going on here in addition to lettuce including the varieties of lettuce we have iceberg romaine we talked about the desktop nft system and that's what we're using here not the desktop but the nft or nutrient film technique and from seed to harvest we're talking six weeks let's talk about some other things in addition to lettuce that we can grow hydroponically all right so we're here at the crop king tomato house obviously one of the things that are the predominant crop in here is tomatoes these are vine crops those are most of the crops that we'll be looking at today and you'll see that they are supported with these this twine um to kind of make sure that they don't snap or break under the weight of the bearing the fruit that they're bearing but they grow so well in here it's a controlled environment it is a little bright hence the sunglasses i'm not trying to be too cool here for the video but i am trying to make sure i'm not looking at you squinting the whole time but tomatoes are a huge crop here at crop king they're beautiful it's everything is just uh absolutely gorgeous and you see coming up behind me uh my sidekick jimmy here hi jimmy to see what you're doing oh well we're talking about all the cool things that we grow here in the in the tomato house it's unbelievable i just walk them back through there yeah why don't you go head back there and see uh i thought i heard something fall over there are you checking out time to hang out for a little bit well see what happened over there we'll be right back yeah sure all right friends so we're gonna take a walk down this aisle here taking a look at some of the other crops other than tomatoes that we grow here at crop canyon if you thought that you could not grow melons hydroponically you are wrong we have this gorgeous vine of what looks to be cantaloupe i'm not showing you the exact variety man do they produce look at this this is straight off of this vine i can't figure out how to tell if a melon is ripe or not so viewers if you have a tip or trick to you got to look for to determine if a melon is ripe other than just cutting it open well we'd love to hear from you thump on it so we've talked about tomatoes we've talked about melons we're going to go down a little bit farther to get into some other produce that we're growing here and we're also going to talk about the manner in which we grow these we talked about the lettuce and the nutrient film technique that they use but these vining crops use a little bit different technique same principle we're using water and nutrients to grow but it's just a little bit different as far as how we grow them we're continuing our tour of the crop king tomato house just to explore all the different kind of vine crops we can grow here hydroponically and i want to talk a little bit about the system that we use so nft systems are great for your leafy vegetables herbs things like that but over here we use what's called a beto bucket or you might have heard it as a dutch bucket system to grow our crops that's the system that we use to grow our vine crops versus the nft system that is used for a lot of our leafy crops and herbs and things like that the big difference is just the growing medium that the plants are are in so with these vine crops we want to give it enough room to get a nice big root and that's going to take place inside this bucket that is filled with the growing medium perlite so perlite basically there's no nutrients in perlite whatsoever it's just basically the medium that we use to allow the plants to root and become stable but plants here get so big that we still have to use a support string to hold them up so the way this works we know our nft system our nutrient film technique pumps water in it runs a small stream down the middle of a channel that the roots sit down in and it pulls out the nutrients with the beto system we pump water in using these drip spikes the water then will be recirculated as it comes down out of this channel back into our recirculation pump and it comes back through again so we don't waste any water here in this system but you can see what we can produce using the bato system these cucumbers are absolutely enormous not only the the fruit itself and hopefully you can take a look at this one here that's not too far off but just the height of the plant alone so i'm 5 10 reaching up to the tips of my fingers and still i'm probably i guess two and a half three feet away from the top of this plant [Music] we've talked about growing in a controlled environment such as the tomato house here at crop king we can control the amount of water the amount of nutrients and the temperatures to a certain degree which is great by being indoors we can grow you know almost year round really extend our growing season but one question that comes up is well how do you pollinate your plants that's a great question now as a an educator i have a hydroponics farm in my school and unfortunately my superintendent won't let me have bees in the cafeteria where our garden is located why not well jim it's just a safety concern i do believe it's probably the best decision but here at crop king we solve this by these little natural pollinators right here they're bumble bees pretty uh pretty tame they fly around the greenhouse here they pretty much leave you alone but because i'm not allowed to have bees i still need a way to pollinate my plants indoors and that's where this little tool comes in this is called the veggie bee and hopefully this will pick up on our mic it basically vibrates and all i would do here is i would touch this to the flower of my plant and this will help pollinate it so essentially we're getting the uh by vibrating we're just disturbing the plant enough to jostle loose that pollen uh to get it on to the uh the plant that needs to pollinate and uh by golly we're gonna have fruit here before long prior to this i use an electric toothbrush because again this is the vibration that's going to jostle loose that pollen and get our fruit growing so this is important because if you're growing tomatoes and you do not self pollinate them you're just going to have some pretty little tomato flowers and no fruit so you got to go the extra step and pollinate those and you'll appreciate the fact whether you're indoors or outdoors this can increase your yield incredibly [Music] all right well thank you for joining me in the crop king tomato greenhouse to explore all the things you can grow hydroponically this is what's cool about hydroponics and this is why i love having it in my school you can try anything you don't have to you're not dependent on the growing season you can try just throwing seeds in and see what happens you'd be amazing the different things you can grow hydroponically and just how well it does regardless of the season i've done sunflowers i've done peppers cabbage i mean the list goes on and on and that's part of the fun is planting a seed and see what you can do with it hydroponically friends go out there explore hi jimmy do your thing hydroponically nothing's holding you back hope you enjoyed this [Music] you",
