  "text": "good morning chaps have you seen how beautiful it is along that Chesterfield Canal it's absolutely stunning today and the weather is perfect for Brick laying and laying concrete so we're going to tackle this section this morning I hope you can see that it's looking rather dark isn't it there we are how's that so I must have knocked a setting on the camera so what I will do in a moment is just pause the video and uh sort this camera out but yes we are going to start laying the concrete and the brick sections down here uh and in order to complete that then I've had to go and purchase a particular piece of equipment so yes we made the investment and we've picked up this little beauty so Chan is here just been helping me assemble it uh look at that \u00a319 from screw fix and well we'll have a better look at her in a sec there we go we got the white balance fixed so yeah we picked her up this morning uh she is 134 L concrete mixer it says on there I've always known them as a cement mixer we've just literally assembled it took me about 25 30 minutes and well that's a fired up she's whisper quiet whisper quiet so we're going to drag around the corner get some of this sand and I've got some ballast and whatever else on the back of the van just there some cement and we'll start the cementing process so we've got a first mix in on the new fraking machine seems to be working all right if I'm honest so uh this is basically just uh sand cement no in it I'm just going to put a very small Foundation down for the little wall the retaining wall for the uh the herb garden at the back there and then once that's done we'll mix ballast in with this maybe uh one part cement one part one and a half part sand and uh two parts ballast and that should give us a nice concrete for laying down as a pavement for the Dr roll got there in the end I've also got a bit of plasticizer somewhere so we'll pop a bit of that in as well oh God even plastic tubs come in plastic bags these days don't know what they're [Music] thinking oh [Music] yes there we go so we're a fair few hours into the day and we've basically got the wall built uh it's good enough for me it's going to be painted so I'm not too worried about the SM smudging of the cement on the edges uh so now for the last hour of the day we're just going to lift lift these slabs up here Dot and Dabber laying back down and then when we come in with concrete uh tomorrow or the day after we can just pour and fill in the gaps down the sides that's what we want to do get rid of all these weeds growing down there and we'll fill all that in with concrete and cement it's nearly home time buddy it's nearly freaking home time so it's going to be a slow day on the Vlog today because we've been busy just getting that job done we're anticipating deliveries tomorrow and uh we want to really make sure that those slabs were down and sort of gone off before the drayman walk over them with cask and keg full of beer I send a Shivam his spine so uh we've just plowed on with it and I didn't really get chance to pick the camera up more than a couple of times so I apologize for that uh but I'll show you what we've done so the mixer cleaned put away worked an absolute treat and then if we kind of just shoot through here we'll be able to have a look all the slabs that we've got laid down so these have been relay and reset they're solid now we're going to pour concrete down the sides and put some of these Quarry stones in there to TI all up and then that is the brick wall finished was a bit awkward on these Corners here and here but what we can do is lose a bit of that Rubble in the bottom level out that section there and then yeah we've got this great big wall so initially I was thinking growing hops up there and then I changed my mind and I wanted a big logo up there and then I looked at how expensive the logos are you know to kind of get like a street artist to come in or something and paint on there so I'm toying with the Hops idea again now cuz I think well there's a lot of space as you can see so at least if we put some hops in there they're going to be rigorous enough to actually cover the whole wall you know so we'll see if anyone's got any uh named hop rise hes any Cascade or shinook or east K Golding even would be nice um I'd appreciate a few rise homes uh I'd be willing to pay Postage and whatever else if people were selling them like FIV for half a dozen rise Helms something like that let me know uh and if I can get them cuz it's going to start to sprout very soon if not already if I can get them in the ground we might even get some Hops at the end of the the year so I'm just going to pop the camera back on the tripod and uh wrap it up for today don't go anywhere quite yet so yesterday I put a post on patreon telling everybody over there that we're going to do a tasting test for the New England IPA because I don't think it's turned out as it should I think it's overly bitter in fact I'm almost certain it's got overly bitter and uh today was going to be the day where we'd had it saged and vented and we're going to try it out of Cask we've been sidetracked a little bit with uh the concr in the new car the cement mixer all these things that we've done today which I know I didn't film much of it I I regret it but it's difficult because obviously we've got Jack the Lad under my wing now and kind of have to get him uh set up with jobs because he's only 18 and he's learning so I can't just say uh go and get those 15 casks mate Costick them and uh sanitize them and fill them up with beer out of that tank every step of the way I have to show him what to do so it's going to be obviously it's a it's an apprenticeship essentially it's training up of somebody who is uh who's a novice and because of that um my work days have become a little bit more hectic so I've not been able to concentrate as much on the Vlog don't worry it's obviously just going to be a little glitch you know a blip if you like so um Stuart also forgot to stillage the beer so it's not all on my back but he's gone and done it tonight so tomorrow when we get to work or when we finish I'll make sure I take the camera and to the seller and we'll give that New England IPA a whirl but I don't want to leave you guys without seeing me drink a beer because freaking know that's what it's all about isn't it so here I am with a northern monk New World IPA India paleale and the reason I've got this is actually because the best before date was the 4th of March so can't sell it in the pub I'm going to drink it at home woo 6 and 1/2% baby 6.2 Down the Hatch it's still good foring see you tomorrow [Music]",
