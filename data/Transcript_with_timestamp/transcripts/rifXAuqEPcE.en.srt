1
00:00:17,190 --> 00:00:24,310
so Rebecca and I we operate fair share

2
00:00:20,410 --> 00:00:26,369
farm this is the farm we're in Northeast

3
00:00:24,310 --> 00:00:28,540
Clay County Missouri North Kansas City

4
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:30,130
so that's our house

5
00:00:28,540 --> 00:00:32,980
we got a bar in our new fermenting

6
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:36,460
facility high tunnel two different

7
00:00:32,980 --> 00:00:38,830
fields that we operate one we tend to

8
00:00:36,460 --> 00:00:40,210
use more in the spring when it because

9
00:00:38,830 --> 00:00:43,180
it dries out quicker we have an

10
00:00:40,210 --> 00:00:46,470
irrigation pond here and a solar panel

11
00:00:43,180 --> 00:00:51,790
the irrigation system is solar-powered

12
00:00:46,470 --> 00:00:55,420
we started in 2003 and first CSA season

13
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:58,360
was 2004 this year we had 130 members

14
00:00:55,420 --> 00:01:02,650
our members work on the farm that's part

15
00:00:58,360 --> 00:01:06,340
of the CSA operation Rebecca is a fourth

16
00:01:02,650 --> 00:01:11,560
generation farmer we also have some hens

17
00:01:06,340 --> 00:01:13,390
at this point and so there's our CSA

18
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,940
like I said we're a participatory CSA

19
00:01:13,390 --> 00:01:18,909
that's kind of the traditional model our

20
00:01:15,940 --> 00:01:20,500
members are required to help 2 to 3

21
00:01:18,909 --> 00:01:23,649
times a year to come out with the

22
00:01:20,500 --> 00:01:26,820
harvest it's one of the things and our

23
00:01:23,649 --> 00:01:29,950
survey they say they actually like

24
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:32,409
almost the most about the farm we grow

25
00:01:29,950 --> 00:01:37,240
40 different types of vegetables like

26
00:01:32,409 --> 00:01:39,369
most CSA farms our approach

27
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:43,119
we're not certified organic and we

28
00:01:39,369 --> 00:01:45,429
consider ourselves a biological farm you

29
00:01:43,119 --> 00:01:47,109
know we tell people that do what we do

30
00:01:45,429 --> 00:01:52,030
so we think of the soil as the plant

31
00:01:47,109 --> 00:01:54,640
stomach you know you're gonna feed the

32
00:01:52,030 --> 00:01:57,729
soil you grow cover crop you turned it

33
00:01:54,640 --> 00:01:59,229
under the biology of the soil digests

34
00:01:57,729 --> 00:02:01,149
and decomposes that matter and that's

35
00:01:59,229 --> 00:02:02,979
what you feed the plant with just like

36
00:02:01,149 --> 00:02:06,130
yourself you get a piece of broccoli it

37
00:02:02,979 --> 00:02:10,119
goes into your body it gets digested by

38
00:02:06,130 --> 00:02:11,530
the by the probiotics in your body and

39
00:02:10,119 --> 00:02:13,540
we also like to say you are what you eat

40
00:02:11,530 --> 00:02:15,990
so you are what your plants eat and we

41
00:02:13,540 --> 00:02:18,730
feel all the cover cropping and

42
00:02:15,990 --> 00:02:20,520
biological methods that we've used over

43
00:02:18,730 --> 00:02:25,450
the years really helps improve the

44
00:02:20,520 --> 00:02:26,500
nutrition and the flavor of the crops we

45
00:02:25,450 --> 00:02:29,080
do what we feed the

46
00:02:26,500 --> 00:02:31,900
soyal a balanced meal we try every year

47
00:02:29,080 --> 00:02:35,830
to either give us cover crops compost or

48
00:02:31,900 --> 00:02:38,290
hay mulch straw organic fertilizer and

49
00:02:35,830 --> 00:02:43,390
we cover crop pretty much all year long

50
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:45,640
so we did a lot of mulching we buy

51
00:02:43,390 --> 00:02:47,580
composters organization called Missouri

52
00:02:45,640 --> 00:02:50,640
organics in Kansas City we can get

53
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:53,770
that's enough for about 20 beds of

54
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:59,440
20,000 foot beds about half acre we use

55
00:02:53,770 --> 00:03:02,230
a fur trail super n as a organic

56
00:02:59,440 --> 00:03:06,580
fertilizer that we can apply it's easy

57
00:03:02,230 --> 00:03:10,209
to put down we have a one we actually

58
00:03:06,580 --> 00:03:12,130
now have two moveable hen houses we like

59
00:03:10,209 --> 00:03:13,870
to move them into areas where we have

60
00:03:12,130 --> 00:03:16,180
cover crops growing and how to have them

61
00:03:13,870 --> 00:03:20,110
use that as a food source as well as

62
00:03:16,180 --> 00:03:20,890
their ration they say we grow a lot of

63
00:03:20,110 --> 00:03:24,959
cover crops

64
00:03:20,890 --> 00:03:30,489
this is protal area and suntanned

65
00:03:24,959 --> 00:03:33,160
circumstan and grass here buckwheat we

66
00:03:30,489 --> 00:03:35,590
have a electric tractor so it's an

67
00:03:33,160 --> 00:03:40,180
allis-chalmers ji there's a sare grant

68
00:03:35,590 --> 00:03:43,600
from a while back that from a farmer in

69
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:46,600
New York State Ron Klose he converted it

70
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:48,430
to from gas to electric you can see the

71
00:03:46,600 --> 00:03:51,850
batteries on the back there it

72
00:03:48,430 --> 00:03:55,090
essentially runs like a golf cart

73
00:03:51,850 --> 00:03:58,840
this was our field day that we had this

74
00:03:55,090 --> 00:04:01,030
year so another thing they said we've

75
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:06,220
been farming 13 years using biological

76
00:04:01,030 --> 00:04:11,799
practices last year I decided to compile

77
00:04:06,220 --> 00:04:14,950
all of our soil data so back in 2003 we

78
00:04:11,799 --> 00:04:16,959
actually got a grant from the state of

79
00:04:14,950 --> 00:04:19,989
Missouri a sustainable AG demonstration

80
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:23,260
award Joan familiar with that she signed

81
00:04:19,989 --> 00:04:26,620
off on that and we were able to get

82
00:04:23,260 --> 00:04:31,450
money for soil testing we got a manure

83
00:04:26,620 --> 00:04:32,830
spreader and money to buy cover crop

84
00:04:31,450 --> 00:04:37,630
seeds and so that kind of got us

85
00:04:32,830 --> 00:04:40,060
starting started and just want to kind

86
00:04:37,630 --> 00:04:42,520
of point out here you know the

87
00:04:40,060 --> 00:04:45,010
whole point of organic or biological

88
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:46,360
farming is to improve soil quality if

89
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:50,740
you do that then the plants are gonna

90
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:52,620
grow so we have this first sample

91
00:04:50,740 --> 00:04:56,200
there's only one I don't think it it's

92
00:04:52,620 --> 00:04:58,690
really as a baseline as much assists

93
00:04:56,200 --> 00:05:04,180
arted out with about 2.6 percent organic

94
00:04:58,690 --> 00:05:06,250
matter on our farm and for a while every

95
00:05:04,180 --> 00:05:09,220
year and then we skipped and we we just

96
00:05:06,250 --> 00:05:11,920
kept taking soil samples and you can see

97
00:05:09,220 --> 00:05:15,090
as time went on here we went from our

98
00:05:11,920 --> 00:05:18,670
ranges being less than three in the twos

99
00:05:15,090 --> 00:05:23,710
to where we get down here towards 2013

100
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:25,960
15 our ranges have gone up so you can

101
00:05:23,710 --> 00:05:29,350
see we've basically raised our soil

102
00:05:25,960 --> 00:05:30,940
organic matter by almost one and a half

103
00:05:29,350 --> 00:05:34,090
percent and that's one thing that we're

104
00:05:30,940 --> 00:05:37,360
really proud of and we like to show this

105
00:05:34,090 --> 00:05:39,760
this is it a graph that this is what

106
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:42,370
organic farming can do I don't think

107
00:05:39,760 --> 00:05:46,150
it's talked about enough if you look at

108
00:05:42,370 --> 00:05:48,640
from like 2008 until now with the

109
00:05:46,150 --> 00:05:50,980
acreage that we've grown calculated that

110
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:53,950
we've added about 250,000 pounds of

111
00:05:50,980 --> 00:05:56,350
organic matter to our soil which relates

112
00:05:53,950 --> 00:05:59,950
to about 350,000 pounds of carbon

113
00:05:56,350 --> 00:06:02,380
dioxide that we've sequestered so that's

114
00:05:59,950 --> 00:06:04,720
something that is in agriculture you can

115
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:06,760
do just kind of a matter of course we

116
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:08,350
think that's important you can see that

117
00:06:06,760 --> 00:06:12,190
it kind of bounced around and went down

118
00:06:08,350 --> 00:06:13,690
and then up for a while we were took

119
00:06:12,190 --> 00:06:15,250
awhile a lot of years for us to really

120
00:06:13,690 --> 00:06:19,990
get our cover cropping going but once we

121
00:06:15,250 --> 00:06:21,730
did you can see the improvements so they

122
00:06:19,990 --> 00:06:23,530
said the the biology the soil is

123
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:25,600
important and we've always kind of

124
00:06:23,530 --> 00:06:27,160
wanted to do value-added but didn't

125
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:31,150
really want to slave over a stove and

126
00:06:27,160 --> 00:06:33,270
make tomato sauce for people and what

127
00:06:31,150 --> 00:06:39,880
we've decided to do is to do fermenting

128
00:06:33,270 --> 00:06:41,920
so we like how that kind of ties the

129
00:06:39,880 --> 00:06:44,800
biology of the soil to the biology to

130
00:06:41,920 --> 00:06:46,420
the food to the biology of your of our

131
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,930
digestive systems because they're all

132
00:06:46,420 --> 00:06:51,610
really the same thing

133
00:06:48,930 --> 00:06:54,160
so sauerkraut obviously one fermented

134
00:06:51,610 --> 00:06:56,500
food most people are familiar with

135
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:58,990
there's a Rebecca it's a little blurry

136
00:06:56,500 --> 00:07:04,479
fill them some jars with kimchi in our

137
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:05,949
new kitchen and there's a facility built

138
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:10,030
on like a hundred-year-old

139
00:07:05,949 --> 00:07:11,710
tobacco barn and there was a couple of

140
00:07:10,030 --> 00:07:16,660
our products so that was part of the

141
00:07:11,710 --> 00:07:19,449
genesis for this project we do grow some

142
00:07:16,660 --> 00:07:21,669
things that are more fruiting vegetables

143
00:07:19,449 --> 00:07:24,880
like cucumbers to make pickles and

144
00:07:21,669 --> 00:07:26,530
jalapenos to make pickled jalapenos but

145
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:29,889
the idea was going to grow a lot of

146
00:07:26,530 --> 00:07:31,449
cabbage so we want to do it the simplest

147
00:07:29,889 --> 00:07:34,419
way possible the least amount of labor

148
00:07:31,449 --> 00:07:36,610
and so the Rolly roller crimper

149
00:07:34,419 --> 00:07:41,740
and planting into roll-down beds is

150
00:07:36,610 --> 00:07:46,570
something that we wanted to work on so

151
00:07:41,740 --> 00:07:50,680
it's been quite a long project

152
00:07:46,570 --> 00:07:52,780
so you see here 2013 first step was to

153
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:56,320
plan triage in the winter or in the fall

154
00:07:52,780 --> 00:08:01,150
so that the following spring we'd have a

155
00:07:56,320 --> 00:08:06,479
crop to roll down the idea was that we

156
00:08:01,150 --> 00:08:10,060
would sew crimp these down we also

157
00:08:06,479 --> 00:08:13,479
trialing tomatoes in the roll down cover

158
00:08:10,060 --> 00:08:17,410
crops and then in July late July plant

159
00:08:13,479 --> 00:08:19,690
the fall brassicas into into that and

160
00:08:17,410 --> 00:08:23,229
then in September seed the rive at for

161
00:08:19,690 --> 00:08:29,050
the next year so we'll go through all

162
00:08:23,229 --> 00:08:32,349
that so 2014 no-till Brassica you can

163
00:08:29,050 --> 00:08:35,650
see here this is a flail mower that we

164
00:08:32,349 --> 00:08:37,599
had and part of the project also was to

165
00:08:35,650 --> 00:08:39,580
get us a better flail mower

166
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:43,839
that one's a little lightweight there

167
00:08:39,580 --> 00:08:47,380
weren't a lot of safety guards on it but

168
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:49,300
one thing it did show is that in talking

169
00:08:47,380 --> 00:08:52,480
to Ron Morris also who's our technical

170
00:08:49,300 --> 00:08:55,180
adviser dr. Morris is from Virginia Tech

171
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:57,279
so you don't need to buy a roller

172
00:08:55,180 --> 00:08:59,980
crimper we had that in there originally

173
00:08:57,279 --> 00:09:02,350
and then we took it out to roll down to

174
00:08:59,980 --> 00:09:04,360
cover crop the the flail mowers have a

175
00:09:02,350 --> 00:09:06,640
very very large roller on the backhoe

176
00:09:04,360 --> 00:09:07,160
very very heavy so all you really need

177
00:09:06,640 --> 00:09:09,829
to do

178
00:09:07,160 --> 00:09:12,860
to drag the flail mower through a bed

179
00:09:09,829 --> 00:09:16,220
with out the mower going to roll down

180
00:09:12,860 --> 00:09:20,000
the crops and this is what it looks like

181
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:23,930
so 2014 I'll start it out really well we

182
00:09:20,000 --> 00:09:25,550
had a really nice rich crop we rolled it

183
00:09:23,930 --> 00:09:27,529
down a looked like this looked really

184
00:09:25,550 --> 00:09:29,959
good

185
00:09:27,529 --> 00:09:32,540
the vetch came back up which isn't

186
00:09:29,959 --> 00:09:34,310
unusual it's more veiny it doesn't

187
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:39,889
really have the stem like rye does it'll

188
00:09:34,310 --> 00:09:42,019
just break we mowed that off at the same

189
00:09:39,889 --> 00:09:46,129
time we were doing a trial so we we did

190
00:09:42,019 --> 00:09:48,680
the roll down beds and then we used our

191
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:52,029
Spader and we tilled in beds and the

192
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:56,509
idea was to compare roll down production

193
00:09:52,029 --> 00:09:59,930
versus tilled production mode off the

194
00:09:56,509 --> 00:10:04,699
right edge but then as you can see

195
00:09:59,930 --> 00:10:06,949
behind our farm crew here the bindweed

196
00:10:04,699 --> 00:10:09,319
started coming in we had other areas

197
00:10:06,949 --> 00:10:12,139
where the grasses started coming in so

198
00:10:09,319 --> 00:10:16,699
you know we're trying Cynthia got out

199
00:10:12,139 --> 00:10:17,959
here I think was maybe 75 foot I don't

200
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:19,220
know if it was even that far and it's

201
00:10:17,959 --> 00:10:22,269
like okay let's just see how long it's

202
00:10:19,220 --> 00:10:25,459
gonna take so it took like five hours of

203
00:10:22,269 --> 00:10:29,810
personnel time to hand weed this area

204
00:10:25,459 --> 00:10:32,899
and then it just came back anyway so we

205
00:10:29,810 --> 00:10:36,040
tried another thing we had this organic

206
00:10:32,899 --> 00:10:39,699
herbicide called Ground Force which is

207
00:10:36,040 --> 00:10:43,189
it's just like a citric or acetic acid

208
00:10:39,699 --> 00:10:46,670
and so we tried spraying that and then

209
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:48,230
we sprayed the whole thing and didn't

210
00:10:46,670 --> 00:10:50,899
matter it just all came back it's not a

211
00:10:48,230 --> 00:10:53,779
systemic herbicide it just kind of tilts

212
00:10:50,899 --> 00:10:56,300
kills the top growth so the main focus

213
00:10:53,779 --> 00:10:57,829
of this whole project the first year we

214
00:10:56,300 --> 00:11:00,800
just had to abandon the thought of even

215
00:10:57,829 --> 00:11:02,959
planting into this we did I'll show you

216
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:08,029
with the no-till planting that we did

217
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:12,139
try to run the machinery but we didn't

218
00:11:08,029 --> 00:11:14,779
plant into it so no-till planting aid

219
00:11:12,139 --> 00:11:19,759
it's basically a furrow er and as a

220
00:11:14,779 --> 00:11:21,080
system that dr. Moore's developed and so

221
00:11:19,759 --> 00:11:22,970
he helped us in building the

222
00:11:21,080 --> 00:11:25,400
till planting AIDS so it's a way that

223
00:11:22,970 --> 00:11:27,170
just pull furrows in the rolled down

224
00:11:25,400 --> 00:11:32,320
cover crop and then you can plant into

225
00:11:27,170 --> 00:11:35,180
that area so you can just look he has a

226
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:36,980
lot of literature on this you know you

227
00:11:35,180 --> 00:11:38,270
can go online you can buy a toolbar you

228
00:11:36,980 --> 00:11:40,190
can buy this and that and you just kind

229
00:11:38,270 --> 00:11:41,930
of build it but we have this equipment

230
00:11:40,190 --> 00:11:43,940
laying around the farm so it was like

231
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:47,630
well we're gonna kind of farm hack the

232
00:11:43,940 --> 00:11:50,420
whole thing so we had this tool bar

233
00:11:47,630 --> 00:11:52,760
which looks like it's a square of tool

234
00:11:50,420 --> 00:11:54,590
bar and after I bought the clamps found

235
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:57,320
out it's actually a diamond tool bar and

236
00:11:54,590 --> 00:11:59,120
then the shanks you know ones longer

237
00:11:57,320 --> 00:12:00,800
than the other you saying these

238
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:05,360
Coulter's they were really too small to

239
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:07,010
use so I kind of roughed it up so these

240
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,930
are one of the things we bought were

241
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:13,130
these Coulter's you really need them to

242
00:12:08,930 --> 00:12:14,750
be big if you have a lot of roll down

243
00:12:13,130 --> 00:12:18,590
cover crop it has to be able to cut

244
00:12:14,750 --> 00:12:23,780
through it this shank wasn't gonna there

245
00:12:18,590 --> 00:12:26,330
just wasn't enough space there so we

246
00:12:23,780 --> 00:12:30,530
really we had to get a piece of steel

247
00:12:26,330 --> 00:12:32,420
and drop this straight down and then it

248
00:12:30,530 --> 00:12:36,470
turned out that they're still kind of

249
00:12:32,420 --> 00:12:39,380
too close we had a bolt and extension

250
00:12:36,470 --> 00:12:43,610
onto that you can kind of see where this

251
00:12:39,380 --> 00:12:45,920
is a square on a diamond and then you

252
00:12:43,610 --> 00:12:49,310
got this little bit here and we had we

253
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:52,670
didn't cut that off the first year so it

254
00:12:49,310 --> 00:12:54,500
worked it worked well just like he said

255
00:12:52,670 --> 00:12:55,820
it would it dragged through you just had

256
00:12:54,500 --> 00:12:58,160
a furrow going there we have a

257
00:12:55,820 --> 00:13:00,770
waterwheel transplanter the idea was

258
00:12:58,160 --> 00:13:02,120
weed spaced the waterwheels at that

259
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:04,970
distance and pull it through and be able

260
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:07,880
to plant but showing you those pictures

261
00:13:04,970 --> 00:13:15,470
before you can see that already all this

262
00:13:07,880 --> 00:13:17,960
vine weed had grown back in so last year

263
00:13:15,470 --> 00:13:20,180
we couldn't do it I'll go into that this

264
00:13:17,960 --> 00:13:22,760
year I kind of fixed it up a little bit

265
00:13:20,180 --> 00:13:24,380
you can see here I cut that off that was

266
00:13:22,760 --> 00:13:27,200
really catching on the cover crop and

267
00:13:24,380 --> 00:13:29,540
and causing a problem and you can see

268
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:31,430
here the steel that's the extension we

269
00:13:29,540 --> 00:13:33,949
spent money and bought a diamond clamp

270
00:13:31,430 --> 00:13:37,910
so

271
00:13:33,949 --> 00:13:40,309
it worked worked really well pulls right

272
00:13:37,910 --> 00:13:41,989
through there you can kind of see it it

273
00:13:40,309 --> 00:13:47,049
cuts down maybe eight inches into the

274
00:13:41,989 --> 00:13:51,220
soil and so the no-till planting aid

275
00:13:47,049 --> 00:13:54,199
worked fine our you know conclusions are

276
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:56,179
you can farm hack it and maybe save a

277
00:13:54,199 --> 00:13:57,799
little bit of money or it's not that

278
00:13:56,179 --> 00:14:00,199
hard to find the parts you need for a

279
00:13:57,799 --> 00:14:03,470
toolbar and everything else to to make

280
00:14:00,199 --> 00:14:06,919
it with new parts it's a great tool it

281
00:14:03,470 --> 00:14:10,489
does what it says and we still may use

282
00:14:06,919 --> 00:14:12,679
it there may be times when it's really

283
00:14:10,489 --> 00:14:16,129
wet out and we don't want to till an

284
00:14:12,679 --> 00:14:19,339
area and we can use this to create a

285
00:14:16,129 --> 00:14:22,999
planting furrow without causing a lot of

286
00:14:19,339 --> 00:14:24,769
problems so there's a Rebecca this is

287
00:14:22,999 --> 00:14:27,669
one of our other field days we had a

288
00:14:24,769 --> 00:14:33,139
field day each year

289
00:14:27,669 --> 00:14:36,499
that same year 2014 we did the same

290
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:39,079
thing for tomatoes so the idea with the

291
00:14:36,499 --> 00:14:41,179
tomatoes we only in the summer we do a

292
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,279
second planting two tomatoes in there we

293
00:14:41,179 --> 00:14:48,739
call them our summer Tomatoes we use a

294
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:50,540
hybrid we'll cage them and so we took

295
00:14:48,739 --> 00:14:53,059
this 200 foot bed that's our standard

296
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:54,799
bed length and rolled down a hundred

297
00:14:53,059 --> 00:14:58,699
foot of it and then the other hundred

298
00:14:54,799 --> 00:15:04,910
feet we spayed it in and planted into

299
00:14:58,699 --> 00:15:07,480
that to mulch here's the tomatoes that

300
00:15:04,910 --> 00:15:10,939
we hand planted in here

301
00:15:07,480 --> 00:15:13,489
unfortunately we I'm still searching for

302
00:15:10,939 --> 00:15:15,439
the data from this one but it was really

303
00:15:13,489 --> 00:15:16,910
wet I mean when we dug the holes and put

304
00:15:15,439 --> 00:15:19,519
these tomato plants in there was water

305
00:15:16,910 --> 00:15:21,049
at the bottom it was it was a really wet

306
00:15:19,519 --> 00:15:22,399
year so I don't know that the data from

307
00:15:21,049 --> 00:15:24,439
this necessarily would have been that

308
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:27,319
good and we did the same test this year

309
00:15:24,439 --> 00:15:30,379
and I have much better information from

310
00:15:27,319 --> 00:15:32,689
that but you can kind of see it we did

311
00:15:30,379 --> 00:15:34,519
hand weed this once and for the tomatoes

312
00:15:32,689 --> 00:15:38,269
that didn't work out too bad the thing

313
00:15:34,519 --> 00:15:42,709
with the tomatoes are you you roll it

314
00:15:38,269 --> 00:15:46,279
down most of this happens in late May

315
00:15:42,709 --> 00:15:47,850
that's when the Rye has reached the

316
00:15:46,279 --> 00:15:50,550
stage where you gonna

317
00:15:47,850 --> 00:15:53,670
down and the tomatoes are summer

318
00:15:50,550 --> 00:15:56,069
Tomatoes will plant maybe second week of

319
00:15:53,670 --> 00:15:57,870
June so it will have died back and we

320
00:15:56,069 --> 00:16:00,720
can plant right into it whereas with the

321
00:15:57,870 --> 00:16:02,610
Brassica as you roll it down you know

322
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:04,470
before May is over and then you're not

323
00:16:02,610 --> 00:16:06,089
going to plant until the middle of July

324
00:16:04,470 --> 00:16:08,310
your cabbage or something and it just

325
00:16:06,089 --> 00:16:12,600
sitting there all this time and weeds

326
00:16:08,310 --> 00:16:14,310
have more of a chance to grow just

327
00:16:12,600 --> 00:16:16,470
wanted to go through this real quick

328
00:16:14,310 --> 00:16:19,800
just to kind of show you we've done a

329
00:16:16,470 --> 00:16:22,889
lot of a lot of cover cropping this is

330
00:16:19,800 --> 00:16:24,690
an example we do cover crops in the

331
00:16:22,889 --> 00:16:28,940
spring summer and fall

332
00:16:24,690 --> 00:16:28,940
there's like a summer cover crop of

333
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:41,839
looks like mung bean or beans and and

334
00:16:36,029 --> 00:16:47,459
sorghum Sudan grass so we'll let it grow

335
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:48,779
will flail mow it down that's what it

336
00:16:47,459 --> 00:16:51,779
looks like when it flailed Mose is all

337
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:53,819
nice and chopped and then this is our

338
00:16:51,779 --> 00:16:56,310
Spader I know if you guys ever seen a

339
00:16:53,819 --> 00:16:57,689
Spader it's one of the first pieces of

340
00:16:56,310 --> 00:17:01,399
equipment that we got they had one at

341
00:16:57,689 --> 00:17:03,360
the farm in New York where we were it

342
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:06,179
it's a really nice piece of equipment

343
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,829
you can see these shovels in here so

344
00:17:06,179 --> 00:17:10,500
there's like a half dozen shovels and

345
00:17:07,829 --> 00:17:11,880
they actually dig the soil you can

346
00:17:10,500 --> 00:17:14,549
actually go through bed say you had

347
00:17:11,880 --> 00:17:17,069
potatoes in and you harvested them all

348
00:17:14,549 --> 00:17:18,929
and go through and Spade and you can

349
00:17:17,069 --> 00:17:20,400
find potatoes that are you know haven't

350
00:17:18,929 --> 00:17:23,339
even been damaged when you're all done

351
00:17:20,400 --> 00:17:27,860
spading so it's a it's not as

352
00:17:23,339 --> 00:17:30,450
pulverizing as a garden type tiller

353
00:17:27,860 --> 00:17:35,450
that's what it looks like on a good day

354
00:17:30,450 --> 00:17:38,549
we have a silk clay soil so it's really

355
00:17:35,450 --> 00:17:43,039
difficult to always find the exact

356
00:17:38,549 --> 00:17:44,940
perfect soil moisture to to Spade but

357
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:46,710
that looks nice like that

358
00:17:44,940 --> 00:17:51,090
you know we consider cover cropping kind

359
00:17:46,710 --> 00:17:52,470
of composting in place we also have in

360
00:17:51,090 --> 00:17:54,659
the past have taken the plastic off our

361
00:17:52,470 --> 00:17:59,610
high tunnel and cover crop tower high

362
00:17:54,659 --> 00:18:00,570
tunnel so 2015 was going to be our

363
00:17:59,610 --> 00:18:01,680
second year's gonna be a two-year

364
00:18:00,570 --> 00:18:05,370
project

365
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:08,580
but we suspended the project because of

366
00:18:05,370 --> 00:18:10,740
rain so I don't know if you can read all

367
00:18:08,580 --> 00:18:14,910
this data but you can see down here at

368
00:18:10,740 --> 00:18:16,140
the bottom it was I don't this first

369
00:18:14,910 --> 00:18:18,270
year I ever decided to keep like

370
00:18:16,140 --> 00:18:20,790
rainfall records and just had a little

371
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:22,050
log and I kept in the notes and it was

372
00:18:20,790 --> 00:18:26,640
really interesting to have done it this

373
00:18:22,050 --> 00:18:30,240
year over the course of 74 days we had

374
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:32,340
almost 36 inches of rain with your

375
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:38,520
crates to almost a half an inch of rain

376
00:18:32,340 --> 00:18:39,900
every day for 74 days right in here this

377
00:18:38,520 --> 00:18:44,850
is about the time that you would

378
00:18:39,900 --> 00:18:48,690
normally be rolling and crimping and up

379
00:18:44,850 --> 00:18:51,960
till the end of May we had 10 inches and

380
00:18:48,690 --> 00:18:55,560
then the first week of June we had 10

381
00:18:51,960 --> 00:18:58,530
inches just in in those couple days we

382
00:18:55,560 --> 00:19:01,320
also had hail so this you can kind of

383
00:18:58,530 --> 00:19:03,840
see this is a total precipitation for

384
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:05,660
that day and we're right in the middle

385
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,190
of the worst of it

386
00:19:05,660 --> 00:19:12,870
so this is what strawberries look like

387
00:19:08,190 --> 00:19:14,370
after they've been pummeled by hail like

388
00:19:12,870 --> 00:19:18,180
Rebecca said it looks like little tiny

389
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:19,530
fairy punches on them and and when you

390
00:19:18,180 --> 00:19:21,720
count on your strawberries and they're

391
00:19:19,530 --> 00:19:24,780
just ripening and you get hail it's no

392
00:19:21,720 --> 00:19:29,370
fun and so we're trying to keep the

393
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:31,890
project going too but like you could see

394
00:19:29,370 --> 00:19:33,420
there was really no time period when

395
00:19:31,890 --> 00:19:36,600
this was ready to be rolled down that we

396
00:19:33,420 --> 00:19:38,940
could get in there and I was doing

397
00:19:36,600 --> 00:19:41,060
everything I could work on this project

398
00:19:38,940 --> 00:19:43,950
and keep the rest of the farm going and

399
00:19:41,060 --> 00:19:45,900
there are a few times when I probably

400
00:19:43,950 --> 00:19:49,350
went out went out there when I shouldn't

401
00:19:45,900 --> 00:19:53,760
have so that was a lesson all in and of

402
00:19:49,350 --> 00:20:02,420
itself this is more of the rain that we

403
00:19:53,760 --> 00:20:04,230
had so we skipped 2015 and got into 2016

404
00:20:02,420 --> 00:20:06,210
so one of the other parts of this

405
00:20:04,230 --> 00:20:10,910
project was to evaluate our cover

406
00:20:06,210 --> 00:20:15,539
cropping method we had always just done

407
00:20:10,910 --> 00:20:17,279
broadcast seeding and harrowing

408
00:20:15,539 --> 00:20:20,820
that's how we would do our cover

409
00:20:17,279 --> 00:20:22,649
cropping and you've seen some of those

410
00:20:20,820 --> 00:20:26,700
pictures things worked out fine but it's

411
00:20:22,649 --> 00:20:30,239
pretty labor-intensive so the idea was

412
00:20:26,700 --> 00:20:32,340
to get a cedar and I spent almost two

413
00:20:30,239 --> 00:20:36,179
years looking for a used grain drill

414
00:20:32,340 --> 00:20:38,220
like six foot wide and I had absolutely

415
00:20:36,179 --> 00:20:42,350
no luck finding one

416
00:20:38,220 --> 00:20:43,679
so eventually decided to go to getting a

417
00:20:42,350 --> 00:20:46,080
vegetable cedar

418
00:20:43,679 --> 00:20:48,899
so our allis-chalmers G we have a tool

419
00:20:46,080 --> 00:20:53,099
bar and we have three planet junior

420
00:20:48,899 --> 00:20:54,690
cedars and we concede with that just off

421
00:20:53,099 --> 00:20:58,619
the electric tractor so the thought was

422
00:20:54,690 --> 00:21:02,399
if I can get four new planet juniors I

423
00:20:58,619 --> 00:21:04,379
could put that on the allis-chalmers and

424
00:21:02,399 --> 00:21:08,549
we could use our electric tractor to do

425
00:21:04,379 --> 00:21:10,830
our cover cropping but turns out once

426
00:21:08,549 --> 00:21:13,169
the cedars came that these are newer

427
00:21:10,830 --> 00:21:16,889
ones and they're like twice the weight

428
00:21:13,169 --> 00:21:19,049
of the other ones so that didn't really

429
00:21:16,889 --> 00:21:20,720
work out so we had to get a tool bar so

430
00:21:19,049 --> 00:21:25,289
that we could just pull it behind our

431
00:21:20,720 --> 00:21:27,119
our farm all so these are vegetable

432
00:21:25,289 --> 00:21:28,889
cedars and we're trying to see cover

433
00:21:27,119 --> 00:21:32,609
crops but you know for the most part

434
00:21:28,889 --> 00:21:35,759
seeds or seeds so we've started looking

435
00:21:32,609 --> 00:21:38,549
at well you know what's the seed plate

436
00:21:35,759 --> 00:21:41,549
for a rye or vetch or whatever and so

437
00:21:38,549 --> 00:21:43,460
one way to do it was simply to measure

438
00:21:41,549 --> 00:21:46,519
the circumference of the front wheel

439
00:21:43,460 --> 00:21:49,470
which would be the ground tracking on it

440
00:21:46,519 --> 00:21:51,299
open up the cedar and just spin the

441
00:21:49,470 --> 00:21:52,979
wheel for so many feet and count how

442
00:21:51,299 --> 00:21:54,629
many pounds fell out and then we could

443
00:21:52,979 --> 00:21:57,179
calculate okay well this wheel will get

444
00:21:54,629 --> 00:22:00,470
you so many pounds per acre or per bed

445
00:21:57,179 --> 00:22:04,049
whatever we wanted so I did that and

446
00:22:00,470 --> 00:22:06,599
every like this hopper it looks like

447
00:22:04,049 --> 00:22:10,259
these both had like vets in them and

448
00:22:06,599 --> 00:22:12,779
those two might have had rye these were

449
00:22:10,259 --> 00:22:14,220
offset so we wanted eight rows so I had

450
00:22:12,779 --> 00:22:16,499
to kind of turn around and go back down

451
00:22:14,220 --> 00:22:20,429
the other way and try and have the cedar

452
00:22:16,499 --> 00:22:22,799
go in between the other rows so that

453
00:22:20,429 --> 00:22:25,049
didn't work out all that great it worked

454
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:27,929
out okay and then the other thing was

455
00:22:25,049 --> 00:22:29,490
having two different seeds and two

456
00:22:27,929 --> 00:22:31,770
different seed holes and trying to keep

457
00:22:29,490 --> 00:22:36,120
all that perfect really was kind of a

458
00:22:31,770 --> 00:22:38,370
pain so when I went to just mixing the

459
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:41,670
seed and you just use the largest seed

460
00:22:38,370 --> 00:22:44,160
hole and you calibrate it that way so

461
00:22:41,670 --> 00:22:47,220
you mix the Ryan batch or the oats and

462
00:22:44,160 --> 00:22:49,230
peas or the Sudan grass and crota larrya

463
00:22:47,220 --> 00:22:52,590
together whatever it is you need and you

464
00:22:49,230 --> 00:22:56,580
find the seed where you get we're trying

465
00:22:52,590 --> 00:23:00,960
to get about about two pounds or so per

466
00:22:56,580 --> 00:23:05,429
thousand foot bed so that you can see

467
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:11,700
here OOP we got one two three four five

468
00:23:05,429 --> 00:23:13,410
like six rows here this is a bed so you

469
00:23:11,700 --> 00:23:15,240
really want like eight so it wasn't too

470
00:23:13,410 --> 00:23:18,720
bad

471
00:23:15,240 --> 00:23:21,570
grew pretty well the the peas were

472
00:23:18,720 --> 00:23:24,510
supposed to be separate inside there and

473
00:23:21,570 --> 00:23:27,120
some of those work some didn't so for

474
00:23:24,510 --> 00:23:28,950
the next time I did it I tried putting

475
00:23:27,120 --> 00:23:31,320
it all to one side figuring at least I'd

476
00:23:28,950 --> 00:23:38,510
make sure everything was on one side or

477
00:23:31,320 --> 00:23:38,510
on each side this was this summer and

478
00:23:38,990 --> 00:23:43,110
some of that didn't turn out that well

479
00:23:40,980 --> 00:23:45,059
because it got very dry for a while and

480
00:23:43,110 --> 00:23:48,090
the seeds just sat there and so the

481
00:23:45,059 --> 00:23:50,900
wheats started to take over but this is

482
00:23:48,090 --> 00:23:54,420
part of the trial where this area here

483
00:23:50,900 --> 00:23:58,710
was broadcast and Harrow it in and these

484
00:23:54,420 --> 00:24:02,340
were with the cedar and it pretty much

485
00:23:58,710 --> 00:24:04,710
looked like that we'd cut areas and way

486
00:24:02,340 --> 00:24:06,240
um and so we did this two different

487
00:24:04,710 --> 00:24:09,390
times and so you can see from the top

488
00:24:06,240 --> 00:24:11,970
one the first time we did it and a

489
00:24:09,390 --> 00:24:16,290
spring crop the cedar had a little bit

490
00:24:11,970 --> 00:24:17,670
better weight and then when we measured

491
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:20,940
in the fall from one of the summer

492
00:24:17,670 --> 00:24:23,220
plantings the broadcast had a better

493
00:24:20,940 --> 00:24:26,330
weight we took like a four by four area

494
00:24:23,220 --> 00:24:26,330
just cut it down and weight it

495
00:24:26,510 --> 00:24:35,160
we kept using it it does the cedar it

496
00:24:32,850 --> 00:24:37,790
does give you a pretty good stand that

497
00:24:35,160 --> 00:24:41,880
doesn't always look like it at the start

498
00:24:37,790 --> 00:24:44,580
these are peas and oats

499
00:24:41,880 --> 00:24:47,850
and this just interesting is so warm

500
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:50,190
this year this is actually a sunhemp

501
00:24:47,850 --> 00:24:52,470
flower which we'd never seen before

502
00:24:50,190 --> 00:24:57,179
because it's just been growing all year

503
00:24:52,470 --> 00:24:58,740
all winter long or fall along so we feel

504
00:24:57,179 --> 00:25:03,210
vegetable cedar can be used to seed

505
00:24:58,740 --> 00:25:05,910
cover crops it's a multi-use cedar then

506
00:25:03,210 --> 00:25:08,640
if you have more than one use for it if

507
00:25:05,910 --> 00:25:10,590
your vegetable farmer we would advise

508
00:25:08,640 --> 00:25:12,179
combining two C types into the and use

509
00:25:10,590 --> 00:25:15,270
the larger cedar hole the one for the

510
00:25:12,179 --> 00:25:17,690
larger seed and then you can just have

511
00:25:15,270 --> 00:25:20,460
all your cedars at the same cedar hole

512
00:25:17,690 --> 00:25:24,530
we had a little difficult to get like

513
00:25:20,460 --> 00:25:27,140
eight perfectly spaced rows and

514
00:25:24,530 --> 00:25:29,429
harrowing can be just as effective as

515
00:25:27,140 --> 00:25:34,409
the cedar it just takes a lot more

516
00:25:29,429 --> 00:25:36,000
effort so this is our second try at the

517
00:25:34,409 --> 00:25:40,530
no-till Brassica that was this this is

518
00:25:36,000 --> 00:25:42,360
this year so last September we put down

519
00:25:40,530 --> 00:25:45,419
rive at that was a really really wet

520
00:25:42,360 --> 00:25:47,549
year and for some reason you can see

521
00:25:45,419 --> 00:25:49,650
there's hardly any rye that came up but

522
00:25:47,549 --> 00:25:52,140
we had a lot of edge so that's what it

523
00:25:49,650 --> 00:25:59,370
looked like in May we rolled down the

524
00:25:52,140 --> 00:26:00,780
veg we that's a picture of the new flail

525
00:25:59,370 --> 00:26:04,700
mower you can kind of see that roller

526
00:26:00,780 --> 00:26:07,860
there that just helps roll stuff down

527
00:26:04,700 --> 00:26:13,710
and this is one of the trial beds and

528
00:26:07,860 --> 00:26:15,780
pretty much the same thing happened you

529
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:18,059
know the where we are I mean I'll out

530
00:26:15,780 --> 00:26:20,880
here it's a lot of grassland and like

531
00:26:18,059 --> 00:26:22,799
between the end of May and then you have

532
00:26:20,880 --> 00:26:24,630
all of June and going into July that's

533
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:26,940
when grasses really really want to grow

534
00:26:24,630 --> 00:26:28,440
this area we'd never put down hay or

535
00:26:26,940 --> 00:26:31,830
anything it was a relatively new area

536
00:26:28,440 --> 00:26:34,350
that we were like the second year we

537
00:26:31,830 --> 00:26:36,360
used it but when you have to wait around

538
00:26:34,350 --> 00:26:38,970
that long before you plant at least for

539
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:47,549
us you just get too much weed pressure

540
00:26:38,970 --> 00:26:49,280
especially from the grasses so it's easy

541
00:26:47,549 --> 00:26:51,330
to roll down with the flail mower

542
00:26:49,280 --> 00:26:54,480
there's a problem because of the weed

543
00:26:51,330 --> 00:26:55,620
pressure from the grasses in the heat of

544
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:58,050
the summer

545
00:26:55,620 --> 00:26:59,490
you saw the wet periods we had it's

546
00:26:58,050 --> 00:27:01,200
really hard to implement the roller

547
00:26:59,490 --> 00:27:05,610
crimper and planting in it during the

548
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:07,260
wet periods and we tried doing like hand

549
00:27:05,610 --> 00:27:09,059
weeding and everything and that really

550
00:27:07,260 --> 00:27:11,370
is not an effective way to kind of make

551
00:27:09,059 --> 00:27:15,210
up for any any problems that you might

552
00:27:11,370 --> 00:27:18,150
have this is more rain so this year at

553
00:27:15,210 --> 00:27:20,940
the end of August we had 10 inches over

554
00:27:18,150 --> 00:27:23,160
a couple days and four inches a couple

555
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:27,720
weeks later so there was still a lot of

556
00:27:23,160 --> 00:27:30,030
this this year so these are the summer

557
00:27:27,720 --> 00:27:33,350
tomatoes so this is the same thing as

558
00:27:30,030 --> 00:27:38,550
showing you before we grew a cover crop

559
00:27:33,350 --> 00:27:43,080
one area we mowed it and spaded it in

560
00:27:38,550 --> 00:27:44,730
the other one we rolled it this is what

561
00:27:43,080 --> 00:27:46,830
it looked like right after we were done

562
00:27:44,730 --> 00:27:49,740
with that you can see there's hay on the

563
00:27:46,830 --> 00:27:52,050
Left we we mainly use hay we're able to

564
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:54,840
get hay off of Rebecca's family land

565
00:27:52,050 --> 00:27:57,630
next door the one on the right is the

566
00:27:54,840 --> 00:28:02,720
rolled down so things started out

567
00:27:57,630 --> 00:28:05,190
pretty good both of them these are

568
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:08,730
Delarosa I believe or the tomato type

569
00:28:05,190 --> 00:28:13,770
they're summer tomato this is once they

570
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:16,650
really started going I don't know if you

571
00:28:13,770 --> 00:28:20,130
can really tell but this the the hay

572
00:28:16,650 --> 00:28:24,030
mulched ones were really a deeper green

573
00:28:20,130 --> 00:28:26,670
they're a better stand then over here we

574
00:28:24,030 --> 00:28:27,870
weeded these once but after that it was

575
00:28:26,670 --> 00:28:29,070
like well they're kind of on their own

576
00:28:27,870 --> 00:28:35,760
that's the point we don't want to be

577
00:28:29,070 --> 00:28:40,830
spending a lot of time weeding no it's

578
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:44,190
like what type of question was what you

579
00:28:40,830 --> 00:28:46,710
know what type of hay and it was like a

580
00:28:44,190 --> 00:28:50,640
lot of broom there's some clover in

581
00:28:46,710 --> 00:28:52,590
there but yeah it wasn't native we may

582
00:28:50,640 --> 00:28:57,420
be able to get native soon her father

583
00:28:52,590 --> 00:29:01,559
just seeded a lot of switchgrass all

584
00:28:57,420 --> 00:29:03,450
over the farm so maybe in the future so

585
00:29:01,559 --> 00:29:07,140
this year we had a lot of you know the

586
00:29:03,450 --> 00:29:09,510
fruit was really great there was a

587
00:29:07,140 --> 00:29:10,980
problem when they weave

588
00:29:09,510 --> 00:29:13,980
first started going out to harvest our

589
00:29:10,980 --> 00:29:17,160
irrigation had kind of we had some

590
00:29:13,980 --> 00:29:18,720
complications with it for awhile and the

591
00:29:17,160 --> 00:29:21,960
kind of the first fruits that we were

592
00:29:18,720 --> 00:29:23,820
picking had a lot of blossom end rot got

593
00:29:21,960 --> 00:29:28,380
the irrigation working we watered a lot

594
00:29:23,820 --> 00:29:31,050
and that kind of went away and this is

595
00:29:28,380 --> 00:29:33,720
the data from this year so you can see

596
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:39,600
here that once with the hay mulch had

597
00:29:33,720 --> 00:29:43,320
three times the yield that the rolled

598
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:45,900
ones did they both had a decent amount

599
00:29:43,320 --> 00:29:48,450
of fruit set but the hay mulched ones

600
00:29:45,900 --> 00:29:50,880
had had a lot more first this is mainly

601
00:29:48,450 --> 00:29:59,160
first at least first trying to come out

602
00:29:50,880 --> 00:30:01,290
the field so both of the roller crimper

603
00:29:59,160 --> 00:30:02,610
like I said they keep down the weeds

604
00:30:01,290 --> 00:30:04,350
because you're going to plant in them

605
00:30:02,610 --> 00:30:07,830
right pretty much right away so it's a

606
00:30:04,350 --> 00:30:09,660
much better situation we are maybe

607
00:30:07,830 --> 00:30:12,800
considering trying this for the summer

608
00:30:09,660 --> 00:30:15,930
tomatoes a different year and then

609
00:30:12,800 --> 00:30:18,000
mulching rolled down areas right away

610
00:30:15,930 --> 00:30:21,960
and that might really eliminate weeds

611
00:30:18,000 --> 00:30:23,880
and maybe then rolled down crops they'll

612
00:30:21,960 --> 00:30:26,400
get a little more digested you know that

613
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:27,990
top growth if you don't spayed it in it

614
00:30:26,400 --> 00:30:30,330
doesn't really get digested you don't

615
00:30:27,990 --> 00:30:31,800
get as much nutrient release so part of

616
00:30:30,330 --> 00:30:37,560
it is there just wasn't as much in the

617
00:30:31,800 --> 00:30:39,720
soil but spaded in hay mulch beds if you

618
00:30:37,560 --> 00:30:42,540
can get a good spading seem to work as

619
00:30:39,720 --> 00:30:46,340
well as anything so these are some of

620
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:48,990
the costs so the no-till planting aid

621
00:30:46,340 --> 00:30:50,310
with us you already having a tool bar

622
00:30:48,990 --> 00:30:52,380
and a few things was about eleven

623
00:30:50,310 --> 00:30:55,680
hundred bucks a flail mower I was able

624
00:30:52,380 --> 00:30:58,580
to find online actually came out here to

625
00:30:55,680 --> 00:31:03,300
Kansas somewhere to pick it up and then

626
00:30:58,580 --> 00:31:08,600
the coal cedar with the hitch was a

627
00:31:03,300 --> 00:31:10,830
little over four thousand dollars so

628
00:31:08,600 --> 00:31:13,290
sorry there's not more data about what

629
00:31:10,830 --> 00:31:18,150
we planted but it did demonstrate to us

630
00:31:13,290 --> 00:31:19,410
that you know we tried and try it it's

631
00:31:18,150 --> 00:31:22,950
not necessarily a system that's gonna

632
00:31:19,410 --> 00:31:25,580
work in our area in our soils

633
00:31:22,950 --> 00:31:25,580
for us

634
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:41,240
did you ever get rid of the bindweed no

635
00:31:37,930 --> 00:31:44,990
well it's funny the wet year we hardly

636
00:31:41,240 --> 00:31:46,490
saw any bindweed on the farm and we

637
00:31:44,990 --> 00:31:50,060
didn't really have as much this year as

638
00:31:46,490 --> 00:31:54,020
we had two years ago went when I shown

639
00:31:50,060 --> 00:31:56,900
you that we applied Rebecca applied for

640
00:31:54,020 --> 00:31:58,370
a permit from USDA to buy these buying

641
00:31:56,900 --> 00:31:59,240
weed mites have you heard about them at

642
00:31:58,370 --> 00:32:00,650
all

643
00:31:59,240 --> 00:32:04,210
so there's supposedly there are these

644
00:32:00,650 --> 00:32:06,590
mites that only attack buying weed and

645
00:32:04,210 --> 00:32:08,210
somewhere out in Colorado you can buy

646
00:32:06,590 --> 00:32:11,720
them so she had like go through this

647
00:32:08,210 --> 00:32:13,520
whole process and you know it's like if

648
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:15,320
you know same type of paperwork if

649
00:32:13,520 --> 00:32:17,870
you're gonna transfer smallpox across

650
00:32:15,320 --> 00:32:19,730
state lines you know and so she applied

651
00:32:17,870 --> 00:32:21,860
for it and we were gonna do it the next

652
00:32:19,730 --> 00:32:27,520
year but because of all the rain we

653
00:32:21,860 --> 00:32:30,650
didn't do it I had bindweed problem and

654
00:32:27,520 --> 00:32:34,010
cattles worked wonderful yeah I mean

655
00:32:30,650 --> 00:32:37,280
they cleaned it out my only concern was

656
00:32:34,010 --> 00:32:39,440
were they gonna carry seed elsewhere but

657
00:32:37,280 --> 00:32:42,740
they digest the seed

658
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:45,410
I had no spreading so hanging it would

659
00:32:42,740 --> 00:32:48,710
be an option if you can find somebody

660
00:32:45,410 --> 00:32:51,220
that's willing to buy hay with fine weed

661
00:32:48,710 --> 00:32:53,420
in it mm-hmm

662
00:32:51,220 --> 00:32:56,810
yeah we're hoping maybe the chickens

663
00:32:53,420 --> 00:32:59,630
might do something to it too but we

664
00:32:56,810 --> 00:33:01,370
don't know yet have you guys ever tried

665
00:32:59,630 --> 00:33:04,550
anything with like on your cover crop

666
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:08,410
having an edible mixed in with the cover

667
00:33:04,550 --> 00:33:14,230
crop for us oh yeah like as a cash crop

668
00:33:08,410 --> 00:33:14,230
no well I guess I shouldn't say that we

669
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:19,340
kind of we're growing daikons so we

670
00:33:17,630 --> 00:33:22,610
until each radishes and we're doing the

671
00:33:19,340 --> 00:33:26,330
fermenting and right now we're kind of

672
00:33:22,610 --> 00:33:28,010
trying there's some varieties from

673
00:33:26,330 --> 00:33:31,970
Johnny and other places that are really

674
00:33:28,010 --> 00:33:36,020
more culinary and I've tried the till

675
00:33:31,970 --> 00:33:37,310
eat radishes but right now the batch

676
00:33:36,020 --> 00:33:41,450
that we did is really has a lot of

677
00:33:37,310 --> 00:33:43,070
bitterness to it and I suppose if we I

678
00:33:41,450 --> 00:33:43,460
mean it if you plant a whole bed of them

679
00:33:43,070 --> 00:33:44,990
you can

680
00:33:43,460 --> 00:33:46,549
pull up you know hundred pounds and

681
00:33:44,990 --> 00:33:48,110
you're not gonna lose a lot but the

682
00:33:46,549 --> 00:33:49,940
whole idea the cyllage radishes to leave

683
00:33:48,110 --> 00:33:53,270
it in the ground and then otherwise we

684
00:33:49,940 --> 00:33:54,409
don't have a combine you know if we did

685
00:33:53,270 --> 00:33:56,779
we'd probably ever get a lot of

686
00:33:54,409 --> 00:34:00,340
buckwheat because buckwheat like seeds

687
00:33:56,779 --> 00:34:00,340
it you know almost right away

688
00:34:21,460 --> 00:34:23,520
you
