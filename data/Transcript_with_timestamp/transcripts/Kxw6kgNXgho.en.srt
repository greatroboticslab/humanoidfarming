00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,080
welcome back everybody today we're going

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:05,680
to talk about tractor rpms what is the

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,880
right level that you should be setting

4
00:00:05,680 --> 00:00:10,000
your tractor throttle at is there a

5
00:00:07,880 --> 00:00:11,920
one-size-fits-all answer i don't think

6
00:00:10,000 --> 00:00:14,000
so it's more complicated than that a lot

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:16,080
of different scenarios let's get to it

8
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:18,160
now and as always we are proud to be

9
00:00:16,080 --> 00:00:20,560
sponsored by boro wheel spacers if you

10
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:22,320
are feeling tippy on your tractor side

11
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:24,480
to side adding a set of wheel spacers

12
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:26,240
can make a big difference bora is made

13
00:00:24,480 --> 00:00:27,760
in america they have a lifetime warranty

14
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:29,599
get more information at the link down

15
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:31,920
below so the overall concept of this

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:33,200
video is to use that throttle lever to

17
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:34,320
your advantage there are going to be

18
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:35,840
certain times you want to have it

19
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:38,000
cranked up certain times you want to

20
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:40,000
have it lowered all the way down at idle

21
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:41,600
sometimes in between the application

22
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:42,879
will determine that but one of the

23
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:45,280
common questions that is going to

24
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:47,680
typically be asked is if running their

25
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:50,559
tractor's engine at full throttle or

26
00:00:47,680 --> 00:00:52,640
watt wot wide open throttle is going to

27
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:55,360
shorten the life of their diesel engine

28
00:00:52,640 --> 00:00:57,280
now i am not a tractor mechanic i'm not

29
00:00:55,360 --> 00:00:59,359
a diesel mechanic a lot of you guys out

30
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,800
there know more than i do about it so

31
00:00:59,359 --> 00:01:02,800
leave your comments below with what you

32
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:04,640
can do to help other people but what i

33
00:01:02,800 --> 00:01:06,960
found online is that that is typically

34
00:01:04,640 --> 00:01:09,360
not going to be a concern these engines

35
00:01:06,960 --> 00:01:11,520
are made to be ran at full throttle if

36
00:01:09,360 --> 00:01:13,280
you need to for a long extended period

37
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:15,680
of time and in fact typically most

38
00:01:13,280 --> 00:01:17,280
diesel engines run at a lower rpm even

39
00:01:15,680 --> 00:01:19,280
if they are cranked all the way out

40
00:01:17,280 --> 00:01:20,799
compared to a gasoline engine there's

41
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:23,280
actually quite a few folks that will say

42
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:26,159
running a diesel engine at lower rpms

43
00:01:23,280 --> 00:01:28,080
for a long period of time could be worse

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,000
for it than running it at high rpms you

45
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:32,079
have more carbon buildup and that can be

46
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:33,920
an issue as well leading to more regen

47
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:35,759
cycles if you are above that 26

48
00:01:33,920 --> 00:01:37,920
horsepower requirement where typically

49
00:01:35,759 --> 00:01:39,920
you will have fewer regen cycles it will

50
00:01:37,920 --> 00:01:42,079
be longer intervals in between if you

51
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:44,240
are running at high rpms there's more

52
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,720
heat that's generated more of that soot

53
00:01:44,240 --> 00:01:48,960
burns off on a regular basis versus

54
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:51,840
running it at a lower rpm a lower heat

55
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:53,200
level less burn off more regen cycles

56
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:55,200
you can see where i'm going with that

57
00:01:53,200 --> 00:01:56,479
now every engine manufacturer could be a

58
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,159
little bit different so i'd always

59
00:01:56,479 --> 00:01:59,840
encourage you read through your owner's

60
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,360
manual see what they have to say about

61
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,799
it now what i will say is it's probably

62
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:04,960
more important for your startup and

63
00:02:02,799 --> 00:02:06,000
shutdown procedures to be on point

64
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:07,680
you'll want to make sure you have

65
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,239
adequate time for that whole system to

66
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:12,560
get up to speed up to heat so to speak

67
00:02:10,239 --> 00:02:14,080
so let the hydraulic fluid the motor oil

68
00:02:12,560 --> 00:02:15,840
the engine block and everything heat up

69
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:17,520
that way especially on those cold winter

70
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:19,840
days there's less of a chance of a shock

71
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:21,920
to the system and something breaking or

72
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:23,360
cracking or whatever else could happen

73
00:02:21,920 --> 00:02:25,200
same thing on the shutdown if you look

74
00:02:23,360 --> 00:02:27,360
at a john deere manual it will recommend

75
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,720
that you lower that throttle down

76
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,480
let it rest for a couple of minutes

77
00:02:28,720 --> 00:02:31,840
before turning it off so there's several

78
00:02:30,480 --> 00:02:33,599
schools of thought out there but the

79
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:35,840
overarching theme is that these diesel

80
00:02:33,599 --> 00:02:37,360
engines are very robust you're gonna

81
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,120
have to work pretty hard to damage it

82
00:02:37,360 --> 00:02:41,280
but if you can follow what it says in

83
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:43,200
your manual you're gonna be okay okay so

84
00:02:41,280 --> 00:02:44,800
in general adjusting that throttle

85
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,640
control that throttle lever is gonna

86
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:48,239
have a direct impact on some of the

87
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,080
other interfaces that you have with your

88
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,680
tractor so this will affect your ground

89
00:02:50,080 --> 00:02:53,360
speed that you can actually travel with

90
00:02:51,680 --> 00:02:55,680
your tractor it will affect your

91
00:02:53,360 --> 00:02:57,360
hydraulic response time it will affect

92
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:59,120
the amount of hydraulic power that you

93
00:02:57,360 --> 00:03:01,280
have you're going to see an impact to

94
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,120
your pto output speed like on a mower

95
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:04,879
deck a rototiller a brush hog that kind

96
00:03:03,120 --> 00:03:06,879
of thing and like we talked about

97
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:08,959
earlier it will impact your regen

98
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:10,159
frequency on your dpf system so the

99
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,400
frequency that you have to go through

100
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:14,560
that regeneration process will depend

101
00:03:12,400 --> 00:03:16,480
partially on the rpm level that you are

102
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,000
normally running now to make this a bit

103
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:20,159
more comprehensive for you as well

104
00:03:18,000 --> 00:03:21,680
there's a few other considerations that

105
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:23,599
could apply here and there certain

106
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:26,640
tractors certain attachments number one

107
00:03:23,599 --> 00:03:28,720
will be an epto or an economy pto so it

108
00:03:26,640 --> 00:03:31,440
will still allow you to have let's say a

109
00:03:28,720 --> 00:03:33,120
540 rpm rear pto spin rate even though

110
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:35,599
your engine is operating at a lower

111
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:37,280
speed this can save fuel overall perhaps

112
00:03:35,599 --> 00:03:38,879
be easier on the engine and then the

113
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:40,480
tractor as well but that's something

114
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:42,400
that not every tractor is equipped with

115
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,319
typically the larger compacts into the

116
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,159
utility tractors now i hope you are

117
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:48,319

help you out check out

129
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:10,000
goodworkstractors.com a feature that

130
00:04:07,920 --> 00:04:11,120
i've seen on the 2 3 and 4 series and

131
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:13,040
john deere i'm sure some other

132
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:14,959
manufacturers have that as well it's

133
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,519
called the auto throttle function and

134
00:04:14,959 --> 00:04:19,359
what this is is it allows you to well

135
00:04:17,519 --> 00:04:20,880
imagine your tractor more like a car

136
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,720
right and the harder you press a gas

137
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,120
pedal the more the engine revs up the

138
00:04:22,720 --> 00:04:26,639
faster you can go it's a similar concept

139
00:04:25,120 --> 00:04:28,960
with the tractor and the auto throttle

140
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,120
feature if you engage that button or

141
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:32,960
that knob on your tractor set your

142
00:04:31,120 --> 00:04:34,720
throttle to about the mid position all

143
00:04:32,960 --> 00:04:36,479
right so i'm about halfway up and so if

144
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:37,680
you push that pedal down all the way to

145
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,759
the ground you're gonna get that

146
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:41,600
increase in the engine rpms which can

147
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:44,080
lead to an increase in ground speed

148
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:45,919
hydraulic response time hydraulic power

149
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,919
you kind of get the idea and the last

150
00:04:45,919 --> 00:04:49,759
thing worth mentioning it's kind of

151
00:04:47,919 --> 00:04:51,840
related kind of not is the fact that

152
00:04:49,759 --> 00:04:53,680
certain attachments rototillers are a

153
00:04:51,840 --> 00:04:55,360
pretty good example they're oftentimes

154
00:04:53,680 --> 00:04:57,280
going to have additional gears in their

155
00:04:55,360 --> 00:04:59,360
gear box where you can switch things out

156
00:04:57,280 --> 00:05:01,199
or rotate them around to get different

157
00:04:59,360 --> 00:05:03,360
ground speeds for the uh the rate that

158
00:05:01,199 --> 00:05:05,600
the tines spin to make it work with your

159
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:07,360
tractor so who knows maybe there's a way

160
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
if you wanted to really go all out and

161
00:05:07,360 --> 00:05:11,360
try to really fine tune your tractor and

162
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,639
your attachment setup you could tweak

163
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,560
things here and there maybe run it to

164
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:16,479
lower rpm adjust the gear setting here

165
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:17,840
and there i don't know that's beyond my

166
00:05:16,479 --> 00:05:19,680
skill set but i thought it was worth

167
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,360
mentioning all right so i had to take a

168
00:05:19,680 --> 00:05:23,280
whole lot of notes here to keep things

169
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:24,880
straight up in the old noggin so first

170
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:27,280
we want to talk about when you should

171
00:05:24,880 --> 00:05:28,240
run your rpms at a high level or full

172
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:30,800
throttle

173
00:05:28,240 --> 00:05:32,479
wide open throttle wot and so the first

174
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:34,800
example is anytime that you are going to

175
00:05:32,479 --> 00:05:37,600
be using a pto attachment and this could

176
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:39,680
be for the mid pto the rear pto even a

177
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:41,600
front mounted pto which technically or

178
00:05:39,680 --> 00:05:43,280
typically runs off of the mid pto so

179
00:05:41,600 --> 00:05:45,600
snow blowers mower decks tillers brush

180
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:48,639
hogs those kinds of attachments that use

181
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:51,199
a gearbox to drive the blades the auger

182
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:52,960
whatever's being run off of the pto and

183
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:54,880
you need to use this at wide open

184
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:57,280
throttle or very close to it sometimes

185
00:05:54,880 --> 00:06:00,000
you will see a little pto symbol right

186
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:02,240
on your rpm gauge move that throttle up

187
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:03,840
until the needle hits that pto symbol

188
00:06:02,240 --> 00:06:07,039
and that means it's going to get you the

189
00:06:03,840 --> 00:06:09,919
required 540 rpms at the rear pto maybe

190
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
it's 2 000 rpms coming off the mid pto

191
00:06:09,919 --> 00:06:13,520
whatever it is that's what the

192
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,600
attachment is designed to operate at so

193
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:17,280
if you lower your engine rpms down

194
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:18,800
you're going to have a lower speed on

195
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:20,319
the output for the attachment as well

196
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:21,759
which means it's not going to perform as

197
00:06:20,319 --> 00:06:23,840
intended and you're not going to get the

198
00:06:21,759 --> 00:06:25,759
desired results and so oftentimes i will

199
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:27,120
use that little symbol as a guideline

200
00:06:25,759 --> 00:06:28,720
right so maybe if you're using your

201
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:30,000
belly mower it's not that big of a deal

202
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:31,680
you can kind of bury that needle right

203
00:06:30,000 --> 00:06:33,759
on there you're going to be okay but if

204
00:06:31,680 --> 00:06:35,680
i'm using a tiller and i'm going along

205
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,120
you know like out on our property it's

206
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:38,240
going to start to bog down at some point

207
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,759
you're going to see

208
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:41,600
typically on a digital gauge where it's

209
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:44,400
going to tell you you're down to 500

210
00:06:41,600 --> 00:06:46,319
rpms or 510 rpms or 520 whatever it is

211
00:06:44,400 --> 00:06:48,720
and number one you should use that as a

212
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:50,479
queue to slow down you're going too fast

213
00:06:48,720 --> 00:06:52,479
but number two that's why i like to

214
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:54,000
sometimes push it that throttle just a

215
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:55,759
little bit above what it's supposed to

216
00:06:54,000 --> 00:06:57,440
be at because it's going to compensate

217
00:06:55,759 --> 00:06:59,039
once that implement is engaged and

218
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:00,240
having some resistance placed on it now

219
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:02,479
a few other times when you want to

220
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:04,000
typically run at wide open throttle will

221
00:07:02,479 --> 00:07:05,919
be of course if you are kind of in

222
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:07,680
transport mode just moving from point a

223
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,360
to point b you want to be in your

224
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:11,280
highest range so you can move as fast as

225
00:07:09,360 --> 00:07:13,680
you possibly can and full throttle will

226
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:15,520
let you get there as fast as possible

227
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:17,759
the only downside is that typically in

228
00:07:15,520 --> 00:07:19,440
the high range and at full throttle if

229
00:07:17,759 --> 00:07:21,360
you are going up a hill you're not going

230
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,120
to have very much low end torque and so

231
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:25,680
i have been guilty of stalling out my

232
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:27,199
tractor on really big hills because you

233
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,720
just don't have the oomph that you need

234
00:07:27,199 --> 00:07:31,199
to get up there so that mode is really

235
00:07:28,720 --> 00:07:32,319
good on a flat no load type of situation

236
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:34,319
where you just want to get where you got

237
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:35,919
to go as fast as possible another common

238
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,440
application when you have that throttle

239
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:39,919
all the way up is when you need as much

240
00:07:37,440 --> 00:07:42,000
power as possible and not just on the

241
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:43,520
rear pto or the mid pto but on your

242
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:45,280
front end loader if you have a really

243
00:07:43,520 --> 00:07:46,720
heavy load that you have to get lifted

244
00:07:45,280 --> 00:07:48,560
up you're going to get the most

245
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,000
hydraulic power out of your system with

246
00:07:48,560 --> 00:07:51,759
that engine cranked all the way up

247
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:53,199
because the engine is what drives

248
00:07:51,759 --> 00:07:55,199
everything else on your tractor

249
00:07:53,199 --> 00:07:57,039
including the hydraulic pumps so the

250
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:58,800
faster everything is operating the more

251
00:07:57,039 --> 00:08:00,240
flow that you have and the more power

252
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,080
alright so now there are some very

253
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:04,479
specific applications when it pays to

254
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:05,840
have that throttle crank down low maybe

255
00:08:04,479 --> 00:08:07,440
not to idle but we're going to say

256
00:08:05,840 --> 00:08:08,639
anything less than that wide open

257
00:08:07,440 --> 00:08:10,160
throttle there could be different

258
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:12,240
settings always play around with those

259
00:08:10,160 --> 00:08:13,840
settings just see what works for you

260
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:15,759
oftentimes if i'm doing loader work

261
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,360
let's say i have a big pile of dirt or

262
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:18,800
mulch or something else i could find

263
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:21,120
myself constantly playing with the

264
00:08:18,800 --> 00:08:22,800
hydraulic control maybe as i move from

265
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:24,639
point a to point b i'm at full throttle

266
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:26,160
but then when i get to a load i may

267
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:27,599
cranking down a little bit to have more

268
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:29,360
fine tune control over my loader

269
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,039
joystick and so that's really one of the

270
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:33,279
most common applications is when you're

271
00:08:31,039 --> 00:08:34,800
going to be using your hydraulic system

272
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:37,039
typically on the front end loader it

273
00:08:34,800 --> 00:08:38,959
could be on the backhoe as well but

274
00:08:37,039 --> 00:08:41,519
sometimes these tractors come with a

275
00:08:38,959 --> 00:08:44,080
very quick hydraulic system all right

276
00:08:41,519 --> 00:08:46,080
the john deere 3e series for example is

277
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:48,720
lightning fast on its response time with

278
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:51,360
the loader controls it's almost too fast

279
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:53,200
which seems counterintuitive but

280
00:08:51,360 --> 00:08:55,760
i oftentimes will lower that throttle

281
00:08:53,200 --> 00:08:58,160
control down just to give myself some

282
00:08:55,760 --> 00:08:59,680
more control over what i can do with a

283
00:08:58,160 --> 00:09:01,600
bucket if i want to kind of just

284
00:08:59,680 --> 00:09:03,120
gradually spill some material out if i

285
00:09:01,600 --> 00:09:05,120
want to make sure i'm getting very level

286
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,959
as i'm driving into a pile now the same

287
00:09:05,120 --> 00:09:08,560
thing can be said on a backhoe is that

288
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:10,560
if you want to move left to right as

289
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:12,480
you're dumping and scooping piles moving

290
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:14,880
back and forth you can feel real jerky

291
00:09:12,480 --> 00:09:16,720
on there it feels unnatural and annoying

292
00:09:14,880 --> 00:09:18,320
so the flip side of course is if you are

293
00:09:16,720 --> 00:09:19,920
lowering your engine throttle you're not

294
00:09:18,320 --> 00:09:21,279
going to have as much digging power with

295
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:22,959
your backhoe now for a lot of

296
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,360
applications you don't necessarily need

297
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:27,440
to max out your backhoe or your loader

298
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:28,880
and get every last ounce of power out of

299
00:09:27,440 --> 00:09:30,959
it it's more about being able to use

300
00:09:28,880 --> 00:09:32,800
that power efficiently and effectively

301
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,320
and not make a big old mess a couple

302
00:09:32,800 --> 00:09:36,399
other applications when you may want to

303
00:09:34,320 --> 00:09:37,760
run a little bit less than full throttle

304
00:09:36,399 --> 00:09:39,279
of course when you're warming it up and

305
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:40,800
cooling it down

306
00:09:39,279 --> 00:09:42,480
pull that throttle lever down maybe

307
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:44,000
halfway maybe just a little bit above

308
00:09:42,480 --> 00:09:45,920
idle if you want to

309
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:47,760
check your manual see what it has to say

310
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,320
we learned a new application this summer

311
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:52,160
ourselves when our 4720 was overheating

312
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:54,000
in the hot summer sun we ended up

313
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:55,920
actually turning our tractor off as it

314
00:09:54,000 --> 00:09:57,760
was overheating and when we posted that

315
00:09:55,920 --> 00:09:59,680
video we had a lot of really good

316
00:09:57,760 --> 00:10:01,760
comments there that said hey don't turn

317
00:09:59,680 --> 00:10:04,079
your tractor off keep it on lower that

318
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:05,760
throttle down so it's not generating a

319
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,440
ton of heat but if you lower that

320
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:09,120
throttle down the cooling system will

321
00:10:07,440 --> 00:10:11,040
keep working and help that extra heat

322
00:10:09,120 --> 00:10:12,720
dissipate going to lower your overall

323
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:14,399
engine temperature and help your tractor

324
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:16,640
recover quicker and of course these

325
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:19,279
tractors are very efficient so if you

326
00:10:16,640 --> 00:10:21,440
find yourself getting your jobs done too

327
00:10:19,279 --> 00:10:23,760
quickly just slow it down all right just

328
00:10:21,440 --> 00:10:26,079
slow it down lower that engine throttle

329
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:27,519
take a little longer watch that sunset

330
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:28,640
enjoy your tractor time now there of

331
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,640
course are going to be a lot of times

332
00:10:28,640 --> 00:10:32,800
when the engine rpms don't really matter

333
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,399
a whole lot and what i have found using

334
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:35,920
tractors myself is that typically in

335
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,640
applications like grading out your

336
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:40,160
driveway with a landscape rake with a

337
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:42,720
land plane something that's not putting

338
00:10:40,160 --> 00:10:46,240
a heavy load on the tractor you can just

339
00:10:42,720 --> 00:10:47,680
kind of set it in cruise go a mid rpm

340
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:49,200
level do what you want just to get the

341
00:10:47,680 --> 00:10:50,959
speed you want to go there's not going

342
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:52,959
to be a lot of strain in the machine or

343
00:10:50,959 --> 00:10:54,560
on the engine so it's easy to get your

344
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:56,240
job done same thing can be said if

345
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:58,320
you're just pulling along a wagon or a

346
00:10:56,240 --> 00:11:00,160
trailer typically not a whole lot of

347
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:01,680
strain being placed on the tractor if

348
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:03,120
you're on flat ground you know now it

349
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,880
can also depend what kind of ground

350
00:11:03,120 --> 00:11:06,640
you're on if you're in the mud if you're

351
00:11:04,880 --> 00:11:08,560
in snow and ice and you have the engine

352
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:09,839
cranked up too high it could mean that

353
00:11:08,560 --> 00:11:11,760
your tires are just sitting there

354
00:11:09,839 --> 00:11:13,680
slipping and sliding around and maybe

355
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:15,360
lowering that engine rpm a little bit

356
00:11:13,680 --> 00:11:17,200
could lead to your advantage of course

357
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,360
that could also tie into the type of

358
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:20,959
tire that you have on your tractor which

359
00:11:19,360 --> 00:11:23,040
is a whole other story that we've talked

360
00:11:20,959 --> 00:11:24,480
about before but hopefully this points

361
00:11:23,040 --> 00:11:26,480
you in the right direction gives you

362
00:11:24,480 --> 00:11:28,079
some insight as you're sitting on your

363
00:11:26,480 --> 00:11:30,240
tractor getting to use it getting to

364
00:11:28,079 --> 00:11:31,920
know what it's all about use that lever

365
