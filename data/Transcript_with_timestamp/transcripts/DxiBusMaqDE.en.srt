1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,720
hey guys it's and welcome to the channel

2
00:00:02,220 --> 00:00:06,600
today we're going to be looking in on

3
00:00:03,720 --> 00:00:09,300
the DIY bin and the topic that we're

4
00:00:06,600 --> 00:00:11,340
going to deal with today is three things

5
00:00:09,300 --> 00:00:13,320
that can make you more successful in

6
00:00:11,340 --> 00:00:17,220
being a worm farmer

7
00:00:13,320 --> 00:00:18,900
where you may have had problems before

8
00:00:17,220 --> 00:00:20,939
so what we're going to do is we're going

9
00:00:18,900 --> 00:00:22,320
to look at those three things and then

10
00:00:20,939 --> 00:00:25,920
we're going to kind of unpack them

11
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:28,800
number one is being impatient number two

12
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:31,579
is making it way too complicated and

13
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:34,739
number three is loving your worms three

14
00:00:31,579 --> 00:00:36,059
loving your worms too much so as we're

15
00:00:34,739 --> 00:00:38,520
going through and doing the maintenance

16
00:00:36,059 --> 00:00:40,020
on my DIY bin we will go ahead and talk

17
00:00:38,520 --> 00:00:42,300
about those topics

18
00:00:40,020 --> 00:00:44,460
so it's been about three weeks since

19
00:00:42,300 --> 00:00:46,860
we've looked in on this and so we're

20
00:00:44,460 --> 00:00:48,960
just going to kind of look around and

21
00:00:46,860 --> 00:00:51,539
see what we've done I think we fed on

22
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:53,340
the second layer down

23
00:00:51,539 --> 00:00:55,379
and we're just going to kind of look at

24
00:00:53,340 --> 00:00:57,960
this it was refreshed uh I'll put how

25
00:00:55,379 --> 00:00:59,460
long ago it was refreshed in the window

26
00:00:57,960 --> 00:01:01,320
there

27
00:00:59,460 --> 00:01:03,480
so you can tell this is actually really

28
00:01:01,320 --> 00:01:05,460
new this has got a lot of cardboard to

29
00:01:03,480 --> 00:01:06,840
it and also has a lot of the coconut

30
00:01:05,460 --> 00:01:08,700
core in there

31
00:01:06,840 --> 00:01:10,860
so this is nowhere near you know

32
00:01:08,700 --> 00:01:12,840
migrating or anything like that but

33
00:01:10,860 --> 00:01:15,479
we're going to start with topic number

34
00:01:12,840 --> 00:01:17,340
one which is being impatient so when you

35
00:01:15,479 --> 00:01:18,840
first start being a worm farmer you

36
00:01:17,340 --> 00:01:21,780
start a new bin

37
00:01:18,840 --> 00:01:24,240
the expectations that people have that

38
00:01:21,780 --> 00:01:26,820
the the new bin or when you're a new

39
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:28,799
farmer just new in general is that

40
00:01:26,820 --> 00:01:30,960
basically

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:33,000
um your worms are going to work as fast

42
00:01:30,960 --> 00:01:34,979
as anybody else's

43
00:01:33,000 --> 00:01:36,840
and that's just not true when you first

44
00:01:34,979 --> 00:01:38,159
have a worm bin and you just start it

45
00:01:36,840 --> 00:01:40,259
and you make your bedding and you put

46
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:42,240
your worms in there and you hear all of

47
00:01:40,259 --> 00:01:45,900
the stories that one pound of worms or

48
00:01:42,240 --> 00:01:47,820
half a kilo will eat that much in food

49
00:01:45,900 --> 00:01:50,159
every day or every week or whatever the

50
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:52,200
story is that is totally not true

51
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,600
I've been doing this for you know quite

52
00:01:52,200 --> 00:01:57,360
a few years now and I just don't find

53
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:58,920
that to be true in my situation maybe

54
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:01,079
there's some situation out there where

55
00:01:58,920 --> 00:02:02,640
it is true but it is not here

56
00:02:01,079 --> 00:02:06,060
so basically if you're going to expect

57
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:08,819
those worms to eat uh their body weight

58
00:02:06,060 --> 00:02:11,280
every day then you are going to end up

59
00:02:08,819 --> 00:02:13,200
with a big mess and probably dead worms

60
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:15,180
and a lot of stinkiness

61
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:17,940
so we don't you know do not accept that

62
00:02:15,180 --> 00:02:20,040
do not do not be impatient and try and

63
00:02:17,940 --> 00:02:23,340
Rush your worms into eating too much

64
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:25,920
food you need to always evaluate what

65
00:02:23,340 --> 00:02:27,900
the worms are doing and then let them be

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,760
your guide if there's no food left then

67
00:02:27,900 --> 00:02:32,040
you feed them more if there's a lot of

68
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:34,500
food left don't feed them

69
00:02:32,040 --> 00:02:36,599
and also you know if they uh appear to

70
00:02:34,500 --> 00:02:39,180
be as far as moisture goes just don't

71
00:02:36,599 --> 00:02:40,860
assume that they need to be sopping wet

72
00:02:39,180 --> 00:02:43,260
because they breathe through their skin

73
00:02:40,860 --> 00:02:45,540
so they need air as well so if

74
00:02:43,260 --> 00:02:48,959
everything is soft and wet you know then

75
00:02:45,540 --> 00:02:51,360
the worms might also not be happy so

76
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:53,940
don't get impatient and just think that

77
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:55,500
uh you follow all of the little things

78
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:56,819
you hear on Facebook

79
00:02:55,500 --> 00:02:59,459
all right so let's look at the next

80
00:02:56,819 --> 00:03:01,500
layer down I will admit when I first

81
00:02:59,459 --> 00:03:04,019
started making worm bins and having worm

82
00:03:01,500 --> 00:03:05,400
farm I will admit that I was impatient

83
00:03:04,019 --> 00:03:07,080
and I really thought that I was gonna

84
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:09,840
you know save the world from you know

85
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:12,300
all of the the garbage and my worms were

86
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,700
going to take care of it all and the

87
00:03:12,300 --> 00:03:17,879
reality versus my expectations were not

88
00:03:14,700 --> 00:03:20,159
aligned as it turns out you know when

89
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:22,019
your worm farm is new you know you get

90
00:03:20,159 --> 00:03:24,000
impatient to put all of this food in

91
00:03:22,019 --> 00:03:26,700
here and then as it turns out you really

92
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:29,940
need an ecosystem in your worm bins in

93
00:03:26,700 --> 00:03:32,280
order to take care of that much food and

94
00:03:29,940 --> 00:03:34,280
so when you don't have the springtails

95
00:03:32,280 --> 00:03:36,780
and the mites and the roly-polies and

96
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:39,360
everything else as far as bacteria and

97
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:41,819
fungus in your worm bin then it's not

98
00:03:39,360 --> 00:03:44,340
going to operate as quickly so you do

99
00:03:41,819 --> 00:03:46,260
have to wait about almost six months for

100
00:03:44,340 --> 00:03:49,440
the biology to catch up with your

101
00:03:46,260 --> 00:03:52,140
expectations I think we did

102
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,700
feet on this side over here

103
00:03:52,140 --> 00:03:54,840
actually don't remember what it was I

104
00:03:53,700 --> 00:03:57,720
think it was

105
00:03:54,840 --> 00:04:00,420
soup stuff so I did say that the uh the

106
00:03:57,720 --> 00:04:02,700
slow food was going to be the the potato

107
00:04:00,420 --> 00:04:05,580
peels and I think I can smell onion in

108
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:08,340
here but I don't I don't see it oh there

109
00:04:05,580 --> 00:04:10,560
it is there's the tomato or the onion

110
00:04:08,340 --> 00:04:12,480
end and

111
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:15,780
I'll try and hold it still

112
00:04:12,480 --> 00:04:16,979
but there are springtails in there I

113
00:04:15,780 --> 00:04:18,780
don't know if I see anything else other

114
00:04:16,979 --> 00:04:20,459
than worms and springtails I don't see

115
00:04:18,780 --> 00:04:22,919
any mice but if I hold still long enough

116
00:04:20,459 --> 00:04:25,520
maybe I can do a time lapse and we'll be

117
00:04:22,919 --> 00:04:25,520
able to see it

118
00:04:29,160 --> 00:04:34,740
okay so then looking at the other food

119
00:04:31,860 --> 00:04:38,460
or looking for the other food rather

120
00:04:34,740 --> 00:04:40,139
then yeah I'm just seeing that potato so

121
00:04:38,460 --> 00:04:41,759
far that's all I'm seeing so they've

122
00:04:40,139 --> 00:04:43,199
they've eaten everything else I'll have

123
00:04:41,759 --> 00:04:45,600
to put a picture up there of what all we

124
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:48,300
did feed them but the only evidence I'm

125
00:04:45,600 --> 00:04:50,340
seeing is that onion and the potato

126
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:53,840
which is trying to grow

127
00:04:50,340 --> 00:04:53,840
long time of the year dude

128
00:04:54,360 --> 00:04:57,720
Okay so

129
00:04:56,160 --> 00:05:00,300
the second point that I wanted to get to

130
00:04:57,720 --> 00:05:02,880
is that new worm Farmers make it overly

131
00:05:00,300 --> 00:05:04,919
complicated I know I did so when I made

132
00:05:02,880 --> 00:05:07,380
this bin you know I assumed it had to

133
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:10,080
have three layers and it had to have a

134
00:05:07,380 --> 00:05:12,060
lid and screen and and that I couldn't

135
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:13,800
feed you know onions and tomatoes

136
00:05:12,060 --> 00:05:15,960
because it would you know hurt the worms

137
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,360
and what it turns out too is there's a

138
00:05:15,960 --> 00:05:20,880
lot of urban legends

139
00:05:18,360 --> 00:05:22,680
um as Patrick would say and basically

140
00:05:20,880 --> 00:05:25,259
you know they're not people they're not

141
00:05:22,680 --> 00:05:27,900
dogs they don't have the same you know

142
00:05:25,259 --> 00:05:30,000
wants and likes and and skin that we do

143
00:05:27,900 --> 00:05:31,680
so you know I had all these things that

144
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:34,020
I was like not feeding the worms and had

145
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:37,320
to go drag outside but as it turns out

146
00:05:34,020 --> 00:05:39,780
you can feed worms onion and green

147
00:05:37,320 --> 00:05:42,000
pepper and tomatoes you know you just

148
00:05:39,780 --> 00:05:44,039
have to like any other food you have to

149
00:05:42,000 --> 00:05:46,320
watch how much you feed them versus how

150
00:05:44,039 --> 00:05:49,919
many worms you have and the only way you

151
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:52,800
know how often to feed is to look and

152
00:05:49,919 --> 00:05:55,680
see is the food gone nope don't feed

153
00:05:52,800 --> 00:05:58,199
all right bottom level okay so here we

154
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,759
are at the bottom level and uh looks

155
00:05:58,199 --> 00:06:01,979
like it's doing great look at that it's

156
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,520
good worms

157
00:06:01,979 --> 00:06:07,320
love that last time it was kind of dry

158
00:06:04,520 --> 00:06:09,419
and uh didn't look like it was meat you

159
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:11,100
know making too much progress down here

160
00:06:09,419 --> 00:06:12,960
but they have really done a good job

161
00:06:11,100 --> 00:06:14,580
once I added that water

162
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:16,199
you know and that's another point is

163
00:06:14,580 --> 00:06:18,900
that uh you know just paying attention

164
00:06:16,199 --> 00:06:21,600
to what's going on in your worm bin is

165
00:06:18,900 --> 00:06:24,500
is worth everything

166
00:06:21,600 --> 00:06:28,560
um because number you know number three

167
00:06:24,500 --> 00:06:31,440
is on your you know to-do list here is

168
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:34,199
to not aggravate your worms too much so

169
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:36,180
you can love your worms to death and one

170
00:06:34,199 --> 00:06:39,240
of the ways that you can do that is by

171
00:06:36,180 --> 00:06:41,280
looking in on them twice a day feeding

172
00:06:39,240 --> 00:06:42,240
them too much food

173
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:44,699
um

174
00:06:42,240 --> 00:06:46,979
some worms are very fussy and they do

175
00:06:44,699 --> 00:06:48,060
not like to have people peeking at them

176
00:06:46,979 --> 00:06:50,520
all the time

177
00:06:48,060 --> 00:06:53,460
and that is one of the problems that you

178
00:06:50,520 --> 00:06:56,400
can have is that if you're in that bin

179
00:06:53,460 --> 00:06:58,560
you know twice a day once a day you can

180
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,600
spook them and certain types of worms

181
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:03,240
will try to crawl the wall and Escape if

182
00:07:00,600 --> 00:07:04,800
you pester them too much and also by

183
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:06,600
loving them too much you can give them

184
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,740
too much food I'm going to give them a

185
00:07:06,600 --> 00:07:10,380
little bedding down here because it

186
00:07:07,740 --> 00:07:14,580
looks like they're they are in need so

187
00:07:10,380 --> 00:07:16,319
that's rule one evaluate and then act

188
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:18,660
so I'm just going to give them a little

189
00:07:16,319 --> 00:07:20,460
sprinkle of new bedding down here just

190
00:07:18,660 --> 00:07:21,780
to give them something to work on I'm

191
00:07:20,460 --> 00:07:24,240
not really sure if the worms come from

192
00:07:21,780 --> 00:07:25,800
this bottom level up all right let's put

193
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:30,000
the second

194
00:07:25,800 --> 00:07:32,580
row back up okay so

195
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:34,440
this is our our second level and we fed

196
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:36,479
a little bit and it does have a little

197
00:07:34,440 --> 00:07:37,919
bit left so I'm just going to switch

198
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:40,560
sides over here and I'm going to give

199
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:42,539
them a little bit more of kind of the

200
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:45,539
same food

201
00:07:42,539 --> 00:07:47,400
basically stuff I made soup with some

202
00:07:45,539 --> 00:07:49,440
avocados

203
00:07:47,400 --> 00:07:52,259
I think this is a tomato

204
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:54,300
yeah it's all wrinkly so just some slow

205
00:07:52,259 --> 00:07:55,560
food there and one little piece of fast

206
00:07:54,300 --> 00:07:57,780
food

207
00:07:55,560 --> 00:08:00,479
and that should keep this layer going

208
00:07:57,780 --> 00:08:02,340
good for quite some time I'm going to

209
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:05,720
give them a little bit of extra bedding

210
00:08:02,340 --> 00:08:05,720
on this side just to keep it level

211
00:08:06,599 --> 00:08:10,139
okay

212
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:11,759
that just kind of keeps it from

213
00:08:10,139 --> 00:08:13,740
kiltering

214
00:08:11,759 --> 00:08:16,440
all right we're back on the top layer

215
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:17,759
here and uh since we fed over here on

216
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:19,860
that second layer I think I'm going to

217
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:22,979
do the feeding over on this side just so

218
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:25,500
that the drippings can go down evenly

219
00:08:22,979 --> 00:08:28,699
and the um the good stuff can get picked

220
00:08:25,500 --> 00:08:28,699
up by the worms in the bottom

221
00:08:30,740 --> 00:08:36,000
and I'm going to give them a really big

222
00:08:33,180 --> 00:08:38,039
mix of slow and fast food here so that

223
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:41,039
they will have enough for the next three

224
00:08:38,039 --> 00:08:43,680
weeks these are apples not frozen some

225
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:46,080
of them are frozen so they're going to

226
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,880
last probably a month maybe even two

227
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:49,620
let's grab that sticker

228
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:52,440
so even though this looks like a lot of

229
00:08:49,620 --> 00:08:53,880
food this is a lot of slow food they

230
00:08:52,440 --> 00:08:57,240
might be able to nibble most of this

231
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:58,680
banana away but for the most part this

232
00:08:57,240 --> 00:09:00,839
is going to be in here the next time we

233
00:08:58,680 --> 00:09:03,600
visit the worms so I hope that all of

234
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:06,180
these tips were helpful to you to learn

235
00:09:03,600 --> 00:09:08,880
how to you know not love your worms to

236
00:09:06,180 --> 00:09:10,500
death and also don't don't restrict

237
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:12,600
yourself to so many rules and make

238
00:09:10,500 --> 00:09:14,700
everything so complicated

239
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:16,260
and then hopefully that'll give you also

240
00:09:14,700 --> 00:09:18,180
a little bit of an idea that you do need

241
00:09:16,260 --> 00:09:20,640
to be patient and don't pester your

242
00:09:18,180 --> 00:09:22,680
worms too often and expect them to be

243
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,920
eating their weight in food every single

244
00:09:22,680 --> 00:09:27,720
day or week if you like this bin the DIY
