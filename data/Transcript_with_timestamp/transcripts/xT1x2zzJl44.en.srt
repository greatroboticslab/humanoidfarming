1
00:00:00,060 --> 00:00:05,880
today I'm going to be talking about

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:08,340
budgeting for strawberry production

3
00:00:05,880 --> 00:00:10,200
my name is Jesse Rowan I'm on the farm

4
00:00:08,340 --> 00:00:12,599
and agribusiness team as well as the

5
00:00:10,200 --> 00:00:14,040
commercial Horticulture team so I work

6
00:00:12,599 --> 00:00:15,719
primarily with fruit and vegetable

7
00:00:14,040 --> 00:00:18,119
Growers

8
00:00:15,719 --> 00:00:21,720
um in the central part of the state

9
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:23,460
and so today I'm going to talk about I'm

10
00:00:21,720 --> 00:00:25,439
going to talk about the budget that we

11
00:00:23,460 --> 00:00:28,080
have available online

12
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:29,939
through the extension website and then

13
00:00:28,080 --> 00:00:32,880
I'm going to kind of break it down by

14
00:00:29,939 --> 00:00:34,620
the different input costs within that

15
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:37,079
budget and the different input costs

16
00:00:34,620 --> 00:00:39,000
related to Strawberry production and

17
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:41,579
then I'm going to touch on how you can

18
00:00:39,000 --> 00:00:44,719
budget for your farm

19
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:44,719
for your own form

20
00:00:45,059 --> 00:00:50,820
all right so to start with the budget we

21
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:53,399
have online it looks a lot like this

22
00:00:50,820 --> 00:00:54,960
it's just that first summary page and

23
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:58,079
it's actually

24
00:00:54,960 --> 00:01:02,579
um it's from 2019. we are in the process

25
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:04,320
of getting an updated version put online

26
00:01:02,579 --> 00:01:05,519
but

27
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:07,200
um if you can't tell a lot of things

28
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:09,780
have changed in the past few years a lot

29
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:12,659
of prices have gone up but this budget

30
00:01:09,780 --> 00:01:16,979
still really provides a good list a good

31
00:01:12,659 --> 00:01:19,680
summary of the expected cost uh just the

32
00:01:16,979 --> 00:01:21,439
expected expenses you would have on one

33
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,000
acre of strawberries

34
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:27,360
some of the assumptions within this

35
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:30,420
Enterprise budget that's already online

36
00:01:27,360 --> 00:01:32,939
um or that we use six foot spacing that

37
00:01:30,420 --> 00:01:36,540
all these strawberries are sold for The

38
00:01:32,939 --> 00:01:39,060
Fresh Market that plastic mulch is used

39
00:01:36,540 --> 00:01:40,460
um and within this budget they also

40
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:43,140
account for

41
00:01:40,460 --> 00:01:45,600
Harvest labor it's not a U-Pick

42
00:01:43,140 --> 00:01:48,780
operation this is if you were to hire

43
00:01:45,600 --> 00:01:50,520
crop workers to harvest your entire crop

44
00:01:48,780 --> 00:01:52,619
of strawberries and also within this

45
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:55,500
budget they account for cover crops

46
00:01:52,619 --> 00:01:57,899
which is great that's something

47
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:59,399
chip really looks as big on and he could

48
00:01:57,899 --> 00:02:00,720
touch on it more if anyone had questions

49
00:01:59,399 --> 00:02:03,240
about it

50
00:02:00,720 --> 00:02:04,439
but also within this budget this online

51
00:02:03,240 --> 00:02:07,500
already

52
00:02:04,439 --> 00:02:09,000
so the first page of it is and is that

53
00:02:07,500 --> 00:02:11,760
summary that I just showed you on the

54
00:02:09,000 --> 00:02:14,520
first page the second third and fourth

55
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:16,739
page it kind of it lists out the field

56
00:02:14,520 --> 00:02:18,239
operations and it looks a little

57
00:02:16,739 --> 00:02:20,040
intimidating if you're looking at this

58
00:02:18,239 --> 00:02:21,360
and you see a lot of numbers and a lot

59
00:02:20,040 --> 00:02:23,700
of decimals

60
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:26,160
but really it's really good to look at

61
00:02:23,700 --> 00:02:28,980
to see the operation you know what

62
00:02:26,160 --> 00:02:32,400
activity you might be doing like a soil

63
00:02:28,980 --> 00:02:36,180
test you know applying fertilizer apply

64
00:02:32,400 --> 00:02:38,760
in line or plant in your cover crops and

65
00:02:36,180 --> 00:02:41,099
it also shows you in what month you

66
00:02:38,760 --> 00:02:43,140
could do that and this there's a little

67
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:45,300
give and take for you know people

68
00:02:43,140 --> 00:02:47,580
growing strawberries in north or south

69
00:02:45,300 --> 00:02:49,980
Alabama but it's a really good guide a

70
00:02:47,580 --> 00:02:51,540
good estimate to look at to kind of just

71
00:02:49,980 --> 00:02:53,940
show you the activities when you can

72
00:02:51,540 --> 00:02:54,480
expect to do them

73
00:02:53,940 --> 00:02:57,060
um

74
00:02:54,480 --> 00:02:58,560
and kind of in the order of which you

75
00:02:57,060 --> 00:03:00,599
should do things like they have soil

76
00:02:58,560 --> 00:03:01,620
tests and then later on in the season I

77
00:03:00,599 --> 00:03:03,840
think it's in

78
00:03:01,620 --> 00:03:06,180
March they have

79
00:03:03,840 --> 00:03:07,980
um they want you to do a plant tissue

80
00:03:06,180 --> 00:03:10,379
sample so it really just gives you the

81
00:03:07,980 --> 00:03:13,760
optimal optimal time in which to do

82
00:03:10,379 --> 00:03:13,760
these activities

83
00:03:13,800 --> 00:03:19,319
um and it also gives a good estimate of

84
00:03:16,620 --> 00:03:21,180
about how many Harvest hours you could

85
00:03:19,319 --> 00:03:22,920
expect you know

86
00:03:21,180 --> 00:03:25,379
um a lot of

87
00:03:22,920 --> 00:03:27,180
labor hour estimates that are really

88
00:03:25,379 --> 00:03:29,519
that would be really beneficial to

89
00:03:27,180 --> 00:03:32,480
someone planning on starting a

90
00:03:29,519 --> 00:03:32,480
strawberry operation

91
00:03:32,519 --> 00:03:36,780
so I wanted to talk next about the input

92
00:03:35,819 --> 00:03:40,319
cost

93
00:03:36,780 --> 00:03:42,480
uh so since his budget is made uh since

94
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,459
it's from 2019

95
00:03:42,480 --> 00:03:46,500
you would expect a lot of things have

96
00:03:44,459 --> 00:03:48,000
gone up since then you know covet has

97
00:03:46,500 --> 00:03:50,400
occurred since then

98
00:03:48,000 --> 00:03:52,920
and then all the supply chain issues

99
00:03:50,400 --> 00:03:55,379
that occurred then and have still kind

100
00:03:52,920 --> 00:03:57,959
of hung around some so that's going to

101
00:03:55,379 --> 00:03:59,940
be things like fertilizer that's going

102
00:03:57,959 --> 00:04:01,379
to be something that you can look at

103
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:04,500
this budget you can look at this budget

104
00:04:01,379 --> 00:04:06,540
summary but know that the prices are

105
00:04:04,500 --> 00:04:10,319
going to be a lot higher for things like

106
00:04:06,540 --> 00:04:11,159
fertilizer chemicals plants labor and

107
00:04:10,319 --> 00:04:12,780
fuel

108
00:04:11,159 --> 00:04:15,900
I mean you can look at the price of

109
00:04:12,780 --> 00:04:19,459
diesel fuel in this 2019 budget and see

110
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:19,459
there's 270 a gallon

111
00:04:19,859 --> 00:04:24,060
that's not where we're at today as

112
00:04:21,900 --> 00:04:27,600
lovely as that would be and you can also

113
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:29,820
see they accounted for 11 an hour for a

114
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:32,100
lot of their labor that's it's really

115
00:04:29,820 --> 00:04:34,620
it's really going to be tough to come by

116
00:04:32,100 --> 00:04:37,560
any labor nowadays uh where you're

117
00:04:34,620 --> 00:04:38,759
paying them 11 an hour

118
00:04:37,560 --> 00:04:41,280
um and then some of the obvious things

119
00:04:38,759 --> 00:04:43,020
are like fertilizer chemicals and plants

120
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:45,419
those have gone up over the past couple

121
00:04:43,020 --> 00:04:48,020
years especially fertilizer and

122
00:04:45,419 --> 00:04:51,780
chemicals have gone up with the fuel

123
00:04:48,020 --> 00:04:54,479
fuel cost increases

124
00:04:51,780 --> 00:04:56,820
um just as energy goes up in price those

125
00:04:54,479 --> 00:04:58,680
are going to correlate right along with

126
00:04:56,820 --> 00:05:01,080
it

127
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:03,720
oh

128
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:05,280
sorry I went back a couple of slides

129
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:08,820
so first I'm going to talk about

130
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:10,380
fertilizer the it's right on the nose

131
00:05:08,820 --> 00:05:12,360
everyone knows that the price of

132
00:05:10,380 --> 00:05:14,340
fertilizer has gone up drastically in

133
00:05:12,360 --> 00:05:16,380
the past couple years so

134
00:05:14,340 --> 00:05:17,780
in that older budget they estimated that

135
00:05:16,380 --> 00:05:21,960
you'd spend about

136
00:05:17,780 --> 00:05:24,360
665 dollars on an acre of strawberries

137
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:26,639
yes no longer the case

138
00:05:24,360 --> 00:05:28,500
I can't give exact numbers for y'all

139
00:05:26,639 --> 00:05:30,960
today because that's going to depend on

140
00:05:28,500 --> 00:05:33,000
your soil test and you know what kind of

141
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:36,720
fertilizer what you need for your farm

142
00:05:33,000 --> 00:05:39,600
what you need for your land but the USDA

143
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:41,820
economic research service they estimated

144
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:45,000
and this is just around nitrogen

145
00:05:41,820 --> 00:05:48,720
fertilizers but they estimated that

146
00:05:45,000 --> 00:05:51,060
all three kinds of nitrogen fertilizer

147
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:54,780
are going to go up you know over 100

148
00:05:51,060 --> 00:05:56,940
percent you can see in this graph this

149
00:05:54,780 --> 00:05:59,759
graph is just showing how urea prices

150
00:05:56,940 --> 00:06:02,160
have changed over the past two years so

151
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:03,539
you see that purple line is 20 20. you

152
00:06:02,160 --> 00:06:07,320
know pretty steady a little up and down

153
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:10,380
but pretty pretty bag unsteady the green

154
00:06:07,320 --> 00:06:12,539
line 2021 you see around September the

155
00:06:10,380 --> 00:06:15,060
end the last quarter of last year it

156
00:06:12,539 --> 00:06:18,840
skyrocketed and then you see the red

157
00:06:15,060 --> 00:06:25,380
line is 2022. continues to go up it

158
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:28,259
starts at 920 an acre uh I mean 920 a

159
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:30,960
ton for urea and then you can see it's

160
00:06:28,259 --> 00:06:32,819
just angling up so it's really it's just

161
00:06:30,960 --> 00:06:34,259
going to get higher

162
00:06:32,819 --> 00:06:37,020
um and that's really just something to

163
00:06:34,259 --> 00:06:38,759
take into consideration when you're

164
00:06:37,020 --> 00:06:41,100
planning for your strawberry operation

165
00:06:38,759 --> 00:06:43,440
or really any kind of operation

166
00:06:41,100 --> 00:06:46,440
and something that extension really

167
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:49,020
encourages is testing your stool that

168
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:50,460
way you're accurately applying the

169
00:06:49,020 --> 00:06:52,259
correct amount of fertilizer you're not

170
00:06:50,460 --> 00:06:53,160
spending money on fertilizer that you

171
00:06:52,259 --> 00:06:55,740
don't need

172
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:56,759
that's not going to be absorbed well in

173
00:06:55,740 --> 00:06:59,759
your soil

174
00:06:56,759 --> 00:07:02,280
and so a soil sample that is really just

175
00:06:59,759 --> 00:07:05,400
going to give you a really good idea of

176
00:07:02,280 --> 00:07:07,440
what you need to put in your soil and

177
00:07:05,400 --> 00:07:10,620
also a couple times a year with a

178
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:13,560
strawberry operation you could have a

179
00:07:10,620 --> 00:07:14,580
tissue sample sent off and test for the

180
00:07:13,560 --> 00:07:17,940
nutrients

181
00:07:14,580 --> 00:07:19,620
in that exact tissue sample um so the

182
00:07:17,940 --> 00:07:20,639
cost for a soil sample is around seven

183
00:07:19,620 --> 00:07:23,039
dollars

184
00:07:20,639 --> 00:07:25,620
that's pretty inexpensive to me to know

185
00:07:23,039 --> 00:07:28,020
exactly what my land needs and

186
00:07:25,620 --> 00:07:30,000
especially as the prices of fertilizer

187
00:07:28,020 --> 00:07:32,580
just continue to go up

188
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:35,039
paying seven dollars to know exactly

189
00:07:32,580 --> 00:07:37,319
what you need to spend on fertilizer

190
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:39,660
is a pretty good deal

191
00:07:37,319 --> 00:07:42,180
um that way you're not spending money on

192
00:07:39,660 --> 00:07:43,319
it extra fertilizer that you're not

193
00:07:42,180 --> 00:07:45,660
going to need

194
00:07:43,319 --> 00:07:46,860
um so really this just kind of goes to

195
00:07:45,660 --> 00:07:50,280
show that

196
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:52,020
when you're trying to budget for any

197
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:54,599
kind of fruit or vegetable production

198
00:07:52,020 --> 00:07:56,580
you know and prices are going up in all

199
00:07:54,599 --> 00:07:59,819
these different input sections

200
00:07:56,580 --> 00:08:03,240
the more the more accurate and the more

201
00:07:59,819 --> 00:08:05,520
tailored you can make those costs to

202
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:08,160
your farm the better the more efficient

203
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,479
you can be the better because really at

204
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:12,720
the end of the day that's all you can do

205
00:08:09,479 --> 00:08:14,460
you can control what you can control you

206
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:16,740
can't control the fertilizer process you

207
00:08:14,460 --> 00:08:18,780
can't make them go down can't make the

208
00:08:16,740 --> 00:08:22,800
price of fuel go down but all you can do

209
00:08:18,780 --> 00:08:25,139
is use just what you need not spending

210
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:29,220
money on things you don't need and just

211
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:30,419
having as efficiently run operation as

212
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:32,399
you can

213
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:35,219
um and I also just wanted to throw in

214
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:38,339
that you can spend anywhere between ten

215
00:08:35,219 --> 00:08:40,440
or eighty dollars for a tissue sample

216
00:08:38,339 --> 00:08:43,620
and that can give you a really good idea

217
00:08:40,440 --> 00:08:46,339
of the nutrients your plants themselves

218
00:08:43,620 --> 00:08:46,339
are taking up

219
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:51,660
so the next thing I wanted to touch on

220
00:08:49,080 --> 00:08:54,060
um the next input cost that's gone up

221
00:08:51,660 --> 00:08:56,160
has been labor

222
00:08:54,060 --> 00:08:58,980
and this graph you don't have to look at

223
00:08:56,160 --> 00:09:01,080
all the numbers per se but really just

224
00:08:58,980 --> 00:09:05,040
focusing on the fact that that green

225
00:09:01,080 --> 00:09:09,060
line is the number of crop workers that

226
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:12,720
have been uh oh sorry the green line is

227
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:14,459
the dollars per hour that those uh that

228
00:09:12,720 --> 00:09:18,720
crop workers are being paid you can see

229
00:09:14,459 --> 00:09:21,360
it in 2015 it was pretty low it was

230
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:25,680
around 11 an hour

231
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:28,620
um at the tail end of 2021 the wage for

232
00:09:25,680 --> 00:09:30,779
those workers was around 15 an hour

233
00:09:28,620 --> 00:09:34,080
you can look at that blue one that just

234
00:09:30,779 --> 00:09:36,500
shows the number of workers has stayed

235
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:38,940
pretty steady it dips down

236
00:09:36,500 --> 00:09:41,580
and this is really related to fruit and

237
00:09:38,940 --> 00:09:44,100
vegetable production so the number of

238
00:09:41,580 --> 00:09:46,140
crop workers is going to get down around

239
00:09:44,100 --> 00:09:48,839
January December of every year because

240
00:09:46,140 --> 00:09:52,019
that's just when we don't have as many

241
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:54,120
crop workers in the U.S a lot of them

242
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:56,220
come through on a program that's around

243
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,700
10 months long so

244
00:09:56,220 --> 00:10:02,040
um they may go back to their home for a

245
00:09:59,700 --> 00:10:03,959
couple months a year but the top of

246
00:10:02,040 --> 00:10:07,080
those Peaks that's going to show that's

247
00:10:03,959 --> 00:10:09,480
a really good representation of the

248
00:10:07,080 --> 00:10:10,980
number of crop workers just hired in the

249
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:13,320
U.S and you can see the top of this

250
00:10:10,980 --> 00:10:15,480
Peaks it stayed pretty steady it goes It

251
00:10:13,320 --> 00:10:18,720
goes across pretty well it was a little

252
00:10:15,480 --> 00:10:21,060
lower in 2020 because covet threw off

253
00:10:18,720 --> 00:10:22,440
everything but you can see that the

254
00:10:21,060 --> 00:10:24,600
number of workers has stayed pretty

255
00:10:22,440 --> 00:10:27,600
steady yet the price that we're paying

256
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:30,600
those workers continues to go up it does

257
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:33,320
not dip down much just steadily

258
00:10:30,600 --> 00:10:33,320
increasing

259
00:10:34,800 --> 00:10:39,720
um and another just another segment of

260
00:10:37,560 --> 00:10:43,140
that budget that has increased along

261
00:10:39,720 --> 00:10:45,839
with everything else row cover this may

262
00:10:43,140 --> 00:10:47,640
not be as drastic of a price increase as

263
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,560
some of the other objects

264
00:10:47,640 --> 00:10:51,720
um it was priced around a thousand

265
00:10:49,560 --> 00:10:55,860
dollars a roll in 2019

266
00:10:51,720 --> 00:10:59,399
I've looked up similar roles in 2022 I

267
00:10:55,860 --> 00:11:02,160
seen some for around 1200 1400

268
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:04,200
um and you have that initial investment

269
00:11:02,160 --> 00:11:06,660
but it is something that you can reuse

270
00:11:04,200 --> 00:11:08,700
so it's not something that you might

271
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:10,980
have to buy every year or a couple times

272
00:11:08,700 --> 00:11:12,720
a year or something you can get a lot of

273
00:11:10,980 --> 00:11:15,600
uses out of

274
00:11:12,720 --> 00:11:18,360
um but also something specific to

275
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:22,200
Strawberry production so you have a lot

276
00:11:18,360 --> 00:11:24,420
of labor involved in using a row cover

277
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:26,459
and a row cover is necessary in

278
00:11:24,420 --> 00:11:29,220
Strawberry production whenever it gets

279
00:11:26,459 --> 00:11:30,779
below freezing temperatures you have to

280
00:11:29,220 --> 00:11:32,880
cover up the strawberry so they're not

281
00:11:30,779 --> 00:11:34,740
damaged by any of the frogs

282
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:38,339
um or any of the cold temperatures and

283
00:11:34,740 --> 00:11:40,440
so it's really important to have Labor

284
00:11:38,339 --> 00:11:43,920
um even if you were to have a you pick

285
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:46,320
operation and you didn't have a hired

286
00:11:43,920 --> 00:11:48,180
crew of people to pick your crops you

287
00:11:46,320 --> 00:11:51,060
still need to have enough people to lay

288
00:11:48,180 --> 00:11:52,260
this row row cover over your

289
00:11:51,060 --> 00:11:54,779
strawberries

290
00:11:52,260 --> 00:11:56,519
um and you're going to need access to

291
00:11:54,779 --> 00:11:59,160
that crew

292
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:01,079
um at really specific at really key time

293
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:03,480
so it's not something that's labor

294
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:05,700
intensive all the time but around

295
00:12:03,480 --> 00:12:08,880
January and February it's going to be

296
00:12:05,700 --> 00:12:10,200
really labor intensive at Key times and

297
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:13,500
it's going to be really important that

298
00:12:10,200 --> 00:12:16,620
you have enough labor to put that over

299
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:19,339
your crops in a timely manner

300
00:12:16,620 --> 00:12:19,339
foreign

301
00:12:20,000 --> 00:12:23,880
I can't skim over this when I'm talking

302
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:26,940
about strawberry production

303
00:12:23,880 --> 00:12:30,180
something that I've heard from Growers

304
00:12:26,940 --> 00:12:33,660
uh from colleagues is that you cannot

305
00:12:30,180 --> 00:12:35,579
spare fungicides that's something

306
00:12:33,660 --> 00:12:36,839
we really don't want you to skimp on

307
00:12:35,579 --> 00:12:38,880
anything

308
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:40,440
um you don't need to skimp on IPM or

309
00:12:38,880 --> 00:12:42,480
fungicides but I've been told that

310
00:12:40,440 --> 00:12:44,459
especially fungicides that something

311
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:46,800
that's really important in Strawberry

312
00:12:44,459 --> 00:12:49,740
production in keeping those berries and

313
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:51,420
keeping those plants healthy looking so

314
00:12:49,740 --> 00:12:54,240
it's something that's really crucial to

315
00:12:51,420 --> 00:12:57,120
the operation so chemical prices have

316
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:59,220
gone up over the past couple years

317
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,920
um just as some of these supply chain

318
00:12:59,220 --> 00:13:03,839
issues continue

319
00:13:01,920 --> 00:13:05,279
um and so a piece of advice I usually

320
00:13:03,839 --> 00:13:07,019
give Farmers if they're worried about

321
00:13:05,279 --> 00:13:08,820
the process some of their chemicals

322
00:13:07,019 --> 00:13:11,220
going up

323
00:13:08,820 --> 00:13:13,019
um or even sometimes of a certain

324
00:13:11,220 --> 00:13:15,300
chemical being available when they need

325
00:13:13,019 --> 00:13:17,100
it I just tell them to buy it when they

326
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:19,019
can even if it's

327
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:21,360
January and it's something that you

328
00:13:19,019 --> 00:13:22,620
don't need for four months if you see it

329
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:24,120
at the store and you know you're going

330
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:24,839
to use it

331
00:13:24,120 --> 00:13:26,579
um

332
00:13:24,839 --> 00:13:28,639
you know you're going to need it go

333
00:13:26,579 --> 00:13:32,459
ahead and buy it because

334
00:13:28,639 --> 00:13:33,660
you don't necessarily want to rely on

335
00:13:32,459 --> 00:13:35,579
this uh

336
00:13:33,660 --> 00:13:37,200
supply chain you know all these

337
00:13:35,579 --> 00:13:39,180
chemicals that are imported you don't

338
00:13:37,200 --> 00:13:40,620
want to have to rely on that

339
00:13:39,180 --> 00:13:42,360
um and then not be able to get something

340
00:13:40,620 --> 00:13:43,519
when you need it

341
00:13:42,360 --> 00:13:47,940
foreign

342
00:13:43,519 --> 00:13:49,139
and also so rotation of strawberries is

343
00:13:47,940 --> 00:13:50,160
important

344
00:13:49,139 --> 00:13:52,320
um it's something

345
00:13:50,160 --> 00:13:54,120
I know that not every Farm does this but

346
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:56,700
if sufficient land is available it's

347
00:13:54,120 --> 00:13:59,880
something that can really benefit you

348
00:13:56,700 --> 00:14:02,100
and so before going into a strawberry

349
00:13:59,880 --> 00:14:03,360
growing operation

350
00:14:02,100 --> 00:14:06,000
um this is really something that you

351
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:07,339
would like to have planned out a lot of

352
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:10,560
people

353
00:14:07,339 --> 00:14:12,420
they like to leave your land without

354
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:14,579
strawberries for a couple of years but

355
00:14:12,420 --> 00:14:17,160
some people just rotate every other year

356
00:14:14,579 --> 00:14:19,260
but just some kind of rotation is really

357
00:14:17,160 --> 00:14:21,420
beneficial to kind of relieves some of

358
00:14:19,260 --> 00:14:24,480
that disease pressure insect pressure

359
00:14:21,420 --> 00:14:26,180
and it can lead to better productivity I

360
00:14:24,480 --> 00:14:28,800
mean there are ways to

361
00:14:26,180 --> 00:14:31,139
still increase your productivity if you

362
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:34,820
can't rotate but it's just something

363
00:14:31,139 --> 00:14:34,820
that's generally encouraged

364
00:14:34,860 --> 00:14:41,579
and also plastic culture this is another

365
00:14:38,399 --> 00:14:43,800
part of strawberry production that is an

366
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:47,279
investment every year

367
00:14:43,800 --> 00:14:49,500
um so just the capital investment in the

368
00:14:47,279 --> 00:14:52,440
plastic mulch you know the labor

369
00:14:49,500 --> 00:14:53,940
investment of shaping the beds laying it

370
00:14:52,440 --> 00:14:56,339
down

371
00:14:53,940 --> 00:14:59,220
um that's something that's really it's

372
00:14:56,339 --> 00:15:01,139
really uh just gonna be a cost you need

373
00:14:59,220 --> 00:15:02,760
to be prepared for have it planned in

374
00:15:01,139 --> 00:15:04,079
your budget

375
00:15:02,760 --> 00:15:06,180
um

376
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,880
so I've got the prices for a couple of

377
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:10,760
years ago that may not help you now and

378
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:13,320
I know there's so many different places

379
00:15:10,760 --> 00:15:16,459
you can get plastic culture I've seen

380
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:19,380
some online I've seen some uh

381
00:15:16,459 --> 00:15:22,380
2400 foot rolls I think it was four foot

382
00:15:19,380 --> 00:15:24,420
wide for around 130 dollars that I've

383
00:15:22,380 --> 00:15:27,240
used in some other budgets when I'm

384
00:15:24,420 --> 00:15:28,320
including the price of uh of plastic

385
00:15:27,240 --> 00:15:31,199
mulch

386
00:15:28,320 --> 00:15:33,899
but also some farmers will plant another

387
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:36,060
crop into that plastic mold which after

388
00:15:33,899 --> 00:15:39,240
the strawberries to kind of just spread

389
00:15:36,060 --> 00:15:41,540
the cost of it onto another crop anytime

390
00:15:39,240 --> 00:15:43,680
you can do that it's just instead of

391
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:45,360
attributing the whole cost of this

392
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:47,820
plastic mulch for strawberries you can

393
00:15:45,360 --> 00:15:49,740
spread it over strawberries or onions

394
00:15:47,820 --> 00:15:52,100
strawberries and whatever the other crop

395
00:15:49,740 --> 00:15:55,079
may be and it just kind of spreads out

396
00:15:52,100 --> 00:15:56,940
that investment of something that it's

397
00:15:55,079 --> 00:15:58,320
not something that can be reused the

398
00:15:56,940 --> 00:16:01,279
next year is something that's just good

399
00:15:58,320 --> 00:16:01,279
for one year

400
00:16:01,380 --> 00:16:05,820
all right and so the cost of plants

401
00:16:04,139 --> 00:16:08,160
that's going to be

402
00:16:05,820 --> 00:16:10,260
your biggest investment I believe when

403
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:11,940
it comes to Strawberry production

404
00:16:10,260 --> 00:16:14,579
that's something

405
00:16:11,940 --> 00:16:17,040
um so I have a range on here listed I've

406
00:16:14,579 --> 00:16:19,260
I've seen them this year for around 45

407
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:23,100
to 50 cents a plan I've seen them lower

408
00:16:19,260 --> 00:16:25,079
than that seeing them around 30 cents 35

409
00:16:23,100 --> 00:16:25,980
cents per plant

410
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:28,139
um

411
00:16:25,980 --> 00:16:30,839
but that's really just to show that in

412
00:16:28,139 --> 00:16:32,459
the older budget from 2019 I think they

413
00:16:30,839 --> 00:16:36,000
were selling for

414
00:16:32,459 --> 00:16:38,639
I think it was 24 or 23 cents per plant

415
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:41,160
and just to show that in some places the

416
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:42,839
price of plants have doubled

417
00:16:41,160 --> 00:16:46,139
um and these are something that's

418
00:16:42,839 --> 00:16:48,779
typically purchased locally if you want

419
00:16:46,139 --> 00:16:51,540
to get organic plugs that usually is

420
00:16:48,779 --> 00:16:54,000
done they usually have to be brought in

421
00:16:51,540 --> 00:16:56,339
from somewhere outside of Alabama

422
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:58,079
and so you're going to be planting I did

423
00:16:56,339 --> 00:17:00,860
a little math on here not to scare

424
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:04,980
anyone but so if you're planting around

425
00:17:00,860 --> 00:17:08,040
1400 plugs per acre I mean 14 000 plugs

426
00:17:04,980 --> 00:17:10,260
per acre and say they're 50 cents each

427
00:17:08,040 --> 00:17:12,839
you're spending around seven thousand

428
00:17:10,260 --> 00:17:13,919
dollars just on your plants

429
00:17:12,839 --> 00:17:17,640
um

430
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:19,860
that is just a huge investment in terms

431
00:17:17,640 --> 00:17:22,140
of money spent on Plants I can't think

432
00:17:19,860 --> 00:17:23,220
of a whole lot of other uh fruit and

433
00:17:22,140 --> 00:17:26,100
vegetable production where you're

434
00:17:23,220 --> 00:17:29,460
spending that kind of money on just the

435
00:17:26,100 --> 00:17:31,320
plant itself just you know the plug

436
00:17:29,460 --> 00:17:33,120
um so it's really it's a major

437
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:35,880
investment

438
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:37,380
um that you really need to I say to plan

439
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:39,299
around it but this would kind of be the

440
00:17:37,380 --> 00:17:40,919
basis of your plan

441
00:17:39,299 --> 00:17:43,620
um and you would need to plan everything

442
00:17:40,919 --> 00:17:45,240
else around this to make sure that

443
00:17:43,620 --> 00:17:47,820
you're managing everything as well as

444
00:17:45,240 --> 00:17:51,320
you can to take care of these plants

445
00:17:47,820 --> 00:17:51,320
that are your major investment

446
00:17:51,480 --> 00:17:58,620
and so another thing that is a really a

447
00:17:55,980 --> 00:18:01,940
really big cost in Strawberry production

448
00:17:58,620 --> 00:18:04,520
would be labor so

449
00:18:01,940 --> 00:18:09,660
nobody's denying that strawberry

450
00:18:04,520 --> 00:18:12,179
strawberry production is a really uh

451
00:18:09,660 --> 00:18:14,760
it's a it's a crop that Demands a lot of

452
00:18:12,179 --> 00:18:17,340
investment initial investment so we

453
00:18:14,760 --> 00:18:19,320
covered the investment of

454
00:18:17,340 --> 00:18:20,700
the plants and you know and then

455
00:18:19,320 --> 00:18:23,820
everything else that goes along with

456
00:18:20,700 --> 00:18:26,299
that production system but also you have

457
00:18:23,820 --> 00:18:29,100
a lot of labor involved in

458
00:18:26,299 --> 00:18:32,039
pre-harvest and can have a lot of Labor

459
00:18:29,100 --> 00:18:33,120
in the post-harvest section of your farm

460
00:18:32,039 --> 00:18:35,160
so

461
00:18:33,120 --> 00:18:36,980
pre-harvest you're going to have you

462
00:18:35,160 --> 00:18:39,179
know land prep like you do with anything

463
00:18:36,980 --> 00:18:40,440
planting is going to be pretty labor

464
00:18:39,179 --> 00:18:42,900
intensive because you have to have

465
00:18:40,440 --> 00:18:45,240
someone personally putting each plug

466
00:18:42,900 --> 00:18:46,620
into those holes I I guess you could

467
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:48,480
have a planter but it's typically done

468
00:18:46,620 --> 00:18:51,140
by hand

469
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:53,580
um scouting spraying other management

470
00:18:51,140 --> 00:18:55,740
involved so

471
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:58,980
irrigation would fall under that

472
00:18:55,740 --> 00:19:01,140
Scouting For pests Scouting For diseases

473
00:18:58,980 --> 00:19:02,700
um just anything involved in the

474
00:19:01,140 --> 00:19:04,679
management that's going to be a lot of

475
00:19:02,700 --> 00:19:08,280
labor involved and then also like I

476
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:11,760
mentioned previously Frost protection so

477
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:13,919
having you're just having those periods

478
00:19:11,760 --> 00:19:17,820
of time where you have to get a crew of

479
00:19:13,919 --> 00:19:21,000
people to roll out these row covers and

480
00:19:17,820 --> 00:19:22,980
put sandbags or put anything down you

481
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,780
know to hold it in place

482
00:19:22,980 --> 00:19:26,280
there's going to be a good bit of Labor

483
00:19:24,780 --> 00:19:28,020
in that and I mean that can change year

484
00:19:26,280 --> 00:19:30,720
to year depending on how many freezes

485
00:19:28,020 --> 00:19:33,120
you have I mean how many you have late

486
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:36,179
into the year that could really damage

487
00:19:33,120 --> 00:19:38,820
your uh your plants but that's just it

488
00:19:36,179 --> 00:19:40,980
it's labor it can't be overlooked that

489
00:19:38,820 --> 00:19:42,900
you're gonna need to have Labor

490
00:19:40,980 --> 00:19:47,820
accounted for you know all of these

491
00:19:42,900 --> 00:19:51,059
tasks and post Harvest you can or you

492
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:53,160
cannot have a lot of uh labor yourself

493
00:19:51,059 --> 00:19:55,080
in the operation so

494
00:19:53,160 --> 00:19:56,700
like in the budget I mentioned at the

495
00:19:55,080 --> 00:19:59,520
beginning of this presentation they

496
00:19:56,700 --> 00:20:01,799
accounted for Harvest labor

497
00:19:59,520 --> 00:20:04,799
um and I think they accounted for it was

498
00:20:01,799 --> 00:20:08,039
about 30 hours a week harvesting

499
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:09,780
uh yeah 30 hours per week in the months

500
00:20:08,039 --> 00:20:12,840
of April and May

501
00:20:09,780 --> 00:20:16,500
and so that can kind of be gone around

502
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:18,419
if you were to have a U-Pick operation

503
00:20:16,500 --> 00:20:20,280
um it can't go around it completely

504
00:20:18,419 --> 00:20:22,860
because even with the U-Pick operation

505
00:20:20,280 --> 00:20:25,080
you're going to need a

506
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:26,460
you're gonna want to have some of them

507
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:29,580
picked

508
00:20:26,460 --> 00:20:31,559
um or at least gleaned after by some of

509
00:20:29,580 --> 00:20:33,660
the people on your farm a lot of you

510
00:20:31,559 --> 00:20:36,240
pick operations will offer you pick and

511
00:20:33,660 --> 00:20:39,480
then also some pre-picked buckets

512
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:41,520
um so it's not like you can depend just

513
00:20:39,480 --> 00:20:44,460
on consumers to come out there and pick

514
00:20:41,520 --> 00:20:46,919
the berries for themselves but that can

515
00:20:44,460 --> 00:20:49,200
decrease that can take away so much of

516
00:20:46,919 --> 00:20:50,700
the labor that you need

517
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:52,440
um if you were to have a you pick

518
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:54,480
operation and that can actually I mean

519
00:20:52,440 --> 00:20:56,700
that can save you money

520
00:20:54,480 --> 00:20:58,500
um you know save you from hiring more

521
00:20:56,700 --> 00:21:00,559
people to harvest all those berries

522
00:20:58,500 --> 00:21:03,539
because you know they're time sensitive

523
00:21:00,559 --> 00:21:04,860
dairies don't have a super long shelf

524
00:21:03,539 --> 00:21:07,320
life it's something they need to be

525
00:21:04,860 --> 00:21:09,539
peaked when they need to be peaked

526
00:21:07,320 --> 00:21:11,280
um and it's a lot of intense production

527
00:21:09,539 --> 00:21:13,080
in April and May

528
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:14,700
and so you know having a you pick

529
00:21:13,080 --> 00:21:17,820
operation just can save you a lot of

530
00:21:14,700 --> 00:21:19,919
money on hiring a uh you know a

531
00:21:17,820 --> 00:21:22,320
harvesting crew but you're still going

532
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:24,780
to need some labor to glean you know to

533
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:26,940
offer some pre-picked buckets most

534
00:21:24,780 --> 00:21:29,220
likely and then to clean up afterwards

535
00:21:26,940 --> 00:21:30,720
that's just something that can be

536
00:21:29,220 --> 00:21:33,840
avoided

537
00:21:30,720 --> 00:21:37,020
and so this next slide I took a little

538
00:21:33,840 --> 00:21:38,179
inspiration from Chip East

539
00:21:37,020 --> 00:21:40,020
um

540
00:21:38,179 --> 00:21:42,299
Chip's always talking about people

541
00:21:40,020 --> 00:21:44,760
Farmers getting the retail dollar and

542
00:21:42,299 --> 00:21:46,740
that's really that's how you can get the

543
00:21:44,760 --> 00:21:50,159
most bang for your book as a strawberry

544
00:21:46,740 --> 00:21:52,320
producer so the retail prices are going

545
00:21:50,159 --> 00:21:54,360
to be higher than processed or wholesale

546
00:21:52,320 --> 00:21:57,480
prices that's kind of a given that's

547
00:21:54,360 --> 00:21:58,679
that's uh usually the case in a lot and

548
00:21:57,480 --> 00:22:00,900
a lot of fruits you know if you're

549
00:21:58,679 --> 00:22:03,179
selling direct to a consumer you can

550
00:22:00,900 --> 00:22:04,919
charge a higher price

551
00:22:03,179 --> 00:22:06,600
um

552
00:22:04,919 --> 00:22:09,419
and

553
00:22:06,600 --> 00:22:11,400
they can also be used for value-added

554
00:22:09,419 --> 00:22:13,980
products if you were to have some that

555
00:22:11,400 --> 00:22:15,360
didn't sell which I don't often hear I

556
00:22:13,980 --> 00:22:16,500
hear about a lot of strawberry Farmers

557
00:22:15,360 --> 00:22:17,700
selling out

558
00:22:16,500 --> 00:22:19,919
um or at least that's how it's been the

559
00:22:17,700 --> 00:22:21,480
past couple weeks but if you had some or

560
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:23,400
if you just wanted to use some for a

561
00:22:21,480 --> 00:22:24,780
value-added product to sell later in the

562
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:27,000
year

563
00:22:24,780 --> 00:22:28,440
um or to sell you know alongside your

564
00:22:27,000 --> 00:22:30,600
fresh strawberries that's something they

565
00:22:28,440 --> 00:22:32,460
could be used for and like I mentioned

566
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,559
before

567
00:22:32,460 --> 00:22:36,419
um a U-Pick operation that can save on

568
00:22:34,559 --> 00:22:37,919
harvest labor and it can also save on

569
00:22:36,419 --> 00:22:39,799
marketing costs because if you were to

570
00:22:37,919 --> 00:22:42,960
have a you pick operation

571
00:22:39,799 --> 00:22:45,179
consumers are driving to your farm

572
00:22:42,960 --> 00:22:47,460
they're picking the berries they're

573
00:22:45,179 --> 00:22:49,140
paying for that gallon bucket however

574
00:22:47,460 --> 00:22:50,640
much of strawberries and then they're

575
00:22:49,140 --> 00:22:52,919
leaving

576
00:22:50,640 --> 00:22:55,140
um and while you have you know

577
00:22:52,919 --> 00:22:56,640
something extra for that would be you

578
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:58,380
know you have extra people on your farm

579
00:22:56,640 --> 00:23:00,659
that you wouldn't normally have but

580
00:22:58,380 --> 00:23:03,179
you're also from the farmer's point of

581
00:23:00,659 --> 00:23:04,260
view you're not having to go out

582
00:23:03,179 --> 00:23:06,539
um

583
00:23:04,260 --> 00:23:08,280
and drive to a farmer's market you're

584
00:23:06,539 --> 00:23:10,440
not having to drive to a store and

585
00:23:08,280 --> 00:23:11,760
deliver your berries

586
00:23:10,440 --> 00:23:13,380
um you're not really having to go much

587
00:23:11,760 --> 00:23:15,480
of anywhere I mean you're still probably

588
00:23:13,380 --> 00:23:18,539
going to spend some money on signs maybe

589
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:20,760
some advertisements but it you could

590
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:22,140
save a lot on marketing costs as well as

591
00:23:20,760 --> 00:23:23,940
harvest labor so that's just something

592
00:23:22,140 --> 00:23:25,980
to consider

593
00:23:23,940 --> 00:23:28,860
um especially if you if you want to have

594
00:23:25,980 --> 00:23:31,740
a strawberry operation

595
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:34,500
um and you know you know that you can't

596
00:23:31,740 --> 00:23:36,299
uh you don't have access to as much

597
00:23:34,500 --> 00:23:38,700
labor as you would need to harvest them

598
00:23:36,299 --> 00:23:40,740
all that's just a direction you could

599
00:23:38,700 --> 00:23:43,740
turn your operation in

600
00:23:40,740 --> 00:23:45,480
um and save money on a couple of things

601
00:23:43,740 --> 00:23:47,760
and so I'm going to skip the next slide

602
00:23:45,480 --> 00:23:50,159
just because I'm a little short on time

603
00:23:47,760 --> 00:23:52,500
and I wanted to talk about how you can

604
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:54,600
budget for your farm

605
00:23:52,500 --> 00:23:55,320
and so

606
00:23:54,600 --> 00:23:57,120
um

607
00:23:55,320 --> 00:23:59,580
this screenshot that I have up here

608
00:23:57,120 --> 00:24:02,520
right now that's how most of our

609
00:23:59,580 --> 00:24:04,260
Horticultural budgets typically look

610
00:24:02,520 --> 00:24:06,720
um the ones that we've gone through and

611
00:24:04,260 --> 00:24:09,480
redone they all look like this and this

612
00:24:06,720 --> 00:24:11,220
isn't all of it I just took a grab of

613
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:12,960
you know the top half of it so that you

614
00:24:11,220 --> 00:24:15,299
can see how it's laid out

615
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:16,919
that you have receipts at the top you

616
00:24:15,299 --> 00:24:18,419
have all your variable costs and then

617
00:24:16,919 --> 00:24:20,340
below this you would have your fixed

618
00:24:18,419 --> 00:24:23,340
cost listed

619
00:24:20,340 --> 00:24:25,980
and so uh we should have a strawberry

620
00:24:23,340 --> 00:24:28,320
budget out like this uh in a couple

621
00:24:25,980 --> 00:24:29,580
months or so but

622
00:24:28,320 --> 00:24:31,320
um

623
00:24:29,580 --> 00:24:33,960
it's something if you were to already

624
00:24:31,320 --> 00:24:36,659
have an operation you wouldn't even

625
00:24:33,960 --> 00:24:38,760
necessarily have to have this to keep

626
00:24:36,659 --> 00:24:41,280
track or to keep a budget for your farm

627
00:24:38,760 --> 00:24:44,580
you could keep track of it in a similar

628
00:24:41,280 --> 00:24:46,620
manner on uh you know on your farm

629
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:49,620
computer and so this one is set up

630
00:24:46,620 --> 00:24:51,299
because uh the two columns in blue you

631
00:24:49,620 --> 00:24:54,059
can change you can change the numbers

632
00:24:51,299 --> 00:24:57,120
change quantity the cost per unit of

633
00:24:54,059 --> 00:25:00,059
certain items and then get a different

634
00:24:57,120 --> 00:25:02,940
cost per acre but if you were to do this

635
00:25:00,059 --> 00:25:05,460
on your own Farm you could keep track of

636
00:25:02,940 --> 00:25:07,559
so I would start out I would keep track

637
00:25:05,460 --> 00:25:08,880
of the strawberries you sell either you

638
00:25:07,559 --> 00:25:11,340
pick

639
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:13,500
um it would be helpful to keep track of

640
00:25:11,340 --> 00:25:15,059
how many you sell that are actually you

641
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,919
pick and how many you sell that are

642
00:25:15,059 --> 00:25:19,440
pre-picked buckets that way you know you

643
00:25:16,919 --> 00:25:20,880
can just keep an eye on how consumers

644
00:25:19,440 --> 00:25:23,280
are buying

645
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:24,960
um and then you can list all of your own

646
00:25:23,280 --> 00:25:27,299
costs under this

647
00:25:24,960 --> 00:25:29,279
um but something like this these budgets

648
00:25:27,299 --> 00:25:32,279
that we provide online they provide you

649
00:25:29,279 --> 00:25:35,100
a good list of your variable cost and

650
00:25:32,279 --> 00:25:36,840
what you should be keeping track of some

651
00:25:35,100 --> 00:25:39,000
of them are even listed at zero they're

652
00:25:36,840 --> 00:25:41,940
listed on there just so you can go

653
00:25:39,000 --> 00:25:43,740
through yourself and say like a land

654
00:25:41,940 --> 00:25:45,900
rent if you're not renting a land then

655
00:25:43,740 --> 00:25:48,059
you could just leave that zero across

656
00:25:45,900 --> 00:25:49,500
that whole line but if you are renting

657
00:25:48,059 --> 00:25:51,960
the land that's where you would need to

658
00:25:49,500 --> 00:25:54,960
input that cost

659
00:25:51,960 --> 00:25:58,799
but it's really helpful just to provide

660
00:25:54,960 --> 00:26:01,500
a list of what you need to create a

661
00:25:58,799 --> 00:26:03,419
budget but you can do this yourself for

662
00:26:01,500 --> 00:26:05,400
your own Farm by keeping track of just

663
00:26:03,419 --> 00:26:08,460
how much you spend on soil tests your

664
00:26:05,400 --> 00:26:10,980
plants uh you know any other tests you

665
00:26:08,460 --> 00:26:13,020
may do like a soil uh like a tissue

666
00:26:10,980 --> 00:26:15,480
analysis and then how much you spend on

667
00:26:13,020 --> 00:26:17,279
fertilizer lime

668
00:26:15,480 --> 00:26:18,779
um especially if someone if you were to

669
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:20,580
keep track of it this year you can look

670
00:26:18,779 --> 00:26:22,440
at it next year see if things have gone

671
00:26:20,580 --> 00:26:23,400
up or if they've gone back down or if

672
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,679
things have

673
00:26:23,400 --> 00:26:27,360
have gotten even crazier but it's just

674
00:26:25,679 --> 00:26:28,980
it's really good to keep track of these

675
00:26:27,360 --> 00:26:30,720
kind of things you can look at them year

676
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:31,740
after year

677
00:26:30,720 --> 00:26:33,779
um

678
00:26:31,740 --> 00:26:36,240
really the Enterprise budget is really

679
00:26:33,779 --> 00:26:37,740
beneficial for someone planning the one

680
00:26:36,240 --> 00:26:40,440
that we have online is really good for

681
00:26:37,740 --> 00:26:43,320
someone planning to get into strawberry

682
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,080
production but if you already have a

683
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:47,760
farm if you started and then a couple

684
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:50,220
years into it it's really going to help

685
00:26:47,760 --> 00:26:52,440
you to keep this budget to keep this

686
00:26:50,220 --> 00:26:55,140
type of budget for your own operation

687
00:26:52,440 --> 00:26:57,480
the numbers that we put in it are all

688
00:26:55,140 --> 00:26:58,860
estimates because every Farm is

689
00:26:57,480 --> 00:27:02,159
different every Farmer's different

690
00:26:58,860 --> 00:27:04,320
everyone has different assets different

691
00:27:02,159 --> 00:27:07,020
strengths

692
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:09,900
um and just different costs you know

693
00:27:07,020 --> 00:27:12,179
some farmer may may need a ton of

694
00:27:09,900 --> 00:27:14,940
fertilizer may need to amend their soil

695
00:27:12,179 --> 00:27:17,100
so much say it's been uh

696
00:27:14,940 --> 00:27:18,539
it's it's been empty for a few years and

697
00:27:17,100 --> 00:27:20,279
they're having you know completely

698
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:22,620
amended from scratch and to say someone

699
00:27:20,279 --> 00:27:25,380
has lended they have taken care of and

700
00:27:22,620 --> 00:27:27,299
amended for five or ten years

701
00:27:25,380 --> 00:27:29,640
um you know your costs are just going to

702
00:27:27,299 --> 00:27:31,919
be different based on your land the

703
00:27:29,640 --> 00:27:34,200
farmer himself you know and his

704
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:36,480
management practices and how he wants to

705
00:27:34,200 --> 00:27:38,760
go about things

706
00:27:36,480 --> 00:27:39,840
um but keeping track of those things can

707
00:27:38,760 --> 00:27:42,840
really

708
00:27:39,840 --> 00:27:45,000
help you budget for the next year and

709
00:27:42,840 --> 00:27:46,380
that's essentially uh what you want to

710
00:27:45,000 --> 00:27:49,140
do you want to keep track of your

711
00:27:46,380 --> 00:27:51,960
expenses year after year and then use

712
00:27:49,140 --> 00:27:54,000
them when you're planning for the next

713
00:27:51,960 --> 00:27:55,860
year

714
00:27:54,000 --> 00:28:00,120
um it really it can help you notice

715
00:27:55,860 --> 00:28:01,679
changes year to year noticing Trends and

716
00:28:00,120 --> 00:28:03,720
it helps you better plan out your

717
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:05,279
expenses for the following year and

718
00:28:03,720 --> 00:28:08,039
that's that's what we all want we all

719
00:28:05,279 --> 00:28:09,419
want to have a better idea of what we're

720
00:28:08,039 --> 00:28:13,440
going to spend so we can have a better

721
00:28:09,419 --> 00:28:15,360
idea of what we can earn from it

722
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:17,340
all right that's that's the end of my

723
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:19,020
presentation I hope I didn't

724
00:28:17,340 --> 00:28:20,640
go too long

725
00:28:19,020 --> 00:28:22,620
um but I have my contact information
