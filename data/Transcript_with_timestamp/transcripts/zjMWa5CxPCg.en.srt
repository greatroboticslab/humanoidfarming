aware of how each breed affects their

58
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:10,039

designed these traditional CS are often

72
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:41,760
made from solid wood built to last for

73
00:02:39,239 --> 00:02:44,120
years proper ventilation is a critical

74
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:46,120
feature ensuring that the air inside

75
00:02:44,120 --> 00:02:48,840
stays fresh and comfortable for the

76
00:02:46,120 --> 00:02:51,120
birds after all no one wants to live in

77
00:02:48,840 --> 00:02:53,879
a stifling space just ask anyone who

78
00:02:51,120 --> 00:02:56,120
spent a summer in an unventilated room

79
00:02:53,879 --> 00:02:58,720
space is another crucial consideration

80
00:02:56,120 --> 00:03:01,080
in Amish chicken coups chickens need

81
00:02:58,720 --> 00:03:03,400
room to move scratch the ground and

82
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:05,560
stretch their wings imagine being

83
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:07,519
crammed into a tiny space with no room

84
00:03:05,560 --> 00:03:09,640
to maneuver is hardly a recipe for a

85
00:03:07,519 --> 00:03:11,400
happy life a well-designed co-op

86
00:03:09,640 --> 00:03:13,319

relax and Thrive happier chickens after

89
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:22,040
all mean better eggs sustainability is a

90
00:03:19,680 --> 00:03:24,440
guiding principle in Amish farming and

91
00:03:22,040 --> 00:03:26,720
this extends to how they build their CPS

92
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,159
often they use reclaimed materials like

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:32,040
old Barnwood or wooden pallets giving

94
00:03:29,159 --> 00:03:34,200
each Cooper rustic eco-friendly charm

95
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,120
these upcycled coups not only reduce

96
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:38,040
waste but also reflect the Amish

97
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:40,480
commitment to living in harmony with the

98
00:03:38,040 --> 00:03:42,120
environment Beyond Aesthetics the coups

99
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:44,200
are designed to protect the chickens

100
00:03:42,120 --> 00:03:46,480
from predators such as foxes and

101
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:49,000
raccoons additional features like

102
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:50,959
nesting boxes lined with soft bedding

103
00:03:49,000 --> 00:03:53,120
ensure that the hens have a cozy and

104
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:55,439
comfortable place to lay their eggs who

105
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:57,640
wouldn't want a plush comfy spot for

106
00:03:55,439 --> 00:04:00,560
such an important task cleanliness is

107
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:02,560
another top priority for Amish farmers

108
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:05,319
their coups often include removable

109
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:07,280
floors or trays making it easy to clean

110
00:04:05,319 --> 00:04:09,599

00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:11,599
the chickens a clean Coupe keeps pests

112
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,760
at Bay and ensures that the birds remain

113
00:04:11,599 --> 00:04:16,040

feed these farmers use grains kitchen

117
00:04:20,880 --> 00:04:25,720
scraps and whatever the chickens can

118
00:04:23,160 --> 00:04:27,759
forage from the land it's like a daily

119
00:04:25,720 --> 00:04:31,080
buffet for the birds offering them a

120
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:33,400
variety of nutrients grains such as corn

121
00:04:31,080 --> 00:04:35,840
wheat and oats form the foundation of

122
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:38,240
their diet providing the protein and

123
00:04:35,840 --> 00:04:40,039
energy that chickens need to thrive food

124
00:04:38,240 --> 00:04:42,840
scraps are also a key part of their

125
00:04:40,039 --> 00:04:44,720
feeding system leftovers from family

126
00:04:42,840 --> 00:04:47,000
meals often become the chicken's next

127
00:04:44,720 --> 00:04:48,759
Feast turning what might otherwise go to

128
00:04:47,000 --> 00:04:51,000
waste into a nutritious streat for the

129
00:04:48,759 --> 00:04:52,720
flock growing up it was always

130
00:04:51,000 --> 00:04:55,039
fascinating to see how these birds

131
00:04:52,720 --> 00:04:57,199
transformed kitchen scraps into Rich

132
00:04:55,039 --> 00:04:58,560
flavorful eggs and meat a true Testament

133
00:04:57,199 --> 00:05:01,000
to the Amish commitment to

134
00:04:58,560 --> 00:05:03,360
sustainability and resourcefulness

135
00:05:01,000 --> 00:05:06,199
kitchen scraps such as vegetable peels

136
00:05:03,360 --> 00:05:09,280
stale bread and even leftover pasta find

137
00:05:06,199 --> 00:05:10,880
a second life in the chicken yard there

138
00:05:09,280 --> 00:05:13,720
the chickens eagerly Peck at the

139
00:05:10,880 --> 00:05:15,759
offerings as if they were Gourmet chefs

140
00:05:13,720 --> 00:05:18,039
however one thing to avoid feeding them

141
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:20,319
is chocolate while chickens can consume

142
00:05:18,039 --> 00:05:22,960
a wide range of foods chocolate is

143
00:05:20,319 --> 00:05:24,960
extremely toxic to them just as it is to

144
00:05:22,960 --> 00:05:27,280
humans and could lead to severe health

145
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:29,840
issues for the flock here's something

146
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:31,720
even more fascinating Amish chickens are

147
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:34,319
allowed to roam freely to forage for

148
00:05:31,720 --> 00:05:36,520
food this means they hunt for bugs grass

149
00:05:34,319 --> 00:05:38,759
weeds and anything else they can uncover

150
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:40,680
with their feet or snag with their beaks

151
00:05:38,759 --> 00:05:42,560
not only does this natural foraging

152
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:44,919
Behavior Keep the chickens active and

153
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:47,199
entertained but it also provides them

154
00:05:44,919 --> 00:05:49,759
with high quality protein and essential

155
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:51,560
vitamins interestingly this diet

156
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,400
benefits more than just the chickens it

157
00:05:51,560 --> 00:05:56,080
has a significant impact on their eggs

158
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:57,680
as well a diverse diet results in eggs

159
00:05:56,080 --> 00:06:00,120
that are richer in flavor and have

160
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:02,400
vibrant yolks that's why eggs from Freer

161
00:06:00,120 --> 00:06:04,280
ranging foraging chicken stand out in

162
00:06:02,400 --> 00:06:06,360
taste and quality compared to those

163
00:06:04,280 --> 00:06:08,960
you'd find in a typical store for the

164
00:06:06,360 --> 00:06:11,560
Amish egg production is both a practical

165
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:13,560
science and a cherished tradition just

166
00:06:11,560 --> 00:06:15,599
like other living creatures chickens

167
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:17,479
Thrive when their needs are met and

168
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,160
light plays a crucial role in their egg

169
00:06:17,479 --> 00:06:22,840
laying process hens rely on a consistent

170
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,560
light cycle to regulate their laying by

171
00:06:22,840 --> 00:06:26,759
mimicking the natural patterns of

172
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:28,599
daylight Amish farmers signal to the

173
00:06:26,759 --> 00:06:31,039
hen's bodies when it's time to start

174
00:06:28,599 --> 00:06:33,319
producing eggs Amish coups are carefully

175
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:35,800
designed to let in ample natural light

176
00:06:33,319 --> 00:06:37,639
even during the shorter days of winter

177
00:06:35,800 --> 00:06:40,199
this attention to detail ensures a

178
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,960
consistent eggs Supply year round did

179
00:06:40,199 --> 00:06:44,280
you know a single healthy hen can lay

180
00:06:41,960 --> 00:06:46,039
about 300 eggs annually that means

181
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:48,039
owning just three hens could provide

182
00:06:46,039 --> 00:06:50,960
nearly 1,000 eggs a year plenty for

183
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:53,880
family meals baking projects and special

184
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:55,479
treats as a child I remember how our

185
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:57,560
household always seemed to have more

186
00:06:55,479 --> 00:07:00,160
eggs than we knew what to do with my

187
00:06:57,560 --> 00:07:03,080
mother would bake cakes prepare custard

188
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:06,039
and on special occasions whip up deviled

eggs that were gone in seconds Amish egg

00:07:06,039 --> 00:07:10,599
production isn't just for personal

191
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,680
consumption though eggs are also a vital

192
00:07:10,599 --> 00:07:14,319
part of their local economy eggs from

193
00:07:12,680 --> 00:07:16,479
Amish farms are prized for their

194
00:07:14,319 --> 00:07:18,639
exceptional freshness they are often

195
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:21,520
sold or Bartered within the community or

196
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,440
at local markets my grandfather used to

197
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:25,879
joke that eggs were as good as cacy

198
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:28,080
among the Amish and in some ways he

199
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:30,479
wasn't wrong there's something uniquely

200
00:07:28,080 --> 00:07:33,160
satisfying about buying egg at a market

201
00:07:30,479 --> 00:07:35,360
knowing they were laid just ours earlier

202
00:07:33,160 --> 00:07:38,280
however producing such highquality eggs

203
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:40,479
isn't just left to chance Alish farmers

204
00:07:38,280 --> 00:07:42,759
pay close attention to their hens laying

205
00:07:40,479 --> 00:07:44,800
Cycles coups are strategically

206
00:07:42,759 --> 00:07:47,280
positioned to capture as much natural

207
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:50,000
light as possible even in the depths of

208
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:51,639
winter Stress Management is another key

209
00:07:50,000 --> 00:07:54,120
factor since a stressed hen won't lay

210
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:56,560
eggs consistently in Amish farms the

211
00:07:54,120 --> 00:07:58,800
hens live in calm and quiet environments

212
00:07:56,560 --> 00:08:00,680
without the noise of heavy machinery

213
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,960
some farmers even swear by playing

214
00:08:00,680 --> 00:08:05,240
soothing classical music in the coups

215
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:06,879
claiming it helps the hens lay Mor eggs

216
00:08:05,240 --> 00:08:08,800
whether or not that's scientifically

217
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:11,280
proven the eggs from those hens are

218
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:14,000
always exceptional the hen diet is

219
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:16,440
another crucial element a varied diet of

220
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:18,319
grains insects and kitchen scraps

221
00:08:16,440 --> 00:08:20,560
ensures that the eggs are rich and

222
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:22,960
flavorful even the yolks take on a deep

223
00:08:20,560 --> 00:08:25,479
orange Hue a sign of freshness and

224
00:08:22,960 --> 00:08:27,319
quality my grandfather used to say you

225
00:08:25,479 --> 00:08:30,440
could tell how happy a hen was by the

226
00:08:27,319 --> 00:08:32,399
quality of her eggs and he wasn't wrong

227
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:34,560
there's a noticeable difference in both

228
00:08:32,399 --> 00:08:36,200
taste and appearance although it might

229
00:08:34,560 --> 00:08:38,159
look like the hens are laying eggs at

230
00:08:36,200 --> 00:08:40,080
their Leisure a lot of effort goes on

231
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:42,279
behind the scenes to maintain consistent

232
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:44,399
egg production from managing natural

233
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:46,440
light and diet to creating stress-free

perfected The Art of Keeping their hands

236
00:08:48,320 --> 00:08:52,360
in optimal shape for laying when you

237
00:08:50,519 --> 00:08:54,480
think about how many eggs these methods

238
00:08:52,360 --> 00:08:56,279
yield it's no surprised that Amish

239
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:58,320

355
00:13:15,240 --> 00:13:19,800
an Amish farm in the winter you'd see

356
00:13:17,360 --> 00:13:21,920
how nothing goes to waste even chicken

357
00:13:19,800 --> 00:13:24,320
manure is put to good use as fertilizer

358
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:26,720

every aspect of their farming practices

361
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:34,160
so how did the chickens remain content

362
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:36,199
despite the seasonal shifts the secret

363
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:39,120
lies in keeping things as natural and

364
00:13:36,199 --> 00:13:41,880
stress-free as possible when animals are

365
00:13:39,120 --> 00:13:44,079
treated with care they grow better and

366
00:13:41,880 --> 00:13:46,560
for chickens that means their meat

367
00:13:44,079 --> 00:13:48,440
tastes better too the Amish philosophy

368
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:50,560
ensures their chickens enjoy the best

summer winter or anywhere in between the

371
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,279
key to the Amish method is balance

372
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:59,399
allowing the birds plenty of room for

373
00:13:57,279 --> 00:14:01,240

376
00:14:03,839 --> 00:14:08,120
never hurried or confined to cramped

377
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:10,120
spaces and this makes all the difference

378
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:12,000
in the quality of life for the chickens

379
00:14:10,120 --> 00:14:14,240
and the flavor of their meat my

380
00:14:12,000 --> 00:14:16,720
grandfather always said a Happy Chicken

381
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:19,240
makes for a Happy Meal and after tasting

382
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:21,399
Amish raised chickens I can confidently

383
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:23,519
say he was right one of the most

384
00:14:21,399 --> 00:14:25,440
remarkable aspects of Amish chicken

385
00:14:23,519 --> 00:14:27,639
farming is its strong foundation in

386
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:29,240
Tradition the methods they use today

387
00:14:27,639 --> 00:14:31,360
have been handed down through gener

388
00:14:29,240 --> 00:14:33,480
ations and are still as effective as

389
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:35,160
they were a hundred years ago these

390
00:14:33,480 --> 00:14:37,240
practices have endured because they

391
00:14:35,160 --> 00:14:39,079
align with nature rather than working

392
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:41,360
against it providing chickens with

393
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:43,880
active fulfilling lives before they are

394
00:14:41,360 --> 00:14:45,959
part of a family meal unlike Supermarket

395
00:14:43,880 --> 00:14:48,480
bought Birds these chickens are raised

396
00:14:45,959 --> 00:14:51,320
with compassion and sustainability which

397
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:53,240
results in healthier better tasting meat

398
00:14:51,320 --> 00:14:55,240
but perhaps the most heartwarming part

399
00:14:53,240 --> 00:14:57,040
of Amish chicken farming isn't just

400
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:59,360
their Care for Animals sit their care

401
00:14:57,040 --> 00:15:01,000
for one another Amish farms oper operate

402
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:02,560
as a community effort where

403
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:04,959
collaboration is at the heart of

404
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:07,560
everything they do from construction to

405
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:09,720
sharing feed Amish farmers rely on their

406
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:11,560
neighbors in a way that exemplifies the

407
00:15:09,720 --> 00:15:13,480
power of teamwork this sense of

408
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:15,639
community extends even to chicken

409
00:15:13,480 --> 00:15:18,399
processing which is a collective event

410
00:15:15,639 --> 00:15:20,079
rather than a factory operation Amish

411
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,279
families often gather for chicken

412
00:15:20,079 --> 00:15:24,519
processing days where Neighbors come

413
00:15:22,279 --> 00:15:26,920
together to help it's akin to a barn

414
00:15:24,519 --> 00:15:29,000
raising but this time with feathers

415
00:15:26,920 --> 00:15:30,920
picture a large open area filled with

416
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:33,720
tables neighbors arriving with their

417
00:15:30,920 --> 00:15:36,399
chickens and a day full of work and

418
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:37,959
camaraderie it's not all about Labor

419
00:15:36,399 --> 00:15:39,920
though it's also a time for sharing

420
00:15:37,959 --> 00:15:42,079
laughter stories and plenty of

421
00:15:39,920 --> 00:15:43,959
light-hearted chicken related humor the

422
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:46,639
classic why did the chicken cross the

423
00:15:43,959 --> 00:15:48,480
road might be overused elsewhere but it

424
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:51,560
never fails to bring a laugh among the

425
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:53,560
Amish community neighbors begin arriving

426
00:15:51,560 --> 00:15:56,120
each bringing their chickens in toe

427
00:15:53,560 --> 00:15:58,079
ready for a productive day ahead while

428
00:15:56,120 --> 00:15:59,959
there's certainly a lot of work to do

429
00:15:58,079 --> 00:16:02,399
the atmosphere is far from solemn it's

430
00:15:59,959 --> 00:16:04,800
filled with laughter stories and plenty

431
00:16:02,399 --> 00:16:07,160
of time to catch up with friends of

432
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:09,560
course the humor flows as freely as the

433
00:16:07,160 --> 00:16:12,160
tasks with chicken related jokes making

434
00:16:09,560 --> 00:16:14,160
the rounds even the old classic why did

435
00:16:12,160 --> 00:16:16,480
the chicken cross the road still earns a

436
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:18,800
chuckle in this setting particularly

437
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:20,759
after hours of feather plucking these

438
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:23,399
chicken processing days operate like a

439
00:16:20,759 --> 00:16:25,839
woil machine proving the adage many

440
00:16:23,399 --> 00:16:27,759
hands make light work each person takes

441
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,399
on a specific role one might be in

442
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:31,759
charge of handling the bird Birds

443
00:16:29,399 --> 00:16:33,319
another focused on cleaning While others

444
00:16:31,759 --> 00:16:36,240
assist with packaging the meat or

445
00:16:33,319 --> 00:16:38,560
sorting feathers remarkably even the

446
00:16:36,240 --> 00:16:40,880
feathers don't go to waste finding new

447
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:43,759
life as pillow stuffing or even

448
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:46,680
insulation every task is shared ensuring

449
00:16:43,759 --> 00:16:49,120
no one feels overburdened by the end of

450
00:16:46,680 --> 00:16:51,319
the day fames head home with fresh

451
00:16:49,120 --> 00:16:53,959
processed chicken while everyone departs

452
00:16:51,319 --> 00:16:55,839
with a sense of fulfillment what's truly

453
00:16:53,959 --> 00:16:57,440
remarkable about these events is the

454
00:16:55,839 --> 00:16:59,480
Cooperative spirit that has been

455
00:16:57,440 --> 00:17:01,639
cultivated and passed down through

456
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:03,079
generations this isn't merely about

457
00:17:01,639 --> 00:17:05,760
completing a task it's about

458
00:17:03,079 --> 00:17:07,959
strengthening the ties between families

459
00:17:05,760 --> 00:17:10,079
it's the kind of camarad that leaves

460
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:12,400
everyone feeling both tired and deeply

461
00:17:10,079 --> 00:17:14,880
satisfied like after a hard day of

462
00:17:12,400 --> 00:17:17,039
meaningful work with loved ones for the

463
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:18,480
Amish these gatherings are about more

464
00:17:17,039 --> 00:17:20,760
than producing food there about

465
00:17:18,480 --> 00:17:22,880
nurturing the soul even with their

466
00:17:20,760 --> 00:17:24,760
knowledge and teamwork Amish chicken

467
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:27,039
farmers face a host of challenges in

468
00:17:24,760 --> 00:17:28,880
their trade if raising chickens seems

469
00:17:27,039 --> 00:17:31,440
simple just feeding them grain and gas

470
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:33,600
weing eggs think again the Amish deal

471
00:17:31,440 --> 00:17:36,039
with issues like weather extremes

472
00:17:33,600 --> 00:17:38,640
disease prevention and unpredictable

473
00:17:36,039 --> 00:17:41,080
Market shifts all of which contest even

474
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,919
the most experienced Farmers let's start

475
00:17:41,080 --> 00:17:44,679
with the weather a factor entirely out

476
00:17:42,919 --> 00:17:47,280
of their control but one they must

477
00:17:44,679 --> 00:17:49,760
navigate harsh Winters in Amish Country

478
00:17:47,280 --> 00:17:51,760
don't just require people to bundle up

479
00:17:49,760 --> 00:17:54,400
Farmers must ensure their chicken stay

480
00:17:51,760 --> 00:17:56,360
warm too a sudden cold snap can reduce

481
00:17:54,400 --> 00:17:58,919
egg production quicker than you'd

482
00:17:56,360 --> 00:18:00,960
imagine that's why Amish farmers build

483
00:17:58,919 --> 00:18:03,280
well insulated CPS to keep their Birds

484
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:05,600
comfortable through the frigid months

485
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:07,559
conversely during The Heat Of Summer

486
00:18:05,600 --> 00:18:10,000
keeping chickens cool becomes just as

487
00:18:07,559 --> 00:18:12,760
critical chickens aren't exactly fans of

488
00:18:10,000 --> 00:18:15,000
extreme heat especially while alive

489
00:18:12,760 --> 00:18:18,120
Farmers must ensure their flocks remain

490
00:18:15,000 --> 00:18:20,200
hydrated and maintain proper ventilation

491
00:18:18,120 --> 00:18:22,799
when raising hundreds or even thousands

492
00:18:20,200 --> 00:18:25,159
of birds managing their comfort can feel

493
00:18:22,799 --> 00:18:27,600
like aroundthe clock responsibility each

494
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:29,640
season brings its own unique hurdles and

495
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:31,840
the Amish with their deep respect for

496
00:18:29,640 --> 00:18:33,080
nature have learned to adapt to these

497
00:18:31,840 --> 00:18:35,360
everchanging

498
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:37,480
circumstances but weather isn't the only

499
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:40,159
challenge on their radar disease is

500
00:18:37,480 --> 00:18:43,080
another major concern particularly given

501
00:18:40,159 --> 00:18:45,240
that animals live in close quarters just

502
00:18:43,080 --> 00:18:47,679
as illnesses can spread quickly among

503
00:18:45,240 --> 00:18:49,880
humans chickens are no different to

504
00:18:47,679 --> 00:18:52,159
prevent outbreaks the Amish don't rely

505
00:18:49,880 --> 00:18:54,200
on conventional methods like antibiotics

506
00:18:52,159 --> 00:18:57,400
but instead use natural remedies and

507
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:59,280
holistic care practices herbs and other

508
00:18:57,400 --> 00:19:01,240
traditional techniques play play a big

509
00:18:59,280 --> 00:19:03,840
role in maintaining the health of their

510
00:19:01,240 --> 00:19:05,799
flocks their coups are kept impeccably

511
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:08,039
clean often cleaner than some City

512
00:19:05,799 --> 00:19:10,840
dwellings with rigorous routines to

513
00:19:08,039 --> 00:19:12,679
ensure hygiene however even the most

514
00:19:10,840 --> 00:19:15,000
diligent efforts can't entirely

515
00:19:12,679 --> 00:19:17,240
eliminate the risk of disease when

516
00:19:15,000 --> 00:19:20,080
sickness does strike quick action is

517
00:19:17,240 --> 00:19:21,640
critical Farmers focus on containment to

518
00:19:20,080 --> 00:19:24,159
prevent the illness from spreading to

519
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:26,919
the rest of the flock fun fact just like

520
00:19:24,159 --> 00:19:28,720
humans sick chickens can be ficky eaters

521
00:19:26,919 --> 00:19:30,200
they might turn their beaks up at their

522
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:33,240
usual feed when they're under the

523
00:19:30,200 --> 00:19:35,200
weather luckily the Amish have a variety

524
00:19:33,240 --> 00:19:37,200
of Creative Solutions to encourage their

525
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:39,640
Birds to eat even if it's not their

526
00:19:37,200 --> 00:19:42,159
favorite snack then there's the issue of

527
00:19:39,640 --> 00:19:44,200
Market fluctuations predicting the price

528
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:46,679
of eggs or chickens at the local market

529
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:48,400
is never straightforward prices can

530
00:19:46,679 --> 00:19:51,039
swing dramatically depending on the

531
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:53,960
season consumer demand or broader

532
00:19:51,039 --> 00:19:55,840
National Trends one month Amish farmers

533
00:19:53,960 --> 00:19:59,000
might enjoy high prices for their free

534
00:19:55,840 --> 00:20:01,600
range eggs and the next they might finds

535
00:19:59,000 --> 00:20:03,799
struggling to turn a profit but Amish

536
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:06,080
farmers are nothing if not resilient

537
00:20:03,799 --> 00:20:07,919
their simple Frugal Lifestyles and

538
00:20:06,080 --> 00:20:11,159
careful planning allow them to weather

539
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:13,640
economic ups and downs during good times

540
00:20:11,159 --> 00:20:15,559
they save and reinvest in their Farms

541
00:20:13,640 --> 00:20:17,559
while during tougher periods they

542
00:20:15,559 --> 00:20:19,520
tighten their budgets and push forward

543
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:21,840
with determination despite these

544
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:24,280
challenges the Amish maintain a sense of

545
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:26,000
humor they know that sometimes laughter

546
00:20:24,280 --> 00:20:28,120
is the best way to cope with

547
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:30,640
difficulties one light-hearted joke

548
00:20:28,120 --> 00:20:32,600
often Shar in Amish communities is why

549
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,960
did the chicken cross the road to check

550
00:20:32,600 --> 00:20:36,880
the market price on the other side it's

551
00:20:34,960 --> 00:20:39,240
these small moments of humor that help

552
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,039
them stay grounded and optimistic even

553
00:20:39,240 --> 00:20:44,080
when the road gets rough sometimes the

554
00:20:42,039 --> 00:20:46,159
best way to handle a new challenge is

555
00:20:44,080 --> 00:20:48,400
simply to laugh about it in Amish

556
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:50,720
communities there's a popular joke that

557
00:20:48,400 --> 00:20:53,080
captures this light-heartedness why did

558
00:20:50,720 --> 00:20:55,559
the chicken cross the road to check the

559
00:20:53,080 --> 00:20:57,360
market price on the other side it's one

560
00:20:55,559 --> 00:20:59,840
of those small but cheerful ways they

561
00:20:57,360 --> 00:21:02,280
manage to stay positive even when life

562
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:03,960
doesn't go as planned the lesson here

563
00:21:02,280 --> 00:21:05,919
don't let a chicken cross the road

564
00:21:03,960 --> 00:21:08,480
unless it has it worth while purpose

565
00:21:05,919 --> 00:21:10,400
perhaps market trends are reason enough

566
00:21:08,480 --> 00:21:12,880
this humor reflects the Amish way of

567
00:21:10,400 --> 00:21:14,559
navigating difficulties with Grace

568
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:17,360
what's truly inspiring is their

569
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:19,080
resilience over generations of farming

570
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:20,919
they've faced everything from extreme

571
00:21:19,080 --> 00:21:24,159
weather and disease outbreaks to

572
00:21:20,919 --> 00:21:26,320
economic downturns yet they continue to

573
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:28,159
endure and Thrive their approach to

574
00:21:26,320 --> 00:21:29,159
farming is grounded in values like

575
00:21:28,159 --> 00:21:31,720
simplic

576
00:21:29,159 --> 00:21:33,440
diligence and patience it's never about

577
00:21:31,720 --> 00:21:35,880
quick Solutions but rather about

578
00:21:33,440 --> 00:21:37,840
creating something lasting when faced

579
00:21:35,880 --> 00:21:41,000
with a problem they don't get

580
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:44,000
overwhelmed instead they unite devise a

581
00:21:41,000 --> 00:21:45,799
plan and move forward it's a mindset

582
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:47,720
that anyone could learn from there's

583
00:21:45,799 --> 00:21:49,799
something refreshing about how the Amish

584
00:21:47,720 --> 00:21:51,840
tackle challenges whether it's

585
00:21:49,799 --> 00:21:54,240
unpredictable weather or fluctuating

586
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:57,159
market prices they refuse to let bad

587
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:59,600
days Define them instead they view

588
00:21:57,159 --> 00:22:02,320
obstacles as opportuni to innovate and

589
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:04,760
work harder and sometimes they lighten

590
00:22:02,320 --> 00:22:07,559
the mood with a good laugh Beyond being

591
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:09,760
Farmers they are problem solvers always

592
00:22:07,559 --> 00:22:12,080
anticipating and overcoming whatever

593
00:22:09,760 --> 00:22:14,559
comes their way this is why Amish

594
00:22:12,080 --> 00:22:16,679
chicken farming continues to flourish no

595
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:19,120
matter what nature or the economy throws

596
00:22:16,679 --> 00:22:21,039
at them their farming practices are more

597
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:22,880
than just a livelihood they embody a

598
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:25,200
sustainable way of life that's passed

599
00:22:22,880 --> 00:22:27,120
down through generations their methods

600
00:22:25,200 --> 00:22:29,120
aren't modern Trends but traditional

601
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:30,919
practices refined over centuries countes

602
00:22:29,120 --> 00:22:33,840
a Cornerstone of their sustainable

603
00:22:30,919 --> 00:22:35,679
approach is Land Management for instance

604
00:22:33,840 --> 00:22:38,279
crop rotation is one of their key

605
00:22:35,679 --> 00:22:40,080
strategies for keeping the soil fertile

606
00:22:38,279 --> 00:22:42,520
by planting different crops each year

607
00:22:40,080 --> 00:22:44,799
corn one season soybeans the next day

608
00:22:42,520 --> 00:22:47,159
prevent nutrient depletion it's a

609
00:22:44,799 --> 00:22:49,559
natural way to let the soil rejuvenate

610
00:22:47,159 --> 00:22:51,720
chickens play a crucial role too as they

611
00:22:49,559 --> 00:22:54,480
scratch the ground and forage they

612
00:22:51,720 --> 00:22:56,480
naturally fertilize the soil the Amish

613
00:22:54,480 --> 00:22:58,559
avoid synthetic fertilizers and

614
00:22:56,480 --> 00:23:01,760
chemicals relying instead on this

615
00:22:58,559 --> 00:23:03,840
balanced natural cycle another important

616
00:23:01,760 --> 00:23:06,000
aspect of their sustainability is Waste

617
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,919
Management raising hundreds of chickens

618
00:23:06,000 --> 00:23:10,520
inevitably means dealing with a lot of

619
00:23:07,919 --> 00:23:12,640
manure but instead of seeing it as a

620
00:23:10,520 --> 00:23:15,000
problem the Amish view it as an

621
00:23:12,640 --> 00:23:17,640
opportunity by mixing chicken manure

622
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:20,360
with straw and other organic materials

623
00:23:17,640 --> 00:23:22,480
they create Rich compost this compost is

624
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,360
then used to fertilize their fields

625
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:27,039
creating a closed loop system where

626
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:29,480
nothing is wasted of course not

627
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:31,400
everything goes perfectly one amusing

628
00:23:29,480 --> 00:23:33,760
story involves a young Amish farmer

629
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:35,960
experimenting with composting he had

630
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:37,720
built a large pile of compost in his

631
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:39,640
yard and thought it would be helpful to

632
00:23:37,720 --> 00:23:42,520
let his chickens roam freely around it

633
00:23:39,640 --> 00:23:44,760
to help break it down however he didn't

634
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:47,400
anticipate how enthusiastic the chickens

635
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:49,559
would be before long they had spread the

636
00:23:47,400 --> 00:23:52,159
compost all over the yard turning it

637
00:23:49,559 --> 00:23:55,200
into a massive mess it took him most of

638
00:23:52,159 --> 00:23:57,000
the day to clean it up the lesson while

639
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:59,360
chickens and compost are a great

640
00:23:57,000 --> 00:24:01,799
combination they can cause chaos if not

641
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:03,520
carefully managed sustainability for the

642
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:05,760
Amish isn't just about immediate

643
00:24:03,520 --> 00:24:07,720
benefits it's about the future they

644
00:24:05,760 --> 00:24:09,880
Place great importance on passing down

645
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:12,120
their farming knowledge and practices to

646
00:24:09,880 --> 00:24:14,440
the Next Generation it's common to see

647
00:24:12,120 --> 00:24:17,200
children as young as five or six helping

648
00:24:14,440 --> 00:24:19,120
on the farm learning from their Elders

649
00:24:17,200 --> 00:24:21,159
by the time they're teenagers they're

650
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:24,200
already skilled in techniques like crop

651
00:24:21,159 --> 00:24:26,039
rotation chicken care and composting

652
00:24:24,200 --> 00:24:27,880
it's not just about running a farm it's

653
00:24:26,039 --> 00:24:30,679
about preserving a way of life that has

654
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:32,520
endured for centuries what's remarkable

655
00:24:30,679 --> 00:24:34,399
is that the Amish continue to use

656
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:36,600
traditional methods despite modern

657
00:24:34,399 --> 00:24:38,520
technological advancements while it

658
00:24:36,600 --> 00:24:41,279
might be easier to use tractors or

659
00:24:38,520 --> 00:24:43,559
chemical fertilizers they choose not to

660
00:24:41,279 --> 00:24:45,679
for the Amish farming is about Steward

661
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:47,799
ship carrying for the land and animals

662
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:49,880
in a way that honors their faith and

663
00:24:47,799 --> 00:24:52,080
ensures sustainability for future

664
00:24:49,880 --> 00:24:54,240
Generations their philosophy is like

665
00:24:52,080 --> 00:24:55,880
planting a tree today knowing that it

666
00:24:54,240 --> 00:24:58,440
will provide shade for their

667
00:24:55,880 --> 00:25:00,520
grandchildren Community is also an

668
00:24:58,440 --> 00:25:02,600
essential part of their approach

669
00:25:00,520 --> 00:25:04,840
sustainability isn't an individual

670
00:25:02,600 --> 00:25:06,760
effort it's a collective one neighbors

671
00:25:04,840 --> 00:25:09,880
help one another whether it's with

672
00:25:06,760 --> 00:25:12,159
composting or rotating crops this Spirit

673
00:25:09,880 --> 00:25:14,480
of cooperation not only strengthens

674
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:17,240
their farming practices but also deepens

675
00:25:14,480 --> 00:25:19,240
their communal bonds the Amish model of

676
00:25:17,240 --> 00:25:21,320
sustainability is something the rest of

677
00:25:19,240 --> 00:25:23,120
the world could learn from while many of

678
00:25:21,320 --> 00:25:25,320
us are trying to figure out how to live

679
00:25:23,120 --> 00:25:27,720
more sustainably and reduce our carbon

680
00:25:25,320 --> 00:25:29,399
Footprints the Amish have been quietly

681
00:25:27,720 --> 00:25:31,240
practicing the these principles for

682
00:25:29,399 --> 00:25:33,200
Generations they're not looking for

683
00:25:31,240 --> 00:25:35,399
recognition or awards they're simply

684
00:25:33,200 --> 00:25:37,120
doing what they've always done taking

685
00:25:35,399 --> 00:25:39,960
care of the land so it can take care of

686
00:25:37,120 --> 00:25:39,960
them in return
