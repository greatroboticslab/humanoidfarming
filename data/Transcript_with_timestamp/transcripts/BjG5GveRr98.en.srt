1
00:00:00,319 --> 00:00:06,000
as we continue in integrated rangeland

2
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:08,519
management down this road of honing our

3
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:09,690
skills as grazing managers now we're

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:12,509
going to talk about those specific

5
00:00:09,690 --> 00:00:18,779
grazing methods or systems that can be

6
00:00:12,509 --> 00:00:20,609
applied to to manage goals on land keep

7
00:00:18,779 --> 00:00:22,500
in mind there's a lot of things that a

8
00:00:20,609 --> 00:00:26,369
grazing system or a grazing management

9
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:28,650
plan can do can help the vegetation it

10
00:00:26,369 --> 00:00:32,489
can improve the ecological quality of

11
00:00:28,650 --> 00:00:34,380
the land these items are from the

12
00:00:32,489 --> 00:00:35,790
National rangeland and pasture handbook

13
00:00:34,380 --> 00:00:37,710
another thing that they say there is

14
00:00:35,790 --> 00:00:40,649
that you can improve the efficiency of

15
00:00:37,710 --> 00:00:42,840
grazing through uniform use of all

16
00:00:40,649 --> 00:00:46,129
grazing units so that is one thing that

17
00:00:42,840 --> 00:00:48,300
we do know if you graze smaller units

18
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:50,660
appropriately you can have uniform use

19
00:00:48,300 --> 00:00:50,660
across

20
00:00:56,350 --> 00:00:58,410
you

21
00:01:25,759 --> 00:01:35,340
what Congrats not accomplished they

22
00:01:32,549 --> 00:01:37,829
can't rectify mismanagement because of

23
00:01:35,340 --> 00:01:40,710
some other larger overriding factors

24
00:01:37,829 --> 00:01:43,590
such as the wrong species an incorrect

25
00:01:40,710 --> 00:01:45,390
stocking rate or some major distribution

26
00:01:43,590 --> 00:01:48,090
problems such as water not being

27
00:01:45,390 --> 00:01:51,420
available except every three miles or in

28
00:01:48,090 --> 00:01:53,369
this these graphs below you see this

29
00:01:51,420 --> 00:01:55,979
really really steep country on the right

30
00:01:53,369 --> 00:01:59,640
hand side and those black spots on the

31
00:01:55,979 --> 00:02:01,470
landscape are our cows a grazing system

32
00:01:59,640 --> 00:02:03,119
isn't going to help that animals use

33
00:02:01,470 --> 00:02:06,270
those landscapes it's going to take

34
00:02:03,119 --> 00:02:10,229
something else another we have really

35
00:02:06,270 --> 00:02:11,970
long large long term woody encroachment

36
00:02:10,229 --> 00:02:13,590
into plants that's got to be

37
00:02:11,970 --> 00:02:16,349
accomplished by a season and a type of

38
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:19,459
animal a grazing method is not going to

39
00:02:16,349 --> 00:02:21,569
accomplish changes in those systems

40
00:02:19,459 --> 00:02:23,910
let's talk about these systems we'll

41
00:02:21,569 --> 00:02:26,959
talk about the first which is the kind

42
00:02:23,910 --> 00:02:29,819
of easiest grazing system that can be

43
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:32,810
done and that is what we call continuous

44
00:02:29,819 --> 00:02:34,920
or season-long it's just one pasture

45
00:02:32,810 --> 00:02:36,989
livestock are placed on that pasture in

46
00:02:34,920 --> 00:02:40,019
the spring and they're removed at the

47
00:02:36,989 --> 00:02:41,940
end of the season or in other words are

48
00:02:40,019 --> 00:02:44,790
grazed all year are all season in one

49
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:47,730
pasture so there's some advantages to

50
00:02:44,790 --> 00:02:50,970
this system one it's really simple the

51
00:02:47,730 --> 00:02:54,299
the input the cost and input is pretty

52
00:02:50,970 --> 00:02:57,090
low just have to permit or fence around

53
00:02:54,299 --> 00:02:59,340
the outside there is also an advantage

54
00:02:57,090 --> 00:03:01,069
because livestock production can be

55
00:02:59,340 --> 00:03:03,870
really high on these continuous

56
00:03:01,069 --> 00:03:07,169
season-long systems because animals have

57
00:03:03,870 --> 00:03:10,010
all the choice they need they can choose

58
00:03:07,169 --> 00:03:11,760
any plant any time across that landscape

59
00:03:10,010 --> 00:03:14,669
of course there are quite a few

60
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:16,470
disadvantages too one is if you've got a

61
00:03:14,669 --> 00:03:18,329
really really large pasture or large

62
00:03:16,470 --> 00:03:20,099
allotment you may have difficulty

63
00:03:18,329 --> 00:03:24,120
actually managing or finding the cattle

64
00:03:20,099 --> 00:03:25,829
so that can be a problem plants that are

65
00:03:24,120 --> 00:03:27,930
available that once that animals will

66
00:03:25,829 --> 00:03:29,819
eat even though it's healthy for them to

67
00:03:27,930 --> 00:03:32,040
have maximum choice they're always going

68
00:03:29,819 --> 00:03:34,650
to eat their favorite plants so we tend

69
00:03:32,040 --> 00:03:36,760
to see in season-long systems we often

70
00:03:34,650 --> 00:03:38,860
see the most desirable plants

71
00:03:36,760 --> 00:03:41,319
being a disadvantage because they're the

72
00:03:38,860 --> 00:03:43,090
ones that are always eaten and the same

73
00:03:41,319 --> 00:03:44,319
can be true of riparian quality if you

74
00:03:43,090 --> 00:03:46,690
look at that stream going down the

75
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:49,750
middle of this pasture animals have

76
00:03:46,690 --> 00:03:52,390
access to that all year round that can

77
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:54,910
be okay if it's not really heavy grazing

78
00:03:52,390 --> 00:03:56,799
but I'm in hand in the summer every

79
00:03:54,910 --> 00:03:58,750
summer animals are probably going to

80
00:03:56,799 --> 00:04:00,250
camp out on that on the riparian

81
00:03:58,750 --> 00:04:03,819
vegetation there so it can be pretty

82
00:04:00,250 --> 00:04:06,370
hard on repairing systems also it's not

83
00:04:03,819 --> 00:04:09,069
very well adapted season-long systems

84
00:04:06,370 --> 00:04:12,640
are not really great on areas that have

85
00:04:09,069 --> 00:04:13,870
a lot of topographic challenges so on

86
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:16,329
the other hand these systems can work

87
00:04:13,870 --> 00:04:19,750
really well in fairly small moderate

88
00:04:16,329 --> 00:04:22,120
sized pastures in the plains or in areas

89
00:04:19,750 --> 00:04:24,460
where we have moisture in the summer

90
00:04:22,120 --> 00:04:26,770
areas where there's not a huge riparian

91
00:04:24,460 --> 00:04:28,539
concern and where most of the plants

92
00:04:26,770 --> 00:04:30,729
growing are good forage plants and

93
00:04:28,539 --> 00:04:32,710
there's not a lot of differentiated

94
00:04:30,729 --> 00:04:34,660
inferential between the desired and

95
00:04:32,710 --> 00:04:37,720
undesirable plants so the system can

96
00:04:34,660 --> 00:04:41,680
work really well in some places and it's

97
00:04:37,720 --> 00:04:43,930
a challenging in others to overcome some

98
00:04:41,680 --> 00:04:46,330
of those challenges the next system up

99
00:04:43,930 --> 00:04:49,360
in intensity would be a deferred

100
00:04:46,330 --> 00:04:51,130
rotation system so here's a past here's

101
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:56,620
a set of three I'm sorry instead of four

102
00:04:51,130 --> 00:04:57,970
pastors that are managed the three

103
00:04:56,620 --> 00:04:59,650
pastors that are managed in this case

104
00:04:57,970 --> 00:05:03,520
are the North pasture the upland pasture

105
00:04:59,650 --> 00:05:06,550
and the South pasture what we see here

106
00:05:03,520 --> 00:05:08,530
is that the three pastures are

107
00:05:06,550 --> 00:05:10,150
management and one is deferred every

108
00:05:08,530 --> 00:05:14,530
year in other words one is not grazed

109
00:05:10,150 --> 00:05:16,750
until after seed set so I in the year

110
00:05:14,530 --> 00:05:19,000
one we see that the upland pasture is

111
00:05:16,750 --> 00:05:20,530
deferred and the North pasture starts

112
00:05:19,000 --> 00:05:22,720
out being raised and then animals are

113
00:05:20,530 --> 00:05:24,250
moved to the South pasture and then

114
00:05:22,720 --> 00:05:26,919
they're finally moved to the upland

115
00:05:24,250 --> 00:05:28,570
pasture later in the year and the next

116
00:05:26,919 --> 00:05:30,340
year the deferred pastures the North

117
00:05:28,570 --> 00:05:32,200
pasture so animals start in the South

118
00:05:30,340 --> 00:05:33,760
pasture they're moved the upland pasture

119
00:05:32,200 --> 00:05:35,860
and then later in the summer they moved

120
00:05:33,760 --> 00:05:38,470
back to the North pasture the North

121
00:05:35,860 --> 00:05:41,500
pasture did not have any grazing in that

122
00:05:38,470 --> 00:05:44,229
period from initiation to seed set and

123
00:05:41,500 --> 00:05:46,210
then only receive grazing at the end at

124
00:05:44,229 --> 00:05:48,370
the end of the season so that's how you

125
00:05:46,210 --> 00:05:50,260
see on this chart that we the first year

126
00:05:48,370 --> 00:05:52,900
the upland pasture is deferred

127
00:05:50,260 --> 00:05:55,630
to the north bastard heard in the last

128
00:05:52,900 --> 00:05:57,850
or third year in this rotation the South

129
00:05:55,630 --> 00:05:59,470
pasture was deferred that's why it's

130
00:05:57,850 --> 00:06:01,390
called the deferred rotation because

131
00:05:59,470 --> 00:06:03,610
it's the actual deferment that is being

132
00:06:01,390 --> 00:06:04,990
rotated not the cows I mean the cows are

133
00:06:03,610 --> 00:06:06,460
being rotated too but the important

134
00:06:04,990 --> 00:06:10,360
point is that the deferment is being

135
00:06:06,460 --> 00:06:14,050
rotated some important points of this

136
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:16,180
system one is that the animals are using

137
00:06:14,050 --> 00:06:18,910
all of the units they're using all of

138
00:06:16,180 --> 00:06:20,950
the available area so there's no

139
00:06:18,910 --> 00:06:25,600
extensive stocking rate there's no high

140
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:27,400
stocking rate involved and and that's

141
00:06:25,600 --> 00:06:29,050
that's good because you're taking stock

142
00:06:27,400 --> 00:06:30,250
rate and you're taking a number of

143
00:06:29,050 --> 00:06:31,960
animals and you're spreading across the

144
00:06:30,250 --> 00:06:35,260
whole units the stocking rate is

145
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:37,540
actually fairly low and animal

146
00:06:35,260 --> 00:06:39,700
performance is still fairly high because

147
00:06:37,540 --> 00:06:42,370
animals still have quite a bit of use of

148
00:06:39,700 --> 00:06:45,760
the area and they are able to choose

149
00:06:42,370 --> 00:06:47,350
their pet their diets not quite as high

150
00:06:45,760 --> 00:06:50,020
as that continuous system is still

151
00:06:47,350 --> 00:06:52,630
pretty good riparian areas can benefit

152
00:06:50,020 --> 00:06:54,550
from this because they're at least only

153
00:06:52,630 --> 00:06:57,280
going to be grazed once every three

154
00:06:54,550 --> 00:06:59,710
years during that really hot dry season

155
00:06:57,280 --> 00:07:03,300
the other two years out of any three

156
00:06:59,710 --> 00:07:07,330
they would they would be rested or

157
00:07:03,300 --> 00:07:09,130
deferred they would not be grazed and

158
00:07:07,330 --> 00:07:11,080
I'd also it's an advantage to wildlife

159
00:07:09,130 --> 00:07:13,720
because there's always gonna be some

160
00:07:11,080 --> 00:07:16,060
pastures that are not being used by

161
00:07:13,720 --> 00:07:17,080
livestock and that flipside of that

162
00:07:16,060 --> 00:07:18,730
there's always gonna be some pastures

163
00:07:17,080 --> 00:07:20,980
that were just used by livestock and

164
00:07:18,730 --> 00:07:24,130
often we find with large ungulates like

165
00:07:20,980 --> 00:07:26,730
deer and elk and pronghorn that they

166
00:07:24,130 --> 00:07:29,800
often those animals like following the

167
00:07:26,730 --> 00:07:31,720
cattle or the Sheep because the

168
00:07:29,800 --> 00:07:33,850
livestock will take down some of the

169
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:36,010
dead material and then that makes for

170
00:07:33,850 --> 00:07:38,080
good resources so we often see wildlife

171
00:07:36,010 --> 00:07:42,940
following the livestock and this system

172
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:45,220
allows for that next step FN is the rest

173
00:07:42,940 --> 00:07:46,720
rotation system case we have three

174
00:07:45,220 --> 00:07:49,180
pastures a lot of rest rotations are

175
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:50,620
based on three pastures the difference

176
00:07:49,180 --> 00:07:52,810
between this and deferred rotation is

177
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:55,840
that now one of the pastures is rested

178
00:07:52,810 --> 00:07:58,210
for a whole year you see in year one of

179
00:07:55,840 --> 00:08:01,060
this diagram the spring pasture is

180
00:07:58,210 --> 00:08:03,220
grazed early in the season then animals

181
00:08:01,060 --> 00:08:03,700
are moved at hill pasture and during

182
00:08:03,220 --> 00:08:05,380
that time

183
00:08:03,700 --> 00:08:08,530
creak pastors not grazed at all that

184
00:08:05,380 --> 00:08:10,840
whole year okay that's good because it

185
00:08:08,530 --> 00:08:12,760
gives some pastors rest for a whole year

186
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:14,320
and it means that the plants that aren't

187
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,640
going to be grazed by livestock they

188
00:08:14,320 --> 00:08:17,800
might be grazed by wildlife but they're

189
00:08:15,640 --> 00:08:21,460
not going to be grazed by livestock for

190
00:08:17,800 --> 00:08:23,470
that whole year it's bad because you're

191
00:08:21,460 --> 00:08:25,600
taking all of your animals and you're

192
00:08:23,470 --> 00:08:27,730
concentrating them in two-thirds of the

193
00:08:25,600 --> 00:08:29,380
area at least in this case when you had

194
00:08:27,730 --> 00:08:32,550
three pasture they'd be concentrated in

195
00:08:29,380 --> 00:08:35,140
2/3 of the area so unless this is a

196
00:08:32,550 --> 00:08:37,030
unless there's a decrease in stocking

197
00:08:35,140 --> 00:08:40,360
rate with rest rotations we can see kind

198
00:08:37,030 --> 00:08:43,450
of heavy use of areas that are grazed in

199
00:08:40,360 --> 00:08:48,550
each year on the other hand that use is

200
00:08:43,450 --> 00:08:50,530
is followed by a long period of rest the

201
00:08:48,550 --> 00:08:52,690
downside to this pasture has to do with

202
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:55,330
animal performance we often see

203
00:08:52,690 --> 00:08:58,090
relatively well lower animal performance

204
00:08:55,330 --> 00:09:00,160
in rest rotation systems because animals

205
00:08:58,090 --> 00:09:03,100
are always going on to a pasture that

206
00:09:00,160 --> 00:09:06,040
was deferred or rested meaning there's

207
00:09:03,100 --> 00:09:07,870
always a buildup of biomass of dead

208
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:10,510
biomass so they have to sort through

209
00:09:07,870 --> 00:09:13,390
that dead biomass before they can get to

210
00:09:10,510 --> 00:09:15,580
the green better forage so animal

211
00:09:13,390 --> 00:09:18,580
performance can be quite low in rest

212
00:09:15,580 --> 00:09:20,350
rotation systems the flipside to that

213
00:09:18,580 --> 00:09:22,000
these systems weren't designed so much

214
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:24,100
with livestock and while in mind they

215
00:09:22,000 --> 00:09:26,530
were designed with giving plants every

216
00:09:24,100 --> 00:09:28,150
opportunity to reseed themselves so what

217
00:09:26,530 --> 00:09:30,610
you see in these systems is that a

218
00:09:28,150 --> 00:09:33,520
pasture will not be gracious and spring

219
00:09:30,610 --> 00:09:36,130
to the plants go to seed then they will

220
00:09:33,520 --> 00:09:37,960
be grazed as a way to Tromp the seed

221
00:09:36,130 --> 00:09:40,540
into the soil and then that same pasture

222
00:09:37,960 --> 00:09:42,790
will be rested for the following years

223
00:09:40,540 --> 00:09:44,560
okay so for example look in this diagram

224
00:09:42,790 --> 00:09:49,210
we have in year one the Hill posture is

225
00:09:44,560 --> 00:09:51,210
not grazed from April to July then it is

226
00:09:49,210 --> 00:09:54,430
grazed in August through September

227
00:09:51,210 --> 00:09:56,280
during that time the grazing can shatter

228
00:09:54,430 --> 00:09:59,290
the seeds and stomp them into the ground

229
00:09:56,280 --> 00:10:00,820
the following year the hill pastures not

230
00:09:59,290 --> 00:10:02,050
graze at all so those plants that were

231
00:10:00,820 --> 00:10:07,630
stopped into the ground can now turn

232
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:08,680
into turn into plants now I don't know

233
00:10:07,630 --> 00:10:11,620
that there's a lot of data that shows

234
00:10:08,680 --> 00:10:13,750
that this actually does yield more new

235
00:10:11,620 --> 00:10:14,259
plants but that certainly is the design

236
00:10:13,750 --> 00:10:18,399
behind

237
00:10:14,259 --> 00:10:19,869
system the one that here's an example of

238
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:22,509
one of the most intensive systems we

239
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:25,299
have that would be arrested I'm sorry a

240
00:10:22,509 --> 00:10:26,709
short-duration or a high intensity low

241
00:10:25,299 --> 00:10:29,589
frequency system it's where you have

242
00:10:26,709 --> 00:10:31,660
multiple pastors and every pastor is

243
00:10:29,589 --> 00:10:33,879
grazed by a lot of animals for a short

244
00:10:31,660 --> 00:10:37,059
period and usually each individual

245
00:10:33,879 --> 00:10:38,799
pastors grace several times per year so

246
00:10:37,059 --> 00:10:40,179
let's just take a look at this a pattern

247
00:10:38,799 --> 00:10:42,129
if you look at the diagram down there

248
00:10:40,179 --> 00:10:44,410
it's grazed in January and then it's

249
00:10:42,129 --> 00:10:46,329
grazed again in May and then it's grazed

250
00:10:44,410 --> 00:10:49,179
again in July and then it's grazed again

251
00:10:46,329 --> 00:10:52,799
in November so that pastors raised for

252
00:10:49,179 --> 00:10:55,919
only a few days ten fifteen seven days

253
00:10:52,799 --> 00:10:59,709
but it's grazed multiple times a year

254
00:10:55,919 --> 00:11:02,889
this system was designed to mimic some

255
00:10:59,709 --> 00:11:05,229
of the systems in Africa of large herds

256
00:11:02,889 --> 00:11:08,019
of wildebeest and then other kinds of

257
00:11:05,229 --> 00:11:10,359
prong of antelope coming through the

258
00:11:08,019 --> 00:11:12,549
system and so you see these waves of

259
00:11:10,359 --> 00:11:14,410
animals the advantage from the animal

260
00:11:12,549 --> 00:11:18,189
standpoint is that at least several

261
00:11:14,410 --> 00:11:20,919
times a year the animal has green forage

262
00:11:18,189 --> 00:11:23,199
to go on regrowth so the system was

263
00:11:20,919 --> 00:11:24,999
really designed with animals in mind but

264
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:26,649
it also has the advantage of leveling

265
00:11:24,999 --> 00:11:28,600
the playing field of all the plants you

266
00:11:26,649 --> 00:11:31,329
put a lot of animals into one pasture at

267
00:11:28,600 --> 00:11:33,879
one time that restricts their choices

268
00:11:31,329 --> 00:11:36,309
between plants but it does make sure

269
00:11:33,879 --> 00:11:38,470
that all the plants are grazed so it

270
00:11:36,309 --> 00:11:40,329
makes sure that the zero plants aren't

271
00:11:38,470 --> 00:11:42,669
always getting hit that the undesirable

272
00:11:40,329 --> 00:11:46,149
or less desirable plants are also

273
00:11:42,669 --> 00:11:48,959
getting eaten so these intensive systems

274
00:11:46,149 --> 00:11:51,819
often involve higher stocking rates and

275
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:54,029
they have a you know a large number of

276
00:11:51,819 --> 00:11:56,949
animals on pastures for a short period

277
00:11:54,029 --> 00:11:59,169
they can be quite effective in areas

278
00:11:56,949 --> 00:12:01,059
where you have rain during the growing

279
00:11:59,169 --> 00:12:03,519
season or at least throughout most of

280
00:12:01,059 --> 00:12:05,049
the year I tend to not work as well out

281
00:12:03,519 --> 00:12:07,509
here in the Intermountain West where we

282
00:12:05,049 --> 00:12:09,429
have a pretty short period of moisture

283
00:12:07,509 --> 00:12:12,009
so they so these systems are really

284
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:13,899
adapted to just a few areas where

285
00:12:12,009 --> 00:12:16,089
there's moisture throughout the year and

286
00:12:13,899 --> 00:12:21,429
can really handle that higher sustained

287
00:12:16,089 --> 00:12:23,619
grazing another whole set of systems

288
00:12:21,429 --> 00:12:25,480
could best be just defined as decision

289
00:12:23,619 --> 00:12:26,690
decisional or management intensive

290
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,250
systems

291
00:12:26,690 --> 00:12:31,910
these are systems that have just one

292
00:12:28,250 --> 00:12:33,650
heard and many pastors multiple pastors

293
00:12:31,910 --> 00:12:36,320
and the decisions about whether to move

294
00:12:33,650 --> 00:12:37,910
the animals and where depends on the

295
00:12:36,320 --> 00:12:40,460
amount of forage that's available the

296
00:12:37,910 --> 00:12:42,410
amount of water what activities are

297
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:45,980
happening in the livestock units such as

298
00:12:42,410 --> 00:12:47,870
calving or lambing they're often used to

299
00:12:45,980 --> 00:12:50,030
facilitate other practices such as

300
00:12:47,870 --> 00:12:53,660
hanging or stockpiling enough forage for

301
00:12:50,030 --> 00:12:55,340
prescribed great for our fire and then

302
00:12:53,660 --> 00:12:56,960
finally these systems are probably the

303
00:12:55,340 --> 00:12:59,990
most common in the world and their

304
00:12:56,960 --> 00:13:02,900
success can be really high or low

305
00:12:59,990 --> 00:13:05,860
depending on the bill the ability of the

306
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:08,180
manager the decisions of the manager

307
00:13:05,860 --> 00:13:10,130
some names that we would call these

308
00:13:08,180 --> 00:13:12,860
decisional systems would include the

309
00:13:10,130 --> 00:13:15,260
best pasture system this is where you

310
00:13:12,860 --> 00:13:17,810
move livestock to pastures that look

311
00:13:15,260 --> 00:13:20,090
best in terms of forage availability it

312
00:13:17,810 --> 00:13:23,090
was designed in the arid Southwest is

313
00:13:20,090 --> 00:13:26,420
used a lot in New Mexico Arizona those

314
00:13:23,090 --> 00:13:28,070
areas because oftentimes a storm will

315
00:13:26,420 --> 00:13:31,190
come through and it may put several

316
00:13:28,070 --> 00:13:33,140
inches of rain on a on a pasture but it

317
00:13:31,190 --> 00:13:35,740
might just be on one pasture or one area

318
00:13:33,140 --> 00:13:39,050
of the ranch so in order to use that

319
00:13:35,740 --> 00:13:40,940
green forage the manager makes a

320
00:13:39,050 --> 00:13:43,970
decision to go to the best pasture

321
00:13:40,940 --> 00:13:45,530
available complimentary systems such as

322
00:13:43,970 --> 00:13:49,400
those that are up in the central plains

323
00:13:45,530 --> 00:13:52,040
are where you have a pasture and a

324
00:13:49,400 --> 00:13:54,620
cultivated area you've cultivated some

325
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:56,300
part of the ranch to have green forage

326
00:13:54,620 --> 00:13:58,520
either early in the season or late in

327
00:13:56,300 --> 00:14:00,650
the season so you're making a pasture to

328
00:13:58,520 --> 00:14:02,360
complement the rest of the range so

329
00:14:00,650 --> 00:14:07,490
that's a complementary or decisional

330
00:14:02,360 --> 00:14:09,290
system when you have to elevation to

331
00:14:07,490 --> 00:14:12,950
give you the advantage to be able to go

332
00:14:09,290 --> 00:14:15,200
to green forage at higher elevation you

333
00:14:12,950 --> 00:14:18,020
can accomplish a seasonal suitability

334
00:14:15,200 --> 00:14:19,700
system seasonal suitability is the idea

335
00:14:18,020 --> 00:14:21,500
that you're following the green you're

336
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:23,660
always in put animals on higher and

337
00:14:21,500 --> 00:14:25,280
higher elevation because of the growth

338
00:14:23,660 --> 00:14:30,050
pattern of different vegetation types

339
00:14:25,280 --> 00:14:31,880
that's a seasonal suitability system in

340
00:14:30,050 --> 00:14:33,860
Idaho that's following the green or

341
00:14:31,880 --> 00:14:36,589
seasonal suitability is often seen where

342
00:14:33,860 --> 00:14:38,180
we start out in the winter range down in

343
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:40,250
the salt desert shrub where the shrubs

344
00:14:38,180 --> 00:14:41,810
in the winter a few grasses to give

345
00:14:40,250 --> 00:14:43,910
that energy and shrubs to give the

346
00:14:41,810 --> 00:14:45,110
protein and will stay down there during

347
00:14:43,910 --> 00:14:47,270
the winter months then they start to

348
00:14:45,110 --> 00:14:50,540
move in the bench limbs there's a whole

349
00:14:47,270 --> 00:14:53,270
set of spring fall ranges that green up

350
00:14:50,540 --> 00:14:55,460
in April May time and animals graze

351
00:14:53,270 --> 00:14:58,160
those often times that's where we have

352
00:14:55,460 --> 00:14:59,870
animals calving or lambing out it's a

353
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:01,820
very common system used in sheep

354
00:14:59,870 --> 00:15:04,130
production so you have lambing occurring

355
00:15:01,820 --> 00:15:07,010
that spring fall range from then on

356
00:15:04,130 --> 00:15:09,230
animals just follow up the mountains up

357
00:15:07,010 --> 00:15:11,600
into the summer range we're up in the

358
00:15:09,230 --> 00:15:14,270
summer range it's high elevation there

359
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:17,000
can be snowpack up into June or July so

360
00:15:14,270 --> 00:15:18,640
you can have green forage up until it

361
00:15:17,000 --> 00:15:21,560
starts to cool down in August September

362
00:15:18,640 --> 00:15:23,570
the case of sheep usually those owners

363
00:15:21,560 --> 00:15:25,730
will ship the Lambs off of the mountain

364
00:15:23,570 --> 00:15:28,040
in September take them to sale because

365
00:15:25,730 --> 00:15:30,710
by that time they'll be fat ready to eat

366
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:34,160
ready to sell and then they'll just

367
00:15:30,710 --> 00:15:36,200
slowly move the ewes down the mountain

368
00:15:34,160 --> 00:15:38,450
into that spring fall range again and

369
00:15:36,200 --> 00:15:41,450
then down onto the winter range this

370
00:15:38,450 --> 00:15:43,280
system also works with cattle just that

371
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:44,690
the calves may have to be brought off

372
00:15:43,280 --> 00:15:46,430
and brought to some higher quality

373
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:48,260
forage in that September October

374
00:15:46,430 --> 00:15:50,690
November we'll often see the cat the

375
00:15:48,260 --> 00:15:54,410
steers and heifers being taken off and

376
00:15:50,690 --> 00:15:56,360
gone going to higher quality forage it's

377
00:15:54,410 --> 00:15:59,060
a pretty simple system age-old system

378
00:15:56,360 --> 00:16:00,890
works really well because the animals

379
00:15:59,060 --> 00:16:02,690
are eyes on green forage and the

380
00:16:00,890 --> 00:16:04,610
vegetation usually has time to recover

381
00:16:02,690 --> 00:16:06,050
once the animals get off there's still

382
00:16:04,610 --> 00:16:07,339
enough resources and time for those

383
00:16:06,050 --> 00:16:09,800
plants to recover so it can be really

384
00:16:07,339 --> 00:16:14,120
easy on the range and really easy on the

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:16,160
animal which method is best well it

386
00:16:14,120 --> 00:16:17,720
really depends I've seen all of these

387
00:16:16,160 --> 00:16:19,070
methods work and all of these methods

388
00:16:17,720 --> 00:16:21,410
fail depending on the skill of the

389
00:16:19,070 --> 00:16:23,120
manager and depending on what management

390
00:16:21,410 --> 00:16:26,150
goals are whether it be for livestock

391
00:16:23,120 --> 00:16:29,180
performance whether riparian areas are

392
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:31,940
concern whether livestock production is

393
00:16:29,180 --> 00:16:36,400
the issue whether there's a concern over

394
00:16:31,940 --> 00:16:38,990
wildfire or risk and what and how the

395
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:40,670
landscape would respond to that so all

396
00:16:38,990 --> 00:16:45,230
of these systems can be good at one time

397
00:16:40,670 --> 00:16:47,270
and may be poor at others so there's no

398
00:16:45,230 --> 00:16:49,339
one system fits all it depends on the

399
00:16:47,270 --> 00:16:51,290
skill of the manager nearly all systems

400
00:16:49,339 --> 00:16:54,080
can work and nearly all systems can fail

401
00:16:51,290 --> 00:16:56,210
there are thousands of variations on

402
00:16:54,080 --> 00:17:00,740
theme all of these examples in this

403
00:16:56,210 --> 00:17:03,110
PowerPoint are of one heard systems

404
00:17:00,740 --> 00:17:05,510
multiple pastures or one pasture and one

405
00:17:03,110 --> 00:17:08,150
herd there's a whole set of systems that

406
00:17:05,510 --> 00:17:10,040
are designed with multiple herds so

407
00:17:08,150 --> 00:17:11,750
there's a like there's just variations

408
00:17:10,040 --> 00:17:14,240
on this theme depending on how many

409
00:17:11,750 --> 00:17:16,850
pastures you have exactly what the rest

410
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:20,300
deferment grazing rotation combinations

411
00:17:16,850 --> 00:17:21,920
are are quite endless but no matter the

412
00:17:20,300 --> 00:17:24,830
system you've got to get a stocking

413
00:17:21,920 --> 00:17:26,270
right the species of animal and you've

414
00:17:24,830 --> 00:17:28,970
got to pay attention to distribution

415
00:17:26,270 --> 00:17:31,070
patterns because this the grazing method

416
00:17:28,970 --> 00:17:34,430
is just one of the parts of the equation

417
00:17:31,070 --> 00:17:38,300
and all methods need to be flexible to

418
00:17:34,430 --> 00:17:39,980
be managed and so if the manager is good

419
00:17:38,300 --> 00:17:41,810
and they have the flexibility they can

420
00:17:39,980 --> 00:17:49,790
manage for disturbances on the ground

421
00:17:41,810 --> 00:17:52,460
such as fire weeds droughts animals used

422
00:17:49,790 --> 00:17:53,990
by wildlife or by wild horses all of

423
00:17:52,460 --> 00:17:55,730
those things are things that can change

424
00:17:53,990 --> 00:17:59,870
a management plan and that requires

425
00:17:55,730 --> 00:18:02,330
flexibility so that's about the main

426
00:17:59,870 --> 00:18:03,640
aspects very simplified version of

427
00:18:02,330 --> 00:18:05,630
grazing methods there's some other

428
00:18:03,640 --> 00:18:07,280
readings in this class that will give

429
00:18:05,630 --> 00:18:09,830
you some more of the details for each

430
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:12,590
method but keep your eye on the ball

431
00:18:09,830 --> 00:18:14,510
it's a manage of it's just an aspect of

432
00:18:12,590 --> 00:18:18,620
managing the time that pastures are

433
00:18:14,510 --> 00:18:20,180
grazed or arrested and then we'll next

434
00:18:18,620 --> 00:18:22,100
talk about distribution and some of the

435
00:18:20,180 --> 00:18:25,450
other elements about making your grazing

436
00:18:22,100 --> 00:18:25,450
method successful
