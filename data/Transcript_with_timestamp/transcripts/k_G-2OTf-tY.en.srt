way back in 2003

20
00:00:44,079 --> 00:00:50,480
the teammate program is a combination

21
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:51,039
and a team a team work project really

22
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:54,719
through

00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,280
center at massey university

00:00:56,399 --> 00:01:01,280
and vet life but um laurie will go into

26
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,239
that in a little bit more detail she's

been the lead

28
00:01:02,239 --> 00:01:05,840
veterinarian for the program since the

29
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,240
very

30
00:01:05,840 --> 00:01:10,720
beginning of it so she's got plenty of

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,920
information to share with us

32
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:14,400
on the topics that we've worked on this

33
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:17,119
evening

34
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:18,000
so we're going to look into general

35
00:01:17,119 --> 00:01:20,240
health

36
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:21,840
such as housing and vaccinating and

37
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:24,560
worming

38
00:01:21,840 --> 00:01:25,280
feeding dogs so looking at what's the

39
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:28,799
best

40
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:29,360
type of feed to feed your dog is the dog

41
00:01:28,799 --> 00:01:31,840
that you've

42
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:33,600
got does it need specific feed for the

43
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:36,079
kind of work that it's doing

44
00:01:33,600 --> 00:01:38,720
and so on and then what are some of the

45
00:01:36,079 --> 00:01:41,360
ins and outs around buying a dog

46
00:01:38,720 --> 00:01:43,360
so laura's going to share her knowledge

47
00:01:41,360 --> 00:01:46,240
wisdom and insights

48
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,799
around all of that information for the

49
00:01:46,240 --> 00:01:50,240
evening

50
00:01:46,799 --> 00:01:50,960
so um i've just seen a few additional

51
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:53,680
people

52
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:55,600

topics um

67
00:02:27,440 --> 00:02:34,080
or starting with uh general dog health

68
00:02:31,760 --> 00:02:37,120
yeah good evening everybody my name is

69
00:02:34,080 --> 00:02:39,840
laurie lenny and i'm a veterinarian in

70
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,560
alexandria i've originally from canada

71
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,200
i've been

72
00:02:40,560 --> 00:02:47,920
in new zealand for over over 30 years

73
00:02:45,200 --> 00:02:48,239
and one of my biggest passions certainly

74
00:02:47,920 --> 00:02:49,760
is

75
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:51,599
working dogs i was a large animal vet

76
00:02:49,760 --> 00:02:54,720
for quite a few years before i

77
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:56,160
ended up being um i became a

78
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:59,120
really really interested in orthopedic

79
00:02:56,160 --> 00:03:01,280
surgery so with that comes lameness

80
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:03,680
and all sorts of activities that involve

81
00:03:01,280 --> 00:03:07,200
our working dogs so

82
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:09,840
from that we decided to look at

83
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:11,440
um setting up a program give us a little

84
00:03:09,840 --> 00:03:14,159
bit more information of the

85
00:03:11,440 --> 00:03:16,000
general health and what exactly was

86
00:03:14,159 --> 00:03:17,280
going on with our working dogs because

87
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,640
if you look

88
00:03:17,280 --> 00:03:20,319
at the information that we have

89
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:22,879
available to us

90
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:24,640
on the general husbandry and management

91
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:26,720
of new zealand working dogs

92
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:28,319
it amounts to about one small box in a

93
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:31,680
warehouse

94
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:33,680
so we decided to set up a

95
00:03:31,680 --> 00:03:35,040
basically a five to six year program

96
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:38,239
that was

97
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:40,239
um looking at just about everything we

98
00:03:38,239 --> 00:03:43,280
could with working dogs right from

99
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,760
feeding vaccination worming

100
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:47,599
um what they were fed how they were

101
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:49,280
housed

102
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,440
what kind of animals they worked with

103
00:03:49,280 --> 00:03:53,280
how many how many stock interactions

104
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:56,000
they would have

105
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:57,680
so basically we did full on recording

106
00:03:56,000 --> 00:04:00,879
for

107
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:03,519
six rounds so those animals were

108
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:05,599
hands-on examined by a veterinarian um

109
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:10,239
six times over the course of those years

110
00:04:05,599 --> 00:04:14,879
um about four years from 2014 to 2018

111
00:04:10,239 --> 00:04:15,760
and we ran an embedded parasite study as

112
00:04:14,879 --> 00:04:18,239
well as

113
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,280
we used hay rex monitors for about 18

114
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:21,600
months

115
00:04:19,280 --> 00:04:22,479
and recorded some information there now

116
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:24,400
there's been a lot of

117
00:04:22,479 --> 00:04:26,320
information come out of it there's still

118
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:28,240
an awful lot more to come

119
00:04:26,320 --> 00:04:29,759
um so it's pretty exciting it doesn't

120
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:31,680
seem like it's

121
00:04:29,759 --> 00:04:32,800
um earth shadowing for some of the for

122
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,880
some people but

123
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:36,080
um it's going to be referred to as a

124
00:04:34,880 --> 00:04:39,440
baseline project for

125
00:04:36,080 --> 00:04:42,479
for many years to come so um

126
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:45,680
without further ado we might head into

127
00:04:42,479 --> 00:04:46,800
the first topic which is basic general

128
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:51,360
health

129
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:55,520
um so the working dog project was

130
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:56,800
126 owners involving about 640 dogs we

131
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:58,000
sort of had in our heads we were going

132
00:04:56,800 --> 00:05:01,039
to look at about

133
00:04:58,000 --> 00:05:02,639
300 but it soon morphed into something a

134
00:05:01,039 --> 00:05:06,080
bit larger so

135
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:09,199
it was pretty interesting so

136
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,320
um part of our big things with germa

137
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:13,440
health is

138
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,800
vaccination so the core vaccinations

139
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,320
that we would look at

140
00:05:14,800 --> 00:05:18,320
are the vaccinations that we have

141
00:05:16,320 --> 00:05:21,120
available to us for

142
00:05:18,320 --> 00:05:22,000
dogs the core vaccine which is

143
00:05:21,120 --> 00:05:25,759
parvovirus

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:26,160
december adeno2 virus or endovirus ii

145
00:05:25,759 --> 00:05:29,360
which

146
00:05:26,160 --> 00:05:32,160
is hepatitis and there is one also that

147
00:05:29,360 --> 00:05:33,520
um is involved in one of the viral types

148
00:05:32,160 --> 00:05:35,600
of kennel cough

149
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:38,000
and and para influenza which is also a

150
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:40,479
respiratory virus

151
00:05:38,000 --> 00:05:42,960
kennel cough vaccinations which usually

152
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:46,479
are either entering a nasal or

153
00:05:42,960 --> 00:05:48,720
subcutaneous injection are mostly

154
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,840
for the bacterial component of kennel

155
00:05:48,720 --> 00:05:51,759
cough and that's bordetella

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:54,400
bronchosceptica

157
00:05:51,759 --> 00:05:56,560
we're currently um in most of our

158
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:59,039
regions are undergoing

159
00:05:56,560 --> 00:05:59,759
or experiencing an outbreak of kennel

160
00:05:59,039 --> 00:06:03,120
cough

161
00:05:59,759 --> 00:06:04,639
right from christchurch south um

162
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:06,160
with there is i'm sure there's a world

163
00:06:04,639 --> 00:06:08,080
further north from that we don't pay

164
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:10,240
that much attention to it

165
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,440
but uh certainly in the southern part of

166
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:13,360
the south island we're certainly

167
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:14,800
experiencing lots and lots of kennel

168
00:06:13,360 --> 00:06:18,160
cough both in pet

169
00:06:14,800 --> 00:06:19,919
and working dogs

170
00:06:18,160 --> 00:06:21,919
um the last one on that list is

171
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,440
leptospirosis we don't tend to worry

172
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:24,080
about it too much in the south island

173
00:06:23,440 --> 00:06:26,639
because it

174
00:06:24,080 --> 00:06:27,280
um doesn't tend to be much of a clinical

175
00:06:26,639 --> 00:06:28,720
issue

176
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,880
that does become an issue if your

177
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:34,240
animals go to the north island

178
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:36,479
and require vaccination for that

179
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:38,880
so general recommendations well best

180
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:41,440
practice recommendations would be

181
00:06:38,880 --> 00:06:42,160
that you vaccinate for with the core

182
00:06:41,440 --> 00:06:44,800
vaccine

183
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:46,319
and your big big one is parvovirus i'm

184
00:06:44,800 --> 00:06:48,479
sure that everybody knows

185
00:06:46,319 --> 00:06:49,520
about parvovirus that causes hemorrhagic

186
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,800
diarrhea

187
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:56,000
in puppies and can have quite a high

188
00:06:52,800 --> 00:06:57,919
mortality rate um very infectious and

189
00:06:56,000 --> 00:07:01,360
lasts a long time in the environment

190
00:06:57,919 --> 00:07:02,400
now that those core vaccines they should

191
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,120
be started

192
00:07:02,400 --> 00:07:06,319
at between six to eight weeks and be

193
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:09,599
vaccinated

194
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:11,440
every four weeks until over 12 to 16

195
00:07:09,599 --> 00:07:14,720
weeks

196
00:07:11,440 --> 00:07:16,639
and depending on what type of

197
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,080
which vaccine you're using and what the

198
00:07:16,639 --> 00:07:20,319
recommendations are

199
00:07:18,080 --> 00:07:21,680
the current world small animal

200
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:23,520
veterinary association

201
00:07:21,680 --> 00:07:25,440
recommends that your last vaccine be

202
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:28,639
after 16 weeks of age

203
00:07:25,440 --> 00:07:29,680
to get over any residual maternal

204
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:32,479
immunity that

205
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:32,960
some um puppies might have that means

206
00:07:32,479 --> 00:07:34,319
that

207
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:36,160
that immunity that they get from the

208
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:37,840
colostrum will interfere with their

209
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:39,360
ability to mount an immune response and

210
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:42,240
they do recommend

211
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:44,080
um that their last happy vaccination be

212
00:07:42,240 --> 00:07:45,840
after 16 months

213
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:48,479
so after they have their set of puppy

214
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:50,319
vaccinations they are usually vaccinated

215
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:51,680
again at six to twelve months and then

216
00:07:50,319 --> 00:07:55,520
as an adult

217
00:07:51,680 --> 00:07:58,800
every three years as far as kennel

218
00:07:55,520 --> 00:08:00,319
cough goes that's um generally

219
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:02,319
you can start whenever you like it only

220
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:05,520
takes three days for intranasal

221
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:08,319
and um 14 days after two

222
00:08:05,520 --> 00:08:09,759
injections to mount an immune response

223
00:08:08,319 --> 00:08:13,280
but those need to be boosted

224
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:14,479
annually as does leptospirosis

225
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:17,360
so those are the best practice

226
00:08:14,479 --> 00:08:19,039
recommendation in the real world

227
00:08:17,360 --> 00:08:20,479
well that doesn't tend to happen that

228
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,680
much

229
00:08:20,479 --> 00:08:26,400
uh through our study we found 45

230
00:08:23,680 --> 00:08:27,280
of dogs were vaccinated only as puppies

231
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:29,199
so they had their

232
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:30,479
course of puppy vaccinations and then

233
00:08:29,199 --> 00:08:33,519
they were vaccinated i

234
00:08:30,479 --> 00:08:35,039
never vaccinated again after that and

235
00:08:33,519 --> 00:08:37,440
another 12

236
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,839
were never vaccinated and then the

237
00:08:37,440 --> 00:08:41,919
remaining

238
00:08:38,839 --> 00:08:45,519
um 40 odd percent were

239
00:08:41,919 --> 00:08:48,640
um had some or variable

240
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:51,200
types of vaccinations and um

241
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:52,560
different vaccination intervals but

242
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,519
working dogs are a little bit of a

243
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:55,920
different

244
00:08:53,519 --> 00:08:56,880
situation compared to pet dogs in that

245
00:08:55,920 --> 00:09:00,640
they're usually

246
00:08:56,880 --> 00:09:04,160
living in fairly um you know

247
00:09:00,640 --> 00:09:06,959
areas that are far away from big

248
00:09:04,160 --> 00:09:08,880
populations of dogs so they don't tend

249
00:09:06,959 --> 00:09:11,360
to come in contact with a huge number of

250
00:09:08,880 --> 00:09:13,120
dogs except in a certain situation say

251
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:15,600
of the shepherd who may move from

252
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:17,200
property to property those dogs in

253
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:18,800
particular are more likely to spread

254
00:09:17,200 --> 00:09:21,279
disease than the ones that live on the

255
00:09:18,800 --> 00:09:23,920
same farm for their entire lives

256
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:25,440
um i think where we probably have to be

257
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:27,360
very careful with those puppy

258
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:29,680
vaccinations

259
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:31,200
primal vaccination um is the one that

260
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:34,480
probably caused the greatest

261
00:09:31,200 --> 00:09:36,480
incidence of disease in our working dogs

262
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:37,839
and certainly uh that's a very good

263
00:09:36,480 --> 00:09:40,480
vaccine it has

264
00:09:37,839 --> 00:09:41,600
a really good protection against the

265
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
disease

266
00:09:41,600 --> 00:09:45,920
and so usually if they have one to two

267
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:48,640
vaccinations with carbo virus

268
00:09:45,920 --> 00:09:50,160
vaccination they if they do come down

269
00:09:48,640 --> 00:09:51,600
with the disease it's usually a mild

270
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:54,240
form

271
00:09:51,600 --> 00:09:56,480
and certainly is often protective for a

272
00:09:54,240 --> 00:10:00,560
very long period of time

273
00:09:56,480 --> 00:10:02,959
um how long exactly those vaccinations

274
00:10:00,560 --> 00:10:04,160
are protective for while the drug

275
00:10:02,959 --> 00:10:06,079
companies you

276
00:10:04,160 --> 00:10:07,279
as adults give you every three years and

277
00:10:06,079 --> 00:10:09,519
they don't have

278
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,720
um haven't gone beyond that to get the

279
00:10:09,519 --> 00:10:13,519
data

280
00:10:10,720 --> 00:10:14,399
um to prove how long those vaccinations

281
00:10:13,519 --> 00:10:16,839
last

282
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:18,000
uh simply because it's a money related

283
00:10:16,839 --> 00:10:20,079
issue

284
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:22,480
now the other thing i guess you can do

285
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:23,279
or that is being done overseas is that

286
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:27,040
people are

287
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:29,279
doing um titans anybody titles to see if

288
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:31,920
their dogs need to be vaccinated

289
00:10:29,279 --> 00:10:33,360
in new zealand that's cost um really

290
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,880
cost prohibitive

291
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:36,640
it's just cheaper to vaccinate than i

292
00:10:34,880 --> 00:10:37,360
suppose um but certainly there are

293
00:10:36,640 --> 00:10:38,640
people who

294
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,720
don't want to vaccinate any more than

295
00:10:38,640 --> 00:10:44,000
they absolutely have to and that um

296
00:10:40,720 --> 00:10:45,120
that can be offered but so for your

297
00:10:44,000 --> 00:10:48,079
general

298
00:10:45,120 --> 00:10:49,839
working dog don't please don't miss

299
00:10:48,079 --> 00:10:53,279
those core vaccines as puppies

300
00:10:49,839 --> 00:10:55,600
um it's a way way easier

301
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:56,720
thing to do to prevent the parvovirus

302
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:59,680
than it is to treat it

303
00:10:56,720 --> 00:11:01,200
certainly a hang of a lot less expensive

304
00:10:59,680 --> 00:11:03,519
um

305
00:11:01,200 --> 00:11:05,200
certainly distemper and hepatitis we

306
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:07,360
don't see too much of any more there is

307
00:11:05,200 --> 00:11:08,959
a little bit tinkering around but

308
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:10,399
the amount of evidence that's in the

309
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:15,760
population isn't really

310
00:11:10,399 --> 00:11:19,839
that significant

311
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:21,839
um back from that we go to worming of

312
00:11:19,839 --> 00:11:24,160
pups and adults now this probably seems

313
00:11:21,839 --> 00:11:25,279
pretty pedestrian to a lot of people but

314
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:28,399
it's amazing

315
00:11:25,279 --> 00:11:31,600
the variation in um

316
00:11:28,399 --> 00:11:32,800
husbandry that we found with worming um

317
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,680
through a lot of people you know we

318
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,000
would ask people

319
00:11:33,680 --> 00:11:37,839
generally you know do you worm your dogs

320
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:40,240
yes we were my dogs and

321
00:11:37,839 --> 00:11:41,600
it was every combination of how often

322
00:11:40,240 --> 00:11:44,240
and when

323
00:11:41,600 --> 00:11:45,120
and certainly the sheep measles um

324
00:11:44,240 --> 00:11:47,760
treatments

325
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:49,200
were something that really amazed me oh

326
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:51,279
 measles has been around for

327
00:11:49,200 --> 00:11:52,800
years and years and years and you think

328
00:11:51,279 --> 00:11:56,079
that everybody sort of

329
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:58,079
would know how to sort that one out but

330
00:11:56,079 --> 00:12:00,000
but indeed um a lot of people just

331
00:11:58,079 --> 00:12:02,320
weren't aware of of how often

332
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:04,560
and when you should be treating for that

333
00:12:02,320 --> 00:12:07,600
so starting out with pops

334
00:12:04,560 --> 00:12:08,480
pups should be wormed starting at two

335
00:12:07,600 --> 00:12:11,440
weeks of age

336
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:12,959
um you know it's heartbreaking to to

337
00:12:11,440 --> 00:12:15,279
have a puppy brought in

338
00:12:12,959 --> 00:12:17,200
for a post-mortem and have it full of um

339
00:12:15,279 --> 00:12:18,639
for the worms that have a gut rupture or

340
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,720
obstruction

341
00:12:18,639 --> 00:12:21,760
simply due to the fact that it's got

342
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,800
massive

343
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:26,800
aspirin loads or

344
00:12:24,800 --> 00:12:28,720
blood out due to footworm infection so

345
00:12:26,800 --> 00:12:31,920
again something that's

346
00:12:28,720 --> 00:12:35,040
that's pretty easy to prevent um

347
00:12:31,920 --> 00:12:35,519
certainly in the the parasite trials

348
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,959
that we

349
00:12:35,519 --> 00:12:41,279
did run we we did found that they've

350
00:12:38,959 --> 00:12:42,240
um that the couple of wormers that are

351
00:12:41,279 --> 00:12:45,040
commonly used

352
00:12:42,240 --> 00:12:46,079
in dogs um don't tend to look like

353
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:49,760
they're causing

354
00:12:46,079 --> 00:12:51,040
um resistance still effective and um

355
00:12:49,760 --> 00:12:53,360
you know not an issue to continue on

356
00:12:51,040 --> 00:12:56,240
with what we have so those pups

357
00:12:53,360 --> 00:12:58,000
start at two weeks of age and then um

358
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:59,680
continue on every two weeks until

359
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:01,600
they're 12 weeks of age as they get a

360
00:12:59,680 --> 00:13:04,560
little bit older they do develop some

361
00:13:01,600 --> 00:13:06,720
immunity and certainly have much less

362
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:10,639
reinfection rate

363
00:13:06,720 --> 00:13:11,200
um as at after 12 weeks we go every once

364
00:13:10,639 --> 00:13:13,440
a month

365
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:14,320
until they're six months of age and then

366
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:17,040
as a as an

367
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:18,160
adult we'll talk about down to that down

368
00:13:17,040 --> 00:13:20,800
below

369
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,079
um certainly use a broad spectrum warmer

370
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:23,200
make sure you're using something that

371
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:25,040
treats

372
00:13:23,200 --> 00:13:26,320
the biggest thing in puppies is round

373
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
worms astrid's

374
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:32,160
um as they get older tapeworms are

375
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:34,639
are more important but um certainly use

376
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:37,680
a broad spectrum warmer in those puppies

377
00:13:34,639 --> 00:13:40,880
um as far as your adults goes there are

378
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:42,639
two trains of thoughts there some people

379
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:44,240
treat for shape measles and some people

380
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:48,240
don't

381
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:50,880
if your dog never has opportunity to

382
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:51,839
um come in contact with either untreated

383
00:13:50,880 --> 00:13:53,440
offer or mate

384
00:13:51,839 --> 00:13:55,120
then there probably isn't a huge

385
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:55,519
infection rate and those people believe

386
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:58,720
that

387
00:13:55,519 --> 00:14:00,240
um because of those the way they

388
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:01,760
manage their fee that they don't need

389
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:03,519
that uh we

390
00:14:01,760 --> 00:14:05,040
i still come across dogs that have

391
00:14:03,519 --> 00:14:07,760
tapeworms

392
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:10,399
um every now and then so i think still

393
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:12,079
an important issue

394
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:13,680
so as an adult if you're not going to

395
00:14:12,079 --> 00:14:15,199
worry about sheep nasals then

396
00:14:13,680 --> 00:14:17,839
for their own health they should be

397
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,880
warmed once every three months with a

398
00:14:17,839 --> 00:14:20,959
broad spectrum

399
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:22,560
warmer that's to get both roundworms and

400
00:14:20,959 --> 00:14:26,720
tapeworms

401
00:14:22,560 --> 00:14:29,760
most people still use still treat for

402
00:14:26,720 --> 00:14:30,480
sheep nasals and sheep measles needs to

403
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,519
be treated

404
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:35,920
every 30 days that's the the length of

405
00:14:33,519 --> 00:14:38,639
time it takes for infection

406
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:40,160
so um basically you're looking to treat

407
00:14:38,639 --> 00:14:43,440
once a month

408
00:14:40,160 --> 00:14:45,440
with a tape warmer and every

409
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:46,880
third month with a broad spectrum warmer

410
00:14:45,440 --> 00:14:49,360
to get you back into those

411
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:50,399
um roundworm treatment for the animal's

412
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:52,079
health

413
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:54,079
so again if you look down below there it

414
00:14:52,079 --> 00:14:55,600
says month one use a broad spectrum

415
00:14:54,079 --> 00:14:57,519
warmer and then the two months in

416
00:14:55,600 --> 00:15:00,240
between you just need to use a tapeworm

417
00:14:57,519 --> 00:15:01,440
they're tapeworm medication by itself is

418
00:15:00,240 --> 00:15:04,480
much less

419
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:05,600
expensive um and certainly an easier way

420
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:07,360
to go

421
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:12,160
financially than treating with broad

422
00:15:07,360 --> 00:15:14,480
spectrum warmers all the time

423
00:15:12,160 --> 00:15:16,160
um part three of general health i guess

424
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:16,800
we're going to talk about housing and

425
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:18,959
that was

426
00:15:16,800 --> 00:15:20,399
that was an interesting thing that we

427
00:15:18,959 --> 00:15:23,279
that we got to look at

428
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:24,320
lots and lots of kennels um there was a

429
00:15:23,279 --> 00:15:26,880
lot

430
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:28,160
you know a big variation of materials

431
00:15:26,880 --> 00:15:30,240
and types of kennels

432
00:15:28,160 --> 00:15:31,680
um some people are are getting pretty

433
00:15:30,240 --> 00:15:32,240
swish as far as what they're getting

434
00:15:31,680 --> 00:15:34,720
into with

435
00:15:32,240 --> 00:15:36,959
heated insulated kennels in some aspects

436
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:38,639
in central attack where we can get

437
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:40,320
off the cold in the winter time down

438
00:15:38,639 --> 00:15:43,839
into the to the

439
00:15:40,320 --> 00:15:46,399
um you know low 15s and 20s

440
00:15:43,839 --> 00:15:47,199
and it's um staying cool for those guys

441
00:15:46,399 --> 00:15:50,720
out there with

442
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:51,759
without much protection so basically

443
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:55,120
your housing

444
00:15:51,759 --> 00:15:56,880
will affect the energy requirement and

445
00:15:55,120 --> 00:15:59,440
quality and quantity of sleep that your

446
00:15:56,880 --> 00:16:02,240
dogs are getting in at night

447
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:02,880
um and so that affects how much you need

448
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,920
to feed them

449
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:07,680
and also affects how

450
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:09,680
much recovery your dog's going to get

451
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:10,880
overnight

452
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:12,959
and how tired they're going to be the

453
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:14,560
next day and i guess i always

454
00:16:12,959 --> 00:16:17,040
i don't think it's a big jump to believe

455
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,399
that um you know a dog like a person if

456
00:16:17,040 --> 00:16:20,160
you get a poor night's sleep then you're

457
00:16:18,399 --> 00:16:21,759
going to be more likely

458
00:16:20,160 --> 00:16:23,440
to be not paying attention at work and

459
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:27,040
cause yourself injury

460
00:16:23,440 --> 00:16:28,720
during the day um so i guess the things

461
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:32,320
that we maybe need to think about

462
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:34,399
are um shelter and position of kennels

463
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:36,399
so putting them in a place where they

464
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:38,480
can get some sunshine on them in the day

465
00:16:36,399 --> 00:16:40,560
take them up

466
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:43,040
and out of the wind if at all possible

467
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:45,600
and certainly in some places

468
00:16:43,040 --> 00:16:46,959
um in central otago it's pretty tough

469
00:16:45,600 --> 00:16:48,160
because the wind comes from several

470
00:16:46,959 --> 00:16:50,959
different directions certainly in

471
00:16:48,160 --> 00:16:53,839
canterbury we know that to be a fact

472
00:16:50,959 --> 00:16:54,880
but there are ways and means of

473
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:56,880
providing them

474
00:16:54,880 --> 00:16:58,160
wind protection especially in the

475
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:59,120
wintertime when the winds are really

476
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:02,160
really cold

477
00:16:59,120 --> 00:17:04,959
being some people would

478
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:06,160
put carpet that they wrapped around the

479
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:08,559
outside of the kennels

480
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:09,760
so it broke the wind and that made a

481
00:17:08,559 --> 00:17:12,880
huge difference to the

482
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:15,439
the warmth of the kennels themselves um

483
00:17:12,880 --> 00:17:16,799
removable doors or flaps so the dogs

484
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:18,880
could go in and they

485
00:17:16,799 --> 00:17:20,880
had a chance to let their own body heat

486
00:17:18,880 --> 00:17:24,079
kennels up especially if they were

487
00:17:20,880 --> 00:17:27,199
uh insulated doesn't take an awful lot

488
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:30,559
to keep them comfortable um

489
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:33,760
bedding there was um about 44

490
00:17:30,559 --> 00:17:34,720
of the people that we we canvassed used

491
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,840
some

492
00:17:34,720 --> 00:17:40,880
type of bathing and that varied from

493
00:17:37,840 --> 00:17:44,080
um straw to sex

494
00:17:40,880 --> 00:17:47,600
stuff with wool or straw

495
00:17:44,080 --> 00:17:50,240
actual um burlap beds that

496
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:51,039
that are pretty popular nowadays to to

497
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:53,840
proper bedding

498
00:17:51,039 --> 00:17:55,520
carpet in the bottom um and you will

499
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:57,919
always come across dogs that

500
00:17:55,520 --> 00:17:59,360
their very favorite thing to do is to as

501
00:17:57,919 --> 00:18:00,320
soon as you put that bidding in they

502
00:17:59,360 --> 00:18:03,360
like to

503
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:05,440
tear it all out and those dogs become

504
00:18:03,360 --> 00:18:06,559
can become a bit of a problem i did come

505
00:18:05,440 --> 00:18:09,120
across

506
00:18:06,559 --> 00:18:10,640
one fella locally and he just kept

507
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:12,160
trying different

508
00:18:10,640 --> 00:18:14,000
options until he found something that

509
00:18:12,160 --> 00:18:17,360
they that they would leave

510
00:18:14,000 --> 00:18:18,559
and most dogs um he said he could get

511
00:18:17,360 --> 00:18:20,320
them to figure out that actually they

512
00:18:18,559 --> 00:18:21,360
were better off with betting them

513
00:18:20,320 --> 00:18:23,520
without

514
00:18:21,360 --> 00:18:24,799
uh but he did have one dog in particular

515
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,400
that there was no way

516
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:28,240
that he could keep betting in his kennel

517
00:18:26,400 --> 00:18:30,480
and sometimes you know you might leave

518
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:31,919
it for a week and then have a tanty and

519
00:18:30,480 --> 00:18:35,919
then throw his toys out of the cough and

520
00:18:31,919 --> 00:18:38,640
have no bedding is killing it again

521
00:18:35,919 --> 00:18:40,480
um insulation is starting to be more

522
00:18:38,640 --> 00:18:42,880
common there's about 14

523
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:43,760
of people that look at insulating their

524
00:18:42,880 --> 00:18:48,080
kennels

525
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:50,320
be it using bats or

526
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:52,160
styrofoam especially under the floor

527
00:18:50,320 --> 00:18:55,280
that's where we tend to get a lot of

528
00:18:52,160 --> 00:18:57,520
grease coming through may have

529
00:18:55,280 --> 00:18:59,120
nice tin walls but those floors are

530
00:18:57,520 --> 00:19:00,720
always flattered and they tend to let an

531
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,039
awful lot of cold air up and in through

532
00:19:00,720 --> 00:19:04,880
the

533
00:19:01,039 --> 00:19:08,799
with the dogs actually sitting um

534
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:11,440
and then we look at coats and there was

535
00:19:08,799 --> 00:19:12,720
24 of our people that used coats and

536
00:19:11,440 --> 00:19:14,559
probably

537
00:19:12,720 --> 00:19:16,320
quite a few more people used coats by

538
00:19:14,559 --> 00:19:18,480
the time we were finished than

539
00:19:16,320 --> 00:19:19,760
than when we started um they were only

540
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:20,640
just beginning to sort of becoming

541
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:25,120
involved

542
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,720
around about you know early to 2010

543
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:29,200
and certainly becoming more and more

544
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,160
popular again you do come across some

545
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:32,880
animals that

546
00:19:30,160 --> 00:19:34,960
especially puppies that are quite happy

547
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:38,000
to take their quotes off

548
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:38,880
but the more common story we hear is

549
00:19:38,000 --> 00:19:40,480
that

550
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:42,080
the dogs line up to have their coats on

551
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:43,679
it at night when they hold them open

552
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:45,440
they run in and you know they run

553
00:19:43,679 --> 00:19:47,440
straight into the yolk of them

554
00:19:45,440 --> 00:19:48,880
to be strapped in for the night so

555
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:50,960
there's a lot of people that are using a

556
00:19:48,880 --> 00:19:54,000
lot more people now using coats

557
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,559
than they did before now we have had one

558
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:56,720
question

559
00:19:54,559 --> 00:19:57,679
come in and i came up with the question

560
00:19:56,720 --> 00:20:00,960
myself

561
00:19:57,679 --> 00:20:06,240
um so does drontel cover sheep

562
00:20:00,960 --> 00:20:09,200
measles yes it does so brontells um

563
00:20:06,240 --> 00:20:10,559
got protection against both round worms

564
00:20:09,200 --> 00:20:12,720
and tape rooms

565
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:14,400
so dronta will do that's your one that's

566
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:16,000
the broad spectrum warmer the one that

567
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:18,400
you would marry up with that in the

568
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:21,039
months in between would be drum set

569
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:21,600
which is just tape remember by itself or

570
00:20:21,039 --> 00:20:24,640
there's

571
00:20:21,600 --> 00:20:27,760
uh variable ones available out there now

572
00:20:24,640 --> 00:20:30,080
um called t you know they've your

573
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:31,280
veterinarians will help you guide

574
00:20:30,080 --> 00:20:32,960
through those they've all stopped

575
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:34,159
different ones we tend to

576
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:36,000
i think there's there used to be an

577
00:20:34,159 --> 00:20:38,799
anchor tape warmer there's another

578
00:20:36,000 --> 00:20:39,760
it's just called tape warmer but that

579
00:20:38,799 --> 00:20:41,600
that tends to

580
00:20:39,760 --> 00:20:43,600
to cover what you want so drawn tall is

581
00:20:41,600 --> 00:20:46,000
a broad spectrum drawn foot is tape

582
00:20:43,600 --> 00:20:48,720
warmer only

583
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,280
cold thanks laurie uh so the question

584
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,880
that i

585
00:20:49,280 --> 00:20:55,120
had was also in relation to to worms and

586
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:57,200
it was worms and puppies

587
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:58,559
and my query was kind of around where

588
00:20:57,200 --> 00:21:02,640
did those puppies

589
00:20:58,559 --> 00:21:04,720
get those worms from so

590
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:06,960
rounds are pretty clever um if you want

591
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,640
to if you want to reinfect a puppy then

592
00:21:06,960 --> 00:21:09,919
the most sensible thing to do would be

593
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:12,000
have your

594
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:13,520
uh larva sitting on the teeth and that's

595
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:16,799
exactly what happens

596
00:21:13,520 --> 00:21:19,280
so the eggs pass in the mother's feces

597
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:21,840
and those larvae

598
00:21:19,280 --> 00:21:22,559
get um sit around the teeth puppies

599
00:21:21,840 --> 00:21:25,280
latch on

600
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:26,640
and that's how they become infected they

601
00:21:25,280 --> 00:21:28,559
can't have direct fecal

602
00:21:26,640 --> 00:21:29,919
contamination but generally that's

603
00:21:28,559 --> 00:21:33,280
that's where their

604
00:21:29,919 --> 00:21:35,039
um their infection comes from and

605
00:21:33,280 --> 00:21:37,039
so certainly that are worming your

606
00:21:35,039 --> 00:21:38,960
mothers very very important that

607
00:21:37,039 --> 00:21:40,320
you know in the just the weeks up to

608
00:21:38,960 --> 00:21:41,600
leading up to when your is going

609
00:21:40,320 --> 00:21:42,960
to have puppies

610
00:21:41,600 --> 00:21:44,640
that you should be wearing her to help

611
00:21:42,960 --> 00:21:45,679
decrease that warm burden that she might

612
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:49,039
have

613
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:53,039
uh another question that has come in um

614
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:56,159
what do you recommend to use for pups

615
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:57,039
yeah so um round rooms are your are your

616
00:21:56,159 --> 00:21:59,760
big concerns

617
00:21:57,039 --> 00:22:00,480
so you just make sure that you've got a

618
00:21:59,760 --> 00:22:03,120
product that's

619
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:04,640
that's going to cover that um there used

620
00:22:03,120 --> 00:22:07,280
to be some lovely

621
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:08,960
suspensions that we don't have available

622
00:22:07,280 --> 00:22:11,760
to us anymore

623
00:22:08,960 --> 00:22:12,159
you can make suspensions or get them

624
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:16,240
made

625
00:22:12,159 --> 00:22:18,559
for you by by crushing tablets up and

626
00:22:16,240 --> 00:22:19,520
um injecting them you know just

627
00:22:18,559 --> 00:22:21,039
instringing

628
00:22:19,520 --> 00:22:22,400
them into their mouths and you just got

629
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,039
to be careful the doses that you're

630
00:22:22,400 --> 00:22:24,559
using

631
00:22:23,039 --> 00:22:26,480
based on the kilogram of coffee that

632
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:28,240
you're you're treating

633
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:30,159
because getting a getting a worm tablet

634
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,640
down a puppy of two weeks of age ain't

635
00:22:30,159 --> 00:22:32,640
that easy

636
00:22:33,120 --> 00:22:38,000
cool so how do you know you've got the

637
00:22:35,280 --> 00:22:40,799
right dose

638
00:22:38,000 --> 00:22:42,640
uh that'll be that's basically um most

639
00:22:40,799 --> 00:22:45,760
worm tablets are

640
00:22:42,640 --> 00:22:47,679
are based on a on a per kilo basis

641
00:22:45,760 --> 00:22:49,360
so you weigh your puppies and goes to

642
00:22:47,679 --> 00:22:52,799
your heaviest puppy

643
00:22:49,360 --> 00:22:54,799
and you know if you're having

644
00:22:52,799 --> 00:22:56,400
trouble figuring out your amounts if if

645
00:22:54,799 --> 00:22:58,159
you're thinking of making a suspension

646
00:22:56,400 --> 00:22:59,679
make sure you talk to your battle sorted

647
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:00,720
out for you it's not a problem like we

648
00:22:59,679 --> 00:23:04,080
make up

649
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:06,559
um you know we'll crush a 10 kilogram

650
00:23:04,080 --> 00:23:07,520
tablet and and suspend it in 10 mls of

651
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:10,480
water so it's

652
00:23:07,520 --> 00:23:11,120
one mil per 10 per um kg so if you've

653
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:13,600
got a

654
00:23:11,120 --> 00:23:14,400
puppy that weighs 500 grams and you give

655
00:23:13,600 --> 00:23:17,600
them half a mil

656
00:23:14,400 --> 00:23:18,159
so there's those ways but please if

657
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:20,240
