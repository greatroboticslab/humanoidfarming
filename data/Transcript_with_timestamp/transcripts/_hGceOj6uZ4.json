  "text": "something that we did a couple of years ago to try to improve the traction on these R4 tires was grooving them all right so I bought a grooving tool off of Amazon I think it was around 100 bucks give or take and you heat it up and you basically it's got a little metal knife and you're just pushing through and cutting out little grooves it gives all these extra edges on here to get extra traction and slippery surfaces and mud just off-road applications and so the downside of these R4 tires is they just they're not great on Traction in a lot of areas and basically it can be an expensive Endeavor to completely replace all of your tires with a different tread pattern so for around 100 bucks give or take whatever that tool is you can enhance your traction on the existing tires that you have and for me in the last year and a half or two years whatever it's been I have definitely noticed an improvement a lot of other folks have been doing this too so maybe ask around in the forums and see what they think as well so if you want to find the tool we use we do have a link to it in our Amazon store you can find that through our website",
