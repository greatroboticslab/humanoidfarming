  "text": "my name is Michael Plum I work for iller where I'm responsible for a project on intensification of Livestock systems where feed is a is a key issue feed a key issue in terms of determining life productivity the overall economics of of a livestock system but also how much natural resources are we really using uh how much are we affecting the environment in terms of greenhouse gases so feed is really at the inter phase of say positive or negative effect of livestock so to me the the the kind of concluding sessions we had today was very interesting because obviously a lot of work has been conducted in the past on feed Resources with an overall very mixed uh success and obviously looking at all those very well sought new approaches in terms of Innovation System in terms of value chains uh which were applied in the in the ifat uh F adoption project in three sides Syria uh Vietnam and Ethiopia had the potential to really come up with new messages and and trying to new insights trying to understand uh where can we do better in the in future than than in the past what were key errors we committed in the past how can we remed and and so on and a lot of the the concluding session really was trying to to find those kind of of key messages in terms of what we can do better in in the future uh what kind of Concepts were developed and and proven by those projects for example look at feed resources in a wider context look at feed resources in terms of systems look at feed resources in terms of how they help to connect people to markets how they can improve value chain and I guess that key message came was was really realized and and accepted by by all the very diverse people in the in the different groups uh I was I was talking to which is certainly uh a very promising uh kind of of outcome of of that uh project because it used to be different in the past people were much more technical much more focused on very limited entry points so that's certainly a a very good outcome of the the project the workshop today couple of key issues where people felt uh we need to do more was trying to to understand those kind of of feed gaps feed demand better better in a way are we looking at current kind of production aims yeah are we only satisfying looking more at the kind of subsistence idea of of lar production or are we really committed to something we call L Revolution that we know demand for meat and milk will increase tremendously particularly in developing countries which gives tremendous opportunities for small holders to produce for those kind of markets however to be successful in producing those markets they need to produce more they need to produce more from fewer animals they need to be competitive and a couple of key issues around those those challenges so uh came out very clear from the from the workshop and and from the the kind of concluding meeting with had and one was really trying to understand what is a feed Gap are we defining feed gaps in terms of how much more want Farmers to produce more in at different scales at a household scale it could be at at a country scale uh so there were very very good ideas and insights in terms of how we can improve those kind of of feed resource demand and predictions and of course mitigation strategies coming from it in the future um couple of Interest interesting discussions in terms of uh are we focusing too much on the positive side of feeds feed supporting higher milk higher meat production higher income and are been necting so-called tradeoff effects what do we need to produce the feed we obviously need land increasingly we need water water is an issue water scarcity is an issue uh so there were serious discussions about do we need to do much more in terms of balancing positive and negative effects uh it's a very it's a very difficult uh decision and to me it was interesting to see that all the people from or most of the people from all the sites and from very different groups be it research be it extension uh very down the value chain they seem to agree that we should focus on transition trying to move people out of of poverty by increasing productivity by increasing their production for the markets and believing that once they can move out of of Agriculture by education by higher income or whatsoever uh that we are essentially looking at a new system in a couple of years down down the line perhaps less focus on very small Holdings like5 hectares one hectar which is the case in Vietnam and Ethiopia just because people have moved out of of Agriculture and L of production",
