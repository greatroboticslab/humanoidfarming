  "text": "good morning everyone are you enjoying the conference so far yeah good while I'm excited to be back here this year I wasn't sure I was going to be able to make it and so that I'm happy that I'm here the original intent for this session was for dan and I to make an announcement about some new projects and joint projects a joint project that we are working on rather than as a workshop so we're going to kick off with the description of some very exciting news and then after that I'll elaborate and expand on it a little bit and then we can have an open Q&A and talk about whatever it is that you like to talk about as we did last year and I've done several times before while I'm really personal what I'm really passionate about in this space of regenerative agriculture is having regenerative agriculture models become the standard become the status quo the mainstream globally around the world by 2040 that's why I found that advancing eco agriculture of why I'm doing the work that I'm doing why we started the podcast and freely readily share information make it available to everyone and one of the pieces that has become abundantly clear is that in order to understand regenerative agriculture agronomy well there are so many different areas of science that we need to understand growers need to know a little bit about horticulture they need to know a little bit about the genetics or I shouldn't say a little bit but actually a lot they need to know a lot about genetics a lot about 40 culture a lot about biochemistry biophysics plant pathology entomology there are so many integrated areas of science that all come together in understanding agriculture and plant production and this is a significant challenge this is a challenge for growers and it's also a challenge for us as a company when we hire someone to join our team our agronomy team and our consulting team we have a challenge we have set such an extremely high bar and a high standard of leadership and our team is expected to be extremely knowledgeable about all these different areas and be able to implement them in any given situation in the operate so when we hire someone to join our team one of our significant limiting factors to growth as a company is our ability to train people and get them to understand all these different areas we have had PhDs go through our training course we have a very intense training course and they have said that they learned more in the first 90 days of our training course and they did in their entire degree it's a very common feedback that we get so I believe it's very important to democratize information and to digitize information make it widely and readily available but the learning there is such a large volume and quantity of information that is valuable and needs to be learned and it takes time to process all of that and to assimilate all of that one of the questions that I've been thinking about a lot is how can we restrict that how can we remove that barrier to adoption and to grow if both for our team as a company and also for growers around the world so our over the last four years I have been thinking quite deeply about a project of digitizing all of our knowledge and putting together algorithms that take all this information and report results and make agronomic recommendations in exactly the same way that we do as consultants so this is obviously a significant challenge because there are so many interrelated areas and I'm quite I'm quite excited over the last few months we have begun actively working on this project as a for this moment we're calling it the AI agronomist our goal is by the end of next year this time next year to have a beta launched where people will be able to upload all of their soil analysis data plant SAP analysis irrigation water varieties be able to put in all their agronomic data that they have and we will be we have we will have very specific requests for information that is needed to make the information complete and the then the AI agronomist will give you specific recommendations for what types of soil amendments you might need or what types of microbial inoculants you might benefit from for what types of foliar applications you might benefit from what types of varieties might do well in your situation so there will be a tremendous amount of information flowing into the backend we will be collecting meteorological data lunar cycle data soil information so there's there's a lot of information that is publicly available there is also a lot of laboratory work that may need to be done on some farms to prepare us and get to this point but what I'm really excited about is that when we make this available all of a sudden someone who becomes interested in regenerative agriculture and wants to grow food in this way for the first time they can they can learn about it in December and in February they can have some guidance on what they are going to do on their farm it really it can supersede the learning process obviously the learning still needs to happen the education still needs to happen but this can help take all of this knowledge that is represented by so many scientists in the field and put it into a usable practical form that anyone can access and what I'm really excited about is that that is then not just available for growers here in North America where AEA is working a lot but also for growers in South America and in Africa and in Europe and in Asia and around the world so this I believe will be a foundational piece to making regenerative agriculture become the mainstream here's why I'm so excited about the conversation today many quote what really drives many growers decision making process and it's a very human tendency is rather than planning of how to prevent problems we react to problems and so many growers are looking for solutions to a specific insect pest or a specific disease so all of the information exists today to be able to identify the underlying nutritional issues that result in a specific insect pest being in a crop let's say that we have a potato farmer in Colorado who has 11 fields of potatoes it's possible for that potato grower to get an alert that says you need to begin scouting your potato fields for Colorado potato beetle because they're expected to emerge from winter dormancy in the next 24 to 48 hours and of your 11 fields field number 3 and field number 8 are very highly susceptible to infection field number 3 is susceptible because it has high levels of nitrates and has high levels of nitrates because you have low levels of molybdenum and you need to apply 50 grams of molybdenum to per acre to remove your susceptibility from a 9 down to a 2 field number 8 is very susceptible because it has low levels of magnesium you need to apply 5 pounds per acre of magnesium sulfate to move their susceptibility down to it too that completely changes the conversation the conversation is now no longer about you need to apply this insecticide it's about this is why you have the problem and this is what you can do to reverse it all the information already exists who put that platform together but nobody has done it yet and we intend to do it [Applause] thank you so those of you who know Noah's only been conspiring for one of the decade together and this has been one of our fantasy projects for many years and so to be able to be publicly announcing the fact that we're working on this together and you know there's a real timeframe in which this is going to occur I think is I'm just really honored and yeah exhilarated to be here I think the agreement we make about ten years ago was that John ago the for-profit and we coordinated magazines so that's pretty much what's been happening and we give each other a hard time about various things at various points in time but yeah to to build this framework out which we've you know established to a large degree with the open team with the you know all the data partners were working on with the real food campaign collaborative framework with companies and universities and organizations and farmers open source to look at the in field dynamics and then to be able to build the hardware that can do the sensing I think that's the one piece John didn't talk about was the ability to do in field assessment with spectrometer anybody who's been working with him do the plant set of analysis and harvesting the leaves and sending them off to Europe and spending hundreds of dollars a week and getting reports back two weeks later I think it's one of been one of John's really systemic frustrations over the past couple of years is how can we get this real-time in field data back sooner and you know the answer is if we can assess what's going on in the plant in real time with something like a spectrometer then we have the ability to actually take that you know whatever that investment is that you'd be spending on sampling leaves and sending them to the to Hollander Netherlands to be able to basically take two weeks of investment in in plants leaf samples and have a piece of hardware that you can use forever thereafter so it is a big complicated hairy audacious project and we don't working on it for a while and it's gonna require resources but you have to be able to formally announce this and really move forward actively and pulling an office is very exhilarating so this is John stage I just wanted to be here or he asked me to be here to confirm it as well so thank you all for being here and I'm sure you're gonna have a wonderful next hour [Applause] so I think one of the important pieces that Dan and I have agreed to collaborate on and our collective enterprises with advancing eco agriculture in the bio nutrient Food Association one of the strengths that we have is that we have a lot of historical data on a large scale forum right at this moment in time we have I don't know the exact count but we have several hundred thousand data points closer to a million than to the bottom end of the scale on that represent 48 different crops across the country 48 crops so those are 48 crops that we have a significant amount of data on and what we have learned in from experience is that many growers may have the best of intentions but they often lack the bandwidth and the resources to be able to collect samples in a timely manner during the growing season and so in our work at AEA in any area where we have a local concentration of growers we're working with large number growers we actually have our team our staff is out in the field collecting all the data they're doing all the sample collection and so our collaboration over the course as the spectrometer is developed we will be working closely with the spectrometer to develop all the data libraries and to match what is happening of what the what the spectrometer readouts are with historical sap analysis and based on simply on the volume of data that we go through in a single growing season or in as little as a few months we expect to be able to have a very strong data library to be able to use the spectrometer in the field to make management decisions very rapidly very quickly and dan is correct we have been dreaming about this for a decade so in fact I I first I first wrote that I wrote the first set of algorithms in the first outline for what we're now calling the AI agronomist in 2014 and I got done with this spreadsheet that was an absolute monstrosity and when I got done my last sentence at the bottom said we have everything that we need to make this work in real time except we don't have a sensor that can analyze nutritional profiles in the field so that's what we've been waiting for and certainly we can do it and we will be doing a lot of this with laboratory analysis even to to help develop the spectrometer but the eventual expectation is that if the spectrometer does well we believe it's going to be capable of doing we will have an infield tool imagine having an infield tool that could do a soil analysis that could do an irrigation water analysis that could do a leaf SAP analysis you can do all of those things and more so that's that's the dream and the aspiration that we're working toward it's all it's all good all right so Dan asked me to also speak a little bit about the some of the information that is going into the agronomist and some of the pieces that are behind it and it's really big and it's almost more than I can describe very quickly and easily but there are a few pieces that I will describe that I might be unexpected I'll focus on some of the unexpected pieces of the unanticipated pieces one of those is we were still reviewing data to make all the correlations and connections but it seems that there is a connection between overall plant health and performance and cosmic radiation as measured on the KP index and the Phi angle so you can there are a number of resources one that I enjoy out paying attention to is a website called space with their news and essentially it gives us when we look at sunspot activity and solar activity sunspot activity correlates to well first of all the the photons coming from the Sun can have either a negative or a positive charge they're not all the same and the charges that reach the Earth's surface depend on a number of different factors including the radiation shielding magnetic shields the event Allen belts etc and there is a counterpoint between silver radiation and cosmic radiation and what that means is that when we have periods of stronger solar radiation we have that actually strengthens the magnetic field protect the envelope protecting the earth and that effectively shields cosmic radiation coming in or you can have the opposite effect where you have very weak solar radiation and you have much stronger cosmic radiation coming in why is this important why should it matter well there's two reasons one is that solar the rgeous on the solar radiation actually influence plant health very strong that we've started observing a few years ago once as we really dialed in to plant health more and more we started observing that there could be periods of a few days or in some cases even a few weeks where solar radiation seemed to actually impact plants negatively rather than positive positively and of course that's the opposite of what you would expect to be happening that's when we first started looking at the qualities of solar radiation and how it varies and then of course for those of us thinking about biodynamic agriculture and when we plant seeds in alignment with various solar cycles and lunar cycles as as according to the various constellations all of a sudden it because we realize that the influence of cosmic radiation is also mediated by solar radiation so when you have very weak solar radiation which allows a lot of cosmic radiation to come through which is actually has happened a lot this last year then the influences of when you plant a seed in correlation to different constant the presence of different being in the presence of different constellations has a much bigger impact and this is another topic that is a bit out in left field for some people but I think it's a very important one what we have observed is that the timing at which you plant seeds according to in association with a given constellation has less of an impact in fact I can say that it has almost no impact on very challenged soils soils that have very low organic matter cells that have very little microbial activity you don't see much of a difference if you separate planting by a few dates by a few days but when you have high organic matter soils and you have really active microbial activity that difference becomes can become extremely pronounced so the healthier your farms are the healthier soils are the bigger of a difference you can make by selecting the dates of what you plant seeds so that was some far out of left field information what else is important obviously we're including all of the information on soil analysis plant beef analysis we expect it will take some time we don't yet have enough data it will take some time for us to develop the data on understanding which varieties correlate to given nutritional profiles and given environments but I expect there we will without let me back up just a moment when we first started using plant sap analysis in 2011 plant sap analysis really revolutionized our understanding of the interaction of minerals inside plants and how to best supply those minerals with implants because for the first time we had an accurate and an accurate window into what was actually happening what was actually going on we no longer had to guess and as a result of plant SAP analysis displacing tissue analysis on almost all the operations all the operations that we work with we there were some things that we expected to find and we learned a lot more that we didn't expect that we didn't know that we had no idea what's coming I expect the same will happen once we begin collecting all this initial information looking at all the correlations and on a digital platform we will be able to make correlations between specific nutritional profiles specific varieties that we can't anticipate and don't expect right now what we have observed already with the plant SAP analysis is that the genetics the given variety of a crop has a tremendous influence on absorption of nutrients from the soil we know that we can have two different varieties dan and with his work here at the BFA has described how you can have the same variety of carrots and have radically different nutritional profiles from different soils but the other additional element is that if you then take those that one variety and you put it onto the optimal soil the soil where it really thrives the best you can plant another variety right beside it that might now have three times a higher nutritional profile in the original variety so there are also varietal differences and then to add another layer the nutritional the these various varieties will perform differently on different soils so on one soil or in one environment where the original variety tested might not do well it might not have a good nutritional profile there is another variety that might have a 5x higher nutritional profile on that soil so there are both varietal differences in soil differences that we expect to be able to correlate once we have more of the information or the data to be able to do that so I'd like to open it for questions do you have any questions on what we're working on and or suggestions on what you would like to see when are we releasing the AEA planting calendar don't know I haven't thought about that we actually did release a couple years ago the AEA foliar spraying calendar and that one is still in existence and floating around somewhere it's been a while since I spoke about that but we observed a very distinct 28-day cycle with plant absorption of nutrients the original observation occurred with the Dutch team and the Netherlands that developed sap analysis they observed when they were working with hydroponic growers they would measure not only the the SAP analysis but also the quantity of nutrients that came through their hydroponic system so how many nutrients were left in the water at the end of each week and they discovered a very distinct cycle where one week out of the four and I can't remember which which is which right now I'd have to reference the calendar but out of the total four-week cycle one week out of the four plants absorbs 75% of all the nutrients in the water two weeks out of 450 percent and the one week out of four which was two weeks out of phase with the seventy-five percent they only did 25 percent so radically different absorption of nutrients from the soil based on the lunar cycle so we've actually been able to correspond to that and try to better time when we put on foliar applications and when we put on irrigation applications for some crops for growing high-value food and vegetable crops it really doesn't matter because we're going to be doing it constantly all the time but for crops where we're only putting on three to five applications per season timing those applications to match up with the lunar cycles gives us a tremendous crop response and a much greater efficiency for the products that we're actually applying so and again this what I get excited about is that I can be here having this conversation with you talking about lunar cycles and we have the PDF published somewhere on the advancing iko iko cultural website but now we will be able to take that information and put it into a recommendations engine to say you need to put on your soil amendment applications you need to put on your biological applications this week don't put them on in two weeks from now put them on this week and you'll get a much bigger soil health response and much bigger crop response all of a sudden that information that can be shared verbally and trained and needs to be also becomes immediately executable and implementable by everyone around the world that's what I'm excited about yeah yes reduction treaty on time this is to only have been academic so all this data are assembling analyzed against a great exciting there's a dark I incident after the first is that of a social scientist which is that this is still operating very much limited mention paradigm of acupuncture proficiencies the remedy that would power inputs we're for this and the measurements you have a second reality essential chemical use biology as a remedy you don't analyze violence or biology as a cause for some of these things that's very active do i I can see that I see someone is reinforcing business model or farmers are not investigators diagnosticians analysts problem solvers and the worth becomes our automatons there was a really comprehensive recommendation you as apartments do what they're told that's building into this this is fundamentally the biological yeah yes so thank you for that comment I have you've raised a couple of different points so to the first of influencing and managing biology rather than purely taking a chemistry approach the I I've framed spoken about primary to the chemistry piece because of the implications of course the spectrometer that Dan is developing however the the information that we're collecting we are also measuring a number of different soil parameters including infiltration rates and we're you're correct on those of microbial assays those are a challenge because we need a microbial assay that is both quantitative and qualitative at the same time it's we it's not enough to just identify the presence of an organism we also need to know the quantity of a given organism present and as of yet there isn't technology capable of doing that but there there is qualitative information on when we look at soul aggregation we can do some analog metrics and we are using those analog metrics and we are also making recommendations for compost applications for what types of cover crops for use for what type of tillage to use or not to use and our entire the way we're framing the entire conversation in the engine that we're developing is to shift the thinking to in two ways one is to think about the cause of the problem rather than just the symptom and the second is to think about the or to have the recommendations emphasize the biological solution not the chemistry solution so I failed to mention that that is important then to your point on the sociological implications every time a recommendation is made this will take some time to develop of course because there's so many explanations but every time a recommendation is made we want anyone to be able to challenge that why is this recommendation being made and immediately for us to provide a reference and a link that they can look and say okay this is why we made the recommendation this way to give people the capacity to see that learn that and also to disagree with it and give us feedback and then to your extreme example of our idea of farmers becoming automatons is what many farmers do today so very different from that yeah but I think this you raise an important question it's certainly something that we have thought about that we need to think more about the the desire is to completely change the relationship with the crop that they're growing because I very strongly believe that one of the significant failures that we have in our agriculture today is that our agriculture has no soul it has no heart there is no longer a heart connection with the plants that we're producing it's become very mechanistic very intellectual and that in order for us we know that if we want to produce food that has the capacity to produce I'll use the words spiritual coherence food needs the plants need to be grown with love they need to grow be growing with heart they respond to that and there's a lot of information behind this again this might be coming really out of left field for some people if you want to dig more deeply into this I very highly recommend stephen hara Buner series of three books the first is titled the lost language of plants the second is the secret teachings of plants and the third is plant intelligence yes the first book is the lost language of plants the second is the secret teachings of plants and the third is plant intelligence Steven Buner is perhaps my favorite author for his writing style I purchased every book that he ever wrote even the ones not related to agriculture because so much enjoyed reading his writing but those three books are perhaps my three personal favorites they are absolutely incredible and I'll just give you one hint I've gifted these books to many different people and many people particularly the lost language of plants when they start reading it they can't put it down there I have had people read for 26 hours straight to finish the book more than one person more than a handful and to give you just a glimpse of some of the pieces that Steven speaks about I can't possibly begin to do justice to all the topics that he covers he describes the science of plant human communication but he also and he described the science of plant to human heart communication it's not just an intelligent process or an intellectual process and in the in the last of the three books plant intelligence he describes plant neural networks and this one I read a lot I'm not often surprised I was surprised and delighted by the book of plant intelligence he describes how we historically have thought of human intelligence in the context of the brain the brain being a specific organ with a number of neurons large number of neurons and as our thinking has evolved we realized that it's not just a brain but there's actually a tremendous number of neurons in our digestive system in our gut there's a lot of neurons around our heart and that we need to think of intelligence not in terms of brain capacity intellectual capacity but in terms of neural networks and so when we begin thinking about neural networks this is from from our neural network in our body that's why we can actually have a conversation about heart cognition recognizing what's happening with our hearts and also why we many times may use the words I have a gut feeling about something because we do have a gut feeling about something what really rocked me was the realization that plants have the exact same neural networks as we do and not when I say the exact same neural networks not only the their neural network is all the growing root tips all the growing root tips are all connected and the the neurotransmitters that plants use are have many similarities the neurotransmitters that humans use as well in fact the single dominant neurotransmitter in both plants and humans is serotonin plant neurotransmission is based on serotonin and serotonin derived compounds and molecules so when we start thinking about plant intelligence many annual species have smaller root systems and they don't have a neural network that is perhaps as large as ours but when you start talking about perennial species particularly you have a large mature tree the neural network of a tree is significantly larger than the neural network of most people so now which who really carries the most wisdom so I would really encourage everyone to dive into that a bit more deeply yes there is the reality is what what has brought me to this project and the reason I started hosting the regenerative agriculture podcast was learning that there is so much valuable information out there as as Elaine's work and I could give a long list of scientists work who have done incredible research that is not generally applied in production agriculture and an example of this is occasionally I've had the desire for some time to put together resource that on a collection of all the peer-reviewed published papers that correlate the presence of a specific insect or disease in a crop particularly insects with a given nutritional profile and I started this project a few weeks ago and when I started I thought oh there's probably a couple hundred papers out there and on two weeks in and the project is going to have to be some at some point I'm gonna have to define boundaries and limits because it just keeps spreading and spreading and there's thousands of papers not hundreds my point being simply that there is a tremendous amount of information that isn't widely practiced and the intent for the podcast was to be able to make that easily accessible to growers and producers and then the next step of course is how do we clearly and simply describe in which situations they can apply it and how they can apply it so I don't know did I give a reasonable answer to your comment was my best shot yes good question that I haven't thought about so the question what the question was AEA has expressed the has the expressed intent of developing nutritional and microbial products that are so effective that they eventually displace the needs to be used that the soil health and plant helped it also such a point that you don't need to use the products anymore and we have quite a number of farms who have reached that goal now and that's personally quite exciting to me at least so the question the question was at what point does the AI agronomist become redundant and no longer necessary and so I would say there's there are two points that come to mind and I have not thought about that question that's a really great question and I am going to spend a lot of time thinking about it but I would say part one is that when you again when the overall ecosystem reached such a general reaches a state of such vibrant health that it is self-sustaining then you don't need to be constantly doing the monitoring and measuring and the second thought that comes to mind is I see this also I desire it to be a tool for education about specific problems because so many times when I teach webinars and I teach at conferences questions and I teach a lot about general principles and concepts and questions are often very specific what do do I do about X and I want the agronomist to be completely enough that a grower can able be able to ask the question what do I do about X and find the answer for almost any pest so then as as that learning process evolves for the grower and he understands and learns why we have this challenge and why we have that challenge of what we can do about them it has farming management shifts on that educational pathway the reality is that a shift to a regenerative agriculture doesn't really happen in the field it happens in here and in here and so as that shift happens then the reality is as if when we are successful in in growers in developing that close connection to their crops and to their environment have such a vibrant state of health and at that point I would say the tool becomes redundant there's no longer as a need for that because they're in tune with what's happening on what's going that's kind of my off-the-cuff answer without having thought about it yes have you taken into consideration climate change events the answer is yes the short answer is yes the long answer is a really long answer well there are a few pieces one is that a truly regenerative agriculture first is inherently much more climate resilient healthy plants what we've observed is that the water consumption or the water requirements by really healthy plants drops by at least 50% in some cases more that's a huge water savings that I think has not yet been recognized I haven't heard anyone else talk about that at all and then of course when you have really healthy soils the soils resilience the capacity to store and hold water also increases tremendously and the combination of those two effects and the changes that are happening within plant biochemistry also greatly increase the plants resistance to high and low temperatures so you can have environments that are a lot warmer without having the same degree of stress impact and environment that are locked colder how much colder we've been able to lower the one data point that we have at this point that we've quantified is that we're able to reduce a plant's freezing temperature by about six degrees Fahrenheit very consistently so wherever a given variety or species might be we can drop that about six degrees Fahrenheit with nutrition on the temperature increased side we don't yet have enough experience to know how much we know that we can significantly now all those pieces that I mentioned are all outcomes those are all results of a regenerative agriculture system the question to think about or that you raised is what are the implications of a changing climate in making recommendations to a degree I mean the reality is that we will be directly measuring soil respiration for example soil microbial activity will be directly measuring the release of carbon dioxide from the soil profile will be directly measuring plants respiration and photosynthesis cal almost micro indicators of what's happening at the macro level with within climate change yeah those are my thoughts my short answer I don't know if that answers your question adequately yes Julie why do plants only need it half as much water there's two major pieces the first is that when plants absorb nutrition in the form of simple ions particularly nitrate in a conversation I think I saw a Lydia oliviers here and will be speaking again this afternoon speaking yesterday he pointed out how when plants absorb just nitrate instead of amino acid nitrogen that by itself can increase their water requirement by 50 percent in addition to that when do I have that correct Olivia yes water use efficiency so the second aspect is the quantity of water required for respiration so you have essentially fundation Li to metabolic processes going on with implants that consume water one of them is photosynthesis the second is respiration respiration occurs amongst other reasons primarily largely for cooling and when you have a healthy plant that has a glossy waxy leaf surface high lipid content high fat content it conducts heat much better and reflects heat much better the bottom line is that it cools the plants much more efficiently and there's much less water required for plant cooling so when you have high temperatures when you have when you're growing plants and really hot conditions for many of our food crops that's the see three photosynthetic pathway plants that's above 86 degrees Fahrenheit when you go above 86 degrees Fahrenheit the quantity of water required to cool a healthy plant versus an unhealthy plant is also significantly less I don't know how much less but I know it's a big number we got a question over here yes yes yes it is possible and it is possible simply by changing the soils paramagnetism so when you have very high paramagnetism in the soil profile that fixes the problem we had a question yes oh my goodness the rabbit hole just gets deeper and deeper so the question the question was thinking about solar radiation and that we are coming into a solar minimum both a solar minimum on the short solar cycle and a grand solar minimum at the same time what are the implications for having cooler summers and cooler growing conditions yes so what are the implications for the next few years and at what point do we shift back out of that cycle so first of all this is not my area of expertise I have been learning a lot about this in the last couple of years or trying to it's my understanding that right now we are so we have a what is it a 10 or 11 year solar cycle think of Tinian 11-year solar cycle peak to trough and we are right now approaching the bottom of the trough so the expectation is in the next 2 to 3 years we are likely to have cooler summers and so how do we manage that I think the implications for us is that we should expect that we will probably have harder winters we'll probably have a harder winter this winter for the next couple of years and we should expect a tendency towards having later frost in the spring and earlier Frost in the fall by a week or two I don't expect there to be any significant outliers more than what we've already been observing for the last 2 10 years then the longer solar cycle the the grant what is referred to as the grand solar cycle we are also approaching the bottom of the trough are starting to go on the downhill slope we've been on the uphill slope of the ground solar cycle for the last 20 to 30 years and now we're we've crossed that threshold we're starting to go back down so I think there's a longer cycle of cooling as well the reality is that we have to look at what is it that we can manage that can make a difference and what we can manage that makes a difference is we can manage soil health and organic matter at capacity to hold water and we can measure plant health and resilience to temperature extremes when we do those two things by managing plant nutrition by managing soil health we have created a lot of resilience and a lot of or into the system that's what we can manage and that's what we need to do particularly for the next few years that answer your question move to Georgia [Laughter] look at what happened in North Dakota and Montana this year farmers had crops buried in snow on a significant scale so we'll probably see more of that happening in northern climates yeah yes so the question was in the southern climate on a farm in Virginia should I begin planting crops that might do better in a more northern climate or not more colder climate here's what you should expect you should expect more extreme climate variability there will be hotter longer there were longer more intense periods of hot weather and longer more intense periods of cold weather we will see more extremes so and we will see both of those within the same season sometimes within weeks of each other that's the climate that we as the climate that exists now and that's why developing climate resilience becomes so important yes a nose and the principal's nachos weapon Dacians you see that yes exactly that's what I'm talking about get all it could you guys hear that yeah absolutely yes so I know there's a few more questions out there but we've been circling around this conversation around the importance of biology which is foundational fundamental I talked about it quite a bit last year for those of you that were present then I hosted one of my most fascinating podcast interviews yet a few days ago it's being post the beginning of December I was dr. James white from Rutgers University he's published a number of white papers but I want to give you just just the synopsis of his work so he has been he didn't originate the term but he's been popular xoring that popularizing the term of rise of Ag rise of Ag simply means root feeding or root eating and he has identified for those of you who've listened to me on the podcast on webinars and in live presentations you know that I'm very passionate about the idea that plants can absorb microbial metabolites that they are not dependent on absorbing simple ions from the soil solution and that if we were to change plant nutrition but to the one when plants begin absorbing the majority of their nutrition as microbial metabolites plant health and the system's resilience everything begins changing everything changes very quickly well there's been actually a surprising amount of science around plant absorption of microbial metabolites over the course of the last 60 to 70 year but it hasn't certainly hasn't caught mainstream attention and I'm really hopeful that James work does but the foundational idea has been that you have a growing root tip and this growing root tip the cells here at the end are this tip is actually surprisingly porous and you have bacteria and algae and fungi and all these organisms in the soil profile that are actually absorbed into the root they penetrate into the root to go inside the root and they begin living completely inside the plant they have a symbiotic relationship here and there this is referred to when plants live excuse me when biology lives inside a plant that referred to as being endophytes so you may have heard of endo fright free fresque you for example ran to fight free plants so particularly he's he's observed and documented fungi and bacteria and algae to move into plants then once they're inside the plant root they begin moving back through the root system and in this pathway the root system are the root cells release superoxide and they oxidize all the cell membranes so the cell membranes are oxidized and now all of the organelles and and all of the nutrients contained inside the cell are available for the plant to absorb and plants actually absorb these macromolecules through a process known as endocytosis so endocytosis has been known in animals and in human cells for a long time and it's been postulated in in plant cells since the 60s and 70s but the idea of endocytosis is essentially that you have a cell which and then when you have the exposure of a macro molecule on its side which theoretically should be impossible to absorb yeah I say theoretically discount that is not possible for a salt to absorb based on the presently accepted science of cell physiology and cross membrane transfer with pumps and so forth what actually happens is that the cell adapts its membrane into a balloon form this begins moving in this direction and ultimately it becomes ompletely completely encapsulated and this entire organelle or this entire can be a chunk of RNA or DNA or peptides or enzymes or whatever these macromolecules are absorbed into the plant cells so and on this pathway through the growing through the root system or through the root tip or right behind immediately behind the root tip this process of endocytosis is happening but not all the biology is killed in this process some of it survives the process of having its cell membrane stripped and then when it's at some point it moves out to the outer part of the root and it triggers the formation of root hair and they actually move out through root hair and they circulate for a while here at the tip and then they move out through the root hair tip into the soil profile and then when they're in the soil profile the plant root actually feeds them it begins exiting in that particular location it begins exiting a lot of carbohydrates and other Connells it actually provides all the nutrients that the bacteria or fungi or algae need to reform their cell membranes because these are now essentially naked cells without a cell membrane and it gives them everything they need to reform their cell membranes and essentially farms if it's plants farm microbes the exact same way that we farm livestock they are feeding the microbes here and then this population obviously propagates through the soil along the root system goes back down to the root and now the plants or following root tips that are coming along behind this primary root tip access these nutrients from this biology rise of Ag yes there's it was a dynamite interview I'm going to be posting a number of his peer reviewed pipe papers which are really really good but in as if this and by the way this was an incredible interview these were the last 15 minutes the first 45 minutes were probably even better than this or as good and he said one thing that really gave me a lot to think about so I've also said many times based on conversations that I've had with Don Huber and other plant pathologists that it is possible when we change so when we have a soil that has really active microbial populations and they're the correct characteristics the right biology of present we can develop what is called a disease suppressive soil and it's been my understanding in the past that when we have a disease suppressive soil it will take it will change the expression of all of these potential pathogens such as verticillium and for Syria and so forth to be sacrificed decomposers of nonliving plant residue so they are still present but they're having a beneficial impact as a saprophyte but James said that's not incorrect but it's incomplete when you have let's say you have a strand of the cerium out here this is obviously I'm a great artist when you have path potential when you have organisms that are potential pathogens in the soil profile these endophytes that have this close symbiotic relationship with the plant will actually colonize the Fuss area or the verticillium or any potential pathogen and when they colonize it they weaken it they extract some of the sugars out of it some of the food sources that it has but they're an important pieces that they change its behavior and it's no longer a pathogen it actually changes and it now develops into an end of fight and it develops a symbiotic relationship with the plant instead of being a pathogen isn't that amazing [Applause] so we had we had a quite a fascinating conversation there is one other piece that I think is necessary pointing out so the end of fights that he described all of these organisms that had this endo FIDIC relationship with the plant a symbiotic relationship with the plant come from two places there is significant overlap between the microbial population that should be present in a healthy soil and the microbial population on the seed coat and I asked the question about what happens when we treat seeds with fungicides what happens when we treat vegetable seeds with hot hot water to remove bacteria and he said that we definitely do damage the microbial population on the seed which has a really predisposes that plant to pathogenic invasion in the early stages of life but and then I specifically asked the question about corn and he pointed out that many of our modern corn varieties and I asked about corn but realizing now that this is true not just of corn but actually for a number of different plants he said that when plants are propagated at some point during the breeding processes when they are propagated by cell culture they lose all of their endophytes on the seed itself so now when you begin so what is what he's observed is that many of our modern corn varieties no longer carry their protective organisms on the seed they are now very disease susceptible so this is something that's true for corn but I would say the logical to extrapolate that that is likely to be true for any seed or any plant which has been propagated by cell culture yes so the question was do I know if the end of fights are entering the meristematic area when the cells are different still differentiating I remember James talking about that in some of his papers but I don't remember what he said well what we do know from dr. May Wong hos work she described how we have significant transfer of genetic material between the soil biology and plants and I suspect this is one pathway that we haven't been aware of in the past for significant transfer of genetic material I mean we know that it's been well documented when we have a genetically modified plant we end up with genetically modified DNA in the soil microbial profile in a matter of a few days or weeks yeah so that that actually that actually would it would be when we look at all of the various mechanisms and means for plant signaling for plants signaling the slow microbial population what nutritional requirements that it has what nutrients that it wants the soil microbes to release this is probably another signaling mechanism other signaling pathway in addition to all the biochemical signals that we have identified and defined so far yeah I get pretty excited about this nice there's a bit of a puzzle which this helps to explain can you speak up just a little bit important seeds with facility versus uncoated seeds germinated faster Wow yeah you know what James work and not just James work but other researchers also similar to what you described what they tell me about soil biology there are no bad guys we created the bad guys by our mismanagement of the ecosystem that's it or by the system ecosystem being mismanaged in some manner yes so I'm I'm trying to I want to make sure I understand your question correctly are you asking how do we transfer this information how can you transfer this information to other growers or how can you transfer this information to consumers yes an important question and one that I don't have an easy answer for so to the point that consumers can become drawers and I believe they should I believe everybody should have a closer connection with their food I believe we need to bring back the Victory Gardens actually we would have victory over a lot of diseases and degenerative illnesses and mental challenges and more wouldn't we if that were to happen I'm reminded of a quote that Arden Anderson repeated over and over again he said when the student is ready the teacher will appear and I my personal experience has been that I have found it to be generally unproductive to try to persuade someone who has no desire to learn and the good news is that today there are so many people who do desire to learn that there is a tremendous desire for knowledge and information which is why I've tried to share as much online as I have and I really believe that it is very valuable for any of us - for all of us to become teachers because when we become teachers is when we really begin to learn the most rapidly so those are my comments and response to your question didn't really answer your question yes can you speak up just a little bit [Music] where I went to school involved through that problems I was using or the exacerbation of the issues hi this goes back a while and in my file recently but I'm also a student society takes the information that they exchange No I yes yes we have the trickle-down [Music] [Applause] [Laughter] society the biggest challenge I think is not only people having an emotional relationship to the earth but developing a real heart as well as my relationship to each other yeah I to speak to that a bit well there's a few comments that come to mind but actually I see I come from a very different background growing up in an Amish community and working primarily outside the Amish community I've come to appreciate many of the values that that community holds particularly the value the the strong family and community and social structure and I think one of the significant strengths is that young children growing up have a sense of place of who they are in a social fabric but I also want to speak to your comment about the best available technology yes go ahead education which is experience the way it trickles down to Farmington learned from experience you learn from doing and the brain is hardwired you learn something too by experiencing it cannot forget it and you also have to somebody else it's a safe so American see internet world expression within everyone here is going to be a teacher yes yes good comment thank you at speaking to regenerative agriculture and in this this different cognition about agriculture ecosystems becoming the best available technology there has been a significant shift in our work at AEA with the new people who contact us for the first time up until four or five years ago generally and I'm speaking specifically now about large scale mainstream growers who have hundreds or often thousands of acres of fruit and vegetable crops often the conversation would be something like historically the conversation would be something along the lines of I've heard about the work you're doing it seems really interesting and I'd like to try it on a few of my acres I'd like to try it out and just see what's happening on what's going on today we have people calling us and they say I've listened to all of your podcasts I've listened to all of your webinars and I want to do it on 800 acres that has happened a number of times right yes [Music] unfortunately there wasn't a pinch that's junk [Music] [Music] Barry and Karina I mean he's not a whole lot today in fact Korean actress Margaret was like about formulas mafia but what's interesting is early on the recommendation was like I needed channels plants were sufficient channels so actually this is actually a contradiction for psycho theory would be more putting on nitrogen and actually later in the process testing later I was recommending nitrogen and whereas the new treatment cycle theory would have been saying well no at that point you should be putting on I'm wondering if you know about the second theory as you can tell I love learning and I read a lot I'm not intimately familiar with corian natural farming I have heard a bit about it the question that I would love to ask you is did you try both of them great so we learned something oh my goodness yep in one instance what I did I was still using her County a shell awesome we learn something again no I think I can just say simply that our products and our approach to plant nutrition continue to evolve every year and they're completely different now from what they were ten years ago because we continue to learn things just as the example that you that you described and from my perspective there is just the ultimate report card the ultimate report card is plant health when you have a healthy plant that is nutritious has higher nutritional levels that is resistant to diseases and insects then something is working and if you don't whatever you're doing is not working and I am open to any and all pathways that get us to that point that's to me that's the bottom line nutritional products microbial products compost teas etc those are all a tool to get to that pathway yes we do we think very much about plant reproductive cycles vegetative cycles etc it's everything is based on that really yes [Music] we will never be successful at least like I mean that can't be done by people on it it cannot actually I think that's I think that's an important question to ask so we can read the first reference to foods implications for spiritual knowledge coming from Rudolf Steiner Rudolf Steiner in the period when he was teaching described how food produced at that time did not have enough I'm looking for the right word didn't have enough spiritual grounding didn't have enough spiritual sustenance to allow people to develop their spiritual connection with plants and I I dislike the word spiritual because it today carries too many other connotations but to develop that heart cognition with plants so he pointed that out decades ago and speaking from personal experience yes I am very stringent about the quality of the food that I eat and I actually noticed my mental acuity and mental clarity is the first thing that goes when my diet starts dropping off and where I have the most significant challenges when I travel to work with farmers in the Midwest the Midwest is a good food desert and so to first of all when I am at home and when I have good control over over the food that I eat I definitely try to make good sure that I have a very good diet high levels of healthy fats and in spite of all that I'm not able to grow all of my own food although I do and my family and I do a significant amount and I supplement intensely I supplement all the time because I don't have confidence in the food supply to be able to give my body everything that it requires for optimal performance similar to a plant I don't care about average performance I've experienced average performance in my life and I don't want to be back there again [Music] [Music] they're small but all together yes so the brief answer just kind of has a general broad umbrella is that it is possible to either sequester or I'll just use the word detoxify it is possible to detoxify every toxic element that we know of from an elemental perspective speaking about cadmium and arsenic and lead at etc etc it's possible to remove all of those from the soil profile or sequester them in a form that they are not absorbed by the plants that we're growing there's a lot of research in the literature about how this can happen with humic substances and also how specific plants and this this is where when you start when you are you have a specific situation with specific known toxins then you can begin identifying plants that are known to sequester those toxins and either remove them from the soil or transmute them to a form that they no longer show up and by the way hemp is one of the plants that does a lot of different things extraordinarily well when it comes to removing toxins from the soil profile it actually absorbs them into the plant in many cases so it's really interesting cannabis producers are discovering significant challenges because when the the cannabis plant and hemp in general is so extraordinarily good at picking up toxins that when you have cadmium or arsenic in the soil profile and part per billion or part per trillion concentrations they will pick it up and accumulate it in a high concentration within the plant itself you composted and put it somewhere else or actually maybe you create biochar out of it I mean I don't know the answers to those questions but at least we're able to remove it from a broad area and perhaps concentrate it more so the answers are out there we'll be able to validate all this yeah and the other the other aspect of course in addition to the elemental toxins are the hydrocarbons and again more there's actually quite a bit of research and both laboratory and field validation that were in the process of right now but I think a year ago I spoke about a new product that we're developing we released it in Pennsylvania use it in Pennsylvania this last growing season it's if all goes well with a regulatory process it'll be released for use by next spring across the entire country and laboratory evidence suggests that we can eliminate all toxins all herbicides all hydrocarbons from the soil profile in when the biology is sustained and has enough carbohydrates enough of a food source it can happen in a matter of weeks and that is pretty exhilarating does not include plastics as in the still solid plastic form unfortunately you know one of my mentors Bruce tiny Oh actually develops a microbe in the lab or shouldn't say devotee found it in the wild and cultured it in the lab that consumed PVC and he had a flask in his lab that was consuming four pounds of PVC per 24 hour period and he eventually dumped it and tossed it back into the environment because he couldn't find an off switch he couldn't find a way to get them to slow down and can you imagine well first there's there's a part of me that would love to release something like that into the oceans and then I also imagine what would be possible if somebody dumped some of that down their drain in a city yeah so yeah but I think knowing that history knowing that Bruce was once able to isolate an organism that was successful in doing that gives me hope and confidence that that will happen again in the future somebody will able to be able to replicate that in the future when the crisis becomes big enough we will figure out the we are I mean there is now very good evidence that for instance mangrove Ecology's utilizing the carbon polyester inserted that polyethylene resistant to any microbial organization 500 years but there is an accelerating as partners for better or worse in Jersey Plastics very much absolutely yeah and I know there's also been research about wax moths being able to consume plastic films very rapidly so I think that is encouraging again and that is because of the microbes that are contained within their digestive system actually being capable of breaking down many different plastics so I'm I'm I'm very concerned about the particular micro plastics that we have in the environment today I think there is cause for grave concern there but I'm not without hope that we'll find a solution for it so we've got time for one more question yes you got it registration but I go to events I went to the national basis I always ask the audience who's here depends on agriculture who's here on the road I hear the world record so hearing us talk today about education I have none is anyone here from a land trust no one can consult with okay I'll take in because of that question I'll take time for one more yes we'll go to you what's your opinion so to the point that we made about corn breeding through cell culture not having the end of fights it's obvious that modern many modern breeding techniques or some modern breeding techniques have stripped the seeds of their associated disease resistance organisms and endophytes but the reality is that as I see it the large agro chemical corporations that are perceived of being in control the food supply actually has extremely shaky foundations I don't expect them to survive on their present business model into the future for the long term because of the point that was made earlier is that they are no longer the best technology best available technology and they are particular they're no longer the best available technology for the large-scale broadacre growers in one specific way that is extremely important and that is farm profitability we know that farm profitability has been on the decline in fact broadacre cropping in the midwest have consumed equity on their operations for four years out of the last five except for those farmers who are planting non-gmo seeds those farmers who are growing cover crops those farmers who are adopting these various practices and going down this pathway there those growers have higher profitability they don't particularly necessarily have higher yields but they consistently have higher profitability at the very least those farmers are going to be the farmers that survive financially and economically so the existing status quo is not doesn't seem probable to me to remain as the status quo for another let's say 10 to 15 year time period not much past that point because it can't sustain itself and it also depends on has dependent historically on an abundance of rich topsoil which it has eroded and degraded and caused to disappear when that disappears my own personal story in the story the gentleman here shared earlier is that and it's a story of many farmers is that many farmers that make the switch is that they use conventional mainstream practices until they didn't work anymore why do we get calls today not just from fruit and vegetable growers or broadacre growers you say I have listened to all the information I've tried to learn as much as I can I want to do my entire operation that is happening because they recognize that what they're doing right now and have been doing historically is no longer working that is reaching critical threshold so I'm actually very optimistic that I've set the goal for myself if I want regenerative agriculture to be the global mainstream but 2040 to me that's a very realistic and a very achievable goal and we're well on the pathway to achieving that [Applause]",
