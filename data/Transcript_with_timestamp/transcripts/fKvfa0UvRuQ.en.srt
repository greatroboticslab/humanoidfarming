00:00:08,320 --> 00:00:12,000
living on the prairies here in

5
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:13,920
saskatchewan canada

6
00:00:12,000 --> 00:00:15,679

on my channel i

8
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,760
enjoy making videos on cold climate

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:22,240
gardening

10
00:00:19,760 --> 00:00:23,279
how to grow indoors during long cold

11
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:25,680
winters

12
00:00:23,279 --> 00:00:28,400
along with sharing recipe ideas made

13
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:32,000
with ingredients grown in my garden or

14
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:34,239
locally sourced so in today's video i'm

15
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:37,440
going to show you how to make a cooling

16
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:38,879
herbal body and facial spray using fresh

17
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:40,239
herbs from my garden

18
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:42,320
so here on the prairies we're about

19
00:00:40,239 --> 00:00:44,800
halfway through our growing season so i

20
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,840
have been busy collecting herbs

21
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:51,120
flowers weeds that i enjoy using

22
00:00:47,840 --> 00:00:53,840
for cooking storing over the winter

23
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:56,960
and also to make a variety of different

24
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:59,039
natural body care products

25
00:00:56,960 --> 00:01:01,359
so making hydrosols from your garden

26
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:03,520
plants is very easy to do

27
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:04,479
and it has a lot of different uses that

28
00:01:03,520 --> 00:01:06,479
i will

29
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:08,240
go through with you and later on in this

30
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:10,640
video

31
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:13,119
so let's head into my kitchen and i will

32
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:14,960
show you how to steam distill your herbs

33
00:01:13,119 --> 00:01:16,320
flowers and plants to make a hydro

34
00:01:14,960 --> 00:01:18,400
okay so i'm just going to run you

35
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:20,080
through all the equipment you need to

36
00:01:18,400 --> 00:01:23,439
set up your very own

37
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:24,720
steam distiller it should be easy to put

38
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,240
together with things that you have

39
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:29,680
around in your house

40
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:32,240
so first of all you just need a deep pot

41
00:01:29,680 --> 00:01:34,079
and a lid that fits on securely you'll

42
00:01:32,240 --> 00:01:36,720
be inverting the lid

43
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:38,240
this way a clear one is kind of nice

44
00:01:36,720 --> 00:01:42,159
because then you can actually see

45
00:01:38,240 --> 00:01:42,880
the steam distilling process happening

46
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:47,040
so

47
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:49,920
you need one of those you need a couple

48
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:50,880
dishes that are oven safe make sure that

49
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:53,439
they are

50
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,479
can withstand some heat so i'm going to

51
00:01:53,439 --> 00:01:57,840
be using this

52
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,280
little ramekin as the base and

53
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:01,200
something that's got quite a wide

54
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:03,439
opening in here because this is going to

55
00:02:01,200 --> 00:02:05,280
catch the steam from the lid

56
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:07,200
and that will sit on top so just make

57
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:10,640
sure it's something that

58
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:13,840
can sit securely so you'll be putting it

59
00:02:10,640 --> 00:02:13,840
inside the pot like this

60
00:02:14,319 --> 00:02:19,360
so like that and all your herbs and

61
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:22,160
water are going to go around

62
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:25,120
this area it's best if you're using

63
00:02:22,160 --> 00:02:25,120
distilled water

64
00:02:25,680 --> 00:02:33,280
and of course whichever herbs flowers

65
00:02:30,000 --> 00:02:36,160
buds leaves whatever kind of

66
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:37,200
your favorite plant that you want to use

67
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:40,480
in this

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:42,160
process have those ready they can be

69
00:02:40,480 --> 00:02:43,440
dried or they can be freshly picked

70
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,000
right out of the garden it doesn't

71
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:46,000
really matter

72
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:50,480
and the last thing you need to have is a

73
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:52,959
good supply of ice

74
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:54,720
so you know you don't want to have to go

75
00:02:52,959 --> 00:02:56,959
out and buy bagged ice so

76
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:58,000
if you can if you have an ice maker of

77
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:59,760
your own

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:03,280
of course these ice packs work really

79
00:02:59,760 --> 00:03:05,840
well if you have a good supply of them

80
00:03:03,280 --> 00:03:06,480
and if you're planning a day or head or

81
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:09,280
so

82
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:10,400
make yourself some ice blocks or in

83
00:03:09,280 --> 00:03:12,800
small containers

84
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:13,680
or just take some water bottles fill

85
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:16,400
them up

86
00:03:13,680 --> 00:03:19,840
with water and freeze them overnight and

87
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,840
these will work good as well

88
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,120
okay so we're ready to get this set up

89
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:28,879
on the stove okay so once you have your

90
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:30,319
inverted container dish here in the pot

91
00:03:28,879 --> 00:03:32,640
the next thing you want to do is add all

92
00:03:30,319 --> 00:03:35,120
your herbs flowers

93
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:36,879
and whatever you are going to be

94
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:40,000
distilling

95
00:03:36,879 --> 00:03:40,000
just sprinkle them around

96
00:03:44,239 --> 00:03:48,959
for my recipe here today i'm working on

97
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:51,840
making a cooling

98
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:52,400
facial spray so i've picked from my

99
00:03:51,840 --> 00:03:55,840
garden

100
00:03:52,400 --> 00:03:59,439
some fresh rosemary lemon balm

101
00:03:55,840 --> 00:04:02,560
peppermint eucalyptus

102
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,400
and i'm not able to grow lavender here

103
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:06,400
very successfully so i'm going to cheat

104
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:15,840
and add a little bit of

105
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:15,840
bottom lavender buds

106
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:33,600
so then next you're going to add your

107
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:37,199
distilled water and i just pour

108
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:39,840
enough in here to just

109
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:42,080
slightly cover the herbs about two or

110
00:04:39,840 --> 00:04:44,479
three inches

111
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:46,080
to start with i'm going to be adding

112
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,000
more water

113
00:04:46,080 --> 00:04:50,479
throughout the distilling process as it

114
00:04:48,000 --> 00:04:52,160
slowly cooks away i usually top it up

115
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:54,080
two or three times

116
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:57,840
try to get the most i can out of all

117
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,840
these herbs

118
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:07,520
so there's about three inches of

119
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:09,440
distilled water in there

120
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:11,199
so you also want to make sure that

121
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:12,800
everything that you're using is

122
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:14,479
sterile because you don't want to have

123
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:16,560
any bacteria

124
00:05:14,479 --> 00:05:17,840
ending up in your product after you've

125
00:05:16,560 --> 00:05:19,600
created it

126
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:22,880
so i always give everything a good spray

127
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:22,880
with some rubbing alcohol

128
00:05:23,520 --> 00:05:28,400
sometimes i use hydrosols in lotion

129
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:29,759
products that i make so you want to make

130
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:31,199
sure

131
00:05:29,759 --> 00:05:33,120
that you're always keeping everything as

132
00:05:31,199 --> 00:05:36,160
sterile as possible

133
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:38,330
so then you put your bowl on top here

134
00:05:36,160 --> 00:05:40,800
that's going to catch all the steam

135
00:05:38,330 --> 00:05:44,140
[Music]

136
00:05:40,800 --> 00:05:46,320
and then put your lid on inverted

137
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:48,400
[Music]

138
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:50,320
and to start with i turn on the heat at

139
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,120
a higher temperature to get the water

140
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,759
heated up

141
00:05:51,120 --> 00:05:55,680
quicker and once it starts to bubble

142
00:05:53,759 --> 00:05:59,600
turn it down to the lowest setting so

143
00:05:55,680 --> 00:05:59,600
that you have it simmering very gently

144
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,880
and as it simmers away you'll start to

145
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:09,120
see the steam building up

146
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:12,319
on the lid and just to speed up that

147
00:06:09,120 --> 00:06:13,520
condensation process that's when you add

148
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:16,720
your

149
00:06:13,520 --> 00:06:20,479
ice and then i just let it

150
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:22,240
simmer away for half an hour to an hour

151
00:06:20,479 --> 00:06:24,000
you don't have to stand and watch it

152
00:06:22,240 --> 00:06:25,280
non-stop you can

153
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:27,280
go about your business around the

154
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:28,960
kitchen and the house and just check on

155
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,520
it just to make sure that the water

156
00:06:28,960 --> 00:06:32,880
hasn't

157
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:32,880
all boiled away

158
00:06:33,039 --> 00:06:37,120
you will also want to have some kind of

159
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:37,440
jar or container to store your hydrosol

160
00:06:37,120 --> 00:06:39,520
in

161
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:48,190
after you've poured it off so make sure

162
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:51,459
you have something sterilized and ready

163
00:06:48,190 --> 00:06:51,459
[Applause]

164
00:06:54,880 --> 00:07:01,680
okay so as you can see here the water

165
00:06:58,160 --> 00:07:03,759
is slowly steeping and steaming all

166
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,639
these plants carrying all that herbal

167
00:07:03,759 --> 00:07:08,000
goodness

168
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:10,000
to the lid here where the uh the steam

169
00:07:08,000 --> 00:07:11,759
is condensing because it's hitting this

170
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:14,800
cold surface

171
00:07:11,759 --> 00:07:16,080
that we've created with the ice and then

172
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:18,880
from there it drips down

173
00:07:16,080 --> 00:07:20,880
into the bowl and then you are left with

174
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:23,280
some beautiful hydrosol

175
00:07:20,880 --> 00:07:24,400
so about every half hour so i like to

176
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:27,680
just remove the

177
00:07:24,400 --> 00:07:30,880
ice and check my

178
00:07:27,680 --> 00:07:32,880
collection of steam here

179
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:34,800
you want to be very careful because this

180
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:36,319
is very hot steam so you should be

181
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:40,080
wearing some kind of a

182
00:07:36,319 --> 00:07:40,080
glove while you're doing this

183
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:46,960
so i like to pour a little bit off every

184
00:07:44,000 --> 00:07:46,960
half hour or so

185
00:07:54,800 --> 00:08:00,160
smells so amazing it's like having an

186
00:07:57,919 --> 00:08:02,240
aromatherapy

187
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:04,000
thing running in your kitchen while

188
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:06,960
you're you know while you're doing this

189
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,919
it's just a wonderful smell to have and

190
00:08:06,960 --> 00:08:10,840
then after

191
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:13,199
i've done this i usually check the water

192
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:15,840
level

193
00:08:13,199 --> 00:08:16,879
just to max mount the amount of steam

194
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:20,080
distilled

195
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:22,720
hydrosol i can get out of this

196
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:22,720
batch here

197
00:08:24,800 --> 00:08:29,280
so as i said the hydrosol i'm making

198
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:31,360
today is to use as a cooling body spray

199
00:08:29,280 --> 00:08:33,360
or facial spray

200
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:35,839
what i love about hydrosols is that

201
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,320
their aromas are often very soft and

202
00:08:35,839 --> 00:08:38,719
subtle

203
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,560
compared to using something with

204
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,560
essential oils

205
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,760
and the spray leaves your skin feeling

206
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:47,120
cool refreshed

207
00:08:43,760 --> 00:08:50,480
and provides an uplifting aromatherapy

208
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:52,720
property so depending on what herbs

209
00:08:50,480 --> 00:08:54,480
flowers weeds or even fruit or

210
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:57,680
vegetables you use

211
00:08:54,480 --> 00:09:00,000
hydrosols or floral waters can be made

212
00:08:57,680 --> 00:09:02,000
and used for many things

213
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:04,399
so with this process you can create a

214
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:07,839
room spray an anti-itch spray

215
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:10,959
surface cleaner bug spray bath tonic

216
00:09:07,839 --> 00:09:13,920
facial toner hair rinse or

217
00:09:10,959 --> 00:09:16,160
even a makeup remover so if you've made

218
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:17,360
any of these or have created a hydrosol

219
00:09:16,160 --> 00:09:19,680
not mentioned here

220
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:21,920
please let me know in the comments or if

221
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
you'd like to see me make more hydrosols

222
00:09:21,920 --> 00:09:37,839
in future videos

223
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:37,839
let me know in the comments as well

224
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:53,200
so ideally hydrosol should be stored in

225
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:56,160
the refrigerator to maximize their shelf

226
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,959
life but they can also be stored in

227
00:09:56,160 --> 00:10:00,160
amber or

228
00:09:56,959 --> 00:10:05,040
dark colored gloss bottles and kept in a

229
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:06,959
cool dark location

230
00:10:05,040 --> 00:10:08,160
so i hope you enjoyed watching me make a

231
00:10:06,959 --> 00:10:10,560
cooling body mist

232
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:12,079
using fresh plants from my garden and

233
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,839
that you will try making some of your

234
00:10:12,079 --> 00:10:15,440
own hydrosols

235
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,000
i would appreciate if you give this
