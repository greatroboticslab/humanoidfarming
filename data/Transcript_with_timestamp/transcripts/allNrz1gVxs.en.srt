1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:05,640
hi I'm farmer Brad and I'm in the high

2
00:00:03,659 --> 00:00:08,519
tunnel the next step

3
00:00:05,640 --> 00:00:11,519
install some irrigation now I already

4
00:00:08,519 --> 00:00:14,820
had this header pipe it's a lay flat

5
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:17,670
pipe of two inches in diameter and what

6
00:00:14,820 --> 00:00:20,820
I'm gonna do is right behind here is

7
00:00:17,670 --> 00:00:24,570
where the water tower is gonna be so the

8
00:00:20,820 --> 00:00:28,170
water tower will gravity feed down here

9
00:00:24,570 --> 00:00:31,439
but I want to leave this door open so I

10
00:00:28,170 --> 00:00:33,329
can drop my tractor up and down so what

11
00:00:31,439 --> 00:00:35,700
I'm gonna do is run this two-inch pipe

12
00:00:33,329 --> 00:00:39,500
all the way down to the end of the high

13
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:42,420
tunnel I'll do a 90 and then I'll run

14
00:00:39,500 --> 00:00:46,039
three-quarter inch hose across the end

15
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:48,270
and then that will end up feeding the

16
00:00:46,039 --> 00:00:51,390
drip tape now I want to bring to your

17
00:00:48,270 --> 00:00:54,449
attention company name dripworks they

18
00:00:51,390 --> 00:00:57,570
specialize in irrigation drip tapes

19
00:00:54,449 --> 00:01:01,770
small and large and they were kind

20
00:00:57,570 --> 00:01:04,350
enough to donate 500 feet of

21
00:01:01,770 --> 00:01:07,020
three-quarter inch poly pipe and that

22
00:01:04,350 --> 00:01:09,659
will run from the ramp pump through the

23
00:01:07,020 --> 00:01:13,170
water tower they also include a

24
00:01:09,659 --> 00:01:16,530
medium-sized irrigation system for a

25
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:20,070
high tunnel that I'll be using in the

26
00:01:16,530 --> 00:01:24,119
next couple videos but today's goal is

27
00:01:20,070 --> 00:01:24,750
getting this hooked up to the garden

28
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:26,970
hose

29
00:01:24,750 --> 00:01:30,930
initially and then eventually this

30
00:01:26,970 --> 00:01:32,670
two-inch will connect to the water tower

31
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:36,180
this will at least get the irrigation

32
00:01:32,670 --> 00:01:38,100
system up and running and then I'll take

33
00:01:36,180 --> 00:01:40,890
you along for the rest of things so make

34
00:01:38,100 --> 00:01:44,280
sure to check out dripworks com for all

35
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:46,140
of your irrigation needs and definitely

36
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:50,100
want to thank them for their sponsorship

37
00:01:46,140 --> 00:01:53,520
of these irrigation videos so without

38
00:01:50,100 --> 00:01:56,340
further ado I'll go ahead and start the

39
00:01:53,520 --> 00:02:00,060
process okay so the first thing I'll do

40
00:01:56,340 --> 00:02:02,009
is I'll put this 90 degree on and what

41
00:02:00,060 --> 00:02:04,380
eventually this will happen is it will

42
00:02:02,009 --> 00:02:07,170
go vertical up to the water tower but at

43
00:02:04,380 --> 00:02:09,899
least for now I'll just run a short

44
00:02:07,170 --> 00:02:13,470
little section of hose and then I'll be

45
00:02:09,899 --> 00:02:24,940
able to connect connect it on to here

46
00:02:13,470 --> 00:02:32,650
I'll just cut a section here then sure

47
00:02:24,940 --> 00:02:37,800
to put on one of those clamps if it is a

48
00:02:32,650 --> 00:02:41,830
really snug fit you can take a torch and

49
00:02:37,800 --> 00:02:45,930
heat it up to stretch it I'll cut

50
00:02:41,830 --> 00:02:45,930
another little section here

51
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:07,810
and then lastly another hose clamp and

52
00:03:04,270 --> 00:03:07,810
put this right here

53
00:03:13,490 --> 00:03:18,490
okay so I'm gonna tighten up this hose

54
00:03:16,190 --> 00:03:18,490
clamp

55
00:03:19,030 --> 00:03:22,139
[Music]

56
00:03:27,350 --> 00:03:30,490
[Music]

57
00:03:34,220 --> 00:03:36,220
Oh

58
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:41,300
[Music]

59
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:57,709
okay so that's on there I'll go ahead

60
00:03:50,600 --> 00:04:01,459
and hook up the garden hose so I'm using

61
00:03:57,709 --> 00:04:03,740
the same garden hose adapter they used

62
00:04:01,459 --> 00:04:07,270
for the automatic chicken water buckets

63
00:04:03,740 --> 00:04:23,300
and just does a safety measure

64
00:04:07,270 --> 00:04:25,910
I'll put teflon tape on this part so

65
00:04:23,300 --> 00:04:33,100
then I'll take my channel locks channel

66
00:04:25,910 --> 00:04:33,100
locks and hang it up as tight as I can

67
00:04:40,130 --> 00:04:47,040
okay

68
00:04:42,190 --> 00:04:54,910
I'm gonna move this back into position

69
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:59,800
we'd be up against there now let's go to

70
00:04:54,910 --> 00:05:03,730
the other end so I'm gonna find a spot

71
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:08,460
over here probably like right about

72
00:05:03,730 --> 00:05:08,460
there to tie this in

73
00:05:21,240 --> 00:05:28,780
before I got any further I wanted to go

74
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:32,170
over the medium-sized irrigation system

75
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:37,870
for high tunnel so it includes I think a

76
00:05:32,170 --> 00:05:41,680
hundred feet of half-inch poly pipe and

77
00:05:37,870 --> 00:05:48,510
this is what I'll use to feed the drip

78
00:05:41,680 --> 00:05:48,510
tape well it has a filter here it has

79
00:05:48,600 --> 00:06:02,380
where you can splice into here to run

80
00:05:53,800 --> 00:06:09,430
the drip tape it has spikes for keeping

81
00:06:02,380 --> 00:06:13,570
the irrigation in place see oh these are

82
00:06:09,430 --> 00:06:18,010
for tying off the ends of the drip tape

83
00:06:13,570 --> 00:06:19,480
so you can terminate them by just

84
00:06:18,010 --> 00:06:20,950
flipping them over in half and then

85
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:24,850
these are little plastic pieces that

86
00:06:20,950 --> 00:06:29,710
slide over the end and then here are

87
00:06:24,850 --> 00:06:35,440
some pressure regulators to decrease the

88
00:06:29,710 --> 00:06:37,750
pressure from pressure regulator down to

89
00:06:35,440 --> 00:06:42,790
10 psi so you don't over blow your

90
00:06:37,750 --> 00:06:46,590
system there's a little puncture tool or

91
00:06:42,790 --> 00:06:48,910
puncturing the holes in this to connect

92
00:06:46,590 --> 00:06:53,260
these little parts and then there's also

93
00:06:48,910 --> 00:06:56,800
some repair kits where if there's a hole

94
00:06:53,260 --> 00:07:00,430
you can cut the leaking area and then

95
00:06:56,800 --> 00:07:03,700
splice the two parts together so that's

96
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:06,910
pretty much what is included in the

97
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:10,180
system they also which I'm really

98
00:07:06,910 --> 00:07:13,210
excited about this drip works provide me

99
00:07:10,180 --> 00:07:16,440
with a Bluetooth hose end irrigation

100
00:07:13,210 --> 00:07:21,090
controller so this you'll be able to

101
00:07:16,440 --> 00:07:22,949
control via bluetooth set the schedules

102
00:07:21,090 --> 00:07:26,690
as long as you're within range of

103
00:07:22,949 --> 00:07:31,440
Bluetooth so that will be really awesome

104
00:07:26,690 --> 00:07:33,449
so then I can set timing for watering

105
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:36,600
and the such so unfortunately I don't

106
00:07:33,449 --> 00:07:40,320
have another clamp so I'm just going to

107
00:07:36,600 --> 00:07:46,639
try to terminate this by doing the

108
00:07:40,320 --> 00:07:46,639
pullback method and some Gorilla Tape

109
00:07:47,330 --> 00:07:58,820
wait these arrow there is back there we

110
00:07:52,919 --> 00:07:58,820
go so that should terminate that

111
00:08:00,450 --> 00:08:06,390
[Music]

112
00:08:03,100 --> 00:08:11,280
where that will do the trick for that

113
00:08:06,390 --> 00:08:15,370
now here I'm going to unscrew this and

114
00:08:11,280 --> 00:08:18,270
have it go from three-quarter inch down

115
00:08:15,370 --> 00:08:22,080
to half an inch okay so now I'm going to

116
00:08:18,270 --> 00:08:22,080
heat this up a little bit

117
00:08:31,719 --> 00:08:34,829
light it on there

118
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:43,269
[Music]

119
00:08:41,620 --> 00:08:46,379
and then I'll do the

120
00:08:43,269 --> 00:08:46,379
same thing up here

121
00:09:02,740 --> 00:09:08,910
[Music]

122
00:09:10,000 --> 00:09:21,300
okay okay so I'm gonna connect this

123
00:09:14,620 --> 00:09:21,300
first over here okay keep this up

124
00:09:45,320 --> 00:09:49,970
okay that's tight

125
00:09:51,290 --> 00:10:02,059
I'll go ahead and take one of these too

126
00:09:58,279 --> 00:10:02,059
I'll keep it straight

127
00:10:18,470 --> 00:10:21,739
[Music]

128
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:44,310
okay so determine and eat this end what

129
00:10:33,000 --> 00:10:49,139
I'll do is I'll cut this off and I'll

130
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:52,740
flip it back so because this hose is

131
00:10:49,139 --> 00:10:56,360
pretty tight I'm going to just use this

132
00:10:52,740 --> 00:10:56,360
clamp here to

133
00:10:58,860 --> 00:11:02,489
[Music]

134
00:11:17,180 --> 00:11:20,270
[Applause]

135
00:11:21,820 --> 00:11:25,990
this is where the video is gonna have to

136
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:27,520
end I wasn't able to get any further

137
00:11:25,990 --> 00:11:30,820
because there was a storm coming in

138
00:11:27,520 --> 00:11:34,950
so look forward to irrigation part 2 in

139
00:11:30,820 --> 00:11:34,950
an upcoming video thanks for watching
