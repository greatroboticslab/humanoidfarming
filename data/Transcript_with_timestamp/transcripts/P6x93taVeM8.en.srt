00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,359
hello welcome to unit one of intro to

2
00:00:03,799 --> 00:00:09,200
agroecology this unit's entitled current

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:12,360
non-sustainable agriculture practices

4
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:15,280
what we'll be covering in this unit is

5
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:18,480
what currently is happening in farming

6
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:20,800
and why we need to make some changes uh

7
00:00:18,480 --> 00:00:23,880
as we go into the future in able to in

8
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:26,400
order to be able to um feed the

9
00:00:23,880 --> 00:00:29,599
population of uh the

10
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:31,679
world uh here is just a picture of way

11
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:34,320
back when of what the farming practices

12
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:37,719
were like and basically the reason this

13
00:00:34,320 --> 00:00:40,280
picture is here to show you how um they

14
00:00:37,719 --> 00:00:42,039
used to plow the land and it was just

15
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:44,480
all open all the time you can see right

16
00:00:42,039 --> 00:00:46,520
now nothing's growing um this would be

17
00:00:44,480 --> 00:00:49,199
in a dormant time probably in the late

18
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:51,280
fall winter or early spring before we

19
00:00:49,199 --> 00:00:52,680
planted and it's just to show you that

20
00:00:51,280 --> 00:00:55,239
that's what they used to do and we'll

21
00:00:52,680 --> 00:00:58,719
talk as we go on in this uh unit and

22
00:00:55,239 --> 00:01:01,359
discuss some of the changes we need to

23
00:00:58,719 --> 00:01:02,480
make um some of the areas we're going to

24
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:05,560
look at we're going to look at the

25
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:08,439
current practices um that we currently

26
00:01:05,560 --> 00:01:10,479
do in agriculture we're going to look at

27
00:01:08,439 --> 00:01:12,799
how we work the land that's the tillage

28
00:01:10,479 --> 00:01:15,119
practices that we use currently and

29
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:18,479
we'll talk a little bit about um from

30
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:20,960
the beginning um when they started out

31
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:23,759
with the Prairies and made them into

32
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:25,640
Farmland um to today and and the

33
00:01:23,759 --> 00:01:28,200
differences in philosophies and why they

34
00:01:25,640 --> 00:01:30,880
did that um we're going to talk about

35
00:01:28,200 --> 00:01:33,040
synthetic fertilizers and why they have

36
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:36,360
become an issue and why we need to

37
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:38,560
change into organic fertilizers we're

38
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,720
going to talk a little bit about um weed

39
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:44,320
and Pest Control practices that are in

40
00:01:40,720 --> 00:01:48,200
use today um that we use and most of

41
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:49,680
those are synthetic um not organic and

42
00:01:48,200 --> 00:01:53,920
we'll talk about why we need to change

43
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:58,079
those too um we'll also talk about a

44
00:01:53,920 --> 00:02:00,840
change that used to be all small family

45
00:01:58,079 --> 00:02:04,240
farms and it's becoming more and more as

46
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:06,399
time goes on um large corporations doing

47
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:08,840
the farming and raising the animals and

48
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:11,280
we'll talk about um why that's been good

49
00:02:08,840 --> 00:02:13,440
and bad and then we'll talk about some

50
00:02:11,280 --> 00:02:14,480
of the limitations we have with our

51
00:02:13,440 --> 00:02:17,200
current

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:19,560
practices um as we go forward in the

53
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:21,080
future and why we need to change in

54
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:23,599
order to be able to feed

55
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:26,720
everyone um the first area we'll talk

56
00:02:23,599 --> 00:02:30,800
about is the um tillage practices that

57
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:33,879
are in use today um basically when they

58
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:35,599
had the native prairies you had to um

59
00:02:33,879 --> 00:02:38,840
they called it busting the Prairie but

60
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:42,159
you were actually taking a piece of

61
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:44,519
equipment um and making sure that it

62
00:02:42,159 --> 00:02:47,599
could dig into the land and they used to

63
00:02:44,519 --> 00:02:49,239
do that every year and we found out that

64
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:51,879
in the practices of doing that where

65
00:02:49,239 --> 00:02:53,440
we're losing some uh a lot of soil

66
00:02:51,879 --> 00:02:55,200
because of erosion the winds in the

67
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:58,959
winter time because was open like that

68
00:02:55,200 --> 00:02:59,959
first picture we saw in this unit um

69
00:02:58,959 --> 00:03:02,640
we're going to look at some of the

70
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:05,040
different pieces they've used um current

71
00:03:02,640 --> 00:03:07,440
or they're currently using um and we're

72
00:03:05,040 --> 00:03:10,159
going to talk a little bit about why did

73
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:13,400
they changeed and and uh over the last

74
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:15,400
50 years into using new practices one of

75
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:18,319
the reasons they changed was because of

76
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:19,920
the Dust Bowl they had um that they

77
00:03:18,319 --> 00:03:22,080
found out that the reason they had the

78
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,440
Dust Bowl was because we were plowing

79
00:03:22,080 --> 00:03:26,440
and we were leaving the fields open and

80
00:03:24,440 --> 00:03:29,200
uh prone to being able to have erosion

81
00:03:26,440 --> 00:03:32,360
the wind was blowing the soil everywhere

82
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:34,439
uh except where wanted it to be um then

83
00:03:32,360 --> 00:03:37,280
we're going to look also at some of the

84
00:03:34,439 --> 00:03:40,040
conservation things that they've come

85
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:42,159
about probably starting in the late 60s

86
00:03:40,040 --> 00:03:45,760
early 70s to

87
00:03:42,159 --> 00:03:48,720
today um and why did they why are they

88
00:03:45,760 --> 00:03:50,680
practicing it why is the farm bureaus

89
00:03:48,720 --> 00:03:52,560
that are out there helping people or

90
00:03:50,680 --> 00:03:55,040
helping the current Farmers learn that

91
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:57,200
they need to change what they're doing

92
00:03:55,040 --> 00:04:00,120
uh and then up to the current where

93
00:03:57,200 --> 00:04:02,519
we're pretty much now most farmers are

94
00:04:00,120 --> 00:04:04,959
believing that no till is the way they

95
00:04:02,519 --> 00:04:07,360
should do versus breaking the Prairie or

96
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:08,760
using the plow all the time um there's a

97
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:11,360
lot of farmers that don't even have

98
00:04:08,760 --> 00:04:13,360
plows anymore but basically what the no

99
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:16,160
till is is they've changed when they

100
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:18,959
plant they've added um some equipment to

101
00:04:16,160 --> 00:04:20,519
it that makes them able to plant and you

102
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:22,320
know open the ground a little bit but

103
00:04:20,519 --> 00:04:26,639
we're doing it a lot less than what we

104
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:28,520
did and it's um actually uh saving uh

105
00:04:26,639 --> 00:04:31,759
the land that we

106
00:04:28,520 --> 00:04:34,600
have um some of the current uh tillage

107
00:04:31,759 --> 00:04:37,840
methods that we have there's

108
00:04:34,600 --> 00:04:40,120
cultivation um and what cultivation is

109
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:41,560
is after the plants are planted they go

110
00:04:40,120 --> 00:04:44,080
in there and they try to control the

111
00:04:41,560 --> 00:04:46,160
weeds so they can do that up to a

112
00:04:44,080 --> 00:04:47,759
certain point um let's just it doesn't

113
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:49,560
matter whether it's corn or soy beans

114
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:52,520
the two most common crops that are out

115
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:54,520
there for most Farmers um it's just a

116
00:04:52,520 --> 00:04:57,320
little they call a chisel plow it's a

117
00:04:54,520 --> 00:04:59,280
v-shaped piece of equipment and what

118
00:04:57,320 --> 00:05:01,680
happens is it just goes between the rows

119
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:04,520
of the crops whether it's corn or

120
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,160
soybeans and it actually um pulls the

121
00:05:04,520 --> 00:05:08,080
weeds out of the ground you can only do

122
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:10,440
that till it gets about a foot high but

123
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:13,800
then at that point the crop tends to

124
00:05:10,440 --> 00:05:15,759
crowd out um the ability for the sun to

125
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:18,000
get to the ground which is how seeds

126
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,840
germinate for weeds and you don't have

127
00:05:18,000 --> 00:05:22,639
that problem anymore or certainly not as

128
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:24,919
much um plowing is the first time when

129
00:05:22,639 --> 00:05:27,240
you do it if you've never farmed land or

130
00:05:24,919 --> 00:05:29,479
if you had it let's say in pasture land

131
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:32,520
or it was just bow which means you don't

132
00:05:29,479 --> 00:05:35,120
have have any crops on it at all that um

133
00:05:32,520 --> 00:05:37,720
you might have to work it with a plow uh

134
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:40,720
in order to be able to plant again

135
00:05:37,720 --> 00:05:43,600
dising is a practice that's not used as

136
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:46,919
much anymore but basically it used to be

137
00:05:43,600 --> 00:05:48,520
used all the time in the 60s and 70s

138
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:52,160
that they go in right before they

139
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:53,400
planted it's a round shaped saucer and

140
00:05:52,160 --> 00:05:55,479
there's a bunch of them hooked down

141
00:05:53,400 --> 00:05:58,280
we'll have a picture of it later uh to

142
00:05:55,479 --> 00:06:00,720
see it and basically it would it would

143
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:02,720
uh turn the ground a few inch is in and

144
00:06:00,720 --> 00:06:05,880
provide for the ability to be able to

145
00:06:02,720 --> 00:06:08,240
plant easy um minimum till was when you

146
00:06:05,880 --> 00:06:11,680
would do it

147
00:06:08,240 --> 00:06:13,840
um not as often they got to a point

148
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:15,319
where they they did not at the end of

149
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:17,960
the year when they took the crops out

150
00:06:15,319 --> 00:06:19,840
the crop residue was there they used to

151
00:06:17,960 --> 00:06:22,280
always either come in and disc it or

152
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:24,240
they turn it with a plow for the winter

153
00:06:22,280 --> 00:06:26,199
time and then they come in and disc in

154
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,680
the spring and you'd be able to plant

155
00:06:26,199 --> 00:06:30,080
and they'd have a smooth surface to

156
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:31,960
plant on now what they do is they leave

157
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:33,639
that residue a lot of what they found

158
00:06:31,960 --> 00:06:36,400
out will go away in the winter time from

159
00:06:33,639 --> 00:06:38,280
the freeze Tha Cycles uh and then

160
00:06:36,400 --> 00:06:40,720
there's now no till when they started

161
00:06:38,280 --> 00:06:43,160
adding that uh extra it's just a little

162
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,039
disc actually it'll just open the soil

163
00:06:43,160 --> 00:06:46,960
enough to put the seed in the ground and

164
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:48,759
that's what they call no till so it's

165
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:51,360
technically it is a little bit of

166
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:52,840
tilling but it's not as much as it was

167
00:06:51,360 --> 00:06:55,840
when you used to do the

168
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,840
discing

169
00:06:56,479 --> 00:07:02,039
um um on this slide this just goes to

170
00:06:59,240 --> 00:07:04,879
the I said about cultivation plowing and

171
00:07:02,039 --> 00:07:06,840
discing um it talks a little bit more

172
00:07:04,879 --> 00:07:09,120
detail for the cultivation removing

173
00:07:06,840 --> 00:07:11,039
those weeds and it um why does it create

174
00:07:09,120 --> 00:07:13,280
a better growing environment because if

175
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:15,080
there's less um competition for the

176
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:18,160
plants the plants are going to do better

177
00:07:15,080 --> 00:07:21,759
they're all competing for excuse me all

178
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:23,479
the nutrients and water so the less

179
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:25,000
plants that are there and the ones that

180
00:07:23,479 --> 00:07:27,840
you want that are there they're going to

181
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:31,160
grow better for you um plowing it'll dig

182
00:07:27,840 --> 00:07:34,240
down in 10 to 12 Ines so you you can see

183
00:07:31,160 --> 00:07:36,879
um that digging down that far how you're

184
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:38,599
opening up a a big area when it turns

185
00:07:36,879 --> 00:07:40,879
over and you'll see a picture of it in a

186
00:07:38,599 --> 00:07:42,520
little bit that that's what allows for

187
00:07:40,879 --> 00:07:45,680
that erosion when the wind comes to have

188
00:07:42,520 --> 00:07:47,280
it Blow around um pretty much now it's

189
00:07:45,680 --> 00:07:50,560
only used when you're preparing a new

190
00:07:47,280 --> 00:07:53,120
field um dising told you before it's a

191
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:56,080
platter like device uh it only goes in

192
00:07:53,120 --> 00:07:59,080
46 in and it really doesn't turn it like

193
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:02,319
a plow it just kind of cut cuts it apart

194
00:07:59,080 --> 00:08:04,000
because of how the disc is and basically

195
00:08:02,319 --> 00:08:05,280
when there are some Farmers that still

196
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:07,840
do it they'll do it at the end to

197
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:10,759
harvest to to break apart the corn or

198
00:08:07,840 --> 00:08:12,400
soybean residue that's there um and

199
00:08:10,759 --> 00:08:14,199
basically corn fields are what they use

200
00:08:12,400 --> 00:08:17,120
it in the soybeans don't leave as much

201
00:08:14,199 --> 00:08:19,080
residue okay uh some Farmers still use

202
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:20,280
it for when they plant a new crop

203
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:23,120
because that's what they've always done

204
00:08:20,280 --> 00:08:25,440
we all get in habits the minimum till

205
00:08:23,120 --> 00:08:28,639
it's that um discing a fuel before you

206
00:08:25,440 --> 00:08:31,879
plant but you don't ever use plowing at

207
00:08:28,639 --> 00:08:35,080
all um um and I would say most farmers

208
00:08:31,879 --> 00:08:37,919
are either in minimum till or no till um

209
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:42,159
I'd say vast majority probably 90 to 95%

210
00:08:37,919 --> 00:08:44,399
today across the US um no till is when

211
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:49,760
they don't use the

212
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:52,240
um the disc or plow and they go ahead

213
00:08:49,760 --> 00:08:54,440
and harvest plant and harvest without

214
00:08:52,240 --> 00:08:56,360
doing that but once again the planter

215
00:08:54,440 --> 00:08:57,959
that they use has a little disc on that

216
00:08:56,360 --> 00:09:01,440
opens it up enough that you can plant

217
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:01,440
the seed in the ground

218
00:09:02,200 --> 00:09:07,079
um here's a picture of discing and you

219
00:09:04,680 --> 00:09:09,160
can see it's pretty it's not completely

220
00:09:07,079 --> 00:09:12,600
smooth but in the next picture you're

221
00:09:09,160 --> 00:09:15,120
going to see um the reason you do this

222
00:09:12,600 --> 00:09:18,920
is it opens it up but what it also does

223
00:09:15,120 --> 00:09:22,320
is it also allows for um

224
00:09:18,920 --> 00:09:24,079
seed seeds to come up for weeds which

225
00:09:22,320 --> 00:09:25,640
would allow more weeds to come up and

226
00:09:24,079 --> 00:09:27,240
that's part of the thing too when you do

227
00:09:25,640 --> 00:09:30,360
the no till you're not going to get as

228
00:09:27,240 --> 00:09:33,680
many uh weed seeds that are on top and

229
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:36,079
weed and any seed needs the U sun to be

230
00:09:33,680 --> 00:09:37,680
able to germinate so you want to make

231
00:09:36,079 --> 00:09:39,000
sure you you control that and that's one

232
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,680
of the things they found out they have a

233
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:43,279
lot less weeds um not having as many

234
00:09:41,680 --> 00:09:45,640
weeds you'll also find out when we talk

235
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:47,600
about fertilizers that that's better too

236
00:09:45,640 --> 00:09:49,519
because you're not putting as much

237
00:09:47,600 --> 00:09:51,600
synthetic things on the land which we

238
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:55,760
found out isn't that good here you can

239
00:09:51,600 --> 00:10:00,800
see when they turn it um that they have

240
00:09:55,760 --> 00:10:00,800
a this area right in here

241
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:05,320
uh that I circled with my

242
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:07,160
pointer that um it's a little bit higher

243
00:10:05,320 --> 00:10:09,959
and that's the ridge it leaves there's

244
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:12,680
one across the second one here how those

245
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:15,680
are created is up here is where the disc

246
00:10:12,680 --> 00:10:19,079
are it's just a a curved piece of metal

247
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:20,680
that's about u a foot and a half wide

248
00:10:19,079 --> 00:10:22,880
and that's what actually goes into the

249
00:10:20,680 --> 00:10:24,760
ground they have a hydraulic on it and

250
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:26,800
they are able to go into the ground that

251
00:10:24,760 --> 00:10:30,920
far uh the farmer can lift it by a

252
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:30,920
control he has on his tractor

253
00:10:31,800 --> 00:10:39,760
uh talking about synthetic fertilizers

254
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:41,880
um the synthetic fertilizers came about

255
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:45,680
around the time that they ended the

256
00:10:41,880 --> 00:10:48,240
second world war and it was um

257
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:49,880
basically because we were farming we

258
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:52,120
weren't they needed to they always want

259
00:10:49,880 --> 00:10:54,920
to increase production and that was a

260
00:10:52,120 --> 00:10:56,920
way in which fertilizer of course um we

261
00:10:54,920 --> 00:11:00,200
all use it on you know house plants we

262
00:10:56,920 --> 00:11:02,639
have like um Miracle Grow

263
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:05,360
and it helps the plant grow it provides

264
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:07,839
nutrients that needs specifically

265
00:11:05,360 --> 00:11:12,079
nitrogen that'll help that plant do

266
00:11:07,839 --> 00:11:14,000
better most Farm crops nitrogen is um

267
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:16,320
the fertilizer they want to put on there

268
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:18,279
to make it grow better but one of the

269
00:11:16,320 --> 00:11:19,720
problems that they found out um that

270
00:11:18,279 --> 00:11:21,680
they didn't know right in the beginning

271
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:24,440
was that those synthetic fertilizers

272
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:26,600
don't make the soil Vitality any better

273
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:29,399
in other words the nutrients in the soil

274
00:11:26,600 --> 00:11:31,240
that stay there they're they found out

275
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:33,120
that it uses it right away and then

276
00:11:31,240 --> 00:11:34,880
there's nothing there so basically the

277
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:37,880
soil is getting worse and worse every

278
00:11:34,880 --> 00:11:39,079
year the other thing is in a normal soil

279
00:11:37,880 --> 00:11:41,839
there are

280
00:11:39,079 --> 00:11:43,760
micronutrients and micronutrients aren't

281
00:11:41,839 --> 00:11:45,600
in as large a supply as the

282
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:47,920
macronutrients that are out there and

283
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:50,839
nitrogen happens to be one of the

284
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:53,399
macronutrients um but basically they are

285
00:11:50,839 --> 00:11:56,160
things that help a plant get stronger

286
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:57,959
they help a plant flower better um those

287
00:11:56,160 --> 00:12:00,800
types of things and there's things like

288
00:11:57,959 --> 00:12:03,720
Boron that um are some of the um

289
00:12:00,800 --> 00:12:05,959
micronutrients but there's total of all

290
00:12:03,720 --> 00:12:10,120
nutrients there's 17 different ones and

291
00:12:05,959 --> 00:12:13,279
in a uh unit that's going to follow will

292
00:12:10,120 --> 00:12:15,079
get into um all of the macro and

293
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:19,880
micronutrients so that'll make a lot

294
00:12:15,079 --> 00:12:23,199
more sense then um also what happens is

295
00:12:19,880 --> 00:12:25,120
that by putting in the fertilizers and

296
00:12:23,199 --> 00:12:26,839
it's not a total result of that but

297
00:12:25,120 --> 00:12:29,000
because you aren't building the soil and

298
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:31,839
the Vitality isn't as good it's going to

299
00:12:29,000 --> 00:12:33,440
be become more compressed over time

300
00:12:31,839 --> 00:12:36,079
because it's taking out some of those

301
00:12:33,440 --> 00:12:38,560
nutrients um and it's going to not be

302
00:12:36,079 --> 00:12:40,279
real good for the soil um one of the

303
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:43,880
other things they're found out is all

304
00:12:40,279 --> 00:12:46,440
the nitrogens we put on the um on the

305
00:12:43,880 --> 00:12:48,519
land when we're doing this there's times

306
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,639
that a lot of that fertilizer will leech

307
00:12:48,519 --> 00:12:52,600
out that means it leaves it without

308
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:55,519
doing the desired effect that you want

309
00:12:52,600 --> 00:13:00,000
with the fertilizer and basically what

310
00:12:55,519 --> 00:13:03,199
happens is it goes from um the arm field

311
00:13:00,000 --> 00:13:05,000
into ditches then to streams then to

312
00:13:03,199 --> 00:13:07,760
rivers and it eventually gets down to

313
00:13:05,000 --> 00:13:10,120
the Gulf of Mexico and basically what

314
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,920
happens on that is that's where all of

315
00:13:10,120 --> 00:13:17,199
the U basically it's killing the coral

316
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:19,160
reefs and stuff um and all the uh all

317
00:13:17,199 --> 00:13:22,560
the plants and animals that are at the

318
00:13:19,160 --> 00:13:23,959
end of the Gulf of Mexico um and this

319
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:27,880
happens all over the world it's just not

320
00:13:23,959 --> 00:13:29,560
in the Gulf of Mexico um but basically

321
00:13:27,880 --> 00:13:31,639
what we're finding out is that we're

322
00:13:29,560 --> 00:13:33,519
really putting too much on because if it

323
00:13:31,639 --> 00:13:35,000
doesn't need it it just runs off the

324
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:38,279
other thing is if you put it on at the

325
00:13:35,000 --> 00:13:40,360
wrong time uh if it rains sometimes rain

326
00:13:38,279 --> 00:13:42,720
will make it wash away um if the water

327
00:13:40,360 --> 00:13:46,519
is you know running off the field real

328
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:48,880
quickly um here's an example of a farmer

329
00:13:46,519 --> 00:13:51,600
applying fertilizer and in this case

330
00:13:48,880 --> 00:13:55,279
he's applying nitrogen and specifically

331
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:59,079
it's called anhydrous ammonia um it's a

332
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:02,399
it's a gaseous um liquid gas that BAS

333
00:13:59,079 --> 00:14:05,000
basically if you breathe it um you would

334
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:07,880
probably not be here anymore uh it's

335
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:09,959
very dangerous um but basically what you

336
00:14:07,880 --> 00:14:12,279
see and and it's a good example here if

337
00:14:09,959 --> 00:14:15,079
you look at between the this is an

338
00:14:12,279 --> 00:14:17,079
example of corn uh if you look between

339
00:14:15,079 --> 00:14:19,680
it there's a residue from the corn of

340
00:14:17,079 --> 00:14:21,680
last year um one of the things and we'll

341
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:24,279
we'll get into this in more detail as we

342
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:27,120
go through the course but that's one of

343
00:14:24,279 --> 00:14:29,880
the problems they have that some of the

344
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:32,480
um crops we put in will put some

345
00:14:29,880 --> 00:14:34,360
nutrients back into the soil Corn's not

346
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:36,880
one of those it actually just takes

347
00:14:34,360 --> 00:14:39,199
nutrients especially nitrogen and that's

348
00:14:36,880 --> 00:14:41,920
what's making the Vitality of the soils

349
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:44,399
uh less and less all the time and we'll

350
00:14:41,920 --> 00:14:47,920
talk in ways we can make that better too

351
00:14:44,399 --> 00:14:49,639
here's an example of um the the prior uh

352
00:14:47,920 --> 00:14:52,240
slide showed you were just applying

353
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,639
nitrogen you apply it everywhere okay

354
00:14:52,240 --> 00:14:56,600
it's really only needed where the plant

355
00:14:54,639 --> 00:14:58,199
is but there's not an effective way we

356
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:01,279
can really do that without putting it on

357
00:14:58,199 --> 00:15:02,720
the whole field here is an example of it

358
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:04,480
wouldn't so much be a farmer is not

359
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:06,600
going to be out there doing this but it

360
00:15:04,480 --> 00:15:08,720
just shows that you can use a selective

361
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:10,920
weed killer even if you spray it on the

362
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:14,160
whole field but what's good about this

363
00:15:10,920 --> 00:15:16,160
is it's only going to kill the uh

364
00:15:14,160 --> 00:15:19,680
intended plant you want so if you're out

365
00:15:16,160 --> 00:15:21,480
in a just say a grass yard um you can

366
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:22,639
spray a weed killer a selective weed

367
00:15:21,480 --> 00:15:25,480
killer and it's not going to kill the

368
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:27,519
grass it's just going to Kill U the weed

369
00:15:25,480 --> 00:15:29,519
that you want it's the same in a a farm

370
00:15:27,519 --> 00:15:31,519
field they can put in selective

371
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:33,440
herbicides they call it it doesn't kill

372
00:15:31,519 --> 00:15:35,680
the plant it only kills the weeds that

373
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:35,680
are

374
00:15:36,759 --> 00:15:44,160
there

375
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:47,319
um for synthetic fertilizers um in in

376
00:15:44,160 --> 00:15:49,959
some ways that it's it's become

377
00:15:47,319 --> 00:15:51,800
something especially with corn that if

378
00:15:49,959 --> 00:15:54,440
you don't use it you're not going to get

379
00:15:51,800 --> 00:15:56,160
the crop yield that you want and and one

380
00:15:54,440 --> 00:15:57,920
of the ways that they've made it they

381
00:15:56,160 --> 00:16:02,279
they've used genetics to be able to

382
00:15:57,920 --> 00:16:04,800
produce corn that that will give you uh

383
00:16:02,279 --> 00:16:09,800
a yield that you like back in the 40s

384
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:14,000
and 50s they used to get about 40 to 45

385
00:16:09,800 --> 00:16:17,120
um bushels of corn for an acre of land

386
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:20,079
right now they're exceeding 300 bushels

387
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:22,560
of corn per acre so you can see that

388
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:25,079
they've really really increased the

389
00:16:22,560 --> 00:16:26,560
amount of uh yield you can get which

390
00:16:25,079 --> 00:16:29,079
means you get more yield which means you

391
00:16:26,560 --> 00:16:31,160
get more money and everyone loves it

392
00:16:29,079 --> 00:16:34,560
part of the problem is is you needed a

393
00:16:31,160 --> 00:16:35,920
lot of nitrogen to do that and because

394
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,560
you're putting more nitrogen there's

395
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:40,199
more runoff so you have a big issue with

396
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:41,600
that so that's some of the stuff that

397
00:16:40,199 --> 00:16:44,079
we're going to start talking about what

398
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:45,800
can we do to become more sustainable

399
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:49,720
which you'll see is a huge word as we go

400
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:51,279
through this class um irrigation would

401
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:54,240
also aggravate the problem we talked

402
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:56,240
earlier when you get too much rain um

403
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:58,560
you can have an issue with it but but

404
00:16:56,240 --> 00:17:00,639
with that is is that it'll make it run

405
00:16:58,560 --> 00:17:03,720
off a little bit more you just have to

406
00:17:00,639 --> 00:17:06,640
be careful with that irrigation isn't in

407
00:17:03,720 --> 00:17:10,039
most Farms it's usually only in

408
00:17:06,640 --> 00:17:13,000
Vegetable Farms um so if you're raising

409
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:15,240
stuff like potatoes or pumpkins or you

410
00:17:13,000 --> 00:17:17,720
know peas or you know things you buy in

411
00:17:15,240 --> 00:17:21,559
the store like that as opposed to corn

412
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:23,319
and um soybeans which are byproducts use

413
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:26,799
they create many different products but

414
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:29,360
they you don't eat that corn directly um

415
00:17:26,799 --> 00:17:31,960
also irrigation aggravation a problem

416
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:34,080
that it adds salt to the soil and too

417
00:17:31,960 --> 00:17:36,240
much salt is not good for soil either

418
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:38,600
and it doesn't necessarily go away salt

419
00:17:36,240 --> 00:17:40,440
tends to stay it doesn't tend to um

420
00:17:38,600 --> 00:17:42,640
leave the area and that could be a

421
00:17:40,440 --> 00:17:46,080
problem and certainly is a problem in

422
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:49,559
some of the areas that do irrigation

423
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:52,960
um fertilizers are becoming

424
00:17:49,559 --> 00:17:54,559
tremendously expensive um they didn't Ed

425
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,000
to be very expensive but even the

426
00:17:54,559 --> 00:17:59,240
fertilizer you buy for your yard you

427
00:17:57,000 --> 00:18:00,919
know 10 years ago used to be half the

428
00:17:59,240 --> 00:18:04,400
cost of what it is today so that's

429
00:18:00,919 --> 00:18:06,480
really made a big difference um and then

430
00:18:04,400 --> 00:18:09,120
I talked earlier the the second to the

431
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:11,480
last point there is corn would not

432
00:18:09,120 --> 00:18:13,320
produce what it does if you didn't

433
00:18:11,480 --> 00:18:15,799
fertilize it you'd probably get about a

434
00:18:13,320 --> 00:18:17,600
third the amount that you get currently

435
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:21,840
so you get about a 100 bushels an acre

436
00:18:17,600 --> 00:18:23,840
as opposed to 300 and like we said when

437
00:18:21,840 --> 00:18:26,159
we do that it doesn't address that

438
00:18:23,840 --> 00:18:29,200
long-term Vitality of the soil because

439
00:18:26,159 --> 00:18:30,840
what happens is it um just uses

440
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:34,799
everything that's there and no nutrients

441
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:34,799
are added and that's become a huge

442
00:18:35,480 --> 00:18:42,440
problem okay um also besides doing the

443
00:18:39,799 --> 00:18:46,240
nitrogens there's also chemicals that we

444
00:18:42,440 --> 00:18:48,240
use for Pest and weed control um what

445
00:18:46,240 --> 00:18:50,480
they try to control when they use these

446
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:56,880
chemicals are diseases that you might

447
00:18:50,480 --> 00:18:59,720
get on crops um insect infestations um

448
00:18:56,880 --> 00:19:02,640
and there's also the weeds you can get

449
00:18:59,720 --> 00:19:04,880
um what we do is one of the reasons we

450
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:07,400
put the herbicides pesticides or

451
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:10,200
fungicides on and herbicides are for the

452
00:19:07,400 --> 00:19:12,360
crops pesticides are things for like

453
00:19:10,200 --> 00:19:15,559
grasshoppers bow weevils that type of

454
00:19:12,360 --> 00:19:18,799
stuff the insects and fungicides are for

455
00:19:15,559 --> 00:19:20,640
the diseases um that you might get and

456
00:19:18,799 --> 00:19:22,640
it varies by crop and we'll talk a

457
00:19:20,640 --> 00:19:26,799
little bit about that as we get into

458
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:30,000
suceeding chapters of uh this

459
00:19:26,799 --> 00:19:33,440
course um so some of the issues we have

460
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:36,679
with the pest and weed control is that

461
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:38,360
it is a synthetic item so it's not

462
00:19:36,679 --> 00:19:41,120
something that's natural and what we're

463
00:19:38,360 --> 00:19:43,559
finding is is not having Natural Things

464
00:19:41,120 --> 00:19:46,840
it isn't as good as we thought it was

465
00:19:43,559 --> 00:19:48,840
but what happens is over time we have

466
00:19:46,840 --> 00:19:51,080
found that the effectiveness of that

467
00:19:48,840 --> 00:19:54,000
chemical decreases in other words it

468
00:19:51,080 --> 00:19:57,440
isn't doing the same as it did because

469
00:19:54,000 --> 00:20:00,520
the insects and diseases are learning

470
00:19:57,440 --> 00:20:03,919
from their going to get killed with

471
00:20:00,520 --> 00:20:06,799
let's say something like um DDT was a

472
00:20:03,919 --> 00:20:09,320
perfect example it killed everything but

473
00:20:06,799 --> 00:20:11,679
what we also found with that is over

474
00:20:09,320 --> 00:20:15,039
time that it affected the environment

475
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:18,400
too so for the what one of the things of

476
00:20:15,039 --> 00:20:20,760
DDT um affected tremendously were Birds

477
00:20:18,400 --> 00:20:23,320
of Prey so the big thing everyone will

478
00:20:20,760 --> 00:20:25,640
remember basically it's Hawks and Eagles

479
00:20:23,320 --> 00:20:28,240
are birds of prey two of the big uh

480
00:20:25,640 --> 00:20:30,480
species that are out there and we almost

481
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:32,799
lost all of the Eagles because what

482
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:34,200
happened is the shell of the egg got

483
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,880
thinner and thinner and thinner because

484
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:38,559
of

485
00:20:34,880 --> 00:20:42,679
DDT and basically when the mother or

486
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:46,200
father Eagle sat on the eggs they broke

487
00:20:42,679 --> 00:20:49,000
because they weighed too much um so now

488
00:20:46,200 --> 00:20:52,640
that we got rid of DD in I believe it

489
00:20:49,000 --> 00:20:55,799
was the 70s um the Eagles are making a

490
00:20:52,640 --> 00:20:58,600
comeback as everyone knows um but one of

491
00:20:55,799 --> 00:21:00,320
the issues with it is is that DDT was

492
00:20:58,600 --> 00:21:02,640
was one of those chemicals that we

493
00:21:00,320 --> 00:21:05,440
thought you put it on and did its job

494
00:21:02,640 --> 00:21:09,280
and killed everything and then it went

495
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:11,880
away uh guess what that's not true the

496
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:13,880
DDT is still around and we haven't had

497
00:21:11,880 --> 00:21:16,960
it on in what 40 years they haven't

498
00:21:13,880 --> 00:21:18,520
applied any and it's still in soil so

499
00:21:16,960 --> 00:21:20,480
we're finding out that some of the stuff

500
00:21:18,520 --> 00:21:22,840
we're doing isn't so good and one of the

501
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:24,440
things we'll learn in this class is we

502
00:21:22,840 --> 00:21:26,600
really really need to consider getting

503
00:21:24,440 --> 00:21:29,240
away from synthetic as much as we can if

504
00:21:26,600 --> 00:21:32,440
not totally

505
00:21:29,240 --> 00:21:34,960
um here's just an example of irrigation

506
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:37,159
and excuse me here's a crop of it looks

507
00:21:34,960 --> 00:21:40,120
like corn or potatoes it's hard to tell

508
00:21:37,159 --> 00:21:42,159
it's so small um but basically they just

509
00:21:40,120 --> 00:21:45,320
have those long units and they have

510
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:47,120
sprayers hanging off the the big uh

511
00:21:45,320 --> 00:21:49,120
silver part that you see up here is how

512
00:21:47,120 --> 00:21:51,600
the water goes across and that goes all

513
00:21:49,120 --> 00:21:53,320
the way down there um the wheels on it

514
00:21:51,600 --> 00:21:54,799
are so that they can have a motor we

515
00:21:53,320 --> 00:21:57,240
don't see it in this picture but it

516
00:21:54,799 --> 00:21:59,279
actually swings around on a pendulum and

517
00:21:57,240 --> 00:22:01,080
it can go across that whole fields and

518
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,720
what you see here is those lines that

519
00:22:01,080 --> 00:22:06,400
are there is where the tires going and

520
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:10,640
it actually uh ruins some of the crops

521
00:22:06,400 --> 00:22:12,120
but it still um does a good job watering

522
00:22:10,640 --> 00:22:13,520
and because you're watering it's in

523
00:22:12,120 --> 00:22:17,240
areas they probably don't have enough

524
00:22:13,520 --> 00:22:19,480
rain but things like corn and soybeans

525
00:22:17,240 --> 00:22:21,600
don't need to have rain generally the

526
00:22:19,480 --> 00:22:24,080
rain that you have in an area is enough

527
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:25,840
but when you get crops like the veggies

528
00:22:24,080 --> 00:22:27,480
you really really need to have

529
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:30,400
irrigation because they need more a lot

530
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:32,400
more water

531
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:34,440
okay now we're going to start looking at

532
00:22:32,400 --> 00:22:35,320
um how changes have started happening

533
00:22:34,440 --> 00:22:37,200
over

534
00:22:35,320 --> 00:22:40,159
time

535
00:22:37,200 --> 00:22:41,960
um in terms of plants and animals is how

536
00:22:40,159 --> 00:22:43,240
we're going to look at this changes

537
00:22:41,960 --> 00:22:46,120
we've had in that they've had new

538
00:22:43,240 --> 00:22:48,200
hybrids and varieties of crops every

539
00:22:46,120 --> 00:22:50,480
year they come out with one of the ways

540
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:52,120
we're getting higher and higher yields

541
00:22:50,480 --> 00:22:54,320
or the amount of crops we're pulling out

542
00:22:52,120 --> 00:22:56,279
of a field each year is they come out

543
00:22:54,320 --> 00:22:59,279
with new hybrids that will grow better

544
00:22:56,279 --> 00:23:03,360
in either a specific area a specific

545
00:22:59,279 --> 00:23:07,559
environment um or for a specific purpose

546
00:23:03,360 --> 00:23:09,480
um we've all heard the the term GMO um

547
00:23:07,559 --> 00:23:12,120
how they've accomplished this is they've

548
00:23:09,480 --> 00:23:14,880
done the genetically modified organism

549
00:23:12,120 --> 00:23:17,080
is what GMO stands for and that's how

550
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:20,360
they've come up with the new varieties

551
00:23:17,080 --> 00:23:22,600
basically when back in the olden days I

552
00:23:20,360 --> 00:23:24,840
guess I'll say they used to have what

553
00:23:22,600 --> 00:23:27,720
they called open pollinated crops and

554
00:23:24,840 --> 00:23:30,559
that was crops that basically if you

555
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:33,360
took like say an ear of corn and save

556
00:23:30,559 --> 00:23:36,159
the corn the next spring you could plant

557
00:23:33,360 --> 00:23:40,080
that corn and you get the same crop

558
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:42,320
again well they did that you know 40 45

559
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:44,039
bushel an acre and that wasn't enough it

560
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:46,520
wouldn't get anymore no matter what they

561
00:23:44,039 --> 00:23:48,600
did so they started uh geneticists

562
00:23:46,520 --> 00:23:52,880
started coming up with ways that they

563
00:23:48,600 --> 00:23:57,240
could produce more uh corn uh so you had

564
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:58,840
larger uh cobs of corn ears of corn um

565
00:23:57,240 --> 00:24:02,240
but when they did that what they're

566
00:23:58,840 --> 00:24:04,039
finding out now is that that GMO type

567
00:24:02,240 --> 00:24:07,320
stuff is starting to show up in the

568
00:24:04,039 --> 00:24:08,960
animals that are um eating it it's

569
00:24:07,320 --> 00:24:10,480
showing up in the people that are eating

570
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,960
the meat from the animals that are

571
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:16,480
eating the GMO corn so we're not sure

572
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:18,320
yet um what that means totally if it's

573
00:24:16,480 --> 00:24:21,039
good or bad but we're beginning to

574
00:24:18,320 --> 00:24:23,080
believe that perhaps the GMO might not

575
00:24:21,039 --> 00:24:25,159
have been the right thing and we might

576
00:24:23,080 --> 00:24:28,559
have to look at coming up with new

577
00:24:25,159 --> 00:24:30,720
hybrids um that maybe aren't as genetic

578
00:24:28,559 --> 00:24:32,640
Ally altered or certainly do studies to

579
00:24:30,720 --> 00:24:36,120
find out whether or not it's affecting

580
00:24:32,640 --> 00:24:39,520
us in a good or a bad way or animals

581
00:24:36,120 --> 00:24:41,919
too um in terms of some of the stuff

582
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:43,480
there are new cross breeds of animals

583
00:24:41,919 --> 00:24:46,039
and everyone's heard about the Clone

584
00:24:43,480 --> 00:24:48,600
sheep and the Clone cattle you know the

585
00:24:46,039 --> 00:24:50,919
the Betty the you know Barney whatever

586
00:24:48,600 --> 00:24:53,880
the names of these animals are England

587
00:24:50,919 --> 00:24:55,559
tends to be a place that has a lot of

588
00:24:53,880 --> 00:24:58,960
they've come up with a lot of cloned

589
00:24:55,559 --> 00:25:01,120
animals um basically what trying to do

590
00:24:58,960 --> 00:25:04,080
when they do either a cloned animal or a

591
00:25:01,120 --> 00:25:07,640
crossbreed is to pass on the desirable

592
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:09,320
traits from one let's say a cow to the

593
00:25:07,640 --> 00:25:12,399
next one so in other words if there's

594
00:25:09,320 --> 00:25:17,279
qualities about that cow it has too much

595
00:25:12,399 --> 00:25:21,799
fat it's it it doesn't walk very well um

596
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:25,120
it has leaner um meat uh all those types

597
00:25:21,799 --> 00:25:26,880
of things that they're going to pass

598
00:25:25,120 --> 00:25:28,640
just those one traits that they like

599
00:25:26,880 --> 00:25:30,880
onto it another thing is if if you had

600
00:25:28,640 --> 00:25:33,919
dairy cattle that they would produce

601
00:25:30,880 --> 00:25:36,279
more milk is the largest thing or you

602
00:25:33,919 --> 00:25:38,799
produce a chicken that'll produce U more

603
00:25:36,279 --> 00:25:43,640
meat or it'll lay more eggs that type of

604
00:25:38,799 --> 00:25:46,399
thing um in order to do this though um

605
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:48,440
the what they do is they try to do these

606
00:25:46,399 --> 00:25:51,159
things and then they'll use drugs and

607
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:52,720
medicines in order to help in that

608
00:25:51,159 --> 00:25:56,760
development

609
00:25:52,720 --> 00:25:58,600
um they aren't real sure at this point

610
00:25:56,760 --> 00:26:01,679
and it's becoming more and more more of

611
00:25:58,600 --> 00:26:03,880
a debate on whether or not these this

612
00:26:01,679 --> 00:26:06,760
Evolution has been a great thing or it's

613
00:26:03,880 --> 00:26:09,240
been a bad thing and it's it's I suppose

614
00:26:06,760 --> 00:26:10,520
like anything you uh you're going to

615
00:26:09,240 --> 00:26:12,880
have people that are on both sides of

616
00:26:10,520 --> 00:26:15,520
the fence but time will tell on

617
00:26:12,880 --> 00:26:18,960
that uh here's an example of one of the

618
00:26:15,520 --> 00:26:21,000
things that in the in the what used to

619
00:26:18,960 --> 00:26:22,960
always happen is here was an example

620
00:26:21,000 --> 00:26:25,720
where you have cattle feed Lots okay

621
00:26:22,960 --> 00:26:27,960
you're in a pasture on individual farms

622
00:26:25,720 --> 00:26:31,320
and here's an example where um there's

623
00:26:27,960 --> 00:26:34,559
not too many cattle here but in the

624
00:26:31,320 --> 00:26:37,000
cattle feed Lots there are thousands and

625
00:26:34,559 --> 00:26:40,440
thousands of cows and it's that um

626
00:26:37,000 --> 00:26:42,480
corporate farming and then it's it's in

627
00:26:40,440 --> 00:26:46,279
their opinion much cheaper to do that

628
00:26:42,480 --> 00:26:48,159
but we've had some issues with um when

629
00:26:46,279 --> 00:26:49,799
we've done that when you look at the

630
00:26:48,159 --> 00:26:51,799
cattle feed Lots you see how close they

631
00:26:49,799 --> 00:26:54,520
are together when the animals don't have

632
00:26:51,799 --> 00:26:56,679
as much room to roam one of the issues

633
00:26:54,520 --> 00:26:58,840
that they have is there's more pollution

634
00:26:56,679 --> 00:27:00,600
because they're generally not out on

635
00:26:58,840 --> 00:27:03,840
farms they're usually on the edge of

636
00:27:00,600 --> 00:27:05,600
towns and they have nowhere to uh take

637
00:27:03,840 --> 00:27:08,000
the animal waste and generally they just

638
00:27:05,600 --> 00:27:10,399
keep piling it up and piling it up

639
00:27:08,000 --> 00:27:12,600
whereas when it was on the Old Farm the

640
00:27:10,399 --> 00:27:14,799
individual Family Farm they used to take

641
00:27:12,600 --> 00:27:17,240
the um animal waste and spread it on the

642
00:27:14,799 --> 00:27:19,679
fields and use that as fertilizer that

643
00:27:17,240 --> 00:27:21,360
nitrogen um the other thing is when you

644
00:27:19,679 --> 00:27:24,799
have animals in a small area they're

645
00:27:21,360 --> 00:27:27,559
more prone to disease so therefore you

646
00:27:24,799 --> 00:27:29,559
had to start using antibiotics that they

647
00:27:27,559 --> 00:27:31,360
didn't use they have to use as much when

648
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:34,679
they're out on the individual Farms to

649
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:37,320
try to control the different um diseases

650
00:27:34,679 --> 00:27:37,320
that they might

651
00:27:39,159 --> 00:27:45,519
get um in terms of looking at these

652
00:27:43,039 --> 00:27:47,320
changes that we're seeing that single

653
00:27:45,519 --> 00:27:50,600
family farms are going away at an

654
00:27:47,320 --> 00:27:53,039
alarming rate and a lot of it used to be

655
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:55,760
that the oldest son would always take

656
00:27:53,039 --> 00:27:58,679
over um the family farm when Dad decided

657
00:27:55,760 --> 00:28:00,559
to retire and Dad and Grandpa help out

658
00:27:58,679 --> 00:28:02,760
on the farm but the son eventually had

659
00:28:00,559 --> 00:28:06,399
it the oldest one and that's generally

660
00:28:02,760 --> 00:28:08,519
what happened today it's pretty much all

661
00:28:06,399 --> 00:28:10,399
of the children are leaving the farm and

662
00:28:08,519 --> 00:28:12,919
when Dad retires they're selling the

663
00:28:10,399 --> 00:28:15,519
farm and it's becoming larger and larger

664
00:28:12,919 --> 00:28:17,840
and larger and more corporately owned um

665
00:28:15,519 --> 00:28:19,799
and how stuff is done is totally based

666
00:28:17,840 --> 00:28:21,399
on the kind of money you make not

667
00:28:19,799 --> 00:28:24,600
necessarily what's good for the

668
00:28:21,399 --> 00:28:26,840
environment um it's become also that

669
00:28:24,600 --> 00:28:29,760
because the

670
00:28:26,840 --> 00:28:32,880
um Cor corporate has kind of taken over

671
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:36,760
and made the large uh lots for raising

672
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:40,000
cattle that it isn't cost effective to

673
00:28:36,760 --> 00:28:42,320
raise cows or pigs as much as it used to

674
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,200
be they aren't making as much uh in

675
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:47,240
terms of Dairy Farmers they have to pick

676
00:28:44,200 --> 00:28:51,080
up the milk every day um and when you

677
00:28:47,240 --> 00:28:54,200
had the 30 40 cows those type of farms

678
00:28:51,080 --> 00:28:56,799
are pretty much going away and they're

679
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:59,960
you know setting Farms up with two three

680
00:28:56,799 --> 00:29:03,120
four 5,000 dairy cows that they're uh

681
00:28:59,960 --> 00:29:06,760
milking on a 24-hour operation so it's

682
00:29:03,120 --> 00:29:09,679
become tremendously different um in in

683
00:29:06,760 --> 00:29:12,279
in what's happening

684
00:29:09,679 --> 00:29:15,200
um the last point there is most crops

685
00:29:12,279 --> 00:29:17,519
are dependent on many factors and you

686
00:29:15,200 --> 00:29:20,360
need ideal settings in order for them to

687
00:29:17,519 --> 00:29:22,720
survive in other words that they're

688
00:29:20,360 --> 00:29:24,679
becoming more and more specialized in

689
00:29:22,720 --> 00:29:26,799
what they're able to do and how they

690
00:29:24,679 --> 00:29:30,519
produce but what happens is if you get

691
00:29:26,799 --> 00:29:34,200
out of that um environment that was

692
00:29:30,519 --> 00:29:36,960
ideal you might not get the kind of uh

693
00:29:34,200 --> 00:29:38,240
yield that you want to get so we've had

694
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:40,960
they're starting to have some issues

695
00:29:38,240 --> 00:29:43,799
with that that they're trying to address

696
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:45,279
uh and then just a little bit a few

697
00:29:43,799 --> 00:29:47,559
slides to talk about some of the

698
00:29:45,279 --> 00:29:49,200
limitations that we have currently which

699
00:29:47,559 --> 00:29:52,279
we've basically been talking about the

700
00:29:49,200 --> 00:29:54,360
whole way through um what we're finding

701
00:29:52,279 --> 00:29:57,720
out is that our model is not very

702
00:29:54,360 --> 00:29:59,919
sustainable which means that over time

703
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:01,480
it isn't going to let you keep going on

704
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:04,240
and on and on we're going to have to

705
00:30:01,480 --> 00:30:06,000
keep making changes add more fertilizer

706
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:08,640
you know add more pesticides or

707
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:12,600
herbicides or come up with new ones

708
00:30:08,640 --> 00:30:15,200
because what we have isn't regenerating

709
00:30:12,600 --> 00:30:17,799
what we need to have good example is the

710
00:30:15,200 --> 00:30:19,960
uh nutrients in the soil that because we

711
00:30:17,799 --> 00:30:22,120
don't have that it's not going to let us

712
00:30:19,960 --> 00:30:23,880
continue on the way we're going

713
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:26,600
eventually we're going to have to change

714
00:30:23,880 --> 00:30:28,399
that um another thing is populations are

715
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:30,279
growing cities are getting bigger so

716
00:30:28,399 --> 00:30:31,600
every year the amount of land that we

717
00:30:30,279 --> 00:30:34,760
Farm is

718
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:37,440
decreasing um and if you decrease the

719
00:30:34,760 --> 00:30:40,399
land the only way that you're going to

720
00:30:37,440 --> 00:30:42,360
produce enough food for everybody is to

721
00:30:40,399 --> 00:30:45,440
increase the yield of what you're

722
00:30:42,360 --> 00:30:48,600
growing um population growth of the

723
00:30:45,440 --> 00:30:50,600
world is out of control they're saying

724
00:30:48,600 --> 00:30:54,120
uh predictions are out there that by the

725
00:30:50,600 --> 00:30:56,679
year 2050 that if population continues

726
00:30:54,120 --> 00:30:59,320
to grow like it is right now they won't

727
00:30:56,679 --> 00:31:01,200
have enough food to feed the world we'll

728
00:30:59,320 --> 00:31:05,960
have massive

729
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:07,919
starvation um in the oceans um the

730
00:31:05,960 --> 00:31:09,200
ecosystems there are declining over time

731
00:31:07,919 --> 00:31:10,799
one of the problems is all the

732
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:13,480
fertilizers and pesticides and

733
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:15,120
herbicides are getting to the oceans and

734
00:31:13,480 --> 00:31:17,159
it's starting to filter in and affect

735
00:31:15,120 --> 00:31:20,919
the different uh flora and fauna that

736
00:31:17,159 --> 00:31:22,840
are out there um and it's it's affecting

737
00:31:20,919 --> 00:31:24,600
you know what we're going to have the

738
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:26,559
other thing they're having is in some

739
00:31:24,600 --> 00:31:28,480
areas especially like on the East Coast

740
00:31:26,559 --> 00:31:31,399
where they do a lot of uh

741
00:31:28,480 --> 00:31:33,000
uh fishing where boats go out and get

742
00:31:31,399 --> 00:31:34,880
all the different fish that are out

743
00:31:33,000 --> 00:31:38,960
there and then in the Gulf of Mexico

744
00:31:34,880 --> 00:31:40,120
they get all the um all the crabs and

745
00:31:38,960 --> 00:31:42,360
the crabs

746
00:31:40,120 --> 00:31:45,200
aren't aren't down there they're out

747
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:48,639
east but um the shrimp and those types

748
00:31:45,200 --> 00:31:51,880
of uh uh animals that they're over

749
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:54,080
fishing now uh another problem we are is

750
00:31:51,880 --> 00:31:55,519
we're coral reefs are dying due to that

751
00:31:54,080 --> 00:32:00,279
fertilizer

752
00:31:55,519 --> 00:32:02,960
population um they aren't excuse me they

753
00:32:00,279 --> 00:32:05,919
aren't sure but they believe that the

754
00:32:02,960 --> 00:32:08,279
GMO genetics um are starting to cause

755
00:32:05,919 --> 00:32:10,000
pollution also and that's just in the

756
00:32:08,279 --> 00:32:13,039
infancy of looking at that so we'll

757
00:32:10,000 --> 00:32:15,000
learn more as time goes on of that um

758
00:32:13,039 --> 00:32:17,600
another issue we have is the amount of

759
00:32:15,000 --> 00:32:19,559
water we have the fresh water um you

760
00:32:17,600 --> 00:32:21,399
can't use salt water from the oceans

761
00:32:19,559 --> 00:32:23,120
which there's a ton of you have to use

762
00:32:21,399 --> 00:32:25,720
fresh water so that's either comes from

763
00:32:23,120 --> 00:32:29,200
a well the aquifers in the ground or

764
00:32:25,720 --> 00:32:31,720
from lakes and ponds and what we're

765
00:32:29,200 --> 00:32:34,399
using is increasing and increasing at an

766
00:32:31,720 --> 00:32:37,159
alarming rate certainly faster than it's

767
00:32:34,399 --> 00:32:38,320
being replenished in those aquifers

768
00:32:37,159 --> 00:32:41,360
lakes and

769
00:32:38,320 --> 00:32:43,639
ponds um also animal feed lots are

770
00:32:41,360 --> 00:32:46,880
increasing in size so the pollution we

771
00:32:43,639 --> 00:32:48,679
have the amount of uh uh medicines that

772
00:32:46,880 --> 00:32:50,679
we have to give the animals and that is

773
00:32:48,679 --> 00:32:53,440
increasing so that's all going to affect

774
00:32:50,679 --> 00:32:56,440
our health as humans and things we want

775
00:32:53,440 --> 00:32:59,760
to try to to uh reduce

776
00:32:56,440 --> 00:33:01,559
that um what we're also learning is that

777
00:32:59,760 --> 00:33:03,799
there's residues from the fertilizers

778
00:33:01,559 --> 00:33:09,000
pesticides herbicides and insecticides

779
00:33:03,799 --> 00:33:11,120
which um we use and what we need to do

780
00:33:09,000 --> 00:33:13,159
is because it leeches out into the uh

781
00:33:11,120 --> 00:33:16,720
water tables into the streams fonds and

782
00:33:13,159 --> 00:33:20,559
rivers we need to reduce that um also

783
00:33:16,720 --> 00:33:22,320
the uh the level of acid in the ocean is

784
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,519
increasing at a higher rate in other

785
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:27,039
words it's taking the oxygen out that it

786
00:33:24,519 --> 00:33:28,320
has and it's destroying the coral floral

787
00:33:27,039 --> 00:33:31,399
re from

788
00:33:28,320 --> 00:33:34,120
in many areas which um they don't

789
00:33:31,399 --> 00:33:36,679
totally understand all of those things

790
00:33:34,120 --> 00:33:39,600
but they do know that everything around

791
00:33:36,679 --> 00:33:42,320
it is affected by those coral reefs de

792
00:33:39,600 --> 00:33:45,440
decreasing in size and coral reefs are

793
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:47,919
live uh organisms and they're dying at

794
00:33:45,440 --> 00:33:50,120
an alarming rate all over the

795
00:33:47,919 --> 00:33:53,279
world okay

796
00:33:50,120 --> 00:33:55,799
um some of the limitations we have for

797
00:33:53,279 --> 00:33:58,000
soil degradation and we using the

798
00:33:55,799 --> 00:34:00,799
fertilizer what we're finding out it's

799
00:33:58,000 --> 00:34:03,840
just taking the nutrients out um what it

800
00:34:00,799 --> 00:34:06,039
also is doing is they call it their

801
00:34:03,840 --> 00:34:09,079
nutrients are bound up in other words

802
00:34:06,039 --> 00:34:11,320
the makeup of the soil is changing so

803
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:13,760
that the nutrients that that are there

804
00:34:11,320 --> 00:34:15,359
are in a state that they aren't allowed

805
00:34:13,760 --> 00:34:17,320
to be used in other words the soil's

806
00:34:15,359 --> 00:34:19,599
keeping them and not letting the crops

807
00:34:17,320 --> 00:34:20,839
use them so what's happening with that

808
00:34:19,599 --> 00:34:24,560
that means that you're going to get less

809
00:34:20,839 --> 00:34:26,119
of a crop yield um one of the things

810
00:34:24,560 --> 00:34:28,119
they really believe to become

811
00:34:26,119 --> 00:34:30,960
sustainable is that you have to get rid

812
00:34:28,119 --> 00:34:32,919
of the monocropping what monocropping is

813
00:34:30,960 --> 00:34:35,399
is that you're putting the same type of

814
00:34:32,919 --> 00:34:39,159
plant in year after year after year

815
00:34:35,399 --> 00:34:42,399
after year um it used to be over time

816
00:34:39,159 --> 00:34:44,200
that um every third or fourth year they

817
00:34:42,399 --> 00:34:45,919
used to rust the land and how you used

818
00:34:44,200 --> 00:34:48,760
to rest the land is put in something

819
00:34:45,919 --> 00:34:50,839
like wheat or oats or just don't put

820
00:34:48,760 --> 00:34:53,560
anything in and put in some type of

821
00:34:50,839 --> 00:34:55,599
cover crop with another possibility and

822
00:34:53,560 --> 00:34:57,440
that put nitrogen back in the soils

823
00:34:55,599 --> 00:34:59,960
those type of plants would put nitrogen

824
00:34:57,440 --> 00:35:02,400
back back in and it used to be that they

825
00:34:59,960 --> 00:35:05,079
one year they put soybeans the next year

826
00:35:02,400 --> 00:35:07,200
they put corn the next year they uh put

827
00:35:05,079 --> 00:35:09,000
in wheat and then they go through that

828
00:35:07,200 --> 00:35:11,040
same cycle again and that would add the

829
00:35:09,000 --> 00:35:13,320
nitrogen back into the soil which was

830
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:15,359
good because we don't do that anymore

831
00:35:13,320 --> 00:35:19,040
and we're just putting on the synthetic

832
00:35:15,359 --> 00:35:20,400
um fertilizer nitrogen um it's not it's

833
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:23,880
making the soil worse and worse and

834
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:26,280
worse as we go over time um other

835
00:35:23,880 --> 00:35:27,800
problem is in the vegetable Fields we're

836
00:35:26,280 --> 00:35:30,040
overwatering

837
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:32,280
and that's promoting that pollution by

838
00:35:30,040 --> 00:35:35,800
salinization which is too much salt in

839
00:35:32,280 --> 00:35:37,839
the soil and then um we're also over

840
00:35:35,800 --> 00:35:39,440
grazing the pastures and basically what

841
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:42,200
that is you're putting too many animals

842
00:35:39,440 --> 00:35:44,920
in a small area for the ones that are

843
00:35:42,200 --> 00:35:48,200
grazing and they eat up all of the uh

844
00:35:44,920 --> 00:35:50,240
crop or the grasses that are there and

845
00:35:48,200 --> 00:35:52,720
therefore it's more expensive to feed

846
00:35:50,240 --> 00:35:55,400
them um there's more disease it'll come

847
00:35:52,720 --> 00:35:57,240
because it's all dirt uh the wind will

848
00:35:55,400 --> 00:36:00,200
get the erosion issues so there's all

849
00:35:57,240 --> 00:36:02,480
kinds of things that come into play um

850
00:36:00,200 --> 00:36:05,000
when you're doing

851
00:36:02,480 --> 00:36:07,599
that this is a list of all the

852
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:09,680
attributions um all the pictures we had

853
00:36:07,599 --> 00:36:11,079
in here and where they're at so I'll

854
00:36:09,680 --> 00:36:14,599
leave this up for a little bit so you

855
00:36:11,079 --> 00:36:14,599
can see that
