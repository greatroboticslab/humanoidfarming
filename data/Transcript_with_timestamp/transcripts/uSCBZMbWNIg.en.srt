1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,000
I've been trying to figure out when to

2
00:00:01,280 --> 00:00:06,440
plant seeds no matter how I count the

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:08,920
days it's still too early we're only at

4
00:00:06,440 --> 00:00:11,120
February 5th right now our last frost is

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:13,799
May 15th it's still a little bit too

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,320
early to keep things inside so mini

7
00:00:13,799 --> 00:00:18,800
Greenhouse macro Greenhouse both are

8
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:21,560
great ways to plant seeds winter sewing

9
00:00:18,800 --> 00:00:24,160
is a great way to grow flowers for your

10
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:25,640
summer garden and it's fast and easy and

11
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,599
something to do in the winter time

12
00:00:25,640 --> 00:00:29,400
winter sewing seeds is basically

13
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,480
providing the ideal conditions for the

14
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,439
seeds to

15
00:00:30,480 --> 00:00:34,600
when they are ready I find that's often

16
00:00:32,439 --> 00:00:37,040
the hardest part about planting seeds

17
00:00:34,600 --> 00:00:38,600
indoors in the spring from when you

18
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:41,039
plant it how many days does it take to

19
00:00:38,600 --> 00:00:42,600
germinate and then how many days should

20
00:00:41,039 --> 00:00:44,280
it grow in a pot before you put it

21
00:00:42,600 --> 00:00:47,800
outside how long do you have to huren it

22
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:49,399
off for but if I plant things outside

23
00:00:47,800 --> 00:00:51,760
basically I don't have to worry about

24
00:00:49,399 --> 00:00:53,359
the timing so winter sewing mimics what

25
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:55,000
happens in nature which is always the

26
00:00:53,359 --> 00:00:56,480
best approach for our Gardens we're

27
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:58,199
going to prepare some containers for

28
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:59,960
winter sewing a lot of people use milk

29
00:00:58,199 --> 00:01:01,680
jugs that seems to be the most popular

30
00:00:59,960 --> 00:01:03,280
popular thing that I see I'm using what

31
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
I have around and I have these

32
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:08,080
containers that we got pears and peaches

33
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:09,759
in this summer so they're great because

34
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:11,360
they're clear plastic you want something

35
00:01:09,759 --> 00:01:12,799
that's either clear or translucent that

36
00:01:11,360 --> 00:01:14,759
can let the light in I'm going to fill

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:16,479
it up with a little bit of soil so

38
00:01:14,759 --> 00:01:18,119
you're going to sprinkle the seeds on

39
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:20,360
the top and you're going to put just a

40
00:01:18,119 --> 00:01:22,159
little bit of soil on top and Tamp it

41
00:01:20,360 --> 00:01:24,119
down we're going to close the lid and

42
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:26,159
we're going to label it so we remember

43
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:27,560
what we planted in here and then we're

44
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:30,159
going to put this outside so it's going

45
00:01:27,560 --> 00:01:31,680
to go outside into a sunny location

46
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:33,560
that's going to get some rain that isn't

47
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:35,200
sheltered but that isn't right out in

48
00:01:33,560 --> 00:01:36,360
the open in the middle of your yard you

49
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:37,960
don't want it anywhere that's going to

50
00:01:36,360 --> 00:01:40,360
blow away so what we're doing when we

51
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:42,000
make these little mini green houses is

52
00:01:40,360 --> 00:01:44,040
similar to what happens in this

53
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:46,040
greenhouse even though they're exposed

54
00:01:44,040 --> 00:01:48,479
to the elements so when it gets cold it

55
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,640
will get cold it gets as cold on our

56
00:01:48,479 --> 00:01:53,320
maximan thermometer I can see as minus

57
00:01:50,640 --> 00:01:54,759
10 Celsius in this greenhouse that would

58
00:01:53,320 --> 00:01:57,360
probably be in the middle of the night

59
00:01:54,759 --> 00:01:59,000
during a cold night with no sun but then

60
00:01:57,360 --> 00:02:00,920
during the day when it heats up when the

61
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:02,960
sun coming in I can see it's been as

62
00:02:00,920 --> 00:02:05,240
high as 30 degrees Celsius in here on a

63
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:07,079
sunny day so the same thing is going to

64
00:02:05,240 --> 00:02:09,200
happen in this small container also

65
00:02:07,079 --> 00:02:11,319
important is the small container has

66
00:02:09,200 --> 00:02:13,599
holes in the bottom where it's going to

67
00:02:11,319 --> 00:02:15,959
be able to drain water the same as this

68
00:02:13,599 --> 00:02:17,800
drains water just into the ground and it

69
00:02:15,959 --> 00:02:20,760
has holes in the top what this does is

70
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:23,280
it protects as well from the elements so

71
00:02:20,760 --> 00:02:25,840
the ground here and in here is protected

72
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:27,400
from this snowfall so there's not ice on

73
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:29,959
the surface where the seeds would have a

74
00:02:27,400 --> 00:02:32,840
hard time breaking through there's not

75
00:02:29,959 --> 00:02:35,480
wind drying out the seedlings or drying

76
00:02:32,840 --> 00:02:37,239
out the seeds or moving the seeds around

77
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:38,480
they're in a protected environment

78
00:02:37,239 --> 00:02:40,239
that's going to allow them to germinate

79
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:42,040
a little bit better so this technique

80
00:02:40,239 --> 00:02:43,959
works really well for a lot of plants

81
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:46,800
but it works well especially for plants

82
00:02:43,959 --> 00:02:50,200
that need cold and moist stratification

83
00:02:46,800 --> 00:02:52,560
plants will wait until they've had a

84
00:02:50,200 --> 00:02:55,000
cold period before they germinate this

85
00:02:52,560 --> 00:02:57,200
is mimicking our natural Seasons you've

86
00:02:55,000 --> 00:02:59,360
got a wet Autumn period then you've got

87
00:02:57,200 --> 00:03:00,720
a cold winter and then you have spring

88
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:02,400
where the temperatures are starting to

89
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:05,000
warm up you don't need to harden these

90
00:03:02,400 --> 00:03:07,480
plants off so they're already germinated

91
00:03:05,000 --> 00:03:09,239
outside growing outside you may need to

92
00:03:07,480 --> 00:03:10,840
just let them adjust to the wind a

93
00:03:09,239 --> 00:03:12,799
little bit but other than that they

94
00:03:10,840 --> 00:03:14,319
should be pretty hearty and strong

95
00:03:12,799 --> 00:03:16,120
compared to a Seedling that you grew in

96
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:18,239
the house and ured under lights some

97
00:03:16,120 --> 00:03:20,360
perennial seeds that you may be growing

98
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:25,360
uh are plants that are native to our

99
00:03:20,360 --> 00:03:28,360
area like milkweed Ando Joie weed Lupin

100
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:30,720
colines also things like eonia some

101
00:03:28,360 --> 00:03:33,319
herbs as well ch I'm going to do some

102
00:03:30,720 --> 00:03:35,319
winter savory some time it works to do a

103
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:37,000
lot of the sort of Summer annual flowers

104
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:39,680
it's an easy way to grow a lot of them

105
00:03:37,000 --> 00:03:43,319
things like zenas am hiip bachelor

106
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:45,040
buttons alysum pangula these are seeds

107
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:46,319
that often will self seen in my garden

108
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:48,439
but I'm going to grow them just in a

109
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:50,040
more controlled environment here and

110
00:03:48,439 --> 00:03:52,599
then I can sort of determine where they

111
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:54,400
should go in a better way so here we are

112
00:03:52,599 --> 00:03:56,319
in our unheated Greenhouse even though

113
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:58,079
we just got a big dump of snow you can

114
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:59,799
see there's snow on the roof snow on the

115
00:03:58,079 --> 00:04:02,280
sides I just had to shovel a path to to

116
00:03:59,799 --> 00:04:04,319
the door the ground in here is still

117
00:04:02,280 --> 00:04:06,720
obviously not covered with snow There's

118
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,959
an opportunity to actually plant seeds

119
00:04:06,720 --> 00:04:09,159
what we're doing here is we're just

120
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:10,920
going to plant them in the ground right

121
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:12,760
now and then they're going to germinate

122
00:04:10,920 --> 00:04:14,159
when they're ready I don't have to worry

123
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:15,560
about how long it takes them to

124
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:16,840
germinate I don't have to worry about

125
00:04:15,560 --> 00:04:18,400
what temperature they're at I don't have

126
00:04:16,840 --> 00:04:19,959
to worry about hardening them off I'm

127
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:22,280
just going to put them in the ground and

128
00:04:19,959 --> 00:04:24,360
see what happens it's been quite quite

129
00:04:22,280 --> 00:04:26,360
cold lately I just want a little layer

130
00:04:24,360 --> 00:04:30,800
of Extra Protection here so I'm going to

131
00:04:26,360 --> 00:04:33,400
fill in the rose with spinach seed seeds

132
00:04:30,800 --> 00:04:35,199
where it didn't quite come up as much as

133
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:37,479
I would have liked it to and I can see

134
00:04:35,199 --> 00:04:39,960
there's three rows here and here I'm

135
00:04:37,479 --> 00:04:42,919
just planting it right in between where

136
00:04:39,960 --> 00:04:45,120
the seeds are so even though the spinach

137
00:04:42,919 --> 00:04:47,199
is very small right now I'm always

138
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:49,560
amazed at how fast it grows once it gets

139
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,400
going once the days get longer the

140
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:55,680
temperatures get warmer it really really

141
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:58,160
takes off fast so it goes from having

142
00:04:55,680 --> 00:05:00,240
just like two little leaves it's got its

143
00:04:58,160 --> 00:05:01,919
calans and its first set leaves it

144
00:05:00,240 --> 00:05:04,039
second set of leaves are just starting

145
00:05:01,919 --> 00:05:05,880
it'll like double in size in a week as

146
00:05:04,039 --> 00:05:08,240
soon as it starts growing spinach really

147
00:05:05,880 --> 00:05:10,639
likes the cold weather having it out

148
00:05:08,240 --> 00:05:13,120
like this is ideal for it it'll actually

149
00:05:10,639 --> 00:05:15,280
grow better I find in a greenhouse like

150
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:17,440
this in March than it will out in the

151
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:20,280
garden once the weather gets warm it

152
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:20,280
stops growing as

153
00:05:23,560 --> 00:05:26,560
quickly
