00:00:00,120 --> 00:00:03,639
welcome to another guide for the new

2
00:00:01,520 --> 00:00:04,960
game repo if this video is old check the

3
00:00:03,639 --> 00:00:07,040
descriptions for any updates that may

4
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:08,639
have changed in these mechanics lastly

5
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:10,280
all the information this video is from

6
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:13,120
the games code so

7
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:15,280
[Music]

8
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:17,199
enjoy getting started there are three

9
00:00:15,280 --> 00:00:18,640
levels of entities coded into the game

10
00:00:17,199 --> 00:00:20,960
which will be important to distinguish

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:23,119
when understanding enemy spawns level

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:26,679
one entities include the Peeper Shadow

13
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:29,439
child for Nomes apex predator and spewer

14
00:00:26,679 --> 00:00:33,040
level two entities include Rugrat animal

15
00:00:29,439 --> 00:00:35,360
upscreen hidden Chef bow tie Mentalist

16
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:39,079
and three bangers level three entities

17
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:41,559
include the headman robe Huntsman Reaper

18
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:42,879
clown and trudge all have an equal

19
00:00:41,559 --> 00:00:45,079
chance to spawn in their respective

20
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:49,559
level so odds of getting a peeper is the

21
00:00:45,079 --> 00:00:51,480
same as a shadow child however 4.66 56%

22
00:00:49,559 --> 00:00:53,320
of the time a level three slot can be

23
00:00:51,480 --> 00:00:55,800
taken up by a set of lower level

24
00:00:53,320 --> 00:00:58,559
entities these sets are limited to three

25
00:00:55,800 --> 00:01:00,640
animals three bow ties three mentalists

26
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:03,120
two hidden three shf

27
00:01:00,640 --> 00:01:06,400
three upsc screams three Rugrats three

28
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:09,240
peepers four apex predators four spewers

29
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:11,560
four shattered Childs six bangers or 10

30
00:01:09,240 --> 00:01:13,080
gnomes just as an example to understand

31
00:01:11,560 --> 00:01:15,200
this a little better a level three

32
00:01:13,080 --> 00:01:17,040
monster such as a clown might instead be

33
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:19,280
replaced by three animals on a given

34
00:01:17,040 --> 00:01:22,680
level however there can't be two animals

35
00:01:19,280 --> 00:01:24,520
and a chef taking up that level three

36
00:01:22,680 --> 00:01:26,799
[Music]

37
00:01:24,520 --> 00:01:28,600
slot what types of monsters will spawn

38
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:30,439
will be based off their monster level

39
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:33,240
mentioned before and the game level you

40
00:01:30,439 --> 00:01:35,159
are on for game levels 1 to two there

41
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:37,240
will be a level one monster and a level

42
00:01:35,159 --> 00:01:38,759
three monster so for example on your

43
00:01:37,240 --> 00:01:41,560
first round of playing repo you could

44
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:43,439
get a huntsman just like we did you know

45
00:01:41,560 --> 00:01:46,040
I'm glad you so we're all around the

46
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:48,920
same same PB got some Goods here guys

47
00:01:46,040 --> 00:01:50,520
what color am I for game levels 3 to 5

48
00:01:48,920 --> 00:01:52,600
there will be one of each monster level

49
00:01:50,520 --> 00:01:53,960
present for game levels 6 to 8 there

50
00:01:52,600 --> 00:01:56,079
will be two of each monster level

51
00:01:53,960 --> 00:01:58,600
present for game levels 9 to 10 there

52
00:01:56,079 --> 00:02:00,840
will be two level ones three level twoos

53
00:01:58,600 --> 00:02:03,039
and two level three entities

54
00:02:00,840 --> 00:02:05,600
and on levels 11 and higher there will

55
00:02:03,039 --> 00:02:07,560
be two level one three level two and

56
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:09,520
three level three entities meaning

57
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:11,680
technically the difficulty tapers off at

58
00:02:09,520 --> 00:02:13,360
level 11 monster spawns will not change

59
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:15,000
during the level so if you get three

60
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:16,070
clowns be ready to see them for the

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:18,879
entire

62
00:02:16,070 --> 00:02:21,360
[Music]

63
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:23,879
level when beginning any level entities

64
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:25,920
will spawn in after 2 to 5 seconds on

65
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:28,080
the furthest level points from the truck

66
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:29,400
and be forced to just sit there in idle

67
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:30,640
for a certain amount of time depending

68
00:02:29,400 --> 00:02:32,280
on the level

69
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:34,000
shown in front of you are the idle time

70
00:02:32,280 --> 00:02:35,480
ranges for all the levels pause the

71
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:37,160
video if you would like but the too long

72
00:02:35,480 --> 00:02:39,000
didn't read version is that level one

73
00:02:37,160 --> 00:02:41,040
has the highest idle time at 2 to 3

74
00:02:39,000 --> 00:02:43,080
minutes and then idle time decreases the

75
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:45,560
further you progress until Level 11

76
00:02:43,080 --> 00:02:47,200
where the idle time hits 0 seconds

77
00:02:45,560 --> 00:02:49,159
regardless of the idle time it will

78
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:53,440
become active if a player comes within

79
00:02:49,159 --> 00:02:53,440
20 units or a monster plays an attack

80
00:02:55,280 --> 00:02:59,599
audio after 3 to 4 minutes into a level

81
00:02:57,879 --> 00:03:02,000
entities get a short timer that ticks

82
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:04,680
down when over 20 units away from all

83
00:03:02,000 --> 00:03:07,280
players after which they despawn this

84
00:03:04,680 --> 00:03:09,080
timer is 20 to 40 seconds when the

85
00:03:07,280 --> 00:03:11,480
monster despawns it will be put in a

86
00:03:09,080 --> 00:03:13,560
respawn timer this timer starts at 4 to

87
00:03:11,480 --> 00:03:16,200
5 minutes but gradually decreases as

88
00:03:13,560 --> 00:03:17,879
more time is spent on the level for the

89
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:19,879
first 10 minutes of the level despawn

90
00:03:17,879 --> 00:03:21,959
entities will be on a 4 to 5 minute

91
00:03:19,879 --> 00:03:24,760
timer and every 10 minutes after the

92
00:03:21,959 --> 00:03:26,599
timer will start to lower until around

93
00:03:24,760 --> 00:03:28,480
50 minutes and higher entities will

94
00:03:26,599 --> 00:03:30,840
respawn almost instantly with their

95
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,439
timer only at 1 second second what can

96
00:03:30,840 --> 00:03:34,480
really help early in the level is that

97
00:03:32,439 --> 00:03:37,120
monsters killed by the player have this

98
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:38,840
timer multiplied by three so in the

99
00:03:37,120 --> 00:03:41,040
first 10 minutes killing a monster puts

100
00:03:38,840 --> 00:03:43,319
it on a respawn timer for 12 to 15

101
00:03:41,040 --> 00:03:45,120
minutes but killing a monster after 15

102
00:03:43,319 --> 00:03:47,439
minutes will just have it respawn after

103
00:03:45,120 --> 00:03:50,439
3 seconds so in a way it's super

104
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:52,159
beneficial to play Fast once again

105
00:03:50,439 --> 00:03:54,079
entity spawns will not change for the

106
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:56,920
given level a good strategy I've been

107
00:03:54,079 --> 00:03:58,840
using is if you have an area that's very

108
00:03:56,920 --> 00:04:01,200
far away from an entity and you want

109
00:03:58,840 --> 00:04:03,480
that entity out of your way you can just

110
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:05,760
chill in that very far area until the

111
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:06,790
entity despawns by just waiting that 20

112
00:04:05,760 --> 00:04:09,799
to 40

113
00:04:06,790 --> 00:04:12,120
[Music]

114
00:04:09,799 --> 00:04:13,799
seconds the final extraction is probably

115
00:04:12,120 --> 00:04:15,239
the most dangerous part of this game

116
00:04:13,799 --> 00:04:17,199
when the last extraction for the level

117
00:04:15,239 --> 00:04:19,519
is complete any monsters on their

118
00:04:17,199 --> 00:04:21,600
respawn timer will respawn immediately

119
00:04:19,519 --> 00:04:24,639
and all monsters now have a 1second

120
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:27,560
respawn timer the monsters will also now

121
00:04:24,639 --> 00:04:29,199
path to the truck room for 12 seconds

122
00:04:27,560 --> 00:04:31,840
after which they path into a room that a

123
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:33,320
player occupies every 3 seconds so

124
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:35,320
pretty much as you're running around the

125
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:36,400
interior the monsters are going to know

126
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,000
what room you're in and they're just

127
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,560
going to patrol that room kind of sucks

128
00:04:39,000 --> 00:04:42,400
we found a good strategy to just send

129
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:43,800
one player back early before you fulfill

130
00:04:42,400 --> 00:04:45,199
the final extraction and that way you

131
00:04:43,800 --> 00:04:47,240
already have someone at ship in case

132
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:49,199
everyone dies if you want to catch me

133
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:50,880
try Harding repo or any other game I

134
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,120
stream every day and a huge shout out to

135
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,800
Shibu for helping me get this

136
00:04:52,120 --> 00:04:55,400
information from the code hope to see

137
00:04:53,800 --> 00:04:58,720
you back in the future for more tips and

138
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:58,720
repo gameplay
