  "text": "looks like we got a problem Houston my wheel fell off it didn't even realize it till it fell off reason being the bearings disintegrated because I drove it in the pond a couple times last year to rescue some stuff cars and trucks well as I mentioned before water and wheel bearings kills them so I've got the axle shaft on the spindle all cleaned off got the bearing hole cleaned out on both sides and grease and broken bearing bits out now I have to show you how to get a wheel bearing off are the pieces this is the same as you do it for like for example the rear of a car or if it's a rear-wheel drive car how to get the wheel bearings out of the front rotors luckily for me when you have a tractor it has the option of lifting up any wheel you want to you know so you don't have to use a jack cool so first thing you notice we're now looking at the back side of the wheel the big bearing has a notch in the hub on both sides that's your removal notch I'll show you how that works you get a steel bar or a big bolt with a flat end on one end and you flip your wheel or tire over so that the bearing hub is facing towards the ground now you use your big hammer steel bar drop it down each notch give a few taps on one side and a few taps neither side and keep tapping back and forth with your hammer until you knock the bearing out save the old piece of bearing you need it to reinstall the new one so you hold your steel bar and angle like that and start whacking if I only took about eight wax and my bearing piece is out oh there it is now put that aside for reinstallation to put the new one in there's your new part the new piece we got to press in new bearing hub and race and XL dust seal so just make sure there's a bit of grease around the surface and set that in the hole with the widest portion always facing out then you set the wheel flat on the ground clean up this piece of and you use this to reinstall the bearing and you also put it in with the widest peace and peace facing outwards then you put a block of flats teal or something on it and tap it in with the hammer now I have a perfect installation tool set that on there may be that way works better and start whacking have to tap it evenly get it down square perfect got to love it now at the same method on the other side use your flattened n steel bar catch the ridge of the other bearing and knock it out packed a sucker with locks of grease and with your hands pack that with lots of grease 2 of course it's got a big calves Ian Ayre to hold grease and you're all set for installation the inner part of the bearing is in the hole now pre grease the rubber part of the new seal and install it and tap it on square 20 got the other part of the bearing packed and ready for installation put wash your on and your big called a castellated nut castellated part always goes outwards then the first setting you make it is a little bit tight then you rotate the wheel a few times set it off then I back the bearing off to make it looser to the first Cotter key hole lines up I put the car turkey in than the end and that's how you set the wheel bearing have the right amount of play which is almost no play but you never run it with a tight wheel bearing or it'll get hot when you burn it out so now trying to put the dust cap on and we're all done",
