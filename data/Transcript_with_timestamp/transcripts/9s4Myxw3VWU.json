  "text": "[Music] welcome to the northwest weekly agri updates i'm sally baumain livestock officer with the northwest local land services ag advisory team coming to you this week from the shelter of a hayshed because it seems every tuesday the weather is atrocious at the minute this week i just wanted to touch base and talk about bloat so i'm going to get a lot of um inquiry and i suppose concern um about bloat for this spring uh there seems to be a huge amount of clover uh in the pasture paddocks and also the loosens really on fire at the minute and whilst that's awesome um and i guess sign of a cracking spring it can be really scary from a bloat perspective uh especially given the value of cattle at the minute bloat's a hard one because there's no magic bullet to controlling bloat unfortunately we saw bloat capsules go off the market a few years ago and they've yet to return so romansen does have a label claim for bloat uh but you know in a loose lick form it really is difficult to get enough into them but it can it can help so i loosely that contains romance and certainly won't do any harm but one um they might be able to eat enough of it to get the full dose to to claim bloat control um the other thing we can do if we have the luxury of other feeds to graze for the meantime is just hold off putting stock on pastures until the clover and the loosens in flour does tend to get a lot less risky once it has flowered so if you are in that situation it might be worth worth holding off grazing for a little while um if you're not uh introducing stock gradually so just allowing stock access to the risky paddock for sort of an hour might not even be an hour so please don't set and forget put stock on there and really keep an eye on them for those first few days and see how they're going and then also make sure the stock aren't hungry when they go on so even stock that have been successfully grazing a high legume content paddock a few hours in the yards to do whatever and then return to the paddock can be detrimental so please let them fill up on on safe feeds first the other thing too is our pastures can get a bit less risky uh as the day progresses so instead of turning stock first thing in the morning give the plants an hour or two to photosensitise and things like that and and that can help if you are in a position where you've only got water troughs in your paddock medicating them with a bloat oil can be handy unfortunately for a lot of people though given the amount of rain we've seen there's so much surface water about that might not be an option um but certainly products that contain bloat oil can help there's some licks and some blocks on the market that that do contain that product and it might be of assistance the other thing to bear in mind is sometimes bloat and pulpit kidney can look the same in the end result which unfortunately is an animal legs up in the air and quite inflated so five in one is not a particularly expensive um product to give uh so it might be worth giving um stock a shot of that um if they haven't had one uh in the last sort of six to eight weeks and you are in a high risk area a shot might might help and then a shot every six to eight weeks after that just for the pulpit kidney aspect the custodial vaccines are really good at everything else um but the nature of pulpit kidney means that um even if it's uh within the annual booster um they they still might need a shot or look at the product that's got the longer the longer poppy kidney claim on it [Music] as always the district vets are on hand to answer any queries that you have or feel free to contact the ag team we wish you luck and we hope everybody's staying well and safe at the moment and we hope we get to see you all around the trap soon cheers you",
