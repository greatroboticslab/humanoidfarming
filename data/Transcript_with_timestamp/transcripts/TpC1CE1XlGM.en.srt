we do

12
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:44,640
a great deal of training we talked about

13
00:00:42,320 --> 00:00:47,120
this earlier with our technicians in

14
00:00:44,640 --> 00:00:49,120
particular product updates things are

15
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:51,360
always changing we spend a great deal of

16
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:54,000
time and money on training to make sure

17
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:56,000
they have the latest knowledge on what's

18
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:57,600
going on with the machinery any updates

19
00:00:56,000 --> 00:00:59,039
what have you

20
00:00:57,600 --> 00:01:01,680
we're fortunate that we are close to

21
00:00:59,039 --> 00:01:04,080
racine where there is a great deal of

22
00:01:01,680 --> 00:01:06,080
case training available as well as iowa

23
00:01:04,080 --> 00:01:07,600
but our sales people as well they need

24
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:10,159
to learn about the new products every

25
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,600
year so they're going and in our parts

26
00:01:10,159 --> 00:01:13,360
and in other areas we look for

27
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:14,720
opportunities if someone has an interest

28
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:16,479
in something that they might like to

29
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:18,560
attend we're certainly willing to

30
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:21,200
support that as well but

31
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:22,880
we see it mostly in our technician area

32
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:24,479
we try to keep a good handle on the

33
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:27,840
classes they have had and classes that

34
00:01:24,479 --> 00:01:27,840
they might be interested in taking

35
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:33,360
we want to make sure that a technician

36
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:34,960
has

37
00:01:33,360 --> 00:01:37,439
the service level one before they move

38
00:01:34,960 --> 00:01:40,000
to a service level two and that's just

39
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,320
the simple bookkeeping part of it but it

40
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:44,479
also tells us areas

41
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:46,399
make sure we have certified technicians

42
00:01:44,479 --> 00:01:47,600
in all areas you want don't want to sell

43
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:49,520
a piece of equipment if you don't have

44
00:01:47,600 --> 00:01:51,040
the people there to service it and

45
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:52,640
support it so

46
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:54,320
case is good about tracking it for us

47
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,320
but we like to do that as well to make

48
00:01:54,320 --> 00:01:59,200
sure we're covering all the bases of the

49
00:01:56,320 --> 00:01:59,200
