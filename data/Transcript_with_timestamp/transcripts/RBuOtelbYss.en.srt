00:00:03,630 --> 00:00:08,420
[Music]

2
00:00:12,160 --> 00:00:17,039
ah thank you for coming

3
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:20,640
so yeah drought we're going to talk a

4
00:00:17,039 --> 00:00:20,640
lot about that um

5
00:00:20,720 --> 00:00:25,680
amongst other things so we're going to

6
00:00:22,720 --> 00:00:27,599
focus on financials primarily i've got a

7
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,960
couple of confessions to make and i will

8
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,200
make those in a minute but first a quiz

9
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:34,960
just so i can get to learn the audience

10
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,360
better so i'm assuming this is the strip

11
00:00:34,960 --> 00:00:39,040
hill conference you're all strip tillers

12
00:00:37,360 --> 00:00:42,000
right

13
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:42,000
any no-tillers

14
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,719
no tillers

15
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:47,840
all right

16
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:47,840
cover crop users

17
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:54,480
how many people have used cover crops

18
00:00:51,200 --> 00:00:54,480
tried them and quit

19
00:00:56,320 --> 00:01:01,120
how many are thinking about it

20
00:00:59,680 --> 00:01:02,640
so a few

21
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:05,680
be proud when you say we're thinking

22
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:07,600
about it so you are my audience today

23
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:09,600
so the people that are using cover crops

24
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:11,840
you think you've got a benefit you can

25
00:01:09,600 --> 00:01:13,200
see from the combine cab to the line

26
00:01:11,840 --> 00:01:16,799
where you plan to cover and where you

27
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:19,439
didn't have it i've got data for you

28
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:22,159
but really my audience both

29
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:24,320
my target audience both here and

30
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:27,119
in my other presentations is for people

31
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:29,200
that are thinking about cover cropping

32
00:01:27,119 --> 00:01:31,840
but they're worried about the economics

33
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:34,720
whether it's yield reduction or added

34
00:01:31,840 --> 00:01:37,439
expense of the cover crop or

35
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:39,759
implications related to we control

36
00:01:37,439 --> 00:01:42,159
that's really the heart of my research

37
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:44,000
and outreach program now and i'll talk

38
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,920
about that again but that's uh what

39
00:01:44,000 --> 00:01:47,040
we're going to talk about and so mostly

40
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:51,200
it's uh

41
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:51,200
it's financial in nature

42
00:01:51,439 --> 00:01:57,119
anyone hear from ser

43
00:01:54,880 --> 00:01:59,920
so let me put the plug in for sarah this

44
00:01:57,119 --> 00:02:02,640
is labeled as and i want to thank sarah

45
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:05,200
and lesson here for inviting me here

46
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:06,000
so this is really a sarah farmer forum

47
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:08,319
so

48
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:10,399
i'm on a speaker bureau a lot of my

49
00:02:08,319 --> 00:02:12,879
funding comes from sare

50
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:14,480
and so we speak at various conferences

51
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,920
around the country talking about this

52
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:17,599
air program

53
00:02:15,920 --> 00:02:21,840
and um

54
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:24,480
and uh the good work that they're doing

55
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:27,040
i am an independent research agronomist

56
00:02:24,480 --> 00:02:30,400
this is my third growing season as an

57
00:02:27,040 --> 00:02:32,720
independent my past affiliations are

58
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,760
two stents as a county-based extension

59
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:36,400
educator

60
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:39,200
in southeast wisconsin

61
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:42,000
and also two stents with michael fields

62
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,239
institute which is a non-profit

63
00:02:42,000 --> 00:02:46,959
that works in the area of sustainable

64
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:49,440
agriculture in east troy

65
00:02:46,959 --> 00:02:51,840
wisconsin southeast wisconsin

66
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:54,560
i was initially a research agronomist

67
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:55,440
there did a lot of work in cover crops

68
00:02:54,560 --> 00:02:57,280
and

69
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:58,800
more recently

70
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,080
and the position i left to become an

71
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:01,360
independent

72
00:03:00,080 --> 00:03:03,040
was the

73
00:03:01,360 --> 00:03:05,599
research director

74
00:03:03,040 --> 00:03:09,519
i currently in kind of a combined role

75
00:03:05,599 --> 00:03:12,159
professionally and also as a farmer i'm

76
00:03:09,519 --> 00:03:15,200
a member of my local producer-led

77
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:16,400
watershed protection group so really

78
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:18,080
there are several of these groups

79
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:20,319
there's like 40 of them in the state of

80
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:22,480
wisconsin and really it's a bunch of

81
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:25,280
like-minded farmers who are really

82
00:03:22,480 --> 00:03:27,519
interested in conservation and soil

83
00:03:25,280 --> 00:03:30,000
health and so this movement wisconsin

84
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:32,640
got started several years ago and it's a

85
00:03:30,000 --> 00:03:33,360
place where we get together informally

86
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:35,200
and

87
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:37,680
share information

88
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:40,239
and then i'm also just a fun fact a

89
00:03:37,680 --> 00:03:41,920
member of the soil health subcommittee

90
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:45,200
of the wisconsin

91
00:03:41,920 --> 00:03:47,040
nrcs technical committee so i work with

92
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:49,760
a lot of agency folks

93
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:51,760
on issues related to uh

94
00:03:49,760 --> 00:03:54,400
to soil health

95
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:56,959
so i've been at this a long time if you

96
00:03:54,400 --> 00:04:01,200
include graduate school i've been

97
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:02,400
working in a cover crop arena since 1989

98
00:04:01,200 --> 00:04:04,080
and i'll tell you

99
00:04:02,400 --> 00:04:07,040
with all

100
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:09,120
that experience i have more questions

101
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:11,439
than i do answers

102
00:04:09,120 --> 00:04:13,040
every time that we start researching a

103
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,760
topic and

104
00:04:13,040 --> 00:04:17,759
farmers come to us with issues or maybe

105
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:19,919
they're leading with technologies it

106
00:04:17,759 --> 00:04:22,800
always um

107
00:04:19,919 --> 00:04:25,600
raises more questions and so that keeps

108
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:27,840
keeps us employed as uh researchers and

109
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:31,919
it keeps things interesting

110
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:34,160
so my past research uh past work

111
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:35,440
when i started there was little known

112
00:04:34,160 --> 00:04:37,280
about cover cropping in the state of

113
00:04:35,440 --> 00:04:40,080
wisconsin so i did a lot of work on

114
00:04:37,280 --> 00:04:42,880
species screening what works here that

115
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:45,440
led us more into uh management and my

116
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:46,960
particular focus of interest is in

117
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:50,400
nitrogen management so i worked in

118
00:04:46,960 --> 00:04:52,160
nitrogen crediting and also in nutrient

119
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:54,240
management implications especially when

120
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:56,560
we started seeing a lot of

121
00:04:54,240 --> 00:04:59,280
winter i used on on

122
00:04:56,560 --> 00:05:01,360
dairy farms i have subsequently well let

123
00:04:59,280 --> 00:05:03,199
me back up so this information is all

124
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:04,960
out there if you're having trouble

125
00:05:03,199 --> 00:05:07,039
sleeping at night you can look at the

126
00:05:04,960 --> 00:05:09,919
research literature and you'll see that

127
00:05:07,039 --> 00:05:12,240
i've published there but my emphasis in

128
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:15,759
publication is in

129
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:17,199
formats that we'll get into farmer hands

130
00:05:15,759 --> 00:05:19,759
so um

131
00:05:17,199 --> 00:05:21,360
and again no one here from sare but i'd

132
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:23,759
like to plug this book here managing

133
00:05:21,360 --> 00:05:25,840
cover crops profitably this is a

134
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:28,080
national publication i worked on

135
00:05:25,840 --> 00:05:30,960
initially as a

136
00:05:28,080 --> 00:05:31,680
contributor but also contribute data to

137
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,680
it

138
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:35,360
under its uh revisions and it's

139
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,680
currently being revised so it's going

140
00:05:35,360 --> 00:05:39,280
into the fourth revision i've got

141
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:42,080
several university of wisconsin

142
00:05:39,280 --> 00:05:44,639
extension publications but most of my

143
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:46,720
work is incorporated in

144
00:05:44,639 --> 00:05:49,360
wisconsin university of wisconsin

145
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:50,560
extension fertility recommendations and

146
00:05:49,360 --> 00:05:53,120
that gets to

147
00:05:50,560 --> 00:05:57,120
phosphorus and potassium removal as well

148
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:59,440
as nitrogen credit for the cover crops

149
00:05:57,120 --> 00:06:01,520
my current topics like i said i am now

150
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:04,880
solely focused on

151
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:07,199
economics and this relates to

152
00:06:04,880 --> 00:06:11,120
wheat suppression but primarily to the

153
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:14,000
yield response of cover crops because

154
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:16,720
all of the social science

155
00:06:14,000 --> 00:06:18,800
data that's out there says that of cover

156
00:06:16,720 --> 00:06:21,360
crop non-users

157
00:06:18,800 --> 00:06:23,360
it's the finances that prevent people

158
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:25,280
from using them so

159
00:06:23,360 --> 00:06:27,759
that's why i'm working on

160
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,080
that arena now i'm in that arena now i'm

161
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:32,400
working on yield effects and the related

162
00:06:30,080 --> 00:06:34,720
economics and we're working on weed

163
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,880
suppression but then also on a

164
00:06:34,720 --> 00:06:40,160
conservation component so from all my

165
00:06:36,880 --> 00:06:42,479
on-farm research i collect conservation

166
00:06:40,160 --> 00:06:44,479
performance information

167
00:06:42,479 --> 00:06:46,400
that feeds into

168
00:06:44,479 --> 00:06:48,800
the software programmers and the

169
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:51,520
modelers for

170
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:53,280
the different models that estimate the

171
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:55,919
cover crops role

172
00:06:53,280 --> 00:06:58,400
in reduction of

173
00:06:55,919 --> 00:07:00,080
nutrient and

174
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,680
sediment loss

175
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:04,160
where does that build into

176
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:06,800
into the phosphorus trade so finance

177
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:09,199
ultimately it's financial so if you can

178
00:07:06,800 --> 00:07:10,560
cut or if you can trade for phosphorus

179
00:07:09,199 --> 00:07:12,960
because you've done the right thing and

180
00:07:10,560 --> 00:07:15,280
you've cut your phosphorus losses then

181
00:07:12,960 --> 00:07:17,599
that's financial so i'm very active in

182
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:19,039
that and i mentioned uh sierra support

183
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:21,280
i've gotten support

184
00:07:19,039 --> 00:07:24,160
throughout my career from various

185
00:07:21,280 --> 00:07:28,000
different programs

186
00:07:24,160 --> 00:07:30,720
because this is a sarah farmer focus or

187
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:32,800
forum i feel the need to talk a little

188
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:34,800
bit about my farm but this is also

189
00:07:32,800 --> 00:07:36,960
important because about 50 of the

190
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,919
research that i've done in the past has

191
00:07:36,960 --> 00:07:43,039
been done on my farm a lesser extent now

192
00:07:39,919 --> 00:07:45,599
because my on-farm research program

193
00:07:43,039 --> 00:07:49,440
has grown but i'm in walworth county in

194
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:52,560
southeast wisconsin 30 miles roughly

195
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:55,440
southeast of southwest of milwaukee i'll

196
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:58,720
show you my location on a map

197
00:07:55,440 --> 00:08:01,360
in a minute so i'm on the family farm

198
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:05,280
it's a typical dairy farm for southeast

199
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:06,319
wisconsin we skipped a generation so

200
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,479
when my

201
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:12,000
my grandparents retired from dairy

202
00:08:08,479 --> 00:08:14,160
farming the farm was rented out on a

203
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:18,080
cash lease basis

204
00:08:14,160 --> 00:08:20,160
30 years 25 30 years roughly of

205
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:22,560
going from a dairy rotation soil

206
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:25,520
conserving rotation to a corn soybean

207
00:08:22,560 --> 00:08:28,080
rotation with a lot of tillage

208
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:33,039
so when i started farming there in

209
00:08:28,080 --> 00:08:35,120
94 i inherited a soil health nightmare

210
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:37,279
and so for the past almost 30 years i've

211
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:40,479
been working to to build that up we'll

212
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:41,839
talk about that journey a little bit

213
00:08:40,479 --> 00:08:44,480
as we go

214
00:08:41,839 --> 00:08:47,120
so the soil type is very common to the

215
00:08:44,480 --> 00:08:49,279
area it's a lighter glacial soil it's a

216
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,839
fox silt loam on my farm i've got a

217
00:08:49,279 --> 00:08:53,920
slopes absolutely flat ground

218
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:57,200
but most of it's rolling four to six

219
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:59,519
percent slope um i've got some highly

220
00:08:57,200 --> 00:09:03,040
erodible land and this picture here

221
00:08:59,519 --> 00:09:06,160
shows you uh pretty much typical um

222
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:08,160
uh scene from my farm with a red clover

223
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:11,279
cover crop

224
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:14,000
the thing to know about my farm is that

225
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:18,399
i've got 18 inches to 24

226
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:20,640
inches of topsoil and subsoil and that's

227
00:09:18,399 --> 00:09:23,360
perched over gravel

228
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:25,360
so i don't have available

229
00:09:23,360 --> 00:09:28,080
moisture holding capacity my moisture

230
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:30,000
holding capacity is very limited so that

231
00:09:28,080 --> 00:09:30,959
definitely plays into everything i think

232
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:34,000
about

233
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:36,080
as far as farm management my cover crop

234
00:09:34,000 --> 00:09:37,600
history i started out with cover crops

235
00:09:36,080 --> 00:09:40,399
right off the bat

236
00:09:37,600 --> 00:09:43,519
three crop rotation corn soybeans wheat

237
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,800
i interceded red clover in the wheat

238
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:47,920
because i was interested in the nitrogen

239
00:09:46,800 --> 00:09:48,720
question

240
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,399
i

241
00:09:48,720 --> 00:09:53,600
for financial reasons quick growing

242
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:54,640
wheat in 2012 so i switched to corn and

243
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:57,279
beans

244
00:09:54,640 --> 00:10:00,720
and i set out for of the cover crop

245
00:09:57,279 --> 00:10:03,200
world for a couple years but back into

246
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:06,320
rye planted into corn stalks before

247
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,399
soybeans to me that is the no-brainer

248
00:10:06,320 --> 00:10:10,640
there's no yield penalty in the

249
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:13,040
in the soybeans and let's be frank we're

250
00:10:10,640 --> 00:10:14,880
going to talk about dryness you have dry

251
00:10:13,040 --> 00:10:16,720
years you're not taking up all the

252
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:18,959
applied nitrogen you want to keep it on

253
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:21,040
your farm and in a form it'll become

254
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,720
available to subsequent crops instead of

255
00:10:21,040 --> 00:10:24,640
losing it to uh

256
00:10:22,720 --> 00:10:27,600
to leaching

257
00:10:24,640 --> 00:10:29,200
2002 the current growing season based on

258
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:30,320
some data i'm going to show you next

259
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,880
slide

260
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:36,079
i planted the entire farm except for

261
00:10:32,880 --> 00:10:38,959
areas i'm saving for research trials

262
00:10:36,079 --> 00:10:40,480
into winter rye and that's specifically

263
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,240
to deal with

264
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,839
the crazy weather that we're

265
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:47,920
experiencing experiencing

266
00:10:44,839 --> 00:10:49,920
recently uh my tillage

267
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,880
journey i started out conventional

268
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:55,760
farmer tilt hilltill i phased in no-till

269
00:10:52,880 --> 00:10:58,000
i've been on 100 no-till since 2003 so

270
00:10:55,760 --> 00:11:01,120
this is the 20th growing season

271
00:10:58,000 --> 00:11:03,680
as a no-till farmer i forgot to tell you

272
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:05,600
give you my confession

273
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:07,360
i have strip tilled

274
00:11:05,600 --> 00:11:09,760
20 acres that doesn't make me a

275
00:11:07,360 --> 00:11:12,399
strip-till farmer uh all the data i'm

276
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:15,360
going to show you is coming from

277
00:11:12,399 --> 00:11:17,200
from no-till i will tell you i've got a

278
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:18,959
couple in my big project i've got a

279
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:19,920
couple of strip tillers in there and

280
00:11:18,959 --> 00:11:22,560
i'll talk about how they're

281
00:11:19,920 --> 00:11:24,959
incorporating uh cover crops into their

282
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:27,360
strip till system but all the data that

283
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:29,839
i'm showing you is

284
00:11:27,360 --> 00:11:31,120
is from no-till the other confession is

285
00:11:29,839 --> 00:11:32,880
that um

286
00:11:31,120 --> 00:11:35,839
because this is air farmer forum they

287
00:11:32,880 --> 00:11:37,600
want us to talk about current projects

288
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
so i've got one completed project i'm

289
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,360
going to talk about with actual data the

290
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:43,760
other two are

291
00:11:41,360 --> 00:11:46,480
projects that are in process so i can

292
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:49,680
show you what we've got so far but no

293
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,680
firm recommendations

294
00:11:50,720 --> 00:11:55,279
all right my motivation for cover crops

295
00:11:52,640 --> 00:11:58,320
on my farm right now it's strictly

296
00:11:55,279 --> 00:12:01,200
tactical and it's adapted management how

297
00:11:58,320 --> 00:12:02,720
do we deal with extremes and

298
00:12:01,200 --> 00:12:04,959
precipitation

299
00:12:02,720 --> 00:12:07,680
so the graph there is the growing season

300
00:12:04,959 --> 00:12:11,040
of precipitation almost 30 years of data

301
00:12:07,680 --> 00:12:13,440
from my farm on the top it's the season

302
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:16,720
total for the growing season so that's

303
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:18,240
april 1st through october 31st

304
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:21,200
and then on the bottom it's the three

305
00:12:18,240 --> 00:12:23,680
tenderloin months of the growing season

306
00:12:21,200 --> 00:12:25,839
june july and august

307
00:12:23,680 --> 00:12:28,000
so these graphs show a couple of things

308
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:30,000
so here's the mean

309
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:33,920
so the average that's the black line

310
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:36,800
there and then the annual variation

311
00:12:33,920 --> 00:12:40,160
the mean the average do we do we farm

312
00:12:36,800 --> 00:12:42,399
for average do we strive for average

313
00:12:40,160 --> 00:12:44,880
from a risk management standpoint maybe

314
00:12:42,399 --> 00:12:46,160
but no we want to be above average

315
00:12:44,880 --> 00:12:48,320
here's the other thing i'll say about

316
00:12:46,160 --> 00:12:50,959
average and you've all heard this a

317
00:12:48,320 --> 00:12:53,760
statistician can drown in an average

318
00:12:50,959 --> 00:12:55,760
water depth of three inches right

319
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:57,839
it's not the average we're interested in

320
00:12:55,760 --> 00:12:59,600
we're interested in the spread so the

321
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:01,200
high and the low and it's going to come

322
00:12:59,600 --> 00:13:03,200
up in all my data

323
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:04,800
discussion

324
00:13:03,200 --> 00:13:07,760
let's look at the last four years and

325
00:13:04,800 --> 00:13:11,360
this is what's really driving me

326
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:12,959
the wettest and the second wettest year

327
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:15,600
on my farm

328
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:17,200
as well as the driest year so this is

329
00:13:15,600 --> 00:13:20,800
the benchmark year you all think about

330
00:13:17,200 --> 00:13:24,079
the dry year the drought of 2012 right

331
00:13:20,800 --> 00:13:26,800
to me that was um the benchmark

332
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:30,480
2021 almost two inches less

333
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:33,120
precipitation than we had in uh in the

334
00:13:30,480 --> 00:13:36,000
drought here here's the other thing uh

335
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:38,160
20 20 right here we ended up a little

336
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:40,639
bit below average the actual

337
00:13:38,160 --> 00:13:43,200
precipitation in that year

338
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:45,040
happened in garbage time when the crop

339
00:13:43,200 --> 00:13:47,360
couldn't use it anymore

340
00:13:45,040 --> 00:13:49,360
so a football analogy would be okay so

341
00:13:47,360 --> 00:13:51,279
we got rainfall in the fourth quarter

342
00:13:49,360 --> 00:13:54,880
the football analogy is okay we're down

343
00:13:51,279 --> 00:13:57,600
56 to nothing we score 14 points against

344
00:13:54,880 --> 00:13:59,360
the third string defense who cares

345
00:13:57,600 --> 00:14:01,680
statistically it shows that hey maybe

346
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:02,800
that year wasn't bad but i would argue

347
00:14:01,680 --> 00:14:04,880
from a

348
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:09,279
moisture standpoint it was just as bad

349
00:14:04,880 --> 00:14:11,199
as last year's uh drought which was

350
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:13,279
an official drought here's the other

351
00:14:11,199 --> 00:14:14,480
thing let's look at the tenderloin

352
00:14:13,279 --> 00:14:17,040
months

353
00:14:14,480 --> 00:14:19,199
june july and august so these are the

354
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:21,040
monthly totals and you can see we got

355
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:23,680
some variation of the data and you would

356
00:14:21,040 --> 00:14:24,959
expect that you get a wet june you get a

357
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:26,279
dry june

358
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:29,760
look at this

359
00:14:26,279 --> 00:14:31,199
2007 it's like you flipped a switch

360
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,680
suddenly

361
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:35,519
the amplitude the variability has

362
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:37,040
increased it's almost doubled and we've

363
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
got months where we're getting 10 inches

364
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:39,920
of rain

365
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:42,000
followed by months where we're getting

366
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:44,959
almost nothing

367
00:14:42,000 --> 00:14:46,639
embedded in this data is three hundred

368
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:49,040
year storms

369
00:14:46,639 --> 00:14:51,680
what's a hundred year storm a storm of

370
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:54,320
sufficient intensity and rainfall amount

371
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:56,560
that it only happens once every hundred

372
00:14:54,320 --> 00:14:58,639
years that's the probability

373
00:14:56,560 --> 00:15:01,279
i've got three of them in a span of 15

374
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:02,720
years that really influences

375
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:05,519
crop production

376
00:15:02,720 --> 00:15:07,839
and also as i think about my crops how

377
00:15:05,519 --> 00:15:10,480
i'm gonna manage them that's why

378
00:15:07,839 --> 00:15:13,360
everything on my farm this year going

379
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:16,000
into the growing season was planted with

380
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:19,040
a cover crop to help me manage

381
00:15:16,000 --> 00:15:20,480
this variability and the moisture

382
00:15:19,040 --> 00:15:22,880
so we use what we call adaptive

383
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:26,720
management with the cover crops if it's

384
00:15:22,880 --> 00:15:29,160
dry what do you do you terminate early

385
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:33,360
so this picture is from

386
00:15:29,160 --> 00:15:36,000
2011 or 2021 last year a declared

387
00:15:33,360 --> 00:15:38,560
drought in our area this comes from a

388
00:15:36,000 --> 00:15:41,040
cooperating farmer of mine

389
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:42,320
who's also a crop consultant his name is

390
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,320
tom novak

391
00:15:42,320 --> 00:15:46,240
so this is part of a long-term trial

392
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:48,000
that he's had on his farm to prove the

393
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:50,000
value of the

394
00:15:48,000 --> 00:15:51,920
of the cover crops to his clients and

395
00:15:50,000 --> 00:15:54,399
it's a real simple trial with and

396
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:56,720
without cover he collects the

397
00:15:54,399 --> 00:15:58,399
yield data and he shares it with his

398
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,720
clients

399
00:15:58,399 --> 00:16:04,399
if it's a wet year we terminate later we

400
00:16:00,720 --> 00:16:07,519
let that cover crop use the moisture

401
00:16:04,399 --> 00:16:09,519
dry the soil out this is my farm this

402
00:16:07,519 --> 00:16:10,880
year

403
00:16:09,519 --> 00:16:13,040
and it worked

404
00:16:10,880 --> 00:16:16,320
it worked all around me i live in

405
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:18,240
no-till nor nirvana everyone around me

406
00:16:16,320 --> 00:16:20,720
no-tills but i'm the one that uses the

407
00:16:18,240 --> 00:16:24,240
cover crops i let it go i was in the

408
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:27,279
field planting a full two days sooner

409
00:16:24,240 --> 00:16:28,959
than my neighbors which is important

410
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:30,000
when you have five inches of rain in

411
00:16:28,959 --> 00:16:31,839
april

412
00:16:30,000 --> 00:16:33,360
and you haven't gotten anything done in

413
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:35,199
the field everything's all compressed

414
00:16:33,360 --> 00:16:36,720
the sooner you get out there the better

415
00:16:35,199 --> 00:16:38,240
off you are

416
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:41,360
remember this picture we're going to

417
00:16:38,240 --> 00:16:42,880
circle back and look at it um

418
00:16:41,360 --> 00:16:44,800
in just a minute

419
00:16:42,880 --> 00:16:47,680
so you got to have the rye

420
00:16:44,800 --> 00:16:49,759
in place to do adaptive management even

421
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:51,199
if you terminate early there is a

422
00:16:49,759 --> 00:16:52,560
benefit to it and i want to show you

423
00:16:51,199 --> 00:16:54,959
data that shows that there's weed

424
00:16:52,560 --> 00:16:57,120
suppression but also there's a yield

425
00:16:54,959 --> 00:17:00,079
benefit even from something that has

426
00:16:57,120 --> 00:17:02,959
such little amount of biomass

427
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:05,600
here's tom's data core yield

428
00:17:02,959 --> 00:17:07,439
no rye and rye averaged across two

429
00:17:05,600 --> 00:17:09,760
different trials which are basically

430
00:17:07,439 --> 00:17:14,079
nitrogen rate trials a four and a half

431
00:17:09,760 --> 00:17:16,880
bushel yield advantage to the cover crop

432
00:17:14,079 --> 00:17:20,559
he also saw some yield suppression he

433
00:17:16,880 --> 00:17:23,120
also had or not yield suppression um

434
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:27,280
weed suppression he also has the same

435
00:17:23,120 --> 00:17:29,760
thing in soybeans and his soybean yield

436
00:17:27,280 --> 00:17:33,360
he had a bump of four

437
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:35,760
4.3 percent so

438
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:37,919
he got a yield advantage but had it

439
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:40,640
turned out wet he could have

440
00:17:37,919 --> 00:17:42,640
terminated later and uh used it to

441
00:17:40,640 --> 00:17:44,480
manage soil moisture

442
00:17:42,640 --> 00:17:45,840
we also and he's a cooperator on this

443
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:48,320
trial i'm going to talk about this this

444
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:50,320
is one of my weed management trials so

445
00:17:48,320 --> 00:17:52,160
we had three different treatments

446
00:17:50,320 --> 00:17:55,039
at three different locations

447
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:58,640
in southeast wisconsin where we had a

448
00:17:55,039 --> 00:18:01,039
control no rye we had rye terminated

449
00:17:58,640 --> 00:18:04,000
let's call it burn down and where we

450
00:18:01,039 --> 00:18:05,200
planted green and terminated later in

451
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:08,000
the season

452
00:18:05,200 --> 00:18:09,600
in the case of the no rye versus rye

453
00:18:08,000 --> 00:18:11,520
very little yield difference and the

454
00:18:09,600 --> 00:18:13,440
thing that's really intriguing to me we

455
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:15,280
talked about the spread and the data not

456
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:18,320
the mean statistically the means are the

457
00:18:15,280 --> 00:18:21,120
same in fact we got a slight yield bump

458
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:22,240
but look at the spread and the data with

459
00:18:21,120 --> 00:18:24,480
the rye

460
00:18:22,240 --> 00:18:26,960
it was a lot tighter and again this is

461
00:18:24,480 --> 00:18:28,400
averaged over three locations

462
00:18:26,960 --> 00:18:29,919
three different farms

463
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:32,320
compared to

464
00:18:29,919 --> 00:18:34,400
the uh the no rye

465
00:18:32,320 --> 00:18:36,880
so that's telling us there's something

466
00:18:34,400 --> 00:18:39,520
there with the rye

467
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:43,200
that's either enhancing

468
00:18:39,520 --> 00:18:45,440
weed suppression or yield let's go back

469
00:18:43,200 --> 00:18:48,320
to the uh the original drought and this

470
00:18:45,440 --> 00:18:51,360
is where i became convinced that cover

471
00:18:48,320 --> 00:18:54,960
crops have great value

472
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:57,600
to deal with drought so up until this um

473
00:18:54,960 --> 00:19:00,559
this past year 2012 was by far the

474
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:02,720
driest year that we had had on my farm

475
00:19:00,559 --> 00:19:05,919
at the time i had a uh i was in the

476
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:08,559
fourth year of a nitrogen response trial

477
00:19:05,919 --> 00:19:09,840
looking at the nitrogen response of corn

478
00:19:08,559 --> 00:19:12,000
to

479
00:19:09,840 --> 00:19:14,160
supplemental nitrogen after a red clover

480
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:16,160
cover crop and this is what the system

481
00:19:14,160 --> 00:19:19,120
looked like so this is going into the

482
00:19:16,160 --> 00:19:22,559
season this is that time of planting and

483
00:19:19,120 --> 00:19:26,000
then this is an in season

484
00:19:22,559 --> 00:19:28,960
what i had was basically a mat that

485
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:30,799
helped with infiltration but also a cut

486
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:34,720
evaporation losses

487
00:19:30,799 --> 00:19:35,600
so it helped me capture water and store

488
00:19:34,720 --> 00:19:37,360
it

489
00:19:35,600 --> 00:19:40,240
this is what the crop looked like in

490
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:43,200
season i unfortunately did not have a no

491
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:45,360
cover control in this trial

492
00:19:43,200 --> 00:19:46,880
but i had data to compare it to and that

493
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:49,760
was the pre

494
00:19:46,880 --> 00:19:51,919
pre the three previous years which turns

495
00:19:49,760 --> 00:19:55,679
out in southeast wisconsin were really

496
00:19:51,919 --> 00:19:58,080
good cropping years so at harvest time i

497
00:19:55,679 --> 00:19:59,280
looked back at the yield

498
00:19:58,080 --> 00:20:01,280
from the pre

499
00:19:59,280 --> 00:20:04,240
three previous years and guess what

500
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:06,559
eighty percent of

501
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:08,400
what i had in good years so that was

502
00:20:06,559 --> 00:20:11,039
kind of compelling but i thought well

503
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:13,919
let's look at the rest of the county so

504
00:20:11,039 --> 00:20:16,240
i took nas data from walworth county

505
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:17,760
this is all the corneal data

506
00:20:16,240 --> 00:20:20,559
non-irrigated

507
00:20:17,760 --> 00:20:21,760
but it includes all practices so based

508
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,280
on my knowledge of the neighborhood i'll

509
00:20:21,760 --> 00:20:24,960
tell you this is all conventionally

510
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:27,200
tilled there's a little bit of no-till

511
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,360
in there a little bit of cover crops

512
00:20:27,200 --> 00:20:32,720
mostly this is conventional

513
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:35,200
they're yield in 2012 compared to

514
00:20:32,720 --> 00:20:36,880
the three previous really good years

515
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,120
62

516
00:20:36,880 --> 00:20:42,240
so i'm like 20 percent better with my

517
00:20:39,120 --> 00:20:46,559
cover crop and i attribute that all to

518
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:48,640
managing the moisture that i got

519
00:20:46,559 --> 00:20:51,360
all right my motivation right now is

520
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:53,760
tactical but my primary reasons and the

521
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:55,919
reasons that i grow cover crops

522
00:20:53,760 --> 00:20:58,880
uh they remain basically the same i'm

523
00:20:55,919 --> 00:21:02,159
looking for the ecosystem uh services

524
00:20:58,880 --> 00:21:04,720
both general but some very specific ones

525
00:21:02,159 --> 00:21:06,480
soil health that's a gimme i drunk the

526
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:08,880
soil health kool-aid long ago i don't

527
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:11,280
worry about testing for it i know it's

528
00:21:08,880 --> 00:21:12,960
there how do i know i have soil health i

529
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:16,480
can see the earthworm castings on the

530
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:19,200
soil surface i know i can close my slots

531
00:21:16,480 --> 00:21:21,520
i know my soil breaks apart freely i

532
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:24,320
know i don't have ponding that i get

533
00:21:21,520 --> 00:21:25,760
really good infiltration and i know that

534
00:21:24,320 --> 00:21:28,720
leads me to

535
00:21:25,760 --> 00:21:31,120
yield enhancement i'm also interested

536
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:34,799
because of my soil nature and increased

537
00:21:31,120 --> 00:21:38,000
surface residue both for infiltration

538
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:41,440
but also to cut evaporation early in the

539
00:21:38,000 --> 00:21:44,000
season i'm also interested in in season

540
00:21:41,440 --> 00:21:46,960
biomass production four weeds

541
00:21:44,000 --> 00:21:49,679
suppression so i can cut

542
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:51,440
herbicide application not rates but

543
00:21:49,679 --> 00:21:54,159
number of applications and i'll show you

544
00:21:51,440 --> 00:21:56,799
some data um what happened this year in

545
00:21:54,159 --> 00:21:58,400
a little bit and i'm also interested in

546
00:21:56,799 --> 00:22:00,400
nutrient retention

547
00:21:58,400 --> 00:22:01,600
not only

548
00:22:00,400 --> 00:22:05,360
nitrogen

549
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:07,440
but also increasingly in phosphorus so

550
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:09,280
in wisconsin there's a group that's

551
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:11,520
affiliated with the university it's

552
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:14,320
called discovery farms and they've done

553
00:22:11,520 --> 00:22:17,280
a lot of on-farm monitoring of runoff

554
00:22:14,320 --> 00:22:20,000
from different farming scenarios

555
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:22,799
what they're monitoring shows is that in

556
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:24,960
no-till we're not losing sediment but

557
00:22:22,799 --> 00:22:28,240
our achilles heel as far as surface

558
00:22:24,960 --> 00:22:30,799
water quality is concerned is soluble

559
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:32,960
phosphorus so now i'm thinking about

560
00:22:30,799 --> 00:22:35,919
ways i can use cover crops to cut the

561
00:22:32,960 --> 00:22:38,960
soluble phosphorus on my home farm

562
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:42,080
it's not really a big deal because i

563
00:22:38,960 --> 00:22:45,840
number one drain internally about 70

564
00:22:42,080 --> 00:22:48,559
percent of my farm drains internally

565
00:22:45,840 --> 00:22:50,799
the runoff water that leaves the farm

566
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:53,039
goes to the marsh and it has to travel

567
00:22:50,799 --> 00:22:54,159
through several thousand feet of marsh

568
00:22:53,039 --> 00:22:55,760
which is going to capture that

569
00:22:54,159 --> 00:22:58,159
phosphorus before it gets to the rain

570
00:22:55,760 --> 00:23:00,799
channel to the the main channel

571
00:22:58,159 --> 00:23:04,000
my problem is on rental ground and

572
00:23:00,799 --> 00:23:06,320
that's this picture right here

573
00:23:04,000 --> 00:23:08,320
so i've got one field it's a small field

574
00:23:06,320 --> 00:23:09,919
but i like it because it's relatively

575
00:23:08,320 --> 00:23:11,039
uniform and i do a lot of research on

576
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,880
this field

577
00:23:11,039 --> 00:23:14,799
it's got a swale that runs right through

578
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:17,840
the middle it runs to the edge of the

579
00:23:14,799 --> 00:23:20,159
field it crosses six inches of mold lawn

580
00:23:17,840 --> 00:23:22,000
and then right into a gully which

581
00:23:20,159 --> 00:23:25,039
plunges over the course of only a couple

582
00:23:22,000 --> 00:23:27,360
hundred feet 60 feet down into the marsh

583
00:23:25,039 --> 00:23:29,760
it goes through like 50 feet of marsh

584
00:23:27,360 --> 00:23:33,039
goes into a pond that has a channel that

585
00:23:29,760 --> 00:23:36,000
gets it into the main channel which

586
00:23:33,039 --> 00:23:37,840
means it gets into the mukwonago river

587
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:39,919
why am i so concerned about the

588
00:23:37,840 --> 00:23:41,280
mukwonago river

589
00:23:39,919 --> 00:23:44,720
it has

590
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:47,120
a designation by wisconsin dnr as an

591
00:23:44,720 --> 00:23:48,880
exceptional to outstanding water

592
00:23:47,120 --> 00:23:51,120
resource not only because of water

593
00:23:48,880 --> 00:23:54,000
quality but also because it's home to

594
00:23:51,120 --> 00:23:56,720
several endangered species so the dnr

595
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:58,720
has a lot of interest in it a lot of the

596
00:23:56,720 --> 00:24:01,440
conservation groups have huge interest

597
00:23:58,720 --> 00:24:04,080
in my watershed which means as a farmer

598
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:05,840
i am under the microscope as far as what

599
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:08,960
happens on my farm and what could

600
00:24:05,840 --> 00:24:10,320
potentially end up in the uh

601
00:24:08,960 --> 00:24:12,400
in the river

602
00:24:10,320 --> 00:24:14,320
the other thing to say like all of you

603
00:24:12,400 --> 00:24:16,880
my overarching reason for using

604
00:24:14,320 --> 00:24:19,279
conservation is for the next generation

605
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:20,480
so i can pass the farm on to the next

606
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:24,480
generation

607
00:24:20,480 --> 00:24:25,720
in better shape than i found it

608
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:29,120
all right

609
00:24:25,720 --> 00:24:30,960
economics my primary justification i

610
00:24:29,120 --> 00:24:32,880
mean i talk to farmers all the time so i

611
00:24:30,960 --> 00:24:35,760
know economics are the

612
00:24:32,880 --> 00:24:37,919
the bottom line of the decision not to

613
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:40,000
implement cover cropping

614
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:43,679
my justification for

615
00:24:40,000 --> 00:24:44,720
grant purposes is this so the folks at

616
00:24:43,679 --> 00:24:46,400
sayre

617
00:24:44,720 --> 00:24:48,559
along with the conservation

618
00:24:46,400 --> 00:24:50,640
tillage information center have

619
00:24:48,559 --> 00:24:54,320
conducted a periodic

620
00:24:50,640 --> 00:24:57,279
survey for the last 10 years to look at

621
00:24:54,320 --> 00:24:59,360
farmers use of cover crops or non-use

622
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:02,799
they want to look at the motivation but

623
00:24:59,360 --> 00:25:04,799
primarily what are the barriers

624
00:25:02,799 --> 00:25:06,880
and so every two years they publish the

625
00:25:04,799 --> 00:25:10,240
survey it's the same results of the

626
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:11,600
non-survey of the non-users every time

627
00:25:10,240 --> 00:25:14,720
there is no

628
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:18,559
demonstrated economic benefit

629
00:25:14,720 --> 00:25:21,440
to me i interpret that as we don't have

630
00:25:18,559 --> 00:25:24,080
good data we don't have numbers from

631
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:26,559
acceptable side by side comparison

632
00:25:24,080 --> 00:25:28,559
there's a lot of anecdotal evidence out

633
00:25:26,559 --> 00:25:30,799
there there's a lot of testimonial

634
00:25:28,559 --> 00:25:33,679
farmer jim will say yeah i got a five

635
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:36,960
percent yield response to it people want

636
00:25:33,679 --> 00:25:38,960
to see the data so that's why i am data

637
00:25:36,960 --> 00:25:41,200
driven they are

638
00:25:38,960 --> 00:25:44,400
in my research program

639
00:25:41,200 --> 00:25:46,080
fear of yield reduction added cost and

640
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:49,039
time commitment

641
00:25:46,080 --> 00:25:51,200
complicates management especially weeds

642
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:53,279
and increased risk

643
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:55,600
all those are valid concerns and reasons

644
00:25:53,279 --> 00:25:59,440
not to do it what's really interesting

645
00:25:55,600 --> 00:26:02,320
in this survey is among the cover crop

646
00:25:59,440 --> 00:26:05,279
users they say the exact opposite hey

647
00:26:02,320 --> 00:26:07,520
we're seeing a yield increase corn uh

648
00:26:05,279 --> 00:26:10,720
especially in a drought year corn up to

649
00:26:07,520 --> 00:26:12,640
almost 10 soybean up almost at 12

650
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:14,480
those higher numbers those all came from

651
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:17,279
the first year of the survey the drought

652
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:19,520
response here of 2012.

653
00:26:17,279 --> 00:26:21,679
the users say we get improved we control

654
00:26:19,520 --> 00:26:22,880
we can cut our input costs including

655
00:26:21,679 --> 00:26:25,279
herbicide

656
00:26:22,880 --> 00:26:27,840
planting green boy this is the greatest

657
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:30,159
thing it allows earlier planting in wet

658
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:31,840
years like on my farm this past year

659
00:26:30,159 --> 00:26:33,679
like i talked about

660
00:26:31,840 --> 00:26:36,159
and it may prevent us from having

661
00:26:33,679 --> 00:26:39,520
prevented plant acres because it dries

662
00:26:36,159 --> 00:26:41,919
it out enough that we can plant

663
00:26:39,520 --> 00:26:43,039
so that's the data and then just to add

664
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:45,679
a little bit of

665
00:26:43,039 --> 00:26:47,440
richness to the data this little sidebar

666
00:26:45,679 --> 00:26:50,080
here i looked at evaluations from a

667
00:26:47,440 --> 00:26:52,559
winter workshop my uh producer group put

668
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:54,240
on this winner and got actual comments

669
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:56,159
from farmers who would listen to gabe

670
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:58,240
brown talk for six hours

671
00:26:56,159 --> 00:26:59,679
about regenerative practices and here's

672
00:26:58,240 --> 00:27:01,919
what they had to say you know the

673
00:26:59,679 --> 00:27:04,080
practices are great but how do i

674
00:27:01,919 --> 00:27:06,320
actually implement these practices and

675
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:08,240
remain profitability

676
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:11,520
remain profitable so there it is

677
00:27:08,240 --> 00:27:15,200
profitability the next one how do i

678
00:27:11,520 --> 00:27:17,919
implement regenerative practices

679
00:27:15,200 --> 00:27:20,640
without losing money initially to me

680
00:27:17,919 --> 00:27:22,159
that gets at the fact that people have a

681
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:24,000
perception that maybe there's a

682
00:27:22,159 --> 00:27:27,279
transition period

683
00:27:24,000 --> 00:27:29,440
which ties into the third one

684
00:27:27,279 --> 00:27:30,799
what about rental ground so most ground

685
00:27:29,440 --> 00:27:33,679
at least in the state of wisconsin at

686
00:27:30,799 --> 00:27:35,840
least on three-year leases so if there's

687
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:37,279
a perception there's a transition period

688
00:27:35,840 --> 00:27:39,919
and you're going to have a yield loss

689
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:42,000
initially why would you do it also why

690
00:27:39,919 --> 00:27:43,840
would you want to improve

691
00:27:42,000 --> 00:27:45,600
the soil on rental ground when you know

692
00:27:43,840 --> 00:27:47,760
you could be albin you could lose the

693
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:49,840
lease so one of the things i'm keenly

694
00:27:47,760 --> 00:27:52,240
interested in is first year effects

695
00:27:49,840 --> 00:27:54,559
showing we can have a yield impact

696
00:27:52,240 --> 00:27:56,240
the first year

697
00:27:54,559 --> 00:27:58,080
all right so let's put a number on it so

698
00:27:56,240 --> 00:27:59,039
these are the three sarah projects that

699
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:01,679
i have

700
00:27:59,039 --> 00:28:04,320
that are related to economics the first

701
00:28:01,679 --> 00:28:08,000
one do cover crops pay this one is

702
00:28:04,320 --> 00:28:10,320
complete but this is the rationale

703
00:28:08,000 --> 00:28:13,840
for the second one the second and the

704
00:28:10,320 --> 00:28:17,039
third one can cover crops pay and

705
00:28:13,840 --> 00:28:19,760
do ken planting green suppress our

706
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:22,320
troublesome glyphosate tolerant or

707
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:24,720
resistant weeds and no-till soybean as i

708
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:26,559
said this is a work in progress

709
00:28:24,720 --> 00:28:28,320
i will show you completed data i will

710
00:28:26,559 --> 00:28:30,880
show you the data that we've gotten from

711
00:28:28,320 --> 00:28:34,799
the trial so far but

712
00:28:30,880 --> 00:28:37,039
no recommendations it is what it is

713
00:28:34,799 --> 00:28:39,919
you can look for updates at the sare

714
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:42,159
site and lesser tears gonna publish it i

715
00:28:39,919 --> 00:28:45,440
put down no-till farmer i didn't know

716
00:28:42,159 --> 00:28:48,080
about strip till farmer or cover crop

717
00:28:45,440 --> 00:28:50,559
what's the other one cover crop

718
00:28:48,080 --> 00:28:52,640
your third publication cover crop

719
00:28:50,559 --> 00:28:55,360
cover crop strategies it'll be in there

720
00:28:52,640 --> 00:28:55,360
somewhere right

721
00:28:56,320 --> 00:29:00,799
all right

722
00:28:57,440 --> 00:29:03,840
do cover crops pay this was a really fun

723
00:29:00,799 --> 00:29:06,240
project so the um this was funded by the

724
00:29:03,840 --> 00:29:07,279
producer grant program our partnership

725
00:29:06,240 --> 00:29:10,480
program

726
00:29:07,279 --> 00:29:12,399
it's a two-year funding cycle i was able

727
00:29:10,480 --> 00:29:15,039
to get federal funding from another

728
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:16,880
source so i stretched it into

729
00:29:15,039 --> 00:29:19,200
into three

730
00:29:16,880 --> 00:29:21,440
years again conducted in southeast

731
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:24,159
wisconsin three different counties it's

732
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:27,120
a replicated strip till trial it's got a

733
00:29:24,159 --> 00:29:29,279
formal experimental design and a real

734
00:29:27,120 --> 00:29:30,559
simple treatment design

735
00:29:29,279 --> 00:29:32,080
with cover

736
00:29:30,559 --> 00:29:34,320
without cover

737
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:37,279
here's the fun thing about it i had a

738
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:39,360
protocol as far as me collecting data

739
00:29:37,279 --> 00:29:41,760
and how i was going to do it

740
00:29:39,360 --> 00:29:43,840
as far as the cover crop management

741
00:29:41,760 --> 00:29:46,080
that was up to the farmers and there's a

742
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:51,279
lot of wisdom in doing that because

743
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:53,919
farmers know how to manage cover crops

744
00:29:51,279 --> 00:29:56,640
we'll talk about the universities later

745
00:29:53,919 --> 00:29:58,640
later on in the session anyway they know

746
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,720
what they're doing let them do it here's

747
00:29:58,640 --> 00:30:02,799
the ball google play kids

748
00:30:00,720 --> 00:30:05,039
we're going to collect some data we did

749
00:30:02,799 --> 00:30:08,240
a financial analysis we use partial

750
00:30:05,039 --> 00:30:10,640
budget analysis so we're just looking at

751
00:30:08,240 --> 00:30:12,240
additional costs and returns there's no

752
00:30:10,640 --> 00:30:13,360
assumptions in it it's just the two

753
00:30:12,240 --> 00:30:16,399
practices

754
00:30:13,360 --> 00:30:19,360
side by side and i use the co-operators

755
00:30:16,399 --> 00:30:21,919
input costs as well as their

756
00:30:19,360 --> 00:30:24,240
output prices the differences between

757
00:30:21,919 --> 00:30:26,399
the systems are primarily in the cover

758
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:29,919
crop costs so there's additional costs

759
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:32,480
of the seed the establishment management

760
00:30:29,919 --> 00:30:34,960
if necessary like clipping

761
00:30:32,480 --> 00:30:36,640
and then termination costs one thing

762
00:30:34,960 --> 00:30:38,720
that's kind of unique to this research

763
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:41,440
and this economic research was we also

764
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,279
looked at interest charges so you think

765
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:45,919
about it most the cover

766
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:47,840
trials use winter rye you plant rye in

767
00:30:45,919 --> 00:30:50,000
november of one year you don't have

768
00:30:47,840 --> 00:30:51,279
access to the grain income till november

769
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:54,240
of the next year

770
00:30:51,279 --> 00:30:56,080
you've got one year of carry on that

771
00:30:54,240 --> 00:30:57,440
money so it's important

772
00:30:56,080 --> 00:30:59,200
to carry that

773
00:30:57,440 --> 00:31:02,640
we also looked at

774
00:30:59,200 --> 00:31:04,640
the yield increase and the cost of that

775
00:31:02,640 --> 00:31:07,279
if you have a yield bump that's free

776
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:07,279
money right

777
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:11,679
the answer is no

778
00:31:09,679 --> 00:31:14,000
you still got to haul it you got to dry

779
00:31:11,679 --> 00:31:17,360
it you got to shrink it and you have to

780
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:19,360
account for p and k removal so we did

781
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,159
all of that to come up with our break

782
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:21,840
even

783
00:31:20,159 --> 00:31:23,279
numbers and

784
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:24,559
some other things which are on this

785
00:31:23,279 --> 00:31:26,399
slide

786
00:31:24,559 --> 00:31:30,080
so at the end of the day we ended up

787
00:31:26,399 --> 00:31:33,039
with 14 sight years of data so that's

788
00:31:30,080 --> 00:31:34,240
like having 14 little farms scattered

789
00:31:33,039 --> 00:31:36,240
across

790
00:31:34,240 --> 00:31:39,200
three different growing seasons

791
00:31:36,240 --> 00:31:40,799
we saw positive yield response 75

792
00:31:39,200 --> 00:31:42,640
percent of the time

793
00:31:40,799 --> 00:31:44,880
and that's important because it matches

794
00:31:42,640 --> 00:31:47,919
what tom novak has been doing in that

795
00:31:44,880 --> 00:31:49,360
trial i showed a couple slides ago

796
00:31:47,919 --> 00:31:52,159
that he's been conducting for the last

797
00:31:49,360 --> 00:31:54,960
10 years he in corn and beans are seeing

798
00:31:52,159 --> 00:31:57,279
a positive yield response about 75

799
00:31:54,960 --> 00:32:00,320
percent of the time

800
00:31:57,279 --> 00:32:02,399
so here's the raw data this is the corn

801
00:32:00,320 --> 00:32:03,919
and this is the soybean

802
00:32:02,399 --> 00:32:07,360
on average

803
00:32:03,919 --> 00:32:11,519
our corn meal response 2.1 percent

804
00:32:07,360 --> 00:32:14,159
soybeans a little better 2.3 percent

805
00:32:11,519 --> 00:32:16,159
so the average is up represented by the

806
00:32:14,159 --> 00:32:18,080
x on the graph

807
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:22,000
average is great what i'm really

808
00:32:18,080 --> 00:32:25,360
interested in is the variability soybean

809
00:32:22,000 --> 00:32:29,279
much less variable than the corn and if

810
00:32:25,360 --> 00:32:31,440
i look at corn data i'm seeing a lot of

811
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:33,279
upside potential

812
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:35,039
so in a lot of academic studies they

813
00:32:33,279 --> 00:32:36,880
won't talk about the variability they'll

814
00:32:35,039 --> 00:32:37,919
just talk about the average

815
00:32:36,880 --> 00:32:41,120
we're going to talk about the

816
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:44,399
variability the upside potential as well

817
00:32:41,120 --> 00:32:46,640
as the downside potential

818
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,640
sir

819
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,799
so in this trial it was very good

820
00:32:52,799 --> 00:32:57,679
questions and the question is what were

821
00:32:54,799 --> 00:33:00,720
the cover crops most of it was rye

822
00:32:57,679 --> 00:33:03,039
combination of after corn or after

823
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:04,799
soybean so whatever the farmer pretty

824
00:33:03,039 --> 00:33:06,799
much typically does

825
00:33:04,799 --> 00:33:08,799
a couple of the sites

826
00:33:06,799 --> 00:33:13,519
also and this was

827
00:33:08,799 --> 00:33:15,600
two site years on my farm after um

828
00:33:13,519 --> 00:33:18,159
after a red clover and then another

829
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:20,559
location had after red clover but

830
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:22,720
primarily was corn bean rotation with

831
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:24,720
winter rye after one

832
00:33:22,720 --> 00:33:27,279
or the other

833
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:30,080
so we run the numbers based on our yield

834
00:33:27,279 --> 00:33:32,240
responses and based on current market

835
00:33:30,080 --> 00:33:35,679
conditions at the time

836
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:39,039
we weren't close to um to break in we

837
00:33:35,679 --> 00:33:42,640
needed a yield response of 5.7 in corn

838
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:45,600
5.3 in soybeans to break even that means

839
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:47,120
we need to figure out under then market

840
00:33:45,600 --> 00:33:49,919
conditions

841
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:50,799
what's driving the responses here and

842
00:33:49,919 --> 00:33:53,679
here

843
00:33:50,799 --> 00:33:54,960
so that led to the next generation trial

844
00:33:53,679 --> 00:33:56,159
but before we do that i just want to

845
00:33:54,960 --> 00:34:00,159
look at a couple of the really

846
00:33:56,159 --> 00:34:01,760
interesting little cases from this trial

847
00:34:00,159 --> 00:34:04,799
all right

848
00:34:01,760 --> 00:34:06,559
it takes forever to get a yield response

849
00:34:04,799 --> 00:34:08,639
right

850
00:34:06,559 --> 00:34:10,960
no you can see it first year here's

851
00:34:08,639 --> 00:34:12,560
proof positive so this is on a kid or

852
00:34:10,960 --> 00:34:13,440
silt loan this is the first year of the

853
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:16,960
trial

854
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:19,919
winner after soybeans

855
00:34:16,960 --> 00:34:22,480
it's a no-till situation the pictures

856
00:34:19,919 --> 00:34:25,280
are taken here close up in a field shot

857
00:34:22,480 --> 00:34:28,159
taking the day of termination when i was

858
00:34:25,280 --> 00:34:30,240
there to do the sampling to characterize

859
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:32,000
the conservation

860
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:34,320
performance

861
00:34:32,000 --> 00:34:36,560
not a lot of biomass there 400 pounds we

862
00:34:34,320 --> 00:34:38,000
did in soil sampling realized we were

863
00:34:36,560 --> 00:34:40,079
able to scavenge

864
00:34:38,000 --> 00:34:42,000
some leftover nitrogen now this is going

865
00:34:40,079 --> 00:34:42,800
into corn so maybe that wasn't a good

866
00:34:42,000 --> 00:34:44,800
thing

867
00:34:42,800 --> 00:34:47,040
but even that little bit of growth rye

868
00:34:44,800 --> 00:34:48,879
growth we were able to scavenge 30

869
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:52,480
pounds of nitrogen to me from a

870
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:54,960
conservation standpoint that's huge

871
00:34:52,480 --> 00:34:57,680
cooperator nick here never grew a cover

872
00:34:54,960 --> 00:34:59,440
crop in his life

873
00:34:57,680 --> 00:35:02,119
at the end of the day

874
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:04,960
9.9 bushel yield increase

875
00:35:02,119 --> 00:35:07,599
5.3 percent

876
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:10,240
he grows cover crops now based on that

877
00:35:07,599 --> 00:35:12,400
one experience this is not the most

878
00:35:10,240 --> 00:35:14,839
spectacular one but i think this one is

879
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,880
more representative the most

880
00:35:14,839 --> 00:35:19,920
spectacular i'll get to you in a second

881
00:35:16,880 --> 00:35:22,960
sir most spectacular 18 bushel that was

882
00:35:19,920 --> 00:35:25,040
corn following red clover he too had

883
00:35:22,960 --> 00:35:25,760
grown it on his farm but he quit doing

884
00:35:25,040 --> 00:35:27,680
it

885
00:35:25,760 --> 00:35:29,440
guess what he went back to putting red

886
00:35:27,680 --> 00:35:31,200
clover in his winter wheat even though

887
00:35:29,440 --> 00:35:34,160
it's kind of hard to manage and that's

888
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:37,200
an expensive system he is doing it now

889
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:37,200
question or comment here

890
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:47,839
okay so most of these are after harvest

891
00:35:45,920 --> 00:35:51,359
in this tryout they were all drilled

892
00:35:47,839 --> 00:35:52,480
after harvest so we're looking at

893
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,800
november

894
00:35:52,480 --> 00:35:57,040
i mean in the case of soybeans yeah you

895
00:35:54,800 --> 00:35:59,839
can do it in october but realistically

896
00:35:57,040 --> 00:36:03,839
it's in in november

897
00:35:59,839 --> 00:36:03,839
so i told you i'm gonna run out of time

898
00:36:04,800 --> 00:36:09,280
yeah 10 25 here most of them are in that

899
00:36:07,200 --> 00:36:12,320
window these guys know that you got to

900
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:16,079
get it in the ground but things get in

901
00:36:12,320 --> 00:36:16,079
the way like harvest so

902
00:36:19,119 --> 00:36:24,320
yes and no

903
00:36:20,720 --> 00:36:24,320
how about you folks do you have aerial

904
00:36:24,839 --> 00:36:28,800
application so drones

905
00:36:29,839 --> 00:36:33,119
okay

906
00:36:30,960 --> 00:36:35,359
so we're getting more and more of that

907
00:36:33,119 --> 00:36:36,960
uh the drone phenomenon we're starting

908
00:36:35,359 --> 00:36:39,760
to see more and more of that in

909
00:36:36,960 --> 00:36:41,760
wisconsin i got rumors of two startups

910
00:36:39,760 --> 00:36:43,280
in southeast wisconsin that will be

911
00:36:41,760 --> 00:36:45,920
doing it

912
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,920
that works

913
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:49,680
there's a timing issue there i don't

914
00:36:47,680 --> 00:36:51,200
have time to get into the technicality

915
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:52,960
but i'll talk about that in the after

916
00:36:51,200 --> 00:36:56,320
session how about that or at the beer

917
00:36:52,960 --> 00:36:58,240
and thingy tonight

918
00:36:56,320 --> 00:37:00,160
i gotta keep rolling

919
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,680
so this one here this one is really

920
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:05,040
intriguing this shows adaptive

921
00:37:01,680 --> 00:37:07,119
management wet spring this is 2019.

922
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:10,720
the site has a long-term cover crop

923
00:37:07,119 --> 00:37:14,400
history two covers every three years so

924
00:37:10,720 --> 00:37:17,119
a summer cover after week followed by um

925
00:37:14,400 --> 00:37:18,800
rye after after corn stubble he had

926
00:37:17,119 --> 00:37:20,960
planned to burn down couldn't do it

927
00:37:18,800 --> 00:37:24,640
because it rained i did sample in the

928
00:37:20,960 --> 00:37:27,200
rain three weeks later he uh he planted

929
00:37:24,640 --> 00:37:30,640
green and then he terminated

930
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:33,599
what did he get 3.7 yield response 3.7

931
00:37:30,640 --> 00:37:36,400
percent yield response was that because

932
00:37:33,599 --> 00:37:39,119
of planting green was it because the

933
00:37:36,400 --> 00:37:40,960
non-cover was in withdrawal i don't know

934
00:37:39,119 --> 00:37:42,720
what's really intriguing about this site

935
00:37:40,960 --> 00:37:46,640
was i came back in the middle of the

936
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:48,480
season in no cover control treatments

937
00:37:46,640 --> 00:37:51,119
there was water hemp in the cover

938
00:37:48,480 --> 00:37:53,119
treatments there was no water happening

939
00:37:51,119 --> 00:37:55,599
can we use this planting green to

940
00:37:53,119 --> 00:37:55,599
suppress

941
00:37:55,839 --> 00:38:01,119
our troublesome glyphosate resistant

942
00:37:57,599 --> 00:38:04,079
weeds we will get to that at the end

943
00:38:01,119 --> 00:38:07,440
that led us that experience led us to my

944
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:09,440
current project so can cover crops pay

945
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:11,920
very much it's like the other one except

946
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:14,160
it's much larger in scale

947
00:38:11,920 --> 00:38:16,960
we're documenting the yield impacts but

948
00:38:14,160 --> 00:38:19,760
we're really drilling in on first year

949
00:38:16,960 --> 00:38:21,920
impacts but we're also looking at the

950
00:38:19,760 --> 00:38:24,160
cumulative effects we're still trying to

951
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:26,960
identify the best management practices

952
00:38:24,160 --> 00:38:28,880
to maximize yield and on the flip side

953
00:38:26,960 --> 00:38:32,000
to look at practices

954
00:38:28,880 --> 00:38:33,599
to avoid so you don't reduce yield we're

955
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:35,599
putting a number on it with a partial

956
00:38:33,599 --> 00:38:37,280
partial budget analysis we're going to

957
00:38:35,599 --> 00:38:38,720
generate a lot of

958
00:38:37,280 --> 00:38:41,920
data analysis

959
00:38:38,720 --> 00:38:44,880
this one i am punting to campus so we

960
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:47,760
have a extension a economist who will do

961
00:38:44,880 --> 00:38:49,520
the economic analysis

962
00:38:47,760 --> 00:38:51,359
and we're also collecting the

963
00:38:49,520 --> 00:38:54,560
conservation

964
00:38:51,359 --> 00:38:57,920
estimates in an effort to improve

965
00:38:54,560 --> 00:38:59,599
the numbers for water quality trade so

966
00:38:57,920 --> 00:39:01,760
the farmers that do this do get

967
00:38:59,599 --> 00:39:03,680
compensated for it

968
00:39:01,760 --> 00:39:07,040
at the farm level in effect what we've

969
00:39:03,680 --> 00:39:09,040
got annually is 30 little on-farm trials

970
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:11,200
where we're answering a specific

971
00:39:09,040 --> 00:39:13,200
question that a farmer may have

972
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:16,400
what about my seating rate

973
00:39:13,200 --> 00:39:18,320
or what about if i'm planting corn green

974
00:39:16,400 --> 00:39:21,359
what about nitrogen management should i

975
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:22,960
increase my starter fertilizer nitrogen

976
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:25,440
because the rye is presumably going to

977
00:39:22,960 --> 00:39:27,280
take some of it up so for the farmer

978
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:29,920
those are the questions that we're

979
00:39:27,280 --> 00:39:32,720
asking we take all that data in

980
00:39:29,920 --> 00:39:34,000
aggregate we do a meta analysis we can

981
00:39:32,720 --> 00:39:36,560
tease out

982
00:39:34,000 --> 00:39:38,640
what causes the yield impact is it this

983
00:39:36,560 --> 00:39:41,359
practice on this soil type in this

984
00:39:38,640 --> 00:39:43,760
environment so our goal is to get 90

985
00:39:41,359 --> 00:39:44,640
site years of data over three response

986
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:48,880
years

987
00:39:44,640 --> 00:39:48,880
that's pretty close to big data

988
00:39:50,960 --> 00:39:55,119
let me back up

989
00:39:53,359 --> 00:39:58,400
this trial is a little more involved we

990
00:39:55,119 --> 00:40:00,079
have the no cover control trial we also

991
00:39:58,400 --> 00:40:02,560
to look at the management factors we

992
00:40:00,079 --> 00:40:04,720
have two different cover treatments the

993
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:07,200
farmer's base treatment

994
00:40:04,720 --> 00:40:10,480
and then some variation on that the best

995
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:13,200
example is seeding rate so if i see dry

996
00:40:10,480 --> 00:40:14,640
at 40 what happens if i see it at 80.

997
00:40:13,200 --> 00:40:16,800
actually it's the other way around so

998
00:40:14,640 --> 00:40:18,640
nrcs says you've got to have in the

999
00:40:16,800 --> 00:40:20,400
state of wisconsin says you need to have

1000
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,640
higher seating rates than

1001
00:40:20,400 --> 00:40:24,800
probably what you really need so i'm

1002
00:40:22,640 --> 00:40:26,720
doing 80 can i get away with 40.

1003
00:40:24,800 --> 00:40:28,400
especially since rye seed prices have

1004
00:40:26,720 --> 00:40:30,960
basically doubled in the last couple of

1005
00:40:28,400 --> 00:40:32,640
years so that's the nature of the

1006
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:35,680
treatment design

1007
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:36,960
so fun facts we had a goal of 30 trials

1008
00:40:35,680 --> 00:40:40,160
to put out

1009
00:40:36,960 --> 00:40:41,599
this past year we got out 29 we lost one

1010
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:43,440
of them because of poor rye

1011
00:40:41,599 --> 00:40:46,320
establishment and that was in the

1012
00:40:43,440 --> 00:40:48,000
soybean stubble planted in uh first week

1013
00:40:46,320 --> 00:40:51,440
in december

1014
00:40:48,000 --> 00:40:53,359
27 of the 28 are cereal rye we do have

1015
00:40:51,440 --> 00:40:55,200
one winter wheat you always have to have

1016
00:40:53,359 --> 00:40:57,040
a contrarian out there he got some

1017
00:40:55,200 --> 00:40:58,720
really cheap seed he's got a really good

1018
00:40:57,040 --> 00:41:00,800
stay in the cover crop

1019
00:40:58,720 --> 00:41:04,000
more power to them most of trials are

1020
00:41:00,800 --> 00:41:05,680
looking at response in soybean but we do

1021
00:41:04,000 --> 00:41:07,760
have seven that are

1022
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:09,680
corn following soybean and then

1023
00:41:07,760 --> 00:41:12,480
interestingly we've got three that's

1024
00:41:09,680 --> 00:41:14,560
second year corn

1025
00:41:12,480 --> 00:41:16,560
and one of those is in a trial that i'm

1026
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:18,319
doing with my watershed group

1027
00:41:16,560 --> 00:41:20,480
the comparisons what are farmers really

1028
00:41:18,319 --> 00:41:21,520
interested in its rate and i think this

1029
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,200
is driven

1030
00:41:21,520 --> 00:41:24,319
since this is mostly rye by the fact

1031
00:41:23,200 --> 00:41:26,000
that rye

1032
00:41:24,319 --> 00:41:28,640
supplies have gotten really tight and

1033
00:41:26,000 --> 00:41:31,040
the seed costs have gone up dramatically

1034
00:41:28,640 --> 00:41:32,720
we've got some interest in

1035
00:41:31,040 --> 00:41:34,880
termination timing whether it's the burn

1036
00:41:32,720 --> 00:41:37,359
down or the pre-plant

1037
00:41:34,880 --> 00:41:39,119
and then nitrogen management and corn

1038
00:41:37,359 --> 00:41:41,760
and this is a picture from one of my

1039
00:41:39,119 --> 00:41:43,520
sites this is dodge coney um he's

1040
00:41:41,760 --> 00:41:45,119
looking at seating rate but he's also

1041
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:47,359
this is a double trial

1042
00:41:45,119 --> 00:41:49,920
so he's also looking at

1043
00:41:47,359 --> 00:41:52,400
skip roll planting so this is going to

1044
00:41:49,920 --> 00:41:54,560
in row versus between row

1045
00:41:52,400 --> 00:41:57,440
so when i say row crop row so this is

1046
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:59,200
going to yield some really interesting

1047
00:41:57,440 --> 00:42:01,119
results

1048
00:41:59,200 --> 00:42:03,760
and here's a map just showing where the

1049
00:42:01,119 --> 00:42:06,800
trials are located i put this up to show

1050
00:42:03,760 --> 00:42:08,960
the magnitude we're in six or sorry five

1051
00:42:06,800 --> 00:42:11,040
different counties i told you this is my

1052
00:42:08,960 --> 00:42:13,520
farm right here i've got a bunch of it

1053
00:42:11,040 --> 00:42:15,920
because it's easy to do research on your

1054
00:42:13,520 --> 00:42:18,000
own farm you don't have to travel unlike

1055
00:42:15,920 --> 00:42:20,160
up here into dodge county

1056
00:42:18,000 --> 00:42:22,000
so basically we're in a triangle what

1057
00:42:20,160 --> 00:42:24,880
this gives us is two different things

1058
00:42:22,000 --> 00:42:28,000
growing season environment and we have

1059
00:42:24,880 --> 00:42:30,400
definitely segregated uh environments

1060
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:32,480
keeps raining up here in dodge county

1061
00:42:30,400 --> 00:42:34,960
uh we're in drought down here and we're

1062
00:42:32,480 --> 00:42:35,839
seeing in kenosha county extremely dry

1063
00:42:34,960 --> 00:42:37,599
here

1064
00:42:35,839 --> 00:42:40,079
in rock county we're somewhere in

1065
00:42:37,599 --> 00:42:41,920
between we have the best soil types in

1066
00:42:40,079 --> 00:42:43,839
the state of wisconsin plano salt loam

1067
00:42:41,920 --> 00:42:45,040
we also have kitters

1068
00:42:43,839 --> 00:42:47,920
sandy loam

1069
00:42:45,040 --> 00:42:50,400
that's on the well-drained soil class we

1070
00:42:47,920 --> 00:42:53,760
also have some very poorly drained

1071
00:42:50,400 --> 00:42:56,640
soils here in dodge county uh pella

1072
00:42:53,760 --> 00:42:58,560
and then some elliots and tile during

1073
00:42:56,640 --> 00:43:00,800
other tile drained

1074
00:42:58,560 --> 00:43:01,920
type soil types in

1075
00:43:00,800 --> 00:43:04,160
in

1076
00:43:01,920 --> 00:43:07,280
racine county

1077
00:43:04,160 --> 00:43:09,040
all right last topic

1078
00:43:07,280 --> 00:43:11,200
and this again is based on that first

1079
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,280
one the observation that hey there's no

1080
00:43:11,200 --> 00:43:15,760
water hemp where we planted the rye

1081
00:43:13,280 --> 00:43:19,119
green can we suppress glyphosate

1082
00:43:15,760 --> 00:43:21,440
resistant weeds in no-till soybean these

1083
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:24,000
are the weeds that we're concerned with

1084
00:43:21,440 --> 00:43:25,440
in southeast wisconsin

1085
00:43:24,000 --> 00:43:28,000
giant rag

1086
00:43:25,440 --> 00:43:29,839
this is a field picture and a close-up

1087
00:43:28,000 --> 00:43:32,480
of a resistant

1088
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:34,880
individual this is on my farm this

1089
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:36,480
population was just confirmed by

1090
00:43:34,880 --> 00:43:37,839
uw-madison

1091
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:41,119
two weeks ago

1092
00:43:37,839 --> 00:43:44,000
it also has multiple uh other

1093
00:43:41,119 --> 00:43:45,599
resistances which i don't understand

1094
00:43:44,000 --> 00:43:47,760
because i haven't used those modes of

1095
00:43:45,599 --> 00:43:51,119
action on my farm and on my farm as far

1096
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:52,720
as glyphosate stewardship i have done

1097
00:43:51,119 --> 00:43:55,599
everything right i have never used the

1098
00:43:52,720 --> 00:43:57,520
roundup ready trait in corn

1099
00:43:55,599 --> 00:44:00,000
my presumption is

1100
00:43:57,520 --> 00:44:01,440
that this is pollen the blue end from

1101
00:44:00,000 --> 00:44:04,319
somewhere else

1102
00:44:01,440 --> 00:44:06,720
the other one meers tail this one is all

1103
00:44:04,319 --> 00:44:08,800
over uh confirmed resistance for about

1104
00:44:06,720 --> 00:44:11,520
the last 10 years

1105
00:44:08,800 --> 00:44:14,079
now in southeast wisconsin these two

1106
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:16,560
pictures are from tom novak's from his

1107
00:44:14,079 --> 00:44:18,160
clients and they show in the field this

1108
00:44:16,560 --> 00:44:20,480
one with the marestail

1109
00:44:18,160 --> 00:44:23,119
you can see the susceptible versus the

1110
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:25,119
resistant individuals and then a

1111
00:44:23,119 --> 00:44:27,440
close-up of

1112
00:44:25,119 --> 00:44:29,119
the resistant individuals and then water

1113
00:44:27,440 --> 00:44:30,400
hemp these plants are taken from the

1114
00:44:29,119 --> 00:44:33,440
same field

1115
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:36,079
obvious case of resistance

1116
00:44:33,440 --> 00:44:38,319
we don't have palmer amaranth yet i just

1117
00:44:36,079 --> 00:44:40,880
submitted a seed sample

1118
00:44:38,319 --> 00:44:43,599
from some camelina seed i used as a

1119
00:44:40,880 --> 00:44:44,480
cover crop with my rye on my farm last

1120
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,319
year

1121
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:47,920
i just got a call two days ago from

1122
00:44:46,319 --> 00:44:49,200
foundation seed i sent it in for

1123
00:44:47,920 --> 00:44:51,200
analysis

1124
00:44:49,200 --> 00:44:54,079
purity and germination

1125
00:44:51,200 --> 00:44:56,560
we have amaranth seed in there

1126
00:44:54,079 --> 00:45:00,160
will you pay for dna testing for four

1127
00:44:56,560 --> 00:45:03,200
seeds that's a hundred bucks absolutely

1128
00:45:00,160 --> 00:45:05,760
palmer amaranth it's on the

1129
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:07,920
horizon we've got it in illinois just

1130
00:45:05,760 --> 00:45:10,800
across the illinois border you folks

1131
00:45:07,920 --> 00:45:10,800
dealing with it yet

1132
00:45:11,359 --> 00:45:16,079
let's hope it

1133
00:45:13,760 --> 00:45:19,560
you did

1134
00:45:16,079 --> 00:45:19,560
southern iowa

1135
00:45:22,880 --> 00:45:28,240
that's another thing just to watch and

1136
00:45:25,440 --> 00:45:29,680
be careful of because that one

1137
00:45:28,240 --> 00:45:31,200
the experience in the southern united

1138
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:35,040
states is something we don't want to

1139
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:35,040
deal with but it's on its way

1140
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:41,040
produced on farm

1141
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:44,880
by one of my cooperators i cleaned it

1142
00:45:41,040 --> 00:45:48,640
but the seeds smaller than the

1143
00:45:44,880 --> 00:45:50,240
camelina seed and i don't have

1144
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:52,319
official cleaning equipment i did a

1145
00:45:50,240 --> 00:45:53,839
window screen

1146
00:45:52,319 --> 00:45:55,520
so it's there

1147
00:45:53,839 --> 00:45:58,640
did he have it on his farm i don't know

1148
00:45:55,520 --> 00:46:00,079
i haven't talked to him yet about it

1149
00:45:58,640 --> 00:46:02,720
i wait till i get the positive or

1150
00:46:00,079 --> 00:46:04,240
negative results before i

1151
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:06,880
spook him

1152
00:46:04,240 --> 00:46:08,480
all right so the last trial um we're

1153
00:46:06,880 --> 00:46:09,760
looking at wheat suppression and

1154
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:12,560
basically this is the same group of

1155
00:46:09,760 --> 00:46:14,560
cooperators as in the first one so this

1156
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,599
is funded by the sare partnership

1157
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:18,400
program

1158
00:46:15,599 --> 00:46:19,839
two-year we have four locations and then

1159
00:46:18,400 --> 00:46:22,560
four replicates so we're going to

1160
00:46:19,839 --> 00:46:25,040
generate a lot of data we have three

1161
00:46:22,560 --> 00:46:28,000
basic treatment sets the first one is

1162
00:46:25,040 --> 00:46:30,240
the control treatment this is no rye and

1163
00:46:28,000 --> 00:46:31,200
we are using best management practices

1164
00:46:30,240 --> 00:46:34,480
for

1165
00:46:31,200 --> 00:46:37,040
management of the uh

1166
00:46:34,480 --> 00:46:39,599
the resistant weed so we start clean

1167
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:41,520
that means complete burn down glyphosate

1168
00:46:39,599 --> 00:46:42,720
plus some kind of growth regulator

1169
00:46:41,520 --> 00:46:46,000
herbicide

1170
00:46:42,720 --> 00:46:49,119
to control the ones that are resistant

1171
00:46:46,000 --> 00:46:50,560
so we used lv6 last year

1172
00:46:49,119 --> 00:46:52,079
this year because of our tightened up

1173
00:46:50,560 --> 00:46:54,319
planting window and i didn't want to

1174
00:46:52,079 --> 00:46:54,319
have

1175
00:46:54,480 --> 00:47:00,319
planting restrictions we used um in list

1176
00:46:58,079 --> 00:47:01,359
all these trials are using the endless

1177
00:47:00,319 --> 00:47:04,720
trade

1178
00:47:01,359 --> 00:47:07,359
and then we use residual so um the

1179
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:11,040
generic version of authority for same

1180
00:47:07,359 --> 00:47:12,079
thing as uh sonic i can't pronounce the

1181
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:13,839
uh

1182
00:47:12,079 --> 00:47:15,440
common names with all of you looking at

1183
00:47:13,839 --> 00:47:17,359
me in fact i wrote them down i can't

1184
00:47:15,440 --> 00:47:19,359
read my own writing so you all know what

1185
00:47:17,359 --> 00:47:22,000
i'm talking about right

1186
00:47:19,359 --> 00:47:23,599
all right the next set is the first

1187
00:47:22,000 --> 00:47:26,000
cover crop treatments these that were

1188
00:47:23,599 --> 00:47:28,240
burning down but on our data it's

1189
00:47:26,000 --> 00:47:30,560
labeled as pre-emergents why i call it

1190
00:47:28,240 --> 00:47:32,400
that some people burn down beforehand

1191
00:47:30,560 --> 00:47:34,400
some people plant it then terminated

1192
00:47:32,400 --> 00:47:36,400
right away here we have two rye

1193
00:47:34,400 --> 00:47:37,680
treatments 40 and 80 pounds to get at

1194
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:38,880
the seating rate

1195
00:47:37,680 --> 00:47:41,680
difference

1196
00:47:38,880 --> 00:47:44,160
and we use the same herbicide so the

1197
00:47:41,680 --> 00:47:46,319
glyphosate that's in the burn down mix

1198
00:47:44,160 --> 00:47:49,359
also terminates the rye

1199
00:47:46,319 --> 00:47:51,839
the planting grain treatments same rye

1200
00:47:49,359 --> 00:47:54,720
treatments 40 and 80. we're using the

1201
00:47:51,839 --> 00:47:56,880
broadleaf burned down so they enlist the

1202
00:47:54,720 --> 00:48:00,240
growth regulator herbicide to control

1203
00:47:56,880 --> 00:48:03,280
the broadleaf weeds that are there and

1204
00:48:00,240 --> 00:48:06,800
the residual and we come back with the

1205
00:48:03,280 --> 00:48:08,319
glyphosate to terminate the rye the rye

1206
00:48:06,800 --> 00:48:11,440
we're terminating

1207
00:48:08,319 --> 00:48:14,079
at pollination so in effect in our data

1208
00:48:11,440 --> 00:48:16,079
set we have the two polar extremes we

1209
00:48:14,079 --> 00:48:19,040
have the minimum amount of rye growth

1210
00:48:16,079 --> 00:48:21,520
pre-plant that we burn down or at

1211
00:48:19,040 --> 00:48:23,839
anthesis and there's some implications

1212
00:48:21,520 --> 00:48:26,800
that i'm going to talk about in a minute

1213
00:48:23,839 --> 00:48:28,640
our questions of course can ry do it

1214
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:30,400
what about the termination timing is

1215
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:32,880
that important and what about the

1216
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:36,400
seating rate does it matter especially

1217
00:48:32,880 --> 00:48:39,599
since seed has gotten to be so expensive

1218
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:44,400
so here's our one year results so far

1219
00:48:39,599 --> 00:48:47,760
and again 2021 this was a drought year

1220
00:48:44,400 --> 00:48:50,319
suppression yes both in mayor's

1221
00:48:47,760 --> 00:48:52,480
and giant ragweed

1222
00:48:50,319 --> 00:48:55,599
waterhemp did not show up to the party

1223
00:48:52,480 --> 00:48:58,319
last year it showed up this year but we

1224
00:48:55,599 --> 00:48:59,839
don't have data from it from last year

1225
00:48:58,319 --> 00:49:00,559
going from nori

1226
00:48:59,839 --> 00:49:01,599
to

1227
00:49:00,559 --> 00:49:03,760
the uh

1228
00:49:01,599 --> 00:49:04,880
the plant green and terminate late

1229
00:49:03,760 --> 00:49:07,520
treatment

1230
00:49:04,880 --> 00:49:11,359
in mare's tale and this is measured 45

1231
00:49:07,520 --> 00:49:12,720
days after planting marestail 98

1232
00:49:11,359 --> 00:49:16,240
suppression

1233
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:17,920
in the giant rag 99

1234
00:49:16,240 --> 00:49:20,559
suppression

1235
00:49:17,920 --> 00:49:23,040
so yes it does work

1236
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:25,200
what about the uh the burn down yes

1237
00:49:23,040 --> 00:49:27,440
we're seeing suppression there also in

1238
00:49:25,200 --> 00:49:28,640
the case of mare's tail 64 percent

1239
00:49:27,440 --> 00:49:31,200
suppression

1240
00:49:28,640 --> 00:49:33,839
and in the case of the giant rag

1241
00:49:31,200 --> 00:49:36,079
50 percent um

1242
00:49:33,839 --> 00:49:38,400
suppression the other thing

1243
00:49:36,079 --> 00:49:38,400
question

1244
00:49:39,620 --> 00:49:42,840
[Music]

1245
00:49:43,280 --> 00:49:47,440
so you peeked ahead at my next slide

1246
00:49:46,559 --> 00:49:49,040
so

1247
00:49:47,440 --> 00:49:51,280
let me say i should have said this up

1248
00:49:49,040 --> 00:49:51,280
front

1249
00:49:56,160 --> 00:50:01,119
okay so the honest answer is and this is

1250
00:49:59,559 --> 00:50:05,200
counterintuitive

1251
00:50:01,119 --> 00:50:08,400
seeding rate had no impact on any of our

1252
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:10,960
response variables other than

1253
00:50:08,400 --> 00:50:12,640
biomass production

1254
00:50:10,960 --> 00:50:14,640
so that makes sense you got more plants

1255
00:50:12,640 --> 00:50:17,200
you're going to produce more biomass

1256
00:50:14,640 --> 00:50:19,359
what is counterintuitive is we assume

1257
00:50:17,200 --> 00:50:20,720
it's that biomass that's giving us the

1258
00:50:19,359 --> 00:50:23,119
weed suppression

1259
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:26,880
either through competition

1260
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:29,359
or as a residue mat to keep the weeds

1261
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:31,520
down from germinating or physically

1262
00:50:29,359 --> 00:50:31,520
to

1263
00:50:32,079 --> 00:50:35,920
to inhibit them and then there's the

1264
00:50:33,839 --> 00:50:38,160
issue of allelopathy so what the

1265
00:50:35,920 --> 00:50:41,200
research literature says that the

1266
00:50:38,160 --> 00:50:44,079
chemicals that are in the biomass they

1267
00:50:41,200 --> 00:50:46,559
reach their peak concentration right at

1268
00:50:44,079 --> 00:50:48,319
pollination you got more biomass a

1269
00:50:46,559 --> 00:50:50,720
higher concentration that natural

1270
00:50:48,319 --> 00:50:52,839
herbicide is there it makes sense if you

1271
00:50:50,720 --> 00:50:56,480
got more biomass you'd have better weed

1272
00:50:52,839 --> 00:51:00,000
suppression planting rate doesn't matter

1273
00:50:56,480 --> 00:51:02,000
recently published uh studies by um penn

1274
00:51:00,000 --> 00:51:03,839
state university there's two of them

1275
00:51:02,000 --> 00:51:05,680
they looked at the same thing basically

1276
00:51:03,839 --> 00:51:08,640
the same seating rates they found the

1277
00:51:05,680 --> 00:51:10,400
same effect biomass yes any crop

1278
00:51:08,640 --> 00:51:11,839
response variable

1279
00:51:10,400 --> 00:51:13,760
no

1280
00:51:11,839 --> 00:51:14,880
so you can cut your seeding rate

1281
00:51:13,760 --> 00:51:16,800
but i shouldn't say that because it's

1282
00:51:14,880 --> 00:51:19,920
only one year of data

1283
00:51:16,800 --> 00:51:22,800
but going back to the other on-farm data

1284
00:51:19,920 --> 00:51:25,680
they're all doing 40 pounds

1285
00:51:22,800 --> 00:51:28,240
so nrcs in wisconsin requires for cost

1286
00:51:25,680 --> 00:51:31,680
share programs 55 pounds

1287
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:34,079
iowa illinois are you in the

1288
00:51:31,680 --> 00:51:37,079
i heard 40.

1289
00:51:34,079 --> 00:51:37,079
46.

1290
00:51:37,920 --> 00:51:42,240
yeah of course

1291
00:51:39,599 --> 00:51:42,240
yeah of course

1292
00:51:43,599 --> 00:51:46,640
okay

1293
00:51:45,119 --> 00:51:48,079
yeah right then you gotta you gotta

1294
00:51:46,640 --> 00:51:49,760
boost it that that makes sense so we're

1295
00:51:48,079 --> 00:51:52,880
all in the same ballpark but the point

1296
00:51:49,760 --> 00:51:56,000
is that it didn't

1297
00:51:52,880 --> 00:52:00,720
okay so we saw

1298
00:51:56,000 --> 00:52:02,400
a 98 reduction by planting green

1299
00:52:00,720 --> 00:52:05,440
i can't show you the data you've already

1300
00:52:02,400 --> 00:52:07,440
seen it in that soybean yield we're also

1301
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:09,760
by planting green and terminating late

1302
00:52:07,440 --> 00:52:11,760
able to suppress soybean yield by

1303
00:52:09,760 --> 00:52:13,200
29

1304
00:52:11,760 --> 00:52:15,040
in a drought here

1305
00:52:13,200 --> 00:52:16,640
that's unacceptable

1306
00:52:15,040 --> 00:52:18,160
so i told you we got the two polar

1307
00:52:16,640 --> 00:52:22,240
extremes

1308
00:52:18,160 --> 00:52:22,240
of biomass production

1309
00:52:22,640 --> 00:52:27,520
there's a sweet spot in there somewhere

1310
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:29,280
in between and that's my next generation

1311
00:52:27,520 --> 00:52:31,040
work so people are looking at my data

1312
00:52:29,280 --> 00:52:33,680
and they heckle me at field days all the

1313
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:36,000
time you're killing it too late

1314
00:52:33,680 --> 00:52:37,119
well no this is a formal trial we're

1315
00:52:36,000 --> 00:52:39,520
trying to see what the degree of

1316
00:52:37,119 --> 00:52:41,200
suppression is somewhere between the two

1317
00:52:39,520 --> 00:52:43,200
is the sweet spot where we're not

1318
00:52:41,200 --> 00:52:46,000
impacting yield

1319
00:52:43,200 --> 00:52:47,599
but we're getting the weed suppression

1320
00:52:46,000 --> 00:52:48,720
that's what i'm looking for and my

1321
00:52:47,599 --> 00:52:50,960
questions are

1322
00:52:48,720 --> 00:52:53,520
how do we stage it do we stage it based

1323
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:54,800
on rye growth stage do we base it on

1324
00:52:53,520 --> 00:52:55,839
height

1325
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:58,240
because people are saying when it gets

1326
00:52:55,839 --> 00:53:00,800
knee high you terminate it do we base it

1327
00:52:58,240 --> 00:53:02,960
on the soybean growth stage so i got to

1328
00:53:00,800 --> 00:53:04,640
figure out funding

1329
00:53:02,960 --> 00:53:06,720
you say folks i'm coming back to you

1330
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,880
this fall and figure out how to do it

1331
00:53:06,720 --> 00:53:10,400
this is a really involved trial i can't

1332
00:53:08,880 --> 00:53:12,160
do it on farmers this is going to have

1333
00:53:10,400 --> 00:53:14,240
to be done on my farm because you're

1334
00:53:12,160 --> 00:53:16,880
going to be terminating like every five

1335
00:53:14,240 --> 00:53:18,640
to seven days a different treatment

1336
00:53:16,880 --> 00:53:21,280
so anyway and here

1337
00:53:18,640 --> 00:53:23,280
that's where we're going with this data

1338
00:53:21,280 --> 00:53:25,359
so here's the seating rate thing matches

1339
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:28,559
work by penn state

1340
00:53:25,359 --> 00:53:30,480
what our data doesn't show you is that

1341
00:53:28,559 --> 00:53:32,480
plain and green

1342
00:53:30,480 --> 00:53:34,079
delayed the flush

1343
00:53:32,480 --> 00:53:37,839
the mid-season

1344
00:53:34,079 --> 00:53:40,240
flush of weeds it delayed it

1345
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:41,599
the implication here is that if you're

1346
00:53:40,240 --> 00:53:42,960
suppressing

1347
00:53:41,599 --> 00:53:45,839
maybe

1348
00:53:42,960 --> 00:53:48,720
you can get away with one in-season

1349
00:53:45,839 --> 00:53:50,640
post-emergence application versus two

1350
00:53:48,720 --> 00:53:52,640
i've got guys in my neighborhood that

1351
00:53:50,640 --> 00:53:54,400
are on three i'm sure they're up against

1352
00:53:52,640 --> 00:53:57,520
the limit on their enlist as far as

1353
00:53:54,400 --> 00:54:00,319
total active ingredient per year

1354
00:53:57,520 --> 00:54:01,760
on my farm i showed you that picture

1355
00:54:00,319 --> 00:54:04,000
i got away

1356
00:54:01,760 --> 00:54:05,359
in most of the field with one

1357
00:54:04,000 --> 00:54:06,960
application

1358
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:08,559
but this is actually a really

1359
00:54:06,960 --> 00:54:10,400
interesting story

1360
00:54:08,559 --> 00:54:12,960
so this is the field that i got all my

1361
00:54:10,400 --> 00:54:14,800
soybean research in i went to terminate

1362
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:16,319
a couple weeks after planting

1363
00:54:14,800 --> 00:54:18,960
it was turning dry i started getting

1364
00:54:16,319 --> 00:54:20,079
concerned i opened the field up it got

1365
00:54:18,960 --> 00:54:21,280
dark

1366
00:54:20,079 --> 00:54:23,839
so i thought okay i'm going to start

1367
00:54:21,280 --> 00:54:26,160
spraying the next day

1368
00:54:23,839 --> 00:54:28,960
was too windy too windy to spray for

1369
00:54:26,160 --> 00:54:30,400
eight days the rye grew like this i

1370
00:54:28,960 --> 00:54:32,480
couldn't see my rows i don't have

1371
00:54:30,400 --> 00:54:33,839
guidance equipment i'm too small

1372
00:54:32,480 --> 00:54:35,119
where i grew like this i couldn't see

1373
00:54:33,839 --> 00:54:37,520
the rose but i could see the green

1374
00:54:35,119 --> 00:54:39,599
streaks where the rye had taken up the

1375
00:54:37,520 --> 00:54:41,599
sulfur and the starter that i applied to

1376
00:54:39,599 --> 00:54:44,800
the soybeans

1377
00:54:41,599 --> 00:54:46,240
where i had sprayed it the first time

1378
00:54:44,800 --> 00:54:48,720
i had to go back

1379
00:54:46,240 --> 00:54:51,599
with enlist and glyphosate because i had

1380
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:52,720
a flush of weeds coming on the other

1381
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:55,839
where i

1382
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:57,440
did it really late i just recently like

1383
00:54:55,839 --> 00:55:00,079
within the last couple of weeks made my

1384
00:54:57,440 --> 00:55:01,359
one and only application so i saved an

1385
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:03,040
application

1386
00:55:01,359 --> 00:55:05,920
where this is important other than

1387
00:55:03,040 --> 00:55:08,480
saving money from one application if we

1388
00:55:05,920 --> 00:55:09,839
have fewer individuals from that

1389
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:12,079
suppression

1390
00:55:09,839 --> 00:55:14,480
plus fewer applications

1391
00:55:12,079 --> 00:55:17,119
that means that we have fewer

1392
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:18,880
individuals

1393
00:55:17,119 --> 00:55:20,559
that are going to be exposed to this new

1394
00:55:18,880 --> 00:55:23,119
active ingredient

1395
00:55:20,559 --> 00:55:25,599
which reduces our chances of developing

1396
00:55:23,119 --> 00:55:27,440
resistance so this is a resistance

1397
00:55:25,599 --> 00:55:29,920
management tool

1398
00:55:27,440 --> 00:55:31,920
and it behooves all of us

1399
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:34,559
to practice resistance management

1400
00:55:31,920 --> 00:55:35,760
because we've got nothing new coming

1401
00:55:34,559 --> 00:55:38,319
down

1402
00:55:35,760 --> 00:55:40,559
the pipeline as far as new products to

1403
00:55:38,319 --> 00:55:43,040
deal with it so we've lost

1404
00:55:40,559 --> 00:55:45,200
we've lost glyphosate and a lot of weeds

1405
00:55:43,040 --> 00:55:47,119
and that's really unfortunate in these

1406
00:55:45,200 --> 00:55:48,400
other chemistries we could lose them too

1407
00:55:47,119 --> 00:55:50,720
if we don't manage it

1408
00:55:48,400 --> 00:55:52,319
anything we can do it's important

1409
00:55:50,720 --> 00:55:54,480
the reason i'm harping on this other

1410
00:55:52,319 --> 00:55:56,480
than i have the resistant population a

1411
00:55:54,480 --> 00:55:58,720
giant rag on my farm

1412
00:55:56,480 --> 00:56:01,920
look at this picture here this is giant

1413
00:55:58,720 --> 00:56:05,920
rag this is five days after a full rate

1414
00:56:01,920 --> 00:56:07,680
and list dual application

1415
00:56:05,920 --> 00:56:10,799
look at its colleagues they're all

1416
00:56:07,680 --> 00:56:12,319
yellow they're twisted up

1417
00:56:10,799 --> 00:56:14,319
brings a smile to my face seeing them

1418
00:56:12,319 --> 00:56:15,599
all twisted up like that not this giant

1419
00:56:14,319 --> 00:56:17,760
ragweed here

1420
00:56:15,599 --> 00:56:20,960
look at the the leaf margins they're all

1421
00:56:17,760 --> 00:56:24,240
fused you see this with apple or with

1422
00:56:20,960 --> 00:56:26,720
exposure to certain modes of action

1423
00:56:24,240 --> 00:56:28,720
i've never seen it like this it's also

1424
00:56:26,720 --> 00:56:31,599
green and growing it's got a little

1425
00:56:28,720 --> 00:56:35,119
crook to it which shows the

1426
00:56:31,599 --> 00:56:37,440
the 2 4 d exposure

1427
00:56:35,119 --> 00:56:39,280
to me this plant is doing something with

1428
00:56:37,440 --> 00:56:42,160
that active ingredient it's figuring out

1429
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:45,040
how to metabolize it metabolize it it

1430
00:56:42,160 --> 00:56:47,680
goes on to reproduce that's just

1431
00:56:45,040 --> 00:56:49,520
resistance developing in my field

1432
00:56:47,680 --> 00:56:51,280
right now

1433
00:56:49,520 --> 00:56:53,839
i pulled that weed before i even put the

1434
00:56:51,280 --> 00:56:58,400
camera away i don't want any part of

1435
00:56:53,839 --> 00:57:00,640
resistance this motor action on my farm

1436
00:56:58,400 --> 00:57:02,640
all right like i said this work is

1437
00:57:00,640 --> 00:57:05,920
ongoing we're going to get a bunch of

1438
00:57:02,640 --> 00:57:08,240
results uh this year the yield response

1439
00:57:05,920 --> 00:57:10,240
is going to be a couple years out but we

1440
00:57:08,240 --> 00:57:11,280
have ample evidence that i am confident

1441
00:57:10,240 --> 00:57:13,920
in saying

1442
00:57:11,280 --> 00:57:15,680
that if you use adaptive management that

1443
00:57:13,920 --> 00:57:17,839
means manage the cover crops

1444
00:57:15,680 --> 00:57:19,520
appropriately don't let them get too big

1445
00:57:17,839 --> 00:57:22,880
don't let them compete against your crop

1446
00:57:19,520 --> 00:57:26,079
don't let them use soil moisture

1447
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:27,599
we can see first-year responses and with

1448
00:57:26,079 --> 00:57:29,040
the pre-plant termination if you're

1449
00:57:27,599 --> 00:57:30,960
using the rye

1450
00:57:29,040 --> 00:57:32,480
or the cover crop just to manage soil

1451
00:57:30,960 --> 00:57:33,760
moisture

1452
00:57:32,480 --> 00:57:35,359
it may seem like a waste if you're

1453
00:57:33,760 --> 00:57:37,920
terminating it but there's still some

1454
00:57:35,359 --> 00:57:41,520
kind of yield benefit there and also

1455
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:44,000
there is um

1456
00:57:41,520 --> 00:57:46,400
there also is uh weed suppression i

1457
00:57:44,000 --> 00:57:49,200
forgot to talk about 20 22 because this

1458
00:57:46,400 --> 00:57:51,680
is about when i killed the screen

1459
00:57:49,200 --> 00:57:54,640
so our 2022 data

1460
00:57:51,680 --> 00:57:57,280
um pretty much mirrors what we saw in

1461
00:57:54,640 --> 00:57:59,839
2021

1462
00:57:57,280 --> 00:58:03,040
but this is universal across all four

1463
00:57:59,839 --> 00:58:04,480
farms we are seeing foxtail suppression

1464
00:58:03,040 --> 00:58:05,760
even in the

1465
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:09,440
burn down

1466
00:58:05,760 --> 00:58:10,640
treatment that's lasting long beyond the

1467
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:13,280
residual

1468
00:58:10,640 --> 00:58:15,599
products that we put down that to me is

1469
00:58:13,280 --> 00:58:18,079
really intriguing and these guys tend to

1470
00:58:15,599 --> 00:58:20,160
go back they're all in 30 inch rows so

1471
00:58:18,079 --> 00:58:21,920
they tend to go back with

1472
00:58:20,160 --> 00:58:23,839
some kind of grass herbicide both

1473
00:58:21,920 --> 00:58:25,760
post-emergents but they also put

1474
00:58:23,839 --> 00:58:27,520
metallic lore on because they're worried

1475
00:58:25,760 --> 00:58:30,079
about season long control

1476
00:58:27,520 --> 00:58:31,200
so that um observation is really

1477
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:34,160
intriguing

1478
00:58:31,200 --> 00:58:36,160
and really positive

1479
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:38,720
next thing is to make these things work

1480
00:58:36,160 --> 00:58:41,040
use the low cost cover crop systems

1481
00:58:38,720 --> 00:58:43,839
wherever possible so that's the result

1482
00:58:41,040 --> 00:58:45,599
of that first one do cover crops pay

1483
00:58:43,839 --> 00:58:47,599
that was the major take-home

1484
00:58:45,599 --> 00:58:49,520
message in effect we had the yield

1485
00:58:47,599 --> 00:58:51,839
response it wasn't enough to break even

1486
00:58:49,520 --> 00:58:53,839
but it reduced our cover crop costs by

1487
00:58:51,839 --> 00:58:56,000
60 percent

1488
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:57,599
reducing the rye rate

1489
00:58:56,000 --> 00:59:01,119
looking at ways to

1490
00:58:57,599 --> 00:59:03,920
terminate it with your routine

1491
00:59:01,119 --> 00:59:06,160
program your routine herbicide program

1492
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:08,000
so you don't have additional costs

1493
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:10,640
and then planting green we are seeing

1494
00:59:08,000 --> 00:59:13,359
demonstrated weed suppression

1495
00:59:10,640 --> 00:59:15,680
so we have to find again that sweet spot

1496
00:59:13,359 --> 00:59:17,359
that's somewhere between yield reduction

1497
00:59:15,680 --> 00:59:19,440
but we get the suppression and i'm going

1498
00:59:17,359 --> 00:59:20,960
to be working on that hard

1499
00:59:19,440 --> 00:59:22,480
in the future

1500
00:59:20,960 --> 00:59:23,440
so that we can have our cake and eat it

1501
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:26,160
too

1502
00:59:23,440 --> 00:59:29,119
with that i finished on

1503
00:59:26,160 --> 00:59:29,119
two minutes over

1504
00:59:29,520 --> 00:59:36,319
i am done i'm ready for the grilling any

1505
00:59:32,079 --> 00:59:36,319
questions or comments in the back

1506
00:59:36,720 --> 00:59:41,200
the question if you use the cover crop

1507
00:59:38,720 --> 00:59:43,680
for something else is it still a cover

1508
00:59:41,200 --> 00:59:47,680
crop so the cover crop purifies tell you

1509
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:49,760
no that is a crop you are harvesting

1510
00:59:47,680 --> 00:59:51,839
what is a cover crop it provides soil

1511
00:59:49,760 --> 00:59:53,599
cover during vulnerable i mean this gets

1512
00:59:51,839 --> 00:59:56,400
back to the original definition during

1513
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:59,200
vulnerable periods in your rotation

1514
00:59:56,400 --> 01:00:00,880
as such uri is doing that my inner

1515
00:59:59,200 --> 01:00:02,799
farmer says you're finding a way to

1516
01:00:00,880 --> 01:00:05,520
market this and make more money so i

1517
01:00:02,799 --> 01:00:07,920
talked about my initial work looking at

1518
01:00:05,520 --> 01:00:12,400
the nutrient implications of rye

1519
01:00:07,920 --> 01:00:14,400
rye is a luxury consumer of both p and k

1520
01:00:12,400 --> 01:00:16,880
the higher

1521
01:00:14,400 --> 01:00:19,359
your soil test results are the higher

1522
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:21,760
the tissue concentration

1523
01:00:19,359 --> 01:00:23,440
it's like open bar at a wedding versus

1524
01:00:21,760 --> 01:00:25,359
cash bar

1525
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:28,480
rye is definitely at the open bar it'll

1526
01:00:25,359 --> 01:00:31,119
suck up everything that it can so that

1527
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,640
would be a concern the allelopathy just

1528
01:00:31,119 --> 01:00:34,799
in corn and beans i wouldn't worry about

1529
01:00:32,640 --> 01:00:36,720
it i'd be more worried about that

1530
01:00:34,799 --> 01:00:38,880
with the grass seed

1531
01:00:36,720 --> 01:00:40,799
for the mat that you're producing right

1532
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:42,799
so and i talked about the concentration

1533
01:00:40,799 --> 01:00:44,960
of the little chemicals so we have

1534
01:00:42,799 --> 01:00:46,720
identified them they're benzoic acids

1535
01:00:44,960 --> 01:00:49,280
that's the same thing as

1536
01:00:46,720 --> 01:00:51,280
bentazon so it's like commercial

1537
01:00:49,280 --> 01:00:53,680
herbicides that are out there

1538
01:00:51,280 --> 01:00:57,119
so traditional wisdom says it's a small

1539
01:00:53,680 --> 01:00:58,880
seeded species that are more susceptible

1540
01:00:57,119 --> 01:01:00,720
than larger that's what we can get away

1541
01:00:58,880 --> 01:01:02,799
with it with corn and beans

1542
01:01:00,720 --> 01:01:05,119
but not alfalfa so think about that

1543
01:01:02,799 --> 01:01:06,720
grass seed that's really tiny

1544
01:01:05,119 --> 01:01:08,480
so maybe you ought to do a little pilot

1545
01:01:06,720 --> 01:01:12,160
on the side to see if it works with

1546
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:14,799
germination with your your intended crop

1547
01:01:12,160 --> 01:01:16,160
yeah so the question is allelopathy is

1548
01:01:14,799 --> 01:01:18,799
it with the

1549
01:01:16,160 --> 01:01:21,599
is it in the above ground portion or

1550
01:01:18,799 --> 01:01:24,559
below ground it's in everything what

1551
01:01:21,599 --> 01:01:27,280
causes the soil effect we don't know my

1552
01:01:24,559 --> 01:01:28,960
presumption is it's not a leoparty from

1553
01:01:27,280 --> 01:01:31,520
the above ground biomass if it's

1554
01:01:28,960 --> 01:01:34,400
standing if it falls down and that stuff

1555
01:01:31,520 --> 01:01:36,079
can leach out then yes

1556
01:01:34,400 --> 01:01:38,160
but below ground and the roots they're

1557
01:01:36,079 --> 01:01:40,480
exuding it all the time chem plants are

1558
01:01:38,160 --> 01:01:40,480
always

1559
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:45,040
conducting chemical warfare against one

1560
01:01:42,880 --> 01:01:48,000
another so this allelopathy is to keep

1561
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:50,319
other things from germinating so the

1562
01:01:48,000 --> 01:01:52,079
point is that if things are still

1563
01:01:50,319 --> 01:01:53,920
germinating and it's leaching out from

1564
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:55,839
the above ground you'll probably get

1565
01:01:53,920 --> 01:01:57,680
some suppression but if it's already

1566
01:01:55,839 --> 01:02:00,319
leached out and

1567
01:01:57,680 --> 01:02:04,520
gone then no

1568
01:02:00,319 --> 01:02:04,520
sounds like another research trial

1569
01:02:07,990 --> 01:02:11,080
