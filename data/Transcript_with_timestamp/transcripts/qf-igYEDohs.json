  "text": "well what are we fixing today today is a day we work on the tractor it's been freaking years because I've been just you know sometimes you get frustrated with things and you don't find a way out until you decide you need a way out now this trailer here I need out by the end of the uh September or so I need that and the tractor is in front of it and the tractor tire here is flat so I need to fix this so I can move this and get that we're also going to have to fix some bumper hitch stuff so more to come today we're going to work on the tire and the tire is O look at that look at that Mama Is it alive no not alive okay that's good it might be some murder hornet in here somewhere I don't know but this is a where's the size yeah size is right there 13.6 by 28 tire and a rim that goes all the way around I have to pop it off because you look around here there's some rot but if you look where is it here there's a hole and this hole has rubbed the tube so I need to push this back get the tube out replace it and then over the top of this wherever it's sharp I need to do something to make sure it's not sharp it doesn't actually have to be sealed it just has to be not sharp so that's what we're going to work on today I have tried removing the bolts and then I was thinking like okay I remove the bolts and then I take it off the rim but I'm like what in the hell I don't know you see people online beating on these with sledgehammers as hard as I can but uh I found something online it's an Amazon product so we'll see if it works it's supposed to be able to take these off the rim and I don't have to do a lot of taking off the rim kind of thing I just have to get it somewhat off the rim just the front part really so I can reach in here so it is currently jacked up or at least on jack stands and a block of wood under there so I got to raise it up some more cuz it has sunk into the ground so we're going to raise it up get this wheel so it spins use the magic tool to try to pop this out and if we get past that then we're going to start fixing it and putting it back together so let's try that all right this is the thing I bought and yes I bought it from the warehouse cuz that's where I buy almost everything I need to open it up and see what size wrench I need for this all right these are the directions they have a big caution on it I wonder what it says this is the thing all I have is a silver socket that size and have a uh impact socket I'm going to be putting an impact on it so we'll see how that goes now we got to Jack this up I jacked it up from here before this is the bucket this up again fire Jack from neighbor I'm guess say 4,000 lb this is half of it off the ground up here I'll find some other jack stands for that see the right place [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] okay Jack is loose tire is loose okay so the next step is up here I have to remove the Val stem from the tube because yeah there's a hole in the in tube but it is a slow leak and you can't have any back pressure on you when you're doing this [Music] let's start like right here so I need this there's a oldie but a probably not so goodie let's make sure this is in all the way now even there that's out of the way get this here is I'm going to pound this in I believe look good okay there are ways tighten up on this one should pull it in further see the stop then you pull on this [Music] for this I have good old trusty yep and it's a silver socker on a on a uh impact but sorry [Music] [Music] all right we're going to move it now ah that's exciting thank you Vore I know there was a pin in there I know what the pin is so on the first use I have the first failure it either sheared that pin or it just fell out oh it just fell out here it is p just fell out oh Lovely Isn't She Lovely so what happened was this pin here fell out not that it wasn't fixable but why should it be happening e [Music] [Music] oh and there it is it's off [Music] wo w [Music] oh [Music] set the ground so it's off got to go higher now [Music] okay and I looked as I was coming out I saw the hole all these chunks of were in there before here's the whole and it was this is right where that hole was and the other stuff so this kind of blistered out and just blue now how do I clean this up because there is Ain ton of in there I I'm going to have to pop the other loose I don't see a way around it so I guess let's go [Music] w [Music] oh well that was easier than the other side e one grab [Music] oh [Applause] oh [Music] [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] oh [Music] [Music] w [Music] [Music] w [Music] okay off look how much was inside there all parts of the rim that's all got to be cleaned out this has got three holes in it that's take the rest of this off and who knows I might find some more wire brush this up try to treat it paint it might be another hole under there I'm going to do all that offline and we show you what we're going to do about these CU right here is where it bolts through and two broke so as you can tell here I've given it the old Earl shy Rehabilitation I got three holes I got a little hole there I don't know if you can see it right there so I cleaned it as best as I could wash it with some solvent painted it with a brown uh rust Rusty primer painted it with a white primer and painted with orange now it's painted with orange and it's all chers you know it's got to be good that's all it needs I have then my house and got Gorilla Tape weather patch this stuff is sticky and why I'm using this is not the seal Air at all it's just to keep water from getting back and rusting this out some more as much as possible this stuff is sticky sticky right's a chunk let's use this one here [Applause] over this hole okay so we got this we got this I have to try to hold that down somehow so I think I'm just going to go find some duck tape tape the edges once the tube's in here this certainly isn't going to move I just when I put the tube in the tire in and all that I got to keep this down where it belongs well I out a battery in the phone so don't know where you left off but what I did was I put down some gorilla seal tape to make sure that the holes don't leak water back up laay down a piece of sheet aluminum and tape that down to make sure that the tube doesn't buol through and now I have to create a new pole for the valve stem to come out now we're going to get Russell on one side side of the tire [Music] [Music] ah well it's on but my foot's stuck okay on now the tube has to go on going try to stuff this in there best I can not getting it pinched W looks like I was able to stretch it around there now maybe add little air keep make sure it doesn't pinch make sure it's laying correctly okay now it's got a little bit of a shape all right hey it's onun wow that is so much not not fun all right a check locking a check this is kind of a dangerous Air truck it's got a lock on it you have to watch it [Music] check if it's on in the back it is I going he right here seeping out well I think that's it well that's going to be the end of the day it's getting late anyway uh so this has 7 and 12 lbs of air in it come back in a couple days and check it make sure it's okay uh you know if not then I got to take it all apart again fix the tube uh I found in the other side it's still full of calcium chloride so I can't really check that one to compare it so that's happening anyway thanks for watching give me a like if you think you learned something if you have any questions because I couldn't film it all really well uh let me know uh I'll tell you how I wrestled this tire on you kind of watched some of it but it was problem um take a look at what the patches look like the one on the old behind there is the other one so that Gorilla Tape is sticking out there and I'm thinking about I might put some epoxy on the top just to fill it in and protect it a little more but that's it for today uh next time we'll see what we can do about going for a tractor ride soon hey since it's should be working good uh until next time always make sure you know what tube you put in your tire bye
