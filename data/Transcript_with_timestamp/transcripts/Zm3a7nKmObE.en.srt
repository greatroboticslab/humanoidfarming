4
00:00:15,639 --> 00:00:19,320
good morning and welcome to Wholesome

5
00:00:16,840 --> 00:00:21,560
roots today I'm going to teach you how I

6
00:00:19,320 --> 00:00:24,400
poed up my tomato plants and some tips

7
00:00:21,560 --> 00:00:26,519
and tricks along the way so in my seed

8
00:00:24,400 --> 00:00:29,480
starting video I told you about how I

9
00:00:26,519 --> 00:00:32,040
start seeds and now it's time for these

10
00:00:29,480 --> 00:00:36,680
tomatoes to be potted up we start our

11
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:41,079
tomatoes in 128 cells trays that way we

12
00:00:36,680 --> 00:00:44,680
can fit a lot higher number of seedlings

13
00:00:41,079 --> 00:00:46,960
on the heat mat under the light for best

14
00:00:44,680 --> 00:00:48,800
germination so now that theyve all

15
00:00:46,960 --> 00:00:51,199
germinated and they're starting to get

16
00:00:48,800 --> 00:00:54,520
their real leaves their true leaves we

17
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:56,359
know that it is time to begin pulling

18
00:00:54,520 --> 00:00:58,519
them out of these tiny cells that dry

19
00:00:56,359 --> 00:01:01,079
out every day and move them up to the

20
00:00:58,519 --> 00:01:04,400
next stage so we're not moving up to a

21
00:01:01,079 --> 00:01:06,880
much bigger size we're using the 72 tray

22
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:08,840
size cuz a lot of these seedlings I

23
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:10,520
dropped two or three seeds in and all

24
00:01:08,840 --> 00:01:12,720
two or three seedlings germinated so

25
00:01:10,520 --> 00:01:15,640
they need to be separated out into their

26
00:01:12,720 --> 00:01:17,600
own cell so this is a little bit bigger

27
00:01:15,640 --> 00:01:20,280
won't dry out as fast and we'll give

28
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:22,520
them a chance to grow on their own so

29
00:01:20,280 --> 00:01:24,400
their Roots won't intertwine I recommend

30
00:01:22,520 --> 00:01:26,920
letting your Tomatoes get their first

31
00:01:24,400 --> 00:01:30,000
set of true leaves before you begin

32
00:01:26,920 --> 00:01:32,200
transplanting so that's where we are at

33
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:34,640
at right now and let me show you the

34
00:01:32,200 --> 00:01:37,200
difference between the seed leaves and

35
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:42,079
the true leaves so every seed that

36
00:01:37,200 --> 00:01:45,159
germinates has its own seed leaves these

37
00:01:42,079 --> 00:01:46,680
long flat leaves are seed leaves or

38
00:01:45,159 --> 00:01:49,360
otherwise known as

39
00:01:46,680 --> 00:01:51,600
calans they provide the first nutrients

40
00:01:49,360 --> 00:01:55,240
that the plant needs then as the plant

41
00:01:51,600 --> 00:01:58,840
starts to develop they get these leaves

42
00:01:55,240 --> 00:02:02,560
in the center that look more

43
00:01:58,840 --> 00:02:05,560
like tomato leaves so the first step is

44
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:07,280
to make sure that your potting soil is

45
00:02:05,560 --> 00:02:09,599
adequately moist you don't want it

46
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:12,000
soaking wet but you don't want it dry

47
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:14,160
and Dusty or you will not be able to

48
00:02:12,000 --> 00:02:16,280
moisten it at the proper level after

49
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:18,879
it's in the cells so we always do this

50
00:02:16,280 --> 00:02:20,800
before adding it to the cells and we're

51
00:02:18,879 --> 00:02:24,239
going to go ahead and fill those up and

52
00:02:20,800 --> 00:02:24,239
begin the transplant

53
00:02:31,200 --> 00:02:35,519
so there you go we've filled up we made

54
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:39,200
sure we didn't miss the corners or the

55
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:42,200
edges and then we swipe off the excess

56
00:02:39,200 --> 00:02:44,239
and then we just drop it on the table to

57
00:02:42,200 --> 00:02:47,400
Tamp it down make sure that none of them

58
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:50,680
drop down a good bit if they did we

59
00:02:47,400 --> 00:02:53,440
would top it off and that's it that's

60
00:02:50,680 --> 00:02:56,440
how you fill a tray for seeding or

61
00:02:53,440 --> 00:02:56,440
transplanting

62
00:02:56,630 --> 00:03:10,440
[Music]

63
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:12,680
so although these larger Sals allow me

64
00:03:10,440 --> 00:03:15,360
to start more seeds at once they do

65
00:03:12,680 --> 00:03:17,000
provide some hiccups we have a lot of

66
00:03:15,360 --> 00:03:18,840
drying out right there in the center of

67
00:03:17,000 --> 00:03:22,200
the tray so we're going to be real

68
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:25,480
careful with those but you can see here

69
00:03:22,200 --> 00:03:28,560
how big some of these have gotten and

70
00:03:25,480 --> 00:03:31,000
how there's multiple seeds in a

71
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:33,920
cell and and they need to be

72
00:03:31,000 --> 00:03:37,080
transplanted right away so although

73
00:03:33,920 --> 00:03:39,120
tomato plants are very strong and very

74
00:03:37,080 --> 00:03:43,120
easy to transplant you still have to be

75
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:44,760
careful with them so what we do is let's

76
00:03:43,120 --> 00:03:48,360
I'm going to go after this row that's

77
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:50,720
really thick and robust this is green

78
00:03:48,360 --> 00:03:53,360
vernisage or Veris not sure the

79
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,640
pronunciation is correct there but I'm

80
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:56,760
going to go ahead and I'm going to take

81
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:59,959
the label and I'm going to move it to

82
00:03:56,760 --> 00:04:03,400
the tray that I'm moving it to and then

83
00:03:59,959 --> 00:04:06,159
what I'm going to do is I'm going to

84
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:08,720
pinch on the bottom of that cell and you

85
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:13,239
see the soil just pops right out then

86
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:16,280
I'm going to grab right at the base

87
00:04:13,239 --> 00:04:19,440
right at the soil line making sure other

88
00:04:16,280 --> 00:04:22,079
plants aren't woven into these two and

89
00:04:19,440 --> 00:04:25,919
I'm going to pinch both at the same time

90
00:04:22,079 --> 00:04:28,440
and gently pry them up out of the soil I

91
00:04:25,919 --> 00:04:30,720
didn't water yet this morning because I

92
00:04:28,440 --> 00:04:33,600
didn't want them to be too W to make it

93
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:36,759
hard to come out so you can see we have

94
00:04:33,600 --> 00:04:38,639
two side by side all we're going to do

95
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:40,080
is again grabbing from the base you

96
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:42,160
don't want to grab from the leaves or

97
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,320
from the top of the stem because you can

98
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:46,360
crack the stem other seedlings are more

99
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:50,160
sensitive tomatoes are a little more

100
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:51,680
hearty and you just very gently pull

101
00:04:50,160 --> 00:04:54,400
them away from each

102
00:04:51,680 --> 00:04:56,280
other allowing the roots to untangle

103
00:04:54,400 --> 00:05:00,160
themselves and now you have two

104
00:04:56,280 --> 00:05:00,160
seedlings to plant

105
00:05:00,360 --> 00:05:07,080
now I so I don't lose track of what I'm

106
00:05:03,880 --> 00:05:09,080
doing usually go ahead and pull

107
00:05:07,080 --> 00:05:12,000
out every

108
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:13,800
plug of that variety and lay it on the

109
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:16,919
tray that I'm going to be planting it

110
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:20,520
into this prevents me from mixing them

111
00:05:16,919 --> 00:05:23,360
up with other varieties because we have

112
00:05:20,520 --> 00:05:24,600
over 50 different heirloom varieties we

113
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:28,000
are

114
00:05:24,600 --> 00:05:30,840
growing so I'm just taking them and

115
00:05:28,000 --> 00:05:33,680
pulling them out of the plug so I just

116
00:05:30,840 --> 00:05:35,000
pinch at the bottom of the plug Pinch at

117
00:05:33,680 --> 00:05:37,560
the bottom of the

118
00:05:35,000 --> 00:05:39,720
plant raise it up from the soil pinch

119
00:05:37,560 --> 00:05:40,880
the plug again oh I was pinching the

120
00:05:39,720 --> 00:05:43,720
wrong plug see that's why it didn't

121
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:45,840
release easy pinch

122
00:05:43,720 --> 00:05:48,520
Again

123
00:05:45,840 --> 00:05:53,080
release and lay it on the

124
00:05:48,520 --> 00:05:56,759
tray until I'm ready to get them all in

125
00:05:53,080 --> 00:05:58,680
there so something I do is I go through

126
00:05:56,759 --> 00:06:01,880
and I poke my fingers in you can use a

127
00:05:58,680 --> 00:06:04,680
pencil or poker but I just use my

128
00:06:01,880 --> 00:06:08,440
fingers and I poke every single cell

129
00:06:04,680 --> 00:06:12,440
down then when I come through I just

130
00:06:08,440 --> 00:06:14,759
drop the roots into the hole so I may

131
00:06:12,440 --> 00:06:17,319
fill up a whole tray before going back

132
00:06:14,759 --> 00:06:20,199
through and covering up those roots but

133
00:06:17,319 --> 00:06:24,000
you want to do this quickly so that the

134
00:06:20,199 --> 00:06:27,319
root don't dry out and tomatoes should

135
00:06:24,000 --> 00:06:29,840
be planted as deep as you can get them

136
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:32,280
Tomatoes will be planted all all the way

137
00:06:29,840 --> 00:06:35,319
up to the first set of leaves this whole

138
00:06:32,280 --> 00:06:37,840
area below here will root the stems root

139
00:06:35,319 --> 00:06:41,199
easily you do see that there are hairs

140
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:42,880
along the stems those are not root hairs

141
00:06:41,199 --> 00:06:44,599
I've heard that often said about

142
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:46,960
tomatoes that those hairs will turn into

143
00:06:44,599 --> 00:06:49,160
Roots but that's not actually the case

144
00:06:46,960 --> 00:06:52,039
those are tricomes which actually

145
00:06:49,160 --> 00:06:54,599
produce the essential oils that Tomatoes

146
00:06:52,039 --> 00:06:57,199
produce to repel insects from damaging

147
00:06:54,599 --> 00:06:59,280
them so they're not actually root hairs

148
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,680
but the roots will develop all along the

149
00:06:59,280 --> 00:07:11,879
step

150
00:06:59,680 --> 00:07:14,759
[Music]

151
00:07:11,879 --> 00:07:17,680
so I just pushed the root ball down into

152
00:07:14,759 --> 00:07:21,080
the bottom of the tray so that the rest

153
00:07:17,680 --> 00:07:23,360
of the stem can root oops those two got

154
00:07:21,080 --> 00:07:26,360
tangled got to watch out for

155
00:07:23,360 --> 00:07:29,199
that so I just press it down to the

156
00:07:26,360 --> 00:07:31,720
bottom layer and then I'm going to fill

157
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:35,560
up these cells the rest it

158
00:07:31,720 --> 00:07:38,199
away with soil and I'm not pressing hard

159
00:07:35,560 --> 00:07:40,440
if I press too hard I'm going to damage

160
00:07:38,199 --> 00:07:42,360
the roots and I don't want to do that so

161
00:07:40,440 --> 00:07:43,680
I'm just giving them a nice gentle shove

162
00:07:42,360 --> 00:07:46,080
and that's another reason why it's good

163
00:07:43,680 --> 00:07:48,960
to have your soil already

164
00:07:46,080 --> 00:07:51,840
moist and then I'm just coming back

165
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:56,759
through and covering up that root

166
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:58,280
ball and when I water this tray in I'm

167
00:07:56,759 --> 00:08:02,520
going to make

168
00:07:58,280 --> 00:08:03,240
sure that that I look for any Pockets

169
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:05,919
that

170
00:08:03,240 --> 00:08:09,759
developed and refill any soil that

171
00:08:05,919 --> 00:08:12,240
loosened up so some of you may have

172
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:13,960
noticed that I just buried some leaves

173
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:16,960
that is not

174
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:20,199
intentional that is the result of trying

175
00:08:16,960 --> 00:08:21,360
to film with one hand and demonstrate

176
00:08:20,199 --> 00:08:25,319
with the

177
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:27,000
other I don't have a uh cameraman like

178
00:08:25,319 --> 00:08:31,520
some YouTubers

179
00:08:27,000 --> 00:08:34,240
do it's just me doing the best I can so

180
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:35,680
then I go back and I try to Center them

181
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,080
and kind of Tuck the

182
00:08:35,680 --> 00:08:42,399
soil around them to make them a little

183
00:08:38,080 --> 00:08:44,959
bit more centered in the center of the

184
00:08:42,399 --> 00:08:48,080
pot so that the roots can have as much

185
00:08:44,959 --> 00:08:50,440
room as they need to expand in that

186
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:52,600
cell this is the same way you would do

187
00:08:50,440 --> 00:08:56,040
it if you were planting it into a pot

188
00:08:52,600 --> 00:08:58,839
just picture it on a larger scale I

189
00:08:56,040 --> 00:09:00,839
probably will not get to the pot stage

190
00:08:58,839 --> 00:09:02,480
as we will will be probably

191
00:09:00,839 --> 00:09:04,839
transplanting these straight into the

192
00:09:02,480 --> 00:09:07,600
garden once they have recovered for a

193
00:09:04,839 --> 00:09:09,560
couple of weeks and our frost date has

194
00:09:07,600 --> 00:09:12,120
passed all right and then when you get

195
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:14,440
to your next variety which is pink

196
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:17,279
bernis you just do the same thing you

197
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:19,720
set your marker there and you begin your

198
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:22,600
row going that way and you just continue

199
00:09:19,720 --> 00:09:25,360
on changing your marker when you get to

200
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:28,360
a new variety works out pretty well this

201
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:31,120
way so once you have them in the tray

202
00:09:28,360 --> 00:09:33,240
you just water them in really really

203
00:09:31,120 --> 00:09:36,279
well I'm going to drench them really

204
00:09:33,240 --> 00:09:40,399
good this first watering while they

205
00:09:36,279 --> 00:09:43,200
fight through the Battle of uh coming

206
00:09:40,399 --> 00:09:46,440
back to life if they have any transplant

207
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:48,399
shock having them good in moisturiz will

208
00:09:46,440 --> 00:09:50,440
help with

209
00:09:48,399 --> 00:09:52,480
that make sure you don't miss the

210
00:09:50,440 --> 00:09:54,279
corners and the edges those tend to be

211
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:56,640
the ones that dry out the

212
00:09:54,279 --> 00:09:59,440
easiest or if you're using a heat mat in

213
00:09:56,640 --> 00:10:04,440
the center I have turned my heat mat off

214
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:04,440
now due to that drying out pattern I was

215
00:10:07,560 --> 00:10:13,800
seeing this my

216
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:19,120
friends is what

217
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:21,160
540 tomato seedlings looks like after

218
00:10:19,120 --> 00:10:23,079
transplanting they are bouncing back

219
00:10:21,160 --> 00:10:24,839
pretty well the first day I'm keeping

220
00:10:23,079 --> 00:10:28,279
them right inside the door with just

221
00:10:24,839 --> 00:10:30,880
enough light to keep them from going

222
00:10:28,279 --> 00:10:33,079
crazy without the light

223
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:34,920
look at that they're so they're standing

224
00:10:33,079 --> 00:10:39,519
up so well already that was the first

225
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:42,680
tray I did so they are bouncing back

226
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:46,240
going to give them a day or two in here

227
00:10:42,680 --> 00:10:50,240
where I can monitor them um I may set

228
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:53,560
them out here in my hardening off

229
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:53,560
area and

230
00:10:53,600 --> 00:11:00,200
then I move them to the

231
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:03,760
greenhouse it may not be big but it is

232
00:11:00,200 --> 00:11:06,480
sure useful and helpful for us so when

233
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:08,720
potting up tomato seedlings it's

234
00:11:06,480 --> 00:11:10,440
important to remember that these are one

235
00:11:08,720 --> 00:11:12,839
of the hardiest seedlings you're going

236
00:11:10,440 --> 00:11:15,120
to transplant other things might be a

237
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:17,920
bit more fragile but tomato seedlings

238
00:11:15,120 --> 00:11:20,240
usually bounce back within 3 days after

239
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,920
transplanting when you transplant a

240
00:11:20,240 --> 00:11:24,000
tomato seedling you should keep it in

241
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:26,839
the same conditions it was in for a good

242
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:29,279
2 or 3 days after transplanting and make

243
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:31,560
sure that that first initial shock has

244
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:34,000
TN off before you move them to a new

245
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:35,760
location we are going to be careful and

246
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,600
keep them here in the growroom and then

247
00:11:35,760 --> 00:11:38,279
they're going to go out to the

248
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:40,959
greenhouse after that it's also

249
00:11:38,279 --> 00:11:43,839
important that you do not fertilize

250
00:11:40,959 --> 00:11:46,920
right away after transplanting a plant

251
00:11:43,839 --> 00:11:50,399
has to reestablish its root zones and

252
00:11:46,920 --> 00:11:52,920
start to develop new Roots before you

253
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:54,760
give them any fertilizer they're not

254
00:11:52,920 --> 00:11:56,519
going to be able to use the fertilizer

255
00:11:54,760 --> 00:11:59,880
during this stage and it could cause

256
00:11:56,519 --> 00:12:02,440
more harm than good so remember these

257
00:11:59,880 --> 00:12:05,720
tips and tricks you have to have moist

258
00:12:02,440 --> 00:12:08,880
soil before you begin transplanting and

259
00:12:05,720 --> 00:12:11,360
you should always bury your Tomatoes

260
00:12:08,880 --> 00:12:14,440
deeper than they were originally that

261
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:16,720
helps them produce more Roots along the

262
00:12:14,440 --> 00:12:18,519
stem not along the tric Combs remember

263
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:23,320
tric Combs are for essential

264
00:12:18,519 --> 00:12:25,600
oils and then you have to make sure that

265
00:12:23,320 --> 00:12:28,360
you water them in really good after

266
00:12:25,600 --> 00:12:32,440
transplanting I usually pretty much soak

267
00:12:28,360 --> 00:12:34,440
them and that then I let them dry out as

268
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:36,880
they're starting to not dry out all the

269
00:12:34,440 --> 00:12:38,600
way but just dry out enough that they're

270
00:12:36,880 --> 00:12:42,760
not too wet where there's going to be a

271
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:45,519
fungus issue then you wait a good 2 or 3

272
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:49,079
days before moving them anywhere else if

273
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:51,720
you're in a Zone where it's time to

274
00:12:49,079 --> 00:12:53,639
plant your Tomatoes outside remember to

275
00:12:51,720 --> 00:12:55,480
harden them off for a good week or two

276
00:12:53,639 --> 00:12:57,560
before you plant them in the ground I

277
00:12:55,480 --> 00:13:00,279
have a great video on hardening off

278
00:12:57,560 --> 00:13:02,160
plants that you can find on my beginning

279
00:13:00,279 --> 00:13:04,320
Garden series

280
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:06,399
playlist after you have hardened them

281
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:08,440
off for 2 weeks and there's no chance of

282
00:13:06,399 --> 00:13:11,320
frost it's time to plant them in the

283
00:13:08,440 --> 00:13:13,760
ground I can't wait mine are a few weeks

284
00:13:11,320 --> 00:13:15,920
behind for my zone so I will be planting

285
00:13:13,760 --> 00:13:18,160
mine later than I normally do but

286
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:20,600
they're still going to catch up and grow

287
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:22,880
beautiful tomatoes in no time at all

288
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:25,480
Tomatoes can be planted as late as July

289
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:29,839
where I live here in Georgia in zone 8

290
00:13:25,480 --> 00:13:31,920
so we feel completely confident that we

291
00:13:29,839 --> 00:13:34,880
are just right on time even if we're not

292
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:36,600
on the exact calendar we planned on I

293
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,920
hope these tips and tricks on planting

294
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:41,000
tomatoes seedlings and potting them up
