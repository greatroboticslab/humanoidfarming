00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:04,640
Did you know you can grow peanuts from

2
00:00:01,760 --> 00:00:07,520
grocery store nuts? Here's the lazy way

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:10,240
to grow a snack factory. Use raw

4
00:00:07,520 --> 00:00:11,800
peanuts, not roasted. Soak them

5
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:14,480
overnight to boost

6
00:00:11,800 --> 00:00:15,800
germination. Plant in sandy soil. They

7
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:19,600
need room to grow

8
00:00:15,800 --> 00:00:22,560
underground. Space 6 in apart. They love

9
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:25,680
full sun and warm weather. Water when

10
00:00:22,560 --> 00:00:27,599
soil feels dry 1 in down. Watch for

11
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:30,240
yellow flowers. They'll bend down and

12
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:33,520
dig into soil to form peanuts.

13
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:39,280
In four to 5 months, fresh peanuts ready

14
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:39,280
to roast or boil. Save for planting day.
