1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:04,600
it might look like everyone knows how to

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:06,759
start maze farming in Ghana okay but

3
00:00:04,600 --> 00:00:08,719
don't fall into that drop did you know

4
00:00:06,759 --> 00:00:11,120
that Ghana has the worst yield of maze

5
00:00:08,719 --> 00:00:13,880
in the whole world not too Pleasant to

6
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:16,520
accept but that is the fact Ghana has an

7
00:00:13,880 --> 00:00:18,359
average yield of 1.7 metric tons per

8
00:00:16,520 --> 00:00:21,279
hectare compared to other countries on

9
00:00:18,359 --> 00:00:23,480
this same continent getting about 6 to 7

10
00:00:21,279 --> 00:00:25,199
metric tons per hect amidst of that

11
00:00:23,480 --> 00:00:27,199
though it's actually possible to become

12
00:00:25,199 --> 00:00:29,240
rich with maze farming business in Ghana

13
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:30,439
if you do things right people in Ghana

14
00:00:29,240 --> 00:00:33,200
following these Tech techniques are

15
00:00:30,439 --> 00:00:35,520
making over 22,000 GH cities of

16
00:00:33,200 --> 00:00:37,120
consistent profit from their two AC maze

17
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:39,760
farm and I will teach you how to start

18
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:42,200
yours today and get similar Ys also do

19
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:44,280
you know why right now is the best time

20
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:45,960
to start me farming well field

21
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:48,160
experiments were conducted to determine

22
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:50,160
the optimum time for planting maze in

23
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:52,600
the various ecological zones and seasons

24
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:54,719
of Ghana in order to achieve the best Ys

25
00:00:52,600 --> 00:00:57,079
it turns out made match and made

26
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:59,519
planting give the best yield guys the

27
00:00:57,079 --> 00:01:02,120
best time is almost passing and that is

28
00:00:59,519 --> 00:01:04,479
why I making this video right now in

29
00:01:02,120 --> 00:01:06,920
Ghana maze is cultivated during two main

30
00:01:04,479 --> 00:01:09,200
growing Seasons from January to May and

31
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:11,280
from June to late September it is found

32
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:13,479
that every September October and

33
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:16,040
February March demand for Maze goes

34
00:01:13,479 --> 00:01:18,560
extremely high and that is when farmers

35
00:01:16,040 --> 00:01:21,240
can potentially make huge money out of

36
00:01:18,560 --> 00:01:23,600
their maze farm this is obvious because

37
00:01:21,240 --> 00:01:25,439
during these periods maze is not grown

38
00:01:23,600 --> 00:01:27,079
due to the climate and at the end of

39
00:01:25,439 --> 00:01:28,920
this video I will show you how to use

40
00:01:27,079 --> 00:01:30,759
this to your advantage and double your

41
00:01:28,920 --> 00:01:32,399
revenue from your maze farm so now that

42
00:01:30,759 --> 00:01:34,320
you know this is the best time to start

43
00:01:32,399 --> 00:01:36,280
let's go ahead and talk about the best

44
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:39,040
practices on how to start your maze farm

45
00:01:36,280 --> 00:01:41,200
and get the most out of it step by step

46
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:43,600
for the marketing aspect I'll share my

47
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:46,079
top four secret in selling my maze with

48
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:48,280
E and get the optimum prices at the end

49
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:50,399
of this video so smash that subscribe

50
00:01:48,280 --> 00:01:52,640
button and let's dive in the first step

51
00:01:50,399 --> 00:01:54,560
in maze farming in general is to acquire

52
00:01:52,640 --> 00:01:56,520
the best piece of land for your maze

53
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:58,320
cultivation how large the size of land

54
00:01:56,520 --> 00:02:00,119
should be depends on you but I recommend

55
00:01:58,320 --> 00:02:02,320
getting a large piece of land if you

56
00:02:00,119 --> 00:02:04,240
really mean business however if you only

57
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:06,680
have a small piece of land it shouldn't

58
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:09,319
stop you from doing something preferably

59
00:02:06,680 --> 00:02:11,920
get a deep Bine structured well erated

60
00:02:09,319 --> 00:02:14,160
well drained Lomi soil type of land that

61
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:17,239
are rich in organic matter this is

62
00:02:14,160 --> 00:02:20,120
proven to give the highest yeld R

63
00:02:17,239 --> 00:02:21,800
plantations okay choosing the land isn't

64
00:02:20,120 --> 00:02:23,879
difficult at all once you have settled

65
00:02:21,800 --> 00:02:25,800
on the land it's time to start preparing

66
00:02:23,879 --> 00:02:27,800
the land for cultivation one mistake

67
00:02:25,800 --> 00:02:29,560
people keep doing in their Farms is they

68
00:02:27,800 --> 00:02:32,519
jump straight to planting whatever they

69
00:02:29,560 --> 00:02:34,519
want to plant without preparing the soil

70
00:02:32,519 --> 00:02:36,319
first the well-being of your crops

71
00:02:34,519 --> 00:02:38,120
largely depends on the conditions under

72
00:02:36,319 --> 00:02:39,760
which they are cultivated taking one to

73
00:02:38,120 --> 00:02:42,239
two weeks to prepare the soil before

74
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:45,080
planting will go a long way to improve

75
00:02:42,239 --> 00:02:47,200
the Y and health of your crops but how

76
00:02:45,080 --> 00:02:49,120
do you actually prepare the soil it is

77
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,959
actually simple remember I mentioned the

78
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:53,200
recommended soil requirement for Maze

79
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:55,800
earlier a deep fine structured well

80
00:02:53,200 --> 00:02:57,519
erated well drained Lomi soil by soil

81
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:59,959
preparation this is what you want to

82
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:02,440
achieve start by tilling or plowing the

83
00:02:59,959 --> 00:03:04,879
soil this makes the soil lose and become

84
00:03:02,440 --> 00:03:06,920
fine structured well erated and well

85
00:03:04,879 --> 00:03:09,200
drained this ensures better growth and

86
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:11,599
development of the seed into a mature

87
00:03:09,200 --> 00:03:13,480
plant if it is not raining often during

88
00:03:11,599 --> 00:03:15,519
the time of cultivation you should

89
00:03:13,480 --> 00:03:17,599
probably consider irrigating the soil

90
00:03:15,519 --> 00:03:20,080
for about 1 to 2 weeks before sewing the

91
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:21,920
seeds remember regardless of the soil

92
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:24,480
type and the land you secure for your

93
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:26,720
business it should go through these same

94
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:28,200
preparation stages once this is done you

95
00:03:26,720 --> 00:03:29,959
should go ahead and choose your

96
00:03:28,200 --> 00:03:31,720
preferred type of seed there are two

97
00:03:29,959 --> 00:03:33,959
main type of seeds that are grown in

98
00:03:31,720 --> 00:03:36,439
Ghana the hybrid or the yellow corn and

99
00:03:33,959 --> 00:03:38,560
the local seed or opv now if you mean

100
00:03:36,439 --> 00:03:40,799
business then I recommend the hybrid

101
00:03:38,560 --> 00:03:42,599
seats mainly because it has proven to

102
00:03:40,799 --> 00:03:44,640
give the highest yield in Ghana and it

103
00:03:42,599 --> 00:03:46,599
is drought resistant also which means

104
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,480
that it can still thrive in the midst of

105
00:03:46,599 --> 00:03:51,319
our weird and unpredicted weather the

106
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:53,000
hybrid cost around 300 to 500 cities per

107
00:03:51,319 --> 00:03:54,519
acre depending on where you find

108
00:03:53,000 --> 00:03:56,439
yourself within the country if you are

109
00:03:54,519 --> 00:03:58,799
going with a hybrid seat though you

110
00:03:56,439 --> 00:04:00,879
should never recycle the seats and new

111
00:03:58,799 --> 00:04:02,439
seats should be contained each year the

112
00:04:00,879 --> 00:04:04,560
reason is that these seeds are

113
00:04:02,439 --> 00:04:06,959
manufactured such that after you

114
00:04:04,560 --> 00:04:09,159
cultivate and harvest you can't grow the

115
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:11,480
seeds again if you do it's either the

116
00:04:09,159 --> 00:04:13,640
seeds will rot in the soil or will

117
00:04:11,480 --> 00:04:16,120
germinate but cannot grow well you need

118
00:04:13,640 --> 00:04:18,040
to buy new seeds every year and once

119
00:04:16,120 --> 00:04:20,359
your seeds are ready and your land is

120
00:04:18,040 --> 00:04:22,400
prepared let's go ahead and learn how to

121
00:04:20,359 --> 00:04:24,720
sew the seeds in order to get the best

122
00:04:22,400 --> 00:04:28,000
yield plant your seeds at a depth of

123
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:30,000
about 1.5 to 2 in in the soil now

124
00:04:28,000 --> 00:04:32,840
optimal density varies but it is is

125
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:35,560
generally recommended to plant 18,000 to

126
00:04:32,840 --> 00:04:37,800
30,000 plants per acre depending on the

127
00:04:35,560 --> 00:04:40,080
specific maze variety maze is a warm

128
00:04:37,800 --> 00:04:42,520
season crop plant seeds when the soil

129
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:44,280
temperature reaches at least 50° f for

130
00:04:42,520 --> 00:04:48,680
proper germination the best temperature

131
00:04:44,280 --> 00:04:50,840
for germination is 75° F or 24° C

132
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:53,080
population of maze plants on a piece of

133
00:04:50,840 --> 00:04:55,400
land is also an important determiner of

134
00:04:53,080 --> 00:04:58,080
the plant Health adequate Road spacing

135
00:04:55,400 --> 00:05:00,120
is essential for proper air circulation

136
00:04:58,080 --> 00:05:03,400
and sunlight exposure the recommended

137
00:05:00,120 --> 00:05:04,919
spacing is typically between 30 to 40 in

138
00:05:03,400 --> 00:05:07,199
now let's talk about one of the most

139
00:05:04,919 --> 00:05:09,440
essential aspects of me farming that you

140
00:05:07,199 --> 00:05:11,800
should probably know if you want to make

141
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:14,440
a difference you can't succeed in maze

142
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:16,840
farming business today if you don't know

143
00:05:14,440 --> 00:05:18,840
about effective weed and Pest Control

144
00:05:16,840 --> 00:05:21,000
techniques the fall army worm is your

145
00:05:18,840 --> 00:05:23,960
greatest enemy in maze farming business

146
00:05:21,000 --> 00:05:26,759
this pest can cause you a loss of more

147
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:28,880
than 50% in your business from studies

148
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:32,120
the estimated mean National yield loss

149
00:05:28,880 --> 00:05:35,759
due to fall worm in Ghana was over

150
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:40,319
470,000 tons in 2018 with a monetary

151
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:42,759
value of over 1.7 million us fori is a

152
00:05:40,319 --> 00:05:44,960
poly fagos and highly mobile migratory

153
00:05:42,759 --> 00:05:47,560
insect pest which was first detected in

154
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:49,400
West Africa in early 2016 since its

155
00:05:47,560 --> 00:05:51,720
introduction this insect has

156
00:05:49,400 --> 00:05:53,960
significantly impacted livelihoods of

157
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:55,880
small scale Farmers across the continent

158
00:05:53,960 --> 00:05:58,360
and in Ghana in particular you can

159
00:05:55,880 --> 00:06:01,080
actually plant like 10 acres of land in

160
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:02,919
Ghana and get just half of it at the end

161
00:06:01,080 --> 00:06:05,360
because of these Devils it is possible

162
00:06:02,919 --> 00:06:07,039
to control them but expensive here is

163
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,280
how you do it after 4 weeks of

164
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:11,120
germination start visiting your F

165
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:13,199
frequently and look for signs of

166
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:15,599
infestation this ensures that you detect

167
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:18,080
it early as it is key in preventing

168
00:06:15,599 --> 00:06:20,680
excessive loss once you see few plant

169
00:06:18,080 --> 00:06:22,680
infested there are three classes of

170
00:06:20,680 --> 00:06:24,919
pesticides that are proven to be very

171
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:27,319
effective against fall am the first

172
00:06:24,919 --> 00:06:30,120
group is the spinos signs this class of

173
00:06:27,319 --> 00:06:33,000
insecticide work by disrupting the tinic

174
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:35,160
acolin receptors of the insect's nervous

175
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:37,280
system this mechanism of action makes

176
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:39,199
this class of insecticide very selective

177
00:06:37,280 --> 00:06:41,360
in destroying the target insect and

178
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:44,639
leaving the beneficial Predators this is

179
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:46,680
very helpful as it doesn't kill all the

180
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:49,240
microorganisms in the soil as part of

181
00:06:46,680 --> 00:06:51,599
the target insect phos science does not

182
00:06:49,240 --> 00:06:53,840
destroy only mature insects but also

183
00:06:51,599 --> 00:06:57,800
their lava and eggs some examples of

184
00:06:53,840 --> 00:07:01,080
spinos sign insecticides are entrust and

185
00:06:57,800 --> 00:07:03,240
success new we also have the tin Ben it

186
00:07:01,080 --> 00:07:05,280
works by penetrating the leaf tissues

187
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:07,759
and forming Reservoir within treated

188
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:09,919
leaves which provide residual activity

189
00:07:07,759 --> 00:07:12,479
against past that ingest the plant

190
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:15,800
substance when feeding example of imin

191
00:07:12,479 --> 00:07:18,479
Benz you can use to control for L are

192
00:07:15,800 --> 00:07:20,919
affirm and proclaim the last class of

193
00:07:18,479 --> 00:07:23,599
insecticide I personally find effective

194
00:07:20,919 --> 00:07:26,560
against foram worm is the fantron Pro

195
00:07:23,599 --> 00:07:28,759
Group chanton Pro binds to a specific

196
00:07:26,560 --> 00:07:30,919
receptor in the muscles called the

197
00:07:28,759 --> 00:07:33,080
ryanodine receptor when the chemical

198
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:35,520
binds to this receptor it causes muszle

199
00:07:33,080 --> 00:07:38,440
cells to leak calcium the musles stop

200
00:07:35,520 --> 00:07:41,080
working normally the insect is paralyzed

201
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:43,599
and dies some examples of this group are

202
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:45,879
alore and coragen once you have your

203
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:48,199
insecticide figured out spray your farm

204
00:07:45,879 --> 00:07:50,240
at least once in 3 weeks depending on

205
00:07:48,199 --> 00:07:52,680
the particular insecticide you get this

206
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:55,199
is essential because for Lami worm is

207
00:07:52,680 --> 00:07:56,919
very persistent and migrates so quickly

208
00:07:55,199 --> 00:07:59,199
from Farm to farm for instance if you

209
00:07:56,919 --> 00:08:02,360
treat your farm and there is a nearby

210
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:04,520
Farm that is infested to well expect to

211
00:08:02,360 --> 00:08:06,560
see your farm infested again as soon as

212
00:08:04,520 --> 00:08:08,639
the chemical loses its power this is why

213
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:11,400
you need to keep treating the farm until

214
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:13,720
the plant start to Silk at this stage if

215
00:08:11,400 --> 00:08:15,720
your farm isn't heavily infested already

216
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:17,560
the plant will be healthy until you

217
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:20,319
harvest even without additional

218
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:22,400
treatments maze takes about 12 to 16

219
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,879
weeks to reach maturity as you may need

220
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:27,240
to spray the farm at least three times

221
00:08:24,879 --> 00:08:29,720
in 3 weeks interval depending on how

222
00:08:27,240 --> 00:08:31,639
persistent your farm gets infested no

223
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:34,080
that I am unable to recommend any dosage

224
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:36,320
of the chemical since I do not know what

225
00:08:34,080 --> 00:08:38,599
specific agrochemical you get I advise

226
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:41,080
that you use it as prescribed by the

227
00:08:38,599 --> 00:08:43,360
chemist at the shop you buy it now with

228
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:46,080
weed control if your farm can be weeded

229
00:08:43,360 --> 00:08:47,839
manually it is perfect as you would not

230
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:50,320
need to worry about the effect of

231
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:51,920
herbicides on your farm however if

232
00:08:50,320 --> 00:08:53,760
that's not possible depending on the

233
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:56,120
size of your farm you may still have

234
00:08:53,760 --> 00:08:57,959
options like post emerence herbicides

235
00:08:56,120 --> 00:09:00,480
the last thing you would want to do is

236
00:08:57,959 --> 00:09:03,399
to sew your seats let let it germinate

237
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:06,320
and ignore it to stay in the bushes maze

238
00:09:03,399 --> 00:09:08,640
hate weeds as it suppresses its growth

239
00:09:06,320 --> 00:09:11,120
and health weeds in your farm will also

240
00:09:08,640 --> 00:09:13,600
bring in several pests to make sure that

241
00:09:11,120 --> 00:09:16,000
your hard work is roomed so where your

242
00:09:13,600 --> 00:09:18,200
options if labor cost for weeding will

243
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:20,600
be too much in your situation consider

244
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:22,600
using a preemergence herbicides on the

245
00:09:20,600 --> 00:09:24,720
piece of land before sewing your seeds

246
00:09:22,600 --> 00:09:26,680
to prevent germinated weed seedlings

247
00:09:24,720 --> 00:09:29,440
from becoming established also consider

248
00:09:26,680 --> 00:09:31,160
using post Emer cze to control weed in

249
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:32,680
your farm after they have already

250
00:09:31,160 --> 00:09:34,839
emerged from the soil there are

251
00:09:32,680 --> 00:09:37,680
postemergence herbicides specifically

252
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:40,000
made for Maze and other narrow Le crops

253
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:43,000
designed to Target and Destroy both

254
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:45,360
grasses and broadlea weeds leaving all n

255
00:09:43,000 --> 00:09:49,800
Le plant healthy some examples of these

256
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:52,000
abdes are Nico gold Amin spray and Mason

257
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:54,120
now if you followed up till now and

258
00:09:52,000 --> 00:09:57,120
going to implement what you've learned

259
00:09:54,120 --> 00:09:59,399
so far I am confident that you are 80%

260
00:09:57,120 --> 00:10:01,279
more likely to succeed in this business

261
00:09:59,399 --> 00:10:03,200
the last step I will talk about before

262
00:10:01,279 --> 00:10:05,440
diving into the business aspect is

263
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:08,000
fertilization as more and more plants

264
00:10:05,440 --> 00:10:10,600
and crops or even weeds grow on a piece

265
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:13,079
of land the soil gradually loses its

266
00:10:10,600 --> 00:10:15,800
nutrients for example for every ton of

267
00:10:13,079 --> 00:10:20,120
whole plant corn Harvest we remove from

268
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:23,600
the soil about 25 kg of nitrogen 5 kg of

269
00:10:20,120 --> 00:10:26,079
phosphorus and 20 kg of potassium that

270
00:10:23,600 --> 00:10:29,000
means if you want to regrow maze or

271
00:10:26,079 --> 00:10:31,440
anything on that land the coming years

272
00:10:29,000 --> 00:10:33,320
you would need to replace these lost

273
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:35,279
nutrients in order to have a

274
00:10:33,320 --> 00:10:37,480
satisfactory corn yield for the years to

275
00:10:35,279 --> 00:10:41,120
come as a rule of thumb you may need to

276
00:10:37,480 --> 00:10:45,839
supplement about 100 kg of nitrogen 280

277
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:48,240
kg of phosphorus and 100 kg of potasium

278
00:10:45,839 --> 00:10:49,920
per hectar in order to achieve this

279
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:51,480
however it's very important to

280
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,839
understand which nutrients is necessary

281
00:10:51,480 --> 00:10:55,800
for the plant growth and at which stage

282
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:58,360
otherwise if you apply a nutrient at the

283
00:10:55,800 --> 00:11:00,240
wrong time you may har your CR instead

284
00:10:58,360 --> 00:11:02,200
the two main fertilizers strategies you

285
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:04,320
may want to consider for your maze Farm

286
00:11:02,200 --> 00:11:05,959
are the basal fertilization and folar

287
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,079
fertilization basil application

288
00:11:05,959 --> 00:11:10,600
fertilizers are applied near the base of

289
00:11:08,079 --> 00:11:13,120
the sewn seed usually one day before or

290
00:11:10,600 --> 00:11:15,360
after sewing for Maze the most important

291
00:11:13,120 --> 00:11:17,560
nutrients necessary at this early stage

292
00:11:15,360 --> 00:11:19,800
is phosphorus therefore you may need to

293
00:11:17,560 --> 00:11:22,720
apply fertilizers with large amount of

294
00:11:19,800 --> 00:11:25,120
phosphorus and a little of both nitrogen

295
00:11:22,720 --> 00:11:27,160
and potach get for example a fertilizer

296
00:11:25,120 --> 00:11:30,800
with NPK value of

297
00:11:27,160 --> 00:11:33,639
535 and varry about 5 to 10 G of this

298
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:35,839
fertilizer 2 in below and 2 in beside

299
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:37,920
each hole containing two seeds after

300
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:39,920
this the next fertilization will be at

301
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:42,000
the stem elongation stage this stage

302
00:11:39,920 --> 00:11:44,200
begins about 5 to 6 weeks after

303
00:11:42,000 --> 00:11:45,959
germination this corn grow stage can

304
00:11:44,200 --> 00:11:48,279
predict the number of grains that will

305
00:11:45,959 --> 00:11:50,639
develop in each given cup grow at this

306
00:11:48,279 --> 00:11:53,320
stage of the plant grow corn needs the

307
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:55,200
most nitrogen along with plenty of water

308
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:57,600
and other nutrients it is therefore

309
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:59,760
important to this time apply a

310
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,279
fertilizer with a higher n nitrogen

311
00:11:59,760 --> 00:12:03,639
content for example one with NPK value

312
00:12:02,279 --> 00:12:06,680
of

313
00:12:03,639 --> 00:12:08,720
355 now note that this is not the only

314
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:11,079
way to go about it you may have other

315
00:12:08,720 --> 00:12:12,800
ways you have done this and would love

316
00:12:11,079 --> 00:12:14,680
to know about it in the comment section

317
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:17,199
what have taught you so far has proven

318
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:19,399
to be effective and has been replicated

319
00:12:17,199 --> 00:12:21,680
by many farmers across the country I am

320
00:12:19,399 --> 00:12:24,560
confident it will give you same result

321
00:12:21,680 --> 00:12:26,440
if you follow it carefully now the sales

322
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:29,600
or the marketing aspect the first

323
00:12:26,440 --> 00:12:32,360
question to ask is how is M used in GH

324
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:34,800
research says that Ghana's M production

325
00:12:32,360 --> 00:12:37,320
mainly goes into livestock feed and

326
00:12:34,800 --> 00:12:39,360
household consumption with this in mind

327
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:42,320
here are the four most effective ways to

328
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:44,160
sell your maze with ease but before that

329
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:46,360
if you have gained value in this video

330
00:12:44,160 --> 00:12:48,680
so far would you please help me by

331
00:12:46,360 --> 00:12:50,760
subscribing to the channel right now

332
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:53,079
okay thank you for doing that number one

333
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:55,800
is food processes have you thought about

334
00:12:53,079 --> 00:12:58,199
the fact that almost every Chop Bar and

335
00:12:55,800 --> 00:13:00,320
restaurant across all the regions in

336
00:12:58,199 --> 00:13:02,800
Ghana procur some amount of maze for

337
00:13:00,320 --> 00:13:04,880
their daily operations the only thing it

338
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:07,639
takes to start working with these

339
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:09,800
business entities is reaching an agreed

340
00:13:07,639 --> 00:13:11,600
price that works for both of you if you

341
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:13,639
able to reach a better deal with them

342
00:13:11,600 --> 00:13:15,880
they will definitely turn their backs on

343
00:13:13,639 --> 00:13:17,519
all previous suppliers and start working

344
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:19,920
with you this doesn't necessarily mean

345
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,880
settling for low prices however

346
00:13:19,920 --> 00:13:24,199
compromising a little in your price and

347
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:26,680
getting huge amount of sales will still

348
00:13:24,199 --> 00:13:28,880
bring that cash you want in your pocket

349
00:13:26,680 --> 00:13:31,880
the second way to sell your maze in

350
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:34,120
Ghana is through local markets local

351
00:13:31,880 --> 00:13:35,920
markets and retail shops are another

352
00:13:34,120 --> 00:13:38,079
great way to get your maze into the

353
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:40,440
market these are the places people T to

354
00:13:38,079 --> 00:13:42,399
when they need home staff and food staff

355
00:13:40,440 --> 00:13:45,519
urgently that is a good opportunity to

356
00:13:42,399 --> 00:13:48,040
showcase your produce to a lot of people

357
00:13:45,519 --> 00:13:50,720
who can potentially be customers that is

358
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:53,560
as simple as that the third one though

359
00:13:50,720 --> 00:13:56,320
is livestock feed males as I mentioned

360
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:58,560
earlier livestock feed is one major area

361
00:13:56,320 --> 00:14:01,120
the Ghan maze go into you should start

362
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:03,079
by researching in your area or even

363
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:05,639
other localities you can transport your

364
00:14:03,079 --> 00:14:07,800
ma to for livestock feed males and Petry

365
00:14:05,639 --> 00:14:10,839
feed males there are several of them in

366
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:13,959
Kumasi such as ASV Agro limited Boris

367
00:14:10,839 --> 00:14:16,519
Farm Supplies Pria poultry and more a

368
00:14:13,959 --> 00:14:19,079
lot also in Acra such as aquaba feeds
