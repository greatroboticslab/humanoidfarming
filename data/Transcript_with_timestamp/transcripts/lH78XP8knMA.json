Farmers that are not doing this right and that's why we are heing to help everyone out there aspiring on those that have started to make Corrections so that we can all have uh good profits on our pig farm now uh one of the main issue that has led to um people getting into Pig farming and getting discouraged later on is uh the media Narrative of Pak farming you know a lot of people watch uh lots of videos online that talks about uh the success story around Peak farming but very few of those videos addresses the challenges faced in Peak farming so several people uh in the joy of and in the enthusiasm of uh getting into business and making great profits they launch into Peak farming without uh trying to first of all understand that Pak farming also has it challenges but of course with every every business has it challenges and uh just like every other business all these challenges are solvable so and that's one of the reasons why this video is help is going is help for everyone to watch so that you can have the right mindset uh as you are about to get into Pak farming and if you are in it already you can adjust on certain things you need to adjust on so that we can all have good profit on our farm now uh if new to this Channel please uh quickly uh click the Subscribe button we'll be bringing to you lot of great videos on Peak farming for you to understand the A to Z of

into sections and as you have seen in our previous videos we have been trying to explain certain things around uh how to treat this how to treat that some certain challenges you may face and how you

discuss the right mindset you need to have for you to succeed in Peak farming I'll be talking to you about 10 different mindsets I want every beginner every uh intending Peak farmer every ASP uh aspiring Peak farmer to know before delving or thinking about getting into big farming 10 different mindsets 10 different mindset I want you to have yes so number one number one uh is I want every P aspiring pig farmer to ask himself a very important question and the question is are you really ready for this are you ready for Peak farming uh do you feel Peak farming is meant for you because because just like you may have understood about life generally not everything is meant for everyone there are certain things that some people are meant to do some other people are not meant to do so you need to ask yourself are you ready for this that is this aspect of business is this aspect of Agriculture meant for you are you able to handle these challenges is it something you are passionate about is it something you will give everything to you will put in your best or is it something you just feel like uh experimenting on so you need to understand that everything in life and pig farming is not an exception it all requires extreme passion you have to be passionate about what you do you have to put in 100% 100% into it so it's not going to be don't feel it's going to be a cake walk where you just uh leave your pigs in a pen and uh voila that's it and uh the money keeps rolling in it's not like that there are lot of intri cases that you have to understand about Pig farming that you have have to uh be prepared for before you get into it so that you don't have heart breaks so please the first question the first mindset you have to ask yourself while you're watching lots of videos on how much money they made from p and everything is to ask yourself are you ready for this is it meant for you is it something you are meant to do so that's number one mindset number two is what's your business plan you have to have a business plan I think I've told you I've been saying this in some um previous videos I've been to certain fans and uh honestly if those were the if those are the people you look up to you would not want to get into big fing because uh they are not in business I can tell you 100% if you do good audit on their Farm you would discover that these guys are not in business they just have uh Farm they just have their Farm they have animals there but they are not in business so you have to have a business plan what's your business plan what do you him to do now let me just walk you through some certain mindsets around the business plan you could have for instance do you want to be a breeder that means do you want to have breeders on your farm do you want to be the person that brings in uh that um produces the piglet on your alone or do you want to be a breeder and be a partner that means do you want to pick up the piglet also and also grow them to maturity you have to have a business plan you have to have a very solid business plan what do you aim to do don't just get there and just take PS and just start wearing them yourself what do you into there are different aspect of this thing for some people now all they do is buy the piglet they buy the Piglet and they fix the piglet somewhere they R them up in about 6 months after 6 months they dispose them they get new piglets that's a business plan so these guys those guys that do such thing they are not interested in having breeders at all all they interested in is to have uh a reputable breeder Farm where they will get their piglets from every uh every time they they have in U they AA they available and they interested in having and put them in a pen get the feet feed them uh take them to maturity and dispose them that's a business plan or okay if you don't want that plan probably you just want to be a breeder alone that means your own job is just to give pigl out to other Farmers so all you have to do is to have the Breeders the sa and the bo uh and uh you call for Farmers neighboring Farmers to pick piglets from you every now and then there's a woman I know that's literally what she's major majored in uh recently on this Farm we got Piglet from her from that a farm she don't keep she hardly keeps any Pig till 6 month or or thereabout but she has about I don't know how many uh female pigs she has very great pigs very good breed and uh she has the she has the T and she has the Afric the South African large white and she has a good B she just has uh the pen she has is not it's not a very big farm but at least she has I think probably almost hat um breeder females so all she do is produce the piglets people come around pick the piglets from her and that's great and she's doing well uh we did the estimate of how much you'll be making every year she's making solid money there she's not wearing anything up to 6 month she uh after uh having the winners maybe um 5 weeks 6 weeks she disposes all of them gets the Breeders ready for uh meeting again and then get them uh bread and then she makes new piglets again that's a business plan okay and you can do both you can decide to have your breeders maybe you have four females and then you decide to uh get piglets out of them after you get piglets out of them you raise the piglets to 6 months so in that case now everything has to be well plant don't go into this without having a solid plant if not you would you would just uh find yourself having lots of Hard breaks because you will be you you would be one of the people that would get into P fing and get out a lot of people call come in and get out in just like how almost every other agricultural Venture is lot of people delve in especially when they watch lot of videos and later on they get Del out because they didn't have a plan so they were they were not able to uh uh to face the challenges that came with whatever they were working with now I go with the next mindset and that have a good budget uh have a good budget you see your plan your business plan must be dependent on the budget you have you know one of the reasons why you need to have a good budget is for instance now you need to know that uh Pig farming is capital intensive these guys don't uh they don't hit grasses like that you can't feed them on grass like that just like the gr grth growth farming where you could literally get them to Grace on free grasses and everything these guys you have to house them housing them after you're done housing them you have to feed them in the morning in the afternoon so it's a capital intensive business so you have to be ready you have to be ready for all these cost you cannot get the pigs into your farm and malnourish them and expect to be in business have a good budget make sure before you get into um P farming you know what you are getting into you know the cost you are getting into how much will you need to raise a single Piglet from 1 month to 6 months if you know how much that is then you understand okay how much do you have how much are you do you have how much Capital do you have available for you do you think you can raise 10 piglets or do you think you can raise 20 that should be what should be your driving force your budget don't get into this and just probably you just see animals somewhere and they told you that uh the animals are quite cheap and you just feel oh I saw this opportunity let me get 20 of them and you get 20 of them and then you can't raise them and then you are out of business and then you are struggling and you're having real issues and the pigs can't eat and they are catching diseases and they are not attaining the right kg uh a pig I know of a farmer that sold his pigs after I think over 6 months those pigs did not some of those pigs did not weigh 50 kg after 6 months after over 6 months pigs did not weigh uh 50 kg I don't know if you of course if you're aspiring people you may not understand how terrible that is but you see this P you're looking at in this video on this Farm they are less than they uh more like let me just say about 3 months on this Farm they are weighing some of them will be weighing if not at least probably 40 kg already and somebody had uh pigs for over 6 months and could not attain maybe I think maybe he got 48 kg or thereabout in some of them or 46 or there about and he has been keeping these PS for a lot of time that's exactly what I'm saying I have a good brother no exactly what you're getting into because you need to plan for the right feet you can't plan for wrong feet you can't plan for just pkc so that's why I'm telling you please have a right budget so that you won't get out of business soon enough number four start small grow big start small grow big please you need to know this if you have uh a lot of money to raise uh maybe 100 PS I beg you don't go for 100 PS initially if you a new pig farmer please decide to go for a little number first no matter how much resources you have available to you please start small and Grow Big there is a reason for that it's not it's not money is not the only issue in pig farming you need to understand management management is also very important you need to understand there are challenges that may come to heat to to to your farm your location may have some certain uh challenges that you may not be aware of some certain things that you may not be aware of you may have issues with your workers you you may have issues with your water supply so it may not just be that oh you didn't have money that was why your farm had issues it could be some other things that you have no power over and that's why I'm saying start small and grow big if you have the money I would advise you that no matter how much money you have make sure you don't start with more than 10 females honestly that's even so much imagine having 10 females on your farm if those females give B you could literally have 100 piglets from just one bet in like uh 4 months in 4 month time if you bring in matur females on your farm you could have you could literally have 100 piglets in 4 months and that's a lot of money if you if you consider breeding those guys still 6 months so you need to be very much ready for whatever you are going into but please start small and grow big number five focus on your hyals improve structures later now I understand the importance of structures in Peak farming I want you to know that I understand it I understand the importance of a very solid structure and I'm not saying you should build a less solid structure but be very careful of not going into of designs and all these things initially of course when you make great profit on it you can go on to making a lot of improvement in your structures you can go on to um building with using high on and all those things but if you an intending Pak farmer and your budget is not very large of course if you have the money you can go for good structures and of course it would not mean anything to you but if you are having to if you are having to uh J stose between your animals or your structures I would advise you every time anytime every day that you should focus on your animals focus on their feet focus on their drugs on their medication focus on their water supply focus on those things don't Focus so much on if you look around this F see some people use you you could have seen some of our videos where we made use of bamboo sticks to do the uh the partitioning see those animals are doing fine inside of course that's not the best that's not the best structure of you if you you could if you could look at let me try and show you if you can look at this if you can look over there you would see Woods being used to partition the uh the um pen over there of course if you if you have money spend the money but I would advise you if you are if you have to Jose between what you should spend your money on your animals or the structure focus on the animals you can use l you you need to learn how to improvise you need to learn how to be resourceful do lots of things with uh materials around you don't Focus too much on I need to make everything solid with cement the cement bags are very expensive so if you can do anything with whatever resources you have around you please do it and focus on your animal health focus on them eating properly focus on them eating the right amount of protein focus on all those things and you will never get it wrong in Peak farming so please focus on your animals improve structures later if need be number six as I said already just to emphasize on it be resourceful try and on certain things you don't have to always spend money you don't have to always spend money it's not every time you have to look for uh the most modern way of handling something be uh resourceful try and improvise try and uh get uh things around your area try and look for things that would lessen your cost the aim for a good business uh uh activity is for you to have lessened cost so that your your your profit can come out from there you don't have to spend too much on your business so instead of you running around looking for the most modern thing right here you can see we're using the wallo system I so much love the nipple Drinker I believe you have seen an improvised uh way of doing n Drinker that was released uh some some you should have seen it in one of our videos on how to uh improvise the new Drinker using a bucket those are some of the things I'm talking about you you need to find a way around all these things don't be too focused on spending money uh on just everything you need to learn how to be resourceful resourcefulness is the ultimate resource resourcefulness is the ultimate resource so number seven market research cannot be overemphasized your market research if you are new to PE farming I understand you may have seen so many things on the media talking about all you need to uh understand about uh uh Peak farming and how much uh it has good But please understand your location and understand what your location needs you need to make sure that your location is in demand for this thing don't be too carried away with what you see on the internet market research cannot be overemphasized before you get into into Peak farming go around your area and find out what's the demand for paks in your area and what size are they are they in demand for what do people need what do people require are people searching for the piglet so before you think about going into breeders Farm ask yourself is are people is the demand for piglet in your area is it very solid you have lots of farmers looking for piglet before you decide to be a breeder farmers and ask yourself also if you want to R till 6 month like what's the number what's the number of pigs that you think you will be able to dispose in a month so that you don't have 100 Pigs and the demand is 50 so you I understand that in some places the has not been met But be sure that that's the case in your area ask yourself where are you locating your farm and how long how what will you what will it take for you to transport your animals from your farm to wherever the market is you know obviously markets will be somewhere somewhere but do you have the right resources to transport your animals from where you are if there there are no markets in your area to where Market is these are important things you need to pay attention to so number eight invest in knowledge invest in knowledge train your workers you see it is uh deception real deception if somebody tells you all you need to do is just to get pigs and put them in a place and not all that's real deception I'm telling you it doesn't work that way you need to have somebody somebody somebody somewhere that is an expert somebody that you can always reach out to somebody that you can always call upon you could go get to your farm one morning and you will see your pigs acting out you can see you could decide you could discover some certain things that you've never experienced before you need to have the right knowledge invest in knowledge and that's why we we bring to you several content on this farm and I've told you already we're not going to hide anything everything you need to know about P farming that we're going to Dish everything out on this channel and if you're new here please make sure you subscribe click on the subscription button and make sure you turn on the Bell notification so that what whatever we bring great content you can always be notified so invest in knowledge invest in knowledge the right vings the right uh uh drugs the right biomedical uh security measures that you need to have the right how do you build your structures what are what what's the requirement for uh structures on in Peak farming what's the spacing how many PS should you put in a in some certain uh space do you just fixing you see some fers fixing like almost 20 PS in a certain space what's the requirement invest in knowledge so that you don't make mistakes and make sure you invest in knowledge before you get into it so that you don't get into an error before you got into uh before you just while you're starting and then it St you a lot to correct the error so please invest in the right knowledge train your workers if you have workers make sure you train them train them how to inject your paks you don't have to be on the farm all the time your worker should be able to take the initiative to inject the animals know how to give them the highve metin know how to identify when they having diarrhea and how to treat uh the diarrhea know how to dearm your paks invest in knowledge train your workers very well train your workers what are the signs they need to look look out for to be sure that your pigs are not sick I think we have addressed that on in this channel already train your workers very well so that you can have the right profits on your Farm Number Nine be ready for challenges be ready for challenges I want you to know that it doesn't matter how much you put if you call on the best expert to if you the best consultant consulted for you for you to start your Pak Farm if you I don't know if you read the best books on Peak farming if you have uh you made the best research on Peak farming on the internet I don't care whatever you do you're going to face challenges on your P Farm it is bound to happen so be ready for challenges and you have to be Resolute stay Resolute you don't have to give up in this in the face of challenges the fact that you're experiencing something in your farm doesn't mean you have to fold up your farm doesn't mean you have to pack up your farm invest in knowledge but also be ready for challenges it's not because you're doing something wrong all the time it may just be just the circumstance of life that would always happen life has challenges you have to learn how to solve them don't uh give up stay Resolute don't don't let ever let whatever happens turn you uh uh make you discourage and you get out of pig farming stay Resolute I want you know that the xra in everything was once a beginner so whatever you are facing as a solution you just have to make uh your right research sometimes and uh sometimes you have to experience some things for you to know better and to know how to solve those challenges better and then number 10 which is the last but not the least prey that's the last thing prey I haded that there because you need to understand that the best of the best uh the best of the best Farmers the most uh the best Farms out there they face challenges that they cannot solve I don't know if you have seen situations where you will see on cattles all dead I've seen it before you see people uh maybe uh a Veterinary came to the to inject the animals and killed several of their goats I that happened recently in a certain Farm several of their goats di those are not things that came because the guys were not expact or because they did not put everything right it's just some of the things you just need to pray about and uh and trust God to help you because this is life and so you need to know that there are certain things that are out of your own hands the best of the best Farms out there they face challenges that they cannot solve so the last but not the least mindset is all right I think this uh should have been very helpful for every P aspiring Pak farmer out there if you are new to Pak farming or you just thinking about starting your Pak Farm you need to know all these things put all this in place you can always reach out to us if you need help on everything on anything so that we can help you we can guide you we're ready to help you we want you to be profitable in your Peak farming project I've seen lots of farmers
