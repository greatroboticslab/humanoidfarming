1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:04,000
let's say you have a big new piece of

2
00:00:01,599 --> 00:00:06,160
property but you can only choose one

3
00:00:04,000 --> 00:00:07,839
machine which one do you choose well i

4
00:00:06,160 --> 00:00:09,920
can't make that decision for you but i

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:11,599
can go through some of the pros and cons

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:13,519
i know a lot of you guys have made this

7
00:00:11,599 --> 00:00:15,040
same tough decision but leave your

8
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:16,960
comments down below as we walk through

9
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:19,039
these five machines i'll give you my

10
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,960
take on it all and if i had to sell all

11
00:00:19,039 --> 00:00:22,800
these off and keep just one i'll let you

12
00:00:20,960 --> 00:00:24,160
know what it is at the end hey when

13
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:25,680
you're done watching if you enjoyed the

14
00:00:24,160 --> 00:00:27,920
video i'd love to get a thumbs up from

15
00:00:25,680 --> 00:00:29,519
you hit subscribe to see more tractor

16
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:31,119
and maybe property development videos

17
00:00:29,519 --> 00:00:32,800
too and if you want something for your

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:34,800
tractor or your skid steer make sure you

19
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:37,120
check out goodworkstractors.com

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
okay

21
00:00:37,600 --> 00:00:41,680
hang on look at those deer

22
00:00:39,520 --> 00:00:45,600
one two three four

23
00:00:41,680 --> 00:00:47,600
five one two there's five one though

24
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:49,360
that's a doe

25
00:00:47,600 --> 00:00:50,399
that's a doe little guy

26
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:52,559
all right we'll give you the quick

27
00:00:50,399 --> 00:00:53,760
rundown of what equipment we have here

28
00:00:52,559 --> 00:00:56,160
first we're gonna start with the sub

29
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,800
compact tractor gonna have a john deere

30
00:00:56,160 --> 00:01:00,320
1025 r loader has a backhoe has a belly

31
00:00:58,800 --> 00:01:01,520
mower on it

32
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:04,159
next to it right here we're gonna have a

33
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:05,680
john deere 333g skid steer but just

34
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:07,200
think of this as a skid steer in general

35
00:01:05,680 --> 00:01:08,320
they make them big they make them small

36
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,840
they make them with tracks and with

37
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,600
wheels all sorts of stuff but a skid

38
00:01:09,840 --> 00:01:13,680
steer represented right here next up

39
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:15,520
we're going to have a very large compact

40
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:17,200
tractor this is as big of a compact

41
00:01:15,520 --> 00:01:19,360
tractor as you can get a hydrostatic

42
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:20,640
machine you can get a backhoe for it you

43
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:23,680
can get the front end loader forward a

44
00:01:20,640 --> 00:01:25,280
cab and open station 66 horsepower so

45
00:01:23,680 --> 00:01:28,320
representative kind of the flip flop

46
00:01:25,280 --> 00:01:30,479
side of the 1025r which is the smallest

47
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:32,400
subcompact tractor you can get with the

48
00:01:30,479 --> 00:01:34,479
biggest compact right here next up we

49
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:37,600
have this bad boy i just got this one in

50
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:39,439
a kubota m4d-071

51
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:42,159
yeah that's a mouthful but this is going

52
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:44,720
to be into the utility frame size or

53
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:46,159
classification of tractors the next step

54
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:49,119
up from the compact so we have

55
00:01:46,159 --> 00:01:50,799
subcompact skid steer compact utility

56
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:52,479
all right so this is a whole other gamut

57
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:54,799
we'll get into that soon and last but

58
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,159
not least we're gonna have the cat 305

59
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,920
e2 this is a mini excavator

60
00:01:58,159 --> 00:02:01,759
so far i haven't used this one a whole

61
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:02,399
lot but i've got a lot of projects for

62
00:02:01,759 --> 00:02:03,759
it

63
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:05,360
there's going to be some pros and cons

64
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:07,280
associated with each one of these pieces

65
00:02:05,360 --> 00:02:09,360
of equipment so let's get into it now

66
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:10,720
all right let's get started but

67
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
i want to put this out there i know

68
00:02:10,720 --> 00:02:14,239
there will be comments the right machine

69
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,480
could depend on your property right the

70
00:02:14,239 --> 00:02:18,080
size of your property if you have fields

71
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:20,160
ponds woods whatever you have going on

72
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:21,840
your budget a lot of variables come into

73
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:24,080
play so i'm giving you this information

74
00:02:21,840 --> 00:02:25,840
from my perspective based on my property

75
00:02:24,080 --> 00:02:29,440
about 140 acres

76
00:02:25,840 --> 00:02:31,599
a mixture a field a lot of woods a lot

77
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:33,280
of pond frontage a lot of hills so this

78
00:02:31,599 --> 00:02:36,280
is a tailor-made decision for my

79
00:02:33,280 --> 00:02:36,280
property

80
00:02:38,080 --> 00:02:42,480
all right well i've said this a lot of

81
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:45,360
times about a 1025 r it's small but it's

82
00:02:42,480 --> 00:02:47,200
mighty you know 140 acres is a pretty

83
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:49,440
big chunk of land for a small tractor

84
00:02:47,200 --> 00:02:50,800
like this but it can technically do a

85
00:02:49,440 --> 00:02:52,160
lot of the work that needs to be done

86
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:53,519
out here it's just going to take it a

87
00:02:52,160 --> 00:02:55,519
lot longer you know a really good

88
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:58,159
example would be we're putting in an

89
00:02:55,519 --> 00:03:00,800
1800 foot long driveway and i had been

90
00:02:58,159 --> 00:03:02,959
using a bigger a seven foot tiller on my

91
00:03:00,800 --> 00:03:04,800
4720 for a while but then that broke

92
00:03:02,959 --> 00:03:06,239
down for a bit of time and

93
00:03:04,800 --> 00:03:08,080
needed to keep the work going so we

94
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:10,000
hooked up a four foot tiller on the 10

95
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:12,000
25 r it just

96
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,560
takes a while longer you know it's a

97
00:03:12,000 --> 00:03:16,640
smaller footprint you have to go slower

98
00:03:14,560 --> 00:03:18,560
it doesn't want to tilt as deep but the

99
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:20,640
point being you can still get the job

100
00:03:18,560 --> 00:03:22,239
done if time allows the same thing could

101
00:03:20,640 --> 00:03:24,640
be said for mowing a big old field

102
00:03:22,239 --> 00:03:25,920
tilling a food plot putting some trails

103
00:03:24,640 --> 00:03:27,280
in through the woods there's a lot of

104
00:03:25,920 --> 00:03:28,799
things that you can actually do with

105
00:03:27,280 --> 00:03:30,640
this tractor but there's a lot of big

106
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:32,400
projects out there that i have no desire

107
00:03:30,640 --> 00:03:34,159
to tackle with a tractor this size

108
00:03:32,400 --> 00:03:36,640
another big benefit that i found with a

109
00:03:34,159 --> 00:03:38,400
smaller tractor is when i'm in the woods

110
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,560
which again is a huge portion of this

111
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:42,239
property trying to maintain those trails

112
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:44,159
or just navigate them or if you're

113
00:03:42,239 --> 00:03:46,159
trying to turn around in tight quarters

114
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:48,480
a smaller machine is just obviously

115
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:50,879
easier to use and where we're standing

116
00:03:48,480 --> 00:03:52,879
right now i hope someday will be the

117
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:54,640
yard of our future home and with a

118
00:03:52,879 --> 00:03:56,480
tractor this size you can put a

119
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:58,400
mid-mount mower or a belly mower on it

120
00:03:56,480 --> 00:03:59,920
and maintain your lawn so

121
00:03:58,400 --> 00:04:01,760
if you're looking for an all-in-one

122
00:03:59,920 --> 00:04:03,680
machine that can do it all maybe you do

123
00:04:01,760 --> 00:04:05,360
have a little bit smaller chunk of land

124
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:07,680
then this could garner some serious

125
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:09,680
consideration but tractors in general

126
00:04:07,680 --> 00:04:11,200
are known as swiss army knives right

127
00:04:09,680 --> 00:04:12,560
they can just do a little bit of

128
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:14,159
everything you know with the front end

129
00:04:12,560 --> 00:04:16,639
loader you can put a bucket a snow

130
00:04:14,159 --> 00:04:18,320
pusher a grapple a set of pallet forks

131
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:20,079
you can get a backhoe on the back side

132
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:21,840
of course the belly mower underneath

133
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:23,440
they can just tackle all sorts of

134
00:04:21,840 --> 00:04:25,440
different projects that may come up

135
00:04:23,440 --> 00:04:27,040
which really enhances their value and i

136
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:29,360
think it's important to note that this

137
00:04:27,040 --> 00:04:31,199
is really just the miracle of hydraulics

138
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:33,280
so to speak so everything from the

139
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:34,960
hydraulic transmissions to just have a

140
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:36,400
twin touch pedal system to go forwards

141
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,080
and backwards out changing gears is

142
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:40,080
amazing you know with the hydraulics

143
00:04:38,080 --> 00:04:42,000
that can lift a thousand or more pounds

144
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,360
you know and just dig holes and do

145
00:04:42,000 --> 00:04:45,199
everything that these machines do is

146
00:04:43,360 --> 00:04:48,720
just incredible in and of itself as well

147
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:48,720
as their ability to enhance your life

148
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:54,720
all right moving on to a skid steer i

149
00:04:52,560 --> 00:04:56,000
tell you i have spent a lot of hours

150
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:57,680
over the last few months in my skid

151
00:04:56,000 --> 00:04:59,600
steer we bought the property at the end

152
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:01,680
of june it's now november

153
00:04:59,600 --> 00:05:04,720
a lot of heavy lifting was required this

154
00:05:01,680 --> 00:05:06,320
was a completely overgrown property

155
00:05:04,720 --> 00:05:08,560
wild for years and years and years and

156
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,919
so it took a lot of effort to get it to

157
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:11,680
this point where we're at right now and

158
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:13,840
still needs a lot more work to get where

159
00:05:11,680 --> 00:05:15,280
we want to go so i have upgraded this is

160
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:17,360
the largest of the john deere skid

161
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:18,720
steers that are out there or ctls

162
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:20,960
compact track loaders that you might

163
00:05:18,720 --> 00:05:22,880
hear it called but this is kind of the

164
00:05:20,960 --> 00:05:25,039
top of the heap and you could get a

165
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:27,120
smaller skid steer and still be

166
00:05:25,039 --> 00:05:29,120
well ahead of some other capabilities on

167
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:31,280
other pieces of equipment the hydraulic

168
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:32,960
systems on skid steers are

169
00:05:31,280 --> 00:05:34,880
top notch and if you get a high flow

170
00:05:32,960 --> 00:05:36,720
system it's going to allow you to get

171
00:05:34,880 --> 00:05:38,479
into something like a multihead which i

172
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:40,320
used out here for hours and hours and

173
00:05:38,479 --> 00:05:41,759
hours on end to create trails these

174
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:43,520
fields were just riddled with autumn

175
00:05:41,759 --> 00:05:45,600
olive and other overgrown bushes and i

176
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:47,520
just spent days clearing everything out

177
00:05:45,600 --> 00:05:48,960
cleaning it up we still have more work

178
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:51,039
to do on the other side of the property

179
00:05:48,960 --> 00:05:53,120
too but if i were to sum up a skid steer

180
00:05:51,039 --> 00:05:54,000
in one word it would be power and it's

181
00:05:53,120 --> 00:05:55,520
just

182
00:05:54,000 --> 00:05:57,759
the ability to do whatever you want if

183
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:59,440
you have to move logs if you want to use

184
00:05:57,759 --> 00:06:01,520
that mulcher head if you need to lift

185
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:03,039
heavy things with a set of pallet forks

186
00:06:01,520 --> 00:06:05,360
you can count on a skid steer to get it

187
00:06:03,039 --> 00:06:07,600
done now second right behind the power

188
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:09,520
aspect for me on a hilly property is

189
00:06:07,600 --> 00:06:10,560
going to be the stability that this

190
00:06:09,520 --> 00:06:12,960
sense of

191
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:15,120
safety that you feel in a skid steer it

192
00:06:12,960 --> 00:06:18,240
has a low center of gravity these are

193
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:19,680
nice wide tracks i mean it's

194
00:06:18,240 --> 00:06:21,680
i don't know it's just an incredible

195
00:06:19,680 --> 00:06:23,199
feeling compared to a tractor and i'm

196
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:25,120
not picking on the 10 25 it's just

197
00:06:23,199 --> 00:06:26,479
tractors in general they're pretty long

198
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:28,639
and they're skinny and they have a

199
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:30,720
little bit higher center of gravity so

200
00:06:28,639 --> 00:06:32,240
you're really going to notice an uneasy

201
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:35,199
tippy feeling you know we've talked

202
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:36,720
about bora for a long long time and and

203
00:06:35,199 --> 00:06:38,800
adding wheel spacers to widen your

204
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,800
footprint and the reason for that is

205
00:06:38,800 --> 00:06:42,800
because it is just an unsettling feeling

206
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:44,560
they had this roll bar up top here to

207
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:46,639
prevent rollovers from occurring because

208
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:48,080
it killed so many people years ago now

209
00:06:46,639 --> 00:06:49,680
of course the skid steer is still going

210
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,880
to have a roll cage on it i mean that's

211
00:06:49,680 --> 00:06:52,720
just a safety thing you're going to see

212
00:06:50,880 --> 00:06:56,160
on any piece of equipment these days but

213
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:58,319
i tell you i have never felt uneasy or

214
00:06:56,160 --> 00:07:00,000
tippy at all in my skid steer i guess

215
00:06:58,319 --> 00:07:01,520
i'm just not pushing it hard enough so

216
00:07:00,000 --> 00:07:03,120
as far as attachments go everything is

217
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:04,400
going to go on the front end loader so

218
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:06,400
no matter what you're hooking up you can

219
00:07:04,400 --> 00:07:08,080
put a tiller on a skid steer if you want

220
00:07:06,400 --> 00:07:10,080
to but it's going right up here in front

221
00:07:08,080 --> 00:07:11,199
same thing with that brush mulcher same

222
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:13,280
thing with a set of paddle forks

223
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:14,479
whatever you want to do whereas a tiller

224
00:07:13,280 --> 00:07:16,160
is going to go on the back side on the

225
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:17,520
three-point hitch on a tractor but what

226
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,599
i really like about that is the

227
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:21,440
visibility i mean you can see this whole

228
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:23,759
glass door everything is right there in

229
00:07:21,440 --> 00:07:26,000
front of you it's super easy to see

230
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:27,599
on a tractor you've got the the hood the

231
00:07:26,000 --> 00:07:29,039
cowling the engine compartment all in

232
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:30,639
the way so it can be difficult to see

233
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,000
what's in front of you of course if you

234
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:33,680
have something on the three-point hitch

235
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,199
you can turn around and see behind you

236
00:07:33,680 --> 00:07:36,880
but that does get uncomfortable after a

237
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:38,720
while now as far as the prices these

238
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:40,240
attachments go a lot of these are going

239
00:07:38,720 --> 00:07:42,160
to be hydraulically driven some are

240
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:44,319
going to have hydraulic motors on there

241
00:07:42,160 --> 00:07:45,919
there's no like pto shaft so there's no

242
00:07:44,319 --> 00:07:47,919
gearbox like what a tractor could have

243
00:07:45,919 --> 00:07:50,240
on a three-point hitch on the back side

244
00:07:47,919 --> 00:07:51,840
so the attachments can get really costly

245
00:07:50,240 --> 00:07:54,000
along with the fact that these larger

246
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:56,240
hydraulic systems have more capacity so

247
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:58,400
they need to be built beefier stouter

248
00:07:56,240 --> 00:08:00,000
more steel which just means more cost

249
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:02,240
and now besides the attachments skid

250
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:04,080
steers themselves can cost a pretty

251
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:05,360
penny you know so you don't have to get

252
00:08:04,080 --> 00:08:07,280
the biggest and the baddest one out

253
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:09,520
there you can get something smaller you

254
00:08:07,280 --> 00:08:12,080
can get an open station

255
00:08:09,520 --> 00:08:13,840
out here oh boy i tell you i would not

256
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:15,919
get a wheeled skid steer at least for

257
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,840
this property it was like just spinning

258
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:19,599
your wheels uh literally i mean there's

259
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:21,039
still ruts that that i've seen around

260
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:22,400
here that we had when we were first out

261
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,720
here

262
00:08:22,400 --> 00:08:26,560
these tracks are amazing out here on the

263
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,520
property and i can't imagine having a

264
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:30,630
wheeled steer

265
00:08:27,520 --> 00:08:30,630
[Music]

266
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:36,080
now before we get started on the 4720 i

267
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,560
think it is worth noting that

268
00:08:36,080 --> 00:08:41,039
all these machines have a factory cab on

269
00:08:38,560 --> 00:08:43,599
them with air conditioning and heat with

270
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:45,519
the exception of the 1025r which they

271
00:08:43,599 --> 00:08:47,760
don't offer now you can get a cab with

272
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:48,959
heat on the 1025r and take the doors off

273
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:50,880
in the summertime and have a little

274
00:08:48,959 --> 00:08:52,560
fresh breeze coming through that's fine

275
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:54,160
but if you have a cab on your tractor or

276
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,800
your skid steer or whatever the heck it

277
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:59,040
is in summer winter you know if it's

278
00:08:56,800 --> 00:09:01,040
dusty out if it's rainy if it's snowy if

279
00:08:59,040 --> 00:09:02,399
it's hot if it's cold whatever it is

280
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:04,399
you're going to get a lot more work done

281
00:09:02,399 --> 00:09:06,080
a lot more efficiently a lot more

282
00:09:04,399 --> 00:09:07,760
comfortably you're going to stay out

283
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:09,440
there longer your projects will get done

284
00:09:07,760 --> 00:09:13,279
quicker you see where i'm going with

285
00:09:09,440 --> 00:09:15,040
this okay now onto the 4720 or the 4066

286
00:09:13,279 --> 00:09:17,440
like what i had previously to this

287
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:19,680
machine but this is a large frame

288
00:09:17,440 --> 00:09:21,200
compact tractor as big as you can get

289
00:09:19,680 --> 00:09:22,959
why that's significant to me is that

290
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:24,959
this is still going to be a hydrostatic

291
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:26,959
machine all right so you have a ton of

292
00:09:24,959 --> 00:09:28,480
lift capacity on the front end loader

293
00:09:26,959 --> 00:09:30,959
and on the three-point hitch to really

294
00:09:28,480 --> 00:09:32,720
tackle large attachments and projects

295
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:34,240
that you need to do but you can still do

296
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:36,160
it efficiently with a hydrostatic

297
00:09:34,240 --> 00:09:38,080
transmission which going forward and

298
00:09:36,160 --> 00:09:39,760
backwards is a piece of cake compared to

299
00:09:38,080 --> 00:09:41,519
a gear drive which we'll get into that

300
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:43,279
soon on this machine but there's really

301
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:45,040
a whole list of pros and cons between

302
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:46,880
hydro and gear drive in general that's

303
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:48,959
not really what this is about but really

304
00:09:46,880 --> 00:09:50,399
a hydro transmission is hard to be if

305
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:52,320
you're going to be changing direction a

306
00:09:50,399 --> 00:09:53,839
lot say you're going into a a pile of

307
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:56,000
material or you're grappling a lot of

308
00:09:53,839 --> 00:09:57,360
logs just going back and forth with

309
00:09:56,000 --> 00:09:58,480
different loader applications and

310
00:09:57,360 --> 00:10:00,080
functions

311
00:09:58,480 --> 00:10:02,560
it's just really hard to beat so really

312
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:04,880
this has the same type of versatility as

313
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:06,720
the 1025r we talked about earlier well

314
00:10:04,880 --> 00:10:08,000
with the exception of mowing your lawn

315
00:10:06,720 --> 00:10:09,920
you're really not going to mow your lawn

316
00:10:08,000 --> 00:10:11,360
with this tractor too often it's pretty

317
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:12,880
darn big for that but

318
00:10:11,360 --> 00:10:14,880
a good example would be mowing this

319
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:17,600
field right so we did some mowing with

320
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:20,480
several different machines and on a 1025

321
00:10:17,600 --> 00:10:22,240
r you could run a 48 inch a four foot

322
00:10:20,480 --> 00:10:24,560
brush hog but we're running a 10 foot

323
00:10:22,240 --> 00:10:26,160
brush we could run a 12 or 15 foot if we

324
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:28,160
wanted to on this tractor so you can see

325
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,160
how having a lot bigger tractor can help

326
00:10:28,160 --> 00:10:31,920
you be a lot more efficient if you have

327
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,600
a large acreage application and this

328
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:35,360
isn't every tractor series that's out

329
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:37,120
there there's a big jump from a 1 series

330
00:10:35,360 --> 00:10:38,959
to a 4 series you have the 2 and the 3

331
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:40,480
series in the middle and you could fall

332
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:42,240
well within that range too just

333
00:10:40,480 --> 00:10:44,399
depending on the size of the land that

334
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:46,079
you have or the size of the projects or

335
00:10:44,399 --> 00:10:48,160
the size of attachments or the budget or

336
00:10:46,079 --> 00:10:49,519
whatever it is but we're just talking

337
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:51,360
about the machines that i have out here

338
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:53,040
at the property right now and so i have

339
00:10:51,360 --> 00:10:54,640
used this tractor a decent amount out

340
00:10:53,040 --> 00:10:56,160
here so far and i would have used it

341
00:10:54,640 --> 00:10:58,320
more if it wasn't for the whole

342
00:10:56,160 --> 00:11:00,240
overheating experience i had this summer

343
00:10:58,320 --> 00:11:02,399
but we've done some field mowing with it

344
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:03,839
we've done some driveway maintenance

345
00:11:02,399 --> 00:11:05,760
actually we used the tiller to help put

346
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,519
the driveway in as well did some

347
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:09,200
landscape raking over on the other side

348
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:11,279
of the property too and we originally

349
00:11:09,200 --> 00:11:13,360
got a four series tractor to use back at

350
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:14,880
the shop just to help offload and load

351
00:11:13,360 --> 00:11:17,200
up trucks and pallets and move things

352
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:19,279
around it's a very capable machine it's

353
00:11:17,200 --> 00:11:21,200
very stable we added some wheel spacers

354
00:11:19,279 --> 00:11:23,200
on to make it a little bit wider

355
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,560
probably didn't really need to so much

356
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:26,640
out here it's a little hilly so it does

357
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,040
come in handy but these are naturally a

358
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:31,140
pretty stable machine

359
00:11:28,040 --> 00:11:31,140
[Music]

360
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,959
all right well this is the latest

361
00:11:32,800 --> 00:11:36,440
addition to my fleet here which is a

362
00:11:34,959 --> 00:11:38,800
kubota

363
00:11:36,440 --> 00:11:40,079
m4d-071 this is a utility tractor all

364
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:41,920
right so we're stepping out of the

365
00:11:40,079 --> 00:11:43,680
compact world stepping up into the

366
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:46,480
utility world you can see it's a bigger

367
00:11:43,680 --> 00:11:47,839
footprint bigger tires heavier still has

368
00:11:46,480 --> 00:11:49,440
a front end loader on it still has a

369
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:51,200
three-point hitch still has a cab you're

370
00:11:49,440 --> 00:11:53,120
not going to mow your lawn with this but

371
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:55,680
one of the main reasons that i got this

372
00:11:53,120 --> 00:11:57,600
tractor was for that kind of just point

373
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:00,160
it in one direction and go type of work

374
00:11:57,600 --> 00:12:02,800
so if you are brush hogging a big field

375
00:12:00,160 --> 00:12:03,920
or if you are grading your long driveway

376
00:12:02,800 --> 00:12:05,360
or if you're

377
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:06,720
plowing a field you know if you're just

378
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:08,639
doing something where you just kind of

379
00:12:06,720 --> 00:12:10,079
set it and forget it this is a great

380
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:11,760
machine for it you know i'm actually

381
00:12:10,079 --> 00:12:13,440
going to be setting this up with a big

382
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:15,360
old snow pusher on it to plow the

383
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:17,600
driveway so same kind of application

384
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,279
right it's not the loader work where

385
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:20,720
you're digging into a pile and going

386
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,160
back and forwards all the time or trying

387
00:12:20,720 --> 00:12:24,560
to grade and smooth things out with your

388
00:12:22,160 --> 00:12:26,240
bucket i did not get this tractor to do

389
00:12:24,560 --> 00:12:28,000
that kind of work but it really got me

390
00:12:26,240 --> 00:12:29,839
thinking about a bigger gear drive

391
00:12:28,000 --> 00:12:31,120
tractor when we had some overheating

392
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:33,279
issues when we were brush talking this

393
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:35,680
summer you know it was 90 degrees plus

394
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:37,839
out all summer long and the hydra

395
00:12:35,680 --> 00:12:40,079
machines will run a little warmer and as

396
00:12:37,839 --> 00:12:41,440
we found out they will overheat and then

397
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:42,800
if you're in a pandemic it's going to

398
00:12:41,440 --> 00:12:44,720
take you six or eight weeks to get your

399
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,480
tractor back up and running i just don't

400
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:49,519
want to deal with that nonsense anymore

401
00:12:46,480 --> 00:12:52,720
so yeah i used to have a 5115m which is

402
00:12:49,519 --> 00:12:54,800
115 horsepower 5 series tractor i bought

403
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:56,000
that because i got a great deal on it

404
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,079
and i thought i'm going to use that

405
00:12:56,000 --> 00:13:00,160
someday at a new property i get out here

406
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:02,240
though i don't have enough open acreage

407
00:13:00,160 --> 00:13:04,320
to really justify a tractor that big

408
00:13:02,240 --> 00:13:07,040
it's a whole new set of attachments

409
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:09,120
where this is a 73 horsepower tractor so

410
00:13:07,040 --> 00:13:11,279
it's just a few horsepower bigger than

411
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:13,600
the 4 series tractor so i can use a lot

412
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:15,920
of those similar size attachments that i

413
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:18,160
already sell and carry but i can use

414
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:19,440
this for certain applications it can run

415
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,720
a lot cooler

416
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,000
it's going to be efficient when i'm just

417
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:23,440
mowing a field i'm not changing

418
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:25,279
direction having to switch gears and

419
00:13:23,440 --> 00:13:26,800
monkey around with all that so since i

420
00:13:25,279 --> 00:13:28,800
don't have to choose one piece of

421
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:30,399
equipment i bought this to tackle a

422
00:13:28,800 --> 00:13:31,680
certain set of needs a certain set of

423
00:13:30,399 --> 00:13:33,360
projects

424
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,880
and to make videos for you guys you know

425
00:13:33,360 --> 00:13:36,160
i think it's worth noting as well that

426
00:13:34,880 --> 00:13:38,480
you are actually going to get a little

427
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:40,639
bit more stable with this tractor again

428
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:42,320
it's a wider footprint your center of

429
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:44,399
gravity really isn't going up much

430
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:45,920
higher so it's about seven foot wide

431
00:13:44,399 --> 00:13:47,440
compared to about six foot wide on the

432
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:49,040
four series so you're just going to

433
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:51,920
notice on those smaller tractors like

434
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:53,760
the 1 series all the way up to the 2 3 4

435
00:13:51,920 --> 00:13:55,279
5 6 series whatever it is you're

436
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:56,079
naturally going to feel a little bit

437
00:13:55,279 --> 00:14:00,680
more

438
00:13:56,079 --> 00:14:00,680
safe and secure the larger you go

439
00:14:03,040 --> 00:14:07,120
all right and last but not least is

440
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:09,199
going to be the mini excavator and

441
00:14:07,120 --> 00:14:11,040
man i've watched a lot of youtube videos

442
00:14:09,199 --> 00:14:12,959
of folks using these things and they are

443
00:14:11,040 --> 00:14:15,040
just amazing for a lot of different

444
00:14:12,959 --> 00:14:16,560
projects which i'm going to get to out

445
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:18,720
here i haven't really used it a whole

446
00:14:16,560 --> 00:14:20,480
lot just yet but again it's man it's

447
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:21,920
tough to find equipment right now so if

448
00:14:20,480 --> 00:14:23,440
you're browsing around and you find what

449
00:14:21,920 --> 00:14:24,959
you think is a good deal you better just

450
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:26,399
jump on it and that's what i did because

451
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:28,399
i know i have a lot of needs coming up

452
00:14:26,399 --> 00:14:29,760
for this so we have four thousand foot

453
00:14:28,399 --> 00:14:31,839
of pond frontage you know with some

454
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:33,120
really steep banks there and angles and

455
00:14:31,839 --> 00:14:34,639
a lot of areas that it's going to be

456
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:36,160
unsafe and unstable to take other

457
00:14:34,639 --> 00:14:38,480
equipment just to get the

458
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:40,240
the fallen branches and logs and trees

459
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:41,680
that have accumulated there so just to

460
00:14:40,240 --> 00:14:43,600
get everything cleared out clean that

461
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:45,120
edge up a bit we have a driveway to put

462
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:47,600
over on the other side of the property

463
00:14:45,120 --> 00:14:49,360
about another eight or 900 foot drive

464
00:14:47,600 --> 00:14:51,199
got to get a nice connecting road from

465
00:14:49,360 --> 00:14:53,440
this side to the other side as well so a

466
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:55,120
lot of stumps to remove some some hills

467
00:14:53,440 --> 00:14:57,199
to cut into the sides and really grade

468
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,639
them out you know culver's to put in

469
00:14:57,199 --> 00:15:01,120
there's a lot of different applications

470
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:03,279
you can use a mini x4 but think about

471
00:15:01,120 --> 00:15:04,800
this you know this is this is one tool

472
00:15:03,279 --> 00:15:06,720
this is a backhoe essentially that you

473
00:15:04,800 --> 00:15:08,160
can put on the back of a tractor you

474
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:09,839
know any of those tractors we talked

475
00:15:08,160 --> 00:15:11,760
about of course different sizes and

476
00:15:09,839 --> 00:15:13,440
going to be less capable you know you

477
00:15:11,760 --> 00:15:14,720
can get a backhoe actually for the front

478
00:15:13,440 --> 00:15:16,480
or an excavator for the front of the

479
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:18,160
skid steer if you wanted to but this is

480
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:19,920
a dedicated

481
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:22,399
excavator right that's all this is going

482
00:15:19,920 --> 00:15:23,760
to do yes you can put

483
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:25,440
like a mulcher head on here if you

484
00:15:23,760 --> 00:15:27,600
wanted to do some forestry mulching with

485
00:15:25,440 --> 00:15:29,120
it you can get a few other attachments

486
00:15:27,600 --> 00:15:31,120
to kind of build them out and open up

487
00:15:29,120 --> 00:15:33,600
the versatility but it's going to be the

488
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:35,440
most limited as far as the spectrum of

489
00:15:33,600 --> 00:15:37,440
work that can be done at least in my

490
00:15:35,440 --> 00:15:40,000
opinion however i know there's some mini

491
00:15:37,440 --> 00:15:42,079
x lovers out there so you're waiting to

492
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:44,399
prove me wrong tell me all the things i

493
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,860
can use this mini x for i want to know

494
00:15:44,399 --> 00:15:48,970
all the projects i can do with it

495
00:15:45,860 --> 00:15:48,970
[Music]

496
00:15:50,720 --> 00:15:54,560
okay so now it's time to tell you if i

497
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:56,720
could only pick one which machine would

498
00:15:54,560 --> 00:15:58,480
i choose now i am curious to know which

499
00:15:56,720 --> 00:16:00,639
one you think i should keep

500
00:15:58,480 --> 00:16:02,160
but the one that i would keep if i could

501
00:16:00,639 --> 00:16:05,040
only keep one

502
00:16:02,160 --> 00:16:06,399
would be the 4720. and ironically enough

503
00:16:05,040 --> 00:16:07,680
this is actually the machine that i'm

504
00:16:06,399 --> 00:16:09,680
going to be selling and really the

505
00:16:07,680 --> 00:16:11,680
reason for that is it's going to be the

506
00:16:09,680 --> 00:16:13,440
biggest compact tractor i can get so

507
00:16:11,680 --> 00:16:15,759
it's hydrostatic which is just the ease

508
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:17,519
of operation and efficiency for me you

509
00:16:15,759 --> 00:16:19,199
know i can have plenty of lift capacity

510
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:21,440
with the front end loader for logging

511
00:16:19,199 --> 00:16:23,519
for grapple work for

512
00:16:21,440 --> 00:16:25,839
three-point lift capacity as well

513
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:27,360
run large attachments with the pto

514
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:29,040
tackle everything i need to in the

515
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:31,120
comfort of a cab with heat and air

516
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:33,839
conditioning for a property this size

517
00:16:31,120 --> 00:16:35,600
140 acres even if you had just 40 acres

518
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,120
i think that this is the tractor to get

519
00:16:35,600 --> 00:16:40,560
at least a 4 series it doesn't have to

520
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:43,199
be the 4720 or the 4066 but this general

521
00:16:40,560 --> 00:16:44,880
size of a tractor is very capable so but

522
00:16:43,199 --> 00:16:46,320
this gets you out of the bigger utility

523
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:48,639
tractors and the gear drive something

524
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:49,839
that's a little bit more compact says

525
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:51,920
the name right

526
00:16:49,839 --> 00:16:53,839
but you can get a kubota l6060 or

527
00:16:51,920 --> 00:16:56,079
another grand l just for a similar

528
00:16:53,839 --> 00:16:58,079
comparison in the kubota world but since

529
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:59,519
i'm not keeping just one machine this is

530
00:16:58,079 --> 00:17:00,959
the one that's gonna go alrighty well

531
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,720
that's gonna wrap it up you know i am

532
00:17:00,959 --> 00:17:04,799
curious what you guys have to say about

533
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:07,120
all this and believe it or not what you

534
00:17:04,799 --> 00:17:08,799
say helps a lot of other folks out a lot

535
00:17:07,120 --> 00:17:10,319
of folks read these comments down below

536
00:17:08,799 --> 00:17:12,160
so do everybody a favor if you have

537
00:17:10,319 --> 00:17:13,679
something helpful pitch in and leave a

538
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:15,280
comment but i do want to thank you for
