  "text": "ceilings have the tendency to be rather boring with lamps being the sole feature to break the white monotony let's change that how to jungle up your ceiling [Music] to create such a green ceiling we obviously need a plant first epipremnum aureom is truly the basic [\u00a0__\u00a0] houseplant originating from the french polynesia region it is now found in many tropical regions and as a common houseplant around the globe in germany it is commonly referred to as ifoytute in the anglo-sphere it is listed under a ton of names with devil's ivy being my personal favorite in russian-speaking regions it goes by its former scientific name the latisti patos whilst in japan it is simply referred to as potosu devil's ivy belongs to the arakaye family of plants a family in part characterized by its ability to spawn flowers though thanks to a dna defect it is the sole member of its family that doesn't actually goddamn flower making it a basic [\u00a0__\u00a0] houseplant or shy flowering in scientific lingo the only thing you should care about though is that thanks in part to the plant's excellent energy management it is essentially immortal it thrives both in direct sunlight as well as dark corners and has a straightforward water need you actually have to try to kill it so how do we even mount plants to the ceiling decorative vines meant for exteriors like the boston ivy mount themselves by a sticky fade for the interior this is a big no-no as that would leave marks upon removal so we will use a plant for vines without the ability to stick or climb wikipedia describes devil's ivy as having the ability to climb via roots which adhere to surfaces this is rather imprecise wording devil's ivy attempts to spawn a root roughly once a centimeter in between spawning leaves if the root touches a moist surface it will attempt to bore itself into it yes indeed you heard right moist if it's dry it's a no-go so if you buy the plant with a coconut fiber stem to glide onto it it won't work unless you water the stem itself as well there is a reason it's made out of absorbent material like coconut fiber so guess what a photographer does on the move to make an advertisement shot he uses metal clips or similar for the plants to hold onto the stem jesus christ way to miss the point of the whole goddamn plant but i digress [Music] if the spawning roots do not feel any moisture they instantly stop growing so devil's ivy will never attempt to cling to a wall or ceiling not that the roots could even do such a thing on a hard surface instead we will put the vines on a grit or pattern created by fishing line fishing line is essentially invisible against the white ceiling and gives the appearance of floating vines bore and pack holes in uniform distance from one another around the room screw in hooks to the pegs and stick to hooks not eye screws because hooks allow you to place part of the vine in it using the hooks and fishing line create a grit or a pattern to lane the vines on top of i went with a diamond pattern using a total of 12 hooks it really doesn't matter what pattern you choose as long as the empty space between the fishing line does not exceed one and a half meters so a vine will actually reach from line to line in a reasonable time and so that it won't sag from its own weight you have to tighten the fishing line by a lot to prevent sagging even if you do it with a lot of force there will always be sag no matter what so make sure to mount the hooks as high as possible to prevent the plants from falling below the level of your ceiling mounted lamp which would cause your room to get a lot darker speaking of which make sure your fishing line pattern actually leaves the lamp area empty by the way it doesn't have to be fishing line go with a rope made of coconut fiber or similar for a more pronounced effect if the plant is happy it takes six to eight months for one vine to grow from sealing to the floor depending on the pot size and how much water and nutrients it gets there will be at least a couple vines growing at that speed per pot with new vines being spawned here and there once the vines start interfering with your daily life and reach the floor it's time for the bi-early cleanup though i must admit it is kind of funny having to swat away vines from the monitor every week at this point the biggest vines are taken back to the ceiling where they are spread evenly throughout the grid after this your ceiling greenery just got a great deal dancer the leaves are attached rather delicately so be careful not to snag leaves on the fishing line and tear them off no matter how careful you are though this will always happen but do not throw fallen leaves away put them into a shot glass and change the water once a week oh damn it of course i broke too more after filming this off into the shot glass you go a leaf has roughly a 50 50 chance to spawn a root within two weeks once the root is roughly a centimeter in size transfer the leaf into a pot once in the pot it has again a 50 50 chance to spawn a new vine within two weeks once this happened the plant will continue to grow into a fully matured vine network this one took six months to get from broken baby leaflet to small sized wine once it's at that size it is ready to join my jungle harem just look at those greedy roots devil's ivy has an incredible appetite so when choosing a pot always go bigger than what you think you'll need so how do you even care for the plant when buying soil from a garden supply store it usually comes pre-fertilized on that front you should be in the clear for at least two years otherwise look up any guide on diy potting soil more important is how you deal with water smaller pots need to be watered more frequently whilst a bigger part gets away with getting a larger amount of water at longer intervals all that biomass is thirsty indeed i dump three quarters of a liter per pot once a week though to be honest you can't actually over water devil's ivy you heard me right the more the merrier dump a whole water bomber into it if you feel like it as long as you have proper drainage and the soil has the chance to dry at least once a week the pots have to drain properly and i cannot overstate this as long as excess water properly drains out of the pot you cannot over water devil's ivy if the water does not properly drain however best case scenario you'll get invisible rod setting in with a significantly weaker plant what's more likely though is that your pot will turn into a massive insect grave and if you are really lucky and really hit the jackpot straight up mold at which point you best just dump the whole thing all together to ensure proper drainage drill way more holes into the parts than you think you'll need especially bigger pots often only have a single big hole in the middle this is not enough go ham and drill more than you think you'll need next off fill the bottom fifth of the pot with coarse rocks or large gravel this will ensure that compacted soil does not clog the holes which the water is supposed to drain out of and lastly actually test it sometimes it is not obvious and water decides to just stay in the pot anyways sometimes due to a flat tray which creates a seal against the pot here i dumped more water than usual into the pot and it instantly starts filling up the tray this is how it's supposed to work on the note of trays they never look particularly great but in this case they are a must of course ceramic on the parts look great but once you have enough biomass or a bigger pot you will not be able to separate the outer part from the inner part and water staying in the outer part is not any better than a straight up clog also make sure that the tray can actually hold some damn water i know it doesn't look very appealing having trace way bigger than the actual part but trays like these are just useless oh they look great size matched and all but cannot hold any reasonable amount of water also if you cannot move the pot which if the pot is big enough you won't be able to believe me you have to remove excess water with fabric so make sure that you can actually get cloth into the tray in the first place so again as long as the potter drains and the soil dries at least once a week you're golden go ham with water the more the merrier while stella's ivy can overcome longer periods of drought as with many tropical plants ideally the soil should always be moist but since we are confined to a part in the interior it has to dry at least once a week [Music] so now everything's going great and your vines are growing but oh dear suddenly the plant has yellow leaves that go dry and fall out don't worry this is expected behavior and part of the plant's energy management a mature vine network will start rejecting undesirable leaves in favor of supplying new and younger vines even when the network has more than ample supply for itself look at this singular vine here the leaves are healthy whilst in the darker corner only half a meter to the left all leaves have dropped as the network considered them to be undesirable and yet again half a meter along the vine a new younger branch is growing this is normal and a way for the vine to reclaim energy spent once a leaf has started to turn yellow there is nothing you can do as it is chemically marked for death but don't remove yellow leaves the leaves don't actually straight up die just like with hardwoods in autumn the leaf turns chloroplasts in its cells into chromoplasts to convert and siphon energy upstream as long as the leaf remains yellow it is still a benefit to the plant as a whole only once it is dried up should you remove it this behavior is not limited to leaves by the way at some point even whole branches get rejected though this happens rarely once branches are dried up you can actually use them to support the grid with new paths just like fishing line if a singular vine has lost all of its leaves but not dried up yet do not remove them either naked branches are still used to transport water and nutrients just like with a hedge the inner part of a hatch has no leaves but it's still part of the living plant in a healthy plant the ratio of dying biomass should always be only a fraction of what the network is growing as long as a lot more biomass is produced than is being reclaimed you're golden this aggressive energy management is also why devil's ivy can go long stretches without water during drought the plant will start to reclaim more and more of its own biomass to keep pumping out new and younger branches in search for water two months without water will claim a big chunk of the biomass but resuming normal water supply should have you reach the same levels of biomass within half a year this is in part why it's really hard to actually kill devil's ivy it's okay with little water as well as lots of it though if leaves do not turn yellow before dying something is definitely up like here the green leaves turn straight up black which means rot has sat in in this case though this is traced back to simple physical damage of the vine if you are patient enough you can grow out the vines from the floor to the ceiling but ideally you should place them high already i used a bit of wood to create these corner shelves which were secured with overkill sized pegs and screws for safety since i actually sleep under a part and don't want to end up like a watermelon in those safety demonstrations all is said and done how long will this take you to get all that biomass with a pot in each corner of the room and under healthy conditions the plant should produce enough biomass to sparsely cover the ceiling within two years the plant in my room was actually gifted to her family as a singular vine some 15 years ago though my room doesn't actually even closely represent 15 years worth of biomass the wine network has been split multiple times across multiple pots over the years then neglected for half a decade and then survived being relocated three separate times whilst losing branches each time it was moved in that sense you don't even need to buy the plant as getting a couple of leaves from a donut plant already puts you on the path to jungle them [Music] the original vine network still resides within the spot the oldest vine thought to be the original gifted one is nicknamed mother vine and is traced out in red here it's easily over 20 meters by now the last time i moved everything had to be carried by four people so the vines wouldn't take too much damage as a last remark it is often stated that when exposed to direct sunlight the leaves get more of that white marble pattern this is only true to some extent these leaves in direct sunlight are definitely brighter than the deep green coloring of the leaves in the dark corners this is also evident with the new addition i just planted this smaller vine walls in direct sunlight since it was a broken baby leaflet however the degree of marble coloring mostly depends on the color variation of the plant for instance this other devil's ivy straight up has the marble pattern everywhere even in the darkest corner of the room so if you're buying devil's ivy what you see is basically what you get even if literature claims otherwise [Music] that's more than you would possibly ever need to know about my favorite basic [\u00a0__\u00a0] houseplant devil's ivy make papa proud will you [Applause] [Music]
