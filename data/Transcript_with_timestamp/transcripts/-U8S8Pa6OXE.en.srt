[Music]

2
00:01:16,640 --> 00:01:19,640
so

00:01:20,330 --> 00:01:26,069

00:01:30,170 --> 00:01:38,880

5
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:41,439
folks an exciting day get in the

6
00:01:38,880 --> 00:01:43,680
driveway installed at least most of it

7
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,680
done today but i do think that we were

8
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:47,920
off on our estimate just based on how

9
00:01:45,680 --> 00:01:50,159
far we've come so far we've had

10
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:51,920
nine loads you'll see getting dropped

11
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:54,479
off throughout this

12
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:57,439
video nine loads of stones that's that's

13
00:01:54,479 --> 00:01:59,840
10 yards 15 tons per load so 90

14
00:01:57,439 --> 00:02:01,520
90 yards so far and they were kind of

15
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:03,439
thinking and hoping about 100 yards

16
00:02:01,520 --> 00:02:04,640
total but part of it is i wanted to go

17
00:02:03,439 --> 00:02:06,399
on thicker but i'm going a little bit

18
00:02:04,640 --> 00:02:08,399
wider as well than i originally probably

19
00:02:06,399 --> 00:02:10,560
planned on you're going to see there's

20
00:02:08,399 --> 00:02:13,360
there's a couple areas here that it is a

21
00:02:10,560 --> 00:02:15,120
steep drop off when they're dropping

22
00:02:13,360 --> 00:02:17,200
this this gravel and then i'm trying to

23
00:02:15,120 --> 00:02:18,720
grate it out it's like it'll it wants to

24
00:02:17,200 --> 00:02:20,720
tip the tractor over just about but

25
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:22,480
we're using the summit tx 25 tractor

26
00:02:20,720 --> 00:02:24,319
today have a four foot land plane on

27
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:26,959
there pretty good match for it

28
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:28,879
now this stone is a little bit wet right

29
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:30,239
and so if you're doing maintenance with

30
00:02:28,879 --> 00:02:31,920
a lamp plane

31
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:33,440
you're gonna have dry material hopefully

32
00:02:31,920 --> 00:02:34,800
if you're doing it uh you know when it's

33
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:36,560
when it's dried out if you can if you

34
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:38,239
can avoid doing when it's when it's wet

35
00:02:36,560 --> 00:02:39,840
and heavy and kind of wants to stick

36
00:02:38,239 --> 00:02:41,440
together that's going to be

37
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:43,120
preferable you get better results but

38
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:44,400
what you're seeing now is fresh gravel

39
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:46,640
that's been dropped down it does have

40
00:02:44,400 --> 00:02:48,800
some moisture in it it's drying out as

41
00:02:46,640 --> 00:02:50,959
as it sits here in the sun but it tends

42
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:52,400
to want to stick together a little bit

43
00:02:50,959 --> 00:02:54,239
however overall you can get really good

44
00:02:52,400 --> 00:02:55,920
results with it still one thing about

45
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,280
the land plane that i do love is the

46
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:59,200
fact and hopefully you can see it in the

47
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,720
videos that those those there's two

48
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:02,480
blades and they're both angled they're

49
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:04,080
not straight you know perpendicular to

50
00:03:02,480 --> 00:03:05,840
the tractor they're they're a bit of an

51
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:08,159
angle tilted back on one side and so

52
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:08,959
that allows you to draw material to the

53
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:11,280
left

54
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:13,440
well let's see yeah yeah to the left and

55
00:03:11,280 --> 00:03:14,319
so depending on the direction of travel

56
00:03:13,440 --> 00:03:16,000
you can

57
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:17,680
you can make your driveway completely

58
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:19,440
flat you can put a crown into the middle

59
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:21,040
by drawing more material to the middle

60
00:03:19,440 --> 00:03:22,720
you can do all sorts of things and and

61
00:03:21,040 --> 00:03:25,040
manipulate that the way that you want to

62
00:03:22,720 --> 00:03:26,959
now tom with balcoma is really good at

63
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:29,120
his job and if you can have a good

64
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:31,120
operator that can tailgate like he can

65
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:33,760
then it's going to make your life a lot

66
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:35,840
easier if you can at all avoid having a

67
00:03:33,760 --> 00:03:37,599
pile of stone dropped just in a and a

68
00:03:35,840 --> 00:03:39,680
big heap so that you have to spread it

69
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:41,200
out you're going to save maybe hours of

70
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:43,280
time depending on the size of equipment

71
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:44,720
that you have to move it around and tom

72
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:46,400
is just you can tell

73
00:03:44,720 --> 00:03:48,080
that's what he does day in and day out

74
00:03:46,400 --> 00:03:49,519
he's been doing it for years and

75
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:51,680
you know there's a

76
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:54,000
little hump here there where it's just

77
00:03:51,680 --> 00:03:55,519
getting the run just starts or the run

78
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:57,680
just ends that kind of thing and that's

79
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:59,439
about it other than that he does 90 of

80
00:03:57,680 --> 00:04:00,799
the work and running the land plane

81
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:03,200
behind it you just kind of drop it down

82
00:04:00,799 --> 00:04:04,720
and go and all i'm doing at this point

83
00:04:03,200 --> 00:04:06,480
i'm not trying to put a crown on it i'm

84
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,360
just trying to kind of level it out

85
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:09,599
you know

86
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:12,239
where that steep drop off is draw

87
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,920
material over to that side of the drive

88
00:04:12,239 --> 00:04:15,680
so that we can

89
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:17,440
kind of build it up and have material to

90
00:04:15,680 --> 00:04:19,840
feather it out as we need to to to

91
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:20,799
prevent any dangerous situations from

92
00:04:19,840 --> 00:04:22,800
occurring

93
00:04:20,799 --> 00:04:25,440
now the overall scheme that i'm going

94
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:26,960
for here along the fence is to

95
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:28,720
in theory

96
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:30,479
kind of have that that contour

97
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:32,479
everything's draining down towards the

98
00:04:30,479 --> 00:04:34,080
marshy area so from up by the fence and

99
00:04:32,479 --> 00:04:36,479
then draining down all towards that

100
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:38,000
marsh where kind of the the down timber

101
00:04:36,479 --> 00:04:39,600
and the dead timber's at and so i'm

102
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,960
trying something new i'm trying to not

103
00:04:39,600 --> 00:04:42,880
put a crown on that area and just

104
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:45,840
essentially have it follow the natural

105
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:47,199
contour and see if we can have that rain

106
00:04:45,840 --> 00:04:49,600
as everything gets packed down and

107
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:52,160
packed in just have that rain kind of

108
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:54,320
stream right over top and maybe i'm

109
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,919
asking for for trouble but a few guys

110
00:04:54,320 --> 00:04:57,120
did recommend that or mentioned that in

111
00:04:55,919 --> 00:04:58,639
previous videos too and i'm going to

112
00:04:57,120 --> 00:05:00,160
give it a shot in this one now one of

113
00:04:58,639 --> 00:05:02,000
the big differences and why i'm going to

114
00:05:00,160 --> 00:05:04,400
go a bit deeper with stone this time

115
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:06,080
around is we did lay down road fabric

116
00:05:04,400 --> 00:05:08,479
and so i'm not too concerned for the

117
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:10,000
initial grading but if i end up having

118
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:11,199
to do a deep grade at this sometime in

119
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:13,280
the future where i have to put those

120
00:05:11,199 --> 00:05:15,600
scarifier shanks those big ripper teeth

121
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:19,120
down i want to make sure that there is

122
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:21,199
plenty of material in between the end of

123
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:22,320
my teeth and that fabric otherwise

124
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
you're going to rip up your fabric

125
00:05:22,320 --> 00:05:24,720
you're going to start pulling it up

126
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:26,800
towards the top and just making a big

127
00:05:24,720 --> 00:05:28,400
old mess so i'm going to go thicker

128
00:05:26,800 --> 00:05:31,120
because of that and that means that in

129
00:05:28,400 --> 00:05:32,720
some areas we still probably have to

130
00:05:31,120 --> 00:05:34,160
well i can still see some of the tarp

131
00:05:32,720 --> 00:05:35,120
and we've just kind of got a base layer

132
00:05:34,160 --> 00:05:36,080
on there but i probably have to add

133
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,840
another

134
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:40,240
four or five inches in some of these

135
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:41,840
areas and other areas towards the middle

136
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:43,039
it's definitely been packed down driven

137
00:05:41,840 --> 00:05:44,800
over that's the nice thing too with

138
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:46,400
these dump trucks is that if you have it

139
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:47,199
relatively smooth and tailgated like

140
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,560
that

141
00:05:47,199 --> 00:05:50,320
every load

142
00:05:48,560 --> 00:05:51,919
that driver that big old heavy truck can

143
00:05:50,320 --> 00:05:53,840
drive over it back and forth and really

144
00:05:51,919 --> 00:05:55,600
help to pack down at least the tire

145
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:57,600
track lines right maybe not the middle

146
00:05:55,600 --> 00:05:59,520
or anything else but they can get you a

147
00:05:57,600 --> 00:06:00,800
big jump start on that too folks we are

not only is it going to help with safety

155
00:06:11,280 --> 00:06:15,120
keeping those rear tires planted on the

157
00:06:15,120 --> 00:06:18,319
and traction too the benefits of rim

you're not familiar the summit tx25 is a

167
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:36,319
new tractor getting ready to hit the

168
00:06:33,759 --> 00:06:37,919
market nationwide next spring so we're

169
00:06:36,319 --> 00:06:39,680
kind of doing the videos ahead of time

170
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,360
to build some interest to show you what

171
00:06:39,680 --> 00:06:43,199
the tractor is about so that when it

172
00:06:41,360 --> 00:06:45,039
really is ready to be

173
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:47,120
bought all over the place

174
00:06:45,039 --> 00:06:49,280
you potential buyers can already be

175
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:50,479
comfortable with it and so summit sent

176
00:06:49,280 --> 00:06:51,440
us this tractor and we're doing all

177
00:06:50,479 --> 00:06:52,880
sorts of videos with different

178
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,240
attachments that we sell so you can see

179
00:06:52,880 --> 00:06:56,240
how it works

180
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,520
so far so good what i what i like about

181
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,440
this thing

182
00:06:57,520 --> 00:07:01,039
more and more i think that stands out

183
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:03,120
and i'm sure it's going to bite us in

184
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:05,280
the butt at some point is the weight the

185
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:07,919
weight's very advantageous for feeling

186
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:10,319
stable and solid and even as you watch

187
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:11,919
this video too when i'm on those

188
00:07:10,319 --> 00:07:14,160
kind of sketchy

189
00:07:11,919 --> 00:07:15,759
side inclines that lower center of

190
00:07:14,160 --> 00:07:17,039
gravity these have rim guard in the

191
00:07:15,759 --> 00:07:18,639
tires

192
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:19,520
just the natural weight of the tractor

193
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:21,520
helps

194
00:07:19,520 --> 00:07:23,680
you feel a little bit safer not that you

195
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:26,160
want to take unnecessary risks but it's

196
00:07:23,680 --> 00:07:28,000
a good position to be in the downside is

197
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:30,080
that extra weight is going to be robbing

198
00:07:28,000 --> 00:07:31,199
some power if you do want to use larger

199
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,400
attachments

200
00:07:31,199 --> 00:07:33,919
someone does a good job of telling you

201
00:07:32,400 --> 00:07:35,440
what attachments is compatible with on

202
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:37,759
their website too so you can check that

203
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:39,440
out uh for us now we're using the uh the

204
00:07:37,759 --> 00:07:41,280
four foot land plane on here speaking of

205
00:07:39,440 --> 00:07:42,880
these lamps if you are looking for

206
00:07:41,280 --> 00:07:44,479
something for your tractor like a lamp

207
00:07:42,880 --> 00:07:46,800
plane a box blade a landscape break a

208
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,479
snow blower pallet forks a grapple you

209
00:07:46,800 --> 00:07:51,360
get the idea the list just goes on and

210
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:53,520
on and on that's what i do at my company

211
00:07:51,360 --> 00:07:55,280
goodworks tractors goodworktractors.com

212
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:56,800
we sell and ship tractor attachments all

213
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,240
over the country

214
00:07:56,800 --> 00:08:00,160
and that's what my channel's about right

215
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,759
i show the attachments in action so you

216
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:03,440
can see how they work

217
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:05,440
maybe what you should do or not do with

218
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:07,360
them depending on how it goes for me but

219
00:08:05,440 --> 00:08:09,440
you can see how it would in essence work

220
00:08:07,360 --> 00:08:10,960
for you too i use the stuff that i sell

221
00:08:09,440 --> 00:08:12,319
so it makes you more comfortable with it

222
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:14,400
and just gets a better understanding and

223
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:15,919
believe me we show plenty of times when

224
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,879
things go wrong too for those of you

225
00:08:15,919 --> 00:08:20,879
interested this is 21 double a gravel a

226
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,639
little bit of clay content in there

227
00:08:20,879 --> 00:08:25,280
you'll see a section up near the road

228
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:26,560
that was installed a few months ago and

229
00:08:25,280 --> 00:08:27,919
it's been rained down and kind of

230
00:08:26,560 --> 00:08:29,919
settled in and compacted and everything

231
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,840
else cleans up looking really nice that

232
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,760
clay kind of settles down in there and

233
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:35,039
and kind of binds and ties all the stone

234
00:08:33,760 --> 00:08:36,719
together too you know it looks pretty

235
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:38,719
dusty and dirty right now looking at it

236
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:40,560
but trust me when i say it'll look just

237
00:08:38,719 --> 00:08:42,320
like that stuff up by the road and give

238
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:43,839
a good finish result now tom's bringing
