1
00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:06,359
if you have a look at this cut over here

2
00:00:02,320 --> 00:00:09,800
it is 45° to the angle of the branch

3
00:00:06,359 --> 00:00:13,080
what that means is the oins and the

4
00:00:09,800 --> 00:00:16,240
hormones are being centered around this

5
00:00:13,080 --> 00:00:19,119
corner over here which is the tip and

6
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:24,119
just below the tip is a bud that's the

7
00:00:19,119 --> 00:00:27,400
bud I want to stimulate to grow and this

8
00:00:24,119 --> 00:00:30,080
brings me into the Angles and the bud

9
00:00:27,400 --> 00:00:33,079
locations there's a bud on the very top

10
00:00:30,080 --> 00:00:36,760
over here now if I were to cut here this

11
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:38,760
bud is going to go straight up so if you

12
00:00:36,760 --> 00:00:41,840
cut it at the wrong location you got

13
00:00:38,760 --> 00:00:43,840
this nice 45° angled branch which you

14
00:00:41,840 --> 00:00:46,280
are now sending into a vertical you've

15
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:49,280
just lost a whole bunch of good work but

16
00:00:46,280 --> 00:00:53,000
if you cut it on the bottom outward

17
00:00:49,280 --> 00:00:56,800
facing node this branch is now going to

18
00:00:53,000 --> 00:00:58,559
grow that way it's not going to grow

19
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:01,760
inwards and up it's going to grow

20
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:01,760
outwards and up
