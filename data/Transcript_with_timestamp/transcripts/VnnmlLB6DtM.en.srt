1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:03,600
now let me back up if you've ever

2
00:00:01,839 --> 00:00:05,040
watched a fail video of some kind

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:06,560
hey your tires are mounted backwards

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:08,160
hopping off or quickly getting out of

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:09,120
the way instead of being crushed by it

6
00:00:08,160 --> 00:00:10,880
as it rolls over

7
00:00:09,120 --> 00:00:12,240
i hate this one i hate even knowing this

8
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:12,639
is in here and i don't know if i can

9
00:00:12,240 --> 00:00:14,000
follow

10
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:15,679
the rules but i still found it

11
00:00:14,000 --> 00:00:16,960
interesting because it is the opposite

12
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:19,439
of what i do

13
00:00:16,960 --> 00:00:20,320
pretty cool huh do you think your manual

14
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:22,320
is boring

15
00:00:20,320 --> 00:00:23,920
that you can't learn anything from it

16
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,880
you think they make these things just

17
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:26,480
for fun

18
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:28,720
there's actually some pretty good stuff

19
00:00:26,480 --> 00:00:30,000
in here okay if you got nothing better

20
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:31,359
to do with your life you can sit here

21
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:33,520
and read through the whole thing

22
00:00:31,359 --> 00:00:35,360
that's a boatload of fun right well i'm

23
00:00:33,520 --> 00:00:36,880
not going to say i sat here and did that

24
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:38,800
but i did spend quite a bit of time

25
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:40,559
recently because i was going through and

26
00:00:38,800 --> 00:00:42,160
came across something that i thought was

27
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:44,320
kind of cool answered a question from a

28
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:46,079
long time ago so then i got to looking

29
00:00:44,320 --> 00:00:47,200
and i found all sorts of other pretty

30
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:48,640
cool stuff in there too

31
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:50,000
you know the things that are buried in

32
00:00:48,640 --> 00:00:51,760
there when you're going through a manual

33
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:53,680
looking for how to fix this or what this

34
00:00:51,760 --> 00:00:56,079
knob or control means you're not really

35
00:00:53,680 --> 00:00:57,120
going through front to back and kind of

36
00:00:56,079 --> 00:00:57,920
you're just skimming you know you're

37
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:59,280
just going through getting the

38
00:00:57,920 --> 00:01:00,559
information that you want well guess

39
00:00:59,280 --> 00:01:02,079
what there's some things that stood out

40
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:03,280
to me that they maybe will stick out to

41
00:01:02,079 --> 00:01:04,960
you as well

42
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,720
if you've seen these things on tractors

43
00:01:04,960 --> 00:01:08,320
the setup whatever it might be or maybe

44
00:01:06,720 --> 00:01:10,000
you can do it on your tractor get some

45
00:01:08,320 --> 00:01:11,280
more versatility or capability or

46
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:12,960
stability or

47
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,720
anything else that ends in ility out of

48
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:16,320
it okay

49
00:01:14,720 --> 00:01:17,439
so i promise we're going to keep this

50
00:01:16,320 --> 00:01:18,640
fun we're going to keep it quick we're

51
00:01:17,439 --> 00:01:20,320
going to keep it simple

52
00:01:18,640 --> 00:01:21,840
let's get to it if you haven't done so

00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,799
yet hit that subscribe button right

54

make sure you read through the

56
00:01:23,840 --> 00:01:27,439
description as well a lot of good at

sorts of good stuff

63
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,640
this is just me the cool things that i

64
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:39,920
found in the manual if you know

65
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:41,439
something pretty cool in your manual

66
00:01:39,920 --> 00:01:42,960
because it could be specific just to the

67
00:01:41,439 --> 00:01:45,040
model of traffic that you have

68
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:46,479
make sure you leave a comment below okay

69
00:01:45,040 --> 00:01:48,000
make sure to check those out as well

70
00:01:46,479 --> 00:01:50,479
it makes it a lot of fun thanks so much

71
00:01:48,000 --> 00:01:52,479
guys okay so this one

72
00:01:50,479 --> 00:01:54,799
is a little unique i have intentionally

73
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:58,000
got an x series garden tractor

74
00:01:54,799 --> 00:01:59,200
and a one series 10 25 x 738 side by

75
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,119
side right here okay

76
00:01:59,200 --> 00:02:02,640
two different procedures and you know

77
00:02:01,119 --> 00:02:04,159
what this has come up before

78
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:05,840
uh several times actually when you're

79
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:07,360
engaging a pto okay so

80
00:02:05,840 --> 00:02:08,640
pay attention because the different

81
00:02:07,360 --> 00:02:10,000
series are going to have different

82
00:02:08,640 --> 00:02:12,800
instructions

83
00:02:10,000 --> 00:02:14,080
so to turn your pto on any john deere

84
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:16,239
1025r

85
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:18,160
let's see what it says set engine speed

86
00:02:16,239 --> 00:02:21,280
to 1500 rpms

87
00:02:18,160 --> 00:02:23,760
or less okay lower than that if anything

88
00:02:21,280 --> 00:02:25,360
and then turn your pto on how is that

89
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:28,000
going to compare to a john deere

90
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:29,360
x738 garden tractor this is totally

91
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:31,120
different okay so

92
00:02:29,360 --> 00:02:32,480
after engine has warmed up move the

93
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:35,599
throttle lever to the

94
00:02:32,480 --> 00:02:38,000
maximum engine speed and then pull your

95
00:02:35,599 --> 00:02:39,760
pto knob and turn it on okay so

96
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:42,160
totally different depending on what

97
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:44,319
machine you have what series you have so

98
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:46,480
never assume it's the same for every

99
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:48,720
machine always check your manual

100
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,160
good information to know right can

101
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,519
anybody tell me what the difference is

102
00:02:50,160 --> 00:02:52,239
though between one machine versus

103
00:02:51,519 --> 00:02:53,599
another

104
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:55,360
does it have anything to do with it

105
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:56,800
being gas versus diesel could that come

106
00:02:55,360 --> 00:02:58,239
into play at all or is there something

107
00:02:56,800 --> 00:03:01,519
else going on

108
00:02:58,239 --> 00:03:03,680
okay courtesy of our 4r series manual

109
00:03:01,519 --> 00:03:04,560
right here okay this is a 4066 tractor

110
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:05,760
right here but

111
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:07,200
i think this applies to a lot of

112
00:03:05,760 --> 00:03:08,560
machines it's not just this one this is

113
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,800
where i happen to find it at but

114
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:12,319
take a look at these front tires okay so

115
00:03:10,800 --> 00:03:14,879
let me just read it really quick here

116
00:03:12,319 --> 00:03:16,400
front tire rolling direction under most

117
00:03:14,879 --> 00:03:18,480
conditions tires should be installed

118
00:03:16,400 --> 00:03:19,920
with a directional arrow pointing in the

119
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:21,519
direction of travel there's going to be

120
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:24,000
on most of these tires an arrow that

121
00:03:21,519 --> 00:03:25,440
actually points forward okay so that's

122
00:03:24,000 --> 00:03:28,480
the direction of the tread

123
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:31,040
however hold on now okay if machine is

124
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:33,519
mainly used for loader operations

125
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:34,319
lug direction lugs okay these bad boys

126
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,640
right here

127
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:38,640
may be reversed to increase tire life

128
00:03:36,640 --> 00:03:40,319
and improve traction while backing out

129
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:42,400
of dirt piles

130
00:03:40,319 --> 00:03:44,640
intriguing isn't that okay and you know

131
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:46,640
what i've never seen that emanuel before

132
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:48,400
and sure that maybe that's just me but

133
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:50,799
i've had quite a few tractors come

134
00:03:48,400 --> 00:03:52,239
in with the uh the tires mounted in the

135
00:03:50,799 --> 00:03:53,840
opposite position here so you would take

136
00:03:52,239 --> 00:03:56,159
this tire put it on that side and

137
00:03:53,840 --> 00:03:57,760
flip flat one over and put it here okay

138
00:03:56,159 --> 00:03:59,040
but i've had them like that before you

139
00:03:57,760 --> 00:04:00,000
know i've kind of wondered i've kind of

140
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:01,519
hypothesized actually

141
00:04:00,000 --> 00:04:03,040
thought that before and had folks say

142
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,519
hey your tires are mounted backwards

143
00:04:03,040 --> 00:04:05,519
well

144
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,959
turns out there's actually a legitimate

145
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:08,480
reason to do so

146
00:04:06,959 --> 00:04:10,560
wheels must be installed so that the

147
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:11,840
valve stem is facing outwards alright

148
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:13,599
keep that in mind but

149
00:04:11,840 --> 00:04:15,120
very interesting tidbit of information

150
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,840
there if you're doing a lot of loader

151
00:04:15,120 --> 00:04:17,600
operation

152
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:19,600
perhaps that's a setup you want to look

153
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:20,959
into okay so this is one you definitely

154
00:04:19,600 --> 00:04:23,280
want to know before you get into that

155
00:04:20,959 --> 00:04:25,040
situation so pay attention

156
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,880
okay so i want you to pay close

157
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:28,560
attention to this picture right here can

158
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:30,160
you see that picture okay

159
00:04:28,560 --> 00:04:31,680
notice how the front wheels are up in

160
00:04:30,160 --> 00:04:33,280
the air the rear ones are here but it

161
00:04:31,680 --> 00:04:34,960
appears to be tipping back

162
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:37,040
now pay attention you see this chain

163
00:04:34,960 --> 00:04:38,960
right here could be a chain could be a

164
00:04:37,040 --> 00:04:40,840
cart could be a wagon whatever it is but

165
00:04:38,960 --> 00:04:42,960
imagine you're stuck in mud right here

166
00:04:40,840 --> 00:04:44,479
okay you get these

167
00:04:42,960 --> 00:04:46,320
now let me back up if you've ever

168
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:48,160
watched a fail video of some kind where

169
00:04:46,320 --> 00:04:49,520
you see a tractor online and it is just

170
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:51,919
tipped right back up over

171
00:04:49,520 --> 00:04:54,080
you know maybe in a a polling contest

172
00:04:51,919 --> 00:04:56,240
even or you know some guys have a

173
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:57,680
wagon loaded down with brick or wood or

174
00:04:56,240 --> 00:05:00,000
whatever it is and it's just

175
00:04:57,680 --> 00:05:00,720
in swampy muddy areas and things like

176
00:05:00,000 --> 00:05:02,720
that or

177
00:05:00,720 --> 00:05:04,320
it might not even be it might be on a

178
00:05:02,720 --> 00:05:06,720
hard surface like this too

179
00:05:04,320 --> 00:05:08,160
but at a certain point you got to be

180
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:09,520
very careful if you're stuck and you're

181
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
just sitting there spinning because what

182
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,880
could happen

183
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:14,560
this is right in the manual okay freeing

184
00:05:12,880 --> 00:05:17,120
a mired machine all right

185
00:05:14,560 --> 00:05:18,240
never drive forward okay because if it's

186
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:20,560
trying to get traction

187
00:05:18,240 --> 00:05:22,240
at a certain point the rear tires could

188
00:05:20,560 --> 00:05:23,280
lock up it could end up flipping the

189
00:05:22,240 --> 00:05:25,280
front end up

190
00:05:23,280 --> 00:05:26,720
and you go tumbling over backwards you

191
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:28,639
don't want that to happen so

192
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,479
let me read this to you attempting to

193
00:05:28,639 --> 00:05:33,120
free a mired machine can involve

194
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:34,720
safety hazards such as the mired tractor

195
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,280
tipping rearward

196
00:05:34,720 --> 00:05:38,800
the towing tractor overturning or the

197
00:05:37,280 --> 00:05:40,479
toe chain and tow bar

198
00:05:38,800 --> 00:05:42,720
failing and recoiling from its stretch

199
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:44,400
condition back your tractor out if it

200
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:46,479
gets mired down in mud

201
00:05:44,400 --> 00:05:48,400
unhitch any toad implements get them out

202
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:49,120
of the way dig the mud out from behind

203
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:51,199
the rear wheels

204
00:05:49,120 --> 00:05:52,720
put boards down there you get the point

205
00:05:51,199 --> 00:05:53,199
i'm just telling this is a big safety

206
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,639
thing

207
00:05:53,199 --> 00:05:55,759
never really even crossed my mind but

208
00:05:54,639 --> 00:05:57,680
it's something you definitely want to

209
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:59,120
know before you get into that situation

210
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,479
so this one is pretty sweet really

211
00:05:59,120 --> 00:06:02,560
pretty simple and straightforward but i

212
00:06:00,479 --> 00:06:03,520
found it pretty interesting all the same

213
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:06,639
okay

214
00:06:03,520 --> 00:06:08,479
every six years or six thousand hours

215
00:06:06,639 --> 00:06:11,120
okay so for most of us

216
00:06:08,479 --> 00:06:12,400
never for being honest never never gonna

217
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,560
do it never gonna have to

218
00:06:12,400 --> 00:06:16,560
if coolant is checked annually the

219
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:18,400
service interval can be extended to six

220
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:21,680
years six thousand hours

221
00:06:18,400 --> 00:06:22,800
flush and replace at that point now i

222
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:24,160
don't know about you but i find that to

223
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:25,919
be pretty incredible and

224
00:06:24,160 --> 00:06:27,440
the same thing can be said for vehicles

225
00:06:25,919 --> 00:06:28,800
you know trucks and and all sorts of

226
00:06:27,440 --> 00:06:30,240
other machines too but these service

227
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:30,880
intervals are extending further and

228
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:32,960
further

229
00:06:30,880 --> 00:06:34,000
even regular engine oil changes you know

230
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:35,680
or every 200 hours

231
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:37,360
in these so i just find it pretty

232
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:37,919
incredible they're quite low maintenance

233
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,520
and it's

234
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,280
moving into the lower and lower

235
00:06:39,520 --> 00:06:42,080
maintenance ski there's certain things

236
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:43,680
you want to do

237
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,880
i want to make sure you know about that

238
00:06:43,680 --> 00:06:47,120
and so while some of these can be

239
00:06:44,880 --> 00:06:48,240
delayed for as long as you possibly want

240
00:06:47,120 --> 00:06:49,919
others like the one i'm going to tell

241
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,960
you about now need to be done on a very

242
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:53,039
regular basis

243
00:06:50,960 --> 00:06:54,240
like my dad always used to say i'm hard

244
00:06:53,039 --> 00:06:56,319
on you because i love you

245
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:57,680
okay so i'm not going to stop telling

246
00:06:56,319 --> 00:07:00,080
you about this lube shuttle

247
00:06:57,680 --> 00:07:01,360
grease okay the most important way to

248
00:07:00,080 --> 00:07:02,560
protect your machine why

249
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:04,639
because it's the one thing they have to

250
00:07:02,560 --> 00:07:06,000
do most often on your machine keep it

251
00:07:04,639 --> 00:07:08,160
greased okay and if you have an

252
00:07:06,000 --> 00:07:09,520
easy way to do that not dealing with one

253
00:07:08,160 --> 00:07:10,800
of those traditional grease guns that

254
00:07:09,520 --> 00:07:12,319
leak all over the place

255
00:07:10,800 --> 00:07:14,479
you can see it right here what's it say

256
00:07:12,319 --> 00:07:16,720
rethink greasing no plunger to pull back

257
00:07:14,479 --> 00:07:18,319
no air gaps no leaking grease no wasted

258
00:07:16,720 --> 00:07:19,919
grease no waste of time

259
00:07:18,319 --> 00:07:22,160
you've got the steel cover on the top

260
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:22,880
there you undo that you take it off

261
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,800
that's just to

262
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:26,240
protect it you know and you got grease

263
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:27,520
tubes here all right you can see there's

264
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:28,880
no there's no grease leaking out there

265
00:07:27,520 --> 00:07:30,080
there's no mess here at all

266
00:07:28,880 --> 00:07:31,440
you just take it off and you need to

267
00:07:30,080 --> 00:07:32,639
replace it you can even refill these

268
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:34,240
things if you want but

269
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:36,720
you get five percent off discount code

270
00:07:34,240 --> 00:07:37,199
gwt i'm telling you greece is your

271
00:07:36,720 --> 00:07:39,680
friend

272
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:41,599
okay so uh put it on there take care of

273
00:07:39,680 --> 00:07:43,120
it go to the description below in the

274
00:07:41,599 --> 00:07:44,479
video or go to my website you'll see

275
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:46,879
where you can buy this stuff get five

276
00:07:44,479 --> 00:07:48,960
percent off discount code gwt

277
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,800
okay seriously another important safety

278
00:07:48,960 --> 00:07:52,160
tip here kind of crazy i'm telling you

279
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,520
you just never would think about this

280
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,960
kind of thing we're talking about the

281
00:07:53,520 --> 00:07:55,919
rops okay you got it in a folded

282
00:07:54,960 --> 00:07:57,840
position right here

283
00:07:55,919 --> 00:07:59,440
now what does the manual tell you if you

284
00:07:57,840 --> 00:08:00,800
have it in a folded position say

285
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:02,240
you need to go underneath the tree

286
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:03,520
something else like that into a building

287
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,879
whatever else it might be

288
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:07,199
well it's going to tell you get that

289
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:09,039
rops back up into the fully upright

290
00:08:07,199 --> 00:08:11,199
position as soon as possible

291
00:08:09,039 --> 00:08:12,319
but while you have it lowered you do not

292
00:08:11,199 --> 00:08:14,400
want to have your seatbelt

293
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:16,720
on okay do not use a seat belt with the

294
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:18,400
wraps folded according to your manual

295
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,759
always reference your own manual in case

296
00:08:18,400 --> 00:08:21,039
it tells you something different but

297
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:22,639
what happens if your rops is in the

298
00:08:21,039 --> 00:08:24,240
fully up position

299
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,680
well as you might imagine you want to

300
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:27,599
have your seat belt on

301
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:29,919
if the rops is in the up position okay

302
00:08:27,599 --> 00:08:31,599
so again you want to keep this up just

303
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:33,839
as much as you possibly can

304
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:36,000
and if so keep your seatbelt on if you

305
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:38,159
have it down take it off so

306
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,000
kind of my hypothesis behind that it

307
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,200
doesn't really come out and say that in

308
00:08:40,000 --> 00:08:43,039
the manual here but

309
00:08:41,200 --> 00:08:44,399
if the wraps is up then it's definitely

310
00:08:43,039 --> 00:08:45,920
gonna do what it's designed to do which

311
00:08:44,399 --> 00:08:47,600
is keep it from actually rolling all the

312
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,880
way over it'll tip on its side

313
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:50,720
and it'll just kind of lay there right

314
00:08:48,880 --> 00:08:51,920
so if you are strapped in here

315
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:53,839
then there's not really a chance for you

316
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,959
to roll out and get crushed underneath

317
00:08:53,839 --> 00:08:57,120
something here but

318
00:08:54,959 --> 00:08:59,839
if the rops is down then it's not going

319
00:08:57,120 --> 00:09:02,000
to protect it from rolling over right so

320
00:08:59,839 --> 00:09:03,360
if that's the case i think anyways if

321
00:09:02,000 --> 00:09:04,480
you don't have a seat belt on then you

322
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:06,080
have a better chance of

323
00:09:04,480 --> 00:09:07,680
hopping off or quickly getting out of

324
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,959
the way instead of being crushed by it

325
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,720
as it rolls over

326
00:09:08,959 --> 00:09:12,800
on that note make sure you check out

327
00:09:10,720 --> 00:09:14,080
these safety videos about ballast weight

328
00:09:12,800 --> 00:09:16,399
okay these kinds of things are going to

329
00:09:14,080 --> 00:09:18,560
help keep you grounded keep you in place

330
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:20,399
duallies wheel spacers liquid ballast

331
00:09:18,560 --> 00:09:21,519
rear ballast all sorts of stuff loading

332
00:09:20,399 --> 00:09:23,040
your loads low

333
00:09:21,519 --> 00:09:25,440
everything you can do to make sure that

334
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:26,880
kind of situation does not occur

335
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:28,959
you know just when i thought i knew

336
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:30,560
everything about trailering a tractor

337
00:09:28,959 --> 00:09:33,519
you'll learn something new right here in

338
00:09:30,560 --> 00:09:35,040
the manual close fuel shut off valve if

339
00:09:33,519 --> 00:09:36,560
your machine is equipped

340
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,680
really you got to turn the fuel off if

341
00:09:36,560 --> 00:09:38,959
you're going to transport your machine

342
00:09:37,680 --> 00:09:41,519
on a trailer

343
00:09:38,959 --> 00:09:42,959
additionally okay i hate this one i hate

344
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:43,920
even knowing this is in here and i don't

345
00:09:42,959 --> 00:09:47,040
know if i can follow

346
00:09:43,920 --> 00:09:49,360
the rules it says position

347
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:51,519
machine on trailer so the hood or engine

348
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:53,200
cover opens from the rear of the trailer

349
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:55,279
okay that means for most of these

350
00:09:53,200 --> 00:09:56,720
you got to put it on backwards i really

351
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:58,399
hate backing on

352
00:09:56,720 --> 00:09:59,600
tractors on the trailers i like to drive

353
00:09:58,399 --> 00:10:01,040
them on i like to back them off that's

354
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:02,000
just what i like doing

355
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
what do you guys think you're going to

356
00:10:02,000 --> 00:10:06,000
back them on or drive them forward

357
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,839
okay a couple interesting ones right in

358
00:10:06,000 --> 00:10:09,360
your loader manual pay attention now

359
00:10:07,839 --> 00:10:11,519
we've talked about it before but it

360
00:10:09,360 --> 00:10:13,360
becomes official now that we've located

361
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:15,279
it in the manual okay so

362
00:10:13,360 --> 00:10:16,880
leveling in reverse say you're grading

363
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:18,959
out a drive something like that

364
00:10:16,880 --> 00:10:20,399
go golden reverse something like this

365
00:10:18,959 --> 00:10:22,320
maybe a little more maybe a little less

366
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,959
is about the maximum pitch that you want

367
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:25,040
to have

368
00:10:22,959 --> 00:10:27,519
the max maximum angle on your bucket

369
00:10:25,040 --> 00:10:29,200
there okay to avoid damage to the loader

370
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:30,320
or bending the bucket cutting edge while

371
00:10:29,200 --> 00:10:32,480
leveling in reverse

372
00:10:30,320 --> 00:10:33,360
position the bucket less than 40 degrees

373
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:35,680
below level

374
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,120
okay and when possible put it in float

375
00:10:35,680 --> 00:10:38,000
we've talked all about that you guys

376
00:10:37,120 --> 00:10:39,600
know what that is

377
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:42,240
now let's flip-flop that what about

378
00:10:39,600 --> 00:10:44,640
going forward not in reverse

379
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:45,920
leveling or scraping and forward okay

380
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:46,560
what you want to do you want to have

381
00:10:45,920 --> 00:10:49,200
this bucket

382
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:50,000
almost completely level or just slightly

383
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:51,839
raised up

384
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:53,760
to prevent that damage to the bucket

385
00:10:51,839 --> 00:10:55,120
edge there to your cylinders you know to

386
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:57,120
jamming something up you never want to

387
00:10:55,120 --> 00:10:58,800
go too fast either and again use float

388
00:10:57,120 --> 00:11:01,120
when possible

389
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:02,320
now you know okay now check this out

390
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,880
this is pretty sweet and i'm going to

391
00:11:02,320 --> 00:11:05,040
tell you

392
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:06,560
the r4 tires that really common tread

393
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,920
pattern i don't think that that's going

394
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:10,480
to have this option here

395
00:11:07,920 --> 00:11:12,240
but you get an ag tire like this you see

396
00:11:10,480 --> 00:11:14,800
all these bolts right here how this

397
00:11:12,240 --> 00:11:16,800
inner wheel this plate here is really

398
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:17,600
separate from the outer wheel of the rim

399
00:11:16,800 --> 00:11:19,600
right here

400
00:11:17,600 --> 00:11:22,000
that gives you up to eight different

401
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:23,279
rear wheel positions okay that is insane

402
00:11:22,000 --> 00:11:24,560
okay and and think about this

403
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,560
i'm gonna flip over to the other page

404
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,640
here

405
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,560
the narrowest position it shows on here

406
00:11:28,640 --> 00:11:33,040
is 51 inches wide

407
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:36,079
okay and the widest position it shows on

408
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:38,079
here is 75 inches wide that is a

409
00:11:36,079 --> 00:11:39,600
two foot difference from from narrowest

410
00:11:38,079 --> 00:11:42,079
to widest position

411
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:43,440
now it does list an r4 tread pattern

412
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:44,880
here let me show you

413
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,880
so maybe there is such a thing that

414
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,240
exists and i just don't know about it

415
00:11:46,880 --> 00:11:50,240
i don't know if you can see that or not

416
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:52,240
but it's right down here you can see the

417
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:54,320
r4 tread pattern on there but

418
00:11:52,240 --> 00:11:55,279
check out your manual because no matter

419
00:11:54,320 --> 00:11:57,040
what you have

420
00:11:55,279 --> 00:11:58,560
you're going to have at least more than

421
00:11:57,040 --> 00:12:00,000
one position and that's going to really

422
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:01,839
help some of you with

423
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:03,839
that lateral stability that you need

424
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:06,160
which asked about it all the time you

425
00:12:03,839 --> 00:12:07,360
know i put dualies on my little 1025 r

426
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,639
there to help with that stability i've

427
00:12:07,360 --> 00:12:11,200
talked about wheel spacers

428
00:12:08,639 --> 00:12:12,639
all sorts of ways so get yourself that

429
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:13,360
liquid ballast in here everything you

430
00:12:12,639 --> 00:12:15,360
need to do

431
00:12:13,360 --> 00:12:18,000
in order to get that center of gravity

432
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:19,839
down low and that without y to just make

433
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:21,760
your tractor and your machine stable

434
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:23,120
but some of you you need to have narrow

435
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:24,639
or wide or different space in there to

436
00:12:23,120 --> 00:12:25,279
get between rows or whatever the case

437
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,880
might be

438
00:12:25,279 --> 00:12:28,160
so pretty cool to know also on your

439
00:12:26,880 --> 00:12:28,800
front wheels as well you're also going

440
00:12:28,160 --> 00:12:31,040
to have

441
00:12:28,800 --> 00:12:33,040
an offset plate so you'll be able to

442
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:34,240
have a narrower stance or a wider stance

443
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:37,519
but it does say

444
00:12:34,240 --> 00:12:40,800
note this okay you cannot use the loader

445
00:12:37,519 --> 00:12:42,720
with the wheels in the wide position

446
00:12:40,800 --> 00:12:44,320
okay so i got to be honest i don't like

447
00:12:42,720 --> 00:12:46,000
this one right here but i still found it

448
00:12:44,320 --> 00:12:47,200
interesting because it is the opposite

449
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,440
of what i do

450
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,800
and that is removing material from a

451
00:12:49,440 --> 00:12:52,959
pile okay i know

452
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:54,079
i know how can there be a problem with

453
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,760
that right but

454
00:12:54,079 --> 00:12:57,839
approach and enter a pile with a level

455
00:12:55,760 --> 00:13:00,720
bucket okay pretty straightforward

456
00:12:57,839 --> 00:13:02,480
if the pile is high remove the top first

457
00:13:00,720 --> 00:13:04,000
okay so you got your big pyramid shape

458
00:13:02,480 --> 00:13:05,600
pile of dirt or stone or mulch or

459
00:13:04,000 --> 00:13:07,600
whatever it is it's telling you if it's

460
00:13:05,600 --> 00:13:07,920
a high pile i don't know how high high

461
00:13:07,600 --> 00:13:09,920
is

462
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:10,959
but if it's high take the top off first

463
00:13:09,920 --> 00:13:12,959
well first of all

464
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:14,320
you scoop into a the top of a pile it's

465
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,800
just going to push it off the other end

466
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,399
right

467
00:13:14,800 --> 00:13:17,839
part of the reason i like to go low is

468
00:13:16,399 --> 00:13:19,360
because it gives you something a little

469
00:13:17,839 --> 00:13:21,360
backstop there you know you can push

470
00:13:19,360 --> 00:13:23,279
into it scoop what you need out and pull

471
00:13:21,360 --> 00:13:25,040
it back this is telling you to pull

472
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:27,200
off the top first and i don't get that

473
00:13:25,040 --> 00:13:29,440
so what do you guys do top bottom

474
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:30,560
does it matter and to be honest with you

475
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,839
i can't really figure out what the

476
00:13:30,560 --> 00:13:33,200
downside would be just to pull on the

477
00:13:31,839 --> 00:13:33,760
bottom of the pile it's not like we're

478
00:13:33,200 --> 00:13:35,519
talking

479
00:13:33,760 --> 00:13:37,040
it's a stray vertical pile here and if

480
00:13:35,519 --> 00:13:38,240
you pull the bottom out the top is going

481
00:13:37,040 --> 00:13:39,920
to collapse down on you

482
00:13:38,240 --> 00:13:42,320
you know a natural pile of dirt is going

483
00:13:39,920 --> 00:13:44,720
to be kind of a pyramidal shape you know

484
00:13:42,320 --> 00:13:46,560
or a triangular triangular shape with

485
00:13:44,720 --> 00:13:47,760
a tapered side slope going this way

486
00:13:46,560 --> 00:13:49,040
where you're not just going to collapse

487
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,560
everything in on you right

488
00:13:49,040 --> 00:13:52,480
am i forgetting something here am i

489
00:13:50,560 --> 00:13:54,320
missing something what's going on

490
00:13:52,480 --> 00:13:56,240
well those are 10 fascinating pieces of

491
00:13:54,320 --> 00:13:57,519
information i found buried inside our
