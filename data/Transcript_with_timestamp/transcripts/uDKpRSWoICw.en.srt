00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:36,800
for the production of french fries and

12
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:39,760
chips

00:00:36,800 --> 00:00:40,800
we also cultivate cereals winter wheat

helps me to carry out plant protection

18
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:56,000
and fertilization tasks

19
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:58,640
in a targeted and precise manner for my

20
00:00:56,000 --> 00:01:00,800
large number of fields and crops

21
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:03,120
when i open up the program salvia gives

22
00:01:00,800 --> 00:01:05,360
me a plant protection recommendation

23
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:06,640
for example in winter wheat i select

24
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:08,640
products in the program

25
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:11,760
and i can create plant protection tasks

26
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:11,760
or application maps

27
00:01:16,159 --> 00:01:20,479
i select a plant protection product for

28
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:24,080
example the honorary treatment

29
00:01:20,479 --> 00:01:25,840
specify a water application rate

30
00:01:24,080 --> 00:01:27,920
specify an application rate of the

31
00:01:25,840 --> 00:01:31,200
product a maximum

32
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:33,119
application rate and the program helps

33
00:01:31,200 --> 00:01:34,880
me to supply the zones in the area that

34
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:37,280
have a high crop density

35
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:39,119
with more plant protection product and

36
00:01:37,280 --> 00:01:41,200
to supply zones with a lower crop

37
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:42,799
density with less plant protection

38
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,799
products

39
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:46,720
application maps are created via

40
00:01:44,799 --> 00:01:47,930
satellite images which are available for

41
00:01:46,720 --> 00:01:50,240
me

43
00:01:50,240 --> 00:01:56,560
i select them and i can change them if

44
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:56,560
the proposed values do not suit for me

45
00:01:57,200 --> 00:02:09,240
these maps are saved in savio and then i

46
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:12,289
can send these maps to the aggro router

48
00:02:13,280 --> 00:02:17,680
the employee can use the myamma router

00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:18,319
app to receive the data from the agra

50
00:02:17,680 --> 00:02:20,480
rooter

51
00:02:18,319 --> 00:02:23,840
and transfer it via wireless lan to the

52
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:23,840
amatron 4 terminal

53
00:02:24,239 --> 00:02:28,480
the application map is now on the

54
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,280
amatron 4 and the driver can take a look

55
00:02:28,480 --> 00:02:36,330
at the map

56
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:43,319
and use it in the field immediately

when the tasks are finished on the field

61
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:19,840
the driver can send the as applied map

62
00:03:13,120 --> 00:03:19,840
back to the aggro router

63
00:03:24,159 --> 00:03:28,640
this as applied map can be picked up by

64
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:30,840
me from the agra router in the office

65
00:03:28,640 --> 00:03:33,840
and i can use it in my farm management
