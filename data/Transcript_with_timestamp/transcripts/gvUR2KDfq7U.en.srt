00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:13,519
I'm Tom harlo uh Castro Farm Westminster

2
00:00:10,519 --> 00:00:16,279
Vermont we have 50 acres of vegetables

3
00:00:13,519 --> 00:00:18,119
here and we're doing about 15 to 20

4
00:00:16,279 --> 00:00:20,760
acres of sweet

5
00:00:18,119 --> 00:00:24,880
corn our primary market for the sweet

6
00:00:20,760 --> 00:00:26,800
corn is uh local retail at a roadside

7
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:29,640
stand that we have as far as crop

8
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:32,840
rotation goes we usually start with corn

9
00:00:29,640 --> 00:00:35,600
or squash in a field then we move on to

10
00:00:32,840 --> 00:00:37,920
uh greens and then to a root crop in the

11
00:00:35,600 --> 00:00:37,920
third

12
00:00:43,520 --> 00:00:48,480
year being an organic farm we generally

13
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:51,360
use a lot of compost about 20 yards per

14
00:00:48,480 --> 00:00:54,840
acre on everything except root crops and

15
00:00:51,360 --> 00:00:58,399
then we use winter Ry and vet as a cover

16
00:00:54,840 --> 00:01:01,559
crop on everything every year our

17
00:00:58,399 --> 00:01:06,159
primary cover crop here is rye which we

18
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:08,560
use at um 100 lb per acre I try to

19
00:01:06,159 --> 00:01:10,960
substitute 10 to 20 pounds of that rye

20
00:01:08,560 --> 00:01:14,320
seed with vetch seed to make a total of

21
00:01:10,960 --> 00:01:16,600
100 PB per acre cover crop seed uh cover

22
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:19,680
crops are generally tilled in fairly

23
00:01:16,600 --> 00:01:21,360
early for uh some early vegetables but

24
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:24,119
for corn and squash we like to wait

25
00:01:21,360 --> 00:01:26,840
until miday to let the Rye and the vet

26
00:01:24,119 --> 00:01:29,640
mature as much as possible after using a

27
00:01:26,840 --> 00:01:32,159
mold board plow we uh generally apply

28
00:01:29,640 --> 00:01:34,560
about 20 yards per acre compost and then

29
00:01:32,159 --> 00:01:37,560
we discar two or three times and then

30
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:41,280
we're ready to plant we do soil tests

31
00:01:37,560 --> 00:01:44,360
here every year on every field and uh we

32
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:46,439
amend our soils with compost and we use

33
00:01:44,360 --> 00:01:49,040
some Blended fertilizer through the

34
00:01:46,439 --> 00:01:50,880
Planters being an organic farmer we rely

35
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:52,960
heavily on our cover crops and our

36
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:54,399
compost to provide us with the nutrients

37
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:57,759
that we need so that we don't have to

38
00:01:54,399 --> 00:02:00,600
make huge purchases of uh Blended

39
00:01:57,759 --> 00:02:03,159
fertilizers we make our own compost here

40
00:02:00,600 --> 00:02:05,479
on the farm um we have manure here

41
00:02:03,159 --> 00:02:07,960
that's trucked in raw manure trucked in

42
00:02:05,479 --> 00:02:10,399
from the local Dairy Farm best stuff we

43
00:02:07,960 --> 00:02:12,840
get is mixed with a lot of straw dumped

44
00:02:10,399 --> 00:02:15,280
in a wind row we turn it every two or

45
00:02:12,840 --> 00:02:20,280
three weeks with a bucket loader gives

46
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:20,280
us excellent compost the way it is
