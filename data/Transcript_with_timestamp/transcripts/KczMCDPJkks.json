  "text": "hi I'm Melissa Sakura and BSU Extension agent agriculture and natural resources for sergeant cabbage today I'm going to be preparing my garden for the growing season with a few simple steps if you haven't taken a soil sample in a few years it's recommended that you do so so you know you're available nutrient levels in your soils and yes you Extension has a video available that walks you through the process of taking a sample if you have questions once you have your soil test results you'll be able to determine if a fertilizer application is needed or not when preparing my garden I want to make sure to remove any old plant materials from the sterile surface removing these plant materials will help reduce my chances of spreading diseases that may have overwintered when determining if my garden soil is ready to be worked or not I'm going to look at the soil moisture about two to three inches deep so now I'm going to take a sample look at the moisture the soil here is easily crumbling apart then it's ready to be worked if it stays in a ball and doesn't fall apart easily you'll want to wait a few days for the soil to dry out if you work your soil when it's too wet it's going to form clumps and it's gonna be really hard for those seeds to germinate and establish in that soil before working your soil you may choose to add compost which will help with nutrient and water holding if your soil is ready to be worked you can kill your garden to provide for a nice seed bed perhaps you have a smaller gun area or a raised bed and you can also use your shovel and rig to provide a nice seed bed to go many gardeners are also choosing no-till as an option when planning for my gardening season I want to make sure I have enough space between rows so I get until throughout the girl named season to kill the weeds if needed I also want to make sure I plant enough space between my plants for them to have adequate room to grow and I want to plan for my crop rotations so I'm not planting my tomatoes in the same spot every year I like to use a garden journal when planning for the season that way I can plan my rotation my available space and I can also make notes in my journal throughout the growing season and which varieties I liked and didn't like and reference it from here to here if you have any questions about preparing and planning your garden contact your local NDSU Extension agent and they'd be happy to help",
